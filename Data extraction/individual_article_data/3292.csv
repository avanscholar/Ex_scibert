0,Introduction,"The upgrading and processing of heavy oil fractions is a great challenge for the petroleum industry. These fractions comprise heavy organic compounds that are rather stable under conventional chemical processes. Furthermore atmospheric and vacuum residues, bitumen, asphaltenes and other heavy crude oil fractions always contain significant amounts of sulfur-, nitrogen- and metal-containing organic compounds that are very harmful for the industrial catalysts that reduces the efficiency of catalytic processes [1–6]. Within this context, the efficient technology of the qualified upgrading of the asphaltenes as the heaviest oil component without their isolation from the crude oil is the challenging task. During the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been made to apply supercritical fluids (SCF) for the upgrading of the asphaltenes, bitumen and other heavy fractions [7–20]. Sometimes the SCF can be used even without heterogeneous catalyst that have been supported by many studies [7,8,13–15,19] and summarized in a recent review [21]. For instance, supercritical water (SCW) can act as a nonpolar solvent toward different organics, effective acid/base catalyst or as a donor of hydrogen generated in situ via the water-gas shift reaction. Thermal cracking of heavy fractions [7,8,13–15,18], accompanying with their demetallization [10,11,22], partial desulfurization and denitrification [9,18,20,23], as well as suppression of coke formation [7,8,13–15] are the main advantages of SCW [13,23–26]. Aromatics and saturated hydrocarbons in supercritical state have other benefits [11,12,16,17]. In particular, supercritical alkylbenzenes can efficiently upgrade vacuum residues with high conversion and low coke formation [12,16,27,28]. The sc n-alkanes can remove up to 80 wt% of sulfur and nitrogen and almost totally demetallize the heavy crude oil [11]. Following the regular classification of the technologies for heavy oil upgrading, the SCF processing can be categorized as “hydrogen addition process” similarly to hydrocracking, hydrotreating or hydrorefining, which are in high demand nowadays. So, the upgrading of the heavy feedstock should be more efficient and successful in case a supercritical medium is of “hydrogen-rich” type like alkyl aromatics or saturated hydrocarbons systems. Supercritical lower alcohol is another type of promising, cheap and environmentally friendly “hydrogen-rich” medium that has high potential for the refining of the heavy crudes in non-catalytic and catalytic processes. The lower alcohols in certain processes can act as a catalyst (co-catalyst) [29,30] and sometimes can be considered to a certain extent as a “catalytic” medium [31,32], it is important to test the “catalytic” capability of alcohols under supercritical conditions as was done earlier for near- and supercritical water [33]. Unfortunately, there is very limited experimental data concerning the mechanism of the action of lower alcohols and the peculiarities of their behavior during the chemical reactions under supercritical conditions. Earlier sc ethanol and methanol were used for deasphaltization of petroleum vacuum residue and crude oil via extraction procedure where supercritical alcohols acted as a polar solvent or component of the solvent [28,34–36]. At the same time, the chemical reactivity of the lower alcohols is high enough to transform heavy organic compounds and incorporate different heteroatomic functional groups in their molecular structure at elevated temperatures. Supercritical alcohols are efficient for alcoholysis of amides to alkyl ester [37], transetherification of phenol ethers [38] and transesterification of carboxylic acid esters (the general chemical reaction of biodiesel production), C-alkylation of CC bonds of aromatics [39–41] or olefins [42,43], N-alkylation of anilines [39,44,45], as well as lignin and polyamides depolymerization [38,46,47], etc. A very important feature of sc alcohols that composes their potential for upgrading of heavy oil components is their ability to donate hydrogen in enough amounts. For example, sc isopropanol is known to be very efficient H-donor molecule in hydrogen transfer reactions (catalytic or non-catalytic) and is able to reduce various functional groups of organic compounds [48–52], as well as inorganic salts and oxides [53–55]. Despite the fundamental prerequisites, there is only sporadic studies of the transformation of the asphaltenes as well as other heavy oil fractions in sc lower alcohols so far [56–62]. Here we report the result of the systematic experimental study of the petroleum asphaltenes transformation in supercritical lower alcohols – methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. The original data presented here are complementary to the analysis of the chemical transformation of asphaltenes in supercritical alcohols we made recently via FTIR and NMR methods [62]. Elemental and chromatographic analyses were performed to elucidate chemical transformation of the asphaltenes under operating conditions. The special attention we pay here to the H/C ratio, S and N content of the refined products. The comprehensive and comparative analysis of the influence of alcohol nature on asphaltenes conversion, quantitative distribution of main fractions and chemical composition of the products are made accenting on the desulfurization and denitrogenation processes. The data obtained are compared with those obtained for the transformation of asphaltenes in SCW at similar conditions [63]."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and solvents,"2.1 Reagents and solvents All solvents were used without additional purification: methanol (≥99.8% with a water content ≤0.05%, J.T. Baker), ethanol (≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-propanol (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2-propanol (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), n-hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich), and benzene (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). Critical parameters of used alcohols are as follows. For methanol: T cr = 240 °C, P cr = 80 atm, ρ cr = 0.27 g cm−3; ethanol: T cr = 244 °C, P cr = 63 atm, ρ cr = 0.28 g cm−3; 1-propanol: T cr = 264 °C, P cr = 51 atm, ρ cr = 0.28 g cm−3; isopropanol (2-propanol): T cr = 235 °C, P cr = 47 atm, ρ cr = 0.27 g cm−3. The Tatar heavy crude oil (from the oil fields of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia) of 4.5% sulfur content was used as a source of asphaltenes. The asphaltenes were precipitated and purified following the modified ASTM method D6560-12 [64] by replacing heptane and toluene as solvents for n-hexane and benzene, respectively. The amount of asphaltenes isolated by the method was up to 7.0 wt% of the crude oil."
3,Experimental setup,"2.2 Experimental setup The scheme of Experimental Setup is shown in Fig. 1 . The setup comprises a 285 mL high-temperature batch reactor of Autoclave Engineers (A). AISI type 316L stainless steel is the reactor’s wall material. The autoclave is equipped with the mechanical agitator MagneDrive® (Autoclave Engineers) and two thermocouples (T 1, T 2). Programmable logic controller (B) allows us to regulate mixer speed, the temperatures (T 1 and T 2) as well as reaction pressure by electronic pressure sensor (P)."
4,General experimental procedure,"2.3 General experimental procedure The batch reactor was charged by ∼120 ± 1 mL of alcohol (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or isopropanol) and 3.00 g of oil asphaltenes. Afterwards the reactor was closed, purged with argon and heated up with the rate of ∼7 °C min−1 during 47–50 min to reach the reaction temperature of 350 ± 1 °C. The reaction was realized at constant temperature of 350 ± 1 °C during 3 h with permanent stirring at 800 rpm. The density of reaction mixture was approximately 0.33 g cm−3. The reaction pressure depended on the alcohol used and rose slowly during the reaction: for methanol, from 210 up to 242 atm; for ethanol, from 179 up to 189 atm; for 1-propanol, from 112 up to 138 atm; and for isopropanol, from 118 up to 160 atm, respectively. After cooling of the reactor to room temperature (during 30 min), the residual pressure after the reaction was 3–6 atm."
5,Separation and fractionation of the products,"2.4 Separation and fractionation of the products The gases formed during the reaction were separated; their volumes were measured at room temperature. The chemical composition of the gases was analyzed by a GC–MS method. The final reaction mixture was divided into two parts: solution of the products in alcohol (“Reaction solution” in Fig. 2 ) and insoluble solids (“Solids” in Fig. 2). The solvent was distilled off from the solution at atmospheric pressure to give a solution of volatile organic compounds (“VOC” in Fig. 2) in alcohol and a waxy residue (“Alcohol-soluble fraction” in Fig. 2, ASF). All the solid products were redistributed by the following extraction with hot n-hexane and benzene to give a hexane-soluble fraction (HSF), a benzene-soluble fraction (BSF), and a residue insoluble neither in n-hexane nor in benzene (IR). To make it we placed combined solids in a Soxhlet apparatus charged with ∼250 mL of n-hexane that was refluxed until the solvent dripping back into the distillation flask became colorless (4–8 h). After extraction, the solvent was removed from the hexane solution using rotary evaporator with a heating bath at 85 °C and atmospheric pressure and a slow continuous flow of CO2 to concentrate the extract to 15–20 mL. After cooling down to the room temperature, the extract was filtered out, and residual solvent was removed from the prepared concentrate to give HSF. The extraction of the residual solids was repeated with benzene in the same manner to give the BSF. The insoluble residue was dried under reduced pressure of 12–15 Torr at 100 °C. The overall procedure scheme of the products separation and fractionation can be found in Fig. 2."
6,Chromatographic analysis of the volatile products,"2.5 Chromatographic analysis of the volatile products The analysis of the VOC was performed by GC–MS method using GCMS-QP2010-SE (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a 30 m-long quartz capillary column VF-5ms (Agilent, USA). The qualitative analysis was realized using NIST11 and Wiley9 libraries. The collected gas fraction was analyzed with GC-1000 (Chromos, Russia) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and 3 m × 3 mm column filled with Unibeads C molecular sieves. H2S was determined using HayeSep 3 m × 2 mm column and helium as the carrier gas (30 cm3 min−1), T det = T inj = 200 °C. The probe was injected at T ini = 30 °C, kept for 400 s, then heated at constant rate (12 °C min−1) up to 200 °C and kept at this temperature for 20 min. A GC-1000 equipped with FPD and FID detectors was used for the analysis of sulfur containing compounds. The GC separation was performed using 25 m × 0.32 mm quartz capillary column coated with a 0.5 μm film of an inert stationary phase (5% diphenylsiloxane – 95% dimethylsiloxane copolymer). Helium was used as the carrier gas (7 mL min−1). The temperatures of the FID and the FPD were 310 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The column was temperature programmed: 50 °C (3 min), 50–290 °C (3 °C min−1) and 290 °C (10 min). 2 μL of 5 wt% chloroform solutions of the SRGO, the FCC LCO and the HSFMeOH (HSF obtained after processing in sc methanol) were injected."
7,"Elemental analysis (C, H, N, S and O)","2.6 Elemental analysis (C, H, N, S and O) The analysis of CHNS and O elements was made using a Vario EL analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany). The samples (2–3 mg) were combusted at 950 °C (CHNS analysis) or 1200 °C (oxygen analysis, with a catalyst). All the analyses were repeated three times and average values of the C, H, N, S and O content (wt%) were calculated (Table 2). Trace metals analysis (V and Ni, Table 3) was performed by the XRF technique using the ARL ADVANT’X IntelliPower X-ray fluorescence sequential spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). The instrument was equipped with a rhodium anode end-window X-ray tube (a 3.6 kW maximum power) of 4 G N type fitted with a thin beryllium window (0.075 mm)."
8,Results and discussion,"Few years ago, we report the data on chemical transformation of the same petroleum asphaltenes in water under supercritical conditions (SCW) at 380 °C and 226 atm [63]. Here we choose the 350 °C as the reaction temperature to avoid significant thermal decomposition of the alcohols used and to have opportunity to compare the data obtained with those for SCW. The asphaltenes-to-alcohol ratio (w/w ≈ 0.032) was close to the asphaltenes-to-water ratio (w/w ≈ 0.038) used earlier for the SCW process [63]."
9,Quantitative assessment of the fractions,"3.1 Quantitative assessment of the fractions In each run, 3.00 g of the asphaltenes was treated by sc alcohol for 3 h at 350 °C. The same procedure was used for all alcohols to collect, separate and analyze the reaction products. All liquid and solid products were separated into five fractions; three of them were considered as the main ones: a hexane-soluble fraction (HSF), a benzene-soluble fraction (BSF) and an insoluble residue (IR) undissolved in hot n-hexane and benzene. The content of these fractions in the products is shown in Table 1 . The content of two additional fractions – alcohol-soluble fraction (ASF) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be also found in the Table 1. The ASF consists of the products that are soluble in the alcohol used at room temperature. The VOC fraction is composed of low-molecular-weight volatile organic compounds. To collect the VOC, the solution of the reaction products in alcohol was separated (decanted) from other solid products after cooling the reaction mixture down to the room temperature and opening the batch reactor. It is necessary to realize that only a small part of all products obtained after processing of the asphaltenes is soluble in the alcohol used. Distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture under atmospheric pressure removes the alcohol along with low-molecular-weight volatile organic compounds (some kind of azeotropic distillation). As a result, we get ASF as a residue after such distillation procedure and a solution of VOC in distilled alcohol. The latter solution was analyzed by GC–MS to evaluate the amount of the VOC. For all the VOC fractions the main chemical components were C 5–C 14 paraffins, alkylbenzenes (mostly mono- and disubstituted ones), dialkyl sulfides R–S–R, dialkyl disulfides R–S–S–R and alkyl mercaptans R–SH, where R is Me, Et, Pr or i-Pr depending on the alcohol type. The amount of the VOC for each of the alcohols was found to be negligible (Table 1), so we skip here the discussion of the chemical composition and amount of these fractions for simplicity. The ASF was combined with other solid products and redistributed between HSF, BSF and IR fractions via subsequent extraction procedure by hot n-hexane and benzene. Below the compositions of these three fractions of the products are discussed in detail. The total amount of all collected and extracted products ranged from ca. 93 to 98 wt% of initial asphaltenes (IA) (line “Total Σ”, Table 1). Uncontrolled loss of a small portion of the products predictably is going on through the entrainment of light volatile organic products (lower alkanes and olefins, light aromatic hydrocarbons) with alcohol during distilling-off procedure or drying the fractions under reduced pressure at elevated temperature. Moreover, a part of IA is lost as a gas fraction. As a result, the volume of the gas products in the reactor was ∼6.0 L for sc methanol, 1.4, 1.8 and 5.6 L for ethanol, 1-propanol and isopropanol, respectively. The gas fraction includes products of thermal destruction of the alcohols: methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene and dialkyl ethers (∼70–90%) as well as the small amount of CO, CO2 and SO2. The content of sulfur dioxide was noticeably higher in case of methanol and isopropanol as compared with ethanol and 1-propanol. The residue insoluble neither in hot n-hexane nor in benzene (IR) was always the major fraction of the products for all alcohols used. The amount of IR for different alcohols used can be lined up as follows: IREtOH (68 wt%) < IRPrOH (72 wt%) < IR i -PrOH (76 wt%) < IRMeOH (81 wt%) (Table 1). Thus, the highest conversion of IA was observed for sc ethanol. Processing of the asphaltenes by sc methanol gave the highest amount of IR. The sum of the hexane-soluble and the benzene-soluble fractions on the contrary decreases in the line: PrOH (25 wt%) ≥ EtOH (24 wt%) > i-PrOH (21 wt%) > MeOH (13 wt%). It is interesting to compare the data we got for the alcohols with those obtained under SCW conditions. The amount of IR formed from the same asphaltenes after processing by supercritical water at 380 °C (Table 1, 49 wt% [63]) was about 1.4 times lower than as compared with ethanol. The amounts of HSF and BSF formed after processing by supercritical water were significantly higher as compared with those obtained after the processing by sc alcohols. The HSF-to-BSF ratio obtained for SCW was about 1.8 [63]. The same parameter for sc alcohols is much higher and changes in the line: PrOH (4.8) > MeOH (3.5) > EtOH (3.1) > i-PrOH (2.6). Thus, the relative as well as absolute amount of BSF decreases noticeably after the processing of asphaltenes by sc alcohols. It means that the asphaltene molecules undergo rather a chemical modification accompanied by incorporation of structural fragments of alcohol molecules into them, but not a fragmentation into smaller molecules that are highly soluble in hexane or benzene as one can see for SCW. The incorporation of alcohol molecules into asphaltenes corroborates the fact that the amount of HSF increases from 10 up to 21 wt% in a line MeOH – EtOH – PrOH for homologous primary alcohols. Indeed, the sc alcohol can break the asphaltenes into smaller molecules with simultaneous alkylation or/and alkoxylation of the last ones. The alkylation or alkoxylation can also take place without breaking of the asphaltene molecules as a result of direct interaction of alcohol with the aromatic core of the asphaltenes through nucleophilic or free-radical aromatic substitution. If the similar mechanism of the reactions is realized and the reactivity of alcohols is close to each other, the molecular weight of the products obtained will correlate with the molecular weight of alcohol used. Indeed the molecular weights of alkyl or alkoxy groups of different alcohols relate as CH3/C2H5/C3H7 = 1:1.9:2.9 and OCH3/OC2H5/OC3H7 = 1:1.5:1.9. So the “heavier” alcohol will result in the “heavier” products and for instance higher reactivity of methanol does not necessarily lead to a larger amount of hexane-soluble fraction in comparison with propanol processing. This assumption is verified via elemental analysis (see below). It is interesting to compare the amount of alcohol-soluble fraction (ASF) as well as ASF-to-(HSF + BSF) ratio (α) for different sc alcohols. The amount of ASF in the products decreases in the line: PrOH (23 wt%, α = 0.90) > i-PrOH (17 wt%, α = 0.80) > EtOH (11 wt%, α = 0.46) > MeOH (9 wt%, α = 0.74) and correlates with the lipophilicity (the solvation power towards lipophilic products) and the molecular weight of the alcohol used. The ASF-to-“HSF + BSF” ratio (α) has the similar behavior with one exception for ethanol that distinguishes it from all other alcohols used."
10,Elemental CHNSO content of the fractions,"3.2 Elemental CHNSO content of the fractions The chemical composition of the products can be found in the Tables 2 and 3. The carbon content of the product fractions changes in the line: IR > HSF ≈ IA > BSF for all alcohols used, with the exception for methanol (IR > IA ≈ BSF > HSF), but varies within a small range of values (80–83 wt%) comparable with the carbon content of initial asphaltenes (81 wt%). Moreover, the carbon content of hexane- and benzene-soluble fractions is very similar to that obtained for SCW (Table 2). The main difference between the elemental composition of the product fractions for all alcohols concerns H, N, S and O elements (Tables 2, 3). The hydrogen content decreases in the line: HSF > BSF > IA > IR that differs from the carbon content. As expected, the hydrogen content of the hexane- and benzene-soluble fractions obtained after processing of asphaltenes by sc alcohols (10.0–10.7 and ∼8.6 wt%, correspondingly) is significantly higher than hydrogen content of IA (7.1 wt%). The enrichment of HSF and BSF with hydrogen can be originated from: (1) the alkylation/alkoxylation reactions with alcohol; (2) a stronger solute–solvent interaction between the more hydrogenated/alkylated products and n-hexane/benzene; (3) the decrease of nitrogen and sulfur content of HSF and BSF fractions; (4) hydrogen transfer reaction involving the alcohols. To elucidate the reaction pathway which takes place during the transformation of petroleum asphaltenes in supercritical alcohols it is necessary analyze and recognize the attributes of all possible reactions. The hydrogen content of benzene-soluble fraction obtained after processing in SCW is lower as compared with the sc alcohols. On the other hand, the hexane-soluble fraction obtained after processing of asphaltenes by SCW has higher hydrogen content as compared with the same fractions got after sc alcohols. The alcohol molecules have no nitrogen or sulfur atoms. Therefore nitrogen and sulfur identified in the products definitely originates from IA. The nitrogen and sulfur content differs much for different product fractions and decreases in the line: IA > IR > HSF > BSF and IA > IR > BSF > HSF for nitrogen and sulfur atoms, respectively, for all alcohols used (Table 2) with one exception for sc methanol. One can find (Table 2) that the total content of nitrogen and sulfur in all product fractions reduces noticeably to 67–69 wt% and 77–82 wt%, respectively, relative to the initial asphaltenes. It is a very important result, which is necessary to pay attention. It appeared that sc alcohols at 350 °C is more effective media for denitrogenation and desulfurization of asphaltenes as compared with SCW at 380 °C. In the latter case, the total content of nitrogen and sulfur reduces respectively to 75 wt% and 80 wt% relative to the initial asphaltenes. In sc alcohols low-molecular-weight sulfur compounds like dialkyl sulfides (R–S–R), dialkyl disulfides (R–S–S–R) and alkyl mercaptans R–SH are formed from asphaltenes and alcohols and collected as a VOC fraction. Thus, the sulfur atoms leaves the asphaltene molecules in the reduced, but not oxidized state – in the form of sulfonyl R–SO2–R or sulfinyl R–SO–R derivatives. Taking into account the chemical composition of sulfur-containing compounds in the VOC fractions, it may be concluded that residual sulfur atoms in molecules of IR and BSF products are a part of “hard-to-extract” or “hard-to-recover” sulfur-containing functionalities like substituted benzothiophenes or sulfonyl group which are highly stable under sc alcohol conditions. In contrast to sulfur, GC–MS method did not reveal any nitrogen-containing organic compounds in the reaction mixtures. The decrease of the nitrogen content after sc alcohol treatment is not associated with the decomposition of some aromatic azaheterocycles like pyrrole, indole, indazole, and benzimidazole which can be a part of asphaltene molecules. The azaheterocycles are known to undergo C- and/or N-methylation reactions by supercritical methanol at 350 °C [29,30,65], but not direct denitrogenation. We believe the reductive elimination of nitrogen from the IA as N2 or NH3 molecules takes place in sc alcohols. The generalization similar to sulfur-containing compounds can be made on the residual nitrogen content in all products: nitrogen-containing functionalities which are chemically stable under sc alcohol conditions can be a part of azaheteroaromatics. The important information about chemical transformations of IA can be obtained analyzing the oxygen content of HSF, BSF and IR (Tables 2, 3). The oxygen content of the products decreases in the line HSF > BSF > IA > IR for all alcohols used with one exception for sc 1-propanol. The oxygen content of HSF and BSF (2.8–3.2 and 3.1–3.7 wt%, correspondingly) is considerably higher than the oxygen content of IA (2.1 wt%). The sc methanol gives the highest (4.4%) oxygen content of hexane-soluble fraction (HSF). The oxygen content of IR (1.6–1.8 wt%) obtained for all alcohols used is lower as compared with that for the initial asphaltenes (IA). It implies that a noticeable part of oxygen-containing functionalities of IA molecules are localized in alkyl side chains, but not in the polycyclic aromatic core like aryl ethers (Ar–OAlk): our recently published ATR–FTIR data [62] demonstrated that a band at ∼1260 cm−1 attributed to the C arom O bond of the aromatic ethers Ar–OAlk not observed in the initial asphaltenes is registered only in BSF products. Therefore, the bond is newly-formed. As the C Alk O bond of dialkyl ethers AlkO–Alk does not give high-intensity band in the ATR–FTIR spectra. The alkoxylated products and aryl ethers were identified analyzing the variation of oxygen content of the fractions. The abovementioned alkyl side chains can be easily eliminated from the aromatic core of asphaltene molecules as a result of thermal decomposition (thermolysis), dealkylation, transalkylation by alcohol or β-scission reactions etc. So, the alkoxylation reaction has a notable impact on the chemical transformations of the asphaltenes resulted in incorporation of alkoxy substituents into the product molecules, mainly as an aromatic ether group Ar–OAlk [62]. In this case, the products are enriched by O, C, and H elements as compared with IA. The relative enrichment by the elements differs from each other. For alkoxy groups OCH3, OC2H5, and OC3H7, the O-to-C, H-to-O and H-to-C weight ratios are 1.33:0.67:0.44, 0.19:0.31:0.44, and 0.25:0.21:0.20, respectively. It means that the O-to-C and H-to-O ratios are more informative to identify the alkoxylation reaction. The ratios of “Total O”-to-“Total C” (β) and “Total H”-to-“Total O” (γ) of all recovered products collected after sc alcohols treatment of the asphaltenes were (see Table 2): β = 1.011 and γ = 0.939 for sc MeOH; β = 1.044 and γ = 0.970 for sc EtOH; β = 0.926 and γ = 1.113 for sc PrOH; β = 0.938 and γ = 1.075 for sc i-PrOH. For both sc MeOH and sc EtOH, the values of β > 1 and γ < 1 confirm unambiguously that the alkoxylation reaction takes place increasing the relative oxygen content of the products. For these alcohols, the alkoxylation reaction dominates the alkylation process and is the most pronounced in sc MeOH. It is difficult to provide the same identification of the alkoxylation products after sc PrOH and sc i-PrOH treatment: the opposite values of β < 1 and γ > 1 indicate decreasing the relative oxygen content of the recovered products. The alkylation reaction dominating the alkoxylation process can reasonably explain this result: the recovered products are enriched by C and H elements due to new alkyl substituents C3H7 and have lower content of total O relative to IA. It is interesting that the vanadium and nickel contents of organic products in both IA and IR remain almost the same after the processing of asphaltenes by sc alcohols (Table 3)."
11,Van Krevelen diagrams,"3.3 Van Krevelen diagrams It is interesting to compare the total content of the main element found in each fraction (lines “Total Σ” in Table 2) relative to its content in IA taken as 100%. Such elemental analysis is better to discuss in terms of a van Krevelen diagram by plotting H/C atomic ratio versus O/C or some other similar values. The different types (classes) of organic compounds characterized by particular H/C, S/C, N/C or O/C values can be identified in the van Krevelen diagram [66–68]. These diagrams are widely used to analyze and interpret NMR [69,70] and high-resolution MS [1,71–73] data and provides a useful tool for the characterization of coals, heavy crude oils, kerogens, natural organics (including humic acids) and associated products via convenient visualization of their chemical composition. Van Krevelen diagram can facilitate the recognition of specific molecular transformations or trends in conversion of heavy oil fractions including asphaltenes [74] which are the essence of the ongoing chemical processes. In particular the diagram can reveal some specific reaction routes including alkyl chain elongation, oxidation, reduction, hydration or condensation [71]. The diagrams give us a clear understanding of the changes in the chemical composition of asphaltenes during their transformation in sc alcohols. The chart points corresponding to insoluble residues (IR) obtained in different sc alcohols are concentrated within a small region of the diagram that indicates their similar chemical compositions. So the alcohol used for the asphaltenes upgrading do not incorporate into polycyclic aromatic products of IA dealkylation and has no effect on the chemical composition of IR. It corroborates the conventional fact that polynuclear aromatic compounds hardly undergo any alkylation or alkoxylation reactions by alcohols. As a result, the elemental compositions of different insoluble products are similar to each other. The dependence of H/C ratio on the content of heteroatoms has the same feature. The decrease of the H/C ratio is always accompanied by the decrease of the relative content of heteroatoms – oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen. The heteroatoms are usually located in alkyl side chains, which can be easily eliminated from the aromatic core during the upgrading of asphaltenes. Moreover, the diagrams clearly visualize the difference between hexane- (HSF) and benzene-soluble (BSF) products obtained in sc methanol as compared with the same product fractions obtained in other alcohols (Fig. 3 a). In case of sc methanol, the products have more oxygen due to the methoxylation reaction. So, the methanol is a more reactive alkoxylating agent than the other alcohols. Unexpectedly, all BSF products obtained in different alcohols have very similar H/C ratios, i.e. alcohols do not change the hydrogen content of the benzene-soluble fractions relative to the carbon. On the other hand, the different alcohols have the different effect on the content of O, S and N heteroatoms in the BSF products. For example, methanol slightly reduces the nitrogen content (Fig. 3c), but leads to the considerable decrease of the sulfur content of the BSF products as compared with initial asphaltenes (Fig. 3b). It is necessary to give some more explanations concerning the composition of BSF products and insoluble residue (IR). As the initial asphaltenes are benzene-soluble compounds, it is quite reasonable to suggest that the BSF consists of unchanged asphaltenes. However, the elemental analysis (see Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 3) together with ATR–FTIR and NMR spectra data [62] detect reliably the marked difference between IA and BSF. For example, the H/C ratio of all BSFs is higher than of IA (1.26–1.28 vs 1.04, respectively, see Table 3), whereas the C arom-to-C aliph ratio is 1.3–2.1 times lower than of IA [62]. So, BSF is mainly products resulted from chemical transformation of IA. There is a considerable difference between the composition of insoluble residue (IR) and a coke (carbonaceous deposits) which could be formed from the initial asphaltenes during the high-temperature process. The coke formation from IA as a result of condensation reactions is a reasonable assumption. But more detailed analysis of experimental data disproves it: condensation reactions are not significant pathway to the formation of IR products. The crucial detail is the C content of IR that is similar to those of IA (81.3–83.1 wt% vs 81.1 wt%, correspondingly, see Table 3). The comparison of the C content with hydrogen and other heteroatom ones points to the absence of considerable elemental difference between IR and IA (see Table 2 and Fig. 3). The possible carbon rejection process does not also take place on a considerable scale considering no loss of carbon content in all products (see Table 2). It means the insoluble residues are not “equal” to a coke (carbonaceous deposits) formed usually at similar (∼350 °C) or higher temperature during condensation and rearrangement processes. Additionally the ATR–FTIR data [62] show that the aromatics-to-aliphatics ratios observed for the insoluble residues are 2–3 times higher than those for the initial asphaltenes. The dealkylation process seems to be a preferable pathway to explain the data obtained, but not condensation reactions. Alkoxylation reaction of aromatic core of the asphaltene molecules by alcohols (leading to the increase of the oxygen content) decreases the solubility of such products in benzene which finally are found within insoluble residue. HSF are the most sensitive to the type of the alcohol used. The chemical composition of HSF products varies within a wide range of H/C, S/C, N/C or O/C values. This is one of the most important conclusions that can be made analyzing the van Krevelen diagrams. Also the HSF and BSF products got after upgrading of asphaltenes by sc isopropanol (2-propanol) are much more denitrogenated as compared with other alcohols used (Fig. 3c)."
12,Chromatographic analysis of sulfur-containing compounds,"3.4 Chromatographic analysis of sulfur-containing compounds The chromatographic method [75] was used to identify the compounds present in HSF product obtained in sc methanol. A gas chromatograph Chromos GC-1000 equipped with FPD and FID detectors allowed us to detect sulfur-containing compounds and hydrocarbons simultaneously. The GC–MS method traditionally is used to monitor the sulfur-containing compounds in oil derivatives for example in straight-run gas oil (SRGO) and light cycle oil (FCC LCO) and allows one to identify alkyl derivatives of benzothiophene or dibenzothiophene [75,76], especially tri- and tetraalkyl substituted benzothiophene [75]. The GC profiles of volatile compounds of HSF are shown in Fig. 4 . It appeared that the hexane-soluble fraction contains a noticeable amount of light sulfur-containing compounds having the retention time up to 8 min (Fig. 4a). The main sulfur-containing compounds are dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3) and dimethyl disulfide (CH3SSCH3) that is in accordance to the other data obtained. The formation of the products is the result of three consecutive reactions, namely, reductive desulfurization of the asphaltenes by methanol (removal of sulfur as H2S molecule), step-by-step methylation of H2S by methanol to methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide, and, finally, the formation of dimethyl disulfide from methyl mercaptan. Other sulfur-containing compounds presented in the HSF product after processing in sc methanol are “heavier” as compared with those of the SRGO and the FCC LCO fractions (see Fig. 4) and likely presented as alkyl derivatives of both dibenzothiophene and naphthothiophene [76]. One can see some similar features of chromatographic profiles of the SRGO and the HSF obtained after sc methanol. For example, the total amount of sulfur is comparable with that of the SRGO and somewhat higher than in case of the FCC LCO. Additionally, chromatographic profiles of sulfur-containing compounds of the SRGO and the HSFMeOH are rather similar. According to chromatographic analysis of hydrocarbons of the SRGO, FCC LCO and HSFMeOH (Fig. 4b), the characteristic peaks of homologous n-paraffins (or homologous and isomeric iso- or cycloparaffins [77]) are observed for both the SRGO and the HSFMeOH. At the same time, the amount of volatile homologous compounds of the SRGO was found to be more than one order of magnitude higher than that for the HSFMeOH. It means that the most products from the HSFMeOH are not volatile under the chromatographic conditions. The paraffinic compounds of the HSFMeOH detected chromatographically are “heavier” relatively to the SRGO as they have a higher retention time. Apparently, most of the sulfur-containing products are non-volatile, too, and cannot be detected by GC method. So, the real amount of sulfur-containing compounds in HSFMeOH is one order of magnitude higher than presented in Fig. 4a."
13,Conclusions,"It was shown that supercritical alcohols are able to remove heteroatoms (S and N) and increase the H/C ratio of the products that makes them promising candidates for heavy oil upgrading processes. In the present study, the asphaltenes with high content of sulfur (7.8 wt%), nitrogen (2.3 wt%) and oxygen (2.1 wt%) were upgraded by sc alcohols at 350 °C in a batch-type reactor. Four aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1- and 2-propanol) were selected as supercritical media working as a hydrotreating or hydrorefining agent. The operating pressure was varied from 112 up to 242 atm. The detailed elemental and GC analysis of the products has been conducted to elucidate the chemical role of each sc alcohol in the upgrading of asphaltenes. The conversion of the IA in sc alcohols as well as the content of the main elements in all product fractions was tested for each alcohol in comparison with that obtained after sc water processing. The main routes of the asphaltene transformations in sc alcohols were identified and characterized. It was shown that the processing of the asphaltenes in sc alcohols decreases the total nitrogen content by one-third and total sulphur content by one-fifth as compared with the initial asphaltenes. The sulfur leaves the asphaltene molecules in reduced form like dialkyl sulfide or dialkyl disulfide compounds. It was found that the insoluble residue (IR) is the main fraction of the products characterized by higher aromaticity of its chemical compounds, low H/C ratios, and the reduced aliphatics content. The relative carbon content of the product are similar for all fractions whereas the H content of HSF and BSF increases significantly (up to 40–50%) due to the incorporation of alcohol in the product molecules. The similar alkylation and alkoxylation reaction is the reason of the increase of the oxygen content of HSF and BSF, especially in the supercritical methanol. Alcohols as supercritical media have no crucial effect on chemical composition of IR and H/C ratio of benzene soluble (BSF) products, but do have significant influence on the chemical composition of hexane soluble (HSF) products. Chromatographic profiles of volatile hydrocarbons and sulfur-containing compounds of HSFMeOH and regular diesel fraction (SRGO) look very similar but the HSFMeOH products have higher molecular weight as compared with the SRGO compounds. The study of the interaction of alcohol molecules at elevated temperatures and pressures with various fragments of the asphaltenes is the crucial step in the development of advanced upgrading process of asphaltenes using sc alcohols."
