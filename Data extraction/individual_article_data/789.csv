0,Introduction,"The increase in energy demand and the huge growth in fossil fuel consumption has raised serious environmental issues, such as loss of biodiversity, global warming, climate change, and air pollution. These undesired trends have urged extensive research activities directed towards the development of new, sustainable energy sources using green technologies. During the past decades, the interest in hydrogen as a fuel source has increased, due to its high gravimetric energy density, clean-burning qualities, the possibility of production from renewable sources, the possibility of delivering or storing a large amount of energy, etc. [1]. Currently, water-gas shift reactions and steam methane reforming are the common technologies of hydrogen production, whose main disincentives are high energy demand, large greenhouse gas emission and significant cost [2]. Over the last few years, photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting or alcohol reforming has been recognised as a promising approach for clean hydrogen energy generation [3–6]. Among the wide range of candidate photocatalysts [7,8], TiO2 has attracted the greatest interest, due to its suitable conduction and valence band alignment, low cost, nontoxicity, and stability against photo-corrosion [9,10]. Given its favourable properties, numerous ongoing studies are directed towards the development of novel nanostructured titania-based materials, with well-controlled surface and morphological properties and improved photocatalytic efficiency, in order to achieve the desired level of practical efficiency [11]. One-dimensional (1-D) titanate nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention as potential photocatalysts, due to their favourable physicochemical properties (high specific surface area, narrow size distribution, small tube diameter, high surface charge density, fast ion diffusion, and enhanced light absorption) [12,13]. Owing to their unique morphology, as well as to excellent ion-exchange/intercalation activities, 1-D titanate materials have found application in various fields, such as catalysis, including photo-driven catalytic reactions, Li-ion batteries, dye-sensitised solar cells, etc. [11,14]. In particular, titanate nanotubes (NTs) with a hollow structure have attracted special attention as catalysts, due to their high specific surface area (200–400 m2 g−1), open mesoporous structure, nanometre-sized internal tube diameter (3–10 nm), and consequently large pore volume. After the first successful synthesis of titanate nanotubes by Kasuga et al. [15,16], the hydrothermal method has been widely used for the fabrication of 1-D titanate nanomaterials of various morphologies, such as nanotubes [17,18], nanowires [19], nanofibers [20], and nanoribbons [21]. Although the preparation method is quite simple, every single step in its production, including choice of TiO2 precursor [18,22,23], type and concentration of the alkaline solution [24], conditions of hydrothermal treatment [25–27], post-acid washing and thermal treatment [28] can significantly affect the structure and morphological features of the final titanate nanomaterial. In order to be useful for hydrogen production via water splitting, a photocatalyst must possess a conduction band minimum that is more negative than the reduction potential of water [29]. Although TiO2-based materials satisfy this essential criterion, they exhibit low efficiency for photocatalytic hydrogen production in their pristine form, due to fast electron–hole recombination and high overpotential for hydrogen production. To improve the hydrogen production efficiency, titania and titanate nanostructures have been modified by different approaches. The deposition of metal nanoparticles with high work function on the TiO2 surface through photo-deposition, precipitation, or ion-exchange methods, has proved to be an effective strategy in facilitating hydrogen evolution. Noble metals such as Pt [30,31], Pd [32], Ag [33], and Au [34,35], have been found to be efficient co-catalysts, with a reported hydrogen production rate as high as 20–40 mmol g−1 h−1 in alcohol/water systems. The enhanced activity of doped catalysts is related to the high work functions of the deposited metals (Pd 5.6 eV, Pt 5.7 eV, and Au 5.3–5.6 eV) and their abilities to form effective Schottky contacts with TiO2 [36], thus increasing the charge separation in TiO2 and, consequently, the number of charge carriers available for photoreactions. Recently, efforts have been made to replace noble metal co-catalysts by less expensive and more abundant transition metals [37] and metal oxides [38,39] that exhibit comparable or even, in some cases, superior activity compared to noble-metal-titania-based systems [40,41]. Among them, nickel has been recognised as an excellent substitute for noble metals, due to its low cost, high abundance and high work function (5.3 eV) [36]. TiO2 doped with nickel in various forms (NiO [42], metallic Ni [43,44], Ni(OH)2 [45], Ni/NiO core/shell structure [46]) has been the subject of recent studies dealing with hydrogen production from water/alcohol systems. In the present study, Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts were synthesised via different preparation routes. The activity and stability of synthesised catalysts towards photocatalytic hydrogen production were evaluated. The goal of our study was to understand better how variables such as functional properties of the support, mainly phase composition and textural and morphological features induced by thermal reduction treatment and precipitation method, contribute to the improvement of the activity and stability of the prepared catalysts."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate, glycerol, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and 2-propanol were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were of analytical grade quality and used without further purification. Commercially available TiO2 was kindly supplied by Evonik Degussa GmbH (Aeroxide TiO2 P25, 70% anatase 30% rutile, surface area 52 m2 g−1, mean particle diameter approximately 30 nm)."
3,Synthesis of hydrogen titanate nanotubes,"2.2 Synthesis of hydrogen titanate nanotubes Hydrogen titanate nanotubes (H-TiNTs) were prepared by hydrothermal reaction of commercial TiO2 in NaOH solution, followed by ion-exchange with dilute HCl solution at room temperature, as described by Kasuga et al. [15]. The preparation was initiated by treating 2 g of the P25 TiO2 powder with 250 mL of 10 M NaOH in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 24 h. The resulting sodium titanate precipitate was separated by filtration and then redispersed in 100 mL 0.1 M HCl under continuous stirring for 24 h in order to facilitate the ion-exchange reaction between sodium and hydrogen ions. The final product was separated by filtration and dried at 110 °C for 3 h."
4,Synthesis of Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts,"2.3 Synthesis of Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts Titanate/titania catalysts modified with 1 wt % Ni were synthesised using a deposition/precipitation method. Briefly, 50 mg of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 45 mg of glycerol were added to 20 mL of distilled water to form an aqueous nickel(II)–glycerol complex. Then, 1 g of H-TiNT was dispersed in this solution. Two sets of catalysts were prepared: the first where the Ni complex was precipitated by dropwise addition of 0.5 M NaOH, and the second where 1.0 M Na2CO3 was used as a precipitation agent. The catalysts synthesised by the carbonate precipitation method were prepared without the addition of glycerol. The suspensions were stirred for 1 h, filtered by vacuum filtration and the obtained light green powders, Ni(OH)2/TiNT (hydroxide precipitation method) and Ni2(OH)2CO3/TiNT (carbonate precipitation method) were dried overnight at 70 °C. Finally, titanate/titania catalysts modified with Ni were obtained by reduction of adsorbed Ni(II) species to the metallic form using temperature-programmed reduction process under H2/Ar flow (5% of H2 in H2/Ar mixture, 20 mL min−1 flow rate) at different temperatures (400, 500, and 650 °C) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The catalysts prepared using NaOH as precipitating agent were labelled as NiT-x, while those prepared using Na2CO3 were labelled as NiTC-x, where x corresponds to the reduction temperature."
5,Characterisation of unmodified and Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts,"2.4 Characterisation of unmodified and Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were obtained using Thermo Finningen TPRDO 1100 apparatus, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) coupled to a MS detector (Thermo Star GSD320). Prior to the reduction, the sample (∼50 mg) was pre-treated in flowing Ar stream at 110 °C for 60 min. Reduction profiles were obtained in the temperature range of 50–1000 °C (heating rate of 10 °C min−1) under H2/Ar flow (5% of H2 in H2/Ar mixture, 20 mL min−1 flow rate). The total amount of consumed hydrogen (μmol g−1) was calculated by integrating the area under the obtained reduction peak. In addition, mass spectrometry signals at m/z 18, 28, and 44 were recorded to detect the masses of H2O, CO, and CO2 molecules, respectively. The surface composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG ESCALAB II electron spectrometer under a base pressure of 1 × 10−8 Pa. The photoelectron spectra were excited using un-monochromatised Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) with a total instrumental resolution of 1 eV. The C1s line of adventitious carbon at 285 eV was used as an internal standard to calibrate the binding energies. The photoelectron spectra were corrected by subtracting a Shirley-type background and were quantified using the peak area and Scofield's photo-ionisation cross-sections. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns were recorded using a Rigaku SmartLab instrument under Cu Kα1,2 radiation. The intensity of diffraction was measured with continuous scanning at 2° min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 2010F-FasTEM with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared by drop-casting an alcoholic solution of samples onto 200 mesh formvar carbon copper or lacey carbon copper grids. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined on a Sorptomatic 1990 Thermo Finnigan automatic system using nitrogen physisorption at −196 °C. Before measurement, the samples were degassed at 30 °C for 3 h. The specific surface area of the samples was calculated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms according to the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method. Pore-size distributions were calculated from the desorption branch of the corresponding nitrogen isotherm, applying the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method. Optical properties of samples were studied in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 1.3 μm by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements (Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–Vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere ISR-2600 Plus)."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen production test,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production test Photocatalytic hydrogen production over unmodified and Ni-modified catalysts was performed under simulated solar light irradiation in 2-propanol/water solution. Photocatalytic tests were carried out in the photocatalytic reactor (ACE glass), equipped with standard reaction flask, quartz immersion well and 100 W mercury lamp. The cooling of the reaction mixture to 25 °C was performed using a JULABO F25 circulation thermostat. First, 125 mg of the sample was suspended in 250 mL of 2-propanol/water mixture (1.0 vol % of 2-propanol) and transferred to the reaction vessel. Oxygen was removed from suspension with Ar flow for 30 min, and prior to illumination the Ar flow was adjusted to 15 mL min−1. During illumination, the effluent gas was analysed every 15 min by gas chromatography (Perkin Elmer F33 GC with a TCD) to quantify the production of H2. A calibration curve was obtained by performing an analysis of samples with a known amount of H2 in the H2/Ar mixture."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Formation mechanism and characterisation of Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts,"3.1 Formation mechanism and characterisation of Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts TPR/MS analysis was performed to study the reducibility of hydroxide and carbonate nickel precursors and to determine the type and amount of reducible species present in the samples. Fig. 1 shows that both precursors display broad asymmetric reduction profiles in the temperature range 180–900 °C. In order to gain deeper insights into the reducible species, the obtained reduction profiles were deconvoluted into four peaks. The low-temperature peak, marked as a cross-hatched section, was attributed to the reduction of Ni(II) species. For the hydroxide precursor, the peak is centred at 450 °C, while for the carbonate precursor the peak is centred at 500 °C. It is essential to note that the reduction peak of the hydroxide precursor is shifted to lower temperature, indicating a more facile reduction of the hydroxide precursor compared to its carbonate counterpart. Although not being of central importance for this study, the peaks corresponding to the reduction of species other than Ni(II) were also identified [47,48]. Briefly, the second peak, centred at ∼540 °C, can be attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction, leading to the formation of CO, as evidenced by mass spectroscopy. As expected, higher intensities of CO and CO2 signals were obtained during the reduction of carbonate precursor. The remaining two high-temperature peaks were assigned to the dehydroxylation and consequent reduction of Ti4+ cations to Ti3+, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies [49]. Based on the observed TPR profiles, temperatures of 400, 500, and 650 °C were chosen for the reduction of the nickel precursors. Temperatures of 500 and 650 °C were suitable to ensure complete reduction of Ni(II) species, while 400 °C was chosen as the predicted maximum temperature for maintaining the nanotubular structure. Besides analysis of catalyst precursor reducibility, TPR was also used for catalyst preparation, through reduction of nickel species and calcination at a predetermined temperature. The amount of hydrogen consumed for the reduction of nickel precursors (Ni(II)→Ni(0)) was calculated by integration of the peak area of the signal during the reduction, and the obtained data are summarised in Table 1 . Taking into account the amount of hydrogen required for complete reduction of the Ni precursor and the experimentally determined amounts of hydrogen consumption, the content of reduced Ni-phase upon reduction process was determined. Inspection of the obtained values revealed a lower content of reduced nickel within samples reduced at 400 °C (0.1 and 0.2 wt % for NiTC-400, and NiT-400, respectively). On the other hand, the temperatures of 500 and 650 °C were found to be sufficient to ensure complete reduction of nickel species, resulting in samples (NiT-500, NiTC-500 and NiT-650) with metallic nickel content close to their theoretical value (1 wt %). Fig. 2 a shows a typical XRD pattern of the starting material – unmodified titanate nanotubes (H-TiNTs) with main peaks at 24, 28, 43 and 48°. The exact structure of titanate nanotubes is still under debate. So far, multiple titania/titanate phases, including anatase TiO2 [15], hydrated and non-hydrated analogous of monoclinic H2Ti3O7 [50], monoclinic H2Ti4O9 [51,52] orthorhombic H2Ti2O5·H2O [53], and lepidocrocite-type titanate H0xTi2-x/4vx/4O4 (where x ˜ 0.7 and v represents vacancy) [54,55] have been proposed to represent the crystal structure of the nanotubes. The proposed crystal structures have some features in common: they consist of layers of (1 0 0) planes consisting of edge- and corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra building up zigzag or flat layered structures with exchangeable hydrogen atoms situated between the layers [56]. A more detailed insight into the exact crystal structure of titanate nanotubes could be attained from the products obtained after thermal treatment [57]. Based on the results presented further below, we assigned the initial nanotube structure to the monoclinic tetratitanate (H2Ti4O9·H2O) with lattice dimensions a = 1.877, b = 0.375, and c = 1.162 nm (JCPDS: 00-063-0655). Further, the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase and rutile phases of starting TiO2 P25 were not detected in XRD spectra, indicating complete transformation of the titania to hydrogen titanate structure after the hydrothermal treatment. The TEM data of synthesised H-TiNTs revealed a multilayer tube-like structure with a length of several hundreds of nanometres, and external and inner diameters of 21 and 6.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 a and b). The distance between the adjacent layers was found to be 1.04 nm, somewhat greater in comparison to values reported in the literature [27,58,59]. According to EDX analysis, H-TiNTs consisted only of titanium and oxygen, indicating complete ion-exchange of the intercalated sodium ions by hydrogen ions (Fig. S1a, Supporting Information). The elemental composition of unmodified H-TiNTs is shown in Table 1. The synthesised H-TiNTs were characterised further by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. 4 a). According to IUPAC classification, the isotherm belongs to type IV, typical of mesoporous materials, with an H3 hysteresis loop, characteristic of aggregates or agglomerates of particles forming slit-shaped pores with non-uniform size and/or shape [60]. The BJH method was further employed to analyse the pore-size distributions, and the results are presented in Fig. 4b. The obtained pore-size distribution curve, calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm, shows an average pore diameter of about 13 nm. The textural properties, including BET surface area, average pore size, and total pore volume are summarised in Table 1. Ni-modified titania/titanate catalysts were obtained by reduction of Ni(OH)2 and Ni2(OH)2CO3 on H-TiNT supports at different temperatures (400, 500, and 650 °C) and characterised using the same techniques as for unmodified H-TiNTs. XRD patterns of NiT-400 and NiTC-400 are presented in Fig. 2a. No significant differences between the XRD pattern of H-TNTs and catalysts synthesised at 400 °C were observed. However, despite their coincident peak positions, the diffraction patterns of catalysts reduced at 400 °C exhibited a strengthening of the peak at 2θ ˜ 28° relative to that at 2θ ˜ 24°, which can be ascribed to the increase in the Na+/H+ ratio as a result of ion-exchange [61]. Considering that protons were not completely exchanged by sodium ions, the NaxH2-xTi4O9 structure has been proposed for the titanate nanotubes calcined at 400 °C. The absence of XRD peaks corresponding to metallic Ni suggests that its content was below the XRD detection limit. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of both catalysts prepared at 400 °C belong to type IV in the IUPAC classification and show an H3 hysteresis loop, the same type as that obtained for the H-TiNT sample (Fig. 4a). Both samples (NiT-400 and NiTC-400) had the same average pore diameter of about 15 nm, slightly larger than that determined for H-TiNTs (13 nm). The samples NiT-400 and NiTC-400 exhibited similar specific surface areas of 201 and 188 m2 g−1, respectively. A small decrease in specific surface area compared to that determined for H-TiNTs (283 m2 g−1) can be related to the loss of their microporous structure. However, the remaining high specific surface area, almost unchanged pore diameter and mesoporous volume strongly indicate a non-collapsed nanotube structure for the samples thermally treated at 400 °C. Significant changes in crystal structure were observed upon thermal treatment at 500 °C (Fig. 2b). The XRD patterns of NiT-500 and NiTC-500 indicated the coexistence of two crystal phases (anatase and Na0.8Ti4O8). The diffraction peaks at 25.1, 37.2, 47.9, 53.8, and 54.9° correspond to (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), and (2 1 1) lattice planes of the anatase crystal phase, respectively. On the other hand, the diffraction peaks at 14.1, 15.0, 24.3, 28.7, 29.4, 32.7, 43.7, 44.4, and 47.3° belong to (0 1 –1), (1 –1 0), (1 2 2), (0 2 –2), (2 –1 –1), (0 2 3), (0 3 –3), (3 –2 –1), and (3 3 4) lattice planes of Na0.8Ti4O8, respectively (JCPDS #73–1400). It should be noted that the XRD peaks of anatase and Na0.8Ti4O8 are intense and sharp, indicating a good crystallinity of the samples reduced at 500 °C. In addition, the XRD analysis of thermally treated samples provided valuable information concerning the structure of the starting H-TiNT. Since thermal treatment induced the formation of sodium tetratitanate (Na0.8Ti4O8) phase, the orthorhombic hydrogen tetratitanate structure (H2Ti4O8·H2O) was assigned to initial titanate nanotubes. The proposed explanation of phase transformation is as follows: Anatase phase is formed from hydrogen titanate during calcination at 500 °C. Although a number of authors proposed that this phase transformation occurs through an intermediate metastable TiO2(B) phase, this phase was not detected in XRD spectra [62–64]. According to the proposed mechanism [65], the appearance of TiO2(B) phase depends on the morphology of the titanate nanostructure, which results in their different structural stability upon thermal treatment. Due to the weak structural stability of the nanotubes and their fast dehydration, the transformation is either not occurring via intermediate TiO2(B) phase or the intermediate TiO2(B) phase is short-lived and therefore difficult to detect. The second obtained phase, Na x H2-x Ti4O8, is thermally unstable and susceptible to phase transformation at temperatures above 400 °C. The thermal treatment at 500 °C leads to dehydration of interlayered –OH groups from the titanate nanostructure, while sodium ions remain intercalated between octahedral layers, directing the formation of Na0.8Ti4O8 nanoribbons. The obtained results are consistent with the reported literature findings [66,67]. The increase in the reduction temperature from 400 to 500 °C also induced significant morphological changes. According to representative TEM images of NiT-500 (Fig. 3c and d) and NiTC-500 (Fig. 3e and f), calcination at 500 °C led to deterioration of the nanotube morphology. The presented figures show the formation of a mixture of ribbon-like particles and particles with irregularly shaped morphology, decorated with nanosized metallic Ni particles (Fig. 3c and e for NiT-500 and NiTC-500, respectively). The high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3d) reveals that the nanoribbons have basically a layered structure with a layer spacing of 0.596 nm. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of sodium in NiT-500 and NiTC-500 samples, indicating that hydrogen ions were being partially replaced by sodium ions during the catalyst preparation (Figs. S1b and c, Supporting Information). The average content of titanium and sodium elements in samples is presented in Table 1. It is established in the literature that the presence of sodium ions in the resulting titanate is an important stabilising factor that influences the phase transformation and morphology of the materials during thermal treatment [50,57,65]. Further transformation of the nanotube structure with calcination temperature was reflected through the observed variations in textural properties. It can be observed that an increase in temperature from 400 to 500 °C was followed by changes in the profiles of the adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 4a). The NiT-500 and NiTC-500 catalysts display type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loops, characteristic of aggregates or agglomerates of spheroidal particles with uniform pore size and shape [60]. As a consequence, a significant decrease in specific surface area was observed for both samples. The loss of nanotubular morphology upon thermal treatment at 500 °C led to the reduction of pore volume and an increase in average pore diameter (∼70 nm) attributed to the inter-particle porosity (Fig. 4b and Table 1). The XPS analysis of NiT-500 and NiTC-500 samples was performed in order to obtain deeper insight into the electronic properties of the surface elements. The signals of Na, Ti, O, and Ni are present in the survey XPS spectra (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). High-resolution XPS spectra of Ti, O, and Ni, shown in Fig. 5 , are almost identical for both samples. The characteristic peaks of Ti2p at 458.3 and 464 eV (Fig. 5a) were assigned to the tetravalent oxidation state of the titanium atom (Ti4+). The absence of the Ti2p3/2 feature at ∼457 eV indicates that there was no formation of Ti3+ surface defects by reduction of Ti4+ under the applied reduction conditions. The core level O1s peak is observed at 529.7 eV and was assigned to oxygen bound to the Ti4+ ions in the oxide lattice (Fig. 5b). The oxidation state of the nickel species can be accessed from the binding energy of the Ni2p3/2 electrons (852.6 eV and 853.7–854.9 eV for Ni(0) and Ni(II), respectively [68]). The high-resolution spectra of Ni2p3/2 show the peak with binding energy of 855.5 eV with a broad satellite at 861 eV [69,70] characteristic of Ni(II) and the low-intensity peak at 852.1 eV characteristic of Ni(0) species (Fig. 5c). The presence of surface Ni(II) species in NiT-500 and NiTC-500 samples is more likely the consequence of partial oxidation of metallic nickel during sample transfer before XPS measurement than of incomplete reduction under the applied experimental conditions. To quantify the amount of NiO formed, we performed repeated TPR of already reduced samples, that were subsequently exposed to air for 1 h, which simulates the conditions that actually occurred before the photocatalytic tests. The results revealed that the amount of hydrogen consumed for the reduction of these samples is ∼20% of the amount of hydrogen required for the complete reduction of the Ni precursors in non-reduced samples. It can be revealed that 20% of total metallic Ni amount was converted to NiO, after being exposed to air. The obtained results, joined with the results of XPS analysis, indicate the existence of core/shell structure model where core metal is coated by active thin NiO shell. TEM results could give us indication that the size of metallic Ni particles is not larger than 30 nm, leading to the size of formed NiO layer of ∼2 nm. Since metallic Ni is coated by 2 nm thick layer of NiO, the XPS spectra showed low-intensity peak characteristic for metallic Ni, while the main peak originated from NiO. The increase in temperature to 650 °C induced further changes in morphological, textural and structural properties. According to the obtained XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), the increase in temperature to 650 °C led to an increase in Na0.8Ti4O8 phase content at the expense of anatase phase. This effect can be explained by enhanced dehydration of –OH groups at a higher temperature that promotes binding of intercalated sodium ions to TiO6 octahedral structures in the titanate. The proposed mechanism is supported by EDAX measurements that indicate a higher Na/Ti ratio compared to that of samples reduced at 500 °C (Table 1, Fig. S1d, Supporting Information). The TEM analysis shows that the morphology of NiT-650 catalyst is similar to the morphology of NiT-500 and NiTC-500 samples with the additional deterioration of the nanotubular structure; a representative TEM image of NiT-650 is presented in Figs. S3a and b in Supporting Information. The additional decrease in the specific surface area and reduction in pore volume was also observed after temperature increase to 650 °C (Table 1)."
9,Photocatalytic hydrogen production over titanate/titania catalysts modified with Ni,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production over titanate/titania catalysts modified with Ni Photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of H-TiNTs and Ni-modified titanate/titania catalysts (NiT-400, NiTC-400, NiT-500, NiTC-500, and NiT-650) was evaluated under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of 2-propanol as a sacrificial agent. It is well known that 2-propanol can be easily oxidised by photogenerated holes, thus suppressing electron–hole recombination [71]. In addition, electron injection from the (CH3)2ĊOH radical to the conduction band of the titanate/titania nanostructure occurs due to the large negative potential of the (CH3)2ĊOH radical (−1.23 eV versus NHE [72]), doubling the yield of electrons. The performed preliminary tests demonstrated no appreciable H2 production in the absence of either irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that the major H2 production was driven by photocatalytic reaction. Time-dependent rates of photocatalytic hydrogen production over the studied catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 . As evidenced from the obtained results the unmodified H-TiNT exhibited low activity in hydrogen production. Although this reaction is thermodynamically possible, bearing in mind the relative positions of the conduction band of H-TiNT and the reduction potential of hydrogen, the catalyst showed negligible activity due to the high overpotential for H2 evolution and fast electron–hole recombination rate. The observed low activities of H-TiNT are in accordance with the literature data, showing that hydrothermally synthesised titanate is inactive in photocatalytic hydrogen production [73] and in the degradation of organic pollutants [57,74]. The presence of metallic nickel deposited on the surface of the synthesised catalysts dramatically improved efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production compared to the unmodified ones. Even the catalyst with a small content of metallic Ni (0.2 wt %), NiT-400, exhibited up to 10 times higher photocatalytic activity compared to unmodified ones. According to the conventional explanations, the metallic Ni lowers the overpotential for hydrogen evolution and suppresses electron–hole recombination, acting as an electron sink [75]. The results also revealed a significant difference in catalytic activity with variation of calcination temperature. The NiT-500 photocatalyst, prepared at a calcination temperature of 500 °C from hydroxide precursor, exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate (1042 μmol h−1 g−1). Despite the fact that NiT-500 has a significantly smaller specific surface area (53 m2 g−1) compared to NiT-400 (201 m2 g−1), the catalyst was found to exhibit 2.5 times higher hydrogen production activity (Table 2 ). This higher activity can be explained by the presence of a highly photocatalytically active anatase crystal phase that exceeds the activity of the less active titanate structure, as well as improved crystallinity. Similar observations have been reported by other studies, which found the increased photocatalytic performance of titanate nanotubes invoked by crystal phase transformation [76]. Additionally, the influence of a higher content of deposited Ni (1.0 wt %) and improved light harvesting ability due to absorption in the visible and near infra-red spectral region (Fig. S4, Supporting Information) on the photocatalytic efficiency of NiT-500 cannot be ruled out. A further increase in reduction temperature led to decreased catalytic activity. The modest hydrogen production activity of the NiT-650 catalyst was caused by the transformation of active anatase phase to sodium titanate phase, i.e., a loss of anatase structure (Fig. 2b), pore structure deterioration (Fig. 4b) and consequently decreased available BET surface area (Table 1). A strong effect of precursor type, i.e., the precipitation agent used, on the characteristics of the prepared catalysts is reflected through pronounced differences in their photocatalytic activities (Fig. 6). As evidenced by the results obtained, the samples prepared at 400 °C (NiT-400 and NiTC-400) exhibited similar photocatalytic activity at longer irradiation times (>1 h). The samples displayed lower activity than NiT-500, but higher than NiTC-500. The observed higher hydrogen production rates of NiT-400 and NiTC-400 samples compared to NiTC-500 can be explained by their significantly larger specific surfaces (201 and 188 m2 g−1, respectively). However, the importance of the anatase phase in the photocatalytic process can be discerned from the maximal hydrogen production rates normalised to the specific surface area (Table 2). For example, this value is over 2.5 times higher for NiTC-500 (6.74 μmol h−1 m−2) than the corresponding values obtained for NiT-400 and NiTC-400 catalysts (2.01 and 2.66 μmol h−1 m−2). On the other hand, clear differences in photoactivity between the catalysts reduced at 500 °C were observed. The sample prepared from hydroxide precursor (NiT-500) exhibited remarkably higher activity compared to its carbonate counterpart (NiTC-500). The better performance of NiT-500 cannot fully be explained by its higher specific surface area. As evidenced from Table 2, maximal hydrogen production rate normalised to the specific surface area is higher for hydroxide-origin catalysts, suggesting that additional catalyst properties, other than surface area, have a prominent effect on catalyst performance. According to the obtained XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), NiT-500 catalyst contains a higher amount of anatase phase compared to its carbonate counterpart, NiTC-500, implying the dominance of anatase phase in determining catalyst performance. In the context of photocatalytic water splitting applications, long-term catalyst stability is an important milestone for achieving high hydrogen production efficiency and long-term performance. For the purpose of studying catalyst stability through a continuous reaction system, it is more appropriate to gain information about catalyst stability from performed activity tests than to perform additional recycling tests. The results presented in Fig. 6 indicate that upon reaching the maximum rate (t ˜ 40 min), the hydrogen production rate fell over varying times, depending on the applied catalyst. Since photocatalytic hydrogen production is carried out through a continuous reaction system, a stable catalyst is expected to exhibit a constant rate of hydrogen production whereas any perceivable change in hydrogen production after reaching the steady-state reflects a reduction in catalyst activity. In the context of this study, the hydrogen production rate, R (μmol h−1 g−1) is normalised to the maximal hydrogen production rate, Rmax (μmol h−1 g−1) (Fig. 7 a) to quantify the activity drop. The most scientifically sound methodology for comparison of catalyst stability involves comparing the performance of catalysts at equal conversion levels rather than reaction times. Therefore, the reduction in catalyst activities was compared for the same amount of hydrogen evolved. In the next step, the cumulative hydrogen evolution curves (Fig. 7b) were generated by integrating the curves in Fig. 6. It should be noted that after dead time of 40 min, an almost linear dependence of evolved hydrogen versus time exists for all catalysts. For the sake of clarity, only two values of evolved hydrogen were selected (0.5 mmol g−1 and 1.0 mmol g−1) and the required time for their production was determined. The obtained values of production times have been used further to read off the values of R/Rmax from Fig. 7a. The stability of the catalysts NiT-400, NiTC-400, NiT-500, and NiTC-500, defined as the ratio between hydrogen production rate observed at the reaction time when predetermined production of hydrogen is achieved (Rt) and maximal hydrogen production rate (Rmax), is presented in Fig. 7c. The unmodified H-TiNT and NiT-650 were discarded from further analysis due to the low hydrogen production yield. The obtained results revealed that the catalyst stability is strongly influenced by the catalyst preparation temperature; the catalysts reduced at 400 °C exhibited higher stability compared to the stability of those reduced at 500 °C. Furthermore, carbonate-origin catalysts showed lower stability compared to their hydroxide counterparts. Thus, the greatest drop in activity was observed for NiTC-500, while NiT-400 possessed the highest stability among the investigated samples. The observed results undoubtedly indicate the importance of preservation of the nanotubular structure for increased stability of the catalysts after thermal treatment."
10,Conclusions,"Nickel-modified catalysts were prepared by deposition/precipitation of nickel ions onto titanate supports using hydroxide or carbonate precipitation agents, followed by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. The temperatures of 500 and 650 °C were found to be suitable reduction temperatures to ensure complete reduction of Ni(II) species, while 400 °C was the maximum temperature for maintaining their nanotubular structure. The nickel hydroxide precursor showed more facile reducibility compared to its carbonate counterpart. The catalysts preserved a mesoporous titanate structure with nanotube morphology up to 400 °C, with high specific surface area and unchanged pore diameter. The increase in temperature above 400 °C resulted in deterioration of nanotubular morphology with a significant reduction in specific surface area, loss of mesoporous structure and transformation of titanate into anatase and sodium titanate phases. The catalyst reduced at 500 °C using hydroxide precipitating agent displayed the highest photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen production. The better performance of the hydroxide catalyst compared to its carbonate counterpart was attributed to its higher specific surface area and higher content of anatase phase. On the other hand, both carbonate and hydroxide catalysts reduced at 400 °C, with high surface area and titanate phase structure, displayed similar photoactivity. The trade-off between the specific surface area and the presence of the anatase phase governs the optimisation of synthetic parameters that lead to an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production. The catalysts reduced at 400 °C displayed higher stability compared to those reduced at 500 °C, highlighting the prominent influence of the retention of a nanotubular structure on catalyst stability."
