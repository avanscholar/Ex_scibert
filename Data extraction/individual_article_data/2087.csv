0,Introduction,"The demand for liquid fuels from renewable resources for transportation has been increasing due to the diminution of fossil fuels [1]. Moreover, to address environmental issues, products from reusable/waste plastic material have started gaining the interest of both industry and society, Worldwide plastic production exceeded 3 million tonnes in 2010, up from around 4 million in 2018. By 2025, plastic production will reach 5 million tonnes [2]. The handling of these plastics was a major environmental problem around the world. Advantageously, these plastic wastes can be used for the production of energy using thermochemical conversion methods [3]. For selecting a better thermal conversion process it is necessary to know its fundamental basis physiochemical properties of feedstock [4]. There are many advantages of thermochemical liquefaction processes and it is a promising technology for converting raw materials into liquid biofuels, for example by converting wet feedstocks directly into bio-oil or crude bio-oil to avoid consuming more energy during drying or pretreatment. [5]. Secondly, higher energy recovery efficiency and lower biofuel production energy consumption rate [6]. None of these benefits have been achieved in the pyrolysis and gasification techniques. Bio-oil also has certain disadvantages such as high moisture content, coking, high viscosity, complex composition and corrosivity [7]. Biomass includes cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. The use of biomass is a favorable approach to produce biofuels with high quality in one step [1,8]. Lower hydrogen content and higher carbon content in biomass lead to a better carbon ratio (H/Ceff) [3]. Approximately 540 Mt of sugar cane processes overall world per annum and it was calculated that about 280 kg of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) can be formed per tonnes of processed sugarcane [9]. The Australian sugar mill approximately produces bagasse 11 Mt per annum; however, some quantity of sugarcane bagasse is burned on-site to produce heat and electricity. [10]. A small proportion of sugarcane bagasse is used as a source of energy for the boilers. Due to waste management problems at the plant site, it is not fully used as a fuel source for the plant. In addition, direct burning in the boiler can form particulate matter in the air, which is dangerous for health [11]. Bagasse can produce several types of fuels, including liquid fuels (such as biodiesel), gaseous fuels (hydrogen and methane), fishermen's pesos, diesel, bioethanol and synthetic oils [12] and solids such as hydrochar or bio-char [13,14]. As a result, these agricultural residues have great potential for the production of chemicals and biofuels through thermo-chemical routes which includes liquefaction and pyrolysis [15]. Due to issues of waste management at the plant site, pollution source of the plant. [11]. Co-processing conversion of hydrogen-rich plastics with oxygen-rich biomass is a better way to achieve advanced bio-oils through synergistic interactions between polymer intermediates and biomass [16]. It has been stated that bio-oil production by co-feeding plastics and biomass can reduce coke formation [3]. Polyethylene can increase the yield of bio-oil when co-processed with cellulosic material in the presence of ZSM-5 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor [17]. Co-liquefaction is an efficient process for collecting hydrogen, carbon, and redistributing other elements (such as nitrogen and oxygen in other products (water-based and gas-based products) [18]. Therefore, co-liquefaction is a feasible and simple process for production of liquid hydrocarbons from a mixture of plastic waste and lignocellulosic materials [19]. Solvo-thermochemical co-liquefaction is the most effective method to transform biomass into various chemicals and superior quality crude bio-oil [20,21]. Furthermore, solvo/hydrothermal liquefaction method is promising for wet feedstocks since drying of the feedstock is not compulsory [6], hence making the process cost effective [22]. Besides this bio-oil produced by liquefaction, it has higher heating properties than the bio-oil pyrolysis, it is attributed because it is not water soluble and contains less moisture content [23]. In solvo-thermal liquefaction process, the solvent plays an important role in the conversion, yield and properties of the products [24,25]. For instance, the solvo-thermal liquefaction of biomass carried out in the presence of organic solvents which produces important functional groups during the process [26]. Furthermore, the polyethylene is combined with biomass or other sources, to improve the properties and quality of bio-oil during the co-liquefaction process. [27]. The main aim of mixing plastics with biomass is to improve the quality of bio-oil plastics are hydrogen rich and serve as a assess H-donor during the co-liquefaction process. There were many studies reported for co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics which determined that the co-pyrolysis has a positive synergistic effect on properties as well as bio-oil yield [28,29]. It was stated that the co-liquefaction of birch wood sawdust and waste activated sludge produced high viscosity and high molecular weight bio-oil compared to the liquefaction of sawdust alone [30]. Solvo/hydrothermal co-liquefaction is performed at a relatively low temperature ranging from 220−370 °C under high pressure of 4−33 MPa [31–33]. There are different products that can be obtained from this process such as bio-oil solid residue, aqueous and gaseous phase, however other by-products such as solid, aqueous and gaseous are also obtained [34,35]. Leng et al. [36] studied co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and sawdust with sewage sludge by using ethanol solvent as a reaction medium. It was found that the bio-oil yield increased during the co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse with sewage sludge. An increment in bio-oil yield in co-liquefaction process is attributed due to the co-liquefaction process obstructs the gas and water formation whereas it stimulates the interaction between free radicals and intermediate products, resulting in bio-oil increment [37,38]. There are only a few studies reported on co-processing of plastic waste and biomass. Jakab et al. [39] reported co-pyrolysis of different biomasses including cellulose, flour, lignin, wood, and charcoal with polypropylene. In previous research, it was concluded that co-pyrolysis of various types of wood biomass with synthetic polymer improved the yield and quality of bio-oil [40]. Yuan et al. [41] studied hydrothermal co-liquefaction of rice straw with high density polyethylene and found that the bio-oil yield increased by increasing the high density polyethylene content. In another previous study investigated the solvothermal co-liquefaction of high density polyethylene with microalgae and found that the bio-oil obtained from co-liquefaction had higher carbon and hydrogen contents and higher HHV and having less oxygen content [42]. The main aim of this study, is to understand the importance in exploring real-world studies on bio-oil production from plastic waste through co-processing using thermochemical liquefaction process using different catalysts were discussed. The obtained bio-oils and chars were characterized using CHNS/O, Fourier Transform-Infrared (FTIR), NMR, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), XRF and SEM analysis."
1,Material and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sugarcane bagasse and were purchased from Oreco group Australia and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and catalysts (CuSO4, FeSO4, ZnSO4, Al2O3) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without any further treatment and purification. Throughout the experiment, all chemical reagents were available in analytical grade and were used without further purification. The properties including proximate analyses and ultimate analysis of both materials are illustrated in Table 1 . Before the preparation of samples, the sugarcane bagasse was dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The uniform feedstock mixture was prepared by a combination of high density polyethylene sugarcane bagasse in a fixed ratio of 15–85 %."
3,Co-liquefaction apparatus and procedure,"2.2 Co-liquefaction apparatus and procedure All experiments were carried out in a 600 mL Parr reactor. In each run of the experiment, a sample contains polyethylene, dried bagasse, and catalyst (10 %) was added to the reactor with 300 mL of ethanol solvent. The catalytic co-liquefaction experiments were conducted at 280 °C reaction temperature, 75 min reaction time, 1:20 feedstock to solvent ratio, 15 % biomass to polyethylene and 300 rpm according to our previous study suggesting the optimum conditions for co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene via Taguchi method of design of experiments (DoE) [43]. However, the main focus of current study was to study the effect of different catalysts on total conversion, bio-oil yield and physico-chemical characteristic of bio-oil and char. The nitrogen gas was purged into the reactor that was heated to an operating temperature of 280 °C and held for 75 min while stirring the contents at 300 rpm. After that reactor was cooled to room temperature via cooling coil present in the reactor, the gaseous content was removed in a hood and the solid and liquid products were vacuum filtered through a Whatman filter to separate solid and liquid products as shown in) Fig. 1 (a–b). The detailed methodology for the separation of liquefied products is described elsewhere [44]. The following equations were used to calculate the conversion and yield: (1) (x %) = (1−mchar/mfeedstock) ×100 (2) Bio-oil yield wLi = (mbio-oil/mfeedstock) (3) Solid residue yield (%) wre = mre/mfeedstock×100 Where x (%) is conversion percentage of feedstock, wLi, and wre are the yield percentages of bio-oil, and char, respectively, mre is the weight of solid residue (g), mfeedstock is the weight of feedstock material (g), mbio-oil is the weight (g) of bio-oil."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods CHNS/O analysis of raw materials and products was performed using a CHNS / O 2400 Series II element analyzer (Perkin Elmer). The calorific value is calculated using the Boie formula, as shown in Eq. 1 [45]. (4) H H V M J K g = { 0.3516 * C + 1.1625 * H - 0.119 * O + 0.0628 * N The composition of chemical compounds of the bio-oil was achieved using PerkinElmer (Clarus 680) mass spectrometry gas chromatography (GC–MS). The carrier gas is helium, the division ratio is 1/40 and the flow rate is 20 mL/min. The separation was performed using an HP column (30 m x0.25 mm x5 μm). The operating temperature was set at 50 °C for 5 min and heated to 280 °C at 10 °C / min. In electronic ionization mode (70 eV), the scanning mass varies from 20 to 500 μ amu. The injection volume was 1 μL. The 1H and 13C were characterized by using Bruker 300 MHz Advance III spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm probe at 25 °C. Proton spectra were acquired with 32 or 128 scans with a spectral width of 14 ppm. DEPT135 spectra were recorded with 256 scans. Inverse gated 13C spectra were recorded using 7000 scans. The samples were analyzed in CDCl3 and were referenced to residual solvent peaks. The functional groups in the feedstock and product were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer (TA 8000)). Each sample was scanned 32 times from 4000 to 600 cm −1 with a resolution of 4 cm −1. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) was performed using a Pioneer Bruker S4 to determine the elemental composition of the solid residue. Scanning electron microscope (Philips XL30 SEM (Edwards High Vacuum, Sussex, England)) photographed at an operating voltage of 15 kV and with a spot size of 4.5-5 mm in high vacuum mode and captured at magnification distance of 10 mm."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of different catalysts on conversion and bio oil yield,"3.1 Effect of different catalysts on conversion and bio oil yield The effect of catalysts on biomass conversion and both positive and negative effects of catalysts on product efficiency were observed. Catalysts are chosen to increase the production performance and the physico-chemical properties of the products [46]. Therefore, in this study, the effect of various catalysts including CuSO4, FeSO, ZnSO4 and Al2O3 has been studied on total conversion and bio-oil yield percentage as discussed in Fig. 2 . Further, experiments were conducted without catalyst for comparing the results. It is observed that the CuSO4 generated the highest conversion rate of 69.54 % followed by FeSO, Al2O3, and ZnSO4 yielding a total conversion of 65.25 %, 63.85 %, and 63.45 % respectively. It can be concluded that all the catalysts helped to get a higher conversion rate as compared to the experiment without the catalyst. Moreover, the CuSO4 is the catalyst having a greater effect on total conversion than all other investigated catalyst whereas the ZnSO4 has the lowest effect of total catalysts on total conversion. Similarly, all the experiments with catalysts generated higher bio-oil yields than the experiment without the catalyst. Further, it was observed that the CuSO4 produced the highest bio-oil yield of 38.42 % followed by FeSO, ZnSO4, Al2O3, and blank yielding total conversion of 37.51 %, 37.19 %, 36.32 % and 32.33 %, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion and yield of bio-oil without catalysts were 60 % and 32.3 % respectively [47].Similar results for higher total conversion and higher bio-oil yield for the CuSO4 from catalytic liquefaction of sewage sludge were reported in the literature [48]. Although ZnSO4 showed lower conversion and yield than CuSO4, this behaviour confirmed that zinc salt possesses the potential for improving the liquefaction of both the sugarcane bagasse and HDPE in ethanol. Earlier study shows that ZnSO4 improved the total conversion. Similarly, all the experiments with catalysts generated higher bio-oil yields than the experiment without catalyst. Pua et al. [49] studied th catalytic solvolysis liquefaction of soda lignin in order to compare the gas and bio-oil yields and found that addition of ctalysts enahnced the bio-oil formation. An increase in bio-oil after catalytic processing of biomass is supported by a fact that he catalyst tend to promotes deoxygenation reactions [50]and disrupt the lignocelluosic structure of feedstocks by cracking [51] and hence generating more bio-oil. Further, it was observed that the CuSO4 produced the highest bio-oil yeild of 38.42 % followed by FeSO, ZnSO4, Al2O3, and blank yielding total conversion of 37.51 %, 37.19 %, 36.32 % and 32.33 %, respectively. Similar findings were reported in literature, where the CuSO4 generated the highest bio-oil yield from catalytic liquefaction of biomass as compared to blank, ZnSO4 and FeSO4 [52]. The FeSO4 was at second after CuSO4 in terms of bio-oil yield. A study utilized FeSO4 as a catalyst for liquefaction of sewage sludge and compard it with alakline catalysts and observed that the FeSO4 produced greater bio-oil yeild than all other catalysts [53]. Similarly, Xu et al. [54] studied catalytic liquefaction of biomass in presence of 5% FeSO4 as a catalyst and found that the bio-oil yield was improved from 44 % (in absence of FeSO4) to 63 % (in presence of 5% FeSO4). Therefore, it can be suggested that the CuSO4 is the best caltalyst as compared to others in order ti enhance the both total conversion and bio-oil yield from co-liqueafcation of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene. However, the conversion and yield of bio-oil without catalysts were 60 % and 32.3 %, respectively [47]. Similar results for higher total conversion and higher bio-oil yield for the CuSO4from catalytic liquefaction of sewage sludge were reported in the literature [48]. Although, ZnSO4 showed lower conversion and yield than CuSO4, this behaviour confirmed that zinc salt possess the potential for improving the liquefaction of both the sugarcane bagasse and HDPE in ethanol. It was reported in literature that ZnSO4 improved the total conversion and bio-oil yield from catalytic liquefaction of woody biomass in presence of various solvents [46]. Addition of FeSO also improved both bio-oil yield and total conversion compared to experiments without catalyst [47]. The literature suggested that FeSO improved the bio-oil yield during liquefaction of muncipil sewage sludge [48]. It is suggested that these differences may be attributed to the solvent environment and different characteristics of feedstock."
7,FTIR analysis of feedstock and bio-oil products,"3.2 FTIR analysis of feedstock and bio-oil products The FTIR analysis was carried out at FTIR spectra at 4000−550 cm−1 for determining the functional groups present on the surface of samples, and molecular structure and existing bonds of specific compounds [55]. The FTIR spectra are similar for the bio-oils from the co-liquefaction of polyethylene and sugarcane bagasse with and without catalysts suggesting their similar structure and composition of bio-oils. The FTIR analysis of bio-oil without catalysts is presented in previous research [47] suggesting that bio-oil samples possess similar peaks except for few amendments in peaks. The FTIR analysis of raw sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane/HDPE, and bio-oil produced from catalytic co-liquefaction of sugarcane and HDPE in presence of different catalysts including ZnSO4, Al2O3, CuSO4, and FeSO4 is provided in Fig. 3 (a–b) Table 2 lists the possible functional groups and the assignments of peaks observed for sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane bagasse/HDPE and bio-oils. It can be observed from Fig. 3 (a) that the sugarcane/HDPE had few broadband peaks at 1070 cm−1, 3241 cm−1, whereas short peaks at 1600−1700 cm−1 and 2800 cm−1. The bio-oils produced from catalytic co-liquefaction in the presence of different catalysts showed similar peaks in all the regions except few changes in spectra. The peaks at 3642 cm−1 and 3733 cm−1 for CuSO4 bio-oil, 3636 cm−1 and 3781 cm−1 for FeSO4 bio-oil, 3548 cm−1 and 3703 cm−1 for ZnSO4bio-oil and 3647 cm-1 and 3838 cm-1 for Al2O3 bio-oil, which represent the OH functional groups. These peaks are related to the moisture content, phenols, alcohols and phenolic/alcoholic derivatives [55,56]. Some other peaks were found in the range of 2600–3100 cm-1, 2250−2400 cm−1, 1600−1900 cm−1, 1450−1600 cm−1, 1325−1450 cm−1, 1000−1325 cm−1, and 750−1000 cm−1, which show the assignments of C–H stretching, CO stretching, CO stretching, CO stretching and C–H blending.Hence, it can be suggested that possible compounds present in all samples were hydrocarbons, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, ketones, phenols, alcohols, and aromatics. The results are in good agreement with the findings of GCMS analysis."
8,Ultimate analysis of bio-oil products,"3.3 Ultimate analysis of bio-oil products The CHNS/O analysis tends to determine the compositions and amount of gas produced during combustion process and the quantity of oxygen needed for burning the fuel or biomass [57]. The main purpose of the liquefaction process is to decrease the oxygen content of biomass. It is suggested that the decarboxylation and dehydration are two main reactions, occurring during liquefaction, responsible to eliminate oxygen in the shape of carbon dioxide or water [46]. The ultimate analysis of bio-oils obtained the presence of catalysts is listed in Table 3 . The elemental composition of sugarcane comprises of 44.81 % carbon, 49.0 % oxygen, 5.80 % hydrogen, 0.20 % nitrogen and 0.10 % sulphur, whereas HDPE contained 85.53 % carbon, 14.22 % hydrogen and 0.25 % oxygen. It is observed that the co-liquefaction of polyethylene and sugarcane bagasse has improved the overall elemental properties of bio-oil products in the presence and absence of catalyst. While comparing the results of experiments conducted with and without catalysts, it is suggested that run without catalyst showed the lowest carbon value of 63.38 % [47], which increased to 63.75 %, 64.15 %, 65.68 % and 68.55 % in presence of ZnSO4, Al2O3, CuSO4, and FeSO4, respectively. Similarly, the hydrogen value of run without catalyst was 8.92 %, which improved to 10.23 %, 10.81 %, 10.85 % and 11.16 % in presence of ZnSO4, Al2O3, CuSO4, and FeSO4 catalysts, respectively. On the other hand, the amount of oxygen present in the blank experiment was 27.56 % [47], which decreased down to 20.10 %, 22.92 %, 24.67 % and 25.52 % with FeSO4, CuSO4, Al2O3, and ZnSO4 catalysts, respectively. It can be seen that the catalysts played a positive role on overall performance of improving the elemental analysis of the bio-oil in terms of decreasing the oxygen content and increasing the carbon and hydrogen values which is attributed to the decarboxylation and dehydration reactions taking place during catalytic liquefaction. It has been shown previously that the catalysts play an important role in development of bio-oil quality by developing deoxygenation reactions [46]. It is suggested that the catalysts together with deoxygenating reactions (decarbonylation, dehydration and decarboxylation) during liquefaction process tend to release the volatile matters, resulting in the formation of chemical compounds with new molecular structure [31]."
9,HHV of bio-oil products,"3.4 HHV of bio-oil products The HHV value of bio-oil product with and without a catalyst is shown and compared to those of pyrolysis bio-oil, bio-ethanol, bio-diesel, diesel and gasoline in Fig. 4 . Bio-oil produced by catalytic liquefaction in the presence of the ZnSO4 catalyst had the highest HHV value of all other catalysts. The HHV value of the bio-oil produced in absence of catalyst was 29.51 MJ/kg, which increased to 31.17 MJ/kg for CuSO4, 32.08 MJ/kg for Al2O3, 32.92 MJ/kg for FeSO4, and 34.61 MJ/kg for ZnSO4. Higher HHV values of bio-oil in the presence of catalyst than that of the bio-oil produced without catalyst is attributed to higher carbon and lower oxygen values of the bio-oils produced. This is consistent with previous literature that shows a linear dependence of HHV on carbon content. It was reported in the literature that the bio-oils had high carbon and lower oxygen value, hence the bio-oils has higher HHV values than raw material [46]. Nizamuddin et al. [58] correlated the HHV value to carbon content and found that the HHV is directly proportional to the carbon content. Fig. 4 shows, that all bio-oil produced either with catalysts or without catalysts had higher HHV value than pyrolysis oil and bio-ethanol, but are lower than those for gasoline, diesel and bio-diesel. This behaviour of HHV values obtained in this study may be related to relative water concentration and the oxygenated compounds, which affect the calorific value and combustion characteristics of biomass significantly [59]. The existence of these oxygenated compounds or aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oils limits the direct application of bio-oil in turbines and engines [60,61]. To overcome such shortcomings and to enhance their applicability, the bio-oils are upgraded by various upgrading techniques, one of which is to use bifunctional or metallic catalysts in hydrotreating method which will result in the formation of naphtha-like products which can be used as high quality fuel additives [62,63]."
10,GC–MS analysis of bio-oil,"3.5 GC–MS analysis of bio-oil GC–MS analysis was carried out for bio-oils produced to determine the major chemical compounds. The changes taking place in quantified molecular components of bio-crude by adding different catalysts including FeSO4, CuSO4, Al2O3, and ZnSO4 is presented in Fig. 5 . It is evident from Fig. 5 that the compounds identified for bio-oil in the presence and absence of catalysts include phenols, alcohols, aldehydes/ketones, hydrocarbons, esters, acids and other compounds. The bio-oil produced from liquefaction of sawdust produced comparable compounds [70]. All the bio-oils contained higher percentages of hydrocarbons, phenols, esters and aldehyde/ketones and percentage of alcohols, acids and other compounds. It is observed that the bio-oil produced in absence of catalyst contained the highest amount of phenols, followed by hydrocarbons, esters, ketones/aldehydes, acid and other compounds, and alcohols. Among bio-oils produced in presence of different catalysts, the bio-oil produced in presence of FeSO4 and ZnSO4 had the highest percentage of hydrocarbons followed by aldehydes/ketones, phenols, acids and other compounds, alcohols and esters. The bio-oil of CuSO4and Al2O3 contained the greatest percentage of phenols followed by hydrocarbons, ketones/aldehyde, alcohols, acids and other compounds and esters. The presence of phenols in bio-oils may be correlated to the hydrolysis of lignin of sugarcane bagasse [71]. During liquefaction of biomass, decomposition of lignin forms 2-methoxy-phenols, which is degraded to 1,2-benzendiol and this 1,2-benzendiol is hydrolyzed to phenols during liquefaction [72]. It was suggested that ether bonds existing in lignin get hydrolyzed easily even at low process parameters and these ether bonds get transformed into phenolic compounds during decomposition of lignin [72]. Singh et al. [73] suggested that decomposition of nitrogen-containing compounds of carbohydrates and proteins resulted in the development of ketones and phenols. On the other hand, the degradation of cellulosic and hemicellulosic bonds of the feedstock results in the formation of aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and esters [74]. It is suggested that the ketones are unstable to afford the thermal conditions during the liquefaction process, hence they get converted into alcohols and acids [75]. The presence of hydrocarbons compounds may be attributed due to the breaking of polymers chain the co liquefaction process. This explains the synergistic effect observed in the co-liquefaction of the biomass/plastic mixture. According to Sharypov et al. the olefinic products from aPP (atactic-polypropylene) thermal conversion react with some products from cellulose and beech depolymerization [76]."
11,1H and 13C NMR analysis of bio-oils,"3.6 1H and 13C NMR analysis of bio-oils The spectra for 1HNMR and 13CNMR for bio-oils obtained from catalytic coliquefaction of HDPE/sugarcane bagasse is shown in Fig. 6 (a–b) It is reported that the 1HNMR spectra can be mainly categorized into three types depending upon their chemical shifts [71]. The regions of 6−9 ppm show aromatics, 4−6 ppm region shows the olefinic and 0.5−4 ppm represents the aliphatic compounds [77]. Fig. 6 (a) reseults shows that all bio-oils were mostly composed of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. The results are in good agreement with previous studies suggesting that bio-oil from liquefaction of biomass was rich in aromatic and aliphatic compounds [71,73]. It is observed that the non-catalytic was rich in alkanes (0.5–1.5 ppm) followed by alcohols (3–4.4 ppm), aliphatics (1.5−3 ppm), hetro-aromatics (6–8.5 ppm), and methoxy and carbohydrates (4.4−6 ppm) [47]. On the other hand, all the catalytic bio-oils were rich in alcohols and methylene dibenzene (3–4.4 ppm) followed by alkanes (0.5–1.5 ppm), aliphatics (1.5−3 ppm), hetero-aromatics (6–8.5 ppm), and methoxy and carbohydrates (4.4−6 ppm). It is confirmed from the literature that the bio-oil produced from coliquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene contains alcohols, alkanes, methoxy, aliphatics, aromatics and carbohydrates [71,78]. The 13CNMR spectra is shown in Fig. 6 (b) and it can be seen that all the samples showed significant regions of chemical shift indicating short aliphatics at 0−28 ppm range. According to Singh et al. [73], short aliphatic components occur in the region of 0−28 ppm of 13CNMR spectra. The region of 55−95 ppm was the second significant region observed for both non-catalytic and catalytic bio-oils, which shows the availability of carbohydrates, alcohols, ether, phenol and its derivatives. This region defines the carbon atom adjacent to oxygen and nitrogen atoms present in ethers, carbohydrates and alcohols [73,78]. Therefore, it is recommended that any significant chemical shift taking place in the region of 55−95 ppm is highly dependent on the overall trend of oxygen and nitrogen contents [79–81]. The regions of 28−55 ppm, 95−165 ppm and 165−180 ppm were not found viable for all the samples. The 28−55 ppm region belongs to long and branched aliphatics, 95−165 region refers to olefin and aromatic compounds, and 165−180 ppm region indicates the esters and carboxylic acids. It can be confirmed that all the bio-oil samples contained long, branched and short aliphatic compounds, phenolic methoxy compounds, carbohydrates, sugars and ethers. Similar compounds were reported in bio-oil produced from liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse [71]. It is stated that the aliphatic carbon atoms are considerably important for enhancing the energy content of bio-oils [74,82,83]"
12,XRF analysis of solid residue,"3.7 XRF analysis of solid residue The char was further analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF analyser) analysis revealed that solid residue mainly contains CuO, NiO, ZnO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3as shown in Table 4 . The detection of these metals recommends that the part of catalysts adsorbed or attached to the solid residue and were probably reacted with oxygen to produce metal oxides that were remained within the solid residue during the process. Furthermore the solid residue also contained metals such as Fe, Mg Ca, Zn, Cu, Al, which supports the proposed occurrence of char oxidation that led to formation of the metal oxides during the solvothermal processing. The concentration of Al, Zn, Cu and Fe were found relatively high as compared to other metals present. Few of these metals, such as Si, Al, Fe, Ni may have catalytic activity on the reaction pathways that occur in this process as reported by others in studies of other materials [84,85] and this could lead to a different product composition compared to that observed in previous works [86,87]. The large % metal oxides embedded on carbon indicates that the char can be reused as catalyst."
13,SEM analysis of chars,"3.8 SEM analysis of chars The SEM analysis was carried out for the char samples produced from non-catalytic and catalytic coliquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene in presence of FeSO4, CuSO4, Al2O3, and ZnSO4 catalysts as shown in Fig. 7 (a–f) SEM analysis helps to assess the structural and morphological changes taking place after processing of different feedstock materials. It can be evidenced from Fig. 7 that there were significantly visible morphological changes and alteration in char samples after both catalytic and non-catalytic co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse/HDPE. This morphological transformation of char suggests that the lignocellulosic structure of sugarcane bagasse was highly degraded resulting in creation of voids and pores on the surface.While comparing the catalytic and non-catalytic char, it can be witnessed that the non-catalytic char has a smooth surface and few small pores suggesting that the sample is not suitable for the proposed application of adsorbent. On the other hand, all the char samples produced with different catalysts showed significant improvement in porosity and experienced substantial morphological changes. This can be attributed to the process parameters, especially reaction temperature, which together with catalysts created more pores on the surface of char. It is confirmed that the reaction temperature causes significant decomposition of feedstocks resulting in exposure of basic layers of feed samples and enlargement of pores, subsequently enhancing the porosity [88,89]. Further, the more extensive morphological changes in catalytic char may be attributed to the higher carbon content of those char as compared to non-catalytic char (Table 5 ). Char with higher carbon content contains more cracks and holes due to the evolution of volatile matters [71]. It is reported higher volatile matter release produces high porosity and pore structure [88,90,91]."
14,Conclusion,"In this work the effect of catalysts on efficient conversion yield of high density polyethylene HDPE and sugarcane bagasse via solvothermal liquefaction were studied. The highest liquefaction conversion (69.54 %) and bio-oil yield (38.42 %) were both obtained by adding CuSO4. ZnSO4 gives a higher heating value. GC–MS identified that most compounds in bio-oil were hydrocarbons, phenols, aldehyde ketones, alcohols and esters. Sugarcane bagasse and HDPE liquefied in ethanol with ZnSO4 catalyst could be a potential way for converting sugarcane bagasse and HDPE into comparable fuel to the biodiesel like fuel. The higher amount of metal oxides in the char indicates that the char can be reused as a catalyst."
