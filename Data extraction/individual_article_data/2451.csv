0,Introduction,"Lead (Pb) is a heavy metal that has a variety of adverse effects on human health due to its toxicity. Excessive intake of Pb may lead to severe damage to the nervous system and human organs [1]. It is also associated with several cancers such as kidneys, lungs, and brain [2]. Therefore, the determination and monitoring of Pb in water have become necessary. For years, traditional techniques have been developing to determine Pb accurately and precisely, including atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) [3], inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) [4]. These methods can be very sensitive and selective in various sample matrixes; however, they require high-end and large instrumentation, a long detection period, and highly-trained technicians. Recently, colorimetric methods for Pb detection, via visual color change or a UV–vis spectrometer, have been intensively studied thanks to low-cost, naked-eye, and on-site detection [5–7]. Nevertheless, these methods still have many drawbacks such as requirements of ligands, time-consuming process for color formation, lack of photostability, and biocompatibility. On the other hand, electrochemical methods for the determination of heavy metals can provide an accurate and precise detection with simple and inexpensive instruments, eco-friendly and in-field detection [8]. They include, for example, differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV), square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) [9,10]. For years, many theoretical investigations and practical experiments were performed to find suitable materials to improve the electrochemical performance of electrodes. Traditional electrodes for voltammetric detection were often based on hanging drop mercury electrode (HDME) or mercury film electrode (MFE) [11,12]. These electrodes have the advantages of high sensitivity and reproducibility. Nevertheless, due to the toxicity of mercury, great efforts have been made to develop mercury-free electrodes. There are many mercury-free electrodes with and without surface modification reported for Pb(II) detection via ASV, including platinum [13], gold [14,15], silver [16], bismuth [17,18], and carbon [19,20]. Platinum- and gold-based materials have been widely studied for electrochemical electrodes because of their excellent electrocatalytic activities [13,21]. Nevertheless, they suffer from low overpotential to hydrogen that limits their cathodic potential window. Besides, the metal oxide formation on the surface often results in high background noise. It has been proposed that bismuth-based electrodes can offer sensitive detection of Pb thanks to their ability to form a fusible alloy, less toxicity, high hydrogen overpotential [17]. However, bismuth electrodes suffer from low chemical stability because they are easily oxidized in the presence of air. Moreover, the choice of the electrolyte solution and its pH is also a challenge to achieve reproducible results due to the risk of hydrolysis and Pb-Bi alloy formation. Recently, silver- and copper-based electrodes have attracted some interest in the electrochemical detection of lead [22–24]. Silver ring electrode was reported to obtain a detection limit of 0.042 ppb Pb [22]. The copper-based electrochemical sensor can obtain a detection limit of 4.4 ppb Pb with negligible interference of Cd and Zn [23]. Nevertheless, the application of the silver and copper electrodes may not be reliable because silver and copper are easily oxidized and this can affect the electrochemical performance and the lifetime of the sensors. Besides, ceramic-based electrodes have been also received great attention for voltammetric detection of Pb. Several studies have been reported with promising results such as carbon nitride electrode [25], Si nanowires electrode [26], magnesium silicate electrode [27], functionalized mesoporous silica electrode [28], tetrabutylammonium-modified clay film electrode [29]. Over the last decade, graphene has attracted widespread interest in the electrochemistry field including sensors, batteries, and capacitors. Graphene – a two-dimensional (2-D) layer with sp2-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice structure – has been massively studied owing to its large specific surface area, unique electronic and transport properties, mechanical and chemical stability [30,31]. In addition, the successful dispersion of graphene has allowed the construction of many useful graphene-based electrodes. Graphene can be mixed with some polymers in a suitable solution to form a stable dispersion and create new types of electrically conductive nanocomposites. Polymers, for example, Chitosan [32,33], Nafion [34–36], polyaniline [37,38], poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [39], can improve electrode stability, active surface area, and resistance to interferences. In this paper, we report a new polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan-thermally reduced graphene modified glassy carbon electrode (PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE) for determination of lead in aqueous samples at trace level via square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). The novel concept for choosing the sensing composite material is based on the following aspects: (i) The unique properties of graphene can provide extraordinary electronic, electrochemical, and mechanical properties, and large surface area [30,31]. The excellent electronic conductivity is beneficial in increasing the electron transfer pathway for electrochemical reactions during the detection. The large surface area is favorable for increasing the surface loading of the target analyte. Compared with carbon nanotubes, graphene can be produced easily in large quantities via thermal reduction of exfoliated sheets of oxidized graphite. This method is effective, low-cost, and eco-friendly. The obtained graphene normally has residual functionalized groups (e.g., epoxide, hydroxyl) which enable it to disperse effectively in hydrophilic polymers [40,41]. (ii) Chitosan is a non-toxic, inexpensive, and biodegradable polymer containing amino and hydroxyl groups [42]. These groups can serve as active sites in the adsorption process of Pb. They also play an important role in film formation, enhancing resistance to interfering anion and bulky compounds for the electrode. However, the drawback of chitosan is poor chemical resistance and mechanical strength. Previously, chitosan blended with PVA was reported to have good mechanical and chemical properties [43]. These enhanced properties are probably ascribed to the interaction between PVA and chitosan via hydrophobic side-chain and intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds [44]. Although PVA is soluble in water, chitosan blended with PVA is insoluble in both acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the adsorption capability of the PVA/chitosan blend is superior to native chitosan [43,45]. Taking into account the merits listed above, it is reasonable to expect that a combination of TRG and PVA/chitosan blend can offer a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easy-to-use composite sensor for electrochemical detection of Pb with high sensitivity and selectivity without using sophisticated apparatus. The morphology of the composite was determined via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrochemical characteristics of the electrode were characterized via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and SWASV. The experimental conditions, including the effect of buffer pH, pre-concentration time, pre-concentration potential, and ratio of graphene to PVA/chitosan were systematically optimized to give the best signal response in Pb detection. The detection range and selectivity of the method were then evaluated. The electrode was also applied to real water samples to verify the method."
1,Experimental,
2,Reagents and instrumentation,"2.1 Reagents and instrumentation Natural graphite (99 % carbon, particle size <44 μm, Sigma Aldrich), sulfuric acid (98 %, Merck), hydrochloric acid (37 %, Merck), potassium permanganate (99 %, Merck), hydrogen peroxide (solution in water, 30 %, Acros), polyvinyl alcohol (high molecular weight, Sigma Aldrich), chitosan (high molecular weight, Sigma Aldrich), acetic acid (≥99 %, Sigma Aldrich), sodium acetate (≥99 %, Sigma Aldrich), lead standard solution (1,000 ppm, Merck), deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm, Thermo Scientific, USA). Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT302 N, Metrohm Autolab, The Netherlands), driven by the Nova software. The three-electrode system included: a working electrode, PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE; a counter electrode, Pt electrode; a reference electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode (in 3 M KCl solution). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis was carried out with an S-4800 (Hitachi, Japan). A digestion instrument (705 UV, Metrohm AG, Switzerland) was employed for sample preparation. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (ZA3300, Hitachi, Japan) was used as a reference method of analysis of Pb in real water samples."
3,Preparation of graphene and PVA/chitosan-graphene composite,"2.2 Preparation of graphene and PVA/chitosan-graphene composite Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by the Hummers method with a little modification [46,47]. First, 6 g of graphite and 140 mL of H2SO4 were mixed and stirred in a reaction flask in an ice bath. Then, KMnO4 (20 g) was slowly added to the above solution and kept stirring. After that, the solution was stirred continuously at 40 °C for 2 h to oxidize graphite to GO. Subsequently, 240 mL of water was added slowly and stirred for 15 min. After that, 400 mL of water and 60 mL of H2O2 (30 %) were added and stirred for 30 min. Finally, the GO was filtered, washed with HCl 5%, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48 h. The dry GO (0.5 g) was added into a quartz tube with nitrogen flushing for 5 min. Then, the quartz tube was quickly inserted into a furnace preheated to 1,100 °C and kept for 1 min to achieve graphene by the thermal reduction-exfoliation of GO. Chitosan solution (0.5 wt.%) was prepared by dissolving chitosan (high molecular weight) in 0.1 M acetic solution for 24 h with magnetic stirring. PVA solution (2 wt.%) was prepared by dissolving PVA in deionized water with stirring at 85 °C for 12 h. Then, the chitosan solution (0.5 wt.%) and the PVA solution (2 wt.%) were blended (weight ratio of chitosan/PVA was 2/1) and stirred at 70 °C for 4 h. After that, different PVA/chitosan-TRG composites were prepared by varying contents of TRG added to the blended PVA/chitosan solution (weight ratios of TRG to the blended PVA/chitosan were 0.01:1, 0.05:1, 0.1:1, 0.15:0.1 and, 0.2:1). The mixtures were then continued stirring for 2 h."
4,Preparation of the PVA/chitosan-graphene modified GCE,"2.3 Preparation of the PVA/chitosan-graphene modified GCE Firstly, the GCE (3 mm in diameter) was cleaned with 0.3 and 0.05 μm of alumina slurry, washed with deionized water, and ultrasonicated in acetone for 2 min. Then, the GCE was washed again with deionized water and dried under nitrogen. Secondly, 5 μL of PVA/chitosan-graphene suspension was dropped onto the GCE surface. Finally, the electrode was dried in an infrared lamp to obtain a PVA/chitosan-graphene modified GCE."
5,Preparation of real sample analysis,"2.4 Preparation of real sample analysis Water samples were collected from a local river and a local lake. After filtration with a 0.4 μm membrane, the samples were stored in polyethylene bottles at 5 °C until measurements. Then, the samples were treated in the presence of a certain amount of H2O2 and HNO3 by a UV digester for 60 min. Finally, the samples were diluted and adjusted to appropriate concentrations with the supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.0)."
6,Electrochemical analysis,"2.5 Electrochemical analysis Unless otherwise stated, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in 2 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− (1:1) and 0.1 M KCl in the frequency range of 0.1−105 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV at the formal potential. The electrochemical detection of lead was carried out by using the SWASV technique in the supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5). SWASV measurements were optimized with a preconcentration time of 5 min, a preconcentration potential of -0.9 V, a rest time of 10 s, and square wave parameters: a starting potential of -0.8 V, a stopping potential of -0.3 V, a potential step of 5 mV, a frequency of 25 Hz and a pulse amplitude of 50 mV. After each measurement, the modified electrode was required to refresh by applying 0.1 V for 60 s in the supporting electrolyte under stirring and wash again with DI water twice."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology of PVA/chitosan-graphene composite,"3.1 Morphology of PVA/chitosan-graphene composite Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images of the thermally reduced graphene and the PVA/chitosan-graphene composite. It can be seen that the morphology of graphene and PVA/chitosan-graphene are distinctly different. While the graphene shows wrinkled, sheet-like, and crumpled morphology (Fig. 1A, B), the PVA/chitosan-graphene composite exhibits a homogeneous film with a well-dispersed status (Fig. 1C, D). The wrinkled nature of graphene is highly beneficial for preventing undesirable restacking and aggregation of individual graphene nano-sheets. Graphene prepared by thermal reduction-exfoliation of graphite oxide (GO) often contains residual hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl or epoxide groups that remain on the graphene surface [40,41,48]. These graphene sheets can be effectively dispersed into hydrophilic polymers because of the strong bonds among them. For instance, the residual epoxide functional groups of the graphene can react with amine groups to form amine-bearing molecules on the surface of the graphene [41]. PVA/Chitosan, with −OH and –NH2 in each unit, is easily protonated and becomes a cationic polymer under acidic conditions. Thus, a combination of these materials can offer an excellent dispersion. Besides, the PVA/chitosan-graphene composite still remains a rough surface which can provide a more effective area for the electrochemical process."
9,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),"3.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) The electrochemical characterizations of the electrode before and after surface modification were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The impedance spectra of the bare GCE, PVA/chitosan/GCE and PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE were compared, as presented in Fig. 2 A. In the Nyquist plot, the semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to a charge transfer-limited process, while the linear region in lower frequencies is related to a diffusion-controlled process. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be obtained from the diameter of the semicircle. It can be seen that the bare GCE shows a small semicircle (curve a, Rct ∼ 175 Ω) while the PVA/chitosan/GCE exhibits a large one (curve b, Rct ∼ 890 Ω), indicating that the PVA/chitosan layer formed in the electrode surface can hinder the electron transfer between [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Fe(CN)6]4− at the electrode interface. With the PVA/chitosan-TRG coated on GCE (curve c, Rct ∼ 270 Ω), the Rct was significantly decreased as compared to PVA/chitosan, but slightly higher than the bare GCE. These results imply that the PVA/chitosan can allow the electrode to pre-concentrate targeted cations and enhance resistance to interfering anion and bulky compounds, while graphene sheets can accelerate the electron-transfer and thus, increase the sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed method."
10,Electrochemical responses on the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE toward lead,"3.3 Electrochemical responses on the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE toward lead To prove the performance of PVA/chitosan-graphene composite in the detection of lead, a comparison of three different electrodes was conducted, including a bare GCE, a PVA/chitosan/GCE, a PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE, in the same condition. The SWASV voltammograms of those electrodes were obtained in the solution containing 50 ppb Pb(II) and 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5), as shown in Fig. 2B. It can be seen that there is no stripping peak of lead observed at the bare GCE, while there is an obvious tripping peak of lead at around -0.55 V and -0.58 V (versus Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl) with respect to the PVA/chitosan/GCE and the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE, respectively. The position of the stripping peak of lead at the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE is quite consistent with that of a nafion-graphene/GCE and a functionalized porous Si electrode [26,49] but more positive than that of other electrodes [16,50,51], indicating that the oxidation of Pb to Pb(II) at the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE is favored. The difference of the peak potential toward Pb in different electrodes may be ascribed to the difference in electrode materials and supporting electrolytes. In addition, the magnitude of the stripping peak at the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE is significantly larger than that at the PVA/chitosan/GCE. This is probably attributed to the enhancement of (i) the active surface area and (ii) the electron-transfer rate of graphene sheets. These results indicate that the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE can offer a considerable improvement in the detection of lead."
11,Analytical performance of the PVA/chitosan-graphene/GCE,"3.4 Analytical performance of the PVA/chitosan-graphene/GCE 3.4.1 Optimization of experimental conditions Before plotting a calibration curve and determining a LOD of the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE, experimental conditions (buffer pH, pre-concentration time, pre-concentration potential, ratio of graphene to PVA/chitosan) were established and optimized to give a maximum peak current response, peak sharpness, and high repeatability. The measurements were conducted by varying each factor respectively while the others were kept constant at their optimal conditions. Fig. 3 A shows the effect of pH of acetate buffer on the current response of the stripping peak at the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE. The measurements were conducted in the solution containing 50 ppb Pb(II) and 0.1 M acetate buffer in the pH range of 3−6. It can be seen that the peak current increases when the buffer pH increases from 3 to 5. After that, the peak current decreases up to pH 6. Besides, less acidic buffer gives more repeated responses. Taking into account both repeatability and sensitivity, the acetate buffer at pH 5 was chosen for subsequent experiments. The influence of pre-concentration time was studied in the range of 1−15 min in the solution containing 50 ppb Pb(II). As shown in Fig. 3B, the peak current linearly increases with increasing the pre-concentration time from 1−5 min as a result of the increase in the analyte amount at the electrode surface. After that, the graph tends to be curved with the decrease in the slope value due to surface saturation. Considering both short-time detection and sensitivity, the pre-concentration time of 5 min was chosen as an optimized parameter. The influence of pre-concentration potential was studied in the range from -1.2 V to -0.7 V in the solution containing 50 ppb Pb(II). As shown in Fig. 3C, The peak current increases when the pre-concentration potential shifts negatively from -0.7 V to -1.2 V as a result of Pb2+ ions being reduced more completely. With the potentials more negative than -0.9 V, the peak current negligibly increases. Although the peak current reaches a maximum value at -1.2 V, low repeatability is observed. This can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bubbles, which reduces the efficiency of the pre-concentration process and affects the repeatability of measurements [23,52]. Therefore, the pre-concentration potential of -0.9 V was chosen as an optimized parameter. The effect of the weight ratio of TRG to the blended PVA/chitosan was examined by varying the content of TRG added to the blended PVA/chitosan. The weight ratios of TRG to the blended PVA/chitosan were 0.01:1, 0.05:1, 0.1:1, 0.15:1, and 0.2:1. The measurements were carried out in the solution containing 50 ppb Pb(II) under the above-optimized conditions, as shown in Fig. 3D. It can be seen that the signal of the wt. ratios of 0.05:1 and 0.2:1 exhibit the highest peak currents, while the wt. ratio of 0.01:1 gives the lowest one. The current signal of the wt. ratios of 0.05:1 and 0.1:1 provide better repeatability, as compared to that of 0.01:1, 0.15:1, and 0.2:1. Considering the magnitude of peak current and repeatability, the wt. ratio of 0.05:1 of TRG to PVA/chitosan was chosen as an optimized parameter. 3.4.2 Calibration curve The SWASV voltammograms (Fig. 4 A) show that the magnitude of peak current increases with the increase of the Pb(II) concentration. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve of Pb(II) detection is obtained at a PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE for a range of 1−50 ppb Pb(II), as presented in Fig. 4B. The linear regression equation is expressed as i p (μA) = 0.035 × C (ppb Pb) – 0.0097 with a correlation coefficient of 0.996. The limit of detection (LOD) at a PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE, based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N = 3), gives a value of 0.05 ppb with a preconcentration time of 5 min, which is smaller than that at a screen-printed gold electrode (2.2 ppb) [53], a nafion/bismuth-coated/GCE (0.1 ppb) [54], a nafion/CNT/benzo-18-crown-6 electrode (0.2 ppb) [36]. When compared to a nafion/graphene/GCE (0.02 ppb) [49], the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE performed a relatively comparable LOD. Table 1 shows a comparison of different electrodes used in electrochemical detection for years. When compared to optical sensors for Pb detection which normally require novel ligands for complexation and long-time detection [55–57], our electrochemical PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE is more sensitive, eco-friendly, portable, low-cost, and easy-to-use. 3.4.3 Repeatability, reproducibility, and interference The repeatability of the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE was studied with ten independent measurements under optimized conditions in the solution containing 20 ppb, 50 ppb Pb, and 70 ppb Pb(II). According to the results, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated to be 3.8 %; 2.1 %, and 1.4 %, respectively. Besides, the reproducibility of the electrode was studied in 50 ppb with five electrodes prepared independently and the RSD was calculated to be 3.1 %. These results indicate that the electrode exhibits great repeatability and reproducibility. Selectivity in the anodic stripping voltammetry of Pb has been a challenge due to the competition of other metals for the surface active sites of the electrode under pre-concentration and stripping conditions. However, since each metal has a defined redox potential, the high selectivity toward Pb can be expected to obtain via the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE without using specific complexing agents. Cd was considered as a highly potential interference in ASV detection of Pb because Cd co-exists with Pb in common real samples and it has a stripping peak close to Pb’s one. Hence, the experiments were carried out in 50 ppb Pb(II) under optimized conditions in the presence and absence of 50 ppb Cd(II). We observed that there was only Pb stripping peak at around 0.6 V and the current response for Pb was no apparent change. This can be explained since the stripping potential range from -0.8 V to -0.2 V and the pre-concentration potential of -0.9 V were not negative enough to observe the Cd peak. For further clarity, we changed the pre-concentration potential to -1.3 V and the stripping potential range to a new range from -1.2 V to -0.3 V. Interestingly, two distinctive peaks without overlap were observed at around -0.58 V and -0.95 V for Pb and Cd, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 . This indicates that simultaneous detection of Pb and Cd can be obtained at the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE. Calibration curves (inset Fig. 5) in the range from 10 to 50 ppb for Pb and Cd exhibited good linearity with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. The tolerance levels of common foreign ions were also examined, as shown in Table 2 . The tolerance level was evaluated to be less than 5% of RSD with respect to the current response of 50 ppb Pb(II) in the co-existing species. The results show that 100-fold Na+, K+ and Ca2+, 50-fold Al3+, Mg2+, and Zn2+, 100-fold SO4 2−, NO3 −, PO4 3−, Cl−, Br−, F− and SCN−, 20-fold Fe3+ and Co2+, 2-fold Cu2+ and Ag+, 5-fold Cd2+ were found to have no interference in current response of 50 ppb Pb(II). However, in the presence of 100 ppb Bi3+, the current response of Pb significantly increased, as shown in Fig. 6 . This is because Bi can facilitate a better deposition thanks to the formation of a fusible alloy with Pb. The result also indicates that the electrode can detect Pb under in-situ bismuth film formation to obtain a maximum current response."
12,Application to real water samples,"3.5 Application to real water samples To verify the application potential of the PVA/chitosan-TRG/GCE for sensing Pb in actual water samples, we collect samples from a local river and a local lake. Before conducting measurements, the samples were pre-filtered with a 0.4-μm-membrane and treated with a UV digester for 60 min to release organic compounds into inorganic forms. The samples then were diluted 10 times before being added to 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH = 5). The standard addition method was employed to obtain the analytical results under the optimized conditions. Each sample was analyzed three times for averaging and the results were found to be consistent with those analyzed by AAS, as presented in Table 3 ."
13,Conclusions,"In this work, we presented a modified GCE based on the PVA/chitosan-TRG composite for square wave anode stripping voltammetry of lead in aqueous samples. The composite combining the benefits from thermally reduced graphene nanosheets (extraordinary electronic, electrochemical, and mechanical properties, and large surface area) and the Pb(II) ion adsorption capacity of the PVA/chitosan blend exhibited excellent electrocatalytic properties for the determination of Pb in terms of sensitivity, as compared to that of the bare GCE and the PVA/chitosan-coated GCE. The selectivity study revealed that most common foreign ions did not bring significant interference for Pb detection. Importantly, the modified electrode can be employed for simultaneous detection of Pb and Cd without overlap between stripping peaks. However, the reported data suggested that choosing the adequate experimental conditions (buffer pH, pre-concentration time, pre-concentration potential, ratio of graphene to PVA/chitosan) played an essential role in the detection process. With a preconcentration time of 5 min, the modified electrode presented a linear range in trace levels (1−50 ppb) and a relatively low detection limit (0.05 ppb), as compared to other electrochemical electrodes (see in Table 1). In comparison with optical sensors [58,59], our electrochemical electrode does not require novel ligands for complexation which is a time-consuming process and may lead to environmental concerns. The application of the modified electrode has been conducted successfully in real water samples for Pb detection and the results were in agreement with those obtained by AAS. Besides, considering environmental friendliness and the economically feasible production of bulk quantities of thermally reduced graphene and PVA/chitosan, the electrode may open a new approach for developing Pb electrochemical sensors."
