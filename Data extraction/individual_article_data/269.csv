0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones is an important criterion in both laboratory and fine chemical industry [1]. In general, the obtained carbonyl compounds from oxidation od alcohols have become necessary and vital precursors and/or intermediates for the synthesis of many drugs, various vitamins, several fragrances and etc. [2]. Traditionally, for the production of carbonyl compounds, involve the oxidation of the corresponding alcohols by using toxic, corrosive and expensive oxidants such as KMnO4 [3], CrO3 [4], MnO2, SeO2, Br2 [5], heptavalent iodine and DMSO coupled reagents [6], under stringent reaction conditions of high pressure or/and temperatures [7]. These reagents are regarded poisonous thus, considered as environmentally harmful and therefore have limited their green industrial applications. As an alternative to such traditional procedures, the utilization of commercially available and eco- and environmentally friendly oxidants such as molecular oxygen (O2) [8], aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [9], air [10,11], tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) [12], sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) [13], etc. also appears being attractive and practical. Among the above-mentioned oxidants, hydrogen peroxide is conspicuous for producing active oxidation species. It is known to be clean [11], inexpensive, relatively safe [14], showing atom efficiency [15], easy to handle [16] and gives water as the sole by-product [10] without generation of copious waste. During the last two decades, the use of both effective heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have been introduced for efficient and selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds [17]. In spite of notable usefulness of homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysis is more favorable [18] primarily due to advantages like being operative under severe conditions, shows good stability [19], high efficiencies, low toxicity [20], simple workups, giving minimum amount of waste and most importantly ease of its separation and reusing them for several runs without appreciable loss of catalytic activity [21]. Consequently, using a catalyst system that not only shows high activity and selectivity (such as a homogeneous system) but also enjoys the ease separation and recovery (such as a heterogeneous system) is preferred. These aims can be better accomplished by using nano catalysts [22]. As a matter of fact it seems that nano catalysts are channels which fill the hole and gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, sustain and maintaining the anticipated qualities of both systems [22] For any chemical reaction to occur, the surface of reactive species should come to close contact with the catalyst site. Thus, the size and surface of the catalyst play a key role, resulting in better selectivity and reactivity. In this regard, nano catalysts frequently provide proper size and surface to area ratio [23]. In some cases the development by doping and surface chemical modifications are also improving selectivity and reactivity as well as increasing the rate of the reaction [24]. Nano catalysts are not only used in several organic transformations but show other several other applications [25]. In last few decades, using of nano catalytic systems have attracted much attention of chemical community and found being quite impressive alternatives for traditional heterogeneous catalysts [19]. However, the problem of isolation and recovery of these petite nano catalysts from the reaction mixture is a serious problem which should be circumvented. Conservative and conventional procedures (such as filtration) are not capable enough and inappropriate due the nano size of the catalyst particles [22]. This restriction incumbers the economics and sustainability of applications of these nano catalyst in chemical industry. To overwhelm this back draw, the polymers, microporous [26], inorganic solids, etc. have been used and evaluated as support for the immobilization of homogeneous catalysts. Among various supports being used, nowadays, the use of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles has attracted much attention of chemical community [27]. These materials for being used as support, are readily available [28], having high-surface-area [29] and most significantly they can be separated easily by using an external magnet bar [30]. The immobilization of metallo-ligand complexes on magnetic nanoparticles has been achieved by attachment of ligands to the magnetic surface and was used in the presence of various oxidants in the selective oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds [22]. With this view, among a wide variety of transition-metal catalysts [31] such as, palladium [32], Ruthenium [33], gold [34], copper [35], osmium [36], the use of copper is the best choice due to their sufficient selectivity, low toxicity and price [37]. The essential factor which should be considered is a bridge between the nitrogen-based ligands and magnetic nanoparticles. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is a versatile and an anionic polyelectrolyte [38]. In addition, the long-chain poly(acrylic acid) has the highest content of hydroxyl groups which is not only provide a unique structural environment for complexation [39] but can also being functionalized by the multidentate ligand [40]. Various ligands have been successfully employed as supported copper complex in oxidation of alcohols [19]. However for such purpose the nitrogen-containing ligands have more frequently being used [41]. Therefore, designing ligands with good nature and great versatility is necessary for dealing with the challenging substrates in this area. Recent research has been focused on the use of flexible bridging ligand for the creation of coordination architectures. 1.2,3-Triazoles have been found as a good type of flexible ligands containing three nitrogen atoms [42]. In the last few decades, the regioselective synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles from Cu(I)-catalyzed [43] has stirred up the interest and attracted the attention of synthetic organic chemists due to concept of “Click Chemistry” as defined by the giant of 21st century of organic chemistry, K.B.Sharpless. 1,2,3-Triazoles as five-membered heterocycles containing three nitrogen atoms which have shown to be compatible with a superfluity of functional groups and moreover exhibiting good stability under several reaction conditions [44]. 1,2,3-Triazole moieties as a building block act as N-donors and thus exhibit effectively being coordinated with various metals, showing interesting physico-chemical properties [45]. Computational investigations of click-derived 1,2,3-triazoles as keystone ligands for complexation with transition metals has also been extensively reviewed [46]. We are interested in the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles and have studied “Click Reaction” from different points of view [47] specially their synthesis under heterogeneous catalysis. Following our interest in selective oxidation under greener and sustainable benign pathways for organic transformation [48], nanomaterials and selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds [49], we recently reported the oxidation of alcohols using Cu-nanoparticles [50]. Herein, we wish to report the design and fabrication of a unique magnetic nanoparticles copper(I) ion complexes with 1,2,3-triazole bridged which is immobilized on poly(acrylic acid) (denoted as Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I)). Its catalytic activity was investigated in the selective oxidation of primary and secondary benzyl alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds under mild reaction conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in acetonitrile as a solvent of choice."

13,Result and discussion,
14,Synthesis and characterization of the catalyst,"4.1 Synthesis and characterization of the catalyst Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I) nanoparticles were prepared as schematically illustrated in Scheme 2 . Initially, magnetite particles were prepared by co-precipitation from Fe2+ and Fe3+ with the ammonium hydroxide solution according to the method previously reported by Sahu et al. [51] Then, to avoid the agglomeration of nanoparticles and overcome the solubility problems in organic media, the particles were coated with silica through a sol-gel process. Subsequently, double bond groups were functionalized onto the surface by reacting of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (MAPTMS) with silanols on the Fe3O4@SiO2 under inert atmosphere conditions in toluene for 24 h. In order to make the bridge between nanoparticles and ligand, the acrylic acid monomer was polymerized on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS composites by the radical polymerization reaction. Then, triazole ring was synthesized using propargyl alcohol and benzyl azide through Cu(I) -catalyzed click reaction, in accordance with the procedure reported by reported previously by Sharpless et al. [53] For interaction of triazole ring with Cu(I) ions, (1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methanol was grafted onto the PAA through esterification reaction between carbonyl groups on poly(acrylic acid) and hydroxyl groups on the (1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methanol backbone, which provided active sites for immobilization of Cu(I) ions. Finally, Cu(I) was introduced to the composites to achieve the desired catalyst. The crystalline structure of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle and surface-modified nano-composite were determined by XRD. Fig. 1 illustrated the XRD patterns of the Fe3O4 (A) and Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA (B) nanoparticles, respectively. The characteristic peaks (Fig. 1A) at 2θ = 30.12°, 35°, 43.17°, 53.58°, 57.10°, 62.65° and 74.28°, corresponding to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440) and (622) Bragg diffractions of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle with the cubic inverse spinel structure [54]. In the pattern, Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA (Fig. 1B) shows an additional broad peak in the 2θ range from 20.0° to 30.0° due to the amorphous of the PAA shell. The results indicated that the Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA has been prepared and demonstrating that the crystal structure of Fe3O4 has not been changed after being coated with PAA. For characterization of (1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methanol (compound 1) 1H NMR technique was used (Fig. 2 ). The sharp singlet peak at δ = 7.58 can be assigned to the aromatic proton (a) of triazole while the resonances at 5.54 and 4.81 ppm were assigned to the 2 protons of the benzylic (b) and methylene (c) attached to the phenyl group, respectively. A resonance at 5.25 ppm can be assigned to that of the 1 proton of hydroxyl group (d) in compound 1. For further confirmation of the presence of PAA@Triazole@Cu (I) composite shell on the surface of modified Fe3O4 NPs, XPS analysis were performed. Fig. 3 exhibits the XPS spectrum of the core-shell Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I), which clearly shows the signals for C, N, O, Cu, and Fe. The binding energies at 285, 531, and 711 eV are attributed to C 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2P, respectively [55]. The peaks at 935.08 eV is assigned to Cu 2p3/2, this indicated that Cu (I) is deposited on the PAA@Triazole surface. Although, the binding energy at 710.20 ev for Fe 2p3 could not be detected, the other evidence indicates that all the Fe3O4 cores in the composite is placed inside a shell of PAA@Triazole@Cu(I), which are consistent with the above XRD and SEM analyses. In order to measure the elemental components and distribution throughout the Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I), a detailed chemical analysis EDS mapping was used, as shown in Fig. 4 . It is clear that the Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I) is composed of Fe, Si, O, C, N and Cu elements. The SEM image indicates that as prepared Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I) have a uniform spherical shape and smooth surface morphology. The relative amount of PAA grafted onto the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS was estimated by TGA measurements. The thermogravimetric (TG) curves of Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS and Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS@PAA are illustrated in Fig. 5 A, B respectively. The thermogram of Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS (Fig. 5A) shows a slight weight loss of around 4.65 wt% at below 230 °C, which is related to the elimination of moisture. Fig. 5B displays two steps of degradation; the first step during heating from room temperature to 200 is assigned to the elimination of moisture. The large weight loss of about 17.43 wt% at temperature range between 230 ºC–660 °C is attributed to PAA decomposition. The typical FT-IR spectra of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS) are presented in Fig. 6 (A and B), respectively. The pure magnetic nanoparticles (Fig. 6A) exhibited the broad band around 3300 cm−1 resulting from the stretching vibrations of –OH groups on the nanoparticle surface [56]. The peaks observed at 593 and 1081 cm−1 are ascribed to Fe–O and C–H stretching vibrations, respectively [57]. In the spectrum of Fe3O4@SiO2@MAPTMS composites (Fig. 6B), the absorption bands at 1089 and 801 cm−1 are related to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the SiO2 shell, respectively. The peaks at 1144 cm−1 (C–O), 1633 cm−1 (CC), and 1713 cm−1 (CO) are characteristic of MAPTMS, while the bands located at 2626 and 2973 cm−1 are being to alkyl groups [-(CH)n-] of MAPTMS [58]. Core–shell Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I) -catalyzed selective oxidation of differently substituted benzyl alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds using hydrogen peroxide. As mentioned before, the selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones is an important criterion in both acidemia and chemical industry since the obtained carbonyl compounds are precious and necessary precursors and/or intermediates for the synthesis of several important drugs, vitamins and fragrances. Following the design, preparation and full-characterization of we contemplated to explore the catalytic performance of the core-shell of Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I), in the selective oxidation of differently substituted benzylic type alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds. Initially, we selected simple benzyl alcohol a model compound for the catalyzed oxidation using hydrogen peroxide. To optimize the amount of the catalyst, oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed in the presence of the various amounts of catalyst in acetonitrile at 60 °C using hydrogen peroxide. The results are presented in Table 1 . As indicated in Table 1, within 5 h and with 0.1 mol% of copper catalyst, maximum conversion (85%) of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was obtained (Table 1, entry 3). By decreasing the catalyst loading the conversions were decreasing whereas by using 0.05 mol% lowest yield of benzaldehyde was obtained (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). Notably, by increasing of the amount of catalyst to 0.2 mol% the yield was slightly increased (Table 1, entry 4). In the next step, for finding the optimum temperature, the oxidation was carried out at different temperature using the optimal amount of catalyst in acetonitile. The yield of benzaldehde at 60 °C was found significantly higher than other temperature (Table 2 , entry 2), The yield at room temperature for benzyl alcohol was very low even after 24 h (Table 2, entry 1). As can be seen, Table 2 shows that the by rising the temperature the rate of oxidation is accelerated (up to 60 °C), However, by further increasing the temperature the yield of benzaldehyde was decreased (Table 2, entry 3), which might be due to the overoxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid or self-decomposition of H2O2 at higher temperatures, leading to insufficient oxidation of BzOH. In order to further investigate the catalyst efficiency, the oxidation of various benzyl alcohols was examined under the already secured optimized reaction conditions (Table 3 ). As evident from Table 3, the obtained products are only the corresponding aldehydes. No by-product such as the corresponding carboxylic acid was detected by the gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Under the already secured reaction conditions, the oxidation of differently substituted benzyl alcohol types were conducted. Benzyl alcohols bearing either electron-releasing or electron-withdrawing substituents were examined. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol bearing one or more electron-withdrawing groups were found being oxidized faster with no overoxidation products were detected resulting in the higher yields of the corresponding carbonyl compounds (Table 3, entries 5–8). For example, 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and p-nitro benzyl alcohol were successfully oxidized into their corresponding aldehydes in 97% and 73% yield, respectively (Table 3, entries 7 and 8). Compared to benzylic alcohols, alcohols with aliphatic chain showed relatively low reactivity toward oxidation (Table 3, entry 3). In addition, allylic and benzilic alcohols with electron-donating groups can also be oxidized into the corresponding aldehyde but required higher temperatures for the completion (Table 3, entries 2 and 4). We found that secondary alcohols were oxidized into their corresponding ketones with fair yields by increasing temperature and reaction time (Table 3, entry 9). Specifically, in the absence of the catalyst (Table 3, entry 10), this reaction does not occur even under reflux condition during a period of more than one day. The results showed that our catalytic system can be widely used to the oxidation of the broad substrate scope and remarkable functional group tolerance. In addition, the catalyst was shown to be very good activity for the selective oxidation of primary and secondary aromatic alcohols depending on the nature of substituent group on the aromatic ring. In order to show the catalytic activity of our catalytic system in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with hydrogen peroxide, results and reaction conditions were compared with some of the previously reported method for this reaction (Table 4 ) [59–67]. The results clearly show that our new catalytic system is superior to some of the other methods in term of the yields and/or reaction times."
15,Recyclability of Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I),"4.2 Recyclability of Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole@Cu(I) To prove the magnetic separability and reusability of the as-prepared catalyst, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol as a model reaction was carried out using recovered catalyst. The recovered catalyst was successfully oxidized the model reaction under optimized reaction conditions at least for 3 cycles. After oxidation with freshly prepared catalyst. It was separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnet, washed with deionized water and then reused in the next cycle. The results are presented in Fig. 7 demonstrating that after every run, the conversion yields of benzyl alcohol did not change significantly, which indicates the high stability of the catalyst. Notably, the magnetic extraction eliminates the need for filtration or centrifugation."
16,Conclusion,"The immobilization copper(I) on the prepared core-shell Fe3O4@MAPTMS@PAA@Triazole was successfully achieved. It was fully characterized by various physicochemical (XRD, TGA, SEM) and spectral studies (FT-IR, 1H NMR). The catalytic activity of the catalyst was studies in the oxidation of benzyl alcohols as a model reaction in acetonitrile using 30% H2O2 as an environmentally friendly oxidant. The selective oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol derivatives to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones were successfully performed. Mild reaction condition, high conversion and excellent selectivity are other advantages which can be mentioned for this protocol. Moreover, the catalyst is magnetically recoverable and chemically stable, which can be reused at least for three times without significant loss in activity."
