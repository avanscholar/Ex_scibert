0,Introduction,"Carbonation and calcination of CaO-based sorbents has been investigated for various industrial applications such as post-combustion CO2 capture [1,2], chemical storage of thermal energy [3,4], and sorption-enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP) [5–20]. Among the technologies mentioned above, our specific interest is in SEHP. Currently, the primary method of producing hydrogen is through a multistep steam-methane reforming (SMR) process. Synthesis gas is formed by an endothermic steam-methane reforming reaction with a Ni catalyst at a high temperature (∼850 °C) in the first step of the process. Then, two stages of the shift reaction at low temperatures (∼250–450 °C) are typically used to increase the hydrogen yield. The shift reaction is then followed by a CO2 removal process that requires additional energy consumption. SEHP accomplishes the above processes (i.e., reforming, shift, and CO2 removal) in a single processing step with the thermodynamic equilibrium shifted favorably for hydrogen production by adding a high-temperature CO2 absorbent. Reforming reaction: CH 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ CO ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 206 kJ / mol Shift reaction: CO ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ↔ CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol Overall (SEHP process with use of CaO as an absorbent): CH 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) + CaO ( s ) ↔ CaCO 3 ( s ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = − 13 kJ / mol In addition to the advantageous simplification of the process, the SEHP reaction with a CaO-based absorbent is almost thermally neutral so no supplemental energy is required for hydrogen production. Instead, the SEHP requires energy for the regeneration of the used CaO for multi-cycle operation as per the following equation. CaCO 3 ( s ) ↔ CaO ( s ) + CO 2 ( g ) Δ H 298 K = 178 kJ / mol Even after accounting for the energy used for absorbent regeneration, the supplemental energy required for SEHP is still 20% less than that of conventional SMR processes. Due to these advantageous features of SEHP, reforming target materials were recently expanded to hydrocarbons, oxygenated hydrocarbons, and bio-oils [13,16]. Also, thermodynamic models and new process concepts for SEHP with the different target materials have been investigated in depth [10,15]. For the successful development of SEHP, the CO2 absorbent must have a substantial lifetime over multiple carbonation/calcination cycles to avoid repeated separations of the CO2 absorbent and reforming catalyst. However, it is generally acknowledged that the CO2 capacity of natural CaO drops by 80% after 10–20 cycles [6,8,20,21]. This loss of capacity is attributed to the sintering and agglomeration of the CaO particles as the cycle number increases resulting in reduced surface area [8]. The agglomeration of particles caused by sintering transforms the control of the carbonation reaction of the absorbent from rapid kinetic to slow diffusion [2]. Many researchers have attempted to prevent the sintering of CaO using various methods. Bandi [22] claimed that an increased concentration of inert material in the CO2 absorbent would enhance the cyclic stability by preventing agglomeration since the inert portion behaves as a skeleton to maintain its microstructure over multiple carbonations and calcinations cycles. Inspired by this idea, many researchers have attempted to impede agglomeration by adding various inert additives. Silaban et al. [21] reported that dolomite is superior to limestone in terms of the resulting stability over the CO2 carbonation/calcination cycles. In dolomite and huntite, the MgO behaves as partition wall, thereby preventing the sintering of CaO since MgO does not react with CO2 at over 400 °C. However, naturally existing MgO in CaO-based sorbents such as dolomite or huntite only slows down the deterioration rate of the CO2 capacities to some extent because of its poor dispersion. Other researchers tried to impart improved CO2 absorption characteristics by pretreating limestone [23–25]. Recent research [17–19] suggests that the incorporation of Ca12Al14O33 into CaO improves the cyclic stability by providing a robust and well-dispersed skeleton that prevents agglomeration. Yi et al. [9] proved that oxygen-vacancy possessing materials such as Ce x Zr1−x O2 and LaAl x Mg1−x O3 can be excellent additives to enhance the cyclic stability of CaO by facilitating the transportation of CO 3 − . However, there have been few studies that report the proper preparation method for a synthetic CaO absorbent with the addition of MgO. Mg is a relatively abundant material compared to the additives above. Also, the uniform dispersion of MgO in a CaO-based sorbent has been never attempted even though it might result in the enhancement of cyclic stability while avoiding the use of expensive additives and severe preparation conditions. In this study, CaO-based CO2 absorbents are prepared with MgO via co-precipitation and additional hydration between calcinations to concurrently provide uniform dispersion and a porous structure; their cyclic stability during multiple carbonations and calcinations was investigated."
1,Material and methods,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation To achieve the maximum dispersion of MgO in the CaO absorbent, a co-precipitation method using nitrate-type precursors was adopted. The preparation procedure is as follows. First, designated amounts of calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, reagent grade, Aldrich) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, reagent grade, Aldrich) were dissolved in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 130 mL) and distilled water (760 mL). The prepared solution was stirred for 1 h at 75 °C and then evaporated at 120 °C in a drying oven overnight. The powder was collected from the oven and calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in air. The resultant powder was crushed and sieved to the particle size range of 100–150 μm for the multi-cycle tests. This process is referred to as ’method 1.’ Secondly, the prepared powder was added to a mixture of IPA (65 mL) and distilled water (380 mL) and the resultant slurry was stirred for 3 h at 75 °C. Then, the solution was evaporated at 120 °C overnight and the residue was calcined at 900 °C for 1.5 h. The collected powder was crushed and sieved to the same particle size range indicated in the first step. The preparation method including the first and second steps is referred to as ’method 2.’ The samples were named according to their composition: CA for CaO alone, C75M25 for the sample with 75 wt% CaO and 25 wt% MgO, C50M50 for the sample with 50 wt% CaO and 50 wt% MgO, and C25M75 for the sample with 25 wt% CaO and 75 wt% MgO. Also, the samples prepared using only the first step (method 1) are appended with ’-1′ and the samples prepared using both the first and second steps (method 2) are appended with ’-2′. It was assumed that the uniform dispersion of MgO and CaO was achieved via the first step and the high porosity of absorbent was achieved through the second step. The highly porous structure was achieved through the transformation to the hydroxide form during hydration and back to the oxide form via calcination."
3,Absorbent characterization,"2.2 Absorbent characterization The surface areas of the absorbents were measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption at −196.8 °C on a Micrometics ASAP 2010 analyzer. The resolution was 0.133 Pa for the system. Each absorbent was degassed at 150 °C and <1.33 mPa for 16 h before measurement. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the absorbents was recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/Max2000-Ultima Plus, Cu-Ka radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm, 30 kV, 20 mA) in the range of 2θ = ∼30–70°. Typical peaks corresponding to CaO and MgO were identified by indexing the peaks on the XRD patterns. Also, the morphologies of the prepared absorbents were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL30, 15 kV)."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure 80–110 mg of sample was placed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA Instrument, Q50) for the carbonation/calcination cyclic tests. The schematic diagram of the TGA system is shown in Fig. 1 . Helium gas was flowed through the built-in mass flow controller (MFC) to either the balance chamber only or both the balance chamber and the furnace. CO2 gas was flowed through the designated MFC to the furnace. The volumetric ratio of the flow to the balance chamber to the flow to the furnace is 0.1. Therefore, the sample was exposed to 90-vol% CO2 with He balance during the carbonation step and to 100% He during the calcination step. The total flow rate of the gas mixture is maintained at 100 sccm at all times. The temperature in the furnace was maintained at 700 °C for both the carbonation and calcination steps. The desorption rate of CO2 is dependent on the CO2 partial pressure and temperature: the desorption rate is usually higher at higher temperatures. As in our previous study [9], the calcination temperature was set equal to the carbonation temperature to remove the effect of temperature swing on the cyclic stability."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Absorption ratio and weight gain,"3.1 Absorption ratio and weight gain The CO2 absorption capacities of absorbents are expressed in two different ways in this study. One way uses the absorption ratio defined as the mole ratio of CO2 absorbed to CaO in absorbent. Absorption ratio ( % ) = moles of CO 2 absorbed moles of CaO in absorbent × 100 The absorption ratio provides information about the utilization rate of CaO in the absorbent. The other way of representing the absorption capacity is simply by using the weight gain due to CO2 absorption per unit weight of absorbent. This value permits us to compare the absolute CO2 uptake of an absorbent regardless of its CaO content. In order to obtain the optimum composition of absorbent, both the absorption ratio and the weight gain should be considered. For example, even if the absorption ratio was very high, it would not be very useful if the content of CaO, which is the active material for CO2 capture, is small because excessive heat would be wasted in warming up the inert MgO. However, even with the CaO-alone absorbent, it is unlikely that all the CaO is converted to CaCO3 during the carbonation step because the CaCO3 layer formed around the absorbent particles will limit the mass transfer of CO2 to the inner CaO. Therefore, it would be ideal to determine the optimum content of MgO that provides a CaO-based absorbent with both a weight gain that is equivalent to the CaO-alone absorbent and cyclic stability during multiple cycles of carbonation/calcination."
7,CaO-alone absorbents,"3.2 CaO-alone absorbents A typical result for a multi-cycle test using CA-1 and CA-2 is shown in Fig. 2 . As described in the experimental section, CA-1 is the CaO-alone absorbent prepared via the co-precipitation process (method 1) and CA-2 is the CaO-alone absorbent prepared via co-precipitation followed by hydration (method 2). CA-1 showed a very poor absorption capacity during the early cycles, although the capacity gradually increased as the cycle number increased until it stabilized at around 15% of the absorption ratio. It is presumed that the CaO particles are closely packed through the drying and calcination processes of method 1. In contrast, CA-2 showed a very high maximum value for the absorption ratio in the third cycle that indicated 75% CaO conversion after which its absorption capacity rapidly decreased to 40% by the 15th cycle and 25% by the 60th cycle. The high absorption ratio of CA-2 in the early stage is attributed to the additional hydration during the preparation process. The particles from the first step were swelled during the hydration process and the space that the hydroxyl groups occupied was evacuated thereby providing a spacious pathway for CO2. However, as the carbonation and calcination cycles were repeated, continuous agglomeration of the CaO particles gradually blocks the pathway. Detailed explanations of similar results using the CaO-alone absorbent can be found in our previous study [9]."
8,Absorbents prepared by co-precipitation,"3.3 Absorbents prepared by co-precipitation The conditions for the multi-cycle tests in TGA were identical for all samples. Fig. 3 shows the multi-cycle results in terms of the absorption ratios of the absorbents prepared by method 1. For these samples, the absorption ratios during the initial stage of the multi-cycle tests were very low and increased and stabilized as the cycle number increased. An explanation of this behavior is as follows. During the initial stage of the multi-cycle test, the CaO particles are closely packed and CaCO3 formation on the surface causes a volume increase and the formation of micro-cracks on the surface during the calcination step. In the next carbonation step, the CO2 moves freely through the cracks until it reaches the next layer of packed CaO. This micro-crack formation continues to increase the absorption capacity cycle by cycle until it reaches a critical point. At this point, CaCO3 forms on the outer shell before the CO2 can reach the next rigid layer of CaO thereby inhibiting further CO2 induction. Abanades [26] claimed that the critical thickness, i.e., the thickness of the CaCO3 layer at which it controls the rate of CO2 uptake, is 22 nm. The weight increase profiles of CA-1 according to its cycle number shown in Fig. 4 support the above presumption. One should not confuse the weight increase profiles in Fig. 4 with the absorption ratio profiles or weight gain profiles shown in other figures as the data points in Fig. 4 are the measured weights of the samples according to absorption time. The weight of the sample rapidly increased up to the third to fifth data point after which the rate of increase abruptly decreased. These points represent the transition from kinetic to diffusion control. The duration of kinetic control and the amount of CO2 absorbed increased as the cycle number increased, which implies that more pores are developed in the absorbent with each carbonation/calcination cycle and the duration of fast CO2 migration in the gas phase increases. Therefore, the presumption made above is believed to be correct. As shown in Fig. 3, C25M75-1 showed the highest CaO utilization and CA-1 showed the lowest CaO utilization during all cycles of the multi-cycle test. Also, the CaO conversion improved as the content of Mg in the absorbent increased. As reported in elsewhere, MgO seems to behave as a partition wall to prevent sintering of the CaO particles since the absorption ratio of CA-1 slightly decreased during the late stages of the multi-cycle test while that of the absorbents containing MgO did not. In fact, in the case of C25M75-1, the absorption ratio continued to increase as the cycle number increased. Therefore, the higher the MgO content of the absorbent, the better the performance of the absorbent according to the absorption ratio profiles in Fig. 3. However, it is also necessary to assess the weight gain on the basis of the absorbent mass. Fig. 5 shows the multi-cycle test results of the same absorbents in terms of weight gain. The weight gains of the absorbents were in the range of 8–14%. In contrast to the results of the absorption ratio profiles in Fig. 3, CA-1 showed the highest weight gain and C25M75-1 showed the lowest. This indicates that excess MgO lowers the absolute CO2 uptake on the basis of absorbent weight and decreases its economical value even though it provides excellent cyclic stability. Considering that the weight gains of CaO-based absorbents reported elsewhere [9,14,15] are in the range of 20–40%, the CO2 uptake of the absorbents prepared by co-precipitation is not sufficient for application in SEHP processes. In Fig. 6 , SEM images of the absorbents prepared by method 1 are shown. Small particles with an average diameter of 200 nm were uniformly formed in CA-1. In C75M25-1, rugged bark-like plate structures with small particles on them are evident. When the MgO weight increased to half of absorbent weight, i.e., in sample C50M50-1, the small particles were no longer present. In C25M75-1, the particles are round with an average diameter of 1 μm. Interestingly, as the content of MgO increased, the particles increased in size and became more spherical. As shown in Fig. 7 , the XRD patterns of the absorbents prepared by co-precipitation show the clear intensity decrease of the CaO peaks as the content of MgO increased. It appears that the calcination at 500 °C was sufficient to remove all other compounds since no peaks appeared other than those for CaO and MgO."
9,Absorbents prepared by co-precipitation and additional hydration,"3.4 Absorbents prepared by co-precipitation and additional hydration To achieve high surface area and spacious CO2 pathways for the absorbents, a hydration process was applied to the absorbents prepared via the co-precipitation process. It was assumed that the hydration process would cause a conversion from the oxide form to the hydroxide form with volume expansion. This was followed by calcination to extract the water and provide micro-voids in the absorbents. Fig. 8 shows the absorption ratio profiles of the multi-cycle tests of the absorbents prepared by method 2. As shown in Fig. 8, the additional hydration process greatly increased the CaO utilization rates of the absorbents during CO2 absorption. The maximum absorption ratios were 74%, 82%, 80%, and 90% for CA-2, C75M25-2, C50M50-2, and C25M75-2, respectively. Unlike the absorbents prepared by method 1 (shown in Fig. 3), the absorbents with the additional hydration process (except CA-2) did not show an increase of the absorption ratio in the early cycles. The absorption ratio of CA-2 also reached its maximum at the third cycle. As implied in the previous section, this is attributed to the substantial pathways for CO2 transfer that were imparted by the hydration and calcination processes. Essentially, since the pores are well-developed and connected to the inner CaO of the absorbent, CO2 can move freely to the inside of the absorbent thereby maximizing the CaO utilization until the pores around the surface are blocked by CaCO3 formation. In terms of the cyclic stability, the MgO-containing absorbents also showed excellent performance. Whereas CA-2 shows a 62% reduction of its absorption ratio by the 60th cycle, C75M25-2, C50M50-2, and C25M75-2 show only an 8.9%, 17%, and 2.3% reduction of their absorption ratios, respectively, by the 60th cycle. As speculated, the uniform dispersion of MgO in the absorbents effectively prevented the sintering and agglomeration of the CaO particles. Therefore, increased weight gains are expected for the absorbents prepared with the additional hydration process. Fig. 9 shows the absolute weight gains over the multi-cycle tests for the absorbents prepared by method 2. The individual profiles are basically the same as those in Fig. 8. However, their order is completely different. The maximum weight gains were 58.0%, 47.8%, 31.3%, and 17.4% for CA-2, C75M25-2, C50M50-2, and C25M75-2, respectively. The weight gain of C75M25-2 at the 60th cycle was 43.5%, which is very high for a CaO-based absorbent. Although it showed a slight decrease in weight gain over the multi-cycle test, it demonstrated excellent cyclic stability compared to CA-2. The SEM images shown in Fig. 10 reinforce the suggestions made in this study. The overall morphologies of the absorbents show that smaller particles were formed in the absorbents prepared via method 2 compared to those prepared via method 1. The smooth surface of C50M50-1 and C25M75-1 (shown in Fig. 5) is transformed to a small gravelly-like structure in C50M50-2 and C25M75-2 upon the generation of the spacious pathways for CO2. Unlike in the absorbents prepared by method 1, it was found that the particles of C50M50-2 are larger and less uniform than those of C75M25-2. This might explain why the cyclic stability of C75M25-2 is superior to that of C50M50-2. On the other hand, C25M75-2 shows a very uniform distribution of particles with similar sizes. Fig. 11 shows the XRD patterns of the absorbents prepared by both method 1 and method 2. The red lines represent the XRD patterns of the absorbents prepared by method 1 and the black lines represent those of the absorbents prepared by method 2. Judging from the peak intensity and width, it is clear that the additional hydration process produced smaller particles. All the CaO peaks in the absorbents prepared by method 2 are lower and broader than those in the absorbents prepared by method 1. Also, the peaks of C75M25-2 are slightly shifted to the right from the positions of the peaks of C75M25-1. Therefore, it indicates that a solid solution (Ca0.75Mg0.25CO3) is at least partially formed. Also, it was found that the MgO peaks show no difference between method 1 and method 2. This implies that MgO is less sensitive to the hydrothermal treatment and calcination since the particle size of MgO is not affected. Considering that MgO is not converted to MgCO3 when it is exposed to CO2 atmosphere at temperatures higher than 500 °C, MgO is considered to be a good additive for maintaining the structure of CaO-based absorbents."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, a simple and cost-effective method for preparing high-temperature CO2 absorbents with high cyclic stability was introduced. Mimicking the uniform dispersion of MgO in natural dolomite and huntite effectively improves both the CO2 absorption capacity and the cyclic stability. It was found that the co-precipitation method with calcination provided cyclic stability to the CO2 absorbents. However, their absorption capacities were too small to apply them in industry. An additional hydration step provided spacious CO2 pathways while maintaining the uniform MgO dispersion. As a result, greatly improved CO2 absorption capacities were achieved. Spectroscopic analysis showed that the additional hydration step resulted in the formation of smaller particles, which provides spacious CO2 pathways. Partial solid solution formation in C75M25-2 was confirmed, and its absorption capacity was 43.5 g CO2/g absorbent at the 60th cycle in the multi-cycle test. The combined co-precipitation and hydration method is considered to be effective for producing highly stable CaO-based CO2 absorbents."
