0,Introduction,"Epoxidized vegetable oils (VO) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) are very important renewable raw materials in chemical industry, which mainly used as non-toxic, environmental friendly components or additives in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), lubricants, urethane foams, thermosetting plastics and cosmetics et al. [1–3]. As shown in Scheme 1 , the deoxidized VO usually are achieved by gradual oxidation process, the mono-epoxides are first detected and the corresponding di-epoxides are formed under the further oxidation, then the tri-epoxides are finally obtained by complete oxidation [3]. Soybean oil (SO) is one of the most important source of unsaturated glycerides and available abundantly across the world, and the corresponding epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) can be prepared from SO through the epoxidation reaction, which can be utilized as an attractive plasticizer substitute for phthalates, owing to the advantages of sustainability, low price, and ease of manufacture [4–6]. Currently, ESO is produced at industrial scale mostly by the peracid process, in which the organic peracid as the oxidation formed in situ through the catalyzed oxidation of corresponding carboxylic acid (formic or acetic acid) in the presence of mineral acids (usually sulphuric acid) [7–10]. However, there are several drawbacks in this process, such as, (i) the low epoxidized products selectivity, (ii) the separation, recovery and reuse of catalysts are very difficult in the homogeneous reaction, (iii) the corrosion of equipment and environmental unfriendly in the strong acids system. To develop new techniques for the conversion of SO to ESO, many efforts have been made in recently years, and the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant are commonly applied in this epoxidation reaction. Homogeneous catalysts include metal complex [11,12], peroxophosphotungstate [13–16] and enzyme [17,18] are used in this reaction. Although high epoxide yields have been achieved in this process, most of them show serious limitations of separating and recycling of the catalysts. In order to avoid the defects of the homogeneous catalysts, some heterogeneous catalysts are employed in the epoxidation reaction system, which have several advantages of easy recovery, possible reuse and regeneration, no contamination and no corrosion, such as alumina [19,20], niobium–silica [21–23], ion exchange resins [24,25], mesoporous molecular sieves [26–29], etc. Recently, our group developed an efficacious epoxidation approach to synthesize epichlorohydrin from allyl chloride over titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) catalyst. The experiment results indicate that the framework Ti sites in TS-1 may play a very important role to enhance catalytic activity in the epoxidation reaction [30]. Considering there are multiple CC bonds exist in SO molecules, the epoxidation of SO could be also achieved by using TS-1 as heterogeneous catalysts, and this approach could be a green and economical technological process for the product of ESO. Actually, some Ti-containing zeolites (Ti supported on SiO2, Ti-β, etc) were previously used as catalysts for the epoxidation of VO and SO [27,28,31–35], which also suggests that TS-1 catalysts could be good candidates for the reaction. In the present work, we carefully investigated the catalytic performance of various TS-1 catalysts for the conversion of SO to ESO. A series of hetero-catalysts microporous TS-1 with different Si/Ti molar ratio (TS-1-x, x = 40, 70, 80), mesoporous TS-1-40 (MTS-1-40) and anatase TiO2 catalysts were synthesized and characterized by many techniques. Furthermore, the influences of various reaction conditions on the epoxidation of SO over TS-1-40 were systematically investigated. Finally, the reusability of TS-1-40 catalyst was performed, and the reason of TS-1-40 catalyst deactivation and the regeneration method in this epoxidation reaction were also explored."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was purchased from Shanghai Zhanyun Chemical Co., Ltd., China. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), hydrogen peroxide (30 wt%), soybean oil and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co. Ltd., China. Methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ammonia, silver nitrate and tert-butanol were purchased from Tianjin Guang Fu Fine Chemical Research Institute Co., Ltd., China. TPAOH solution (25 wt%) was purchased from Kente Catalysts Technologies Co., Ltd., China."
3,Synthesis of catalyst samples,"2.2 Synthesis of catalyst samples Anatase TiO2 was synthesized by a literature with modification and following procedure [36]. An amount of TiCl4 (10 mL) was slowly added to deionized water (200 mL) with vigorous stirring in an ice bath. Ammonia solution (28 wt%) was then added dropwise to the above mixture to a final pH around 9. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until no chloride ions, and dried at 393 K overnight. The obtained Ti(OH)4 were powdered (100 mesh) then calcined at 823 K for 3 h in air. TS-1 sample was synthesis described according to our previously reported method [37]. In a typical run, 0.15 mol TEOS (31.5 g), 0.0038 mol TBOT (1.29 g) and 0.13 mol dried isopropanol (7.9 g) mixed solution were slowly added into 0.036 mol TPAOH aqueous solution (15 wt%, 49.8 g) with vigorous stirring. This gel was subsequently stirred for 120 min at room temperature, which was raised to 353 K and maintained for 90 min. In this period, the weight loss of mixed solution was compensated by adding deionized water. The resulting titanium silicalite gel was further transferred into a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave with PTFE inner liner and statically crystallized at 448 K for 72 h. The crystallization product was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water to neutrality, dried at 393 K overnight, and finally calcined in air at 823 K for 5 h, the as synthesized TS-1 was denoted as TS-1-40 according to the reactant molar ratio of TEOS and TBOT (Si/Ti). Others TS-1-x samples with different Si/Ti ratio (x = 70 and 80) were also synthesized under the same condition of TS-1-40 but only change the reactant ratio of TEOS and TBOT, and the obtained samples are denoted as TS-1-70 and TS-1-80, respectively. Furthermore, the mesoporous TS-1-40 (MTS-1-40) was prepared by treating the parent TS-1-40 sample with organic base (such as TPAOH) [30]. In brief, the mass ratio of 0.05 mol L−1 TPAOH solution and TS-1-40 was 10 and reacted hydrothermally at 443 K for 24 h. The treated product was washed, dried overnight and calcined at 823 K in air for 5 h. In order to explore the reusability of TS-1 catalysts, after the epoxidation of soybean oil over fresh TS-1-40 catalyst, the used TS-1-40 catalyst sample was separated and subsequently washed with ethanol and water, and then dried at 393 K overnight for the next run, which was denoted as TS-1-40-U1. The TS-1-40-U3 catalyst was obtained after the fresh TS-1-40 catalyst was recycled 3 runs, and dried without calcined. Furthermore, to study the regeneration of TS-1 catalyst in epoxidation reaction, the TS-1-40-U1 sample was calcined at 823 K for 5 h to obtain the calcined TS-1-40 catalyst (denoted as TS-1-40-C)."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed on a RIGAKU UltimalV diffractometer with a Cu-Kα X-ray radiation source (λ = 0.154056 nm). Nitrogen physisorption (N2–adsorption) were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M apparatus. The specific surface area and pore size distribution was calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model, respectively. The elemental analysis of all samples was determined by Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000 DV inductive coupling plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of all samples was measured on a Netzsch STA 449 F3 system using a constant heating rate of 10 K min−1 from 308 K to 1173 K under flowing air atmosphere. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of all samples (KBr pellets) were obtained on a Thermo Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrometer between 400 and 4000 cm−1. Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance (UV–vis) spectra from 200 to 500 nm were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. BaSO4 was used as background standard. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a SUPRA55 apparatus and JEM-2100F microscope, respectively."
5,Epoxidation of soybean oil,"2.4 Epoxidation of soybean oil Epoxidation of SO with H2O2 as clean oxidant was carried out in a glass two-necked round-bottom flask (50 mL) equipped with a water reflux condenser, a vigorous stirring and a thermostatic circulating oil bath. Typically, 5.0 g of SO (equivalent to 25 mmol of CC double bond), 4.0 g of tert-butanol and 0.1 g of catalyst were charged to the reactor, while stirring at 700 rpm. And 6.8 g of a 30 wt% H2O2 was added into the reaction mixture solution (H2O2: double bond = 2.4:1 (molar ratio)) at the desired reaction temperature. The reaction system was operated stably at reaction temperature. The final solution and catalyst were separated by centrifugation after the epoxidation reaction. The liquid products obtained was kept in a separating funnel to separate the upper organic layer, containing the epoxidized products, and finally rotary-evaporated to yield the pure ESOs. The SO conversion was evaluated through the determination of the Iodine Value (IV), and the IV was obtained using the Wijs method [31,38]. The ESO selectivity was obtained using the GC analysis methods reported by the literature [31]. The epoxide products were derivatised, according to the Rothenbacher method [39] as follows: for transesterification, 5 mL of 6 wt% sodium methoxide solution were added in 0.10 g of the epoxide products sample and shaken vigorously for 10 min. Extraction was performed by the addition of 10 mL of n-hexane and 10 mL of 15 wt% disodium hydrogen citrate (aq.), and the organic phase was separated and analyzed for GC analysis. And the composition of fatty acids and selectivity to ESO were obtained on a GC equipped with a FID detector and FFAP capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.50 μm) with inert carrier gas (N2). Analytical conditions were as follows: injector temperature at 523 K, detector temperature at 533 K, the oven temperature was programmed from 423 K at 20 K min−1 to 473 K (2 min), at 5 K min−1 to 513 K (18 min). The residual H2O2 was measured by iodometric titration [37,40]. The catalytic activity of the catalysts was tested in epoxidation of SO. The fatty acid composition of SO (Iodine Value of 125.16 g I2/100 g sample) was obtained by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, which was as follows (wt.%): palmitic = 10.9%, stearic = 4.3%, oleic = 24.7%, linoleic = 54.5%, linolenic = 5.6%. ESO was the main target product. X S O , X H 2 O 2 and S E S O denote of SO and H2O2 conversion and selectivity to ESO, respectively, which were calculated using the following three equations (1) X S O = [ I V ] initial − [ I V ] final [ I V ] initial × 100 % (2) S E S O = n ESO X S O × n SO 0 × 100 % (3) X H 2 O 2 = n H 2 O 2 0 − n H 2 O 2 n H 2 O 2 0 × 100 % Where IV is the grams of I2 that is taken up by 100 g of the oil, and the [IV]initial and [IV]final refer respectively to IV of starting soybean oil and final reaction product. n S O 0 and n E S O are the initial mole of SO and the mole of ESO, and n H 2 O 2 0 and n H 2 O 2 are the initial and final mole content of H2O2, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization results of the catalyst samples,"3.1 Characterization results of the catalyst samples Powder XRD patterns of TiO2, MTS-1-40 and TS-1-x (x is 40, 70, 80) are shown in Fig. 1 . The simulated patterns of anatase TiO2 and TS-1 are simulated by Mercury software (V3.9) based on their reported structural information [41,42]. The characteristic MFI diffraction peaks for the TS-1 samples are sited at 2θ of 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.1°, 23.9° and 24.4°, indicating that the framework structures are not destroyed [43,44]. The diffraction pattern of TiO2 clearly indicates that the sample is pure anatase phase (JCPDS 21–1272) [45]. As shown in Table 1 , the relative crystallinity (RC) is calculated by comparing the total intensity of the five characteristic peaks with that of each sample, and the RC of TS-1-40 is chosen and set as 100% [46]. The result shows that the RC of the MTS-1-40 sample is bigger than TS-1-40 sample, because the dissolved silica may be recrystallized in the presence of TPAOH [47]. The chemical compositions and Si/Ti ratios of the TS-1 samples are measured by ICP-OES and listed in Table 1. As expected, both TS-1-40 and MTS-1-40 samples have a similar Si/Ti molar ratios, and the molar ratio generally increases with the increasing of the x in TS-1-x samples from 40 to 80. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution curves and textural properties of all samples are shown in Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 and Table 1, respectively. The TS-1-x samples still display similar type I adsorption and desorption curve, indicating the typical curve of microporous material. Moreover, the MTS-1-40 shows type H4 hysteresis loop, suggesting the formation of mesopores in this sample. In addition, the adsorption and desorption isotherms of the TiO2 sample shows type IV behavior with the typical hysteresis loop, suggesting narrow slit-shaped pores that are generally associated with plate-like particles. And the existing these pores are from the aggregation of single crystals [45]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, the pore size distribution curves show the TS-1 samples with the different Si/Ti ratio have similar pore characteristics and no mesopores. Correspondingly, the pore size centered at 3.9 and 7.5 nm is observed clearly in the MTS-1-40 and anatase TiO2, respectively. Notably, the MTS-1-40 sample (0.29 cm3 g−1) has a higher mesoporous volume than other TS-1-x samples due to the presence of many mesopores, which is in accordance with the results of N2 adsorption-desorption and pore size distribution curves (Figs. 2 and 3). The FT-IR spectra of the TiO2, MTS-1-40 and TS-1-x catalysts are given in Fig. 4 . Five main absorption bands are sited at 450, 550, 800, 1100 and 1230 cm−1 in IR spectra of all TS-1 samples, which agree with the characteristic bands of MFI topology [48]. The signals around 550 and 1230 cm−1 are assigned to the double five-membered ring unit and the MFI structure, and the characteristic bands at 450, 800 and 1100 cm−1 are attributed to the bend stretch, symmetry stretch and asymmetry stretch of SiO in the SiO4 tetrahedral unit [49,50]. Remarkably, the characteristic band at 960 cm−1 is considered that Ti substitution has been incorporated into the framework of TiOSi [51–53]. Additionally, the strong absorption observed below 850 cm−1 is due to lattice vibrations of anatase TiO2 in the IR spectra [54]. UV–vis technique is an effective method for detection of framework Ti (isolated Ti(IV) species) and extra-framework Ti in different TS-1 samples. UV–vis spectra of all samples are shown in Fig. 5 . The results clearly indicate that a typical absorption band around 210 nm for the MTS-1-40 and TS-1-x, suggesting that the Ti species are incorporated successfully into the TS-1 zeolite framework (framework Ti) [55]. Meanwhile, a broad absorption signals at 240–280 nm are attributed to octahedral coordinated Ti species, confirming the existence of two water molecules with the isolated [TiO4] or [HOTiO3] [56–58]. The absorbance intensity of these signals for the MTS-1-40 is slightly higher than that of TS-1-40, which can be attributed to more octahedral Ti species exposed on the surface of the sample particles after treating of TS-1-40 with TPAOH. Additionally, an obvious absorption peak at 330 nm of anatase TiO2 sample which is attributed to the extra-framework Ti, and these Ti species can lead to ineffective decomposition of H2O2 and reduce the utilization of H2O2 [59]. As shown in Fig. 6 , the detailed crystal structure of titanosilicalite molecular sieve and anatase TiO2 have been characterized and reported previously [41,42]. The TS-1 presents silicalite-1 (MFI) framework with a straight channel around 0.55 nm in diameter (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the powder neutron diffraction studies and theoretical calculations confirmed that the titanium atoms are nonrandom distributed in the MFI framework of TS-1 [42], and only 5 of the 12 silicon sites (Si3, Si7, Si8, Si10, and Si12) can be occupied by titanium atoms with a tetrahedral coordination geometry, which is surrounded by 4 oxygen atoms in the absence of additional substrates or ligands (Fig. 6c). Therefore, the chemical components of TS-1 (Si96-nTinO192) can be controlled by adjusting the substitution of Ti centers into the silicalite-1 (MFI) framework (n ≤ 2.5) [42]. Notably, the Ti centers in TS-1 structure could present two different types of coordination environment (Fig. 6d–e), and the catalytically active tetrahedral Ti centers are site-isolated (Fig. 6e), because the content of Ti element in Si96-nTinO192 is very low. By contrast, the titanium centers in framework of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 6b) are surrounded by 6 oxygen atoms and present distorted octahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 6f), which are totally different from the Ti centers in TS-1, which means the two materials may present different catalytic activity and properties. The SEM images of the TiO2, MTS-1-40 and TS-1-x samples are shown in Fig. 7 . The size of the uniform ellipsoids nanoparticles was approximately 220–250 nm can be seen in SEM images of TS-1-x and MTS-1-40 in Fig. 7a-c,e, and the anatase TiO2 particles with an average particle sizes of about 20 nm (Fig. 7d). It is worth mentioning that the crystal morphology and particle sizes of the used and calcined TS-1-40 samples (Fig. 7e–h) showed no obvious changes, which means these catalysts are robust catalysts. The representative TEM images were also recorded to study the micro-structure and morphology of catalyst samples. As expected, the microporous TS-1 samples exhibit a similar crystal morphology, micropore structure and particle size (Fig. 8 a–c,f-h). In contrast, Fig. 8e displays that many hollows appear in the MTS-1-40 sample, which confirms the formation of mesoporous in this titanium silicalite zeolite structure. And this result is in agreement with that obtained in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Additionally, Fig. 8d shows that a large number of secondary particle piled voids between the TiO2 nanoparticles are presented, which is also consistent with previous reference report [60]."
8,Catalytic activity test of catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic activity test of catalysts In order to investigate the catalytic performance and effects of the different catalysts for epoxidation of SO, TS-1-x, MTS-1-40 and anatase TiO2 were used as hetero-catalysts, and the catalytic reaction experiments of the SO epoxidation were investigated systematically by using H2O2 as oxidant, respectively. The catalytic performances of all catalysts in the epoxidation of SO are presented in Table 2 . The final iodine value (IV) and XSO indicate that the TS-1-40 and anatase TiO2 show similar catalytic activity, and better than the TS-1-70, TS-1-80 and MTS-1-40. This is because that the more framework Ti species are existed in TS-1-40 than that of the TS-1-70 and TS-1-80, which can improve the catalytic activity. Moreover, on the one hand, the N2 sorption analysis results (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 1) show a number of the existence of mesoporous pores and larger mesoporous volume in the MTS-1-40 catalyst, although the molecular size of SO is so big and still cannot easily diffuse through the pores in MTS-1 framework, which means the mesoporous pores didn't make much difference to promote the reaction. On the other hand, as the MTS-1-40 was prepared by treating TS-1-40 with the TPAOH solution, many amorphous Ti regions were formed on the outer surface of catalyst particles, which leads to the less useful of the framework Ti and the low SO conversion. Obviously, for the anatase TiO2 catalyst, the SESO (72.67%) is less than that of others TS-1 samples (≥83.66%) in this reaction, and the XH2O2 increases greatly and reaches 82.39%, which means that a large number of H2O2 was decomposed invalid. These results indicate the Ti species in TS-1 and TiO2 sample show different catalytic properties, and as confirmed by the UV–Vis and crystal structure, the existence of many extra-framework Ti species in anatase TiO2 could lead to the severe decomposition of H2O2 [61]."
9,Effect of reaction parameters,"3.3 Effect of reaction parameters The effects of reaction time on the IV of product, XSO, XH2O2 and SESO within 24 h are shown in Fig. S1. The epoxidation of soybean oil almost does not take place in the initial reaction stage (<4 h), and there are no ESO is detected. It is probably because the macromolecule of SO needs time to diffuse in solvent system of t-butanol/H2O2/H2O and reacts with H2O2 molecule on framework Ti species at the beginning of the reaction. With the epoxidation reaction goes on, the XSO, XH2O2 and SESO increases remarkably. Owing to the SO molecules are adsorbed and reacted gradually on the catalytic active sites, so more SO and H2O2 are consumed and greater ESO are formed, and the IV of product can be lowered accordingly. Simultaneously, the selectivity of ESO increases gradually and reaches the maximum value (88.2%) within 24 h. According to Scheme 1, due to intermediate products were formed at the beginning of the reaction and the further oxidation reaction occurs gradually, the selectivity of ESO was lower and then increased gradually during the whole reaction process. The IV of product, the conversion of SO and H2O2 and selectivity of ESO on epoxidation of SO with the H2O2/CC ratios (nH2O2:nCC) from 2.4 to 6.0 are presented in Fig. S2. The XSO and XH2O2 increases firstly and then decreases but the SESO is almost unchanged (above 88%) with the increase of the nH2O2:nCC, and the maximal XSO (62.7%) is obtained at the nH2O2:nCC of 4.0. As the rising of the nH2O2:nCC, more H2O2 are provided to generate the catalytic active center between H2O2 and TS-1-40 catalyst. It is understandable that the water content increases with the increase of H2O2(aq.) content, so a great number of water are introduced into the epoxidation reaction system at the high nH2O2:nCC (above 4), and the solubility of SO in the mixture of t-butanol/H2O2/H2O reaction system decreases with the rising of H2O2(aq.) content, which result in contact insufficient between reactants and catalyst and hinder the conversion of reactants. The effects of the TS-1-40 content (0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 g) on epoxidation of SO were investigated carefully. As shown in Fig. S3, the XSO increases remarkably from 21.2% to 40.9% as increasing catalyst content from 0.05 to 0.10 g. These results might due to more catalytic active sites are provided under the higher catalyst content, which can promote the conversion of SO. Moreover, the SO conversion remains approximately constant when the catalyst content is further improved, suggesting that the equilibrium condition is already reached. Additionally, the XH2O2 also increases from 10.5% to 35.4% but the selectivity to ESO is almost no change with the increase of the catalyst content. Actually, Yoon et al. [62] reported that a small amount of H2O2 can be decomposed on the TS-1 zeolite. Therefore, the consumption of H2O2 increases but the utilization of H2O2 reduces under the higher catalyst content. Especially, it is important that the suitable content of TS-1 catalyst is selected to avoid the invalid decomposition of H2O2 in the industrial applications of epoxidation reaction. Base on the severe ineffective decomposition of H2O2 at high temperature, the effects of reaction temperature were investigated for TS-1-40 in the range of 323–353 K. Fig. S4 shows that the SO and H2O2 conversion gradually increase from 25.4% to 19.4%–65.3% and 48.9% respectively with increasing reaction temperature, meanwhile the selectivity to ESO firstly increases rapidly and then varies little. It is well known that the catalytic activity is improved at a higher temperature, and the ineffective decomposition of H2O2 also increases under the same conditions. According to the epoxidation processes in Scheme 1, a number of the intermediate products could be obtained when the epoxidation reaction was insufficient, whereas the more ESO and less intermediate products were formed under the higher reaction temperature. The solvent usually plays an important part in hetero-catalyzed organic reaction, which can even determine reactant conversion and product selectivity. As shown in Table S1, the catalytic activity of TS-1-40 strongly depended on the solvents in the epoxidation of SO, and it does not even carry out in the absence of reaction solvents. In the solvent of acetone, methanol and hexane, the XSO is very low and close to zero. But the XSO is 40.9% and 20.7% in t-butanol and ethyl acetate, respectively. Similarly, the SESO in the t-butanol is higher than that of ethyl acetate. It is generally known that the molecule polarity of H2O2 (aq.) and SO are strong polar and weak polar, respectively. So the reaction system of SO/H2O2/H2O is insoluble and statically separated under the solvent-free, which can hinder seriously the interaction between SO and H2O2, and the epoxidation of SO with H2O2 is difficult to carry out. Furthermore, the reaction system doesn't change in the presence of strong (methanol) and weak polar solvent (acetone and hexane), but it is improved markedly when the middle polar of t-butanol and ethyl acetate as the reaction solvent. Especially, the optimal catalytic performance is obtained under the t-butanol solvent on epoxidation of SO. Additionally, compared with the solvent-free system, the XH2O2 is increased but no more than 25% in the solvent system. This means that the degradation of H2O2 alone over TS-1-40 catalyst in solvent-free is less than 6% at 333 K."
10,Reusability and regeneration behavior of TS-1 catalyst,"3.4 Reusability and regeneration behavior of TS-1 catalyst The epoxidation of SO over TS-1 catalyst is a typical liquid-solid heterogeneous catalyzed reaction. Evolution of the epoxidation performance of TS-1-40, TS-1-40-U1, TS-1-40-C and TS-1-40-U3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the highest XSO and XESO are up to 40.9% and 88.2% on the fresh TS-1-40 catalyst, respectively. Simultaneously, compared with the TS-1-40-U1 catalyst, both XSO and SESO of the TS-1-40-C catalyst are increased to 28.7% and 73.1%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the catalytic activity of TS-1-40-U1 can be recovered in some degree after it was calcined at high temperature in air. However, the epoxidation reaction does not carry out over TS-1-40-U3 catalyst which is obtained from TS-1-40 catalyst after the third cycle. That is to say, compared with the TS-1-40 and TS-1-40-C, the catalytic activity of TS-1-40-U1 decreases remarkably, the TS-1-40-U3 even has already lost catalytic activity. Therefore, in order to study the main causes for deactivation of TS-1 catalyst and the way for its regeneration in epoxidation of SO, the TS-1-40, TS-1-40-U1, TS-1-40-C and TS-1-40-U3 catalysts were fully characterized by several characterization methods. SEM and TEM images of four catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 7a, f-h and Fig. 8a, f-h, respectively. Three other samples exhibit uniform ellipsoids particles and similar surface morphology, which are just the same as that of TS-1-40 sample. It means that the crystal morphology and particle size of the catalysts is almost unchanged after epoxidation reaction. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 10 a-c, the four samples present the same MFI structure, which means the catalysts are stable in the epoxidation system. Compared with the fresh TS-1-40 catalyst, it is clear that the relative crystallinities of the used catalysts (TS-1-40-U1 and TS-1-40-U3) have an obvious decline, but the relative crystallinity of TS-1-40-C catalyst rebound to 97% (see Table 1). Some researchers believed that these activities decreases are usually attributed to structure destruction or loss of framework Ti or coke deposition of catalyst [63–65]. In this work, the XRD patterns and UV–vis spectra of the four catalysts have confirmed that the structure destruction or framework Ti loss did not occur. Additionally, the FT-IR spectra of TS-1-40-U1 and TS-1-40-U3 samples show the characteristic bands in the range of 2900–3000 cm−1 can be assigned to the saturated CH appeared, which revealed that some bulky molecular substances with saturated CH existed on the used TS-1 catalyst [66]. And this characteristic peak intensity of TS-1-40-C sample decreases greatly after calcination, which means that these bulky molecular substances can be removed effectively at the high-temperature environment. In order to further determine that the deactivation of TS-1 in epoxidation of SO is due to the deposition of bulky molecular compounds inside and outside catalyst surface. As shown in Table 1, compared to the fresh catalyst, the BET areas and pore volumes of the two used catalysts decrease, but that of the TS-1-40-C catalyst almost regenerate by high-temperature calcination. These results indicate that the majority of the channels of the used catalyst are blocked by the macromolecular compounds, but it can be removed after calcination. In addition, TGA curves of these catalysts are shown in Fig. 10d, and the weight loss slight occurs at blow 573 K for the fresh TS-1-40 catalyst, which is mainly attributed to desorption of H2O from the catalyst surface. It is seen that the TGA curves of the two used catalysts are similar and there are only distinct of weight loss in the temperature range of 350–850 K. The total weight loss of TS-1-40-U1 and TS-1-40-U3 catalysts is about 13.3% and 21.1% respectively, which are attributed to thermal decomposition of the organic compounds deposited on the used catalysts [67]. After calcination of the used catalyst, the weight loss of TS-1-40-C catalyst is very little and less than 1.6%. These TGA results are well agreed with those obtained by N2-adsorption and FT-IR. As mentioned above, combined with the experiment and characterization results of four catalysts, the major cause for catalytic activity loss of used TS-1 catalyst should arise from the pore and surface blockage of catalyst by coke deposits during the reaction, and these cokes in the used catalyst can be removed by high temperature calcinations in the regeneration process. Table 3 compares the catalytic performance of the heterogeneous catalysts reported by other researchers for ESO production, the results show that the highest SO conversion (65.27%) and ESO yield (58.89%) are obtained in this study at reaction temperature of 353 K. For comparison, Ye et al. [27] and Campanella et al. [31] reported that the slightly higher conversion of SO were obtained under similar reaction conditions, but the selectivity of ESO was very low. In addition, the poor catalytic activities were exhibited in the epoxidation reaction over Nb2O5 SiO2 and montmorillonite K10 clay-Mo catalysts [22,68]. This result therefore shows the superiority of the findings in this work in producing ESO from SO."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, a facile and green approach to produce epoxidized soybean oil by Ti-containing solid catalysts under the mild reaction conditions has been developed. A series TS-1-x (x is 40, 70 and 80), MTS-1-40 and TiO2 heterogeneous catalysts were synthesized and characterized, and their catalytic performance in the epoxidation of SO were systematically investigated. The catalytic study shows that the TS-1-x catalysts exhibit the excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity to ESO, attributing to the unique active Ti(IV) sites in the framework of TS-1, especially the TS-1-40 catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance in the epoxidation reaction. Although the TiO2 catalyst also has high catalytic activity, the severe invalid decomposition of H2O2 was occurred seriously, which could be a very obvious defect for industrial application. Additionally, the reusability and regeneration behavior of the TS-1-40 catalyst for epoxidation of SO were also studied, and an effective regeneration method of high-temperature calcination for spent TS-1 was provided, which could be very useful in the scaling up of this clean and non-acid epoxidation process for the production of ESO."
