0,Introduction,"The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol is considered to be one of the most fundamental reactions for fine chemicals production in both laboratory and industrial scale [1–4]. In previous studies, various heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for this model reaction [5,6]. Considering green chemistry principle, it is important to improve the atomic utilization of the reactants, which could also provide insights for other alcohols oxidation reactions. Supported palladium catalysts are very active for benzyl alcohol oxidation [7–11]. However, during this process other side reactions also take place and undesired byproducts are formed. Thus, the total yield of target benzaldehyde product decreases. Methods are developed to modify the active sites of the Pd catalysts by introducing promoters and nanotailoring of interfacial perimeter. Typically, metals like Bi [12], Pb [13], Au [14,15] as well as oxides such as FeOx [16,17], MnOx [18] etc., are introduced to construct composite configurations to improve the catalytic performance and prevent deactivation. For example, the Pd/Au nanocrystals show enhanced selectivity in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes due to the electronic modification of Au to Pd [14]. From previous reports, compared with single MnOx or CeO2 support, the catalytic activity and selectivity for benzyl alcohol are significantly improved by the MnCeOx composite support through the synergistic effect between Pd and MnOx/CeO2 interfaces [19]. Despite extensive studies on Pd catalysts, the description of Pd’s active sites remains controversial. Based on previous researches, metallic Pd0 species are supposed to be the active sites, and the dehydrogenation step on the Pd catalysts during alcohol selective oxidation is universal [20,21]. As discussed in detail, the activity enhancement of PdO is attributed to its reduction by benzyl alcohol to Pd0 during the reaction [22,23]. The oxidative dehydrogenation of the alcohol to aldehyde occurred on all exposed Pd surfaces is the main reaction. Meanwhile the undesired decarbonylation formation takes place preferentially at the hollow sites on Pd (1 1 1) facets. Medlin et al. [24,25] proposed that on clean Pd (1 1 1) facets, the reaction of benzyl alcohol was highly dependent on its adsorption orientation. With low adsorption coverage, benzyl alcohol presented a flat lying structure to produce CO and benzene. While with high coverage, the benzyl alcohol presented an upright structure and produced deoxygenation products such as toluene and H2O. Meanwhile, the aerobic oxidation of alcohols is affected by various coupled factors, including conversion temperature, reaction time length etc. As a result, it is extremely difficult to achieve high selectivity, conversion and reaction rate simultaneously. Generally, the over-oxidation of the reactants leads to the decreasing of target product selectivity [26]. For Au/U3O8 catalyst [27], the selectivity of target product at initial conversion stage was high. However, when increasing the reaction temperature and prolonging the reaction time, the conversion of benzyl alcohol could be increased, but the selectivity of benzaldehyde decreased drastically. In this work, an atomically manganese oxide decorated Pd nanoparticles structure is designed and fabricated via atomic layer deposition (ALD). In the ALD process, two gaseous precursors are dosed alternately on the substrates. The self-limiting nature provides the advantages of depositing materials with atomic-scale control. Catalysts prepared by ALD show enhanced conversion and selectivity simultaneously, thus a high yield of target product benzaldehyde is obtained. The method enables an effective way to investigate the composite nanoparticles’ structure-property relationship. The reaction pathways are changed on ALD decorated Pd catalysts. Pd (1 1 1) facets are selectively passivated by MnOx deposition to eliminate the byproduct toluene formation. Toluene products are not observed for modified catalysts. On the other hand, the reversed oxides coating structure (compared with the oxides supported catalysts) enriches the active metal-oxide interfaces. Meanwhile, the addition of MnOx can modify the electronic structure of Pd which increases the surface concentration of metallic Pd0 species. Therefore, catalytic activity and reaction rate are also improved. The TOF of MnOx coated Pd catalyst reaches 31,561 h−1, which is 8.7 times larger than that of bare Pd catalyst. Moreover, this structure is also beneficial for inhibiting the decarbonylation reaction of benzaldehyde, further improving the yield of target product. The maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol and yield of benzaldehyde are improved to 84.7% and 76.5% respectively."
1,Experiments,
2,Catalysts fabrication,"2.1 Catalysts fabrication Al2O3 supported palladium catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. 18.09 wt% palladium nitrate dihydrate was impregnated into Al2O3 (99.99%, metals basic). The loading of palladium was fixed to 2 wt%. The sample was placed at room temperature for 24 h and dried at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. Then the sample was ground and calcined at 500 °C in the air for 3 h, and naturally cooled to room temperature. The bare Pd catalyst was denoted as Pd/Al2O3. A rotary ALD reactor coupled with fluidization was utilized to deposit MnOx on the powder Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The cylindrical sample holder enables dynamic fluidization of the catalysts by dosing constant N2 flow into the reactor. The rotation of sample holder is beneficial to improve the uniformity and stable fluidization of particles. Manganese oxide ALD approach was performed with Tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)manganese(III) (manganese source, Strem Chemicals, 99%) and ozone (oxygen source) as precursors. O3 was produced by high-purity oxygen (99.999%) through an ozone generator (11% vol. of O3 in O2). The deposition temperature was 150 °C, and the manganese source was heated at 133 °C and carried by N2 with mass flow of 35 sccm dosing into the reactor. In one ALD cycle, the MnOx ALD sequence consisted of a 200 s dosing of Tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)manganese(III) (Mn(thd)3) and a 200 s dosing of ozone. 200 s purge with N2 flow was introduced between the reactants doses to remove the physically adsorbed precursors. The MnOx coated Pd catalyst was labeled as MnOx/Pd/Al2O3. Meanwhile, MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 (co-impregnation) catalyst prepared by co-impregnation method was used as a reference sample, the Mn loading for this sample is 0.2 wt%."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were performed using an EAGLE III(EDAX Inc.) Explorer spectrometer to determine the composition of the catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) were examined with 2θ values, utilizing X-ray Powder diffractometer (Empyrean, PANalytical B.V.), automatic divergence slits and Cu Kα1/2 1/a2 radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Scan mode: continuous; step range: 10–80° 2θ; step size: 0.0131° and counting time: 27.8 s/step. The phase composition of the catalysts was estimated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TG-DTA) in nitrogen atmosphere using Diamond TG/DTA produced by PerkinElmer Instruments. For this analysis, 5 mg of fresh catalyst was heated from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FTEM) (Tecnai G2 F30) was performed to characterize the morphology and crystal structure of the catalysts. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory. The spectra were recorded in the range of 200–1000 nm at room temperature with air as reference. The Raman spectra were obtained for the fresh catalysts from a LabRAM HR800 spectrometer (Horiba JobinYvon) at room temperature (RT) equipped with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser beam. The composition and binding energies were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation. Accurate binding energies (±0.1 eV) were calibrated with respect to the position of the adventitious C 1s peak at 285 eV. The in situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption on catalysts were collected by a wide-band mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT-A) detector, which was deployed on a Nicolet iS50 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The O2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was also carried out by the AMI-300, where the catalysts were first treated at 200 °C under He atmosphere with 10% of O2 (30 ml·min−1). When the baseline of O2 signal in TCD maintained stable, the temperature was programmed to increase from 40 °C to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min−1 and TCD signal was recorded at the same time."
4,Catalytic performance tests,"2.3 Catalytic performance tests The solvent-free selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was performed under atmosphere pressure. 100 mg catalyst was dispersed in 5 ml benzyl alcohol in a three-necked batch reactor with a reflux condenser under stirring. The suspension was kept at 393 K with oxygen bubbled in at a flow-rate 20 ml/min. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the solution by centrifugation and the products were analyzed and identified by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent Technologies 7890B with a 0.32 mm × 30 m HP-5 capillary column, He carrier). GC–MS analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies 7890A GC system equipped with an Agilent Technologies 5975C MSD Mass Spectrometer. The external standard method was employed to calculate benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde selectivity. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity toward benzaldehyde were defined as follows: conversion ( % ) =100\% × moles of reactant converted moles of reactant in feed selectivity ( % ) =100\% × moles of product formed moles of reactant converted"
5,Results and discussions,
6,Phase and dispersion of catalysts,"3.1 Phase and dispersion of catalysts The MnOx coating structures are fabricated with 1, 2, 4, 6 MnOx ALD cycles, respectively. With XRF calibration, the coating thickness (ALD cycles) is converted to MnOx loading of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 wt%, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Al2O3, bare Pd nanoparticles and MnOx-decorated Pd nanocatalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . Typical diffraction peaks correspond to Al2O3 support (JCPDS 29-1486, 2θ = 37.8, 45.7 and 67.1) are observed in all Pd/Al2O3 samples. Additionally, for bare Pd catalyst, the well-defined diffraction peaks centered at 2θ = 33.8 and 54.7 reveal the presence of Pd oxide species (JCPDS 41-1107). Meanwhile, there are no obvious diffraction peaks of metallic Pd phase (JCPDS46-1043, 2θ = 40.2, 46.8 and 68.3) for the bare Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, for the MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, no remarkable diffraction peaks of MnOx are observed, which may be explained by the fact that the MnOx is highly dispersed with ultralow loading. With increasing MnOx loading, the intensity of the Pd0 reflection band located at 2θ = 40.2 also increases as shown in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of Pd oxide slightly decrease as MnOx coating amount increases (Fig. 1c), indicating that the concentration of metallic Pd0 phases increases after the MnOx ALD process. In order to analyze the phase of the catalysts before and after MnOx decoration, DTA-TG tests are performed from room temperature to 800 °C for Pd/Al2O3 and MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in nitrogen. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the weight loss before 400 °C with the endothermic peak located at ~140 °C can be attributed to the removal of physiosorbed water and chemically bonded water [28]. Removal of residual nitrates is reflected in the TG/DTA in higher temperature range of above 400 °C for Pd/Al2O3 [29]. Detail weight loss in TG curves indicates the thermal decomposition of unreacted metal organic Mn(thd)3 precursor occurs at 250–400 °C for MnOx/Pd/Al2O3. Particularly, two broad endothermic peaks in the 400–600 °C and 600–700 °C are observed for 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 2(b)), which can be attributed to the decomposition of MnO2 to Mn2O3 and the transformation of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, respectively [30]. The results reveal the coexistence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ species in ALD-coated samples. However, the endothermic peaks of the 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalyst are not clear, probably due to the low loading of MnOx that below the detection limit. The FTEM images of Pd/Al2O3, 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 and 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 3 (a)(b)(c), the Pd species on the support cannot be observed clearly due to low magnification and contrast. Meanwhile, Pd nanoparticles with large diameter are not observed, indicating the highly dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. HAADF-STEM measurements are performed to investigate the MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 samples in dark field mode. As shown in Fig. 3 (d) (e) (f), the Pd nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the Al2O3 support, and the average size is 3.62 ± 0.72 nm for uncoated Pd sample. The particle sizes for 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 (3.62 ± 0.32 nm), 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 (3.69 ± 0.30 nm) and the bare Pd catalyst are very similar, indicating that the ALD process has minimal influence on the Pd particles size. The HRTEM images of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3(g)(h)(i). The Pd nanoparticles are crystalline with a lattice fringe distance of 2.64 Å for PdO phases and 2.25 Å for metallic Pd phases. From statistical analysis, the amount of metallic Pd phases for MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts is larger than that of the unmodified Pd/Al2O3 catalysts."
7,Decoration configuration of MnOx on Pd,"3.2 Decoration configuration of MnOx on Pd In order to reveal the decoration structure of MnOx on Pd, infrared spectroscopy using carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption as probe is performed. FTIR spectroscopy of CO chemisorption on Pd is very sensitive to the exposed palladium terraces and step edges. Therefore, it provides us with direct information about the available palladium active sites in the catalytic reaction. Fig. 4 (a) shows the FTIR spectra of CO saturated adsorption on Pd/Al2O3 and MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 at room temperature. For the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, a strong band at 2090 cm−1 and four weak bands at 2170, 2120, 1990 and 1930 cm−1 can be observed. The band at 2090 cm−1 can be assigned to atop-bonded CO on the Pd (1 1 1) defects, while the band at 1930 cm−1 can be assigned to bridge-bonded CO on Pd (1 1 1). Additionally, the band at 1990 cm−1 is attributed to bridge-bonded CO on Pd (1 0 0) [31–36]. The band at 2170 cm−1 is assigned to linear-bonded CO on ionic Pd2+ and band at 2120 cm−1 is related to linear-bonded CO on ionic Pd+ [31]. From the discussions of previous XRD tests, Pd oxide species can be observed in Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. While partial Pd oxide species can be reduced to Pd0 and Pd+ during the CO adsorption process [31]. Therefore, for bare Pd catalysts, metallic Pd0 species are observed after CO chemisorption. With increasing MnOx loading, the peaks assigned to Pd2+ and Pd+ gradually decrease for MnOx decorated Pd samples. As the loading of MnOx increases, the band intensity at 2090 cm−1 (atop-bonded CO on the Pd (1 1 1) defects) sharply decreases, whereas the relative band intensity at 1990 cm−1 (bridge-bonded CO on Pd (1 0 0)) increases with less cycles (1–2 cycles). And the adsorption peak intensity of CO on the Pd (1 1 1) and Pd (1 0 0) facets is quantified and normalized. As summarized in Table S1, the percentages of adsorbed CO on the {1 1 1} facets of Pd particles are 100%, 8%, 3%, 2%, and 1% for Pd/Al2O3, 0.1 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, 0.4 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, and 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, respectively. The percentages of adsorbed CO at the {1 0 0} facets of Pd particles are 11%, 100%, 85%, 41%, and 28% for Pd/Al2O3, 0.1 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, 0.4 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, and 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, respectively. With increasing MnOx ALD cycles, the band intensity at 2090 cm−1 (atop-bonded CO on the Pd (1 1 1) defects) disappears due to the covering of Pd (1 1 1) surface, while the band at 1990 cm−1(bridge-bonded CO on Pd (1 0 0)) still exists (Fig. 4(b)). The results indicate that MnOx deposition rate on the Pd(1 1 1) facets is faster, while leaves Pd (1 0 0) facets exposed. The facet selectivity growth is realized through different binding energy of Mn precursor chemisorbed on different Pd surface sites. Similar facet-selective ALD approach is also reported for CeOx (exploiting Ce(thd)4 and O3 as precursors) growth on Pt nanoparticles. During the initial deposition stage, CeOx is also highly preferred to nucleate on the Pt (1 1 1) facet [37]. At the same time, the results show that the MnOx modified Pd prepared by the co-impregnation method as a reference sample has no selective coating properties, in which MnOx randomly blocks the Pd’s surface sites that reduce the CO chemisorption intensity homogeneously. The comparison demonstrates the unique advantages of ALD fabrication method, which enables directional and selective modification of Pd’s surface active sites and facets."
8,Surface chemical state of the catalysts,"3.3 Surface chemical state of the catalysts The UV–Vis spectra provide additional information about the electronic state of Pd and MnOx in the catalysts. The ionic state of Pd can be determined in the ultraviolet–visible spectrum [38]. Yet metallic Pd0 is characterized by absorption without a defined structure in all range of the spectrum [38]. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), differences have been observed in diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectra between the Pd/Al2O3 and the MnOx/Pd/Al2O3. According to the results, two absorption bands at 237 nm and 415 nm are observed for the Pd/Al2O3, and these two bands can be attributed to the dπ-pπ charge transfer transition between Pd and O and the d–d transition of small PdO particles, respectively [39,40]. Moreover, the elemental Mn exhibits a broad absorption peak in the visible and ultraviolet regions, and the center of the main band is located at ~295 nm [41]. The absorption between 240 nm and 305 nm can be attributed to O2− → Mn2+ and O2− → Mn3+ charge transfer transitions, respectively. The continuous absorption of the visible region is related to the d → d transition on the Mn3+ cation [41]. It reveals that after MnOx deposition on Pd, the absorption strength of the Pd species decreases, but the absorption band at 300 nm is broadened. These facts are probably related to the electronic interaction between Pd species and MnOx. The Raman spectra of the Pd/Al2O3 and MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts are plotted in Fig. 5(b). In the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the main Raman band appears at 644 cm−1, which is attributed to the B1g mode of PdO [42]. And the band at ~280 cm−1 is probably assigned to 2X8(LA) and 2X6(TA) mode of PdO [43]. After MnOx deposition, the band of PdO gradually decreases as the loading of MnOx increases. It is noted that the intensity of the band assigned to the PdO species is progressively decreases along with a red shift from 644 cm−1 to about 630 cm−1. In particular, the peak centered at approximately 630 cm−1 is instead the Raman contribution of the MnOx species [44]. The Raman spectra of MnOx deposited on Al2O3 and silicon wafer are shown in Fig. S1. The position of the Raman peaks is consistent with the literature reports. The band between 630 and 644 cm−1 is the result of the superposition of two species. However, the MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 prepared by the co-impregnation method has no obvious electronic interaction compared to the samples fabricated by ALD, which indicates that the electronic regulation of Pd by MnOx occurs in the ALD process. This may be due to strong binding between the Mn precursors and the Pd particles thus increasing the interaction between Pd and MnOx decoration layer. The surface chemical states of Pd and MnOx species are investigated with XPS measurements. The XPS core level of Pd 3d and Mn 2p are scanned and the deconvoluted XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 6 . The surface compositions and amounts are summarized in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 6(a), before benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction, the peaks at 335.9, 337.2, 341.2 and 342.5 eV can be observed for MnOx/Pd/Al2O3, respectively. The peaks at 335.9 and 341.15 eV are assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd0, while the peaks at 337.2 and 342.5 eV are assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Pd2+ species [45–47]. Only Pd2+ is presented for the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. While Pd 3d peaks can be deconvoluted to two oxidation states for MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, indicating the mixture of metallic Pd0 state and Pd2+ state in MnOx-ALD decorated catalysts. Notably, the fraction of Pd0 increases with ALD cycles of MnOx. The Mn(thd)3 precursor itself is an active reducing agent due to its unsaturated ligands. Electron transfer between intimately contacted Pd and Mn(thd)3 precursor occurs. The chemisorbed -thd ligands react with the surface oxygen species on Pd nanoparticles and reduce Pd species to metallic Pd0. During ozone exposure to the reactor, the O3 also reacts with the residual -thd groups on Pd and oxidize the -thd groups to produce gaseous reactants such as CO, CO2, H2O etc. and purged out of the reactor. Thus, the metallic Pd0 species are obtained during ALD. Meanwhile, it is also observed that a very small amount of oxidized Pd species exist for the MnOx coated catalysts. However, the results provide clear evidence that Pd is reduced during the ALD process, and the content of metallic Pd0 is much higher compared with the uncoated Pd and MnOx/Pd catalysts prepared with co-impregnation method. On the other hand, although the presence of mixed MnOx (Mn3+, Mn4+) species cannot be detected with XRD, non-stoichiometric MnOx exhibits several oxidation states. In Fig. 6b, the Mn 2p3/2 peak can be decomposed into Mn4+ (643.8 eV) and Mn3+ (641.9 eV) [48]. As the loading of MnOx increases, the amount of Mn4+ increases slightly. The electronic interaction that occurs at the interfacial perimeter of Pd and MnOx tunes the electronic properties of catalysts."
9,Oxygen migration at the MnOx-Pd interfaces,"3.4 Oxygen migration at the MnOx-Pd interfaces Fig. 7 is the O2-TPD patterns of the catalysts. All the oxygen desorption peaks of Pd/Al2O3 can be divided into three regions, low temperature oxygen desorption peaks in the range of 50–200 °C and high temperature oxygen desorption peaks in the range of 200–500 °C. Typically, the low temperature desorption peak (50–200 °C) can be assigned to the oxygen adsorbed on the surface of Pd nanoclusters [49–51]. The high temperature oxygen desorption peak (200–500 °C) can be assigned to the oxygen generated by peroxide of Pd during dissociating at high temperature [51,52]. For the MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 samples, both the low temperature desorption peak and the high temperature desorption peak shift to lower temperature, and the intensity increases significantly compared to the bare Pd/Al2O3 sample. Due to the different surface morphology of Pd/Al2O3, the palladium superoxides and peroxides formed on the surface are different, which will also cause the difference of the high temperature oxygen desorption peak. Therefore, the change in the peak shape of the high temperature oxygen desorption peak indicates that the surface morphology has changed. The structure of the supported palladium catalyst has been fine-tuned. Consequently, the modification of MnOx improves the oxygen migration ability of the catalysts, which is another reason for the enhanced catalytic activity [53]."
10,Catalytic performance,"3.5 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of the Pd/Al2O3 and MnOx decorated Pd are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8 (a), a MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is prepared with co-impregnation method and tested as a reference sample. The unmodified Pd/Al2O3 catalyst shows the lowest conversion of benzyl alcohol (72.03%) at 120 °C. Meanwhile, the conversion of benzyl alcohol increases first and then decreases as the loading of MnOx increases for the MnOx decorated Pd catalyst prepared by ALD. As the loading of MnOx is less than 0.2 wt%, the activity is significantly improved. The main reason is that the concentration of Pd0 is increased. The enhanced oxygen migration ability also promotes the conversion of benzyl alcohol, which is confirmed by the O2-TPD tests. Under the same experimental conditions, the reference catalyst prepared by impregnation method has lower catalytic activity and selectivity compared with ALD method. According to the Raman measurements, MnOx has no obvious electronic interaction with Pd for the sample prepared by co-impregnation approach. Meanwhile, for the catalysts prepared with ALD method, it is important to precisely control the coating configurations, as the loading of MnOx further increases, more Pd sites on the catalyst surface are covered. Hence, the activity of the reaction and the selectivity of benzaldehyde decrease again. For the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol reaction, the target product is benzaldehyde, other by-products include toluene, benzoic acid, benzyl benzoate and benzene. The products distribution after reaction is shown in Table 2. Among the transition metal oxides, manganese oxide (MnOx) is reported to be effective for catalytic oxidation, since it contains labile oxygen, which is necessary to complete the catalytic redox cycle for benzylic oxidation [54]. Therefore, the MnOx added via both the co-impregnation and ALD approaches in this work promotes the further oxidation of toluene that reduces its formation. While the addition of MnOx to Pd via ALD effectively eliminates the conversion to toluene. No toluene is observed for MnOx coated Pd samples by ALD (Fig. 8b). In addition to the effects of MnOx decoration described above, it might be attributed to the selective passivation of the Pd(1 1 1) facets by MnOx prepared by ALD, as explained by the DRIFTS results. Since Pd (1 1 1) is an active facet for toluene formation. A high conversion of benzyl alcohol can be achieved and improved to 84.72% for the 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. At the same time, the maximum yield of benzaldehyde (76.54%) is achieved, which is higher than a series of state-of-the-art researches (Table S2) on Pd-based catalysts ever reported. Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is extremely difficult. The catalytic selectivity of a few catalysts from previous reports is higher than our work (Table S2) due to the short reaction time or low reaction temperature. Further increasing the conversion will decrease the selectivity, which may be caused by the over-oxidation of the reactants. As the temperature or the reaction time increases, benzaldehyde is further converted into other by-products, thus the total yield decreases."
11,Mechanisms discussion,"3.6 Mechanisms discussion The product distribution is complex for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under practical working conditions. The reactivity and products selectivity are affected by various experimental parameters such as alcohol concentration, oxygen concentration and temperature [55,56]. The effects of reactants depletion with temperature are further studied with kinetic insight, the conversions of benzyl alcohol of the catalysts at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S2. The TOF values (shown in Table S3) are also obtained, TOF values are calculated with the formula TOF = n m ∗ t , the n refers to the molar amount of reactants converted during time t, and m is the number of active sites available on the surface. The TOF values are measured after 1 h reaction, the conversions of benzyl alcohol are all lower than 20% for the catalysts. The corresponding conversion values of benzyl alcohol versus time are exhibited in Fig. S3. The number of active sites available on the surface are calculated based on the Pd nanoparticles dispersion for uncoated Pd catalyst. For the MnOx coated Pd catalysts, the exposure percentage of the Pd surface is calculated based on FTIR measurements with carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption as probe (shown in Table S3). The number of exposed Pd sites (not covered by MnOx) are considered as active sites for MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The TOF of 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at 120 °C is 31,561 h−1, which is 8.7 times larger than that of the unmodified Pd catalyst. Here, DRIFTS CO chemisorption measurements indicate that the number of Pd active sites reduces after MnOx deposition. Therefore, the improvement of TOF can be attributed to the formation of the highly active MnOx-Pd interfaces, as indicated by the surface chemical state analysis and H2-TPR characterizations (Fig. S4). The higher content of the metallic Pd0 phase and the improved oxygen migration ability are beneficial for the enhancement of activity. Arrhenius plots of the TOF values give the apparent activation energies (Ea) of 45.98 kJ/mol for 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 catalyst which is reduced more than half of 122.96 kJ/mol for Pd/Al2O3 (Fig. S5, 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3 is also the lowest compared with 83.06 kJ/mol for 0.6 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3). The conversion of benzyl alcohol and catalytic selectivity to benzaldehyde are improved simultaneously, and a high reaction rate (TOF) is achieved. The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol is considered as surface-limited-reaction. The elimination of β-H on the surface is the rate-determining step [57]. The large decrease of Ea may indicate that the elimination of β-H and replenishment of reactive oxygen species are much easier for 0.2 wt%MnOx/Pd/Al2O3. Based on the above analysis, the mechanism of solvent-free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol over MnOx decorated Pd catalysts is explained as follows (Fig. 9 ): for bare Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, benzyl alcohol is first adsorbed on the Pd, and a Pd atom is located between the O-H of the alcohol to form a metal alkoxide and a metal hydride (adsorbed on adjacent Pd atoms); then, a hydrogen atom is removed by the surface Pd atom through the β-H elimination process to form benzaldehyde; finally, the adsorbed hydrogen is oxidized by absorbed oxygen to regenerate the Pd active sites. However, for the MnOx modified catalysts, during the deposition of MnOx on catalysts surfaces, electron transfer between intimately contacted Pd and Mn(thd)3 precursor occurs. In terms of this view, the electrons inherently are donated to the electron-deficient Pd sites. As a result, more Pd0 species are exposed, which is beneficial for the adsorption of benzyl alcohol. At the same time, molecular oxygen is adsorbed on MnOx and activated to adsorb the H atom of the metal alkoxide formation process and the H atom of the β-H elimination process to form benzaldehyde and H2O. The addition of MnOx enhances oxygen adsorption and activation and it is reported that different oxygen adsorption properties significantly affect catalytic performance [58]. Selective passivation of Pd(1 1 1) facet by MnOx inhibits the decarbonylation of benzaldehyde and eliminates the formation of toluene. While for MnOx coated Pd catalyst prepared via co-impregnation method, MnOx is randomly dispersed on Pd surface. Thus the toluene formation cannot be avoided."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, an atomically MnOx decorated Pd nanoparticles structure is designed and fabricated via ALD. The ALD prepared catalysts show enhanced activity and selectivity simultaneously, thus a high yield of benzaldehyde is obtained. The MnOx coating structures selectively passivate Pd (1 1 1) facets to prevent decarbonylation reaction of benzaldehyde and eliminate the formation of toluene. Meanwhile, MnOx fabricated via ALD forms strong binding with the Pd particles, which increases the MnOx-Pd interactions and O migration at interfaces. The addition of MnOx via ALD also increases the active metallic Pd0 species concentration. Both effects result in the enhancement of the catalytic activity and reaction rate. The TOF of MnOx decorated Pd catalyst reaches 31,561 h−1, which is 8.7 times larger than that of the unmodified Pd catalyst. Meanwhile, the maximum conversion of benzyl alcohol and yield of benzaldehyde are improved to 84.7% and 76.5% respectively."
