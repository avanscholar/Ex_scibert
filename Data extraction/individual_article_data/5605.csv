0,Introduction,"Environmental and energetic crisis have been gained considerable interdisciplinary attention recent years. Hydrogen is an ideal alternative energy source as substitute for fossil fuels and is currently considered to represent a clean and renewable future energy source. Solar-driven photochemical, in which water is splitted to produce hydrogen and oxygen using semiconductor photocatalyst, is a potential mean of directly obtaining renewable hydrogen [1]. Therefore, searching and optimizing highly efficient photocatalysts have invigorated growing awareness. Since Wang et al. first reported the pioneering study that using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, CN) as photocatalyst to drive water splitting in 2009 [2], the graphite-like metal-free layered material with a visible-light driven bandgap (∼2.67 eV) and proper band edges has emerged as a new class of photocatalyst [3,4], especially for water splitting under sunlight irradiation [5,6]. In fact, the photocatalytic activity of C3N4 is mainly affected by its surface area and crystallinity. Higher surface area can provide more accessible sites for photochemical reactions, while the eliminating grain boundary defects on modified C3N4 with high crystallinity could significantly decrease the photoexcited charge carrier recombination [7]. The crystallinity and nitrogen content of the carbon nitride was mainly dictated by the polymerization degree of the nitrogenous precursors. However, the bulk g-C3N4 synthesized by calcining melamine at high-temperature usually shows a relatively low photocatalytic activity, which can be ascribed to the imperfect C3N4 crystallinity forming by the incomplete deamination or polymerization of the precursor [8]. At present, many strategies, such as band gap engineering [9,10], surface carbon defects designing [11], heteroatoms introducing [12] [13], morphology controlling [14], semiconductors coupling [15], have been used to improve the photoactivity of C3N4 to satisfy the needs of practical applications [16,17]. However, few studies have been performed focusing on the structure engineering that constructing higher surface area and simultaneously reducing the boundary defects of the carbon nitride. Recently, except from non-metal [18] and metal dopant [19,20], a simple methanol reflux method was proposed to increase the active lattice face and eliminate surface defects [7]. In addition, 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol was used to manipulate the structure engineering process suggested by Yu et al. [21]. However, the extra organic additives required and difficult handling conditions make each of these strategies more complex. Herein, we designed a highly crystalline C3N4 with higher surface area and reduced lattice defects by the steam engraved strategy. The pristine C3N4 was separated with water by a crucible and further hydrothermal treatment under assigned temperature and period, as illustrated in Scheme 1 . It is well known that the water is often used for exfoliation of C3N4 into single or few layered C3N4 under ultrasonic conditions for dozens of hours, and it could effectively engrave the C3N4 to nanosheets structure with more surface sites exposed [22,23]. However, more surprisingly, in our case, the optimally treated C3N4 exhibits rod morphology (labelled as Rod-C3N4, while the pristine C3N4 was labelled as Bulk-C3N4 for comparison) with enhanced surface area, reduced defects, meliorative energy band configuration."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Reconstructed texture,"2.1 Reconstructed texture A reconstructed texture is observed by structure engineering process. Fig. 1 a and b show the SEM images of pristine and treated C3N4. A massy morphology is observed for pristine C3N4 (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1), while the engraved sample shows mainly in nanorods shape (Fig. 1b). When the engraved time is controlled up to 12 h, the Rod-C3N4 are 0.5–1 μm in length and 100–150 nm in diameter (Fig. 1c). The HRTEM shows a distinct interplanar spacing with 0.209 nm marked in Fig. 1d corresponding to the (002) plane of Rod-C3N4, which is lower than that of traditional C3N4 (0.325 nm), indicating that the Rod-C3N4 has higher crystallinity. Obviously, it can be seen that the water-engraved C3N4 have a much higher surface area per unit mass. To confirm this hypothesis, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. 1e) are obtained for the two samples. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of steam-engraved C3N4 is much higher than that of pristine C3N4 (21.1 vs. 8.3 m2 g−1)."
3,Enhanced crystallinity,"2.2 Enhanced crystallinity XRD characterizations (Fig. 2 a) were performed to observe the crystalline change before and after the steam treatment. Both C3N4 have distinct diffraction peaks at 27.4°, which can be indexed as (002) diffraction for graphitic C3N4 materials, representing interfacial stacking of g-C3N4 sheets. The diffraction peak at 13.0° can be indexed as (100), representing in-plane packing. These two diffraction peaks show that C3N4 still remained a layer structure after steam engraving. Compared with the pristine one, the (002) diffraction peak of Rod-C3N4 shifts to higher angle after treatment, indicating a slight decrease in interlayer stacking distance and an increase of interlayer stacking density cause by the stream engraving. These results are highly agreed with previous studies [7,24]. In addition, the narrower and sharper peaks suggest that steam can react with pristine C3N4 during the engraving process, causing the increase of ordered structures within the framework [8,25]. More surprisingly, a new peak at 6.3°,attributed to the crystal plane (001), is appeared after steam engraving. The diffraction peaks at about 11, 20–26 and 31° are observed for Rod-C3N4, while no peak showed at this position for Bulk-C3N4. According to the study by Bai et al. which show a simple methanol reflux method to construct a higher crystallinity C3N4, the diffraction peaks at about 11, 20–26 and 31° implied a high purity and crystallinity of Rod-C3N4 [7]. The chemical structure changes were analyzed by FTIR spectra, as presented in Fig. 2b. The basic atomic structure shows no obvious change since both samples exhibit the typical IR patterns of g-C3N4 [5,25]. A broad peak at around 3000–3500 cm−1 for the stretching vibrations of -NHx and -OH reveal the existence of primary/secondary amines and surface absorbed water. Meanwhile, the sharp absorption band centered at 810 cm−1 originating from the breathing mode of triazine units indicates the existence of the basic melon units with -NH/-NH2 groups [24,26]. Additionally, the bands observe in the region of 900–1800 cm−1 are the typical vibrations of C-N and C-N-C bonds, which associates with the skeletal stretching modes of aromatic rings [27]. Obviously, the peak at 810 cm−1 shifts toward higher frequency after steam engraving, suggesting the enhanced crystallinity of Rod-C3N4 [24]. Both XRD and IR results indicate that the intrinsic structure of C3N4 is not changed by steam engraving, although a better crystallinity of C3N4 was obtained. Different treating time was also investigated to optimize the engraved conditions and the XRD, IR and SEM results are shown in Fig. S2-S4 in supporting information. It can be found that the crystallinity of C3N4 increased with increased engraving time, as indicated by the enhancing intensity of the typical XRD peaks over time in Fig. S2. In addition, the peak at around 810 cm−1 in the FTIR results gradually shift toward higher frequency (Fig. S3) as treated time increased, which also illustrating the increased crystallinity of C3N4 [24]. It is interesting that the morphology becomes more pronounced and partially longer when the engraving time was lengthened to 24 h or 48 h (Fig. S4). We assume that the morphology alteration from an irregular C3N4 to Rod-C3N4 type and further to larger clavate-like structure may be due to an exfoliation and regrowth process, which could eliminate the lattice defect and enhance the surface area of pristine C3N4. No obvious structure transform from pristine to better crystallinity was occurred under 140 °C till 24 h steam engraving (Fig. S5), indicating that the degree of engraving is temperature and time dependent. Since the photocatalysis reaction mainly occurs on the catalysts surface, it is essential to investigate the surface properties of C3N4 before and after high temperature water treatment. In addition, it is crucial to illustrate the merit of this lattice engineering process. In XPS results, the survey spectra (Fig. 2c and d and Fig. S6) show the presence of C, N and O in both samples. The fine-scanned C 1s, N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra of the pristine and engraved C3N4 exhibit a similar peak tendency. That is, the chemical composition and coordination of carbon and nitrogen in Rod-C3N4 are retained during the steam-engraving process, which is highly agreed with the XRD and IR results. Compared to pristine C3N4 (C/N = 0.52), the Rod-C3N4 exhibits a lower C/N molar ratio of 0.44, as analyzed by elemental analysis (Table S1). For C 1s spectra (Fig. 2c), the peaks at 284.6 and 287.4 eV arise from sp2-hybridized C-C bonds and sp2-hybridized C in aromatic skeleton rings of C3N4 (N-C=N), respectively [3,28]. Obviously, the C1s binding energy of N-C=N shifts from 287.4 eV for Bulk-C3N4 to 287.7 eV for Rod-C3N4. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the extra electrons redistribution of the engraved C3N4 [24]. To get further insight into the surface properties, the N 1s spectra of both pristine and steam-engraved C3N4 were fitted to investigate the N atoms with different joints. As shown in Fig. 2d, the N 1s peaks at 398.5, 400.3 and 401.3 eV could attribute to sp2-hybridized pyridinic-N species in triazine rings (C-N=C) (labelled as N1), tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 groups (labelled as N2) and terminal amino groups (-N-H) (labelled as N3), respectively [14,29,30]. It was worth noting that a peak at 404.3 eV arising from π-excitation is emerged in Rod-C3N4 (labelled as N4). The relative ratio of N3 on the C3N4 surface could be obtained by comparing the area that the fitted curve covered area, and the results are shown in Table S1. It could be clearly observed that the ratio of N3 groups on the steam-engraved C3N4 is lower than that of pristine C3N4. Interestingly, the peak area ratio of N3 to N2 decreased from 0.22 for pristine C3N4 to 0.20 for Rod-C3N4, indicating the loss of uncondensed terminal N-H species during steam-engraved process to obtain highly crystalline C3N4 [24,31]. Since N-H species contents can reflect the basicity of materials, CO2-TPD measurement was applied and the resultant profiles are given in Fig. S7. The desorption peak centered at 190 °C could be ascribed to the basic sites associated with weak chemical adsorption [32]. The Rod-C3N4 shows slightly weak CO2 desorption and lower desorption temperature than pristine one, implying that basic sites in the Rod-C3N4 are decrease. In addition, it is well known that a g value of 2.003 in EPR pattern can be attributed to unpaired electrons on the sp2-carbon atoms of the aromatic rings. The feeble spin intensity of the Rod-C3N4 (exhibits a g value in 2.003) gives evidence for the reduction of unpaired electrons (Fig. S8) [33], which further confirmed the highly crystalline of Rod-C3N4. Here, a higher crystallinity was successfully synthesized by our steam engraved process. Previous study revealed that eliminating the lattice defects of C3N4 will result in improvement of the conductivity of the photo-excited electrons [7,31]."
4,Meliorative energy band configuration,"2.3 Meliorative energy band configuration The optical properties were investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Fig. 3 a). Rod-C3N4 shows no obvious shift of absorption edge compared with bulk-C3N4. Their band gaps are calculated using Eq. (1) and the results are shown in Table S2 in supporting informations: (1) α = A(hν−Eg)1/2/hν where α is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h is the Planck's constant, Eg is the band energy, ν is the incident light frequency. The corresponding Kubelka-Munk transformed reflectance spectra are shown in the inset in Fig. 3a. The calculated bandgap energies are 2.65 and 2.69 eV for Bulk-C3N4 and Rod-C3N4, respectively. The bandgap widening can be further confirmed by the blue-shift of the photoluminescence emission peak from 450 nm for Bulk-C3N4 to 440 nm for Rod-C3N4 (Fig. 3c) [10]. The valence band (VB) position changes from +1.73 eV for Bulk-C3N4 to +1.62 eV for Rod-C3N4 (Fig. 3b), which may be due to the increased content of better crystallinity nitrogen species in Rod-C3N4 [34]. The DRS results together with the VB-XPS analysis give the conduction bands (CB) of Rod-C3N4 (−1.07 eV) and bulk C3N4 (−0.92 eV) (Table S2). Fig. 3c exhibit the PL spectra of Bulk-C3N4 and Rod-C3N4 samples under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Both samples display a main peak centered, ascribed to the direct electrons and holes recombination of band transition. Compared to pristine C3N4, the PL intensities of Rod-C3N4 decrease obviously, which maybe arise from the higher crystallinity and can retard recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is well known that the quantum confinement effect of nano-level materials, the atomic defects, and the adventitious atom incorporations in noumenon all can cause the shift of PL emission wavelength [13,34–36]. Widened bandgap together with the quantum size effect of the nanorod structure both drove the blue shift to short wavelength region [37,38]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were carried out to further understand the role of crystallinity in the photo-excited electron conductivity, as shown in Fig. 3d. Compared with Bulk-C3N4, the Nyquist plots of the Rod-C3N4 display smaller diameter, indicating the lower electronic resistance of the Rod-C3N4 photocatalyst. The transient photocurrent responses via two on-off cycles of both samples under irradiation are shown in Fig. 3e, which may directly correlate with the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes [7]. The irradiated photocurrent density of Rod-C3N4 is 6.0 times higher than that of Bulk-C3N4. Thus, the separation and transfer of photo-induced electron-hole pairs are more efficient in the case of Rod-C3N4 due to the higher surface area and better crystallinity of Rod-C3N4, which is well consistent with the results of PL and EIS results. Therefore, the better crystallinity introduced by steam-engraved method significantly enhance the electron mobility and electrons/holes separation."
5,Photocatalytic performance,"2.4 Photocatalytic performance The photocatalytic activity tests were carried out for the hydrogen generation from water splitting. 3 wt% Pt/Rod-C3N4 exhibits a much higher photocatalytic activity (26.3 times) for the hydrogen evolution than the 3 wt% Pt/Bulk-C3N4 photocatalyst under the same conditions (Fig. 3f and Table S3). And the durability of 3 wt% Pt/Rod-C3N4 photocatalyst is also tested by recycling the photocatalyst for the same reaction. The amount of H2 production without noticeable deactivation are observed after 3 cycles (Fig. S9), simultaneously, structure characterization of Rod-C3N4 photocatalyst was carried out after the photocatalytic reaction. From XRD analyses (Fig. S10), no obviously change of feature diffraction peak suggesting that the Rod-C3N4 is highly stable under visible light irradiation, which confirms that 3 wt% Pt/Rod-C3N4 photocatalyst is stable during the photocatalytic H2 evolution. The reconstructed texture treated by structure engineering process endows a rod-like morphology for C3N4, which increase the surface area of C3N4and result in more exposed photochemical active sites for photocatalytic activity for H2 generation. The enhanced crystallinity of Rod-C3N4 reduce the lattice defects and thus improve the electronic conductivity. The energy band structure of Bulk-C3N4 and Rod-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 4 . Obviously, the more negative potential of CB made the electrons have stronger reduction capability, which is accelerated for the photocatalytic H2 evolution. Therefore, the enhanced activity should be attributed to the unique surface properties of the steam-engraved C3N4 with higher surface area, enhanced crystallinity and meliorative band gap configuration, inheriting from our suggested lattice engineering process. It is interesting to compare the specific activity (amount of H2 generation per BET area) to understand the synergetic role of the surface area, crystallinity and energy band. On one hand, larger surface area provides much more active sites, in addition, with enhanced crystallinity, the Rod-C3N4 exhibits effective separation of photo-induced hole and electron. Thus, the amount rate of H2 generation was normalized by the BET surface area to exclude the contribution of the increased surface area to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of steam-engraved C3N4. The specific activity can exclusively specify the role of enhanced crystallinity and meliorative energy band for the Rod-C3N4. Table S3 shows the results after normalizing the amount rate of H2 generation. After the BET normalization, the specific activity of steam-engraved C3N4 is 87 μmol g−1h−1cm−2 BET, which is 10.4 times higher than that of pristine C3N4 (8.4 μmol g−1h−1cm−2 BET). These results indicating that except for the surface effects, the enhanced crystallinity and optimized energy band are also the factors for the advanced photocatalytic avtivity of the Rod-C3N4, as the mechanism shown in Fig. 4. Thus, the remarkable photocatalytic performance of 3 wt% Pt/Rod-C3N4 photo-catalyst can be attributed to these facts, that are: (1) its high specific surface area provides large number of active sites and quick access to reactants, (2) the better crystallinity of Rod-C3N4 remarkably promote photo-induced electrons and holes separation and (3) energy band configuration for Rod-C3N4 shows more powerful redox capacity."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, we have demonstrated a simple but efficient structure engineering strategy by steam-engraving to produce a Rod-C3N4 with better crystallinity, higher surface area and meliorative band gap configuration, which are highly relative to the photocatalytic performance of H2 generation. In addition to the usual contribution of the high surface area, the specific activity results (amount of H2 generation rate per BET area) imply the significant role of the better crystallinity and meliorative energy band configuration, which promote the transfer and separation of photoexcited hole/electron and change the condution band potential, respectively. With the steam engraving, more active sites and better photocatalytic activity are realized. Therefore, the as-developed structure engineering strategy could produce highly competitive CN based photocatalysts for H2 evolution from water. Overall, this work provides a new strategy to design advanced photocatalysts by simultaneously increasing the surface area, reducing the lattice defects and optimizing the energy band."
