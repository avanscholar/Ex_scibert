0,Introduction,"The development of clean energy as alternatives to fossil fuels is one of the major themes of energy evolution in the world. Hydrogen has long been considered as renewable energy to replace fossil fuels [1,2]. Therefore, efficient hydrogen production technology with safe and stable output is in high demand, electrolyzing water for hydrogen generation is regarded as a prospective method [3,4]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a commercially used HER catalyst, Pt/C material shows excellent performance, but the wide application is limited by its high cost and scarcity. Thus, it is timely and vital to develop high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts for HER. Developing transition metal sulphides (TMSs), such as MoS2 [5–7], Ni3S2/NiS [8–10], TaS2 [11], CoS2 [12,13], and TiS2 [14], are regarded as promising candidates for electrocatalytic HER [15–17]. Especially, the MoS2 material demonstrates good catalytic performance among various TMSs due to its unique electronic structure, stable physical and chemical properties, and extensive active sites for electrocatalytic HER [18,19]. For instance, 1T, 2T and 3R MoS2 [20], MoS2 quantum dots [21], MoS2 micro-boxes [22], modified MoS2 nanosheets [23], are reported and used as HER electrocatalysts. Besides, HER performance could be further optimized by combining MoS2 with other synergistic catalysts [24–26]. Previous works designed a series of composites containing MoS2 for HER, but most designed synthesizes are tedious, which are not conducive to their practical application. For example, Zhang et al. modulated the surface of hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets with single Ni atoms for obtaining enhanced performance. They prepared MCM@MoS2 composite nanofibers at first, mixed with Ni(NO3)2 and reacted at 70 °C for 2 h afterward, and finally annealed at 600 °C in Ar/H2 for 2 h to obtain MCM@MoS2–Ni nanofibers [27]. Moreover, Luo et al. decorated MoS2 microspheres with Mo2C materials. Firstly, they grew MoS2 microspheres on a Ti foil by a hydrothermal process at 180 °C. Then, the sample heated to 750 °C to react with H2 and CH4 in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace to obtain MoS2/Mo2C [28]. Hu et al. designed MoS2/NiCo LDH sheets via two steps microwave hydrothermal reactions at different conditions [29]. Usually, commercial Ni, Fe, and Cu foams are used as the current collectors for growing TMSs owing to its unique porous structures, however, it is rarely reported that the Ni foam used as raw materials directly to synthesize electrocatalytic materials and as substrates for self-standing electrodes simultaneously. In recent years, it is realized that the sulphides of nickel-based materials own more efficient active sites to realize the faster catalytic process of Volmer steps [30,31]. And it is noted that heterostructures can further improve the electrochemical surface area of electrocatalysts [32,33]. It is necessary to develop Ni-substrate composite with MoS2 to form heterogeneous structure through a facile method. Herein, we reported the synthesis of MoS2/NiS hierarchical heterostructures (HHs) by a simple one-step hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 1 , nickel foams and molybdates as precursors, disulfides or polysulfides produced by the decomposition of thiourea at high temperature will react directly with Ni foam to generate NiS. Meanwhile, the thin molybdenum disulphide nanosheets can be prepared by transition metal oxide reacting with sulfur sources to form the MoS2/NiS hierarchical heterostructures. Owing to the unique structures that endow a large number of active sites, the overpotential of 84.1 mV is obtained to realize a current density at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope is only 76.9 mV dec−1."

Also, the ultrapure deionized water (18 MΩ cm−1) was used in all experiments."
3,Preparation for MoS2/NiS HHs,"2.2 Preparation for MoS2/NiS HHs Firstly, CH3COONa·3H2O, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and CH4N2S (8 mmol) into glass beakers were dissolved into 35 mL DI water separately and stirred for 30 min. Then the solutions were transferred and mixed in a 50 mL Teflon reactor. Rectangular nickel foam (2 cm*3 cm) was treated with alcohol and hydrochloric acid (4 M HCl), and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 6 h under vacuum. The processed nickel foam was put to the Teflon and under hydrothermal reaction at 200 °C for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature, the nickel foam containing the products was taken out and cleaned the surface with DI water. Finally, the products were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Also, to control different Mo ratios for the MoS2/NiS HHs A, B, and C. The detailed amounts are shown in Table S1."

5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Samples are characterized by D/Max-2550 PC X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Co-Ka radiation) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800), and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). The characteristic peaks of X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using a PHI Quantum-2000 electron spectrometer (Ulvac-Phi, Japan)."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The hydrogen evolution reaction evaluation was established on the three-electrode system, by using the Autolab workstation (PGSTAT 302 N, Metrohm China Ltd.) in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 13.6) solution. The samples of the NiS, MoS2/NiS HHs and MoS2 can be used as a working electrode directly which was cut into 1 cm*0.5 cm. Commercial Pt/C was prepared by using 20% Pt/C (3 mg) homogeneous ink (VNafion/Vethanol/Vwater = 10 μL/60 μL/230 μL) and coating on the Ni foam, the loading amount is 2.2 mg cm−2. All the electrochemical tests are used the graphite electrode slab as a counter electrode directly and the Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. After cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation (10 mV s−1), HER performance was examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with iR compensation (90%) at a sweep rate of 2 mV s−1 under CV curves tested. All the potentials in our test results were calculated and calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). EIS (Electrochemical impedance measurements) were tested by the FRA impedance potentiostatic mode when the working electrode was biased from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz with an AC voltage of 2 mV. In order to obtain the electrochemical surface area, the scanning range of potential from 0.17–0.27 V vs. RHE of CV tests were conducted, and the scanning rate ranges from 2 mV s−1 to 10 mV s−1, respectively. Conversion between standard electrodes are using the equation as follows: Evs. RHE = Evs. Ag/AgCl + 0.059ⅹpH + 0.197 V."
7,Result and discussion,"The surface of Ni foam is full of abundant and uniform nanorods, shown by SEM images in Fig. 2 a and its inset, and Fig. 2b shows that the nanorods are long and over 30 μm in length (Fig. S1d). Interestingly, there is a distinct lamination on the surface of nanorods (Fig. 2c). The exact components are detected by XRD and EDS (Fig. 2d and e). Fig. 2d shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared NiS, MoS2 and MoS2/NiS HHs, respectively (Table S1). The 2θ peaks at 18.44°, 30.31°, 32.21°, 35.70°, 37.34°, 40.45°, 48.84°, 50.14°, 52.64°, 56.25°, 57.14°, 59.73°, 72.62° and 75.65° coincide with the (110), (101), (300), (021), (220), (211), (131), (410), (401), (321), (330), (012), (312) and (042) lattice planes of NiS (JCPDS No. 12–0041). Three obvious peaks with 2θ at 14.21°, 33.58° and 43.9° are corresponding to the (002), (100) and (006) planes of MoS2 (JCPDS No. 65–0160), the small peak appeared at about 21° is Ni metal (JCPDS No. 12–1272) from the Ni foam. MoS2 components have no obvious peaks in the pattern of MoS2/NiS compared with NiS due to its low content. The energy dispersive spectroscopy is conducive to analyze the composition of each element (Ni, Mo, and S) (Fig. 2e). In the sector diagram, NiS dominated high Ni and S ratio of 38.35% and 56.98%, and the Mo content was only 4.67%, this is consistent with the low amount of MoS2. To obtain optimized HER performance, a series of products were prepared by controlling different proportions of precursors, as shown in Table S1. From the table, as for the precursor solution without adding sodium acetate and ammonium molybdate, squama-like NiS nanosheets will form on the surface of the Ni foam (Fig. S1a), because of both S2- and H+ ions participate in the chemical etching of Ni foam. When only ammonium molybdate is added, a large amount of MoS2 nanoblocks will grow on the surface (Fig. S1b). When different ratios of ammonium molybdate and sodium acetate are added, it can be noted that the surface of the Ni foam begins to form nanorods (Figs. S1c–e). When the ratio is 1:2, the average diameter of the product is ~1 μm (Fig. S2). When reducing the proportion of Mo, the diameter of the nanorods decreases gradually. As shown in Fig. S1d, the diameter is about 400 nm when the ratio is 1:1.5 (Fig. 2c), and when the ratio is 1:1, the diameter decreases to 200 nm accordingly (Fig. S3). Therefore, as the molar ratio of Mo precursor decreases, the amount of MoS2 products will decrease, thus influencing HER performance. Moreover, the addition and proportion of acetates play important roles in the formation of heterojunctions. As clarified by Table S1, a large amount of MoS2 nano-blocks are formed and covered on the Ni foam without adding sodium acetate, it is also proved by the XRD pattern of Fig. 2d (red line) that there is nearly no formation of NiS under this condition, indicating that MoS2 and NiS cannot be formed simultaneously without adding sodium acetate, and the heterostructure is formed at a specific ratio. The TEM image of MoS2/NiS HHs (Mo:Na = 1.5:1) in Fig. 3 a shows the fluffy surface that endows its large surface area. Fig. 3b is HRTEM image selected from Fig. 3a in region ‘1’, it is found that the selected area belongs to MoS2, and the crystal plane spacings of 2.5 Å and 2.73 Å correspond to (102) and (100) lattice planes, respectively. In addition, the exposed NiS nanorods were obtained by strong ultrasonication of MoS2/NiS HHs, as shown in Fig. 3c. The HRTEM is shown in Fig. 3d which selected from the region ‘2’ in Fig. 3c, most of the MoS2 nanosheets were peeled off from the surface, and the lattice parameters of NiS are significantly different from that of MoS2, an enlarged HRTEM of NiS is shown in Fig. S4, the d-spacing of 2.78 Å is corresponding to the (300) plane of NiS. In addition, elemental mapping in Figs. S5a–d proves that the backbone of NiS nanorods. Fig. 3e–h demonstrate the uniform distribution of Ni, Mo and S elements of the MoS2/NiS HHs. It is further proved that there is a core-shell structure formed by covering MoS2 lamellae on the surface of NiS nanorods. XPS spectrum of the MoS2/NiS HHs in Fig. 4 a identified dominant constituents of Ni, Mo, S, C, and O. As shown in Fig. 4b, the peaks of 870.3 and 853.1 eV can be indexed to the metallic Ni from the Ni foam [34,35]. There are two strong peaks at the binding energies of 856.1 and 874.1 eV for Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2, which indicates the appearance of Ni (II) and is consistent with the formation of Ni–S. In addition, two satellites appeared with slight negative shifts of 5.9 and 6.5 eV, respectively [36,37]. The Mo spectrum shows four states locate at 226.2, 228.8, 232.5 and 235.8 eV in Fig. 4c, separately. Two main peaks at 228.8 and 232.5eV belong to Mo 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 in MoS2, and the existence of a small peak at 226.2 eV indicates the existence of S 2s which decomposed from the thiourea during the hydrothermal process [38,39]. Because of the excessive Mo source and incomplete consumption in the hydrothermal reaction, and the inevitable oxidation of MoS2 surface in air resulted in the generation of Mo (VI) peak (236.1 eV). In Fig. 4d, the peaks at 161.8 eV and 163.2 eV are assigned to S 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 of MoS2 and NiS, the binding energy of 168.8 eV stem from SO4 2- that surface oxidation of the metal sulfides [36,40]. To evaluate HER catalytic activities of different MoS2/NiS HHs, MoS2/NiS HHs were directly used as working electrode in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In Fig. 5 a, although commercial 20% Pt/C (η10 = 43.7 mV) on the Ni foam (2.6 mg cm−2) exhibited the best performance, the overpotential of MoS2/NiS HHs A, B, C were 122.7, 84.1 and 92.2 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (A, B, C represent the ratios of Na and Mo source are 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2), the bare NiS and MoS2 are 176 and 86.1 mV, respectively. The lower overpotential of MoS2/NiS HHs B could be attributed to the higher ‘true surface area’ [41] and micro-morphology that make it expose more active edges and interfaces to the electrolyte than MoS2/NiS HHs A and C. The lower Tafel plot indicated a more efficient electron transfer. As shown in Fig. 5b, the MoS2/NiS HHs B catalyst perform a Tafel slope only 76.9 mV dec−1, indicating a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER [32], and quicker current response rate compared to the MoS2 (90.4 mV dec−1), NiS (116.8 mV dec−1), MoS2/NiS HHs A (99.3 mV dec−1) and MoS2/NiS HHs C (103 mV dec−1). The EIS measures are important to study the HER kinetics and inherent resistance properties. In Fig. 5c, all the EIS values were measured at the same potential of −0.13 V vs. RHE, the MoS2/NiS HHs, MoS2 and NiS show approximate Rs values (~2.0 Ω) except for the Pt/C (1.2 Ω). The Rct values of MoS2/NiS HHs B shows a lower value of 6.33Ω compare to A (6.93 Ω) and C (8.48 Ω), those electrodes also superior to NiS (62.3 Ω) and MoS2 (14.5 Ω), demonstrating the strong correlation that lower electrochemical resistance promotes the charge transfer to accelerate the electrons with reactants on the surface of the catalyst. In addition, ECSA is an important factor to evaluate catalysts, which was estimated by measuring the CV (double-layer capacitance) in the potential range of 0.17–0.27 V at different scan rates (Fig. S6). The MoS2/NiS HHs B (795 mF cm−2) has a higher Cdl value compared to MoS2/NiS HHs A (653 mF cm−2) and C (476 mF cm−2). The highest value of C dl proves a higher density of active species on the same geometric surface area of the catalysts. Fig. 5e shows the response characteristics of current densities under the alternating potentials. Obviously, the MoS2/NiS HHs B exhibits a rapid and stable corresponding with changing potential. In addition, after 3000 times CV cycles, the obtained LSV curve is similar to the first cycle, and the time-dependent test for 30 h at an overpotential of 120 mV indicates that the MoS2/NiS HHs B also has excellent stability (Fig. 5f). Besides, a DC power to supply a device (MnMoO4//MoS2/NiS HHs B) under 1.6 V can generate a current density of 21 mA cm−2 (Fig. S7 and Movie S1), demonstrating its practical application.

8,Conclusions,"In summary, we have developed a simple and mild way to obtain MoS2/NiS hierarchical heterostructures by using Ni foam as raw material directly via a one-step hydrothermal reaction. Owing to the porous structure of Ni foam and heterogeneous structure of MoS2/NiS, abundant active species, and low inherent resistance are generated on the surface. As a superior electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 84.1 mV is obtained at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope is only 76.9 mV dec−1. The basically unchanged LSV curves before and after 3000 CV cycles demonstrate MoS2/NiS hierarchical heterostructures display excellent stability. This work provides a cost-effective catalytic hydrogen production material with high performance and stability."
