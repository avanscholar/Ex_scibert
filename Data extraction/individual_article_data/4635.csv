0,Introduction,"The common current energy sources (fossil fuels) have caused serious environmental problems such as global warming. Therefore, alternative energy sources should be developed to replace fossil fuels. Hydrogen (H2) is a promising candidate as an ideal fuel in the future due to its clean nature and high energy yield (122 KJ g−1) [1,2]. Compared with conventional H2 generation processes that require a high energy demand, biological H2 production is more environmentally friendly and less energy intensive [3]. Furthermore, fermentative H2 production can utilize different organic substrates and produce high hydrogen yields [4,5]. Hydrogen production from cellulose is a promising alternative to substitute fossil fuels because cellulose is the most abundant renewable resource in nature, is inexpensive and constitutes a major portion of agricultural and forest waste and industrial effluents such as those from the pulp/paper and food industries [6–8]. Therefore, the use of cellulosic residues offers the possibility of waste minimization with renewable energy recovery [4]. Leachate is generated in places of municipal solid waste disposal, such as landfills, as a consequence of the contact of water with the solid waste, and so it is a wastewater characterized by its high chemical oxygen demand (COD) [9,10]. It contains a complex mixture of organic and inorganic constituents and microorganisms performing anaerobic waste biodegradation [9]. Therefore, leachate is a source of hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms and has already been used as a source of anaerobic biomass for hydrogen production from glucose [11]. According to Liu et al. [12], one of the main organic compounds of leachate is cellulose, since municipal solid wastes are composed mostly by lignocellulosic residues [13]. The conversion of cellulose to hydrogen involves hydrolysis into soluble sugars followed by their fermentation by anaerobic microorganisms [8,14]. The biological hydrolysis of cellulose is carried out by a cellulase enzyme complex [8,15] synthesized by a variety of microorganisms. The set of enzymes (endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases) act in synergy to release readily fermentable monomers [16]. Cellulolytic microorganisms are present in different anaerobic environments such as sediments, rice paddies, rumen, bioreactor sludge and landfill leachate [11,17–19]. Some bacteria of the genera Clostridium, Bacillus, Ruminococcus, Bacterioides, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Acetovibrio are known as cellulose degraders [4,20]. Huang et al. [9] did an overall description of the bacterial populations of a leachate from a full-scale recirculating landfill and reported that the clones were related to the genus Clostridium, which are described as the main group of cellulose degraders in landfills [21]. In addition to hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria, the leachate microbial community is composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea [22], which is undesirable in anaerobic hydrogen production systems. Heat pretreatment is commonly used to inactivate hydrogen-consuming microorganisms [23–25]. Recent studies have used leachate as a substrate or as a source of nutrients for anaerobic hydrogen production [10,12]. However, there are few reports of hydrogen production that have used leachate as a source of anaerobic microorganisms. For this reason, the aim of this research was to investigate the biological hydrogen production from cellulose using microbial consortia purified from a leachate under mesophilic conditions, in the presence and absence of cellulase. The phylogenetic diversity of the hydrogen-producing community was analyzed using 16S rRNA-based techniques."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Source of inoculum,"2.1 Source of inoculum Leachate samples were collected from a landfill in São Carlos, Brazil and used as a source of inoculum. The samples were transported to the laboratory and were stored at 4 °C prior to use for experimental purposes to minimize the effects of biological and chemical reactions. The leachate was heat pretreated at 90 °C for 10 min to inactivate hydrogenotrophic methanogens archaea [26]. The pretreated biomass was transferred to 50 mL vials and submitted to centrifugation (8500 rpm/4 °C for 8 min). The pellet containing the microorganisms was transferred to a Duran flask containing fresh culture medium for biomass enrichment, described in Section 2.3."
3,Cellulose and cellulase,"2.2 Cellulose and cellulase The cellulose used as the sole carbon source was a microcrystalline powder with a 20-μm particle size (Sigma–Aldrich). The cellulase enzyme used (1,4-(1,3:1,4)-β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, Celluclast® 1.5 L from Trichoderma reesei ATCC 26921) is sold commercially by Sigma Aldrich (C2730). The amount of enzyme added to each reactor took into account the theoretical number of enzyme units required to catalyze the total breakdown of cellulose into glucose. Each milliliter of cellulase contained 700 units, and each unit is capable of liberating 1 μmol of glucose/hour at pH 5.0 and 37 °C [27]. The concentrations of cellulase added to the reactors are presented in Table 1 ."
4,Batch enrichment of mesophilic H2-producing microorganisms,"2.3 Batch enrichment of mesophilic H2-producing microorganisms The enrichment of the pretreated biomass (microorganisms) was done in Del Nery medium prepared as previously described by Maintinguer et al. [25] and modified by the substitution of peptone with yeast extract (1000 mg/L). The culture medium was sterilized by filtration and the pH was adjusted to 7 with 1.0 M NaOH. The enrichment was performed in 1 L anaerobic bottles with a 0.5 L working volume made up of Del Nery medium, 10% (v/v) inoculum, cellulose (0.5 g/L) and cellulase (4 ml/L or 2800 units of cellulase). The headspace in the anaerobic bottles was filled with N2 (100%) and incubated at 37 °C. This biomass was maintained in the exponential growth phase and used for the hydrogen production assays."
5,Hydrogen production in batch fermentation,"2.4 Hydrogen production in batch fermentation All batch fermentation tests were performed in anaerobic batch reactors with a total volume of 5 L and a working volume of 1 L, consisting of Del Nery medium modified as described above under the three conditions outlined in Table 1. Reactors without cellulase for each substrate concentration were also included in the experiment. The biomass in exponential growth phase was submitted to successive washes (8500 rpm/4 °C for 8 min), and the microorganisms (10% v/v) were resuspended in sterile culture medium. The pH was adjusted to 7 with 1.0 M NaOH. The reactors were submitted a N2 (100%) atmosphere, closed with butyl rubber stoppers and incubated at 37 °C, without agitation. The assay was performed in triplicate for each condition."
6,Analytical procedures,"2.5 Analytical procedures The hydrogen content in the biogas was determined by gas chromatography using a GC 2010 Shimadzu system equipped with a Carboxen column (1010 plot 30 m × 0.53 mm) and a thermal conductivity detector. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector and column were 30 °C, 200 °C and 230 °C, respectively [25]. The concentrations of organic compounds, such as volatile acids and alcohols, in the liquid phase were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC system was equipped with a 10ADVP LC pump, an SIL – 20A HT automatic sampler, a CT – 20A oven, two detectors connected in series: a diode array ultraviolet detector (UV) (model SCL – M10 AVP) and a refractive index detector (RID – 10A), and an SCL – 10 AVP controller. An AMNEX® HPX-87H column (300 mm × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad) was used, and the Class – VP program (SHIMADZU®) was used to analyze the results. The organic acids were detected using the SDP – M10 AVP UV detector, and the alcohols were detected using the RID – 10A detector. A 0.005 M sulfuric acid solution was used as the mobile phase. The operating conditions of the column were a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and a temperature of 43 °C. The sample was prepared by adding 2 mL of the reactor effluent to 80 μL of 2 M sulfuric acid solution. This solution was filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane with 0.2 mm pores before injection into the chromatography system [28]. The final pH and concentration of total volatile solids (TVS) were determined according to Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater (APHA) [29]. The soluble carbohydrate concentration was determined indirectly by the phenol–sulfuric acid method using glucose as a standard [30]."
7,Data analysis,"2.6 Data analysis The cumulative hydrogen production (H) data were fitted to a modified Gompertz model [31] using Statistica 8.0. This model is suitable to describe the cumulative biogas production in a batch experiment. In the equation, H is the cumulative hydrogen production, t is the time of operation, P is the hydrogen production potential (mmol), R m is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mmol/h), ë is the duration of the lag-phase (h) and e is 2.71. H = P · exp { − exp [ R m · e P ( λ − t ) + 1 ] }"
8,Microscopy analysis,2.7 Microscopy analysis The morphological characteristics of the microorganisms were monitored by phase contrast microscopy using an Olympus BX60-FLA microscope and Image Pro-Plus software. Gram staining was carried out according to the method proposed by Scientific Services of Cultures Collections of Germany [32].
9,Molecular analysis,"2.8 Molecular analysis The analysis of the microbial community structure was performed at the end of the hydrogen production process for all of the evaluated conditions. The bacterial communities were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of fragments of the 16S rRNA genes. The population in the reactor with the highest hydrogen yield was assessed by cloning and sequencing. 2.8.1 Nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification Total genomic DNA was obtained after cell lysis with glass beads and phenol–chloroform extraction as described by Griffiths with modifications [33]. PCR/DGGE was applied using the following primers for the Bacteria domain: 968FGC and 1401R [34]. The set of primers used for cloning was performed for the Bacteria domain 27F – 1100R [35]. 2.8.2 Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was performed using the Dcode™ Universal Mutation Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were electrophoresed in TAE buffer (1×) at 75 V for 16 h at 60 °C on a polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing a linear gradient of the denaturant from 45% to 65%. The polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 20 min and then visualized using an Eagle Eye TM III densitometer (Stratagene) with 254 nm UV exposures, coupled to a personal computer using Eagle Sight software. The bands were excised from the DGGE gel and immersed in 20 μl of ultrapure water. The vials were kept at 4 °C overnight to allow the passive diffusion of the DNA into the water, and 4 μL of the eluted rRNA was further amplified using the bacterial primers 968F and 1401R. After PCR amplification, the PCR products were purified with an Ultraclean™ PCR Clean-up™ kit and sequenced. 2.8.3 Cloning and determination of the 16S rRNA sequence The reactor with the highest hydrogen yield was selected for cloning. Samples of PCR products (16S rRNA) were cloned into the plasmid vector pGEM (Promega Easy Vector System I) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Clones were randomly selected and amplified by PCR using M13 F/R primer [36]. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on an automated ABI 310 PRISM Sequencer (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 2.8.4 Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences The nucleotide sequences obtained from the bands and the cloning experiments were processed and were aligned with SeqMan (Lasergene DNAstar package). The aligned sequences were compared with the sequences of the reference microorganisms available in GenBank using a BLAST search [37]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [38] with MEGA 3.1 [39]. Bootstrap re-sampling analysis with 1000 replicates was performed to estimate the reliability of the tree topologies. Bacteroides cellulosolvens (NR025918.1) and Desulfosarcina cetonica (GU057388.1) were used as an outgroup."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Hydrogen production in batch fermentation,"3.1 Hydrogen production in batch fermentation The biogas detected in the reactors contained only hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with no detectable methane. The heat pretreatment applied to the biomass favored the maintenance of rods and spore-forming bacteria in the microbial consortium. The anaerobic batch reactors fed with cellulose under the three different conditions studied had different hydrogen production behavior. Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen production in the reactors. Hydrogen production started after 7 h of incubation under the three conditions with 1.5 mmol, 1.6 mmol and 0.8 mmol H2 and the maximum generation was detected after 53 h (20.2 mmol H2), 165 h (22.7 mmol H2) and 96 h (128.7 mmol H2) for 2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/L cellulose with cellulase. Despite the increase in cellulose concentration to 5.0 g/L, the hydrogen production in this reactor presented similar behavior to the 2.5 g/L condition, according to the parameters obtained from the modified Gompertz equation (Table 2 ). For these two conditions, the period of lag-phase (λ) lasted 5.1 and 4.6 h and the hydrogen production rates were 0.8 and 0.9 mmol/h (Table 2), respectively. Moreover, P was 19.9 and 21.2 mmol (Table 2), respectively. These results correspond to the approximately equal amounts of cellulose consumed under these two conditions, i.e., 41.4% (2.5 g/L) and 28% (5.0 g/L), which is about 1.0 g of soluble carbohydrates hydrolyzed from cellulose. Therefore, the hydrogen yield of the 5.0 g/L condition was half of the yield of the 2.5 g/L condition; i.e., 0.6 and 1.2 mol of hydrogen/mol hydrolyzed cellulose, respectively. The reactor with 10 g/L of cellulose with cellulase, on the other hand, presented an increase in hydrogen generation compared to the others. The lag-phase period (λ) (Table 2) was longer with higher cellulose concentration in agreement with other studies using cellulose and xylose as substrate [1,25]. However, in contrast to previous reports [7], biomass growth and hydrogen production were not inhibited in this condition. With 10 g/L cellulose, P was considerably higher (125.9 mmol), as well as R m (2.3 mmol/h) (Table 2) and this is probably due to the increase in substrate availability in this reactor. This result corresponds to the amount of substrate consumed (44.7%) which was about 4.47 g of soluble carbohydrates, leading to a hydrogen yield of 2.3 mol of hydrogen/mol hydrolyzed cellulose. Since the inhibition of biomass growth was not observed in this study, a most likely reason for the lower hydrogen yield under the 5.0 g/L condition is the rapid decrease in pH in this reactor (Fig. 2 ). The production of organic acids as fermentation end products leads to a decrease in the pH culture. After 7 h of incubation, pH was 4.5 under the 5 g/L condition, whereas for 2.5 and 10 g/L, pH reached an acidic range at 12.5 and 12 h, respectively. After reaching the acidic range, pH values had a slight variation until the end of the period of incubation of reactors with 2.5 and 5.0 g/L cellulose with cellulase. This might be related to an inhibition of fermentation activity in acidic pH, which took longer to occur under the 10 g/L condition. At the end of the period of incubation, the pH values decreased from approximately 7.0 to 4.3, 4.0 and 3.3 for the conditions 2.5 g/L (100 h), 5.0 g/L (189 h) and 10 g/L (170 h), respectively. The reduction in the pH may cause an enzyme denaturation, which could have stopped the hydrolysis of cellulose to soluble carbohydrates, leading to a depletion of soluble substrate available for biomass assimilation and hydrogen production. It is known that cellulase undergoes denaturation at low pH, with optimal activity at pH 5.0 [27]. In addition, it is reported that hydrogen production by Clostridium sp. proceeds at neutral pH range and is inhibited in the pH range of 4–5 [40] because the activity of hydrogenase is affected by low pH [41,42]. Levin et al. [43] suggested that the pH should be maintained between 7.0 and 7.2 for continuous hydrogen production during cellulose fermentation. Morimoto et al. [44] demonstrated that the production of hydrogen from glucose started at neutral pH, was reduced with decreasing pH and ceased at pH 4. The increase in the partial pressure of H2 is another inhibiting factor for hydrogen production. The reactor with 5.0 g/L cellulose had higher H2 partial pressure (0.2 atm) within the first 8 h of incubation, in comparison to the 2.5 g/L condition (0.07 atm) after 8 h. The hydrogen yield behavior obtained in this study differed from that observed by Lay [1] in reactors fed with 12.5 g/L (2.18 mmol H2/g cellulose) and 25 g/L (1.6 mmol H2/g cellulose) microcrystalline cellulose at 37 °C using anaerobic digested sludge as the inoculum. In contrast to the present study, Lay [1] observed that increasing the substrate concentration under mesophilic conditions resulted in lower H2 yields. This might possibly be because the author tested a significantly higher concentration (25 g/L). Moreover, comparing the hydrogen yields from this study with those obtained by Lay [1], the addition of cellulase potentialized the hydrogen production using cellulose as substrate. The maximum theoretical hydrogen yields (mol H2/mol substrate) are 4.0 for glucose, potato starch and cellulose; 2.0 for leachate and 8.0 for sucrose [45]. The maximum hydrogen yields reported in previous studies were 1.0–2.4 mol H2/mol glucose; these values were obtained using pure culture and mixed culture [46–48]. However, the reported conversion efficiencies for Clostridium intermedius are up to 38% for glucose, whereas for Clostridium butyricum they are up to 55% for sucrose and for Clostridium sp. are up to 59% for xylose [45,46]. In the present study, the yields of H2 production from cellulose, with the addition of exogenous cellulolytic enzyme, using leachate as the inoculum ranged from 0.6 to 2.3 mol H2/mol hydrolyzed cellulose. The hydrogen production curve is an indirect analysis of biomass growth and it is in accordance with TVS results under the three conditions. Reactors of 2.5 and 5.0 g/L conditions presented similar biomass growth, i.e., 7.1 and 9.1 g/L TVS, respectively. The microbial growth was favored under the 10 g/L condition with an increase to 19.9 g/L TVS. The environmental conditions and the greater availability of soluble sugars in this reactor allowed greater biomass growth. In the reactors with cellulase, a variety of organic acids were detected under the three conditions studied, with a predominance of butyric and isobutyric acids (Fig. 3 ). The amount of hydrogen produced from cellulose depends on the catabolic pathways used by microorganisms. During acidogenesis using cellulose, various types of metabolites are generated along with hydrogen [2,49]. In this study, the main VFAs were found to be acetic, butyric, isobutyric and propionic acids (Fig. 3). During the period of incubation of the reactors under the three conditions, the concentrations of acetic and propionic acids gradually decreased, whereas butyric and isobutyric acids accounted for more than 80% of the total VFAs for all reactors at the end. Butyric acid was detected in proportions of 39.7%, 44.3% and 65% under the 2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/L cellulose with cellulase conditions, respectively. As observed for hydrogen generation, the 2.5 and 5.0 conditions presented similar concentrations of VFAs produced at the end of the incubation (Table 3 ), whereas acetic and butyric acids concentrations were considerably higher under the 10 g/L condition. The presence of propionate, acetate and butyrate during fermentation has been widely reported and is in accordance with fermentative metabolism [50,51]. The maximum theoretical H2 yield of 4.0 mol H2/mol hexose could be achieved with the production of only acetate, and lower H2 yields would occur as the distribution of the fermentative products shifts toward butyrate and ethanol [51]. During the hydrogen production process, the pathway can shift from VFA production to alcohol production when the pH is reduced to 4.5 or below [52,53]. However, in these batch experiments, alcohols were not detected. In contrast to the reactors containing cellulase, which presented cellulose hydrolysate fermentation with hydrogen production and VFAs generation, no hydrogen production was detected in the reactors without cellulase. The pH of the culture at the end of the incubation of the reactors also confirmed a low fermentative activity for the three conditions without cellulase (2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/L cellulose); i.e. 5.6 after 100 h (2.5 g/L), 188 h (5.0 g/L) and 180 h (10 g/L) (Table 3). Low concentrations of acetic (around 30 mg/L) and butyric (around 26 mg/L) acids were observed in the reactors without cellulase, with a predominance of propionic (around 100 mg/L) and isobutyric (around 95 mg/L) acids under the three conditions studied (Table 3). Regarding the use of the same substrate concentrations, culture medium and operational conditions (pH 7/37 °C) as used in the reactors with cellulase, an inability of the microbial consortium to hydrolyze cellulose into readily fermentable sugars was confirmed. Thus, the low biomass growth may be due to the consumption of the yeast extract and vitamins added to the culture medium. It is known that there is a wide diversity of cellulolytic microorganisms in leachate, as stated by Burrel et al. [54]. These authors identified three microorganisms (C. stercorarium, Clostridium thermocellum and Bacterioides cellulosolvens) capable of hydrolyzing cellulose, which were not detected in the present study. Therefore, in this study, the production of hydrogen from cellulose was possible using this microbial consortium only by adding exogenous cellulase to promote cellulose hydrolysis into soluble sugars. Similar results were reported by Datar et al. [55] who detected hydrogen production from heat-treated lignocellulosic solids 20 h after the addition of 10 mL of cellulase enzymes in bioreactors incubated over a prior period of three weeks."
12,Identification of bacterial strains using DGGE profiles,"3.2 Identification of bacterial strains using DGGE profiles Variation in the band patterns of DGGE was observed with the populations of bacteria (Fig. 4 ) for reactors with different concentrations of cellulose, with and without cellulase. Changes in the community structure of the microbial consortia were most likely related to the conditions imposed, such as heat shock, the presence of cellulase and the substrate concentration. The similarity coefficient between leachate in natura (7) and the biomass of the reactors was 13% (Fig. 4). Certain populations of bacteria were found only in the leachate in natura (untreated), and it was not present in the treated biomass used as inoculum in the batch reactors. This change resulted from the application of heat shock because only some populations can withstand elevated temperatures and so were maintained in the treated biomass. A high similarity coefficient of 88% was observed for the reactors fed with 2.5 and 5.0 g/L cellulose with cellulase, probably because these reactors presented similar hydrogen production behavior. The similarity coefficient between these two reactors and the one fed with 10 g/L cellulose and cellulase was 69%. Under the three conditions with cellulase, the enzyme promoted cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen production was performed by the anaerobic bacteria. Sequences of the bands from DGGE were associated with two phyla, Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 5 ). These phyla include hydrogen-producing bacteria, such as Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter, respectively. These microorganisms are the most widely studied among H2-producing bacteria [43,56,57]. Clostridium is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped strict anaerobe and forms endospores [58]. Enterobacter is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped facultative anaerobe [59]. In reactors with cellulase, the bands (1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E) were similar to those of hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Clostridium sp. (Fig. 5). The investigation of the microbial diversity of a mesophilic hydrogen-producing sludge revealed the presence of Clostridia species, representing 64.6% [60]. A culture dominated by Clostridia can be easily obtained by heat shocking biological sludge [4]. The sequences had 95–99% similarities with the closest known species (Table 4 ). The bands retrieved from DGGE of samples from the reactors without cellulase (2B, 2C and 2D) were 99% similar to Enterobacter sp. (Fig. 5) The sequence was deposited in the database by Suen et al. [61], who evaluated the microbial communities present inside herbivorous insects such as termites. These authors found fungi and bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. These bacteria develop a symbiotic relationship with fungi when degrading cellulose. Although some species of Enterobacter have been described in the literature as H2 producers [62], H2 gas was not detected in this reactor, perhaps because the conditions (the absence of cellulase) were not amenable to the hydrolysis of cellulose. However, other compounds, such as those in the yeast extract, favored the growth of these bacteria. Bands 2A, 6A, 6B and 6C were related to the order Clostridiales, exhibiting 96% of similarity [63]. Band 4A was 95% similar to a Clostridium sp. isolated from an anaerobic reactor [64]. This microorganism is usually responsible for hydrogen production; however, in the present study, hydrogen was not detected in this reactor. This result may be due to the lack of soluble carbohydrates, which would allow hydrogen production by these Clostridium species. Band 7B (leachate in natura) was similar to the sequences of prokaryotes and uncultured bacteria. It was expected that there would be a wide variety of microorganisms in the inoculum because it was not submitted to any pretreatment. Band 7A was similar to sequences of bacteria belonging to the family Idiomarinaceae, specifically Pseudidiomarina sp. The bacteria were isolated from marine environments and were deposited in the database by Huang et al. [65] and Siddharth et al. [66]."
13,Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene,"3.3 Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene The reactor with 10 g/L cellulose with cellulase was selected for the cloning experiment due to the higher production of H2. All clones were similar to the family Clostridiaceae and genus Clostridium. The phylogenetic tree derived from the consensus sequences obtained from the cloning experiment is presented in Fig. 6 (Table 5 ). Most of the clones (86) were related to a Clostridium sp., sequence deposited in the database by Tamburini et al. [67]. These investigators characterized the pectinolytic microorganisms present in soaking water from the textile industry, isolating aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The anaerobic microorganisms isolated exhibited pectinolytic activity and were related to the genus Clostridium. The conditions used in this study favored the selection of microorganisms of the genus Clostridium, recognized in the literature as a producer of H2. Burrell et al. [54] also identified strains of Clostridium in an anaerobic reactor fed with cellulose and leachate from a landfill. Many Clostridium species are capable of producing hydrogen, including Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, C. butyricum, C. kluyveri and Clostridium pasteurianum, some of which are known to be acidophilic [68,69]. Clone 1 showed 99% of similarity with C. acetobutylicum (accession number X68182.1), which sequence was deposited by Collins et al. [70]. These authors performed the taxonomic characterization of a rod-shaped Gram-positive endospore-forming bacterium isolated from chilled meat. C. acetobutylicum is a species that requires a source of carbohydrates, biotin and p-aminobenzoic acid for development. This species produces cellobiase and carboxymethyl cellulase, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cellulose [2]. Recently, it was discovered that the genome of this bacterium contains a cellulosomal gene cluster (encoding cellulose-degrading enzymes) [71], however, it is well known that C. acetobutylicum is unable to hydrolyze cellulose [72,73]. In this work, the addition of biotin and p-aminobenzoic acid to the culture medium may have favored the growth of this bacteria. Acetic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid, butanol, acetone, CO2 and H2 are the products obtained during fermentation by C. acetobutylicum [2,74]. C. acetobutylicum produces acetic and butyric acids, and the increase in the concentration of butyric acid causes a reduction in the pH (<5.0), as we observed in the reactors. In this study, H2 production by C. acetobutylicum occurred primarily via butyric acid (65%), the principal by-product generated in the reactor fed with 10 g/L of cellulose with cellulase."
14,Conclusions,"This research has confirmed that leachate can be utilized as an inoculum source for hydrogen production from hydrolyzed cellulose. The heat shock effectively selected H2-producing microorganisms and inhibited methanogens archaea. The bacterial diversity considerably decreased after pretreatment of inoculum and the hydrogen production was mainly associated with Clostridium sp. The maintenance of pH in an optimal range (5.5–6.5) is essential to avoid the rapid inhibition of the fermentative activity by low pH values. In all the assays with cellulase, inhibition of hydrogen production in acidic pH was observed. Despite the influence of pH aforementioned, a greater hydrogen production by the increase of substrate concentration was verified. Butyric acid was the principal by-product generated in all tests with cellulase, hence hydrogen production proceeded primarily by butyric acid fermentation pathway."
