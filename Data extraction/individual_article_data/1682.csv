0,Introduction,"Investigation of the thermophysical properties of the binary solutions at various temperatures is an important area in physical chemistry. The accurate knowledge of different thermophysical parameters of organic liquid mixtures is important for the optimal design of different types of applicable instruments in chemical industrials [1]. They are also used for the understanding of solvent chemical and physical behaviour at different temperatures. By using these parameters with the help of mathematical equations, the volumetric, transport, and acoustic properties are calculated. The volumetric properties are used to estimate various types of molecular interactions between different components and these interactions are more helpful in chemical, nuclear, and leather industries [2]. Further, the stability and speed of reaction in the industries are understood by using volumetric properties [3] and the information about these properties is helpful for the design of industrial chemical processes [4]. Earlier, several researchers [5–9] have been focussed on the investigation of thermophysical and volumetric properties of non-ideal binary liquid mixtures containing various types of alcohol and amine. The aim of the present studies is mainly to examine the type and strength of intermolecular interactions and the effect of temperature on derived properties of non-aqueous binary liquid mixtures. For this purpose, isopentyl alcohol and butylamine are chosen as solvents and these are polar, non-poison, environmentally friendly, and protic organic non-electrolytic liquids. These are self-associated through the formation of H-bonding. The butylamine acts as a good Lewis-base and nucleophile and also acts as a ligand for the metal complex formation. BA is widely used as a hardener for epoxy resins and blue shades of disperses dyes. It is extensively used in the manufacture of tolbutamide and pharmaceutical applications [10]. IPA is one of the most common substances used as a solvent for the composition of perfumes and the synthesis of fruit essences. Further, it is also used as an intermediate in the production of amyl acetate and other amyl esters [11]. In this paper, new density values were measured and reported for the binary system of IPA (1) + BA (2) as a function of mole fraction of IPA at ten temperatures with 5 K intervals (288.15–333.15) K under atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa). According to the experimental results, volumetric properties such as molar volume ( V m ), excess molar volume ( V m E ), apparent molar volumes ( V m , ∅ , 1 and V m , ∅ , 2 ), partial molar volumes ( V - m , 1 and V - m , 2 ), and excess partial molar volumes ( V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E ) values over the entire mole fraction were computed and partial molar volumes ( V ¯ m , 1 ° and V ¯ m , 2 ° ), and excess partial molar volumes ( V ¯ m , 1 ° E and V ¯ m , 2 ° E ) values of isopentyl alcohol and butylamine at infinite dilutions were also computed at ten temperatures. Further, the V m E was described by using PFP theory and obtained results from this theory compared to experimental values. The V m E quantity was fitted with the R-K equation and the standard deviations determined. From the volumetric properties results, intermolecular interactions are analysed and discussed. 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopic studies were added to the experimental findings of the examined mixtures."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The liquid substances were used, isopentyl alcohol (mass fraction purity ≥ 0.990 ) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries and butylamine (mass fraction purity ≥ 0.995 ) was bought from Merck company. The components were used without further any purification. Before using, the purity of solvents was verified and confirmed by a gas chromatograph (GC). The detailed information of used chemicals is shown in Table 1 ."
3,Apparatus and procedures,"2.2 Apparatus and procedures All the investigation of IPA (1) + BA (2) binary solution samples were prepared freshly and kept in an air-tight Stoppard glass vial closed firmly with parafilm until further use. By using an electronic analytical balance (Dhona100DS model), the mass of the examined samples was determined to an accuracy of ± 0.0001 g. The mole fraction of IPA and BA were calculated and uncertainty was estimated to be ± 0.0005. The density of pure IPA, pure BA, and their binary mixtures of IPA (1) + BA (2) was determined using a pycnometer of 25 cm3. This instrument was filled with a proper amount of test sample and inserted into a thermostatic water bath using an agitator for 30 min. The pycnometer was calibrated with redistilled water at ten temperatures (288.15 to 333.15) K at 5 K intervals. To carry out this experiment, the procedure was repeated more than 3 times. The combined expanded uncertainty in the density was ± 0.020 g· c m - 3 . By using a temperature controller thermostatic water bath (INSREF model; IRI-016C, India), the required temperature was maintained with the precision of ± 0.01 K. 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra of the studied pure liquids and their equimolar mole fraction solution were measured using a 500 MHz Bruker Advance III spectrometer and a Nicolet (Nexus 670) FT-IR spectrometer. Deuterium reagent CDCl3 was used as a solvent for the measurement of 1H NMR. FT-IR spectra were recorded (4000 to 400) c m - 1 range with a resolution of c m - 1 ."
4,Results and discussion,"The density data of all solutions were calculated according to Eq. (1) [12]: (1) ρ / g c m - 3 = M V Where M and V are the mass and volumes of liquid mixtures. The experimental density data, together with the literature data [6,13–16], for the individuals isopentyl alcohol and butylamine at the measured temperatures are given in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Figs. 1 and 2 show a comparison of the experimental and literature density values of the isopentyl alcohol and butylamine at ten studied temperatures and a close agreement between experimental with the literature values is found. Also, the values of the experimental literature density show an almost linear decrease with rising temperature and they follow the same trend. The greatest deviations of density for isopentyl alcohol concerning literature value [13] are 0.03% at 293.15 K. The maximum deviations for butylamine concerning the reported value [16] is 0.05% at 313.15 K. After successfully validating the density measurements with pure isopentyl alcohol and butylamine, the densities of the mixture samples of (IPA + BA) were measured at the temperatures T = (288.15 to 333.15) K using 5 K intervals under atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa). The measured values of density for all the mixtures are noted in Supporting Information Table S2 at T = (288.15–333.15) K and the variation trend with the composition of IPA at various temperatures is shown in Fig.3 . The experimental values of density for the IPA (1) + BA (2) liquid mixtures are positive over the full range of the mole fraction of IPA at ten temperatures. The graph shows that in Fig.3 the density values decrease with the increasing temperature at an constant mole fraction whereas they increase linearly with an increasing composition of IPA at a particular temperature. There is no crossover of the curves at the measured temperatures, and all of the isotherms show smooth curves with almost the same trend. The IPA and BA molecules obtain appropriate thermal energy to move and the distance between the molecules increases when the temperature increases; therefore, when the volume of a given mass of the binary system increases, the density decreases [17]. When the temperature is constant, the density of mixtures gradually increases with increasing mole fraction of isopentyl alcohol due to the pure isoamyl alcohol having the greater density than pure butylamine under the same conditions. Fig. 4 displays a comparison of current density data for the studied system with those of ref. [9] at 308.15 K temperature. The present density values and literature values follow the same trend but a small deviation is observed. The molar volumes of binary liquid mixtures were determined by using Eq. (1) [18]: (2) V m / c m 3 m o l - 1 = 1 ρ m ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i Here ρ m represents the density of the liquid mixtures, x i and M i denote the mole fraction and molar mass of pure solvents, respectively. The obtained values of V m are shown in Supporting Information Table S3 at ten temperatures and shown in Fig. 5 . The V m values are positive and increase linearly with increasing content of IPA at a given temperature as well as increasing temperature when the IPA composition is fixed. There is no crossover of the curves at ten temperatures, and they follow the same trend. The V m of the liquid mixtures was increased with the amount of IPA increasing due to the V m of IPA was more than the V m of BA in pure states under the same conditions. The intermolecular distance between IPA and BA molecules were increased with rising temperature; consequently, the molar volume of the binary solution was increased. The V m E values of IPA (1) + BA (2) liquid mixtures were computed by using Eq. (3) and experimental data [19]: (3) V m E / c m 3 m o l - 1 = ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i ρ m - ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i ρ i Where ρ i and ρ m are on behalf of the density of pure components and liquid mixtures, and the results of V m E data were reported in Supporting Information Table S4 and fitted in Fig. 6 . The binary mixtures of V m E values are move from the ideal axis as interpreted into two terms, namely repulsion and attractive interactions. The repulsion interactions in molecules result in an increase in volume, which involves breaking of H-bonds and dipole–dipole liquid order on adding with the second component, unfavorable (packing effect) interactions in the mixture; therefore, positive contributions to V m E from the ideal axis [20]. The attractive interactions in molecules result in a reduce in volume, which includes charge-transfer model interactions, acid-base kind of interactions, H-bonding type interactions, geometrical fitting category interactions between the two species; consequently, negative contributions to V m E from the ideal behaviour [21]. Fig. 6 showed the V m E data for the IPA (1) + BA (2) liquid system at ten temperatures, the negative values were determined over the whole composition of IPA (0 ≤ x 1 ≤ 1) and firstly decreased with the addition of IPA to the mixtures up to IPA mole fraction ( x 1 = 0.5) and then increased with a further increase in the IPA content at a certain temperature. It is clear that lower volume solution mixtures were formed compared to pure components due to the unlike molecules that were strongly associated through three possible interactions. They are H-bonding, Lewis acid-base, and molecules fitting interactions. When the addition of BA with IPA would induce breaking of self-associated H-bonds present in pure liquids and subsequent formation of new H–N⋯⋯H–O and N–H⋯⋯O–H types of H-bonds (main contribution bonds) between unlike components [5], greater strength of newly H-bonds were formed between isopentyl alcohol and butylamine in the mixture, as compared to the H-bonds within pure isopentyl alcohol and butylamine. This means that the newly-established H-bonds in the mixture are stronger, and thus, at lower energy levels, resulting in greater stability. The minimum of excess molar volume occurred at the isopentyl alcohol composition of almost 0.5 for all temperatures. This most probably indicates that the strongest interactions occur in this composition range. The second probable mechanism is Lewis acid-base interaction that occurs in investigated mixtures because the IPA acts as a Lewis acid and BA actsas a Lewis base [22]. The third possible reason for the negative values of excess molar volumes could be the interstitial accommodations in the mixtures [23]. The sizes and shapes of the created free volumes among the molecules in the mixtures can be such that they may be occupied more easily and to a greater extent by the smaller molecules, as compared to the states of pure isopentyl alcohol and butylamine. This fitting interaction is less favourable due to their having less free volume difference under the same conditions. Each one of these three mechanisms, or all, may be responsible for the negative excess molar volumes of the mixtures. The strength of intermolecular interactions in the unlike molecules is as follows: H-bonding interaction > Lewis acid-base interaction > molecules fitting interaction. As shown in Fig.6, when the mole fraction of IPA was constant, the absolute V m E values increased with increasing temperature. Upon the rise of temperature, energetically three types of mechanisms occur in the mixtures investigated. First, as temperature increases, the distances between the molecules in the mixture increases, which affect the sizes of the free volumes which increase. In this way, more of the smaller molecules can easily fill the free volumes and this action results in higher interstitial accommodation. Eventually, the values of excess molar volumes would tend to larger negative values. A second possible mechanism is that the H-bonds breakdown as temperature increases, which occurs for both pure components and their mixtures. This affects the strength of H-bonding interactions between the molecules whiich usually decrease. The more H-bonds breakdown in the pure components as compared to the mixture determines whether the result of this mechanism on V m E is to make it more or less negative upon temperature increase [9,24]. In the examined mixtures of this study, it is detected (Fig. 6) that by raising the temperature, the values of V m E move to greater negative values. Thus, it possible that bond breakdown occurs to a greater degree for the pure components than for their mixtures. The third mechanism between molecules is the Lewis acid-base interaction. This interaction decreases as temperature rises because molecules increase distance with each other so that the degree of that interaction is decreased. In the present study, the mechanism of greater interstitial accommodation would have to dominate the effect of H-bonds breakdown and Lewis acid-base interaction resulting in greater negative values of V m E at higher temperature. This shows more non-ideal behaviour at a higher temperature. Fig.7 displays a comparison of this work for excess molar volume with those of ref. [9] at 298.15 K. The V m E values agree with the literature values but lower negative values were determined. Further, the experimental excess molar volume is compared to theoretical results. The theoretical values were calculated utilizing the PFP theory [25-27] and these theory details are given in the Supporting Information. The computed equimolar values of the interaction parameter, experimental and theoretical results of V m E for the studied system are reported in Table 2 at ten temperatures. The obtained V m E values from the PFP theory show good agreement with experimental results at all temperatures. By using popular polynomial R-K Eq. (4) [28], the excess molar volumes of liquid systems were calculated and correlated to experimentally obtained results. (4) V m , c a l c d E / c m 3 m o l - 1 = x 1 x 2 ∑ i = 0 4 A i 2 x i - 1 i Where A i is the adjustable parameter. The standard deviation (σ) between experimental and calculated values of V m E was computed using the following relation [29]. (5) σ = ∑ V m , e x p t l E - V m , c a l c d E 2 / p - n 1 / 2 Where p is the number of experimental points and n is the number of free parameters of the fitting equation. The determined A i values and standard deviations (σ) are tabulated in Table 3 . From the σ values, it can be concluded that the V m E values for the binary solutions of IPA (1) + BA (2) with the lowest values of σ correlated well by the R-K model. The apparent molar volume of components 1 and 2 in the liquid mixtures were calculated based on Eqs. (6) and (7) [12]: (6) V m , ∅ , 1 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = x 2 M 2 x 1 × ρ 2 - ρ m ρ 2 ρ m + M 1 ρ m (7) V m , ∅ , 2 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = x 1 M 1 x 2 × ρ 1 - ρ m ρ 1 ρ m + M 2 ρ m Where V m , ∅ , 1 and V m , ∅ , 2 rpresent the apparent molar volume of isopentyl alcohol and butylamine and the values obtained are listed in Table 4 at ten temperatures. The V m , ∅ , 1 values increase and V m , ∅ , 2 values decrease with increasing IPA content at certain temperatures and at the same time, components 1 and 2 for apparent molar volumes increase with increasing temperature when IPA content is constant. The V m , ∅ , 1 and V m , ∅ , 2 values increase due to the total molecular structure association increasing with a rise in temperature. Therefore weak intermolecular interactions in IPA and BA molecules are observed at higher temperatures [30]. The partial molar volumes, V - m , 1 of isopentyl alcohol and V - m , 2 of butylamine in these liquid mixtures over the total mole fraction of IPA were assessed according to the following relations [31]: (8) V - m , 1 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V m E + V m , 1 ∗ + ( 1 - x 1 ) ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P (9) V - m , 2 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V m E + V m , 2 ∗ - x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P Where V m , 1 ∗ and V m , 2 ∗ indicate the molar volumes of pure solvents, IPA and BA, respectively. The ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P derivative in Eqs. (7) and (8) were obtained by differentiation of R-K Eq.4 for V m E with respect to x 1 subsequently, substituting its value in the above Eqs. (7) and (8) leads to the following Eqs. (10) and (11) for the partial molar volumes of IPA ( V - m , 1 ) and BA ( V - m , 2 ) [32]: (10) V - m , 1 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V m , 1 ∗ + 1 - x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i 1 - 2 x i i - 2 x 1 1 - x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i i 1 - 2 x 1 i - 1 (11) V - m , 2 / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V m , 2 ∗ + 1 - x 1 2 ∑ i = 0 n A i 1 - 2 x i i + 2 x 1 2 1 - x 1 ∑ i = 0 n A i i 1 - 2 x 1 i - 1 The values obtained for V - m , 1 and V - m , 2 of the examined liquid system are given in Table 5 at observed temperature points. Table 5 shows that the V - m , 1 and V - m , 2 values are positive and increase with raising temperature at the same concentration of IPA, which is the best indication that the overall volume expansion is greater compared to components in the liquid mixtures. Therefore, fewer intermolecular interactions are determined at a higher temperature. The excess partial molar volumes were calculated utilizing the Eqs. (12) and (13) [33]: (12) V - m , 1 E / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V - m , 1 - V m , 1 ∗ (13) V - m , 2 E / c m 3 m o l - 1 = V - m , 2 - V m , 2 ∗ The calculated values of V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E as a function of the composition of isopentyl alcohol for the studied unlike molecules in the system are listed in Table 6 at ten temperatures. From this Table, it can be observed that V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E values are negative over the total mole fraction of IPA at all temperatures. This indicates that the molar volume for both isopentyl alcohol and butylamine in the liquid mixtures is lower than their respective molar volume in the pure state, i.e., there is a reduction in volume on mixing IPA with BA [34]. Negative values were obtained due to the unlike molecules associated with the formation of newly established H-bonds. Overall, the negative V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E values indicate that the interactions occur between dissimilar components, whereas the positive V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E values show the interactions to occur in similar molecules [35]. The partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes at infinite dilution at every temperature were evaluated based on the following relations [36]: (14) V ¯ m , 1 ° / cm 3 mol - 1 = V m , 1 ∗ + ∑ i = o 4 A i (15) V m , 2 ∗ / cm 3 mol - 1 = V m , 2 ∗ + ∑ i = 0 4 A i - 1 i (16) V ¯ m , 1 ° E / cm 3 mol - 1 = = V ¯ m , 1 E - V m , 1 ∗ (17) V ¯ m , 2 ° E / cm 3 mol - 1 = V ¯ m , 2 E - V m , 2 ∗ The calculated values of V m , 1 ∗ , V ¯ m , 1 ° , V ¯ m , 1 ° E , V m , 2 ∗ , V ¯ m , 2 ° and V ¯ m , 2 ° E for the studied liquid system at each temperature are reported in Table 7 . The present study shows values of V ¯ m , 1 ° E and V ¯ m , 2 ° E are negative at all investigated temperatures and they increase with rising. This indicates that the molar volume for both isopentyl alcohol and butylamine in their mixtures is lower than their respective values of molar volume in the pure state [37]. By comparing the values, it is seen that at all teemperatures, the values of excess partial molar volumes at infinite dilution for butylamine are morer negative than for isopentyl alcohol at a similar temperature. This shows that butylamine has the greater tendency to be solvated by isopentyl alcohol molecules than vice versa. Accordingly this indicates that the H-bond network in the mixture of isopentyl alcohol + butylamine is probably created in a pattern in which the butylamine pseudo-molecules are located at central positions, and surrounded by isopentyl alcohol molecules. Therefore, the total volume of mixtures is reduced at all temperatures. Proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra established that no chemical reaction occurred between molecules and physical interactions such as hydrogen bonding, only. The 1H NMR spectra of IPA (1) + BA (2) liquid system with 0%, 50%, and 100% IPA concentrations is shown in Fig.8 . In the 1H NMR of pure IPA, the chemical shift of hydroxyl H appeared at δ = 2.49 × 10-6 (1H), - CH2-O - hydrogen occurs at δ = 3.62 × 10−6 (2H), - CH2 - hydrogen at δ = 1.69 x10-6 (2H), - CH - hydrogen at δ = 1.42 × 10-6 (H) and δ = 0.87 × 10−6 (3H) came from the hydrogen on methyl group. Meanwhile, chemical diversion of - CH3 - hydrogen obtained at δ = 0.83 × 10-6 (3H), δ = 1.30 × 10-6 (2H) are due to the hydrogen on - CH2 - , δ = 1.65 × 10-6 (2H) appeared because of the hydrogen on - CH2 - , - CH2-N - hydrogen is at δ = 4.74 × 10-6 (2H) and amine H shows at δ = 2.56 × 10-6 (2H) in the spectra of pure BA. When IPA and BA were mixed with equimolar concentration (50% IPA + 50% BA), as shown in Fig. 6, it can be seen that the chemical shift of the H atom of the alcoholic group in IPA had shifted to δ = 2.64 × 10-6 and also this peak came from the H atom of the amine group in BA. This suggests that the formation of new H-bonds between hydroxyl hydrogen atoms in IPA with nitrogen atoms of BA and vice-versa, which results in the electron cloud becoming thinner and decreasing the shielding effect of the H-bonding proton involved [38]; therefore, the H-bonded peak appears with greater shift chemical shift in the studied mixtures studied. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is the best spectroscopy for the determination of new H-bonds between different components. Fig.9 shows the FT-IR spectra of pure IPA, pure BA, and their equimolar composition at the range (400 to 4000) c m - 1 . The experimental FT-IR frequencies obtained with wavenumbers, υ( c m - 1 ) and shifting of bands of the IPA (1) + BA (2) liquid system are tabulated in Table 8 . The FT-IR data obtained support the formation of new H-bonds between isopentyl alcohol and butylamine. A change in stretching vibration frequencies of the N–H bond and O–H bond in the 1:1 mixture can be spotted. So, hydrogens of butylamine can easily escape towards the oxygen atom of isopentyl alcohol through the formation of the hydrogen bond, resulting in the lower frequency that are determined [39]. The shifts confirm the existence of cross association through H-bonds between IPA and BA molecules in the mixtures."
5,Conclusions,"In this work, the various volumetric parameters of isopentyl alcohol with butylamine binary liquid system, viz., V m , V m E , V m , ∅ , 1 and V m , ∅ , 2 , V - m , 1 and V - m , 2 , V - m , 1 E and V - m , 2 E over the full composition range; V ¯ m , 1 ° and V ¯ m , 2 ° , V ¯ m , 1 ° E and V ¯ m , 2 ° E of the components at infinite dilution are reported at T = (288.15 to 333.15) K at 5 K intervals and at 0.1 MPa pressure. These parameters were obtained from measured density (ρ) at ten temperatures. The experimental values of V m E were correlated to the R-K modal and compared to those obtained from PFP theory and shows good agreement. The values of V m E , V ¯ m , 1 E and V ¯ m , 2 E , V ¯ m , 1 ° E and V ¯ m , 2 ° E are negative, which suggests that the formation of new H-bonds between IPA and BA molecules. The H-bond is formed by an O atom on - O H o f I P A and H atom on - N H 2 o f B A and vice-versa and which is confirmed by spectral techniques. According to volumetric and spectral results, the formation of new H-bonding interaction between isopentyl alcohol and butylamine molecules with structures (CH3)2CH(CH2)2O - H ⋯⋯NH2(CH2)2CH3 and (CH3)2CH(CH2)2 HO ⋯⋯ HNH(CH2)2CH3 was determined."
