0,Introduction,"H2 production using semiconductor materials has been recognized as one of the eye-catching methodologies for resolving the various energy and environmental issues posed by conventional methodologies [1–4]. TiO2 (with rutile and anatase phases) is still well-studied photocatalyst mainly due to its less cost, chemical stability, and eco-friendliness [5,6]. However, the pure TiO2 semiconductor establishes reduced photocatalytic activities due to the higher recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. It has been previously reported that the loading of precious metals such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles can act as excellent co-catalyst on the TiO2 surface which can promote the separation of charges effectively in photo-generated carriers [7,8]. Particularly, the metallic Au can serve as smart co-catalysts to facilitate the H2 generation and degradation efficiency of the host TiO2 due to its outstanding electrical conductivity [9]. Neverthless, the photocatalytic performances of Au deposited TiO2 is still inadequate when compared with Pt decorated TiO2 due to the weaker bond strength and lower free energiesinbonding hydrogen in the host TiO2 material. Therefore, it's still extremely meaningful to progress the H2 production of Au-decorated TiO2 photocatalyst [10]. In the other hand the acceleration in industrialization development in cities has emphasized phenolic compounds as building blocks for various polymers discharged from textile and pharma factories [11]. The complex structure of the phenolic compounds present in water bodies makes their degradation exceptionally difficult. The phenolic compounds have a seriously negative impact on aquatic lives and the human race [12]. Exertions have been made to remove the organic pollutants by cost-effective treatment processes [13]. Thus, semiconductor photocatalysts with capabilities to degrade the wide range of phenolic pollutants under visible light, have been studied recent days due to their cost-effectiveness, high efficiency, and no secondary pollutants generated in water bodies [14]. Semiconductor photocatalysts namely, ZnO and TiO2 have been used as commercial photocatalysts [15]. TiO2 is considered to be an important material due to its good oxidizing ability, and nontoxicity. But drawbacks of TiO2 include the fast recombination rate of excitons, poor response under solar energy, and lower cyclability for industrial purposes. Modifying TiO2 with Fe2O3 can improve the photocatalytic activity in real-time applications [16]. However, the heterojunctions prepared from conventional sol-gel methods are prone to severe agglomeration, which decreases its surface area due to vander Waals forces. The agglomerated nano-catalyst is difficult to perform the expected photocatalytic performances resulting in great challenges to a wide range of practical applications [17–20]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOF's), are known as three dimensional architectures with higher porosity, is considered to be an ideal candidate for the photocatalyst [21,22]. Great efforts have been completed to use MOF as novel prevailing supports for the preparation of semiconductor materials [23]. Recently, MOFs as sacrificial templates to fabricate TiO2 nanostructures is gaining more attention [24]. MOFs with abudant confined pores can form a homogeneous structure, which promotes the electron mobility and supplies more reactive sites. However, the incomplete visible light absorption capability of the TiO2 prepared by MOF route has considerably limited its application in the photocatalyst process. The synthesis of efficient MOF derived TiO2 system photocatalytic systemsis still a big challenge [25]. Therefore, a useful technique is required to improve the visible light reactions of TiO2 and increase its photocatalytic performance by combination with any other catalyst which has narrow bandgap energies. In general, Fe2O3 is well thought-out as aperfect candidate to advancethe photocatalytic properties of active TiO2 under UV. Furthermore, plasmonic catalysts can also be implemented to enhance the photocatalytic performances of rutile or anatase phase TiO2 due to the existence of SPR (surface plasmon resonance effect). It is investigated that SPR catalyst can increase the visible-light responses and restricts the quick electron-holes recombination [26,27]. Moreover MOFs derived TiO2 and Fe2O3 nanostructures have been employed in various fields such as photocatalysis, gas storage, biosensors and chemisorption, etc. Thus, MOF derived TiO2 and Fe2O3 have attracted great attention owing to its high surface area, outstanding porosity, and lower density. Many experimental reports that on the MOF derived semiconductors have shown that these architectures can act as a outstanding photocatalysts under visible irradiation. In this present work, we have successfully prepared the TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 hybrids with a hierarchical structure via a simple metal organic framework assisted (MOF) method. The synthesized composite was applied to the photo-degradation of two phenolic compounds namely 2,4 dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 4-bromophenol (4-B,P) respectively. The Au-TiO2/Fe2O3 catalyst prepared by the MOF assisted route exhibited wide light response range the reduced the agglomeration effect and high recyclablity. The Au-TiO2/Fe2O3composite is an excellent outlook for extensive applications in wastewater treatment and energy sector."

3,Synthesis of the TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 composites,"2.2 Synthesis of the TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 composites 2.2.1 Synthesis of Ti-Fe-MOF Fe (NO3)3·9H2O (2 mmol), and Ti (C4H9O)4 (2 mmol) was mixed with 40 mL of DMF and 5 ml methanol and stirred at 30 °C for 20 min and the yellow color mixture was named as solution A. The powderred form of terephthalic acid (2 mmol) was mixed with 20 mL of DMF and constantly stirred using magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 60 min, and it can be referred as solution B. Then, solution A was transferred into solution B, and it was allowed to stir for an additional 60 min. Finally, the homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 75 mL Teflon lined autoclave, and kept at a temperature of 160 °C in a muffle furnace for 10 h at air atmosphere. Afterward, the mixture was naturally cooled and the solution was washed thoroughly with ethanol, THF, and finally dehydrated at vacuum at 80 °C overnight to get a brown powder. 2.2.2 Synthesis of TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 composites The synthesized Ti-Fe-MOF (0.150 g) was dispersed in 30 mL of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) with the help of ultrasonication and the amount of HAuCl4 in water was varied. After it was completely dispersed, the suspension was transferred to a 70 mL Teflon lined autoclave and treated at 120 °C for 6 h. After the product was cooled, the pale brown precipitate was heated at 400 °C under air atmosphere for 3 h to obtain a TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 nanocomposite. Five products were synthesized via the same method, TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 (0.5%), TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 (2%), TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 (3%), TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 (4%) and TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 (5%), according to the weight percentage of Au loadings."
4,Characterization studies,"2.3 Characterization studies The p-XRD (powder X-ray diffraction) characterizations of the TiO2/Fe2O3, and TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 nanocomposite were recorded under the ambient atmosphere by a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer. The measurements were performed under Cu-Kα irradiation (λ = 0.154 nm) with a average scanning rate of 5° min−1 at 2θ values from the 2 theta 10 to 80°. The morphological features and structural properties of the TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 nanocomposite were executed by a high beam scanning electron (field-emission) microscope using, SIGMA HV-Carl Zeiss fitted with EDS detector manufactured by Bruker Quantax Z10 model) and transmission electron images were analyzed by a JEOL JEM-1230 microscope. XPS-ESCA (X-ray photoelectron spectra) was recorded by Omicron GMBH instrument system fitted with Al-Kα irradiation. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a HORIBA spectrometer with a laser excitation of 300 nm. To evaluate the chemical states, the binding energy of all elements has been standardized using the C1s spectrum observed at 284.6 eV. UV–vis DRS (diffuse reflectance spectra) were recorded on a Jasco, V-750 UV–vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength ranges from 200 to 800 nm using BaSO4 as an internal standard. The EIS spectra of the samples were documented over the frequency range from 100 Hz to 0.01 Hz using Autolab instrument using a conventional three-electrode system."
5,"Photodegradation of 2,4-DCP and 4-BP","2.4 Photodegradation of 2,4-DCP and 4-BP Photo-degradation of 2,4-DCP, and 4-BP was performed in the batch process under visible light illumination. A sodium lamp with a maximum intensity of 200 W Philips was employed as the visible light source. To avoid heating, the lamp was covered by a water-cooler fitted with a condenser. The prepared photocatalyst was mixed to the 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP standard solution (10 mg−1). To ensure the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between pollutants and the catalysts, the mixture was stirred continously continuously in the dark and then the mixture was illumination under the visible light. During the degradation process, the remnant concentration of the 2, 4 DCP, and 4-BP solutions was measured at various time intervals. The final absorption as concentrations i.e. Ct of the 2, 4-DCP and 4-BP in the solution was deliberate by using standard curve method. The degradation efficiency of the TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 samples was calculated as follows, C/C0% = [(C0 − C)/C0] × 100%, whereas C0 is the original concentration, and C was is concentrations at a provided time (t)."
6,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction The H2 production performances of the as-prepared TiO2/Au/Fe2O3 materials were performed under visible light illumination using a 200 W Xenon lamp (380–900 nm), and glycerol was used as a sacrificial agent. In a typical process, 5 mg of Au loaded TiO2/Fe2O3 and unloaded TiO2/Fe2O3 materials were dispersed into 50 mL of the water-glycerol mixture (95/5 by v/v). The mixture was stirred under dark for 20 min. Then the mixture was underwent N2 purging for 15 min to eliminate the dissolved oxygen (DO). Then, the mixture was illuminated under visible light withg constant stirring at 2500 rpm. At particular time intervals, the generated H2 gas was collected through the syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detectors using N2 carrier gas."
7,Results and discussion,
8,`XRD analysis,"3.1 `XRD analysis In the XRD patterns from Fig. 1 of MOF derived Fe2O3/TiO2, all the diffraction peaks marked with (a)can be indexed to Fe2O3 marked with (a) which matched well with JCPDS card No. 33-0664 [28], with a space group: R3c, ao = 5.03 Å bo = 5.03 Å co = 13.7 Å and TiO2 marked with (b) matched well with JCPDS card No. 65-5714 [29], with a space group of I41/amd, ao = 3.78A bo = 3.78 Å co = 9.51 Å. The XRD results confirmed that the Ti–Fe MOF has been successfully converted into Fe2O3/TiO2 metal oxides. No impurity peaks or secondary phases are noticed, representing the high purity of Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite. For Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 (4 wt%) sample, the peaks belonging to Au (111) and (200) diffraction were observed at 2 theta value of 38.2° and 43.8°, indicating the co-existence of Au nanoparticles [30]. Furthermore, for the Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 (4 wt%) composite the lattice parameters was almost same as Fe2O3/TiO2 demonstrating that the crystalinity of Fe2O3/TiO2 does not changed after the successful Au-deposition. It can be attributed to that Au is dispersed uniformly on the Fe2O3/TiO2surface which is highly beneficial for advanced photocatalytic performances [31]."
9,FESEM analysis,"3.2 FESEM analysis FESEM was conducted to examine the morphological and microstructure of the synthesized Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 (4 wt%) sample. Fig. 2 (a–d) implies the FESEM images of Fe2O3/TiO2 samples. The Fe2O3/TiO2 composites comprising of irregular TiO2 and cubical Fe2O3 particles exhibit fewer agglomerations.The TiO2 particles are aggregated on the cubical Fe2O3 with an absolute size of 50–60 nm. The 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/ TiO2 sample was relatively smooth in the image (Fig. 2 c, d), and the metallic Au particles were clearly distinguished in FESEM images [32]."
10,TEM images and HRTEM analysis,"3.3 TEM images and HRTEM analysis As shown in Fig. 3 (a) TEM images, TiO2 has clearly exhibited particle morphology. The 0.23 nm interplanar spacing is in accordance with that of (110) plane of Rutile TiO2, revealing the porous structured TiO2 was synthesized. For the Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 (4 wt%) ternary heterojunction photocatalyst, the irregular Fe2O3 cubical particles are formed in the range of 400–650 nm and are fewer aggregated [33]. Moreover, the TiO2 is located around Fe2O3 particles, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (b–c). The more detailed interface structure of Fe2O3 and TiO2 in the TEM studies reveals that the cubical Fe2O3 are intimately attached to the surface of TiO2 particles. The distance of lattice fringes of 0.27 nm, this is corresponding to (104) Fe2O3 lattice plane. The HRTEM photos in Fig. 3 (d–f) exemplifies the lattice spacing of 0.23 nm at the atomic Au sites corresponds to (111) facets of Au, indicating the presence of Au in the ternary (4 wt%) Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite. The results are matched well with the XRD analysis [34]. The HRTEM results further confirmed the (4 wt%) Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite have successfully formed, which is highly favourable for the separation of charge carriers in the photocatalytic pathway. Moreover, the EDS elemental mapping of 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite further confirms that 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite was comprised of elements Ti, O, Au and Fe, as shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that the uniform distribution of active sites playing a significant role in accelerating the photocatalyst process [35]. For accurate analysis the the even distribution of Au, Fe, Ti, and O elements was recorded on the surface of (4 wt%) Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite. It can be seen that Fe2O3, Au, and TiO2 particles have been uniformly deposited, which may improve the photocatalytic performances to a great extent [36]. Besides, the metallic Au nanoparticles were deposited successfully in the areas that have higher Fe2O3 and TiO2 concentrations. It confirms the connection between TiO2 and Fe2O3 was possible by Au nanoparticles in the ternary system [37]."
11,XPS studies,"3.4 XPS studies XPS studies was performed to confirm the chemical composition and various oxidation nature of (4 wt%) Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite [38]. The XPS survey spectrum results are shown in Fig. 5a. In which, Ti 2p, Fe 2p, O 1 s, C 1 s, and Au 4f elements were observed. The deconvoluted Ti 2p XPS spectrum was shown in Fig. 5b. The main peaks originated at 458.7 eV and 464.5 eV can be accredited to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively. The prominent peaks observed at 711.2 eV and 725.1 eV (Fig. 5 c) correspond to the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 from Fe (Ⅲ), indicating the presence of Fe2O3 [38]. Furthermore, in Fig. 5 d two major peaks of Au 4f (7/2 and 5/2 spins) has been observed with binding energies of 83.5 eV and 87.4 eV, respectively, representing the continuation of metallic Au in the ternary system [40]. The high-resolution XPS analysis of O 1s is provided in Fig. 5 e and the apparent peaks observed at 529.9 eV and 531.5eV are formed from the lattice oxygen and the chemisorbed oxygen of surface hydroxyls, respectively [39]. The XPS results exemplify that the 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite have been successfully synthesized using the MOF route."
12,UV-DRS analysis,"3.5 UV-DRS analysis The optical responses of the prepared photocatalysts were evaluated by UV-vis DRS analysis, and the spectra were given in Fig. 6 a. It can be observed that the strong absorption edge of Fe2O3/TiO2 was found nearly at 690 nm, which confirmed that, the synthesized Fe2O3/TiO2 which can be activated under the visible-light region. Besides, comparing with the Fe2O3/TiO2, the absorption edge of the 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite shows an obvious red shift further in visible range [41]. This indicates that 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite can utilize the visible light effectively. Furthermore, the energy gap of the Fe2O3/TiO2 and 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite estimated using the Kubelka-Munk relations as stated as follows (αhν)1/2 = A(hν -Eg), herein, α, ν, h, A and Eg represent the coefficient of absorption, frequency, Plank constant, proportionality constant and bandgap of the prepared semiconductor [28,29]. Based on the above-mentioned calculations the bandgaps of Fe2O3/TiO2, and 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite were estimated as 1.75 eV and 1.55 eV, and it was provided in Fig. 6 b which are consistent with the previous reports. Based on the above-mentioned calculations the bandgaps of Fe2O3/TiO2, and 4 wt% Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite were estimated as 1.75 eV and 1.55 eV, and it was provided in Fig. 6b which are consistent with the previous reports [42]."
13,Photocatalytic performances of prepared samples,"3.6 Photocatalytic performances of prepared samples The photocatalytic degradation properties of the as-synthesized Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 with different weight percentages of metallic Au, Fe2O3/TiO2, and pure TiO2 are conducted by monitoring the degradation of phenolic compounds 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP degraded under simulated visible light illumination as show in Fig. 7 (a, b) [43]. The photocatalytic responses of the Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalysts are studied towards the removal of 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP with the help of visible light for 90 min and 60 min. It is further noticed that the removal of 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP were greatly improved with the extension of visible light access time for the synthesized Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalysts [44]. The photocatalyst results convey that the performance of the Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 (4%) nanocomposite is higher than other photocatalysts with and without Au loadings [45]. It indicates that the formation of effective heterojunction and proper loadings of Au in Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst is encouraging to the electron-hole pairs separation, and ensuring in high degradation performances. During the photocatalytic process, the major absorption peaks of both 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP have been diminished with the 90 min and 60 min, respectively. Only 4 and 5 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst can degrade most of the 2,4-DCP, and 4-BP molecules under visible light [46]. The photocatalytic activities improvements has been observed and arranged in the sequence of Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (4%) > Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (5%) > Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (3%) > Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (2%) and Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (0.5%) > Fe2O3/TiO2. The degradation efficiency of 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP can be illustrated in Fig. 7 a, b. The pure Fe2O3 exhibits lower photocatalytic performances (~20.5% in 90 min for 2, 4-DCP, and ~22.5% in 60 min for 4-BP). In contrast, the Au loaded nanorods Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited improved degradation performances than the bare Fe2O3 and TiO2. For 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP degradation, the 2 0.5% Au-doped Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst and 2% Au-doped Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited similar degradation rate due to the fewer amount of Au doping in the host Fe2O3/TiO2 [47,48]. The highest removal rate could be observed in 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 (94% in 90 min for 2, 4 DCP, and 97% in 60 min for 4 BP), which is higher than 5 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 [49]. This might be attributed to the metallic Au nanoparticles can be aggregated beyond 4% loadings. Fig. 8 (a, b) shows the kinetics, i.e. -ln(C/C0) vs. time (t) for the all photocatalysts. The photocatalytic removal of 2, 4 DCP, and 4 BP was considered as a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, as pseudo first-order reaction established by the linear connection in the images. The 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite exhibited higher rate constants than pure Fe2O3 and TiO2 respectively (0.0076 min−1 for 2, 4-DCP, and 0.0071 min−1) respectively. Among various ternary Au doped Fe2O3/TiO2 nanostructures, 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite exhibited the highest rate constants values than that of the pure Fe2O3 and TiO2 alone [50]. The stability of photocatalyst is important parameter for commercial applications. As shown in Fig. 9 after four cycles, no obvious change in the 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP photodegradation was observed, implying the high stability of 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst. Besides, as provided in Fig. S1 there was no difference that could be displayed in the XRD patterns of 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite after cycle experiments indicating that the crystal phases of the prepared sample did not change. This result further confirmed the high stability of the 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite towards phenolic compounds degradations [51]. The radicals trapping studies were recorded in revealing the main reactive species generated in the photocatalytic pathway as shown in Fig. 10 (a, b). In the tests, isopropanol alcohol (IPA), Benzoquinone (BQ), and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were used as radical scavengers for hydroxyl radicals (.OH), superoxide anion radicals (.O2 −), and photo-generated electron (e−) respectively. The degradation efficiency of 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocompositefor degrading 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP without the addition of IPA, BQ, and AgNO3 under visible light illumination within 90 and 60 min was used for comparison, as provided in Fig. The degradation performances were slightly decreased by introducing AgNO3, however, the degradation was inhibited significantly in IPA, BQ revealing the OH and O2 − play a significant role in both 2, 4 DCP, and 4 BP degradation processes [52]."
14,Hydrogen production reactions,"3.7 Hydrogen production reactions The H2 production performances of the synthesized Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst were investigated from water-splitting using glycerol as a sacrificial reagent under the visible light Fig. 11 (a). Blank studies have proven that there is no H2 generation has been observed without the aid of any photocatalyst, and visible light irradiation exemplifies that no H2 gas is produced by simply in photolysis process [53]. It can be seen that pure Fe2O3 has insufficient H2 production. Even though Fe2O3 shows an excellent visible light absorption (i.e., low bandgap), but the H2 production activity was not appreciable owing to its quick recombination reactions of electron-hole pairs, in the medium and 58 μmol g−1 h−1of H2 was generated from pure Fe2O3, which is comparatively lower for commercialization. Similarly, pure TiO2 made a 142 μmol g−1 h−1 of H2, and it was studied that the H2 generation of pure TiO2 is constrained by slow kinetic reactions for water splitting due to the poor redox-active sites in TiO2. After the coupling of Fe2O3 with TiO2, the H2 generation was reached to about 392 μmol g−1 h−1, and this is almost twice than the pure Fe2O3. A sudden jump in the H2 production rate was observed when Au was introduced as 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite it reached about 590 μmol g−1 h−1. This could be ascribed to the existence of small amounts of Au on the Fe2O3/TiO2 surface, which alters and slow down the recombination rate, which arises from the proper bandgap alignment of these two Fe2O3 and TiO2 semiconductors by proper Au loading [54]. It is observed that the appropriate interactions between the coupled photocatalyst play a pivotal role in H2 production. Furthermore, a promising photocatalyst may be a great strength for commercial applications. Therefore, the photocatalytic stability of 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite was recorded with the continuation of the H2 production reaction for 7 h. As illustrated in Fig. 11 (b). a fewer decline in H2 production was observed after repeat the experiments three times The H2 generation results affirm that the 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite has prone to stable for H2 production, which may be ascribed to the effectual electron transport kinetics between the Fe2O3/TiO2 interface by Au deposition and stability of host TiO2 for H2 production using the photocatalyst process [55]."
15,Photocatalytic performance mechanism,"3.8 Photocatalytic performance mechanism Based on the above degradation reactions and H2 production results, plausible photocatalytic mechanisms for the Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 system has been proposed [56]. Thus, it can be realized that the effective heterojunction formedbetween the Fe2O3 and TiO2phases are responsible for the improved photocatalytic H2 production and degradation of 2, 4-DCP, and 4-B P. The Au was decorated on the Fe2O3/TiO2surface, H2 generation and 2,4 -DCP and 4 -BP removals were extended to a great extent. The improvement of photocatalytic performance might be attributed due to the SPR effectsby Au nanoparticles. In general, Au decorated on the surface of the Fe2O3/TiO2 converts the photon energy from visible light into plasmonic energy, and then injects it to the Fe2O3/TiO2, by this meansenhancing the light-harvesting capability and the photocatalytic performances [57]. It is recognized that the positions in the VB and CB potentials of a Fe2O3/TiO2 play a significant role in photocatalytic performances. The photocatalytic mechanisms of the Fe2O3/TiO2 system is mainly due to the as usual heterojunction formation and the movement of the generated electrons transfers from the CB of TiO2 with highly negative edge potential value to the CB of Fe2O3,which has more positive potential [58]. Therefore, in this ternary photocatalyst, Au nanoparticles with the aid of SPR effect and both Fe2O3 and TiO2 with a narrow bandgap value of the Au- Fe2O3/TiO2system can act as photosensitizer under the visible light. The absorption of a photon by Fe2O3 and TiO2 aids to the easy excitation of electrons from their band levels, and exitthe holes in their VB [59]. The noble metal Au adhered at the heterojunctions surface with low resistance value, which can act as an efficient e−mediator to improve the movement of electron between the Fe2O3 and TiO2 interface. Hence, the ternary Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposites improve the electron-hole separation, which results in better photocatalytic performances of H2 generation and degradation of various phenolic compounds, as shown in Fig. 12 [60–64]."
16,Conclusion,"In summary, the Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalysts were fabricated via a MOF assisted solvothermal reaction. HRTEM images suggested that an intimate interface between Fe2O3 and TiO2and Au nanoparticles formed in the effectiveheterojunctions systems. FESEM and EDS results had collectively validated the enhanced charge transfer within Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite. The photocatalytic performance of ternary composite Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalysts was studied by the removal of 2, 4-DCP, and 4-BP degradation under visiblelight. Especially, the removal 2,4 DCPremoval was up to 95% over the Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite after irradiation for 90 min and 4 BP exhibited 97% removal within 60 min. The high photocatalytic degradation efficiency of Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite was mainly credited to the lavish reactive sites and enhanced the separation efficiencies of photogenerated carriers by Au deposition. It was noted that Au was acted asan efficient redox mediator of the heterostructure between Fe2O3 and TiO2to promote the electron transfer. The highest H2 production of 590 μmol g−1 h−1, witha quantum yield of 12%, was obtained using theglycerol as sacrificial reagent using 4 wt% Au- Fe2O3/TiO2 nanocomposite. Consequently, this study indicated that Au-Fe2O3/TiO2 photocatalyst employing noble metal nanoparticles was a gifted photocatalyst material for waste-water treatment and hydrogen production in the future."
