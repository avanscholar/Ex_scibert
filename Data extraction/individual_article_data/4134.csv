0,Introduction,"Methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) is a typical sulfur-containing and malodorous toxic gas at room temperature, which has the unpleasant smell of rotten cabbage [1–3]. The national emission standard of odor pollutants (GB 14554−93) clearly defines it as one of the eight odor pollutants, which is the main volatile sulfide causing odor in the process of halitosis, sewage, and solid waste treatment. If CH3SH is directly discharged into the air, it will participate in a series of complex reactions, which will lead to climate problems such as photochemical smog and acid rain, causing great harm to environmental safety and human health [4–6]. In addition, if the human body inhales CH3SH directly, it can be absorbed through the respiratory and digestive systems, causing nausea, headache, and other symptoms. More seriously, it may lead to paralysis of human nervous system or even death if the concentration of inhaled CH3SH exceeds the safe limit [7–9]. In daily life, CH3SH is normally found in animal excreta and some specific foods such as bottled red wine, milk, cheese, and ham, etc. [10–12]. It is mainly generated in the process of sulfur amino acid degradation, sulfide methylation, and sulfhydryl transfer under aerobic or anaerobic conditions [13–15]. Therefore, CH3SH can be used as a characteristic substance for evaluating the deterioration of protein attributable to the degradation process of sulfur-containing amino acids. In view of these facts, it is necessary to develop a convenient, low-cost, and reliable analytical method for accurate monitoring of CH3SH, thus safeguarding food safety and human health. To date, the effective assays for CH3SH detection mainly included gas chromatography (GC) [16–18], electrochemistry [19–21], quartz crystal microbalance sensor [22]. However, in practical applications, these methods have some unavoidable disadvantages. For instance, GC suffers from high cost, sophisticated operation, and time-consuming pre-processing. As for electrochemistry and quartz crystal microbalance sensor, their preparation processes are relatively complicated. In contrast, the fluorescence assay possesses the advantages of simple preparation, easy operation, low cost, and excellent sensitivity, which has attracted the attention of many researchers [23,24], but still no applying in CH3SH sensing so far. Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are usually composed of a ligand shell and metal core, which has fluorescent characteristics in the visible to infrared range due to the quantum size effect [25,26]. As previously reported, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is usually employed as a classical stabilizer and reducing agent to synthesize metal nanoclusters, especially for the synthesis of CuNCs [27–29]. However, owing to the small number of free amino groups and high steric hindrance of BSA, it is difficult for Cu2+ to combine with its four free amino groups through coordination bonds, as well as the weak reducibility of BSA, which makes the synthesis process of BSA-CuNCs time-consuming [30]. By contrast, H2O2 can easily and quickly enter the center of the BSA-Cu2+ complex to form a relatively stable BSA-Cu2+-H2O2 complex, because it has a small molecule and strong coordination ability [31]. More importantly, since the BSA acts as a reducing agent to reduce Cu2+ in the system, the formation of the BSA-Cu2+-H2O2 complex makes more Cu2+ combine with BSA, thereby accelerating the reduction of Cu2+. Apart from these, under the catalysis of certain metal ions, such as Cu2+, H2O2 can be transformed into hydroxyl radicals to exhibit stronger oxidizing ability, which will partially destroy the disulfide bonds inside BSA, increasing the exposure of amino acid inside BSA, thus enhancing the reducing ability of BSA to Cu2+ and significantly accelerate the formation of BSA-CuNCs [32]. In short, we found that H2O2 can promote the BSA-Cu2+ system to in situ synthesize BSA-CuNCs, and the intensity of the fluorescent signal from the generated BSA-CuNCs has a linear relationship with the concentration of H2O2. Moreover, alcohol oxidase (AOX) catalyzes the oxidation of CH3SH in the presence of oxygen to formaldehyde and hydrogen sulfide with the concomitant generation of H2O2 via the following reaction [33]: C H 3 SH + O 2 → A O X H C H O + H 2 S+ H 2 O 2 Enlightened by the aforementioned facts, herein, we proposed a cost-effective and sensitive fluorescence sensing strategy-based AOX-triggered in situ synthesis of BSA-CuNCs for applying to determine the fouling levels of CH3SH (Scheme 1 ). In this sensing strategy, we obtained the concentration of CH3SH by detecting the amount of the enzymatically generated H2O2. The as-fabricated platform provided high selectivity for CH3SH with a low detection limit of 0.19 μM. For further applications, the proposed sensing method had been used to monitor the fouling levels of CH3SH in real ham samples with acceptable results, revealing that our proposed method can accurately report CH3SH residue levels in complex food."

3,Apparatus,"2.2 Apparatus Fluorescence data were obtained from an Infinite M200 Pro Microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). UV–vis absorption spectra were collected from a UV-3300 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Mapada, China). pH values were measured by a FE-28 pH meter (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland). Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were obtained from Tecani G2 F30 S-TWIN (FEI, USA) operating at 300 kV.

4,Preparation of BSA-Cu2+ system and CH3SH,"2.3 Preparation of BSA-Cu2+ system and CH3SH Based on other reports and slightly modified [34], in our experiment, the Cu2+ solution was prepared by dissolving ∼ 25.0 mg CuSO4 and ∼ 56.0 mg potassium sodium tartrate in 10 mL deionized water, then adjusted the pH to 12.0 with 1.0 M NaOH solution. ∼ 100.0 mg of BSA was solubilized in 10.0 mL aqueous solution to form a 10.0 mg/mL BSA solution. Cu2+ solution and BSA solution were mixed at a ratio of 1:2 at room temperature for 5.0 min to obtain BSA-Cu2+ system, the color of the solution changed from blue to violet. The obtained BSA-Cu2+ solution was collected for the following experiments. The concentration of the collected BSA-Cu2+ solution was defined by the concentration of Cu2+. CH3SH is a volatile organic compound with a foul odor, which is easily oxidized. Therefore, it needs to be freshly prepared before each use. In the preparation process, we first dissolved a known quantity of CH3SNa using 0.1 M NaOH solution in order to prevent the volatilization and oxidation of CH3SH. According to the following reaction: H3C-S− + H+ →H3C-SH It can determine the content of CH3SH in molecular state. When the pH of the solution is 7.5, the concentration ratio of [CH3SH]/[CH3S−]≈103 (The pK a of CH3SH is 10.4). which makes it possible to ignore the concentration of CH3S− in the ionic state in our experimental tests [35]. Therefore, the concentration of CH3SNa in the solution could be equal to the concentration of CH3SH."
5,The process of H2O2-triggered the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs,2.4 The process of H2O2-triggered the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs A series of solutions that contained 1 mM BSA-Cu2+ system and varying concentrations of H2O2 in PBS buffer at pH 7.0 were incubated for 60.0 min to obtain luminescence BSA-CuNCs. The fluorescence intensity of the obtained BSA-CuNCs is related to the concentration of the added H2O2. The fluorescence emission spectra were measured with an excitation wavelength of ∼ 330 nm.
6,AOX−CH3SH mixture-triggered the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs and fluorescence detection of CH3SH,"2.5 AOX−CH3SH mixture-triggered the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs and fluorescence detection of CH3SH 150.0 μL AOX at a dilution ratio of 4.0 μL/1000 μL (AOX/pH 7.5 PBS buffer) was added into 150.0 μL different concentrations of CH3SH solution and incubated in PBS buffer (pH 7.5; 10 mM) at 37.0 °C for 30.0 min to produce H2O2 in a centrifuge tube. Subsequently, A series of solutions that contained 1 mM BSA-Cu2+ system and the above CH3SH solution with different concentrations in PBS buffer at pH 7.0 were incubated at 37.0 °C for 60.0 min to obtain BSA-CuNCs. The calibration curve for CH3SH detection was established according to the change of fluorescence intensity of the obtained BSA-CuNCs in the presence of different concentrations of CH3SH. Other interfering substances were examined to assess the selectivity of the strategy toward CH3SH, including H2S, Hcy, DTT CH3SCH3, C2H6S2, CS2, GSH, Glucose, L-Cys, L-Lys, L-Phe, critic acid, NO2 −, Na+, Ca2+, VC. The procedures were almost the same as those for the CH3SH response, except for replacing CH3SH with these interfering substances. All measurements were performed three times."
7,Detection of CH3SH in real samples,"2.6 Detection of CH3SH in real samples For the detection of CH3SH in Jinhua ham samples, slightly spoiled Jinhua ham samples were obtained from Zhejiang Huatong Meat Products Co., Ltd. In the pretreated process, ∼10.0 g of ham samples and 20.0 mL of PBS (pH 7.5, 1.0 mM) were homogenized for 5.0 min at 12,000 rpm. The obtained mixture was centrifuged (10,000 rpm) for 15.0 min. The ham centrifuged supernatant was collected and the residue was extracted again [36]. Subsequently, the supernatant was diluted 5 times with PBS (pH 7.5, 1.0 mM). The procedures were almost the same as those for the CH3SH response mentioned above, except for replacing 150.0 μL of CH3SH with 150.0 μL of diluted ham centrifuged supernatant. CH3SH solutions with standard concentrations were added to the ham centrifuged supernatant to assess the recovery. The detected concentrations were calculated in the light of the linear equation obtained from the standard CH3SH response. The recovery was the proportion of the detected concentration (found) to the added concentration (added). All of the fluorescence detections were under the same conditions: the excitation wavelength was set at ∼ 330 nm."

9,Profiling the feasibility of AOX-triggered CH3SH to synthesize BSA-CuNCs in situ,"3.1 Profiling the feasibility of AOX-triggered CH3SH to synthesize BSA-CuNCs in situ It has been reported that CH3SH can be oxidized with the catalysis of AOX to generate H2O2 [33]. To confirm this point, we exploited the O-phenylenediamine-horseradish peroxidase (OPD-HRP) system to characterize the generation of H2O2. In general, HRP can catalyze H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals, and then reacted with OPD to generate the quinone diimide form of OPD, ultimately achieving a yellow color solution of 2, 3-diaminophenazine (DAP) which exhibited a characteristic absorption peak around ∼ 435 nm [37,38]. As illustrated in Fig. S1, the OPD-HRP mixture exhibited an absorption peak at ∼ 403 nm originally, while there was a remarkable red-shift to ∼ 435 nm after incubation with 50.0 μM of H2O2, proving the production of DAP. Likewise, we noticed that there was a similar tendency in the absorption spectra of OPD-HRP system after incubation with the mixture of 4.0 μL/mL AOX + 50.0 μM CH3SH, probably attributes to the generation of hydroxyl radicals originated from AOX-triggered transition of CH3SH to be H2O2. Having proved the fact of AOX-triggered CH3SH into H2O2, we then examined the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs using H2O2-powered the BSA-Cu2+ reaction system. Firstly, we observed that the characteristic absorption peak of the BSA-Cu2+ mixture was primarily located at ∼ 560 nm with violet color, which was not agreed with that of the free Cu2+ at ∼ 804 nm and alone BSA at ∼ 280 nm. Fig. S2 investigates the effect of incubation time on the fluorescence intensity, and the optimal incubation time is 60.0 min, hence 60.0 min was chosen as the optimal incubation time in the subsequent experiments. After incubation with 50.0 μM H2O2 for 60.0 min, we clearly noticed that the characteristic absorption peak of the BSA-Cu2+ mixture located at ∼ 560 nm was disappeared, probably attributes to the generation of new substance such as BSA-CuNCs (Fig. S3). To verify this speculation, we performed the nano-characterization of the reacted product with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1 A). As expected, we observed monodispersed nanoparticles with an average size of 2.01 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. 1B). Through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image analysis, we noticed that these nanoparticles possessed a good resolution with a crystal lattice fringe of 0.201 nm, corresponding to the (111) diffraction plane of metallic Cu (inset of Fig. 1A) [39]. Moreover, XPS analysis revealed that the obtained nanoparticles were mainly composed of Cu, O, N, C, S, and Na (Fig. 1C). Among them, the characteristic peaks at ∼ 932.2 eV and ∼ 952.0 eV in the Cu2p spectrum were primarily ascribed to the characteristic peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 for Cu (0) or Cu (I), respectively. Interestingly, there is not the intrinsic characteristic peak of Cu (II) at ∼ 942.0 eV, demonstrating the disappearance of Cu2+ in the obtained nanoparticles (Fig. 1D) [40–42]. Apart from these, we found that the obtained nanoparticles emitted a strong fluorescence with a maximum emission wavelength at ∼ 400 nm, while the mixture of alone BSA-Cu2+ displayed insignificant fluorescence emission. The excitation wavelength is set at ∼ 330 nm (Fig. 1E). The optimal excitation wavelength was examined as shown in Fig. S4, the maximum emission position of the obtained nanoparticles remains almost unchanged at ∼ 400 nm, with gradually increasing the excitation wavelength from ∼ 320 nm to ∼ 340 nm, and the strongest fluorescence emission occurs when the excitation wavelength was ∼ 330 nm. Therefore, we selected ∼ 330 nm as the optimal excitation wavelength in subsequent experiments. Based on these facts, in combination with previous reports [43,44], we could convince that the observed nanoparticles derived from H2O2-powered the BSA-Cu2+ reaction system assigned to the generation of CuNCs. In order to reveal the surface functional groups of this as-prepared CuNCs, we next explored to the FT-IR spectra of free BSA and this as-prepared CuNCs (Fig. 1F). For BSA’s FT-IR spectrum, the peaks at ∼ 3300 cm−1 and ∼ 1657 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration modes of OH and CO. Meanwhile, the peak at ∼ 1536 cm−1 was mainly ascribed to NH bending. In addition, the peak at ∼ 1390 cm−1 might be the OH bending vibrations in carboxylic acids. Enjoyably, these obvious peaks of BSA also appeared in the FT-IR spectrum of this as-prepared CuNCs, confirming that this as-prepared CuNCs was stabilized with BSA, called BSA-CuNCs-1 [45,46]. According to the primary analysis above, H2O2 played a role of power to trigger BSA-Cu2+ system for preparation of BSA-CuNCs. Herein, circular dichroism (CD) technique was applied to study the configuration changes of BSA and BSA-Cu2+ complexes before and after the addition of H2O2 for better understanding the role of H2O2 in the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs [47]. As seen in Fig. S5, the secondary structure ratio diagram of BSA in the five systems of BSA, BSA-H2O2, BSA-Cu2+, BSA-Cu2+-H2O2, and BSA-Cu2+-AOX + CH3SH. The addition of H2O2 reduces the ratio of α-helix structure in BSA, while the ratio of β-turn and random coils increases, which revealed that the strong oxidant H2O2 destroys part of the peptide chains in BSA, leading to the degree of disorder in the BSA secondary structure increase. The proportion of α-helical structure in the BSA-Cu2+ system was also obviously reduced due to the destruction of the hydrogen bond formed between the hydrogen atom of the amino acid residue imino (-NH) and the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group in the protein caused by Cu2+. Compared to the secondary structure of BSA-Cu2+, the proportion of α-helical structure will be further reduced after adding H2O2 and AOX−CH3SH mixture to the BSA-Cu2+ solution, which proved that H2O2 has a stronger damaging effect on BSA under the catalysis of Cu2+, and the exposure degree of groups was greater, leading to the further decline of ordered structures such as α-helix. The literature validated Cu2+ can catalyze H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals under alkaline conditions, while the destructive effect of hydroxyl radicals is stronger than H2O2 [48]. Based on these, we next examined the effect of H2O2 concentration on the fluorescence emission of BSA-CuNCs for further illustrating its influence on the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs. As depicted in Fig. S6A, with the increase of H2O2, the fluorescence intensity of BSA-Cu2+ reaction at ∼ 400 nm was gradually enhanced, implying a H2O2 concentration-depended fluorescence emission efficiency for the synthesis of BSA-CuNCs. The enhancement of fluorescence intensity of BSA-Cu2+ system was linear with the increase of H2O2 concentration. The linear fitting equation is F - F 0 = 12.924[H2O2] + 0396 (R2 = 0.9935), where F and F 0 denote the fluorescence intensity at ∼ 400 nm obtained in the absence and presence of different concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. S6B). Considering the fact of AOX-triggered transition of CH3SH to be H2O2, it might be feasible to synthesized BSA-CuNCs in situ by exploiting AOX-triggered CH3SH to produce H2O2 for powering BSA-Cu2+ reaction system. Enlighten by the conjecture above, we then replaced H2O2 with the mixture of AOX + CH3SH to add into the BSA-Cu2+ reaction system. After incubation 60.0 min, we observed that there was a remarkable fluorescence enhancement of BSA-Cu2+ reaction system before and after incubation with AOX + CH3SH, with a maximum emission wavelength at ∼ 400 nm, which was similar to that of the H2O2-synthesized BSA-CuNCs, probably implying the in situ synthesis of BSA-CuNCs under AOX-driven CH3SH to activate BSA-Cu2+ reaction system (Fig. 2 A). Given such unique optical feature, we next examined the TEM and HRTEM images of AOX−CH3SH-BSA-Cu2+ reaction system. The results showed that there were nanoparticles produced by the AOX−CH3SH-BSA-Cu2+ reaction system (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, these productive nanoparticles displayed a well monodispersed with an average size of 2.30 ± 0.4 nm, agreeing with free H2O2-synthesized BSA-CuNCs (inset of Fig. 2B). Likewise, we also noticed that the hydrodynamic diameter of AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters (∼ 5.61 nm) were almost consistent with that of free H2O2-synthesized BSA-CuNCs (∼ 4.85 nm) (Fig. 2C). More significantly, the HRTEM image illustrated that AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters exhibited a crystal lattice fringe of 0.208 nm, which were in accordance with that of H2O2-synthesized BSA-CuNCs as well, i.e., belonging to the (111) diffraction plane of metallic Cu (inset of Fig. 2B) [39]. To further confirm our results, we continued to carry out XPS analysis for AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters. The result depicted that the obtained nanoclusters were also mainly composed of Cu, O, N, C, S, and Na (Fig. 2D), and two obvious characteristic peaks at ∼ 932.5 eV and ∼ 952.4 eV in Cu2p spectrum, which corresponded to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 characteristic peaks of Cu (0) or Cu (I), respectively. Besides, there was no satellite peak at ∼ 942.0 eV (Fig. 2E). These results clearly demonstrated that there was no divalent Cu in AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters. FT-IR spectrum analysis of AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters showed a similar result with that of H2O2-synthesized BSA-CuNCs (Fig. 2F). Based on these findings, we could conclude that AOX−CH3SH-driven nanoclusters were BSA-CuNCs as well, revealing a novel strategy by employing AOX-driven CH3SH to generate H2O2 for in situ synthesis of luminescence BSA-CuNCs, called BSA-CuNCs-2."
10,Fluorescence response of AOX-triggered BSA-Cu2+ system toward CH3SH,"3.2 Fluorescence response of AOX-triggered BSA-Cu2+ system toward CH3SH Having demonstrated the successful in situ synthesis of luminescence BSA-CuNCs through AOX−CH3SH-BSA-Cu2+ reaction system, in combination with the feature of H2O2 concentration-dependence fluorescence emission of BSA-CuNCs, we next explored the relationship of CH3SH concentration versus the fluorescence emission of BSA-CuNCs. Before establishing a linear relationship, we first optimized the experimental conditions because of the potential effects of pH, incubation temperature, enzyme concentration, and incubation time on the in situ synthesis of luminescence BSA-CuNCs: (1) Effect of pH: In general, the pH of the solution inevitably affects the response performance of CH3SH. In order to study the influence of pH, we tested the response fluorescence intensity of BSA-CuNCs synthesized from the 50.0 μM CH3SH and 4.0 μL/mL AOX reaction solution in PBS buffer with a pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. The result revealed that the most suitable pH was 7.0, resulting from the occurrence of the maximum response fluorescence intensity at ∼ 400 nm at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, a pH of 7.0 was chosen as the optimized pH for the sensitive monitoring of CH3SH in our proposed fluorescence-sensing platform. (2) Effect of incubation temperature: The incubation temperature is another important factor that affects the response performance of CH3SH. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, when 50 μM CH3SH + 4.0 μL/mL AOX mixture was added to BSA-Cu2+ system, the maximum response fluorescence intensity at ∼ 400 nm was observed when incubation temperature was 37.0 °C. Thus, 37.0 °C was selected as the optimized incubation temperature for the sensitive monitoring of CH3SH in our proposed fluorescence-sensing platform. (3) Effect of enzyme concentration: In order to obtain the optimal addition amount of AOX in the reaction system, different concentrations of AOX were added to 50.0 μM CH3SH to react for 30.0 min, and then the reaction solution was introduced into the BSA-Cu2+ system in PBS buffer at pH 7.0, and the reaction temperature was set to 37.0 °C. Recording the response fluorescence intensity at ∼ 400 nm. Fig. 3C showed the relationship between the response fluorescence intensity and the corresponding concentrations of AOX added. In the range of low enzyme concentration, the response fluorescence intensity increased with the increase of AOX concentration; when the AOX concentration was 4.0 μL/mL, the response fluorescence intensity reached the plateau value. While when the enzyme concentration was further increased, the increase of response fluorescence intensity was not obvious. Therefore, 4.0 μL/mL was chosen as the optimized enzyme concentration for the sensitive monitoring of CH3SH in our proposed fluorescence-sensing platform. (4) Effect of incubation time: Response speed is an important parameter in the analysis method. For this reason, we also studied the fluorescence response time of the BSA-Cu2+ system to CH3SH in the pH 7.0 PBS buffer. It was found that after adding 50.0 μM CH3SH and 4.0 μL/mL AOX reaction solution to the BSA-Cu2+ system, the maximum response fluorescence value was observed after 60.0 min of interaction. Hence, we performed the onsite fluorescence detection of CH3SH by our proposed method after 60.0 min of incubation of AOX−CH3SH mixture with BSA-Cu2+ system. (Fig. 3D). Under the optimal experimental conditions, as seen in Fig. 4 A, when the CH3SH was added to the BSA-Cu2+ system in the presence of AOX, the fluorescence emission of the system at ∼ 400 nm was enhanced markedly. It was found that the fluorescence intensity enhancement F - F 0 was proportional to the CH3SH concentration within a range from 1.0 to 300.0 μM. The regression equation could be expressed as F - F 0 = 3.902 [CH3SH] + 55.748 (R2 = 0.9944) (Fig. 4B), and the calculated detection limit reached as low as 0.19 μM based on 3σ/slope, where σ represents the standard deviation of 11 times the blank measurements [49]. Table S1 summarized the analytical performance of the current CH3SH sensing system with some of the reported methods for CH3SH detection in terms of the linear range and the detection limits. Compared with other reported methods, this proposed method had a comparable detection limit and a wider detection range. As a consequence, this work provided an efficient and novel fluorescent sensing strategy for the detection of CH3SH."
11,Selectivity,"3.3 Selectivity To determine whether this sensing system is specific for CH3SH, the effects of some sulfur compounds, amino acid, and metal ions on the fluorescence response of BSA-Cu2+ system were tested under the optimum conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 4C, the addition of CH3SH could cause remarkable fluorescence enhancement. However, when other interfering substances were added, including GSH, VC, glucose, citric acid, Na+, Ca2+, Br−, NO2 −, Phe, Cys, Lys, Hcy, DTT, CH3SCH3, C2H6S2, CS2, and H2S, there were only negligible fluorescence responses, which further confirmed the high selectivity of the proposed sensing strategy and laid the foundation for the following real sample testing."
12,Detection of CH3SH in real ham samples,"3.4 Detection of CH3SH in real ham samples To validate the potential practical applicability of CH3SH detection strategy in actual samples, the BSA-Cu2+ system was used to detect CH3SH in spoiled Jinhua ham samples. As presented in Table 1 , the calculated results are in good agreement with the addition amount of CH3SH, and the recovery rate is between 98.3 % and 107.0 %, which indicates that the sensor system has good accuracy and feasibility for real sample analysis. Moreover, we found that the relative standard deviations (RSD) within 2.6 %–5.3 % strongly suggested that the excellent repeatability of this proposed method. The above findings manifested that this novel sensing strategy is promising for the accurate and highly selective detection of CH3SH in some real samples."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, we proposed an interesting and efficient fluorescence sensing strategy for detecting CH3SH by exploiting the fact that AOX-assisted O2 catalyzes CH3SH to be H2O2 which could power the BSA-Cu2+ system to in situ synthesizes BSA-CuNCs, emitting fluorescence signals. The proposed method was particularly attractive because of high selectivity and sensitivity. Furthermore, the present sensing system was successfully applied to the determination of CH3SH in real ham samples with acceptable results. This work demonstrated the promising potential of in situ synthesis strategy to develop efficient and reliable detection platform for CH3SH, which might be extended to the accurate detection of other active sulfur small molecule pollutants, safeguarding food safety and human health."
