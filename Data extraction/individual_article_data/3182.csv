0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is being investigated as an alternative energy carrier for the economy because it can be converted to electricity using a fuel cell with high electrical efficiency, does not release CO2 during its utilisation, and can be used for stationary or mobile power generation [1]. Most H2 is currently produced industrially using fossil fuels as the feedstock, but to be sustainable H2 must be produced from renewable materials that require little pre-treatment and are low-cost [2]. One method of renewable H2 production is the fermentation of organic wastes. Anaerobic digestion is the process by which organic matter is converted to hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide by micro-organisms in the absence of oxygen. Normally, all the hydrogen gas is consumed by bacteria that produce methane, although recent research has focused on modifying the anaerobic digestion process such that hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the primary gaseous products [2–4]. During anaerobic digestion, H2 is produced by bacteria that ferment organic compounds to volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, CO2, and H2. Many different substrates can be fermented to produce H2, including food industry and agricultural wastes, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, and wastewater sludges [5–7], although carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, and starch have been most commonly used and are preferred [2,6]. The reactor operating conditions capable of achieving H2 production are well understood, as demonstrated by several recent reviews [2,4,6,8,9]. For example, completely-mixed reactors with a pH of 5.5 and solids retention time of 6–12h can produce a biogas that is primarily H2. In such fermentative hydrogen production systems the H2-consuming methane-forming organisms are inhibited and the biogas is usually 50–70% H2 by volume, with the balance being CO2. Improving the H2 yield from fermentative hydrogen production is an active area of research [3,8,9]. The H2 yield is defined as the moles of H2 produced per mole of substrate. The maximum theoretical H2 yield from fermentative H2 production by Clostridium spp. is 4mol H2/mol glucose converted, which occurs if acetic acid is the only VFA produced and no electrons are used for growth [10]. Current H2 yields reported in the literature are usually in the range 1–2mol H2/mol glucose converted [1,10,11], much less than the theoretical maximum of 4mol H2/mol glucose converted. In continuous-flow mixed-culture systems the use of N2 sparging has been well established as a means of increasing the H2 yield. In the 6 studies published to date using N2 sparging, the H2 yield was increased by 18–68% using sparging rates of 20–80mL/min/L-liquid [12–17]. Most studies that used N2 sparging only tested one sparging rate [12,14,16]. To date, only Kim et al. [15] tested multiple sparging rates. The authors evaluated sparging rates of 20, 40, 60 and 80mL/min/L-liquid which resulted in H2 yields of 0.91, 0.92, 0.95 and 0.92mol H2/mol hexose converted, respectively, versus a H2 yield without sparging of 0.77mol H2/mol hexose converted. Sparging increases mass transfer from the liquid to gas phases and can be described by the overall volumetric mass-transfer coefficient KLa [18]. KLa values are specific to a given bioreactor because KLa is influenced by the reactor geometry (diameter, height), sparger characteristics (type, pore/orifice size, quantity), and liquid-phase hydrodynamics and rheology. KLa is usually correlated to the superficial gas velocity Ug (=sparging flow rate/reactor cross-section area) or to relevant dimensionless groups. Because KLa lumps all of the influencing factors together into one value, it can be used to compare different reactor systems and for reactor design and scale-up. However, existing studies of sparging in fermentative hydrogen production systems report the volumetric sparging rate (mL/min) but not the mass transfer coefficient. Although N2 sparging increases the H2 yield from fermentative hydrogen production systems, sparging requires energy and also dilutes the product gas. Additionally, existing sparging results cannot be readily scaled-up to pilot- and full-scale because the mass-transfer characteristics were not examined. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to: (1) systematically evaluate N2 sparging rates to determine an optimum with respect to maximizing the H2 yield, and (2) determine the relationship between sparging and mass-transfer rates so as to facilitate scale-up of sparging systems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bioreactor system,"2.1 Bioreactor system The reactor system and related equipment are shown in Fig. 1 . The bioreactor had a 2L liquid volume, 0.8L headspace volume, and 15.2cm diameter. The reactor was completely-mixed, pH controlled at 5.5 (Liquitron DP5000, LMI Milton Roy, Acton, MA) with 4M NaOH, and had a temperature of 24±1°C. Gases were sparged into the reactor using a 2.5cm long fritted cylinder gas dispersion stone with 40–60μm pore size (#39533-12C, Corning Inc., Big Flats, NY). Liquids were transferred using digital-control peristaltic pumps (Masterflex digital brushless drive, Cole–Parmer, Mississauga, ON). The off-gas from the reactor passed through a foam trap, dessicator (Indicating Drierite, W. A. Hammond, Xenia, OH), and then a FLOCELL® bubble meter (Challenge Technology, Springdale, AR) for flowrates <12mL/min/L-liquid or a differential pressure flowmeter (#32446-27, Cole–Parmer, Montreal, QC) calibrated to the FLOCELL® for flowrates >12mL/min/L. The sparging rate was measured using a separate differential pressure flowmeter in series with the N2 gas line and the sparger. During the KLa measurement tests tipping gas meters were used. These meters employed a two-sided gas collector that alternately filled with gas. Once one collector was filled, the mechanism tipped over thereby activating a counter via a solenoid switch and allowing the other collector to fill with gas."
3,Basal medium,"2.2 Basal medium Glucose was used as the substrate for fermentative H2 production. Separate glucose and nutrient solutions were mixed 1:1 at the point of entry to the reactor. The glucose solution was made up at a concentration of 20g/L in distilled water and acidified to pH 2.4 using concentrated HCl. The nutrient solution contained (g per 20L tap water): NH4Cl 20, KH2PO4 80, FeCl2·4H2O 4, MgSO4·7H2O 4, and 25mL of trace metal solution. The trace metal solution contained (g/L): MgCl2·6H2O 40, CaCl2·2H2O 40, NiCl2·6H2O 16, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O 11, ZnCl2 8, CuCl2·2H2O 8, CoCl2·6H2O 4, MnCl2·4H2O 4, KI 4, H3BO3 0.8, Na2WO4·2H2O 0.4, AlCl3·6H2O 0.2, Na2SeO3 0.2, NH4VO3 0.16 (dry chemicals were from Caledon Laboratories, Georgetown, ON). The two solutions were mixed using a magnetic stir plate and maintained at 4°C in a refrigerator."
4,Reactor start-up,"2.3 Reactor start-up For start-up, 1L of screened (0.5mm) anaerobic digester sludge (North Toronto Treatment Plant, Toronto, Ontario) and 1L of basal medium were added to a nitrogen-purged reactor, adjusted to pH 5.5, and allowed to acclimate for 24h before initiating continuous operation at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8h. After 24–48h of continuous operation, residual inoculum solids attached to the reactor's walls were removed by rinsing with tap water during which time the sludge was stored under N2 in a glass bottle. Any deficit in the liquid level was replaced by feed solution."
5,N2 sparging optimisation,"2.4 N2 sparging optimisation Two reactors were run in parallel with 7 HRTs before data were collected daily for 5 days. For each run, the sludges were mixed together under N2 and the reactors rinsed with tap water. Replicate measurements from the two reactors were pooled. The testing sequence was (mL/min/L-liquid): 0, 4 (2 weeks), 0 (no analytical work performed), 0, 127 (reactor upset – data not reported), 24, 0, 51, 86, 12 and 0. The sparging rates were measured and adjusted daily and the mean relative standard deviation was 8%."
6,KLa measurement,"2.5 KLa measurement For sparingly-soluble gases such as H2 and CO2, the major resistance to mass transfer is within the liquid and the liquid-phase mass-transfer resistance controls the overall mass-transfer rate [18,19]. Under such conditions, the overall volumetric mass-transfer coefficient, KLa (h−1), is adequate for describing the mass transfer. The dynamic gassing-out method [20] was employed for determining the volumetric mass-transfer coefficients (KLa), and followed Shizas and Bagley [21] where KLa is determined from experimental data as the slope of a plot of −ln(CL ) versus t. Tests were performed over a period of several weeks, and on days when tests were not being performed the reactor was operated as normal to ensure the sludge characteristics were maintained throughout the test period. On the day before the tests all liquid flows were stopped and the reactor was purged with nitrogen (99.999% purity, Praxair) for 14–16h to remove dissolved H2 and CO2. The reactor was then sparged with H2 (99.999% purity, Praxair, Toronto, Canada) or CO2 (99.99% purity, Praxair) for 10–15min to bring the dissolved H2 or CO2 concentration to near-saturation. N2 sparging at a measured volumetric flow rate was initiated and five dissolved gas samples were taken at intervals of 1–5min. For both H2 and CO2, three KLa tests were conducted in basal medium and 16 in sludge using sparging rates of 2–165mL/min/L-liquid. The testing sequence was chosen as the tests were proceeding on an ad hoc basis and not in order of increasing flow. Because the tests in sludge contained viable bacteria, the measured KLa could appear to be higher or lower than the true value if H2 and CO2 were consumed or produced, respectively. There were no significant changes in dissolved H2 concentrations over a 30min un-sparged period, which was the duration of most KLa tests, so the use of viable organisms did not appear to influence the KLa measurement in the system examined. For the CO2 (aq) KLa tests, the pH controller's dosing response was too slow at the high sparging rates to maintain a constant pH. Therefore, to ensure equivalent conditions, the pH was not controlled during the CO2 tests. The initial pH for all KLa tests was 5.5 and the maximum pH deviation during the CO2 tests was 0.5 pH units."
7,Analytical measurements,"2.6 Analytical measurements Reactor headspace gases (H2, CO2, CH4) were measured according to Kraemer and Bagley [22]. Dissolved H2 and CO2 (aq) were measured according to Kraemer and Bagley [16]. Glucose was analysed enzymatically using 25μL of sludge supernatant (20,000×g, 4°C, 20min) and 4.0mL of glucose hexokinase reagent (Infinity, Thermo Electron Corp.) dispensed at 4°C. The liquid was vortexed for 1s, incubated at 37°C for 3min, and the absorbance measured at 340nm. D- and L-lactic acids were measured using an enzymatic kit (Megazyme, Ireland). Acetone, alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol), and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, i-butyric, n-butyric, i-valeric, n-valeric) were measured by static headspace-gas chromatography using the method of Cruwys et al. [23]. Modifications were made to accommodate analysis of acetone and alcohols, including the use of 2-methyl-1-butanol as alcohol internal standard (100μL at 2000mg/L) and using a temperature program of 45°C for 1.8min, 45°C/min to 140°C, and 10°C/min to 166°C. Other differences were: needle temperature 95°C, Zebron FFAP column (Phenomenex), one distilled water wash blank between samples, and use of ordinary least-squares regression."
8,Calculation of derived parameters,"2.7 Calculation of derived parameters The degree to which KLa is influenced by the chemical properties of the liquid in reference to a standard condition can be described by α [24]: (1) α = K L a liquid K L a standard In this work, basal medium was used as the standard condition. In this work two dimensionless numbers were used: the Sherwood number (Sh), which is a ratio of convective mass transport to diffusive mass transport, and the Froude number (Fr), which is a ratio of inertial force to gravitational force. Sh and Fr were calculated according to Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. (2) Sh = K L a ⋅ A r D (3) Fr = U g 2 g ⋅ d U g is the superficial gas velocity (=sparging flow rate/A r), A r is the reactor cross-section area (πd 2/4), d is the reactor diameter, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and D is the gas diffusivity. Values for D were 5.11×10−5 cm2/s for H2 and 1.91×10−5 cm2/s for CO2 (at 25°C [25])."
9,Results,
10,Optimal N2 sparging rate,"3.1 Optimal N2 sparging rate The use of N2 sparging during fermentative hydrogen production had a positive effect on the H2 yield and the H2 production rate (Fig. 2 ). Without sparging, the H2 yield was approximately 1mol H2/mol glucose converted. With higher sparging rates, the H2 yield increased to a maximum of 2mol H2/mol glucose converted. This result confirms the literature reports that N2 sparging increases the yield of fermentative hydrogen production [4]. The H2 production rate increased from 0.64g H2/d without sparging to approximately 1.33g H2/d at sparging rates of 12mL/min/L or more. Because there was no significant difference between the H2 yields or H2 production rates for sparging rates between 12 and 86mL/min/L-liquid, the optimum sparging rate for fermentative hydrogen production was 12mL/min/L-liquid. This sparging rate is lower than the N2 sparging rates that have been tested to date in the literature, usually >20mL/min/L-liquid [4]. Kim et al. [15] did not observe a significant change in the H2 yield when sparging a fermentative hydrogen production system with N2 at 20–80mL/min/L-liquid. This result is consistent with the H2 yield results observed here, namely that the range of sparging rates assessed by Kim et al. [15] were above the optimal sparging rate and therefore there was no increase in the H2 yield at higher sparging rates. Therefore, the optimal sparging rate for Kim et al. [15] was somewhere between zero and 20mL/min/L because the un-sparged H2 yield was significantly lower than the H2 yield at their lowest sparging rate of 20mL/min/L. The optimum observed in the present work of 12mL/min/L is consistent with this range, although presumably differences in reactor geometry, equipment, and sludge properties would lead to differences in the actual value of the optimal sparging rate. Fig. 3 illustrates the decrease in H2 and CO2 content of the reactor off-gas as the N2 sparging rate increased. Sparging diluted the product gas H2 concentration from 60% H2 without sparging to 10% H2 when sparging at 86mL/min/L. Methane was not observed at concentrations higher than 0.01%. The maximum H2 yield was achieved at a sparging rate of 12mL/min/L, so sparging at rates higher than this only act to further dilute the product gas for no additional benefit. Dilution is detrimental from a practical perspective because it decreases the energy value of the product gas. Sparging decreased the dissolved H2 and CO2 concentrations, as shown in Fig. 4 . As the sparging rate increased from 0 to 86mL/min/L, the dissolved H2 concentration decreased from 1400 to 600μM and the dissolved CO2 (aq) concentration decreased from 16,000 to 2000μM. Notably, the dissolved gas concentrations continued to decrease at sparging rates beyond the 12mL/min/L rate which optimised the H2 yield. Sparging had the beneficial effect of promoting practically complete substrate conversion at sparging rates of 12mL/min/L and above (Fig. 5 ). Without sparging, the glucose conversion efficiency was only 89% (residual glucose concentration 1200±200mg/L). The higher H2 production rate shown in Fig. 2 was not solely due to higher glucose conversion efficiency, however, because the amount of H2 produced per glucose converted (i.e. H2 yield) was also higher. The primary fermentation products were acetate and n-butyrate, as shown in Table 1 . Both acetate and n-butyrate concentrations were higher at sparging rates of 12mL/min/L and above than at the two lowest sparging rates. For acetate, this increase was attributed to the increased glucose utilisation caused by sparging because there was no significant difference in the acetate yield (acetate per glucose converted) between no sparging and sparging at 12mL/min/L and above (yield values not shown). On the other hand, the n-butyrate yield (n-butyrate per glucose converted) was significantly higher for sparging rates of 12mL/min/L and higher compared with the two lowest rates. This result indicates that sparging affected the fermentation pathways of the H2 producing bacteria to produce more n-butyrate."
11,Measurement of KLa for N2 sparging,"3.2 Measurement of KLa for N2 sparging The determination of the optimum N2 sparging rate is important for practical application of fermentative hydrogen production technology. However, knowledge of the optimum volumetric sparging rate (i.e. mL/min/L) is not helpful for scale-up and reactor design purposes. Appropriate design requires knowledge of the actual mass-transfer rate that optimised the H2 yield, and then to design the full-scale system to achieve this same mass-transfer rate, among other considerations such as mixing. Additionally, knowledge of the mass-transfer rate is needed to make meaningful comparisons to other work because differences in reactor geometry, equipment, and sludge properties will lead to different mass-transfer rates even if the volumetric sparging rates are the same. The dynamic gassing-out method [20] fit the data well, providing sound estimates of KLa. Over 86% of the H2 and CO2 KLa regressions had r 2 >0.9. Fig. 6 summarises all the KLa values measured by the dynamic gassing-out method for H2 and CO2, and the corresponding correlations are summarized in Table 2 . As expected, higher volumetric sparging rates produced higher mass-transfer rates. However, the KLa became less responsive to the sparging rate as the sparging rate increased. The implication of this fact is that as the sparging rate increased, more sparging was needed to achieve a unit increase in KLa. This effect may be due to coalescence of bubbles at higher sparging flows. Therefore, the lowest feasible sparging rate should be used, which further supports the use of the optimal sparging rate of 12mL/min/L discussed above. Shizas and Bagley [21] is the only report identified in the literature where KLa values were measured in a fermentative H2 production bioreactor. The authors measured KLa values by the dynamic gassing-out method for H2 in broth at pH 6 and 35°C using the same reactor as for the current work. Their KLa values of 11.4 and 17.4h−1 at 50 and 100mL/min/L-liquid were similar to those for the current work of 13.7 and 22.5h−1, respectively, even given the different pH and temperature. For both H2 and CO2, the KLa in sludge was higher than in basal medium (Table 3 ) indicating α >1. Shizas and Bagley [21] also observed α >1 in hydrogen-producing sludge. The reason for α >1 in hydrogen-producing sludge may be that the high concentrations of soluble constituents, typically microbial products, can act as surfactants. For example, α can be larger than unity when inorganic salts or aliphatic alcohols are present [26] and foaming caused by proteins can increase mass transfer [27]. During normal operation of the bioreactor used in this study, there was always foam on top of the liquid which indicated some of the microbial products acted as surfactants."
12,Discussion,
13,Limitations in comparing fermentative H2 production literature results,"4.1 Limitations in comparing fermentative H2 production literature results Nitrogen sparging during fermentative H2 production has been shown repeatedly to increase the H2 yield [4]. This work reaffirmed these literature observations, and therefore N2 sparging should be considered for use in full-scale H2 production systems. From a practical perspective, sparging is energy intensive and dilutes the product H2 gas and therefore minimising the sparging rate will improve the overall energy balance of a fermentative H2 production system. However, comparing the existing literature to determine an optimum sparging rate does not yield any useful information. As shown in Fig. 7 , the H2 yields reported in the literature are not effectively correlated to the volumetric sparging rate (mL/min/L-liquid). Although not shown here, there is also no relationship whether the amount of sparging is expressed as absolute gas flow rate (mL/min) or as superficial gas velocity (cm/s) or whether the yield is expressed as relative increase in H2 yield (%) instead of the absolute yield (mol H2/mol glucose). This is not particularly surprising, however, because the different reactor geometries and equipment (and presumably sludge properties as well) used in different studies will produce different mass-transfer rates for the same volumetric N2 sparging rate. As seen in Fig. 2, an optimum sparging rate was found to occur at a lower N2 sparging rate (12mL/min/L) than has been examined in the past (usually >20mL/min/L). This optimum appears to be related to biological processes that are affected by sparging and not gas-transfer limitations: beyond 12mL/min/L, the dissolved H2 and CO2 concentrations continued to decrease (Fig. 4), KLa continued to increase (Fig. 6), and VFA concentrations did not increase further (Table 1). In order to place this optimum sparging rate on a fundamental basis, the correlation between volumetric sparging rate and volumetric mass-transfer coefficient (KLa) was determined. The optimum sparging rate of 12mL/min/L corresponded to KLa values of 5.0h−1 for H2 and 1.6h−1 for CO2. The KLa can be used as an equivalent basis for comparing sparging among different studies. This is important because, to date, only the volumetric sparging flowrates (mL/min) have been reported in the literature studies that examined sparging during fermentative H2 production."
14,Scale-up of N2 sparging during fermentative H2 production,"4.2 Scale-up of N2 sparging during fermentative H2 production Fermentative hydrogen production research has been conducted extensively at laboratory-scale in bioreactors of 1–10L, and pilot-scale systems of 200–1500L are now being evaluated [28,29]. To the authors' knowledge, full-scale fermentative hydrogen production systems have yet to be reported in the published literature. The pilot-scale systems reported to date have still been exclusively for research and not as a test of existing knowledge to move towards a full-scale system. N2 sparging in fermentative H2 production bioreactors, as a mass-transfer operation, is subject to the same considerations for scale-up as any other mass-transfer operation in biochemical engineering. For example, the factors that affect KLa in an agitated reactor do not scale-up in the same way with reactor size and mixing rate [19]. Thus, one parameter must be chosen as the basis for scale-up, which has the consequence that other parameters will be different at full-scale than at laboratory scale because each has a different scaling function [19]. The scale-up parameter chosen should be the one that is most influential for the optimal performance of the system [19]. An appropriate scale-up parameter would be the amount of N2 sparging as quantified by the mass-transfer coefficient KLa, or more generally the Sherwood number (see Eq. (2)). The use of dimensionless groups is intended to eliminate the effects of scale and ensure dimensional similarity between lab-scale and full-scale systems [30]. On the other hand, an inappropriate N2 sparging scale-up parameter would be the volumetric sparging rate (mL/min or mL/min/L-liquid). Scaling-up on this basis is not equivalent from a mass-transfer perspective because of differences in reactor geometry, equipment, and liquid composition. The measured KLa values and corresponding N2 sparging rates were converted to Sherwood (Sh) and Froude (Fr) numbers, respectively, and are shown in Fig. 8 . The correlation between Sh and Fr is given in Table 2. Converting the KLa values to dimensionless Sherwood numbers provided a single-line relationship instead of the two lines (one for H2 and one for CO2) seen in Fig. 6. The collapse of the two KLa data sets to a single line illustrates the fact that the mass-transfer coefficient for each gas is proportional to its diffusivity [31]. For scale-up of the optimal sparging rate the Sherwood number would be held constant between these laboratory-scale results and the full-scale system. From the current work, the optimum sparging rate occurred at a N2 sparging rate of 12mL/min/L-liquid, which corresponded to a Froude number of 3.26×10−10 and in turn corresponded to a Sherwood number of 4800. Thus, Sh =4800 should provide the optimal amount of sparging. As an example, for a reactor with a 0.785m2 cross-sectional area (1-m diameter), the recommended sparging flow rate would be approximately 4m3/d versus 0.035m3/d for the 0.152-m diameter laboratory-scale reactor examined in the current work. For a reactor with a 7.07m2 cross-sectional area (3-m diameter), the recommended sparging flow rate would be approximately 62m3/d. At laboratory-scale, paddle mixers or stir bars have been used for reactor mixing, whereas reactor mixing at full-scale is frequently achieved by gas sparging. In this case, the gas sparging rate required to achieve a desired level of mixing in a full-scale fermentative H2 production bioreactor needs to be properly assessed to ensure the reactor is not mixing-limited. For example, the suggested design sparging rate for mixing of anaerobic sludge digesters using confined gas mixers is approximately 0.006m3 biogas/min/m3-volume [32]. This should be compared to the sparging rate required to optimise H2 yield (Sh =4800) and the larger sparging rate should be used for design."
15,Conclusions,"An optimum N2 sparging rate was observed, above which the H2 yield did not increase further. In the system examined, the optimum N2 sparging rate of 12mL/min/L-liquid, corresponding to a volumetric mass-transfer coefficient (KLa) for H2 of 5h−1, maximised the H2 yield at approximately 2mol H2/mol glucose converted, versus 1mol H2/mol glucose converted without sparging. This optimum sparging rate is lower than N2 sparging rates reported to date in the literature and provides the benefits of minimising hydrogen gas dilution and energy use versus higher sparging rates. By determining the KLa values, mass-transfer and sparging rates could be related by using dimensionless Sherwood and Froude numbers. Scale-up of sparging can be conducted by specifying the Sherwood number at 4800 and determining the full-scale KLa. The full-scale sparging rate (superficial gas velocity) can then be determined from the Froude number corresponding to the optimum Sherwood number."
