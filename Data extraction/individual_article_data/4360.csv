0,Introduction,"Hydrogen and its potential use in a fuel cell could be an efficient and a clean energy carrier. Among the different fuel cells, the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) would appear to be a promising energy converter for various power applications from small mobile applications (3–5W) to transport application (80kW). Coupling the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the PEMFC produces electricity, heat and water as by-products. However, current hydrogen production methods are mainly related to fossil fuels. As an example, steam methane reforming (SMR) is one of the most developed (≈49%) and low-cost methods for producing hydrogen [1]. To limit fossil fuel use, renewable resources are being extensively investigated. Solar energy is a renewable and abundant resource that could be used in many ways to produce hydrogen through electrolysis, thermolysis, thermochemical cycles, photoelectrolysis and biophotolysis [2]. Photovoltaic cells coupled with water electrolysis are one of the most developed methods to convert solar energy into electricity. The efficiency of current photovoltaic cells to convert solar irradiance into electricity is about 10–20% [3]. Water electrolysis demonstrates a really efficient way to convert electricity into hydrogen (50–80%). The best efficiency for this method of directly converting solar energy into hydrogen is 16% [4,5]. Considering that current proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have a yield of 47 % on the conversion of hydrogen into electricity, the global yield of this system to convert solar energy into electricity is about 8%. Alternative methods, to produce hydrogen, such as photobiological process which uses the photosynthesis of micro-organisms [2,6,7] or photocatalysis [8–12] are carried out mainly at laboratory-scale or pilot-scale. The possibility of producing hydrogen from organic wastewater by photocatalysis, as for other methods [13], with solar energy is a very attractive way. Presently, alcohol is often used as model feedstock with or without water to produce hydrogen via a reforming reaction [9,10] or dehydrogenation reaction [9,11,12]. Methanol is often found to be the best reactant for producing hydrogen via photocatalysis [12,14]. A bifunctionnal reaction mechanism for photocatalytic alcohol dehydrogenation was proposed [12,15]. This mechanism combines a photocatalyst (TiO2), which absorbs photons with energy higher than its band gap and absorbs alcohols at its surface, and a metallic cocatalyst (platinum as example), deposited onto the surface of the catalyst. This improves the electron/hole pair separation and is able to reduce protons into hydrogen. The P25 from Evonik is known to be one of the most efficient TiO2 for most photocatalytic reactions, while platinum remains the best cocatalyst with a minimal loading for hydrogen production [9,16,17]. The alternative of directly feeding a PEMFC with hydrogen produced in a new experimental method was performed for photobiological synthesis [18] and for photocatalysis [19,20]. Furthermore Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) can utilize methanol and directly produce electricity but they suffer because of methanol crossover toward the cathode which drastically reduces their efficiency to about 20% [21]. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a hydrogen supply chain which includes hydrogen production (by photocatalysis), hydrogen storage and hydrogen use in a fuel cell. The possibility to directly use solar irradiance to produce electricity with a system combining hydrogen production by photocatalysis (methanol dehydrogenation) and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell would appear to be interesting. Fuel cell performance was followed under different operating conditions by applying a constant voltage."
1,Experiment,"Titanium dioxide P25 (Aeroxide, P25) from Evonik was used as the photocatalyst and hexachloroplatinate acid (Sigma-Aldrich, H2PtCl6, 6H2O) as the platinum salt. Methanol (Fisher Chemical, 99.99%) was used as model feedstock for photocatalytic alcohol dehydrogenation reaction. The experimental setup for direct solar conversion into electricity, including photoreactors and an air-breathing fuel cell, is shown in Fig. 1 . The photocatalytic system consists of 4 photoreactors and an aluminium reflector. Each photoreactor consists of a 26cm long Pyrex cylinder with a base diameter of 3.5cm corresponding to a direct optical area of 91cm2 as described above [19]. The aluminium reflector was used to optimize irradiation of the slurry with solar light. The photocatalytic system and more specifically the aluminium reflector was continuously oriented to track and face the sun. Photoreactors were linked in parallel for liquid circulation, with a recirculating pump, and they shared their gas phase. The total methanol volume was 1.2L. TiO2 nanoparticles (1.0gL−1 concentration) were maintained in suspension in methanol through liquid circulation. The Pt/TiO2 catalyst was prepared via direct photo-deposition of hexachloroplatinate acid under solar irradiation during the experiment, with 1.0wt.% platinum loading. Indeed absorption of photons on TiO2 generates an electron/hole pair. The hexachloroplatinic ions on the surface of the catalyst (TiO2) are reduced by the photogenerated electrons and at the same time methanol is oxidized by the photogenerated holes, as: PtCl6 2− +2CH3OH=Pt°+2 CH2O+4H+ +6Cl− The pump allowed the stirring and homogenization of the catalyst/reagent mixture by the recirculation circuit. Photoreactors were purged with helium at 20mLmin−1 for thirty minutes before each experiment to remove air/O2 from the photoreactor and the hydrogen stream. The hydrogen produced by photocatalysis is stored in a 200mL tank. A valve and a manometer are used to limit, if necessary, the pressure of hydrogen to 0.2bar. This system played the role of a hydrogen storage media. The PEMFC was an air-breathing fuel cell from PaxiTech. The membrane electrode assembly had an active area of 25cm2 and contained a 50μm thick Nafion membrane with a Pt/C catalyst on the cathode side and Pt-Ru/C catalyst on the anode side. Cathode platinum loading was 0.5mgcm−2. Catalysts loading at the anode compartment were 0.25mgcm−2 platinum with 0.25mgcm−2 ruthenium. The cell worked with air on the cathode side and hydrogen produced on the anode side. After purging the system with helium, the helium flow was stopped. The end valve remained open during the experiment meaning that the hydrogen partial pressure should be about 1.0bar. During the first 50min of each experiment the electric current was maintained at 0.0A to check the open circuit voltage (O.C.V.) of the fuel cell, and then, the fuel cell worked at a constant voltage of 0.5V. Before the experiment the fuel cell was conditioned and hydrated by working at an electric current of 2.0A for 30min under pure hydrogen (1.5bar) produced by a small water electrolyzer (PaxiTech). The performance of DMFC was measured using pure methanol and a DMFC with the same characteristic as the PEMFC as described above and provided by PaxiTech. The performance of the fuel cells (PEMFC and DMFC) was measured by recording the voltage/current and by plotting classical polarization curve (voltage versus current density). Currents and cell voltages were measured with a fuel cell electronic load (PaxiTech) connected to a computer via a picolog data logger (PicoLog1012). The solar irradiance was measured using a radiometer (VLX-3W) equipped with a photoelectrical cell centered at 365nm wavelength (CX-365, 355–375nm)."
2,Results and discussion,"Experiments were performed directly under solar light. Fig. 2 reports the result obtained. The experiment began at 11:00 a.m. and was stopped at around 3:00 p.m, corresponding to the peak sunlight hours. Fig. 2 shows that the cell voltage increases during the first 40min of the experiment while the electric current is maintained at 0.0A. It finally reaches a steady state at 0.74V corresponding to the fuel cell O.C.V. When the O.C.V. is tried, the fuel cell was used at aconstant voltage of 0.5V. The resulting electric current varies a lot due to air flow which modifies the oxygen transported to the cathodic compartment (natural and wind-forced convection) and as a result of the hydrogen partial pressure on the anodic compartment which is not perfectly regular because of the slow hydrogen production rate. However, the average electric current increases before reaching a steady state at 0.7A. The solar irradiance was constant during the experiment (≈2.1mWcm−2 at 365nm wavelength). As discussed above [19], the increase of the cell voltage and electric current could be correlated: - to the platinum photo-deposition stage (at the beginning of the irradiation); - and to the increase of the hydrogen content in the gas phase (to replace the helium used for the purge) due to photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation reaction as: CH3OH+(hν, cat)=HCHO+H2 The electric power obtained was about 0.35W at this nominal operating point of the fuel cell. After 240min, the aluminium reflector was removed. The electric current and cell voltage dropped drastically because no hydrogen was produced under these conditions, demonstrating that the sunlight provided by the aluminium reflector is the main source of photons for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The direct optical surface area of photoreactors exposed to the aluminium reflector is 364cm2 (4 photoreactors). In this experiment the electric power density (due to the photoreactor optical area) was about 1mWcm−2. This electric power density is ten to twenty times lower than could be obtained with a classical photovoltaic cell (around 10–20mWcm−2). A similar experiment was performed but only two photoreactors were hidden from the light after 220min of functioning. The average electric power using two photoreactors about 0.15W was approximately half the average electric power obtained with four photoreactors (0.35W). Thus, the average electric power is directly proportional to the optical surface area of photoreactor exposed to the sunlight. Considering our operating conditions, it was estimated that an optical surface area of 789cm2 should be tried to obtain optimal performance of the fuel cell at 0.5V functioning (0.65W) using this kind of system. Fig. 3 reports working points of the fuel cell at 0.5V maintained during both experiments under solar irradiation and a classical polarization curve obtained with the fuel cell using pure hydrogen and with the DMFC using pure methanol. The optimal electric current for the fuel cell at 0.5V was about 1.5A under pure hydrogen at 1.0bar, corresponding to an electric power of 0.75W. The hydrogen production rate obtained by photocatalysis was not enough to maintain the optimal performance at 0.5V cell voltage. The electric current at these operating points, under photocatalytic hydrogen, is dependent on the hydrogen production rate. Moreover, as show in Fig. 3, combining photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation and PEMFC leads to better performance than DMFC in our operating conditions. The photocatalytic system used in this experiment could be optimized by reducing the volume, increasing the optical surface area or improving the stirring of the catalyst/reagent mixture. However, the sunlight photon absorption by the photocatalyst remains one of the principle limiting parameters for system performance. Indeed, one of the best quantum yields for photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation was reported at 45% in the UV range according to P. Pichat et al. [12]. While the absorption of photons from sunlight is below 8% because of the high band gap of the TiO2 (3.0–3.2eV) which may only absorb wavelength light under 400nm in the UV light range [22]. Thus, photocatalysis may only use less than 4% of sunlight photons to produce hydrogen. Photocatalyst needs further improvement to efficiently absorb solar irradiance to compete with the photovoltaic cell/electrolyzer couple. Mixing some semiconductor could be a solution as provided by some authors [22–27]."
3,Conclusions,"In this study, solar irradiance was directly converted into electricity by using photocatalysis and an air-breathing proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Sunlight was succesfully used to reduce the platinum at the surface of the titanium dioxyde and to produce hydrogen by photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation. The hydrogen produced directly fed a PEMFC without prior purification. The system provides electric power density of 1mWcm−2 of photoreactor optical surface area exposed to the sunlight. This work demonstrates that it is posible to use solar photocatalysis to produce hydrogen and to convert it with a fuel cell with higher efficiency than DMFC. In order to develop this process, two paths are envisaged: first design optimization of the solar-photorecator cell (optimization of the ratio surface/volume for irradiation, optimization of the semiconductor form (fixed or mobile)…) and secondly to optimize hydrogen production at the semiconductor scale by for instance mixing some semiconductors."
