0,Introduction,"As a well-known fact, the average global temperature is experiencing a continuous augmentation due to the increasing emissions of greenhouse gases (Ud Din et al., 2015; Din et al., 2018). Carbon dioxide is one of the important constituents of the greenhouse gases (Din et al., 2016). Due to the extensive industrializations, the concentration of carbon dioxide gas has been amplified in the atmosphere over the past few decades (Din et al., 2017). Consequently, the global atmosphere has been suffered with catastrophic phenomenon like global warming. Many attempts have been practiced to mitigate the emitted carbon dioxide concentrations (Din et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2019; Ud Din et al., 2014). However, the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to some valuable products like methanol has been found very economical (Din et al., 2019). Conventionally methanol is produced from coal or natural gas. In this process CO2 is released to the environment. As a well-known fact, CO2 is a greenhouse gas. The catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is green process as it utilizes the emitted CO2 to produce valuable methanol. Methanol synthesis by carbon dioxide hydrogenation has been generally carried out over alumina based Cu/Zn catalysts. Similarly, other bimetallic catalysts such as Cu/ZrO2, Ag/Zn, Ni/Zn, Cu/Ni have also been employed for methanol synthesis by carbon dioxide hydrogenation (Din et al., 2019). However, due to debatable reaction mechanism, no single catalyst has been industrially optimized for the reaction. Although both Ag and Cu exhibit similar physical and chemical properties for sharing the same group in periodic table, however catalytic behavior are varied quite significantly (Conesa et al., 2019). Copper based catalysts are generally used in hydrogenation reaction while silver is considered more in oxidation reactions (Ud Din et al., 2014; Din et al., 2014b; Torbina et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). However, the promoting role of silver in some hydrogenation reactions has also documented in literature (González et al., 2007; Andoni and Van Santen, 2013; Wang and Yang, 2017). This provides the hypothetical base to the application of Ag in hydrogenation reactions like CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Keeping in mind the promoting effect of Ag in the hydrogenation reactions, zeolite based catalysts with different Ag–Cu ratio have been investigated in the current work. Zeolite has been used as catalysts support. It provides the higher surface area for the incorporation of active metals. It also provides thermal stability to the active metals which is very crucial for the better performance of catalysts. Zeolite also avoids the sintering phenomenon of the Ag/Cu metals by dispersing the metals to ensure hydrothermal stability. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Ag–Cu ratio on the catalytic profile of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. For this purpose, zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts with different ratio were synthesized by impregnation method. The physico-chemical profiles of catalysts were probed by using variety of analytical techniques. Reaction studies of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were evaluated for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in slurry reactor."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Copper nitrate hexahydrate and silver nitrate were used as starting materials in the current work. Mordenite type of zeolite was utilized as catalyst support. Ammonium hydroxide was used for basic medium to synthesize zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts.
3,Catalysts synthesis,"2.2 Catalysts synthesis Impregnation method was employed for the syntheses of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. A known amount of copper nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in distilled water. This was followed by the addition of given amount of silver nitrate. Given amount of zeolite was added to the stirring solution. Synthesis of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were carried out in basic medium by using ammonium hydroxide solution. The reaction was performed at 85 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring. The precipitates were filtered and dried for 10 h. The zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts with 1:9, 2:8, 4:6 and 1:1 wt ratios were synthesized and symbolized as 1Ag9CuZ, 2Ag8CuZ, 4Ag6CuZ and 5Ag5CuZ catalysts, respectively. The synthesized catalysts were calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. Catalysts were reduced in hydrogen flow at 360 °C for 5 h before evaluation of reaction data."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization The thermal profiles of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were explored by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). For thermogravimetric analysis TGA MODEL Libra TG209 F1 was employed. The crystallographic properties of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were examined by Rigaku Japan model UltimaIV. XRD measurements were performed from 10 to 80° with Bragg angle 2θ at room temperature. Morphology of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts was investigated by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). FESEM instrument JEOL Japan with model ASEM 6360A was used. BET surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were measured by Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms technique. In the current work, quantachrome autosorb IQ model ASIQA3V600000-6 device was used for such measurements. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to study the oxidation states of metals and their mutual chemical interaction. Reduced catalysts were subjected to XPS investigations. Thermo Scientific model K-ALPHA Surface Analysis was used for the study."
5,Activity studies,"2.4 Activity studies Slurry reactor Parr 5500 was used to evaluate the catalytic performance zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. A 50 ml ethanol was placed in the reactor vessel. Reduced catalyst (0.5 g) was suspended in the reaction solvent. The reactor vessel was closed and saturated with the reactant gases mixture of CO2/H2 1: 3 M ratios. To remove any air, reactor vessel was firstly purged by CO2/H2 gases. The reactor vessel was pressurized to 30 bar and temperature was raised to 230 °C. Gas Chromatography (GC) was employed to evaluate the reaction products. Rate of methanol synthesis was calculated as follows (Din et al., 2020a). R a t e o f m e t h a n o l y i e l d = g o f m e t h a n o l p r o d u c e d / K g o f c a t a l y s t × h Methanol selectivity was evaluated as follows (Din et al., 2020b). M e t h . s e l e c t i v i t y = [ m o l e s o f m e t h a n o l p r o d u c e d t o t a l m o l e s o f p r o d u c t s ] × 100"
6,Results and discussions,
7,TGA studies,"3.1 TGA studies The thermal profiles of zeolite based bimetallic catalysts were explored by thermal gravimetric analysis and their respective TGA/DTG curves are displayed by Fig. 1 . Thermal gravimetric analysis data were obtained from room temperature up to 1000 °C at 10 °C per minute heating rate in air flow. The TGA curves of bimetallic catalysts clearly indicates the weight losses in three major regions. The first weight loss observed from room temperature up to 110 °C shows the loss of water molecules from the catalysts surface. Another steady weight loss was observed from 110 up to 350 °C. This weight loss could be attributed to the decomposition of nitrate precursors used during the synthesis of catalysts, indicating 350 °C as an appropriate calcinations temperature. The final weight loss observed over 350 °C could be credited to the elimination of entrapped water molecules in zeolite inner structures (Drechsel et al., 2004; Akinlolu et al., 2019). Irrespective of the zeolite based bimetallic catalysts with different Ag–Cu ratio, overall total 10% weight loss was observed for all studied catalysts indicating the thermal stability of the catalysts. The DTG curves support the TGA findings by manifesting three DTG peaks at the respective temperature range. Furthermore, DTG analysis shows higher decomposition rate for the first weight loss however, almost constant decomposition rate was observed in weight losses for the rest of the temperature zones. By a closer look at Fig. 1, it could be observed that incorporation of Ag to the zeolite based Cu catalyst resulted in increasing slightly the thermal stability of the catalyst. The thermal stability of catalysts was recorded in order of 4Ag6CuZ ˃ 2AgCuZ ˃ 1Ag9CuZ ˃ 5Ag5CuZ catalysts. In summarizing the TGA studies, zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts were found thermally stable, indicating 350 °C an appropriate calcinations temperature to decompose the nitrate salts of the precursors materials. Furthermore, the TGA results also concluded 4Ag6CuZ catalyst with highest thermal stability."
8,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis XRD pattern of bare zeolite and Ag/Cu bimetallic doped zeolite is presented in Fig. 2 . XRD pattern of bare zeolite exhibited at 2θ = 6.55, 9.78, 13.56, 15.32, 19.74, 22.50, 25.81, 27.34 and 30.98 confirming the mordenite phase of zeolite used in the current work. The X-ray diffraction peaks of zeolite were disappeared with only two small diffraction peaks were observed by incorporation of metal loading over zeolite support. This indicates that structure of zeolite has been modified by metal loadings. The disappearance zeolite diffraction peaks could be ascribed to local defects sites and to hydrolysis of minor fraction of AlAO bonds by sudden exposure of calcined samples to air (Singh et al., 2016). Such behavior of zeolite structure modification with metal loadings has been reported in the literature (Xu et al., 2020; Kharchenko, 2017). Besides zeolite diffraction peaks, diffraction pattern of CuO was observed indicating the crystalline nature of the material. No diffraction line was recorded for Ag content in all promoted catalysts. The disappearance of Ag diffraction line could be due to the small size of Ag particles. Similarly, high dispersion of Ag content could also be responsible for the non-existence of its diffraction pattern as reported in the literature (Din et al., 2020b)."
9,Morphology investigations,"3.3 Morphology investigations FESEM images of zeolite and zeolite supported Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3 . The FESEM images revealed the incorporation of Ag–Cu metals on the surface of the support. Furthermore, it could also be observed from the images that both metals are fairly dispersed on the surface of the support."
10,BET analysis,"3.4 BET analysis The nitrogen adsorption-desorption was used to study the surface parameters of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. The recorded magnitudes of BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter are documented ion Table 1 . BET surface area and pore volume were drastically declined from 330 to 223 m2/g and from 1.05 to 0.06 cc/g by incorporation of Ag–Cu metals on the surface of the support. Similarly, BET surface area was slightly decreased from 223 to 210 m2/g by increasing Ag/Cu ratio from 1:9 to 4:6 over zeolite based bimetallic catalysts. This could be justified by subsequent expansion in the pore diameter. In contrast, BET surface area was increased for the zeolite based bimetallic catalysts with Ag–Cu 1:1 ratio. Generally, BET surface area is inversely proportional to the pore diameter. This is because of the fact that particles with smaller pores diameter display larger specific surface area. However, porosity is another important parameters defining the alteration in BET surface area. In some cases, particles with small pore diameters shows small surface area due to small number of pores per gram . In the current work, surface parameters were less affected by variation of Ag–Cu metal ratios. This is quite understandable as the total metal loading remains the same 10 wt % throughout the bimetallic ratios."
11,XPS investigations,"3.5 XPS investigations XPS spectra of zeolite based Ag Cu bimetallic catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . In the current work, the XPS peaks of both Cu 2p and Ag 3d were observed to be shifted to slightly higher binding energy levels indicating the mutual chemical interaction between the two metals, as discussed in the following lines. Fig. 4 displays XPS spectra of Cu 2p core electrons. Two traditional XPS peaks were observed at binding energy values of 937 and 957 eV representing Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively (Sobuś et al., 2019). In XPS spectra of 2Ag8CuZ and 5Ag5CuZ catalysts, no satellite peak was observed confirming the metallic form of copper. In contrast besides the fundamental Cu 2p peaks, the XPS spectra of 1Ag9CuZ and 4Ag6CuZ exhibited satellite peak at binding energy value at 947 eV showing the existence of Cu 2+ in the form of CuO. Fig. 5 displays XPS spectra of Ag 3d core level. The XPS spectra of Ag 3d exhibited a doublet at 372.16 eV and 378.16 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. The existence of Ag 3d exhibited a doublet with a splitting of 6.0 eV, confirms the Ag0 as the predominant oxidation state of Ag in the zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts as reported in the literature (Wang et al., 2017). Keeping in mind the lower reduction temperature of Ag as compared to Cu, the reduced state of Ag is quite understandable (Zhang et al., 2015). As evident from the tabulated data Table 2 , the decrease in Cu content in the bimetallic catalyst shifted the position of Cu 2p3/2 peak to slightly higher binding energy region indicating the strong metal support interaction. Likewise, the shift of Cu 2p3/2 peak to higher binding energy with decreasing Cu content also intimates the chemical interaction between Cu and Ag metals where Cu shows greater tendency to lose electrons (Wang et al., 2012). In the same way, the Ag 3d5/2 peak in bimetallic catalysts observed the same positive shift (e.g., 371 eV→372.92 eV) with the increasing Ag concentration. The positive shift in Ag 3d5/2 peak binding energy exhibited the same interaction of the two metals with tendency of Ag to lose electrons (Wang et al., 2005). This mutual transformations of electrons between the two metals could also be justified by very narrow difference in the electro negativities of Ag and Cu being 4.44 eV and 4.48 eV, respectively (Greiner et al., 2018). Thus, chemical interaction of both metals can be justified by the corresponding shift in the magnitude of binding energy in the zeolite supported bimetallic catalysts. Metal-metal interaction has been recorded in the bimetallic catalysts in the literature. A metal-metal interaction between Rh and Au bimetallic catalysts was observed to be different over different supports (Nunez and Rouco, 1988). The magnitude of metal metal support between Au and Rh was recorded in order of SiO2 > Ti02 > Al2O3. Likewise, a detailed investigations regarding the metal‐metal interaction, their mechanism and their contribution to the catalytic performance has been documented very recently by Xiong et al. (2020). The chemical interaction between the two metals could be one of the active parameters responsible for the catalysts activity as 4Ag6CuZ catalyst with highest interaction resulted in highest methanol synthesis rate. In summarizing the discussion, XPS investigation revealed existence of Ag and Cu metals predominantly in metallic form. Furthermore, the study concluded that chemical interaction of both Cu and Ag resulted in the variation in binding energy with varying Ag/Cu ratios in zeolite based bimetallic catalyst."
12,Activity profile of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts,"The activity studies were conducted in slurry reactor over zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. As shown in tabulated data Table 2, methanol synthesis rate was accelerated by incrementing Ag content in zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. This indicates the promoting role of Ag in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, as reported its supporting behavior in hydrogenation reactions in the literature (González et al., 2007). The maximum methanol synthesis rate was recorded for 4Ag6CuZ catalyst, however it was slightly decreased with further enrichment of Ag content. In contrast, methanol selectivity was observed to be continuously declined with increasing Ag content. Actually by increasing the Ag content in the zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts, the Cu content in the catalysts is decreased. Since, Cu metal has been reported with higher selectivity in methanol synthesis catalysts, the decreasing trend in methanol synthesis catalysts as a consequent to decreasing Cu content could be justified. The products identification studies revealed the production of methyl cyclooctane, dimethyl octane and phenol as the byproducts in the current studies. The exact mechanism related to the formation of methyl cyclooctane, dimethyl octane and phenol is not exactly known. However, formation of variety of higher alcohol and hydrocarbons has been reported in the literature (Toyir et al., 2009). Similarly, the formation of hydrocarbon chains, (CH2)n, and final products, such as olefins, aromatics, and gasoline has been reported as methanol also serve as an intermediate to synthesize variety of alcohols and hydrocarbons. Similarly, depending on the reaction conditions and nature of catalyst variety of alcohols and hydrocarbons formation have been recorded in the literature (Ye et al., 2019). In describing the structure-activity relations, the catalysts activity was observed to be tailored by the mutual chemical interaction between the Ag–Cu metals. As displayed by XPS investigations 4Ag6CuZ catalyst was recorded with greatest chemical interaction, the highest methanol synthesis rate was also observed for the same catalyst. Such observation of increasing catalysts activity with increasing metal-metal interaction were also documented by Vedyagin et al. over Pd–Rh/alumina catalysts for CO oxidation (Vedyagin et al., 2017). The key role of metal-metal interaction can also be justified in a scenario where metal-metal interaction led to increase the thermal stability of the catalysts as indicated by TGA studies. Due the greater thermal stability, catalysts activity was promoted as exhibited by the reaction studies. In this case, TGA studies support the XPS investigations which in turn manifest metal-metal interaction as an active parameter for higher catalyst activity. Based on these observations, metal-metal interaction is ascribed to be the main parameter controlling the rate of reaction. Comparative data of the activity profile of the current bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with other traditional supported catalysts have been displayed by Table 3 . It can be inferred from the tabulated data that the activity of Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts was found better in terms of methanol synthesis rate than the many catalytic system reported in the literature."
13,Conclusion,"In the current work, the role of Ag promotion was investigated over zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The physicochemical techniques confirmed synthesis of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts. The activity studies concluded the promoting role of Ag for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The metal-metal interaction was found to play an active role in catalytic profile of zeolite based Ag–Cu bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol."
