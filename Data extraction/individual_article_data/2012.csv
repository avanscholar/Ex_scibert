0,Introduction,"Diesel engines are widely used in agriculture, transportation and industry due to their high reliability, combustion efficiency and power output. However, With the increase of serious pollution and emission problems, developing new technologies with low emissions and high fuel efficiency have plays a crucial part in the research of internal combustion engine (Pradelle et al., 2019). As a result, many alternative fuels have attracted the attention of a number of researchers, such as biodiesel, alcohols, ethers, 2,5-dimethylfuran, Natural Gas (Papagiannakis et al., 2017), Fischer–Tropsch diesel (Geng et al., 2020) and so on. Among these alternative fuels, biodiesel is the most widely used. Biodiesel has similar properties to diesel and is a renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic fuel. Therefore, it can be mixed with diesel in diesel engine. At the same time, biodiesel as co-solvent can be mixed with diesel and other oxygen-containing fuel to form ternary blends. However, biodiesel cannot be used directly on diesel engines due to its bad effects on engine operation (Yilmaz et al., 2017). In fact, biodiesel is a multiple-component mixture of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils and animal fats (Mirhashemi and Sadrnia, 2019). Even though biodiesel is renewable and biodegradable, the cost of raw materials becomes one of the most important economic factors. With the improvement of many methods and diversified selection of raw materials of producing biodiesel, it can be used better in engines. First of all, compared with pure diesel, biodiesel has higher cetane number, better ignition performance and higher combustion efficiency (Mirhashemi and Sadrnia, 2019). Moreover, the biodiesel acts as surfactant and it creates micelles having nonpolar tails and polar heads in the ternary blends (Babu and Anand, 2017). The biodiesel molecule’s polar head is directed to the alcohol and non-polar tail is directed to diesel, which promotes the mixing of alcohol and diesel. As we all know, the direct reason of forming soot, THC and CO emissions is incomplete combustion of fuel. Biodiesel can clear up the problems because of its high oxygen content. And many researchers have already gotten favorable results in studies on these emissions (Gokalp et al., 2011; Labeckas and Slavinskas, 2006; Lertsathapornsuk et al., 2008; Qi et al., 2010; Ryu, 2010; Suryawanshi, 2006). Despite all the advantages of using biodiesel, one of the main issues concerning the use of biodiesel is its poor low-temperature flow property, and many researchers have found that adding biodiesel to diesel will increase NOx emissions (Calder et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2018; Gumus and Kasifoglu, 2010; Özçelik et al., 2015; Rakopoulos et al., 2011; Raman et al., 2019). Another significant alternative fuel is alcohol, and it is widely used in gasoline engine because its suit cetane and octane number (No, 2016). Recently, more researchers have begun to use alcohol in compression ignition engines through blending with biodiesel because the high viscosities of biodiesel must be reduced (Atmanli, 2016a). Alcohol has been divided into two ways, which is lower alcohol (ranging from 1-carbon methanol to 2-carbon ethanol) and higher alcohol (ranging from 3-carbon propanol to 20-carbon phytol). Their properties are related to the number of carbon atoms, and they have higher cetane number (CN), calorific value, density and lower latent heat of evaporation (LHE), fraction of oxygen and corrosion risk with the increase of carbons. N-pentanol is five-carbon straight chain alcohol, which can improve the atomization quality of DB blends because the lower kinematic viscosity compared with biodiesel (Liang et al., 2021). Furthermore, the addition of n-pentanol has a good improvement of the low-temperature flow property of DB blends (Jin et al., 2019), and the alcohol can blend with diesel and biodiesel easily when it has more carbon atoms (Atmanli, 2016b). Atmanli and Yilmaz (2018) revealed that the addition of 1-pentanol to diesel exhibit a good stability without any indication of phase separation. Babu and Anand (2017) reported that the CO and NOx increased but the THC decreased when n-pentanol was added into biodiesel blend. That is because n-pentanol provides additional carbon and oxygen atoms. However, the blends with n-pentanol addition get higher brake specific energy consumption (BSFC) and lower ITE due to the lower heating value of n-pentanol, which means reducing emissions at the expense of cutting down engine performance (Appavu et al., 2019; Ashok et al., 2019; Atmanli and Yilmaz, 2020; Pan et al., 2019; Yilmaz et al., 2016). What is more, the addition of high carbon alcohols, like n-butanol, increases the generation of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) (Yilmaz and Davis, 2016). As for lower alcohol, ethanol can be produced from some agricultural products through fermentation process, such as corn, barley and so on, which makes it the most economically available (Aydin and Ilkiliç, 2010). Ethanol is widely used to form DBE blend because its properties like lower CN, high self-ignition temperatures, high latent heat of evaporation and so on Tutak et al. (2017). However, phase separation occurs when ethanol mixes with diesel under 10 °C (Yilmaz and Atmanli, 2017a), and that is the reason biodiesel can be used as an effective surfactant for DE blends. What is more, the literature reveals that DBE blends have been utilized in many studies. Hulwan and Joshi (2011) conducted experiments with diesel–ethanol–biodiesel of high ethanol content in a multicylinder DI diesel engine. They observed that the maximum reduction of soot emission was about 60% to 70% with ethanol addition at medium and high loads of both speeds. Fang et al. (2013) studied the effects of diesel–biodiesel–ethanol blends in a heavy-duty diesel engine. Their result showed that the main advantage of ethanol additive was to greatly reduce soot emissions because of the high present of oxygen. However, its low CN and high LHE to auto-ignition also weaken its advantages. Rakopoulos et al. (2019) reported that the soot emissions had a significant decrease while the THC and CO emissions increased compared to the n-butanol with ethanol added in diesel blend. Actually, ethanol has lower heating value than n-pentanol, and the power loss of the engine is more pronounced. Tongroon et al. (2019) got the same results and the blends had a higher BSFC correspondingly. Under normal steady state conditions, the process of cylinder pressure changing from one cycle to the next cycle will affect the running state of the engine (Amann, 1985). The variation of the cycle will affect the operating efficiency and stability of the engine, increase the noise and cause the loss of power (Giakoumis et al., 2016). Cyclic variation has been studied in spark ignition engines for a long time. Peters and Borman (1970) studied the effect of cyclic variations of burning. On the contrary, because of the stable combustion of diesel engines, the research on coefficient of variation in compression ignition engines is not as much as that in spark ignition engines. Moreover, through literature reading, there is less research on cycle variation of blended fuel in diesel engine, which are briefly outlined as follows. Rakopoulos et al. (2010) revealed the randomness of cyclic variations of combustion observed in diesel engine using neat cottonseed oil or its neat bio-diesel. Ali et al. (2015) studied the effect of different alcohol additives with blended fuel on cyclic variation in diesel engine. Tang et al. (2011) investigated the combustion cyclic variability in a non-road diesel engine with diesel/bio-diesel blends. According to the literature review, current published work in this field shows limited results on the effects of blend of biodiesel, lower and higher alcohols on engine combustion characteristics and emissions in the same engine, even lesser researches have been done with various speeds about coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Therefore, the performance and emissions characteristics of diesel/biodiesel/alcohol blends in a diesel engine were investigated in the same engine. And it is important to identify such effects in order to aid in future alcohol mixture choice and understand the reliability of potential alternatives, and is hoped that the data from this study can provide a basis for the extensive use of alternative fuels in compression ignition engines in the future."
1,Experimental setup and methods,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup The experiments were performed on a modified single-cylinder diesel engine with a common rail fuel injection system, which is 4-valve, four-stroke and water-cooled, and is shown in Fig. 1. Key specifications of the engine were showed in Table 1. The Bosch electronic control unit (ECU) dominated the common rail fuel injection system, which controlled injection parameter. The pressure sensor (Kistler 6125 A) measured the cylinder pressure with corresponding charge amplifier. In order to stabilize the value of the cyclic irregularity (Rakopoulos et al., 2019), the pressure data was taken every 0.5 crank angle and the used data was the ensemble average of 100 sequential engine cycles. And the cooling water temperature was automatically controlled by a thermostat to 85 °C and the control temperature is ± 1 °C. The lubricating oil temperature ranged from 95 to 100 °C according to the engine load and speed. The exhaust gas analyzer (Horiba, MEXA-7100DEGR) measured the gas emissions, which had ± 0.5% full scale and 1 ppm resolution. The chemiluminescent NOx analyzer (CLA) measured the NOx emissions. The THC emissions were measured using the method of hydrogen flame ionization, and the CO emissions were measured using the method of no-dispersive infra-red (NDIR). The smoke was measured by an AVL 415S filter that the uncertainty is 0.005 FSN ＋ 3% of measured value and the resolution is 0.001 FSN). An external compressor and temperature control system was used to supply the intake air to engine. The intake temperature was kept at 25 °C and intake pressure was kept at 0.15 MPa. The COV of IMEP was calculated as follows: (1) σ i m e p = ∑ i n i m e p i − i m e p m e a n 2 n − 1 (2) i m e p m e a n = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n i m e p i (3) C O V i m e p = σ i m e p i m e p m e a n In these equations, n is the number of cycles, σ i m e p is the standard deviation of the mean effective pressure, i m e p i is the indicated mean effective pressure of each cycle and i m e p m e a n is the mean indicated mean effective pressure (Saleh, 2009)."
3,Test fuels,"2.2 Test fuels The tested fuels in this paper were pure diesel, biodiesel, ethanol and n-pentanol, and Table 2 shows their major properties. The pure diesel and biodiesel were provided by China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation and Jinan Decheng Chemical Co., Ltd, respectively. There are four types of blended fuels involved in this paper, which are noted as B10 (10% biodiesel by volume), B10E10 (10% biodiesel and %10 ethanol by volume), B10E20 (10% biodiesel and 20% ethanol by volume), and B10P10 (10% biodiesel and 10% n-pentanol). And the pure diesel was 100% by volume referred to as D100. The number of Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) of n-pentanol is 71-41-0 and it is 64-17-5 for ethanol. All of the blends are steady phase without any indication of phase separation after standing for a day."
4,Test conditions,"2.3 Test conditions During the test, analyzing the combustion and emission performance of each tested blend fuels at different speeds while the fuel injection quantity was still fixed at 60 mg/cycle. The injection timing was fixed at −4 ° CA ATDC. All the experimental data were recorded online and analyzed offline."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effects of fuel properties and speeds on combustion characteristics,"3.1 Effects of fuel properties and speeds on combustion characteristics As for internal combustion engines, ignition delay (ID) is one of the most important processes in combustion phase. ID is defined as the crank angle difference between the start of injection and 10% of heat release, and it begins with two processes happening at the same time. One is physical process, and the atomization of fuels and uniformity of fuel–air mixture are the main factors affecting ID, which are caused by volatility, viscosity and density of fuels. The other is chemical processes, and the factors affecting ID during this process are temperature and pressure in cylinder, mainly in premixed combustion. Moreover, ID directly affects the efficiency, noise and emissions of engine (Tutak et al., 2017). Fig. 2 depicts the changes of ID for all tested fuels at various speeds. It is clear that ID is prolonged as speeds increase. Because the higher speed suppresses the atomization of fuels and uniformity of fuel–air mixture, which makes combustion worse and naturally lengthen ID. In addition, the rate of increase is faster before 1500 rpm, but slowed after it. What is more, the ID of the DBA blends at each speed are lengthened to different degrees compared with diesel. Furthermore, ID of B10E20 is longer than B10E10 at 1800 rpm because of the high latent heat of vaporization of ethanol, which strengthens the decline of combustion temperature. And because the higher cetane number of n-pentanol, the B10P10 has a shorter ID than DBE blends, which results in low spontaneous combustion temperature and improves fuel evaporation performance. Fig. 3(a)–(c) depicts the changes of in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) among all fuels at various speeds with crankshaft angle. The results showed that the DBE blends get the highest in-cylinder pressure and HRR of the tested fuels, and the reasons are as follow. Firstly, a better gasification of ethanol absorbs a large amount of heat that extends flame retardation during premixed combustion phase. Secondly, it can easily form a combustible gas mixture when the mixing ratio increases due to higher oxygen content of ethanol, which is conducive to a rapid combustion and heat release. What is more, the HRR curve of tested fuels have an obvious distinction between premixed combustion and diffusion combustion. And the peak HRR shifts backward as the speeds increase, which is related to the changes of ID after changing the speed. And the peak HRR of pure diesel comes to appear in premixed combustion phase at 1800 rpm. Moreover, the peak HRR of DBE blends always appears in premixed combustion phase due to the longer ID (Zhang et al., 2013). A direct manifestation is that the pressure rise rates increase as shown in Fig. 4. Pressure rise rate is one of the important indicators to evaluate the rapid burning period of engine and the engine combustion noise. The Fig. 4 shows that the maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) decreases as speed rises for the tested fuels because the mean in-cylinder temperature decreases as shown in Fig. 7. At the same speed, the MPRR increases with the addition of oxygenated fuel, especially the addition of alcohol, which is because the low CN of alcohol led to longer ID (Ahmadi et al., 2019). Moreover, all the tested fuels maintain a consistent drop ratio as the speed increases from 1500 rpm to 1800 rpm, expect for B10E10. The big drop should be a disadvantage for B10E10, which means that engine’s power ability has a big loss at high speed. Fig. 5 depicts the changes of indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) at diverse speeds for tested fuels. ITE is evaluated from the fuel flow rate, the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) during compression and expansion only and the input fuel energy (Zhang et al., 2012). Because ITE evaluates the combustion only in a single cycle, it is related to factors such as combustion duration and combustion quality. It is not difficult to see from Fig. 5 that ITE decreases as the speed increases for the pure diesel and B10. It should be pointed out that ITE has a significant decrease compared with pure diesel at 1000 rpm when biodiesel is added, because the viscosity increases after biodiesel is added. The atomization performance becomes worse, and the combustion efficiency of DB blend fuels is reduced (Chen et al., 2018). What is more, the declining rate with speed decreases when adding alcohol to DB blends, especially n-pentanol. In addition, the ITE of B10E10 gets the maximum, reaching 46.9% at 1500 rpm, which means that lower alcohols have advantages in ITE. Fig. 5 also shows that ITE decreases as the proportion of ethanol increases due to the high LHE of ethanol. Fig. 6 indicates the coefficient of variation (COV) of IMEP at various speeds for tested fuels. The COV of IMEP value indicates the degree of change in the combustion completeness (Saleh, 2009). It can be clearly seen that the COV has an obvious decrease at 1500 rpm among the test fuels expect for B10P10, which means smaller variation and more stable combustion state. What is more, the most DBA blends get a significant reduction compared with pure diesel. However, B10E20 blend fuel causes an increase at 1500 rpm and 1800 rpm, which is because the cetane number of ethanol is low compared with n-pentanol and it causes a deterioration in combustion stability (Ali et al., 2015). Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that B10P10 has a better performance among the speed changing compared with other tested fuels, despite it has the highest COV at 1000 rpm."
7,Effects of fuel properties and engine speeds on emission characteristics,"3.2 Effects of fuel properties and engine speeds on emission characteristics Fig. 8 shows the NOx emissions at different speeds for tested fuels. As we all known, the formation factors of NOx are related to oxygen concentration, combustion temperature and combustion duration. In fact, oxides of nitrogen (N2) are made up of many components, which are 90 vol% nitric oxide (NO), 5 vol% nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and 5 vol% nitric oxide (N2O, N2O3, and N2O5) (Yilmaz and Atmanli, 2017b). Obviously, NOx emissions decrease significantly of tested fuels as speed increases because fuel–air​ mixes well with speed increasing. The NOx of D100, B10, B10P10, and B10E10 decrease by 67.7%, 64.2%, 64.6%, and 52.8% from 1000 rpm to 1800 rpm, respectively. Similar results were also found in the study of Canakci et al. (2009). At the same time, the proportion of homogeneous mixed gas in cylinder increases, in-cylinder thermal state gradually improves and the oxygen-enriched area decreases, which causes a decrease of NOx. Comparing with various fuels, NOx of B10 is lower than D100 at 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm. But at 1800 rpm, higher viscosity and density of DB blend causes a worse atomization comparing with D100 at high speed. The proportion of oxygen-rich regions increases, so NOx is slightly higher than D100 at high speeds. Moreover, longer ID of DB blends also limit NOx production comparing with other fuels and ethanol fraction lengthens the time of fuel vaporization and mixing processes (Tongroon et al., 2019). Therefore, the performance of lower alcohols on NOx is better than higher alcohols. And the addition of n-pentanol has a very little effect on NOx emissions (Huang et al., 2020). However, high latent heat of vaporization which causes the decline of exhaust gas temperatures for DBP blends (Yilmaz et al., 2018). Thus, the NOx emission of B10P10 decreases compared with DB blends at low speeds. Fig. 9 shows soot emissions of tested fuels at different speeds. To be brief, incomplete combustion is the main reason to form soot emissions. Oxygenated fuel is one method to solve this problem (Ma et al., 2021), especially the addition of alcohol to diesel and DB blends. That is because high concentrations of free radicals (mainly OH) in alcohols reduce soot emissions by limiting the growth of aromatic rings and nucleation (He et al., 2018). Due to high viscosity and density of biodiesel, the atomization of B10 becomes worse resulting in higher soot emissions at low speeds such as 1000 rpm. Moreover, the combustion state becomes better and soot emissions decrease as speed increases to 1500 rpm. When speed increases to 1800 rpm, soot emissions increase again. After adding n-pentanol to DB blend, it has same trend as DB blend, which is caused by the density and volatility of n-pentanol. But adding ethanol to the DB blend can reduce soot emissions excellently. This is because ethanol has good volatility, which can form a better homogeneous mixture at low speeds. In Fig. 7, the average in-cylinder temperature of B10E10 blend continuously decreases with the increase of speeds. The higher speed achieves, the more obvious mean in cylinder temperature decreases. The greater inhibitory effect of this process has, the higher the DBE blends’ soot emissions get at high speeds. Fig. 10 shows THC emissions change of tested fuels at different speeds. It can be clearly seen that THC emissions of D100 are worser at high speeds than at low speeds. However, the THC emissions gradually decrease for B10 and B10P10 blends as speed increases. The reason is that air vortex speed is slow at low speeds, and it is not conducive to the formation of homogeneous mixture, which increases the probability of forming a rich fuel–air mixture (Pradelle et al., 2019). In addition, the THC emissions of B10E10 increase with speed increasing. The reason is not only the rich fuel area, but also due to the temperature during the combustion. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the average temperature in cylinder also decreases with speed increasing. As the amount of ethanol added to DB blend increases, THC emissions also increase at 1500 rpm. Similarly, Yilmaz and Sanchez (2012) reported that biodiesel–ethanolnol additives increase THC emissions compared to DB blends. Obviously, this is due to the increased fuel-to-hydrocarbon ratio. At 1800 rpm, the THC emissions do not continue to increase but decrease from 103 ppm to 95 ppm for B10E20 compared with B10E10, which is because increased air vortex velocity and the volatility of high concentration ethanol promote the formation of homogeneous mixed gas. The effect of benefit and suppression in combustion is offset. What is more, the former has upper hand currently. It can also be found that B10P10 has better THC emissions compared to several other fuels. In Fig. 11, CO emissions changes of various fuels at different speeds are shown. Obviously, CO emissions gradually rise with speed increasing. CO emissions can be used as a basis for judging whether the combustion is burned completely (Rakopoulos et al., 2019). After adding ethanol to DB blend, CO emissions of B10E10 decrease at all tested speed. This shows that the combustion rate is improved due to the addition of ethanol. It is worth to notice that the addition to DB blends get better CO emissions when compared to other blended fuels (Pan et al., 2019), except at 1000 rpm. The better CO emissions of DBP blends compared with DBE blends is due to higher flame propagation speed of higher alcohols. Therefore, DBP blend burns faster and it reduces incomplete combustion. Moreover, the cetane number is another reason that affects CO emissions. A high cetane number can ensure that the fuel burns more complete, thereby reducing CO production (Yesilyurt et al., 2018). Overall, in the case of high and medium speed, the addition of n-pentanol to DB blend is more conducive to control the generation of CO emissions."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, the effects of lower and higher alcohol contents were investigated in a modified single cylinder diesel engine with different speeds on combustion characteristics and emissions. The primary results are drawn as follows: 1. The maximum pressure rise rate maintains a consistent drop ratio as the speed increases from 1500 rpm to 1800 rpm for the tested fuels. However, B10E10 fuel has a big drop, and it can be a disadvantage, which means that engine’s power ability has a big loss at high speed. 2. The declining rate with speed decreases for ITE when adding alcohol to DB blends, especially for n-pentanol. What is more, B10E10 gets the maximum at 1500 rpm which means that the addition of lower alcohols has advantages in ITE. 3. B10P10 has smaller variation and more stable combustion state among the speed changing compared with other tested fuels, despite it has the highest COV at 1000 rpm. And this indicates that the addition of n-pentanol has advantages in combustion stability. 4. It can also be found that B10P10 has better THC emissions compared to other fuels. And in the case of high and medium speed, the addition of n-pentanol to DB blends is more conducive to controlling the generation of CO emissions. 5. Overall consideration, using diesel/biodiesel/alcohol ternary fuels may be a better choice for diesel engines. What is more, lower alcohol can reduce NOx and soot emissions effectively and also has better performance. Further analysis of some unregulated emissions and the performance of different fuel blends under different fuel injection timing should be discussed and investigated."
