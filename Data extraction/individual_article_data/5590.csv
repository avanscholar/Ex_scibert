0,Introduction,"Hydrogels have attracted significant interest in biomedical fields due to their distinctive properties and benefit of displaying characteristics similar to soft biological tissues (Bhattarai, Ramay, Gunn, Matsen, & Zhang, 2005; Zhu, 2010), for example, they can assure an appropriate level of moisture at the interface between the body and outside, providing a moist environment with the delivery of drug content. Among bio-based polymers, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) becoming a well-known synthetic polymer ascribes to its desirable characteristics such as water-soluble, nontoxic, transparent and biocompatible as well as biodegradable, which make it adaptable for the applications in tissue scaffolding, filtration materials, membranes, and drug release (Abdelgawad, Hudson, & Rojas, 2014; Priya, Gupta, Pathania, & Singha, 2014). For instance, porous PVA foams have been widely studied by high-speed mixing with and without pore-forming agent (Siró & Plackett, 2010; Srithep, Turng, Sabo, & Clemons, 2012). However, the degradation rate of neat PVA strongly depends on the residual acetate groups, so that the slow degradation restricts its wide application. In addition, the low mechanical strength and integrity of PVA demand the use of reinforcing agents, for example, carbon nanotubes and chitin whiskers (Jeong et al., 2007; Wong, Hutter, Zinke-Allmang, & Wan, 2009). Thus it has often been studied as a polymeric matrix due to the improved properties by incorporating nanostructures. The use of natural polymers as components of polymeric materials is of great interest, due to the diversity of their properties, but also for economic and ecological reasons. Among natural polymers, cellulose, an environmentally sustainable material, has been attractive in the applications of tissue engineering, drug delivery and superabsorbent (Chen et al., 2016; French, 2014; Huang et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the hydrogels made of pure cellulose are known in difficulty because of less solubility in common organic solvents. Moreover, because pristine cellulose fibers have already formed either intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, their direct incorporation into polymer matrix cannot play a good role in improving mechanical properties (Thakur & Thakur, 2014). Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), owing to its low density, high surface areas, excellent mechanical properties, readily biocompatibility and biodegradability, could be incorporated into a wide range of polymer matrices to enhance the properties of hydrogel composites (George, Sajeevkumar, Ramana, Sabapathy, & Siddaramaiah, 2012; Klemm et al., 2011; Moon, Martini, Nairn, Simonsen, & Youngblood, 2011). CNFs can be produced from a variety of cellulose sources, either by hydrolysis (Rånby, 1951) or oxidation (Beck-Candanedo, Roman, & Gray, 2005), giving nanocrystals different dimensions and surface. Among cellulose sources, bacterial cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter xylinus exhibits higher crystallinity and degree of polymerisation, which makes it superior to plant cellulose (Huang et al., 2014). The exceptional mechanical strength together with high aspect ratio and large surface area enable these nanofibrils to reinforce a wide variety of polymers even at very low filler loadings, which improves their potential applications in adsorption materials, drug delivery, as well as biological scaffolds (Chen et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2014). It should be pointed that sulphuric acid hydrolysis could produce more stable colloidal suspensions of CNFs in water. The stabilization is due to electrostatic effects arising from charged sulfate ester groups which are introduced onto the CNFs surfaces during acidic treatment (Abitbol, Johnstone, Quinn, & Gray, 2011). Previous studies adopted a biomimetic approach for the production of nanocomposites of BC and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). It was found that even though the reinforcing BC phase could be evenly distributed over the entire matrix, loss or solubilization of the polymer matrix (PVA) occurred upon post processing (washing and purification) (Brown & Laborie, 2007; Mahanta & Valiyaveettil, 2012). In this work, PVA/CNFs hydrogel using CNFs as the reinforcement and PVA as the matrix material was prepared after glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The hydroxyl groups in PVA are expected to form hydrogen bonds and acetal linkages with cellulose. The solvent exchange method was also employed to help build porous structure. The effect of the CNFs content on the properties of the biocomposite scaffold was investigated and characterized. The materials exhibit good mechanical, thermal properties as well as great biocompatibility which ensure their application of three-dimensional scaffold materials in tissue engineering."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Sulfuric acid, poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA, MW∼95000gmol−1), polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW∼4000gmol−1), glutaraldehyde (GA, crosslinker, 25wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (analytic grade). BC samples were cultivated using an Acetobacterxylinum NUST4.2 (keep in our Lab) through a static fermentation process at 30°C (Sun, Zhou, Wu, & Yang, 2007). They were treated with 0.1M of sodium hydroxide solution at 80°C for 2h in order to rinse off the bacteria, and then brought to a neutral pH value by washing steps with distilled water several times. Cell culture reagents RPMI-1640 were supplied by AbcamInc (USA), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from GIBCO. MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was purchased from Sigma. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments."
3,Preparation of CNFs,"2.2 Preparation of CNFs CNFs were obtained from acid hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose using 50wt% sulfuric acid at 50°C for 4h, as described previously (Beck-Candanedo et al., 2005). The CNFs precipitate was then rinsed, centrifuged and dialyzed until constant neutral pH was achieved. The final concentration of the dilute suspension prepared was controlled to 0.5g/ml and completed by an ultrasonic treatment for 10min. The suspension was stored in the refrigerator before use."
4,Preparation PVA/CNFs hydrogel,"2.3 Preparation PVA/CNFs hydrogel PVA was dissolved in deionized water under constant stirring at 90°C to achieve 4wt% homogeneous solution with 0.5%PEG added. Then CNFs in different amounts were added into the PVA/PEG solution, under magnetic stirrer for 2h at 70°C. The ratio of PVA and CNFs of 2/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3(w/w) were prepared, which were coded as PVACNFs30, PVACNFs50, PVACNFs65, PVACNFs80,respectively, and the sample without CNFs was used as control group. 1% glutaraldehyde was added in mixed solution as crosslinking agent following by ultrasonic for 30min. The resulting aqueous gels were transferred into 24-well plate and quenched at −20°C in the fridge followed by solvent exchange with tert-butanol. Then, the samples were freeze-dried in a lyophilizer at −40°C and 0.0014 mBar vacuum for 24h."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization 2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The surface and the matrix sheets of PVA/CNFs with different composition were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a SU8010 (Hitachi Ltd., Japan) operated at 3.5kV. All the samples were coated with a thin layer of evaporated gold and fastened to the brass holder after freeze-drying. 2.4.2 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image acquisition was performed on a JEM-2100 (Japan) and operated at 200kV. For the TEM measurements, samples were deposited onto the copper grids covered with holey carbon support films. 2.4.3 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy FTIR spectra of freeze-dried BC and PVA/CNFs nanocomposites were recorded on a 5DX (Shimazdu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in absorption mode in the range of 4000–4500cm−1.To establish accuracy, thirty-two scans were performed. 2.4.4 X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD) The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Germany) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418nm) at a scanning rate of 4° min−1 in the 2θ range of 10° to 90°. Operating voltage and current were 40kV and 40mA, respectively. 2.4.5 Thermogravimetry Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA, Mettler Toledo) was performed to study the thermal degradation behavior of the composite samples. The TGA apparatus was flushed with nitrogen atmosphere, and 10mg of sample was used. Each specimen was heated from 50°C to 600°Cat a heating rate of 10°C/min. 2.4.6 Mechanical testing The tensile stress-strain tests were performed on a universal materials tester (AGS-100NX, Shimazdu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in tensile mode. Testing Machine was with a gauge length of 25mm and a cross-head speed of 10mmmin−1. Prior to testing, samples were incubated in distilled water at 37°C for 24h. Samples were cut into rectangular strips with dimensions of 25mm*40mm and three strips were tested for each sample. 2.4.7 Water content and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) swelling behavior Water content was evaluated after immersion of the samples in pure water at room temperature for 48h, all samples were controlled under the same dimension. After removal of excess water, the weight W fin were measured. Then the samples were dried at 50°C for 48h until their weight maintained constant W ini . The water content of dry sample (swelling fraction) W s was calculated using the equation: W s =(W fin −W ini )/W fin. The dried samples were also immersed in PBS solution at room temperature for 72h, the final weight were noted W fin ’. The PBS absorbency of dry sample (swelling fraction) W s ’ was calculated using the equation: W s ’=(W fin ’−W ini )/W fin ’ For the kinetic study of the adsorption, the dried hydrogels were weighed (Wini) before being immersed in PBS with a pH 7.4, at 37°C. After immersion, the samples were removed at different time periods and the weight of the sample (Wt) gravimetrically determined after gently drying the surface moisture with the filter paper. The swelling degree (SD) was calculated according to the equation: SD=(Wt −Wini)/Wini*100 2.4.8 Cytotoxicity of PVA/CNFs porous hydrogel toward mammalian cells test Both BC and PVA/CNFs scaffolds were rinsed with alcohol, acetone and deionized water in turn. After sterilization, the samples were pre-treated by immersing in DMEM (Dilbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) in 24 well plates for 24h 3T3 fibroblast cells were seeded at a density of 2.5*104 cells/well and then incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 48h. The cell viabilities were analyzed using the standard methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay method at the wavelength of 570nm through a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite M200, Switzerland) (Hanelt, Gareis, & Kollarczik, 1994)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology of the composite membrane,"3.1 Morphology of the composite membrane A schematic representation of the fabrication of the composite scaffolds is shown in Fig. 1 . Most water-soluble polymers can be blended with other polymers and undergo crosslinking process either physically or chemically. A great variety of methods have been explored to prepare hydrogels and organic–inorganic nanocomposite systems. Among them, freezing and thawing method is a common physical crosslinking method due to its handleability. However, it consumes much more energy and time, and leads to a dense structure in physical hydrogels as a result of restricting the movement of polymer chains and the variation in macromolecular conformations, which also reduces the swelling ratio for hydrogels (Cai et al., 2009). On the other hand, as a highly versatile method to create and modify polymers, chemical crosslinking need additional reagents such as glutaraldehyde and succinyl chloride. And the properties such as mechanical, thermal and chemical stability proved to be increased after crosslinking (Chang, Lue, & Zhang, 2008). tert-butanol freeze-drying is an alternative to conventional freeze-drying. Due to the nature of tertbutanol, lower extent of surface tension effects is displayed during the drying process, which is able to create higher specific surface area (Cai, Kimura, Wada, Kuga, & Zhang, 2008). In addition, PEG is widely used in mixed polymer systems owing to its function of dispersant and stabilizer (Deng, Chen, Kulkarni, & Thompson, 2012). For example, adding PEG in NaOH/urea system was proved to improve the homogenous of regenerated BC solution (Cheng et al., 2015). The homogeneous dispersion of nanocellulose ensure a very large interfacial area between the matrix and the reinforcement. In our experiment, CNFs exhibited widely distributed width ranging from 10 to 90nm and length from one to dozens microns, and this fine micro-nano structure also lead to the good dispersion and incorporation into PVA matrix forming a network structure, which was confimed by TEM micrographs in Fig. 2 . The effect was also proved by our mixed solution which could keep good uniformity, without any hierarchy, or precipitation phenomenon even under the condition of standing for 10days. It is critical to effectively enhance the mechanical as well as thermal properties of the final nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy images of inside cross-section for different samples are illustrated in Fig. 3 . First of all, the respective nanocomposite fracture shows no evidence of agglomerates indicating that the CNFs ribbons were homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix. The PVA/CNFs samples present an interconnected and irregular porous structure with the pore size ranging from about several microns to dozens microns. As the increasing of the cellulose content, the material exhibits a more fluffy structure, while the pore walls become thicker. For biomedical applications, pore structure and porosity are important factors that affect the biological properties of the material. Holes and holes must be connected between each other in order to make cells grow and migrate in order to make nutrients or growth factors into the material inside. In this interpenetrating polymer network, PVA functioned as an adhesive to glue the oriented cellulose nanofibrils together, elevating the extension of the composites due to its excellent ductility. When the CNFs content becomes higher than fifty percent, the porous sponge hierarchical structure (Fig. 3a–d) chang into a wider skeleton porous structure (Fig. 3e and f), and finally, the CNFs are not gathered in PVA dense package to form pore wall, but become slice crimp connection when they reach a certain content (Fig. 3g and h) and serve as a physical crosslinking agent. So the cross-section of the composite exhibited more obvious brittle breaks with the decrease of PVA content, which indicated stronger interactions between the two components. This internal fiber network structure has a direct influence on the final mechanical characteristics of the composite and gives the material in adsorption, and cell differentiation great application value."
8,Structure of the composites,"3.2 Structure of the composites 3.2.1 ATR-FTIR analysis IR analysis of BC, PVA, and PVA/CNFs nanocomposites after washing and purification steps are presented in Fig. 4 a. The characteristic absorption bands of PVA occurring at 1,088, 919 and 838cm−1 were attributed to the stretching of CO, bending of CH2 and rocking of CH, respectively. The characteristic cellulose signals of COC pyranose ring skeletal vibration at 1,060 and 1,030cm−1 (indicated by the dotted line) was observed in the spectrum of composite loaded with CNFs (Lin, Huang, Chang, Feng, & Yu, 2011). And the band occurring at 1,080cm−1 arose from CO stretches of PVA, which shifted toward with that of cellulose in the composites samples. It might contribute to the interaction of hydroxyl groups of PVA with the hydrophilic surfaces of the cellulose. The OH stretching bands were enhanced with PEG added but mainly affected by the content of CNFs, indicating excellent water retention of our nanocomposites. Interestingly, the band strongly related with the PVA crystallinity was observed at 1,120cm−1 corresponding to symmetric CC stretching, which was increased with CNFs content from the PVA/CNFs30 to the PVA/CNFs50 composite. The results indicate the decreased intensity of bands for OH stretching vibration combined with the increased intensity of bands for CO and CO stretching vibrations are the proofs of PVA/CNFs composites cross-linking. And the presence of CNFs might improve the PVA crystallinity at a given concentration. 3.2.2 X-ray diffraction measurements Fig. 4b shows diffraction patterns of PVA, CNFs and PVA/CNFs nanocomposites characterized by XRD. CNFs exhibited a distinct peak at 2θ=22.3° corresponding to the (002) lattice planes of cellulose I (Dugan, Gough, & Eichhorn, 2010). Moreover, the existence of (101) and (10̄1) lattice planes peaks were proved by the peaks at 2θ=14.8° and 16.3°respectively, which were similar to those reported in previous studies (Sai et al., 2013). Meanwhile, PVA diffractogram presented a single strong peak characteristic to polymer crystallinity at about 2θ=20.4° (Krumova, Lopez, Benavente, Mijangos, & Perena, 2000), while there was a relative decrease with the increase of CNFs contents. These data further supported the structural data obtained from the FTIR spectra for the composite scaffolds. It was supposed that the overall crystallinity of the formed hydrogels increases with increasing CNFs content in the PVA polymer solution, because the reaction sites (–OH groups) increased, with smaller crystallite size. These observations are a proof of interaction formation between those two polymers 3.2.3 Thermal performance of the composites Changes in thermal behaviors of the polymer with fiber content should also be taken into account. Thermalgravimetric analysis presented in Fig. 4c was used to explore the effect of CNFs upon the crystallization of PVA in the composites. Generally speaking, all samples exhibit water evaporation, decomposition of side chain, and decomposition of main chain at 50–240°C, 240–400°Cand 400–550°C respectively. The pure PVA presented a higher percentage of water loss (about 85wt% observed in the range of 240–550°C) compared its respective composites. But this great water absorption tendency was decreased with increasing CNFs content. The TGA diagrams of all samples became flat over about 500°C, and the residues of PVA/CNFs50 was much higher than that of pure PVA (40% compared to 16%). It should be pointed that the thermal decomposition shifted toward higher temperature with the increase of CNF. Even though this result is similar with previous works (Castro et al., 2014; Liu, Sun, Tian, Maiti, & Ma, 2013; Yang, Yang, & Lu, 2013), our composite exhibit better thermal stability due to the crystal structure, thermal stability and better dispersion of bacterial cellulose nanofibrils. 3.2.4 Mechanical performance of the composites For tissue engineering applications, the mechanical response of the porous scaffold played a decisive role. The stress–strain behaviour of PVA and the composites hydrogels are shown in Fig. 5 a. The maximum stress of pure PVA was about 18.6MPa with elongation at break of 65.7%. The tensile stress and modulus of the composites kept on rising with increasing content of CNFs, for example, the tensile stress of PVA/CNFs50 and PVA/CNFs65 are 58.6 and 90.6MPa, respectively, which were 3.2 and 4.9 times higher than pure PVA hydrogel. The Young’s modulus of the control PVA was 48MPa, which was increased by 3 times with 50% CNFs content. It should be noted that tensile properties of crosslinked PVA/CNFs composites are higher than many traditional polymers, such as polyethylene (Young’s modulus: 800MPa; fracture stress: 15MPa), polypropylene (Young’s modulus: 1900MPa; fracture stress: 40MPa), and nylon 6 (Young’s modulus: 1800MPa; fracture stress: 70MPa). However, as compared with pure PVA, hydrogel loading with 30–80wt% CNF showed a trend of decreased elongation. That is to say, PVA behaves like an elastomer. In contrast to this, PVACNF30 possessed the highest elongation of all fabricated composites. This might be due to the optimized compatibility of CNFs and PVA, which made PVACNF30 a highly toughened and flexible material. The enhancement of mechanical properties resulted from the good adhesion of PVA/CNFs/PEG matrix as well as higher crystallinity of CNFs, which prove that CNFs can be used as an excellent reinforcement with the desired toughness in hydrogel materials. Furthermore, the remarkable flexibility was verified by bending a slice of freeze-dried PVA/CNFs65 hydrogel, which could still retained its integrity even after being bent to near 180° (Fig. 5). Overall, the mechanical performance of the hydrogels on one hand depends on the concentration and degree of hydrolysis of PVA, the aqueous phase ratio of PVA and CNFs content. On the other hand, the parameters such as the pore size, pore interconnectivity, porosity and material density are also the important influencing factors. The good mechanical properties of the hydrogel ensure its application potential in vitro or in vivo as a wound dressing or scaffold material. 3.2.5 Absorption performance of the composites PBS is the most widely used buffer in biochemistry research because it has salt balance and adjustable pH buffering. It should also be an adequate tool to preview the possible behaviour in vivo, because hydrogels were evaluated under physiological conditions of pH 7.4 and body temperature of 37°C. Both water and PBS absorption measurements were carried out and the results at equilibrium are shown in Fig. 6 a. It was observed that the two absorption of the hydrogels slightly increased with the adding of PEG. What’s more, the effect of adding a hydrophilic polymer into the PVA network on the water absorption capacity is also expected. Fig. 6b presents the swelling behaviours of the PVA/CNFs hydrogel as a function of time with the swelling degree determined gravimetrically. It can be seen that the swelling degree increased with time, and showed a sudden increase within only 10min. Then the results stabilized and reached equilibrium after about 100min for all samples. It should be pointed that the values for the swelling degree were increasing with the increase of CNFs content. The materials also showed a faster absorption rate for the CNFs content more than 50%. It is well known the swelling behaviour is strongly influenced by the presence of hydrophilic polymer. Even though the interactions of PVA and CNFs decrease the availability of hydroxyl groups, the hydroscopicity ability is still be greatly improved as cellulose are predicted to remain a lot of hydroxyl groups on its surface. The hydrogel showed up to 80% of water/PBS retention rate, and more than 10 times of water/PBS absorption, which contributed to the application as a bio-functional material, in the absorption, transmission of cell matrix as well as drugs. 3.2.6 Cytotoxicity of the composites Since biocompatibility is an important criterion to evaluate the feasibility of biomaterials in biomedical applications, we investigated the cytotoxicity of the composites to mammalian cells. Biocompatibility is often assessed by MTT assay, which is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity. The enzymes in mitochondria are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to its insoluble formazan (Fig. 7 a), which has a purple colour, so that the test could reflect the number of viable cells present. The cell viabilities cultured on glass, pure BC and porous PVA/CNFs composites were examined. And the results shown in Fig. 7b revealed that more than 90% of the 3T3 cells still kept their viability on those three kinds of substrates after 24h. It should be pointed that the porous hydrogel presented the same good biocompatibility as the Petri dish, and even better than pure BC. From the microscope images and fluorescent colour images, we can see clearly that cells could increase their growth on the hydrogel. These positive results promised that our materials can provide a good environment for cells culturing."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, porous PVA/CNFs hydrogels were successfully prepared using CNFs as the reinforcement and PVA as the matrix material after glutaraldehyde cross-linking. CNFs, with width ranging from 10 to 90nm and length of 1 to 10μm were isolated from bacterial cellulose fibres by employing acid hydrolysis. The well dispersed CNFs helped build three-dimensional interpenetrating polymer network with pore size ranging from several to dozens microns, which could satisfy the needs for biomedical scaffolds applications. CNFs presented good reinforcement effect on the PVA matrix by improving tensile stress up to 4.9 times higher with 50% CNFs loading than pure PVA hydrogel. Moreover, the thermal decomposition shifts toward higher temperature with the increase of CNFs content, meaning CNFs could also perform as an efficient reinforcing agents for thermal stability. The abundant hydroxyl groups on cellulose surface guaranteed up to 80% water/PBS retention rate and 10 times of absorption degree of the hydrogel. The materials showed a faster absorption rate for the CNFs content more than 50% as well. What’s more, the composites showed great biocompatibility, and could provide perfect growth environment for cells. All these properties ensure the application value of our materials in the fields of biotechnology and biomedicine as biomedical scaffold materials"
