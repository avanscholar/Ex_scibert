0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 using semiconducting catalysts has received much attention due to the potential of this technology, as well as the great economic and environmental interest for the production of the clean fuel H2 from water using solar energy. Fujishima and Honda demonstrated the potential of TiO2 semiconductor materials to split water into H2 and O2 [1,2]. Their work triggered the development of semiconductor photocatalysis for a wide range of environmental and energy applications [1,2]. The photocatalytic activity of conventional metal-oxide photocatalysts for the overall water splitting is known to be heavily dependent on the crystallinity and the particle size of the material, as determined by the preparation conditions [3–5]. During the past 40 years, various photocatalyst materials have been developed to split water into H2 and O2 under UV and visible light illumination. The direct splitting of water using a particulate photocatalyst would be a good way to produce clean and recyclable H2 on a large scale [6–9]. A number of photocatalysts have been proposed and achieved high quantum efficiencies under UV illumination. At present, there is a lack of suitable materials with sufficiently band gap positions for overall water splitting, and the stability necessary for practical applications. In general, efficient photocatalytic materials contain either transition-metal cations with a d0 electronic configuration (e.g., Ta5+, Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, W6+, and Mo6+) or typical metal cations with d10 electronic configuration (e.g., In3+ and Sn4+, Ga3+, Ge4+, Sb5+) as principal cation components, the empty d or sp orbitals of which form the bottom of the respective conduction bands [6–9]. The tops of the valence bands of metal oxide photocatalysts with d0- or d10-metal cations usually consist of O2p orbitals, which are located at about +3eV or higher versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) and, as such, produce a band gap too wide to absorb visible light [9]. Also, (oxy) nitrides containing d0 transition-metal cations, such as Ta3N5, TaON, and LaTiO2N, are potential photocatalytic materials to achieve water splitting [10]. The highest quantum efficiencies (QEs) have been reported for NiO-modified La/KTaO3 (QE=56%) using water under UV light [11], QE=90% has been obtained for H2 generation employing ZnS as photocatalysts in the presence of aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial reductant under UV illumination [12] and for Cr/Rh-modified GaN/ZnO (QE=2.5%), in pure water under visible light illumination [13–15]. So far, no material capable of catalyzing reaction (Eq. (1)) with visible light and a QE larger than 10% has been found [15]. Therefore, investigating the physical factors that govern the photocatalytic activity for H2 production is an important and indispensable issue in the development of highly active photocatalysts. While a number of visible-light-driven photocatalysts have been proposed as potential candidates for the overall water splitting, a satisfactory material has yet to be devised [16–19]. At a power level of 1000W/m2 the solar energy incident on the earth׳s surface by far exceeds all human energy needs [20,21]. Photovoltaic and electrochemical solar cells that convert solar energy into electricity can reach up to 55–77% efficiency [22–25] but remain uneconomical because of high fabrication costs, insufficient light absorption [26], and inefficient charge transfer [22]. In a process that mimics photosynthesis; solar energy can also be used to convert water into H2 and O2, the fuels of a H2-based energy economy (Eq. (1)) (1) H 2 O → 1 / 2 O 2 ( Δ ) + H 2 ( g ) ; Δ G = + 237 kJ / mol ( 1 . 3 eV / e , λ min = 1100 nm ) The development of a photocatalytic system that functions efficiently under visible light, representing almost half of the available solar energy on the surface of the earth, is therefore essential for the practical utilization of solar energy. In this review, we aim to summarize the research efforts having been made so far, for H2 generation from water splitting employing UV and visible light-driven photocatalysts in combination with the view on inspiring new ideas to tackle this important challenge. A number of synthetic and modification techniques for adjusting the band structure of the photocatalyst to harvest visible light and to improve the charge separation in photocatalysis are discussed. Sacrificial reagents and electron mediators for the overall water splitting are also reviewed."
1,Basic principles of photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"1.1 Basic principles of photocatalytic hydrogen generation Fig. 1a shows a schematic diagram of water splitting into H2 and O2 over photocatalysts. Photocatalysis on semiconductor particles involves three main steps: (i) absorption of photons with energies exceeding the semiconductor bandgap, leading to the generation of electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs in the semiconductor particles; (ii) charge separation followed by migration of these photogenerated carriers in the semiconductor particles; (iii) surface chemical reactions between these carriers with various compounds (e.g., H2O); electrons and holes may also recombine with each other without participating in any chemical reactions [3,7]. When a photocatalyst is used for water splitting, the energetic position of the bottom of the conduction band must be more negative than the reduction potential of water to produce H2, and that of the top of the valence band must be more positive than the oxidation potential of water to produce O2, as shown in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the photocatalyst must be stable in aqueous solutions under photoirradiation. Scaife noted in 1980 that it is intrinsically difficult to develop an oxide semiconductor photocatalyst that has both, a sufficiently negative conduction band for H2 production and a sufficiently narrow band gap (i.e.,<3.0eV) for visible light absorption because of the highly positive position of the valence band (at ca. +3.0V vs. NHE) formed by the O2p orbitals [27]. To facilitate water oxidation, the potential of the valence band edge must exceed the oxidation potential of water of +1.23V vs NHE at pH=0 (+0.82V at pH=7). Based on these parameters, a theoretical semiconductor band-gap energy of ~1.23eV is required to drive the water-splitting reaction according to Eq. (1). The smallest band gap achieved so far in a functional catalyst is 2.30eV in NiO/RuO2–Ni:InTaO4 [28,29]. Semiconductors with smaller band gaps or lower flat-band potentials require a bias voltage or external redox reagents to drive the reaction. Alternatively, two or more small band-gap semiconductors can be combined to drive water oxidation/reduction processes separately via multiphoton processes. It is well known that flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes [30,31]. These factors are rarely considered in the preparation and testing of photochemical water-splitting catalysts [32–34]."
2,Main processes of photocatalytic hydrogen generation,"1.2 Main processes of photocatalytic hydrogen generation The individual processes involved in the photocatalytic generation of H2 are illustrated in Fig. 1. They include light absorption of the semiconductor photocatalyst, generation of excited charge carriers (electrons and holes), recombination of these charge carriers, separation of the excited charge carriers, migration of electrons and holes, charge carrier trapping, and transfer of the charge carriers to water or other molecules [3,7]. All of these processes affect the final generation of H2 from the semiconductor photocatalyst system. The total amount of H2 generated is determined by the amount of excited electrons at the water/photocatalyst interface capable of reducing water. After the electron/hole pairs are created, charge recombination and separation/migration processes are two important competitive processes inside the semiconductor photocatalyst that largely affect the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction for water splitting [35]. Charge recombination reduces the number of e−/h+ pairs by emitting light or generating phonons. This includes both, surface and bulk recombination, and is classified as a deactivation process, and it is ineffective for water splitting. Efficient charge separation and fast charge carrier transport, avoiding any bulk/surface charge recombination, are thus fundamentally important for the photocatalytic H2 generation through water splitting. The reaction of photogenerated H2 and O2 to form H2O on the photocatalyst surface is normally called “surface backreaction (SBR)”. There are two main approaches to suppress the SBR: one involves the addition of sacrificial reagents into the photocatalytic reaction environment and the second creates a separation of the photoactive sites on the surface of the photocatalysts. In general, sacrificial reagents acting as electron donors or acceptors, respectively, drive the reaction into alternative pathways as they are reduced or oxidized, respectively. Taking into consideration the basic mechanism and the individual processes of photocatalytic water splitting, there are two keys for the development of a suitable high-efficiency semiconductor for the visible-light-driven photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 and/or O2: (1) a photocatalyst should have a sufficiently narrow band gap (1.23eV<Eg<3.0eV) to both harvest visible light and possess the correct band structure; and (2) photoinduced charges in the photocatalyst should be separated efficiently in order to avoid bulk/surface electron/hole recombination. In addition, both charge carriers must migrate to the photocatalyst surface for H2 and/or O2 evolution at the respective photocatalytic active sites [36]. It is important that economical, highly efficient photocatalytic systems for light-to-H2 energy conversion, in which aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents can be used to minimize the backward reaction of H2 and O2 to water on the surface of photocatalysts, can be constructed."
3,Evaluation of photocatalytic water splitting systems,"1.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic water splitting systems The rate of gas (O2 and H2) evolution with units such as μmolh−1 is used to enable a measurable comparison between different photocatalysts under similar experimental conditions. The quantum yield, as an extension from the overall quantum yield defined in a homogeneous photochemical system, becomes important and acceptable to evaluate the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. The overall quantum yield is defined for H2 and O2 formation by Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively [37]. The quantum yield is estimated to be smaller than the overall quantum yield because the number of absorbed photons is usually smaller than the number of photons available in the incident light. Activities of photochemical water-splitting catalysts are usually assessed by the rates of evolved gases [mol/h] per catalyst amount [g] under the specified irradiation conditions. From the measured evolution rate [H2], the apparent QE=2[H2]/I of the catalyst can be calculated using the known photon flux Ι [mol/s] incident on the reaction mixture. (2) Overall quantum yield ( % ) = ( ( 2 × Number of evolved H 2 molecules ) Number of incident photons × 100 ( for H 2 evolution ) ) (3) Overall quantum yield ( % ) = ( ( 4 × Number of evolvedO 2 molecules ) Number of incident photons × 100 ( for O 2 evolution ) )"
4,Photocatalysts for water splitting,
5,UV photocatalysts for water splitting,"2.1 UV photocatalysts for water splitting A wide range of semiconducting materials have been developed as photocatalysts under UV irradiation. On the basis of their electronic configuration properties, these UV-active photocatalysts can be typically classified into four groups: (1) d0 metal (Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, W6+, and Mo6+) oxide photocatalysts, (2) d10 metal (In3+, Ga3+, Ge4+, Sn4+, and Sb5+) oxide photocatalysts, (3) f0 metal (Ce4+) oxide photocatalysts, and (4) a small group of nonoxide photocatalysts. 2.1.1 TiO2 and titanates as photocatalysts for H2 production TiO2 was the first material described as a photochemical water-splitting catalyst ( Fig. 2). It crystallizes in three structure types: Rutile, Anatase, and Brookite. All modifications contain TiO6 octahedra that are interconnected via two (Rutile), three (Brookite), or four (Anatase) common edges and via shared corners, and as a result, the band gaps (3.0eV for Rutile and 3.15eV for Anatase) differ slightly [38]. In their 1971/72 papers, Fujishima and Honda described an electrochemical cell consisting of a n-type TiO2 (Rutile) anode and a Pt black cathode [1,2]. When the cell was irradiated with UV light (<415nm) from a 500W Xe lamp, O2 evolution was observed at the anode with a current flowing to the Pt counter electrode. Based on the current, a photoelectrochemical efficiency of approx. 10% was estimated. Under UV irradiation, Pt–TiO2 was found to catalyze the water reduction with iodide as the sacrificial electron donor, whereas TiO2 was observed to be the water oxidation catalyst itself in the presence of IO3 as the electron acceptor. After both catalysts were combined, H2 and O2 were formed stoichiometrically from a basic (pH=11) solution, with iodide serving as a redox shuttle. A similar system was realized with Pt–TiO2 and Pt–WO3, giving QE=4% upon irradiation with UV light [39]. Other recent efforts have sought to improve the optical response of TiO2-based catalysts via doping with C or N, and S [40–43]. Pt-modified catalysts evolve O2 from aqueous AgNO3 as the sacrificial electron acceptor and traces of H2 from aqueous methanol as the sacrificial electron donor under visible light [44]. Newly synthesized tailored anatase/brookite mixtures as well as pure brookite TiO2 nanorods were also employed for H2 production. The results achieved so far revealed that anatase/brookite mixtures and brookite nanorods exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than anatase nanoparticles and even higher efficiencies than TiO2 P25 for the photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution [45,46]. Furthermore, mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures have been studied as a route to minimize Pt loading on TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production. The results indicated that the amount of H2 evolved on 0.2wt% Pt/TiO2 calcined at 450°C is three times higher than that evolved on Pt/TiO2-P25 and twelve times higher than that evolved on Pt/TiO2 calcined at 350°C [47]. Also, a series of TiO2 and graphene sheet(GSs) composites were synthesized [48]. The photocatalytic activity of these samples was evaluated by H2 evolution from water photo-splitting under UV–vis illumination. On the other hand, when TiO2 is fused with metal oxides (SrO, PbO, etc.) metal titanates with intermediate band gaps can be obtained. Of these, SrTiO3 crystallizes in the Perovskite structure type and has a band gap of 3.2eV, slightly larger than that of TiO2. It was first employed in 1976 as a photocatalyst in a water-splitting electrochemical cell together with p-CdTe or p-GaP photocathodes [49]. An optimized version of this system was reported in 1977 by Ohashi and co-workers to be the first self-supported photoelectrochemical cell [50] with a photon to-electron conversion efficiency of 0.044–0.67%. In 1980, it was shown that NiO-modified SrTiO3 powder splits water vapor stoichiometrically under UV irradiation, while SrTiO3 alone did not show any activity [51]. The conditions of the NiO deposition had a strong effect on the catalytic activity [52]. Abe et al. used Cr/Ta-doped Pt/SrTiO3 together with Pt–WO3 in a two-particle catalyst system for overall water splitting with visible light. Cr/Ta:SrTiO3–Pt produced H2 and Pt–WO3 produced O2, with an iodide/iodate redox couple serving as the redox mediator between the two catalysts [53]. The effect of metal cocatalysts (Ru, Ir, Pd, Pt, Os, Re, Co) on the water-splitting activity of SrTiO3 was also studied [54,55]. From pure water, H2 and O2 were evolved stoichiometrically, with the activity decreasing in the order Rh>Ru>Re>Pt>Ir>Pd>Os>Co. SrTiO3 alone produced H2 but no O2. A series of layered Perovskites as photochemical water-splitting catalysts was investigated [56,57]. The NiO-modified catalyst is active for H2/O2 evolution with a QE up to 12% [56–58]. By doping with BaO and upon addition of NaOH to the catalyst suspension, this activity could be further increased to QE=50% [56], only slightly below that of the best catalyst, i.e., La-doped NaTaO3 with QE=56% [59,60]. 2.1.2 Nb- and Ta-based oxides Nb2O5 has a band gap of 3.4eV and it is not active for pure water splitting under UV irradiation. After modification with Pt as a cocatalyst, however, it can efficiently produce H2 from aqueous solutions containing methanol as an electron donor [61]. Mesoporous Nb2O5, demonstrated a photocatalytic activity 20 times higher for H2 evolution than a bulk Nb2O5 without any porosity. Intercalation of In2O3 into the mesoporous structure further increased the photoactivity of mesoporous Nb2O5 by 2.7 times [62]. Besides Nb2O5, a large number of niobates can produce H2 and O2 via water splitting upon UV irradiation. K4Nb6O17 was developed as the first example of a niobate photocatalyst that showed high and stable activity for H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution without any assistance from other materials such as the noble metals [63,64]. There are various nanocomposites of SrNb2O6, Sr2Nb2O7, and Sr5Nb4O15 that exhibited efficient photocatalytic activities for H2 and O2 production under UV irradiation [65–67]. In particular, Sr2Nb2O7 with a highly donor-doped layered perovskite structure gave quantum yields as high as 23%. The activity of Sr2Nb2O7 was further enhanced achieving quantum yields up to 32% [65]. Kudo and co-workers reported Ba5Nb4O15 with a layered perovskite structure for water splitting loaded with NiO cocatalysts and reported 17% quantum yield upon 270 nm illumination [66,67]. Partial substitution of Nb5+ with Zn2+ to obtain BaZn1/3Nb2/3O3 with a distorted perovskite structure showed favorable photocatalytic activities under UV irradiation [68,69]. The photocatalytic activity of ZnNb2O6 was negligible, whereas NiO-loaded ZnNb2O6 revealed a high photoactivity [70]. Chen and coworkers prepared ABi2Nb2O9 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskite photocatalysts for both H2 and O2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial reagents [71]. The photocatalytic performance decreased in the order of SrBi2Nb2O9>BaBi2Nb2O9>CaBi2Nb2O9. M2BiNbO7 (M=In3+,Ga3+) with pyrochlore structures were sensitive to UV irradiation and had the ability to split water [72]. Sabio et al. studied the photocatalytic water splitting activities of suspended KCa2Nb3O10 nanoscale and bulk particles and compared them using a kinetic model [73]. Their model showed that the higher activity of the nanoniobate can be rationalized by shortened transport paths for electrons and holes to the reactive surface, which reduce the lattice recombination. This effect apparently outweighs the increase in surface recombination that is to be expected for the nanomaterial, due to its increased specific surface area. 2.1.3 W-, Mo-, and V-based oxides PbWO4 incorporating a WO4 tetrahedron showed high and stable photocatalytic activity for the overall splitting of water [74,75]. H2 and O2 was produced under UV irradiation when RuO2 was loaded onto the metal oxide. The photocatalytic performance was attributed to large dispersions in both the valence and conduction bands. PbMoO4 catalyzed the H2 evolution from aqueous methanol solution. It also exhibited photocatalytic O2 evolution from aqueous AgNO3 solution under UV irradiation with its O2 evolution activity being comparable to that observed for TiO2 [76]. Na2W4O13 and Bi2W2O9, with layered structures, were active for photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution under UV irradiation[77,78]. However, Bi2MoO6 with a similar structure evolved only O2 from aqueous AgNO3 solution at a low rate [79]. A new crystal structure of VO2, with a body centered-cubic structure (bcc) and a large optical band gap of 2.7eV, surprisingly showed excellent photocatalytic activity for H2 production under UV irradiation [80]. The bcc VO2 phase exhibited a high quantum efficiency of 38.7% when synthesized as nanorods. Also, Bi2GaVO7 and Bi2YVO8 with tetragonal structures were studied. These two compounds initiated both, H2 and O2 evolution, from water under UV irradiation. This is in spite of the fact that both of them showed strong optical absorption in the visible region (λ>420nm) [81,82]. 2.1.4 d10 Metal oxide photocatalysts Various typical metal oxides (In3+, Ga3+, Ge4+, Sn4+, Sb5+) with d10 were shown to be effective photochemical water-splitting catalysts under UV irradiation. Ni-loaded Ga2O3 appears to be one of the promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting [83]. Its photocatalytic activity could be effectively improved by the addition of Ca, Cr, Zn, Sr, Ba, and Ta ions [84]. Zn ion doping remarkably improved the photocatalytic activity, with an apparent quantum yield for Ni/Zn–Ga2O3 of QE=20%. By combining with Lu2O3, the resulting Zn-doped Lu2O3/Ga2O3 proved to be a novel composite photocatalyst for stoichiometric water splitting under UV irradiation. NiO was loaded as the cocatalyst, the quantum yield at 320nm amounted to 6.81%. Ga1.14In0.86O3 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for H2 and O2 evolution [85]. In comparison, Y1.3In0.7O3, showed the highest photocatalytic activity for the overall water splitting when combined with RuO2 as a promoter [86]. 2.1.5 f0 Metal oxide photocatalysts CeO2 was reported to show a consistent activity towards O2 production in aqueous solutions containing Fe3+ and Ce4+ as electron acceptors [87]. Sr2+-doped CeO2 was an active photocatalyst for overall water splitting when RuO2 was loaded as a promoter [88]. Ce3+ supported zeolites showed higher photocatalytic activity for water splitting [89]. H2 and O2 evolution was observed. Photoirradiation of Ce3+ species generated electrons (Ce3++ hν→Ce4++e−) that were captured effectively by water molecules resulting the formation of molecular hydrogen. Yuan et al. [90] reported that BaCeO3 produced H2 and O2 from aqueous solutions containing CH3OH and AgNO3 as sacrificial reagents, respectively. 2.1.6 Nonoxide photocatalysts ZnS in SO3 2− solutions were used for H2 production under UV irradiation exhibiting 90% quantum yield at 313nm [91]. CdSe nanoribbons in Na2S/Na2SO3 solution showed photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution under both, UV and visible light illumination. The quantum efficiency for this process has been reported to be 0.09% [92]. The photocatalytic water-splitting activity of GaN was found to be strongly dependent on the crystallinity of the material and on the cocatalyst employed [93]. Modification of well-crystallized GaN with Rh2−y Cr y O3 nanoparticles as a cocatalyst for H2 evolution resulted in the stable stoichiometric decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2 under UV irradiation. RuO2 modification, on the other hand, did not bring about appreciable H2 and O2 evolution. However, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Be2+ doping of GaN converted it into a remarkably active and stable photocatalyst. Again, the presence of RuO2 as a cocatalyst was required [94]. β-Ge3N4 was another effective nitride photocatalyst to show efficient activity for splitting water into H2 and O2 when combined with RuO2 nanoparticles as reported by Domen׳s group [95,96]. The photocatalytic activity of RuO2-loaded β-Ge3N4 was strongly dependent on the reaction conditions employed. The highest activity was obtained when the reaction was carried out in 1M aqueous H2SO4 solution. Moreover, treatment of as-prepared β-Ge3N4 powder under high-pressure ammonia effectively increased the photocatalytic activity by up to 4 times. This was attributed to a decrease in the density of anion defects in the bulk and at the surface [97]. A AgBr/SiO2 catalyst showed a stable and high photocatalytic activity for H2 generation from CH3OH/H2O solution under UV irradiation. The high activity of this AgBr/SiO2 catalyst has been related to photogenerated Ag species acting as sites for H2 formation [98]. Very recently, metal-free polymeric photocatalysts have attracted much attention. Wang et al. demonstrated that graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) can be photocatalytically active for H2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation [99]. By introducing a mesoporous structure into polymeric C3N4, the efficiency of H2 production from the photochemical reduction of water is increased by one order of magnitude and the quantum efficiency (QE) is 1.4% [100,101]."
6,Visible light active photocatalysts for H2 production,"2.2 Visible light active photocatalysts for H2 production Although, more than 100 photocatalytic systems based on metal oxides have been reported to be active for the water splitting, most of them require ultraviolet (UV) light (λ<400 nm) due to the large bandgap of these semiconductor materials [16–101]. Since nearly half of the solar energy incident to the earth׳s surface lies in the visible region (400nm<λ<800nm) (see Fig. 3), it is essential to use visible light efficiently to realize H2 production on a large scale by photocatalytic water splitting. A maximum solar conversion efficiency for photocatalytic water splitting with a quantum efficiency of 100% can be calculated using the standard solar spectrum. Even if all UV light up to 400nm were utilized, the solar conversion efficiency would be only 2%, which is similar to the maximum conversion efficiencies of photosynthesis in green plants under normal environmental conditions (1–2%) [102]. However, if it was possible to utilize visible light up to 600nm, the efficiency would drastically improve to 16%; a further extension up to 800 nm would give a conversion efficiency of 32%. Therefore, achieving water splitting under visible light has been a challenging goal since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect in 1972 [1,2]. Despite many years of intensive efforts by researchers around the world, the first reproducible demonstration of water splitting under visible light irradiation was reported only a decade ago [11,39,103]. 2.2.1 Efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers While visible-light-driven photocatalysts with proper band structures are currently being developed using some modification technologies or band engineering approaches, the issue of photogenerated charge carrier separation is another key factor strongly affecting the efficiency of the photocatalytic water-splitting process [3,103]. The energy band configuration of a semiconductor plays a significant role in the absorption of light and in determining the redox potentials [3]. In order to narrow the bandgap of semiconductors to extend the absorption of light into the visible region, three approaches have been widely used: (I) modification of the VB, (II) adjustment of the CB, and (III) continuous modulation of the VB and/or CB [104] ( Fig. 4). 2.2.2 Cocatalyst loading Transition metals, especially noble metals, are widely used as effective cocatalysts for photocatalytic readtions [54,55]. The processes of charge transfer between cocatalyst and host photocatalyst are described in Fig. 5 [7]. When the noble metal is loaded onto the surface of the photocatalyst, the photogenerated electrons migrating to the surface of the host photocatalyst are entrapped by the noble metal cocatalyst, because the Fermi energy level of noble metal is always lower than that of the semiconductor photocatalyst [46,47]. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes stay at the host photocatalyst and also migrate to its surface. Subsequently, the separately localized electrons and holes will be involved as reducing and oxidizing agents, respectively. The importance of cocatalysts as follows: It improves the overall photocatalytic activity of the water splitting and it accelerates the surface chemical reaction by inhibiting the backward reaction. To date, the most widely used co-catalysts are noble metals (Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd) and metal oxides (NiO, RuO2) [105]. Compared to the investigation of photocatalysts, efforts in developing co-catalysts are quite rare. However, the design and discovery of new types of co-catalyst may play an equally important role in the development of photocatalysts themselves by finally enabling a high H2 evolution efficiency for practical applications. For example, a rhodium–chromium mixed oxide as co-catalyst led to coupled GaN:ZnO photocatalysts with 2.5% quantum efficiency for water splitting under visible light irradiation [15]. Au as a cocatalyst was improved the photocatalytic water splitting over La-doped NaTaO3 [106]. Besides noble metals and metal oxides, metal sulfides have also been explored as active cocatalysts. MoS2 as a co-catalyst has been reported to be even more effective than Pt for CdS water splitting systems [107]. 2.2.3 Z-scheme photocatalysts There are two main approaches for achieving water splitting using visible light. One approach is to apply a two-step photoexcitation mechanism between two photocatalysts (a two-step system; Fig. 6a) [11,39,53,78,108–112]. This process was inspired by natural photosynthesis in green plants and is known as the photocatalytic Z-scheme. In two-step systems, the water splitting reaction is broken up into two stages: one for H2 evolution and the other for O2 evolution; these are combined by using a shuttle redox couple (Red/Ox) in the solution. At the H2 evolution photocatalyst, the photoexcited electrons reduce water to H2 while the holes in the valence band oxidize the reductant (Red) to its oxidized form (Ox). This system lowers the energy required for photocatalysis, allowing visible light to be utilized more efficiently than in conventional water-splitting systems (Fig. 6b) [103]. Visible-light responsive oxides such as WO3 can be used as O2 photocatalysts if they can reduce the oxidant to a reductant. Indeed, different semiconductor materials can be used in the Z-scheme even if they do not satisfy all the stringent requirements for a one-step system. Z-scheme systems has ability to separate the production of H2 and O2 by employing a separator. The disadvantage of Z-scheme systems. it requires the number of photons to be twice as large as the one-step system to achieve water splitting. The other approach is a single visible-light responsive photocatalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. Because only a few semiconductor materials can absorb visible light and have a sufficiently high potential for water splitting, band engineering of semiconductors is required to find out new photocatalysts that satisfy the following requirements for water splitting upon visible light illumination [103]: exhibit a narrow band gap, be stable under photoirradiation, and have suitable conduction and valence band levels for H2 and O2 production, respectively. Various band engineering methods have been employed, including the introduction of midgap electron donor levels [113–117], hybridization of the O2p orbital with other orbitals (oxides [118,119], oxynitrides [120,121] and oxysulfides[18,122]), and the formation of solid solutions [15,123,124]. However, there are still few reliable photocatalysts for the one-step water splitting under visible light [123,124] due to the stringent requirements. An effective one-step water-splitting system that uses a solid solution photocatalyst, i.e., (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) or (Zn1+x Ge)(N2O x ), [123,124] has been described recently. Water splitting under visible light illumination was demonstrated for the first time in 2001 using a Z-scheme photocatalytic system consisting of SrTiO3 doped with Cr and Ta (denoted as SrTiO3:Cr/Ta) for H2 evolution, WO3 for O2 evolution, and an iodate/iodide (IO3 −/I−) redox couple as electron mediator ( Fig. 7) [11,39]. Prior to that, Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting had been demonstrated using a combination of Pt-loaded anatase TiO2 and bare rutile TiO2 photocatalysts in the presence of an iodate/iodide (IO3 −/I−) shuttle redox mediator [125]. Although this system operates only upon UV light irradiation (λ<400nm) due to the large band gap of the TiO2 photocatalysts, it eventually opened the way to achieve water splitting under visible light. The key was controlling the reactivity of electrons and holes with the redox mediator (IO3 −/I− anions) and the water molecules, respectively. It is quite difficult to achieve the simultaneous evolution of H2 and O2 in two-step water-splitting systems (Z-scheme) because the backward reactions of the redox mediator usually proceed readily over both photocatalysts thus suppressing the forward reactions (H2 and O2 evolutions) (Fig. 7). Highly efficient and selective O2 evolution was found to proceed over rutile TiO2 and Pt-loaded WO3 (Pt/WO3) photocatalysts in an aqueous solution containing IO3 − anions as electron acceptors (Ox) according to the following reactions (Eqs. (4)–(6)): (4) hν→eCB −+hVB + (5) IO3 −+3H2O+6eCB −→I−+6OH− (6) 2H2O+4hVB +→O2+4H+ Z-scheme systems consisting of a modified BaZrO3−BaTaO2N solid solution and a reversible donor/acceptor pair (i.e., IO3 −/I− and Fe3+/Fe2+) were constructed [126]. BaZrO3−BaTaO2N having a band gap of 1.8eV has sufficient potential to reduce and oxidize water by absorbing visible photons of up to 660nm ( Fig.8). SrTiO3 was selected as the mother structure and was doped with either vanadium (and sodium) or rhodium to introduce visible light sensitivity. By utilizing these two types of SrTiO3-based photocatalysts, the simultaneous liberation of H2 and O2 in the presence of (IO3 −)/I− as a redox mediator under irradiation with only visible light (>420nm) could be realized. QE values under irradiation with 360nm UV light and 420 and 480nm visible light were 0.33, 0.056, and 0.039%, respectively [127]. A fully integrated system of nanoscale photoelectrodes assembled from inorganic nanowires for direct solar water splitting has been described [128]. The artificial photosynthetic system comprises two semiconductor light absorbers with large surface area, an interfacial layer for charge transport, and spatially separated cocatalysts to facilitate the water reduction and oxidation. Under simulated sunlight, a 0.12% solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is achieved, which is comparable to that of natural photosynthesis. A model “Z-scheme” system with two light-absorbing materials is chosen here to demonstrate the capability of an integrated nanostructure to use sunlight to split water [129]. Earth abundant and stable semiconductors, silicon (Si) and TiO2, were chosen as the H2-generating photocathode and O2-generating photoanode, respectively ( Fig. 9). Upon illumination photoexcited electron–hole pairs are generated in Si and TiO2, which absorb different regions of the solar spectrum (Fig. 9b), the photogenerated electrons in the Si nanowires migrate to the surface and reduce protons to generate H2; meanwhile the photogenerated holes in the TiO2 nanowires oxidize water to evolve O2. The holes from Si and electrons from TiO2 recombine at the ohmic contact, completing the relay of the “Z-scheme” [129,130], similar to that of natural photosynthesis. A visible light responsive plasmonic photocatalytic composite material has been designed by rationally selecting Au nanocrystals and assembling them with TiO2-based photonic crystal substrates [131]. The design of the composite material was expected to significantly increase the Au surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) intensity and consequently boost the hot electron injection from the Au nanocrystals into the conduction band of TiO2, leading to a considerably enhanced water splitting performance of the material under visible light. The results showed that under entire solar light irradiation both, H2 and O2 were evolved at the expected stoichiometric ratio with generation rates of 27.9μmolh−1 for H2 and 13.6μmolh−1 for O2 within a 120min testing period. 2.2.4 Metal sulfides CdS is probably the best studied metal sulfide photocatalyst due to its relatively narrow band gap (2.4eV), it absorbs visible light at wavelengths of <510nm [132]. The flat-band potential of CdS (−0.87V) [30] is sufficiently high to reduce H2O, and the top of its valence band (1.5V vs NHE) is theoretically suitable to allow the oxidation of water. For 4nm CdS nanoparticles, the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers is on the order of 50ps. However, prolonged irradiation of CdS suspensions leads to photocorrosion of CdS into Cd2+ and S [31,133]. This reaction can be suppressed by the addition of reducing agents to the aqueous phase. Under visible light irradiation, Pt–CdS powder evolved H2 from aqueous EDTA solutions with QE=4%, but without Pt, the activity was reduced by a factor of 10. Prolonged irradiation (>4h) leads to the decomposition of the catalyst [134]. In 1984, Reber and co-workers published the most comprehensive study concerning photocatalysis with CdS–Pt microcrystalline powders [135]. The best catalysts evolved H2 at 2.9mmolh−1 (QE=25%) under irradiation with light of >300nm in the presence of either S2−, SO3 2−, or S2−/HPO2− as reducing agents. The activity dropped by 21% over the course of 6 days, likely because of the deactivitation of Pt due to formation of Pt–S species. Under solar irradiation, 50mL/h of H2 were produced with 0.4g of catalyst suspension equal to an energy efficiency of 2%. In a follow-up study, the activity of CdS could be increased up to 357mL/h−1 (QE=37%) of H2 in aqueous Na2S/Na2SO3 suspensions by doping CdS with 15mol% ZnS and by the addition of a Pt cocatalyst [136,137]. ZnS has a band gap of 3.66eV, which restricts light absorption to the UV (<340nm). Similar to CdS, it undergoes photochemical decomposition into its components when irradiated in the absence of sacrificial electron donors. The first report on water splitting with ZnS was published by Yanagida in 1983 [138], who synthesized ZnS from ZnSO4 or ZnCl2 and Na2S in water. With tetrahydrofuran or alcohols as the sacrificial donor, this catalyst produced H2 gas under UV irradiation. The most comprehensive study on photocatalytic reactions of ZnS and ZnS–Pt was carried out by Reber et al. [133]. Under irradiation with >300 nm light and at 60°C, ZnS–Pt catalyzed H2 evolution with quantum yields of up to 90% from aqueous solutions of sulfide and sulfite. To improve the visible light absorption of ZnS, Kudo׳s group has tested metal dopants (Cu, Ni, and Pb [139–141]). Doping can move the absorption edge to 500nm in the case of Ni2+ ions and to 550nm in the case of Pb2+ ions. Under visible light irradiation, a Ni2+-doped catalyst produced H2 from aqueous K2SO3/Na2S with QEs of up to 1.3% [140]. Cu-doped ZnS gave QE=3.7% under visible light irradiation for the molecular hydrogen formation from aqueous Na2SO3 [139]. Doping of ZnS with variable amounts of AgInS2 or CuInS2 produces a series of solid solutions that crystallize in the cubic zinc blende or hexagonal Wurtzite structure [142–145]. Visible light irradiation of the respective Pt- or Ru-derivatized catalysts produced H2 with a QE of up to 7.5% from aqueous Na2S/Ka2SO3 [143]. For the Pt-loaded Ag0.22In0.22Zn1.56S2 photocatalyst, a QE of 20% was measured at 420nm under solar irradiation conditions [145]. Na14In17Cu3S35·xH2O evolved small quantities of H2 under visible light irradiation using Na2S as the sacrificial electron donor, equal to QE=3.7% at 420nm with SO3 2−, the QE dropped to 0.37%. Under visible light irradiation, the Pt-modified catalyst showed good photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from aqueous K2SO3 solutions [146]. When supported on SiO2 and using fluorescein as a sensitizer, the catalyst produced H2 from aqueous EDTA solutions under visible light illumination [147]. Bi2S3 has a band gap of 1.28eV; it produces H2 at intermediate rates from an aqueous sulfide solution. Rates decline after 100min, probably because of disulfide formation. Platinization improves the activity by 25% [148]. 2.2.5 GaN:ZnO solid solution photocatalysts Domen et al. demonstrated water splitting into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation using a single (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) photocatalyst material with an average quantum yield of ca. 0.14% [123]. Although (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) with a ZnO concentration above 75% can absorb long-wavelengths visible light [149,150], only GaN-rich (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) with a ZnO concentration below 22% exhibited activity for overall water splitting [151]. In the first report, the origin of the visible light absorption was explained by band gap narrowing due to p–d repulsion between Zn 3d and N 2p electrons in the upper valence band [123]. A solid solution of ZnO and Ge3N4 (Zn1+x Ge)(N2O x ) was also demonstrated to be an active photocatalyst for the one-step overall water splitting under visible light irradiation [124]. 2.2.5.1 Co-catalysts for efficient H2 production over GaN:ZnO Most semiconductor photocatalysts that have been developed to date need to be loaded with suitable co-catalyst particles to promote H2 production, whereas some photocatalysts with wide bandgaps can decompose water even without co-catalyst loading. To prevent the backward reaction, transition metal oxides such as NiO x or RuO2 have mainly been used as effective co-catalysts to decompose water into H2 and O2. In NiO x co-catalysts, the Ni core functions as an electron pool that accepts photoexcited electrons from the bulk of the semiconductor and the NiO shell effectively suppresses the backward reaction, while reduction of water to H2 can occur on the surface [51]. However, the application of NiO x has been limited to thermally stable materials such as metal oxides because loading of NiO x co-catalysts requires relatively high temperatures for activation. Therefore, NiO x cocatalysts appear to be unsuitable for non-oxide photocatalysts. Rh–Cr mixed oxide (Rh2−y Cr y O3) nanoparticles as co-catalyst was investigated, which significantly enhances H2 production ( Fig. 10) [14,15]. Dispersion of Rh2−y Cr y O3 nanoparticles on (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) produced an effective catalyst for H2 evolution exhibiting a quantum efficiency of ca. 2.5%, which was the highest quantum efficiency reported for photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation [15]. The Rh2−y Cr y O3 revealed the important role of co-catalysts in achieving highly efficient water splitting over semiconductor photocatalysts. Since the report of these Rh2−y Cr y O3 co-catalysts, other researchers have reported various new co-catalyst materials that are effective for H2 evolution [152–155]. Noble metal (core)/Cr2O3 (shell) nanoparticles were developed as a cocatalyst for water splitting. [156–159] Noble metals such as Rh and Pt were deposited on the surface of the photocatalyst by conventional photodeposition. The surfaces of the noble metal particles were therefore coated with thin Cr2O3 layers, forming noble metal (core)/Cr2O3 (shell) nanoparticles. Such core/shell nanoparticles can be readily prepared by the photoreduction of Cr(VI) ions using noble metal or metal oxide loaded photocatalyst powders in the absence of air [160]. Rh-loaded GaN:ZnO photocatalysts exhibit little photocatalytic activity for water splitting due to the rapid water formation from the evolved H2 and O2 on the Rh nanoparticles. However, GaN:ZnO loaded with a Rh/Cr2O3 core/shell co-catalyst particles yielded H2 and O2 evolution from water. Electrochemical measurement on model electrodes with a core/shell structure revealed that the thin Cr2O3 layers do not interfere with the proton reduction to H2 and that the proton reduction occurred at the Cr2O3/Pt interface [161]. On the other hand, Cr2O3 layers effectively suppressed the reduction of O2 to water as illustrated in Fig. 11. The co-loading of Rh (core)/Cr2O3 (shell) and Mn3O4 nanoparticles as H2 and O2 evolution promoters, respectively, on GaN:ZnO resulted in higher photocatalytic activities as compared with Mn3O4 nanoparticles modified with either Rh/Cr2O3 or Mn3O4 [162]. A gradual size control of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-protected Rh nanoparticles was applied for the use as cocatalysts on the photocatalyst (Ga1−x Zn x )(N1−x O x ) achieving overall water splitting under visible light illumination. Moreover, it was illustrated that smaller Rh cores yielded higher activities than larger ones. These results indicate that Rh loaded on GaN:ZnO, additional modified with Cr2O3, achieve the functionality as cocatalysts to promote the water splitting by GaN:ZnO [163]. 2.2.5.2 Mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting Many studies have focused on the development of materials that are suitable for the visible-light-driven overall water splitting by addressing light absorption properties, band edge position, crystallographic quality, particle morphology, and phase purity [160]. However, it is difficult to understand what factor(s) dominate(s) the net photocatalytic activity based on the above physical properties because the photocatalytic reactions proceed through a complicated sequence of competing multistep processes. Aspects of the photocatalytic water splitting mechanism on GaN:ZnO powder modified with a Rh–Cr mixed oxide cocatalyst were investigated with respect to the effects of cocatalyst loading, light intensity, hydrogen/deuterium isotopes, and reaction temperature on the photocatalytic activity [162]. The water splitting rate with the optimally modified photocatalyst was found to be proportional to the light intensity under solar-equivalent or weaker irradiation, indicating that the accumulation of photoexcited electrons and holes was negligible. The H–D isotope effect on the overall water splitting was significantly lower than previously reported values for photocatalytic and electrochemical H2 evolution reactions. The apparent activation energy for the overall water splitting was as low as 8kJmol−1 and was unchanged by the addition of electron donors or acceptors [160]. These results reflect a shortage of photoexcited carriers available for surface redox reactions under steady light irradiation. In summary, the experimental results indicate that the balance between the rates of redox reactions on the photocatalyst surface and the carrier generation/recombination in the photocatalyst bulk determines the steady state charge concentration in the photocatalyst, that is, developing both, the photocatalyst and the cocatalyst is important. The proposed kinetic model of photocatalytic water splitting also suggests that the reaction probability of photoexcited holes for O2 evolution versus their recombination with intrinsic electrons in the photocatalyst determines the water splitting activity of GaN:ZnO. It would be natural to expect that loading both, H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, onto the same photocatalyst would improve the water splitting activity, compared to that for photocatalysts modified with either an H2 or an O2 evolution cocatalyst. It is easy to imagine that the two different cocatalysts would separately facilitate H2 and O2 evolution, thereby promoting the overall water splitting in harmony. Recently, GaN:ZnO loaded with Rh/Cr2O3 (core/shell) and Mn3O4 nanoparticles was demonstrated as H2 and O2 evolution promoters, respectively, under visible light irradiation [164]. The goal of the respective study was to generate both, H2 and O2 evolution sites, separately on the same photocatalyst surface. The preparation method developed by Domen׳s group is a stepwise deposition involving the adsorption of MnO nanoparticles followed by calcination to obtain crystallized Mn3O4 nanoparticles and a subsequent photodeposition of Rh/Cr2O3 (core/shell) nanoparticles, as shown schematically in Fig. 12a. As mentioned earlier, core/shell structured Rh/Cr2O3 nanoparticles provide active sites for H2 evolution [164]. On the other hand, photoelectrochemical analysis revealed that Mn3O4 nanoparticles on GaN:ZnO promote the photooxidation of water. Finally, overall water splitting was attempted using the as-prepared samples under visible light irradiation. As expected, the activity of GaN:ZnO modified with both Rh/Cr2O3 and Mn3O4 provided a higher activity than modification with either Rh/Cr2O3 or Mn3O4, as shown in Fig. 12b. The proposed reaction scheme of overall water splitting on GaN:ZnO modified with Rh/Cr2O3 and Mn3O4 is depicted in Fig. 12c [160]. 2.2.6 Overall water splitting employing dye-sensitized solar cells to harvest visible light The basic principle of the dye-sensitized photocatalytic H2 production from water is shown in Fig. 13. Photoexcitation of the dye adsorbed onto a semiconductor leads to the injection of electrons into the conduction band of this semiconductor. The electrons are consumed by the reduction of water to produce H2. The oxidized dye molecules are subsequently reduced and thus regenerated by accepting electrons from a suitable electron donor [165,166]. Photocatalytic H2 production systems in which ruthenium(II) complex dyes sensitize wide band gap semiconductors to visible light have been the focus of intensive research for many years. In the early 1980s, Gra¨tzel and co-workers [167,168] succeeded in decomposing water by visible light using tris(2,2׳-bipyridine)ruthenium(2+)ion (Ru(bpy)3 2+) and its amphiphilic derivatives as sensitizers. Pt/RuO2-loaded TiO2 particles proved particularly effective in these systems, acting as electron mediators and catalysts for H2 formation process. Nakahira et al. found that Pt/TiO2 sensitized with a polymer-pendant Ru(bpy)3 2+ complex was effective in H2 evolution in the presence of the sacrificial donor (EDTA) under visible-light irradiation [169]. Hirano et al. found that, when tris(bipyrimidine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpym)3 2+) was used as the visible-light sensitizer, Pt/TiO2 showed much higher efficiency for H2 production than with Ru(bpy)3 2+ [170]. Pt/TiO2/p-Ru(bpy)3 2+ anchored through phosphonate groups exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for H2 production from water than Pt/TiO2/c-Ru(bpy)3 2+ anchored through carboxylate groups [171]. Because of the more rapid regeneration of p-Ru(bpy)3 2+ as compared with c-Ru(bpy)3 2+, the phosphonate group seemed to be better than the carboxylate group as a ruthenium sensitizer linkage to the TiO2 surface in an aqueous environment. The effect of the energy gap between the I3 −/I− redox potential and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dyes on the photocatalytic activity of Ru complex dye-sensitized Pt/TiO2 in water/acetonitrile solutions was studied [172]. The influence of different ruthenium(II)bipyridyl complexes on the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate on TiO2 under visible light illumination was investigated [173,174]. When compared to Ru(bpy)2(him)2-NO3- and Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2-sensitized Pt/TiO2, Ru2(bpy)4L1-PF6-sensitized Pt/TiO2 displayed higher photocatalytic efficiency for H2 evolution. This may be related to the dynamic equilibrium between the linkage of the ground-state dye to TiO2 and the separation of the oxidized dye from TiO2. The addition of Al2O3 overlayer on Ru(bpy)3 2+-sensitized TiO2 was significantly increased the visible-light-sensitized activity for H2 production [175]. This resulted in an enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate upon visible light irradiation [176]. Reisner et al. constructed a special system consisting of [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase attached to Ru dye-sensitized TiO2, with triethanolamine (TEA) being the sacrificial electron donor [177]. This system showed a high and stable photocatalytic activity for H2 generation under visible light illumination. Also, the photocatalytic efficiency of SnO2 could be greatly improved using Ru(bpy)3 2+ sensitization [178]. The highest photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution, with a quantum yield of 2.40% upon illumination was observed for a Pt/SnO2/RuO2–Ru(bpy)3 2+–MV2+–EDTA system. The dynamics of photoexcited Ru(bpy)3 2+ intercalated into K4Nb6O17 interlayers was investigated [179]. Because of the fast and efficient electron transfer between Ru(bpy)3 2+ and K4Nb6O17, the transient bleaching of the Ru(bpy)3 2+ band showed a fast and non-exponential decay. This differed from the behavior of Ru(bpy)3 2+ in water, and thus explained the photocatalytic H2 evolution over Ru(bpy)3 2+ intercalated K4Nb6O17 from aqueous solutions containing appropriate electron donors [180]. Moreover, different layered oxide semiconductors were studied as building blocks for the visible-light induced H2 production from water using ruthenium complexes as photosensitizers [164,181–185]. Ru(bpy)3 2+-sensitized K4Nb6O17 nanoscrolls were found to exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than Ru(bpy)3 2+-sensitized lamellar K4Nb6O17 and TiO2. This was primarily explained by the high surface area of the nanoscrolls and by their excellent ability to bind Ru(bpy)3 2+ thus leading to the facile transfer of electrons from the sensitizer to the Pt catalyst islands via the single-crystalline nanoscrolls. The authors claimed that the platinized K4Nb6O17 nanoscrolls were slightly better electron transfer mediators than acid-restacked HCa2Nb3O10 nanosheets. The apparent quantum yield of visible-light photocatalytic H2 production over Pt/H4Nb6O17 nanoscrolls was reported to be 25% upon 450nm excitation, when sensitized by Ru(bpy)3 2+ complexes [182,183]. The simplest system for exploring the idea of visible light water splitting with a sensitized oxide semiconductor is a photoelectrochemical cell [181] thus avoiding possible complications through the undesired H2–O2 recombination by generating H2 in a physically separated cathode compartment. A scheme of such a cell is shown in Fig. 14with the photoanode being a mesoporous TiO2 electrode [186], like in a dye-sensitized solar cell [187]. The dye is a monolayer of sensitizer capped IrO2·nH2O particles. The [Ru(bpy)3]2+ sensitizer is modified with both phosphonate and malonate ligands in the 4-positions of the 2,2′-bipyridyl ligands in order to adsorb strongly to TiO2 and on IrO2·nH2O, respectively. The cathode is a Pt wire electrode. Because the potential of electrons in trap states below the anatase conduction band is not sufficiently negative to reduce water, a bias voltage (330mV) must be applied for water splitting to occur in this cell. In a conventional DSSC, the anode and cathode are connected by a I−/I3 − redox couple, which very rapidly regenerates the Ru(II) state of the sensitizer following electron injection into the TiO2 anode film. The observed low quantum efficiencies can be understood in terms of three problems that can, in principle, be addressed by an improved design at the molecular level [181]. The simplest of these problems is to make catalyst particles that are connected to only one sensitizer molecule, so that each sensitizer can bind both TiO2 and IrO2·nH2O. A second problem is to slow down the back electron transfer reaction by changing the distance between redox partners, and a third is to speed up the electron transfer from Ir(IV) to Ru(III). The photocurrent transients in this system (Fig. 14) show an initial spike that decays over a timescale of seconds, indicating a certain degree of polarization of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode. Because the O2 evolution reaction generates protons, the current decay may result from a local pH drop in the TiO2 film, which decreases the overpotential for water oxidation. A simple solution to this problem would be to find more effective buffers that can penetrate into the porous film. Recently, a molecular water oxidation ( Fig.15) Ru catalyst (1) (silane group, Ru(II)(bda)(4-picoline) L (H2bda=bipyridine-dicarboxylic acid; L=N-(3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl) isonicotinamide)(2)) has been synthesized and immobilized together with a molecular photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(4,4-(PO3H2)2bpy)]Br2 (2) on nanostructured TiO2 particles fixed on conducting FTO glass, forming a photoactive anode (TiO2 (1+2))[184]. By using TiO2 (1+2) as the working electrode in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), visible light driven water splitting has been successfully demonstrated in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution, with O2 and H2 bubbles evolved from the working and the counter electrode, respectively. A high photocurrent density of more than 1.7mAcm−2 has been achieved in this set-up. 2.2.7 Electron mediators for overall water splitting Water splitting using photocatalysts has a serious problem in that the obtained gas will be a mixture of H2 and O2. However, it would be possible to generate H2 separately from O2 using electron mediators. It is therefore important to find new electron mediators for the improvement of the efficiency of Z-scheme systems as well as for the development of new systems. Kudo׳s group has reported a novel Z-scheme water splitting system without an electron mediator [188]. Fujihara et al. have succeeded in the overall water splitting under UV light irradiation by the Z scheme photocatalyst system using two compartments connected by a Pt wire with bromide and iron ions acting as electron mediators [189]. The separation of molecular H2 and O2 is achieved under visible light irradiation by O2 evolution on WO3 from a filtered aqueous solution containing iron ions following H2 evolution on Pt/SrTiO3:Rh [190]. Many transition metal complexes have been reported as electron mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells [191–193]. Gra¨tzel et al. have found that the Co-complexes with imine-group ligands are comparable electron mediators to the well-known I3 −/I− redox couple in dye-sensitized solar cells or on inorganic photocatalysts [53,191,193]. In addition, Elliot et al. have reported Co-complexes to be effective mediators when combined with other ligands [192]. There are some analogies between an electron mediator of the Z-scheme photocatalyst system and that of a dye-sensitized solar cell, the required redox potential, the reversibility, and the electron transfer between the solid and the liquid phase ( Fig.16). [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(phen)3]3+/2+ redox couples were reported to act as electron mediators for the overall water splitting under visible light irradiation in Z-scheme photocatalyst systems composed of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and BiVO4 powders. [194]"
7,Main challenges and opportunities,"Significant progress has been made in recent years for the development of novel nano- and photocatalysts [3,195–199]. Nevertheless, the efficiency of photocatalysis under visible light, must be improved in order to meet engineering requirements. Furthermore, the stability and cost of these materials should also be carefully considered. It is thus a challenge of great importance to identify and design new semiconductor materials that are efficient, stable, and abundant [3]. The first property relevant to the photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is its energy band configuration, which determines the absorption of incident photons, the photoexcitation of electron-hole pairs, the migration of the charge carriers, and the redox capabilities of excited-state electrons and holes [27]. Therefore, energy band engineering is a fundamental aspect for the design and fabrication of semiconductor photocatalysts. Regarding optical absorption, direct and narrow band gap semiconductors are more likely to exhibit high absorbance and is suitable for the efficient harvesting of low energy photons. However, the recombination probability for photo-excited electron-hole pairs is rather high in these types of semiconductors, and the band-edge positions are frequently incompatible with the electrochemical potential that is necessary to trigger specific redox reactions [3]. Some renowned photocatalysts such as TiO2 and WO3 are in fact indirect band gap semiconductors, which, however, exhibit a rather abrupt absorption onset similar to direct band gap semiconductors. In order to modulate the band gap and band-edge positions in a precise manner, both, doping with different elements and solid-solution strategies have been extensively investigated and applied [200–204]. Furthermore, the inter-particle electronic coupling of semiconductor nanocrystals has been found to be effective for energy band reconstruction and for band gap narrowing [205]. The utilization efficiency of incident photons in photocatalytic semiconductor materials can be improved by methods other than energy band engineering, such as the improvement of light sensitization by the inclusion of quantum dots [206], the plasmon–exciton coupling between anchored noble metal nanoparticle co-catalysts and the host semiconductor [207], and the photon coupling in photonic semiconductor crystals [208]. Another key issue influencing the photocatalytic capability of a semiconductor is the nature of its surface/interfacial chemistry. The surface energy as well as the chemisorption properties play crucial roles in the transfer of electrons and energy between substances at the interface, in governing the selectivity, the rate and the overpotential of redox reactions on the photocatalyst surface, and in determining the susceptibility of the photocatalyst toward photo-corrosion [209]. In general, a higher surface energy should yield higher catalytic activity. Recently, much interest has been focused on research into semiconductor crystals with morphologies providing large percentages of highly reactive facets [210]. Attempts to deliberately fabricate such materials are usually challenged by the thermodynamic growth mechanisms of the crystals. In this way, it is possible to grow specific nanostructured materials with surfaces comprising nearly 100% high-energy facets with the examples including ultra-thin sheets and highly symmetric polyhedral particles. During the search for visible-light responsive photocatalysts, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of active sites on the photocatalysts and to the elucidation of the underlying reaction mechanisms, leading to significant progress in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis for water splitting, especially during the last 5 years [15,153–161]. Several promising systems, including Rh2−y Cr y O3-loaded GaN:ZnO (a one-step water splitting system) and a two-step system consisting of Pt/ZrO2/TaON and Pt/WO3 have been developed employing IO3 −/I− shuttle redox mediators, with respective apparent quantum yields of about 5.1% upon illumination at 410nm and 6.3% upon illumination at 420nm, respectively. However, research continues to pursue more active photocatalytic systems capable of harvesting more visible photons. As shown in Fig. 17, the solar energy conversion efficiency increases once the overall water splitting can be achieved upon longer wavelengths irradiation. Needless to say, this is because the number of available photons in the solar spectrum increases with increasing wavelength. To provide one-third of the projected energy needs of the human society in 2050 from solar energy, preliminary estimation by Doman et al. suggest that approximately 10,000 “solar plants” need to be built with each plant being 5km×5km in area and a solar energy conversion efficiency of 10%. The total required area for these constructions, 250,000km2, corresponds to 1% of the earth׳s desert area; 570t of H2 gas would be produced per day, assuming an integrated solar energy of AM 1.5G irradiation for a day with correction for sunlight angle. This H2 would be available for use as a “recyclable” reactant in fuel cells and as a raw material for the production of important chemicals such as methanol and so on. Of course, a technology to separate simultaneously produced H2 and O2 will also be required."
8,Conclusions and outlook,"Over 140 metal oxides, Perovskites and oxynitrides are known to catalyze the photochemical water-splitting reaction. Even though the principle activity controlling factors in the employed semiconductor-heterostructures have been identified, many aspects of the function of inorganic photocatalysts are still unclear. Metal compounds with d0 ions (Ti, Zr, Nb, and Ta) and d10 ions (Ga, In, Ge, Sn, and Sb) both exhibit activities for the overall photochemical splitting of water. Oxides are dominant, but nitrides and oxynitrides have also been shown to catalyze the reaction. Most importantly, the molecular mechanism of water reduction and oxidation on the semiconductor surface has not yet been elucidated in sufficient details. Many questions concerning the charge transfer between semiconductors and cocatalysts, and its dependence on the structural and electronic features of the interface still remain unanswered. The effects of variable material preparations and surface impurities on the catalytic activity of semiconductors have not been fully considered. These R&D areas represent significant opportunities for improving water splitting photocatalysts. The development of better photocatalysts is also going to benefit from the recent progress in nanoscience. Quantum size effects can now be used to tailor both, the electronic structure and the reactivity of nanostructures while synthetic methods can be employed for controlling the morphology of catalysts down to the nanoscale to further raise the efficiency of photochemical water splitting systems. Further efforts concerning the development of novel co-catalysts may furthermore provide additional breakthroughs in obtaining highly efficient photocatalysts. Such progress in the research is currently under way along with new synthetic directions for the photocatalyst preparation and novel system development processes."
