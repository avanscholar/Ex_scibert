0,Introduction,"The search for renewable energy sources has pointed out the use of agriculture by-products. These raw materials comprise cellulose (35–50%), hemicellulose (23–35%) and lignin (14–30%) [1,2]. Xylose units derive from hemicellulose degradation and have the potential to be used as xylooligosaccharides (XOS), which are biomolecules that act as antioxidant, antiallergic and preventive treatment against anemia and arteriosclerosis [3]. However, the pharmaceutical industry does not have an infrastructure to process the total amount of xylose that has been produced as pentose-rich liquor in 2G ethanol plants. The production of biohydrogen, a carrier with 2.75 times energy density compared to oil [4], is more suitable for large scale utilization of xylose surplus because the ethanol industry already has the required fermentation apparatus. Dark fermentation is a suitable technology for biohydrogen production. It is the denomination of all processes involving anaerobic mixed consortium (AMC), mostly acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria, without a light energy input [5]. Dark fermentation shows several advantages compared to other bioprocesses, such as a lower energy input, an improved resistance to contamination and the possibility of using waste as raw materials of carbon source [5–8]. Furthermore, volatile fatty acids (VFA) obtained as by-products from such processes could be used as a substrate to produce liquid biofuels such as ethanol and butanol [9,10]. Even though dark fermentation is still a developing technology with the potential to process waste into hydrogen with a high yielding factor, most of the reported work shows only low yielding. Thus, dark fermentation should be addressed for further studies to improve hydrogen production [11]. Among the approaches to improve hydrogen production in dark fermentation, bioaugmentation, and inoculum physicochemical pre-treatment has been reported. Bioaugmentation of a mixed consortia inoculum is a promising technique because it allows the system to profit from the metabolism of a different organism, but it requires careful isolation and selection of the microorganism which will augment the inoculum. Moreover, the ability to integrate the bacterial population must be taken into account [12]. Several studies have already been reported concerning the enhancement of H2-producing microbial communities over H2-consuming communities, using physicochemical pre-treatments on anaerobic inocula from different anaerobic bioreactors [13–17]. The main advantage of performing such pre-treatments is that it could be applied to any AMC in order to select the communities which use the same (or similar) metabolic routes [13,18]. To obtain any desired products from specific substrates, optimization of metabolism through pre-treatments of the microbial inoculum, or variations of the environmental parameters applied to mixed microbial populations are feasible [18]. Consequently, the improvement of dark fermentation to maximize the H2 production conducts the anaerobic digestion (AD) to a new paradigm in energy production. Carbohydrates are usually the most promptly consumed form of organic matter, due to their higher biodegradability, especially as monosaccharides or small polysaccharides. Waste such as bagasse, hay and straws (lignocellulosic materials) have a high content of carbohydrates (mostly cellulose and hemicellulose) which can be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides (hexoses and pentoses, respectively). They could, therefore, be a cheap and viable carbon source for the dark fermentation [19–23]. In this study, the impact on H2 production efficiency regarding pH and thermal pre-treatments over anaerobic mixed culture, at mesophilic conditions and using xylose as a substrate, will be evaluated. Mathematical modelling and bioinformatic tools were used to assess the mechanisms of anaerobic xylose conversion to hydrogen."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum pre-treatments,"2.1 Inoculum pre-treatments The initial inoculum used in this present work was an anaerobic granular sludge obtained from a UASB reactor treating poultry slaughterhouse wastewater. The concentration of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the anaerobic sludge was 32 g L−1, with a pH of 7.1. In all assays, the sludge granules were macerated to improve the external mass transfer and increase the superficial area of the bioparticles, making all pre-treatments more effective. Four different pre-treatments were performed on the inoculum: acidic, thermal, acidic-thermal, and thermal-acidic. The control experiment was inoculated with the macerated sludge and without performing any pre-treatment. The acidic pre-treatment was performed at room temperature by adding an HCl solution (1 mol L−1) until the pH of the sludge dropped down to 3.0. This sludge was maintained under these conditions for 24 h. Afterwards, the pH was raised to 6.0 with a NaOH solution (1 mol L−1). The thermal pre-treatment was done by raising the temperature with a water bath and vigorous agitation up to 90 °C and maintaining it for 20 min. After this period, the sludge was quickly cooled down to 25 °C with an ice bath. Acidic-thermal and thermal-acidic pre-treatments were a combination of acid and thermal pre-treatments described above, which were conducted as indicated in sequence, after 24 h at room temperature between the two pre-treatments. For all pre-treated and control inocula, the pH was set to 6.5 before their inoculation in the experiments. The pre-treated sludge was kept at room temperature for 24 h before further inoculation."
3,Medium,"2.2 Medium Xylose was the sole carbon source used in all assays (7.5 ± 0.6 g L−1). Nutrient supplementation was prepared as described previously [22,23], and contained NiSO4 (0.5 mg L−1), FeSO4 (2.5 mg L−1), FeCl3 (0.25 mg L−1), CoCl2 (0.04 mg L−1), CaCl2 (2.06 mg L−1), SeO2 (0.04 mg L−1), KH2PO4 (1.30 mg L−1), KHPO4 (5.36 mg L−1) and Na2HPO4 (2.76 mg L−1). Urea was used as a nitrogen source (62 mg L−1) [24,25]. pH of the medium was initially set to 6.5 using an HCl solution."
4,Experimental setup,"2.3 Experimental setup All experiments were performed in 500 mL Duran™ Flasks (total volume of 620 ± 14 mL), with a working volume of 285 ± 8 mL (medium + inoculum), and a headspace volume of 335 ± 18 mL. The headspace was replaced by nitrogen to avoid any trace of oxygen. In all assays, the initial inoculum concentration was 6.6 ± 0.3 g total volatile solids (TVS) L−1, and the initial pH was of 6.68 ± 0.13. All experiments were carried out under mesophilic conditions (30 °C) in a shaker incubator with orbital stirring at 150 RPM. Each essay lasted 168.5 ± 0.5 h. Measurements were done in technical duplicates."
5,Physicochemical analyses,"2.4 Physicochemical analyses Analyses on liquid phases were performed only at the beginning and at the end of each assay. pH and solids determinations were performed accordingly to Ref. [26], methods 4500 for pH, 2540 for TVS, and 5220 D for chemical oxygen demand (COD). Total carbohydrates concentrations were determined as previously described by Ref. [27]. The concentrations of VFA, alcohols and acetone were determined using a gas chromatograph (GC) Shimadzu™ GC2010 with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-INNOWAX column of 30 m × 0.25 mm (internal diameter) x 0.25 μm (film thickness). The temperature of the oven varied as follows: 35 °C in the time of injection; 2 °C min−1 until 38 °C; 10 °C min−1 until 75 °C; 35 °C min−1 until 120 °C (kept for 1 min); 10 °C min−1 until 170 °C (kept for 2 min). The injector temperature was 250 °C, the detector temperature was 280 °C, and the carrier gas (H2) flow rate was 1.6 mL min−1. Auxiliary make-up gas (N2) rate was 30 mL min−1. The flame gas flow was 300 mL min−1 for synthetic air and 30 mL min−1 for H2. The biogas composition (H2, CO2, N2, and H2) was determined throughout gas chromatography using a GC Shimadzu™ GC2010, according to the procedure established by Ref. [22]."
6,Kinetics,"2.5 Kinetics For some AMC it is possible to observe two successive growth patterns. This phenomenon could be explained by secondary microbial species capable of growing during the stationary phase of the main microbial population, probably by consuming their metabolic products. The double Boltzmann sigmoidal function (Equation (1)) was applied to make the results of the time profiles fit for each of the biogas constituents (H2, CO2, and CH4). 1 C ( t ) = m ⋅ ( p 1 + 10 ( l 1 − t ) · h 1 + 1 − p 1 + 10 ( l 2 − t ) · h 2 ) Where C ( t ) is the volumetric production of a chosen biogas constituent (L) at a given elapsed time t (h); m is the total volumetric production (L); p is a proportional constant; l 1 and l 2 are the time for which the production, for the first and second exponential phases respectively, reaches their maximum rate (h); and h 1 and h 2 are fit parameters related to the slope of both exponential phases (L h−1). The maximum rate for the first and second exponential phases was obtained through the derivative of Equation (1) at time l 1 and l 2 , respectively (Equation (2)), where i could be replaced by 1 (maximum rate for the first exponential phase, r m 1 , mL h−1) or 2 (maximum rate for the second exponential phase, r m 2 , mL h−1). 2 r m i = d C ( l i ) d t Since the starting and ending times of the exponential phases have to be considered for discussion, their calculation was performed for both first and second exponential phases, as depicted by Equations (3)–(6): 3 t s 1 = l 1 − C ( l 1 ) r m 1 .4 t E 1 = l 1 + m ⋅ p − C ( l 1 ) r m 1 5 t s 2 = l 2 + m ⋅ p − C ( l 2 ) r m 2 6 t E 2 = l 2 + m − C ( l 2 ) r m 2 Where t s 1 and t s 2 are the starting times, and t E 1 and t E 2 are the ending times, for the first and second exponential phases, respectively. All data processing was performed using the fitting tool from the software Microcal Origin © version 6.1."
7,Next-generation sequencing (NGS),"2.6 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) Bacterial populations were determined for each experiment by sequencing 16S rRNA genes from samples taken at the end of each process. Total genomic DNA was extracted and purified using Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16S rRNA genes were amplified using a primer set targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (563F and 802R) [28]. The amplicons were sequenced at the Instituto de Agrobiotecnologia Rosario (INDEAR) (Rosario, Argentina) using a 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche). Sequences were processed through the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Pyrosequencing Pipeline [28–30]. Sequences were first trimmed to remove adaptors, barcodes, primers, and sequences containing ambiguous ‘N’ or shorter than 100 bp (Pipeline Initial Process). Chimera sequences were removed using the DECIPHER program [31]. Sequences were then submitted to the Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) [32] and were annotated for taxonomic analysis, using all database sources (LSU, SSU, M5RNA, RDP, Greengenes, ITS). RDP database was used as an annotation source for 16S rRNA readings to analyze the bacterial populations by using an e-value cutoff of 10−5, a minimum identity cutoff of 50% [30], and a minimum alignment length cutoff of 15 bp. Results were presented as a normalized relative abundance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU), which were defined using Ward's clustering linkage method [32]. OTU had to show at least 97% of identity to be considered to belong at a specific clade. Unidentified clusters, clusters with less than ten representative sequences, and clusters of domains other than Bacteria were trimmed from the analysis. All the sequences are available at MG-RAST, in the ADAPT project (http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?project=9961), under accession numbers 4571349.3 (control without pre-treatment, DACBR01), 4571348.3 (acidic pre-treatment, DACBR02), 4571347.3 (thermal pre-treatment, DACBR03), 4571351.3 (acidic-thermal pre-treatment, DACBR04) and 4571350.3 (thermal-acidic pre-treatment, DACBR05)."
8,Gas production balance,"2.7 Gas production balance Hydrogen and carbon dioxide production for each process were estimated by mass balance considering the metabolic pathways depicted in Fig. 1 and described in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows acidogenic, methanogenic and solventogenic probable pathways, based on both VFA and alcohol production [33,34]. Table 1 relates each biochemical process shown in Fig. 1 with its chemical equation and with a standard free Gibbs' energy. The parameter Σ X corresponds to the predicted amount of X (where X could be H2 or CO2), obtained by the mass balance considering the measure of xylose, VFA and alcohol amount at the beginning and end of each experiment. The parameter Γ X is the measured amount of X in the gas phase (obtained by the parameter m from Equation (1)) plus its soluble fraction (estimated by Henry's law [35]). Parameter ψ X is the ratio between Σ X and Γ X and indicates how close the measured production of each biogas constituent was to the metabolic pathway described in Fig. 1 and Table 1."
9,Results and discussion,
10,"Xylose, VFA, and H2 metabolisms","3.1 Xylose, VFA, and H2 metabolisms Table 2 shows the initial and final physicochemical characteristics of the liquid phase for each experiment conducted. No acetone, methanol nor n-valerate was detected in all studied conditions. Isovalerate was only detected in the thermal pre-treatment assay with an initial concentration of 76 mg L−1 decreasing down to a final value of 10 mg L−1, indicating a partial consumption during the process. Isobutyrate, which was also detected in this assay with an initial concentration of 23 mg L−1, was consumed during the process. A decrease in xylose concentration was observed in each assay, indicating that in all studied conditions, AMC was able to convert xylose into VFA with high efficiency (higher than 98%). The organic matter concentration (measured in COD equivalent) showed a decrease in the overall concentration ranging from 15.2% (for the thermal-acidic pre-treatment) up to 42.6% (for the thermal pre-treatment). Such results indicate that not only was xylose used as a substrate in each studied condition, but the more significant part of the organic matter remained in the liquid phase as products of xylose metabolism. As shown in Table 2, VFAs were detected in all initial inocula. The high amount of acetate observed in the control assay could be attributed to the maceration process of the sludge granules performed before inoculation, which probably led to the release of organic matter kept within the granule structure. The initial amount of VFAs was higher for all pre-treatments, as compared to the control, suggesting that the pre-treatments generated initial metabolic stress on the original inoculum. In all assays, acetate was entirely consumed. The control experiment was the only assay showing a significant production of propionate, which could indicate a possible instability of the anaerobic process. Finally, ethanol was produced with thermal and acidic-thermal pre-treatments, indicating that this solventogenic metabolic pathway was active at least in these conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 , cumulative gas production profiles showed different patterns. Although each gas production could fit into a simple sigmoidal model (which represents all phases of microbial growth), patterns of both CO2 and H2 production for the acidic and thermal-acidic pre-treatments indicated that their production was performed in two successive steps. In those experiments, a shift in the metabolism occurred after the stationary phase of the first sigmoidal pattern. In the control assay, the same pattern was observed for CO2 production. However, the first and second exponential phases coincided with the exponential phases of methane and H2 production, respectively, suggesting a shift in the metabolism of the xylose towards H2 rather than methane production. This metabolic change could be related to a drop of pH observed when comparing the initial and final pH values, as can be observed in Table 2. Moreover, production and accumulation of propionic acid as shown in Table 2 corroborates this probable metabolic detour. Such accumulation possibly brought instability to the process, probably leading to a shutdown of the methanogenic microbial communities, thus disabling H2 consumption from that metabolic pathway. This statement combined with the presence of H2-producing microorganisms in the control assay reinforces the hypothesis that the present microbial communities needed to produce H2. H2 production, pH drop and propionic acid accumulation are factors which have already been shown to inhibit methanogenic processes [16,24,33,36]. Methane was not detected in any experiment except for the control, indicating that pre-treatments were effective in inhibit methanogenic pathways. The double Boltzmann sigmoidal model parameters corresponding to gas time profiles presented in Fig. 2, as well as an analysis of the exponential phases observed in each assay are depicted in Table 3 . As shown in Fig. 2 and detailed in Table 3, AMC was able to metabolize xylose and produce H2 in all experiments, with the highest yield obtained for the acidic pre-treatment ( Y H 2 / X y l o s e = 1.57). In addition to that, this pre-treatment also showed the shortest lag phase time for both H2 and CO2 production, and the highest maximum production rate for H2 production, in both exponential phases. This pre-treatment showed a higher biological activity as compared to all other assays, including control, except for the methanogenic activity, which was suppressed. Except for the thermal-acidic one, all pre-treatments showed a yielding factor for converting xylose into H2 greater than in the control experiment. Table 4 compares the higher hydrogen yielding factor found in this study with the optimum yielding factor found by some recent studies on hydrogen production through dark fermentation of xylose. It is important to notice that the process leads to a yielding factor comparable with these other approaches, but with a lower temperature than any other result found in recent references. Dark fermentation temperature could be an issue if the process is meant to produce an energy carrier since it directly affects the energy balance. Therefore, it is desirable that temperature remains the nearest to the ambient temperature as possible."
11,Xylose metabolism model,"3.2 Xylose metabolism model Based on the results observed for xylose consumption and conversion into biogas, VFA and alcohols, a hypothetical metabolic model was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Stoichiometry and standard Gibbs' free energy for each metabolic pathway considered in Fig. 1 are compiled in Table 1, in order to infer the thermodynamic feasibility of each pathway. Although no methanol has been detected in any assay, this substance could theoretically be produced by a solventogenic process and promptly degraded afterwards. Those metabolic pathways remained in the model as hypothetical, since methanol solventogenesis is a thermodynamically viable pathway. The total consumption of methanol would then be carried out anaerobically, even if this degradation pathway presents a low positive standard Gibbs' free energy (Table 1). Considering H2's very low solubility in water, its limited availability in the liquid phase can displace the equilibrium towards methanol consumption, although concentrations of biologically produced H2 could be up to 70 times greater than its solubility [37]. Some studies have previously reported both solventogenic [38] and anaerobic degradation [39,40] pathways for methanol. Based on this proposed hypothetical model, a mass balance was performed for each experiment, considering all proposed metabolic pathways (Table 5 for organic matter, Table 6 for H2 and Table 7 for CO2). Since this model is hypothetical and simplified, it was expected that the mass balance did not fit properly with this proposed model. Initial and final concentrations of xylose and all metabolites described in the model were set as fixed parameters. The model was calibrated with the experimental values obtained for all metabolites (Table 2), except for H2 and CO2 production. The amounts of H2 and CO2 produced and consumed were calculated. Thus, the model provided a theoretical value for the production of these gases, through the mass balance of all other metabolites, without any input of experimental data. Considering that the model is simplified and that the metabolic pathways were proposed to cover only the main routes, some parameters were established to compare the predicted production and consumption with the measured values for both H2 and CO2, as respectively shown in Tables 6 and 7. The parameter ψ X could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the metabolic model adopted to explain H2 and CO2 production. Best results were obtained for the acidic-thermal pre-treatment, for which the model fitted for 41.7% of H2 production and 100% of CO2 production. On the contrary, the lowest results were obtained for the thermal-acidic pre-treatment, for which the model only fitted for 69.9% of CO2 production and 12.7% of H2 production. For all the conditions tested, except for CO2 production with the acidic-thermal pre-treatment, the predicted mass balances values were higher than those obtained experimentally. Such observations indicate that other metabolic routes exist for H2 and CO2 consumption but were not considered in our model. Notably, the low values of ψ H 2 indicate that many unconsidered metabolic pathways were used for H2 consumption. The accuracy of our proposed model has thus to be improved, notably by evaluating such processes. Identifying these other H2 consumption pathways will constitute an important step to improve the production of H2 from xylose, with a possibility of inhibiting them. The fact that ψ H 2 could also be related to the efficiency of H2 production is also to be taken into consideration. Acetate was produced in all cases mainly through acidogenesis of xylose (pathway 3) and converted to ethanol (pathway 5) in all conditions, except for control for which it was consumed through the methanogenic route (pathway 9). Since no methanol was detected, the hypothetical solventogenesis and anaerobic degradation of methanol (pathways 6 and 7, respectively) had likely no or a minor role in all pre-treatments. H2 consumption and production mainly occurred in the metabolism of ethanol, through the solventogenic (pathway 5) and anaerobic degradation (pathway 8) routes. Production of ethanol through fermentation of xylose (pathway 4) was also observed but was minor as compared to the solventogenesis of acetate. Furthermore, this metabolic route does not require nor produce H2. Butyrate acidogenesis (pathway 1) was also an essential metabolic route for H2 production, even if anaerobic degradation of ethanol (pathway 8) was the most evident pathway, especially for the acidic pre-treatment. It is noticeable that no H2 was produced through acidogenesis of xylose (pathway 3) for the acidic-thermal pre-treatment. Finally, although many works previously pointed out homoacetogenesis (pathway 11) as a significant H2 consuming route [41–44], our results showed that this pathway only had a secondary role as compared to ethanol solventogenesis (pathway 5)."
12,Microbial communities,"3.3 Microbial communities As shown in Fig. 3 , the most abundant OTU found in all assays was associated to the bacterial genus Clostridium (Fig. 3A). Other OTUs of relative abundance were identified in all experiments and were associated with various other bacterial genera (Fig. 3B). Clostridium's abundance decreased in all pre-treated inoculum, as compared to the control, especially for the thermal pre-treatment. Members of the genus Clostridium are classically related with acidogenic and solventogenic processes and could act as an H2 producer or consumer. H2 production through butyrate synthesis, which could be associated with this genus [5,45], was observed in all assays. Decreases in Clostridium related OTUs in our pre-treated inoculum, and especially for the thermal and acidic-thermal pre-treatments, could be related to the enhanced H2 production and the versatility of some Clostridium species regarding H2 consumption through solventogenic and homoacetogenic metabolism [17,42]. As shown in Fig. 4 , changes in microbial communities lead to metabolic switches. Molar H2 consumption and production (Table 6) can be expressed, for each metabolic pathway described in Fig. 1, as ratios representing either a xylose-specific H2 production (XHP, mol of xylose consumed to produce this H2), or a xylose-specific H2 consumption (XHC, mol of xylose consumed to consume this H2) (Fig. 4A). Related variations in the microbial communities, at the genus level, are presented in Fig. 4B. XHP was higher in metabolic pathway 8 (anaerobic degradation of ethanol) for all pre-treatments and on the contrary in metabolic pathway 3 (acetate acidogenesis) for the control, strengthening the hypothesis that those pathways were the main ones used for H2 production. XHC was higher in metabolic pathway 5 (ethanol solventogenesis) for all experiments performed, confirming that this pathway was the main metabolic route for H2 consumption. Microbial communities evolved differently for each pre-treatment, as compared to the control, as shown in Fig. 4B. However, only seven among them were present in all samples: Clostridium, Fibrobacter, Lachnospira, Caldicellulosiruptor, Bacillus, Herpetosiphon and Candidatus Cloacamonas. An acidic pre-treatment seemed to stimulate the growth of the two genera Truepera and Kurthia. A thermal pre-treatment seemed to stimulate the growth of genera Sarcina, Tissierella and Eubacterium. The two pre-treatments performed sequentially (acidic-thermal and thermal-acidic) were more selective, generating less diversity. The acidic-thermal pre-treatment stimulated the growth of Pseudomonas, which was detected neither in the other pre-treatments nor control. The thermal-acidic pre-treatment seemed to stimulate the growth of the two genera Lysinibacilus and Bradyrhizobium. Among those detected bacterial genera, H2 production enzymes have already been described in Eubacterium and Pseudomonas [46], and the genus Truepera has previously been related to pentoses degradation [46]. Eight percent of the OTUs obtained in the control assay, 39% of the OTUs obtained in the acidic pre-treatment, 24% of the OTUs obtained in the thermal pre-treatment, 35% of the OTUs obtained in the acidic-thermal pre-treatment, and 32% of the OTUs obtained in the thermal-acidic pre-treatment could not be associated with any bacterial genus. Among them, a substantial fraction could be associated to the family Peptostreptococcaceae, especially for the thermal-acidic pre-treatment (19%), the acidic pre-treatment (13%), the acidic-thermal pre-treatment (10%), and the thermal pre-treatment (8%), as compared to the control (0.4%). Such results indicate that members of the family Peptostreptococcaceae should have played a significant role in all pre-treated inoculum, possibly in relation with H2 production, since at least one species of this family is a well-known H2 producer [47]."
13,Conclusion,"All pre-treatments studied here were related to switches in the metabolic pathways of xylose anaerobic degradation. The acidic pre-treatment showed the best performances in H2 production, with the highest H2/xylose yielding factor (1.57 mol H2 mol xylose−1). The production rate in the first exponential growth phase was the fastest (253 mL h−1), and the lag phase was the shortest (11.6 h). The improvement in H2 production for this pre-treatment seems related to the enhanced growth of members of the family Peptostreptococcaceae, and the genera Truepera and Kurthia."
