0,Introduction,"Metal peroxo complexes have been extensively studied over the last decades due to their remarkable catalytic properties in various oxidation reactions [1–7]. A special attention is given to the oxidation reactions in the bi-phasic liquid-liquid systems utilizing hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Hydrogen peroxide is considered to be one of the most environmentally friendly oxidizing reagents, which makes such processes attractive, especially for the fine chemical industry. Bi-phasic oxidation of organic compounds can be catalyzed by polyoxoperoxocomplexes of tungsten or molybdenum in a combination with phase transfer agents. Further development of such bi-functional catalysts however is hindered by a lack of knowledge about the catalysts structure and the reaction mechanisms. Previously reported studies show that tungsten peroxo complexes PWxOyz- formed in-situ in the mixtures containing H2O2 – H3PO4 – Na2WO4 [8–12] and H3PW12O40 – H2O2 [11,13], can be used for the oxidation of various organic substrates, i.e. alkenes, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons [14–16]. It was shown by IR and 31P NMR spectroscopy [12,13] that in both cases, an anion with PW4O24 3- structure is formed under the reaction conditions. This peroxopolyoxo-anion possesses high stability in water and organic media. For the bi-phasic liquid-liquid systems when the substrate and an oxidizing agent are present in different phases, peroxopolyoxo-anion complexes can be coupled with a cation with phase-transfer properties. Thus, quaternary ammonium salts of chlorine, fluorine, bromine or hydrosulphate containing C4–C18 alkyl groups or cations of mixed type with alkyl- and aryl- substituents are used as phase-transfer catalysts. Ishii et al. showed [13,17] that oxidation of various organic substrates with 35% aqueous H2O2 proceeds smoothly in the presence of [π-C5H5N+(CH2)15CH3]3(PW12O40)3- catalyst. It was suggested that heteropoly-anion retains its oxo-metallate structure during the reaction [18]. On the other hand, other studies suggest that in spite of different catalyst precursors, the reaction proceeds via formation of {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3- species [19–23]. Later it was demonstrated that in-situ preparation of the catalyst yields a mixture of catalytically active and inactive tungsten peroxopolyoxo complexes. 31P and 183W NMR spectroscopy data suggest that in the H2[PW12O40]∙yH2O / H2O2 system with [H2O2] / [W] ≈ 7 / 1 a mixture of [PWOq]δ-, [PW2Op]α-, [PW3On]β-, [PW4Om]γ- complex anions is obtained [24]. Thus, the main proposal for the structure of such catalytic complexes suggests the formation of poly-nuclear complexes in the solution and more specifically, in binuclear (W2) or tetranuclear (W4) configuration depending on the reaction conditions [8–10,14,15,18,20,24–27]. For these reactions, complexes of higher nuclearity such as [PW12O40]3- (Keggin), [P2W18O62]6- (Dawson), [NaP5W30O110]6- (Preyssler) are not required. It was clearly shown in [28] by the example of the catalytic oxidation of methylphenylsulphide and cyclooctene with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of complexes containing the [PW12O40]3-,[P2W18O62]6-, [NaP5W30O110]6- anions or {PO4[WO(O2)2]}4 3- Venturello’s anion combined with the diallyl carbinol benzyl ammonium cation. The catalyst based on Venturello’s ion was more active, sulfide oxidation with the 98% conversion occurs in 30 minutes, whereas in case of the complexes based on Dawson and Preyssler oxometallates it takes 24 hours to reach the 74 and 77% conversion, respectively. Many different methods have been proposed to synthesize tungsten complexes with varied nuclearity. However, the main obstacles for the industrial application of Venturello-Ishii catalytic systems include the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons as solvents [29] and the use of phase-transfer catalysts with haloid-ions [23]. Unlike the in-situ preparation (when all the catalyst precursors are added straight into the reaction mixture containing the substrate and oxidant), preliminary catalyst preparation and its following use for the liquid-phase oxidation allows, first, the synthesis of the catalytic complex containing only the most active {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3-anion, and second, elimination of the presence of haloid-ions brought in with the quaternary ammonium salts. Considering this, it was shown in our works [20,30] that for the system (H3PW12O40 – H2O2) a result of their interaction is a decrease in nuclearity of the complexes formed relative to the precursor, H3PW12O40. It is established that the symmetry of oxygen surrounding of tungsten changes with the distances W-W kept intact. It is revealed that after isolation of the [Bun 4N]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} complex the [W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2]2- dimeric anion stays in the solution. A comprehensive study of the peroxo complex isolated in crystalline form from the solution using EXAFS, Raman and IR-spectroscopy have demonstrated that the complex anion is a tetramer of tungsten ions interconnected by PO4-group, and this structure remains unchanged as the complex is dissolved in an organic solution. In our next work [31] we have shown using the example of three synthesized complexes that after the organic cation replacing the structure of {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3- anion changes. The most pronounced structural changes were observed for [C5H5NCet]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4}, [Et2Bn2N]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} as compared to a benchmark [Bu n 4N]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} catalyst. However, there is no other data on the influence of the nature of quaternary ammonium cations over the structure of tetrakis-(diperoxotungsten)phosphate anion have been reported literature so far. In this work we elucidate the effect of of the quaternary ammonium cations (Q+) structure on the structure and catalytic properties of the Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} complexes. We first show that well-defined tetra-nuclear Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} complexes can be prepared with different cations using different preparation procedures. The structural properties of these complexes are further assessed using a number of spectroscopy tools including IR, Raman an EXAFS spectroscopy. Spectroscopy data combined with computational results reveal a pronounced effect of the cation on the structure of the anionic peroxo complexes. We then show the influence of these fine structural changes on the catalytic performance of peroxo complexes in the bi-phasic oxidation reaction of various organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals A heteropoly acid H3PW12O40, (Panreac, hydrate, water content was determined gravimetrically); n-Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride [(n-C12H25)Me3N]Cl (98%), Benzyltributylammonium chloride [Bn(Bu n )3N]Cl (98%) and Hexadecylpyridinium chloride [C5H5N(CH2)15CH3]Cl (96%) were obtained from Acros Organics; n-Hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride [(n-C16H33)Me3N]Cl (≥98%), Dimethyldi-n-octadecylammonium chloride [(n-C18H39)2Me2N]Cl (≥97%), n-Tetrabutylammonium chloride [(n-C4H9)4N]Cl (≥97%), n-Tetrahexylammonium chloride [(n-Hex)4N]Cl (96%) and Methyltri-n-octylammonium chloride [n-C8H17)3NMe]Cl (≥97%) (Sigma-Aldrich); n-Octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride [(n-C18H39)Me3N]Cl (95%) and Benzyltri-n-propylammonium chloride [C6H5CH2N(C3H8)3]Cl (96%) (Alfa Aesar). For the catalytic oxidation runs cyclooctene (95%), methyl oleate (98%) (Acros organic) and N-phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid hydrate (97%, Aldrich) were used without further purification. Reference samples for gas chromatography analysis including epoxides of cyclooctene and methyl oleate were obtained from Acros organics. Polyethylene UHMW (Alfa Aesar), 150 μm particle size, molecular weight 3-6 mln was used for EXAFS sample preparation. Hydrogen peroxide 30-33% water solution and organic solvents including dichloromethane, c.p.; diethyl ether, p.a.; ethyl acetate, p.a. were purchased from Reakhim."
3,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterization To obtain a target Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} tungsten complex with various cations (the structural formulas of the quaternary ammonium cations are shown in Fig. 1 ) we modified a method described in [20] based on the reactions (1) and (2): (1) H3[PW12O40] + H2O2 →H3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} + H2[W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2] (2) 3Q++ {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3-→Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} 0.53 g of H3PW12O40 (0.185 mmol) was placed into a 20 ml flask and dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water to obtain a clear transparent solution. Then 30–33% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (386 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred on magnetic shaker for 30 min. This transparent solution containing a mixture of peroxo complexes H3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} and H2[W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2] (eq. 1) was then reacted with quaternary ammonium salts. Due to difference in solubility of the final peroxo complexes, different approaches (Methods I and II) were taken to obtain the final peroxo complexes. For the catalysts with cations 1-5 (Method I): a solution of quaternary ammonium salt (0.552 mmol) in 5 ml of dichloromethane CH2Cl2 was added to the obtained solution. The resulting bi-phasic reaction mixture was then stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then the organic phase was isolated, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator at 40 °C and 0.02 MPa vacuum. For the catalysts with cations 6-10 (Method II): a solution of quaternary ammonium salt (0.552 mmol) in 1-2 ml of H2O was added to the stirred obtained solution. Immediately, a deposition of white precipitate was observed. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then the obtained crystal precipitate was filtered through a fritted glass filter and rinsed 3 times with a small amount of cold (10 °C) water and diethyl ether. The obtained white solids were dried in desiccator over solid NaOH. The elemental composition of the catalytic complexes was measured using scanning electron microscope HITACHI SEM TM3000 equipped with EDX Quantax70 analyzer. For SEM EDX analysis, the catalyst samples were dissolved in DCM and then the solution was placed on alumina foil. After evaporating the solvent at room temperature, a thin uniform film of the catalyst formed on alumina surface was used for the analysis. X-ray tungsten L3-edge absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained at the EXAFS station of Synchrotron Radiation Center SB RAS (Novosibirsk, Russia) following a standard procedure described elsewhere [32]. The electron energy in a storage ring (VEPP-3) was 2 GeV with a beam current being 80 mА. The spectrometer was equipped with a cut-off two-crystal monochromator Si(111) and the proportional chambers as detectors. For all samples the oscillation part of EXAFS-spectra (χ(k)) was analyzed as k 2χ(k) in wave number range k = 4.0–14 Å-1. VIPER software package was used to isolate the oscillation part of absorption coefficient and spectra simulation for structure analysis [33]. Quantum chemistry parameters for simulation were computed with FEFF-7 software [34]. For XAS experiments, the solid catalyst samples were mixed with polypropylene powder and pressed to form homogeneous self-supporting pellets. The dilution of the catalyst was estimated to provide tungsten content of c.a. 20 mg/cm2. For the liquid phase measurements, a home build transmission cell equipped with polyethylene windows was used. The concentration of tungsten in the solution was 0.1 M. IR measurements of the catalyst samples were performed using IR-Fourier IRAffinity-1 Shimadzu spectrometer. Spectra were collected in 400–4000 сm-1 with a resolution of 2 cm-1. Prior to the measurements the samples were mixed with dry KBr and pressed to form self-supporting homogeneous pellets. Raman measurements were carried out using RFS 100/S Bruker spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 1 cm-1. Nd-YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm, emission power 400 mWt) was used for the excitation. IR spectra were recoded with MB-102 Bomem spectrometer with a resolution of 1–2 cm-1."
4,Catalytic tests,"2.3 Catalytic tests In a typical catalytic run, an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (30–33%) was placed into the 20 ml glass thermostated reactor with a magnetic stirrer. Then the catalyst was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. To initiate the reaction, the substrate was carefully added without stirring and then both stirring and heating of the reactor were activated simultaneously. Cyclooctene and methyl oleate epoxidation. In a typical catalytic run, an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (30–33%, 18 mmol) was placed into the 20 ml glass thermostated reactor with a magnetic stirrer. Then the catalyst (9 μmol) was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. To initiate the reaction, the substrate (9 mmol for [Sub]/[Cat] ratio of 1000) was carefully added without stirring and then both stirring and heating of the reactor were activated simultaneously. The agitation rate was 1200 rpm. The samples were taken during the reaction at regular intervals without interruption of the stirring using an automatic micropipette. Bi-phasic samples were then diluted with ethyl acetate (190 μl) and analyzed using gas chromatography (GC). The composition of the reaction mixtures was analyzed using Khromos GKh-1000 GC. The instrument is equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The standard detection limits of the detectors for heptane were 2.2 × 10-12 g/s and 3.4 × 10-9 g/ml correspondingly. For the analysis of cyclooctene epoxidation reaction products SGE ID-BPX5 (Agilent Technologies 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm) was used. GC conditions: Tcolumn = const =150 °C; Tdetector =250 °C; Tinjector =250 °C; carrier gas – H2, split flow 20 ml/min, p = 100 kPa. Retention time found for cyclooctene and cyclooctene epoxide was 0.82 min and 1.39 min respectively. For methyl oleate (MO) epoxidation runs, DB-Wax column (Agilent Technologies, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used. GC conditions: Tcolumn =200 °C (5 min dwell) followed by heating with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min up to 250 °C; Tdetector =280 °C; Tinjector =330 °C; carrier gas – He, split flow 40 ml/min, p = 100 kPa. Retention time: methyl oleate – 6.6 min, methyl oleate epoxide – 14.9 min. The selectivity and therefore the carbon balance in all catalytic runs were close to 100 %. The reaction conversion and the product yield were calculated based on GC and HPLC analyses. Oxidation of N-phosphonomethyliminodiacetic acid (PMIDA). A mixture of a catalyst stock solution in toluene (10 ml, 10-3 M) and 0.10 ml of 32% aqueous hydrogen peroxide was added into the glass thermostated reactor and stirred with a magnetic stirred at 1000 rpm. The reactor was heated up to 70 °C. After 5 min at 70 °C the substrate aqueous solution (10 ml of 5 × 10−2 M PMIDAA) was added. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures was done using Varian ProStar instrument equipped with a ProStar 335 Photodiode Array Detector with a variable wavelength ranging from 190 to 900 nm; ProStar 210 and PrepStar 218 Solvent Delivery pumps; ProStar410 auto sampler, Varian 500-LC thermostate, and a Column Volve Module for the column temperature control. For the analysis, HPLC column PRP-X100 (Hamilton Company USA, 5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm) thermostated at 35 °C was used, 0.0137 M KH2PO4 (рH 1.9) used as a mobile phase at a fixed flow rate of 0.5 mL × min−1. Chromatograms were recorded at the detector wavelength of 193 nm. Residence time was as follows: for H2O2– 3.48 min; for PMIDAA – 12.64 min; for PMIDAA N-oxide – 18.25 min. The concentration of the components was determined using an external standard."
5,Computational methods,"2.4 Computational methods Ab initio calculations. Non-empirical quantum chemical calculation of the equilibrium geometry and vibrational spectra was performed using Gaussian-98 [35] in the density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP approximation. A standard set of basic functions 6–31 G (d,p) was applied. The original program developed in the laboratory of quantum chemistry of Boreskov Institute of Catalysis was used for the frequencies assignment [36]."

7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization To elucidate the effect of quaternary ammonium cation (QAC) on the structure and the reaction performance of the bi-functional peroxo complex catalysts, we synthesized a number of complexes with different QAC. The structural formulas of QACs are shown in Fig. 1. The peroxo complexes with Q+ – [Bn(Prn)3N]+ and [Bn(Bun)3N]+ have not been previously described in literature. Due to a strong effect of the structure of QAC on the solubility of the resulting peroxo complex in water media, a previously described procedure [20] was modified to obtain pure QAC-peroxo complex compounds with Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} structure (see 2.2). A combination of elemental analysis data and IR spectroscopy was first used to confirm the structure of the synthesized materials. The elemental analysis data and the assignment of IR bands are collected in Table 1 . IR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 . The data show that tungsten to phosphorus (W/P) ratio for all samples was found to be close to 0.25. This implies the formation of complexes with PW4 stoichiometry which corresponds to {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3-peroxo complex anion structure. The IR spectra shown in Fig. 2 feature characteristic bands of P-O (1100–1000 cm-1), W = O (1000–950 cm-1), O-O (around 850 cm-1) and W-O2 (700–500 cm-1) vibrations. Other bands observed in the range 800–600 cm-1 can be attributed to the vibrations of QACs. The IR data suggest that for all synthesized complexes the structure of anion corresponds to that of tetra-nuclear anion with a structure {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3- [20,37,38]. Overall, the IR data shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 suggest that the nature of cation mainly affects the frequencies of the stretching vibrations of the W = O fragment and has little effect on the frequencies of other fragments of the anion. Taking this into account we can presume a specific interaction between cation and anion, and the bond is formed with the participation of oxygen of the W = O fragment of peroxo complex. To further understand the interactions between QAC and peroxo-anion in the complexes, we studied the influence of anion on the structure of cation. For this we obtained the Raman spectra of the compounds containing similar cations but different anions. We chose the complexes 6 and 10, the ν(W = O) frequencies of which differ rather dramatically, and the corresponding chlorides. It was found out that the nature of anion has a strong effect on the frequencies of the stretching vibrations of C-H groups. The Raman spectra in the area of these frequencies are given in Fig. 3 . For the spectra of cation within the complex 6 (Fig. 3a) the nature of anion, first of all, affects the relative intensities of the bands of ν(C-H) vibrations and has a little impact on their frequencies (the shifts of the frequencies do not exceed 1–2 cm-1). Presumably, the anion-cation interaction in this case mostly changes the cation conformation, which is seen in the changes of relative intensities, not the length of C-H bonds. In case of cation within the complex 10 (Fig. 3b) the replacement of {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3- by Cl-results in a noticeable (9 cm-1) shift of frequency of the stretching vibration C-H of pyridine ring. It is possible that in this case there is a specific interaction between protons of pyridine ring and fragments of ν(W = O) of anion (hydrogen bond). To reveal the possibility of such interaction, we studied the molecular structure of [(Bun)4N]Cl and [CetPy]Cl with DFT. Fig. 4 a shows the optimized geometry of [(Bun)4N]+–Cl-. The data suggest that cation forms two weak hydrogen bonds with anion (r(C … Cl) = 3.33 and 3.38 Å). Fig. 5 a and b show calculated IR-spectra of cationic and ion pair (chloride) forms of [(Bun)4N] and [CetPy]. For both cations we observe a low-frequency shift (∼100 cm-1 and ∼500 cm-1 for [(Bun)4N] and [CetPy] correspondingly) of ν(CH) vibration frequencies of CH2-groups. This can be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bond between the methylene groups of cation and chloride anions. The spectra also feature new bands at 155 cm-1 and 188 cm-1 corresponding to the intramolecular vibration of hydrogen bond ν(C…Cl). The higher wavenumber observed for [CetPy]+–Cl- indicates the formation of a stronger hydrogen bond between ion Cl- (r(C…Cl) =3.16 Å) and proton bonded with α-carbon of the pyridine ring of cation. This is also in line with the higher low-frequency shift of stretching ν(CH) vibration ν(CH) for [CetPy] (See Fig. 5). To summarize, the DFT calculations show that both cations are weak CH-acids and can form hydrogen bonds with bases which can be presented as the anions Cl- in chlorides (CH…Cl bonds) as well as tungsten peroxo complexes (CH…O = W bonds). Also, according to the calculations, [CetPy]+ cation is a stronger acid than [(Bun)4N]+cation. Due to the simplicity of the model the calculation predicts stronger cation-anion interactions than it is observed in the experiment. Nevertheless, the shift of frequency of the stretching vibration ν(CH) of pyridine ring of [CetPy]+ cation in vibration spectra with the change of nature of anion (Cl- and {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3-) and, consequently, its basicity is most likely to be explained by the formation of hydrogen bond, the character of which is predicted by DFT calculations. We suggest that these hydrogen bonds can have a positive effect on the stability of the peroxo complex catalysts in solutions and, therefore, have an impact on TON (number of moles of product/number of moles of catalyst), which is an important indicator of catalyst performance used for the assessing the prospects of the catalysts application in the reactions of organic substrates oxidation. To further study the structure of the complexes, EXAFS measurements were performed for the samples in both solid phase and in solution. Acetonitrile was used as a solvent, because it could provide a relatively high solubility of peroxo complex catalysts while halogenated hydrocarbon solvents could not be used in XAS experiments. It is worth noting that here we first used EXAFS to study the structure of tungsten polyoxoperoxo complexes, and the EXAFS data presented in this paper were obtained as a result of the continuation of the previously reported work [30,31]. The k3-weighted radial distribution plots shown in Fig. 6 provide detailed information about the surrounding of W atoms. The peaks on the radial distribution curve correspond to the distances from W atoms to O atoms, whereas the intensity is proportional to the number of atoms in the given distances (coordination number). The shape and width of the maximum, besides thermal broadening, describe the degree of order of the tungsten surrounding by the atoms located at these distances. The data shown in Fig. 6a reveal the difference of the oxygen surrounding for the samples with cations with different length of alkyl chains. At the distances of 1.6 Å and 2.1 Å an evident increase of intensity is observed in the range of cations 1<2<3<4. A decrease in width is observed as well as an increase in the intensity of the maximum corresponding to the nearest W-O distance. This indicates an increase in symmetry of the tungsten surrounding with oxygen atoms located at this distance for cations with bulkier alkyl substituents. For the complexes dissolved in acetonitrile, the situation changes. Fig. 6b gives the curves of the radial distribution of tungsten surrounding for the samples 1–4 in solution. It is seen that in sample 1 an increase in width and a decrease in the intensity of the maximum (∼2 Å) is observed, which can indicate a drop in symmetry of the close surrounding of W. At the same time this effect becomes less pronounced for the samples 2, 3, 4. This might indicate a stronger influence on the structure of {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3- anion from the bulkier substituents containing long alkyl chains. Indeed, the transition from the solid sample to the solution has a much stronger effect over the structure of anion in the case of cation 1 [(C12H25)Me3N]+ than in the case of cation 4 [(C18H39)2Me2N]+. Fig. 6b gives the comparison of the radial distribution curves for the samples of catalysts with cations from different groups. It can be seen that the spectra of 8, 7, 4 and 1 samples possess similar features. However, clear differences in width and intensities in 1–2 Å can be observed indicating influence of the nature of quaternary ammonium cations on the local structure of anionic peroxo complex which is in a good agreement with IR and Raman data described above."
8,Catalytic oxidation reactions,"3.2 Catalytic oxidation reactions 3.2.1 Epoxidation of cyclooctene To compare activities of the synthesized catalysts, cyclooctene epoxidation reactions were carried out. Cyclooctene is often used as a benchmark substrate for testing the homogeneous epoxidation catalysts. Thus, there is the possibility to compare the results of this study with the results given in literature. (3) Table 2 gives the comparison of the initial rates of reaction (W0) of the cyclooctene epoxide formation and its yields when different catalytic systems are used. The initial reaction rate W0 was determined as a slope at the initial part of the curve of dependence of cyclooctene epoxide concentration (C) on the reaction time (τ), while the change in the initial concentrations of the reactants is negligible and they can be considered constant. The highest activity in reaction (3) was observed for the catalysts containing long alkyl substituents as well as the metal complex with cetylpyridinium cation (10). As it is shown in Table 2, the activity of the catalysts is decreasing in a range 5>4>3>10>2>1>7>6>9 = 8. An interesting regularity is observed in the series of the catalytic complexes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, where the quaternary nitrogen atom of cation contains only the alkyl substituents. Thus, when changing dodecyl (1) to hexadecyl (2) the reaction rate and the product yield increase about twofold, and as the chain grows for more two atoms of carbon, the reaction rate continues to increase. The reaction rate and product yield rise sharply when using the catalysts 4 and 5, the cations of which contain two octadodecyl and three octyl groups, respectively. Meanwhile, according the IR and EXAFS data described above, the structure of anion in all these catalysts does not differ significantly for the samples in solid phase. However, the obtained data on the activity agree well with the data of EXAFS in solution (Fig. 6) indicating the decrease in symmetry of the close surrounding of tungsten. The observed effect is more pronounced for complex 1 and becomes weaker while moving to a bulkier cation of the complex 4. A similar effect of increase in the catalytic activity is observed after extension of four alkyl groups by two carbon atoms. For the complex 7 with [(Hexn)4N]+ in relation to catalytic complex 6 with [(Bun)4N]+. In addition, we should note two revealed regularities for this reaction. The catalysts with cations containing benzyl groups (8, 9) showed low activity for the given substrate. The comparison of the catalytic systems 10 and 2 shows that their activities in the reaction are close both in terms of reaction rate and in the product yield. Based on these two confirmed facts, we can preliminarily conclude, first, the presence of several long-chain alkyl substituents at the nitrogen atom has a positive effect on the activity of the catalyst, and, second, catalyst 2 synthesized from less expensive and more readily available precursors can show a high activity comparable with that of a more expensive metal complex 10 containing cetylpyridinium cation. 3.2.2 Epoxidation of methyl oleate Vegetable oils are currently regarded as a promising renewable feedstock of the chemical industry. Unsaturated fatty acids (both free or as triglycerides) are the main component of the most plant oils produced worldwide. Functionalized oils or fatty acids can be used as a new raw material for production of bio-based plastics, coatings, plastic additives, and specialty chemicals. As the first step of functionalization, epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids affords useful building blocks for polymeric material production or chemicals for industrial applications such as plasticizers and stabilizers [39–42]. Performance of catalysts 5–10 was studied in the methyl oleate epoxidation (eq. 4). The reaction was carried out without a solvent (substrate acted as an organic phase) at 60 оC using 31% aqueous H2O2 and at the reactants molar ratio of [Cat]/[Sub]/[H2O2] = 1/1000/2000. (4) Along with the most efficient in cyclooctene epoxidation catalysts 5 and 10 with [(Octn)3NMe]+ and [CetPy]+ cations, catalysts 6–7 and 8–9 with [Bn(Prn)3N]+ and [Bn(Bun)3N]+ were tested. Under the studied conditions, high activity was demonstrated by the catalytic systems 5 – [(Octn)3NMe]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} and 10 – [CetPy]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4}. Kinetic curves of the oxidation reaction in the presence of these catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . The remaining catalysts were ineffective for practical use. As seen in the Fig. 7, catalyst 5 provides the epoxidation product in a yield of 85% in 5 hours at 60 °C. Based on the obtained results, catalyst 5 can be recommended for the preparation of methyl oleate epoxide in environment friendly conditions. 3.2.3 Oxidation of N-phosphonomethyliminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) This substrate was chosen due to the fact that one of the developing areas of fine chemical synthesis is the chemistry of tertiary amine N-oxides. Low toxicity, solubility in biological media, surface-active and red-ox properties form a set of qualities that determines the usefulness of tertiary amine N-oxides for creating new materials and pharmaceuticals. In particular, their ability to undergo a selective reduction in pathological hypoxic cells is used for creation of cytotoxic, anti-tubercular, antiprotozoal agents of selective action [43]. The synthetic potential of N-oxide, namely, the ability to undergo Polonovski [44,45], Boekelheide [46], Meisenheimer [47] and Cope [48] rearrangements, to act as the catalysts of asymmetric reactions [49] and mild oxidants [50], including intramolecular ones [51], allow us to consider the N-oxide group as a multifunctional tool for multistep syntheses. (5) The high lability of tertiary amines, especially the aliphatic ones, determines the necessity to carry out their synthesis using mild oxidants - organic or inorganic peroxides [52,53]. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide is the best oxidant for transformation of tertiary amines into N-oxides considering its availability, environmental friendliness and safety. On the other hand, due to the low activity of hydrogen peroxide in oxidation of amino group, this reaction should be performed in the presence of catalysts. Accordingly, the oxidation (eq. 5) of N-phosphonomethyliminodiacetic acid (PMIDAA) to the corresponding N-oxide (PMIDAA N-oxide) was performed in the presence of catalytic systems 2, 5 and 10, which showed the highest activity in the cyclooctene epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide. The data shown in Table 3 suggest that for all three tested catalytic systems, 2 - [(C16H33)Me3N]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4}, 5 - [(Octn)3NMe]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} and 10 - [CetPy]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4}, the comparable results are obtained both in terms of target product yield and in the TON and TOF values. The reaction (eq. 5) in the presence of selected catalysts 2, 5, 10 proceeds fast enough. The initial reaction rates (W0) calculated by the initial areas of kinetic curves of accumulation of PMIDA N-oxide are: 1.5 × 10-2mol/l·min; 1.6 × 10-2mol/l·min; 1.4 × 10-2mol/l·min, respectively. Thus, PMIDA oxidation to its N-oxide with hydrogen peroxide in two-phase liquid system (aqueous phase – organic phase) in the presence of bifunctional catalysts with the composition Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} can afford the target product with 94–98% yield in 75 minutes of reaction, which results in TON value of 2500. This example demonstrates the possibility to use peroxotungstates for selective oxidation of tertiary amines into the corresponding N-oxides with high yield in short time with the use of environmentally friendly 30% aqueous H2O2, that can be seen as a basis for the development of the approaches to the catalytic synthesis of such highly-demanded chemicals. The high TON values demonstrated by the catalysts 2, 5 and 10 significantly exceeds the values obtained for other tungsten peroxo complex catalysts used for the oxidation of various organic substrates with hydrogen peroxide. For instance, the reported TON values for (C24H52N)3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} catalyst were 444 and 316 for cyclooctene and geraniol epoxidation respectively [38]. The TON values of the (THA)2[W2O3(O2)4] catalyst (THA – tetrahexylammonium) in the epoxidation of the same substrates did not exceed 600 and 292, respectively [39]. Fairly high TON values obtain in this work might be attributed to the enhanced stability of peroxo complexes induced by the formation of (CH…O = W) hydrogen bonds as discussed above."
9,Conclusion,"1 A series of bifunctional metal complex catalysts with the composition of Q3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4}, where Q+ is the quaternary ammonium cation, have been synthesized, including two complexes with Q = [Bn(Prn)3N]+ and [Bn(Bun)3N]+, that have not been described previously. The data of elemental analysis and IR-spectroscopy confirmed the obtaining of pure complexes with the ratio of P/W = ¼ containing (O-O), (W = O), (W-O-O), and (PO) groups characteristic of peroxo complexes. 2 Based on the combined IR and EXAFS data it has been demonstrated that the structure of cation affects the structure of anion. There is a correlation between the size of cation and symmetry of W surrounding, and the result cation – anion interaction reflects on the W = O bond characteristics and conformation changes of cation. In case of cations with aromatic groups a specific interaction of aromatic system with anion is observed. A shift of frequency of stretching ν(CH) vibration of pyridine ring of cation [CetPy]+ in vibration spectra with the change in nature of anion (Cl- to {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3-), and, consequently, its basicity is most likely to be explained by the formation of hydrogen bond, the character of which is predicted by the DFT calculations. 3 The catalytic data for the selective epoxidation of cyclooctene used as a model substrate show that the type of cation indeed has a strong influence on the catalytic performance. The catalysts with cations containing two and more bulkier alkyl substituents possess higher catalytic activity in epoxidation compared to the complexes containing short alkyl or aromatic substituents. 4 It is further shown that methyl oleate can be epoxidized with nearly 100 % conversion and selectivity under mild solvent-free conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and [(Octn)3NMe]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} as a catalyst. This suggests that peroxocomplex-based catalysts can potentially provide a green alternative for the industrially relevant fatty acid oxidation processes. 5 It has been shown that PMIDA oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in presence of [(C16H33)Me3N]3{PO4[WO(O2)2]4} catalyst affords the target PMIDA N-oxide with remarkable TON values (up to 2500). The obtained result can be considered as the basis for development of a new approach to the catalytic synthesis of the demanded N-oxides of tertiary amines. This is particularly important for various pharmaceutical applications as N-oxides represent an important class of targeted therapy medications."
