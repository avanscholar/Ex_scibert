0,Introduction,"Xylitol, a five-carbon sugar alcohol, is used commercially as a natural sweetener in several food products. It is an ideal sweetener for diabetics since its metabolism does not require insulin [1] and also prevents dental caries [2]. Xylitol has been shown to have a preventive effect against acute otitits in children by impairing the growth of otopathogen, and reduces the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemaphilus influenzae to the nasopharyngeal cells. Xylitol is found naturally in fruits [3] like strawberries, plums and pears, but in small quantities, which makes its extraction difficult and uneconomical. Xylitol can be produced by biological means from xylose, another sugar, by utilizing yeasts such as the species belonging to Candida genus [4], fungi such as Petromyces albertensis [5] and also by bacteria like Enterobacter liquefaciens [6]. The most important method utilized in the synthesis of xylitol involves the chemical reduction of xylose, which in turn is obtained by the acid hydrolysis of xylan present in the hemicellulose of birchwood, beechwood or the structural plant tissues such as corn-stalks, wheat straw, cotton seed, peanut hulls, sugar cane bagasse, wood pulp and flax straw [7,8]. Xylose is also a versatile sugar compound and has many applications similar to that of xylitol, such as, sugar source for diabetic patients, non-nutritive sweetener in pharmaceutical industry, additive in color photography, brightener in zinc electroplating and production of ethanol during fermentation process. The properties of xylose and xylitol are presented in Table 1 . In the present work xylose was produced by the acid hydrolysis of rice husk [9-12]. The hydrogenation of xylose gives xylitol, which is a sugar alcohol sweeter than sucrose. However, present separation methods prove to be expensive for concentration of xylose reaction liquor in order to produce pure xylitol at yields of 50–60% using the chemical reduction method [1]. Evaporation is an energy intensive process for the concentration of xylose due to high latent heat of vaporization (540kcal/kg°C) required to bring about a phase change of liquid water to vapor. Therefore the search for an alternative technology for the concentration of xylose by removal of bulk of the water is of prime importance. This would be followed by evaporation to remove smaller quantity of remaining water resulting in energy savings. Nanofiltration (NF) is the most recently developed pressure-driven membrane process for liquid-phase separations, which is gaining increasing importance worldwide and widening scope for application [13]. It is an advanced method for the concentration of organic and inorganic aqueous solutions. The molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of NF membrane (150–1000Da) lies in the range between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration. Due to heterogeneity of the NF membrane structure and composition, the mass transport and separation characteristics of this membrane process result from several mechanisms [14]. NF membranes have been found to be extremely effective in the fractionation and selective removal of solutes from complex process streams. The further reduction of investment costs for membranes will in some cases lead to the application of product-staged NF processes becoming more attractive, as compared to single-stage RO. For example, in industrial process water treatment, where fouling, caused by dissolved organic compounds as well as microorganisms, is the limiting factor to economical performance, two-stage NF (product-staged) processes have proven to be successful [15,16]. Since the pores in NF membrane are more open when compared to RO membrane the former provides greater flux. This development of NF technology as a viable process in the last decade has led to a marked increase in its adoption in a number of industries, for treatment of pulp-bleaching effluents [17], separation of pharmaceuticals from fermentation broths [18], demineralization of milk and whey in the diary industry [19], metal recovery from waste water [20] and virus removal [21]. One of the possible applications of NF membranes could be the concentration of xylose reaction liquor for manufacturing xylitol, which has not been studied before. This paper mainly deals with the identification of a suitable membrane for the process, establishment of optimal operating parameters and evaluating the economic viability of the membrane process vis-à-vis evaporation. Experiments were carried out on a pilot-scale with a commercially available polyamide membrane of MWCO in the range 150–300. Effect of feed pressure and composition on percentage recovery, flux and rejection of xylose was determined. An economic estimate was made to determine the cost effectiveness of NF relative to evaporation for obtaining 10% xylose concentration. The flux and rejection of NF was compared with reverse osmosis to determine the more viable process amongst the two Fig. 1 ."
1,Principles of nanofiltration,"In aqueous solution NF membranes become charged, allowing separation of specific ionic species. It is believed that sieving (steric hindrance) is the dominant rejection mechanism in NF for colloids and large molecules whereas the physiochemical interactions of solute and membrane become increasingly important for ions and lower molecular weight organics [22]. Fig. 2 shows a hypothetical polymeric NF membrane with carboxylic groups attached to the surface of the membrane, which is brought in contact with an aqueous solution of the electrolytes. The presence of the dissociated carboxylic groups on the membrane surface causes the occurrence of membrane charge. The properties of nanofiltration (NF) membranes, where pores are nominally ∼1nm in dimension lie between those of non-porous reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and porous ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with solutes being separated by size exclusion as well as Donnan exclusion (based on charge)."
2,Sieving effect due to steric hindrance,"2.1 Sieving effect due to steric hindrance The NF membranes have an intermediate molecular weight cut-off between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration membranes, which ranges from 150 to 1000Da. The solutes having molecular weight (MW) larger than the MWCO of the particular NF membrane are almost completely rejected by the membrane and the ones having lower MW than the MWCO will permeate easily through the membrane."
3,Donnan effect due to electrostatic nature,2.2 Donnan effect due to electrostatic nature The Donnan effect of a membrane refers to the electrostatic interactions between ions and the membrane (Fig. 2). The membrane is mostly negatively charged since the thin film of NF membranes are made of polyelectrolytes. Ions having the same sign of charge as the membrane are excluded and the ions having the opposite sign of charge can be attracted and allowed to permeate. Separation of ions having different signs and valencies can be manipulated according to the rejection characteristics of the membrane.
4,Experimental,
5,Materials and methods,"3.1 Materials and methods Sulfuric acid, citric acid, sodium metabisulfite and tetrasodium EDTA were supplied by Loba, Chemie, Mumbai. Deionized water for acid hydrolysis of xylose and cleaning purpose was generated from the same system using reverse osmosis membrane module. The commercial RO and NF modules of dimensions: 2.5in. diameter and 21in. length having an effective area of 1.0m2 were procured from M/s Permionics Membranes Pvt. Ltd., Vadodara, India. Raw material for xylose production which was rice husk in the present case was procured from local rice mills. The known weight of rice husk was mixed with stipulated quantity of sulfuric acid and then charged into the reactor [9–12]. Steam was passed continuously for a certain period of time to produce xylose. Reaction liquor was filtered to remove the spent husk followed by neutralization using an ion exchange resin column to remove unreacted sulfuric acid. Neutralized liquor was concentrated to 10% xylose by nanofiltration."
6,Description of membrane system,"3.2 Description of membrane system A pilot-scale membrane system (Fig. 3 ) was assembled in-house with incorporation of commercial spiral membrane module in stainless steel pressure housing. The system was skid mounted and had a feed tank of 100l capacity. A high-pressure pump, capable of maintaining a pressure up to 60bar was installed at the feed inlet, to transport xylose reaction liquor throughout the system. The pump was run by a 1.5 HP single-phase motor. A micron prefilter cartridge of 0.2μm pore size was installed upstream of the spiral module to prevent entry of suspended particles, capable of damaging the membrane. A restricting needle valve was provided on the concentrate (reject) outlet pipeline to pressurize the feed liquid to a desired value indicated by the pressure gauge installed upstream to the needle valve. A coil-type heat exchanger was introduced in the reject line since the jacketed feed tank was inadequate for bringing down the temperature of the reject, which gets heated rapidly by continuous pressurization and re-circulation during the batch operation. The reject stream exiting the membrane gets distributed into three concentric coils of different radii which provide large heat transfer area (1.2m2) and sufficient cooling for feed pumped at such high-pressure and flow rate. Ice-cold water was circulated through the shell side of the heat exchanger using a water circulation pump to ensure a relatively uniform feed temperature (28–30°C). The heat exchanger thus enables determination of percentage recovery by continuous removal of water until the flux remains within acceptable limits. The permeate and the reject flow rates were measured by means of two glass rotameters containing metal floats. The permeate was collected in marked buckets with the help of a polyethylene tube. All the other connections were made with 1/2in. o.d. stainless steel 316 piping in the high-pressure region and the low pressure lines constituted of PVC braided tubing for permeate flow and reject recycle."
7,Experimental procedure,"3.3 Experimental procedure Briefly, 50–100l of feed solution was charged into the feed tank. Initially the feed solution was circulated for 5–10min for a steady state and the conductivity and temperature were noted. A sample of the feed was collected for analysis. The needle valve in the reject line was adjusted to obtain a suitable pressure value in the range 10–25bar depending on the type of membrane module used and its MWCO. Since the feed solution generates excessive amounts of foam, an antifoaming agent made of castor oil+sulfuric acid was added. The initial permeate was recirculated until a steady permeate flux was obtained. The concentrate (reject) flow rate was fixed at 17l/min and continuously recirculated to the feed tank through the heat exchanger. The permeate was then collected in a separate vessel and conductivities of the reject and permeate were noted for every 5l of permeate collected. The process was continued to achieve a recovery of 80–90% water as permeate. Samples of the overall permeate, and final concentrate were also collected for analysis. Feed, permeate and reject samples were analyzed by HPLC method for determination of xylose concentrations while the total dissolved solids (TDS) was estimated by controlled evaporation of the samples on a sand bath heater."
8,Analytical,"3.4 Analytical The feed, permeate and concentrate sample were analyzed by HPLC method using the following conditions – Instrument LC: 10AVP, mobile phase: acetonitrile/water in the ratio 90:10, respectively, NH2 Column of length 25cm, flow rate: 1ml/min and RI detector. The color of the samples were estimated according to APHA methods [23]. The conductivity and pH of the samples were determined using digital conductivity and pH meters.

9,"Rejection, flux and percentage recovery","3.5 Rejection, flux and percentage recovery In NF process the separation performance of the membrane is denoted in terms of % rejection of TDS or any other feed component, which is calculated as [24]: % R = 1 − C P C f × 100 where the C p is concentration of the component in the permeate while C f is its concentration in the feed. The flux (J) is the volume of the permeate (V) collected per unit membrane area per unit time (t) [24]: J = V A t The approximate osmotic pressure Δπ (bar) is determined from the following equation [24] in order to determine the minimum pressure required to generate flux: Δ π = v i c i R T where c i is the concentration of TDS in mol/dm3, v i the number of ions formed when the solute dissociates, R the the universal gas constant (83.133dm3 bar/kmolK) and T the absolute temperature (301K)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Effect of feed concentration,"4.1 Effect of feed concentration Table 2 represents the composition of reaction liquor, which indicates a xylose concentration in the range 1.5–2%. Xylose is an organic compound, which does not ionize in solution, and therefore the feed conductivity of 0.5–1.5mS/cm indicates the presence of a small quantity of salts. Since the solution was neutralized the pH was always between 6 and 8, which is a compatible range for commercial RO and NF membranes. 4.1.1 Performance of different membranes Nanofiltration was carried out using two different membranes, polyamide (PA 150-300) and cellulose triacetate (CTA, MWCO 700-1000), whereas thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membrane was employed for the RO process. All membranes tested with xylose solution showed a linear relationship between permeate flux and applied pressure, which is shown in Fig. 4 . As it is evident from the figure, polyamide NF membrane shows a flux which is intermediate to cellulose triacetate (CTA) which has bigger pore size and reverse osmosis TFC membrane which has a non-porous skin. Performance of the three different membranes is compared in Table 3 in terms of flux and separation characteristics. Though RO process showed high percentage rejection (∼99.5%) of xylose, the flux of 21l/m2 h at a pressure of 25bar makes it uneconomical compared to nanofiltration, which gave a flux of 24l/m2 h at only 20bar. The reduction in flux was found to be more drastic for increasing feed concentration in case RO. The final flux before reaching 10% xylose concentration was observed to be less than 3l/m2 h. CTA membrane which had the largest pore size amongst the three membranes, allowed substantial permeation of xylose and the losses were found to be unacceptable since the presence of xylose in the permeate was around 0.5% for a water recovery of 40% as permeate. Further studies were therefore carried out using only polyamide NF membrane whose pores are much more open than in TFC RO membrane to enable higher flux at lower pressure gradients but much smaller than in CTA to prevent xylose from permeating. 4.1.2 Effect of process variables (feed pressure and feed concentration) Fig. 5 describes the effect of varying feed pressure (5–50bar) on performance of polyamide NF membrane in terms of water flux and % xylose rejection. A trans-membrane pressure of 20bar and temperature in the range 28–30°C was found to be optimum since high rejection of 99.13% was obtained with reasonably high flux of 24l/m2 h. Increasing rejection of xylose from 90.6 to 99.7% could be explained on the basis of the solution-diffusion mechanism [25] which states that increasing pressure causes enhancement in the sorption of water which has ability to interact extensively with the polar functional groups of the hydrophilic membrane through hydrogen bonding. On the other hand the solute (xylose) molecules do not interact with the membrane as much and their flux remained more or less the same [26]. Thus the corresponding rise in flux of water from 4.1 to 48l/m2 h, combined with the relatively constant flux of xylose lead to improved rejection and rate of concentration. Fig. 6 plotted for time of operation against flux and recovery depicts the effect of feed concentration on membrane performance. This experiment was carried out at a feed pressure of 20bar with initial feed volume of 100l having 2% xylose concentration. After a time period of 10min and water recovery of 20%, the flux was as high as 50l/m2 h which reduced to a value as low as 6.75l/m2 h after 91% of the water was recovered in 80min of pilot plant operation. Increasing concentration of xylose in the feed solution with time increases the concentration polarization of these molecules on the NF membrane surface causing an increase in the osmotic pressure and a corresponding decrease in trans-membrane pressure difference across the barrier, resulting in a reduction in flux [27]. The average flux was however in the range 24l/m2 h which is reasonable. The conductivity of the permeate solution was in the range 0.4–0.6mS/cm which meant that impurities such as monovalent salts (NaCl, etc.) got simultaneously removed through the membrane during concentration of xylose sugar thus providing an added advantage over RO process in which all the salts get concentrated along with xylose."
12,Membrane fouling and its control,"4.2 Membrane fouling and its control The membrane would be especially prone to biological fouling since aqueous xylose solution gathers extensive fungal growth in 2 days time due to the presence of a small concentration of glucose which is by-product formed during acid hydrolysis of xylose. It is worth mentioning that pure xylose solution does not attract any fungal growth. For a prolonged life of the membrane it was necessary to wash it thoroughly with deionized water first and then give a weekly wash with 2% (w/v) citric acid solution to remove metal salt precipitates formed due to presence of inorganics in the reaction liquor. Every alternate week, washing with 1% (w/v) solution of tetra sodium EDTA, a chelating agent, was required to remove organic foulants and silt. The above methods were efficient in restoring water flux. During pilot-plant shutdown the membrane was stored in a 1% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution to prevent biological fouling. The effect of time in months on the separation performance of the NF membrane at 20 and 40bar feed pressures is illustrated in Fig. 7 which shows that the flux reduced to only about 96.5% of its original value over a period of 6 months for 20bar, whereas the rejection (not shown in the figure) fell by a value of <0.5% from 99.13 to 98.7%, which are acceptable standards of performance [28]."
13,Economic estimate,"4.3 Economic estimate Approximate operating costs for both evaporation and NF for concentration of xylose were determined. 4.3.1.1 Nanofiltration Operation of a high-pressure pump and periodic membrane replacement account for the major proportion of the operating costs in nanofiltration. The relation between energy consumption and applied pressure for a positive displacement pump is given by [29]: E = Q 0 P 0 1259.2 η η m where Q 0 and P 0 are the feed flow rate and feed pressure, respectively, while η and η m, represents pump and motor efficiencies, respectively. Assuming the motor and pump efficiencies to be 0.7 and 0.6, respectively [30], the operating cost was calculated on basis of 17lpm feed flow rate and a pressure of 20bar. The energy consumed was found to be 0.643hp (0.48kW). The power cost required by nanofiltration for concentrating xylose solution from 2% feed concentration to 10% was found to be Rs. 6.4 for 1000kg of feed. Assuming a membrane life of one and half years the total volume of xylose reaction liquor that could be concentrated during 300days/year operation would be 612t using a membrane area of 2.4m2. The replacement cost was back calculated for processing 1000kg of xylose liquor to be Rs. 29.4. Pretreatment costs would largely comprise of neutralization of reaction liquor using ion exchange resin. This has not been included in the economic estimation since the same cost would be applicable to neutralize the feed even in case only evaporation is applied to concentrate xylose. Therefore the total cost for NF would be $0.7 (Rs. 35.8) per 1000kg assuming an exchange rate of Rs. 50.0 per US dollar. 4.3.2 Evaporation cost Multiple-effect evaporation (four stages) is generally used for the concentration of xylose reaction liquor [31]. Table 4 shows the comparison costs of the evaporation and NF process for 1000kg of feed solution. Evaporation of 2% reaction liquor to 10% concentration costs about Rs. 160.0 ($3.2) assuming a steam cost of Rs 1.0 per kg. This means that NF cost is only 22% of evaporation cost."
14,Conclusions,"This work reveals the feasibility of using nanofiltration method for the concentration of aqueous reaction liquor of xylose, which is an ideal sugar for diabetic patients. Polyamide NF membrane of 150–300 MWCO appears to be the best membrane for the concentration application when compared to CTA NF or TFC RO membranes since it is effective in obtaining a concentrate with nearly total recovery of the sugar at a reasonably high rate of concentration. Partial removal of unwanted monovalent salts is simultaneously possible during the concentration of xylose by nanofiltration. Increasing feed concentration resulted in reduced flux due to increasing osmotic pressure whereas pressure had a positive effect on both flux and rejection owing to enhanced water sorption in the hydrophilic membrane. Process economics showed that nanofiltration appears to be a much more cost-effective method than evaporation for dehydration of feed solutions containing organics such as xylose. A large amount of recyclable water can be generated as permeate with reduction of volumetric load on energy intensive evaporation during concentration. The recovered water could be used once again recycled for acid hydrolysis of rice husk to produce xylose. The international market price for xylose is Rs. 250 per kg ($5.0). However, application of nanofiltration for concentration of xylose reaction liquor could possibly bring down the price by about four to five times the present value, which would have great socio-economic impact owing to the consumable nature of xylose for diabetic patients."
