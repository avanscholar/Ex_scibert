0,Introduction,"Nanoparticles are solid dispersion/colloidal particles of size range 10–100 nm [1]. They have different shapes and surface morphologies, and usually form nanospheres, nanowires, nanorings, nanotubes, nanorods, etc. [2]. Nanoparticles are extensively used in the production of nanogenerators, ceramics, photodetectors, solar cells and biosensors [3]. The presence of nanoparticles in the reaction mixture is known to affect the properties of bio-macromolecules. Nanoparticles also cause an increment in the surface area, storage capacity, thermal stability, diffusion and particle mobility [4]. Nanoparticles are known to possess a comparable size to that of bio-macromolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. A wide variety of modified nanomaterials are being used to modulate the properties of bio-macromolecules [5]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have several exclusive properties such as high surface area to volume ratio, size/shape dependent electronic and optical properties, and the surface of AuNPs that can be easily modified with various ligands containing high affinity groups such as amines, phosphines and thiols [6]. These high affinity groups help in the attachment of ligands or linker to the AuNPs in order to further enhance their functionality [7]. The extensive use of AuNPs and their nanoconjugates has triggered a wide range of investigations of (on) the applications of AuNPs in diagnostics and bioelectronics [8,9]. Citrate, used as a stabilizing as well as functionalizing agent assists in producing AuNPs with a high degree of monodispersity. The citrate reduction method of AuNPs synthesis is advantageous in the production of spherical AuNPs with the size ranging from 5 to 250 nm, with optimization over size control [9]. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) belongs to the class of oxidoreductases (E.C. 1.1.1.1), and depend on zinc for their catalytic activity [10]. ADH catalyzes the conversion of alcohols into their corresponding carbonyl compounds, and this makes it a potential enzyme to be used in the biosensor production, chemical industry and for the regeneration of various co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H and NAD(P) [11]. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) is a homotetrameric enzyme. Each monomeric chain contains eight cysteine residues, out of which six cysteine residues are present on the surface (Cys 97, Cys 100, Cys 103, Cys 111, Cys 276, Cys 277) and two cysteine residues are buried inside (Cys 43, Cys 153), and a methionine residue (Met 270) [10]. YADH is used widely for the production of important pharmaceutical agents such as (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol, phenylethanols, γ-valerolactone, adrenergic receptor agonists, β-lactam antibiotics, anti-depressants, anti-asthmatics, anti-anxiety, anti-cholesterol, anti-hypertensive, anti-thrombotic, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-emetic, anti-AIDS and anti-epileptic drugs [12]. Nanoparticles interact with enzymes by non-covalent interactions (van der waal forces, ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding) and through chemical linkages. Unlike chemical linkages, non-covalent interactions between enzyme and nanoparticles do not disturb the active site and native 3D structure of the enzyme [13]. For efficient interaction, nanoparticle and enzyme must have some specific groups showing affinity towards each other [5]. These nanoparticle and enzyme interaction can be monitored by techniques such as UV–visible spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fluorescence spectroscopy, etc. Enzyme nanoparticle interaction brings about some changes in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Enzymes like lipases, epoxyhydroxylases, acylases, β-galactosidases, etc. can be modulated upon interaction with different nanoparticles [14]. Enzymes show increased enzyme activity and cooperative catalysis when their active sites remain exposed upon interacting with the nanoparticles. This approach can be used to modulate the activity/properties of various biomacromolecules, enzymes and nanoformulations for their therapeutic, industrial and diagnostic uses [15]. The aim of this study was to explore the interaction and modulation capability of cit-AuNPs with YADH in a way different from the conventional enzyme immobilization. We have determined the role of enzyme:cit-AuNPs ratio in modulating the catalytic activity of YADH and its relation with the different levels of agglomerations between cit-AuNPs and YADH. The attachment of cit-AuNPs with YADH has been illustrated by using unmodified and thiol modified YADH. Furthermore, experiments have been performed to investigate the interaction of cit-AuNPs and YADH. Varying concentrations of cit-AuNPs and YADH have been used to know their exact ratio in the reaction mixture responsible for optimum modulation. Every possible blank (control) was included in the study and every experiment was performed in triplicates."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tri‑sodium citrate dehydrate, gold(III)chloride hydrate, bicinchoninic acid (BCA) solution, copper sulphate solution, ADH from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) sodium salt were procured from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dialysis membrane-135 (LA398-10MT) was obtained from Himedia laboratories, India. HPLC water, potassium carbonate, ethanol, Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), HCl, 2,2’-Dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) (DTNP), acetone, acetonitrile, butanol, toulene, chlorobenzene were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL), India. All the reagents were of analytical grade."
3,Preparation of citrate-stabilized AuNPs,"2.2 Preparation of citrate-stabilized AuNPs A reducing solution of 2.5 mM tri‑sodium citrate dihydrate was prepared in HPLC grade water and then 50 ml of this was transferred to a 250 ml conical flask placed on a temperature controlled magnetic stirrer. To the reducing solution, 500 μl of 25 mM gold(III)chloride hydrate was mixed drop by drop at 80 °C under vigorous stirring [9]. Consequently, 300 μl of 100 mM potassium carbonate was added to maintain the basic pH that is essential for the formation of smaller sized AuNPs [16]. Finally, the solution was stirred for 30 min in order to completely reduce gold(III)chloride to AuNPs [16]. The cit-AuNP solution thus formed was then stored at 4 °C for further use. The cit-AuNPs colloidal suspensions (1 ml) were then mixed with the cryoprotectant mixture of 0.1 g of trehalose and mannitol each in glass vials. The lyophilization was performed on a bench-top Lyodel freeze dryer equipped with a 200 LPM vacuum pump and oil mist filter. The sample vials were dipped in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and later stored at -80 °C before loading into the lyophilizer. The vapour collector chamber was kept at -80 °C temperature and 1 × 10−3 bar pressure throughout the process. The samples were left in the chamber until they dried completely. The dried cit-AuNPs were then re-suspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and analyzed by UV–visible spectroscopy and DLS [17]."
4,YADH activity assay,"2.3 YADH activity assay The stock solution of YADH was prepared by dissolving the enzyme in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The protein concentration was routinely determined by the BCA assay [18]. The enzymatic activity of YADH was determined by spectrophotometric activity assay. YADH utilizes NAD+ as a co-factor and ethanol as the substrate [11]. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg of YADH, 5 mM NAD+ and 250 mM ethanol in 1 ml of the total reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by ethanol, then mixture was then incubated for 2 min at 40 °C and the change in absorbance was recorded at 340 nm to calculate the production of NADH by the formula a = Ɛcl, where Ɛ corresponds to the molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6220 M−1 cm−1). Proper reaction blanks (substrate, enzyme and cit-AuNP controls) were used in the experiment. All the constituents of the reaction mixture were dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 [11]."
5,Characterization of cit-AuNPs,2.4 Characterization of cit-AuNPs A double beam Shimadzu UV-1900 spectrophotometer (UV Probe 2.43) was used to obtain the absorption spectra (350–700 nm) of the synthesized cit-AuNPs [19]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to determine the size of the cit-AuNPs. A small volume from the mixture containing 2.5–40 μg/ml of YADH and 50 μg/ml of cit-AuNPs was taken and drop casted onto a copper grid and air dried overnight. These grids were further analyzed by a JEOL model JEM-1200EX instrument operated at 80 kV accelerating voltage [20]. Particle size distribution of the above mentioned samples was determined by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instrument). The elemental composition of cit-AuNPs was determined by the microscope equipped INCAxsight energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) spectrometer (Oxford Instruments) [21].
6,UV–visible spectroscopy studies,2.5 UV–visible spectroscopy studies Absorption spectra of YADH (50 μg/ml) were measured in the wavelength range of 250–400 nm in the presence of varying concentration of cit-AuNPs (0–50 μg/ml) in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The absorption spectra of cit-AuNPs (50 μg/ml) were measured in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm in the presence of varying concentration of YADH (0–50 μg/ml). A double beam Shimadzu UV-1900 spectrophotometer (UV Probe 2.43) was used for UV–visible spectroscopic studies [22].
7,Intrinsic fluorescence of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs,"2.6 Intrinsic fluorescence of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs Fluorescence emission spectra of YADH (50 μg/ml) in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) were recorded in the presence of varying concentration of cit-AuNPs (0–50 μg/ml) using a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF-5301-PC). Tryptophan specific fluorescence emission spectra of YADH in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs were recorded in the wavelength range of 300 to 500 nm after exciting at 295 nm, keeping excitation and emission slit width fixed at 5 nm. The control samples contained cit-AuNPs (0–50 μg/ml) in buffer to check their interference in the intrinsic fluorescence of the YADH [23]."
8,Determination of kinetic parameters of YADH with cit-AuNPs,2.7 Determination of kinetic parameters of YADH with cit-AuNPs The catalytic activity of YADH was measured at different concentrations of ethanol (0–500 mM) in the absence or presence and cit-AuNPs following the standard YADH activity assay. The kinetic parameters [Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximum velocity)] of YADH were determined in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs by fitting the data into Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver Burk plots. The slope and intercept of the Lineweaver Burk plot were used to calculate the exact values of Km and Vmax [5].
9,Modification of free thiol (-SH) groups of YADH,"2.8 Modification of free thiol (-SH) groups of YADH Modification of the thiol group present in free cysteine of YADH was carried out by incubating YADH (100 μg/ml) with 0.5 mM 2,2′- dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) (DTNP). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight on a mini lab-roller at room temperature. The yellow coloured solution obtained along with the unmodified YADH was then dialyzed to remove the excess DTNP and analyzed on the UV–visible spectrophotometer for a wavelength scan. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of cit-AuNPs were also monitored in the absence and presence of modified YADH [15]. Dialysis membrane of average flat width 39.4 mm and average diameter 23.8 mm was used for the dialysis. The membrane was activated by heating in a solution containing 10 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM Na2EDTA for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then transferred into the activated dialysis tubing which was then transferred into a 2 l flask containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) kept on a magnetic stirrer. The buffer was changed after a time interval of 6 h and the process was repeated 4 times. The thiol modified YADH solution was then removed from the dialysis tubing for further experimental procedure [24]. Thiol modified and unmodified YADH (0.5 μg/ml) were further analyzed for their activity in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs (2.5 μg/ml)."
10,Solvent tolerance,"2.9 Solvent tolerance The YADH activity in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs was determined in a medium containing 10% of various organic solvents including, acetone, acetonitrile, butanol, toluene and chlorobenzene. YADH was pre-incubated with these organic solvents for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NAD+ and ethanol. The activity of the YADH in the absence of organic solvent was taken as 100%, and the activity of the remaining samples was calculated in terms of % residual activity [21]."
11,Molecular docking,"2.10 Molecular docking AutoDock Vina was employed for molecular docking studies rather than AutoDock due to its efficiency to perform more accurate and fast calculations [25,26]. The structure of YADH was downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4W6Z). The pre-complexed YADH was prepared by removing the solvent molecules, followed by the addition of polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges using MGL Tools-1.5.6 [27]. AutoDock Vina uses Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm for docking calculations consisting of an independent number of runs (i.e. exhaustiveness) which was set to be 100. The grid box size was set to 68 × 50 × 48 Å. The center of the grid was adjusted to x = 87.003, y = −15.2116, z = 49.230 with a maximum spacing of 1 Å to encircle all the active site residues. The structures of citrate (CID: 31348) and ethanol (CID: 702) were obtained from PubChem in SDF format. Ligand molecules were converted to pdb format using Chimera-1.10.2 and the minimization was performed through Avogadro software [28]. Rest of the parameters were assigned with the default values. The cluster analysis was performed with RMSD tolerance of 2 Å. The docked structures were visualized and analyzed to study the binding sites between receptor and ligand using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio (3.1) program (Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA, Discovery Studio Modeling Environment, San Diego, 2016) [29]."
12,Results and discussion,
13,Characterization of citrate stabilized AuNPs,"3.1 Characterization of citrate stabilized AuNPs In the synthesis of AuNPs, trisodium citrate was used as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent. The carboxylate groups of the citrate molecules initiate fast nucleation that results in the formation of citrate stabilized AuNPs. Citrate ions impose a net negative charge and stabilize AuNPs through the electrostatic interactions [30]. The wine red colour of the solution marks the presence of cit-AuNPs exhibiting the absorption maximum at 521 nm (Fig. 1 ) [16]. The pattern of absorption maximum corresponds to the dispersivity and the size of cit-AuNPs. AuNPs of size range 4 to 25 nm generally exhibit the maximum absorbance near 520 nm [16]. However, particles of larger size, non-spherical shape and agglomeration results into a slightly higher absorption maximum and peak broadening in the absorption spectrum [19]. The solution of cit-AuNPs was then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 25 min and the pellet was collected and lyophilized to obtain cit-AuNPs powder which contained 1.008 ± 0.006 mg of the nanoparticles. Further studies were performed with the colloidal form of cit-AuNPs and the volume of solution in the reaction mixture was taken according to the weight it contained. TEM was performed to further characterize cit-AuNPs in the presence of varying concentrations of YADH (0–40 μg/ml). Transmission electron micrograph indicated that the AuNPs formed by the citrate reduction method had a size of approximately 10 nm (Fig. 2 ). It was observed that the cit-AuNPs remained evenly dispersed in solution at lower concentrations of YADH (till 5 μg/ml), whereas at higher concentrations of the enzyme, the cit-AuNP agglomerated. At slightly higher concentration of the enzyme (10 μg/ml), cit-AuNPs arrange themselves in a slightly branched pattern, however the complete agglomeration of the nanoparticles occurs at higher enzyme concentrations (beyond 20 μg/ml) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the elemental composition of cit-AuNPs was determined by EDAX analysis and they were found to contain gold, chlorine, carbon and oxygen in significant amounts (Fig. 3 ). YADH induced agglomeration of cit-AuNPs was further supported by the particle size distribution analysis using the DLS method. An increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of cit-AuNPs upon the addition of YADH was observed. The hydrodynamic diameter of cit-AuNPs was 21.2 nm, while in the presence of 2.5, 10 and 40 μg/ml of YADH, the hydrodynamic diameter was measured to be 22.6, 28.9 and 44.3 nm, respectively (Fig. S1 Electronic supplementary information) (Table 1 ). The possible reason for the increase in the hydrodynamic diameter is that some of the citrate ions are partially replaced by the YADH molecules, leading to some agglomeration of cit-AuNPs with YADH molecules, resulting in the increase of average particle size [31]. The zeta potential value of cit-AuNP was determined to be −32.9 mV in the standard YADH activity buffer (Fig. S2 Electronic supplementary information) (Table 2 ). Colloidal solutions having a zeta potential value more negative than −30.0 mV and more positive than +30.0 mV are generally considered stable. The zeta potential values of cit-AuNPs in the presence of 2.5, 10 and 40 μg/ml of YADH were determined to be −31.0, −25.4 and − 21.7 mV, respectively (Fig. S2 Electronic supplementary information) (Table 2). The decrease in the zeta potential values of cit-AuNPs in the presence of the enzyme suggests a slight destabilization when the enzyme concentration is increased from 2.5 to 40 μg/ml. This might be because of the formation of agglomerates in the presence of YADH. Higher enzyme concentration facilitates more agglomerate production which causes a slight decrease in the zeta potential value. Similar observations were made in the DLS analysis. The agglomerates and the stable portion of the solution (non-agglomerated cit-AuNPs) collectively contribute towards zeta potential."
14,UV–visible absorption measurements,"3.2 UV–visible absorption measurements The absorption spectra of YADH (50 μg/ml) were recorded in the wavelength range of 250–400 nm, in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of cit-AuNPs (0–50 μg/ml). With the increase in the concentration of cit-AuNPs, an increase in the absorbance (hyperchromicity) at 280 nm was observed (Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, the absorption spectra of 50 μg/ml cit-AuNPs were recorded in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of YADH (0–50 μg/ml). With the increase in the YADH concentration, there was a decrease in the absorbance at 521 nm (Fig. 5 ). The absorption maximum of YADH near 280 nm is due to the presence of aromatic amino acids. Any change in the patches containing the aromatic amino acids directly affects the absorption spectrum. Thus the absorption measurements suggest that the cit-AuNPs bind to YADH and bring about some conformational changes in the structure of enzyme [15]."
15,Intrinsic fluorescence of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs,"3.3 Intrinsic fluorescence of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs Intrinsic fluorescence analysis of YADH (50 μg/ml) in the absence and presence of different concentrations of cit-AuNPs (0–50 μg/ml) was performed. A significant quenching in the fluorescence of YADH was observed, leading to a gradual decrease in the fluorescence maxima at 336 nm (Fig. 6 ). Therefore, it is evident that cit-AuNPs get bound to YADH and the observation may also be due to the lesser availability of the soluble enzyme at that concentration in the medium [23]."
16,Modulation of catalytic activity of YADH,"3.4 Modulation of catalytic activity of YADH Here, we have tried to demonstrate an agglomeration based modulation of catalytic activity of YADH. The level of agglomeration is expected to control the availability of active site and its orientation. Generally enzyme modulation studies are based on nanoparticle controlled enzyme-substrate association which is dependent on size of the nanoparticles [32]. YADH contains 6 cysteine residues (free thiol groups of Cys 97, Cys 100, Cys 103, Cys 111, Cys 276 and Cys 277) and one methionine residue (Met 270) away from the active site and exposed to the medium. These free thiol groups facilitate the attachment of YADH to the cit-AuNPs and make the active site exposed to the medium and available for catalysis. We have performed the enzyme dependent assay to know the lowest possible enzyme concentration at which catalysis can be detected (Fig. 7 ). It was observed that enzyme concentration lower than the 0.5 μg/ml in the reaction mixture cannot bring about a significant change in the absorbance at 340 nm, hence catalysis at an enzyme concentration lower than 0.5 μg/ml cannot be detected. Further, we performed the activity assay with enzyme concentration 0.5 μg/ml in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of cit-AuNPs (0.5–5 μg/ml). With the increase in the cit-AuNPs concentration in the reaction mixture, the activity of YADH increased significantly (~ 3.1 fold) up to a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml cit-AuNPs. However, at higher concentrations of cit-AuNPs, the activity of the enzyme became almost constant (Fig. 8 ). This may be due to the reason that at 2.5 μg/ml and higher cit-AuNPs concentration, no free enzyme is available for the attachment with the nanoparticles, hence there is no modulation observed in the activity of YADH at these concentrations of cit-AuNP. To determine the kinetic parameters [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax)], YADH activity (V) at varying substrate concentrations (S) [0–500 mM] was measured. The hyperbolic curve (Fig. S3, Electronic supplementary information) obtained from the substrate dependent activity assay of YADH follows the Michaelis-Menten equation below: V = V max S / S + K m Michaelis-Menten plot is a hyperbolic curve which cannot be used to determine the kinetic parameters accurately [33]. For accurate determination of the kinetic parameters, reciprocal of the Michaelis-Menten equation is done to obtain a Lineweaver-burk plot which is a linear plot and whose equation is below: 1 / V = K m / V max S + 1 / V max . Here, the intercept on y-axis corresponds to 1/Vmax and the slope of the plot corresponds to Km/Vmax. The kinetic parameters of YADH were determined by individually performing substrate dependent activity assays with a fixed concentration of YADH (0.5 μg/ml) and varying concentration of the substrate (0–500 mM) at different cit-AuNP concentration (0–5 μg/ml) (Fig. S4, Electronic supplementary information) (Table 3 ). Furthermore, we have determined the kinetic parameters of YADH by performing similar substrate dependent YADH activity assays in the presence of fixed concentration of cit-AuNPs (2.5 μg/ml) and varying concentration of YADH (0.125–2.0 μg/ml) (Fig. S4, Electronic supplementary information) (Table 4 ). It was observed that while keeping the concentration of YADH (0.5 μg/ml) constant and varying the concentration of cit-AuNPs, the Vmax initially increased significantly (~ 3.1 fold) till a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml of the nanoparticles, however it became almost constant with further increase in the concentration of the nanoparticles. The presence of cit-AuNPs was found to activate YADH till a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml cit-AuNPs, however further increase in the concentration of the nanoparticles did not further activate the enzyme because of the unavailability of the free enzyme for the attachment with the nanoparticles. Nevertheless, on determining the kinetic parameters by keeping the concentration of cit-AuNPs constant (2.5 μg/ml) and varying the concentration of YADH (0.125–2.0 μg/ml) in the reaction mixture, it was observed that almost 3.1 fold increase in the enzyme activity was observed at 0.5 μg/ml concentration of YADH. Significant YADH activity was also detected even at the low concentrations of the enzyme in the reaction mixture which was undetectable in the absence of cit-AuNPs. At lower YADH concentration, all the enzyme molecules were attached to the cit-AuNPs and no agglomeration was observed in TEM and DLS experiments. At higher concentrations of YADH, the agglomeration of enzyme and cit-AuNPs occurs and it increases with the increase in the concentration of cit-AuNPs. The YADH molecules which are buried inside the agglomerated structures are no more available to the substrate for catalysis, thus the overall reaction rate decreased. Although the YADH molecules exposed to the medium still contribute towards catalysis, and there must also be some free YADH molecules present in the reaction mixture which are contributing towards the activity. Overall catalytic activity in the agglomerated structures is the sum total of the activity of the YADH present in agglomerated structures, exposed to the medium and present in the free form. This finding can be better explained by the scheme in Fig. 9 in terms of attachment of YADH to the cit-AuNPs and the formation of agglomerates at higher YADH concentration."
17,Effect of modification of free thiol (-SH) groups on the activity of YADH,"3.5 Effect of modification of free thiol (-SH) groups on the activity of YADH The UV–visible spectrum of YADH (50 μg/ml) at 0 h of incubation with 0.5 mM DTNP consists of 2 peaks, one at 280 nm and the other at 319 nm which correspond to the characteristic absorption maxima of YADH and DTNP, respectively (Fig. 10 ). However, the spectrum of YADH after 30 h of incubation with DTNP exhibited a large peak at 387 nm which is a characteristic absorption maximum for the formation of 5-nitropyridine-2-thione (Fig. 10). The absorption maximum at 387 nm confirms the modification of thiol groups [34]. The solution was dialyzed to remove the excess DTNP. The thiol group modified and unmodified YADH was then assayed for enzyme activity in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs. YADH in the absence of cit-AuNPs and thiol modified YADH in the absence and presence of cit-AuNPs exhibited almost same activity, whereas unmodified YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs showed enhanced activity (Fig. 11 ). Therefore, after modifying the exposed thiol groups of YADH, no change in activity is observed. And even in the presence of the modulator (cit-AuNPs), thiol modified YADH did not exhibit enhanced activity and acted like the free enzyme. Therefore, these results suggest that free thiol groups present on the surface of YADH play an important role in the attachment of YADH to the cit-AuNPs. At lower YADH concentrations, cit-AuNPs attach to the surface thiol groups of the enzyme and keep the active site exposed to the medium and hence catalysis occurs, whereas at higher YADH concentration, extensive binding of cit-AuNPs to the enzyme occurs and they attach to the surface thiol groups as well as to the thiol groups present near the active site, which makes the active site inaccessible to the substrate and hence this decreases the activity of the enzyme."
18,Solvent tolerance,"3.6 Solvent tolerance The solvent tolerance assay was performed to evaluate the effect of various organic solvents on the activity of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs. After incubating YADH and cit-AuNPs composite with the organic solvents (acetone, acetonitrile, butanol, toluene and chlorobenzene), the residual enzyme activity (with and without cit-AuNPs) in the presence of the organic solvents was determined considering the activity of the enzyme alone incubated in the absence of any organic solvent as 100%. The retention of activity of YADH and cit-AuNPs composite in acetone, acetonitrile, butanol, toluene and chlorobenzene is shown in Fig. 12 and Table 5 [21]. Although YADH activity was lower in the presence of each of the organic solvents used as compared to that in the absence of any organic solvent, however, the activity increased to a similar extent in the presence of cit-AuNPs both in the presence and absence of organic solvents. Therefore, cit-AuNPs are able to activate YADH significantly in the presence of organic solvents too, which is expected to have implications in various industrial synthetic processes involving the use of the enzyme in organic solvents. The higher activity in organic solvents of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs compared to the enzyme in the absence of the nanoparticles presumably due to the reason that the nanocomposite traps water molecule because of its hydrophilicity, which prevents the entry of organic solvent molecules around the enzyme. Hence, this prevents water molecules striping by organic solvents from the hydration shell of the bound enzyme, which in turn results in the maintenance of enzyme structure and activity in the presence of the solvents in comparison with the free enzymes. Other studies have also shown that immobilization of enzymes on nanocomposites leads to improved solvent tolerance [21]."
19,Molecular docking,"3.7 Molecular docking AutoDock Vina enhanced the understanding of the interacting sites between YADH and citrate, hence validating the experimental findings. YADH consists of 347 amino acids and is a homo-tetramer, containing chains A, B, C and D. Among the four chains, chain A was selected to perform docking with citrate. AutoDock Vina resulted in different binding modes, out of which the best conformation is represented in Fig. 13A. The value of Gibb's free energy obtained for the aforementioned docked structure of YADH-citrate turned out to be −5.5 kcal/mol. The binding constant calculated for the chosen conformation to be analyzed was in the range of 104. Citrate forms 6 hydrogen bonds with Cys43, Thr45, His66, Cys153, Thr157 and Val295 of YADH as shown in Fig. 13B. Although, calling this interaction exclusive to be hydrogen bonded will not be justified. Instead, the van der Waals interaction of citrate with several residues of YADH as enlisted in Table 6 explains that these van der Waal's interaction with the residues of YADH in close proximity do participate in stabilization of the complex. Fig. 13C shows the 2D plot of the residues involved in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. On the other side, the molecular docking study also gives us insights into the interaction sites of ethanol with YADH as shown in Fig. 14 (A-C). The type and residues involved in the interaction among YADH-ethanol complex are enlisted in Table 6, which reveals that the residues involved are completely different from those in YADH-citrate complex. Hence, it can be inferred that citrate binding does not occur in the active site of the enzyme, which implies that citrate does not hamper the enzyme catalysis by YADH, and this has been validated by other experimental findings. Therefore, the experimental studies suggesting the positive modulation of YADH activity by cit-AuNP are in uniformity with the docking studies."
20,Conclusions,"The attachment of cit-AuNPs with YADH is important in modulating the activity of YADH. Here, a series of experiments were performed to reveal the possible mechanism of modulation. The thiol groups of YADH are mainly responsible for the attachment of cit-AuNPs. Attachment of cit-AuNPs to the thiol groups of YADH is crucial in attaining proper orientation and modulation. Active conformation of YADH is when the enzyme molecules are attached to the cit-AuNPs with their active sites exposed to the medium. These YADH-cit-AuNPs composites result into cooperative conversion of the substrate into product. Whereas at higher enzyme concentration agglomeration occurs, resulting into a drastic decrease in the activity. Agglomeration leads to inaccessibility of the active sites of the enzyme to bind to the substrate molecules, which results in a decrease in its activity. The decrement in the catalytic activity may also be due to denaturation of YADH induced by extensive agglomeration [35]. The activity of YADH in the presence of cit-AuNPs depends on the ratio of YADH to cit-AuNPs present in the reaction mixture. A ratio of 1:5 by mass of YADH to cit-AuNPs enhances the activity of YADH by 3.1 fold, as observed in this study. The results obtained in this study may provide a different approach of studying the industrial, diagnostic and therapeutic applications of enzymes as well as interactions of bio-macromolecules with nanomaterials."
