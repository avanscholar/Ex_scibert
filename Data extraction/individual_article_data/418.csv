0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the few energy vectors that are environment friendly, because its combustion does not generate greenhouse gases. This is why its use as a biofuel is expected to reduce up to 6 Gt of annual CO2 emissions (Acar and Dincer, 2019), if produced from renewable sources. According to Khan et al. (2017), worldwide hydrogen production is around 500 billion m3, with a growth rate of 10%. However, about 96% of hydrogen originates from fossil feedstocks, and only 4% is obtained from renewable sources (electrolysis of water) (Kumar and Himabindu, 2019). Among the green technologies under development hydrogen production, there is a growing interest in the dark fermentation fo renewable substrates, such as agro-industrial effluents: hydrogen-producing bacteria can remove between 30 and 94% of the organic matter contained in wastewater (Thanwised et al., 2012; Krishnan et al., 2016). According to Sydney et al. (2020), the theoretical maximum yield that can be achieved in biohydrogen production via dark fermentation is 4 mol H2/mol glucose. Some reported yields came close to this maximum: De Vrije et al. (2002) achieved a yield of 3.3 mol H2/mol glucose, Munro et al. (2009) reported a yield of 3.8 mol H2/mol glucose, and Sydney et al. (2014) reached a yield of 7.14 mol/mol sucrose. Most of the studies of dark fermentation from agroindustrial wastes show that the media need to be supplemented with commercial reagents to meet the waste's nutritional deficiencies. The most common supplementations are carbon (sucrose, molasses, starch, glucose) (Sydney et al., 2014), minerals (Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Cu, Mn), and amino acids (methionine, alanine, histidine, cysteine, and lysine) (Hofer et al., 2018). Cassava processing water (CPW) is generally supplemented with nitrogen sources such as yeast extract (Martinez-Burgos et al., 2019) and NH4HCO3 (Intanoo et al., 2016) and iron and sulfur (mostly in the form of FeSO4) (Thanwised et al., 2012) to achieve high biohydrogen productivity. However, adding these expensive nutrients negatively impacts the economic viability of the process. According to Yokoi et al. (2002), for example, the simple addition cysteine-HCl as a reducing agent would make the production of biohydrogen on an industrial scale unfeasible. A strategy to avoid supplementing effluents with costly reagents is to mix different effluents with complementary compositions. Corn steep liquor (CSL) is considered a rich and cheap source of carbon, nitrogen, amino acids, and minerals, with promising applications in bioprocess development (Hofer et al., 2018). Different studies have shown satisfactory results using CSL as a nitrogen source in the production of microbial metabolites such as citric acid (Sekoai et al., 2018), pullulan (Sharma et al., 2013), enzymes, and bioenergy (Wang et al., 2016). A green biohydrogen economy depends on low production costs. Seeking alternative media that meet the principle of economy is essential, and the rational use of mixed effluents can be a path forward. Therefore, this work presents the optimization of the mixture of two agro-industrial effluents and the process conditions that result in a scaled-up low-cost and productive medium for the production of bioH2."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Consortia and culture conditions,"2.1 Consortia and culture conditions Two consortia ( Vir and Gal ) previously identified were used as inoculum in this research. The Gal consortium consisted mainly of four microbial families (Porphyromonadaceae 75%, Clostridiaceae 15%, Ruminococcaceae 6%, Enterococcaceae 3% others 1%). The Vir consortium had the same families, with different proportions (Porphyromonadaceae 16%, Clostridiaceae 31%, Ruminococcaceae 0,85%, Enterococcaceae 51% others 1,5%) (Martinez-Burgos et al., 2020). Consortia were grown in completely anaerobic environments. Oxygen was removed from the medium by boiling (100–105 °C) under anoxic conditions. The medium was bubbled with argon at a flow rate of 10 mL/min for 35 s. To reduce the redox potential in the medium for inocula production, NaHCO3 (1.0 g/L) was added at 85 °C, and Cysteine-HCl (0.5 g/L) at 65 °C (Sydney et al., 2014). The main substrate used for the media was CPW. All experiments were carried on 16 mL Hungate type tubes with a working volume of 6 mL. The tubes were sealed with bakelite caps and autoclavable rubber stoppers. The pH of the cultures was initially adjusted to 7.0 using 1.0 N NaOH and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before use. The maintenance and conservation of the consortia were carried out by weekly transfer to fresh culture media. The inoculum culture medium was composed of: CPW (cassava processing waste, detailed in the next section), yeast extract (2.7 g/L), K2 HPO4 (2.4 g/L), and KH2 PO4 (1.8 g/L). The conditions used for pH, T (° C), and % inoculum in the media were optimized previously in another work. Thus, the conditions used for the Gal consortium were (pH: 6, T: 36 °C, 13% inoculum) and Vir consortium (pH: 6, T: 37 °C, 14% inoculum)."
3,Agroindustrial effluents origin and characterization,"2.2 Agroindustrial effluents origin and characterization Cassava processing wastewater (CPW) was provided by the company Amidos São João Ltda (Nova Andradina, MS-Brazil), and corn steep liquor (CSL) was provided by the company Ingredion (Balsa Nova, PR-Brazil). The effluents were kept at −20 °C prior to use. The sugars and organic acids were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The determination of nitrogen, COD (chemical oxygen demand), total volatile solids, total fixed solids were done using the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (American-Public-Health-Association, 1992). Anions and cations were analyzed by ion chromatography (761 Compact IC, Metrohm AG). The columns used were Metrosep A Supp 5–250/4.0 and Metrosep C 3250/4.0 for anions and cations, respectively. In the case of anions, the mobile phase was Na2CO3 3.2 mM e NaHCO3 1.0 mM at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min, and for the cations, HNO3 3.5 mM at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. Run times were 30 and 25 min for anions and cations, respectively."
4,Placket-Burman design,"2.3 Placket-Burman design Four independent variables were evaluated through a Placket-Burman (PB) design; three quantitative variables (CSL: 0–20% w/w, purge time with Argon: 0–35 s at 10 mL/min, stirring speed: 0–120 rpm) and one qualitative variable (medium sterilization: yes or no). The lower limits were coded with (-1) and the upper limits with (+1). A Pareto diagram was used to visualize the significant effects of the variables on biohydrogen production. One PB design with 12 experimental runs was done for each consortium."
5,Optimization,"2.4 Optimization Significant variables were optimized through a central composite design (CCD) with two factors, six central points, four axial points, and four hub points (14 experimental units). A quadratic model was fitted to the results according to Equation (1). (1) V H 2 = β o + ∑ β i X i + ∑ β ii X i 2 + ∑ β ij X i X j where, VH2 is the predicted volume of biohydrogen in mL; β0 is the constant of the models, βi the linear coefficients; βii the quadratic coefficients and βij the interactions of the coefficients. Statistical analysis and surface responses were performed using Minitab software version 15."
6,Kinetic profile of biohydrogen production,"2.5 Kinetic profile of biohydrogen production Biogas production was periodically analyzed (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h e 120 h). The gas was collected in glass syringes (5 mL and 100 mL) and analyzed on a 490 Micro GC System (Agilent) equipped with two columns (Molsieve 5 Å and PoraPLOT U) and a thermal conductivity detector (µTCD). The Molsieve 5 Å column was kept at 90 °C and initial pressure 190 kPa, and the injection temperature and time were 110 °C and 20 ms, respectively. The column PoraPLOT U (PPU) was maintained at 90 °C and initial pressure 150 kPa, with injection temperature and time of 110 °C and 20 ms, respectively. The peak retention time for H2 was 0.4 min (Ms5A), and for CO2 and CH4 were 0.405 and 0.425, respectively (PPU). The time of each run was 1.2 min. The mobile phase used was argon with a purity of 99.999%. The yield was calculated in (mL biohydrogen/g COD removed)."
7,Analyses of organic compounds,"2.6 Analyses of organic compounds The organic compounds of the fermented medium were analyzed by HPLC. Before injecting, samples (1.5 mL) were centrifuged at 6000 rpm (10 min) and microfiltered using cellulose acetate membranes (0.22 μm). It was used an Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary LC chromatograph with RI detector and Hi-Plex-H column (300*7.7 mm). Detector and column temperatures were 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 μL. Standard curves were constructed to quantify sugars, acids, and alcohols (concentrations 0.01g/L-1.5g/L)."
8,Cost estimate of culture medium,"2.7 Cost estimate of culture medium The costs for each medium were estimated using the actual commercial prices of $ 75 and $ 140 per ton of CPW and CSL, respectively (including shipping) (provided by the Brazilian companies Amidos São João Ltda and Ingredion). The prices of each of the reagents were consulted on the MERCK® website (MERCK, 2020). The cost of the culture medium was calculated using the reagent price and quantity added in each medium. Finally, the cost of 1L of hydrogen was determined based on the COD consumption and hydrogen yield (Vol. H2/gCOD)."
9,Fermentation Scale-Up,"2.8 Fermentation Scale-Up Scale-up was done in 100, 1,000 and 5,000 mL bioreactors. The working volume in each bioreactor was 35% of the total volume. The culture conditions and medium composition were obtained in the optimization step. In the case of the variable purging time, it was scaled-up maintaining constant the ratio time/volume of medium established at Hungate tube scale. In the case of larger bioreactors (0.1 L, 1.0 L, and 5.0 L), the gas was captured and measured by the fluid displacement method. Fermentations were carried in batch mode. The parameters used in the scale-up are presented in Table 1 . The variables % inoculum, temperature and pH were optimized in another work (Martinez-Burgos et al., 2020). The temperature was adjusted using resistances Atman®"
10,Results and discussion,
11,Physicochemical characterization,"3.1 Physicochemical characterization The physicochemical characterizations of CPW and CSL are presented in Table 2 . The analyses showed that effluents are sources of macro and micronutrients, promising characteristics for their use in the production of biohydrogen. In fact, Hofer et al. (2018) concluded that CPW is economically feasible as a substrate to obtain various value-added bioproducts such as proteins, organic acids, bio-energy, and others. On the other hand, CSL has also been considered a promising substrate because it has a high carbon, minerals, and nitrogen content. Thus, CSL has been used in the production leukocyte interferon with Escherichia coli, lactic acid, alcohol, acetic acid, and most recently has been used in bioenergy production (Wang et al., 2016). The organic matter and mineral content of CSL is also much higher than CPW, which can be seen in COD values of each effluent. Mixing effluents for biohydrogen production via dark fermentation showed encouraging results. The PB design showed that among the four evaluated variables, only agitation was not significant (p ≤ 0.05) for the consortia tested. In the Pareto diagram (figure not shown), it was also observed that the value of the line of significance was 2.36, while the significance values for the agitation variable were 2.35 and 2.10 for the Gal and Vir consortia, respectively. Excessive agitation can induce stress and destruction in microorganisms and medium oxidation. Ferchichi et al. (2005) found that stirring the medium at 100 rpm only improves the yield of biohydrogen by 6.0% compared to the process that was not agitated. Besides, agitated processes are more costly because of the necessary energy input (power for impellers and turbines), requiring a more sophisticated infrastructure and specific equipment and its maintenance. So it would not be advisable to use agitation in biohydrogen production processes On the other hand, it was found that the time of purging, the % CSL and medium sterilization were significant (p ≤ 0.05), and thus deserves to be optimized. In this work, the medium was sterilized to ensure less influence of uncontrollable factors in the process."
12,Optimization,"3.2 Optimization The effect of the % CSL and purge time variables on biohydrogen production by the Vir and Gal consortia were investigated using a CCD design. The planning matrix is presented in Table 3 . The contour and surface graphs obtained from CCD can be observed in Fig. 1 . The contour surfaces show that that higher %CSL improves biohydrogen production in both consortia. Peak production was observed in the range of 4.54% to 10.54% (Fig. 1A and B) and 5.04% to 11.79% (Fig. 1C and D) for Gal and Vir , respectively. This can be explained by the fact that CSL is a source of carbon, nitrogen, amino acids (ALA, ARG, CYS, ASP, GLU, TRP, GLY, HIS, LLE, LEU, LYS, TYR, MET, PHE, PRO, SER, THR, VAL), vitamins (Biotin, Choline, Inositol, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Pyridoxine, Riboflavin, Thiamine) and minerals (Ca, Cu, Mn, Fe, Mg, K, Na, P, Se, Z, S) (Hofer et al., 2018), which can participate in the different metabolic routes for the production of biohydrogen and increase the production of hydrogen. On the other hand, it is also observed in the contour surfaces that CSL concentrations higher than 10.55% and 11.80% do not improve biohydrogen production in the Gal and Vir consortia, respectively. This behavior could be attributed to the high nitrogen content of CSL (Table 2). According to Pan et al. (2013) high concentrations of organic nitrogen can be converted into ammonium, which affects the microbial growth and metabolic pathway of biohydrogen. Excesses of inorganic N also inhibit biohydrogen production (Zampol et al., 2015). According to Hamilton et al. (2018), a probable explanation is the internal changes of the pH in the bacteria, which would increase the energetic requirements, besides affecting the enzymatic systems, mainly those that participate in the production of biohydrogen, such as the hydrogenases. Another explanation is that hydrogen production is highly influenced by COD (Intanoo et al., 2015) so small amounts of CSL added in the medium are translated into high amounts of organic matter which can negatively affect the microbial growth and consequently the production of hydrogen. Different studies have evaluated commercial sources of nitrogen, such as yeast extract, peptone, ammonium sulfate, urea, ammonium chloride, with good yields; however, the use of these sources adds costs and makes biohydrogen production unviable. Furthermore, some researchers supplemented the media with other compounds such as minerals, amino acids, and vitamins as a strategy to increase biohydrogen production, further rising production costs and possibly making the process unattractive to the industrial sector. Sharma and Melkania (2018) improved biohydrogen production by 2.5–2.2 times using concentrations between 1 and 10 g/L of an amino acid mix (MET, ALA, HIS, CYS, LYS). Yuan et al. (2008) have increased biohydrogen production 1.5–2.9 times using L-cysteine (0.1–1.0 mM). They have also observed a synergistic effect among some amino acids, such as MET, ALA, HIS, CYS, LYS, and Fe2O3 in biohydrogen production. Other investigators such as Ozkan et al. (2011), Thanwised et al. (2012), Marques et al. (2015), Krishnan et al. (2016) supplemented the media with reducing agents such as Cysteine- HCl. Vitamins and minerals can also improve biohydrogen production because they can also alter metabolic pathways (Lu et al., 2013), especially the latter, which are enzymatic cofactors of hydrogenases (Shanmugam et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2020). However, these reagents are expensive, and their use negatively impact process economics. In this work, significant amounts of biohydrogen were obtained without employing any commercial reagent. This is highly attractive to industries since CSL and CPW are by-products of low to no commercial value. Purging times smaller than 14 to 16 s for Vir and Gal , respectively, negatively affected biohydrogen production. Shorter purging times probably resulted in enough residual oxygen to affect the growth of strict anaerobic cultures and consequently, biohydrogen production. It could also affect hydrogenases, enzymes involved in hydrogen production, which are highly sensitive to oxygen (Shanmugam et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2020). The consortia consisted mainly of four bacterial families, three of which are strict anaerobes (Clostridiaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Ruminococcaceae) (Pandey Ashok et al., 2013). Besides, the consortia also contained species of the Enterococcaceae family, which are facultative anaerobes (Lory, 2014) and could withstand the presence of oxygen. These species could consume the oxygen of the environment and favor the growth of strict anaerobes. Other biohydrogen studies have also reported oxygen purge processes with Ar, N2, CO2, etc. (Martinez-Burgos et al., 2020; Rosa et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2006) reported a purge time of 30 s for a 120 mL bioreactor; however, the authors did not present the flow rate used for comparison purposes. In another work (Shi et al., 2011) reported a purging time with N2 of five minutes for a volume of 3L medium. The fact that it has a larger volume of the medium means that a longer time may be required for purging."
13,Mathematical models,"3.3 Mathematical models Linear regression analysis of the experimental data from each consortium generated two-second order polynomial models with correlation coefficients, R2, of 92.18 and 94.37 (Equation (2) and Equation (3)) for Gal and Vir , respectively. Also, it can be inferred that 8% and 6% of the variability of biohydrogen production is caused by external factors that were not controlled. (2) VH 2 = 4.22 + 0.31 X 1 - 1.11 X 2 - 1.366 X 1 2 - 1.32 X 2 2 (3) VH 2 = 5.20 + 0.70 X 1 - 0.70 X 2 - 1.18 X 1 2 - 2.18 X 2 2 - 0.6622 X 1 X 2 where: VH2: Accumulated volume of biohydrogen; X1: Purge time (s); X2:% CSL. The main characteristics of the mathematical models are shown in Table 4 . The ANOVA showed that the all the linear, quadratic and interaction effects were significant (p ≤ 0.05) for the consortium Vir . A similar behavior was observed in the case of Gal , except that interaction terms are not significant. The optimized condition was validated and showed no significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between experimentally produced biohydrogen volumes and those calculated with the models (Table 4). ANOVA is valid because the three assumptions are satisfied: (i) the residuals fit a normal distribution (Fig. 2 A and B), (ii) the residues are completely dispersed, that means, they do not present trends (Fig. 2C and D), (iii) the Durbin-Watson statistic values (0.94 and 1.70 for Gal and Vir , respectively) indicated no serial autocorrelation of the errors, and (iv) the homoscedasticity was respected (the p-value of the Bartlett test were equal to 0.168 and 0.11 for Vir and Gal , respectively). The models can be considered robust because they accurately predict the production of biohydrogen with R2 of 0.91 and 0.92 for Vir and Gal , respectively (Fig. 2E and F)."
14,Evaluation of biohydrogen production under optimum conditions,"3.4 Evaluation of biohydrogen production under optimum conditions The fermentative production of biohydrogen was performed under previously optimized conditions: Gal (%CSL: 6.5; purge time:20 s), Vir (%CSL: 6.5; purge time:20 s). The accumulated production of biohydrogen by the two consortia is shown in Fig. 3 A. It is observed that in both cases, at 72 h of fermentation, approximately 95% of the biohydrogen was generated. The maximum cumulative production of biohydrogen was 1.1 and 0.89 L biohydrogen/L medium for Vir and Gal, respectively, close to those reported by Yin and Wang (2016), Yin and Wang (2019) (1.16 and 1.35 L biohydrogen/L medium). However, the media used by these researchers were supplemented with commercial reagents such as glucose, peptone, yeast extract and a nutrient solution of ten salts, while in this work; a similar biohydrogen production was achieved with a combination of agroindustrial by-products. During the fermentation by Vir and Gal , all major carbon sources in the media were completely consumed, with the production of biohydrogen and some volatile organic acids (Fig. 3B). It was observed that propionic acid (0.60 g/L) was generated by the consortium Gal , but not by Vir . The generation of propionic acid consumes H2 and, thus, is not desirable (Rosa et al., 2020). Another metabolite produced that negatively affects biohydrogen production is ethanol (Sikora et al., 2013), which reached concentrations of 1.37 and 1.14 g/L for Vir and Gal , respectively. Lactic acid was a major component of the CPW used. It amost completely consumed by both consortia (Fig. 3C), in parallel with other carbons sources (maltose, glucose, fructose). Other studies have reported that lactic acid can also be used by microorganisms such as Clostridium spp. as a substrate for biohydrogen production (Sikora et al., 2013). The generation of acetic and butyric acids was observed in both consortia (Fig. 3C). According to Sydney et al. (2020) the production of these acids is desirable, since 2 and 4 mol of hydrogen are generated for each mole of butyric and acetic acid produced, respectively. This could explain the larger volume of hydrogen obtained with the Vir consortium. A significant reduction of the COD was observed for both consortia – around 50–60%, from 9.3 ± 0.42 g O2/L to 4.1 ± 0.33 g O2/L and 4.9 ± 0.25 g O2//L for Vir and Gal , respectively. This illustrates the potential use of dark fermentation in the treatment of effluents since there is a significant reduction in the organic load, with the generation of products of high commercial value, such as H2. However, additional steps are needed to further reduce the COD to adequate levels in accordance to the legislation; one such step would be recovering the volatile fatty acids generated. The maximum biohydrogen yields achieved were 107 and 83.1 mL of biohydrogen/g COD removed for Vir and Gal, respectively. These results are superior to those in other reports that also used CPW as substrate. Intanoo et al. (2015) reported a maximum yield of 39.83 mL biohydrogen/g COD; Lucas et al. (2015) reported 31.41 mL biohydrogen/g COD and Reungsang et al. (2006) showed a maximum of 71.3 mL biohydrogen/g COD. Besides, the productivities were 14.72 and 11.4 mL/L/h for Vir and Gal respectively, values significantly higher than those reported by other works. Lucas et al. (2015) reported a maximum productivity of 1.51 mL/H2/L medium/h – 10% of the productivity achieved in this work. Reungsang et al. (2006) also achieved biohydrogen productivity similar to that reported by Lucas et al., (2015). The optimized culture media using CPW and CSL has a lower cost (81.5 USD/m3) than most media reported in the literature. Reungsang et al. (2006), Zampol et al. (2014) and Intanoo et al. (2014) also used agro-industrial effluents as substrate obtained similar culture media costs, between 75 and 83 USD/m3, but with a lower yield 71.3, 61.25 and 54.22 mL H2/g COD, respectively. Based on the medium composition of other studies of hydrogen production through dark fermentation of agro-industrial wastes, the medium cost was calculated and reached 167–707 USD/m3. Such higher costs in comparison to this work is caused by the different compounds used in supplementation, such as yeast extract, NH4Cl, (NH4)2HPO4, Peptone, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, Cysteine, Vitamin B12, Biotin, MgSO4, KCl, Na2S, CaCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2, MnCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, among others (Ozkan et al., 2011; Thanwised et al., 2012; Marques et al., 2015; Zampol et al., 2015; Intanoo et al., 2016; Krishnan et al., 2016; Vaez et al., 2017). Additionally, considering the prices of raw materials for the medium, the cost of producing 1L H2 was estimated. The lowest cost was obtained in this work with the consortium Vir US$0.15/L H2, the highest reached 7.85 USD/L H2 (Thanwised et al., 2012) and average cost was approximately 1.67 USD/L H2. Zampol et al. (2015), although supplementing with different reagents, estimate the production cost of 1L of H2 at 0.18 USD/L H2, which is explained by the high yield, besides the low concentrations of the reagents used."
15,Scale-up,"3.5 Scale-up The scaling-up improved the yield of biohydrogen (vol. biohydrogen/vol. medium) (Fig. 4 ) by 41% and 37% for Gal and Vir , respectively. In the smaller bioreactors, the biohydrogen concentration was approximately 35%, while in the 100 mL bioreactor, the concentration was approximately 45%. There was a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between the smallest and the largest bioreactors with both microbial consortia. It is noteworthy that the volume of hydrogen produced by the Vir consortium has always been larger than that produced by the Gal consortium. Other works have also shown that scaling-up processes increase biohydrogen productivity. Chang et al. (2002), who scaled up from 0.3L to 3L, observed a 45% increase in productivity (from 0.41 L/h/L to approx. 0.6 L/h/L). A possible explanation is that in a small reactor, high pressures of about 300 kPa can be easily achieved due to gas accumulation in the fermentation vessel, while in a larger scale, it was released to another container, and the pressure did not exceed 100 kPa. Internal pressure is an important parameter to be considered in biohydrogen production due to feedback inhibition. At high partial pressure of biohydrogen, the changes in metabolic pathways, increasing the production of lactate and solvents and decreasing hydrogen yields, while the low ones favor the H2-friendly route of butyrate (Aslam et al., 2018; Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Sydney et al., 2014). Extrapolating biohydrogen production yields with the amount of CPW generated in Brazil in 2017 (6,795,529 m3), it is estimated that approximately 10 million m3 of H2 could be produced in the country."
16,Conclusion,"New perspectives of biohydrogen production using agro-industrial by-products as single media components were presented. Besides the economic advantage of using a low-cost medium, the yields achieved with Vir and Gal consortia (107 and 83.1 mL biohydrogen/g COD, respectively) were higher than studies that used media supplemented with commercial substances. The associated environmental advantages could also be observed by the removal of 50% in the COD, which could be further increased with the recovery of the other metabolites produced, mainly acetic and butyric acids."
