0,Introduction,"Oxygen-containing organic compounds such as ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and phenols, etc., readily available from natural resources, are attractive as renewable raw materials for the production of value-added chemicals and biofuels [1,2]. For fuel applications, they require reduction in oxygen content to increase their caloric value. Much current research is focussed on deoxygenation of organic oxygenates using heterogeneous catalysis, in particular for the upgrading of biomass-derived oxygenates obtained from fermentation, hydrolysis, and fast pyrolysis of biomass [3–7]. Biomass-derived ketones can be further upgraded by aldol condensation and hydrogenation to produce alkanes that fall in the gasoline/diesel range. The hydrogenation of ketones on supported metal catalysts (e.g., Pt/C and Pd/C) to form alcohols is feasible and well documented [8]; however, further hydrogenation to alkanes is rather difficult to achieve on such catalysts [9,10]. The ketone-to-alkane hydrogenation can be achieved much easier using bifunctional metal–acid catalysts ([9–11] and references therein). This process occurs via a sequence of steps involving hydrogenation of ketone to alcohol on metal sites followed by dehydration of secondary alcohol to alkene on acid sites and finally hydrogenation of alkene to alkane on metal sites (Scheme 1 ). Previously, this group have reported that platinum on acidic supports, namely Pt on zeolite HZSM-5 [9] and acidic caesium salt of tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsPW) [10], is active bifunctional catalyst for hydrogenation of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) to the corresponding alkane 2-methylpentane (MP) in the gas phase. 0.5%Pt/CsPW, possessing very strong Brønsted acidity in addition to Pt metal sites, has been found to be particularly efficient catalyst giving 100% yield of MP at 100°C and 1bar pressure without alkane isomerisation [10]. Recently, Mizuno et al. [11] have applied this catalyst for hydrogenation of ketones, phenols, and ethers in the liquid phase at 120°C and 5bar H2 pressure. Here, we investigate the hydrogenation (hydrodeoxygenation) of a variety of ketones including aliphatic ketones and acetophenone in the gas phase using bifunctional metal–acid catalysts comprising Pt, Ru, Ni, and Cu supported on CsPW. It is demonstrated that 0.5%Pt/CsPW is a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for the ketone-to-alkane hydrogenation, and an insight into reaction mechanism is gained."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and catalysts,"2.1 Chemicals and catalysts MIBK (99%), diisobutyl ketone (80%), acetophenone (≥98%), 2-octanone (98%), cyclohexanone (≥99%), 3-pentanone (≥99%), and inorganic chemicals used for catalysts preparation were purchased from Aldrich and 2-butanone (99%) and 2-hexanone (98%) from Acros Organics. Carbon-supported platinum 10%Pt/C (7.1% Pt from ICP analysis) was from Johnson Matthey. H2 and N2 gases (>99%) were supplied by the British Oxygen Company. Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsPW) was prepared according to the literature procedure [12] by adding dropwise an aqueous solution of Cs2CO3 (0.47M) to an aqueous solution of H3PW12O40 (0.75M) at 40°C with continuous stirring. The precipitate obtained was aged in aqueous slurry for 24h at room temperature. The slurry was then slowly evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator at 45°C to afford the CsPW as a white powder. The catalyst was calcined under vacuum at 150°C/10−3 kPa for 1.5h. Bifunctional metal–acid catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of CsPW with an appropriate metal precursor (Pt(acac)2, H2PtCl6, RuCl3, Ni(NO3)2, and Cu(NO3)2) followed by reduction of metal ion to metal with H2. The metal loadings quoted were confirmed by the ICP-AES elemental analysis; these were in good agreement with the preparation stoichiometries since the preparations did not involve operations such as filtration and washing which could cause metal loss. 0.5%Pt/CsPW was prepared by stirring CsPW powder with 0.02M Pt(acac)2 solution in benzene at room temperature for 1h, followed by slow evaporation of benzene in a rotary evaporator at room temperature [13]. The catalyst was calcined under vacuum at 150°C/10−3 kPa and then reduced in an oven by a hydrogen flow at 250°C for 2h. Two other modifications of this catalyst were prepared by impregnation of CsPW with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6, followed by drying in a rotary evaporator at 45°C and the same calcination and reduction procedures. One, designated as 0.5%Pt/CsPW-I, was prepared by direct wet impregnation of CsPW powder with 0.1M aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 involving stirring the aqueous slurry for 24h at room temperature, followed by the workup procedure. The other, designated as 0.5%Pt/CsPW-A, was prepared by adding 0.1M aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 to the freshly precipitated aqueous CsPW slurry and ageing the mixture at room temperature with stirring for 24h, followed by the workup. The physical mixture of 10%Pt/C and CsPW containing 0.5% of Pt was prepared by grinding a 1:20 w/w mixture of the two components. Two modifications of 5%Ru/CsPW, designated as 5%Ru/CsPW-I and 5%Ru/CsPW-A, were prepared by impregnation of CsPW with 0.1M aqueous solution of RuCl3 similar to the preparation of 0.5%Pt/CsPW-I and 0.5%Pt/CsPW-A. 10%Cu/CsPW catalyst, designated as 10%Cu/CsPW-I, was prepared as described elsewhere [13] by stirring CsPW powder with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O for 24h at room temperature, followed by drying in a rotary evaporator at 65°C and calcination at 150°C/10−3 kPa for 1.5h. Finally, the sample was reduced in H2 flow at 400°C for 2h. Another modification of this catalyst, designated as 10%Cu/CsPW-A, was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O to the freshly precipitated aqueous CsPW slurry and ageing the mixture at room temperature with stirring for 24h, followed by the same workup. Two modifications of 10%Ni/CsPW catalyst, designated as 10%Ni/CsPW-I and 10%Ni/CsPW-A, were prepared similarly to the corresponding 10%Cu/CsPW catalysts using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as a precursor."
3,Techniques,"2.2 Techniques The BET surface area and porosity of catalysts were determined from nitrogen physisorption measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument at −196°C. Before measurement, the samples were evacuated at 250°C for 2h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of catalysts were recorded on a PANalytical Xpert diffractometer with a CuKα radiation (λ =1.542Å). XRD patterns were attributed using the JCPDS database. ICP-AES elemental analysis was carried out on a Spectro Ciros emission spectrometer. Metal dispersion of Pt and Ru in the catalysts was measured in a flow system by hydrogen chemisorption using the hydrogen–oxygen titration pulse method described previously [14]. A catalyst sample (50mg) reduced by hydrogen was pre-exposed to air at room temperature for 1h then placed in a glass sample tube connected to a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 instrument and stabilised at a specified temperature under nitrogen flow. The hydrogen–oxygen titration was carried out at room temperature for Pt catalysts and at 100°C for Ru catalysts. Fifty microliter pulses of pure H2 were injected in the N2 flow in 3min intervals until the catalyst was saturated with hydrogen. The metal dispersion, D, defined as the fraction of metal (M) at the surface, D = M s /M total, was calculated assuming the stoichiometry of H2 adsorption: MsO+1.5 H2 →MsH+H2O [15,16]. The average diameter of metal particles, d, was obtained from the empirical equation d (nm)=0.9/D [16]. For the commercial 10%Pt/C catalyst, Pt dispersion was also determined by pulse chemisorption of CO in He flow at 50°C (20mg catalyst sample, 50μL pulses of pure CO, adsorption stoichiometry Pts:CO=1). For Cu catalysts, the metal particle size was determined by XRD using the Scherrer equation, with line broadening assessed as the full width at half maximum intensity (FWHM). The dispersion of Cu particles, D, was calculated from the equation d (nm)=1.1/D [17]."
4,Catalyst testing,"2.3 Catalyst testing The hydrogenation of ketones was carried out in the gas phase in flowing H2. The catalysts were tested at 60–100°C under atmospheric pressure in a Pyrex fixed-bed down-flow reactor (9mm internal diameter) fitted with an on-line gas chromatograph (Varian Star 3400 CX instrument with a 30m×0.25mm HP INNOWAX capillary column and a flame ionisation detector). The temperature in the reactor was controlled by a Eurotherm controller using a thermocouple placed at the top of the catalyst bed. The gas feed contained a variable amount ketone in H2 as a carrier gas. The ketone was fed by passing H2 carrier gas flow controlled by a Brooks mass flow controller through a stainless steel saturator, which held the liquid ketone at appropriate temperature to maintain the chosen reactant partial pressure. The downstream gas lines and valves were heated to 180°C to prevent substrate and product condensation. The gas feed entered the reactor at the top at a flow rate of 20–100mLmin−1. The reactor was packed with 0.2g catalyst powder of 45–180μm particle size. In some cases, to reduce conversion, a smaller amount of catalyst was used as a homogeneous mixture with silica of a total weight of 0.2g. Prior to reaction, the catalysts were pre-treated in H2 for 1h at the reaction temperature unless stated otherwise. The dehydration of 2-methyl-4-pentanol was studied similarly, except using N2 as a carrier gas instead of H2. Once reaction started, the downstream gas flow was analysed by the on-line GC to obtain reactant conversion and product selectivity. The selectivity was defined as moles of product formed per one mole of reactant converted and quoted in mole per cent. The mean absolute percentage error in conversion and selectivity was ≤10% and the carbon balance was maintained within 95%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst preparation and characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterisation The catalysts studied together with their characterisation data are shown in Table 1 . To examine the effect of catalyst preparation on catalyst activity, the preparation procedure was varied regarding the use of different metal precursors and impregnation conditions (see Section 2). The metal loading of Pt and Ru was 0.5% and 5%, respectively, and 10% for Cu and Ni catalysts due to lower catalytic activity of Ru, Cu, and Ni compared to Pt. As can be seen from Table 1, the catalyst preparation procedure had little effect on the catalyst texture, whereas the metal loading had significant effect on the catalyst surface area. The catalysts had surface areas between 35 and 144m2 g−1 and low porosities typical of CsPW-based catalysts. 0.5% Pt and 5% Ru catalysts had the surface areas above 100m2 g−1, whereas 10% Ni and Cu catalysts had lower surface areas, 74–93m2 g−1 for Ni and 35m2 g−1 for Cu catalysts. Table 1 also shows metal dispersion, D, and metal particle diameter, d, in the catalysts. For Pt/CsPW and Ru/CsW catalysts, these were determined from H2 titration and for Cu/CsPW from XRD. The results for 0.5%Pt/CsPW catalysts demonstrate a strong effect of catalyst preparation on the metal dispersion. The use of Pt(acac)2 as a platinum source and benzene as a solvent for impregnation gave a Pt dispersion D =0.46 corresponding to a Pt particle diameter d =2.0nm. This dispersion was much higher than that obtained by impregnation with H2PtCl6 from aqueous solution, i.e., D =0.10–0.11 (d =8.2–9.0nm) for the Pt/CsPW-I and Pt/CsPW-A catalysts. The mode of impregnation from aqueous media, i.e., with or without ageing of the PtII–CsPW aqueous slurry, practically did not affect the Pt dispersion and particle size. The same was observed for the Ru/CsPW-I and Ru/CsPW-A. On the other hand, Cu/CsPW-A had larger Cu particles (88nm), hence a lower Cu dispersion, than Cu/CsPW-I (59nm) (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows the results of powder XRD analysis of CsPW-supported metal catalysts. The XRD of 0.5%Pt/CsPW displays only the well-known pattern of crystalline CsPW [18]; it did not reveal any Pt metal phase, which is probably due to the fine dispersion and low concentration of Pt in the catalyst. 10%Cu/CsPW-I and 10%Cu/CsPW-A exhibited sharp XRD pattern of Cu metal, with (111) and (200) reflections at 43.1 and 50.3̊, respectively, in agreement with the standard values 43.3 and 50.4̊ (JCPDS, copper 04-0836). From these, a mean diameter of 59–88nm for Cu particles was obtained using the Scherrer equation. The XRD spectra of 10%Ni/CsPW-I and 10%Ni/CsPW-A did not reveal any Ni metal phase (Fig. 1), which prevented the determination of Ni dispersion in these catalysts. The absence of Ni phase may be explained by Ni oxidation to NiO on exposure of these catalysts to air [19]. It should be noted, however, that no XRD pattern of NiO was observed either (Fig. 1), which may be explained by fine dispersion of the NiO in our catalysts. For 10%Pt/C catalyst, Pt dispersion and particle size were determined from CO chemisorption (D =0.44±0.07, d =2.0nm, average of three measurements); these values are in agreement with many literature reports. It should be noted that H2 titration overestimated Pt dispersion for this catalyst to give a value of D =1.2±0.1. This may be explained by hydrogen spillover onto the carbon support, which has been reported previously ([20] and references therein). XRD was also unable to determine correctly the size of Pt particles. 10%Pt/C exhibited a clear pattern of the Pt fcc phase, with 39.8 (111), 46.3 (200), and 67.5 (220) reflections (Fig. 1), from which the particle size was estimated to be d =28±5nm (average of three measurements, D =0.032). This implies that the XRD was biased towards larger Pt particles. Previous H2-TPR, XRD, and FTIR studies have shown that CsPW in Pt/CsPW and Pd/CsPW catalysts is resistant to reduction by H2 below 600°C, and the primary (Keggin) structure of CsPW is retained in CsPW-supported Pt, Pd, and Cu catalysts after H2 treatment at 400°C [13]."
7,Hydrogenation of MIBK over CsPW-supported metal catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogenation of MIBK over CsPW-supported metal catalysts The hydrogenation of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was studied in more detail using CsPW-supported Pt, Ru, Ni, and Cu catalysts in order to optimise catalyst preparation and gain an insight into reaction mechanism. Representative results are shown in Table 2 . CsPW alone in the absence of metal exhibited very low activity at 80–100°C. As found previously [10], non-acidic metal catalysts, such as Pt/C and Ru/C, are active in hydrogenation of MIBK to alcohol, 2-methyl-4-pentanol (MP-ol), at 100°C, but further hydrogenation to alkane, 2-methypentane (MP) becomes feasible only at temperatures as high as 300°C. In contrast, bifunctional metal–acid catalyst 0.5%Pt/CsPW, prepared from Pt(acac)2 in benzene solution, showed excellent activity in MIBK hydrogenation, giving 100% MP yield at 100°C and 1bar pressure (Table 2). No MP isomerisation was observed at this temperature. It can be seen that both 0.5%Pt/CsPW-I and 0.5%Pt/CsPW-A, prepared from H2PtCl6 in aqueous solution, were less active than the 0.5%Pt/CsPW catalyst (cf. MIBK conversions at 60 and 80°C). This may be explained by the higher Pt dispersion in 0.5%Pt/CsPW (Table 1) and the presence of chloride in 0.5%Pt/CsPW-I and 0.5%Pt/CsPW-A. Reaction selectivity was greatly affected by the temperature. At 60°C, MP-ol was the main product, whereas at 100°C, MP was formed in almost 100% yield, in agreement with the previous report [10]. This suggests the change of the rate-limiting step with increasing the temperature (see below). 5%Ru/CsPW-I and 5%Ru/CsPW-A exhibited close activities in MIBK hydrogenation (Table 2). These catalysts matched 0.5%Pt/CsPW in activity and selectivity at 100°C, but at a ten times higher metal loading, in agreement with the previous report [10], yet they were considerably less active than 0.5%Pt/CsPW at lower temperatures 60–80°C. Ni/CsPW and Cu/CsPW catalysts were much less active, showing a moderate activity at 350°C, with Ni being more active than Cu. The mode of preparation of these catalysts, i.e., with or without ageing of CsPW and metal precursor aqueous slurry, had little effect on their performance. It should be noted that since the non-metal doped CsPW support also showed some catalytic activity (Table 2), the activity of Ni/CsPW and Cu/CsPW could to some extent be attributed to the CsPW rather than to the Ni and Cu. Therefore, the activity of the catalysts studied in terms of MIBK conversion per unit metal weight decreased in the order: Pt>Ru>>Ni>Cu. The 0.5%Pt/CsPW catalyst, prepared from Pt(acac)2 as a platinum source in benzene solution, showed the best performance in the MIBK-to-MP hydrogenation. The time course shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates stable catalytic activity of 0.5%Pt/CsPW in MIBK hydrogenation for 2.5h on stream. Previously, extended stability tests showed no catalyst deactivation at least for 14h on stream [10]. The reaction obeys the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy E a =69kJmol−1 in the temperature range 80–110°C where MP is by far the main reaction product (Fig. 3 ). The high activation energy indicates that the reaction occurred under kinetic control. This is supported by the Weisz–Prater analysis [21] of the reaction system. Assuming spherical catalyst particles and Knudsen diffusion regime, the Weisz–Prater criterion was calculated to be C WP =1.2×10−2 <1 indicating no internal diffusion limitations. Other results reported previously [10], such as the close to zero reaction order in MIBK and MIBK conversion scaling almost linearly with the Pt loading in the catalyst, are also in agreement with reaction occurring under kinetic control. Table 3 compares the performances of bifunctional catalyst 0.5%Pt/CsPW having metal and acid sites in a rather close proximity to each other and the corresponding 1:20 w/w physical mixture of 10%Pt/C and CsPW containing 0.5% of Pt, in which metal and acid sites are a longer distance apart. It can be seen that these two catalysts give very similar MIBK conversions in the temperature range of 60–100°C. This indicates that the reaction is not limited by migration of intermediates between metal and acid sites in the bifunctional catalyst [22]; hence, the metal and acid sites are not required to be located in close proximity for the reaction to occur. It should be noted, however, that the 0.5%Pt/CsPW catalyst produced more by-products (C1–C5 hydrocarbons and C6+ condensation products) than the mixed 10%Pt/C+CsPW catalyst (Table 3)."
8,Dehydration of 2-methyl-4-pentanol over CsPW,"3.3 Dehydration of 2-methyl-4-pentanol over CsPW The dehydration of the secondary alcohol MP-ol is the second step in MIBK hydrogenation through the bifunctional metal–acid-catalysed pathway (Scheme 1). It was studied to obtain knowledge about the rate-limiting step in the MIBK hydrogenation. MP-ol dehydration over CsPW was found to yield two 2-methylpentene isomers with high selectivity (Scheme 2 ). MP-ol conversion increased with increasing the temperature to reach 100% above 80°C (Table 4 ). The reaction was found to be close to zero order in MP-ol (0.15 order) in the MP-ol partial pressure range of 1–3kPa (Fig. 4 ). Previously, zero order in alcohol has been observed for isopropanol dehydration over CsPW [23]. The activation energy of MP-ol dehydration was found to be E a =130kJmol−1 in the temperature range of 60–80°C (determined under differential conditions at MP-ol conversion X =0.8–12%). Previously, it has been suggested that MIBK-to-MP hydrogenation over Pt/CsPW at 100°C is limited by the first step, i.e., hydrogenation of MIBK to MP-ol (Scheme 1). This is mainly based on the fact that reaction rate scales with Pt loading, while MP selectivity remains constant ∼100% [10]. The results on MP-ol dehydration obtained here fully support this view. First, the MP-ol dehydration is fast at 100°C; and second, it has much higher activation energy that the MIBK-to-MP hydrogenation. Consequently, at lower temperatures, ∼60°C, MIBK-to-MP hydrogenation appears to be limited by MP-ol dehydration, resulting in formation of MP-ol as the main product. At higher temperatures, ∼100°C, the MP-ol dehydration step, having higher activation energy, becomes faster than the MIBK-to-MP-ol hydrogenation step. The latter becomes the rate-limiting step, which results in high MP selectivity. The last step in Scheme 1, i.e., 2-methylpentene hydrogenation, appears to be fast, which is supported by the absence of 2-methylpentenes in the products of MIBK hydrogenation. Alkene hydrogenation is known to be significantly exothermic and fast, especially on Pt catalysts ([24] and references therein). The heat of hydrogenation of 4-methyl-1-pentene has been reported tobe −121kJmol−1 [24]. Therefore, hydrogenation of ketones to alkenes rather than to alkanes via metal–acid bifunctional pathway on a single catalyst bed is not feasible. This could be better achieved by a consecutive two-step process with ketone-to-alcohol hydrogenation on a metal catalyst as the first step followed by alcohol dehydration on an acid catalyst as the second step."
9,Hydrogenation of aliphatic ketones over Pt/CsPW,"3.4 Hydrogenation of aliphatic ketones over Pt/CsPW Table 5 shows the results for hydrogenation of C3–C9 aliphatic ketones over 0.5%Pt/CsPW. It can be seen that these ketones reacted very similarly to MIBK. At 60°C, alcohols were the main products, except for the higher C8–C9 ketones 2-octanone and diisobutyl ketone, which gave mainly the corresponding alkanes. The latter indicates that the corresponding C8–C9 alcohols were easier to dehydrate over CsPW as compared to the alcohols related to the lower ketones. At 100°C, all ketones gave the corresponding alkanes in high yields 87–100%. Therefore, 0.5%Pt/CsPW is a versatile bifunctional catalyst for the gas-phase hydrogenation of aliphatic ketones to alkanes."
10,Hydrogenation of acetophenone over Pt/CsPW,"3.5 Hydrogenation of acetophenone over Pt/CsPW Acetophenone is an example of aromatic ketone, and its hydrogenation is more complicated than that of aliphatic ketones regarding the reaction selectivity and catalyst stability. The hydrogenation of acetophenone through bifunctional metal–acid-catalysed pathway can be represented by Scheme 3 . Two bifunctional catalysts were tested at 100°C: 0.5%Pt/CsPW and 1:20 w/w mixture of 10%Pt/C and CsPW. The results are shown in Table 6 . Both catalysts gave ethylcyclohexane and ethylbenzene as the main products. It should be noted that no 1-phenylethanol and styrene was observed amongst the products, which can be explained by their high reactivity. Thus, 1-phenylethanol is known to be dehydrated much easier than aliphatic secondary alcohols [25]. Initially, 0.5%Pt/CsPW gave 98% selectivity to ethylcyclohexane at 74% acetophenone conversion (73% yield). However, this catalyst suffered from deactivation, resulting in significant loss in conversion and ethylcyclohexane selectivity over time on stream. After 6h, the conversion dropped to 59%, and ethylcyclohexane selectivity to 19% in favour of ethylbenzene (81%). In contrast, the 10%Pt/C+CsPW mixed catalyst showed very little deactivation with time, yielding 74–77% of ethylcyclohexane and only 3–5% of ethylbenzene over 5h on stream (Table 6). The poor stability of 0.5%Pt/CsPW to deactivation may be due to blocking Pt sites by adsorption of acetophenone and/or ethylbenzene on the neighbouring strong proton sites of CsPW."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, we have investigated the gas-phase hydrogenation of a wide range of ketones to alkanes, including hydrogenation of aliphatic ketones and acetophenone, using bifunctional metal–acid catalysis. The bifunctional catalysts comprise Pt, Ru, Ni, and Cu metals supported on acidic caesium salt of tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsPW). The reaction occurs via a sequence of steps involving hydrogenation of ketone to alcohol on metal sites followed by dehydration of alcohol to alkene on acid sites and finally hydrogenation of alkene to alkane on metal sites. Catalyst activity has been shown to decrease in the order: Pt>Ru>>Ni>Cu. 0.5%Pt/CsPW has been demonstrated to be versatile catalyst for the hydrogenation of aliphatic ketones, giving almost 100% alkane yield at 100°C and 1bar pressure. Evidence has been provided that the reaction with Pt/CsPW at 100°C is limited by ketone-to-alcohol hydrogenation, whereas at lower temperatures (≤60°C) by alcohol dehydration resulting in alcohol formation as the main product. The catalyst comprising of a physical mixture of 10%Pt/C+CsPW has been found to be highly efficient as well, which indicates that the reaction is not limited by migration of intermediates between metal and acid sites in the bifunctional catalyst. The mixed 10%Pt/C+CsPW shows better performance stability in acetophenone hydrogenation compared to the Pt/CsPW catalyst, which suffers from deactivation."
