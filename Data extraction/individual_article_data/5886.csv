0,Introduction,"In current years, scientists, researchers, and manufacturers have been looking for the renewable and clean feedstock for fuel production processes aiming to satisfy the strict requirements of the sustainable development progress and strategy of the modern society in the future. They found that biomass could be a potential feedstock for conventional fossil fuels to provide good sources of feedstock for the manufacturing of high-quality liquid fuels and value-added chemical products [1,2]. Found in a wide range of forms in the agriculture, forestry, and industry manufacturing process, as well as urban and rural waste, these biomass-based materials are praised for their affordability and accessibility [3], as well as their large known reserves and global distribution [4]. Besides, the utilization of biomass for bioenergy production was found to yield significant sustainability improvements in terms of lower costs and lower CO2 emissions. Due to these benefits, researchers have increasingly put forth considerable efforts in thoroughly examining the potential of catalytic conversion of biomass to bioenergy [5,6]. Being a key part in the bioenergy production from biomass, experts have agreed on the promising role of biofuels in providing an intermediary solution in the transition toward a clean energy economy although a large number of carbon-free energy sources have yet to reach the sufficient level of technological maturity required for commercialization. Among the existing biomass-based biofuels, ethanol is the only viable alternative to gasoline that can be produced on an industrial scale [7]. Most types of commercially sold ethanol contain lower ethanol content within the fuel mixture. Even though ethanol offers cleaner combustion relative to gasoline and diesel in engines, there are several shortcomings in ethanol application which overshadows its robustness and easy integration in available fossil fuel-based internal combustion engines [8]. Ethanol has a lower energy density and more volatile relative to gasoline while facing a higher risk of water contamination in the ethanol fuel mixtures and increased production costs associated with its manufacturing and distillation process. As energy researchers continue to be motivated by the urgent need of finding alternative transport fuels to fossil fuels, namely gasoline and diesel, efforts are put forth in advancing the key research into the second generation of biofuels. In searching for an alternative to conventional fossil-based transportation fuels, researchers have focused much of their recent attention on 2-methylfuran (MF) as a promising second-generation biofuel that can be used in existing internal combustion engines [9]. Technological advances in the production of biomass-derived MF have reached significant milestones, while the latest MF synthesis methods have demonstrated the potential of scaling up the commercial operation of MF production [10–12]. In contrast to other conventional biofuels, MF is considered a renewable fuel that does not directly compete for resources required for food production [13–15]. As shown in Table 1 , comparisons among MF, biofuels, and other types of furan derivatives in terms of their physicochemical characteristics can be examined. It could be seen from Table 1 that MF exhibits similar physicochemical characteristics to gasoline, it benefits from the ease of application in internal combustion engines. On the other hand, the combustion of MF outperforms that of other bioethanol varieties due to its lower latent heating of vaporization. Besides, the lower water solubility of MF reduces the risk of atmospheric water contamination in the fuel mixture while enhancing its stability and securing a contamination-free storage condition [21]. Compared to bioethanol, it is more fuel-efficient in combusting MF due to the latter fuel's 34% higher energy density. The application of MF has shown to be highly suitable in spark ignition (SI) or compression ignition (CI) engines with a high compression ratio given the preferable octane and cetane number [22,23]. Based on these findings, there are several benefits to MF applications in existing gasoline and diesel engines [16,24]. Even though there have been numerous numbers of MF-related research on ignition properties, combustion mechanism, synthesis process of MF, several gaps in the current understanding of MF as an alternative transportation fuel yet to be addressed. There were studies supporting the positive benefit of adding MF into either diesel or gasoline blend to lower soot emissions. However, how the presence of MF affects the reactivity and combustion mechanism in engines has not been examined in those studies. Among the existing literature on MF, several questions have been raised on the potential reactions of MF and other hydrocarbons leading to the increased difficulty and complexity in model reduction. Besides, there is also an unknown risk over the potential release of toxic substances from MF combustion. Furthermore, particular attention should be focused on the enhancement of current MF chemical kinetic models concerning the accuracy in predicting the ignition delay time and laminar burning velocity. More importantly, consideration should also be paid to the different mechanisms, reactions, and catalysts observed in the synthesis of MF as advances in technology and methods continue to provide improvement on the overall production efficiency. For these reasons, the current paper provides a timely and appropriate overview of the MF and possible pathways linking the synthesis, combustion progress, and application of MF in internal combustion engines. According to the above-mentioned perspective, the framework of this review paper is to focus on the production-to-application pathway of MF biofuel with seven main sections, in which the gap relating to MF biofuel was critically presented in the Introduction section to highlight the necessity and importance of this work. In the second section, the catalyst-based synthesis process of MF from biomass sources through the furfural intermediate was also mentioned in detail. Moreover, the pyrolysis and oxidation mechanism, and ignition behaviors of MF under various reaction conditions were thoroughly analyzed in the third section aiming to clarify the applicability of MF in internal combustion engine as well as the pathway of emission formation in the combustion process. More importantly, the spray, performance, combustion and emission characteristics, and tribology behaviors of internal combustion engine fueled with MF-based fuels were comprehensively discussed in the fourth section. Besides, economic aspect, and existing challenges and future perspective were evaluated and presented in fifth and sixth section, respectively. Finally, the key conclusions were indicated in the last section to have an insight and overview into potential MF biofuel."
1,Catalyst-based MF synthesis,"Advancing the current utilization of renewable biomass resources plays a significant role in reducing the dependence on fossil fuel energy while taking advantage of the efficient use of widely abundant supplies of biomass feedstock. Recently, researchers and industry stakeholders alike have focused much of their attention on the industrial application of biomass-derived furfural in future biorefinery processing. Furthermore, the current rate of production can process up to 20 million tons of furfural on an annual basis through the dehydration of hemicelluloses such as xylose and arabinose [25]. Moreover, utilizing various reaction pathways, the processing of furfural can yield a wide range of valuable chemical products [26,27]. Considering the close chemistry between derivatives of furan-based chemicals and biomass, the latter plays a significant role as intermediaries and/or raw materials for the production of platform molecules [28]. Several investigations have set out to synthesize furan derivatives from biomass, namely furfural [29–31]. As part of the fuel synthesis process, a pretreatment step is often performed by hydrolyzing the cellulosic and hemicellulosic components present in hemicellulosic biomass to derive sugar alcohols, such as xylitol, sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, or maltitol [32–34]. The subsequent reactions enable the conversion of these intermediate products into various fuel components [35,36]. In examining the possible reaction pathways, researchers have placed particular interest in the selective hydrogenation of furfural to MF. Due to its versatile application, MF can be used as intermediates in the production of insecticides, perfumes, antimalarial medication, and other fuel additives [37]. According to current methods, MF can be derived from either vapor-phase or liquid-phase hydrogenation. Between these, vapor-phase hydrogenation is more commonly found in the current literature, while studies on liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions remain limited [38]. Generally, possible MF synthesis pathways from biomass via furfural as intermediate are depicted in Fig. 1 ."
2,Biomass pretreatment,"2.1 Biomass pretreatment Because of the high level of complexity and structural relationship among the main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass, it is known to be a challenging task in breaking down biomass that necessitates the increased level of energy required for their disintegration [39,40]. Out of the three primary components of lignocellulosic biomass, the production of furfural relies significantly on the availability of hemicellulose. Hence, pretreatment processes hold a relevant role in effectively rendering better yield and higher selectivity of furfural from hemicellulose found in lignocellulosic biomass. Currently, there are three types of pre-treatment, including physical, chemical and biological methods [41,42]. The physical approach utilizes the primary mean of mechanical force and/or heat in breaking down the structure of the biomass while applying additional processes, such as grinding, milling, or steam explosion of fiber, to further decrease the size of its particle [43,44]. On the other hand, the biological approach relies on the use of microbes or fungal enzymes that are responsible for biomass digestion [45,46]. Last but not least, the use of ionic liquids, dilute acids, bases, and other reagents among the chemical pre-treatment approach to sever the existing chemical bonds in the biomass components and structure [47]. In recent years, extensive research has focused on the biochemical and thermal-chemical conversion techniques as part of the biofuel synthesis from biomass [48,49]. Among the reviewed method, thermal liquefaction has demonstrated its effectiveness in yielding low molecular weight liquid products, as well as gaseous fuel and solid residue. Pyrolysis and solvolysis are the two commonly used thermal liquefaction methods in the synthesis of biofuels and chemical byproducts from biomass [50,51]. In selecting the appropriate pretreatment method, it is important to take into account the use and purpose in the application of the post-treatment products [52]. Depending on the chosen pretreatment method, the process can significantly affect several key characteristics of hemicellulose derived from biomass, including the degree of polymerization, reactivity, purity, and solubility [53]."
3,Conversion biomass to furfural-based intermediate,"2.2 Conversion biomass to furfural-based intermediate Recent studies have focused on the potential role of furfural as a promising biomass platform molecule that can be derived from wide selections of non-food lignocellulosic biomass sources [27,54]. A wide range of later-stage derivatives and value-added substances can be yielded from the transformation of the furan ring and –CHO group via reactions, such as hydrogenation, oxidation, polymerization, amination, and nitration [38,55]. Particularly, selective hydrogenolysis presents a promising approach to increase the value of the process by yielding high value-added products, for example, furfuryl, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, MF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, or cyclopentanone [56,57]. Like many other oxygenated compounds, furfural also possesses both CC and CO bonds. The stability of the CC bond is supported by the close positioning to one of the stabilized systems consisting of a 5 member ring and 6 electrons [58,59]. On the other hand, CO bonds are more likely to react when undergoing hydrogenation that leads to the primary formation of furfuryl alcohol. Besides, MF can be obtained from the subsequent hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol [60]. Fig. 2 has presented the comparison of hydrolysis-based conversion steps of lignocellulosic biomass to potential biofuels such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and MF. The fact shows that there are often two different stages that make up the production of furfural from hemicellulose [62]. In the first stage, polysaccharides are converted into simple sugar via hydrolysis. At the same time, the initial process initiates the breaking up of xylan into monomer xylose. Next, furfural is obtained from the transformation of xylose via a dehydration process in which three H2O molecules are removed from the monosaccharide following the reaction of 5H10O5 → C5H4O2 + 3H2O [63]. Hence, the use of xylose as the model compound in the synthesis of furfural has gained significant traction among the latest studies. To enhance the overall efficiency of furfural synthesis from xylose, researchers have looked to solvent-thermal conversion as one of the preferred techniques. The promise of a more sustainable, biomass-derived “green solvent” has increasingly attracted much attention from current researchers as they continue working toward achieving alternative solutions to fossil-based solvents [64]. Several solvent options are available, including H2O, GVL, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF), and DMSO that can be applied in the production of furfural from xylose [65–67]. However, researchers have confirmed the higher effectiveness of GVL, which can be identified as a potential biomass-derived green solvent, in the conversion process of hemicellulose. In one study, Mellmer et al. observed the behavior of polar aprotic organic solvents used in the acid-catalyzed conversion of xylose into furfural through chemical kinetics [68]. The authors recorded the rise in both reaction rates and an elevated selectivity of product in the application of GVL as the primary solvent. Furthermore, changes in the activation energies required for the probe reaction (i.e., the process of converting xylose to furfural through dehydration) were also recorded in the same study. In a different investigation, a quicker dehydration reaction of xylose was confirmed for GVL solvent relative to that of water, in which the use of GVL as a solvent was found to reduce the risk of producing unwanted chemicals and increases the yield of furfural up to 70% [65]. Some studies also found the added benefits of using a GVL/H2O co-solvent system to enhance the overall conversion of furfural from hemicellulose [69]. Other approaches also include the addition of SBP and DMSO in water to create aqueous two-phase systems to improve the effectiveness of furfural conversion from hemicellulose [70]. To increase furfural yield, several homogeneous catalysts have been utilized within the solvent-thermal conversion of pure hemicellulose. Over the past several decades, much focus has been on the use of high-purity reagent grade xylose and xylan instead of raw biomass for the conversion of furfural that eliminates much of the complexity of the analysis. Studies have examined the use of homogeneous catalysts, such as mineral acids [71] and metal chlorides [72] in the synthesis of furfural. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are two commonly used mineral acid catalysts in the current commercial-scale manufacturing of furfural [56]. In one example, it was reported that using H2SO4 as a catalyst in the production of furfural for a 5-h duration at 150 °C resulted in an approximate 50% yield while comparable yields have been indicated for several other commonly used methods [73]. The primary reason for the less than stellar result can be suspected from the presence of solid humins as a result of unwanted polymerization reactions [74]. In observing a microwave-supported reaction, Yemis et al. recorded 36.5 wt% furfural yielded from the conversion of xylan to furfural which was catalyzed by 0.1 M HCl at 180 °C for a 30-min duration [71]. Furthermore, upon examining the role of different Brønsted acids on the furfural yield obtained from the conversion of xylan, HCl has demonstrated its superior performance as a conversion catalyst. Among the different acid catalysts, the highest yield (around 65%) was obtained from an HCl catalyst at 170 °C [29]. Particularly, an impressive 84.8% yield of furfural when adding AlCl3 at 170 °C for 10 s [75]. On the other hand, Marcotullio and De Jong confirmed the positive effect of Cl− ions in the dehydration rate of xylose to furfural in an acid-based aqueous environment. Hence, the improvement in both furfural yield and selectivity subjected to the traditional mode of heating [59]. Microwave-assisted heating has been utilized in examining the role of sodium chloride on the dehydration rate of xylose to furfural which achieves a 76% yield in the dehydration of xylose at 200 °C in less than 8 min [76]. On the investigation of the disintegration and transformation process of hemicellulose to furfural, researchers have also examined the behavior of the three primary constituents of raw biomass within the conversion process. In one instance, the transformation of hemicellulose content of birch wood was performed using a dilute H2SO4 hydrolysis process that resulted in 11.09 wt% furfural after reaching 147 °C for 90 min [77]. A laboratory-based synthesis of soluble was conducted by Luterbacher et al. [78] using raw biomass derived from corn stover, hardwood, and softwood. The experiment yielded between 70% and 90% of furfural from the solvent mixture of GVL, H2O, and 0.05 wt% H2SO4. Upon the separation of the aqueous phase from the organic/water biphasic system containing NaCl, the additional treatment with AlCl3 and SBP resulted in 70 wt% furfural relative to the initial weight of C5 sugars in biomass at 170 °C [78]. In their study, Li et al. applied a GVL-solvent and 0.1% H2SO4-catalyzed process in converting corn cob to furfural. An excellent yield of 99.5% was confirmed from the synthesis process upon reaching 190 °C for 20 min in duration [79]. Despite the good results, the high corrosivity of mineral acids coupled with the inability to recycle the materials have limited much of their potential applications [80,81]. The use of homogeneous acid catalysts can pose a serious environmental problem due to the release of unwanted chemical substances as a major source of pollution. Indeed, the presence of such catalyst presents an imminent environmental and public health hazard as they are often nearly impossible to recovered and properly disposed of upon the completion of the conversion process [69,82]. Investigation on the use of heterogeneous catalysts to enhance furfural production efficiency has also been conducted. Particularly, the use of solid acid catalysts has been shown to yield comparable levels of furfural while also possessing a regenerative property [83,84]. To overcome the issues raised in the application of homogeneous catalysts, several heterogeneous catalysts have been formulated to be used in the synthesis of furfural, including sulfonic acid functionalized mesoporous SBA-15 materials [85] and modified zeolites [86]. To prepare arene sulfonic SBA-15 catalysts, two simultaneous condensation reactions are initiated in the dehydration process of d-xylose to furfural [85]. As a result, an 82% yield of furfural was obtained from d-xylose submerged in a water/toluene mixture subjected to a 160 °C temperature and 99% selectivity. Among the solid catalysts, zeolites received the most attention in the existing works due to their high thermal and chemical stability and tunable acidities, the application of ion-exchange resins in the synthesis of furfural can achieve an average yield of 40–70% [87]. On average, below 40% yield of furfural was obtained among the investigation on the use of several H-zeolites in water, water/methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), water/toluene, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that were conducted in a batch reactor under a temperature range of 140–170 °C [88]. A slight improvement in furfural yield (up to 46%) was achieved in the experiment conducted by Neill et al. [89], in which an innovative form of zeolite catalyst (ZSM-5) was formulated in H+ form. The catalytic conversion was performed in a batch reactor between 140 °C and 220 °C. On the other hand, dehydration of xylose can also be performed using sulfonated metal oxides and ion-exchange resins. Among the common sulfonate as a result of the reactions of metal oxides (such as TiO2, ZrO2, SnO2, and Al2O3) and H2SO4, the highest conversion efficiency and furfural production could be observed in SnO2 [90]. Compared to standalone zeolite catalysts, the use of SO42−/ZrO2–TiO2 has proved to be more advantageous in terms of furfural production [91]. Furthermore, the addition of TiO2 in nano-cellulose has been shown to improve the overall process of converting cellulose to glucose [92]. Due to the preferred catalytic qualities, carbon-based solid acids can effectively enhance the dehydration of xylose into furfural due to the enhanced accessibility to xylose attributed to the high specific surface area and porosity of solid acids. Furthermore, the use of solid acids catalysts can also benefit from the overall better chemical and thermal stability as well as improved electron conductivity [93–95]. The initial carbonization of the carbonaceous substance usually occurs upon successful impregnation using either an acid, a strong base, or salt to activate the chemical reactions [96]. Varying oxygen functionality can be observed that are much dependent on the acid-base properties of the carbon-based material. Several factors, including acidity, specific surface area, degree of porosity, and pore size volume, can exert considerable influence over the behavior and overall effectiveness of the carbon-based solid catalysts [97]. In their study, Lam et al. [98] were able to obtain an approximately 63% furfural yield upon the application of a water-resistant carbon-based solid catalyst sulfonated with graphene oxide with 2% catalyst loading that was subjected to 75% selectivity and 200 °C in temperature for 35 min. Under similar conditions, such as catalyst loading, reaction time and temperature, single-use of either graphene, graphene oxide and sulfonated graphene has fallen short of returning a better furfural yield compared to sulfonated graphene oxide (i.e., 51,53 and 55%, respectively). The use of organic/aqueous biphasic systems (i.e., 2-methyltetrahydrofuran/H2O) was recorded by Wang et al. to achieve the best furfural yield of 78.1% that utilized SnCl4 as the main catalyst under the following reaction conditions, including 150 °C temperature and 2 h reaction time [99]. Also using xylan as the primary substance, Yang et al. were successful in performing the furfural synthesis process when applying microwave heat to the H2O- tetrahydrofurfuryl biphasic system containing xylan, AlCl3·6H2O and NaCl that yielded 64% of furfural as a result [100]. In a different experiment, furfural synthesis from xylan was carried out using a GVL/H2O solvent system. Yang et al. confirmed a furfural yield of 87.8% under a microwave heated and Al2(SO4)3 catalyzed conversion process at 130 °C [101]. This result further confirms the important role that different varieties of Brønsted acids and Lewis acids can have on the conversion of furfural from xylan in a GVL/H2O system. Furthermore, much lower furfural yields were obtained from the remaining three organic solvents, including MIBK, tetrahydrofurfuryl, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran when compared to GVL. Hence, it can be concluded that certain organic-based solvents are more preferred for their catalytic properties in the conversion of furfural from xylan [101]. The use of SO42−/Sn-MMT, a solid acid catalyst, in a heterogeneous catalytic conversion was recorded in Lin et al. [102]. The study confirmed the highest yield of furfural at 77.25% from xylan conversion under a 2-methyltetrahydrofuran/NaCl–H2O biphasic system at 160 °C. Possible added benefits can be obtained from the application of the SO42−/Sn-MMT system as it possesses both Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites that could enhance the overall reaction efficiency. In general, the furfural synthesis from biomass and its components could be given in Table 2 ."
4,Conversion furfural to MF,"2.3 Conversion furfural to MF MF synthesis can be performed by the selective hydrodeoxygenation of furfural without risking the modification of the ring double bonds [38]. Over the past decade, the production of MF has benefited from the advances made to the catalyst systems used in the conversion of furfural to MF via either H2-supported direct hydrogenation or IPA-supported catalytic transfer hydrogenation. Without any doubt, the role of catalysts is integral to the promotion of the MF synthesis and enhancement of conversion efficiency. The application of bi-functional catalysts is considered a typical requirement in the production process of MF. Furthermore, the existing metal-acid synergistic relationship is viewed as the main influencing mechanism in MF synthesis. As the conversion process unfolds, the presence of metallic ions or atoms is responsible for the creation of balance sites supported by the correlation between the metal and acid components. Furthermore, the construction of several acidic sites can also be noted to a certain extent that often necessitates the availability of sparsely populated metal sites [121]. 2.3.1 Noble metal-based catalysts Studies have shown the potential of noble metals playing in the catalytic hydrogenation process. For products that require deep hydrogenation such as MF, the conversion process often requires higher levels of reactivity and efficiency while being subjected to comparably less extreme conditions. The use of noble metal catalysts can ensure the above requirements for MF synthesis. Given that the limited availability of noble metal-derived materials in nature, there is a strong need for existing works on noble metals to focus on performance optimization and reusability of such materials to improve the overall value of the accessible resources [122]. Some of the rare and highly valuable first-row transition metals, such as Pt, Ru, and Pd, make outstanding sources of metal-based catalysts [123,124]. Chen et al. [125] provided an excellent overview of the use of Pd-based catalysts in the synthesis of MF from furfural which relied heavily on factors related to Pd loading, particle size, and solvent selection. According to the same study, the synthesis of MF from furfural can occur in two different pathways, including furfuryl alcohol and another path consisting of intermediates from alkoxy derivatives [125]. In the case of furfuryl alcohol acting as the primary substrate, studies have demonstrated the potential of TiO2-supported Pd (up to 5 wt%) to achieve an exceptional yield of MF (up to 98%) compared to other Pd-based catalysts included in the experiment [126]. In paring with the choice of Pd/TiO2 catalyst, the use of 1,2- dichloroethane as the solvent in the reaction has also shown the best result in MF synthesis [125]. Similarly, the study of Hermans et al. also showed the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural catalyzed by Pd/Fe2O3 resulted in an MF yield of 62% [127]. Much lower levels of MF selectivity were obtained from other studies utilizing boron-doped Pd/C catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural. Even though the modification to the product selectivity could be achieved (i.e., ring hydrogenation and decarbonylation) by adjusting the size of the catalyst particles, the application of the Pd/C catalyst failed short of attaining the highest selectivity of the MF product in the hydrodeoxygenation of furfural. Both Cu- and Pd-based materials are preferred catalysts for their observed characteristics. On the one hand, the hydrogenation of the aldehyde and methyl group can be sufficiently supported by the presence of Cu-based catalysts. On the other hand, Pd-based catalysts demonstrate excellent properties in the hydrogenation of the unsaturated CO bond or the furan ring [128]. Hence, it can be reasoned for the integration of both Cu- and Pd-based catalyst in forming a multi-purpose catalyst for the synthesis of furfural. As a case in point, the synthesis of MF from furfural performed in Xin et al. provided a demonstration of the application of a bimetallic Cu–Pd catalyst that was supported by the availability of 2-propanol as the primary hydrogen donor [129]. The authors observed the highest achievable level of catalytic activities at 220 °C over 4 h resulting in a total yield of MF and MTHF up to 83.9%. Depending on the modification of Pd ratios in the Cu–Pd catalyst, either MF or MTHF could be selected as the primary output. More recently, Obaid has demonstrated the ability to achieve a selective transformation of furfuryl alcohol to MF with the help of highly active Au/Pd catalysts under ambient temperature and low-pressure conditions [130]. During the conversion, only the hydrodeoxygenation process was detected having minimal effect on the number of CC bonds (Fig. 3 a). Besides, the only by-product obtained from the process was tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol <6%. Overall, the selective hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol was made possible by the introduction of Au/Pd supported catalysts that achieved the highest possible yield of MF (i.e., 92%) (Fig. 3b) [130]. Among the current hydrogenolysis of furfural to MF, the use of Ru-based monometallic catalysts is among the popular approach. Besides, the synthesis of MF can also benefit from the presence of a Ru-based catalyst. In one study, the positive role of commercial-grade Ru/C catalysts has been demonstrated in the production of MF from furfural, in which Panagiotopoulou et al. confirmed the influential role of reaction temperature and the choice of solvents having on the synthesis process [124]. Particularly, the authors recorded the highest MF yield of 61% upon the reaction temperature reaching 180 °C and 2-propanol acting as the primary solvent. The formation of 2-MF from furfural was attributed to the presence of both RuOx and metallic Ru that allowing for access to the active sites. Similar results could be examined in another study that showed a comparable effect in the presence of Pd2+ and Pd sites and their role in MF synthesis [131]. Within the same aforementioned study, an assessment on the stability of the Ru/C catalyst was conducted by Panagiotopoulou et al. A lower reactivity was observed in recycled catalyst relative to fresh and unused catalyst because of the drop in the number of RuOx taking place during the production process. The used catalyst was subjected to a renewal process similar to that applied to the fresh catalysts. An initial 3-h reduction occurring at 300 °C under a stream of hydrogen was then followed by a 3-h oxidation process at 300 °C subjected to a 5% O2/He flow [124]. The above-mentioned results could be explained that the presence of the bifunctional catalyst as a result of the oxidation of Ru/C allows for the concurrent formation of both metallic (Ru) and Lewis acid (RuOx) active sites which are significant for the formation of MF [132,133]. Hence, the process is deemed effective without the need for hydrogenation of the furan ring or severing of the C–C bonds. A mechanistic study could be found in the study of Matthew et al. [134], in which the possible reaction pathways in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural were explored in the presence of slightly oxidized Ru/C catalyst (Ru/RuOx/C). The study also confirmed the two possible routes in obtaining MF through the breaking up of the C–OH bonds in furfuryl alcohol as a result of hydrogenolysis. Fig. 4 a depicts both the direct and indirect path through the activation of the aromatic ring. Under the direct route, the dissociation of the C–OH bonds often provides the initial steps for the introduction of an adsorbed H-atom on the metallic sites [134]. Moreover, the direct hydrogenolysis route which utilizes 2-propanol-d8 has been observed to result in the generation of MF possing a 1D atom connected to C1 resulting in the change in the mass of the parent ion of MF by 1 amu. In a different investigation, the role of cobalt oxide-supported Ru (Ru/Co3O4) was observed in providing the sites for the formation of MF. The study also confirmed a high MF yield of 92.5% [61]. While Ru particles could be seen as the active component in the hydrogen activation and hydrogenation reaction, the presence of CoOx was integral to the breaking up of the CO bonds [136]. The main mechanism of Ru/Co3O4 in the formation of methylated furan was further examined based on DFT computational methods [135]. Using the DFT technique, one can determine the number of oxygen vacancies forming in Co3O4(110) within the hydrogen treatment. It was reported that a higher probability in the formation of threefold oxygen vacancies could be detected compared to twofold oxygen vacancies [135]. Besides, the possible reaction mechanism in the conversion of furfural to MF in a Ru/Co3O4 catalyst system can also be observed in Fig. 4b, which includes furfural and furfuryl alcohol routes and methyl groups that support the detachment of MF from the catalyst surface [135]. The reaction pathway can be described in the following steps: (1)-Furfural is initially adsorbed onto Ru/Co3O4 as a result of either the reaction between the CO bonds of furfural and oxygen vacancies found in Co3O4 (η2(CO)) or the bonding of a Ru atom to the furfuryl ring, (2)-On the one hand, the first hydrogen interacts with the Ru atom and carbonyl carbon to yield alkoxy intermediates, (3)-subsequent sever of CO bonds, and (4)-the interaction of the second hydrogen with the oxygen. Similar observations are also detected in the adsorption of furfuryl alcohol at the available oxygen vacancy sites found on the surface of Co3O4. In this case, it differs from the adsorption of furfural that the main interaction is only observed between oxygen and Co3O4 surface subjected to an η1(O) binding mode [137,138]. At the same time, the interaction also occurs between the furan ring and the Ru atom. The subsequent deprotonation of the alcohol in the adsorbed furfuryl alcohol leads to the formation of alkoxy intermediates. The process is similar to the following steps as those previously indicated for the adsorbed furfural. Furthermore, outstanding catalytic activity can also be found among different forms of Ru-based catalysts. For example, the use of Ru/NiFe2O4 catalyst in the conversion of furfuryl alcohol to MF resulted in an 83% yield subjected to a reaction temperature of 180 °C and a nitrogen pressure of 2.1 Mpa for a total duration of 4 h [37]. Within the above reaction, 2-propanol was responsible for providing both the main hydrogen source and the solvent. Notably, the hydrogenation of the furan ring and decarbonylation reaction was stated to be compromised by the formation of Ni–Fe alloy resulted from the catalytic reduction. For Ir, Nandan et al. [139] confirmed the effectiveness of 5% Ir/C in the catalytic conversion of furfural to MF yielding excellent selectivity of 95% subjected to an extremely low hydrogen pressure of 100 psi. The main catalytic mechanisms provided by the metallic (Iro) and oxide (IrO2) phases of Ir were responsible for the initial hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and the ultimate formation of MF, respectively. An increase in reaction temperature from 140 °C to 220 °C was observed to promote the selective hydrodeoxygenation, while the lower temperature condition ensured the relatively comparable selectivity of furfuryl alcohol (42%) and MF (43%). Under optimal temperature conditions that allowed for the higher selectivity of MF, ring hydrogenation of furfural was significantly favored over chain hydrogenation due to elevated pressure and increased catalyst loading (Fig. 5 a). In contrast to Pd-based catalyst, those derived from Pt have shown a different effect on the hydrogenation of furfural as indicated by the formation of both furfuryl alcohol and MF among most reaction outputs. Hence, it can be concluded that the presence of Pt-based catalyst in the conversion of furfural often leads to the primary reaction with the aldehyde group via hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, or decarboxylation [140]. As further indicated by Taylor et al. [141], the prescribed conditions (Fig. 5b) were mainly responsible for the hydrogenation of furfural on Pt (111) as it adapts to either a planar motif or a slanted geometric configuration in either a low or high coverage, respectively. In another study, the application of Pt/SO4–ZrO2 catalyst resulted in 47% and 33% of MF and furan, respectively as the main outputs of the catalytic reaction maintained at 240 °C. Notably, Chatterjee et al. pointed out the potential negative effect on the strength of the catalytic transformation as a result of the THFA synthesis [143]. On the other hand, the use of a Pt–Co/C bimetallic catalyst under relatively moderate conditions could yield up to 100% of furfuryl alcohol. At the same time, the same catalyzed reaction with concentrated furfural (40 wt%) resulted in an 86% yield of furfuryl alcohol under 50 °C and 10 bar of hydrogen pressure [144]. A possible correlation between catalytic activity and the proximate relationship between the available electron-rich Pt and ionic Co species could be detected based on the overview. Furthermore, MF synthesis could be favored by this particular catalytic variety, especially at elevated temperatures [145]. In their study, Wang et al. recorded a small drop in MF yield from 88% to 75% when the hydrogen flow was increased from 1 bar to 33 bar of pressure as a result of the production of highly hydrogenated substances. In contrast, an investigation on the selective hydrogenation of furfural to MF was able to obtain a 78% yield under low-temperature conditions (150 °C vs. 180 °C) using a single-metal-based catalyst Pt/C when subjected to a constant flow pattern [146]. In their study, Eveliina et al. analyzed the conversion efficiency of MF from furfural in three different metal-based catalytic systems, namely Pt, Ru, and Ni carried by wood-based activated carbons [142]. The experiments were performed using a batch reactor set at a temperature ranging between 210 °C and 240 °C and 40 bar of H2 pressure, and 2-propanol was used as the main solvent. The authors confirmed the relatively equal effectiveness and suitability of both types of activated carbons in carrying the metal catalysts used in the furfural transformation [10,147]. Among the factors influencing the MF yield, the dispersion and size of the metal particles rank on top along with the reaction temperature [148]. The above study recorded the highest possible MF yields from the synthesis with the highest dispersions at 240 °C in reaction temperature and 2 h of reaction time for the following noble metal catalysts: 50% MF yield for 3 wt% Pt on spruce wood and 49% MF yield for 3% wt Ru on birch wood. In contrast to Pt and Ru, Ni-based catalysts were observed to be the least active resulting from their low dispersion levels and partial metal reduction. Results from the experiments with different metal loadings were also provided showing no difference in the MF yield between 1.5 wt% and 3 wt% Pt loading which suggested a potential cost saving from reduced resource consumption (Fig. 5c) [142]. 2.3.2 Non-noble metal-based catalysts Even though noble metal-based catalysts are known for their outstanding reactivity and catalytic effect, the high material cost prevents the production from reaching the industrial scale. Considering this current obstacle, researchers have increasingly become interested in searching for alternatives to replace noble metal catalysts. Even though the potential conversion performance of non-noble metal catalysts is lower than that of those derived from noble metals, the cheap cost is a highly preferred quality [149,150]. Some non-noble metal catalysts include Cu, Co, Ni, and Zr, the application of non-noble metal catalysts has been shown to result in relatively good MF yields [151]. Among the non-noble metal catalysts, Cu-based catalysts are known for their affordability, availability, and satisfactory performance in the hydrogenation process [152]. The use of Cu-based catalysts can also be found in MF production. Due to the low binding energy, selective hydrogenation was observed on the furan ring on Cu(111) [153]. The strong repulsion force existing between the Cu (111) and the furan ring could be attributed to the incomplete overlaying of the 3 d band of the Cu atoms and the antibonding orbital found in the furan ring [125]. Furthermore, Cu has also been observed to not react to the hydrogenolysis of the C–O bonds [154]. Interestingly, a three-metal catalyst (i.e., Cu–Zn–Al) has been shown to actively support MF formation during the gas phase [155,156]. Relying on coupling reactions, MF and ketones could be produced upon the use of alcohol in supplying the required hydrogen. Other possible sources of hydrogen could also include the use of 1,4-butanediol and cyclohexanol. Among the notable reaction characteristics, studies have also examined the possible influence of the calcination temperature of the metallic catalyst on the overall MF synthesis. Higher yields (up to 93%) were indicated upon increasing the calcination temperature of Cu–Zn–Al to 350 °C within the production of MF [156]. The above results, which suggested a strong catalytic effect in the selective hydrogenation process, were driven primarily by the presence of defunct Cu nanoparticles, commonly available, robust and active Lewis base sites, and Cu+ species found on the catalyst surface. Similarly, the high degree of uniformity and dispersion of Cu NPs supported on the large surface of activated carbon relative to the ratios of Cu2+, CuO, and Cu+ could be attributed to the exceptional role of Cu/AC catalyst in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation. Such a system was found to produce up to 92% of MF [157]. In their attempt to synthesize MF from furfural, Weijie et al. employed an integrated approach in the formulation of a Cu–Cu2O/N-RGO nanocomposite that was characterized by a uniform dispersion [158]. The authors utilized a combination of microwave-supported reduction reactions and ammonia evaporation. Maintained under favorable conditions, the conversion efficiency could reach up to 95.5% MF yield while no catalyst deactivation could be detected within the first 5 cycles. The catalytic activity was mainly driven by the inherent synergistic relationship between CuO and Cu+ species on the catalyst surface as a result of the preceding partial reduction of CuO species from the robust reactions between Cu precursors and support. Besides, the authors also confirmed the potential of the synthetic catalyst due to its strong stability and increased resistance to potential leakage. In their study, Srivastava et al. demonstrated a conversion process of furfuryl alcohol from furfural via hydrogenation supported by a series of Cu–Co bimetallic catalysts carried on SBA-15 [159]. The authors recorded up to 80% of furfuryl alcohol yielded from the process in which 9% and 10% of MF and cyclopentanol, respectively, were also attained in the final outputs. In a subsequent investigation, a comparison of the conversion performance of three different types of bimetallic catalysts (i.e., Cu–Co/SiO2, Cu–Co/H-ZSM-5, and Cu–Co/-Al2O3) was conducted using an impregnation technique [160]. For each of the three catalysts, the main interactions from the furfural selective hydrogenation to MF were determined. Overall, a considerable effect was detected on the catalytic performance due to the robust interaction between Cu and Co. Particularly, more selective hydrogenation towards MF was favored by acid supports, such as H-ZSM-5 and -Al2O3. This observation was also supported by the results from previous works. Besides, due to the strong synergistic interaction between the metal components and the weak acid sites, Cu/SiO2 was detected to outperform Cu/ZnO and Cu/Al2O3 in the production of MF (i.e., the former catalyst could result in up to 90% of MF yield) [154]. Particularly, it could be suspected the involvement of Cu species in the detachment of the hydrogen molecules and reduction to hydrogen atoms. This initial process was then followed by the adsorption of aldehydic oxygen atoms to the acidic sites available on the catalyst surface. Finally, the formation of furfuryl alcohol is concluded by the attachment of hydrogen atoms to the carbonyl oxygen atoms [161,162]. Furthermore, the availability of the weak acidic CoOx phase could enhance the attachment of furfuryl alcohol onto the outer surface of the catalyst which helped in advancing the continued hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol to MF [163]. During this process, hydrogen atoms were first linked to hydroxyl oxygen atoms that led to the discharge of a mole of water. Lastly, the interaction of hydrogen atoms and positively charged carbon atoms resulted in the creation of MF. As observed in Fig. 6 a, Langmuir Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson kinetics can be applied in summarizing and explaining the experimental data [164]. Based on the analysis, the hydrogen adsorption and catalyst surface reaction were determined to be the rate-limiting steps. Indeed, the best record in terms of MF selectivity (78%) was observed in the synthesis of MF from furfural catalyzed by Cu–Co/Al2O3 at 220 °C in temperature and 40 bar of H2 pressure. Subsequently, a moderate increase to the MF yield was possible when applying the Taguchi optimization technique resulting in an improvement of 87% in MF yield [164]. In the study of Dong et al. the authors were successful in increasing MF yield up to 96% via an ammonia evaporation-supported reaction maintained at 200 °C and supported by a Cu/SiO2 catalyst [25]. Within the same study, an alternative Cu-phyllosilicate-like catalyst was also formulated that could yield up to 96% and 83% in MF and furfuryl alcohol, respectively [165]. Besides the presence of both metal and Lewis acid active sites, the structural modification of the underlying substrate could be achieved by the introduction of co-metal particles. In one study, Fu et al. noted that adding Ni to the Cu-based catalyst carried on an Al2O3 substrate showed an increase in catalytic activity relative to that measured in either Cu/Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 catalytic system [166]. It was also noted that the observed improvement could be attributed to the new Ni–Cu alloy phase which affected the adsorption characteristics of furfural. Hence, the Cu atoms found on the catalyst surface were responsible for repelling the furan ring. As shown in Fig. 6b, the main interaction of the carbonyl oxygen was further supported favoring hydrogenation over carbonylation reactions [166]. The study also stated the optimal reaction conditions (i.e., 220 °C in temperature, 7 h of duration, and the use of formic acid as the main hydrogen flow) that could yield up to 92% MF in the case of Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. Contrarily, upon replacing formic acid with hydrogen gas, changes in the primary outputs could be detected [123]. Hence, the presence of H2 pressure could be suspected to significantly affect the overall effectiveness of Ni–Cu alloy in the MF catalytic synthesis. Applying the density functional theory (DFT) method, Shi identified four competing pathways in the production of MF [167]. The disassociation of carbon atoms from the CO group by hydrogen atoms resulted in either alkoxy intermediates or 2-furanyl(hydroxy)methyl intermediates. Among the possible routes in which the direct breaking up of CO and C–H bonds were examined, the authors determined the alkoxy intermediate species to be the rate-limiting step [167]. Overall, the results supported the conclusion confirming the preference of Cu-based catalyst for the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol, MF, and pentanediol over those obtained from decarbonylation and furan-ring hydrogenation. A possible enhancement supported by elevated reaction temperatures could be considered to overcome the weak hydrogenation of the CO bond in furfuryl alcohol required for the production of MF [168,169]. Other alternatives also included the addition of a second metal as part of the catalyst system to promote deoxygenation as well as raising the level of Lewis acidity of the catalyst [125]. Furthermore, the co-existence of Cu and Cu+ provided important catalytic mechanisms. While the former was mainly responsible for the hydrogen activation and the latter species acted as Lewis acid or electrophilic sites disassociating the CO bonds [10]. The heterogeneous catalysis process has been known to be responsible for the reduction of furfural to MF. Given that furfuryl alcohol desorption did not directly compete with the synthesis of MF, the primary concern has now been left to the potential rivalry in the catalytic transformation of furfuryl alcohol [170]. Among the existing literature, a limited number of studies have focused on exploring innovative synthesis catalysts, such as changing particle size [171], the introduction of co-metal particles [172], and identifying the adsorption configuration and possible reaction kinetic pathways [173,174]. As a case in point, the upright η1(Oaldeheyde) surface attachment provided the primary mechanism for the attachment of furfural on the surface of a Cu-based catalyst, whereas the strong preference for THFA was driven by the repelling force existing between the furan ring the surface [175]. For both Pd(111) and Pt(111)-based catalytic systems, the main binding mode was flat η2(CO) suggesting the positive relationship between the furan ring and the catalyst surface which resulted in low selectivity [171,176]. Notwithstanding this observation, researchers have not been able to provide conclusive findings on the possible causal effect of the catalyst surface configuration and the reaction selectivity. Furthermore, a general rule of thumb on selectivity has yet been provided. A recent rise in attention has been geared toward examining the role of non-precious-metal catalysts given that Ni possesses a strong catalytic performance and better cost-effectiveness in the production of furfuryl alcohol from furfural [177,178]. There are several options available for Ni-based catalysts that can be used in the selective conversion to furfuryl alcohol. A possible candidate is the Ni–Sn bimetallic catalyst that has been shown to possess an excellent selective hydrogenation property and close to 99% furfuryl alcohol yielded from furfural [179]. Ni/MMO-CO3 is another example of a Ni-based catalyst. This particular catalyst has been derived by modifying the structural topology of hydrotalcite precursors with carbonate leading to nearly all THFA selectivity (99%) [180]. Furthermore, Yu et al. have identified aldehyde functionality on the surface Ni–Fe-based catalyst as the primary adsorption mechanism in the synthesis of MF from furfural [181]. In a separate experiment, Toni et al. [10] utilized forestry residues in preparing carbon-based foams to be used in supporting Cu/Ni catalysts which were applied toward the hydrogenation of furfural to MF. Based on the obtained results, the authors confirmed the general effectiveness (approximately 100%) in the conversion of furfural to MF among the catalysts examined in the study. Moreover, two catalysts exhibited the highest level of selectivity. The first one was Cu/Ni supported on HNO3 acid-washed carbon foams that were synthesized from pine-bark-extract-based activated carbon. On the other hand, the activated carbon for the second Cu/Ni was pine bark extractives. The observed selectivities for these two catalysts were 48% and 57–61%, respectively. The significance of the selective disassociation of the CO bonds occurring externally to the furan ring of furfural has been highlighted in the conversion of biomass-derived furfural to MF. According to Ke et al. [182], an integrated approach utilizing knowledge from DFT computation methods, surface science field, and reactor assessment has been employed in the study of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as a potentially promising selective deoxygenation catalyst in the conversion of MF from furfural (Fig. 7 a). Based on the results, the robust relationship between the C1 O1 bond of furfural and the Mo2C surface was primarily responsible for the high selectivity deoxygenation of furfural to produce MF. In another study, Lee et al. have demonstrated the catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C) occurring in the vapor phase of the hydrodeoxygenation process of furfural. The authors confirmed the potential 60% selectivity of MF achieved by the molybdenum carbide (β-Mo2C) catalysts synthesized from the temperature-controlled reaction technique (Fig. 7b&c) [183]. Nevertheless, the fast deterioration of this particular type of catalyst was recorded within several hours after the initial reaction as a result of increased coke formation. Adding a second metal (e.g., Co–Mo2C) has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem by Lin et al. that would help to enhance the stability of β-Mo2C catalyst without negatively affecting its overall performance [184]. Particularly, the resulting lower coke formation could be attributed to the low levels of energy existing among the oxygen and furfural bonds found in Co–Mo2C [184]. In a recent study published by Deng et al. an overview of the catalytic activity and performance of pure phase molybdenum carbides (α-MoC, β-Mo2C) and nitride (γ-Mo2N) was provided for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural in yielding both furfuryl alcohol and MF [185]. Among the tested catalysts, the authors observed the highest catalytic performance demonstrated by α-MoC in the synthesis of MF recording 96.6% and 89.8% in the conversion and selectivity of MF from furfural, respectively. In addition, there have also been several conclusions supporting the positive role of Fe in promoting methyl furan formation in Ni–Fe [145] and Fe–Cu bimetallic catalyst systems [186]. It has been pointed out the presence of Fe limited decarbonization while favoring hydrogenation of CO bonds and hydrogenolysis of C–O at specifically low and high-temperature ranges, respectively. Furthermore, the authors also indicated that the incomplete reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ was also responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance due to the redox and acid-base qualities of iron [187]. Particularly, 79% MF yield was obtained by Grazia et al. in their experiment involving a gas-phase reduction of furfural catalyzed by a synthesized iron-magnesium-oxide catalyst system (Fe/Mg/O) and treated with methanol as the main hydrogen donor [188]. Furthermore, Carlo et al. also observed an improvement in MF production as a result of the addition of Fe3+ cations into the chemical structure of magnesium oxides within a furfuryl alcohol hydrogenolysis process [189]. More importantly, various Fe/Mg atomic ratios have been utilized in the synthesis of these catalysts via their co-precipitation or impregnation techniques. Indeed, MF was indicated as the primary substance making up the majority of the outputs achieving close to 92% selectivity. In general, the conversion efficiency of furfural to MF has a large dependence on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The MF yield through the catalyst-based conversion pathway could be given in Table 3 ."
5,"Pyrolysis and oxidation mechanism, ignition behavior","Considered as one of the most basic forms of the alkylated furanic compound, MF stands out as a promising next-generation biofuel due to its preferred properties such as a higher octane number compared to that of conventional gasoline. One of the major obstacles limiting the wider application of MF fuels is the potentially higher emissions of soot. Because of the presence of unsaturated molecular structures, the combustion of MF fuels results in an increased concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are the primary substances in the formation of soot. Hence, it is necessary to provide thorough investigations on the role of pyrolysis and oxidation as the main mechanisms in MF fuel combustion and the possible routes of pollutant formation and emissions in the internal combustion engines. Notable topics of research on MF fuel oxidation and flames include laminar burning velocities, ignition delay times, and the profiles of different species present in premixed flames. Among existing combustion models, pyrolysis studies have widely been used to analyze the main mechanisms behind the thermal decomposition and growth of molecular. Such applications benefit from the straightforward and detailed reaction system provided by the separation from the oxidizer."
6,Pyrolysis and decomposition mechanism,"3.1 Pyrolysis and decomposition mechanism 3.1.1 Quantum chemical kinetic studies Taking a theoretical approach, researchers have mainly relied on the use of quantum chemical methods and previously established detailed chemical kinetics modeling from prior investigations in studying the pyrolysis kinetics of furan. Applying quantum chemical methods, Somers et al. utilized various techniques including CBS-APNO, CBS-QB3, and G3 in quantifying potential energy surfaces observed in MF pyrolysis [208]. Besides, the same theory also was utilized in identifying product branching fractions and reaction pathways in multiple-channel systems, which are found to be representative of the title species in pyrolysis reactions. Within the unimolecular decomposition of MF, researchers have observed the initial transfer reactions of hydrogen atoms via single carbene intermediates, which are prepared for undergoing the ring-opening process. After transforming into collisionally stabilized acyclic C5H6O isomers, additional breaking down of these compounds result in C1–C4 species. Fig. 8 a illustrates the main process and potential energy surfaces observed in the development and disintegration of β-carbenes. It could be seen that no direct competition could be detected between the unimolecular decomposition of MF via α-carbene and β-carbene intermediates given the separation by their potential energy surfaces [208]. Examining the different rate constants measured in the abstraction reactions, this study has shown more robust activities by the alkyl side chain compared to those led by hydrogen atoms and methyl radicals [208]. In their study, Tranter et al. [209] relied on quantum chemical quantification methods as the main methodology while using CBS-QB3 coordinates previously obtained from the results of Somers et al. [208]. Then, the authors utilized two distinct density functional theory techniques as part of the re-optimization process of the above variables [210]. In conclusion, they noted the gradual disappearance of any clear and distinguishable chemical characteristics among the cis-trans isomers of the intermediary species upon attaining the prescribed temperatures. The assessment was provided according to the measured achieved energies and rovibrational measurements as shown in Fig. 8b. They found that two reactions, MF = pC3H4 + C2H2O and MF = 1-C4H6 + CO, play a critical role in the MF pyrolysis. These reactions followed the initial creation of carbenes that was then supported by a series of isomerization reactions before the ring-opening and resulting in products having a stable closed-shell structure [209]. In another study, Alexander et al. utilized two different high-level composite computational techniques, namely G4 and CBS-QB3, in the assessment of the dissociation energies required for breaking apart the C–H bonds in MF [211]. Such approaches were also employed to determine other characteristics of the observed initiation reaction mechanisms including enthalpy and barrier heights. The authors pointed out the cis-trans configuration of the OH and O2 ring positions that directly influenced the sustainability of the succeeding reactions. Due to the unusually low barrier height exhibited in the OH compound, 1,4-H-migrations, which were responsible for the abstraction of hydrogen atoms, were observed to attach to the same carbon atoms (Fig. 8c) [211]. Hence, such a significant reduction in existing energy levels resulted in lower activation barriers relative to the Waddington mechanism towards the six-membered ring structure and concerted elimination reactions. It could be seen from Fig. 8c that the H-abstraction reactions occur through either H or OH, the detachment of the hydrogen atom from the aromatic ring is observed to be more endothermic than those associated with the methyl group [212,213]. For H-abstraction reactions by H and OH, the main contrast in the energy levels can explain the tendency and reference for either of the above mechanism among kinetic and thermodynamic reactions. However, subjected to appropriate combustion environments, different reaction pathways could be used in leading the decomposition process of alkyl furans, such as bond cleavage, migration of H/CH3, H-abstraction, and others. Particularly, H-migration reactions in furan decomposition were examined closely by Sendt et al. [214], in which 1,2-H-migration resembling the transition of C5 to C4 in MF was revealed to be the most influential in initiating the process. Indeed, several possible pathways can support the migration reactions, which facilitate the unimolecular decomposition of MF. The results obtained from these investigations align well with those obtained in other studies [212,214]. Among the H/CH3-migrations, the transition of the hydrogen atom from C5 to C4 has been shown to possess the least energy barrier that is attributed to the leading initial step observed at high reaction temperatures. Despite the sustainability of the reactions that follow, the above observation is considered the most significant route for furan decomposition. In contrast, abstraction and addition reactions are more relevant at lower reaction temperatures in which bimolecular reactions outcompete the unimolecular bond disassociation reactions. In the later studies, the enthalpies of MF formation, as well as its radicals, were measured in Hudzik et al. [215]. The authors also examined the bond dissociation enthalpies for the respective O–H and O–O bonds. A drastic drop in bond dissociation enthalpies was observed due to the interaction between the stability of the furan ring and the capability of the oxygen moiety in creating double bonds. Concerning MF isomers, Zhang et al. [216] utilized ab initio quantification methods in their assessment of the possible reaction mechanisms observed in OH + 3-methylfuran. As a result, the dominant mechanisms detected in the OH +3-methylfuran reaction relied on the availability of both HC(O)CHC(CH3)CHOH and CH(OH)CHC(CH3)C(O)H. Besides, no significant effect yielded from the direct abstraction of H-atom could be detected. These obtained results were also reported in other studies [217,218]. Furthermore, results from prior assessments of MF reaction sub-mechanisms were enhanced upon by the replacement of approximates obtained for the following reactions, including ring-opening of MF radicals, unimolecular reactions, hydrogen addition reactions, and hydrogen abstraction reactions by either H or CH3 [219]. 3.1.2 Experimental studies Besides several studies focusing on the theoretical and computational framework in the approximation of reaction rate parameters and primary consumption routes, others have carried out experimental studies on MF pyrolysis by using shock tubes and flow reactors. Among the limited number of experiment studies focusing on MF decomposition, an experiment was conducted by Lifshitz et al. [220] using a shock tube subjected to reaction temperatures ranging between 1100 K and 1400 K. The authors observed two distinct paths that the decomposition could take place including the removal and transfer of the 1,2-H atom from C5 to C4 and the methyl group from C2 to C3 observed in the ring formation. In a subsequent study by Cheng et al. [221], they indicated that, within the two possible unimolecular pathways observed in the decomposition of MF, several chemical compounds have been identified as the primary products of the aforementioned process including methyl and propargyl radicals, 1-butyne and carbon monoxide. Particularly, the unimolecular reactions that initiated the MF decomposition resulted in the production of propargyl and acetyl radicals. Moreover, it was reported that a high prevalence of aromatics for MF was noted in the former reaction which could be explained by the greater availability of aromatic precursors (e.g., propargyl radical) [222]. In an attempt to get a better understanding of the initial reaction steps in MF pyrolysis and their characteristics, an experimental study was conducted by Weber et al. by closely examining the concentration of hydrogen at different times [223]. The authors relied on reflected shock waves with AR as the primary monitoring mechanism subjected to the following reaction conditions of 1400–1900K in temperature and 0.8–1.2 bar of pressure. As a result, the primary formation of hydrogen atoms was observed through the dissociation of the C–H bond in the methyl group of MF. Besides, the secondary hydrogen-forming reaction could be seen in the rapid decomposition of ethylenyl or vinyl radical (C2H3) which was the product of the consecutive reaction (2-furyl–CH2 + H ⇌ 2-MF) resulted from n-C4H5 (1,3-butadiene-1-yl). Following the formation reaction of hydrogen, the authors observed the main influence of the decomposition reactions of C2H3 and other compounds such as aC3H4, pC3H4, and C3H3, which could be observed in Fig. 9 . Notably, while the decomposition of the latter three species required high reaction temperatures (T > 1580 K), the breaking down of C2H3 could be initiated at lower temperature ranges. As a result, the authors observed a significant consumption of MF followed by several consecutive reactions further decomposing primary and secondary products derived from MF ⇌ CH3COCHCCH2; CH3CHCCHCHO ⇌ 1-C4H6 + CO; CH3CHCCHCHO ⇌ 1,2-C4H6 + CO; and 2-MF ⇌ α-carbene, which were prevalent in the hydrogen atom formation step. Similarly, Moreover, Liu et al. [224] have analyzed the formed products of various decomposition reactions. Among these, CH3COCHCCH2 ⇌ CH2CO + pC3H4 and CH3CHCCHCHO ⇌ 1,2-C4H6 + CO are two reactions that were identified as responsible for the outcomes from the two ring-opening reactions. On the other hand, reaction MF ⇌ α-carbene was considered for the development of a cyclic α-carbene situated at the C5 position of MF that was initiated by a 1,2-H shift reaction. The subsequent decomposition of such products was dubbed reaction α-carbene ⇌ pC3H4 + CH2CO. Among the different experimental studies, some studies have closely examined several important reactions. For example, Elwardani et al. [225] investigated the difference in the reaction rate constant of OH radical, and the compounds including furan, MF, DMF. The reactions were observed in a shock tube subjected to a temperature range of 890–1388 K and 1–2 atm of pressure. As a result, the reaction between OH and DMF recorded the highest rate coefficient. Between the two remaining fuels, the rate coefficient of MF and OH ranked above that of furan. In another study, a two-step hierarchical reaction mechanism was introduced by Kim et al. [226] aiming to provide an approximation to the rate parameters of the specified reaction leveraged from the measurements of reaction-time-resolved species concentrations in shock tubes. Particularly, these results provided the inputs for the calibration of model parameters in MF and OH reaction [225]. In another study, Alexandrino et al. [227] reviewed the key factor in the oxidation reaction of MF subjected to the availability of NO. The authors indicated that the temperature for reaction onset of MF thermal decomposition was lower under lean and very lean combustion regardless of the presence of NO. Specifically, a more drastic temperature decrease could also be observed when NO is present. In a study of Eble et al. [228], the authors also examined the reaction rate coefficients involving OH radicals and two different furan derivatives, namely DMF and MF, performed in a pressurized (7–21 bar), low-flow reactor. Both reactions did not exhibit dependence on either pressure or non-Arrhenius temperature. A small drop in the rate coefficients was observed upon rising reaction temperatures from 295 K to 350 K. In higher temperature ranges, a much more significant reduction in the rate coefficients was detected that could be driven by the non-reversible attachment of OH radicals to the aromatic ring structure and the thermal decomposition of the OH adduct taken place during the first and second regime, respectively. Among the subsequent studies, an investigation on the reaction kinetics of atomic oxygen O(3 P) reacting with furan, MF, and DMF was conducted by Yoshizawa et al. [229] via high-temperature reactions performed in a shock tube supported by an atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy. The authors obtained the highest rate coefficients among the reaction of atomic oxygen with DMF followed by MF and furan. In a study of Tran et al. [230], they revealed the production of a highly reactive OH radical as a result of the bimolecular reactions between the HO2 radical and the resonance-stabilized MF-yl radicals. Given their special role, attention should be placed on these reactions considering the reduced unimolecular decomposition rate of MF fuel radicals Fig. 10 a contains the descriptions of several reaction pathways by which MF-yl could interact with HO2 radicals. Due to the resonance stabilization characteristic of MF-yl radicals, there are three separate sites at which the reaction can take place, including the CH2 moiety and the locations of C3 and C5 as denoted by italic numbers in Fig. 10a. Upon further examination, one could detect a higher reaction rate demonstrated by the attachment of HO2 radical to the CH2 moiety (channel #1) compared to the other two locations (channel #2 and #3). Furthermore, a faster rate of bond cleavage could be seen in the O–O bonds found among different peroxide species, e.g., MF-ylOOH and MF-ylOOH-3. Because the bond dissociation rate was higher than that measured in the re-dissociation of the adduct in the reaction of HO2 with MF fuel radicals, these various channels have a significant influence on promoting the conversion of relatively unreactive HO2 to more reactive OH radicals. According to Tran et al. [231], the primary reaction pathways were identified from the results of the reaction flow analysis of MF pyrolysis. The authors observed a significant proportion of MF consumption led by the ipso-addition resulting in the formation of C4H4O and CH3 radical. Notably, the remaining two pathways via addition reactions of hydrogen atoms were responsible for approximately 32% of total MF consumption. One of these mechanisms included the H-atom addition reaction on carbon C2 leading to the formation of CH3–CH2–CHCH-, and CO. Moreover, the availability of 1,3-C4H6 and the CHO radical (5%) as a result of the ring-opening and H-migration process. Upon examining the chemical characteristics of the MF molecule, the authors detected significantly lower bond energy measured in the C–H bond found in the methyl group relative to that of C2–C6 bond. Besides, the increased production of C3H6 could be attributed to the combined effects from key reactions involving C2H3 and CH3 radicals or the interaction between a hydrogen atom and the C3H5 radical. Furthermore, the formation of C4H2 was primarily initiated by the C2H2 + C2H = C4H2 + H reaction. Later, the subsequent reaction with OH resulted in CHO and C3H2 as demonstrated by the following reaction equation, C4H2 + OH = CHO + C3H2. As depicted in Fig. 10b, the direct consumption of MF led to the formation of C4H7 radicals. Furthermore, the combined interaction of CH3 with either n-C4H5 or i-C4H5 radicals was responsible for the formation of 1,3-C5H8 and i-C5H8, respectively. These compounds represented the two most commonly found isomers of C5H8. As shown in Fig. 12, the formation of n-C4H5 and i-C4H5 radicals was the direct result of MF consumption. The authors also detected the formation of C6H2 as a result of the interaction between C4H2 and the C2H radical. On the other hand, the presence of HCHO could also be detected as a result of multiple reactions observed in combustion flames [224]. Among these, a significant portion of its formation could be attributed to the reaction of C2H3 radicals with oxygen. The availability of C2H3 radical was observed during the fuel combustion process through the modified hydrogen addition pathways (Fig. 10b) [231]. Furthermore, the pyrolysis of MF directly produced C4H4O and n-C4H5 radical. Notably, the introduction of OH radical to the MF consumption process could promote the production of oxygenated compounds, such as acrolein. In their study, Cheng et al. [221] attempted at identifying the mole fraction of key pyrolysis outputs including free radicals and aromatic compounds of which measurements were obtained from an MF pyrolysis experiment conducted in a flow reactor under the following temperature (900–1530 K) and pressure condition (30–760 Torr). The authors observed that unimolecular isomerization reactions were primarily responsible for MF decomposition during the pyrolysis process. Notably, a significant presence of cyclic carbenes was detected in MF consumption that resulted from the H-migration reactions dominating the unimolecular isomerization pathways (MF = CH3COCHCCH2‐t, and MF = CH3CHCCHCHO‐t). Next, the C4H6-1 formation reactions from breaking down CH3CHCCHCHO‐t were detected as the main activities (Fig. 11 a). Additional rate of production analysis demonstrated the important role of hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions within the MF consumption process and their relative significance increased with rising pressure. Several products were identified among the hydrogen abstraction and addition reactions, including H2, CH4, C3H4-p, C3H4-a, C4H4, and C4H4O (Fig. 11a). Given its higher concentration in MF pyrolysis, C6H6 was found to be integral in initiating the production of other aromatic compounds. C6H5CH2 was the product of the interaction between C3H3 and C4H4, demonstrated by the following equation C3H3 + C4H4 = C6H5CH2. The other C7 aromatic observed as output from such reactions was C6H5CH3. Among the latest theoretical studies, the reaction mechanisms behind the reactions between C3H3 and C4H4 were investigated by Trogolo et al. to provide an updated model taking into account the newly calculated rate coefficients [232]. In Klippenstein et al. [233], the chemical activation reaction, C6H5CH2 + H = C6H5 + CH3, was put forth as the primary process contributing to the production of C6H5CH2. Similar to the other study, the rate constant was also quantified based on the theoretical assumptions and incorporated within the proposed model. Several possible reaction pathways were detected in the formation of C8 aromatics (e.g., C6H5C2H, C6H5C2H5, and C6H5C2H3). Notably, the combination reaction was responsible for C6H5C2H formation described in the following reaction between C6H5 and C2H2/C4H4. On the other hand, the availability of C6H5C2H3 depended significantly on the combination reactions of C4H5 radicals. On the other hand, C6H5C2H3 was the product of the hydrogen abstraction reaction of C6H5C2H5 that was subsequently subjected to the β-C−H bond scission reaction. According to Slavinskaya et al. [234], the underlying mechanism in the production of these aromatic compounds, namely C6H5C2H, could be attributed to the combination reaction of C5H5 and C3H3 radicals. Particularly, C9H8 could be formed according to the following reaction equation, C6H5 + C3H3 = C9H8. Several possible combination reactions could lead to the formation of C10H8, such as C6H5CH2 + C3H3, C9H7 + CH3 and C6H5 + C4H4, as well as C7H5 + C3H3 (Fig. 11a) [221]. From the above-mentioned analysis, it could be concluded that MF pyrolysis demonstrated a high soot formation capacity driven by the significant role of C4 species in producing intermediates that were responsible for soot precursors formation, i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), this was also highly agreed by Alexandrino et al. [235] and Wu et al. [236]. Moreover, under high temperature and input 2-MF concentration conditions, increased levels of soot emissions were detected which indicated the preference of soot formation upon higher temperature and MF fuel concentration. Moreover, the authors also pointed out that MF pyrolysis contained largely of two types of reactions, including H atoms led hydrogen abstraction reactions occurring on the methyl side of MF, CH3, and C2H3 radicals which were known to be the primary pathways for the production of hydrogen, methane, and ethylene, respectively (Path 1 of Fig. 11b) [235]. On the other hand, the other route contained the H-addition reaction at the C5 position of the furan ring facilitating the ensuing ring-opening step (Path 2 of Fig. 11b). As a result, n-butadienyl radicals made up the primary product of MF pyrolysis that were later converted to benzene, benzyl radicals, styrene, and acetylene (as shown in Path 1 of Fig. 11b). Despite the known soot emissions property of MF combustion, it was also regarded for the self-combination of cyclopentadienyl radicals through which the formation of naphthalene took place in the absence of other intermediates [237]. Notably, a detectable amount of cyclopentadienyl radicals was obtained from the experimental result of the decomposition of 2-MF. The presence of these radicals could be attributed to the key H-abstraction reactions from cyclopentadiene by CH3 radicals, as described in Path 2 of Fig. 11b of MF pyrolysis. Overall, the unimolecular dissociation presented the primary pathway for thermal decomposition of MF during combustion. The main outputs of the process included high concentration levels of propargyl and acetyl radicals. These aromatic precursors were responsible for the increased presence of aromatic compounds in MF pyrolysis. Based on the review of existing theoretical and experimental studies on MF combustion, there has been a stronger preference for the addition reactions of H atom and OH radicals over H-abstraction reactions observed from the aromatic ring structure [213,238,239]. In most cases, the measured values for the reaction enthalpy were observed to be more exothermic among addition reactions compared to those from the abstraction ones. However, H abstraction reactions by H atoms or OH radicals at the methyl site were among the few exceptions to the above conclusion. Furthermore, the leading reactions at high-temperature pyrolysis were the unimolecular reactions involving hydrogen atom migration. Among the biomolecular reactions responsible for triggering subsequent reactions, H-atom abstraction by H atoms occurring in the ring exhibited the highest A-factor even though OH concentration would probably exceed that of H atom. 3.1.3 Detailed chemical kinetic models The construction of detailed chemical kinetic models could be enabled by the reaction data and parameters resulted from previous calculations and experimental studies. Such models provided the tools in estimating key combustion variables, including ignition delay time and laminar burning speed. Additional examinations into the reaction chemical kinetics were also possible with the help of modeling study through methods such as reaction path analysis and sensitivity analysis. In a study of Lifshitz et al. [220], several chemical kinetic models were presented in an attempt to describe the underlying mechanisms occurring within the MF pyrolysis process at temperatures between 1100 K and 1400 K. The modeling included a list of 36 different chemical substances and approximately 100 elementary reactions. As a result, the authors observed consensus among the results in terms of MF pyrolysis products and quantified mole percentage with previous experimental data. An explanation was proposed for the simulated product distribution that focused on the migration of the methyl group from the second to third position within the ring. In their investigation of the MF combustion and oxidation process, Somers et al. [240] applied the combustion data related to the ignition delay time and laminar burning speed in their construction of a chemical kinetic model for the observed reactions. The modeling provided an overview of 291 species among 2059 reactions and the calculated results generally aligned with the experimental data. Nevertheless, the proposed model failed to accurately predict the ignition delay time for lean burning combustion below 1400 K in pyrolysis temperature. Specifically, the ignition delay times were underestimated by the above-referenced model. Additional analyses were performed to assess the sensitivity and production rate of the modeled reactions. As a result, the authors noted the significance of hydrogen reactions in MF consumption. In particular, the hydrogen atom abstraction was observed to promote the reaction, while its addition to the furan ring structure negatively the reactivity of MF. Several other models were also constructed besides separate models for individual furan. Based on the previous results obtained from the study of Sirjean et al. [241], one kinetic model containing 305 species in 1472 reactions was proposed in the simulation of the MF pyrolysis flame [231]. Upon comparing the estimation provided by the proposed model, the results only exhibited a general qualitative consensus with the laminar burning speeds measured from the previously performed experiments of three different fuels. The consumption of MF, in particular, was demonstrated primarily by hydrogen atom abstraction and ipso-addition reactions [231]. In a subsequent study, three separate sub-mechanisms of the MF reaction were integrated to better describe MF reaction kinetics [241]. Moreover, results from previous studies have raised the role of fulvene chemistry to be incorporated into the modeling of benzene concentration in various fuel combustion [242,243]. Particularly, the presence of two critical reactions, namely C3H3 + C3H3, C3H3 + C3H5, and i-C4H5 + C2H2, was essential to the production of fulvene besides benzene and/or phenyl + H. Among the proposed models, the primary conversion of fulvene into benzene was led to the reactions involving hydrogen atoms [244]. Taking into account these observations, a mole fraction profile was developed by Moshammer et al. including 60 different types of chemical species to enhance the formation chemistry of soot precursors and other aromatic compounds from the MF pyrolysis process [245]. Toward such an objective, several different mole fraction profiles were proposed for common precursor compounds, such as C3H5, i-C4H5, and C5H5 [246]. In their analysis of MF combustion reaction pathways, Cheng et al. [247] offered a revision to the previously identified reaction mechanisms under three different combustion conditions, including lean, stoichiometric, and rich. Validation was performed on the updated model by the mole fractions obtained from subsequent experiments obtained for the prevalent species found in the MF flames. In the updated model, the authors combined several key species while taking into account the reactions responsible for their formation and consumption. These species included acrolein, methyl vinyl ketone, propargyl, 2-furylmethyl, 1-oxo-1,3-butadiene, 1-oxo-1,3,4-pentatriene, etc. Based on the developed mechanisms, reliable predictions could be made on the products from the hydrogen addition reaction in the MF consumption [247]. The authors detected the primary formation of 1-oxo-1,3-butadiene and furan as a result of H-additions in MF pyrolysis. Replication of the production of these two species could be possible using the existing model. Among the two previously mentioned products, the authors detected a preference for 1-oxo-1,3-butadiene over furan resulted from the H-addition reactions. On the other hand, the model demonstrated the primary production of 2-furylmethyl and 1-oxo-1,3,4-pentatriene from abstraction reactions of hydrogen atoms during the MF consumption process. Nevertheless, there seemed not to be sufficient pathways to convert 2- furylmethyl to 1-oxo-1,3,4 pentatriene. Furthermore, acrolein and methyl vinyl ketone were found to be among the potential products upon the addition reactions of MF and OH radicals (Fig. 12). However, in order to enhance the predicting power of acrolein, quantified measurements of the reaction rate coefficients for the two opposing reactions should be provided while taking into account the fuel molecular asymmetry. More recently, Weiser et al. [223] performed an experiment in which the assessment of MF pyrolysis was performed behind reflected shock waves combined with high-repetition-rate time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In this work, the authors formulated the time profiles of 13 non-radical species based on their measured concentrations. In providing a better characterization of hydrogen reactions in the furanic pyrolysis, the authors compared the model calculations to the slightly modified results obtained from a prior overview on MF oxidation mechanism [224]. As a result, they found a consensus between the results obtained from the referenced simulation and experiment. Furthermore, a more detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was proposed by Xu et al. [248] using both the Galway mechanism and Tianjin mechanism. While the former method consisted of 391 species and 2059 reactions, there were higher numbers of species and reactions included in the former mechanism totaling 586 species and 2997 reactions [208]. The model provided by Xu et al. [248] made references to a variety of different sub-mechanisms available in the existing literature, such as furan [214,249], aromatic [250], hydrogen, and carbon monoxide [251], hydrocarbon [252,253]. Comparable trends were found among the simulation and experimental results. Nevertheless, the authors pointed out instances in which Tianjin and Galway mechanisms failed to accurately predict the laminar burning speed. In most cases, this particular parameter was overestimated by both of these mechanisms subjected to most initial conditions. On the other hand, the mechanisms underestimated the value in fuel-rich combustion. Between the Galway and Tianjin mechanism, the authors observed a higher degree of consistency and accuracy of the latter mechanism in predicting the laminar burning velocity observed in the combustion of MF-air fuel mixtures [248]. Hence, additional improvements on the existing MF combustion mechanism would be required to enhance the predictive power of future models in estimating laminar burning velocity under high initial pressure conditions."
7,Oxidation and ignition behaviors,"3.2 Oxidation and ignition behaviors The examination into the oxidation and ignition characteristics of MF combustion could offer significant benefits to identifying relative reactivity trends. These improvements provided the opportunity for a greater understanding of MF combustion properties and behavior while enabling the development of more effective chemical kinetic modeling methods. Due to the presence of two unsaturated bonds in MF, possible addition reactions of radicals to these bonds, which had been likened to other alkenes, could be activated [254–257]. According to Bierbach et al. [213], the reaction pathway that dominated the oxidation of MF at lower temperatures was the addition of OH radicals to the aromatic ring structure. Next, the ring-opening reactions were observed to be the dominant pathway over the O2 addition reactions. A subsequent discovery made by Davis et al. [211] indicated the decomposition of the adduct resulted from the addition of OH radicals to MF could take place via one of the following elimination reactions, such as hydrogen migration, concerted, Waddington, and combined Waddington-concerted reactions. Using the results from Davis et al. [211], a sub-model of MF was presented to further examine the characteristics of the radical reaction addition to MF occurring at lower temperatures. All possible pathways of MF/OH adducts, including MF22OH3J and MF25OH4J, were integrated within the proposed sub-model at the α-sites of the aromatic ring structure of MF in particular. Despite numerous studies focusing on the characterization of MF combustion at moderate to high reaction temperatures, there has been a lack of investigation into the chemical kinetics of low-temperature MF oxidation. Considering engine issues related to low-temperature combustion, such as knocking and ignition in SI and CI engines respectively, researchers have noticed the necessity in thoroughly identifying the key properties related to MF combustion under lower temperature conditions [258]. As a furanic compound, MF has demonstrated a high level of fuel stability that would significantly reduce its reactivity at low temperatures [246]. In reality, mixtures of MF and conventional fossil-based fuels were provided for engine applications. It has been noticed that the higher availability of readily reactive species, such as n-alkanes, in the fuel mixtures could promote and initiate the oxidation of MF at lower temperatures. Among the latest studies, a low-temperature MF combustion experiment was performed by Tripathi et al. [259] with the addition of n-heptane. As a result, the authors revealed the direct competition between n-heptane and MF for the available OH radicals negatively affects the oxidation of n-heptane while promoting the consumption of MF. Both the OH-addition and H-abstraction presented the dominant reaction pathways in the observed oxidation and consumption of MF during the pyrolysis process. In a study by Eldeeb et al. [260], it has been regarded as one among several leading research into the systematic examination of the ignition behavior of different fuels including furan, MF, and DMF. In measuring the ignition delay time, the experiment was conducted using a shock tube fuel with a mixture of fuel, oxygen, and Ar gas. They reported that the ignition delay time was the shortest for MF followed by that of furan. Similarly, Xu et al. [261] reported a strong correlation between ignition delay times and measured reaction temperature. In a separate study, Wang et al. [262] revealed shorter ignition delay times for MF compared to MTHF under the same conditions leading to the former having a lower reactivity. This result was supported by the conclusions provided by Jouzdani et al. [263]. Having weaker C–H bond sites, MF has shown a higher degree of susceptibility to be broken down by radicals that resulted in higher reactivity relative to that of MTHF. Furthermore, the study also noted the adverse impact of a higher equivalence ratio on ignition delay times. As part of the reaction pathway analysis, an exact method for sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the reaction kinetics and mechanism behind MF oxidation [264]. To assess the relative effect of a particular reaction on the ignition delay time, the sensitivity coefficient could be quantified by doubling the rate constant and observing the relative effect on the modified ignition delay times as a result of the rate change [265,266]. Several former studies have offered detailed descriptions and explanations for the sensitivity coefficient [267,268]. Positive values of the rate coefficient indicated a negative effect of the reaction on the general reactivity leading to increased ignition delay times and vice versa. Concerning the reactions identified in the consumption of MF, the highest sensitivity was recorded for the addition reactions of OH radicals [259,269]. Upon examining the oxidation reactions of other aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and furans with a high level of stability such as toluene [270], DMF [271], and propyl-benzene [272], sensitivity coefficient for the reaction of the methyl side chain with oxygen in MF yielded a negative value. Regardless of the influence of reaction temperature, the reaction between HO2 radical and the prevalent fuel radical F2CH2 also resulted in a negative value leading to the rising reactivity of MF, which could be attributed to the presence of newly formed reactive OH radical [259]. In the case of pure MF, the formation of F2CH2O and OH radical from the bimolecular reaction involving the primary fuel radical F2CH2 and HO2 was identified as the leading reaction in enhancing the fuel oxidation process [259]. Hence, subject to the controlled parameters in the experiment, the prediction on the ignition delay times exhibited only minor variations. Furthermore, studies have also revealed the relative importance of MF + OH reactions in the oxidation of pure MF, which was shown to be highly dependent on combustion temperatures [273]. According to observation, the calculated ignition delay times (logarithmic scale) of MF combustion exhibited a quasi-linear dependent relationship on the inverse temperature [274]. In another study of Tanaka et al. [275], they have compared ignition delay times of MF with other fuels such as DMF, gasoline, and ethanol under various temperatures. They found that the ignition delay times of MF are longer than those of DMF and commercial gasoline and shorter than those of ethanol (Fig. 13 a), this could be seen more clearly in the case of lower temperatures. In another experiment, comparisons on the ignition characteristics of DMF and MF were provided by Xu et al. [276] while subjecting stoichiometric combustion to between 16 and 30 bar of pressure and a temperature range of 737–1143 K. Comparable levels of reactivity were observed between DMF and MF at lower to mid-temperature ranges. Slightly higher sensitivity to temperature was detected in MF combustion. At temperatures below 925 K, a higher reactivity of DMF was detected. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 13b, several reaction pathways were possible for MF consumption under a range of temperatures [276]. As for reactions occurring at lower temperatures, the authors observed the H-abstraction as the dominant reaction leading to the formation of MF22J, this finding was also concluded in a study of Sahu et al. [277]. The OH addition was later detected at the C2 and C5 sites in the ring. The subsequent interaction of MF22J radical could be described in the following sequence: MF22J → MF22OJ → F2CHO → F2CJO → F2J. As a result, the final product of E2F could be obtained from additional decomposition or addition reactions with CH3. Under rising temperatures, a drop in the percentage of OH-addition reactions could be detected, while there was a general increase in both H-abstraction and ipso-addition reactions [276]. This result showed good agreement with the reaction pathways observed in high-temperature cases. Because of the close structural properties between MF and toluene, which both possessed double-bonded ring structures with methyl side chains, similar combustion behavior could be predicted for these two different fuels. Other studies, such as Silva et al. [278] and Murakami et al. [279], provided a closer examination on the oxidation of methyl phenyl radical and benzyl radical, respectively. No significant dominance could be revealed by either study in terms of the isomerization reaction of peroxy species compared to other hydroperoxy species and the chain branching reactions that followed similar to MF. Notably, identical pathways occurring at the sites of the methyl chains were observed for these tested fuels similar to those of toluene before the ring-opening reactions [250,280,281]. This result suggested that alkyl-benzenes reaction schemes in the formulation of reaction mechanisms should be included in larger-sized alkyl-furans. Based on their experiment, Roubaud et al. [282] revealed the general reactivity of low alkyl-benzenes occurred only having either adjacent or long side chains that could be proven to be relevant for larger alkyl-furans. Laminar burning velocity is a key parameter among the major physicochemical properties observed in the combustion of a fuel-air mixture subjected to specified conditions. An overview of laminar burning velocity provided a basis to understand better the nature of ignition flame behaviors including the extinction of flame extinction, turbulent combustion, and flashback. Laminar burning velocity measurements obtained from combustion experiments could be used in validating the identified chemical kinetic mechanisms [283]. Studies have attempted at measuring the laminar burning velocity of combustion flame of MF and other blends of MF and isooctane under atmospheric pressure conditions using an outwardly propagating spherical flame method [284,285]. As a result, researchers have indicated a higher laminar burning velocity of MF compared to that of the isooctane fuel mixture. Within existing internal combustion engines, the burning rate, which is a key variable in turbulence modeling, can also be referenced by the laminar burning velocities [12]. The experiment by Wei et al. [286] was among the very first few studies on the flame characteristics of MF. In their study, these authors utilized a tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization method equipped with molecular beam mass spectrometry to assess the premixed laminar flames of MF/O2/Ar low-pressure combustion provided the equivalence ratio between the range of 0.8–1.5. As a result, the H-abstraction reaction was identified as the dominant reaction pathway for the consumption of MF using the information obtained from the species identification. Besides, the addition reactions of the OH radicals to the furan ring structure also demonstrated its significant role as a reaction pathway while the presence of 2-oxo-2,3-dihydrofuran was found. In another study, Cheng et al. [247] performed a similar experiment to Wei et al. [286] using the same parameters to investigate the low-pressure laminar premixed flames in MF/O2/Ar fuel combustion. The above study offered a modification to the previous MF model obtained from Somers et al. [240] by introducing several formation and consumption reactions involving the key chemical species. The revised model was utilized in identifying possible reaction pathways in MF consumption process. An investigation on the laminar burning properties of MF/iso-octane blends was conducted under a wide range of temperature and equivalence ratio conditions [287]. As a result, the values obtained for the unstretched flame speeds and laminar burning velocities for both fuel blends were identified within the range of those observed in the combustion of pure fuels. For both blends, the highest values for the unstretched flame speeds were obtained at the equivalence ratios between 1.1 and 1.2 similar to that of MF (Fig. 14 ) [287]. On the other hand, measurements of Markstein length were shown to approximate that of iso-octane provided that the equivalence ratios fell below 1.2. Among the three fuels, MF demonstrated the fastest burning velocity subjected to all different conditions. In a different study, Tao et al. [288] took a closer look at the possible effect of changing the initial relative pressure and mixing percentage of the fuel blends on the flame characteristics. To achieve their objectives, the authors applied several blends of MF and gasoline containing between 10% and 50% of MF in a constant-volume bomb. The results revealed an inverse relationship between laminar flame speed and critical flame radius with the ambient pressure. Specifically, higher ambient pressures were shown to reduce both these laminar flame-related parameters. An increase in the MF proportion within the fuel blend has led to an enhancement to the laminar flame speed (i.e., faster propagation speed), smaller flame radius, and increased flame instability. According to Gillespie [289], elevated temperatures further promoted increases in burning velocities peaking at an equivalence ratio of 1.1. Compared to DMF, MF exhibited faster laminar burning velocities as much as 18 cm/s at an equivalence ratio of 1.1. Also tested on the combustion of DMF and MF, Tran et al. [219] examined the structure of the laminar premixed flame for these two fuels under rich burning and low-pressure conditions. The study was able to provide mole fraction profiles with the inclusion of several species (i.e., 31 products and 40 intermediates for MF and DMF, respectively), as well as the formation of other heavy aromatics. The presence of heavy aromatics was more readily available in the combustion of DMF than MF. The results provided inputs into the revised kinetic models of DMF and MF to include updated reactions involving C8 aromatics and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). To determine the formation of small nanoparticles and soot aggregates, Sirignano et al. [290] looked further into the counter flow diffusion flames of MF, DMF, and furan. Based on the experimental results, the authors observed an increase in particle formation in the combustion of all furan-based fuels. Particularly, furan yielded the lowest amount of particles compared to MF and DMF. Among the latter fuels, MF was indicated as the one with the highest particle production obtained from its combustion. Recently, Sahu et al. [277] have conducted an investigation backed by the experimental and numerical study of the MF flame extinction characteristics. Specifically, the counter flow diffusion flames were examined at atmospheric pressure for fuel mixtures containing two different iso-octane blends, 25:75 and 50:50. The authors indicated that the limits on the flame extinction increased with higher fuel loadings. Besides, a higher proportion of MF over iso-octane also contributed positively to the resistance to flame extinction. Under low-fuel loading conditions, only a minor effect on the extinction limit of MF flames could be observed by adding iso-octane to the fuel mixture. However, the action reduced the resistance to flame extinction at higher fuel loadings [291]. Concerning MF flames, the leading reactions in the MF consumption were dominated by the abstraction of hydrogen atoms by CH3 and H that led to the formation of MF22J. Subsequently, the following ring-opening reaction was primarily responsible for the conversion of MF from P3E1O2J-C2 through addition reactions of hydrogen [277]. Considering the application of MF in existing models of internal combustion engines, there might be opportunities for greater energy efficiency and reduced pollutant emissions. Due to the high instability of the propagating spherical flame observed in the combustion of MF/air mixture, the combustion is subjected to a variety of different conditions such as pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio that highly resemble the normal conditions in a typical internal combustion engine during operation. Taking both the experimental and analytical approach, Oppong et al. [292] applied theoretical linear stability modeling in studying the inherent instability of the spherical outward flames produced by the MF/air combustion. As a result, the authors revealed higher flame instability produced by the burning of rich fuel mixtures. Initially, the high stretch intensity and flame curvature supported the general stability observed in the spherical flame front. Nevertheless, the flame cellularity was eventually initiated by the thermal-diffusion instability. The stretch effect and flame stability were observed to be limited by the rising flame front radius. The authors also pointed out the thermal-diffusion and hydrodynamic instabilities were primarily responsible for the formation of the cellular structure. As the growth of cells increased and the flame front expanded, the flame structure eventually became completely cellular. As shown in Fig. 15 a depicting the flame topographies, the general effect of different parameters, including pressure, equivalence ratio, and propagation time could be detected on the laminar flame characteristics such as flame growth, structure, and shape, as well as instability qualities. Likewise, cellularity was also identified in Luo et al. [23] as the main characteristic in the expanding spherical flames observed under high-pressure combustion. Under fuel-rich burning conditions, the authors also indicated the significant presence of the apparition of cellularity in the observed flame speed. As indicated in the experiment performed by Xu et al. [248], an outwardly expanding spherical flame was identified for the laminar burning velocity of the high-pressure combustion of MF/air-fuel mixtures. The maximum laminar burning velocities for the tested fuel mixtures were recorded at equivalence ratios (φ) between 1.1 and 1.2. The experiment also indicated a drastic decline in these values as the fuel mixture became either too rich or too lean. Furthermore, increasing pressure also contributed negatively to the laminar burning velocity resulting in lower flame speeds. Flame self-acceleration was promoted by the presence of flame surface cellularization as seen in Fig. 15b."
8,Engine application,"Known as an eco-friendly biofuel, MF has the opportunity to be mass-produced on a large scale due to recent technological advances. Even though bio-ethanol still ranks as the most popular biofuel application in internal combustion engines, MF has several important properties that compete with bio-ethanol, including better storage stability, higher energy density, and lower overall manufacturing energy use as presented in Table 1. In general, MF is suitable for mixing at low concentrations (i.e., less than 10%) with gasoline for application in standard vehicles. Nonetheless, the concentration of MF could be increased in the case of flex-fuel vehicles [293]. Considering the high risk of toxicity, more thorough investigations on the emission quality of pollutants and environmental impact assessment of MF must be highly warranted and thoroughly studied [222]. Among the available literature focusing on engine applications, several of them have offered comparative studies in terms of engine performance with MF biofuel in comparison with conventional fossil fuels (such as gasoline and diesel). Some studies also assessed the characteristics and performance of different blends of MF with fossil fuels."
9,Spray characteristics,"4.1 Spray characteristics To fully realize the highest potential of direct injection engines, one should be able to understand and have particular control over the spray characteristics of such engines. Nevertheless, the ability to determine the proper fuel distribution remains a challenging task due to the high variability of the internal thermal conditions within the combustion chamber [294]. Upon being subjected to sub-saturation pressure, a superheated fuel spray will undergo a flash boiling. In the case of homogeneously charged combustion ignition, there is a higher chance that the aforementioned phenomenon occurs provided that the early injection mode is applied to DISI engines allowing the absolute cylinder pressure to drop as low as 0.02 MPa. When flash boiling conditions are present, significant changes to droplet behavior can be observed [295]. Particularly, these conditions allow for the reduction in droplet sizes leading to improvement in combustion performance due to better air/fuel mixing. Furthermore, enhanced atomization of fuel spray is possible as a result of the presence of vapor bubbles and their subsequent explosion reactions [296]. For flash boiling spray of multi-hole injectors, higher deformation in fuel spray can also be detected [297–299]. Such spray deformations can result in lowering the quality of fuel/air mixing in the preparation stage that can be attributed to wall impingement [300]. Subsequent dilution of the lubricating oil due to fuel impingement further leads to a super-knocking phenomenon in engines [301]. Because of its higher volatility and lower viscosity, MF spray characteristics are expected to be quite different from those of fossil-based fuels such as gasoline. Compared to MF50 and iso-octane, Ding et al. [302] revealed that MF possessed a lower penetration rate and smaller droplet size relative to the other two fuels in question. In their study, Thewes et al. [303] conducted an investigation in which the spray characteristics of MF were compared with those of ethanol and gasoline RON 95. The fuel spray vapor penetration and distribution were depicted in Fig. 16 a based on a temporal sequence while subjecting the experiment to the same initial conditions observed at the engine operation point during the intake stroke. Because the fuel-air ratios in the combustion of both ethanol and MF were indicated to be lower than the stoichiometric ratio, higher injection times would be required for these two fuels. As a result, such prolonged durations during the fuel injection phase contribute significantly to the increased impingement of fuel on in-cylinder surfaces. As observed in Fig. 16a, there is a higher chance of finding fuel near the exhaust side (left) of the cylinder liner compared to the result obtained from RON 95. According to Mathieu et al. [304], the macroscopic spray structural characteristics were shown to be highly dependent on the fuel properties that could lead to variation in the formation of vortices through an outward-opening injector. In another study, the spray characteristics and behavior of different blends of MF and gasoline were examined by Wei et al. [305] utilizing a multi-hole injector for DISI engines. Comparisons on the spray characteristics were provided in Fig. 16b for M20, M40, and gasoline. Larger initial cone angles and air entrainment phenomena were detected in the flash boiling spray that indicated better spray distribution under low-pressure conditions [305]. At higher MF ratios, more rapid evaporation of the fuel components leads to a reduction in spray penetration. Furthermore, a rise in the percentage of MF in the fuel blend also results in a larger spray area and increased sensitivity to temperature variation. Due to its lower boiling temperature, the increase in MF component relative to gasoline in the fuel blend contributes to a lower pointing point of the significant portion of the fuel components. As a result, greater support for the flash boiling phenomenon could be detected under low ambient pressure conditions. Besides, the violent collapse of the spray front end could also be observed at the flash boiling point. Hence, a higher spray penetration could be attributed to the jet-like spray. In Wang et al. [306], the authors examined the near-field spray behaviors of three different fuels, including MF, ethanol, and iso-octane, subjected to flash boiling conditions. The initial decomposition was the most prominent in MF combustion relative to the other two fuels because of the higher vapor pressure. Among the three tested fuels, MF also exhibited the lowest spray velocity due to its high density. When the flare-flash boiling phenomenon occurred, the nearly complete atomization of MF was detected as early as the fuel exiting from the nozzle leading to a delay in the formation of the liquid core. Wider spray angles were also observed in MF relative to ethanol and iso-octane during the steady stage. Upon examining the measurements, researchers have confirmed the potential of MF as a promising biofuel alternative due to its strong performance compared to other tested fuels. Indeed, the experiments have detected higher evaporation rates in MF combustion compared to that of ethanol. On the other hand, it also either evaporates more rapidly or close to the rates observed in the case of RON 95."
10,Combustion characteristics,"4.2 Combustion characteristics 4.2.1 Combustion duration and ignition delay The fact shows that MF has a higher RON number than gasoline, demonstrating that it could be applied in SI engines with higher compression ratios without engine knocking combustion. Moreover, the use of MF in SI engines is also deemed more advantageous compared to gasoline alternatives such as bioethanol. For example, because MF does not dissolve in water, mixing it with gasoline making the blend more stable. Furthermore, the lower latent heat of vaporization offers the benefit of MF application in resolving the cold-start problem. Compared to bioethanol, MF has a 34% higher energy density leading to better fuel consumption. Considering these preferred properties, MF offers important advantages as a promising alternative biofuel for spark ignition (SI) engine application. For the combustion process, a mass fraction burned (MFB) analysis was performed on the fuel combustion process in which its profile was characterized as a function of the cumulative percentage of energy output against different crank angle positions throughout the combustion cycle. According to the result of the MFB, the profile followed an S-shape curve depicting an increasing gradient from the spark discharge to the maximum position at the midway point in the combustion process [307]. Beyond this peak, the value started to decrease down to near zero as the quenching of the propagating flame front took place [308]. According to Wei et al. [309], the combustion analysis of M10, E10, and gasoline application in an SI engine showed the highest burning rate for M10 relative to the other two fuels (Fig. 17 a). Generally, the combustion duration (CD) is nearly captured by the MFB profile in the interval between 10% and 90% representing a significant portion of the consumed fuel and the amount of chemical energy released within the combustion process. As observed, M10 and gasoline demonstrated the shortest and longest CD found on the full speed spectrum, respectively (Fig. 17b). Similar conclusions were supported by previous studies [311,312]. According to Jiang et al. [313], the shortest CD was observed in MF relative to that of the others fuels subjected to lean-burn combustion. Among the tested fuels, DMF, gasoline, and ethanol have the shortest to longest combustion duration after MF in that order. Under increasing leaner burning conditions, a sharp drop in flame propagation speed could be detected. Particularly, an increase in combustion time was measured at an air/fuel ratio of 1.5 provided that early second injection timing could be ensured. Moreover, M10 was observed to be 1 CAD and 3 CAD ahead of E10 and gasoline, respectively. Several parameters, such as laminar flame speed, in-cylinder charge, and turbulence motion, and the air-fuel equivalence ratio, could have a major effect on the combustion heat release rate (HRR). According to the results from earlier studies, MF demonstrated the fastest laminar flame speed (70 cm/s) followed by ethanol (65 cm/s) and iso-octane (52.5 cm/s) subjected to the same initial test conditions [285,314]. Moreover, the evaporation duration of in-cylinder spray for MF was observed to be shorter than that of both ethanol and gasoline [303]. Consequently, the combustion of an air-fuel mixture with a relatively higher equivalence ratio was deemed favorable for sustaining the flame propagation. Furthermore, there has been evidence of reduced combustion duration resulting from a higher proportion of oxygen in the fuel mixture [315]. Several studies have shown the fast burning speed of oxygenated hydrocarbon fuels compared to those without the presence of oxygen molecules [316,317]. Hence, the two fuel blends of MF and ethanol with gasoline demonstrated shorter CDs relative to pure gasoline. Comparing between M10 and E10, the differences in CD were mainly driven by the dominant cooling effect observed in ethanol because of its higher latent heat of vaporization. In the case of diesel engines, MF application was observed to increase CD relative to that of diesel fuel (Fig. 17c) [24]. Compared to biodiesel, blends of MF and biodiesel exhibited shorter CD when compared with pure biodiesel [19]. More importantly, Donahue et al. [318] have found out that highly oxygenated fuel blends enhanced oxidation while limiting the pyrolysis process leading to overall shorter combustion durations. As reported, the shorter initial combustion and CD prove to be beneficial to MF combustion due to the increased stability [16]. As shown in Fig. 17d, MF has consistently demonstrated the lower coefficient of variations (COV) of IMEP among the above three fuels [16]. Due to the increased combustion stability, MF application outperforms the other fuels when being subjected to lean-burn highly stratified combustion in engines. Thus, the lower risk of misfire phenomenon results in a dramatic reduction in the residue of unburned HC. In their recent study, Jiang et al. [313] provided a comparative analysis on the effect of split-injection mode on MF combustion in SI engines against other fuels. As a result, the authors observed the lowest COV of IMEP for MF compared to the other tested fuels. Besides, the air/fuel ratio and injection timing were observed to be two important factors affecting COV. In another study, an experiment was conducted by Wei et al. [319] on an SI engine to assess the possible effects of spark ignition timing on COV of MF against different blends of MF and gasoline. The authors detected a positive correlation between the spark timing and volume percentage of MF in the blend. Particularly, the higher MF volume fraction led to advanced spark timing. Examining the results obtained from the spark timing sweeps, a general lower sensitivity was observed in MF subjected to variation in COV between 1.6% and 3.2%. On the other hand, a more significant change in COV of IMEP was detected in the case of gasoline ranging from 1.5% to 8%. Based on these results, more stable combustion could be achieved by adding MF to the fuel blends leading to a different spark timing relative to the optimized one. Moreover, several other benefits, including higher combustion efficiency and shorter CD, could be realized by the application of oxygenated fuels such as MF [303,309]. Besides CD, studies have also focused on the ignition delay of MF combustion in engines. Among these, Jiang et al. [313] experimented with MF and several other fuels in an SI engine while examining the difference in the ignition delays as a result of varying injection timing. Due to the relatively fast combustion, MF was observed to have the shortest ignition delay. When examining the fuel combustion under a lean-burn condition, the authors observed a decline in ignition delays as the time difference between the injection and spark timing got closer [313]. In the case of diesel engines, MF application was observed to lengthen the ignition delay as a higher volume percentage of MF was added to the diesel fuel (Fig. 17e) [24]. Researchers have relied on the fuel properties to explain the above phenomenon. The longer ignition delay could be attributed to the lower in-cylinder temperature which was mainly the result of MF's higher latent heat of vaporization. Additionally, the higher auto-ignition temperature and lower cetane number of MF were factors contributing to the increase in ignition delay. Furthermore, it could also found that adding MF to biodiesel blends could promote the ignition delay (Fig. 17f) [310]. Particularly, the addition of MF increased the equivalence ratio leading to higher in-cylinder temperature and enhanced fuel atomization. As a result, the conditions allowed for better and more uniform mixing of the fuel mixture. In some instances, particularly at low loads, the combustion of biodiesel and MF blends demonstrated a shorter ignition delay relative to that of pure biodiesel. Due to its low level of viscosity, the increased amount of MF could enhance the fuel atomization of the fuel blends resulting in better mixing, promoting combustion, and reducing the ignition delay [320,321]. 4.2.2 Heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure Recently, Singh et al. [264] have evaluated the combustion characteristics of several different fuel blends containing MF. They found that the addition of MF was indicated to positively enhance the ignition delay time subjected to low to intermediate combustion temperatures. Such results revealed the advantage offered by MF that created a favorable condition for the knock-limited spark advance in engines [312]. Furthermore, the total suppression of reactivity at low temperature could be detected in the combustion of MF-containing fuel blends resulting in the lengthening of ignition delay times observed in both RON and MON tests [264]. The above phenomenon could be attributed to the fuel's high octane sensitivity. Several studies have demonstrated the capability to reproduce the fuel characteristics demonstrated under the RON and MON test conditions by referencing the ignition delay detected for a homogenous batch reactor subjected to a constant temperature and pressure [322–324]. The auto-ignition (or knock) characteristics of the end-gas region could be determined based on the above-referenced conditions. Besides, results from the reactivity analysis have indicated the significant presence of OH and HO2 as the dominant markers found in the radical pool. In the case of PRF60-80/MF20 in which PRF60 refers to the primary reference fuel having an octane index of 60, longer ignition delay times were observed in the above fuel blend compared to those observed in PRF60-80/Ethanol20 blend and PRF60-80/Toluene20 blend although MF exhibited a higher level of volatility than both ethanol and toluene. Excellent quality in suppressing low-temperature chemistry was obtained from kinetic analysis focusing on MF application in various fuel blends [264]. According to several studies, researchers have concluded the significant role of advanced spark timing and short combustion duration in elevating the peak pressure observed in MF applications in SI engines [309,311]. A positive contributing factor to the peak in-cylinder pressure of MF could be attributed to the reduced combustion duration that resulted in the higher amount of energy being released near the top dead center position. Compared to gasoline, MF was able to achieve much a higher peak pressure due to the positive benefits from both advanced spark timing and shorter combustion duration [311]. Indeed, considering the heat released rate of MF, Ma et al. [287] observed a faster flame speed in the combustion of MF relative to that of iso-octane that resulted in the former's high peak ROHR. A notable study that has laid the foundation in the investigation of MF flame indicated higher reactivity of MF compared to iso-octane [325]. The authors demonstrated the chemical characteristics of MF in supporting the above claim. Agreeable conclusions could also be found from the present study which showcased the fastest combustion rate for MF applications [325]. Furthermore, the higher addition of MF was seen to enhance the HRR and in-cylinder pressure (Fig. 18 a) [319]. Among other combustion characteristics, the peak temperature in the combustion process has shown a high level of consistency to the trend detected for its in-cylinder peak pressure [326,327]. According to Wei et al. [309], the authors revealed the lowest peak temperatures in the E10 blend compared to M10 and gasoline even though it exhibited a shorter combustion duration than gasoline. Besides, lower temperatures were recorded for both the in-cylinder charge and the combustion in the case of ethanol due to its higher latent heat of vaporization (Fig. 18b) [309]. In general, compared to UG, the greater oxygen concentration in MF could be the driving factor behind this trend. Besides, the higher laminar flame speed contributed toward decreasing the ignition delay that was responsible for the earlier peak in the observed trend curve [328]. As pointed out previously, despite the benefits of increased burning velocity and short combustion duration on minimizing auto-ignition and knocking, these properties of MF could also lead to higher peak pressure subjected to full engine load [329]. Indeed, a new method was proposed to determine and quantify the knock intensity that relied on the filtered in-cylinder pressure trace to separately identify the behavior of pressure oscillations generated during knocking conditions [330,331]. Using the spark crank angle, researchers were able to identify the knock limit provided that greater than 10% of all cycles were knocking and the measured knocking intensity was greater than 100 kPa [332]. Utilizing this proposed technique, Pan et al. [22] attempted at measuring the in-cylinder pressure and oscillations for MF and gasoline subjected to various EGR rates at CR10. Between these two tested fuels, a larger interval was detected in the pressure oscillations of gasoline combustion relative to MF in the absence of EGR (Fig. 18c). Hence, gasoline could be said to possess a higher tendency of knocking. Besides, a sharp drop in the peak pressure oscillations could be detected for both MF and gasoline under increasing EGR rates while the latter exhibited a significantly stronger trend [22]. According to Hoppe et al. [312], the authors confirmed the limitation of the vaporization enthalpy because it may otherwise result in engine failure during cold start. Upon examining three different fuels, including MF, 2-butanol, and 3- methyl-butanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol, and n-propanol, the authors assessed the characteristics of each of these fuels in terms of their potential in limiting the risk of abnormal combustion (i.e., knocking). Among these candidates, 2-butanol and MF outperformed the rest of them in their properties. As compared MF to ethanol, they also found that it would be possible to achieve compression ratios above 13.5 for both ethanol and MF because of their high knock resistance [312]. Similarly, an improvement on the anti-knock characteristic of MF application in engines was found to be equal to or better than that observed in the case of ethanol and gasoline [333]. Furthermore, an increasing trend in the ignition delay times was observed in the unburned fuel-air mixture regions inside the combustion chamber that could be attributed to the higher heat of vaporization. Consequently, higher knock resistance could be detected in the case of ethanol compared to MF even though both fuels exhibited similar ignition delay times [334]. Furthermore, higher knock resistance was detected in MF application relative to gasoline as reported by Hoppe et al. [335] that could yield up to 20% in energy efficiency at full engine load. In another study, Thewes et al. [303] detected a higher knock resistance in MF applications compared to gasoline resulting in close to 9.9% efficiency improvement at full engine load. Recently, Tamara et al. [336] also observed similar results by confirming the lowest pre-ignition resistance in MF out of the examined alternative transport fuels, similar conclusions were found in Hülser et al. [307]. For the diesel engine application, there have been several research works focusing on the in-cylinder pressure and HRR of MF and its blends [24,337]. As reported, MF-based diesel blends exhibited similar in-cylinder pressure and HRR curves to 100% diesel (Fig. 18d) [24]. However, a drop in the peak pressure was detected along with the rise in MF ratio [338]. Concerning the HRR, increasing the MF volume fraction in the diesel-MF blends could promote the peak HRR. Furthermore, analysis performed on the phases of premixed combustion in diesel-MF blend applications indicated significant retardation due to the higher percentage of MF. This result was believed that delay in combustion could be attributed to fuel's low cetane number that resulted in a larger amount of fuel being burnt in the premixed phase [339]. In this case, the higher maximum heat release rate was detected for MF [340]. On the contrary, higher MF volume fractions in diesel blends caused a significant decrease in both in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate under low engine loads. Such a phenomenon could be explained by the combination of low cetane number and high latent heat of vaporization that promoted higher volatility and instability in the combustion and higher chances of engine misfiring. Similar observations were made in the case of MF-biodiesel blends [19,310]. Under high engine load conditions, increasing MF fraction in the fuel blends resulted in the overall increase in both the peak in-cylinder pressure and HRR. Considering the higher amount of oxygenated compounds in MF, the higher concentration of MF further promoted the diffusion ignition process."
11,Engine performance,"4.3 Engine performance For a typical internal combustion engine, the ability to turn the chemical energy of fuels into mechanical power as output is measured by the brake thermal efficiency (BTE). As an important variable, BTE provides significant insight into potential engine performance [341,342]. As pointed out by Wang et al. [16], the energy loss due to the heat transfer negatively affected the indicated thermal efficiency. Particularly, the higher heat transfer loss was detected on the sides of the cylinder under elevated combustion temperatures. Compared to ethanol, MF was observed to have a lower net indicated thermal efficiency (Fig. 19 a) [16]. It could be attributed to the higher combustion temperature of MF as referenced by its peak in-cylinder pressure. Similar results were also provided in the following published research [309,312,313]. Moreover, the higher availability of oxygenated compounds in MF enhanced and promoted complete combustion compared to that of gasoline. Besides, the faster combustion of MF could also be attributed to its higher latent heat of vaporization allowing for greater absorption of heat and causing fuel droplets to quickly evaporate. Hence, the short combustion duration of MF could reduce the potential energy loss from heat transfer. The volumetric efficiency could be enhanced by the low-temperature intake charge. Consequently, better BTE was achieved by the lower energy requirement in the compression stroke to provide the same level of mechanical power output [343]. Furthermore, the higher laminar flame speed detected in MF combustion also ensured the maintenance of a continuously turbulent mixing and greater fuel mixture homogeneity [344]. For diesel engines, considering the application of MF-based blends in diesel engines, several studies have shown improved BTE by adding MF into either diesel or biodiesel (Fig. 19b) [19,24]. Among the different parameters, researchers have pointed out the primary significance of combustion duration, combustion phase, and concentration of the oxygenated amount in influencing the BTE [345,346]. The combustion duration of MF-fuel blends was detected to be shorter than that of pure diesel. The shorter combustion duration was beneficial to the BTE due to the constant volume combustion. Besides, the overall combustion efficiency was enhanced by the higher concentration of oxygen molecules in MF-based fuels. The increased turbulence of MF further promoted the homogenous mixing of the air-fuel mixture leading to higher BTE [337]. Moreover, utilizing EGR has proved the significant support of MF for the combustion process in engines, this could be because MF application in engines has improved the indicated thermal efficiency due to the higher oxygenated content promoting more complete combustion and more efficient release of chemical energy stored in the fuel [19,22]. However, relating to brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), there were two various changing trends, in which the improvement of BTE and combustion efficiency of engines fueled with oxygenated MF could be a reason for the decrease of BSFC [19]. In contrast, the lower heating value of MF compared to gasoline and diesel fuel could be considered as another cause of increasing BSFC [16,24]."
12,Emission parameters,"4.4 Emission parameters 4.4.1 Regulated emissions In the assessment of the potential performance of different fuels in engines, researchers have looked into examine the emissions characteristics of their combustions. Produced from the incomplete burning of fossil fuels and biofuels, CO is known for its potency as a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and poisonous gas. Upon inhalation, CO can shut off the oxygen supply to cells in the human body by attaching to hemoglobin as much as 240 times the affinity that of oxygen [347]. The fuel-air equivalence ratio is an important factor in determining the level of CO emissions. The higher the ratio is, the richer the fuel-air mixture becomes [348]. Shorter spray penetration length reduces the likelihood of in-cylinder wall and piston wetting. The fuel vapors sprayed onto the surfaces of the cylinder and piston are less likely to undergo full evaporation. Lower fuel volatility can also be a detriment in sustaining a homogenous fuel mixture [349]. Compared to gasoline, MF combustion yields substantially higher CO emissions. It is because MF contains a higher concentration of volatile species resulting in a higher chance of incomplete combustion. On the other hand, gasoline also exhibits a relatively shorter injection duration and shorter length in terms of spray penetration that minimizes the chance of spray impingement on the cylinder wall and piston crown. Considering these reasons, gasoline often produces the least amount of CO among other fuels in most conditions. Similarly, the high oxygen content present in ethanol promotes more complete combustion [350], leading to a reduction in wetting of the in-cylinder wall and piston. Based on this trend, some studies have reported that MF has higher CO emissions compared with ethanol and gasoline [16,311,313]. On the contrary, selected studies have proposed the idea that the higher availability of oxygenated compounds in MF increases the chance of more complete combustion. Considering the between MF and gasoline, the former has a lower air-fuel ratio (i.e., 10.05 for MF compared to 14.46 for gasoline) indicating a lean burning fuel mixture. It has been shown that lean conditions are more favorable for CO emissions reduction [309]. As reported, general retardation in the spark timing would negatively affect the combustion efficiency [351]. Even though MF-based additives have demonstrated excellent oxygen enrichment quality, it is less likely to sustain complete combustion considering the aforementioned phenomenon. Hence, adding MF into various blends of gasoline has been found to lower the CO emissions relative to that of pure gasoline (Fig. 20 a) [352], this conclusion is identified among existing references [22,309]. Considering diesel engine applications, increased CO emissions have been detected in the combustion of diesel-MF fuel blends under lower engine loads. Particularly, CO emissions are observed to be positively correlated with the MF volume fraction in the diesel-MF blends. Typically, important factors influencing the CO emissions include air-fuel equivalence ratio, combustion duration, and temperature [353,354]. The lower CO emissions in the combustion of pure diesel compared to diesel-MF blends can be attributed to the lean burning mixture (i.e., high air-fuel ratio) and increased combustion duration. Furthermore, pure diesel fuels exhibit a generally lower level of volatility that can lead to a more diluted air-fuel mixture under low engine load conditions. Hence, lower CO emissions can be expected in pure diesel combustion in this case [355]. Alternatively, the combustion of MF has been shown to form CO based on the pyrolysis analysis [231]. Under low combustion temperature, the incompletion oxidation of MF tends to produce more CO (Fig. 20b) [24]. A similar increasing trend in CO emissions could also be observed between MF and biodiesel [310]. On the other hand, a lower and more stable level of CO emissions has been detected under higher engine loads. As the combustion temperature increases along with the engine load (i.e., above 1400 K), the relatively fast oxidation of CO is seen as an important intermediate in the chemical reaction kinetics in forming CO2 [356]. Indeed, under increased engine loads, the higher combustion temperatures provide the perfect condition for more complete burning of the fuel and thus further lower the overall CO emissions. When the incomplete combustion of fuels in engines occurs, the release of unburned hydrocarbons or HCs can occur [357]. For engine application, examining the emissions of HCs can offer important insight into the characteristics of the air-fuel mixture and its behavior during the combustion process. Indeed, for the majority of fuel types, an inverse correlation can be observed between HC emissions and engine load [358]. As load increases, the higher in-cylinder temperature favors the post-oxidization process of HCs, leading to lower emission levels. Studies have reported this phenomenon in the case of MF, ethanol, and gasoline. Furthermore, higher oxygen content found in the combusted fuels also results in lower HC emissions (Fig. 20c) [16]. Hence, it can be anticipated that MF produces lower HC emissions compared to gasoline but higher than ethanol, this conclusion has been supported by several studies [309,313,352]. Concerning fuel applications in diesel engines, blends of MF with either biodiesel or diesel fuel have shown lower levels of HCs emissions for blends containing less than 30% of MF fraction. The higher oxygen amount in MF has a positive effect in promoting the oxidization of HC. Subjected to low engine load conditions, the addition of MF can reduce the HC emissions by further increasing the volatility of the fuel blends compared to biodiesel and diesel [359]. The above phenomenon is explained by the initial destabilization of combustion caused by a combined effect of low in-cylinder temperature and high auto-ignition temperature [360]. On the other hand, the increase in the fuel spray penetration length is the result of the reduced in-cylinder pressure due to the low engine load. As a result, a considerable amount of fuel is sprayed onto the cylinder wall, leading to wall quenching and higher HC emissions. Upon increasing the engine load, one can expect the higher in-cylinder temperature to promote the post-oxidization of unburnt hydrocarbons resulting in lower HC emissions (Fig. 20d) [310]. There are several key explanations associated with the lower levels of HC emissions observed for various MF-based fuel blends at higher loads. First, the enhanced post-oxidization of HC emissions is supported primarily by the elevated temperature in the MF-diesel blend combustion. Second, the higher availability of oxygenated compounds in the MF-based fuel blends further facilitate the oxidization of HC emissions [19]. According to several studies, the production of thermal NOx from the oxidation of nitrogen occurring in the post-flame region plays a key role in the emissions of nitrogen monoxide (NO) [341,361]. Higher activation energy is required for the O + N2 = NO + N reaction because the triple bond found in the nitrogen molecules is not easy to disassociate. Hence, it limits the rate of NO production [362,363]. Furthermore, because the NO reaction is highly endothermic, extremely high temperature (i.e., 1800 K) is necessary for its activation under stoichiometric conditions. Subsequently, the temperature starts to decrease as the reaction moves further away from the stoichiometric ratio. Free oxygen atoms can be formed by severing the bond in O2 molecules. Under a high-temperature environment, these free-moving oxygen atoms then react with nitrogen molecules that kickstarted a chain mechanism proposed by Zeldovich [364]. In a typical gasoline engine, the N + O2 = NO + O reaction can only be initiated under a clean-burning condition in which there is an ample supply of oxygen. The resulting stoichiometric combustion further leads to a rise in in-cylinder temperature that further promotes the NO formation [364]. Besides, NO can also be produced through the conversion of amines via several different intermediates, in which the formation of amines is considered as the result of the interaction between hydrocarbon radicals and nitrogen molecules [365]. Facts show that several key parameters, including in-cylinder temperatures, oxygen content, and reaction duration, play a significant role in determining the level of NOx emissions [366,367]. Fuels containing higher amounts of oxygenated compounds produces higher NOx emissions [368]. For the MF case, it was found that MF-based fuel blends have higher NO emissions compared to gasoline. Furthermore, several studies have observed increasing trends in NO emissions with increasing the percentage of MF fraction [352]. Notably, the higher amount of oxygen content present in MF increases the air-fuel ratio in the fuel-rich regions that results in higher in-cylinder temperature and more complete burning of fuel [369]. Besides, the flame propagation is enhanced by the increased laminar flame speed demonstrated by the combustion of MF-based fuel blends [285,370]. As a result, the more complete combustion of oxygenated fuels enhanced the overall energy efficiency under higher in-cylinder temperatures. As shown in Fig. 21 a, changes in NOx emissions subjected to a wide range of engine speeds exhibit similar trends to those observed in the in-cylinder peak temperature and pressure [309]. Overall, NOx emissions can be expected to increase exponentially with rising in-cylinder combustion temperature. According to the combustion analysis, the highest peak temperature value obtained for MF combustion generally corresponds to the lower enthalpy of vaporization. Furthermore, the carbon/hydrogen ratio for ethanol and MF has been measured at 0.5 and 0.2, respectively [309]. These conditions favor the formation of CO2 over H2O. Considering the fact that water has a higher mass-specific heat capacity than CO2, it is possible to attain a higher temperature in the MF flame. This can also offer a potential explanation for the high NOx emissions of MF-based fuel blends. Among the tested fuels, ethanol exhibits the lowest level of NOx emissions due to its more prominent cooling effect. For diesel engine applications, the lower viscosity of MF compared to pure diesel fuel and biodiesel promotes improvement in fuel spray and atomization resulting in a more homogenous fuel mixture. Furthermore, reduced NOx emissions can be expected from fuels with higher H–C ratios [371], while MF-diesel blends tend to have lower H–C ratios [337]. Overall, adding MF into diesel blends increases NOx emissions although these rising trends can vary by the different ratios found in the fuel blends (Fig. 21b) [24]. Notably, EGR application could offer a solution in overcoming the high NOx emissions from MF combustion. In their study, Pan et al. [22] indicated the potential effect of cold EGR design on the characteristics and combustion behavior of fuel mixtures at different compression ratios. Under rising CR, a drastic increase in NOx emissions was confirmed by these authors. The results further lend support to the fact that the increased combustion temperatures under elevated CR conditions favor the production of NOx. In terms of NOx emissions, MF has shown a relatively high level compared to that of gasoline and pure diesel. However, the use of external EGR at proper rates could potentially alleviate these concerns. For soot emission, there are several key factors influencing soot emissions in engines. The amount of oxygen content present in the fuel is an important parameter as it can affect the efficiency of the combustion and ultimately the formation of soot. The availability of oxygenated compounds plays a key role in reducing the level of soot emissions [372]. Furthermore, the promotion of diffusive combustion is supported by the addition of MF, which is known for its high oxygen content. Long ignition delay is another key parameter in soot reduction, the longer the time the air-fuel mixture is allowed in the preparation phase is beneficial to the overall combustion quality and lower soot emissions [20,373]. Hence, the addition of MF into blends of diesel and biodiesel has significant potential in improving the soot emissions performance compared to pure diesel or biodiesel. In an experiment conducted by Xiao et al. [24], the soot emissions performance of diesel/MF blends at various MF mass fractions was compared to that of pure diesel in a four-cylinder engine subjected to a range of different engine loads. Overall, these blends outperformed pure diesel in terms of soot emissions reduction. For other blends examined in the study, a general decline in soot emissions for the MF case was observed among all the conditions. In most blend ratios, the measured soot was approximately zero except for M40 under low engine load (Fig. 21c). The primary driver behind the reduction of soot production is the increased availability of oxygenated compounds in MF that promoted diffusive combustion. Another significant contributor to the lower soot emissions of MF blends was the extended ignition delay. As the air-fuel mixture was better prepared during this longer premixed period, it could enhance the combustion efficiency and lead to higher lower levels of soot emissions. In another similar study, Xiao et al. [374] tested the emissions of different MF/diesel blends on a DICI engine under different load conditions. In conclusion, the authors confirmed a rise in the number of small particles among the combustion of these fuel blends compared to pure diesel. On the other hand, the opposite was observed for large particles. The increase in the oxygen amount contained in MF played a key role in enhancing the oxidation process and reducing the size of the particles supported by the better overall combustion quality and increased in-cylinder temperature. Additionally, the authors also pointed out the reduction in soot precursors with the increased presence of oxygenated compounds along with the addition of MF fraction. In another study by Xiao et al. [337], the authors pointed to the improved physicochemical characteristics of the MF/diesel blend, particularly higher volatility, increased availability of oxygenated compounds, longer ignition delay, and lower quantity of aromatic substances have contributed positively toward improving the PM emissions. Among the different MF mass fraction ratios, the combustion of the 30%MF/70%diesel fuel blend under various pilot injection timings yielded the most reduction in nucleation mode particles, while a rise in the number of accumulation mode particles was detected. The similar result could also be found for the blends of MF and biodiesel [310]. In the case of SI engines, higher soot emissions were confirmed by Hoppe et al. [312] for E5 (5% ethanol+95% gasoline) operated at an engine load above 0.6 MPa IMEP (Fig. 21d). The partial increase in soot emissions from ethanol combustion observed under the lowest and highest engine loads could be suspected from the reduction in the homogenous mixing during the pre-combustion phase. On the other hand, generally low levels of soot formation have been detected for MF under a wide range of engine loads. According to Ma et al. [287], a more luminous flame was detected in MF combustion compared to that of isooctane. The enhanced brightness observed in the MF flame was said to be the result of the increased combustion temperatures and higher soot concentrations [375]. In a previous work by the same authors, the adiabatic flame temperature observed in MF combustion was measured close to 3% higher than that of gasoline under stoichiometric conditions [284]. Furthermore, MF also demonstrated the highest in-cylinder flame temperature among the different test fuels (Fig. 14). However, the authors detected a somewhat lower brightness in the MF flame compared to gasoline [287]. Soot concentration was confirmed to be driving the luminance of the observed flame. In other words, the better brightness of the flame that was observed, the higher the soot production could be detected. Nevertheless, previous results obtained in other experimental works showed contrasting results which suggested lower particular matter emissions in the MF combustion compared to those measured for gasoline [16]. Those conclusions were provided on the premise of the increased oxygen content present in the molecular makeup of MF. Because of the circular molecular structures, a greater amount of soot could be expected from MF combustion compared to that of isooctane. On the other hand, the presence of the oxygenated compound, however, limited the soot formation to a greater extent as a result of better oxidation than in the case of isooctane combustion. These competing processes ultimately canceled out each other in balancing the soot emissions measured in the final emission [287]. For the particulate matter (PM) emission, the size distribution of PM can be grouped into two different modes, including nucleation mode and accumulation mode [376]. While the nucleation model is said to exert a greater influence on the number of particles, the latter mode is primarily responsible for determining the mass distribution of the particles given their relatively larger size. There is a general overlap between these two different modes in both MF and gasoline combustion. Hence, a diameter range has been utilized to provide a better distinction between nucleation and accumulation modes [377,378]. According to Wang et al. [16], the average diameter of the nucleation mode of MF was measured to be only half the size of the same mode observed in gasoline (i.e., 21.6 nm vs. 41.7 nm) (Fig. 22 a). On the other hand, no significant difference could be detected between the accumulation modes of those two fuels. Furthermore, the authors detected an average of 57.9% fewer nucleation modes in MF compared to that of gasoline. In terms of mass, the accumulation mode of MF has a significantly smaller size (i.e., 238.3% less mass) relative to the size measured in the case of gasoline. Furthermore, the PM emissions are directly influenced by the fuel characteristics. Lower soot concentration can be expected from the combustion of fuels such as MF which contains a significantly greater amount of oxygenated compound (O/C = 0.2). The size distribution of the PM is subjected to the level of soot concentration. Increased soot emissions promote the adsorption and condensation of HC in the gaseous form on the particle surface [379]. The effective wet coating of the particles, in turn, limits the available surface for further nucleation. As the adsorption and condensation of HCs on the surface of soot particles, there is a higher probability that larger-size particles are formed by collision and amalgamation of soaked soot particles [380]. Hence, the increased formation of gaseous HC leads to an increase in both the total PM number and the average size of both nucleation and accumulation modes [381,382]. Because MF has a higher concentration of oxygenated compounds, the resulting lower HC production in MF combustion is the key reason for detecting much smaller in terms of mean diameter and fewer PM in its nucleation mode [16,383]. Compared between pure diesel and blends of diesel and MF, Xiao et al. [374] have indicated a higher number of PM produced in the combustion of the latter fuel. As the MF fraction in the fuel blend increased, the authors also measured higher quantities of PM in both nucleation and accumulation modes. The key explanation behind the above conclusion can be pointed to the degraded quality in the fuel sprays of the diesel-MF blend which lowers the overall combustion efficiency. As the diffusive combustion is delayed toward the end of the expansion stroke, the oxidation process of particles is inhibited leading to the higher presence of particles in both nucleation and accumulation models in the exhaust of the blend fuel combustion [384]. For typical diesel fuel, the smaller the local equivalence ratio is, the greater the reduction in terms of particle number [385]. Under rising engine loads, higher MF ratios have been shown to driving up the number of particles, while reducing the particle average size relative to that of pure diesel. The higher presence of oxygenated compounds in MF is responsible for the fewer large-sized particles because of the better oxidation due to the improved combustion quality. Furthermore, the addition of MF in the fuel blend can limit the production of several soot precursors, including acetylene (C2H2) and propargyl (C3H3) [223,386]. The increased combustion temperature led by the higher fraction of MF promotes the oxidization of larger-sized particles and converts them into smaller particles. Hence, higher concentrations of MF can be expected to produce a smaller average diameter of PM. More complete combustion occurring at higher combustion temperatures is favorable for the oxidation of particles [337]. As reported, a distribution range of particle numbers is shown for different tested fuels under various engine load conditions. Generally, a higher MF fraction leads to an increase in the concentration of PN due to the oxygen content and the ring structure of MF. In terms of mass distribution of particles, Fig. 22b also provides these figures for several fuels subjected to different engine loads [374]. Due to the increased availability of oxygen, MF combustion promotes the heat release rate during the premixing and diffusion of the fuel combustion. As a result, these processes further reduce the production of PM and advance their oxidation in the final exhaust. According to the results, M30 exhibits the highest mass concentration of particles under low load conditions. Considering its low cetane number combined with the high latent heat of vaporization, the low efficiency detected in the combustion of M30 results in more volatile combustion and misfire incidents leading to a higher mass concentration of PM [374]. According to Jiang et al. [313], they have observed the highest PN emissions recorded in MF combustion under the stoichiometric condition. Considering the other fuels, DMF, gasoline, and ethanol have the highest to lowest emissions in that order subjected to the stoichiometric burning mixture. On the other hand, a significant drop in PN emissions can be detected in the lean-burning condition of MF, DMF, and gasoline due to the increased availability of excess oxygen and oxidation of soot particles. In this case, the ethanol produces higher PN emissions than MF, DMF, and gasoline due to the high heat of vaporization of ethanol. Indeed, a higher reduction potential of PN can be expected from MF relative to that of ethanol when being subjected to stratified lean-burn combustion. 4.4.2 Unregulated emissions For aldehyde emissions, Wang et al. [387] indicated close to half the amount of formaldehyde emissions was reduced in the combustion of MF relative to those of DMF. The chemical forms of aldehydes with a carbon number >3 were less available relative to those of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the combustion of MF. Fig. 23 a provided a summary of emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, aldehydes having a carbon number between 3 and 6 [387]. Considering the overall emissions of all types of aldehyde (C1–C6), the use of MF was shown to produce significantly fewer amounts of all aldehydes compared to those of gasoline, methanol, ethanol, and butanol [16,387]. It has been well recorded that the combustion of gasoline is a significant source of formaldehyde emissions. Particularly, such emissions were measured to be as much as six times greater than that of MF. Several possible production routes were identified in gasoline combustion that could produce formaldehyde, such as CH3 + O2 → CH3O2 → … → CH2O + OH, and through the oxidation reaction involving ethylene (C2H4) [388,389]. Similarly, higher levels of formaldehyde emissions could also be detected in the case of methanol due to the fair resemblance in the molecular structure of these fuels [390,391]. As for MF combustion, the oxidation of ethyl (CH3CH2), which was a product of methyl radical, was the main driver behind the formation of acetaldehyde [387]. On the other hand, Tran et al. [231] indicated the significant role of ethylene oxidation in the emissions of acetaldehyde during MF combustion. Among the tested fuels, the highest emissions of acetaldehyde were recorded for ethanol as the H-abstraction reaction accounted for a significant portion of acetaldehyde formation (>35%) during the ethanol combustion process [390,392]. Based on the results obtained by Zhu et al. [393] from a CI application, they concluded that fuels with a higher concentration of oxygen content emitted higher quantities of acetaldehyde relative to pure diesel fuel. At low engine loads, the incompletion combustion caused by the low combustion temperature was primarily responsible for the formation of acetaldehyde. On the other hand, the higher amount of MF enhanced the emissions of acetaldehyde due to the increased oxygen content in the combusted fuel. The lower paraffin content in MF molecular was also known to further limit the emissions of acetaldehyde [374]. According to Sirignano et al. [290], significant production of C4 species (e.g., 1,3-butadiene and its radicals) was detected in the most primary reaction pathways in the pyrolysis of MF. The higher availability of these intermediates likely promoted further production of benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been known to be common soot precursors. In their study, Xiao et al. [374] provided a comparative analysis on the emissions of 1,3-butadiene from diesel engines operating at different loads. At elevated engine loads, a drop in 1,3-butadiene emissions was detected (Fig. 23b) [374], this result was highly agreed with Takada et al. [255]. The decrease in 1,3-butadiene emissions could be attributed to the enhanced oxidation promoted by the high-temperature combustion at increased engine loads. Similarly, higher MF mass fractions also contributed toward lowering the 1,3-butadiene emissions. Particularly, the increased oxygen content in MF was a conduit to enhance the combustion temperature which was deemed favorable to the oxidation of 1,3-butadiene. In addition to the availability of oxygenated compounds, the presence of olefins could have a significant impact on the emissions of 1,3-butadiene [394]. Compared to diesel, no detectable amount of hydrocarbon species containing large amounts of olefins were known to be responsible for the formation of 1,3-butadiene in the application of MF-diesel blends in diesel engines [374]. As compared to biodiesel, blending MF into biodiesel blends was also found to reduce 1,3- butadiene and acetaldehyde [19]. For benzene emissions, they showed a decreasing trend similar to that of 1,3-butadiene in MF combustion [374]. Particularly, the increased oxidation promoted by the elevated in-cylinder temperature occurring during high engine loads. This was supported by the increased MF fraction in the fuel blends. Takada et al. [255] observed a linear relationship between the exhaust temperature and benzene emissions in which an increase in the former negatively affects the latter's emissions. Hence, it could be expected that the higher availability of oxygenated compounds found in MF combined with the relatively shorter combustion duration effectively increased the combustion temperature and limit the production of benzene. As indicated in Correa et al. [395], the formation of benzene relied primarily on the synthesis and structure modification of the unburnt hydrocarbons. These processes were observed to be minimized by the presence of high oxygen content and enhanced oxidation of MF fuels. Notably, benzene has long been referred to as an important intermediate for the production of PAHs. Thus, lower emissions of PAHs could also be expected from the lower production of benzene in the application of MF and its fuel blends. Besides, as for biodiesel, mixing MF into biodiesel blends has also resulted in the fall in the emissions of benzene, especially at high loads (Fig. 23c) [310]. In general, effects of MF on performance, combustion and emission characteristics of both SI and CI engines could be given in Table 4 ."
13,Tribology behavior,"4.5 Tribology behavior Considering the inherent disadvantages of existing fuel-carrying components in engine systems, researchers have focused much of their recent attention on thoroughly investigating lubricity as an important fuel characteristic [353,354]. Most aromatic and oxygenated compounds, which contribute significantly towards fuel lubricity, are often removed during the high-energy, intense refining process. Thus, the reduced lubricity leads to higher wear of engine components and heightens the risk of failing fuel pumps [397]. As indicated, fuel lubricity could be significantly enhanced by the presence of oxygenated and/or nitrogen-containing polar compounds [398,399]. Similar observations were made in the case of gasoline. Besides fuel viscosity, the availability of sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygenated content in gasoline has a considerate impact on its lubricity [400]. In their study, Dearn et al. [401] assessed the lubricity of different fuels based on the examination of observed wear scars and friction coefficient in engines during operation. As shown in Fig. 24 a&b, MF outperforms gasoline in terms of lubricity based on the average values of friction coefficient and wear scars of the two tested fuels [401]. The changes in the friction coefficient and wear scars could be detected as the percentage by volume of MF increased relative to gasoline in the fuel blend. The improvement in the overall fuel lubricity due to the increased proportion of MF could minimize potential friction losses and promote overall engine efficiency [402]. The benefits of MF in terms of reduced engine friction could increase the likelihood of MF and its blends with gasoline application in DISI engines operating under elevated pressure conditions. Using the measured length of wear scar as shown in Fig. 24b, the authors were able to show the varying effect of different percentage volumes of MF on the engine components [401]. Overall, higher amounts of MF resulted in a smaller wear scar as provided by the diameter of its length. Notably, there was a diminishing return toward further wear scar reduction when the amount of MF exceeded beyond 10% vol. Comparatively, there was a greater significance in terms of wear resistance enhancement relative to the friction reduction provided by the introduction of MF into the gasoline blend. Furthermore, no apparent correlation trend could be detected between the friction coefficient and wear reduction. Most importantly, there was a strong indication of the role of polar compounds in MF and MF-gasoline blend that have contributed positively toward reducing friction and enhancing wear resistance in engines. These polar molecules were observed to easily attach to the internal surface of engines to create a thin layer of tribofilm coating the material surfaces and preventing it from potential friction and wear. Upon reaching the point of saturation, further increase in the amount of MF could be expected to yield little additional benefit to the aforementioned coated layer [403]. Using FESEM, the results obtained from further examination of the wear scar on the disc samples were provided in Fig. 24c. Compared between the sample tested with pure gasoline and MF, the former exhibited significantly larger grooves in the observed wear scar that suggested severe abrasion. Hence, it could be concluded that there was a much greater improvement in the lubricity of MF applications. Furthermore, furans and other organic compounds have shown the ability to bind to metal surfaces creating tribofilm enabling surface lubrication even though such protective layers would be degraded and eventually destroyed through excessive rubbing [404]. The obtained results could be attributed to the arrangement of the aromatic ring of furan onto the metal surfaces [405,406]. However, the protection provided by the MF-created tribofilm was limited by the weak bonding force to the metal surfaces of engines. Hence, detection of engine wear and abrasion could still be seen in Fig. 24c."
14,Economic aspect,"In their techno-economic analysis of MF production from furfural, Denis [407] applied the Aspen PlusTM 9.0 in the determination of the process model property based on the material/energy balances. In sizing the process equipment, several parameters were included such as the material/energy balances and operating conditions. Several tools and methods were applied in modeling cost components. Particularly, the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer was used in the appraisal of pump procurement cost, while publicly available data obtained from the results of Swanson et al. [408] could be scaled up in estimating the total purchase cost of custom-engineered equipment. The following variables, including the total purchased equipment cost, the fixed capital investment, and the total project investment, were calculated from first to last in that order as proposed by Peters et al. [409]. The model also included the contingency cost taking into account the unexpected variables. A 30-year discounted cash flow rate of return was applied in the calculation of the returns on investment and the subsequent quantification of the minimum product-selling price. According to the results, approximately $82 MM was estimated for the annualized operating expenses for the conversion of MF from furfural. This figure was stated to account for 48% of the total cost in maintaining the operation of the biorefinery. In the case of MF, it was found that the minimum product-selling price for MF was between the range of $7.56/gal and $11.34/gal, the yield was approximately 20%. The difference in the possible price range of $3.78/gal was the primary factor in determining the viability of the fuel choice."
15,Existing challenges and future perspective,"From the analysis of the selling price for MF, it could be seen that the current minimum product-selling price for MF is much higher than that of gasoline and diesel fuel. Therefore, it is necessary to develop high-yield catalyst systems and optimize the production process aiming to reduce the selling price, and target the commercialization strategy of MF. According to this aspect, there are several challenges relating to MF production process. Firstly, the biomass pretreatment process should be carefully and thoroughly selected aiming to form the compounds that benefit the MF and furfural production. As indicated in several publications, the biomass pretreatment took a significant cost for the biofuel production [410,411]. Besides, it could cause environmental concerns due to the use of chemical solutions in the pretreatment process. Thus, the optimization of biomass pretreatment for the furfural and MF production is considered as a noticeable challenge. Secondly, the selection of feedstock for furfural production that is an intermediate of MF synthesis. The fact shows that it is difficult to produce furfural with a high yield from biomass. As some reports, the highest MF yield of around 70% could be obtained from industrial-scale when using acid catalyst under high temperatures [412,413]. Such low furfural yield could be due to spontaneous conversion of the produced pentoses to furfural, resulting in the significant formation of unexpected by-products. Due to this reason, hemicellulose components should be separated from the biomass in the initial step and they would be then diluted to facilitate the MF production [53]. Nonetheless, using biomass-derived pure hemicelluloses as input materials for the MF synthesis process was found to be an unviable selection based on economic criteria because of significant difficulties in separating and purifying hemicellulose components from biomass. Moreover, the hemicellulose components in lignocellulosic biomass and the efficiency of the separation process of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass are very different. Normally, there have been two strategies relating to the direct synthesis of furfural from lignocellulosic biomass, they are the one-pot and two-pot methods. For the one-pot method, the furfural selectivity would be still low though high furfural yields could achieve because the mixture of obtained products was found to include those from the catalyst-based conversion of both lignin and cellulose. For the two-pot method, it was found to be relatively efficient to get furfural with high selectivity. However, to achieve such high yield and selectivity in furfural production, suitable catalysts and solvents for the conversion process were known as the most common requirement. Indeed, the third challenge is thought to relate to catalysts, solvents, and reaction conditions. As reported in all literature, the selectivity of the dissolution process for hemicelluloses along with the yield of furfural and MF synthesis could be controlled through the adjustment of components/loadings of the catalysts and solvents as well as the reaction conditions since the two-step reactions of converting biomass have been highly recommended. For the dissolution of hemicellulose, the inhibition of the cellulose and lignin dissolution could be considered as the primary challenges aiming to enhance the selective dissolution of hemicellulose. Alternatively, it is very necessary to hinder the formation of by-products causing negative impacts on the furfural or MF production, resulting in the improvement of the valorization of hemicellulose derivatives to the formation of furfural and MF. Thus, the selective dissolution process of hemicellulose should be strategically designed to obtain products (such as xylose or xylan) benefiting the follow-up synthesis reactions through the support of catalyst systems and solvent. Due to this reason, finding the high-efficiency catalytic and solvent systems would also be a challenge in the next studies. Furthermore, the optimization of reaction conditions aiming to reduce the temperature and pressure reaction is extremely important because it would increase the longevity of equipment and reduce the investment cost. The fourth challenge is thought to relate to catalyst reuse, solvent recycling, and the purification of products. Currently, azeotropic distillation and traditional extractive distillation have been used to purify MF and furfural but the above-mentioned industrial separation/purification methods were found to possess several drawbacks such as high investment capital, high energy consumption, high complexity of the process, and environmental pollution [414,415]. Although there have been other novel technologies in furfural and MF purification such as supercritical CO2 extraction technology or the use of nonporous adaptive crystals, they have been only developed at the laboratory-stage level. Also, the separation and regeneration of catalysts from the reaction mixtures aiming to reuse for the next runs are still believed as a significant challenge for industrial applications because the activity and deactivation of as-used catalysts could be reduced after regeneration. As reported, separating solid catalysts in the post-reaction mixtures in the catalyst-based valorization of biomass is very difficult, incurring the additional costs and energy for catalyst recovery and drying process [416,417]. Solvent recycling is considered as one of challenges for chemical industries because of its potential relating to the costs of waste management and chemical consumption aiming to achieve the reduction target of environmental pollution [418]. Therefore, finding the useful and efficient solutions for solving the above-mentioned challenges is extremely important and needed before commercializing MF as a green biofuel. Facing the above-mentioned challenges, the development of high-efficiency and low-cost catalyst systems aiming to increase the MF yield and reduce the selling price should be further investigated in the future. Besides, the optimization of reaction conditions including temperature and pressure, hydro donor, and solvent should be carried out to produce the targeted product at the highest yield. Moreover, the comprehensive evaluation of environmental concerns for the MF production is obligated because the biomass harvesting and biomass transport to bio-refinery, biomass pretreatment for biofuel production, and the MF purification process could release toxic compounds into the environment. Therefore, to maximize the benefits and minimize the impacts on the environment, the application of production and circular bio-economics should be considered for the MF synthesis process. More than that, the models for economic assessment for MF production should also be more completed. For the combustion and ignition studies, it is necessary to expand the parameter range (such as the range of temperature, pressure, and equivalent ratio) of experimental data used for developing the model aiming to improve the quantitative accuracy in the prediction process of chemical kinetic models, as well as to eliminate the uncertainties of experimental and numerical data. More importantly, the application of MF in internal combustion engines should be evaluated more completely. Indeed, the data associated with engine performance and emissions should be tested under various loads and speeds of the engine. Alternatively, the corrosion characteristics and lubricating oil degradation of the engine fueled with MF-based fuels should be thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, the experimental studies on the engine durability and deposit formation in the combustion chamber should be carried out in detail."
16,Conclusions,"Nowadays, the rapid development of new technologies and high-efficiency catalyst systems have allowed us to produce value-added chemicals from copious biomass sources. Indeed, among the value-added chemicals, 2-methylfurfural (MF) was found to have significant advantages as being synthesized from biomass through catalyst pathway. Moreover importantly, MF could be used as an alternative green fuel for both spark ignition and compression ignition engines aiming to alleviate the dependence on fossil fuels. In general, some key conclusions could be drawn as follows: ➢ The yield of MF by using bimetallic catalyst systems is higher than that of single metallic catalyst systems; this result is attributed to the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts. Several factors such as the particle size and shape of the metal-based catalysts, the solvent, hydro donor, and the reaction temperature and pressure are found to be highly relevant in determining either the hydrogenation or decarbonylation route in the conversion process of biomass to MF. Among catalyst systems used for MF synthesis, Cu-based catalysts were utilized more popularly to produce MF with a relatively high yield. In some cases, the MF yield could be higher than 90% by using Cu-based catalysts such as Cu–Mn/Si, Cu–Ni/Al2O3. Moreover, Cu-based catalysts were also more economical than noble metal-based catalysts. ➢ Fundamental ignition behavior and combustion characteristics including ignition delay times, laminar flame velocity, and pyrolysis reactions for MF under various conditions were extensively studied. As a result, MF has a higher laminar burning velocity and longer ignition delay times in comparison with fossil fuels, indicating that MF exhibited higher reactivity than fossil fuels. Moreover, the H-abstraction reaction and the addition reactions of the OH radicals were identified as the dominant reaction pathway for the consumption of MF. More importantly, a large number of soot precursors produced from the pyrolysis process of MF could be considered as the most important finding, showing a shooting propensity in the flame structure of MF. ➢ Relating to the engine application, MF was found to be suitable for both SI and CI engines when it was used under the blend mode of MF and fossil fuels with the MF rate <20%. The use of MF for internal combustion engines has been demonstrated to improve engine performance, combustion behaviors, and emission characteristics. These obtained results were attributed to the higher oxygen component in MF molecular, longer ignition delay, faster evaporation, and more homogeneous mixture formation compared to those of gasoline and diesel fuel. In the SI engine case, the MF-gasoline blends have increased burning velocity and shortened the combustion duration, minimizing auto-ignition and knocking in the SI engines. More importantly, the utilization of MF was seen to lower the wear and friction coefficient of the engine system. Even as compared to ethanol-gasoline blends at the same percentage, MF-gasoline blends have exhibited better engine performance and emissions. For the CI engine application, blending MF with biodiesel or diesel fuel could improve significantly engine performance and emissions. Based on the analyzed and reviewed results from the catalyst-based synthesis pathway to the engine application of alternative MF fuel, MF could become the potential 2nd generation biofuel for both SI and CI engines after solving the primary challenges mentioned above. In summary, the synthesis of MF from biomass and the application of MF in internal combustion engines have offered great significance in achieving the key strategies towards clean and renewable energy use in the future. According to this aspect, the utilization of renewable sources originated from biomass for MF biofuel production and the use of MF for internal combustion engines aiming to satisfy the strict requirement of emissions and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels could be considered as a green, clean, and sustainable strategy in the future."
