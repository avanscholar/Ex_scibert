0,Introduction,"Energy is the main financial activity globally and 80–90% of energy consumption is derived from fossil fuels (mainly coal, oil and natural gas). Despite the economic crisis of the last two years world energy demands are still increasing due to the population growth, as well as the economic growth of East Asia. Although fossil fuels have powered the industrialization of most modern nations, the issues associated with their widespread use are now numerous. Political considerations over supply security, environmental concerns related to global warming and sustainability are expected to move the world's energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The European Commission, for example, has proposed that the energy policy of the European Union should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% in 2007 to 20% by 2020. By investing in the long term energy solutions that alternative energy sources afford, most nations would benefit significantly in the long run. In this framework, the H2 economy is a proposed system of delivering energy using hydrogen as the energy carrier [1–4]. H2 lobbyists promote hydrogen as potential fuel in the automotive sector (including cars and boats), in buildings and portable electronics. However, could H2 be the fuel of the future? Proponents of a world-scale H2 economy put forward a number of advantages such as [1–4]: • Hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel that produces minimal emissions when combusted directly or in combination with hydrocarbon fuels. • It is the ideal fuel for fuel cells, where the only byproducts are heat and water. • Hydrogen is safer than gasoline, diesel, or natural gas. • It can be produced from renewable local sources (e.g. biomass, sun, water), and as a consequence, may be considered as a sustainable energy carrier, which would contribute to net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. • Well-established fossil fuel-based networks could be H2 producers in a transition period. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells which typically operate at 80–100°C and consume H2 and O2 to produce electricity without polluting the environment, appear to be a viable energy technology for both mobile and stationary applications [5–8]. There are several attractive market targets for deployment of H2 and PEM fuel cell technologies in each country including transportation, mobile electrical devices, power supplies, plug-in hybrid power systems, combined heat and power (CHP) facilities and military applications. H2 could contribute to a reduction of transport-related emissions of both CO2 and air pollutants, the latter making it especially attractive for improving urban air quality. In addition, H2 can also be used for decentralised heat and electricity generation in stationary fuel cell systems. Among the various types of fuel cells, PEMFCs seem to be the most technically advanced energy conversion system for such purpose [5–8]. In addition with their compact cell design and zero (or near zero) emissions, they possess the necessary specific power, power density and durability to replace conventional internal combustion engines and battery systems. Though H2 is being considered as the optimum fuel for PEMFCs, a number of reasons render its use difficult, especially in mobile or portable applications. The chemical and physical properties of H2, being energy dense in mass but energy poor in volume, make the distribution and storage of pure hydrogen energy demanding. Additionally, the development of a H2 distribution infrastructure will require large investments for many years. The magnitude of the capital investment required for the build-up of this infrastructure will be related to the degree of penetration of H2 in the worldwide energy system. On the other hand, the lack of a worldwide distribution network with respect to the well-established fossil fuel network favors the transition to the real hydrogen economy via a near term solution of on-site (stationary) or on-board (mobile) H2 production from reforming of various liquid fuels such as gasoline, natural gas, alcohols, etc. The production of H2-rich gas streams for PEMFCs can be done in a fuel processor unit (Fig. 1 ), either by steam reforming or by autothermal reforming (i.e. by a balanced combination of the endothermic steam reforming reaction with the exothermic oxidation) of an alcohol or a hydrocarbon liquid fuel [5–12]. In either case, the resulting gas mixture contains significant amounts of CO and it is further processed with additional steam in a water gas shift reactor. In this way, the gas stream becomes richer in hydrogen and the concentration of CO drops to ∼1vol.%. Regardless of the fuel, the obtained gas mixture contains typically: 45–75vol.% H2, 15–25vol.% CO2, 0.5–2vol.% CO, a few vol.% H2O and N2. An additional step of CO removal (e.g. preferential oxidation) is required in order to protect the anode electrocatalyst thus complicating further the balance of plant of the fuel processor. Although the on-board fuel processor program has been put on hold by the U.S. Department of Energy [12,13], a number of new approaches for the establishment of hydrogen refueling stations based on some form of fuel processor are being pursued [12]. The complexity of the balance of plant of a fuel cell-fuel processor unit challenges the design and development of compact and user friendly fuel cell. Depending on the starting fuel different configurations may be applied, as shown in Fig. 2 . The ideal system would be that of a pure H2-fuelled PEMFC. However, such a system is accompanied with several drawbacks, as discussed above. On the other hand, a voluminous fuel processor with heat exchangers and complex BoP components is required in the case of an alternative liquid fuel as hydrogen carrier. However, the step of enrichment of the hydrogen stream (i.e. WGS reactor in Fig. 1) can be avoided in the case of using methanol as a starting fuel. The direct and efficient processing of methanol has been considered as a potential alternative due to the favorable properties of methanol, such as high energy density, low sulfur content and the possibility to derive it from renewable sources [6,10,11,14]. Recent advances in the design and development of materials, such as polymer electrolyte membranes (e.g. polybenzimidazole (PBI) impregnated with H3PO4) and electrocatalysts, allow the operation of PEMFCs at temperatures in the range 150–200°C [6,15–18]. There are several technological and commercial reasons for operating a PEMFC at high temperatures: • Rates of electrochemical reactions are enhanced • Water management and cooling is simplified • Useful waste heat can be recovered • Lower quality reformed hydrogen containing up to 2% CO may be used as the fuel. An attractive configuration which would take advantage of the HT-PEMFC features would be the incorporation of fuel reformer inside the fuel cell (Fig. 2). This requires the development of highly active and selective reforming catalysts, which will be able to operate at temperatures as low as possible with minimal CO formation."
1,Internal reforming alcohol HT-PEM fuel cell (IRAFC),"A fuel cell incorporating a reformer is depicted in Fig. 3 . The main concept is the incorporation of an alcohol reforming catalyst into the anodic compartment of the fuel cell, so that methanol or ethanol reforming takes place inside the fuel cell stack (internal reforming) [6,19]. There are several advantages of integrating the reformer into the fuel cell: • Simplification of design. The reformer is placed into the anode chamber, eliminating the need for a separate fuel processor. • Increased overall efficiency. In contrast to a conventional PEM fuel cell fed by reformed fuel, the internal reforming fuel cell does not require burning of fuel to drive the reforming reaction because it uses the excess heat created by the fuel cell instead. In addition, a heat exchanger is not needed because the reforming catalyst is in direct contact with the heat source. • Minimization of system weight and volume. Elimination of the WGS and PROX reactors results in a significant decrease in the weight and volume of the whole system. In situ extraction of H2 from the reforming catalyst via oxidation by the anode electrocatalyst, enhances the reforming reaction and results in smaller mass of catalyst (a common kinetic aspect of methanol reforming catalysts is H2 inhibition). • Inherent dynamic stability. In contrast to traditional PEM fuel cells, as the electrical load is increased, the heat created by the fuel cell increases as well, and because the reformer is in direct contact with the anode, the excess heat helps to drive the reforming reaction, creating more H2 for the fuel cell instead of less. The proposed fuel cell comprises a high-temperature, membrane electrode assembly (HT-MEA), being able to operate at temperatures of 190–220°C. This is based on the H3PO4-imbibed HT-MEAs developed by ADVENT technologies [6,19,20], which have proven operation on a long term basis at 200°C with minimal H3PO4 loss. On the cathode side, the high-temperature ion-conducting electrolyte membrane directly adjoins an electronically conductive support (carbon powder or carbon black), to the surface of which the electrocatalyst (Pt/C or Pt–Co/C) is dispersed. On the anode side, the membrane directly adjoins an electronically conductive support (carbon powder or carbon black), to the surface of which the electrocatalyst (Pt/C or Pt–Ru/C) is dispersed. The anode is directly adjoined with a methanol reforming catalyst (for example, copper-manganese spinel oxides supported on copper foam), which will provide the required concentration of H2, without the need of CO clean up, due to the high temperature operation. The steam reforming catalyst can be either (i) present together with the Pt-based electrocatalyst in the anode, (ii) deposited on the gas diffusion layer or (iii) deposited on the surface of monolithic structures (such as microchannels or metallic foams) and could be coated on the anode side by a carbon paste, which efficiently conducts the current out of the MEA to the current collector. If the reforming catalyst has a monolithic structure it can also operate as a current collector. Finally, current collectors on both sides are directly adjoined with bipolar plates (stainless steel, graphite or graphite composites) that surround the unit cell. The internal reforming alcohol fuel cell can be supplied with a methanol fuel (mixed with water in appropriate ratios), which is catalytically steam reformed to a H2-rich gas mixture (it also contains carbon dioxide and water), which together with air supplied on the cathode side drive the electrocatalytic operation of HT-MEA. The outlet stream of the fuel cell contains water and carbon dioxide. The overall design allows for efficient heat management, since the “waste” heat produced by the fuel cell is in situ utilized to drive the endothermic reforming reaction. The most important aspect of integration of IRAFC components into a functional unit refers to incorporation of the reforming catalyst in the anode compartment of the cell. This depends mainly on: (i) the activity of the reforming catalyst, i.e. what is the required catalyst loading and (ii) the stability of the reforming catalyst under phosphoric acid exposure, i.e. how far from the membrane is the catalyst positioned. In order to cope with these issues, three alternative configurations may be applied with characteristics as shown in Table 1 . A successful development of IRAFC technology, which might lead in commercialization and might boost the entire market of fuel cells, should be characterized by (a) a power of 0.15Wcm−2 at a potential of 0.7V and operating temperature of 220°C and (b) specific (Wkg−1) and volumetric (Wm−3) power density similar to current, state-of-the-art high-temperature PEM fuel cells operating on hydrogen. The viability of an IRAFC unit is related to the membrane and catalyst stability under the targeted operating conditions. Operation of PEM membranes at elevated temperatures, such as 220°C, requires improvement of their thermal stability and retention of H3PO4, which could be achieved by crosslinking. The effect of H3PO4 vapors on the reforming catalyst is another potential problem. Although the importance of the problem is reduced because ADVENT's MEAs operate with low total amount of acid, and the fact that acid mobility inside the MEA is less compared to other systems (e.g. PBI), leaching from the MEA to the catalyst bed is of primary concern."
2,Literature review,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of polymer electrolyte membranes for DMFCs in terms of cost reduction and improvement of functionality, together with other associated technology advancements. Although varying for different applications, common requirements for a polymer electrolyte membrane in DMFC applications include the capability for operation at high temperature, low methanol crossover (MCO) (<10−6 molmin−1 cm−1) or low methanol diffusion coefficient (<5.6×10−6 cm2 s−1 at T =25°C), high ionic conductivity (>80mScm−1), high chemical and mechanical durability especially at T >80°C (for increased CO tolerance) and low cost (<$10kW−1 based on a PEMFC) [21–23]. The most commonly used membranes for DMFCs, i.e. the DuPont's Nafion membranes, do not satisfy all of the above requirements. In addition, there are still inherent problems in this approach stemming from the poor electrocatalytic activity of Pt (formation of CO intermediate poisons Pt) and the high permeability of methanol [22,24] through the Nafion electrolyte (low open circuit voltage). An additional disadvantage is the high ruthenium crossover (in the case that the anode catalyst contains Ru) from the anode and its re-deposition on the cathode [25,26]. All these drawbacks result into a significant decrease in cell efficiency rendering these cells applicable only in low power portable applications, where efficiency is not the main issue. A typical direct methanol fuel cell has a power density of 50mWcm−2. Lower power densities are exhibited by direct ethanol fuel cells. Higher power densities can be obtained only under extremely severe conditions. Currently, based on a 50kW polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) for automotive applications, Nafion polymer membranes account for 20% of the total cost of Nafion based membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) [24]. A Nafion membrane based MEA for DMFC is expected to cost much more due to the thicker membranes needed for reduced methanol crossover. Nafion membranes for DMFC applications typically have a price in the range of $600–1200m−2 [27], depending on the thickness, and a cost per unit power of 300€kW−1 at 240mWcm−2 [28]. Recent development of high temperature polymer electrolyte membranes (e.g. new high temperature polymer electrolytes impregnated with H3PO4) [6,15–18] and electrocatalysts, allow the operation of PEMFCs at ∼180°C, whereas the standard carbon-supported high surface area platinum electrodes become tolerant to relatively high concentrations of CO. The obvious advantage of this type of HT-PEM fuel cell is that it is no longer necessary for the fuel-processing system to remove the bulk of CO from the reformed gas, effectively eliminating the need for WGS and PROX reactors [6,18,29]. In addition, water management can be simplified because only a single phase of water need to be considered, while the cooling system is simplified due to the increased temperature gradient between the fuel cell stack and the coolant. The excess heat produced by the operation of the fuel cell can now be used to drive the endothermic reforming reaction, whereas the heat produced by operation of a low temperature PEM fuel cell (including DMFC) cannot be utilized [6,29]. CO tolerance allows the fuel processor to be designed as a single reforming stage and the higher temperature of operation allows the single stage fuel processor to be integrated into the fuel cell itself (Fig. 2). Several attempts have been done in the past for the construction of compact integrated PEMFC reformers either by the introduction of reforming catalyst in the flow channels of the bipolar plate [29] or with the placement of small reformers in thermal contact with the stack [30]. Samms and Savinell [29] studied the kinetics of methanol-steam reforming reaction within an idealized tube reactor and within a non-ideal internal reforming fuel cell (IRFC). E-Tek electrodes (standard single sided ELAT type; 20% Pt on XC-72, 0.35mgPtcm−2 on a hydrophobic gas-backing) on PBI membrane (the thickness of the membranes was 75μm and the phosphoric acid content was 6 H3PO4 molecules per repeat unit of the polymer) were employed in IRFC. The reforming catalyst was the low-temperature shift catalyst BASF K3-110: 40% CuO/40% ZnO/20% Al2O3, which was packed into the S-shaped reactor bed in the anode current collector. Experimental runs were conducted at 225°C. It was found that methanol conversion in the IRFC without a MEA (and without H2 extraction) was significantly less than for an ideal PFR, probably due to the non-ideal flow through or around the catalytic bed. By introducing the MEA, it was found that methanol conversion was further reduced, probably due to catalyst deactivation by H3PO4, since the whole mass of catalyst was in direct contact with the MEA. The authors have suggested that reducing the thickness of anode gas-backing and better containing the H3PO4 in the MEA may improve the flow distribution. Taking into account the cell temperature, i.e. 225°C, and the aforementioned issues the long-term behavior of the IRFC has to be investigated. Non-uniform flow distribution and reforming catalyst deactivation by phosphoric acid-leaching were not an issue in the case of the integrated HT-PEM fuel cell – methanol reformer reported by Pan et al. [30]. They constructed a two-cell stack with an integrated methanol reformer. Platinum supported on carbon black (38.6% Pt, 0.5–0.65mg Pt per cm2), impregnated with 10wt.% H3PO4 was used as anode/cathode electrocatalyst, while H3PO4-doped PBI was used as electrolyte. At 200°C, close to 100% methanol conversion was achieved only at the feeding rate of 50mlh−1, and with 149g of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst loading. High contact times are required in order to achieve complete methanol conversion at low temperatures since the reformer is not placed into the anode compartment and does not takes advantage of in situ extraction of H2 by the anode electrocatalyst. However, an integrated system is expected to improve the system efficiency and simplify the system construction and operation, as compared with traditional fuel cell – reformer systems. Separate reforming reactors operating at higher temperatures than the fuel cell itself have been applied in order to achieve high reaction rates [31]. A miniature in situ H2 generator (methanol fuel processor operating at 230°C) integrated/attached to a high temperature (∼150–200°C) fuel cell is also being developed at Motorola Labs. Recently, a direct alcohol fuel cell using solid acid electrolyte and internal reforming catalyst has been reported [32]. This fuel cell comprises an anode, a cathode, a solid acid electrolyte and an internal reformer positioned adjacent the anode. Such an integrated configuration resulted in an increased power density and cell voltage relative to direct alcohol fuel cells not using an internal reformer. The electrolytes used in these fuel cells are of the solid acid type (e.g. CsH2PO4), which enable operation at high temperatures (200–350°C) where the Cu–Zn–O reforming catalysts are active. A similar configuration is also described in a theoretical patent [33]. Currently, internal reforming is only available to high temperature fuel cells such as MCFC and SOFC [34]. This is because the activity of steam reforming catalysts is too low at the operating temperature of PEMFC and PAFC. Regarding high-temperature polymer membranes, the ADVENT TPS® high-temperature polymer electrolyte has been recently reported [6,17,19,20]. It is based on aromatic polyethers bearing pyridine units in the main chain, where the H3PO4 is preferentially bonded. The corresponding MEA has demonstrated operation for more than 1000h at 200°C. Beyond its good mechanical and chemical properties, the aforementioned membrane type is the only one known to operate with H3PO4 doping level even below 200wt.%, while the PBI membrane should be imbibed with more than 250wt.% phosphoric acid. This will presumably be in favor of the life time of the reforming catalyst, with respect to the effect of H3PO4 poisoning on catalytic activity. Commercially available copper-based catalysts, typically with composition Cu–ZnO–(Al2O3) have been widely used for generating H2 from methanol [6,11,35]. Even though these catalysts are widely used in H2 plants, several drawbacks limit their application in small stationary or mobile fuel processors: (a) slow start-up response due to the slow kinetics and (b) irreversible deactivation if exposed to liquid water during shutdown. In addition, the pyrophoric behavior of conventional methanol reforming catalysts has to be controlled when reduced Cu is abruptly exposed to air after turning off the feed of reactants, since major local temperature spikes can occur due to fast copper oxidation, which may lead to sintering and deactivation of Cu particles. We have reported on the application of alternative copper-based catalysts (Cu–Ce and Cu–Mn oxides) prepared by a combustion method in methanol reforming [11,36–38]. In view of the IRAFC system, important improvements of reforming catalysts are required regarding: (i) their activity at temperatures around 200°C and (ii) the ability to operate without preactivation steps."
3,Proof of IRAFC concept,"Thermodynamic calculations show that the equilibrium conversion of methanol at the operating temperature of the IRAFC unit is essentially unity [39]. Products distribution of the reforming reaction is influenced kinetically by the type of employed catalyst. Use of copper-based catalysts in methanol reforming at temperatures around 200°C leads almost exclusively to the desired production of CO2 and H2 due to the mechanism of the reaction over copper surfaces, which hinders kinetically the formation of CH4 and CO. In addition, the integration of the reforming catalyst in the anode is expected to promote its catalytic activity because: (i) it will alleviate the inhibiting effect of H2 (a common kinetic aspect of methanol reforming catalysts is H2 inhibition) via its electrochemical pumping through the fuel cell membrane itself, thus inducing a promotional kinetic effect on the catalytic activity and (ii) it may induce an electrochemical promotion effect (EPOC) [40]. An internal reforming methanol single fuel cell was constructed according to the proposed configuration described in Fig. 3. The employed single cell has the following features: (i) triple serpentine flow fields arrangement, (ii) Poco® graphite bipolar plates, (iii) copper current collectors, (iv) electrode area of 8 or 22cm2 with a platinum loading of 1.5mgPtcm−2, 2g H3PO4/g Pt (v) copolymer TPS® electrolyte membrane, thickness 180μm, 190wt.% H3PO4 doping level. A standard single cell was purchased from Fuel Cell Technologies Inc in order to be modified in such a way to fit the foam reforming catalyst. The membrane was sandwiched between the anodic (Cu–Mn spinel oxide supported on metallic copper foam and placed adjacent to the Pt/C anode electrocatalyst) and Pt/C cathodic gas diffusion electrodes. Vaporized methanol and water mixtures were supplied to the anode compartment, where the reforming catalyst is directly adjoined with the anode electrode. The cell temperature was set at 200°C. Electrocatalytic studies with the proposed configuration [6,19] confirmed the promoting effect of H+ pumping through the fuel cell membrane on methanol conversion. Methanol is being reformed inside the anode compartment of the fuel cell at 200°C producing H2, which is readily oxidized at the anode to produce electricity. The IRAFC (foam of 10mm thickness) operated efficiently for more than 72h at 200°C with a current density of 263mAcm−2 at 500mV, when 20% CH3OH/30% H2O/He (anode feed) and pure O2 (cathode feed) were supplied. Its open circuit voltage was 990mV. It was interestingly observed that due to H2 utilization/depletion at the anode the reforming reaction rate was enhanced even up to 20%. The obtained polarization curves and hydrogen production rates at 200°C under fuel cell operation and under OCV conditions are illustrated in Fig. 4 . It is obvious that significant improvement is achieved by decreasing the reformer thickness from 10mm (EXP1) to 3mm (EXP2). Similar current densities were obtained in both configurations. At 200°C, H2 utilization/depletion at the anode was facilitated in the case of EXP2 where a foam reformer with 3mm thickness is employed and resulted in a much higher enhancement of methanol reforming reaction rate as compared with EXP1. In any case, there is enough hydrogen supply for efficient fuel cell operation at 600mV with 0.2Acm−2 for λ H 2 (H2 fed to anode electrode/H2 reacted)=1.2. It should be noted though that the methanol conversion obtained with the thinner foam catalyst was lower (75% under fuel cell operation). The activity of current methanol reforming catalysts at the temperature of 200°C is clearly a constraint for further development of the IRAFC concept."
4,Conclusions,"A single-cell of a high-temperature, polymer electrolyte fuel cell incorporating ADVENT TPS® phosphoric acid doped copolymer and a methanol reforming catalyst in the anode has been constructed and tested at 200°C demonstrating the functionality of the unit. Specific targets for improvement of the efficiency have been also identified. These are the activity of the reforming catalyst and the thermal stability of the membrane for operation above 200°C."
