0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is regarded as the most promising energy carrier and is expected to play a significant role in future energy systems because of its abundant reserves and absence of emissions when burned [1–6]. It can be produced by different methods and from different types of materials, including coal, hydrocarbons, biomass, or water [7]. At present, methane steam reforming and coal gasification are the commonly used massive hydrogen production methods in the industry [8,9]. However, these processes require harsh reaction conditions, emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, and are unsuitable for small-scale in-situ hydrogen production. Therefore, identifying a more efficient and compact method to produce hydrogen, owing to its practical applications, should be considered [10]. Water electrolysis at low temperatures can not only produce high-purity hydrogen in a rapid single-step process but is also suitable for on-site hydrogen production, which is the most promising method for hydrogen generation [11,12]. However, the major drawback of water electrolysis is the high energy requirement [13–15]. Theoretically, the energy consumption to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis is 3.54 kWh/N m3; however, actually, a commercial water electrolyzer consumes energy of 4.5–5 kWh/N m3 [8,10]. Several strategies have been proposed to decrease the energy consumption of water electrolysis. The first one is reducing the ohmic losses, which can be achieved using electrolyte membranes. An electrolysis system can be operated under a high current density with a high hydrogen production efficiency when the ohmic losses are low. However, the scaling and wide application of water electrolysis using electrolyte membranes are severely impeded by the high price and poor stability of electrolyte membranes [16]. Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is another method that is attracting tremendous interest. The standard potential for the electrolysis of water is 1.23 V, suggesting that the decomposition of water is a highly unfavorable reaction. Moreover, although numerous studies have reported various excellent electrocatalysts for the HER and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the operation of a water electrolysis cell still needs application of 1.6–2.0 V, which is because the OER in water electrolysis is kinetically slow and must be driven by an enhanced overpotential [17–20]. The third strategy, which has received particular attention in recent years, is replacing the OER with the oxidation of other species that are more oxidized than water. Compared to the above two strategies, the third one, i.e., chemical-assisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (CAHER), can cause a significant reduction in the potential needed to produce hydrogen, and is considered as a promising energy-saving method for hydrogen production [16]. Until now, researchers have shown that this strategy can be achieved using various sacrificial compounds, such as coal [21–33], biomass [3,17,34–38], methanol [39–41], ethanol [42,43], glycerol [10], formic acid [44,45], and urea [9,46–49]. Specifically, these substrates are oxidized at the anode, with the HER occurring at the cathode. Compared to the other chemicals, coal is the most understandable and low-cost option to assist water electrolysis [50]. Furthermore, coal-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE) for hydrogen production is not only an alternative method for using coal effectively and efficiently but also attractive for hydrogen economy [28,51–53]. CAWE was first proposed by Coughlin and Farooque in 1979 with the following reactions [21]: (1) C + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H+ + 4e− and (2) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2. Reactions (1) and (2) occur at the anode and the cathode, respectively. The thermodynamic electrochemical potential of CAWE is 0.21 V under standard conditions, which is much lower than that of water electrolysis (1.23 V). The actual energy consumption for coal electrolysis is one-third to one-half that for the electrolysis of water [52,54,55]. However, Coughlin and Farooque found that the cell potential required for CAWE ranges from 0.7 V to 0.9 V. In addition, the authors suggested that the iron ions leached from coal participate in the oxidation reaction [56–58]. Indeed, subsequent studies [22,59–61] showed that the current of CAWE is mainly attributed to the Fe2+ ions leached into the solution from coal. A more detailed mechanism of CAWE was described by Dhooge and Park [62–64]. The reaction mechanism proposed by the authors is as follows: (3) in the solution: C + 4Fe3+ + 2H2O → CO2 + 4Fe2+ + 4H+, (4) at the anode: Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e−, and (5) at the cathode: 2H+ + 2e− → H2. According to reactions (3) and (5), the current density of CAWE is mainly provided by the oxidation of Fe2+ and Fe3+, and the characteristics of coal are the key for CAWE, which can significantly affect the concentration of Fe2+ ions in the electrolyte. Kusunoki et al. [65] studied the electrolysis of coal slurry in a flow-through cell. The results showed that the current density presented an order of magnitude increase in the presence of Fe3+ for CAWE. Thomas et al. [66,67] used four different types of Alberta coals and investigated the kinetics of Fe3+-mediated CAWE in 1 mol/L H2SO4 at 90 °C. They found that the fixed carbon content and functional groups in coal have a significant impact on Fe3+-mediated CAWE. De Abreu et al. [68] reported that the activity of coal is inhibited by the formation of illite, siderite, and carbonate films on the surface of the coal particles in CAWE. Recently, Gong et al. [69] studied the effect of the inherent mineral matter on lignite slurry electrolysis. The results suggested that some inherent mineral matter in lignite are converted into the corresponding metal ions, which enter the electrolyte, and therefore, enhance the current density of CAWE. Thomas et al. [70] found that the electrochemical activity of coal diminishes with the time of oxidation, which is owing to the buildup of oxidized organic functional groups on the coal particle surface with time. Chen et al. [54] reported that the electrochemical reactivity of biochar decreased owing to the accumulation of OGs on the biochar surface. Gong et al. [29] reported that some active OGs on the surface of lignite are oxidized easily, such as –C-O and C–O–C. Above all, the mineral matter and OGs in coal influence its electrolysis of coal. Low-rank coal, with significant mineral matter and OGs, accounts for half of the coal reserves worldwide [71]. Compared to traditional low-rank coal utilization methods, Fe3+-mediated CAWE is a suitable method to utilize low-rank coal effectively. To promote the development of Fe3+-mediated CAWE of low-rank coal, this study focuses on the influence of mineral matter and OGs on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. Moreover, the evolution of the chemical structure of coal is analyzed after the electrolysis, so as to understand the reaction mechanism of low-rank coal electrolysis based on the change in the chemical structure of coal and provide guidance for the effective use of electrolyzed coal. First, the effects of the mineral matter and the OGs on Fe3+-mediated CAWE were studied by electrochemical methods. Second, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to determine the microstructural, surface structure, and microcrystalline changes in the coal after electrolysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and materials,"2.1 Chemicals and materials Zhundong subbituminous coal (ZS), from Zhundong Coal Mine in Xinjiang Province, China, was used in this study. It was pulverized to less than 200 mesh (<74 μm) and subsequently dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h before use. The ultimate and proximate analyses of the samples are listed in Table 1 . Fe2(SO4)3 was purchased from Aladdin. H2O2 (30%), HCl, HF, and H2SO4 were purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the reagents used in this study were analytical grade reagents. Deionized water purified by a Millipore Milli-Q system was used in all the experiments. The Pt electrode (1 cm × 1 cm) used in the experiment was purchased from Shanghai Sanhao Industrial Co., Ltd. Nafion membrane 117 was used as the proton conducting polymer electrolyte membrane, which was purchased from Xuzhou Youjing Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. Nafion membrane 117 was pretreated by boiling in 5 wt% H2O2, washed with ultra-pure water, and kept in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 for 1 h at 90 °C [14]."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation The deashing procedure of the coal samples was as follows: 50 g of ZS was added to 500 mL of 6 mol/L HCl. The slurry was heated and stirred for 24 h at 60 °C. After filtration, the sample was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene beaker, and 500 mL of HF (40%) was added. The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 24 h and filtered again. Another 500 mL of 6 mol/L HCl was added, and the sample was heated for 24 h at 60 °C. Subsequently, the sample was filtered and washed with deionized water until the filtrate became neutral, and it was finally dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The demineralized coal is denoted as ZS-D. The procedure for modifying the OGs in the sample was as follows: 3 g of ZS was added to a 100-mL three-necked flask with magnetic stirring at 60 °C. Subsequently, 30 mL of 30% H2O2 solution was added dropwise to the three-necked flask through a constant-pressure dropping funnel (dropping completed within 30 min). After reaction for 10 h, the reaction mixture was separated by filtration to obtain the treated coals. The treated coals were dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h and are represented as ZS-H."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements An H-type electrochemical cell was used to conduct the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. The volumes of both the anodic and cathodic compartments were 100 mL each, which were separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. In all the experiments, the anodic and cathodic compartments were both filled with 80 mL of H2SO4 (1 mol/L). When performing the experiment of Fe3+-mediated CAWE, 2.4 g coal and 1.6 g Fe2(SO4)3 were added to the anodic compartment with stirring at a constant rate of 800 r/min at 60 °C. Pt electrodes (1 × 1 cm2) were used as anode and cathode plates, and the distance between the electrodes was 6 cm. A Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode was used as the reference electrode. The electrocatalytic performance was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) in a typical three-electrode system using a CHI660E electrochemistry workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Company). LSV measurements were recorded from 0.0 V to 1.2 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4 with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The CP measurements were recorded at 0.8 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4 and stopped when the current density became less than 1 mA/cm2. For the convenience of description, the samples, for the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, undergoing CP were labeled as “i-E” (i represents the name of the sample), such as “ZS-E″, “ZS-D-E,” and “ZS-H-E”."
5,Analysis,"2.4 Analysis 2.4.1 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique by collecting 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The measuring region of the FTIR spectra was 4000–400 cm−1. The OMNIC software was used for the FTIR data preprocessing. To analyze the FTIR data, the peak separation and quantitative calculation of the FTIR spectra were processed using Peakfit V4.12. The second derivative of each spectrum was utilized to determine the positions and number of bands. Gauss functions were used to fit the FTIR spectra. Finally, each simulated peak was integrated, and the corresponding fraction was calculated by its area [72,73]. To characterize the functional groups in the organic components, nine structural parameters were obtained using the intensities in the infrared (IR) absorption spectra [74–78]. These structural parameters were calculated using Eqs. (6)–(14). The roles of these structural parameters are listed in Table 2 . (6) I 1 = A 700 − 900 c m − 1 A 2700 − 3000 c m − 1 (7) I 2 = A 700 − 900 c m − 1 A 1600 c m − 1 (8) I 3 = A 1500 − 1600 c m − 1 A 2700 − 3000 c m − 1 (9) I 4 = A 2955 − 2960 c m − 1 A 2920 − 2945 c m − 1 (10) I 5 = A 1650 − 1800 c m − 1 A t o t a l (11) I 6 = A 1000 − 1300 c m − 1 A t o t a l (12) I 7 = A 1700 c m − 1 A t o t a l (13) I 8 = A 1650 − 1800 c m − 1 A 1000 − 1300 c m − 1 (14) I 9 = A 3000 − 3600 c m − 1 + A 1000 − 1300 c m − 1 A 1500 − 1600 c m − 1 2.4.2 XPS analysis A Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray spectrometer was used to determine the surface compositions of the coal samples. The X-ray spectrometer was equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source and operated at 150 W. The C1 s peak at 284.8 eV was used as the internal standard calibration [75,79]. The XPS PeakFit software was used for peak fitting. 2.4.3 XRD analysis An X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical X’PERT) was used to analyze the structures of the coal samples. The scanning angle range (2θ) was from 5° to 90°, and the scanning speed was 2° min−1. Based on XRD theory, four microcrystalline structure parameters— interlayer spacing (d002), stacking height (Lc), crystallite diameter (La), and average number of aromatic layers per carbon crystallite (N)—were acquired using the empirical Braggs and Scherrer equation [74,80,81]. (14a) d 002 = λ 2 sin θ 002 (15) L a = K a ⋅ λ β 100 ⋅ cos θ 100 (16) L c = K c ⋅ λ β 002 ⋅ cos θ 002 (17) N = L c d 002 + 1 where λ is the X-ray wavelength, nm; θ 002 and θ 100 are the diffraction angles of the 002 and 100 diffraction peaks, respectively; β 002 and β 100 are the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) corresponding to the 002 and 100 peaks, respectively; and K c and K a are constants with values of 0.9 and 1.84, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of minerals and OGs on Fe3+-mediated CAWE,"3.1 Effects of minerals and OGs on Fe3+-mediated CAWE The XRD spectra of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Compared to ZS, the relevant characteristic peaks of the minerals in ZS-D and ZS-H disappeared, suggesting that the minerals were removed. Fig. 1(b) shows the atomic ratios of O obtained from the XPS spectra of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H. The atomic ratio of O in ZS is almost the same as that in ZS-D; however, the atomic ratio of O in ZS-H is significantly higher than that in ZS. This suggests that ZS-H is rich in OGs compared to ZS and ZS-D. Furthermore, the electrolysis of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H was performed with LSV and CP measurements to investigate the effects of the minerals and the OGs on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. The results are displayed in Fig. 1(c) and (d). As shown in Fig. 1(c), when ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H are added to the H2SO4 electrolyte, the onset potential of the anodic reaction significantly decreases in comparison with that in the pure H2SO4 electrolyte. This suggests that the Fe3+ -mediated CAWE is effective at improving the thermodynamics of electrolysis of water. It should be noted that irrespective of ZS, ZS-D, or ZS-H electrolysis, as the applied potential increases, the current density increases sharply initially, and subsequently becomes steady until the applied potential reaches the onset potential of the OER. This suggests that the Fe3+-mediated CAWE is controlled by a diffusion process [66,82,83]. The limiting current density decreases in the order: ZS > ZS-D > ZS-H, suggesting that the minerals are beneficial for the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, whereas the OGs have a negative impact on it. The results obtained by the CP measurements are in good agreement with the LSV test results. As exhibited in Fig. 1(d), initially, the current densities of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H drop sharply over a short time, and subsequently, gradually decrease until the reaction stops. This is probably owing to the formation of oxides on the surface of the coal, which leads to its inactivation [21,56,66,84]. The current density of ZS is the highest, followed by those of ZS-D and ZS-H, which further proves that the minerals and the OGs have positive and negative effects on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, respectively. To reveal the degrees of influence of the minerals and the OGs on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the total charge and the reaction time obtained using the I–t curves of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H are obtained, as displayed in Fig. 1(e). The reaction time of ZS is 135959.49 s. However, in comparison with ZS, the reaction times of ZS-D and ZS-H decrease by 28.35% and 59.80% because of the effects of the minerals and the OGs, respectively. Hydrogen yield can be directly reflected by the total charge, and the total charges of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H are 598.94C, 400.39C, and 188.82C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(e). The results indicate that the hydrogen yields of ZS-D and ZS-H are 33.15% and 68.47% lower than that of ZS owing to the influence of the minerals and the OGs, respectively. Therefore, the OGs in the coal have a greater influence on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE than the inherent minerals. The possible reasons for the above results are as follows. The ash composition analysis results of ZS are summarized in Table S1. From Table S1, the metal ions in the minerals of ZS include Fe3+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na2+. Some metal ions can catalyze CAWE, such as Fe3+; concurrently, alkali metal ions enter an electrolyte, thereby improving its conductivity [69,85]. In Fe3+-mediated CAWE also, these metal ions may play the same role; thus, the reactivity of ZS-D is lower than that of ZS. The reasons for the inhibition of the reaction by the OGs may be explained by two aspects: (1) prevention of the electron transfer [21] and (2) suppression of the transformation of Fe3+ to Fe2+ [60,66]. Based on reactions (3)–(5), the cycle between Fe3+ and Fe2+ is crucial for hydrogen production. However, because ZS-H is rich in OGs, the cycle between Fe3+ and Fe2+ is blocked; thus, the reactivity of ZS-H is significantly lower than that of ZS."
8,Changes in chemical structures of coal samples after electrolysis,"3.2 Changes in chemical structures of coal samples after electrolysis 3.2.1 Microstructure change of coal samples FTIR spectroscopy is one of the most useful techniques for probing the functional groups of coal; thus, it can be used to gain insight into coal microstructure [86]. Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the raw and treated coals obtained by the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. As displayed in Fig. 2, the spectral peaks of all the coal samples are similar; however, the peak intensities are different, indicating that the functional groups in the coals have changed after the reaction. The absorption peak at 1593 cm−1 ascribed to the aromatic nucleus CC stretching vibration decreases in intensity for ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H. The broad absorption at 1000–1300 cm−1 assigned to the C–O stretching vibration in the phenols, ethers, and alcohols of ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E has a higher intensity than that of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, respectively. To obtain detailed information of the changes in the coal microstructures after the electrolysis, a curve-fitting method is used in this study. The FTIR spectra of all the coal samples can be divided into four regions: 3600–3000 cm−1, belonging to the O–H group stretching vibration; 3000–2700 cm−1, corresponding to the aliphatic C–H group stretching vibration; 1800–1000 cm−1, attributed to the OGs and the aromatics; and 900–700 cm−1, classified as the aromatic C–H group out-of-plane bending vibration. For all the coal samples in this study, curve-fitting of the IR spectra in the above-mentioned four regions was performed, as shown in Figs. S1–6. Furthermore, nine structural parameters were calculated using the areas of the fitted peaks in the IR spectra of the coal samples, as displayed in Fig. 3 . As can be seen in Fig. 3, during the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, regardless of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, all the structural parameters, I 1–I 7, present the same trend, suggesting that the minerals and the OGs have little influence on the variation in the microstructure of the coal. Based on Fig. 3(a), the I 1 values of ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E are higher than those of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, respectively, suggesting that the aromatic hydrogen content in the coals increases after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. This may be due to the decomposition of the fatty side chains in the coals. As can be seen from Fig. 3(b), for ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, the I 2 values increase following the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, suggesting that the degree of aromatic ring condensation increases after the reaction. Based on Fig. 3(c), after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the I 3 values of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H decrease, indicating that the coal rank decreases after the reaction. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the I 4 values of ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E are higher than those of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, respectively. This suggests that the lengths of the aliphatic side chains are shortened and the degree of the branching aliphatic side sides is decreased after the reaction [87]. These trends can be explained by the change in I 1. I 5, I 6, and I 7 are used to study the behaviors of the CO, C–O, and COOH groups, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 3(e)–(g), the values of I 5, I 6, and I 7 of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H are lower than those of ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E, respectively, indicating that all the types of OGs in the coals increase after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. Therefore, I 9, which can reflect the degree of OGs, increases after the reaction, as observed in Fig. 3(i). The I 8 value of ZS-E is higher than that of ZS, whereas the I 8 values of ZS-D-E and ZS-H-E are lower than those of ZS-D and ZS-H, respectively. The results indicate that the demineralization and oxidation treatments of ZS with H2O2 promote the decomposition of CO and lead to high C–O contents during the Fe3+-mediated CAWE [88]. 3.2.2 Surface structure change of coal samples To understand the surface structure changes of the coal samples before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, XPS spectra of all the coal samples were obtained and fitted using the XPS PeakFit software. The results are displayed in Figs. S7–12 and summarized in Tables 3–6 . As observed from Table 3, the binding energies corresponding to the C 1s peaks are 284.8 eV, 286 eV, 287.4 eV, and 288.9 eV for the carbon in the C–C/C–H, C–O, CO, and COO- moieties, respectively [75,79,89]. The C–C/C–H-containing structures are the dominant carbon forms in the coal samples (ZS, ZS-E, ZS-D, ZS-D-E, ZS-H, and ZS-H-E). The O 1s spectra are curve-resolved into four peaks at 531.5, 532.4, 533.3, and 534 eV, which are ascribed to the CO, C–OH, COO, and COOH groups, respectively, as listed in Table 4 [75,88–91]. The CO and C–OH groups are the two main species in the oxygen-containing compounds in ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H both before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. The C–OH group contents in ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E are higher than those of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, respectively. The results show that –OH is introduced into the surface structures of the coals after the reaction. As can be seen from Table 5, the XPS spectrum of N1s is divided into five peaks at 398.3, 399.4, 400.3, 401.2, and 402.4 eV, corresponding to pyridinic nitrogen, amino nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, quaternary nitrogen, and nitrogen oxides, respectively [79,89]. Quaternary nitrogen and nitrogen oxides are the two main species of nitrogen-containing compounds in ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. The contents of the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogens in ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E are lower than those of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, respectively. This suggests that the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogens on the coal surface are converted to other forms of nitrogen after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. As listed in Table 6, the XPS spectra of S 2p are fitted with five peaks at 163.3, 164.1, 165.8, 168.9, and 169.6 eV, which are assigned to mercaptan or thiophenol, thiophene, sulfoxide, sulfone, and inorganic sulfur, respectively [75,79,89]. It can be seen that the forms and contents of the sulfur-containing compounds on the surface of coal have large differences before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. Five S 2p peaks can be fitted from the XPS spectrum of elemental S in ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, whereas three S 2p peaks can be fitted from that in ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E. These suggest that the composition of organic sulfur on the coal surface is altered after the reaction. Sulfone and inorganic sulfur are the main sulfur-containing compounds on the coal surface after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that regardless of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, the surface structure changes in the coal samples present the same patterns during the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, suggesting that the minerals and the OGs have a slight effect on how the surface structure changes in the coal. The existing forms and contents of the elements on the coal surface change after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. 3.2.3 Microcrystalline change of coal samples The microstructural changes of the coal samples before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE were analyzed by XRD. Fig. 4 shows the XRD spectra of all the coal samples. From Fig. 4, the XRD profiles of all the coal samples present a noticeable peak, 002, whose 2θ is in the range of 20–30°, and an unobvious peak 100, whose 2θ is in the range of 40–50°. The 002 and 100 bands are related to the stacking of the aromatic layers and the extension of the aromatic molecules in the plane of the layer, respectively [81]. The intensities of peaks 002 and 100 of ZS-E, ZS-D-E, and ZS-H-E decrease, respectively, compared to those of ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, indicating that the microcrystalline structures of the coals change after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. To gain more insight into the detailed information about the changes in the microcrystalline structure of coal, four microcrystalline structure parameters–inter-layer spacing (d002), stacking height (Lc), crystallite diameter (La), and average number of aromatic layers per carbon crystallite (N)—were calculated, as shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5, for ZS, ZS-D, and ZS-H, the values of d002, La, and N are almost the same before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. This suggests that the inter-layer spacing, stacking height, and average number of aromatic layers per carbon crystallite of the coal do not change after the reaction. However, after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the La values of ZS-E and ZS-D-E are lower than those of ZS and ZS-D, respectively, and the La values of ZS-H-E are higher than those of ZS-H. The above trends suggest that the change in the coal crystallite result is mainly due to the change in the crystallite diameter for the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, which may be related to the conversion of coal to light hydrocarbons. In addition, the removal of the minerals from the coal do not change the change trend of the crystallite diameter. However, the introduction of OGs in the coal will increase the crystallite diameter of the coal before and after the Fe3+ -mediated CAWE."
9,Conclusions,"In the present study, the effects of mineral matter and oxygen-containing functional groups (OGs) on Fe3+-mediated coal-assisted water electrolysis (CAWE) for hydrogen production were investigated. The microstructural, surface structure, and crystallite changes in the coals were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively, before and after the Fe3+-mediated CAWE. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The minerals and the OGs have a positive and a negative influence on the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, respectively. In addition, the OGs in the coal have a greater influence on the Fe3+- mediated CAWE than the minerals in the coal. (2) For the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the minerals and the OGs have a slight influence on the microstructure changes in the coals. Following the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the microstructures of the coal change as follows: a) the content of the aromatic hydrogen in the coal increases; b) the degree of aromatic ring condensation increases; c) coal rank decreases; and d) all types of OGs in the coal increase, including CO, C–O, and COOH groups. (3) The minerals and the OGs have a slight effect on the surface structure changes in the coal. Following the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the surface structure of the coal changes as follows: a) –OH is introduced to the surface structure of coal; b) pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen on the coal surface are converted into other forms of nitrogen, and c) the composition of organic sulfur on the coal surface is altered. (4) Following the Fe3+-mediated CAWE, the interlayer spacing, stacking height, and average number of aromatic layers per carbon crystallite of the coal are unaltered. In comparison, the crystallite diameter of the coal changes, causing a variation in the microcrystalline structure of the coal."
