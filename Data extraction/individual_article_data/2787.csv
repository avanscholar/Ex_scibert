0,Introduction,"Valorization of waste and biomass to produce clean energy and/or chemical feedstock is crucial for a sustainable environment and economy. Current technologies such as landfilling and incineration create air and water pollution, as leaching of hazardous chemicals and metals to groundwater and release of toxic and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere occur. As a clean and cheap technology, hydrothermal gasification of wastes with high moisture content and wet biomass can provide producing high yield of bio-fuel without requiring a drying process. Especially, secondary renewable energy source “hydrogen” can be produced by this method as an alternative to fossil fuels which causes high greenhouse gas emissions. There are number of studies in the literature with the model compounds (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) to understand the chemical reactions during the hydrothermal gasification of biomass. The effect of alkali, metal, carbon based catalysts with/without support on product yields has been investigated to increase the desired product yields and to decrease the char formation. Hydrothermal gasification studies in literature were mainly focused on model compounds of biomass components which are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The most of these studies were performed with catalysis to obtain high hydrogen yield and less char and tar formation. Alkali, metal, carbon based catalysts and with/without catalyst carriers were main type catalysts used in hydrothermal gasification. The effect of some catalysts such as Ru modified Ni catalyst [1], combination of NaOH or CaOH with Ru/Al2O3 catalyst [2] and K2CO3 [3] on glucose as a representative of cellulose was investigated to produce gas with high hydrogen yield. Catalytic co-gasification of starch and catechol as model of carbohydrates and phenol compounds was investigated in the presence of CaO and TiO2 as catalysts. Hydrogen yield increased by 35% when CaO and TiO2 were introduced to the process as a mixture [4]. Pine wood [5], sewage sludge [6], macro [7] and micro algae [8,9] as real biomass samples were gasified in sub- or supercritical water. Pine wood was gasified in subcritical water with the addition of sodium perborate monohydrate (NaBO3·H2O) which has similar structure with Borax. Bio-oils obtained in catalytic and thermal runs were mostly oxygenated hydrocarbons like phenolic compounds [5]. Gasification of sewage sludge was investigated in fluidized bed reactor with alkali catalysts. Catalytic activity of different catalysts for hydrogen production was in the following order: KOH>K2CO3 >NaOH>Na2CO3 [6]. In recent years, micro and macro algal biomass samples have been subjected to hydrothermal gasification process to produce energy fuels or chemical feedstock. Hydrogen production was boosted in the presence of NaOH together with Ni/Al2O3 [7], also the addition of salt mixtures increased the production of extracted lipids [8] or synthetic natural gas [9] in sub- and supercritical water. Conventional gasification of hard-shell nuts residues with the addition of mineral salts has been studied recently; however the low hydrogen yields is the main drawback for this method. Midilli et al. [10] reported that less than 15% hydrogen yield in the product gas was obtained during downdraft gasification of hazelnut shell residues. Mudge et al. [11] studied the catalytic steam gasification of wood using alkali carbonates and naturally occurring minerals (Trona and Borax). Orıo et al. [12] investigated Dolomites for oxygen/steam gasification of wood in a downstream catalytic reactor. Turkey has a big potential in terms of the availability of hard-shell nut residues to be used in energy production. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, hard-shell nut (hazelnut, walnut, almond, pistachio nut and chestnut) production was 1 million ton in 2011, and the share of hazelnut, walnut and almond were 600.000, 178.142 and 55.398tons, respectively [13]. Turkey hosts notably diverse mineral resources; the most important ones are boron salts, marble, magnesite, Dolomite, barite, feldspar, pumice, zeolite, bentonite, diasporite, Trona, sepiolite, diatomite, kaolin, gypsium and perlite. While the Dolomite is the major mineral reserve with 15.8 billion tons, Turkey has the largest boron reserve in the world with 2.2 billion tons, which is 71% of the total reserves in the world according to Eti Mine/Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA, Turkey) [14]. Trona reserves in Turkey are approximately 1.9 billion tons that can be processed and ranks second in the world [15]. Considering the enormous potential of mine reserves in Turkey, the use of these minerals as a catalyst would be an alternative assessment method. Recovery of these natural mineral catalysts would not be required from economic and environmental aspects. Novelty of this study is the usage of natural mineral catalysts in hydrothermal gasification of hard shell nuts. In addition, hydrothermal gasification of various types of feed and concentration to achieve better process efficiency is required to highlight further studies. In this study, hydrothermal gasification of some hard-shell nuts (hazelnut, walnut and almond shells) residues was performed in batch reactor at temperature and pressure ranges of 300–600°C and 88–405bar. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of temperature and natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax) on production of hydrogen and some valuable chemicals from these renewable sources."
1,Experimental,
2,Samples,"2.1 Samples Residues of hard-shell nuts (hazelnut, walnut and almond) were used for hydrothermal gasification. These samples were dried at open-air and grounded to get small fractions. Sieved samples (<0.5-mm) were conducted to elemental analysis by using elemental analyzer (CHNS-932 by Leco, Michigan, USA). Proximate and ultimate analysis of biomass samples were given in Table 1 . Method of Van Soest [16] was used to identify cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content of biomass samples and given in Table 1. Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O], Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] and Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O] minerals were used as received. Compositions of these minerals were given in Table 2 . All mineral catalysts had the concentration of 10wt.% based on biomass amount. Trona and Borax were dissolved in water and Dolomite mineral was used directly. Trona (Beypazarı, Ankara), Dolomite and Borax (Eskişehir) were mined in Turkey."
3,Reactor system,"2.2 Reactor system Hydrothermal gasification of hard-shell nut residues were performed in a stainless steel batch reactor which has a volume of 100mL and designed to withstand a maximum temperature and pressure of 650°C and 50MPa, respectively. Reactor was heated with electrical furnace and the temperature was controlled with a PID controller. Reactor was also shaken with a motor and details of batch autoclave were given in elsewhere [17]."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Predetermined amount of residue of hard-shell nut and water (1.2g of biomass/15mL of water) were fed into batch reactor. When experiments were carried out with catalyst, 0.12g of natural mineral catalysts was added to reaction mixture. Nitrogen gas is supplied for 5min to remove air inside the reactor. Reactor was placed in electrical furnace and heated to set temperature with a heating rate of 6Kmin−1. Reactor swings in vertical direction during reaction time which was 1h. Maximum pressure reached for all reaction temperatures and catalyst types were given in Table 3 . After completion of reaction time, reactor was removed from furnace and cooled down to ambient temperature by using fans. Volume of the gaseous product was measured by a gasometer and gas samples were taken using gas tight syringes. The gas volume was measured in ±10% accuracy. The products remaining in the reactor were washed with water and filtered to separate solid residue. Sticky brown humin polymers were observed at temperatures lower than 450°C in reactor. After removal of the products in reactor, the inside of reactor was washed with THF (tetrahydrofuran). THF was evaporated under vacuum by using a rotary evaporator and the amount of this product (tar) was found extremely low compared with the filtrated solid (char). Total of char and tar were called as residue. pH of aqueous products was lowered to 2 by addition of 1–2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid which was required to inhibit ionization of organic acids. Aqueous products were stored in a refrigerator at 4°C. Detailed explanation on analysis of samples of the gaseous, aqueous and solid products was given in the Section 2.4. Carbon balance of product yields (gaseous, aqueous and residue) closed within 94–99%. All experiments were performed in triplicate with a resulting precision of product yields about 5%."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis 2.4.1 Gaseous product analysis HP 7890A gas chromatography was used to analyze composition of gaseous products (H2, CO2, CO and C1–C4 hydrocarbons). Gas chromatography was equipped with 3 detectors (FID-TCD-TCD) and serially connected 7 columns. Technical features and operating conditions of gas chromatography were given in Table 4 . The standard deviation for the results of gas composition was calculated to be ±2%. 2.4.2 Aqueous product analysis Total organic carbon (TOC) content of aqueous phase was analyzed by a TOC analyser (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH, Japan). The concentration of total phenols was determined colorimetrically (Jenway Colorimeter, Model 6051, UK). Light source is tungsten filament lamp and measurements were performed at 470nm. Concentrations of compounds (carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, furfurals and phenols) in the aqueous products were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, Japan). All HPLC analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu LC-20A series liquid chromatography device equipped with a Inertsil ODS-3 column. The HPLC system consisted of a DGU-20AS degassing module, LC-20AT gradient pump, CTO-10ASVP chromatography oven and SPD-20 multi-wavelength ultraviolet detector. Analysis of calibration standards repeated for 5 times and calibration curves were prepared by plotting a linear regression of the average response factor versus analyte concentration. Carboxylic acids, phenols and furfurals were analyzed according to Method I, while aldehydes and ketones were analyzed by applying Method II. The aldehydes and ketones were derivatized to their hydrozone forms by addition of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to aqueous samples. 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone forms of aldehydes and ketones were prepared as the same method described in the literature [18]. Technical features and operating conditions of HPLC for Method I and Method II were given in Table 5 . 2.4.3 Residue analysis Solid sample module of a TOC analyser (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH-SSM-5000A, Japan) was used to determine the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the solid residue."
6,Results and discussion,"In this study, hydrothermal gasification of three types of different hard-shell nut residues (hazelnut, walnut and almond shells) was performed in batch reactor. Results related with hydrothermal gasification products were interpreted as a function of temperature and catalyst. As the all biomasses have different carbon content, product yields were given in the unit of per kg C in biomass differing from the earlier studies [19,20]."
7,Influence of process parameters on gaseous product,"3.1 Influence of process parameters on gaseous product All experiments were carried out between 300 and 600°C in the absence and presence of natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax). The product (gaseous, aqueous and residue) yields (wt.%) of hazelnut, walnut and almond shells were given in Figs. 1–3 , respectively. Gaseous product yield increases with increasing temperature while aqueous product yield decreases as a result of degradation into gaseous product. Enhancement in gaseous product yield was obtained by changing reaction conditions from subcritical (<374°C) to supercritical condition (>374°C). When the temperature increased from 300°C to 600 °C, gaseous product yield of hazelnut shell was increased by 28.5% with Trona, 23.5% with Dolomite and 25.9% with Borax. Similar increase in gas yields was observed on both walnut and almond shell residues as the reaction temperature increased. Trona was determined as the most effective additive amongst the three natural mineral salts, since for the whole biomass samples the highest gas yield was achieved when Trona was used in hydrothermal gasification. Gaseous product was composed of mainly H2, CH4 and CO2 while CO and C2–C4 as minors. Composition of gaseous products influenced by process parameters (temperature, pressure and catalyst) and biomass type. Variation of gaseous product yields with the changing process parameters (temperature, pressure and catalyst) for SCWG of hazelnut, walnut and almond shell residues were given in Figs. 4–6 , respectively. The yields of hydrogen and methane (mol gas/kg C in biomass) were improved with the increase in temperature from 300°C to 600°C. The addition of all natural salts further enhanced the yields for all biomass samples. In the presence of Trona, hydrogen yield increased by 82.4%, when hazelnut shell residue was the feed; and increased by 74.1% when walnut shell was used. Although the Dolomite and Borax addition increased the hydrogen and methane yield as well, Trona was the most significant natural salt affecting the gas yields. Methane which is the main constituent of natural gas has bright future in green-energy market. Methane yield (molCH4/kgC in biomass) of hazelnut shell at 600°C was increased by 75.3% with Trona, 64.7% with Dolomite and 68.2% with Borax. At the same conditions, methane yield of walnut shell was enhanced by 50.0% with Trona, 49.1% with Dolomite and 38.2% with Borax while methane yield of almond shell was increased by 36.4% with Trona, 41.3% with Dolomite and 35.5% with Borax. Gaseous product yield (wt.%), hydrogen yield (mol H2/kg C in biomass) and methane yield (molCH4/kgC in biomass) of these hard-shell nuts can be ordered as almond shell>walnut shell>hazelnut shell. This situation can be explained by diversity in biomass composition, especially lignin content. As given in Table 1, hazelnut shell contains the highest lignin content (40.0wt.%) compared with walnut (35.4wt.%) and almond (28.8wt.%) shells, and it is known that lignin is the most resistant component of biomass to gasify [21]. Improvements in gaseous product yield and hydrogen yield of these hard-shell nuts were found higher compared to our previous study [22] that performed with lower lignin content biomasses, cotton (19.4wt.%) and tobacco (13.4wt.%) stalks in the presence of natural mineral catalysts. It can be concluded that natural mineral catalysts are effective in degradation of lignin in hard-shell nuts. The activity of selected natural mineral catalysts in hydrothermal gasification can be ordered as being Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O]>Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O]>Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. Effect of natural mineral catalysts like alkali salts [23,24] on SCWG gaseous products was explained by formation of formate salts through WGS reaction [22,25]. Both presence of mineral catalysts and high reaction temperature increased carbon dioxide and methane yields which are being thermodynamically stable compounds."
8,Influence of process parameters on aqueous product,"3.2 Influence of process parameters on aqueous product Aqueous product and residue yields for shells of hazelnut, walnut and almond were given in Figs. 1–3 in terms of weight percent. In general, increase in aqueous product yield was observed when reaction temperature was higher than supercritical value (>374°C) due to stimulation of steam-reforming and methanation reactions at elevated temperatures. With the increasing temperature, the product yield of all biomass samples shifted from liquids and solids to gas products. The addition of the natural mineral salts enhanced the gas yields even further, by converting more organics from liquid and solid to gas. Compared to non-catalytic experiments, aqueous product yield of hazelnut shell at 600°C was lowered by 26.6% with Trona, 39.4% with Dolomite and 10.8% with Borax. Also, aqueous product yield of walnut shell at 600°C was increased by 70.7% with Trona, 15.7% with Dolomite and 85.7% with Borax. Similar tendency was obtained for almond shell which was increased by 121.3% with Trona, 2.1% with Dolomite and 109.0% with Borax. Total organic carbon (TOC) of aqueous products decreases with increasing temperature from 300 to 600°C for all used catalysts since aqueous products converted into gaseous products (Figs. 7–9 ). Below critical point, the mineral salts increased the degradation of biomass to yield more aqueous products which mostly consist of carboxyl acids, which increased the TOC of the aqueous products. This may be a result of fixation of carboxyl acids by the mineral salts. This effect also was seen in aqueous product yield (Figs. 1–3) and composition (Tables 6–8 ). With the further increase in temperature, carboxyl acids (mainly acetic acid) and the other intermediates such as alcohols, phenols, aldehydes and ketones was degraded to yield gaseous products, while the stable acetate forms remained in the aqueous product. 3.2.1 Formation of sodium acetate with reaction of Trona and acetic acid Proposed reaction mechanisms between Trona and acetic acid were given in Eqs. (1)–(4). Trona can react with acetic acid according to Eq. (1) or hydrolyzed Trona products (NaHCO3 and NaOH) in Eq. (2) can react with acetic acid according to Eqs. (3) and (4) yielding sodium acetate. Trona's high impact on hydrogen yield in gas phase partially might be a result of NaOH production in Eq. (2), as it promotes the water–gas shift reaction, and helps capturing the carbon in the solid residue as sodium salts [26].

(5)–(8). Dolomite can react with acetic acid according to Eq. (5) or hydrolyzed Dolomite products ( Ca ( HCO 3 ) 2 , Mg ( HCO 3 ) 2 , Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2) in Eq. (6) can react with acetic acid according to Eqs. (7) and (8) yielding calcium acetate and magnesium acetate.

(9)–(11). Borax can react with acetic acid according to Eq. (9) or hydrolyzed Borax products (H2B4O7, H3BO3 and NaOH) in Eq. (10) can react with acetic acid according to Eq. (11) yielding sodium acetate. The same effect of NaOH might be observed in here, as during the interactions of Borax and acetic acid, it could be produced to capture carbon in solid residue.

9,Interpretation of aqueous and gaseous product results,"3.3 Interpretation of aqueous and gaseous product results Simplified mechanism for conversion of biomass to gaseous products through aqueous intermediates is given at sub- and supercritical conditions of water in the presence of natural mineral catalysts in Fig. 10 . Biomass is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, inorganics and extractives. Cellulose and hemicellulose can hydrolysed rapidly to monosaccharides which are glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose, galactose, fructose in hydrothermal conditions. In ionic-dominated environment, these sugars dehydrated to furan type compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), 5-methyl furfural (5-MF), and furfural which can further hydrolysed and converted to carboxylic acids, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes and ketones. Lignin, as the most resistant component of biomass to gasify, can hydrolyse to p-coumaryl, coniferyl or sinapyl alcohols which are converted to syringols, guaiacols, catechols, phenols and cresols. Dehydration and dehydrogenation of these phenolic compounds leads to formation of coke or formation of tars. Main degradation products of lignin are furfural and phenols that degraded into gaseous products but much slower than small aliphatic hydrocarbons. Hydration of intermediate aqueous products in the presence of natural mineral catalysts leads to formation of mainly carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and small amount of hydrogen at sub-critical conditions of water. The overall reactions of biomass gasification can be summarized as: (12) CH x O y + ( 2 − y ) H 2 O → CO 2 + ( 2 − y + x / 2 ) H 2 (13) CH x O y + ( 1 − y ) H 2 O → CO + ( 1 − y + x / 2 ) H 2 Cellulose can hydrolyse to glucose and glucose reforming reaction can be written as; (14) C 6 H 12 O 6 → 6 CO + 6 H 2 In supercritical conditions of water, methane production was also improved by using natural mineral catalysts that catalyzes methanation reactions. Methanation reaction of CO: (15) CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O Methanation reaction of CO2: (16) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O In supercritical conditions of water, formation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen is promoted by WGS reaction leading a decrease in carbon monoxide in the presence of natural mineral catalyst. Water–gas shift reaction: (17) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 As the main degradation products of biomass are carboxylic acids, furfurals, phenols, aldehyde and ketones [23,27], analysis only concentrated on these compounds. Major organic compounds obtained in the bio-oil from gasification of glucose [28] have similarities with results obtained in biomass gasification. Variation of selected aqueous product yields (based on g aqueous product/kg C in biomass) for SCWG of hazelnut, walnut and almond shells with temperature and catalyst were given in Tables 6–8, respectively. The composition of aqueous products changes with temperature and type of catalyst. Except phenol, yield of analyzed aqueous products like carboxylic acids (hydroxyacetic acid, formic acid and acetic acid), furfurals (5-methyl furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and furfural), ethers (1,4-dioxane), aldehydes and ketones (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and 3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-on) decreased with increasing temperature from 300°C to 600°C. At all reaction conditions, main degradation product in aqueous phase was found as acetic acid for all biomass types used and reached highest yield when walnut shell was gasified. The highest yields of aqueous products for all biomass types used were obtained at subcritical condition (300°C). Formic acid and acetic acid are the key compounds which degraded into gaseous products at elevated temperatures. Formic acid dehydrated to carbon monoxide and water at lower temperatures (300°C) while decarboxylated to carbon dioxide and hydrogen at elevated temperatures (>380°C) [29]. Acetic acid mainly decomposed to methane and carbon dioxide at supercritical conditions [30]. HPLC and colorimeter results showed that yield of phenols (phenol, o-, m- and p-cresols) and total phenols (based on gphenol/kgC in biomass) increased up to 500°C and sharply decreased at 600°C. This situation can be explained by degradation of phenols at elevated temperatures with free radical reaction mechanism. In the presence of mineral catalysts, yields of carboxylic acids and phenols increased while yields of aldehydes, ketones and furfurals decreased for all biomass types used. But, it is not possible to decide whether presence of natural mineral catalysts prevent or promote the formation or degradation of these compounds as similarly stated by Sinag et al. [31]. High concentration of carboxylic acids in the presence of mineral catalysts may be due to formation of sodium, calcium or magnesium formates as described in the reactions in previous study [22]. As formates are resistive to decompose [32,33], high yield of carboxylic acids are understandable. Among furfurals, high yield of 5-MF and low yield of 5-HMF were obtained at all reaction conditions. Similar results of Kruse et al. [23], 5-HMF degraded into furfural and 5-MF. It can be generalized that, the highest aqueous product yields for all analyzed compounds were found when Trona was used as catalyst in hydrothermal gasification of hard shell nuts."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, effect of temperature and natural mineral catalysts (Trona, Dolomite and Borax) on gasification of residue of some selected nuts (hazelnut, walnut and almond shells) was evaluated in sub- and supercritical conditions of water. Gaseous product yield increases with increasing temperature while aqueous product yield decreases as a result of degradation of intermediates from biomass (carboxyl acids, alcohols, phenols, furans, aldehydes and ketones) into gaseous product. It was found that, natural mineral catalysts enhance gaseous product yield and composition. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide yield enhanced by lowering carbon monoxide yield through WGS reaction possibly due to alkali production during the intermediate reactions of Trona and Borax. Gaseous product yield (wt.%), hydrogen yield (molH2/kgC in biomass) and methane yield (molCH4/kgC in biomass) of these hard-shell nuts can be ordered as almond shell>walnut shell>hazelnut shell. The activity of selected natural mineral catalysts in hydrothermal gasification can be classified as being Trona [Na3(CO3)(HCO3)·2H2O]>Borax [Na2B4O7·10H2O]>Dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. The highest yields of aqueous products for all biomass types used were obtained at subcritical condition (300°C). At all reaction conditions, main degradation product in aqueous phase was found as acetic acid for all biomass types used and reached highest yield when walnut shell was gasified. As hydrogen and methane are the main desired fuel gases produced by SCWG of biomass, hard shell nut residues can be evaluated as fuel source instead of leaving these residues in environment as waste."
