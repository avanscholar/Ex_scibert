0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic H2 production has received considerable attention due to its unique features of high energy density and zero pollution, which has been deemed as a promising strategy of settling the worldwide energy and environmental concerns [1–3]. Currently, it remains the central task to develop advanced photocatalysts with the advantages of low-cost, high efficiency, good durability and efficient visible-light absorption [4–7]. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted enormous attention because of its high thermal and chemical stability, visible-light response, earth-abundant nature and appealing electronic structure [8–10]. These unique properties endue it with diverse potential applications, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, ammonia synthesis, selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols and pollutant degradation [11,12]. Unfortunately, pristine g-C3N4 possesses limited photocatalytic activity because of its limited visible-light absorption, poor separation and transfer abilities of photo-generated electron-hole pairs [13]. Therefore, the development of powerful strategy to tackle these challenges is highly meaningful yet unresolved. During the past few years, various strategies have been conducted for performance optimization of g-C3N4 [14], including nanostructure engineering [15–19], heteroatom doping [20–24] and heterostructure construction [25–27], where inspiring progresses have been achieved. Generally, building nanostructures can endow typical advantages including larger surface area, more abundant active sites, shorter charge and mass transfer path, as well as greater light penetration compared with the bulk counterpart. On the other hand, heteroatom doping could modulate the band structure by generating localized states between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) through the atomic orbital hybridization [28–34], which can extend its light-absorption edge, promote the separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs and create more active sites [35]. For instance, Guo et al. [36] reported the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate in g-C3N4 hexagonal microtubes through thermal polymerization of hydrothermally synthesized microrod precursors. Ran and co-workers [35] presented that P-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit a 3.6 times higher photocatalytic H2-evolution rate than pristine g-C3N4 by using 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as the P precursor. Although these progresses, there are still several remained challenging issues regarding the performance optimization and extended applications of g-C3N4. Firstly, it is naturally considered that simultaneous manipulation on morphological control and heteroatom doping could further enhance the photocatalytic performance since they can modulate g-C3N4 in different way, which remains a difficult target due to the lack of available synthesis strategies, especially the facile one-pot synthesis method. Secondly, hard/soft templates are generally required to achieve hierarchical micro/nano-structured g-C3N4, which are tedious and cost-inefficient, and could lead to the structural destruction during the template removal. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a feasible template-free method to achieve hierarchical morphology with great uniformity and dispersity. More importantly, most current reports on photocatalytic water splitting have focused on the half reaction of H2 evolution by consuming holes with sacrificial agents such as triethanolamine (TEOA) and methanol, which is quite energy inefficient and seriously hinders the industrialization of photocatalysis based H2 production. In this context, it is highly meaningful to develop bifunctional photocatalyst that can realize simultaneous H2 production and selective oxidation of value-added organic chemicals to achieve the highly efficient solar energy conversion. Herein, we developed a facile supramolecular chemistry mediated one-pot strategy to fabricate mesoporous g-C3N4 hierarchical spheres with controllable doping of non-metal elements such as P and S (denoted as PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS), to achieve the simultaneous manipulation of morphology and electronic structure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation is first conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of heteroatom doping (P or S elements) and its possible effect on the electronic structure of pristine g-C3N4. Representatively, the SCN-HMS exhibits a dramatically enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H2 production rate of as high as 22.3 μmol h−1 using TEOA as the sacrificing agent, which is 13.2 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. More importantly, using SCN-HMS as the bifunctional photocatalyst for both H2 production and selective oxidations of benzyl alcohol (BA), it can still display extraordinary activity with outstanding production rates of 3.76 and 3.87 μmol h−1 for H2 and benzaldehyde (BAD) production, respectively, which eliminates the waste of sacrificing agent and greatly demonstrates its high potential for practical applications."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of samples,"2.1 Preparation of samples All the chemicals were of analytical grade purity and used as received without further purification. In a typical synthesis of P or S doped g-C3N4 samples, 1.0 g of melamine was completely dissolved in 40 mL DMSO, and then 1.02 g cyanuric acid and different amounts of precursors (melamine polyphosphate or trithiocyanuric acid) were dissolved in 20 mL DMSO, respectively. After complete dissolution with sonication, both solutions were mixed together and kept stirring at room temperature for 10 min to get white precipitates. Subsequently, the products were centrifuged and washed two times with absolute ethanol, and then dried at 70 °C for overnight. Finally, the resulting white powder was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h under a flow of argon with a heating rate of 2.3 °C/min. The resultant materials were designated as PCNx or SCNx, respectively, where x represents to the initial amount of different precursors (melamine polyphosphate or trithiocyanuric acid, x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.125 mmol). Undoped g-C3N4 sample (CN-HMS) was prepared by similar process without adding P or S precursors. The bulk g-C3N4 (bulk CN) was synthesized as followed: A porcelain crucible located with 10 g melamine was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 2.3 °C/min."
3,Photocatalytic H2 generation with TEOA as hole sacrificial reagent,"2.2 Photocatalytic H2 generation with TEOA as hole sacrificial reagent The photocatalytic H2-evolution experiments were performed in a top-irradiation type and double layered Pyrex reaction cell (inner volume of 150 mL with a top irradiation area of 15.9 cm2) linked to a glass closed gas system (Lasolar-6A, Beijing PerfectLight Co. Ltd, China). A 300 W Xe-lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Beijing PerfectLight Co. Ltd, China) with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the light source. In a typical photocatalytic H2-evolution experiment, 10 mg of the prepared catalyst was suspended in 20 mL aqueous solution containing 10 vol% triethanolamine, and then the mixture was evacuated several times to completely remove air and dissolved oxygen. The amount of produced H2 was tested every 30 min and analyzed by an on-line gas chromatography (GC-7900, Techcomp, China, TCD detector, TDX-01 Packed column and Ar as a carrier gas). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated from the following equation: AQE = [(2 × the number of evolved H2 molecules)/the number of incident photons] × 100 % A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with different band-pass filters of full width at half maximum (FWHM) =15 nm was employed to achieve different incident light wavelengths for measurement of the quantum efficiency. The average intensity of each irradiation wavelength was determined using an irradiatometer (FZ-A, Beijing Normal University Optical Instrument)."
4,Coupling photocatalytic H2 generation with selective benzyl alcohol oxidation,"2.3 Coupling photocatalytic H2 generation with selective benzyl alcohol oxidation The reaction procedure was performed almost the same as that in 2.2, excepted for using 21 μL benzyl alcohol instead of TEOA. When reaction finished, the suspension was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter, and the resultant solution was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 mL). The product was analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC–MS, ThermoQuest, Trace GC2000/Trace MS) that was equipped with a fused silica capillary column (0.25 μm × 0.25 mm × 30 m) of HP-5. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity of benzyl alcohol (BA)/benzaldehyde (BAD) are defined as follows: Conversion (%) = [(C0 − CBA)/C0] × 100 % Selectivity (%) = [CBAD/(C0 − CBA)] × 100 % Where C0 is the initial concentration of BA, CBA and CBAD are the concentration of the reaction substrate BA and corresponding BAD at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction, respectively."
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were carried out on a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Corporation, China) in a conventional three-electrode configuration by using Ag/AgCl (with saturated KCl aqueous solution) and a Pt net as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 2 mg of the photocatalyst sample and 8 μL of 5 % Nafion were added into the mixed solution of 196 μL DI-water and 196 μL ethanol to make dispersion solution. Then, the solution was dropping onto the surface of the F-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass) and dried at room temperature as the working electrode. The transient photocurrent responses were measured with the lamp on and off at a fixed time interval of 50 s. A 300 W Xe-lamp with an ultraviolet cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the light source, and 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was served as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed at a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with 5 mV amplitude under the open-circle potential. The Mott-Schottky plots were recorded by employing the impedance-potential mode in the potential range of -0.4 to 0.4 V at a frequency of 1000 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV. The Mott-Schottky plots were measured to obtained the flat-band potential for estimating the conduction band position of n-type semiconductor. And the valance band position can be calcinated as following equation: EVB = Eg + ECB Where Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor, EVB and ECB represent the valance and conduction band positions, respectively."
6,DFT computational details,"2.5 DFT computational details Density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations were performed using the projected augmented wave (PAW) [37] method implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [38,39]. The Kohn-Sham one-electron states were expanded using the plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [40] exchange-correlation (XC) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed for the geometrical optimization. Since the GGA approach usually underestimates the band gap of semiconductors, we used the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE) [41] for a more accurate description of the electronic structure. In this work, we used the HSE06 functional [41] with a screening parameter ω = 0.2 Å−1 and a small mixing parameter α (α = 0.175) for the short-range Hartree-Fock exchange instead of the commonly used value of 0.25. Using these parameters (i.e., ω = 0.2 Å−1 and α = 0.175), the calculated band gaps of isolated monolayer g-C3N4 (2.70 eV) compare well with experimental results (2.7 eV) [8] and previous theory (2.7 eV) [42,43]. For S or P doped in the g-C3N4 structure, a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell consisting of 126 atoms (containing 54 carbon atoms, and 72 nitrogen atoms) was considered the starting point of the theoretical calculation. The Brillouin-zone (BZ) integration was carried out using the Monkhorst-Pack [44] sampling method with a density of 2 × 2×1. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was included to avoid the interaction between neighboring slabs. All atoms are fully relaxed until the maximum magnitude of the force acting on the atoms is smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. For the qualitative description of interatomic charge distributions, we used Bader analysis based on atom in molecule (AIM) theory [45]. To compare the relative stability of different doping forms and sites in g-C3N4, the formation energy (Ef) of the substitutional doped systems is defined as: Ef = Edoped – Epure − ∑niμi In the formula, Edoped and Epure are total energies of supercells with a doped and perfect supercell, respectively. μi is the chemical potential of chemical species i (i = C, N, S, P) obtained from the diamond and N2 molecule, S bulk model, and black phosphorus, respectively. ni denotes the number of atoms of species i that have been added to (ni > 0) or removed from (ni < 0) the supercell to form the doped systems."
7,Materials characterization,"2.6 Materials characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on a diffractometer (TTR-III, Rigaku Industrial Corporation, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were performed on a SolidSpec-3700 ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) and a white standard of BaSO4 was used as a reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted using an ESCALab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo-VG Scientific, America). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet 8700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet Corporation, America) with KBr discs in the 4000–400 cm−1 range. The morphology and structure of the synthesized materials were investigated by field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). TEM images, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and TEM-EDX elemental mapping were collected with a Talox F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, America) transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The SEM images were obtained with a field-emission microscope by a FEI Sirion 200. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer (JEOL, Japan) at 300 K. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an F-4600 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi Ltd., Japan) under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves were obtained on a time-corrected single photon counting (TCSPC) system (FM4-TCSPC, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation Wavelength of 350 nm. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected at a Micromeritics Trista II 3020 M surface area and porosity analyzer."
8,Results and discussion,"First, DFT theoretical calculations were performed to verify the feasibility and favorable doping sites of heteroatom into the structure of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 1 a and b, there are five possible doping sites in g-C3N4, including two inequivalent carbon sites and three inequivalent nitrogen sites. To estimate the preferred sites of the P and S atom, these structures are built by introducing one P or S atom to the pristine g-C3N4 backbone, and then the formation energies (E) of all modes are calculated (Table S1). Upon the substitution of P or S on different sites, the pristine CN bonds (Fig. S1) are slightly stretched and a different degree of deformation occurs due to the change of the electronic structure. As indicated, the formation energies of substitutional P and S atom in C6 (site 5) and N4 (site 2) are 0.56 and 0.88 eV, respectively, which are recognized as the optimal doping sites (Fig. 1a, b). With the verified doping sites, we further theoretically reveal the effect of P and S doping on the electronic structures of g-C3N4 by comparing their calculated density of state (DOS), as displayed in Fig. 1c–e. As can be seen, the band gap can be effectively narrowed to 2.45 and 2.40 eV for P and S doping relative to 2.71 eV for the undoped g-C3N4, which could notably enhance its visible light absorption efficiency. More significantly, the P and S doping could generate an extra defect state below the conduction band (CB) compared with the pristine g-C3N4, which could arise from the hybridization of C 2s2p and N 2s2p with P 3s3p or S 3s3p orbitals (Fig. S2). The newly formed midgap states would act as donor levels for lower-energy photoexcitation, enabling better visible light harvesting. According to the above results, it can be concluded that the DFT theoretical calculations can provide a guide for studying the heteroatoms doping forms and sites. Experimentally, we developed a supramolecular chemistry mediated one-pot strategy to fabricate the P or S doped g-C3N4 hierarchical mesoporous spheres (denoted as PCN-HMS or SCN-HMS), as shown in Scheme 1 , which can realize the synergistic effect of nanostructure engineering and electronic modulation. The hierarchical mesoporous spherical structure can be achieved through thermal polycondensation of the supramolecular assembly obtained by simply mixing the equimolar ratio of melamine and cyanuric acid in DMSO at room temperature (denoted as MCA), driven by molecular cooperative assembly between triazine molecules with hydrogen bonds. The general doping of P or S is conducted by adding appropriate amount of the melamine polyphosphate or trithiocyanuric acid molecules during the synthesis of MCA through the acid-base cross-linking effect [46]. The morphological and compositional information of the products are investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping analysis. The un-doped, P-doped and S-doped supramolecular precursors (Fig. 2 a–c) possess identical morphology of spherical structures composed of nanosheet-like assembly with an average diameter of around 2−3 μm. The formation of nanosheet could be related to the structure of melamine-cyanuric acid complex formed by hydrogen bonds in the same plane, which possess a strong direction and saturation (Figs. S3 and S4) [47]. After thermal annealing at 550 °C for 4 h, the final products are converted to graphitic C3N4 for all samples with different P and S doping levels according to their XRD characterizations (Fig. S5), which can be further confirmed by the comparison of their Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S6). Contrastively, their architectures are transformed to hierarchical mesoporous structure with well retained spherical shape (Fig. 2d–f). Meanwhile, the products obtained from the pyrolysis of the precursors added with certain amounts of melamine polyphosphate (Fig. 2g, h) or trithiocyanuric acid (Fig. 2j, k) also show identical spherical structures, while the corresponding elemental mapping results (Fig. 2i and l) clearly indicate the uniform distribution of P and S throughout the whole sphere, respectively. Moreover, the doping amounts of P or S do not alter the spherical morphology (Figs. S7 and S8). The porous structure of the obtained samples are confirmed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption method, where typical type-IV curves and a broad pore size distribution with 10−50 nm range all samples can be observed (Figs. S9–S10), suggesting well-defined mesoporous structures. The BET surface area of PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS are measured to be 55.7 and 58.5 m2 g−1, respectively, which are close to that of undoped CN-HMS (57.2 m2 g−1). The doping sites of the P and S are further verified through x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) characterization besides DFT calculations. The survey spectra (Fig. 3 a) indicate that the SCN-HMS and PCN-HMS are mainly composed of C, N, O, S and C, N, O, P elements, respectively. In the high-resolution spectra (Fig. 3b), the major C 1s peaks (288.37 eV for CN-HMS, 288.48 eV for PCN-HMS and 288.27 eV for SCN-HMS) can be assigned to the sp2-hybridized carbon in the heptazine ring (NCN), while those small peaks could be ascribed to CO and NCO [48]. The N 1s spectra of SCN-HMS, PCN-HMS and CN-HMS can be divided into four peaks with binding energies at around 398.73, 400.03, 401.35 and 404.46 eV, respectively [49]. The major peaks located at 398.73 eV are identified as the sp2-bonded nitride in the N-containing aromatic ring (CNC) in graphitic carbon nitride, while the weak peaks could belong to the tertiary nitride atoms (N-(C)3), the amino functional groups (CNH), and the positive charge effects in CN heterocycles. The peak positions of both C 1s and N 1s for SCN-HMS and PCN-HMS are slightly shifted compared to these of CN-HMS, which implies that their electronic structures could be modulated upon the S or P doping. Importantly, it can be notably observed that extra peaks of P 2p at 133.66 eV for PCN-HMS originated from PN bonds (Fig. 3d) confirms the doping of P by replacing C rather than N in triazine rings [31,50]. Interestingly, the S 2p spectrum of SCN-HMS (Fig. 3e) exhibits an extra peak located at 162.97 eV assigned to the SC coordination [51], which suggests that the P and S atoms are introduced into the framework of C3N4 by respectively substituting the carbon and nitride atoms in accordance with the DFT calculation results. The photocatalytic H2 production activities of all samples are evaluated under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) with 1 wt% Pt as co-catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent. The effect of P doping on the H2 production rate is firstly investigated as shown in Fig. 4 a, b. As indicated, the undoped CN-HMS exhibits a H2 generation rate of 8.93 μmol h−1, which is about 5.3 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 obtained by direct thermal annealing of melamine. This result could strongly reflect the positive role of nanostructure engineering on the photocatalytic performance due to the enhanced visible-light absorption, high surface area, great charge and mass transport ability. Impressively, with the optimal P doping level, a maximum H2 production rate of 18.2 μmol h−1 can be achieved, which is 10.8 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 counterpart. More surprisingly, the optimal S doping can further push the limit of the H2 production rate up to 22.3 μmol h−1, reaching the 13.2 times higher than the bulk g-C3N4. The photocatalytic activity virtually overmatches those of a majority of the non-metal elements modified g-C3N4 photocatatlysts (Tables S2). Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity of the samples without Pt loading were also measured, as shown in Fig. S11 in the supplementary material. The samples show negligible H2 evolution ability due to the lack of the reaction sites and serious recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. These results provide the direct evidence that P or S doping derived electronic structure manipulation and nanostructure engineering with unique morphology and mesoporous structure could both contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for H2 production was measured using different wavelength band-pass filters. The AQE of 3.8 % under 420 nm monochromatic irradiation is achieved using the SCN-HMS sample (Fig. S12). The feature of stability for the photocatalyst is always one of the most important factor, which is further evaluated using SCN-HMS as an example, by both repeated cycling test and long-term continuous measurement, as shown in Fig. 4e and f, respectively. It can be observed there is no obvious decrease observed for the H2 evolution rate even after 4 cycles. Moreover, with the continuous 48 h measurement, an overall H2 generation rate of 21.6 μmol h−1 can still be maintained, suggesting the excellent stability during the photocatalytic reaction. In order to verify the chemical stability of photocatalysts, the sample after the photocatalytic reaction is recycled and then characterized by XRD (Fig. S13), FTIR (Fig. S14) and XPS (Fig. S15), respectively. Notably, there is no observable change in the structure, implying the high stability during the photocatalytic reaction, which is an important advantage for practical applications. In order to push forward the future application of photocatalysis based H2 production, searching for value added utilization of photogenerated hole by eliminating the use of sacrificing agent is necessary to enhance the conversion efficiency and economy profit. Herein, the photocatalytic performance of the SCN-HMS is evaluated by coupling H2 evolution with selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5 a. Inspiringly, the rates of H2 generation and benzaldehyde production for SCN-HMS can reach as high as 3.76 and 3.87 μmol h−1, respectively, around 4.25 and 4.67 times higher compared to bulk g-C3N4. In addition, The CN-HMS also possesses better photocatalytic performance of about 1.78 and 1.97 times compared with that of bulk g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the conversion rate and selectivity of benzyl alcohol catalytic oxidation for all samples are displayed in Fig. S16 in the Supplementary material. The SCN-HMS shows the highest selectivity of 91.5 % for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, which could be ascribed to the suitable valance band position [52]. The conversion rate of benzyl alcohol in 12 h test for bulk CN, CN-HMS and SCN-HMS are 7.5, 14.2 and 25.1 %, respectively. It can be seen that our SCN-HMS sample exhibits outstanding photocatalysis behavior as bifunctional catalysts toward H2 production and BA oxidation compared with recent literatures (Table S3). These results further confirm the significant synergistic effect of nonmetal elements doping and constructing hierarchical structures. In order to get insightful understanding on the possible origins of the enhanced photocatalytic performance, the effect of nonmetal element doping and nanostructure engineering on the electronic structure, optical properties and charge carrier dynamics is investigated based on theoretical calculation combined with experimental results. Firstly, the comparison of the charge density distributions for CN-HMS, PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS are calculated as shown in Fig. 6 a–c, respectively. Notably, more electrons are accumulated around the neighboring N atoms after P or S doping, along with significant decrease of electron density at the neighboring C atoms. This electron density redistribution could facilitate the photoexcitation process and the following photogenerated charge separation, which could significantly contribute to the photocatalytic performance [34,53]. Experimentally, the room-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results (Figs. S17b and S18b) indicate that the intensity for PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS is greatly strengthened compared to the undoped CN-HMS. This further confirms the redistribution of electrons and higher concentration of unpaired electrons due to the electron donation from the heteroatom species (P or S atoms). Additionally, the Bader charge analysis (Fig. S19) suggests that the presence of P or S dopants could result in the electronic polarization effect and the increased internal electric field [34], which would further promote the separation of the charge carriers. Secondly, the solar energy utilization efficiency of the doped samples at the 420−800 nm wavelength range can be apparently enhanced according to the comparison of the ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectra (Figs. S20 and S21) and the band gap (Eg ) analysis based on Kubelk-Munk method [54,55], which is in agreement with the DFT analysis. More importantly, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TPRL) decay curves (Fig. 6d) give the average emission lifetime (τave ) of 2.457 and 2.749 ns for PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS, respectively, which are notably longer than that of CN-HMS (2.243 ns), which is in well consistent with the PL emission spectra (Fig. S22). It is well known that the charge carrier lifetime has a vital influence on the possibility of their participation in the photocatalytic reactions, and a longer charge carrier lifetime signify a higher probability and better photocatalytic activity. To gain deeper insights into the electron-hole transfer and interfacial interactions upon doping, the transient photocurrent responses (I-t curves) with typical on-off cycles of intermittent visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) were measured (Figs. 6e and S17d, S18d). As indicated, a significantly enhanced photocurrent intensity for PCN-HMS and SCN-HMS can be observed, which is nearly four times higher than undoped sample, strongly illustrating that the light harvesting and charge carriers separation abilities are notably promoted. This could be caused by the structural defects due to the heteroatoms doping, which acts as the trapping centers for photo-generated holes and inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes, thus facilitating the effective separation and elevating the lifetime of charge carriers [56]. Furthermore, the lowered valance position of the P or S doped samples obtained from the electrochemical Mott-Schottky plot measurement (Figs. S23 and S24) could result in stronger oxidation ability, and the photo-generated holes more easily transfer from the valance band of the catalyst to the benzyl alcohol for the oxidation reaction [52], which could be critical as the high performance bifunctional catalyst. Last but not the least, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under dark condition (Figs. 6f and S17c, S18c) reveal lower charge transfer resistance and enhanced electrical conductivity, and thus promoting the mobility of the interfacial electrons. It is then safe for us to claim that the enhanced photocatalytic performance could be originated from the synergistic effect of nonmental doping induced electronic structure modulation and hierarchical mesoporous feature of the spherical morphology."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, we realize the simutaneous manipulation of nanostructure engineering and electronic modulation on graphitic carbon nitride by constructing nonmental heteroatom doped hierarchical mesoporous spheres through a facile supramolecular chemistry mediated one-pot strategy. Upon the doping level modulation, S-doped g-C3N4 hierarchical mesoporous spheres can deliver an outstanding H2 production rate of 22.3 μmol h−1 under visible-light (λ ≥ 420 nm) with TEOA as sacrificial agents, which is 13.2 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. As revealed by DFT calculations combined with experimental observations, the enhanced performance could be synergistic effect of the nonmetal element doping induced electronic modulation for more trapping centers and broader visible light absorption and nanostructure engineering derived more active sites, favorable mass-transfer process and shorter diffusion path of charge carriers. More importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of coupling photocatalytic H2 production with value-added benzyl alcohol oxidation using SCN-HMS as the bifunctional photocatalyst, which can deliver extraordinary production rates of 3.76 and 3.87 μmol h−1 for H2 and benzaldehyde generation, respectively. This work could shed new light on the rational design of high performance photocatalyst and provide a new rationale for highly efficient solar energy utilization."
