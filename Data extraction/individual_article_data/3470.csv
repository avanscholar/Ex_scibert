0,Introduction,"ε-Caprolactone (ε-CL), a crucial lactone for the preparation of increasingly popular biomedical polymers, is typically produced by Baeyer-Villiger (BV) oxidation of cyclohexanone (CYC) using different oxidizing agents such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), potassium persulfate, or hydrogen peroxide in the presence of strong acids or under metal catalysis [1–6]. Since strong oxidizing agents can present explosive hazards, and a large amount of waste acid is produced [7–9], there is a growing interest in developing greener and safer oxidants (e.g., molecular oxygen, hydrogen peroxide) for BV oxidation [10,11]. Although molecular oxygen has been successfully applied in BV oxidation with excess benzaldehyde as a sacrificial agent and 1,2-dichloroethane as solvent [12–17], large cheap benzoic acid is produced as byproduct. Recently, researchers also tried to the development of a greener catalytic system with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant, which produces water as the sole by-product [18–22]. Initially, homogeneous catalysts have been reported to catalyze BV oxidations by activating H2O2 [23,24]. Unfortunately, they are quite difficult to recover and recycle. Sn-Beta zeolites was first reported by Corma and coworkers [25], as an efficient catalyst for BV oxidation of CYC with 35% aqueous H2O2, achieving high conversion of 52% and selectivity up to 98% [26]. Nonetheless, hydrothermal synthesis of Sn-Beta requires hazardous agents (fluoride ions) and long synthesis time (up to 20 days) due to slow nucleation and crystallization process [27,28]. Industrial application of Sn-Beta will unavoidably depend on the synthesis simplicity and cost. For the last decade, most researchers focus on improving the preparation technology of Sn-Beta, more simple and scalable two-step postsynthesis method has been made to address the challenge of preparing Sn-Beta [29–31]. Nevertheless, Sn-Beta catalyzed BV oxidation in commercial H2O2 solution is still an important challenge since water negatively impacted Lewis acidity through competitive coordination to Lewis acidic centers [32], and concomitant water in the reaction system restricted the selectivity of ε-CL owing to product hydrolysis [33]. Now that the impact of water is so great, why not try to use in situ generated hydrogen peroxide (trace water) instead of commercial hydrogen peroxide solution? In addition, usually 2 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide were required [9,29], the efficiency of commercial hydrogen peroxide was generally low. Therefore, the development of green and effective system for the BV oxidation reaction is still highly required. Ishii and coworkers [34] first reported the formation of H2O2 during the aerobic oxidation of alcohols (e.g., cyclohexanol) catalyzed by N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), then BV oxidation of CYC with in situ generated H2O2 in the presence of InCl3 [35]. Ishii group [36] later used benzhydrol (BHO) instead of cyclohexanol, p-toluene sulfonic acid/NHPI as catalysts and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol (HFIP) as solvent, 83% yield of ε-CL was achieved. The byproduct benzophenone was also a valuable chemical with broad applications, and it could be easily reduced back to the BHO through catalytic hydrogenation [37]. Recently, our laboratory reported the oxidation of KA oil (mixture of CYC and cyclohexanol) to ε-CL by NHPI and cerium ammonium nitrate, using acetonitrile and HFIP as solvents, the selectivity of ε-CL was 98% with cyclohexanol conversion of 34% [38]. Our group also tried to replace cyclohexanol with BHO [39], a large amount of HFIP was still needed and the catalyst was difficult to recover in this system which resulted in its application being greatly restricted. Inspired by the approaches mentioned-above, herein, we report on a green and efficient oxidation approach that couples NHPI-catalyzed in situ H2O2 generation from BHO and O2 with Sn-Beta catalyst that utilizes the H2O2 for the BV oxidation of CYC in one pot (Scheme 1 ). High selectivity of ε-CL could be achieved under mild reaction conditions. By comparing with commercial 30 wt% aqueous H2O2 added directly, BV oxidation of CYC with in situ generated H2O2 showed excellent results and improved the efficiency of H2O2. Furthermore, the reusability of the NHPI and Sn-Beta were systematically evaluated. Also, the mechanism of the oxidation of CYC with BHO was proposed."
1,Experimental section,"Materials. H-Beta zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio = 25) was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd (China). Naphthalene (99.6%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, ε-Caprolactone (> 99.0%) was purchased from TCI. Acetonitrile, toluene, and hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (30 wt%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Other chemicals and also solvents were purchased from Energy Chemical. All chemicals were commercially available and directly used without any further purification unless indicated. Catalyst preparation. Sn-Beta zeolites was prepared via a two-step postsynthesis, similar to those reported in literatures [30,40]. Firstly, commercial H-Beta (SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio = 25) was stirred in a 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solution (20 mL gzeolite −1) at 100 °C for 20 h. After filtration and washing with deionized water, the sample was dried overnight (105 °C), the obtained sample was labelled as Si-Beta. Afterward, the Si-Beta was mixed with appropriate amount of dimethyltin dichloride and finely ground for 20 min to obtain an intimate mixture powder with the nSi/nSn ratio of 30 (Sn-Beta-30), 50 (Sn-Beta-50), 100 (Sn-Beta-100), respectively, and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for 4 h (5 °C min−1 heating ramp) to obtain Sn-Beta zeolites. Characterization. The crystalline structure of Sn-Beta zeolites was confirmed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectra were recorded against BaSO4 in the region of 200–600 nm using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The Sn content was quantified with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; SPECTRO ARCOS EOP) after digestion of the samples with HF (48%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The surface areas and pore volumes of the samples were measured by means of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K on a Quantachrome adsorption analyzer (ASIQMU01U010-6). Before the nitrogen adsorption, the samples were outgassed at 473 K for 6 h. The total surface area was calculated via the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) equation, and the pore volume was determined using the t-plot method. The measurement of hydrogen peroxide was performed according to previous paper [41]. The water content was evaluated by Karl Fischer titration (Mettler Toledo V20S). Catalytic reactions. To a 25 mL round-bottom glass flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an oxygen balloon. After the reagents were added, the glass flask was repeatedly purged with industrial oxygen (99.2%, volume fraction). The mixture was stirring of 600 rpm while the temperature was held at 75 °C. When the reaction finished, the mixture were centrifuged and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) on an Agilent 7820 A (Agilent DB-35 ms column, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm; FID detector) with naphthalene as the internal standard. GC peaks were identified by comparison with the known standard samples, and also by means of GC-MS (Agilent 7200-QTOF) analysis. The conversion of BHO and CYC, the selectivity of ε-CL and benzophenone, the yield of ε-CL and turnover number (TON) of catalysts were defined respectively as follows: (1) B H O C o n v .

2,Results and discussion,"As displayed in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information, all the samples show similar characteristic reflections of typical BEA-type structure, ruling out the obvious structural damage of zeolite framework during dealumination and Sn incorporation processes, in line with previous reports [40,42]. The dealumination and incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework of Si-Beta should be accompanied by the contraction/expansion of the framework, and result in subtle changes in the d302 spacing at 2θ = 22.5°, consistent with the findings of previous research [43]. No peaks of SnO2 were found in the diffractogram probably due to the high dispersion of Sn species. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is typically used to distinguish the coordination states of tin ions in Sn-Beta zeolites [44–46]. An intensive band around 218 nm, assigning to tetrahedral coordinated Sn sites in the framework (Fig. S2) [47,48], was clearly observed. What's more, as the tin content in Sn-Beta zeolites increased (Fig. S3), the intensity of this band also increased simultaneously, but a broad absorption from 250 nm to 290 nm was found when Si/Sn = 30, which was similar to that of bulk SnO2 [31,49]. It was demonstrated that the extra-framework tin species was formed and increased with the increasing tin content in the Sn-Beta zeolites. The microporous BEA structure was corroborated by the nitrogen physisorption (Fig. S4), in which typical type I adsorption/desorption isotherms can be observed for all samples. The textural properties of the samples were listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The surface area and micropore volume of the Sn-Beta-50 samples were 609 m2 g–1 and 0.19 cm3 g−1, which was very similar to that of H-Beta, implying that almost all of the Sn atoms were tetrahedrally incorporated into the Si-Beta framework, which was in good agreement with the UV–Vis analysis results. Note that the surface area and micropore volume of Si-Beta samples were slightly larger than that of H-Beta because of the formation of vacant nests via dealumination. Hereto, Sn-Beta was successfully synthesized via a two-step postsynthesis method. Table 1 presents the results for BV oxidation of CYC with in situ H2O2 generated from BHO and molecular oxygen in one-pot. A blank experiment was carried out under the same conditions without catalysts, both BHO and CYC were not converted (entry 1). It should be noted that, the selectivity of benzophenone was up to 99% for all the tested catalysts, thus they were not shown. Without NHPI (entry 2), BHO could not convert into benzophenone and H2O2, when the amount of NHPI increased from 5% to 13.3% (entries 3,4,5), the conversion of BHO increased sharply from 78.6% to 100%, leading to produce more hydrogen peroxide. Meanwhile, the conversion of CYC also increased from 34.3 to 45.7%, and the selectivity of ε-CL maintained above 86%. With further increase in the amount of NHPI (entry 6), the conversion of BHO and CYC did not change significantly, so the optimum amount of NHPI was 10 mol% in this case. Lewis acid Sn in the beta zeolite played a crucial role in advancing the BV oxidation [25,50]. In the absence of Sn-Beta-50 (entry 7), CYC was hardly converted to ε-CL, and the conversion of CYC improved observably with the increase of Sn-Beta amount (entries 4,9–11), but the selectivity of ε-CL decreased slightly. In addition, it could be clearly found that the addition of CYC in the system was beneficial to the conversion of BHO (entries 7,8). Moreover, the effect of the ratio of BHO to CYC on the BV oxidation had also been examined (entries 12–14). It should be noted that conversion of one equivalent CYC theoretically requires one equivalent hydrogen peroxide. When the mole ratio of in situ H2O2 to CYC was 0.47, the selectivity of ε-CL reached 94.7% with 31% conversion of CYC, and the efficiency of BHO (based on the definition of ε-CL production amount/BHO consumption) was up to 61.8% which was superior to former reported strategy (52% efficiency of BHO) [46]. However, as the initial amount of BHO increases, the efficiency of BHO and selectivity of ε-CL both decreased. This result could be explained as the in situ generated H2O2 could not be timely used by the insufficient CYC, and the higher amount of in situ generated H2O2 decomposed into water, causing the hydrolysis of ε-CL to 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid in the process of time [38,51]. Hence it was significant to keep an adequate ratio of CYC to BHO, and excess BHO not only led to poor selectivity of ε-CL, but also led to low efficient use of BHO. The influence of tin content on the catalytic performances of BV oxidation were also tested (Fig. 1 ). Noticeably, 91% selectivity of ε-CL was obtained over Sn-Beta-100, which was higher than Sn-Beta-30. Sn-Beta-100 also showed a higher TON value of 200 mol (Sn·mol)−1 than Sn-Beta-30, in no small part because tin ions tetrahedrally coordinated in the framework are the active sites for BV oxidation while those in the extra-framework positions have a proven deleterious effect on the catalytic performances of Sn-Beta [26,30,52]. However, the conversion of CYC over Sn-Beta-100 was only 39.1%. In this condition, the conversion of CYC is 45.5% , and the selectivity and yield of ε-CL were 86.9% and 39.5% over Sn-Beta-50. The content of Sn in Beta zeolite needs to be further optimized. Compared with Sn-Beta-30 and Sn-Beta-100, the Sn-Beta-50 showed higher yield of ε-CL, so Sn-Beta-50 was chosen as the catalyst. The choice of solvent is very important because the oxidation reactions were carried out in a triphasic system with one liquid phase consisting of CYC, BHO, and solvent; one solid phase of Sn-Beta; and one gas phase of oxygen. The effect of several different solvents was examined, and the results were shown in Table 2 . Although the acetonitrile was reported as a favorable solvent for the aerobic oxidation of BHO [34,36], its selectivity of BV product was quite poor in this reaction (entry 1). Among the solvents studied, the aerobic oxidation proceeded smoothly in dioxane (entry 2). Compared with chlorobenzene (Entry 4), fluorobenzene gave an unexpected result which 99% selectivity of ε-CL was obtained while 29.4% of CYC was converted (entry 3), this may be due to the electronegativity of fluorine was stronger than chlorine, favoring the formation of the hydrogen bonds between water molecules and fluorobenzene [53]. Whereas fluorobenzene was not beneficial to BHO conversion. However, the BV oxidation was inhibited in toluene (Entry 5). It may relate to the difficulty in generating intermediates in toluene. Other solvents, methyl benzoate, isopropyl acetate and tert-butanol behaved as unfavorable solvents under our study (entries 6–8). Considering the environment problems and reaction performance, dioxane was chosen as the optimal solvent, and the roles of different solvents in the oxidation reaction still need to be studied further. The effect of reaction temperature, varied in the range of 65–90 °C, on the aerobic oxidation of BHO with CYC was investigated when the reaction time was maintained at 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the conversion of BHO and CYC increased along with the increase of temperature, while the selectivity of ε-CL was less than 84% when the temperature rose to 80 °C. The byproduct had been analyzed by GC-MS, and it was mainly 6-hydroxycaproic acid. This result may be possibly attributed to the in situ generated H2O2 decomposes easily at higher temperature, leading to accelerated hydrolysis of ε-CL [54]. The effect of reaction time was also studied (Fig. 2b). With the increase of the reaction time from 3 to 15 h, the BHO conversion and CYC conversion were remarkably increased from 57.1% to 99% and 19.4% to 48.9%, respectively. However, the selectivity of ε-CL decreased gradually from 97.2% to 84.2%, and this might be caused by ε-CL continuously hydrolyzes in water. After extending the reaction time to 24 h, the 54% conversion of CYC and 82.7% selectivity to ε-CL could be obtained, and BHO was consumed completely. Several cyclic ketones were subjected to the reaction system to test the scope of this reaction (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). For cyclopentanone, as the strained ring greatly facilitated the key rearrangement process [39], only 22.6% conversion to δ-valerolactone, with 98.5% selectivity (entry 1). The methyl group on the cyclohexanone slightly improved the selectivity of lactones (entries 3,4), however, it inhibited the oxidation of BHO. The 2-adamantanone was also examined (entry 5), the conversion of 2-adamantanone and the selectivity to corresponding lactone were 21.8% and 99%, respectively. Tremendous efforts have been made to improve the selectivity of ε-CL by changing the preparation method of Sn-Beta catalyst [56,57]. However, usually 1–2 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide was required, the utilization efficiency of commercial hydrogen peroxide was generally low (Table 3 , entries 1–5). To our knowledge, this is the first study on BV oxidation of CYC with in situ generated hydrogen peroxide over Sn-Beta zeolites. Consequently, it is necessary to compare it with commercial hydrogen peroxide added directly, and the results were listed in Table 3. First, commercial 30% aqueous H2O2 (0.75 equiv.) have been used in the BV oxidation of CYC at 90 °C for 2 h (the water content of the reaction solution was 2.06%), giving an unsatisfactory result with 65% selectivity (entry 6). The transformation of CYC was enhanced (entry 7), but the selectivity of ε-CL dropped to 60.5% when the reaction time prolonged to 3 h. To compare with commercial H2O2 added directly, the reaction was proceed in two steps (one-pot). In the 1st step, aerobic oxidation of BHO at 75 °C for 8 h to obtain in situ H2O2 (the water content of the reaction solution was 0.23%); In the 2nd step, CYC and Sn-Beta were added and the reaction temperature was raised to 90 °C and stirred under oxygen. In this way, high selectivity of ε-CL (94.8%) was obtained while 39.2% of CYC was converted, the conversion of BHO is 96.2% (the amount of in situ H2O2 is 0.72 equiv.), and the efficiency of in situ H2O2 was up to 51.5% (entry 8), which was not only higher than commercial H2O2 added directly (entries 6,7), but also higher than several reported value using Sn-Beta as catalyst (entries 1–5). This might have been due to the in situ H2O2 has lower water content. In addition, it should be noted that the Sn-Beta prepared by different methods are quite different. Compared with the Sn-Beta synthesized by postsynthesis method (entries 2,3), the Sn-Beta prepared by hydrothermal method showed higher selectivity and activity (entries 1,4), which might be due to the Sn-Beta (prepared by hydrothermal method) is not sensitive to water [26,27]. It was quite difficult to employ exactly the same conditions for the two sets of experiments since the in situ generated H2O2 may decomposed during the aerobic oxidation of BHO. Accordingly, we tried to change the reaction temperature (entry 9) and time (entry 10) in the 2nd step, the in situ generated H2O2 still showed significantly more efficient than commercial 30% aqueous H2O2. Interestingly, by comparing with one-step process (Table 1, entry 4), the two-step method has noticeably improved the selectivity of ε-CL, which might be attributable to the two-step method reduced the time of BV oxidation reaction and decreased the hydrolysis of ε-CL in a way. The achieved results indicated that the in situ H2O2 was a key factor in improving the selectivity of ε-CL and the efficiency of H2O2. To further demonstrate the preponderance of in situ H2O2, different concentrations of aqueous H2O2 were added to the reaction solution, while keeping the moles of H2O2 constant. The different concentrations of aqueous H2O2 (10 wt% and 20 wt%) were obtained by adding pure water to the 30 wt% aqueous H2O2. As can be seen from Table 4 , with the increase of additional H2O2 concentration (entries 1–3), the conversion of cyclohexanone increased, but the selectivity of ε-CL decreased gradually. This may be due to the low concentration of hydrogen peroxide has high water content. It was generally accepted that water negatively impacted Lewis acidity through active site blocking [20]. In addition, NHPI, AIBN or benzophenone has been added to the reaction solution separately. Interestingly, conversion and selectivity values are similar for the different reactions (entries 4–7), which indicates that NHPI, AIBN and benzophenone have no effect on the BV oxidation of CYC with H2O2. The recoverability and stability of Sn-Beta were studied, which is a critical parameter for catalyst as potential candidate for chemical industry in future [58,59]. As the amount of catalyst needed was small, the amount of substrates was quadrupled, and the reaction was carried out in a 100 mL round-bottom glass, and the results were shown in Fig. 3 . After each run, the Sn-Beta was recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration, and washed three times with dioxane, then dried in vacuum at 80–90 °C for 6 h, and reused for next reactions. Since Sn-Beta lost between runs is unavoidable, there was a slight decrease in the catalyst performance. At the end of run 5, the conversion of CYC was 41% compared to 46% in run 1, and the selectivity of ε-CL still remained over 85%. This is mainly due to the good stability of Sn-Beta-50. In addition, the stability and recyclability of NHPI were also investigated. Thanks to the boiling points of the substances differ greatly, the different components could be separated by vacuum distillation at lower temperature. The solvent and unreacted CYC were separated and recovered from mother liquors. Besides that, these compounds in the solution could be dissolved in toluene except NHPI. Luckily, the NHPI was recovered by centrifugation after the crystallization, as detailed in the Supporting Information, and the results were displayed in Table S3. This reaction was carried out on a gram-scale to demonstrate applicability (entry 1), the conversion of BHO was slightly lower than that of before, probably due to the mass transfer limitation of oxygen, and the recovery rate of NHPI was 64.2%. Data also showed that the reactivity of the reused NHPI remained almost unchange (Table S3, entries 2,3), indicating that the NHPI has a good stability in this way. However, the recovery rate of NHPI was not high enough. Further increase the recovery rate of NHPI are currently ongoing. Based on the control experiment and published literature [25,34,35], a possible reaction mechanism for BV oxidation of CYC with in situ H2O2 is shown in Scheme 2 . In the first place, phthalimide-N-oxyl (PINO) radical, generated from the reaction of NHPI with AIBN, subsequently abstracted a hydrogen atom from the BHO to produce the radical and regenerated the NHPI. Then this radical was in turn adducted by dioxygen to generate peroxide species, which decomposed into benzophenone and hydroperoxyl radical. Next, the hydroperoxyl radical abstracted hydrogen from NHPI or a molecule of BHO to form hydrogen peroxide and 1-hydroxy-1,1-diphenylmethyl radical or PINO radical quickly as suggested by other groups [60,61]. The byproduct benzophenone could be reduced back to the BHO through catalytic hydrogenation if need be [31]. In the second step, the CYC is coordinated to the Lewis acid tin center, thereby activating the carbonyl group, in situ H2O2 subsequently attacked the carbonyl group of CYC to generate the Criegee intermediate [62]. After rearrangement, a lactone was obtained. This mechanism was similar to that for peracids, which Corma's group [25,26,63] had confirmed by means of an 18O labeling experiment, GC-MS, in situ infrared spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations."
3,Conclusions,"In summary, an excellent selectivity, one-pot, environmentally responsible synthesis of ε-CL, a widely used lactone, has been realized. Using clean and cheap of dioxygen as the terminal oxidant, commercially available NHPI and Sn-Beta as catalysts, H2O2 was formed in situ from BHO, which subsequently oxidized the CYC to ε-CL with high efficiency of H2O2. The in situ H2O2 played a vital role in improving the selectivity of ε-CL and the efficiency of H2O2. Moreover, the Sn-Beta and NHPI were successfully recycled. They could be reused easily, and retained highly stable. The byproduct benzophenone was valuable and useful industrial chemicals, and it also could be reduced back to the BHO through the hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, this work provides a new facile and green method for producing ε-CL using in situ hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, even for the synthesis of other lactones."
