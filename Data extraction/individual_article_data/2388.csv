0,Introduction,"In order to produce H2 efficiently using solar energy, one of the key points is to develop catalytic materials with good visible-light response. Metal sulfide systems with small band-gaps have been proven to be active photocatalysts for water-splitting reaction under visible light [1–3]. In particular, CdS has been intensely studied because of its narrow band gap (2.4 eV) and suitable conduction band potential [4–7]. However, CdS itself exhibits quite low photocatalytic ability, so modification with guest substances is normally required for catalysis enhancement. One of the strategies is the incorporation of Zn2+ into the structure, where the potentials of conduction and valence bands can be regulated by simply adjusting the Cd/Zn stoichiometry ratio [8–13]. Another strategy is to modify the CdS surface with co-catalysts, normally noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) [14,15]. The role of noble co-catalysts is to promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by forming Schottky junctions and to lower activation potentials for H2 evolution [16]. Although noble metals can significantly speed up the photocatalytic reaction rate, the higher cost greatly limits their practical applications in large scale. The practical applications of photocatalysis are limited because of at least two obvious problems arising from using fine photocatalytic powders: (1) separation of fine particles used after the treatment process and the recycling of the photocatalyst; (2) low photoefficiency. Many techniques were proposed for the preparation of fixed photocatalytic systems to eliminate the first problem [17,18]. In order to improve the photocatalytic activity of fine (CdS + ZnS) powders, many attempts were reported [19–21]. Several efficient heterostructures for photocatalytic hydrogen production are illuminated based on different electron transfer mechanisms [22–28]. For example, CdS/ZnS heterostructures show a superior hydrogen evolution rate to single CdS or ZnS due to the efficient electron transfer from CdS conduction band (CB) to ZnS CB and the wide light absorption of CdS itself [24]. To keep electron/hole with stronger redox capability on different reaction parts, the heterostructures based on indirect Z-scheme with redox mediators in solution or all solid state Z-scheme with vectorial electron transfer were also constructed [26–28]. Recently, ZnO–CdS heterostructure photocatalyst based on direct Z-scheme mechanism exhibits wide light response and high hydrogen evolution by prolonging lifetime of charge carriers was demonstrated [22]. The key of the direct Z-scheme mechanism is that the holes with high oxidative power and electrons with high reductive power can be remained on different semiconductor parts by the direct recombination of low oxidative holes and low reductive electrons at the interface of heterostructures. For heterostructured photocatalysts, besides the mechanisms of charge carrier transfer, two more aspects can also play key roles in determining overall photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate, in particular for long-term applications. One is the stability of semiconductor units in heterostructures upon light irradiation [29]. Compared with other reports, the prime novelties of this work are (1) coating photoactive CdS and ZnS onto magnetic Fe2O3 core to prepare a magnetic photocatalysts (after photodegradation, the magnetic composites can be separated from the medium by a simple magnetic process), and (2) the photocatalyst can be reused easily."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation 2.1.1 Synthesis of Cadmium and Zinc Sulfide nano particles Cadmium and Zinc Sulfide nano particles was prepared by adding sodium sulfide solution drop by drop to cadmium and zinc acetate solutions mixed in 500 mL distilled water. The solution was kept under stirring condition. After 1 h, a yellow and white precipitate was formed for cadmium and zinc sulfide solutions. After 24 h the solution was removed from stirring condition and washed with isopropyl alcohol and water to avoid agglomeration of particles. The precipitate was allowed to settle and dried in an oven for 12 h at 90 °C. Similar procedure was used for the preparation of (CdS + ZnS) nano particles. 2.1.2 Synthesis of Fe2O3 nano particles An aqueous solution of PVA (10 wt%) was prepared in hot water. Ferric nitrate (0.1 mol) was dissolved in 150 ml of distilled water. These two solutions were mixed and stirred vigorously using a magnetic stirrer. An aqueous solution of sucrose (10 wt% of sucrose with respect to PVA) was added to this mixture and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. It was dried on a hot plate at ∼125 °C [30], a dark brown colored fluffy precursor obtained. 2.1.3 Synthesis of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 nano particles 50 mg of the synthesized Fe2O3 were dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water with the assistance of ultrasonication for 30 min. The sonicated Fe2O3 particles were added to the 500 mL distilled water and then appropriate quantities of NaOH (0.1 M) solution were added to adjust the pH value to 11.0. Then few drops of Cadmium acetate and then Zinc acetate were added to that distilled water containing Fe2O3 nano particles. Then mixed solution was continuously stirred and sodium sulfide solution was added drop by drop. After 24 h, the as-prepared products were washed repeatedly with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol for several times and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 6 h. Similar procedure was carried out for the preparation of both CdS/Fe2O3 and ZnS/Fe2O3."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Shimadzu XD-D1 diffractometer using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation). The morphology and particle size were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-3400N, Tokyo, Japan). Elemental analysis was characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Thermo US Northern System). The band gap was calculated by UV-Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy."
4,Recovery of H2 from H2S,2.3 Recovery of H2 from H2S The cylindrical photocatalytic reactor [31] of 500 ml capacity was irradiated using a pen type halogen lamp. The reactor carried two ports: one of the ports was meant for purging of nitrogen (N2) gas and the other to collect H2 gas by downward displacement of water. The evolved hydrogen was collected by GC (Shimadzu - GC 2014ATF: 6890N). The volume of Hydrogen was measured at every 15 min interval. Similar experiments were also conducted in the presence and absence of light for each catalyst in order to confirm the effect of light.
5,Result and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization To obtain information on the crystal structure of the iron oxide core shell nano particles, X-ray diffraction patterns were measured. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of prepared iron oxide core shell nano particles. Fig. 1(g) shows XRD pattern of the Fe2O3 core shell nano particles, presenting the characteristic peaks. It can also be seen from Fig. 1(a, b, c, d, e, f and g), where the Fe2O3 was completely coated by CdS and ZnS nano particles. The particle size of the core shell particles CdS, ZnS, ZnS/Fe2O3, CdS/Fe2O3, (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3, (CdS + ZnS) and Fe2O3 were 16.5, 20, 14, 12.8, 9.8, 10.6 and 17.8 respectively. The core shell particles CdS–ZnS/Fe2O3 was found to be smaller than the other core shell (ZnS/Fe2O3, CdS/Fe2O3) and coreless ((CdS + ZnS), CdS, ZnS and Fe2O3) nano particles. Similarly, Shi et al. [32], coated Ce doped TiO2 in Fe3O4 nano particles. Formation of core–shell is verified by the complete absence of reflections due to Fe2O3 in all the other spectra. The spectra of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 and (CdS + ZnS) showed reflections same as that of CdS. It is a strong evidence for isomorphic substitution of Zn in the lattice of CdS. As the spectra of e and f are similar, the core is verified to have no influence on the isomorphic substitution. In addition absence of any interaction between core and shell is also verified from the spectra. There might be dipole–dipole forces, but they might not be significant enough to alter the spectral characteristics. Except the spectrum of Fe2O3 in all the others peaks were broadened confirming their nano dimensions. HRTEM micrograph of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The coating of CdS + ZnS nano particles on the surface of the magnetite particles resulted in the formation of a core–shell type structure, in which most magnetite particles as the core and the CdS + ZnS as the shell. And the magnetite particles prepared by chemical co-precipitation method were coated very well by the (CdS + ZnS) layer, so the magnetite particles would not undergo aggregation. Fig. 2(b), shows (CdS + ZnS) particle alone. We have coated several combination of ZnS and CdS in Fe2O3, however HRTEM taken only for (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 (since maximum hydrogen production was found with (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 nano particles). The layered structure of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 are well characterized in Fig. 2(c). It is shown that iron particles in the center, and the cadmium and zinc layer (photoactive shell) on the most outer surface in (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3. The FTIR spectrum of CdS, ZnS and Fe2O3 particles are shown in Fig. 3 . The intense peaks close to 600 cm−1 might be assigned to CdS and ZnS vibrations [33,34]. Fe2O3 vibration close to 700 cm−1 and the peak below 1000 cm−1 might include Fe2O3, CdS and ZnS vibrations. UV–vis absorption spectra are used to characterize the light absorption ability of the prepared photocatalysts. Fig. 4 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra, it depicts the influence of ZnS, CdS and combination of both coated in Fe2O3 on the UV–vis absorption. It is noticeable that a light absorption in the visible region is higher than that of ZnS and the light absorption was found to be increased when the individual nano particles were coated in Fe2O3 (viz., CdS/Fe2O3, ZnS/Fe2O3) and (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3. Since Fe2O3 has maximum absorbance in visible region. As a result, the ZnS and CdS coated nano particles surrounding the Fe2O3 grains can absorb a larger range of light radiation and increase the visible light absorption ability of the photocatalysts. Fig. 5 illustrates the morphology of prepared core shell nano particles. The crystals were plate type with different sizes. Each plate should compose of nano particles. Both CdS and ZnS nano particles exhibited similar morphology of crystals which was proved in XRD. The morphology of Fe2O3 is different from CdS and ZnS nano particles. Isomorphic substitution of either Zn or Cd in Fe2O3 was not evident from (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3. The SEM image of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 were spherical particles of irregular aggregates with pores. This morphology was entirely different from that of CdS and ZnS nano particles. The elemental composition was reported in Fig. 6 for (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core shell nano particles. The added elemental composition (during the preparation of the photocatalysts) was matching with the composition of elements analyzed.

7,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production Photocatalytic H2 evolution of iron oxide core–shell particles (see Fig. 7 ) was conducted in an aqueous solution containing SO3 2− and S2− ions as sacrificial reagents under simulated light irradiation. The activity of CdS, ZnS, (CdS + ZnS), Fe2O3 coreless nano particles and CdS/Fe2O3, ZnS/Fe2O3, (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core shell nano particles were tested for hydrogen production. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core–shell particle shows comparatively good hydrogen production of 36 mL, which is 12 times higher than that of Fe2O3 nano particles. The activity of all the above photocatalysts were tested for three times for accuracy and all the time (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 gives maximum hydrogen production. Therefore (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 was selected for further studies to test the hydrogen production efficiency. According to Fig. 8 , with an increase in the concentration of sulfide ion, the hydrogen production increased and reached a maximum at 0.2 M. Further increase in concentration of sulfide ion led to a decrease in hydrogen production. Beyond the optimum absorbed sulfide ions was increased and block the active sites of the photocatalysts. Sulfide and sulfite ions behaved as quenching agents of ions and radicals [35]. The volume of hydrogen production decreased with the increase in sulfite ion concentration (Fig. 9 ). It was due to the competitive absorption of SO3 2− and S2O3 2− on the active sites of the photocatalyst [36]. The competitive adsorption processes thus led to inhibition of the rate by theses species. Fig. 10 shows the effect of pH in hydrogen production. From pH 8 to 11 an increase in H2 production was noted. It was due to the increase in the dissociation of HS− to S2−. At pH 12, the H2 production decreased. It was due to the increased OH- ion concentration which apparently acts as an intermediate of the photocatalytic reduction process. When the hydroxide ions concentration becomes too high, apparently, many photogenerated hydrogen ions interacted with hydroxide ions producing water [37]. Moreover Bao et al. [4], reported a decrease in H2 production in higher pH was due to hydrolysis of SO3 2− and S2−. The effect of the concentration of synthesized core shell nano particles (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 on the photocatalytic hydrogen generation was investigated in the range of 0–1 g/L by varying the amount of photocatalyst added to the reactor containing aqueous 0.2 M Na2S and 0.2 M Na2SO3 solutions (without pH adjustment). Fig. 11 illustrated the photocatalytic H2 production as a function of photocatalytic concentration. The photocatalytic generation of H2 increased with the increase in concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 g/L. It was due to the increase in number of active sites in the added photocatalyst. Further increase in concentration from 0.6 to 1 g/L, the production of H2 decreased. Consequently, it reduced the light absorption of inner particles of the solution and it reduced the production of H2 [38–41]. An optimum photocatalyst concentration also greatly depends on the photo reactor, degree of mixing, lamp power and lamp geometry. The optimum amount of photocatalyst was added to the reactor to improve the photocatalytic H2 production. The effect of light intensity on H2 production is presented in Fig. 12 . Three tungsten halogen (visible) lamps of intensity 47, 96 and 219 W/m2 were used for light intensity studies. With the increase in the intensity, the H2 production enhanced from 1339 to 4129 μmol. It was due to the fact that with an increase in intensity of light, large number of e−/h+ pairs might be generated. Thus, more e− might be available for reducing the H+ ions and hence, the higher the rate of photocatalytic production of H2 [38,41,42]. Photocatalytic stability is a main bottleneck in the development of sulfide based photocatalysts for photolytic hydrogen evolution. To estimate the photocatalytic stability of the (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core–shell nano particles, the time courses of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the (CdS + ZnS) coreless nano particles were conducted and are shown in Fig. 13 . No noticeable decrease in photocatalytic H2 evolution was observed in three repeated runs for the photocatalytic reaction. which suggests a good anti-photocorrosion capability of our developed (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core–shell nano particles. The total H2 evolution after 6 h reaction was 4353 μmol/0.5 g. For the (CdS + ZnS) coreless nano particles, the total H2 evolution reached up to 1956 μmol/0.5 g for 6 h. Therefore the prepared (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core–shell nano particles was found to stable. The reusability of the catalysts is an important factor for industrial applications. Hence the reusability of (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 were studied and the results are illustrated in Fig. 14 . The photocatalyst was continuously reused for 14 runs. For each consequent trial, the iron oxide core shell particle was recovered using external magnetic bar. The photocatalyst was reactivated by washing with distilled water. The coreless (CdS + ZnS) were recovered by gravimetric method and its reusability was also tested. It was found that the (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 nano particles were more stable than the (CdS + ZnS) nano particles. After 8th run, the photocatalytic hydrogen production reduced due to absorbed species on the active sites of the catalyst surface and combined with a small quantity of photocorrosion in the photocatalysts due to prolonged use [43]. This suggests that fresh photocatalyst loading might be required to compensate the loss after 8th run. This result indicated that the (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 photocatalyst was fairly photostable for practical application."
8,Conclusions,"The CdS, ZnS, (CdS + ZnS), Fe2O3 nano particles and CdS/Fe2O3, ZnS/Fe2O3, (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core shell nano particles were successfully prepared by co-precipitation method and their activity were tested for hydrogen production. No noticeable decrease in photocatalytic H2 evolution was observed in three repeated runs for the photocatalytic reaction. It was found that the (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core shell nano particles were more stable than the (CdS + ZnS) coreless nano particles. The prepared novel photocatalysts was attributed to contribute high and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution in a long-term reaction. The maximum hydrogen production was observed with (CdS + ZnS)/Fe2O3 core shell nano particles of 4129 μmol, giving rise to a quantum efficiency of 19% at 510 nm."
