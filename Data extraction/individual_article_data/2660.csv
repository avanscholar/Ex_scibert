0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass can play a significant role in the development of a sustainable economy as a renewable carbon resource. It is a quite abundant renewable feedstock, produced largely as a residue in different agroindustrial sectors. Lignocellulose is essentially composed of polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicelluloses) and lignin. Its fractionation is the starting point for upgrading the chemical platform molecules derived thereof to biofuel and high value commodity chemicals. Amongst the sugars released from polysaccharide hydrolysis, hexoses have been intensively exploited for the production of second generation ethanol. Hemicellulose-derived pentoses, on the other hand, may potentially be used to produce green chemicals, especially furanic compounds. Furfural, furfuryl alcohol, furan and 2-methyl furan draw more attention due to their potential industrial application as solvent [1], biofuel additives [2,3] or chemical intermediates [4–6]. Furfuryl alcohol has gaining increasing interest due to its use in polymer manufacture and as an intermediate for levulinic acid production [6]. This furanic alcohol is industrially produced via hydrogenation of furfural, which is obtained through cyclodehydration of xylose, one of the main monosaccharide moieties in hemicellulosic fraction of biomass. This multi-step process relies on the use of homogeneous catalysts to promote pentose dehydration [7], and a chromium-base catalyst for the hydrogenation step [8]. Either catalytic route presents major economical, environmental and safety drawbacks. The use of homogeneous catalysts requires post-treatments to recover a pure end product and mitigate the impact of process effluents and corrosion-related issues in industrial facilities. With regard to the transition metal catalyst, the well-known toxicity of chromium embodies a potential hazard to health and environment. Therefore novel green environmentally friendly processes are demanded, which may still proceed through multiple sequential stages on alternative heterogeneous catalytic systems or via a single-step reaction straight from xylose over multifunctional catalysts. Many efforts to replace stoichiometric mineral acids with solid acid catalysts have been extensively reported in the literature over the last years. Polymeric resins [9], heteropolyacids [10,11], zeolites and mesoporous molecular sieves [12–15], 1D nanostructures as well as functionalized or single metal oxides [16–20] can be listed among the investigated systems. It has been learned that the presence of both Lewis and Brönsted acidity render more active catalysts to promote xylose dehydration to furfural [21]. Some authors have argued that Lewis acid sites are responsible for xylose isomerization to xylulose while Brönsted centers catalyze xylulose dehydration, which is kinetically more favorable than from its parent aldopentose [7]. As concerning furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol, most studies focus on the use of noble metal catalysts [22–26] or supported nickel systems [27]. The stability of nickel and other transition metal against leaching in aqueous-phase hydrogenation still demands some careful attention though. Regardless the pertinent on-going investigation on both approaches in the search for more sustainable processes, they must all be arranged in a multi-step strategy to produce furfuryl alcohol. It was only recently that we first reported an innovative one-pot process to produce furfuryl alcohol from xylose on a dual acid/metal catalytic system composed of a solid acid (sulfated zirconia) and a noble metal catalyst (Pt/SiO2) [28]. Selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol reached 55% and it was found to be affected by the water/isopropanol ratio used as solvent. A continuous fixed-bed reactor system operating with a combination of Hβ zeolite and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 in a mixture of γ-butyrolactone/water as solvent has also been shown to be efficient in one-pot conversion of xylose [29]. The authors were also able to tune furfuryl alcohol yield by adjusting the relative amount of acid and metal catalysts settled as a double bed in the reactor. Despite the remarkable selectivities accomplished straight from xylose, either in a batch [28] or flow reactor [29] system, product formation relies on the reaction dynamics since acid and metal sites resides on different surfaces. As long as a batch reactor is used, formation of different products depends on the kinetics of each separate reaction step and also on which site the monosaccharide molecule would meet first and adsorb on in the aqueous reaction medium. Disposing both types of active sites (acid and metal) on the same surface may disturb the intermediate reaction pathways and tailor a different product distribution. In this present contribution, the behavior of a single multifunctional catalyst based on sulfated zirconia is investigated on one-step production of furfuryl alcohol from xylose. It aims at assessing the impact of the arrangement of both acid and metal sites on the same catalyst surface. In this approach, the chemical nature of those sites was the same as those used in our previous study [28] in order to allow a more systematic discussion on the catalyst architecture."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation A commercially available sulfated zirconium hydroxide from Mel Chemicals (ref. XZO 1249) was used to prepare the sulfated zirconia (ZrO2-SO4) taken as catalyst support in this study. The sulfated oxide samples was obtained by calcination in a muffle at 600°C for 4h following a linear rate of 10°C/min during heating. Metal catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥37.50%Pt basis) in order to obtain a Pt nominal content of 1 wt.%. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried overnight at 120°C and finally calcined at 500°C for 4h under synthetic air (50 mL/min). Temperature raise upon calcination followed a linear rate of 10°C/min."
3,Physicochemical characterization,"2.2 Physicochemical characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed in a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with CuKα radiation (1.540Å), operating at 40KV and 30mA. The diffractograms were obtained in 2θ ranging from 10° to 90° with steps of 0.05°/s. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were collected at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. Specific surface area was calculated by B.E.T. equation. Before analysis, samples were thermally treated at 350°C under vacuum for 12h. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was used to estimate chemical composition in S8 Tiger Bruker spectrometer with a rhodium source and a collimator grouped to a LiF window. Total amount of sulfur was measured and then converted to sulfate basis. Acidity was assessed by infrared spectroscopy using pyridine as probe molecule in a homemade glass cell. Catalyst self-supported wafers (diameter of 13mm) were treated at different temperatures, submitted to high vacuum for 30min and then cooled down to room temperature. Pyridine was then adsorbed at 2Torr for 1h and the cell was finally evacuated. Spectra were collected in a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer from Thermo Electron Corporation with 256 scans and a 4cm−1 resolution. Absorption bands related to pyridine 19b vibrational modes corresponding to Lewis (1450cm−1) and Brönsted (1540cm−1) acid sites were taken to determine L/B ratio and the acid sites total concentration. Molar extinction coefficients were considered for quantitative calculations [28]. Pt dispersion was calculated via cyclohexane dehydrogenation according to the procedure detailed described elsewhere [30,31]. Briefly, Pt/ZrO2-SO4 was reduced for 1h in a tubular reactor under a pure hydrogen flow at 50 mL/min. Different reduction temperatures (200, 350 and 500°C) were used in order to vary metal dispersion and thus obtain catalysts with distinct acid/metal ratios. Afterwards, a hydrogen/cyclohexane stream was introduced into the reactor with the aid of a saturator set at 12°C to establish a H2/C6H12 ratio of 13.2. Reaction rates were determined at 270°C under differential conditions, i.e., cyclohexane conversion was always below 15%. Conversion and production of benzene were followed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 6890 equipment coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and equipped with a HP Plot Al2O3/KCl column operating at 70°C. Injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 150°C and 200°C, respectively. Calibration curves were taken for the quantitative determination of cyclohexane (retention time=5.5min) and benzene (retention time=7.6min). Reaction rates were directly correlated to Pt surface area by using a reference Pt/ZrO2 sample previously analyzed by hydrogen chemisorption [31]."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation All reactions were performed in the liquid phase in a semi-batch stainless steel Parr-type reactor. Catalytic runs were performed with a xylose (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) water:isopropanol 1:1 solution at 83mmol/L, 130°C and constant agitation of 600rpm. Hydrogen was admitted into the reactor and the total pressure was kept constant at 3MPa along the whole experiment. Different catalyst masses were taken in the preliminary tests to evaluate reaction conditions and ensure kinetic control. Before reaction, catalyst was previously reduced following the same above-described procedure used for determining Pt surface area. Distinct reduction temperatures (200, 350 and 500°C) allowed to reach catalytic system with distinctive acid/metal ratios. The overall conversion, selectivity and yield of the products were calculated on a molar basis as follows: C o n v e r s i o n o f x y l o s e ( X x y l ) = [ x y l o s e ] i − [ x y l o s e ] f [ x y l o s e ] i × 100 Selectivity ( S ) = [ product ] [ x y l o s e ] i − [ x y l o s e ] f × 100 Yield ( Y ) = [ product ] [ x y l o s e ] i × 100 All reactions were monitored for 6h and samples were periodically taken to be analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Initially, liquid aliquots were filtered with a polyethylene 0.22μm filter and then analyzed on a Waters Alliance e2695 equipment coupled to a photodiode array detector (PDA) and a refractive index detector (RID), which was kept at 50°C. A Biorad Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange column operating at 65°C was used to separate all products. An aqueous solution of H2SO4 at 5mmol/L was applied as mobile phase in isocratic elution mode with a flow of 0.7mL/min. Calibration curves were taken for the quantitative determination of xylose (retention time=8.5min), xylulose (retention time=8.9min), xylitol (retention time=9.8min), furfuryl alcohol (retention time=10.6min), glycerol (retention time=11.7min), ethylene glycol (retention time=14.1min), acetol (retention time=14.6min) and furfural (retention time=38.4min). Furfural was analyzed at 280nm."
5,Results and discussion,"A standard characterization of ZrO2-SO4 prepared from a commercial sulfated zirconium hydroxide was initially performed in order to well describe its most important properties. The main diffraction lines registered in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1 A) correspond to a zirconia with tetragonal structure (JCPDS 17-0923). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms are presented in Fig. 1B. A type IV isotherm is observed according to IUPAC classification [32] and the H1 hysteresis drawn by the desorption branch (0.4<P/P0 <0.7) suggests the presence of cylindrical-shaped mesopores with open extremity. Indeed, a well dispersed mesopore distribution was found as depicted in Fig. 1B, inset. B.E.T. surface area was determined to be 137m2/g. Fresh catalyst chemical composition analysis revealed that the actual platinum loading matched the nominal amount of 1.0 wt.% and the sulfur content was determined to be 2.9wt.%. In order to generate catalysts with different density of metal surface sites, the as-synthesized Pt/ZrO2-SO4 sample was submitted to reduction treatments at three different temperatures. The number of Pt metallic centers was calculated by determining the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation taken as a model reaction. It is well recognized that it is a structure-insensitive reaction and thus the reaction rate is straightforwardly correlated to the number of surface metal sites on the catalyst; the higher the reaction rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation the higher the metallic surface area [30,31,33]. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation rates as normalized by catalyst mass and their corresponding concentration of metal surface sites are collected in Table 1 . It can be noted that quite distinct metal site densities were indeed accomplished after applying different reduction temperatures. Those values were seen to dramatically decrease as the temperature was raised, which is associated with the sintering of Pt particles as expected. The concentration of sulfate groups (SO4) was also determined after each reduction procedure and the experimental data are also summarized in Table 1. Those groups are the ones responsible for the renowned strong acidity of sulfated zirconia, particularly Brönsted acid sites [16,34]. It is thus expected that all sulfur atoms is confined in the sulfate acid sites. Consequently, the molar concentration of acid sites has been usually estimated by the amount of sulfur-containing groups as assessed by chemical analysis [35,36]. Complementarily, pyridine adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy was carried out and quantitative data are also collected in Table 1. All spectra (not shown) presented typical absorption bands related pyridine molecules coordinated to Lewis acid sites (∼1450cm−1) and to pyridinium ion bonded to Brönsted acid sites (ca. 1540cm−1). Based on these results, acid/metal ratios were determined for each catalyst as listed in Table 1. It is seen that catalysts with very different surface assemblies were indeed achieved, allowing exploiting the eventual impact of balance between acid/metal sites. All samples were tested in the liquid-phase conversion of xylose at 130°C. Such temperature took into consideration the absence of any thermal homogeneous reaction, which was previously shown to be relevant only above 150°C [28]. The reaction network from xylose is rather complex since a wide range of products may be obtained. Fig. 2 depicts a very simplified reaction scheme, pointing out the most relevant compounds identified in this work and their possible source through cascade or competitive reactions. As mentioned hereinbefore, xylose is isomerized to xylulose on Lewis acid centers and then dehydrated to furfural over Brönsted acid sites [7]. Aldehyde hydrogenation would lead to the aimed furfuryl alcohol [23,24]. Alternatively, xylose can be directly hydrogenated to its parent sugar polyhydric alcohol onto metal sites [37,38] or undergo retro-aldol condensation leading to glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde. These intermediates can be rapidly hydrogenated to their respective polyalcohols, glycerol and ethylene glycol [39,40]. Surface acid sites can thus promote glycerol dehydration, catalyzing the formation of acetol [41,42]. Time-dependent curves of xylose conversion and product selectivity are presented in Fig. 3 . No considerable effect of acid/metal ratio was noted on global activity as measured by xylose conversion. It was indeed confirmed by determining initial reaction rates (Table 2 ). As regarding product distribution, Fig. 3 and Table 2 disclose that xylulose, furfuryl alcohol and furfural are the main products obtained. Apart from those, minor amounts of xylitol, glycerol, acetol and ethylene glycol were also detected. This pattern follows the above-described reaction network and indicates that both acid and metal surface sites are certainly active on xylose transformation, either as sole, isolated centers or by an interplay between them. It is important to observe that xylulose is promptly formed, corroborating the role played by the Lewis acid sites identified by pyridine-adsorbed infrared spectra, but its time-resolved profiles reveal that it is just an intermediate (Fig. 3). That is to say that xylose conversion to other compounds starts off through aldopentose primary isomerization to ketopentose as previously claimed elsewhere [7]. No matter the catalyst, furfuryl alcohol is the most relevant product derived from pentoses, clearly revealing the active multifunctional surface generated on the studied catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time direct conversion of xylose to furfuryl alcohol is reported on a single multifunctional catalyst. One-pot chemoconversion is also substantiated by furfuryl alcohol formation (SFFA ∼20%) along with negligible production of furfural (SFF <1%) and xylitol (SXOL ∼5%) on Pt/ZrO2-SO4 with acid/metal=69 (Fig. 3A). It unveils that both surface sites are cooperatively playing a role to transform pentose sugars (xylose and xylulose), or its parent aldehyde (furfural), into furfuryl alcohol on the same catalyst surface before it even desorbs to the liquid reaction medium. Nonetheless, this fashion seems to be affected by the balance between acid and metal sites as furfural selectivity is seen to gradually increase as acid/metal ratio increases (Fig. 3 B and C). This pattern suggests the occurrence of isolated acid sites playing its sole role on pentose dehydration. A similar rationalization is possible when comparing selectivity towards xylitol and other hydrogenolysis side products. Even though they are produced at lower selectivities, their formation is more favored at lower acid/metal ratio, i.e., on the catalyst with a higher density of Pt surface sites (Table 1). It is thus conceivable that a minor fraction of metal sites exists as isolated centers, set apart from surface acid sites. At this point it is also important to consider any role played by isopropanol used as co-solvent in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol since it is reckoned as a hydrogen donor. Therefore, a control experiment was carried out in the absence of hydrogen using the sample with acid/metal molar ratio of 142. This complementary run was performed under exactly the same conditions but replacing molecular hydrogen with nitrogen. A very different product distribution was observed as displayed in Fig. 4 . Xylulose was still the main product (Sxylu ≥40%) irrespective of the atmosphere, which is quite conceivable since it is formed from xylose isomerization and thus it is not expected to be influenced by a reductive or inert gas atmosphere. Pentoses tandem dehydration/reduction reaction, on the other hand, behaves differently. While furfuryl alcohol is the major furanic compound produced in the presence of hydrogen, only furfural is detected when nitrogen is used instead. It evidences that furfuryl alcohol production via furfural transfer hydrogenation is not promoted on this catalytic system under the reaction conditions applied. It should be mentioned, however, that furfuryl alcohol was identified at longer reaction times and high xylose conversion levels (>50%), unveiling that isopropanol brings only a minor contribution as a hydyrogen donor for furfuryl alcohol formation. To bring some more experimental evidences and further discuss the disposal of acid and metal sites on catalyst surface, three dual acid/metal catalytic systems were prepared. These dual systems were obtained by a simple and straightforward mixture of ZrO2-SO4 acid solid and a Pt/SiO2 metal catalyst whose standard physicochemical characteristics were detailed discussed elsewhere [28]. Attention was given to formulate physical mixtures bearing roughly the same acid/metal ratios investigated previously with the single multifunctional catalysts. An exception was made for the higher acid/metal ratio since it would require an exceptionally higher amount of solid mass that would compromise kinetic control conditions. Therefore, acid/metal ratio of 286 was the highest ratio tested in the dual catalytic system. Fig. 5 compares and contrasts the performance of all single multifunctional catalysts (Fig. 5A–C) and their parent dual catalytic system (Fig. 5D–F). It is outlined that only the yields to the main products associated with dehydration (furfural), hydrogenation (xylitol) and coupled dehydration/hydrogenation (furfuryl alcohol) reactions were plotted for the sake of clarity. The whole product distribution at isoconversion (∼30%) is summarized in Table 2. Different patterns are clearly seen for a same acid/metal ratio according to the catalyst architecture and the profiles also evolve differently as the ratio increases. Besides furfuryl alcohol formation, furfural is always produced at roughly a comparable yield when a dual system is used (Fig. 5D–F). It clearly exposes that furfuryl alcohol is formed via cascade reactions, which take place on the parted surface sites on both individual catalysts. Xylose/xylulose is dehydrated to furfural on acid catalyst and then the aldehyde desorbs and diffuses to the reaction medium. Furfural eventually meets the metal catalyst and is finally reduced to the corresponding alcohol. As the amount of acid catalyst disproportionally increases in the reactor as compared to the metal catalyst, furfural production becomes more significant and it is not hydrogenated at the same rate. This reaction dynamics is strongly impacted when a single multifunctional catalyst is used instead. As previously discussed, furfuryl alcohol is always the main product and minor amounts of furfural are barely produced when the active sites are assembled onto the same surface on the multifunctional catalyst (acid/metal=69 and 142, Figs. 5A and B). It shows an interplay between both sites, implying the active acid and metal sites should be adjacent to promote one-step straightforward production of furfuryl alcohol. Such vicinal arrangement can indeed be optimized by adjusting the density of each site set together on the catalyst surface. As it can be noted by contrasting Fig. 5A and B, when acid/metal ratio is raised from 69 to 142, side production of xylitol, which occurs on isolated hydrogenating metal sites, is hindered. It suggests that more vicinal acid-metal pair sites are created, improving dehydration/hydrogenation one-stage reaction. As a matter of fact, only after significantly increasing the density of surface acid sites (acid/metal=532, Fig. 5C) the aldehyde is formed at an equivalent concentration, exhibiting then a trend similar to that found on dual systems (Fig. 5F). The creation of isolated acid sites, set utterly apart from metal centers, is to be credit with catalyzing pentoses dehydration competitive reaction. A pictorial scheme of the surface assembly of the multifunctional catalysts studied herein is presented in Fig. 6 , representing all isolated acid and metal centers as well as vicinal pair sites and their role in defining product distribution on liquid-phase hydrogenation of xylose. All three multifunctional Pt/ZrO2-SO4 catalysts were recovered by filtration after reaction and dried. Pt loading and concentration of total acid sites of those spent samples were analyzed to bring some insight on catalyst stability. No metal loss was observed whatsoever corroborating the high stability of platinum on liquid-phase reactions. On the other hand, a drop in the sulfur content was seen, which may be ascribed to the partial hydrolysis of sulfate groups (Fig. 7 a) [43]. Indeed the decrease in sulfate loading was found to be roughly linearly dependent on the initial concentration of acid groups; the higher the amount of sulfate in the fresh catalyst the higher sulfur loss along reaction (Fig. 7b). This finding indicates that the concentration of surface acid sites decreases upon reaction, which may thus lead to catalyst deactivation. The results presented in this contribution disclose the possibility of developing a multifunctional catalyst holding both acid and metal sites capable of converting pentose sugars to furfuryl alcohol in a one-step reaction. Moreover it outlines the key role of active sites disposal on the catalyst surface, which must rule the design of more efficient well-organized catalysts for processing biomass-derived second generation sugars."
6,Conclusions,"Direct conversion of xylose to furfuryl alcohol was successfully reported for the first time on a single multifunctional catalyst. Xylose transformation was found to occur on a single-step through intermediate formation of the ketopentose isomer, xylulose. Reaction network and product distribution were shown to depend on the arrangement of acid and metal sites on catalyst surface. It was suggested that furfuryl alcohol is formed through dehydration-hydrogenation cascade reactions on independent acid and metal sites on dual catalytic systems while one-step conversion occurs on vicinal acid-metal pair sites created on single multifunctional catalysts. The creation of isolated metal centers allows the formation of xylitol while the existence of sole acid sites leads to the production of furfural."
