0,Introduction,"Efficient conversion routes of renewable carbon resources into platform chemicals and biofuels are important topics in green and sustainable chemistry [1]. For example, sustainable chemistry with ionic liquids allows production of furan-type platform chemicals and biofuels such as 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 2-methylfuran, γ-valerolactone from biomass via hydrolysis-dehydration-hydrogenation reaction steps [1,2]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are being used on the commercial scale [3] and are widely studied for transforming biomass-related compounds into materials [4] and second-generation biofuels [5], because many ILs can dissolve biomass-related compounds and they are effective reaction solvents [6–8]. Potential applications of ILs can be broadened by using mixtures of ILs in which functionalities such as catalytic, solvation, polarity, solubility or physical properties can be tuned by varying IL mixture composition [7]. In this work, hydrogenation of a biomass-related substrate in IL mixtures is considered. Hydrogenation of biomass-related substrates yields a number of interesting chemical products and biofuels: cellulose yields sugar alcohols [9–12], glucose yields sorbitol [13–15], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural yields 2,5-dimethylfuran [2,12,13], levulinic acid yields γ-valerolactone [14] and furfural yields furfuryl alcohol [2]. Hydrogenation of biomass-related substrates in IL mixtures has not received much attention in the literature and so in this work, hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) in ionic liquid mixtures is chosen to study, because the reaction pathway is well-known [15], namely, intermediates are angelica lactone [16] or 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA) [17] and over-hydrogenation byproducts are 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) or 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PDO). Hydrogenation reactions require a catalyst and can be carried out directly with hydrogen gas or indirectly through transfer hydrogenation that uses H-donor molecules such as formic acid or alcohols [18]. Although transfer hydrogenation is a method that avoids handling hydrogen gas, in this work, hydrogen gas was used because it simplifies analysis of the reaction systems. In this work, commercial noble metal supported catalysts, Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 active for promoting hydrogenation were chosen so that the main aspects of the reaction system with the ionic liquid mixtures and the use of scCO2 with hydrogen gas could be explored. Solutions of ionic liquids containing biomass-related substrates can have relatively high viscosities, such that reaction progress is impeded due to mass transfer effects [19–21]. Presence of a viscosity reducing agent [19], use of a biphasic system [14,20] or consideration of solvent donor/acceptor characteristics [21] are important in reaction system design and in interpreting the reaction mechanism. High-pressure and supercritical CO2 (scCO2) have been used in hydrogenation reactions to improve substrate-catalyst contact and to enhance reaction efficiency [22,23]. In this work, high-pressure CO2 is used to lower reaction phase viscosity and to increase H2 gas solubility in the ionic liquid mixtures via the enhancement ratio [24]. Possible advantages of using biphasic separation systems at conditions well above the critical point of CO2-H2 mixtures are not explored in this work. The solubility of CO2 in ionic liquids, like most light gases, decreases with increasing temperature [25]. The solubility of H2 gas in ionic liquids does not always increase with temperature [25,26] as typically observed for its behavior in common solvents [27], but it can decrease with temperature or have regions of increasing and decreasing solubility behavior (e.g. [BMIM][PF6]) with temperature [26]. Kerlé et al. [28] show that the temperature dependence for a number of light gases in bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Tf2N) anion imidazolium-based ILs can be described precisely by an enthalpy–entropy compensation model in which H2 solubility increases with increasing temperature for Tf2N anion ionic liquids. From the very limited amount of data and modeling studies [26], Cl anion imidazolium-based ionic liquids seem to exhibit H2 solubility that decreases with increasing temperature, whereas Tf2N anion imidazolium-based ionic liquids have inverse solubility behavior [29] and H2 solubility increases with increasing temperature [29,30]. Thus, by mixing an ionic liquid that contains a Cl anion with one that contains a Tf2N anion, it is possible to obtain a desired H2 gas solubility at a given reaction temperature according to previous experimental measurements [31]. The Peng–Robinson equation of state [32] is used to provide qualitative estimation of gas solubility in the ionic liquids at reaction conditions. In this work, high pressure CO2 is used with H2 gas to study the hydrogenation of levulinic acid in ionic liquid mixtures. The role of CO2 in the reaction system is that it can act as a viscosity reducing agent to improve mass transfer and it can enhance the solubility of H2 in an ionic liquid [24,33]. Solvent properties including viscosity, H2 and CO2 solubility, which influence reaction equilibria, reaction rates and mechanism are considered in the research with the objective being to understand chemical and physical chemical effects of hydrogenation in the reaction system. The influence of mixture ionic liquid and CO2 as well as a possible mechanism on hydrogenation of LA with Pd/C was investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The source and purity of substrates, commercial catalysts and ionic liquids used in the study are given in Table 1 . All chemicals were used as received, however, additional analyses were made of the substrates and catalysts. The Pd/C (Pd, 5%), Pd/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 were characterized by SEM (Fig. S1), which show that activated carbon supported catalysts have smaller granular sizes than the Al2O3 supported catalysts. Corresponding EDX maps (Fig. S1) of the catalysts exhibited numerous dispersed spots belonging to Pd, Pd and Ru, respectively. XPS spectra of Pd/C (Pd, 5%) and Pd/Al2O3 (Fig. S2) showed the main binding energy peaks at 334 eV and 335 eV, which correspond to Pd0 (Fig. S2a, b); Ru binding energy peaks were found at 458 eV, 463 eV, 466 eV, 481 eV, 485 eV and 488 eV (Fig. S2c)."
3,Hydrogenation experiments and analyses,"2.2 Hydrogenation experiments and analyses Hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 15 mL stainless-steel autoclave that had a digital manometer (KDM30, Krone Corp., Tokyo). In a typical experiment, 2 mmol of levulinic acid, 2 g of ionic liquid and 0.05 g of catalyst were charged into the reactor. Subsequently, the reactor was purged with CO2 ten times using 1 MPa to 0.1 MPa cycles, and then H2 was introduced to a given pressure (2 MPa or 3 MPa) at 25 °C that was followed by pressurization with CO2 to 5.5 MPa. After these steps, the reactor was heated to the desired temperature (ca. 110 °C ± 0.5 °C) while being magnetically stirred at 500 rpm in which the total pressure (P tot) increased to values of (7.3 to 8.5) MPa. Uncertainty in the pressure is estimated to be 0.3 MPa. The initial reaction time was taken as the time at which the reactor was placed into a preheated oil bath. After a given time, the reaction was terminated by immersing the reactor into an ice bath to cool it down to room temperature. Samples were analyzed with gas chromatography (Agilent 7890 GC/5795 MSD with a HP-5MS column, 0.25 mm in diameter, 30 m in length and 0.25 μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID) with temperature programming (40 °C to 270 °C) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The conversion of LA was analyzed with an HPLC (Jasco) UV-vis/refractive index detector using SH 1011 column (Shodex) and 0.5 mM aqueous solution of sulfuric acid as mobile phase. Conversion of LA was defined as the ratio of moles of LA consumed during the reaction to the moles of LA initially loaded. Yield of GVL was defined as the ratio of the moles of GVL product to moles of LA initially loaded. Selectivity of GVL was defined as the ratio of moles of GVL formed to moles of LA consumed. The conversion of LA, yield of GVL and selectivity of GVL were calculated using Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) LA conversion % = 1- moles LA in product initial moles LA × 100 (2) GVL yield ( mol % ) = moles GVL in product initial moles LA × 100 (3) GVL selectivity ( mol % ) = GVL yield LA conversion × 100 Selected results were replicated for two trials in which GVL yields had standard deviations lower than 3%."
4,Thermogravimetric analysis,"2.3 Thermogravimetric analysis Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a Seiko Exstar 6000 TG/DTA 6200 thermal analyzer (Seiko Instruments, Chiba, Japan) with a high purity nitrogen gas purge. Aluminum pans were used for the samples that were heated at a constant rate of 10 °C/min in all measurements."
5,Estimation of ionic liquid mixture physical properties,"2.4 Estimation of ionic liquid mixture physical properties Viscosities of ionic liquid mixtures (ηmix ) were estimated using experimental values for the pure component ionic liquids and applying Eq. (4): (4) ln η m i x = x 1 ln η 1 + x 2 ln η 2 where x i is the mole fraction of the ionic liquid in the ionic liquid mixture and η i is the pure component viscosity of the ionic liquid. After the viscosity of the ionic liquid mixture was estimated with Eq. (4), the relationship was re-applied to estimate the viscosity of the ionic liquid mixture as pseudo-component (1) and CO2 as component (2) according to estimated solubilities of CO2 in the ionic liquids at a given temperature and pressure (Table S1 and Fig. S4). Physical properties of the pure ionic liquids taken from the literature are shown in Table S1 along with estimated gas solubilities of the binary IL −CO2 and IL - H2 systems at reaction conditions [32–36]. Table S3 shows estimated viscosities of the ionic liquid mixtures with high-pressure CO2 at reaction conditions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Hydrogenation of levulinic acid in ionic liquids-CO2,"3.1 Hydrogenation of levulinic acid in ionic liquids-CO2 Results for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid in ionic liquid mixtures to form product GVL are shown in Table 2 . Hydrogenation of LA was first carried out under solvent-free conditions (Entry 1, Table 2), namely as a solution of LA and catalyst, which gave almost 50% conversion, but had low GVL yield and selectivity. The reason for the low GVL yield is possibly due to the low acidity of LA, or due to intermediates (e.g. 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA) or α-angelica lactone) that do not undergo conversion into GVL without an added ionic liquid [16]. Hydrogenation of LA was then carried out with substrate dissolved into ionic liquids or ionic liquid mixtures with or without the presence of high-pressure CO2 (Table 1). For the case of [BMIM]Cl (Entries 2–3, Table 2), low yields of GVL were obtained in the absence of CO2, but yields greatly increased in the presence of high-pressure CO2, which can be attributed to the lower viscosity of the [BMIM]Cl-CO2 system (Table S3) and possibly due to enhanced H2 solubility in the IL by high-pressure CO2 [24]. When [BMIM][OAc] was used as a mixture with [BMIM]Cl (Entry 4, Table 2), conversion, GVL yield and GVL selectivity increased over that of [BMIM]Cl alone, which can be attributed to the lower viscosity of the acetate anion and higher CO2 solubility in the IL compared with [BMIM]Cl that most likely enhances H2 solubility in the reaction phase (Entries 1–2, Table S1). When [EMIM]Cl was used as a mixture with [BMIM]Cl (Entry 5, Table 2), similar yields were obtained compared with [BMIM]Cl alone. Several combinations of ILs with chloride or acetate anions were compared (Entries 6–8, Table 2) and the reaction solvent system that gave the highest yields and selectivities was the [EMIM]Cl - [EMIM][OAc] mixture (Entry 8, Table 2) that had the lowest estimated viscosity and highest estimated H2 solubility (Entries 1, 4–5, Table S1 and Entries 6–7, Table S3). When ILs having [DEP], [BF4] or [Tf2N] anions (Entries 9-11, Table 2) were used with chloride anion ILs, results were disappointing despite the CO2 solubilities being higher than those in chloride anion ILs, although the [Tf2N] anion IL (Entry 11, Table 2) had relatively high selectivities among the three different anion ILs. When the [BF4] anion IL was used with a chloride anion IL (Entry 10, Table 2), high conversion of LA was obtained that is attributed to high concentrations of H2 in the ionic liquid phase (Entries 3, Table S1 and Fig. S4b), which led to the formation of valeric acid, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran or 1,4-pentanediol [17,37]. The performance of two other supported metal catalysts, Pd/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3, was examined with [BMIM]Cl alone and with mixtures of acetate anion ILs (Entries 12–15, Table 2). Compared with Pd/C catalyst in [BMIM]Cl (Entry 3, Table 1), Pd/Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 (Entries 12 and 14, Table 2) were less favorable for promoting selective formation of GVL as evident by their low (<15%) selectivities, however, when acetate anion ILs were added to the reaction solvent system (Entries 13 and 15, Table 2), GVL yields increased and selectivities increased considerably (ca. 50%) over [BMIM]Cl alone (Entries 12 and 14, Table 2). Thus, it can be concluded that acetate anion ILs added to chloride anion ILs will most likely help to promote selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid, regardless of the precious metal catalyst or its support. In the application of ionic liquid mixtures to biomass-related substrates, it should be noted that previous work has shown that ionic liquids can be easily recycled and reactivated with activated carbon [38]."
8,Effect of reaction time and H2 gas partial pressure,"3.2 Effect of reaction time and H2 gas partial pressure Based on fixed-time reaction studies (Table 2), the ionic liquid mixture, [EMIM]Cl - [EMIM][OAc], was studied in greater detail regarding reaction time and hydrogen partial pressure (fugacity) as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . In Fig. 1, the yield of GVL was found to increase with reaction time and to asymptotically approach 50%. As shown in Fig. 1 for the initial reaction period, (0 to 3) h, GVL yield was directly proportional to reaction time and GVL selectivity monotonically increased during this period. As reaction time exceeded 3 h, however, GVL selectivity exhibited a maximum, while GVL yield continued to increase, which means that undesirable side reactions occurred (e.g. formation of 1,4-pentanediol and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran) [16,17]. Based on the highest selectivity obtained at 4 h reaction time for the given reaction system (Fig. 1), the effect of H2 gas partial pressure ( p H 2 ) on hydrogenation of LA was examined. As shown in Fig. 2, GVL yield increased in proportion to p H 2 up to 3 MPa, while GVL selectivity increased up to about 90% at a conversion of 55%. LA conversion continued to monotonically increase with p H 2 at pressures higher than 3 MPa while GVL yield and selectivity decreased, which is clear evidence of side reactions. Since the solubility of hydrogen gas in the ionic liquid phase increases with increasing p H 2 and the amount of CO2 decreases according to its loaded partial pressure, high p H 2 (less CO2) should result in higher ionic liquid viscosity, which would allow LA to become over-hydrogenated. According to calculated values of the solubility (Table S1, Fig. S2), the viscosity of ionic liquid mixture should increase with decreasing amounts of available CO2 so that GVL selectivity decreased due to over-hydrogenation."
9,Thermal analyses,"3.3 Thermal analyses Thermogravimetric analyses of the substrate levulinic acid with selected ionic liquids and ionic liquid mixtures are shown in Fig. 3 . For the pure compounds, levulinic acid, [BMIM]Cl and [BMIM][OAc], the DTA curve exhibited a sharp exothermic peak at 224 °C, 292.3 °C and 242.7 °C, respectively. When LA was mixed with either of the ionic liquids, [BMIM]Cl-LA mixture or [BMIM][OAc]-LA mixture, the DTA curve exhibited a sharp exothermic peak at 291.6 °C and 248.9 °C, respectively, namely, the increase in exothermic temperature of the ionic liquid-LA mixture implied stronger interactions of LA with the ionic liquids, such that the substrate LA became stabilized by [BMIM]Cl and [BMIM][OAc] ionic liquids, most likely through hydrogen bonding."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.4 Reaction mechanism In the presence of a bifunctional catalyst, the reaction pathway for the conversion of LA to GVL goes through the intermediate, 4-hydroxypentanoic acid (4-HPA), at moderate temperatures (< 200 °C), and through intermediates, α- and β- angelica lactone (AL) at high-temperatures (>200 °C) [17]. Based on general trends in the literature and results shown in Table 2, a reaction mechanism can be proposed for conversion of LA to GVL in mixed ILs with hydrogen gas in the presence of high-pressure CO2 and Pd/C catalyst (Fig. 4 ), in which the ILs fulfill the role of a bifunctional catalyst. Initially, when LA substrate, Pd/C catalyst and IL mixture ([EMIM]Cl-[EMIM][OAc]) are loaded into the reaction system (Step 1, Fig. 4), LA is stabilized by 1 and 2 but with LA preferring to interact with the C2 of 2 due to specific interactions When CO2 and H2 are added to the system (Step 2, Fig. 4), CO2 dissolves as 3 and 4, but has strong specific interactions with the acetate anion as 3 and this enhances mass transport of H2 gas to the catalyst (Step 3, Fig. 4) due to solubility effects [24,30]. As the system temperature is increased to reaction temperature, it is likely that the H2 solubility in the ionic liquid increases, while that of CO2 decreases, and the IL viscosity decreases according to qualitative analyses with an equation of state (Tables S1 and S2, Fig. S4). Compared with hydrogenation of LA without solvent and in pure [BMIM]Cl as in Table 2 (Entries 1–2), the CO2 lowers reaction phase viscosity, increases H2 solubility via the enhancement ratio [24] and facilitates H2 transport to the Pd/C catalyst. When the system is brought to reaction temperature, active hydrogen is formed according to conventional Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics for the commercial Pd/C catalyst (Step 3, Fig. 4) that produces hydrogen transfer species 5 and LA is hydrogenated (Step 4, Fig. 4) to form 4-HPA, whereas CO2 in the acetate anion-containing IL may become partially hydrogenated through 5 or serve as a bridge for hydrogenating LA (Step 4, Fig. 4). The 4-HPA then undergoes dehydration to form GVL that is promoted by the strong affinity that the chloride anion of 6 has for water (Step 5, Fig. 4). As the GVL concentration increases in the reaction mixture and unless it is removed, GVL may become further hydrogenated (Step 6, Fig. 4) to form unwanted byproducts. A reaction scheme analogous to Fig. 4 that proceeds through intermediates, α- and β- angelica lactone (AL) can also be formulated depending on the chemical characteristics of the ionic liquids (Fig. S5) and their thermal stability [39]. At temperatures higher than those studied in this work, LA dehydration can be expected to occur first to form AL, which is then hydrogenated to form GVL (Fig. S5). However, at high temperatures, the thermal stability of the ionic liquids and the kinetics of their thermal decomposition have to be considered [39]. The hydrogenation of LA into GVL in chloride anion, acetate anion ionic liquid mixtures with hydrogen gas in the presence of high-pressure CO2 and hydrogenation catalyst can be summarized as follows: (i) dissolution of LA into the ionic liquid mixture according to specific hydrogen bond interactions between LA and the ILs, (ii) physical and chemical absorption of CO2 with the acetate anion IL, (iii) transport of H2 to the catalyst surface that is facilitated by CO2 via enhancement ratio and its interaction with the acetate anion IL, (iv) subsequent dissociation of H2 on the catalyst to form active hydrogen, (v) hydrogenation of levulinic acid at low temperatures (110 °C) to form 4-hydroxypentanoic acid that may be assisted by active hydrogen - acetate anion IL −CO2 complexes in the reaction phase, and (vi) dehydration of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid to GVL with the chloride anion IL that has strong affinity for water."
11,Conclusions,"In conclusion, selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) can be tuned with ionic liquid (IL) mixtures in the presence of high-pressure CO2. Acetate anion IL with chloride anion IL in the presence of high-pressure CO2 gave higher GVL yields and selectivities than other IL mixtures having other cation anion combinations. A mechanism was proposed for chloride anion ionic liquid - acetate anion ionic liquid mixtures, in which the substrate LA is stabilized by the chloride anion IL, while CO2 interacts with the acetate anion IL to promote hydrogen gas transport and the formation of active hydrogen with the aid of a hydrogenation catalyst. The interaction of CO2 with the acetate anion IL lowers reaction phase viscosity and allows efficient hydrogenation of LA to form product GVL. Dynamic methods applied to remove the GVL product during its formation will be studied in the future to improve performance of the reaction system."
