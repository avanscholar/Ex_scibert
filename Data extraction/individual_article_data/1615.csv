0,Introduction,"The demand for sustainable energy resources arising from depleting fossil fuels and environmental threats caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has made hydrogen as one of the most appealing energy vector for the future due to its negligible pollution production when burnt [1]. At present, of approximately 0.1 GT of H2 that is annually produced worldwide [1], a major portion (more than 95%) still involves the consumption of fossil fuels [2]. In this perspective, biological H2 production has recently gained much attention due to its potentiality as a method for sustainable H2 production from renewable resources. In particular, biohydrogen production through dark fermentative processes can use organic waste, combining energy recovery with waste minimisation [1]. The use of mixed cultures of H2 producing microorganisms is preferred over pure cultures when treating waste in full-scale plants, due to their robustness against variations of process parameters [3–5]. However, mixed cultures also contain H2 consuming microorganisms (e.g. hydrogenotrophic methanogens and sulphur-utilising microorganisms) and thus, inoculum pre-treatment using various physical and chemical methods or specific reactor operating conditions (such as acidic conditions) have usually been applied in order to improve H2 yield [3–7]. Over the last decades, membrane assisted biological treatment has gained much attention due to their peerless solid-liquid separation performance [8–10]. Application of membrane bioreactors (MBRs) obviate the potential risk of biomass washout, producing effluent of very high quality in terms of solids removal, reduce plant footprint and provide flexibility in operation [11]. Likewise, the use of MBR has brought significant improvement in H2 production efficiency in dark fermentative processes [10–12]. However, despite the benefits that MBR offers, membrane fouling is still the main barrier in MBR application, especially under anaerobic conditions [7,13]. Dynamic membrane (DM) has recently been proposed as an out-of-the-box and cost effective alternative to the use of conventional membranes [14]. DM exploits the cake deposit on a support medium as a mean of solid-liquid separation; for this purpose, cheap underlying supports, such as filter clothes and meshes have been used to develop DM layers [14]. The interest on the application of DM technology includes operation under high filtration flux (J), low transmembrane pressures (TMP) and lower maintenance and energy consumption as compared to conventional membranes [14–16]. Recent studies on DMs have mainly been focused on evaluating their performance using synthetic wastewater [15,17,18], municipal wastewater [19–22] and excess sludge digestion [23,24]. Very few studies have been focused on its application in treating high strength, complex wastewater such as landfill leachate [25–27]. Moreover, the enrichment of H2 producing consortia has recently been achieved in a side-stream DM bioreactor [28]. However, that study [28] was mainly focused on the evaluation of the H2 production rate and yield, and on the microbial community composition, whereas discussion regarding filtration behaviour of the developed DM and its effect on the biological performances of the system are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the formation and performance of DM while integrating it with an anaerobic fermentative bioreactor for the production of H2 using an untreated mixed bacterial culture at mesophilic conditions. The behaviour of DM was thoroughly evaluated over the period of bioreactor operation in conjunction with the effect of change in the feed characteristics, operating parameters and biological performance of the system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bioreactor setup and operation,"2.1 Bioreactor setup and operation The study was performed in a laboratory scale continuously mixed anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor (AnDMBR), with a total volume of 1.0 L (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) and a working volume of 0.8 L (Fig. 1 ). DM was developed over monofilament woven meshes made of polyamide/nylon submerged inside the cross-flow module. Two commercial nylon meshes (Table 1 ) with different openings (52 and 21 μm) were tested in this study. In addition, different effective filtrations areas were also tested. The effect of different influent organic concentration was assessed in three different experimental runs. The specific conditions applied in the three experimental runs are reported in Table 2 . DM filtration was performed in an external cross-flow configuration. The cross-flow filtration was carried out by using a peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 403U/R1, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK) which circulated mixed liquor along the mesh surface providing a constant cross flow velocity (CFV) of 30 m h−1. The DM modules were built by weaving the meshes over a cylindrical plastic frame (15 mm diameter × 60 mm height) of a total surface area of 28 cm2. Each cylinder had uniformly distributed rectangular openings (3 × 5 mm) for an effective filtration area of approximately 59% (16.5 cm2) of the total surface area of the DM module. The constant working volume of the bioreactor was maintained by a level sensor directly connected to the influent peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 401U/D1, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK) (Fig. 1), while effluent was extracted by a second peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 401U/D1, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK). Biogas production was monitored by using two homemade wet-tip gas meters, one connected on the anaerobic reactor and one on the external cross-flow module to account for possible biogas production from the different locations inside the system. The reactor was operated continuously at mesophilic temperature of 34 ± 1 °C that was maintained by a thermostatic bath (IS Co. GTR 2000 “11×”, Italy). The sludge in the reactor was maintained continuously mixed by using a magnetic stirrer (Variomag Maxi Direct, Thermo Scientific, Italy). To inhibit methanogenic microorganisms, the bioreactor pH was controlled at 5.0 ± 0.1 by dosing NaOH (2.5 M) using a peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 401U/D1, Falmouth, Cornwall, UK) connected to an automatic pH controller (Crison 28 carrying a pH probe Crison 53 35)."
3,Inoculum and feed,"2.2 Inoculum and feed The bioreactor was fed with synthetic feed containing sucrose as carbon source at a concentration between 10 and 100 gCOD L−1. To ensure the availability of alkalinity and macro- and micro-nutrients, the following compounds were also added to the feed solution (dissolved in tap water): NaHCO3 (1.0 g L−1), NH4Cl (0.04 gN gCOD −1 L−1), KH2PO4 (0.01 gP gCOD −1 L−1), FeCl3·6H2O (2.1 mgFe L−1), CaCl2·2H2O (8.2 mgCa L−1), MgCl2·6H2O (2.4 mgMg L−1), Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.22 mgMo L−1), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.23 mgZn L−1), CuSO4·5H2O (0.128 mgCu L−1), NiCl2·6H2O (0.1 mgNi L−1), H3BO4 (0.007 mgB L−1), Ne2SeO3 (0.06 mgSe L−1), MnCl2·4H2O (0.56 mgMn L−1) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.124 mgCo L−1). All chemicals, reagent grade and of 99.9% purity were purchased from J. T. Baker (JT Baker, Italy). The bioreactor was inoculated with anaerobic sludge (TS of 14 g L−1 and VS of 7.44 g L−1) obtained from a full-scale mesophilic sludge digester treating the excess sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Padova, Italy. No pre-treatment of the inoculum was performed to inactivate the methanogenic microorganisms. Bioreactor SRT was maintained at approximately 15–20 d."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to standard methods [29] (APHA, AWWA, WEF 2012). Residual sucrose (Carbohydrates) was analysed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method [30]. The residual carbohydrates per unit influent carbohydrates concentration was then expressed in terms of carbohydrates conversion efficiency of the system. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs including acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric and caproic acids) were measured on filtered samples (0.45 μm PTFE membranes) by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800) equipped with a flame ionization detector, a 25 m × 0.53 mm × 0.70 mm CP-Wax 58 (FFAP) CB capillary column (Varian) and using nitrogen as carrier gas. Biogas composition was measured by a micro-gas chromatograph (Varian 490-GC) equipped with a 10 m MS5A column and 10 m PPU column, using argon as carrier gas and a thermal conductivity detector. The continuous monitoring of the temperature was performed by using an electronic thermometer (Hanna Check-temp °C) inserted inside the bioreactor. The effluent flowrate was obtained by measuring the effluent volume over a known time interval. Similarly, the filtration fluxes were calculated by dividing the flowrate by the effective filtration area of the DM membrane modules. Transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured separately for each DM by using an electronic pressure gauge (COMARK C9505/IS, Pressure Meter, 0–30 PSI). DM total membrane resistance (R) was calculated according to Darcy’s equation as follows: (1) R = TMP μ · J where J is the permeate flux, TMP is the transmembrane pressure, μ is the viscosity of the permeate (assumed equal to water). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using Microsoft excel."
5,Results and discussion,"The bioreactor was managed in an attempt of operating the system at low HRT (approximately 1 d) and applying high organic loading rate (OLR), so to facilitate the inhibition of methanogens by acidification [31–34] and avoiding the accumulation of high concentration of metabolic by-products (VFA etc.), inhibitory to H2 producing bacteria with their simultaneous removal from the system [35]. The first two experiments were terminated due to the inhibition of biohydrogen production and the new experiment was restarted with the addition of fresh inoculum and a new start-up strategy to achieve steady state biological performance."
6,Filtration flux and transmembrane pressure,"3.1 Filtration flux and transmembrane pressure The first experiment was started up using a mesh with opening of 52 µm to support the development of the DM. TMP increased from 3 to 12 kPa in 2 d confirming [36] the very rapid formation of the DM (Fig. 2 a). Although the 52 µm mesh showed the rapid formation of DM demonstrated by the rapid TMP build-up observed just after every mesh cleaning procedure (Fig. 2a), the effluent quality showed a progressive deterioration due to high and increasing loss of suspended solids (Fig. 3 a). Effluent TSS concentrations were below 600 mgTSS L−1 (TSS removal of approx. 97%) during the first 3 days of operation, but gradually increased above 1 gTSS L−1 (TSS removal of approx. 93%) in 5 days (Fig. 3a). With the aim of reducing the loss of TSS in the effluent, the mesh was replaced by another one with openings of 21 µm after 8 days of continuous bioreactor operation. In spite of this, the reduction in mesh openings (from 52 to 21 µm) did not bring major improvements in solids removal (Fig. 3a). The reduction in mesh openings decreased the membrane fluxes to less than 4 L m−2 h−1, thus increasing the HRT above 6 d (Fig. 4 a). In fact, resistance increased rapidly to values above 4 × 1013 m−1, confirming intense membrane fouling. In order to decrease the HRT, the filtration area was doubled on day 16. The increased filtration area caused a temporary improvement of the filtration fluxes which was, however, not appreciable and long lasting (Fig. 4a). Since the strategy adopted to inhibit methanogenic activity was through applying high OLR for subsequent acidification through VFA accumulation, high influent COD concentration (100 gCOD L−1) was fed to the bioreactor in the first experiment. However, in MBR operated with conventional micro- or ultrafiltration membrane for fermentative H2 production, high OLR showed to increase membrane fouling propensities by influencing the properties of colloidal materials and production of EPS [37]. As for conventional MBR, studies have reported that an excess concentration of biofoulants can also intensify fouling processes in DM [19,38,39]. Yu et al. [39] reported that high amount of EPS greatly affects DM formation and fouling propensities by influencing properties like particle size of the sludge flocks and compactness of the cake layer. However, the author did not present any result on the effect of intensified fouling on DM solid retention performance as observed in this study. Although EPS analysis was not performed in this study, it can be inferred that the high OLR applied in the first experiment might have affected the amount of biofoulants inside the bioreactor and, thus, might be responsible for the observed change in the filtration behaviour of the DM. The influent COD concentration was reduced to 50 g L−1 for the start-up of the second experiment. Moreover, the effective mesh filtration area was further increase to 66 cm2 (4 modules) in the attempt of decreasing the HRT to values lower than those achieved in the first experiment. Although the high fouling propensity of the sludge demonstrated by the high TMP and resistance (Fig. 2b) observed over the second experiment, the increase of the filtration area effectively helped to reduce the HRT of the system to approximately 2 d (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the increased filtration area led to fairly stable fluxes and, thus, HRT (Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, solid-liquid separation performance of the DM showed a progressive deterioration of the effluent quality, similar to the trend observed in the first experiment. Effluent TSS concentration rapidly increased from 0.6 to 3.4 g L−1 in 10 days corresponding to a TSS removal as low as 60% (Fig. 3b). Therefore, although the stable values of the HRT suggested the formation of a stable DM, the TSS removal confirmed the presence of a weak cake layer with poor sludge retention. On the contrary, solid-liquid separation by the DM greatly improved as soon as the influent COD concentration was further reduced to 10 gCOD L−1 after 13 days of continuous operation. In fact, effluent quality started to gradually improve with average TSS removal reaching 94% (effluent TSS concentration of 480 mg L−1) by the end of the second experimental run (Fig. 3b). The reduction of the feed concentration also lowered DM filtration resistance (Fig. 2b), improved fluxes and enabled the system to operate at an HRT of approximately 1.2 d (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the results of the first two experiments demonstrated that the feed concentration greatly affected the filtration characteristics of the DM at least under the applied operating conditions. In order to confirm the effect of the feed concentration on the filtration characteristics of the DM under fermentative processes for biohydrogen production, the third experiment was carried out by feeding the bioreactor with an initial concentration of 10 gCOD L−1 and increased up to 30 gCOD L−1 in a stepwise manner (Fig. 2c). The decreased feed concentration was very effective in improving the permeate fluxes across the DM. In fact, during the first 10 days of the third experiment, average HRT of about 1 d was achieved, corresponding to permeate flux of approximately 5 L m−2 h−1 (Fig. 4c). Moreover, over the same period, the DM showed excellent solids removal efficiency of 98%, with effluent TSS concentrations that were consistently lower than 600 mg L−1 (Fig. 3c). The increased feed concentration caused the rise of the TMP values (Fig. 2c) maintaining approximately the same permeate fluxes (the slight decrease of the HRT to about 0.9 d was due to the variability of the pump flow rather than to a voluntary variation of the HRT). The increase of the TMP (up to 30.5 kPa) did not greatly affect the solid retention of the formed DM (Fig. 3c). In fact, solids removal efficiency of DM measured for the entire duration of the third experimental run was higher than the two previous ones, averaging 95% of TSS removal with effluent concentration of 0.60 ± 0.03 gTSS L−1. It is of note that the fluxes of 5.0–6.2 L m−2 h−1 obtained in this study are comparable to the ones applied using conventional membranes for biological H2 production [12]. The role of mixed liquor TSS (MLTSS) concentration in DM filtration performance has been well documented [36,40]. However, this study demonstrates that other operating conditions (influent COD concentration) can greatly affect DM behaviour. In fact, TSS removal and sludge filterability over the third experiment (Fig. 3c) were far better than the previous ones, despite the mean MLTSS concentrations of around 13 g L−1 (of the third experiment) was between the values of the others (Fig. 3d, e and f). Fig. 5 clearly shows that influent COD concentration has an evident effect on solids removal performance and membrane resistance. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated significant differences among the influent COD concentrations for TSS removal (p < 1 0−4) and membrane resistance (p < 10−11) over the second and third experimental runs (i.e. when the system was operated using the same filtration area (Table 2)."
7,Biological performance,"3.2 Biological performance Biogas production started almost 1–2 days after bioreactor start-up and mostly followed the trends in OLR in every experimental run (Fig. 6 ). Methane was never detected in the produced biogas, confirming that operating the system at relatively low HRT, high OLR and low pH effectively inhibit methanogenic microorganisms [31–34]. Due to the variations in biogas composition CO2 content in the biogas was variable between 20 and 80% in all the experimental runs. Acetic and butyric acids were the main fatty acids over the study (with a short exception during the third experiment) while propionic acid was always present at low concentration (usually below 2 mM; Fig. 7 ). Valeric acid was never detected (i.e. below the detection limit of approx. 0.2 mM) while caproic acid was detected (i.e. above the detection limit) in the third experiment only (Fig. 7c). During the first experiment, biogas production and H2 concentrations were rather variable and related to sucrose conversion and of VFAs production inside the bioreactor (Figs. 6a and 7a). Over the month of operation of the first experiment hydrogen production was very variable ranging from values close to zero to 455 mL H2 L−1. Hydrogen content in the biogas, although variable, showed a decreasing trend in the same period. As expected, VFAs concentration increased (up to 79 mM and 96 mM for acetic and butyric acid respectively) when H2 production improved. On day 32 of operation, a malfunction of the feeding pump caused the lack of the load for one day. The restart of the feed improved the fermentative activity, and, on day 34, peaks in H2 production (of 920 mL H2 L−1) and concentration (48%) were observed (Fig. 6a and d) with a new increase in VFA production (mainly butyric acid). Thereafter, the biological activity gradually deteriorated until the end of the experiment. The inhibition of the H2 production could have been caused by the accumulation of VFAs above 60 mM (Fig. 7a) and by the possible production of alcohols (not measured in this study) due to solventogenesis at higher OLR [33,41,42]. The low pH (5.0 ± 0.1) can favour the production of solvents and undissociated VFAs that have been reported to be inhibitory for the H2 producing bacteria [41,43]. In fact, Van Ginkel and Logan [41] reported that acetic or butyric acid concentrations above 25 mM can promote solventogenesis and, thus, reducing H2 yield. Therefore, the severe inhibition of the biohydrogen production observed in this study could well be associated with the accumulation of VFAs due to the high influent COD concentration (100 g L−1) and low operating pH [41–43]. The second experiment started with an almost continuous increase of gas production reaching, after one week, maximum values of 902 mL L−1 and 397 mL L−1 for biogas and H2, respectively (Fig. 6b). VFAs concentration also increased with the gas production. However, when the concentration of butyric acid surpassed that of acetic acid (Fig. 7b), hydrogen production rate showed an abrupt decrease (Fig. 6b and e). The gradual inhibition of biological activity was once again initiated at high VFA concentrations (approx. 50 mM for acetic and butyric acid; Fig. 7b) confirming that high VFA concentration can inhibit biological hydrogen production [41]. A temporary recovery in H2 concentration up to 42% (and to a lesser extent in the H2 production) was observed just after the reduction of the influent COD concentration, which was, however, of short duration. Over the third experiment, biogas and H2 production gradually increased up to 2000 and 950 mL L−1, respectively (Figs. 6c and 5d), according to the applied OLR profile. Hydrogen concentration also gradually improved over the experiment, reaching concentration of approximately 40–50%. The system operated at an HRT of approximately 1 d achieving hydrogen yield of approximately 8 L H2 mole−1 of sucrose. Regardless of the gradual increased in OLR, carbohydrates conversion efficiency remained stably above 99% (Fig. 7c). Similar carbohydrates conversion efficiency has been reported for conventional MBR working at HRT of less than 1 d [5,11,12,28,44]. The distribution of VFA during the third experiment was also similar to the previous experiments with respect to acetic and butyric acids as the main product of carbohydrates conversion with the exception of a significant production of caproic acid after 40 days of continuous bioreactor operation. The production of caproic acid to more than 20 mM and consequent reduction in the concentration of butyric acid to less than 8 mM from an average of 24 ± 2.1 mM could be the result of secondary fermentation of ethanol and organic acids [45]. Although secondary fermentation can still produce hydrogen, the product yield results significantly decreased [45]. The upper concentration of 30 gCOD L−1 fed over the last part of the third experiment seems, thus, the limiting concentration that can be applied in order to sustain the biohydrogen production at least at the operating conditions adopted in this study."
8,Implications,"3.3 Implications DM technology, which is more cost-effective than conventional MBR systems, was applied for biohydrogen production. This study revealed the effect of influent COD concertation on DM solid Liquid separation performance. It was difficult to operate the system at high influent COD (>30 g L−1) while keeping low HRT and avoiding the build-up of metabolic products below toxicity concentration. The solid retention of DM under applied operating conditions was not comparable with conventional MBR systems [8–10]. However, if considered on the basis of specific filtration area per unit reactor volume used in this study i.e. 8.25 m2 m−3 against 33.33 m2 m−3 for conventional MBR for hydrogen production [12], DM technology has additional room for improvement in terms of physical and biological performance. The system can be operated at even lower HRT, with lower DM fouling and in return, could bring improvement in hydrogen production rate [10]."
9,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated that DM filtration can be successfully applied as a mean of solid-liquid separation in dark fermentative processes for the production of H2 under mesophilic conditions. Influent feed concentration significantly affects the performance of the system in both sludge filterability and biohydrogen production. High influent COD concentration caused a drastic deterioration in terms of the sludge permeability, solids separation and biohydrogen production. The decrease of H2 production at high OLR was attributed to VFA accumulation. Stable DM filterability and H2 production was achieved applying low influent COD concentration (10–30 gCOD L−1) and low filtration fluxes (approximately 2 L m−2 h−1)."
