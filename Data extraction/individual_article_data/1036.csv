0,Introduction,"Cultivation of microalgae can be performed with artificial media or wastewaters. Microalgae have many benefits in wastewater treatment such as removal of pollutants and biofuel production, but their practice needs to be developed to obtain high biomass for industry [1]. Interference of wastewater treatment causes accumulation of pollutants as nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater and it results in downstream eutrophication and environmental problems. Excess deposit of these pollutants leads to death of living systems and cyanotoxin production. To discard these toxins, biological, chemical and physical treatment technologies must be used. These technologies load extra cost [2]. Therefore, proper treatment of wastewater is important. Microalgae can help removal of these nutrients. Recently, depletion of fossil derivative fuel has caused the investigation of novel energy sources. To produce high amounts of bio-fuel, biomass and microlagal growth can be tightly regulated with pH, temperature, salinity, light, macro, micro elements and hormones affecting metabolic components of microalgae [3]. Wastewaters can be classified to three main groups. They can be artificial, domestic, and agricultural. Artificial wastewater used instead of municipal wastewater did not give deserved results at previous studies for biomass production [1]. Microalgae include many various genera. One of them, Chlorella has been used for protein source, animal feed and its active compounds. Nowadays, it has been studied for biofuel production and environmental problems [4]. Chlorella zofingiensis belongs to class Trebouxiophyceae and order Chlorellales. C. zofingiensis has high kinetic parameters under autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. It includes natural astaxanthin and lutein. C. zofingiensis has been studied for biodiesel production in detail [5]. However, there still have not been enough studies related with bio-butanol production from microalgae in the literature. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is one of the auxin members and has many properties of auxins [6]. IAA declines reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stress conditions [7]. To our knowledge, the effect of IAA on microalgae grown in wastewater has not been investigated for bio-butanol in detail yet. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which was used in this study for the pre-treatment procedure is a highly reactive substance with great oxidizing power. It functions as catalyst because of its capability to form various hydroxyl radicals. It can be easily converted to oxygen and water. So, it does not remain as contaminant for the experiment. Ansari and co-workers [8] studied different disruption techniques for microalgae pellets in wastewater and indicated that the microalgae obtained a biomass concentration of 1.64 g/L. Photosynthesis is important for green microalgae. Microalgae can be followed with accumulation of pigments. Photosynthesis is biochemical process and it uses sun energy and converts to chemical energy to accumulate organic molecules such as carbohydrate, protein and lipid. At the any stress conditions, photosynthetic capacity can be suppressed and amount of biomass decreases [6]. Photosynthesis capacity can be determined with chl a, chl b and carotenoid content. Amounts of carotenoids increase in stress conditions of environment [9]. Growth of microalgae can be followed with chl a, chl b and carotenoid content. Formation of free radical in microalgae generally occurs in metabolic pathway. Free radicals are formed by metabolic activities of organisms and decomposition of macromolecules. These reactions lead to the formation of ROS via superoxide, hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide [10]. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) are the linked enzymes that scavenging ROS and neutralize their negative effects [11]. Low levels of H2O2 affect metabolic cascade and results in growth of microorganisms [12]. In addition, glutathione (GSH) is a non-protein tripeptide compound. GSH is also considered as the most potent natural antioxidant molecule, functions scavenging of free radicals (ROS) and maintains detoxification of hydrogen peroxide [13]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an endogenous source of oxidative stress. Lifestyle and environmental exposure can lead to an increase in MDA. High amounts of antioxidant enzymes are connected with stress conditions [14]. Bio-butanol (C4H9OH) consists of four carbons involving colourless alcohol. Bio-butanol can be used as new renewable energy source compared to traditional fuels. It has some advantages. Bio-butanol is more useful than bio-methanol and bioethanol due to higher energy density. It can be formed with the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Microalgae are substrate for this fermentation. C. acetobutylicum is usually used for anaerobic digestion. Reaction generates butyric and acetic acids. Then, at the second reaction, butanol, acetone and ethanol are produced [15]. In current study, we examined the role of Chlorella zofingiensis grown in municipal wastewaters and IAA via its productivity, carbohydrate concentration and bio-butanol content in the flat-photobioreactor (FPBR). We carried out activities of antioxidant enzymes and molecules (SOD, CAT, GSH and MDA) under stress conditions. Also, we tried H2O2 as pre-treatment method to apply hydrolysis procedure. The purpose of this study is to enhance bio-butanol production with Chlorella zofingiensis cultivated in various concentrations of wastewater, IAA and H2O2 as pre-treatment hydrolysis agent in FPBR. Also, we explained how activities of antioxidant enzymes changed with these agents in the current study. The present study is the first report demonstrating bio-butanol production from C. zofingiensis CCALA 944 grown at various concentrations of municipal wastewater and IAA after H2O2 pretreatment in a flat-photobioreactor and the change of antioxidant enzymes and molecules."
1,Materials and methods,
2,The microalgal strain and set up of flat-photobioreactor,"2.1 The microalgal strain and set up of flat-photobioreactor Chlorella zofingiensis CCALA 944 was purchased from CCALA in Czech Republic. Microalgae firstly were cultivated in agar plates. Then, Chlorella zofingiensis was maintained in modified BG-11 medium during the experiments. Municipal wastewater was prepared synthetically. The total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and, and total phosphorous (TP) in the municipal wastewater were nearly 85 mg/L, 12 mg/L and 3.5 mg/L, respectively. Value of pH was 7.6 in municipal wastewater. The all chemicals were got from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. 1-L flat-photobioreactor (FPBR) was made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and it was explained in our previous study [16]."
3,Preparation of wastewater and monitoring of cultures,"2.2 Preparation of wastewater and monitoring of cultures Various concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100%) of wastewater (WW) were mixed with BG-11. BG-11 medium was used as control (0% wastewater) and prepared according to Andersen protocol [17]. In addition, different concentrations (20, 40, 80 and 120 µM) of Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were used in this study. IAA experiments were performed in 25% WW. Growth parameters of C. zofingiensis were followed at 680 nm with spectrophotoscopic measurements according to absorbance values. Culture was grown up to late logarithmic phase and harvested with centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C [18]. Microalgal pellets were collected and lyophilized. Then, samples were stored at −20 °C for next experiments [19]."
4,Preparation of chemical hydrolysis and H2O2 pre-treatment,"2.3 Preparation of chemical hydrolysis and H2O2 pre-treatment Acid hydrolysis of C. zofingiensis was examined to Miranda with some arrangements [20]. Lyophilized C. zofingiensis pellets (10% w/v) were disarranged with 0.5 M H2SO4. Slurry was heated at 121 °C for 30 min. Later, they were left to room temperature for cooling. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was taken for analytical assay analysis. H2O2 pre-treatment procedure of C. zofingiensis was applied according to Monte with a few modifications [21]. Various concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8 and 10%) of hydrogen peroxide were mixed with microalgae suspensions."
5,Bio-butanol fermentation,"2.4 Bio-butanol fermentation In this study, Clostridium acetobutylicum was used. C. acetobutylicum was cultured in medium. Fermentation procedure was applied according to Cheng [22]. The medium included peptone (360); NaNH2 (400); KH2PO4 (119); KCl (167); MgCl26H2O (232); H3BO3 (0.74); CaCl26H2O (32); CuCl2H2O (0.35); ZnCl2 (0.27); MnCl24H2O (64); Na2MoO42H2O (0.33); FeCl24H2O (10.5); CoCl26H2O (3.9); C2H3NaO2S (217) mg/L."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Chlorophyll (Chl-a; Chl-b) and photo protective carotenoid (PPC) concentrations were measured with spectroscopic method [23,24]. 1 mL of microalgae culture firstly was centrifuged to obtain pellet. Supernatant was discarded and pellet was mixed with methanol during 30 min in the dark at 45 °C in the incubator. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 13000 rpm, 5 min. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of supernatants were measured according to absorbance values at 480, 652, 665 and 750. Chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were calculated with using Equation below. Chl - a μ g / m l = - 8.0962 x A 652 + 16.5169 x A 665 Chl - a μ g / m l = - 8.0962 x A 652 + 16.5169 x A 665 Chl - b μ g / m l = 27.4405 x A 652 - - 12.1688 x A 665 Carotenoid μ g / m l = 4 x A 480 Absorbance values at 480, 652 and 665 nm were corrected from turbidity by subtracting absorbance values at 750 nm. Rubisco activity was carried out according to Wang [25]. Enzyme assay was followed by means of NADH with absorbance value at 340 nm [26]. Total protein was extracted according to Weis [27]. Protein concentrations of C. zofingiensis were calculated according to the Bradford method [28]. Total carbohydrate concentrations of C. zofingiensis were examined by the anthrone method with a few modifications [29]. Fermented C. zofingiensis was analysed for determination of bio-butanol content. Bio-butanol content and yield were carried out to Maiti, spectrophotometrically [30]."
7,"Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde content (MDA)","2.6 Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde content (MDA) Upon time microalgae samples reach to stationary phases, 25 mL of microalgae samples were centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, supernatant was discarded and pellet was suspended in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.8 and samples were sonicated for 30 min at 5 W. Microalgae samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Next, the supernatants were taken and measured for SOD, CAT activity, GSH and MDA. CAT and SOD activity was determined according to nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) method [31,32]. MDA was determined at 535 nm according to thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method [33,34]. In addition, GSH content was determined according to Anderson method [35]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The effect of wastewater on C. Zofingiensis,"3.1 The effect of wastewater on C. Zofingiensis Propagation of microalgae depends on various genetic and environmental factors such as macro and micro nutrients, pH, light, salinity index and temperature. Stress factors affect microalgae related with their growth rates and percentages of macromolecules. Absorbance values can indicate pre-specific growth rate of microalgae. In this study, we firstly carried out the effects of various concentrations of municipal wastewater and plotted them according to absorbance versus time (days) for the determination of the maximum growth curves of C. zofingiensis. Algal suspension can be synchronized in G1 phase at stationary phase, so it usually is taken for inoculation and biochemical tests at stationary phase [36]. C. zofingiensis reached to stationary phase at 8 days. 25% wastewater showed the highest absorbance value with 1.85 and had approximately similar value compared to control. Control group reached to late logarithmic phase with 1.73 OD value. Absorbance values of 50%, 75% and 100% decreased when concentrations of municipal wastewaters increased. In addition, we plotted C. zofingiensis according to dry weights and cell numbers of microalgae versus time (days). The results were parallel to absorbance values of C. zofingiensis. 25% had the maximum dry weight and cell number value with 2.39 g/L and 8.5 × 106 cells / mL and control value was 2.22 g/L and 8.3 × 106 cells /mL for dry weight and cell number value, respectively. Actually, these results were logical. At 25%, absorbance, dry weight and cell numbers increased, then, at 50%, 75% and 100%, they decreased gradually. To these results, we can say that there are both major and minor components in BG11 and 25% of municipal wastewater. They support growth of C. zofingiensis. Also, 25% WW maintained the addition support for its growth by means of its extra trace element content. But, when concentration of WW increased, the major component content such as N, C, P and S disrupted, formed stress factors and decreased growth of C. zofingiensis. Kinetic parameter plots of C. zofingiensis cultivated in WW were given in Fig. 1 ."
10,The effect of IAA on C. Zofingiensis,"3.2 The effect of IAA on C. Zofingiensis Chlorella sp. has an important industrial value in wastewater treatment because it maintains fast growth, decomposes toxicity of wastewater and has powerful component uptake [37]. Microalgae can be grown in various wastewaters. Leite et al [38] used piggery wastewater for treatment in Brazil. High amount of biomass (1 g/L) from Chlorella sorokiniana was obtained in piggery wastewater. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus were grown in swine wastewater. In addition to usefulness of municipal wastewater for microalgal growth, we studied a plant derivative hormone called as IAA on C. zofingiensis. Microalgae were cultivated in different concentrations (20, 40, 80 and 120 µM) of IAA. 25% WW was used as control in this study. While concentrations of IAA were rising, absorbance, dry weight and cell numbers of C. zofingiensis were also increased. The highest absorbance, dry weight and cell numbers values of C. zofingiensis were 2.05, 2.8 g/L and 9.1 × 106 cells / mL at 80 µM of IAA. IAA probably causes changes of growth cycle of microalgae. Synthesis of macromolecules such as carbohydrate, protein and lipid generally forms in pre-commitment period. This situation produces high amount of biomass and cell structures [39] and IAA affects C. zofingiensis positively. Kinetic parameter plots of C. zofingiensis cultivated in IAA were shown in Fig. 2 ."
11,Calculation of kinetic parameters of C. Zofingiensis,"3.3 Calculation of kinetic parameters of C. Zofingiensis IAA is linked to microalgae’s metabolism. So, when IAA content increased, macromolecules such as carbohydrate, protein and lipid of microorganisms can change positively or negatively according to the effects of stress conditions. In our study, IAA affected growth of microalgae positively and more biomass means more biofuel. At the previous study, IAA was produced in Scenedesmus obliquus UTEX 393 and it was affected by illuminances. Carbon amounts and light were important for specific growth rate (SGR) [40]. Also, different concentrations of (10-5 M with 17.7 × 106 cells/ mL) IAA increased lipid content of Scenedesmus obliquus [41]. In this study, we calculated biomass kinetic parameters such as concentration, productivity, SGR and doubling time of C. zofingiensis at various concentrations of municipal wastewater. 25% WW had the highest biomass concentration (2.33 g/L), biomass productivity (0.33 g L-1d-1), SGR (5.92 d-1) and doubling time (0.118 d). Parameters of IAA were higher values than those of WW. 80 and 120 µM of IAA showed higher kinetic values than those of 20, 40 and control. 80 µM showed the most effective biomass concentration (2.77 g/L), productivity (0.395 g L-1d-1), SGR (5.91 d-1) and DT (0.117 d). Biomass kinetic parameter values of C. zofingiensis grown in WW and IAA were given in Table 1 ."
12,Determination of photosynthetic pigments,"3.4 Determination of photosynthetic pigments Photosynthesis maintains energy input and presents carbon sources for life. Major photosynthetic pigments are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids. Carotenoids generally occur at high amounts of stress conditions. To support growth, we monitored chlorophyll a, b content and calculated PPC, stress index, Chl (a + b) and Chl (a/b) values. 25% WW had the highest chlorophyll a value with 61.9 mg/L. Chlorophyll a value gradually decreased as wastewater amount increased. Control, 50%, 75% and 100% WW displayed 56.2, 52.4, 48.3 and 44.7 mg/L of chlorophyll a concentration, respectively. IAA 80 and 120 had the maximum highest chlorophyll a value with nearly 68 mg/L among them. Chlorophyll a values of IAA 20 and 40 were 63.2 and 65.5 mg/L. Chlorophyll b results of control (27.3 mg/L) and 25% WW (26.6 mg/L) were similar. IAA 80 and 120 showed same and the highest value with 28.4 mg/L for chlorophyll b. PPC value increased as concentration of wastewater was rising. The highest PPC was 22.2 mg/L at 100% WW. 25% WW had 10.2 mg/L for PPC. The PPC values of C. zofingiensis grown in IAA were 9.2, 8.9, 8.5 and 8.6 mg/ L for 20, 40, 80 and 120 µM, respectively. Then, in FPBR, we followed stress index. 100% WW led to the maximum stress with 1.44. IAA 80 and IAA 120 had the lowest stress index with 0.36. We made further analysis about the relationship between pigment concentrations and bio-product yields under different conditions. Rubisco activities of microalgae samples greatly supported the chlorophyll a results. IAA 80 and IAA 120 showed the highest rubisco enzyme activity with 120 ± 6.7 and 117 ± 8.9%, respectively. When we take results from whole frame in detail, we can emphasize that chlorophyll a, b values and rubisco activities increased and PPC and stress index decreased while contents of WW were decreased and concentrations of IAA were increased. Pigment analysis results of C. zofingiensis were given in Table 2 ."
13,Determination of macromolecules of C. Zofingiensis,"3.5 Determination of macromolecules of C. Zofingiensis Later, we researched carbohydrate and protein content of C. zofingiensis at municipal wastewater and IAA concentrations. The highest carbohydrate and protein concentrations were 0.66 and 0.81 g/L, respectively, at 25% WW. When WW content increased, carbohydrate content diminished step by step. The lowest carbohydrate (0.28 g/L) and protein content (0.37 g/L) were found at 100% WW. The plots were drawn in Fig. 3 . At various concentrations of IAA, carbohydrate and protein content changed increasingly until 80 µM and remained as stable at 120 µM. At 80 µM, carbohydrate and protein content of microalgae were 0.96 and 1.1 g/L. The lowest contents were obtained at 20 µM with 0.74 and 0.92 g/L. The effects of IAA on carbohydrate and protein contents were given in Fig. 4 . Next, we investigated percentages of metabolic compounds such as carbohydrate and protein of C. zofingiensis grown in WW and IAA. 80 IAA and 25% WW had the highest carbohydrate with 34.2%. Carbohydrate concentration increased from 23.9 to 34.2% compare to control. At various concentrations of IAA, Protein percentage increased gradually until IAA 120. IAA 120 indicated that percentage of its protein was 39.9%. The results were given in Table 3 ."
14,"Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde content (MDA)","3.6 Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde content (MDA) SOD and CAT chemical systems have one of the most significant protective systems to decrease excess reactive oxygen leading to reactive oxygen species to for microalgae defence system and it functions as an indicator of ROS production [42]. To check stress factor effects, we carried out antioxidant enzyme activities of WW and IAA on C. zofingiensis. SOD, CAT, MDA and GSH indicated that our results are an indicator for the changes of the metabolic compounds of C. zofingiensis. In WW, SOD and CAT firstly remain stable, then, they slightly increased towards 100% WW. The highest SOD and CAT activities were 72.33 U/mL and 0.76 U/mL, respectively, for 100% WW. On the contrary, MDA and GSH had an inverse fluctuation. MDA was 3.67 and 2.40 for control group and 100% WW when GSH was 3.23 and 4.03 respectively. Concentrations of IAA had similar behaviour. The highest SOD and CAT activities were 51.33 U/mL and 0.45 U/mL, respectively, for control group. These results showed that while concentrations of IAA were decreasing and WW contents were increasing, levels of stress factor indicators elevated. Antioxidant enzyme activities of C. zofingiensis were given in Fig. 5 . Nowadays, microalgae have been studied related with antioxidant activities for various goals such as textile, food and environmental industry. C. vulgaris was investigated peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, polyphenol oxidase and glutathione peroxidase. C. vulgaris had high antioxidant facilities. Peroxidase was 0.195 × 10−5 units/ cell peroxidase, 0.04 × 10−5 units/ cell superoxide dismutase, 0.26 × 10−5 units/ polyphenol oxidase and 0.025 × 10−5 units/ glutathione peroxidase [43]. Superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione redox status were examined during three different irradiance regimes on 15 different microalgae strains and they showed that glutathione redox status had important function in the sensing and regulation system related with photo-induced [44]. Microalgae also were carried out for in vivo studies. Male mice were fed with Scenedesmus obliquus biomass and serum and a few tissues were detected for antioxidant activities. They found that glutathione peroxidase in kidney, the glutathione reductase in liver and antioxidant activities in all tissues increased [45]. Also, microalgae were studied for antioxidant properties in food industry. Fish burgers included 0.5% C. minutissima, 1% I. galbana and 1% Picochlorum sp. had higher texture, sensory and antioxidant facilities compared to control [46]. Microalgae can be used for bioremediation and antioxidant activity can be investigated. Auxenochlorella protothecoides UTEX234 was observed to determine antioxidant enzyme activities and fatty acid profiles in 3 mM Cd stress conditions during various time intervals such as 48 h, 96 h and 168 h. They explained that Mn-dependent SOD and POD contributed to intracellular detoxification under high concentrations of Cd and fatty acid profiles of Auxenochlorella protothecoides UTEX234 changed in 48 h, 96 h and 168 h time intervals [47]. Dao studied Scenedesmus sp.LX1 in modified BG-11 for the effects of IAA and 2, 4, D. High amounts of IAA and 2, 4, D decreased FAME accumulation and they found that optimum concentrations of IAA and 2,4 D were 1 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L for Scenedesmus sp.LX1 [48]. In another study, Dao cultivated microalgae with bacteria and examined co-existing microalgae. Bacteria produced IAA and Scenedesmus sp.LX1 was grown via this secration [49]. Also, various auxins such as gibberellic acid (GA) and cytokinin-kinetin (K) increased biomass percentages (35.94% and 37.37%) of Chlorella sorokiniana, respectively [50]. These studies support our study. It showed that IAA and wastewater caused the formation of stress conditions. They changed antioxidant enzyme activities and carbohydrate contents. In addition to these, antioxidant and catalytic activities of the bio-stabilized colloidal gold nanoparticles stabilized by means of Chlorella vulgaris and Arthospira platensis were carried out. DPPH and hydroxyl assays were used for antioxidant activities. DPPH activity was nearly 60% and hydroxyl scavenging activity approximately was 59%. These results show that Spirulina-stabilized colloidal gold nanoparticles had higher performance compared to chlorella for higher antioxidant and catalytic activities [51]. Scenedesmus sp. was examined for effects of aluminium. For this, oxidative stress was created by aluminium. 0, 10 and 100 µM of aluminium were applied on Scenedesmus sp. 100 µM of aluminium showed that aluminium revealed highest oxidative stress via catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities [52]. Maadane studied antioxidant activities of nine marine microalgae. Various microalgae extracts including ethanol and water were investigated by DPPH scavenging activity. Dunalliela sp., Tetraselmis sp. and N. gaditana had the highest antioxidant activities with ethanol extracts. Also, polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles and total polyphenol content of microalgae extracts changed in this study. They emphasized that these three microalgae can be natural antioxidants [53]."
15,The effect of H2O2 pre-treatment on C. Zofingiensis,"3.7 The effect of H2O2 pre-treatment on C. Zofingiensis Then, we carried out the effect of H2O2 on the extraction of microalgae as pre-treatment procedure. We studied different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8 and 10%) of H2O2 and determined their carbohydrate concentrations. The maximum carbohydrate concentration was 0.96 g/L at H2O2 4%. Carbohydrate concentration reached to saturation point at 8% and 10% of H2O2 with 0.96 and 0.95 g/L respectively. The effect of H2O2 on extraction of microalgae was given in Fig. 6 . Microalgae cell wall structure includes pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose. These structures bring about difficult disruption for extraction of microalgae. So, pre-treatment procedures are very significant. Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and acetic acid and combined heating led to disruption of cell wall and easily releasing of cellulose and starch in sugar [54]. Pre-treatment procedures can change from microalgae to other one. Microwave method is suitable for Scenedesmus and Botryococcus to obtain high metabolic content. But, Chlorella has liquid nitrogen extraction procedure to get maximum carbohydrate and lipid [55]. In conclusion, H2O2 (4%) maintained maximum carbohydrate percentage for C. zofingiensis."
16,Bio-butanol production,"3.8 Bio-butanol production Lastly, after sugar content, we converted sugar to bio-butanol and bio-butanol content was calculated. There are few studies in the literature related with bio-butanol production. C. acetobutylicum had 1.5% (v/v) for bio-butanol tolerance [56]. Cebreiros et al. [57] examined bio-butanol production from eucalyptus sawdust by means of Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423 and bio-butanol yield was 0.15 gbutanol/gsugar. The general ratio of bio-butanol production is 3:6:1 (ABE). In bio-butanol production, by products can inhibit process at fermentation stage. In pre-treatment procedure, weak acids and phenolic compounds can lead to inhibition of fermentation procedure [58]. So, H2O2 pre-treatment is important for the fermentation. Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum was studied by Ellis. ABE production and yield and productivity were 0.3 g butanol/gsugar and 0.1 g/L/h, respectively [59]. In our study, while Bio-butanol content was 3.1 g/L and 0.062 g/g biomass for control, IAA 80 & 25% WW had 4.2 g/L and 0.084 g/g biomass of bio-butanol content. Efficiency values of bio-butanol were given in Table 4 . These results indicate that bio-butanol got from C. zofingiensis was nearly 35% higher compared to control. It can be achieved from the our study that C. zofingiensis cultivated in IAA 80 µM, 4% H2O2 and 25% wastewater can be performed for high amount of bio-butanol production."
17,Conclusion,"This study demonstrated that Chlorella zofingiensis had maximum biomass content and bio-butanol yield at 25% wastewater, IAA 80 µM and 4% H2O2 in a flat-photobioreactor. At these conditions, carbohydrate concentration increased from 23.9 to 34.2% compare to control. Maximum biomass concentration and bio-butanol content were 2.77 g/L and 0.084 g of bio-butanol/g of microalgal biomass, respectively. It corresponds to an increase of 35%. IAA and wastewater caused the formation of stress conditions and changed antioxidant enzyme activities and carbohydrate contents. This can be new challenge for production of high amounts of bio-butanol after membrane filtration technology develops for the removal of contaminants such as bacteria and fungi."
