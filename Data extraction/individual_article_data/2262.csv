0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the search for new and renewable clean energy sources continues due to the decrease in fossil fuels and their harmful effects on the environment. Hydrogen still attracts attention as an environmentally friendly clean energy source. Ca2H, LiH, NaBH4, MgH2, LiAlH4 and NH3BH3 are highly suitable metal and chemical hydrides for hydrogen generation [1–4]. NaBH4 is the most used because of its high hydrogen storage capacity (10.8 wt%), stability in alkaline solution, pure hydrogen generation and easy re-production from by-products. In addition, it is a non-toxic, non-flammable, economically feasible and environmentally friendly. The hydrolysis of NaBH4 is an exothermic reaction and NaBH4 generates hydrogen two-fold more than its content at the end of reaction (NaBH4 + 2H2O → Catalyst NaBO2 + 4H2). Although platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium noble metals are widely used as catalysts due to their excellent catalytic activity, their rarities and the resulting high-cost are led to the development of alternative low-cost catalysts. Cobalt based catalysts having low-cost are attractive due to active redox chemistry and a wide range of oxidation states for NaBH4 hydrolysis reactions [2,3,5–8]. However, metal catalysts without support may experience aggregation, which led to the formation of low-surface area. The activity of many catalysts is mostly dependent on particle size and degree of dispersion. The aggregation problem can be overcome by the using of support materials such as zeolite, clay, carbon, silica, alumina, aerogel and hydrogel [9–11]. Support materials provide good dispersion, small particle size, high surface area (these properties contribute adequate interaction with the reactant) and the use of lower amount of catalytic active component [5,7,12–15]. Especially silica-based materials are important as support materials due to its high hydrothermal stability, controllable morphology and high surface area [16,17]. Silica xerogels attract attention as support materials due to their unique properties such as high specific surface area, high porosity and low density [18,19]. In addition to the excellent properties of xerogels, pore shrinkage and structure collapses may be occur due to drying under atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the various organic groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or phenyl are used to create more stable materials and control of various structural parameters in the xerogel synthesis [19,20–22]. In study performed by Dudas et al. [19], methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) together with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have been used for the improving of structural properties of silica xerogels. Increase in MTES amount has been revealed significant skeletal variations. They also stated that MTES has a strong effect on the inorganic silica matrix. Li et al. [22] stated that trialkoxysilanes hybrid xerogels could be synthesized without any solvent change. The obtained hybrid xerogels exhibited rather low density, high porosity, superhydrophobicity, low thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical robustness. In the present study, cobalt-based catalysts supported over silica xerogel were synthesized by using sol–gel method. Amine modification was used to prevent structural collapse, increase the interaction between silica-cobalt and functionalize of catalyst surface. The effect of modification and calcination treatment on the structural properties, hydrogen generation rate and activation energy were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetraetylortosilicate (TEOS, 98%), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, 98%), hydrochloride acid (37%), ammonia (25%), cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 99%) and ethyl alcohol (99.9%) were used in catalysts synthesis. And also sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were used in hydrogen generation experiment. Chemicals were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck. All experiments were performed by using deionized water."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The cobalt loaded silica xerogel catalysts were prepared by sol–gel method followed by ambient pressure drying. Synthesis procedure was obtained by modification of the method used in some literature studies [23,24]. First synthesis route: 7 mL TEOS was dissolved in 15 mL ethyl alcohol-water mixture (1:1). At this step, CoCl2·6H2O (Co/Si molar ratio: 0.05) was added to the synthesis solution. Afterwards, 1 M HCl was added until the pH value of solution became 2 and mixture was stirred for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of 1 h, 0.6 M ammonia solution was put into mixture as much as the amount of used HCl. As soon as ammonia was added, the mixture was immediately taken to a teflon-lined autoclave and was kept at 80 °C for 2 days. The resulting solid gel was dried at room temperature. A part of each dried catalyst was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h. The catalysts were coded as Co@X-T-UC and Co@X-T-C (X: xerogel support, T: TEOS, UC: uncalcine and C: calcine). Second synthesis route: This synthesis route was performed by using APTES together with TEOS. In the synthesis, APTES/TEOS molar ratio was taken as 1/20 and TEOS and APTES were put simultaneously into beaker. The mixture was dissolved in 15 mL ethyl alcohol-water mixture (1:1). Other synthesis steps were applied same as first synthesis route. The catalysts were denoted as Co@X-TA-UC and Co@X-TA-C (X: xerogel support, T: TEOS, A: APTES, UC: uncalcine and C: calcine)."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Smart Lab powder diffractometer using a CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 0.01° step width and 1.5 deg/min scan speed in the 10° < 2θ < 90° range. Quanthrocrome®IQ-Chemi instrument was used to measure nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C after degassing the sample for 3 h at 120 °C. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area was calculated using adsorption data in P/Po value of 0.05–0.30. External surface area and micropore volume values were estimated from t-plots. Total pore volume and mesopore + micropore volume were determined at the relative pressure P/Po of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. The mesopore volume was found by subtracting micropore volume from mesopore + micropore volume. The pore size distributions were analyzed by Saito-Foley (SF) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods in the micropore and mesopore region, respectively [25]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were performed on a JEM JEOL 2100F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV model. TEM grids were prepared by drop casting an aliquot of sample-ethanol suspension onto a carbon-coated copper grid and air-dried before analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectras were recorded on a Specs Esca spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (excitation energy: 1486.71 eV, spot size: 200 μm, pass energy: 100 eV) and binding energies were calibrated using the C 1 s peak (284.8 eV) as a reference. Measurements were taken in the binding energy range of 0–1200 eV, with a binding energy scan of 1.0 eV. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectras of catalysts were recorded on a Thermo Scientific/Nicolet IS50 instrument (source: PolarisTM long life IR, detector: DLaTGS, resolution: < 0.09 cm−1). Before analysis, samples were dried at 105 °C for 1 day and 1 mg of dried samples was diluted ~ 100 mg of KBr. FTIR data were collected with 0.5 cm−1 increment in the wavelength range of 400–4000 cm−1."
5,Catalytic performance of catalysts,"2.4 Catalytic performance of catalysts In the hydrolysis reaction of NaBH4, the mixture including 5 mL water, 1.0 wt% NaBH4 and 1.0 wt% NaOH was poured into a batch reactor and 30 mg catalyst was inserted to reaction solution. Reaction experiments were performed at 25 °C and generated hydrogen volume was measured by a classical water displacement method. The measurements were performed by taking three successive steady state data points. The hydrogen generation rate was calculated from the slope of the volume-time plot in the linear region by using following equation (1): HGR = V / t m (1) where HGR: hydrogen generation rate (mL.min−1.gcat −1), V: generated hydrogen volume (mL), t : time (min) and m: weight of the catalyst (g). The effect of different concentrations of NaBH4 (1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 wt%) and different reaction temperatures (25, 35 and 45 °C) was investigated for the catalyst with highest HGR (Co@X-TA-C). Rate constant and activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction were calculated from Arrhenius equation (2): lnk = l n A - E A / R T (2) where k, A, EA, R and T are rate constant, pre-exponential factor, activation energy, ideal gas constant and reaction temperature, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,X-ray diffraction patterns,"3.1 X-ray diffraction patterns XRD patterns of catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 1 . All catalysts presented broad amorphous silica peaks in the range of 20.0°-30.0° [26]. On the other hand, no obvious crystalline phases of cobalt species were seen in all cases from diffraction patterns possibly due to their high dispersion in the depths of amorphous silica or their small crystallite from [27,28,29]. Yan et al. [28] declared that, the amorphous phase of cobalt species possessing much more structure distortion and holding much more catalytic active sites as compared with its crystalline counterpart."
8,Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms,"3.2 Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms As seen from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, all catalysts exhibited Type IV isotherm type indicating the presence of mesoporous structure according to IUPAC classification (Fig. 2 ). The catalysts except the Co@X-T-C catalyst showed H2 hysteresis type which is characteristic to randomly arranged, ink-bottle shaped pores (Fig. 2a, c and d) while Co@X-T-C catalyst exhibited H4 type hysteresis which is characteristic for slit shaped pores (Fig. 2b) [19,25]. While the hysteresis loops were observed at relative pressure range of 0.40–0.78 for the catalysts synthesized using only TEOS, the hysteresis loops shifted to higher relative pressure value (P/Po = 0.96) for the catalysts with APTES and TEOS. The surface area, pore volume and pore diameter values of catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The BET surface area of uncalcined and calcined catalysts synthesized by using only TEOS were determined as 501 and 752 m2/g, respectively. After APTES modification of these catalysts, the surface area values were obtained as 552 and 591 m2/g, respectively. The calcination treatment caused an increase in the surface area value. Total pore volume values of Co@X-T-UC and Co@X-TA-UC catalysts were found as 0.330 and 0.688 cm3/g, respectively. The use of APTES resulted in an increase of all pore volume values except micropore volume value. APTES modification improved especially mesopore volume by providing a positive effect on mesopore by both interacting strongly with TEOS and changing the pH of the sol–gel [21]. The micropore volume of Co@X-T-C was obtained higher than the other catalysts and high micropore led to the obtaining of high surface area. Generally, the calcination which led to the opening of pores caused an increase in all pore volumes [29]. Mesopore and micropore size distribution of catalysts are given in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. All catalysts indicated uniform pore size distribution and narrow peak reflects in the mesopore region within the size range of 3–4 nm (Fig. 3). While the catalysts with APTES showed a sharp reflects, the catalysts synthesized by using only TEOS a non-sharp reflects. The hysteresis loop shifted to the higher relative pressure value in the catalysts with APTES and resulted in a slight increase in the pore diameter (Fig. 3c and d). All catalysts exhibited non-uniform pore size distribution in the micropore region within the size range of 0.7–2.0 nm (Fig. 4). In the present study, synthesized catalysts were compared with some literature studies. Shi et al. [6] obtained graphene modified Co-B catalysts having the surface area of 67.1 m2/g and pore diameter of 0.105 cm3/g. Li et al. [15] synthesized nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles. The highest surface area was obtained as 124.5 m2/g. Brum et al. [30] obtained silica xerogels having very low surface area (2.92 m2/g) and pore volume (0.012 cm3/g). They stated that, the aging time and pH affect the texture, morphology and mesoporous structure properties of the obtained silica material. In the study performed by Barczak and Borowski [21], the specific surface area and pore volume of silica xerogel have been determined as 355 m2/g and 1.00 cm3/g, respectively. In the study conducted by Liu et al. [31], it has been synthesized the cobalt-incorporated silica xerogels having specific surface areas of ~ 240 m2/g and total pore volumes of ~ 0.12 cm3/g. The pore size diameter increased from ~ 1.7 nm to ~ 2.5 nm with the increasing of cobalt loading amount. In this current study, it was obtained catalysts having better textural properties. The higher surface area provides more active sites for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride."
9,TEM image and EDX analysis,"3.3 TEM image and EDX analysis TEM image of Co@X-TA-C catalyst showed the presence of a quite porous structure. Darker dots showed cobalt particles and lighter regions the silica structure of xerogel. It was observed that cobalt settled into the support as tiny particles having different sizes (<4 nm), however small aggregation formed in some places. (Fig. 5 a). The EDX spectrum of the Co@X-TA-C catalyst clearly showed the presence of Si, O and Co (Fig. 5b). Co/Si molar ratio in the solid was determined as 0.02 from EDX analysis (Table 1). The mean particle size of catalyst was estimated approximately 4.5 nm (Fig. 5c). The smaller particle size is mostly favored for hydrolysis reaction."
10,XPS analysis,"3.4 XPS analysis XPS survey scan and core-level spectra of Co2p, O1s and Si2p of catalysts are given in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. The located peaks at 102.8 and 152.4 eV were assigned to characteristic Si2p and Si2s orbitals, respectively. The observed peak at 532.5 eV was attributed to O1s [26]. The peaks related with cobalt were obtained in the range of 760–820 eV (Fig. 6). This clearly revealed the formation of SiO2 and cobalt species in cobalt-silica xerogel, consistent with EDX findings. For the Co@X-TA-C catalyst, the Co/Si molar ratio in solid was determined as 0.02 by XPS analysis. This was consistent with the amount determined by EDX analysis (Table 1). The peaks seen from core-level spectra of Co2p (3/2 and 1/2 levels) were assigned to three cobalt species corresponding to Coo, Co2+ and Co3+. The peaks at around 778 and 796 eV showed the presence of elemental cobalt in the zerovalent state (Coo) [29,32]. The obtained peaks at ~ 782, 787 and 802 eV (Fig. 7) were assigned to Co2+ and Co3+ corresponding with CoO, Co2O3, Co3O4, Co(OH)2 oxidized forms of cobalt [15,28,29,33]. In the study conducted by Lendzion-Bieluń et al. [34] it has been stated that the use of ammonia and cobalt nitrate salt caused the formation of cobalt hydroxide. The formation of metallic cobalt might be related to the use of ammonia in the synthesis step. Li et al. [35] used hydrazine as a boron-free reductant in the presence of triethylenetetramine for synthesis of cobalt film. Cobalt species in the resulted film have been obtained as metallic cobalt phases."
11,FTIR analysis,"3.5 FTIR analysis FTIR spectras of catalysts are given in Fig. 8 . The typical vibrations of silica were obtained in all catalysts in the 400–1400 cm−1. The observed band at 461 cm−1 was assigned to Si–O–Si tetrahedral silica stretching vibration band and also 541 cm−1 to the vibration of Si–O–M (M: metal species, here it is Co metal). The bands at 793 cm−1 and 1085 cm−1 were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si bands, respectively. While the intensities of peaks at 461 cm−1, 793 cm−1 and 1085 cm−1 decreased with calcination, they increased with APTES modification. This increase might be due to additional Si–O–Si and Si–OH bands originated from APTES. The obtained band at ~ 951 cm−1 was due to both the stretching vibration of Si–O groups to metal species and pure silica which was referred to as the vibration of silanol groups (Si–OH) [26,36]. The intensity of this band, which was more pronounced in uncalcined catalysts, it decreased in the presence of APTES and a shoulder formed [37]. The strong peak at 1630 cm−1 was assigned to the O–H bending vibration of adsorbed molecular water. This peak was also due to the N–H bending vibration which indicated the presence of primary amine groups in catalysts with APTES [38]. Ramasamy et al. [39], APTES-modified silica gels subjected to a calcination process at 400 °C and stated that the nitrogen from APTES remained in the structure. Similarly, it was thought that nitrogen remained in structure in the present study. This peak weakened by the removal of adsorbed molecular water from the structure during the calcination treatment [39]. The large band centered at around 3415 cm−1 between 3700 and 3000 cm−1 was ascribed both to the presence of isolated/hydrogen-bonded silanol groups (Si–OH) and/or water molecule hydroxyl groups [40]. It was observed that a noticeable decrease in intensity of this band when catalysts were calcined. This behavior is related to the removal of –OH groups from structure during the calcination [39]. In addition, the bands corresponding to the stretching of N–H modes normally located in the region of 3300–3500 cm−1, could not be observed due to the presence of this large band. This large band was highly broaden for catalysts modified with APTES, and this situation was ascribed to N–H stretching [38,41]."
12,Catalytic performances,"3.6 Catalytic performances The hydrogen generation volume and hydrogen generation rate of catalysts are given in Fig. 9 . The catalysts with APTES exhibited higher hydrogen generation volume and rate at 25 °C compared to the catalysts synthesized in the presence of only TEOS (Fig. 9a and b, Table 2 ). The highest HGR value (100.7 mL.min−1.gcat −1) was obtained for Co@X-TA-C catalyst. It is known that APTES containing terminal primary amine has a clear positive effect on the catalytic activity. Gil-San-Millan et al. [42] prepared amine functionalized palladium catalysts for hydrolysis of ammonium borane. They stated that a hydrogen bond between the lone pair of the amine functionalized catalysts and the hydrogen of − NH3 on ammonium borane can modify the distribution of charges, which leads to the acceleration of the ammonium borane dehydrogenation. In the study of Demirci et al. [43], amine functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles have been tested in methanolysis of NaBH4 for hydrogen generation. It has been declared that, the higher the numbers of amine functional groups on particle surface the better the catalytic activity. The functionalized nanoparticles catalyzed methanolysis reaction by interacting with the protonated amine groups on the catalyst via formed complex by the borate anion. Then, this complex released H2 and active borane or borine (BH3) which reacts easily and rapidly with methanol to form CH3O − BH2 molecule. In the present study, the calcination treatment promoted larger pore size, higher pore volume and smaller particle size (Table 1). Naturally, larger pore size and higher pore volume facilitated efficient diffusion of BH4 − generated from NaBH4 ion to pores of catalyst [29]. Co-B, which is formed by the interaction between cobalt species and generated BH4 − molecules, contributed greatly to the release of hydrogen. The hydrogen generation rate for the catalyst synthesized using only TEOS and calcined (Co@X-T-C) was obtained lower than other catalysts (19.2 mL.min−1.gcat −1). In this catalyst, hydrogen production was not observed within the first 40 min, but hydrogen production started to increase suddenly after an induction time of 40 min. At the end of 240 min, achieved hydrogen generation yield was around 87.7% [1] (Fig. 9a, Table 2). It was thought that this behavior might be due to the high micropore volume and narrow pore diameter values of catalyst. In this case, mass transfer of NaBH4 solution to the catalyst pores might be limited and therefore hydrogen generation rate decreased. The effect of NaBH4 concentration on the hydrogen generation was investigated for Co@X-TA-C catalyst having highest HGR. The hydrogen generation volume increased by increasing of the concentration of NaBH4 from 1.0 to 1.8 wt%, while the hydrogen generation rate decreased (Fig. 10 ). It has been stated that in literature studies, increasing NaBH4 concentration increases the viscosity and alkalinity of the solution. Because of these two factors, mass transfer of NaBH4 onto the catalyst surface is limited. The decrease in the number of Brønsted acid sites and surface functional groups due to the increased alkalinity of the solution at high NaBH4 concentrations has been indicated as the cause of decrease in the reaction rate [32,44–46]. The effect of temperature on the hydrogen generation of Co@X-TA-C catalyst is given in Fig. 11 a and results are tabulated Table 3 . While the increase of temperature did not change the hydrogen generation volume, HGR values significantly increased from 100.7 to 133.7 mL.min−1.gcat−1 [6,47]. The kinetic investigations performed at various temperatures showed reaction was zero-order. Therefore, it could be said that the reaction proceeds independent of the reactant concentration. Although the reaction is independent of reactant concentration, low reactant concentration in the reaction media prevents both the exothermic reaction that occurs in the system from the increasing of temperature by generating excess heat and the high NaBO2 concentration. The Arrhenius plot of lnk versus 1/T is showed in Fig. 11b. EA value for the NaBH4 hydrolysis over the Co@X-TA-C catalyst was found as 15.2 kJ/mol. In the present study, observed EA value was lower than the previously reported values for Co-based catalysts (Table 4 )."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, cobalt silica-xerogel catalysts having different structural properties were synthesized via sol–gel method to be used in hydrolysis of NaBH4. Different structural properties of catalysts have created different effects on hydrogen generation rate. The physical properties of the catalysts were more effective on the hydrogen generation rate. Because different forms of cobalt were observed in all catalysts. The highest hydrogen generation rate and lowest activation energy was obtained in the Co@X-TA-C catalyst as 101 mL.min−1.gcat −1 and 15.2 kJ.mol−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The obtained activation energy value is very advantageous because it is lower than many catalysts in the literature. On the other hand, the Co@X-T-C catalyst generated a lower rate of hydrogen release as compared with Co@X-TA-C catalyst. These differences in the hydrogen release may be an alternative for different application areas and hydrogen generation rate can be controlled by increasing the temperature. It is thought that long-term continuous hydrogen release may be possible with the use of silica xerogel support material."
