0,Introduction,"The geochemistry of stable hydrogen isotopes has interesting and useful applications in investigating the origin of geofluids and related geological processes. Hydrogen plays a major direct or indirect role in numerous geological processes through reactions that involve a range of oxidation states in H2O, H3O+, OH−, H2 and hydrocarbons; in addition, hydrogen exhibits the largest variation in stable isotopic ratios of all elements due to it having the largest mass difference between two stable isotopes (Hoefs, 2009). Hydrocarbons, including oil and gas, are an important hydrogen carrier in the upper crust. Its gaseous accumulations are discovered in sedimentary basins, submarine hydrothermal venting systems, and even hydrothermal springs derived from ophiolites (Schoell, 1983, 1988; Proskurowski et al., 2008). The gases have been attributed to thermal decomposition of organic matter (thermogenesis), microbial processes or abiogenic geological processes such as Fischer-Tropsch type reactions (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Proskurowski et al., 2008). The wide range of hydrogen isotopic compositions of gaseous hydrocarbons is determined by disparate generation processes, different source rocks and degrees of thermal maturity, the mixing of geofluids during their migration and accumulation, as well as further chemical evolution in reservoirs (Schoell, 1983; Jenden et al., 1993; Dai et al., 2004; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002, 2008; Milkov and Dzou, 2007; Strąpoć et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2014, 2019). In the Lower Triassic red beds with current depths of >3.5 km in the Junggar Basin of Northwest China, the thermochemical oxidation of hydrocarbon (TOH) induced by high-valence Mn/Fe oxides has been confirmed. This is supported by the abundant occurrence of hematites containing Fe3+ and Mn3+/4+ in the strata, extremely negative δ13C values (−70 to −22.5‰) of calcite cements and their high Mn contents (average MnO = 5.17 ± 3.48%), as well as the absence of evidence for microbial degradation of hydrocarbons (Hu et al., 2018). Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the TOH reactions involving water proceed sequentially, and produce alkenes, alcohols, ketones, and organic acids as intermediaries; then organic acids undergo decarboxylation and/or oxidation to form CO2 and shorter chain hydrocarbons (Seewald, 2001, 2003). During the reactions, the alkene-mediated H exchange between alkanes and water proceeds continuously, especially in oxidizing conditions like the red beds (Reeves et al., 2012). Therefore, TOH induced by high-valence Mn/Fe oxides may alter the hydrogen isotopic composition of gaseous hydrocarbons, but this prediction requires verification. Most studies to date have shown that TOH reactions in the earth's crust are consistent with thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR; Krouse et al., 1988; Worden and Smalley, 1996) or the reduction of high-valence Mn/Fe in oxides or silicate minerals such as biotite (Mullis et al., 1994; Tarantola et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2018). Only limited literature has reported the effects of TSR on the hydrogen isotopes of short-chain alkanes in gas accumulations within carbonate strata (Liu et al., 2014). The study found that, as TSR proceeded within the marine carbonate reservoirs in the Sichuan Basin, China, the hydrogen isotopes of ethane became much heavier, whereas the δ2H values of methane did not increase significantly (Liu et al., 2014). The impact of TOH induced by Mn/Fe oxides on the hydrogen isotopic compositions of alkane gases remains unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of TOH induced by high-valence Mn/Fe oxides on the hydrogen isotopes of light hydrocarbon gases, and to decipher related reaction process in deeply buried clastic strata. We collected 10 oil-associated gas samples from the producing wells in the conglomeratic beds with a depth of 3800–3900 m in the Mahu Sag, Junggar Basin. The gas molecular compositions, stable hydrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of gaseous alkanes, as well as carbon isotopes of CO2 in the gases were analyzed. Combined with the published gas compositions and carbon isotopes of the gases produced from source rocks (Tao et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018), the critical factors causing the reversals can be discerned from the different source rocks, maturities, and the TOH processes. The gas compositions and isotopic data also provide us with an approach for deciphering key mechanisms of the TOH reactions, such as the reaction sequence of C1 and C2+ alkanes, and the role of formation water. The specific questions being addressed in this paper are: (1) How can the effects of maturity and TOH reactions on alkane gases be distinguished based on compositional and isotopic data? (2) Were the hydrogen isotopic reversals of alkane gases caused by the TOH reactions in the oil-gas reservoirs? (3) Do the stable isotopic compositions of alkane gases and CO2 help to reveal the reaction sequence of C1 and C2+ alkanes during the TOH induced by Mn/Fe oxides?"
1,Geological settings,
2,Sedimentary background,"2.1 Sedimentary background The Junggar Basin is located in the northern part of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, NW China (Fig. 1a), and lies at the junction of the Siberia, Kazakstan, and Tarim blocks. The Mahu Sag is situated in the northwestern part of the Junggar Basin, and covers an area of about 4800 km2 (Fig. 1a). Within the sag, Carboniferous and Permian strata are distributed across the entire region, and the thickness of the Triassic to Cretaceous strata gradually decreases from the depocenter towards the marginal thrust faults. From west to east, the depth of the Lower Triassic Baikouquan Formation (T1 b) gradually increases from 2800 m to 4400 m, and its thickness increases from 70 m to 180 m (Fig. 2 ). The T1 b Formation unconformably overlies the Upper Permian Wuerhe Formation, and is conformably overlain by the Middle Triassic Karamay Formation (T2 k; Fig. 1b). The T1 b Formation consists of interlayered brown mudstone and brown or greyish green sandy conglomerate, deposited in a succession of alluvial fan-deltaic systems (Kang et al., 2019). The thickness of brown mudstone in the three members of T1 b increases upwards. Abundant high-valence Fe/Mn oxides occur in T1 b, with hematite disseminated mainly in the clay-rich matrix or in the matrix of sandstones and conglomerates (Hu et al., 2018). These high-valence Fe/Mn oxides are the electron acceptors for the oxidation of hydrocarbon."
3,Petroleum geological outline,"2.2 Petroleum geological outline The study area hosts three sets of hydrocarbon-producing source rocks. The deepest source rocks in the Carboniferous (C, average total organic carbon centent, TOC = 1.2%) and Lower Permian Jiamuhe Formation (P1 j, average TOC = 1.5%), contain Type-III kerogen, and have a high maturity at present (vitrinite reflectance, Ro = 0.7–2.2%), which makes them favorable for gas generation (Cao et al., 2005). The Lower Permian Fengcheng Formation (P1 f) source rocks are mature to highly mature (Ro = 0.5–2.0%), with an average TOC of 1.3%, and mainly Type-II kerogen. These rocks are productive sources of oil (Cao et al., 2005) and could generate large amounts of oil-associated gas in the study area. The Middle Permian Lower Wuerhe Formation (P2 w) source rocks, with high TOC values (1.5%), are also mature (Ro = 0.5–1.8%) and are dominated by Type-III kerogen (Tao et al., 2016). Their potential for gas generation is limited due to low maturity. During the past ten years, five large reservoirs of light oil (>100 Mt) were discovered in the sandy conglomerates of the T1 b Formation, with maximum oil and gas production of 48.6 t/day and 6900 m3/day, respectively (Kuang et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2019). Natural gas exists in the reservoirs as the associated gas of oil. Oil and gas in the T1 b reservoirs were generated mainly in the Fengcheng Formation (P1 f) source rocks (Fig. 1b; Wang and Kang, 1999; Cao et al., 2005), and the T1 b reservoir rocks were petroleum-charged during the Early Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Qi et al., 2015). The oil and gas migrated directly from the P1 f Formation into the T1 b Formation along steeply dipping faults, and then migrated through high-permeability sandy conglomerate units in the reservoir strata (Fig. 1c; Kuang et al., 2014). During the burial history, the depth of the T1 b Formation generally increased, as tectonic activities have never resulted in significant uplift since the Early Triassic (Qi et al., 2015). The thermal evolution of the T1 b Formation is indicated by its burial history and geothermal gradient. During the first period of hydrocarbon charging in the Early Jurassic, the P1 f source rocks evolved into the oil-window stage, with gas generated via the cracking of kerogen, and the T1 b reservoir temperature reached more than 80 °C. During the second hydrocarbon charging of reservoirs in the Early Cretaceous, the P1 f mudstones reached the mature stage, and potentially generated gas by oil-cracking, especially in the deeper parts of the sag area, and meanwhile the T1 b reservoir temperature reached about 135 °C (Fig. 2; Qiu et al., 2002; Cao et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2018)."
4,Samples and methods,"All gas samples were collected from the wellhead in the commercial petroleum production field at the west slope of the Mahu Sag, after flushing the pipelines for 15–20 min to remove air contamination. Double-ended, high-grade stainless steel bottles (10 cm diameter and 1000 cm3 volume), equipped with shut-off valves with a maximum pressure of 22 MPa, were used to collect gas samples. The pressure inside the containers was kept higher than 5 MPa. After collecting gas samples, each sample bottle was immersed in a water bath for leak testing. To analyze the influence of formation water on hydrocarbon gases, three water samples were also collected from the T1 b Formation at the western margin of the study area. The chemical compositions of gas samples were analyzed using a Finnigan MAT-271 mass spectrometer at the Key Laboratory of Gas Geochemistry in Lanzhou Institute of Geology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Concentrations were calculated using a calibration curve obtained from synthetic standard gases. The analytical conditions were as follows: Ion source: EI; electronic energy: 86 eV; mass range: 1–350 amu; resolution: 3000; accelerating voltage: 8 kV; emission: 0.200 mA; vacuum: < 1.0 × 10−7 Pa. The concentrations of gas were calculated in accordance with the measurement procedures for mass spectrometry (State Standard of China GB/T 6041–2002 and GB/T10628–89). Carbon isotope compositions of methane, ethane, propane and CO2 were measured in a Thermo Finnigan DeltaPlus XP mass spectrometer interfaced to an HP 6890 gas chromatograph (GC). Individual alkane components and CO2 were separated on an HP-PLOT Q column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 20 μm) with He as the carrier gas (2 mL/min). The GC oven temperature was elevated from an initial temperature of 35 °C to 80 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, and then to 260 °C at 5 °C/min, at which it was maintained for 10 min. Individual alkane compounds were oxidized into CO2 at 940 °C through a ceramic microreactor, and then examined using the DeltaPlus XP mass spectrometer. Three pulses of standard pure methane and pure CO2 gas, pre-calibrated against interlaboratory recognized references, were injected to the GC-IRMS for calculating the carbon isotopic ratios of specific compounds. The carbon isotopic ratios are reported in per mil (‰) relative to the Vienna Peedee Belemnite (V-PDB), and expressed using the delta (δ) notation: (1) δ 13 C = R sample R standard − 1 × 1000 where δ13C is the carbon isotope signature, R sample and R standard are the measured 13C/12C ratio of sample and the absolute 13C/12C ratio of V-PDB standard. The δ13C values of standard methane and CO2 is −41.8 ± 0.2‰ and − 22.9 ± 0.4‰, respectively. The analytical uncertainty in δ13C is ±0.3‰ (1σ) for C1–C4 alkanes, and ± 0.5‰ (1σ) for CO2. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of the gas samples were measured using a MAT 253 isotope mass spectrometer connected to an HP6890 GC. Chromatographic separation of gas components was achieved using an HP-PLOT Q column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 20 μm), and a helium carrier gas. The analytical conditions for GC were as follows: the column had an initial flow rate of 1.5 ml/min; the gas oven was held constant at 30 °C for 5 min and then programmed to 80 °C at a heating rate of 8 °C/min; it was then heated to 260 °C at a heating rate of 4 °C/min where it was held for 10 min. The conditions of the mass spectrometer analysis were as follows: an electronic ionisation detector (EI), electronic energy of 124 eV, emission current of 1.0 mA, accelerating voltage of 3 kV, mass range of 70. Three pulses of a pre-calibrated pure methane standard were pre-injected to check the system stability. The standard methane was analyzed after every three samples were measured to correct for drift. The hydrogen isotopic values are reported relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (V-SMOW) in per mil (‰), and also expressed as δ notation: (2) δ 2 H = R sample R standard − 1 × 1000 where δ2H is the hydrogen isotope signature, R sample and R standard are the measured 2H/1H ratio of sample and the absolute 2H/1H ratio of V-SMOW standard. The δ2H value of standard methane is −199.4 ± 1.4‰, and the analytical uncertainty in δ2H is better than ±3.0‰ (1σ). Hydrogen isotopic compositions of formation water samples were measured via laser absorption spectrometry on a Los Gatos Research water analyzer (IWA-35EP) following Di Rocco and Pack, 2015. Working standard (GBW04460, national standard substance of China, −144.0 ± 0.8‰) was analyzed together with the samples. The analytical uncertainty is less than ±1.0‰ (1σ) against V-SMOW."
5,Results,
6,Molecular compositions of natural gas,"4.1 Molecular compositions of natural gas The natural gas from the T1 b Formation consists of both hydrocarbon gas and non-hydrocarbon gas. The former is dominant, making up an average of 95.2 ± 2.0% of the total gas (Table 1 ). Among the analyzed samples, the majority are wet gases, with a dryness (C1/∑C1–C5) varying from 0.77 to 0.98 (average = 0.88 ± 0.06). The non-hydrocarbon gases are N2 and CO2, whose contents range from 1.52 to 9.09% and from 0.10 and 1.87%, respectively."
7,Carbon isotopes of hydrocarbon gas and CO2,"4.2 Carbon isotopes of hydrocarbon gas and CO2 The carbon isotopic compositions of hydrocarbon gas are a useful criterion to identify the source rocks, thermal maturity, and even secondary alteration of gas such as biodegradation or TSR reactions (e.g., Schoell, 1983; Krouse et al., 1988; Jenden et al., 1993; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Dai et al., 2004; Milkov and Dzou, 2007; Liu et al., 2013). For the T1 b gas samples, the δ13C values of C1 to C4 alkanes range from −46.8 to −37.1‰, −33.3 to −30.5‰, −34.1 to −27.4‰, −29.4 to −27.5‰, respectively (Table 1). Their average δ13C values (−41.6 ± 2.0‰, −31.3 ± 1.4‰, −30.0 ± 1.9‰, and –28.4 ± 1.2‰, respectively) increase with increasing carbon numbers, following the normal trend for thermogenic gas, i.e., δ13CCH4 < δ13CC2H6 < δ13CC3H8 and < δ13CC4H10. CO2 from the T1 b gases has relatively lower δ13C values, ranging from −29.4 to −20.1‰, compared to the CO2 values in the gas reservoirs undergoing TSR. The δ13C values of TSR–related CO2 range from −22 to −11‰ in the Permian Khuff Formation of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, and from −13 to −4‰ in the Permian and Triassic carbonate strata in the Sichuan Basin of China (Worden and Smalley, 1996; Liu et al., 2013; Jenden et al., 2015)."
8,Hydrogen isotopes of hydrocarbon gas and formation water,"4.3 Hydrogen isotopes of hydrocarbon gas and formation water In the T1 b gases, the δ2H values of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane and i-butane range from −169.7 to −151.2‰, −192.3 to −182.4‰, −185.1 to −170.8‰, −191.5 to −173.1‰, −214.8 to −200.8‰, respectively (Table 1). They display a unique trend of δ2H CH4 > δ2HC2H6 < δ2HC3H8 > δ2Hn-C4H10 > δ2Hi-C4H10. In contrast, the thermogenic gases generally exhibit a gradual increase of δ2H values with increasing carbon number, i.e., δ2HCH4 < δ2HC2H6 < δ2HC3H8 < δ2Hn-C4H10, which is supported by numerous field evidence (e.g., Barker and Pollock, 1984; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2010; Ni et al., 2011, 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Hydrous pyrolysis on kerogens from lacustrine source rocks also exhibit the same trend (Wei et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). The δ2H values of the T1 b gases show obvious reversals in the normal trend of thermogenic gas from C1 to n-C4 alkanes, with average values of −161.9 ± 6.4‰, −186.9 ± 3.2‰, −178.2 ± 5.6‰, and –182.3‰ ± 6.4‰, respectively (Fig. 3 ). The δ2H values of C1 to C4 alkanes become heavier with increasing gas dryness (Table 1). The δ2H values of three T1 b formation water samples are −105.0‰, −103.6‰, and –98.9‰ (Table 2 ), respectively, which are much higher than the δ2H values of C1–C4 alkanes."
9,Discussion,
10,"Source, maturity and post-genetic alteration of the T1 b natural gases","5.1 Source, maturity and post-genetic alteration of the T1 b natural gases Abundant field evidence shows that the carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of gaseous hydrocarbons in reservoirs are controlled by their source rocks and generation process (e.g., Schoell, 1983, 1988; Whiticar, 1999; Galimov, 2006; Schimmelmann et al., 2006; Strąpoć et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2019). The broad δ13C range of C1–C4 alkanes and the abnormal hydrogen isotopic trend in the T1 b gases indicate that they may be related to mixing of gases from different source rocks, multiple genetic types, varying thermal maturity, or post-genetic alterations such as thermochemical oxidation or biodegradation (e.g., James and Burns, 1984; Chung et al., 1988; Krouse et al., 1988; Jenden et al., 1993; Prinzhofer and Huc, 1995; Dai et al., 2004; Galimov, 2006; Liu et al., 2013, 2016). Three types of natural gases are present in the study area, corresponding to three sets of source rocks: sapropelic-type gas derived from the Lower Permian Fengcheng Formation (P1 f); humic-type gas sourced from the Carboniferous strata (C) and the overlying Lower Permian Jiamuhe Formation (P1 j); and humic-type gas derived from the Middle Permian Lower Wuerhe Formation (P2 w) (Cao et al., 2005; Tao et al., 2016). The three types of gases exhibit different geochemical features in gas compositions, carbon isotopes, and the compositions of light hydrocarbons (C5–C7) (Table 3 ; Tao et al., 2016). The dryness of the T1 b gases varies from 0.77 to 0.98, with an average of 0.88. Their δ13C1 values display a relatively wide range from −46.8 to −37.1‰, with δ13C2 and δ13C3 values varying from −33.3 to −27.5‰, and from −34.1 to −27.2‰, respectively. The relative abundance of methylcyclohexane (MCH) in the gases ranges from 23.7% to 66.7%, with an average of 32.7%, exhibiting the features of the P1 f sapropelic-type gas (Tao et al., 2016). Moreover, the biomarkers of the associated oils in the T1 b, especially the trend of tricyclic terpanes (C20 < C21 < C23) and the low abundance of 18α-22,29,30-trisnorneohopane (Ts), also show the features of the gases derived from the P1 f source rocks (Wang and Kang, 1999; Cao et al., 2005). These results provide reliable evidence that the T1 b gases originated mainly from the deeper P1 f Formation. The T1 b gases have the characteristics of themogenic gas as shown in the increasing normal δ13C trend of C1–C4 alkanes (Table 1). This is consistent with the Bernard discrimination diagram of natural gases, in which molecular C1/(C2 + C3) values are plotted versus δ13CCH4 (Fig. 4 ). These gases show obvious difference in thermal maturity, due to the significant increase in the depth of the P1 f source rocks from northwest to southeast (Fig. 1c). In the deeper part of the Mahu Sag, mudstones in the P1 f have reached high maturity to over-maturity and passed the threshold of oil cracking, and therefore they could potentially generate gas by oil cracking (Fig. 2). The T1 b gases were indeed generated via low-maturity, primary kerogen-cracking and mature, secondary cracking of saturated hydrocarbons (Fig. 5 ). The typical biomarkers for maturity of the associated oils, such as the ratios of C29 sterane 20S/(20S + 20R) and C29 sterane ββ/(ββ + αα), and the relative abundance of tricyclic triterpane to pentacyclic terpane, are much lower for the shallow oil samples than for the deep ones (Wang and Kang, 1999; Cao et al., 2005; Tao et al., 2016). These observations indicate that the T1 b gases were accumulated during at least two distinct periods of time, and yielded low maturity, kerogen-cracking gases and small amount of mature, kerogen/oil-cracking gases. However, when plotting the data on the diagram established by Chung et al. (1988), it is found that a small amount of microbial gas is most likely mixed with thermogenic gas. Fig. 6 shows the δ13CCH4 values of the T1 b fall well below the normal trend line of thermogenic gas, indicating the mixing of primary microbial gases with extremely low δ13C values below −50‰ (see Milkov and Etiope, 2018; Fig. 6a). A similar pattern is also observed in the P1 f natural gases derived from the source rocks (Fig. 6b). The mixing occurred in the P1 f source rocks, prior to charging the T1 b reservoirs. The amount of microbial gas should be very small, as its geochemical signatures (e.g. very high dryness) were mostly obscured by later thermogenic gas. Moreover, if a large amount of 13C-depleted biogenic gas was accumulated in the reservoirs during shallow burial, the δ13C values of the early-stage TOH-related calcites in the T1 b Formation would be much lower than the later-stage calcites. This is opposite to the geological reality (Hu et al., 2018). Notably, the T1 b hydrocarbons underwent thermochemical oxidation induced by high-valence Mn/Fe oxides after charging the reservoir beds. Abundant hematite containing Fe3+ and Mn3+/4+ in the red conglomerates provides a redox-reactive material basis for the reaction. During diagenesis, hydrocarbons from deeper source strata were abiotically oxidized by high-valence Mn/Fe oxides at 90–135 °C, releasing large amount of 13C-depleted CO2, as well as soluble Mn2+ and minor Fe2+. The CO2 and metal ions were then incorporated into authigenic calcite cements that are characterized by extremely negative δ13C values (−70 to −22.5‰) and high MnO contents (average = 5.17 ± 3.48%) (Hu et al., 2018). This post-genetic process likely has changed the chemical and isotopic compositions of natural gases."
11,Distinguishing the effects of maturity and TOH on alkane gases,"5.2 Distinguishing the effects of maturity and TOH on alkane gases Both thermal maturation and TOH can significantly change the molecular and isotopic compositions of gases, and therefore their effects on the T1 b gases need to be disentangled, although this is not straightforward. A feasible approach is to compare the T1 b gases with the gases from the P1 f source rocks that did not undergo TOH. For the P1 f gases, their dryness is a useful geochemical parameter to differentiate their maturity (Prinzhofer and Huc, 1995; Tao et al., 2016). The δ13C values of C1 to C4 alkane present the trend of less negative with increasing dryness and maturity (Fig. 7a). Along with the dryness increasing from 0.72 to 0.90, the δ13CCH4 values increase from −54.2 to −50.2‰; meanwhile, the δ13C values of C2 to C4 alkane increase from −37.9 to −32.8‰, −34.5 to −31.9‰, and –36.8 to −30.2‰, accordingly. The higher δ13C values of C1 to C4 with increasing dryness likely results from the Rayleigh fractionation effects during thermal cracking. The later formed gases are drier and more enriched in 13C, because the 12C-moieties in kerogen are easier to breakdown into gases (Berner et al., 1995; Tang et al., 2000). The equivalent plot for the T1 b gases reveals no such patterns (Fig. 7b). This implies that the TOH reaction has affected the carbon isotopic compositions of the gases. Note that the T1 b gases have obviously heavier δ13C values of C1 to C4 alkanes than those of the P1 f gases, which further indicates that TOH has an effect over and above normal thermal degradation processes (Figs. 7a–d). The change in carbon isotopes of C1 to C4 are due to a kinetic isotope fractionation effect, whereby the 12C 12C bond in alkane reacts with the high-valence Mn/Fe oxides faster than the 13C 12C bond. Similar effects would be expected on the hydrogen isotopic exchange process during TOH, especially continuous hydrogen supply from the formation water."
12,Hydrogen isotopic reversal induced by TOH,"5.3 Hydrogen isotopic reversal induced by TOH A common feature of thermogenic gases reported to date is a gradual increase in δ2H values with increasing carbon number (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Milkov and Dzou, 2007; Boreham et al., 2008; Burruss and Laughrey, 2010; Liu et al., 2019). In the T1 b clastic reservoirs, the δ2H values of hydrocarbon gases display a partly reversed trend of δ2HCH4 > δ2HC2H6 < δ2HC3H8 > δ2Hn-C4H10 > δ2Hi-C4H10, whereas their δ13C values of C1 to C4 are distributed in a normal trend as usually observed in natural gas accumulations worldwide. In the earth's crust, the reversals of hydrogen isotopes of hydrocarbon gases can be induced by the supply of abiogenic hydrothermal gas (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002, 2008; Liu et al., 2016) or primary microbial gas (Strąpoć et al., 2007), the mixing of gases from multiple source rocks or sources at different levels of thermal maturity (Jenden et al., 1993; Dai et al., 2004), and secondary oxidative alteration either microbially (Milkov and Dzou, 2007; Boreham et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2017) or thermochemically through TSR (Krouse et al., 1988; Liu et al., 2014). For the T1 b gases in the Mahu Sag, Junggar Basin, the possibility of these processes should be discussed based on geological background and geochemical signatures of hydrocarbons. The first possibility (i.e. mixing of abiogenic gases) can be ruled out. Within the study area there are no deep faults cutting into the mantle, and there also are no typical hydrothermal alteration minerals, such as fluorite and dawsonite, in the T1 b reservoir rocks. Previously reported abiogenic hydrothermal gases have progressive carbon and hydrogen isotopic trends for the series of C1–C4 alkanes (Jenden et al., 1993; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002, 2008; Proskurowski et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2016). Compared to the normal thermogenic gas, the “inverse” isotopic trends indicate that hydrocarbon formation occurs by way of polymerization of methane precursors (e.g. involving Fischer–Tropsch reaction or the serpentinization of ultramafic rocks; Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Proskurowski et al., 2008; Taran et al., 2010). For the T1 b gases, the hydrogen isotopes exhibit partial reversals, while the trends of carbon isotopes are mostly normal. There is no geological and geochemical evidence for the abiogenic gas accumulation in the T1 b reservoir system. Mixing of small amount of primary microbial gas cannot cause the abnormal reversals either. The microbial gas is very dry, and generally has C1/(C2 + C3) values above 200, with extremely low δ13C values in methane (varying from −110‰ to −50‰; Schoell, 1988; Whiticar, 1999). However, the C1/(C2 + C3) values of the T1 b gases are commonly below 21 (average = 15.7 ± 13.7), and their δ13CCH4 values vary from −46.8 to −37.1‰ (average = −41.9 ± 2.0‰). The C2+ alkane compositions are mostly the products of thermal cracking of kerogen and long-chain hydrocarbons (Schoell, 1983; Prinzhofer and Huc, 1995; Lorant et al., 1998). We can therefore infer that the relative content of primary microbial gas in the T1 b gases is very low. Although mixing of microbial gases can cause the enrichment of deuterium of methane, it cannot fully account for the reversals of C2 to C4 alkane (Fig. 3a). Therefore, we do not consider mixing of primary microbial gases to be a convincing cause of the hydrogen isotopic reversals. Neither is mixing of gases from multiple source rocks a reasonable explanation for the obvious reversals. As described in Section 5.1, the relatively low δ13C values of C2 to C3, and typical biomarkers of associated oils such as tricyclic terpanes, indicate that the T1 b gases are mainly derived from the Lower Permian Fengcheng Formation (P1 f). Considering relatively high TOC (~1.3%) and high maturity (Tao et al., 2016), very small amounts of the C/P1 j-sourced gas might have mixed into the T1 b gases. However, it is also thermogenic gas with a normal carbon isotopic trend overall (Tao et al., 2016). It is unlikely that the mixing of multiple sourced gases caused these hydrogen isotopic reversals. Furthermore, mixing of thermogenic gases with differential maturity levels cannot cause significant reversals either. The T1 b gases contain low maturity kerogen-cracking gases and mature kerogen/oil-cracking gases, both of which are normal thermogenic gases that generally exhibit a gradual increase in δ2H values with increasing carbon number (Barker and Pollock, 1984; Ni et al., 2011). As the vitrinite reflectance of the P1 f source rock does not exceed 2.0% (Ro), its thermal maturity is not especially high (Cao et al., 2005). This is also reflected in the normal carbon isotopic trends of the P1 f and T1 b gases, although the normal δ13C trend of hydrocarbon gases can be reversed by high maturity due to Rayleigh fractionation effect (Burruss and Laughrey, 2010; Ni et al., 2011). Therefore, mixing of normal kerogen- and oil-cracking gases in the T1 b gases is not likely to result in such obvious reversals of hydrogen isotopes. After charging the T1 b reservoirs, microbial or thermochemical oxidation of hydrocarbon gases might alter the normal hydrogen isotopic trend. However, the T1 b hydrocarbons show no evidence of biological degradation. In the geological system of gas accumulation, light C2–C6 hydrocarbons exhibit a consistent degradation sequence: propane is the first compound to be altered, and is followed by butane, pentane, and C6+ hydrocarbons (James and Burns, 1984). The first manifestation of long-chain hydrocarbon biodegradation is typically the selective removal of C8–C12 normal alkanes (Peters et al., 2005). The net effect of biodegradation is an overall decrease in wet gas components (C2+) and enrichment in unaltered methane (Peters et al., 2005). The gas samples from the T1 b Formation contain 5.14–22.68% wet gas (C2+) and 0.79–5.23% propane; the crude oil hosted in the T1 b shows a complete alkane series, with no obvious loss of C8–C12 alkanes, and no hump of unresolved complex mixtures (Hu et al., 2018). In addition, the depleted δ13CCO2 values (−29.4 to −20.1‰) of the T1 b gas are also not consistent with the positive δ13CCO2 values (+2 to +40‰) of secondary microbial gas (Milkov and Etiope, 2018). This leaves the most likely scenario to be that thermochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons remodels the normal hydrogen isotopic trend in the T1 b gases. Recently, the finding of extremely low δ13C and high Mn content of authigenic calcites provided the first evidence for thermochemical oxidation of methane induced by high-valence metal oxides. During the process, not only was methane oxidized in the T1 b Formation, but the less stable C2+ hydrocarbons were also involved in the reactions (Hu et al., 2018). During the reactions, chemical kinetic fractionation, complex reaction intermediaries, and involvement of water with high 2H content can all lead to the 2H enrichment of hydrocarbons. The differential reaction rates of C1–C4 alkanes undergoing TOH in the same condition ultimately change their δ2H values to a different extent."
13,Mechanism of TOH altering hydrogen isotopes of light hydrocarbon gases,"5.4 Mechanism of TOH altering hydrogen isotopes of light hydrocarbon gases After charging the T1 b reservoirs, the light hydrocarbon gases were most likely destabilized by TOH reactions involving abundant high-valence Mn/Fe oxides. The related reactions are complex and contain a series of reaction intermediaries. As shown in Fig. 8 , decomposition of aqueous n-alkanes proceeds through stepwise oxidation and hydration reactions that sequentially produce alkene, alcohol, ketone, and organic acids. The organic acids subsequently undergo decarboxylation and/or oxidation reactions to form carbon dioxides and shorter chain saturated hydrocarbons (Seewald, 2001, 2003; McCollom and Seewald, 2003). Overall, the sequential steps of TOH reactions decompose long-chain saturated hydrocarbons, and produce methane accompanied by consumption of substantial formation water. By comparing the average compositions of gases from the P1 f source rocks and the T1 b reservoirs, the decrements or increases can be calculated compared to their initial abundances in the P1 f gases. The calculated values reveal that the TOH reactions consumed 3.04% of ethane, 1.98% of propane, and 0.63% of butane, and produced 6.56% of methane. The generated methane increased the average gas dryness from 0.83 in the P1 f gases to 0.89 in the T1 b gases (Table 1). Moreover, the CO2 δ13C values of gases from the T1 b oil-rich reservoir beds (−29.4‰ to −20.1‰) are relatively high compared to the majority of δ13C values of the T1 b authigenic calcites (−50‰ to −36‰), which suggests that CO2 is mainly the product of thermal decarboxylation of carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid (Kharaka et al., 1983; Hu et al., 2018). Carboxylic acids may have migrated from the P1 f source rocks through faults, or they may be the intermediaries of the TOH reactions when long-chained and saturated hydrocarbons that charged the T1 b reservoirs were decomposed (Carothers and Kharaka, 1980; Seewald, 2003; Hu et al., 2018). Within the oil-gas reservoirs, the high CO2 δ13C values (above −25‰) are likely related to the preferential oxidation of C2+ alkanes, with carboxylic acids as intermediates. This is consistent with the reaction sequence of light hydrocarbons during the TSR reactions, in which C2+ gaseous alkanes (especially ethane and propane) were preferentially involved in the TSR, whereas methane was the last to be oxidized (Krouse et al., 1988; Cai et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013, 2014). Decomposition of C2+ alkanes and generation of methane through TOH may have altered the normal carbon and hydrogen isotopic trends of the T1 b gases. For the carbon isotopes, during the chemical kinetic fractionation 12C in the CC and CH bonds of hydrocarbons were preferentially oxidized to form oxygenated alteration products (e.g. carboxylic acid) and CO2. The remaining hydrocarbon pool became increasingly enriched in 13C as the reaction proceeded (Coleman et al., 1981; Kiyosu and Imaizumi, 1996; Liu et al., 2013). As a result, the average δ13C values of the remaining C2 to C4 alkanes in the T1 b increased by 5.9‰, 3.5‰, 4.5‰, respectively, compared with the original P1 f gases (Fig. 9a). The higher 13C-enrichment of C2 than C3, and the carbon isotopic anomaly of δ13CC2H6>δ13CC3H8 in sample MD51, might suggest the priority of C2 being consumed in TOH reactions relative to C3, or faster reaction rate of C2 than C3. Notably, the δ13CCH4 values significantly decline with increasing gas dryness in the T1 b gases, showing a negative relationship (Fig. 7b). This is likely the response of generation of 12C-rich methane during decomposition of C2+ alkanes. However, it is a fact that the average δ13C values of CH4 in the T1 b reservoirs increased by 10‰ from the initial value of −51.9‰ to the current value of −41.9‰. This implies certain amount of methane was consumed in TOH, resulting in its enrichment of 13C. This process is also supported by the increasing δ13CCH4 values with increasing ERP index (i.e., the TOH reaction extent; Fig. 7d). For the hydrogen isotopes, 1H of saturated hydrocarbons, including methane, was preferentially oxidized into H2O during the TOH reactions due to the Rayleigh fractionation effects, and the remaining hydrocarbon pool became increasingly enriched in 2H as the reactions proceeded (Coleman et al., 1981; Kiyosu and Imaizumi, 1996; Liu et al., 2014). This process partially resulted in significant 2H-enrichment of C1 to i-C4 and n-C4 alkanes, especially methane, in the T1 b gases (Fig. 9b). On the other hand, the formation water is likely another factor causing the relative 2H-enrichment of methane compared to C2–C4 alkanes. The δ2H values of the T1 b formation water vary from −105.0‰ to −98.9‰ (Table 2). As to C1–C4 n-alkanes in the reservoirs, the current hydrogen isotopic fractionation relative to formation water are in the ranges of −52.3‰ to −83.2‰,–77.4‰ to −93.4‰, −65.8‰ to −86.2‰, −68.1‰ to–92.6‰, respectively. Advances of theoretical predictions have been achieved in the equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors (a o/w) between organically-bound (o) and liquid water (w) hydrogen at low temperatures (Bottinga, 1969; Sessions et al., 2004; Schimmelmann et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009a, 2009b): (3) α o / w = R o R w = δ 2 H o + 1 δ 2 H w + 1 Based on theoretical calculation, for C1 the a o/w value are 0.9427–0.9541 at 90–140 °C (Bottinga, 1969), indicating the equilibrium 2H/1H fractionation between C1 and H2O are −45.9‰ to −57.3‰. This value is lower than the real 2H/1H fractionation of C1 and H2O in the T1 b formation (−52.3‰ to −83.2‰), demonstrating the hydrogen isotopic exchange between methane and water didn't reach equilibrium. It suggests only a certain amount of methane was involved in the TOH reaction. In contrast, as to C2–C4 n-alkanes, experimentally calibrated theoretical estimates of a o/w values at 90–140 °C are 0.8771–0.8819, 0.8866–0.8872, and 0.8903–0.8924 (Wang et al., 2009b). The corresponding 2H/1H equilibrium fractionation between C2–C4 n-alkanes and water are −118.1‰ to −122.9‰, −112.8‰ to −113.4‰, −107.6‰ to −109.7‰, respectively. The calculated fractionation are higher than the real fractionation in T1 b, suggesting abundant C2–C4 n-alkanes involved in TOH, and meanwhile the H exchange between C2–C4 and water was favored under the oxidizing condition (Reeves et al., 2012). The TOH reactions consuming C2–C4 proceeded through a series of intermediaries that produced transient n-alkenes by free-radical hydrocarbon cracking, and then formed alcohol, ketone, and carboxylic acids via rapid free radical hydrogenation reactions; subsequently the carboxylic acids were decarboxylated into carbon dioxides and shorter chain alkanes (Seewald, 2001, 2003; McCollom and Seewald, 2003). As shown Fig. 8, transient n-alkene partially inherits the initial hydrogen isotopic composition of n-alkane in reaction 1 (Reeves et al., 2012); then the final methyl in 2-Alkanol receives two hydrogen atoms of methylene in n-alkene and one hydrogen atom from water during hydration reaction 2; the following reaction 3 and 4 also likely introduce hydrogen atom of water into the final methyl in 2-Alkanol to produce carboxylic acids including acetic acid (Wang et al., 2009b); finally the methyl in acetic acid receives one hydrogen atom from carboxyl or water forming new methane via decarboxylation (Seewald, 2001; Wang et al., 2009b). Thus, the CH4 produced via consuming C2+ alkanes most likely inherited the hydrogen isotopic compositions of both long-chain alkanes and formation water. Eventually, as shown in Fig. 9b, the δ2H values of methane in the T1 b gases increased more rapidly than those of C2–C4 alkanes, compared with the normal thermogenic gas."
14,Conclusions,"The natural gases in the Lower Triassic clastic reservoirs (T1 b) of the Mahu Sag, Junggar Basin exhibit a unique hydrogen isotopic trend of δ2HCH4 > δ2HC2H6 < δ2HC3H8 > δ2Hn-C4H10, with partial reversals, whereas their δ13C values of C1 to C4 alkanes display a normal trend overall. After the natural gases charged the reservoir beds that contained abundant high-valence Mn/Fe oxides, the TOH reactions resulted in a systematic 13C- and 2H-enrichment of C1 to C4. Compared to the initial gases from the P1 f source rock, the average δ13C values of C1 to C4 in the T1 b gases increased by 10.0‰, 6.0‰, 4.4‰, and 5.1‰, respectively. In contrast, the δ2H values of C1 to C4 increased more significantly from the normal thermogenic gas, and eventually caused the hydrogen isotopic reversals. The increase C1 content accompanied by decreasing of C2–C4, 13C- and 2H-enrichments of C1–C4, and differential hydrogen isotopic fractionation of C1 and C2–C4 relative to theoretical calculation, suggest C2–C4 were preferentially oxidized, and C1 had been consumed in TOH reactions. As TOH proceeded the 13C- and 2H-enrichments of C1–C4 were mainly caused by the Rayleigh fractionation. Involvement of formation water in the reaction intermediates of TOH is likely another factor producing 2H-enriched methane and eventually causing the reversals. 2H/1H exchange between water and alkyl-bound hydrogen was facilitated in the oxidized strata at relatively high temperatures. This study demonstrates that in some geological systems the TOH reactions altered the hydrogen isotopic compositions of natural hydrocarbons, and the reactions can be identified via the molecular and hydrogen isotopic signatures. It is necessary to conduct related laboratory experiments under conditions similar to the natural system."
