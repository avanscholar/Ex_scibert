0,Introduction,"Semiconductor photo-catalysts have attracted much attention due to their high potential in degradation of organic pollutants, water splitting to hydrogen and CO2 conversion [1]. Chief of these materials is TiO2 because of its stability, low cost and non-toxicity. Therefore, it is often used as a prototype photo-catalyst for fundamental investigations [2]. Upon excitation with incident light of energy higher than its band gap, electrons and holes are generated in the conduction band and valence band, respectively. The photo generated electron and hole pairs at the surface are poised to reduce H+ to H2 molecules and oxidize O2− to O2 molecules [3]. In competition with this, electron-hole pair recombination takes place, with orders of magnitudes at faster rates [4]. This fast recombination rate dramatically decreases the photo-catalytic activity [5,6]. There are many methods and approaches to increase the life time of these charge carriers and therefore increase the likelihood of the electron transfer reactions. These include, the addition of a metal with a high work function than the semiconductor [7–10], the use of plasmonic metals [11–15], the so called Z-scheme [16,17,3,18,19] and the use of photonic band gap materials [20–24]. Focusing on the semiconductor properties, increase in charge carriers’ lifetime can be achieved by increasing its crystallinity. This is because amorphous (or less crystalline) phases of the semiconductor have dangling bonds and bulk defects which behave as recombination centers for the photo generated e− and h+ pairs [25]. Charge carriers’ lifetime may also be increased using a mixed phase of the same semiconductor if they have different recombination rates. In the case of TiO2 the co-presence of anatase and rutile polymorphs (its most common stable phases) has shown enhanced photo-catalytic reaction rates, due to the so called “synergistic effect”, which is proposed to occur due to the charge separation at the phase junction of the two phases [26–28]. The rutile phase of TiO2 has a lower band gap (3.0eV) than the anatase phase (3.2eV). Its relative inactivity is often attributed to a faster electron hole recombination rate than that of the anatase phase [29]. It has been proposed that for Au/TiO2 Degussa P25 (ca. 80% anatase – 20% rutile) excited electrons can migrate at the interface of the three components (anatase, rutile and Au particles) from the rutile to the anatase phase and benefit from a slower electron hole recombination rate in the latter. This interpretation may present the role of rutile as a charge carrier reservoir for the anatase phase [30]. It may also be possible that the inter-particle mixing of rutile and anatase leads to an electron trap population that differs from that observed for the anatase and rutile phases separately [31,32]. Zhang et al. [32] prepared different TiO2 samples and studied them for photocatalytic hydrogen production. They found maximum reaction rates when samples were heated to 700–750°C, in which the bulk was a pure rutile and the surface was a mixed phase composed of anatase and rutile. This “synergistic effect” between anatase and rutile has also been observed in the case of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); composed of TiO2 photoanodes with mixed phase of anatase and rutile. The addition of rutile significantly enhanced the photocurrent and overall solar conversion efficiency. 13wt.% of rutile content was found to be optimum [33]. Time-resolved Tetra hertz (THz) spectroscopy was also used to understand the synergistic effect in DSSCs by studying the charge injection dynamics. THz results indicated that photo excited electrons injected into rutile nanoparticles can transfer to the conduction band of anatase nanoparticles. Based on the observed correlation between the photovoltaic and THz results, electron migration from rutile to anatase was proposed to explain the enhanced photovoltaic performance of mixed-phase TiO2 [33]. Yan et al. [34] studied the effect of rutile content in mixed phase TiO2, by keeping the surface area and crystallinity relatively constant, on the photocatalytic decomposition of a dye (methyl orange). Methyl orange decomposition was enhanced up to a rutile content of 30%; further increase in rutile content decreased the catalytic activity. It was concluded that the rutile is necessary for the charge separation but large amount of rutile also decreases the inherent advantages of anatase [34]. Crystallinity of TiO2 can also play an important role in the photo activity. Higher crystallinity means lower surface and bulk defects in the structure, which are the main causes of the fast electron-hole recombination rates. In a previous work, by other researchers, the effect of crystallite size and crystallinity of TiO2 was studied. This was done by keeping the crystallinity largely unchanged but varying the crystallite size; the activity was found to increase with increase in crystallite size but independent of the crystallinity [35]. In that work, the effect of crystallinity was studied for photo oxidation studies in the presence of oxygen. The transfer of electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to O2 takes place very fast (at a comparable rate to that of the e-h recombination). The available radical oxygen species react very fast with the organic molecules making the system less sensitive to changes in the degree of crystallinity. In a previous work by some of the authors, the effect of initial particle size of TiO2 on the reaction rate of the photocatalytic reaction of water/5vol.% of ethanol on two series of Pt/TiO2 (where the initial particle size of TiO2 was 20nm or 100nm) was studied. It was found that the normalized rate for hydrogen production per unit area of TiO2 was higher when both phases were present (rutile and anatase up to a ratio of about 1/3) in the case of TiO2 (20nm) but no enhancement was seen when the initial particle size was large (100nm). In this work [36] we have discussed the synergistic effect based on electronic and structural changes. XPS-valence band study was inconclusive as it simply tracked those of the pure phases and could not shed light on the electronic changes associated with the valence band maxima of the composite materials. On the other hand some changes occurred in the anatase crystallite strain along the c direction in the case of TiO2(20nm) in the range where synergism occurred [36]. In the present study, we have synthesized TiO2 by the sol-gel method with initial particle size of 12–15nm. This was followed by heating at different temperatures in order to prepare the anatase-rutile phases with different compositions. Once the different catalysts were made the exact amount of Pt (1wt.%) was deposited. Along this transformation changes in crystallite size, degree of crystallinity, phase composition, as well as band gap were studied by UV-vis absorbance, BET surface area, XRD, Raman and XANES. The parameters extracted from these studies were then evaluated with respect to the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from water/5vol.% ethanol at identical photocatalytic conditions."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis TiO2. nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel method using Titanium (IV) isopropoxide as a precursor. Synthesis was carried out in a three neck flask. In a typical synthesis process, 50ml of 2-Propanol (pH=7.6) was taken and the pH was adjusted to 2 by adding few µL of HCl. 0.2mol (60mL) of Titanium IV isopropoxide was then added drop wise under constant stirring and reflux. The mixture was stirred under constant agitation until the sol was formed. To obtain the gel, 3.2mol (57.7mL) of deionized water was added. The gel obtained was dried at 80°C overnight and calcined at 500°C for 3h to get crystalline TiO2 anatase nanoparticles. Pt was doped as a co-catalyst on each of the annealed TiO2 sample. Pt precursor stock solution was prepared by dissolving calculated amount of metal salt (PtCl2 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) in 1N HCl. The calculated amount of precursor solution was then impregnated over the TiO2 support. The impregnated mixture was stirred overnight at 80°C to obtain a dried powder, this was followed by calcination at 350°C for 5h in air. In this manner a series of 1wt.% Pt doped TiO2 was synthesized with varying percentages of anatase and rutile."
3,Photoreactions,"2.2 Photoreactions Catalysts were evaluated for hydrogen production in a 100mL Pyrex glass reactor. 5vol% ethanol in water was used as a sacrificial agent for all the reactions and 2mg of catalyst was dispersed in 20ml water ethanol solution (ca. 0.1g/L). Reactor was purged with nitrogen gas for 30min in order to remove molecular oxygen. The final mixture was subjected to constant stirring initially in the absence of light excitation for 30min to allow the system to reach equilibrium. The reactor was then exposed to the UV light. A 100 Watt ultraviolet lamp (H-144GC-100, Sylvania par 38) was used as a UV source with a flux of ca. 5 mW/cm2 at a distance of 10cm with a cut off filter (360nm and above). Products analyses were performed by Gas Chromatography (GC) equipped with Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and Hayesep Q packed column at 45°C and N2 was used as a carrier gas."
4,"UV-Vis, Raman, XRD and XANES","2.3 UV-Vis, Raman, XRD and XANES UV-vis absorbance spectra of the powdered catalysts were collected over the wavelength range of 250–900nm on a Thermo Fisher Scientific UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with a praying mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Absorbance (A) and reflectance (% R) of the samples were measured. Raman analysis of the samples was performed using a Thermo Scientific™ DXR™ Raman equipment. TiO2 samples were analyzed from 50 to 3400cm−1 with multiple scans (16 scans), the wavelength of the laser used for the analysis was 532nm, with the power of 7mW and the spot size was 0.7µm. The aperture opening was 50µm and grating had 900 lines per mm. Rietveld X-ray diffraction intensity data sets were collected using a PANalytical EMPYREAN diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano geometry fitted with a copper tube operating at 45kV and 40mA and a linear position sensitive detector. The diffractometer was configured with a 0.25° diverging slit, 0.5° anti scattering slit, 2.3° Soller slits, and a Ni filter. The data sets were acquired in continuous scanning mode (0.021°/s) over the 2θ range 15–130°, using a step interval of 0.013° and a counting time of 0.6s per step. XRD patterns were analyzed by the Rietveld method using the fundamental-parameters (FPs) approach contained within the software TOPAS V4.2 (Bruker-AXS) [37]. For consistency, the same refinement procedure was used for all samples. Anatase, rutile and brookite reflections were refined with a tetragonal and orthorhombic unit cells (space group I41/amd (n°141), P42/mnm (n°136) and Pbca (n°61), respectively). The profile parameters included the scale factor, a sample displacement parameter, and a four-term polynomial for the background. Fundamental parameters approach calculates analytically the instrumental contribution to the peak profile. The sample contribution was assumed to be Lorentzian and solely due to the crystallite size. All structural parameters were left constant: (i) site occupation factors were all fixed to 1, and (ii) the isotropic temperature factors of titanium and oxygen atoms were fixed to 0.7 and 1Å2, respectively. Quantification of crystalline titania polymorphs by Rietveld refinement required to take into account the scattering of an amorphous titania phase which was detected in various samples. The latter contribution was modeled including two additional peaks positioned at 2θ =30.30°, 42.16°. Final Rwp, RBragg, Goodness of Fit (GOF) were respectively close to 4, 5 and 1.5 for all refinements. XA spectra at the Ti K absorption edge (4.97keV) were measured in transmission mode using a Si(111) crystal monochromator at the SuperXAS – X10DA beamline at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. Samples were diluted with a cellulose powder and compressed into a pellet (13mm diameter). The dilution level corresponded to the optimal sample thickness for transmission experiments (edge jump close to 1). Quick scanning EXAFS was carried out in conjunction with a fast data acquisition system (DAQ), to capture 597 spectra of each sample with between 11948 and 11978 points per spectra. Measurements were calibrated against titanium foil positioned between the second and third ionization chambers. JAQ Analyzes QEXAFS v 3.3.46 software [38] was used for spectra averaging and the data subsequently were treated in Athena XAS data processing software (Demeter 0.9.21) [39]. The edge jump of all spectra was normalized and backgrounds fitted using a third order polynomial. The post edge background was fitted with a spline function. Linear combination fitting was used to calculate the fraction of titania polymorph using the near-edge spectra region between 4965 and 5015eV. Parametrization of the fitting only included the respective weights of reference spectra (rutile, brookite, anatase). EXAFS region (k-range=3.25–9.5Å) subjected to Fourier Transform was smoothed by multiplying with a Kaiser-Bessel window defined by a medium strength sill (dk=1Å−1)."
5,Results,"Powder XRD was carried out to study the phase transformation occurring when the synthesized TiO2 was annealed for 1h using temperatures ranging from 580°C up to 800°C. XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1a highlighted the characteristic reflections of the anatase, brookite and rutile polymorphs whose intensities varied depending on the annealing temperature. Quantification of the three crystalline titania allotropes and their respective crystallite sizes/unit cell parameters are regrouped in Table 1 for all temperatures. The annealing post-treatment at 580°C produced a mixture of anatase (76%) as a major phase followed by brookite (22%), then rutile (2%). In the 580–680°C temperature range, the amount of anatase was roughly stable at ≈80%, the amount of rutile steadily increased from 0% up to ≈20%, while the amount of brookite decreased and then disappeared by 700°C (Fig. 2a ). The temperature of 700°C, which marked the absence of brookite, corresponded to the onset of the anatase to rutile transformation. This transformation was completed when the annealing temperature of 800°C was reached. Fig. 3 presents changes in the unit cell dimensions, cell volume and crystallite sizes for the anatase (Fig. 3a ) and rutile (Fig. 3b ) polymorphs as a function of temperature. In the case of anatase the a - and c -dimensions of the tetragonal unit cell revealed an opposite progression: a decreased from 3.788Å down to 3.784Å, while c increased from 9.494Å up to 9.514Å as the annealing temperature was raised from 580 up to 750°C. The unit cell volume (a2c) slightly decreased from 136.33 down to 136.18Å3. For the rutile phase, there was only a very slight variation of the cell parameters for all investigated materials (Fig. 3b), yet the same trend was seen; inverse relationship between the a-dimension and crystallite size. Besides, the crystallite size of anatase and rutile increased over the range of temperature investigated from 19nm up to 50nm and from 12nm up to 100nm, respectively. Cell parameters and crystallite sizes have often been correlated by many authors [40–47]. The trends which are usually reported for both rutile and anatase phases, are a decrease in a -dimension and an increase in c -dimension when the crystallite size is increased. The variation is most noticeable in the 1–20nm range and then it tends to become negligible for crystallite size larger than 30–40nm. The activation energy extracted from the data in Fig. 1a is given in Fig. 1b upon plotting Ln (I(110)R/[0.884I(101)A+I(110)R]) as a function of 1/T, where I(110)R is the intensity of the (110) diffraction line of the rutile phase and I(101)A that of the (101) diffraction line of the anatase phase. The extracted activation energy was found to be close to 200kJ/mol in the temperature range of 660–750°C. The activation energy values differ significantly from one sample to the other with numbers up to 550kJ/mole have been reported [48]. In general, the energy needed increases with increase in crystallite size and numbers between 180–300kJ/mole for particles in the 10–20nm size were extracted by others [49]. Raman spectra of the TiO2 series are given in Fig. 4a . The TiO2 anatase phase has six Raman-active modes: one A1g, two B1g and three Eg, the rutile phase has four Raman-active modes: B1g, multi phonon process, Eg, A1g and B2g while brookite has 36 (9A1g +9B1g +9B2g +9B3g) Raman active, 24 (8B1u +8B2u +8B3u) infrared active, 9A1u and three (B1u +B2u +B3u) acoustic modes [50]. By annealing anatase at higher temperature from 580°C to 800°C all Raman vibrational mode intensities increased, in addition phase transformation to rutile occurred. Raman spectra of TiO2 solgel annealed at different temperatures show 4 vibration bands in the range of 180–750cm−1 for anatase, which are assigned to the Eg(2) (195cm−1), B1g (394cm−1), A1g (516cm−1) and Eg(3) (637cm−1). For brookite 3 modes were observed in that range which are assigned to A1g(151.9cm−1), B1g(321.91cm−1) and B2g(365.84cm−1). At higher annealing temperatures brookite and anatase transformed into rutile and the Raman active modes of rutile assigned to (multiple phonon process) (232.24cm−1), Eg (445.5cm−1) and A1g (610.68cm−1) were observed. The increase in the intensity of Raman signals is attributed to the increase in crystallinity [51]. There are several factors which contribute to the shift in the Raman frequency and broadening in nanodimensional crystallites materials. These include phonon confinement, oxygen defects, stress, and anharmonic phonon coupling [52,53]. For example, the presence of oxygen vacancies can induce a compressive stress that results in a blue-shift of the Eg mode [52]. The signal of TiO2 rutile B1g (450cm−1) started to appear for the sample annealed at 670°C “ca. 5% rutile” content. The phonon lifetime can be calculated considering FWHM of Eg(1) peak at 144cm−1 as shown in Fig. 4b . The energy-time uncertainty relation for the determination of phonon lifetime is given as ℏ/ΔE = τ =1/2πcΓ, where ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy (J) of phonon mode, ℏ is the reduced plank’s constant (J s), Γ is the FWHM of the Raman peak (cm−1), and τ is the phonon lifetime (s) [52,54]. Table 2 shows the calculated phonon life time of TiO2 samples with different particle size. The phonon lifetime of the 15nm particle size was shorter compared to those of larger particles. It was indicated that small particles of TiO2 have shorter phonon life time than larger ones due to a high number of defects in addition to phonon confinement [55]. Phonon electron coupling has been studied in some details by many researchers [56,57]. The very small shift in the Raman frequency and the small changes in the phonon lifetime indicate that is unlikely to contribute in a measurable rate in photo-catalysis at room temperature. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the same series are presented in Fig. 5a . TiO2 exhibits absorption edge at about 380nm and 410nm due to the presence of anatase and rutile, respectively. The non-monotonic change in the band gap shift is due to the contribution of both phases. It is to be noted that even 3% of rutile makes a noticeable shift in the absorbance edge. Clustering of the energy gap is seen up to 18% rutile content, after which a jump is seen for the 23% rutile. Not much change, in the band gap, is seen for higher content in the rutile phase. Fig. 5b presents the Kubelka Munk analysis of the data in Fig. 5a as well as the extracted band gap for the series. Also shown in Fig. 5b is an example of how the absorption edge was extracted. Within 0.05eV the extracted band gap fits those of anatase (3.20–3.25eV) and rutile (2.95–3.00). Figs. 6 and 7 present hydrogen production from a 95vol.% water - 5vol.% ethanol over the same series, but that contained 1wt.% Pt on top. The objective is to test the activity at the same conditions for all the series. Because deviations from linearity for rates normalized by unit mass or area may occur at high catalysts concentrations due to (in part) light scattering, the data were acquired with the smallest possible amount of materials, 2mg in 20mL liquid (or 0.1g/L). Typically, with these catalysts linear reaction rates were seen with increase in catalyst concentration up to about 0.5g/L (see discussion section). The Hydrogen production rates, normalized per BET surface area in Fig. 6 and per unit mass in Fig. 7 are plotted for comparative analyses. From Fig. 6a , the lowest activity is seen for the 93% rutile sample (marginally above that of pure rutile-based catalysts, not shown). Based on unit area, the anatase-based catalyst showed high activity, yet those composed of small amounts of rutile in addition were the most active. The highest production was found for the catalyst composed of ca. 80% anatase and 18% rutile. Two main observations can be extracted by plotting the rates (extracted from Fig. 6a) as a function of % rutile as presented in Fig. 6b . The temperature at which each sample was annealed is also indicated. The first one is the clustering of the reaction rate for catalysts annealed between 580 and 650°C which are mostly composed of anatase and brookite. The second one is that after a maximum at about 15% rutile, the rate steadily declines with increase in the % of rutile. This kind of Volcano curves are common in catalysis whereby there is an optimal relationship between the binding constant (or adsorption energy) and the rate of reaction (activation energy) at a given set of conditions. By analogy, one can indicate that there is an optimal relationship between the charge carrier number density (n) and their life time (τ). In other words at the left hand side of the curve, charges with low recombination rates but relatively low numbers predominate and at the right hand side charges with high recombination rates and relatively high number density predominate. We are not aware of detailed studies of the life time measurements of charge carriers for a gradual change of an anatase to rutile phase transformation, although some limited work on either single crystals or powder have shown that indeed the life time of excited electrons is higher for anatase when compared to rutile [58–62]. Similar observations can be highlighted for rates normalized by unit mass, with slight differences (Fig. 7a and 7b ). The clustering of points at close to 0% is similar although the order is changed for the three points between 580°C and 630°C. Subtle changes in crystallinity are most likely behind these variations. The maximum of the reaction rate shifted slightly to the left yet the overall shape of the curve is similar. While synergism is seen in the samples containing anatase and rutile phases, the rate per unit mass is highest for the pure anatase phase. One may argue upon inspection of Fig. 1a, 6 and 7 that the presence of brookite is detrimental to hydrogen production since its decreases with increase in reaction rate. This is most likely not the case because brookite TiO2 has good activity for hydrogen production. Although it was also reported that the presence of brookite together with anatase decreases the photocatalytic oxidation of salicylic acid [63], it is not straightforward to compare photo-oxidation (in the presence of molecular oxygen) and photo-reduction as the former is a very fast reaction due to the kinetics of electron trapping of molecular oxygen. There are also some reports that indicated an improved reaction rate for hydrogen production by methanol reforming when both anatase and brookite are together [64]. The exact band edges of brookite are not clear yet, so one cannot judge of its importance in photo-catalysis although most reports puts its band gap and band edge very similar to that of the anatase (ca. 3.2eV) [65,66]. In our present study, the dimensions of anatase unit cell were calculated using the Rietveld refinement method. The c-dimension shows an expansion from 9.498 to 9.517Å when TiO2 was annealed from 580 to 750°C. It can be inferred that before transformation into the rutile, there is a buildup of strain in the anatase c-dimension and once the transformation takes place the anatase lattice relaxes by expanding in the c-direction. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the lattice c-dimension of anatase on the H2 production rates for the same series studied, as well as the corresponding crystallite size. Changes in crystallite size and c-values have been studied in some details by numerous researchers for TiO2 anatase [42,47]. At small crystallite size (less than 10nm) the c-value approaches 9.47–9.48Å and then increases to up to 9.51–9.52Å for particles above 30nm. Actually, the change in the c values is nonlinear for small crystallite size. This is explained as due to the considerable covalence contribution in addition to ionicity in Ti-O bonding. This would affect atomic positions for small particle sizes in order to minimize their energy and therefore the coupling geometry/energy minimization is expected to be nonlinear in nature. The main point however is that particles above 30nm would have a c- dimension close to 9.52Å. From Fig. 8, it is noticed that the rates per unit mass continually decreased with increase in the c-values as well as with increase in the crystallite size, although there is some deviations in the middle of the figures (8b and 8d). Normalization of the rate per unit area accentuated this deviation from linearity by the middle of the figures (Fig. 8a and c). It can be extracted from these figures (8a–d) that optimal c-values are those 9.510 and 9.518 which correspond to crystallite size between 35 and 45nm in size. There appears to be a trade-off between crystallinity and crystallite size. If we consider that high c-values translate a more bulk like particles (and therefore a more crystalline oxide) then there is an optimal relationship between this and the crystallite size. In a photocatalytic reaction, the reaction rate is dependent on charge carriers’ diffusion to the surface of the catalyst. The diffusion length, Ld, of electrons or holes in a semiconductor is defined by the average distance the relevant charge moves in the semiconductor [67,68]. With Ld =(Dτ)1/2 and D = μkBT/q (where D is the diffusion coefficient, τ is the charge carrier lifetime and μ is the mobility; the other terms have their usual meaning). Könenkamp has modeled electron transport in nanoporous TiO2 films [69] and obtained numbers between 10 and 100nm for TiO2 anatase with 4–8nm in size. Given that we see optimal activity with crystallite size between 30 and 40nm it is unlikely that changes solely in Ld are responsible for such an abrupt increase per unit area. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) acquired after post-annealing treatment at temperatures ranging from 530°C up to 750°C are shown in Fig. 9 . The spectra display two characteristic energy regions often observed for the Ti K-edge: a weak pre-edge composed of three peaks commonly labelled A1, A2, A3 and the intense main edge appearing above 4980eV. The main edge corresponds to 1s to 4p electric dipole transitions (E1) [70]. The nature of the electronic transitions occurring in the pre-edge region has long been debated for titania [70–78]. However, the last two decades have seen a merging agreement between experimentalists and theorists [79–82]. Three kinds of electronic transitions are at stake to describe the pre-edge features: local electric quadrupole transitions (E2) 1s→3d; nonlocal and local electric dipole transition (E1), 1s→mixed 4p-3d [83]. In the three cases, the 3d empty states are probed either directly through quadripolar transition or indirectly through dipolar transition. For the rutile form of TiO2, the point symmetry of titanium crystallographic position is D2h (centrosymmetric) and the characteristic peaks are: A1 peak is due to E2: 1s→3d (t2g) of Ti absorber; A2 peak is due to E1: 1s→4p-3d (t2g) from Ti neighbors and E2: 1s→3d (eg) of Ti absorber; A3 peak is due to E1: 1s→4p-3d (eg) of Ti neighbors [82]. For the anatase form of TiO2, the point symmetry of titanium crystallographic position is D2d (non-centrosymmetric). Consequently, two additional local E1 transitions participates in the pre-edge region: A1 peak also includes E1: 1s→4p-3d (t2g) of Ti absorber, and the A2 peak includes E1: 1s→4p-3d (eg) of Ti absorber [82]. The case of brookite has not yet been investigated in details. Surface Ti atoms on a TiO2 nanoparticles and Ti atoms within amorphous TiO2 encounter a rather distorted environment compared to titanium atoms located in bulk crystalline TiO2 [84,85]. When the symmetry around titania center is lowered, the mixing of the 4p and 3d orbitals becomes enhanced and allows the observation of more intense electric dipole transition. This phenomenon can be detected by the comparison of the total intensity of the pre-edge between samples and was effectively used either to detect amorphous component or to assess the size of TiO2 nanoparticles [86–90]. The current XANES spectra acquired, for all sintering temperatures, did not display any significant modification of the total pre-edge intensity (Fig. 9). This is consistent with the rather large crystallite sizes determined previously by XRD and points toward a negligible amount of amorphous phase present in all samples. Furthermore, the sharpness of features at the pre-edge, main edge and multiple scattering region also suggest that all samples were crystalline and contained very little amorphous material, if any [86]. The changes in intensity and position of A1, A2, A3 peaks and the changes in the main edge region were simply attributed to a compositional variation in titania relative to annealing temperature. Consequently, linear combination fitting using rutile, anatase, and brookite reference spectra were able to reproduce satisfactorily all observed spectral features for every samples. Note that, contrary to powder X-ray diffraction and Raman results, the rutile phase could not be detected by XANES spectroscopy at low temperatures (<680°C), because of the relatively low amount of rutile phase present in those samples. However, the overall trends remained similar when comparing the results from powder X-ray diffraction (Figs. 2a vs. 2b ). A rather stable amount of anatase (ca. 75%) and brookite (ca. 20%) up to ≈650°C, followed by a phase transition occurring in the 670–700°C temperature range where brookite and anatase phases are progressively converted to the rutile phase. Although it seems from both figures (2a and 2b) that the brookite phase is first converted to the anatase phase in the 600–650°C temperature range. The latter transformation was quantitative when the temperature reached 800°C. Those results were further substantiated by the analysis of the titanium K-edge k2-weighted EXAFS signals and their corresponding Fourier transforms as shown in Fig. 10 . The EXAFS oscillations appeared identical for all annealing temperatures applied between 530°C and 670°C. Above 670°C, new modulations in the EXAFS signal were observed (dashed boxes on Fig. 10) and revealed a phase transition. Those modulations converted to real space by Fourier transform indicated that the first oxygen shell remained barely affected by the temperature treatment while the second and third coordination shells of titanium atoms revealed sensible differences. Due to the restricted spatial resolution of EXAFS spectroscopy (ΔR=0.26 Å using the current 6.25Å k-range) and despite the various local symmetry of titanium crystallographic site in each titania allotropes, it was not possible to separate the contribution of each type of Ti→O scattering paths appearing in the FT-EXAFS spectra (peak at 1.5Å in Fig. 10). On the other hand, the second and third coordination shells were useful to assess compositional variation of samples. Indeed, titania treated between 530°C and 670°C displayed on their FT-EXAFS spectra a peak positioned at 2.5Å and a broad peak at 3.2Å. Both peaks are attributed to a combination of titanium shells arising from anatase and brookite allotrope (anatase: 4 Ti-Ti at 3.0Å, 4Ti-Ti at 3.85Å; brookite: 3 Ti-Ti at 2.96Å, 4 Ti-Ti at 3.5–3.6Å). At 750°C, the first metal shell had a lower intensity (peak at 2.5Å) and the second metal shell had a substantially higher intensity and was shifted (peak at ≈3.0Å). Those observations are consistent with a quantitative transformation to the rutile structure since the degenerescence of the first Ti-Ti scattering path is only 2 with a half path length of 2.9Å while the second Ti-Ti scattering path has a large degenerescence of 8 with a half path length of 3.5Å."
6,Discussion,"Few key points and parameters might be extracted from this study. Increase in the annealing temperature of TiO2 nanoparticles (15nm in size) composed of 76% anatase+22% brookite resulted in the gradual disappearance of the brookite phase, together with increase in the particle size and a gradual appearance/increase of the rutile phase. The maximum photocatalytic activity was observed for TiO2 that was composed of about 80% anatase, 18% rutile and 2% brookite with extracted particle sizes (from Rietveld X-ray diffraction intensity data analyses) of 44, 82 and 33nm, respectively. The activation energy in the 600–750K range for the anatase to rutile phase transformation was found to be ca. 200kJ/mol. For the transformation of anatase to rutile (the most thermodynamically stable phase) thermal energy (activation energy) is required for the rearrangement of atoms. The temperature required for that depends on the crystallite size [36] usually around 600–700°C in air and in the absence of dopants or impurities [91,92]. The presence of lattice oxygen defects is usually an important factor affecting the phase transformation from anatase to rutile; due to decrease in the structural rigidity of oxygen lattice once vacancies are formed. Annealing in low partial pressures of oxygen have also been reported to enhance the anatase to rutile transformation [93,94]. It was shown that during initial heating the transformation of anatase starts by forming rutile like structures at the interface of anatase which act as nucleation sites [95]. We have not studied the phase transformation by TEM but used XRD, Raman and XAS methods. The results of these were complementary and pointed to the onset of phase transformations. Many intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that can affect the photoreaction rate of a semiconductor exist. Before addressing some of them within the context of this study, it is important to mention the set up in which the experiments were conducted. All experiments were conducted with a 1wt.%Pt/TiO2. The deposition of Pt on TiO2 by impregnation is routine (as Pt/TiO2 is one of the bench mark catalysts and photo-catalysts), we have previously analyzed a similar series on which 1wt.% Pt was deposited on TiO2 anatase/rutile by their XPS Pt4f/Ti2p lines. Deviation from 1wt.% was minor [36] and Pt was largely found in its metallic state (XPS Pt4f7/2, and Pt4f5/2 BE=71.5, 74.8eV, respectively, with ΔE=3.4eV). It is assumed that under photo reaction condition all Pt metals are in their metallic state due to the redox conditions of the reaction. We have also routinely found that Pt particles are of about 1nm in size on many TiO2 surfaces [9,96,97]. Additionally we have conducted TEM and HRTEM studies of Pt on TiO2 anatase and anatase/rutile of a different but comparable series (Fig. 11 ) similar results were observed. For our analysis it is assumed the effect of Pt is the same in all catalysts. In other words, Pt involvement in the reaction in Pt/TiO2 anatase and Pt/TiO2 rutile is the same. There are no proven rigorous data for that, however. It has been observed by other researchers [98] and us [27] that the addition of a noble metal onto the semiconductor results in fast electron transfer from the conduction band to the metal (by time resolved spectroscopy and EPR techniques among others). We have opted to keep this parameter (Pt) constant so we can focus on the different phases of the semiconductor. Regarding the catalytic reaction itself, we have used ethanol (5vol.%) in water (95vol.%) as a hole scavenger so we can neglect the hole effect into the reduction kinetics of hydrogen ions to hydrogen molecules. We [99] and others [100,101] have previously investigated the vol.% of alcohols and found that a few vol.% are largely enough for the hole scavenging to occur. We have also monitored all reaction products in many previous work and these include acetaldehyde as a minor product but mainly CO2 in addition to hydrogen. We have, in this work monitored the production of CO2 in all cases, but within the objective of the work we find it to be of no importance as ultimately the reaction is that of reforming (3H2O+CH3CH2OH→6H2 +2CO2) and any deviation from that is due to changes in the pH of the solution during the reaction [102]. In order to compare photocatalytic activity of a material one needs to set up a system where both light and mass are in well-defined conditions. In that regard, one can work in a regime where mass is not a limiting factor and relies on the photon light flux. This is useful to extract quantum yield information (since the quantum yield of a photo-catalytic reaction is “mathematically” independent of the mass of the material inside a unit area determined by the light flux) but may not be rigorous to monitor relative (and sometimes subtle) catalytic performances. The other method is to work in a regime where light is not limiting, and put the minimum amount of mass to ensure complete (or near complete) light absorption. This method is useful for normalization of catalytic rates but cannot be used for quantum yield measurements. We have used this last method to evaluate the performance of the series of these catalysts. Moreover, we have also made sure that “curve crossing” in reaction rates is not occurring. This is presented in Fig. 12 where the activity of two types of catalysts, used in this study, is evaluated as a function of their mass inside the reactor. At all investigated masses no crossing of the production is seen. It is important to indicate that we are working in the low end side of the mass-axis, to ensure linearity of the reaction rate. In the following, we will discuss some of the key observations in this work. Inspection of Figs. 6 and 7 indicates an optimal% of the two phases is needed for the reaction to occur efficiently. As indicated above this behavior is akin to volcano type plots often encountered in catalysis for different materials (or for the same material with different composition or crystallographic orientation) [103]. Said differently, within the context of photo-catalysis, one needs a balance between a (i) large number of charge carriers and (ii) their life time which in turn affect their (iii) diffusion length; needed to reach the surface. Focusing on excited electrons, most reports have indicated that their life time is longer in anatase when compared to that in rutile although there are several types of excited electrons (free, trapped in shallow sites or deep sites; shallow and deep traps here refer to their potential energy with respect to the conduction band) [5,60,98]. So it is safe to consider that they are long-lived in anatase when compared to rutile. Since the photoreaction investigated in this work, is conducted in the presence of ethanol (with its redox potential considerably higher than the valence band of TiO2), then variations in the hole lifetime and their potential energy can be neglected. The number of charge carriers, n, which can be approximated to the band gap energy (n = N exp (−E g/2kT); where N is the total number of electronic states and E g is the band gap) is poised to be larger in rutile than in anatase particles. [A large fraction of these carriers in the rutile phase has short life time (in ps time) in addition of being trapped in deep “energy” sites [59].] Thus, it is possible that the interface anatase/rutile provides the needed excited electrons migration from rutile to anatase. Fig. 8 presents the reaction rate as a function of c-dimension. It is observed that per unit area there is a maximum value at which the rate is maximized. It has been postulated that the presence of surface phase junctions in mixed phase anatase-rutile TiO2 facilitates the electron transfer between them upon photoexcitation and therefore improves charge separation that in turn results in reducing recombination rates and consequently increases photocatalytic activity [28]. Crystallinity, is thus an important factor affecting the photocatalytic performance in semiconductors because the higher it is the lower would be the defect density. The effect of crystallinity and lattice strain on the photodecomposition of methylene blue was studied by Inagaki et al. [104]. TiO2 annealed at higher temperatures resulted in high rate constants for methylene blue decomposition, the maximum decomposition was seen for samples annealed at 700°C, and then decreased for those annealed at higher temperatures. The study showed that the enhancement in the rate of decomposition was mainly due to the improvement in the crystallinity of anatase, resulting from increase in crystallite size to decrease in the lattice strain. Returning to the correlation between the reaction rate and c-dimension, one may link the increase in the activity to elongation of the c-dimension. In other words, upon absorption of a photon and creation of an electron-hole pair, preferential migration of the excited electron along a particular crystallographic orientation may occur. [When the c-dimension expands enough and reaches that of a bulk number, the fraction of anatase becomes small (as the material becomes dominated by the inactive rutile phase) and this explains the drop in the activity]. The slight increase in the c-dimension along the c-axis may help in increasing their path length, simply by due to the temporal decrease in their density along this particular direction. Such a directional driven reaction has been seen by others on perovskite semiconductor oxides before [105] and is postulated to be linked to changes in local electric fields that in turn affect the excited electron directional movement (in a system akin to drift velocity in semiconductors) and this effect may not be neglected. Other researchers have given further evidences for such a phenomenon. For example, Ag ions photo-reduction was preferentially seen on the (100) surfaces of SrTiO3 [106], others have reported that Au3+, Pt4+ or Ag+ cations are in turn deposited on the {010} facets of BiVO4 micro crystals [107] while Mn2+ and Pb2+ cations are preferentially oxidized to MnOx and PbO2 on the {110} facets of the same microcrystals."
7,Conclusions,"The photocatalytic hydrogen production of water/ethanol (95/5 volume ratio) was been studied for a series of 1wt.% Pt/TiO2 with different phases. Phase transformation was monitored by Raman shift, XRD patterns analyzed by the Rietveld method and X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of the Ti-K edge. For initial TiO2 particles of 15nm in size, composed of anatase (ca. 80%) and brookite (ca. 20%) phase transformation to rutile had an activation energy close to 200kJ/mol. The highest hydrogen production rate per unit area was observed for catalysts composed of 80% anatase, 18% rutile and 2% brookite and the associated particle size was 44, 82 and 33nm, respectively. Results of this work indicate that either, anatase and rutile are needed for an efficient charge carrier dynamics, or that a structural effect of anatase is also involved in the so called “synergistic effect”. It appears that lattice expansion of the anatase phase along the c-dimension can be linked to increasing reaction rate. Such as a directional effect in photo-excited systems is not unique to TiO2 and has been observed on other semiconductor photo-catalysts."
