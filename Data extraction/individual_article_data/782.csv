0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the energy supply is mostly dependent on fossil sources such as coal, oil and natural gas, while the exploitation and use of them would bring great pressure on environment [1]. On the other hand, the energy demand has been increasing persistently as the population of the world increases. The contradiction between the two aspects drives us to seek the alternative and sustainable energy sources in order to remit the impacts on environment. Hydrogen was an ideal candidate that benefit obviously the environment as the unique product of combustion is water. Currently, the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process together with the steam reforming of methane based on the natural gas route are the main origins for the hydrogen production [2,3]. Another problem that cannot be avoided in the consumption of fossil-based energy is the emission of carbon dioxides. The concentration of it increases in atmosphere, and therefore enhances the “greenhouse effect”, which further contributes to the climate change [4]. Fortunately, such a drawback could be overcome when the hydrogen production was developed by converting the biomass or bio-derived molecules such as glycerol, which makes the hydrogen generation route becomes renewable and sustainable. It is widely reported that hydrogen could be produced through catalytic reforming of mono-alcohol or polyols [5–8]. Starting from glycerol that acting as the mainly by-product (∼10 wt%) in biodiesel industry, the reforming techniques including the aqueous phase reforming (APR) [2,9–11], steam reforming (SR) [12–14] and autothermal reforming (ATR) [15–17] are mainly focused. Particularly, the steam reforming of glycerol attracts more interests as it could be operated at milder and gentler conditions. This reaction route is usually considered as the combination of the endothermic glycerol cracking and the exothermic water gas shift reactions, which requires the catalyst perform well simultaneously in cleaving the C–C and C–H bonds. Therefore, the precious metals such as Pt [18,19], Ru [20,21], Rh [22], Re [23] and Ir [24] etc. contained catalyst were applied to catalyzed the reaction. Another advantage of the use of precious metal based catalytic system is related to the improvement of catalytic stability because the coke deposition could be efficiently suppressed. Nevertheless, the catalyst preparation procedure is usually complex to obtain high dispersion and uniform particle size distribution. Moreover, the introduction of precious metal into the catalyst means the high cost of catalysts. Ni-based catalysts become competitive because of the abundant reservoir and low cost of Ni, more importantly, it also shows strong activity in cleaving the C–C and C–H bonds, which could be confirmed by its application in various dry reforming [25,26] and steam reforming reactions [27–30]. As far as the steam reforming of glycerol reaction is concerned, the Ni/Al2O3 and the modified Ni/Al2O3 (e.g. by MgO [31], CeO2 [32], ZrO2 [33] and La2O3 [34]) systems were widely studied. Besides the support Al2O3, different types of materials for example the porous silica [35,36], metal oxides (ZrO2, CeO2) [37], hydroxyapatite [38] and the carbon materials (activated carbon, CNTs) [23,39,40] were also investigated. These Ni based catalysts indeed performed well in converting glycerol into hydrogen, while the challenge was the improvement of catalytic stability which was usually linked to the properties of active site metallic Ni like the surface area and dispersion, and the coke deposition. The former was mainly caused by the high temperature due to the limited thermal resistance of catalyst, and the later was mostly caused by the polymerization reaction that occurred on the acidic sites [41]. In this work, a series of mixed metal oxides NiCexAl was designed, and prepared by thermally decomposing the corresponding layered double hydroxides (LDH). The Ce element was doped into the LDH structure by partially replacing the Al position, and well dispersed Ni species were expected to obtain via the calcination. On the other hand, the mixed metal oxides derived from LDH precursor are usually basic, which is helpful for improving the coke resistance on catalyst surface. The introduction of Ce into the NiAl system was determined by its strong capacity in oxygen storage, release and transportation [42,43]. In addition, the rare earth metal oxides could promote the coke gasification [44] and water gas shift reaction [45], and improve the reducibility of metallic phase [46], all of these characteristics are needed for steam reforming of glycerol reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The LDH precursors were synthesized by urea homogeneous precipitation method as described elsewhere [47,48]. In a typical synthesis, a 0.5 M solution containing Ce and Al nitrates as metal sources was first prepared, the urea was afterwards added until the molar ratio of nurea/n(Ce+Al) equaled to10. The Ni(NO3)2 solution was then dropwise added into the abovementioned solution at refluxing temperature under vigorous stirring, giving a green suspension. After reacting for another 24 h, the resulting precipitates were filtered, washed with deionized water for at least 3 times, and socked in 0.05 M Na2CO3 aqueous for 24 h in order to exchange the nitrate ions with carbonate ions. After equilibration with Na2CO3 aqueous solution, the solids were recovered again, dried at 110 °C overnight, and finally calcined in static air at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min to get the mixed metal oxides. The sample was denoted as NiCexAl, where the x stood for the Ce/Al ratio varying from 0.1 to 0.9. The Ce free NiAl sample was also prepared as reference."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization TA Instrument (model Q600, SDT V20.9) was applied to study the decomposition process of layered double hydroxides precursors to form the mixed metal oxides in the presence of air, the sample was heated from 50 to 700 °C with a ramp of 5 °C/min. When the it was used to burn the coke deposited on spent catalyst surface, the sample was heated from 100 to 800 °C in the O2/N2 (10 vol%) mixture with the same ramp. The crystalline phases were analyzed by PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (CuKα, 40 kV, 35 mA, λ = 1.5406 Å). The sample was scanned in the range of 10° < 2θ < 80° with steps of 0.026°/s and a 17 s acquisition time. The crystallite size was estimated by Scherrer’s equation [49]. The textural properties including the specific surface area, the pore volume and the average pore diameter were measured on Quantachrome Nova 1000e apparatus at liquid nitrogen temperature. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the Barrer-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method were used to calculate specific surface area, and inter-/intra-crystalline mean pore size, respectively. The sample was degassed at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum (50 Pa) prior to the analysis. The redox property was tested on Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 system equipped with a quartz U-type tubular reactor and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical H2-TPR test, 25 mg sample was pretreated at 200 °C for 3 h in N2 flow (30 mL/min) which was then replaced by the reductive gas mixture comprising 10 mol.% H2 in Ar (30 mL/min). The reduction process was performed from 100 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The H2-chemisorption analysis was carried out on the same apparatus in order to investigate the properties of active sites like the dispersion and surface area of metallic nickel. The sample was pre-reduced at 450 °C for 3 h, and then cooled down to the 50 °C. It was saturated by pulse injecting the hydrogen, which was monitored by a TCD. The detailed procedure and the quantification method were described in our previous work [50]. The chemical state of surface elements was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The C-(C, H) component of the C1s peak of adventitious carbon was fixed to 284.5 eV as a reference."
4,Catalytic steam reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production,"2.3 Catalytic steam reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production The glycerol steam reforming reaction was carried out in a conventional fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel, i.d.: 10 mm, length: 200 mm) under atmospheric pressure, the reaction system was illustrated in Fig. 1 . In a typical test, 200 mg of catalyst, diluted with 1.8 g of quartz sand (φ = 0.30 mm), was loaded into the middle of reactor to ensure thermal stabilization. After reducing at 450 °C for 2 h in H2/N2 mixture, it was cooled down to the reaction temperature. The liquid reactant (glycerol, 10 wt% in water) was pumped into a 250 °C evaporation chamber with a flow rate of 3.0 mL/h (WHSV = 15 h−1) by a HPLC pump. The vapor was then carried into the reactor by N2 flow (60 mL/min). A GC equipped with two packed columns (Porapak N: 4 mm o.d., 2 m length, Molecular sieves 13X: 4 mm o.d., 2 m length) in series and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyzed the gaseous products including H2, CH4, CO and CO2 etc. While an offline GC equipped with a capillary column (KB InnoWAX: 0.35 mm i.d., 30 m length) and flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze the liquid products including the un-reacted glycerol that were condensed in a cold trap. The reaction data were obtained after 8 h time on stream (TOS = 8 h) to be sure that the reaction got to steady state. Catalytic performances were reported in terms of glycerol conversion (x), glycerol conversion to gaseous products (x g), hydrogen selectivity (S H2), CO, CO2 and CH4 selectivity (S i). They were calculated based on the following formulae: (1) x = n g l y . i n − n g l y . o u t n g l y . i n × 100 % , (2) x g = n C O + n C O 2 + n C H 4 3 × n g l y . i n × 100 % , (3) S H 2 = n H 2 n CO + n CO 2 + n CH 4 × 3 7 × 100 % , (4) S i = n i n CO + n CO 2 + n CH 4 × 100 % , where n gly.in and n gly.out are the glycerol quantity in mole at inlet and outlet, respectively; i represents one of the carbonaceous compounds CO, CO2 and CH4, n i thus represents the molar quantity."
5,Results and discussion,
6,LDH precursors and their thermal decomposition behaviors,"3.1 LDH precursors and their thermal decomposition behaviors The NiCexAl LDH precursors were synthesized by urea homogeneous precipitation method and their crystalline phases were checked by XRD. It was clear from Fig. 2 that the hydrotalcite-like structure was successfully obtained for the all Ce doped samples since the characteristic diffractions at 11.3°, 22.7°, 34.8°, 39°, 46.5°, 60.4° and 62.2° were detected, corresponding to the reflection planes of (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (113) [51]. While the introduction of Ce played a negative role in affecting the hydrotalcite-like structure which was strongly depended on Ce/Al ratio, resulting in the impurity phase CeCO3OH, locating at 15.8°, 20.6°, 23.9°, 26.4°, 30.1°, 33.7°, 35.8°, 38.1°, 43.5° and 49.1°, could be found for each sample. On one hand, the Ce cation has bigger ionic radius than Ni cation (0.087 nm for Ce4+ vs 0.069 nm for Ni2+), meaning that the Ce cations may not be completely incorporated into the brucite-like layers. On the other hand, when the Ce/Al ratio increased, the content of Ni became lower, causing the electron density of layers and the content of interlayer anions declined. The interaction between the bulk layers and the interlayer anions became weak, the crystallization degree of LDH phase was weakened. On the contrary, the diffractions originated from the impurity CeCO3OH became stronger with the increasing of Ce/Al ratio [52]. The precursors underwent the thermal treatment to obtain the mixed metal oxides, the process was recorded by TG analysis on the selected samples. The continuous weight loss could be observed for the all samples from Fig. 3 , showing the similar thermal decomposition behaviors. The removal of physisorbed water and the interlayer water occurred at the initial stage where the temperature was not higher than 200 °C. The dehydroxylation of the brucite-like sheet combined with the decarbonation took place in the temperature range from ca. 225 to ca. 375 °C, resulting in the collapse of hydrotalcite-like structure [28]. An additional weight loss process between ca. 375 and ca. 500 °C could be found for both NiCe0.3Al and NiCe0.5Al samples, which was probably assigned to the decomposition of CeCO3OH. It was not visible for the sample NiCe0.1Al just because the content of this impurity was quite low."
7,Crystalline phase analysis for the mixed metal oxides,"3.2 Crystalline phase analysis for the mixed metal oxides The XRD results for the calcined samples were depicted in Fig. 4 , the diffractions originated mainly from NiO and CeO2 phases. The former one was detected at 37.1°, 43.1°, 62.7° and 76.7° [53], while the later one was found at 28.5, 33.0, 47.4, 56.2 and 69.4° [32]. While the diffraction intensity changed with the Ce/Al ratio. The intensity of CeO2 increased gradually as the Ce/Al ratio varied from 0.1 to 0.9, and that of NiO presented the opposite trend. The patterns kept almost unchanged after reduction (see Fig. 5 ) except the appearance of a new diffraction peak at ca. 51.7° which, together with the characteristic of broader diffraction at ca. 43° especially for the high Ce/Al samples, confirmed the existence of metallic Ni. The crystallite size of Ni species was estimated by Scherrer’s equation and the results were listed in Table 1 . The crystallite size of NiO for the calcined samples changed slightly from 10.5 to 11.9 as the Ce/Al ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.9. On the other hand, the crystallite size of Ni formed via hydrogen pre-reduction only fluctuated in a very narrow range. These results suggested that the introduction of Ce could stabilize efficiently the Ni species during catalyst preparation and reduction regardless of its loading."
8,Porous property,"3.3 Porous property The porosity of the calcined catalysts was studied by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement, the isotherms and the pore size distributions were shown in Fig. 6 (l) and Fig. 6(r), respectively. According to the IUPAC classification [54], the type IV isotherms could be found for all catalysts, indicating the presence of mesoporous structure. The shape of hysteresis loop could be assigned to the H3 type which was the typical characteristic from sheet-like pore structure. The pore size also exhibited a similar distribution between 3 nm and 30 nm centered at ca. 4.5 nm, while the bigger pore volume was obtained on the samples with Ce/Al ratios from 0.5 to 0.9. The detailed information on textural property was reported in Table 2 , it seemed that the content of Ce in the catalysts did not affect significantly the pore structure, although the introduction of Ce could improve the surface area by around 20% comparing with the Ce free sample NiAl (100.2 m2/g) [55]. The surface area fluctuated between ca. 118 and ca. 122 m2/g for the all samples, the pore volume and the average diameter kept nearly constant when the Ce/Al ratio changed from 0.1 to 0.5, then increased slightly as the ratio further increased to 0.7 and 0.9. Such a result indicated that higher content of Ce played a positive role in improving the pore volume and pore diameter."
9,Chemical state of surface elements,"3.4 Chemical state of surface elements The XPS technique was applied to measure the chemical state of surface elements, and the Ni2p3/2 spectra for the selected samples were depicted in Fig. 7 . Obviously, all the samples showed the similar spectra between ca. 849 and 869 eV, consisting of two isolated peaks, the one centered at ca. 855 eV was assigned to Ni species, and the other one appearing at ca. 6 eV higher binding energy (BE) side was considered as the satellite peak. More precisely, two types of Ni species could be found as the Ce/Al ratio changed from 0.1 to 0.7, corresponding to the free NiO [Ni2+ (I)] at BE of ca. 855.0, and the Ni(OH)2 [Ni2+ (II)] at BE of ca. 856.5 eV after deconvolution treatment. While for the catalyst NiCe0.9Al with the Ce/Al ratio of 0.9, an additional peak centered at ca. 852.9 eV was observed and assigned to the Ni0. It was interesting to note that the metallic Ni was only detected on catalyst NiCe0.9Al since the samples were pre-reduced prior to the XPS analysis. Such results indicated that the introduction of Ce into the catalyst formula have the reduction of Ni2+ become more difficult. The quantified results in Table 3 also exhibited that only around 5% of metallic Ni was formed on the catalyst surface. The XPS spectra of Ce3d locating from 870 to 930 eV for the samples were gathered in Fig. 8 , besides the ill-defined peak at ca. 873.6 eV, another isolated peak could be seen at ca. 880.2 eV which originated from Ce3+ species [43,56]. On the other hand, the absence of the peak at ca. 917 eV further evidenced that no C4+ species co-existed together with Ce3+ species. It suggested that the Ce4+ species could be fully reduced to Ce3+ species through the pre-reduction. The O1s spectra as shown in Fig. 9 could be deconvoluted into two peaks for the all samples, the one with lower BE at ca. 530.2 eV was associated with the lattice oxygen (O2−), while the other one with higher BE at ca. 531.7 was assigned to the surface oxygen species (O2 2−, O−) [57]. Furthermore, it was found from the quantitative analysis in Table 3 that the proportion of surface oxygen increased from 40% to 48% as the Ce/Al ratio varied from 0.1 to 0.7, and then declined to 45% for the sample NiCe0.9Al with a Ce/Al ratio of 0.9. Additionally, it could be found that the Ni2+ species existed mainly in NiO as the Ce/Al ratio at a lower value of 0.1, which would be changed as the Ce/Al ratio went further up. As a result, the Ni(OH)2 became the dominant phase. It was interesting to note that the binding energy values for Ni, Ce and O species in sample NiCe0.9Al were a little bit lower than the corresponding those in samples with the Ce/Al ratio from 0.1 to 0.7, indicating the weaker interaction between the Ni species and CeAlO species. Once recalling the XRD results for the LDH precursors, the introduction of excess Ce like the sample with Ce/Al ratio of 0.9 would result in the formation of impurity phases, and finally gave a distorted LDH structure. Such a feature was probably responsible for the weak interaction in sample NiCe0.9Al, which may supply the explanation why the Ni2+ species in this sample could be partially reduced into metallic Ni."
10,Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction,"3.5 Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction The reducibility of the catalysts was measured by H2-TPR technique, and the hydrogen consumption was recorded as shown in Fig. 10 . Two hydrogen consumption processes centered at ca. 260 °C and ca. 535 °C could be found. The intensity of the first one was rather weak, and increased with the Ce/Al ratio. The hydrogen consumption was probably caused by the reduction of Ni2+ thanks to the existence of surface adsorbed oxygen species in Ni–O–Ce mixed oxides [13,58]. When the Ce4+ in CeO2 lattice was partially replaced by Ni2+, resulting in the imbalance in electric charge and structural distortion of CeO2. Such an evolution promoted the generation of active oxygen species, which finally had the NiO species reduced at relative lower temperature. The main hydrogen consumption took place in the temperature range from ca. 375 °C to ca. 750 °C, involving a more complicated reduction process. The NiO strongly interacting with Al2O3 may be reduced in this range as well as the reduction of CeO2 [59]. Obviously, the introduction of Ce element was good to improve the reducibility of NiO species."
11,The property of active sites determined by H2-chemisorption,"3.6 The property of active sites determined by H2-chemisorption The H2-chemisorption allows us to gain more details on the property of active sites such as the Ni dispersion and surface area, the recorded TPD profiles were gathered in Fig. 11 . All the catalysts showed roughly three desorption process: i) the desorption of physisorbed hydrogen below 150 °C, ii) the desorption of weakly chemisorbed hydrogen between 150 °C and 360 °C, and iii) the desorption of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen between 360 °C and 800 °C. According to the quantified hydrogen uptake listed in Table 4 , the Ce modified samples showed the similar capacity for physisorbed hydrogen except NiCe0.7Al, while the capacity for chemisorbed hydrogen including the weak (150–360 °C) and strong (360–800 °C) interaction with the sample differed upon the Ce/Al ratio. Both of them rose up to the maximum first as the Ce/Al ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.7, and then dropped down as the ratio continued going up to 0.9. The Ni dispersion and surface were calculated on the basis of chemisorbed hydrogen, and the results revealed that the Ni dispersion changed from 7.9% for NiCe0.1Al to 20.5% for NiCe0.7Al. Correspondingly, the Ni surface area varied from 52.6 m2/gNi to 136.5 m2/gNi. These results suggested that Ce doped NiAl catalysts exhibited the similar hydrogen desorption behaviors, but the different capacity especially the chemisorbed hydrogen which was depended on the Ce/Al ratio, showing an optimized value of 0.7."
12,Catalytic evaluation for glycerol steam reforming,"3.7 Catalytic evaluation for glycerol steam reforming The glycerol steam reforming for hydrogen production was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 450 °C, the catalytic activity and product distribution were reported in Table 5 . Obviously, the introduction of Ce was good to promote the conversion of glycerol as well as the yield of gaseous products. Compared with the Ce free sample NiAl, the both values increased firstly as the Ce/Al ratio changed from 0.1 to 0.5, and then kept nearly constant as it further went up to 0.9. While the product distribution was different, which was evidently dependent on the Ce/Al ratio. The hydrogen selectivity showed an increasing trend as Ce/Al ratio rose up to 0.7 and reached the maximum (82.9%) over the sample NiCe0.7Al. For the carbonaceous products, a similar volcano trend for CO2 selectivity could be also found, and the top value was obtained over the same sample NiCe0.7Al. Correspondingly, the catalysts with higher hydrogen selectivity like NiCe0.5Al and NiCe0.7Al showed lower level of CO and CH4. Considering the steam reforming of glycerol for the production of hydrogen involves the consecutive cracking and water gas shift reactions. accompanying with the main side reaction of CO methanation which consumed the hydrogen. Therefore, one can easily speculate from the product distribution that the appropriate Ce/Al ratio (e. g. 0.5 and 0.7) could efficiently the promote the water gas shift reaction, and could simultaneously restrict the CO methanation reaction. Such a result was quite similar to that obtained over the Zr introduced NiAl system [28]. Reaction conditions: m cat. = 0.2 g, atmospheric pressure, reduction temperature = 450 °C, reaction temperature = 450 °C, flowrate of liquid feed = 0.05 mL/min, flowrate of carrier gas = 60 mL/min, feedstock 10 wt% glycerol in water, time on stream = 8 h."
13,Crystalline phase analysis for the spent catalysts,"3.8 Crystalline phase analysis for the spent catalysts The XRD analysis for the spent catalysts was reported in Fig. 12 , the CeO2 was still detected as the bulk phase was hard to reduce under the current operation conditions. The co-existence of the NiO phase located at 37.5°, 43.2° and 63.3° and the metallic Ni phase located at 44.5°, 51.7° and 76.6° confirmed that the NiO was only partially reduced. Although no isolated diffraction peak could be assigned to the spinel phase NiAl2O4, the appearance of the broad diffractions at ca. 37, 43 and 63° implied that it was probably generated during the reaction. Concerning the variation in crystallite size, it could be found from Table 1 that the values changed within 5.0%, indicating that the metallic Ni was well stabilized by CeO2."
14,Coke deposition,"3.9 Coke deposition The coke deposition usually takes place on the catalyst during the alcohol reforming reactions [60–62], which further has the negative influences on catalytic activity. It was therefore checked by running the TG analysis in diluted oxygen (10 vol% in N2), the weight loss curves were recorded and gathered in Fig. 13 . The similar weight loss process could be found for all samples: i) the loss of adsorbed water below 200 °C, ii) the weight gain process between 200 and 350 °C caused by the re-oxidation of metallic Ni, and iii) the burn of deposited coke between 350 and 650 °C. The quantified results were reported in Table 6 . Roughly speaking, the catalyst with higher Ce/Al ratio could restrict the formation of coke except the sample NiCe0.1Al. The NiCe0.3Al and NiCe0.5Al samples showed the close and maximum amount of coke (ca. 250 gC/gcat.) which declined by different extent as the Ce/Al ratio increased to 0.7 (197 gC/gcat. for NiCe0.7Al) and 0.9 (218 gC/gcat. for NiCe0.9Al). The analogous processes for coke combustion indicated that the type of carbonaceous species was the same for the Ce-doped catalysts, and the quantity of coke is dependent on the Ce/Al ratio."
15,Discussion,"3.10 Discussion When Ce element was introduced into the precursor NiAl LDH material, the impurity phase CeCO3OH co-existed in LDH structure due to the difference in ionic radius. The metal oxides including NiO and CeO2 were generated after thermal decomposition and no evident difference in crystalline phase was observed as Ce/Al varied from 0.1 to 0.9 according to the XRD measurement. Usually, the metallic Ni phase is considered as the active sites for the Ni-based catalytic system in catalytic reforming processes [6,12,45]. While no isolated diffraction peak assigned to metallic Ni was found for both reduced and spent catalysts, the surface analysis also showed that no metallic Ni was formed on the catalyst surface with Ce/Al ratio from 0.1 to 0.7, and only few of that was detected in NiCe0.9Al sample. On the other hand, it should be noted that only Ce3+ species were found for the all samples. It is well known that the ceria is able to undergo the reversible redox pair: the oxidation of Ce3+ and the reduction of Ce4+ accompanying the generation of oxygen vacancies together with high mobility lattice oxygen. It has been reported that the doped Ni in Ni–Ce–O solid solution system could create oxygen vacancies and thus improve oxygen mobility [42]. Such a situation also adapts to our catalyst, the Ni2+ could be reduced into metallic Ni0 by Ce3+ under the reaction conditions, which could be described as follow: 2Ce3+ + Ni2+ ⇌ 2Ce4+ + Ni0 This process ensured the existence of indispensable and active metallic Ni sites, which had the glycerol steam reforming reaction act as over the pre-reduced Ni systems [63]. Obviously, the property of Ni species still played a key role in determining the catalytic performances. It could be found by correlating the Ni dispersion and surface area with the Ce/Al ratio (see Fig. 14 ) that the two factors first increased with the increasing Ce/Al ratio and reached the top as Ce/Al equaled to 0.7, then dropped down at the maximum ratio of Ce/Al. As abovementioned, the generation of Ni–Ce–O solid solution could create the oxygen vacancies and form the active surface oxygen. More surface oxygen was formed on the catalyst NiCe0.7Al, together with the better dispersion and larger surface of active Ni sites, made it performed the best in converting the reactant into gaseous products and in hydrogen selectivity, which was clearly seen from Fig. 15 . Meanwhile, the enhanced oxygen mobility would favor to suppress the formation of coke, as a consequence, the least quantity of coke was deposited on the sample NiCe0.7Al which contained the most surface oxygen."
16,Conclusion,"The introduction of Ce into the Ni–Al LDH material led to a co-existed impurity phase, the mixed metal oxides catalysts were obtained through the thermal decomposition. The presence of Ce could keep the Ni species from sintering, but limited their reduction by hydrogen. The generated Ni–Ce–O solid solution favored to create the oxygen vacancies and to enhance the oxygen mobility as only Ni2+ and Ce3+ species were detected by XPS. The Ce3+ could reduce Ni2+ into the active metallic Ni under the reaction conditions. The key properties of the catalyst such as surface oxygen, Ni dispersion and surface area were strongly influenced by Ce/Al ratio, and reached the maximum as it equaled to 0.7. Consequently, the best catalytic performances for glycerol steam reforming reaction were achieved over the sample NiCe0.7Al with the conversion to gas of 89.2% and hydrogen selectivity of 82.9%. The high selectivity of hydrogen was obtained on the basis of enhanced water gas shift reaction and restricted CO methanation reaction."
