0,Introduction,"Water or light alcohol splitting through the photochemical reaction for hydrogen production are advantageous in that the reaction can proceed using only the sunlight without any additional energy. However there is required at least 0.7–1.2 eV of voltage to photolysis of water or light alcohols. Therefore semiconductor materials such as TiO2 having the band-gap containing the redox potential range for hydrogen and oxygen production are need. TiO2 semiconductor had attracted worldwide attention since the first reports of water splitting on TiO2 photoelectrodes under ultraviolet light irradiation by Fujishima and Honda in Japan in 1972 [1,2]. Since then the photocatalytic researches centered on TiO2 had been actively studied and their performances were quite promising in the beginning. However for almost 50 years the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 had not been significantly improved unlike the initial expectations of the researchers and it had been recognized to be followed by fast recombination of excited electrons and holes on the TiO2 surface [3,4]. Therefore subsequent studies had shifted to modified TiO2 catalysts doped with various metal-based [5–7] or nonmetal-based [8–10] dopants to escape the limitations of TiO2 band-gap. Nevertheless the limitations of TiO2 had been continued until early 2000, and some scientists had found a substitute for TiO2 and a representative material was ZnO [11,12]. The ZnO had several favorable properties including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide band-gap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. The properties were valuable in emerging applications for transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, electronics as thin-film transistors, and light-emitting diodes. However the band-gap of ZnO was also similar to that of TiO2. Thus many researchers started developing various ZnO using metal [13,14] or non-metal dopants [15,16] but no breakthrough activity could be expected. However ZnO also failed to exhibit the expected photocatalytic performance. In recent years many researchers attention shifted to some semiconductors absorbing visible light, and more attention was focused on semiconductors with different counter ions from oxygen. One of them was the sulfur based semiconductors, especially the main metals linked with sulfur were extended to ZnS [17], SnS2 [18], CdS [19], CuS [20], Bi2S3 [21], Sb2S3 [22], In2S3 [23] etc. They may be used alone or loaded as a visible light absorber onto a TiO2. Among them the ZnS has been used most widely as a window in visible and infrared optics. Additionally it has been reported to perform well in the researches producing hydrogen by photo-splitting water alone [24]. As another example, β-In2S3of an n-type semiconductor had an optical band gap of 2.1 eV. It could be grown with varying band gaps which widely available as photovoltaic semiconductors [25] and be used effectively for photoelectrochemical water splitting also [26]. However these monometallic sulfides were susceptible under visible light because of a narrow band gap, and eventually recombination between electrons and holes was promoted. Therefore in recent the bimetallic sulfides including ZnS such as ZnS/CdS [27–29], ZnS/SnS2 [30], ZnS/CuS [31], ZnO@ZnS [32], ZnIn2S4 [33] etc have been intensively studied. Among them, ZnIn2S4 has been produced by various methods and used as support in photocatalysis, additionally a number of papers have reported that ZnIn2S4 which combines ZnS and In2S3 could produce synergistic effects when used as a photocatalyst or optical material compared to ZnS or In2S3 alone [34,35]. But these papers introduced only cubic ZnIn2S4 fixed with the ratio of Zn to In = 1:2, and they did not provide the optimum Zn/In ratios. Here if their optimum conditions are found, probably better catalytic activity can be expected. On the other hand, the hydrogen production in this study from methanol photolysis in aqueous solution is obtained. Generally in water splitting reaction to produce hydrogen gas, methanol was used as sacrificial agent to enhance the activity. One general problem is the reaction of the active oxygen species on the valence band of semiconductors with resulting H2. The oxygen species which can be in the form of O2 −, OH − radical or O2 gas, is prone to react with resulting H2 to form water. In order to prevent reverse reaction, methanol was added to scavenge the oxygen species and form CO2 gas [36]. However, the amount of methanol added as a scavenger in the reaction where water splitting is dominant should not exceed half the amount of water, since the splitting voltage of methanol is only about half the splitting voltage of water. However the volume amount of water and methanol is equal to 1:1, so a methanol photolysis reaction should be predominantly occur, thus consequently the main hydrogen source in this study is methanol. Therefore, the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles which varied with the ratio of Zn:In to 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 are prepared using a classical hydrothermal method in this study. Their structures are identified by X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The atomic compositions on the surface of the particle are confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and element mapping. The light absorption/emission characteristics of the particles are evaluated using ultra-violet (UV)-visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Finally, the synthesized particles are applied to the methanol photolysis in aqueous solution for hydrogen production as photocatalysts under UV and visible-lights, the emitted gas products from methanol photolysis are analyzed using GC, and the methanol photolysis mechanism on ZnxInySz catalyst is clarified."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of ZnS and ZnxInySz particles,"2.1 Synthesis of ZnS and ZnxInySz particles The ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were prepared by a typical hydrothermal method. To prepare the sol-mixtures, zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 99.99% Junsei Chemical, Japan), indium chloride (InCl3, 99.99% Junsei Chemical, Japan), and sodium sulfide (Na2S, 99.99%, Junsei Chemical, Japan) were used as the Zn, In, and S precursors, respectively. In the first step for ZnS synthesis, 1.0 mol of ZnCl2 was dissolved in distilled water, and 1.0 mol of Na2S was added slowly to the solution, and then stirred to homogeneity for 2 h. The final solution was transferred to an autoclave for heat-treatment. Zinc was sulfurized during the thermal treatment at 120 °C for 15 h in a nitrogen environment. The resulting precipitate was obtained, washed with acetone, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The synthesis of bimetallic ZnxInySz particle was in accordance with the synthesis method of ZnS, but the molar ratios of Zn:In:S in the starting materials for Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 were adjusted to 2:1:3.5, 1:1:2.5, and 1:2:4, respectively. Consequently, four kinds of particles which named to ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 were synthesized in this study."
3,Characteristics of synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles,"2.2 Characteristics of synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles The synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were identified by XRD (X'Pert Pro MPD PANalytical 2-circle diffractometer) with a nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (30 kV and 15 mA), scanned at 2θ angles ranging from 10 to 80° at a scan speed of 10° min–1. The sizes and shapes of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were examined by TEM (H-7600, Hitachi, Japan) operated at 120 kV. To investigate the oxidation states of the components in the synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles, XPS (AXIS Nova, Kratos Inc.) spectroscopy measurements of Zn3d, In3d, and S2p were evaluated using a non-monochromatic AlKα X-ray source. The atomic compositions of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were analyzed by elemental mapping images obtained via EDS (EX-250, Horiba). The reflectance UV–vis absorption spectra of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were obtained using a Cary 500 spectrometer. The particle size distributions in aqueous solution for the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were determined by electrophoretic mobility using an electrophoretic light scattering measurement apparatus (ELS 8000, Otsuka Electronics, Japan), performed in a reference beam mode with a laser light source of 670 nm, a modular frequency of 250 Hz, and a scattering angle of 15°. The excited electron amounts on the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles by light were predicted by photocurrent densities using a sun 2000 solar simulator (IVIUM STAT, ABET technologies) under a red light-emitting diode (max = 620 nm)."
4,Hydrogen production from methanol photolysis in aqueous solution using ZnS and ZnxInySz particles,"2.3 Hydrogen production from methanol photolysis in aqueous solution using ZnS and ZnxInySz particles The methanol photocatalytic splitting in aqueous solution was carried out using a liquid typed photoreactor designed in our previous study [37]. For methanol photolysis, the powdered ZnS or ZnxInySz (0.5 g) was added to an aqueous solution composed of methanol (500 mL) and distilled water (500 mL) in a pyrex reactor (2.0 L capacity). Three UV-lamps (6 W cm–2, 20.0 cm length × 2.0 cm diameter, Shinan, Korea) emitting radiation at 365 nm were used. For comparison, methanol photolysis under visible light was carried out for one catalyst that exhibited the best performance. It was conducted in a 50 mL round bottomed flasks sealed with a rubber septum at an ambient temperature and pressure. A 350 W Xenon arc lamp through a UV-cutoff filter (>420 nm) was used as visible-light source. For the photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment, 20 mg of as synthesized H2 evolving photocatalyst powder was suspended in 10 mL aqueous solution containing 10 mL of methanol. Before the light irradiation, the above solution was degassed with argon for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen. The methanol photolysis in aqueous solution was carried out for 10 h with constant stirring. The amounts of evolved hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide gases were measured at intervals of 1 h. The hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide gases produced during methanol photolysis were analyzed using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)-coupled gas chromatography (Master GC, DANI). A ShinCarbonSTMicroPacked column (RESTEK, USA) was equipped, and the injection and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 120 °C, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles Fig. 1 A and B shows the crystallinity obtained from the XRD patterns and TEM images of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles. In Fig. 1A, all of the diffraction peaks in ZnS particle were corresponded to the cubic phase [JCPDS No. 01-0792, F-43 m space group, the lattice constant a = b = c = 5.4 Å] which showed three relatively strong peaks at 2 theta = 28.57°, 47.57°, and 56.40°, belonged to (111), (220), and (311) planes of ZnS [38]. The Zn2InS3.5 particle which having the eight peaks at 2 theta = 23.52° (005), 28.23° (102), 32.74° (014), 39.22° (016), 46.92° (110), 47.02° (108), 51.29° (019), and 55.66° (022), attributed to the c-axis elongated hexagonal Zn3In2S6 [JCPDS No. 80-0835] [39]. With an increase of coexisted indium concentration, the peak intensity was stronger in ZnInS2.5 with no change of peak location. What is unique here was that the broad (111) plane which is the intrinsic property peak in the cubic phase ZnS, moved to the (011) plane due to the coexistence of In. This seems to be attributed that Zn which occupied in the x-axis position of cubic lattice, was substituted by the relatively large indium. Finally when the coexisting concentration of In became twice against the amount of Zn, the crystal had the same peak position as the reported hexagonal phased ZnIn2S4 [JCPDS No. 89-3962] [40]. These results indirectly mean that the ZnxInySz particles synthesized in this study are quite reliable. The singularity in the ZnIn2S4 particle was that the peaks were sharper than those in the both of Zn2InS3.5 and ZnInS2.5 particles, and the crystallite size increased [41]. The crystallite sizes in ZnS, Zn2S3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles were calculated by Debye-Scherrer equation [42], and the sizes were 4.7 (based on 111 plane), 6.7, 6.9, and 15.0 nm (based on 100 plane), respectively. On the other hand, In Fig. 1B, the TEM images of each particle are displayed. The ZnS particle showed a fine spherical shape with average size of 10–20 nm and the particles were connected to each other. In Zn2InS3.5, the particles that appeared like cubic or sheet with a size of 20 × 20 nm were observed at the junction between ZnS particles. This result confirms that the coexistence of In in ZnS shifted the crystal structure from cubic to hexagonal and also changes the morphology from round to sheet. The blended particles started to form large sheet in ZnInS2.5, and these sheet-like particles became wider and thinner in ZnIn2S4, and then finally these particles clustered like a carnation flower as shown in Fig. 2 A-d photo. Fig. 2 A shows the element mapping photos of the synthesized ZnS and ZnxInySz particles, and the atomic compositions analyzed by EDS are displayed in the below table of Fig. 2B. All the components of Zn, S, and In were uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the particles, and the colors for each element increased in proportion to the element concentration. Particularly no aggregation of elements was observed in any particles as a highly dispersed proof. The oxygen and carbon affected the catalytic activity were not observed in any particle, so that it was convinced that there were only a binding between S and Zn or In metals. On the other hand, the actual compositions of Zn, In, and S on the surfaces of particles which obtained from EDS analysis are compared in the below table of Fig. 2B: for ZnS, the Zn:S atomic ratio was 54:46, perhaps supposed that Zn was a little more prevalent than S, but the ratio was still close to the stoichiometric of Zn/S = 1 for ZnS. The molar ratios for Zn:In:S were 2.9:1.0:4.1, 1.5:1.0:2.4, and 1.0:2.3:4.5 in the Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles, respectively. Even though there were some differences, this was predicted to be the limit of the EDS surface methodology, overall the molar ratios of Zn/In were almost quantitatively and reliably obtained. The XPS analysis was employed to determine the chemical composition and bonding configuration of the ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles, and the spectra are presented in Fig. 3 . The peaks which observed at 1044.9 and 1021.9 eV were ascribed to Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2 of the ZnS particle, respectively. The peak at 161.0 eV corresponded to the binding energy of S2p3/2 in the ZnS particle. The binding energies for Zn2p and S2p peaks were consistent with data reported in the other study [43]. For ZnxInySz particles, the binding energies of Zn2p3/2 and In3d5/2 shifted to slightly higher than those in ZnS. For Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles, the Zn2p3/2 peaks were located at binding energies of 1022.0, 1022.4, and 1022.9 eV, respectively. The In3d5/2 peaks for the Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles were exhibited at binding energies of 445.1, 444.9, and 444.8 eV, respectively. Note that the binding energy for In3d5/2 in pure In2S3 was reported at 442–444 eV in other studies [44,45]. Additionally the binding energies of S2p3/2 were also moved to the slightly higher energy locations in ZnxInySz particles than ZnS particle. Some papers reported [46] that the high binding energies of Zn2p3/2 and In3d5/2 of ZnS/In2S3 mixed samples can be attributed to the In5s5p orbital mixed with Zn4s4p. The other papers suggested [47] that the higher binding energy shift in ZnS/In2S3 mixed samples could be attributed to the formations of SZnO and SInO bonds. Indeed both authors asserted that the high binding energy shift for the Zn and In in XPS analysis can correspond to the formation of hetero-junction interfaces between ZnS/In2S3 solid, and consequently the intimate interface contact could effectively improve the charge carrier transfer. The particle stability and surface charge of the ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles in the aqueous phase through dynamic light scattering (DLS) technic and zeta potential (ZP) experiment are evaluated and shown in Fig. 4 . The DLS technique is based on the measurements of time dependent light intensity fluctuations caused by the brown movement of particles in the dispersions. After dispersing ZnS and ZnxInySz particles, the particle size analysis was examined immediately. Over time, the sedimentations between the particles because of the surface charge interaction are formed and so they should be measured in the same time. The particle distribution curves were similar for all particles, but the aggregated particle sizes were various. The particles with the hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 475 to 86 nm were observed, and the average particle size decreased depending on the addition of In. The electrophoretic mobility of a particle in dispersion can be defined in the Smoluchowski formalism [48], and those for the same particles are varied according to the used electrolyte solutions [49]. In this study, the distilled water was used as a solvent for ZP measurements. Indeed, the ZP values should be recorded in a pH range from 3 to 12 for the ZnS and ZnxInySz suspensions in the distilled water. However, the ZP for each particle presented in Fig. 4 were compared only the values at pH = 7 for conditions such as photoreaction to be performed at neutrality. The ZnS particle which dispersed in distilled water was negatively charged about −13 mV, and the particle had more negative charge up to −25 mV in ZnIn2S4 particle. Increasing the ZP value means that the interaction between particles is minimized, either to the positive side or to the negative side which is related to the stability of the particle surface [48,49]. That is, particles are more stable as they move away from the isoelectric point (IEP). From this result, we confirmed that the coexistence of In and Zn in sulfide material increase the surface charge of the particles, reduce interactions between the particles, and ultimately the surface of the activated particles will affect the activity of the catalyst."
7,Spectroscopic properties of ZnS and ZnxInySz particles,"3.2 Spectroscopic properties of ZnS and ZnxInySz particles The photocatalytic efficiency is highly related to light absorption properties. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles are shown in Fig. 5 A. For comparison, the absorbance of pure In2S3 particle synthesized in this study was also presented. The ZnS particle exhibited the fundamental absorption band in the UV light region ∼360 nm. The ZnxInySz particles showed significantly increased absorption in visible light region because of the existence of In2S3 with visible-light response (Eg = 1.82 eV, 650 nm). Depending on the amount of In the degree of red shift of the curves increased proportionally. According to the equation of Eg = 1240/λg, where λg was the optical absorption edge of the semiconductor, the band gap of particles could be estimated. The corresponding Tauc transformed reflectance spectra [50] are shown in Fig. 5B, where the slops of the tangents on horizontal axis are the band-gap energy values. The calculated band-gap energies of ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles were 3.26, 2.51, 2.40, and 2.24 eV, respectively. The valence band spectra were determined from XPS study of the ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles to further understand the electron transfer during methanol photolysis as shown in Fig. 6 A. A broad peak was identified as the valence band of the particles, and the valence bands of the ZnS, Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 particles were observed at 1.44, 1.60, 1.51, and 1.40 eV, respectively. From the band-gaps obtained from UV–vis absorption and the valence band positions determined from XPS measurement, an energy diagram for ZnS and ZnxInySz particles can be predicted as shown in Fig. 6B. Compared to monometallic ZnS particle, all of bimetallic ZnxInySz particles had smaller band-gaps. Note that the positions of the conduction band (CB) energies for semiconductors can be obtained by subtracting the band-gap energies from the valence band (VB) position energies. The CB positions of ZnxInySz particles were located at lower levels than it of ZnS particle. In addition, the most important thing in the photocatalytic reaction is whether the band-gap of the catalyst particles includes the redox potential of the photochemical reaction. Here, we should examine whether the potential energy that decomposes water to generate hydrogen and oxygen is contained in the band-gap of photocatalyst particles. All of the ZnS and ZnxInySz particles contained the redox potentials for hydrogen and oxygen. But it is particularly expected that the water or methanol splitting reaction will occur stably on ZnInS2.5 particle, because it largely contained redox potential and had smaller band gap of 2.4 eV, thus the excitation of electrons can be well performed even weak light source above 365 nm, and eventually the photoreactions for methanol and water splitting will be stably occurred on it. The efficiencies of the process of photogenerated electron–hole production on ZnS and ZnxInySz particles were measured from the photocurrent response under solar light irradiation at an applied potential of 0.7 V vs. SCE. Fig. 7 shows the typical real time photocurrent response of the films when the light source is switched on and off, exhibiting a rapid rise and decay. When the light was turned on, a rapid increase in the photoreduction current was observed, which stabilized at a steady state after a few seconds. When the light was turned off, the photocurrent decreased instantaneously to zero. When the light was turned on, the maximum photocurrent on ZnInS2.5 particle was 12.5 μ A cm−2, which was higher than it on ZnS (0.20 μ A cm−2) particle. Those on Zn2InS3.5 and ZnIn2S4 particles were the almost same to 0.70 μ A cm−2. From this result, we can predicted that the maximum photocurrent on ZnInS2.5 particle could suppressed the recombination rate between excited photoelectrons and holes, resulted in promotion of the methanol photolysis led to increasing the generation of hydrogen cations, and eventually the generated hydrogen cations combined with the electrons of CB to generate hydrogen. This is considered as a result of that the bimetallic zinc indium sulfide has a beneficial effect on the photocurrent by playing the role of a site facilitating the efficient separation of the photogenerated hole–electron pairs."
8,Catalytic performances on ZnS and ZnxInySz particles for methanol photosplitting in aqueous solution,"3.3 Catalytic performances on ZnS and ZnxInySz particles for methanol photosplitting in aqueous solution Fig. 8 summarizes the hydrogen evolution from methanol photolysis in aqueous solution on ZnS and ZnxInySz catalysts. In methanol photolysis with water, the methanol photolysis and hydrogen production followed the next reaction [51]. The anodic compartment methanol is oxidized into carbon dioxide and protons. (1) CH3OH + H2O → CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− These protons are reduced to molecular hydrogen according to the following reaction. (2) 6H+ + 6e− → 3H2 The overall photochemical methanol splitting that allows the production of hydrogen is given by (3) CH3OH + H2O → CO2 + 3H2 In Fig. 8a, we have confirmed that the catalytic activities of ZnxInySz particles were considerably enhanced compared to those of monometallic ZnS and In2S3. The hydrogen generation was hardly observed even after 10 h when In2S3 particle was used as a catalyst. For use of ZnS, H2 of a small amount of 24.5 μ mol g−1 h−1 was collected during methanol photolysis for 10 h. While a significant amount of hydrogen gases were collected on the bimetallic ZnxInySz particles: the produced hydrogen amounts on Zn2InS3.5 and ZnInS2.5 reached 65.5 and 240.5 μ mol g−1 h−1, respectively. However, it was rather lower on the ZnIn2S4 (27.8 μ mol g−1 h−1) with the too much In coexistence. On the other hand, according to the above-mentioned methanol photolysis formula, the molar ratio of produced hydrogen to carbon dioxide is 3:1. However, since the methanol photo-splitting occurs in aqueous solution, it is predicted that the produced carbon dioxide gases are dissolved into aqueous solution, and are present as CO3 2− ion, thus the generation of carbon dioxide was hardly observable in this study. However, the amount of oxygen gases generated in each reaction was only about one tenth of the generated hydrogen as shown in Fig. 8b. The emitted O2 was also partially soluble in water, but it was lighter than carbon dioxide. The amount of O2 was the highest in ZnInS2.5 catalyst as like the amount of hydrogen. For comparison, methanol photolysis for ZnInS2.5 catalyst under visible light using a 350 W Xenon arc lamp through a UV-cutoff filter (>420 nm) was performed and the result is shown in Fig. 9 a. Although the hydrogen production was reduced about 1/5 compared to that under UV light, it was generated with a constant increase width with increasing reaction time, and an average of 4.7 μ mol g−1 h−1 was produced per hour, however, the oxygen did not observe. From these results, we confirmed that the ZnInS2.5 catalyst was also well responsive under visible region. To know the photocatalytic stability, a long-term experiment or repeated experiment is always important. Photocorrosion is considered to be main reason causing the poor stability of photocatalysts, especially the metal sulfide photocatalysts. In this study, cycling test was conducted in which the same experiment repeated five times for 10 h. One cycle included the following steps: After evaluating the hydrogen amount accumulated during 10 h-reaction, all of the gases inside the reactor were vented through purging the Ar gas for 2 h with the light source turned off. And then the light source was turned on again and reacted for 10 h again–the same experiment repeated five times. The results are shown in Fig. 9b. It was found that the amount of hydrogen generation rate was steady up to 3rd-cycle. However, there was a rapid decline in the hydrogen evolution activity from 4th-cycle. Some metal sulfide as like CdS has frequently been reported [52] to be unstable for photocatalytic H2 evolution. S2− in metal sulfide rather than water was self-oxidized by photo-induced holes in the valence band of the metal sulfide, and eventually the same reason was applied to ZnInS2.5 in this study. On the basis of the mentioned characteristics and catalytic performance, an expected mechanism of methanol photocatalytic splitting in aqueous solution on the bimetallic ZnxInySz is shown in Scheme 1 . First, these results were described only in terms of band gap as like Scheme 1a; the optical activity of ZnxInySz having a small band-gap could easily be achieved with a small energy source such as a visible radiation. However, the recombination between the excited electrons and the hole on the particle rapidly also proceed, resulted to a fast catalytic deactivation. However, depending on many optical properties results, we could confirm that more positive In3+ ions with higher reduction potential than Zn2+ ions in ZnxInySz framework acted as a dopant attracting electrons, preventing electrons from being relaxed from the conduction band to the valence band over ZnxInySz as shown in Scheme 1b. As a result, this facilitated the separation between electrons and holes, thereby prevented electron-hole recombination and ultimately helped to maintain catalytic activity constantly. Additionally, S ions in metal sulfide were also possible for capturing photogenerated holes, as following equations [53]. (4) 4 S2− + 2 h+ → S2 2− (5) S2− + 2 h+ → S In particular, the S2− ions would be more active in coexistence of In and Zn ions than in existence of only Zn ion, thus, the consumption of sulfur ions influenced partially to reduction of long term photocatalytic activity. Consequently, the production of hydrogen was improved with the methanol photolysis. Theoretically, it could occur three times more than the amount of hydrogen generated by the water splitting as shown in Scheme 1c."
9,Conclusions,"A monometallic cubic ZnS and three types of bimetallic hexagonal Zn2InS3.5, ZnInS2.5, and ZnIn2S4 catalysts have been synthesized by a classical hydrothermal method. The amount of hydrogen collected during 10 h increased on bimetallic ZnxInySz catalysts compared to it on monometallic ZnS. Especially the produced hydrogen evolution was the best and reached 240 μ mol g−1 h−1 on ZnInS2.5. The ZnInS2.5 catalyst largely contained redox potentials for oxygen and hydrogen and had smaller band gap of 2.4 eV, thus the excitation of electrons could be rapidly performed even under weak light sources above 365 nm, and eventually the photoreactions for methanol and water splitting would be stably occurred on it. In particular, the recombination rate between excited photoelectrons and holes could be suppressed on it so the catalytic activity would be maintained for a long time. Additionally this study predicted a mechanism for increased catalytic activity over ZnxInySz catalyst: the In3+ ions in ZnxInySz lattice acted as a strong electron acceptor, and the sulfur as the counter ion acted pulling the hole, which facilitated the separation between electrons and holes, resulted that the photocatalytic activity was maintained for a long time."
