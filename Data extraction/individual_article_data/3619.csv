0,Introduction,"Over the last few years, the increasing of negative conditions of the environment, linked to the use of fossil fuel and the real need to grant the safety of energy supply, have made of primary importance the development of sustainable renewable sources able to gradually replace the fossil hydrocarbon sources. Among the new paradigm of sustainable energy, H2 and its use by fuel cell technologies is considered a viable alternative fuel for mobile and an ideal energy carrier because it satisfies three main conditions of sustainable development: • low impact on the environment (H20 as by-product after use) • it can be obtained from various renewable sources (water, organic matter, organic refuses) • surplus can be stored and used in the proper time (e.g. when the amount of electric power requested is very high). Furthermore, hydrogen has a high-energy yield of 122KJ/g, as lower heating value, which is 2.42 times greater than methane hydrocarbon fuel [1]. Currently, hydrogen is produced, almost exclusively, by steam reformer of methane and by electrolysis of water (few %) [2,3]. Biological production of hydrogen, using microorganisms, is an exciting new area of technology development that offers the possibility to use a wide variety of low-price renewable feedstock [4] and a suitable improvement of organic waste refuses treatments. Among the biological approaches to generate hydrogen, dark fermentation of organic matter is an attractive option that has a big potential to obtain an economical advantage as H2 production and at the same time, to dispose waste and wastewater without the aid of light coupled with cheap energy requirement [5]. The main criteria for the selection of waste materials to be used in bio-H2 production are: availability, cost, carbohydrate content and biodegradability. Simple sugar such as glucose, sucrose and starch are present in most of the agro-industrial effluents and can be obtained abundantly from agricultural wastes [1]. Hydrogen production pathways in dark anaerobic fermentation from carbohydrates are coupled with acetate–butyrate metabolic pathways [5]. The main species of microorganisms involved in bio-H2 production is Clostridia as reported in [6]. Fang et al. [7] reported that in a mixed culture of hydrogen forming bacteria (HFB) the 70% was of genus Clostridium and 14% belonged to Bacillus species. Clostridium spp. is anaerobic, gram positive and spore-forming bacteria, able to resist to shocks like heat or acid–basic treatments. Moreover Clostridium spp. can achieve the highest H2 yield per mole of glucose in dark anaerobic fermentation (1.61–2.36mol H2/mol glucose) [8,9]. Many researchers candidate the use of Clostridium spp. to enhance bio-hydrogen production [10,11,12] but with higher cost and complexity in comparison with other productive technologies. In order to make bio-H2 production more cost effective, mixed microorganisms, such as activated or digested sludge may be used at mesophilic temperatures [13,14]. During anaerobic digestion methanogenic or sulphate-reducing bacteria, normally present in anaerobic sludge, consume hydrogen produced by acidogenic bacteria. For the inhibition of methanogenic bioactivity many pre-treatment were proposed, for example acidification, basification, freezing and thawing or thermal shock [15–18]. In this work acid-pre-treatment was performed on anaerobic digested sludge to avoid methanogenesis during fermentation and to increases HFB species. Notwithstanding the great interest on dark hydrogen fermentation [19–21] owing to the high complexity of metabolic pathways a formal kinetic study has rarely been reported, even if some kinetic data are available in the literature for specific microorganisms [22,23]. Therefore the aim of this study is to suggest a methodology approach to set-up a formal kinetics for H2 evolution. To this end the kinetics of bio-hydrogen production on glucose by HFB culture was set-up and commented taking into consideration the structural information on enzymes involved in hydrogen production such as Ferrodoxin (Fd) and Hydrogenase available in literature. Kinetics was utilized to study the dynamics of biogas production taking into account pH and ROP variations as consequence of HFB activity."
1,Material and methods,
2,HFB sewage sludge enrichment,"2.1 HFB sewage sludge enrichment The anaerobic microorganisms used in this study were withdrawn from an anaerobic digester of municipal wastewater treatment plant (SMAT, Turin). pH, density, volatile suspended solid (VSS) and total solid concentration (TSS) of the sewage sludge used were: 7.3, 1010mg/l, 10875mg/l and 14500mg/l respectively. The sludge was pre-treted with 1 N HCl solution at pH 3 for 24h at 35°C in anaerobic conditions [13,24]. To avoid differences among the tests all the seeds come from the same pre-treatment batch. At the end of treatment, the sludge was divided in several portions of 50ml each and frozen. Before inoculation the seed was defrozen at ambient temperature and than heated to the working temperature."
3,Fermentation tests,"2.2 Fermentation tests Kinetic studies were carried out in 500ml (450ml working volume) Erlenmeyer flask daily agitated, flushed at the beginning with nitrogen gas for 5min in order to remove air from the system. The treated sludge was used as seed in the ratio of 10% v/v. Glucose initial concentration values tested in batch condition were: 5, 25, 45, 60, 70, 90g/l medium composition was reached by adding micronutrients solution [25] in order to reach 30 as initial C/N ratio. The initial pH of the media was set-up in the range (6.6–7.4) by using 1M NaOH solution. Tests were conducted at 35±1°C in a thermostatic chamber; each measurement is the result of a triplicate test. Tests were stopped after the biogas production shut down. Gas evolution was monitored during the fermentation tests by water-replace method, its composition was measured at the end of lag phase (∼10h) and at the end of fermentation, an average value was considered. At the end of fermentation, the concentrations of ethanol and acetic, propionic and butyric acid were detected. Clostridium spp. count was performed at 10thhour and at the end of the tests. During the tests liquid samples were withdraw in order to measure pH and ROP. A single test was conducted in 2 l bioreactor (Minifors, INFORS, Switzerland) under the following conditions: 60g/l of glucose and micronutrients as above, temperature 35±1°C by thermostatic water circulation, agitation 100rpm. The initial pH was 7.3; pH was readjusted to 6 by 2M NaOH solution when gas production shut down at 60h of fermentation time and when pH reached 4.4 at 150 and 190h of fermentation time. During the fermentation gas evolution was constantly measured with a volumetric gas-counter (Milligascounter, Ritter) and collected in tedlar bags (SKC, 231-05 series)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Before and after acid treatment, Clostridium spp. plate count Protocol” and “Total bacteria count method” [26] were used to evaluate Clostridium bacteria and Total bacteria content respectively. Clostridium bacteria have been grown in anaerobic conditions for three days at 37°C on “Reinforced Clostridial Agar”, adding Polymyxin B sulphate. Total bacteria have been growing on “Plate Count Agar” in aerobic conditions for 48h at 37°C. Gas composition was measured by gas chromatograph (Varian CP, 4900) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD); pH was measured by pH meter (Infors, AG Switzerland); Red-Ox Potential (ROP) was measured by Pt4805-DXK-S8/120 electrode (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). Glucose concentration was measured by enzymatic Bio Analysis (Biopharm-Roche). The concentration of ethanol and acetic, propionic and butyric acid were detected by a gascromatograph (Model 6580, Agilent Inc. USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID)."
5,Kinetics study,"2.4 Kinetics study 2.4.1 Modified “Initial rate-method” Gas production rate was evaluated by linear regression of the volume of total gas produced per unit reaction volume during the exponential phase. Glucose uptake rate was evaluated by linear regression of concentrations during the same exponential phase. This is a kind of Initial Rate Method usually employed for enzymatic reactions [27] that considers negligible the variation of limiting and inhibiting effects on the measuring range. In this case production period starts after a lag phase of about 20h. During exponential phase biogas production and glucose uptake rates show a linear behaviour vs. time till a sharp pH effect (pH 4.3) that shut down fermentation; it confirms the initial rate method hypotheses. Uncertainty was estimated to be around 20% as standard deviation on the repeated tests. 2.4.2 Data analysis Gas production rate, glucose uptake rate were best fitted vs. average glucose concentration. Several kinetic models were considered for gas production to fit experimental data, they are reported in Table 1 . Linear best fit was used for glucose uptake rate. R 2 value was considered in order to choose the kinetic model. The statistically low number of experimental evidences limits R 2 values."
6,Results and comments,"The shape of fermentation along time is similar for all the glucose concentration tested and presents four phases among which different behaviours are observed. Figs. 1–3 report the values of gas production as volume per unit reaction volume, glucose concentration, pH and ROP measured values vs. fermentation time. The fermentation evolves following different phases: 1. During the first 18–22h gas production rate was very low for all the tests ranging between 2 and 7ml/lh, no hydrogen was measured in the gas produced in this period. Table 2 reports the variation of tests measured variables at 10h of fermentation. 2. Between 18 and 22h of fermentation gas production rate sharply increases up to 10–100ml/lh depending on initial substrate concentration; the values reached was maintained up to pH value of 4.2–4.4 after around 30–40h of fermentation. 3. When pH reaches 4.2–4.4 gas production rate decreases sharply and always for all the tests complete stops at pH range 3.2–4.0. 4. After the gas production stops, glucose continues to be consumed at reduced rate till complete arrest of fermentation. Gas production rate has different values among the four phases, during the first two phases it is constant. Measured glucose uptake rate shows similar values in the first three phases and slows down in the fourth phase. pH decreases in all the phases, much more rapidly during the first phase. ROP decreases during the first phase, falls down at the end of the first phase till to −400 to −500mV; it increases very slowly during the exponential phase and increases strongly during the third phase, reaching a value in the range −100 to −300mV. During the first phase gas production is in a lag phase, during the second phase gas production is in exponential phase, i.e. medium composition changes do not affect hydrogen production, during the third phase hydrogen production is inhibited by the low pH values, during the fourth phase gas production is completely stopped by the low pH values. In Table 3 are reported the main results of the tests performed."
7,Microbiological analysis,"3.1 Microbiological analysis Total bacteria count and Clostridium spp. count were performed on the sludge used for the kinetic tests before and after acid-pre-treatment and during fermentation [29]. Results are shown in Table 4 . Total bacteria and Clostridium spp. survive over the treatment with a percentage equal to 25% and 70% respectively. Furthermore germination time of spores, which are insensible to acid treatment, is longer than the duration of the Clostridium spp. count; hence the methodology used does not consider colonies formed by spores. The results show that the acid treatment is highly selective for Clostridium spp. with respect to the other bacteria. Clostridium spp. multiplied ten times after 10h of fermentation and other thousand times at the end of fermentation."
8,Lag phase,"3.2 Lag phase During the first period the microorganisms are active but there was not yet favorable conditions in order to have the hydrogen evolution. Notwithstanding pH and ROP are reduced along the lag phase, pH remains in the neutral range (pH>6.5) and ROP remains in the low reductive range (ROP>−200mV). Several phenomena occur during the lag phase owing to the presence of different bacterial species. Facultative bacteria can evolve their metabolism towards the biosynthesis of ethanol, i.e. Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are able to produce either ethanol in anaerobic condition on glucose carbon, as well as acetic acid from Acetyl-CoA [30]. Following ethanol metabolic pathway all NADH produced is consumed; in other words ethanol biosynthesis pathway is in full competition with metabolic products that are coupled with NADH regeneration for their biogenesis such as H2. Acetic acid is produced in low quantities reducing pH and lowering the ROP till to enable Clostridium spp. to activate the acetic and butyric pathways to produce H2. The production of molecular hydrogen maintains the electron balance, in which proton acts as electron acceptors and substrate acts as electron donors [31]; this can occurs only if an adequate difference of electrical potential exist as driving force, i.e. ROP reaches an adequate value. Glucose uptake generates ATP, NADH and NADPH through glycolysis pathway and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. NADH and NADPH, in anaerobic condition, need to be oxidized to NAD+ and NADP+ for cell activity [32]. The reoxidation processes are activated by iron-sulphur protein that acts as electron donors in many systems interacting with flavoproteins, hemoproteins and other more complex iron–sulphur proteins [33]. For Clostridium spp. it is well accepted the role of a structural protein such as ferrodoxin Fd able to transfer electron to H+ mediate by Hydrogenase enzyme [33]. Whereas the [Fe]-Fd-hydrogenase function is to remove excessive reducing equivalent during fermentation by strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridia [34]. [Fe]-Fd-hydrogenase is an oxidation–reduction active group in the chain transfer electron from carbohydrate to proton able to generate hydrogen [35] via pyruvate synthesis in anaerobic acetogenic bacteria [31]. The key point to be considered is that the Fd forms a complex as Fd·Fd NADP+ reductase, found in Clostridium acetobutylicum [28]. The interactions between Fd and the complex are strongly affected by the pH of the medium [33]. At pH near neutral values (6–7) a proton is taken up when Fd and Fd·NADP+ reductase form a complex. The complex dissociation constant depends on pH: for pH>8.5 Fd is all in the complexed form while, for pH<8.5 free Fd appears, this suggests that the ROP of Fd is strongly affected by the pH value. In other word when the pH decreases more the Fd is free and its ROP shifts towards its reductive value −425mV [36]. Thus the lowering of pH provokes a reductive environment (Fd acts as electron donor), high pH provokes an oxidative environment (Fd acts as electron acceptor). Free Fd is predominantly in the oxidized form (Fd3+) and presents a lower capacity to act as donor electron to proton via Hydrogenase to form hydrogen. In such condition, electrons produced by the oxidation of pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA were used to produce alcohols and lactate instead of hydrogen. The lowered reducing power of Fd·NADP+ reductase probably was not used to form molecular hydrogen as terminal electron acceptor, on the contrary part of reduced Fd produced was used to generate NADH, it leads against the hydrogen production. Uyeda and Rabinowitz [37] demonstrate that low potential electron donors, like reduced Fd, can drive the reductive carboxylation of Acetyl-CoA. Otherwise it is well know that Clostridium spp. does not grow well at low pH<5 [10], as verified also in the present study and at high glucose concentration [4,5]. Other researchers detected the production of ethanol and butanol in the experiment using mixed sludge from municipal wastes [13] as occurs in the case of facultative bacteria K. pneumoniae [30]. Hence one can argue that in the lag phase there is a low activity of the HFB, due to the presence of facultative microorganisms, which take advantage from the presence of micro aeration zones in the broth. The most active microorganisms could be the facultative ones and the metabolic pathways were oriented towards the formation of metabolites different than hydrogen due to the difficulties of Fd and Hydrogenase to transfer electron owing to the high value of pH and ROP. During lag phase pH slightly decreases while ROP remains at very lightly reductive values (refers to Table 2). From this analysis, we suggest that in the lag phase, probably, the biomass activity were oriented to organize the “environment” to allow Clostridium spp. to activate the hydrogen production. At the end of lag phase a metabolic shift occurs and ROP value rapidly decreases up to reach values ranging in −400mV and −550mV, enabling reoxidation of NADH and NADPH with hydrogen that acts as electron acceptor (refers to Fig. 4 ). In the spirit to highlight the experimental evidences it is important to recall a metabolic pathway of glucose. Owing to the presence of a microorganism consortium it is impossible to refer at a specific pathway of glucose. Taking in mind the origin of the biomass used one can agree that at least, the following species might be present: escherichia, salmonella, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter [38,39] and obviously, together with clostridium spp. All the species present are able to activate the acid fermentation with the possibility of an alcoholic fermentation too [40]. In Fig. 4 are depicted a “virtual” metabolic pathway of glucose which accounts for the main microorganisms present in the HFB culture able to produce metabolites such as acetic, propionic, butyric, ethanol, the biomass itself and H2 and CO2. Chen et al. [10] observed that Clostridium butyricum on sucrose starts to produce hydrogen at the end of the exponential growth when the microorganisms had entered in early stationary phase. This means that during the lag phase, glucose is mainly consumes for biomass growth. Thus, one can suppose that during the lag phase electrons mainly flow towards biosynthesis and not used for hydrogen evolution. The reason of this behaviour remains to be explained."
9,Exponential phase,"3.3 Exponential phase The second phase starts at around the 20th hour of fermentation. During this phase gas production rate and glucose uptake rate are constant (Refers to Figs. 1 and 2). The duration of exponential phase changes from test to test ranging in 10–30h. It ends when pH goes down under a threshold, the comparison of Fig. 1 with Fig. 3a on the time axis shows that the biogas evolution starts when the pH of the medium reaches the value of approximately 6.5 and continues until the pH remains over 4.5. As reported above, the lowering of the pH provokes an increase of Fd free, shifting the ROP towards reductive values. Whereas for the production of H2 it is necessary that the [Fe]·Fd·hydrogenase complex donates the electron to the proton. Hydrogenase in H2 production was studied since several decades [41], in particular Chen and Blanchard [42] discovered a second hydrogenase (Hydrogenase II) in Clostridium pasteurianum in addition to Hydrogenase I, with the presence of two [8Fe–8S] clusters able to activate the red-ox reaction. Hydrogenase II as well as Hydrogenase I can able to evolve H2 with Fd as the sole electron carrier. Adams and Mortenson [43] studied the physical and catalytic properties of Hydrogenase II compared with Hydrogenase I, in particular the effect of pH on hydrogenase that catalysed H2 evolution. Hydrogenase I have the maximal efficiency at pH=6.3, Hydrogenase II have the maximal efficiency at pH=5.8 and at pH<5 the activity of both the enzymes rapidly decreases. It is interesting to note that during exponential phase pH ranges between 4.4 and 6.5 (refers Figs. 1 and 3a) at pH=5 Clostridium spp. activity shuts down [10]. The above considerations suggest that the role of pH in the H2 production is strongly linked with the Hydrogenase activity [44]. The positive effects as a consequence of pH decrease are: the release of Fd from the complex Fd·NADP+ reductase which provokes a more reductive ambient [44] and the formation of an optimal spatial conformation of Hydrogenase I and II with a maximum activity of enzyme pool [45]. The increase of ROP during the exponential phase (refers Fig. 3b) indicates that in the medium the availability of electrons decreases because the system moves towards a less reductive range. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of pH and ROP (electron availability) is reported in Section 3.5."
10,Kinetics evaluation,"3.4 Kinetics evaluation Gas production rate, glucose uptake rate were best fitted vs. average glucose concentration. Several kinetic models were considered for gas production to fit experimental data, they are reported in Table 1. Gas production rate shows a limitation at low substrate concentration and an inhibition at high substrate concentration. No theoretical findings help to choice a kinetic model among others; hence the best-fit criterion was used to select the regression model. Substrate inhibition is sharper than both Haldane and exponential models can consider; polynomial of III degree is necessary to reach an acceptable R 2 value. Gas production rate experimental data and the model curve are reported in Fig. 5 , maximum production rate of about 100ml/lh is reached at a glucose concentration of about 58g/l. Linear best fit was used for glucose uptake rate, 0.94 R 2 value was obtained. Experimental data and regression curve for glucose kinetics are reported in Fig. 6 : a first order kinetics was set-up. The difference between the kinetics of glucose consumption and biogas evolution is not a surprise owing to the use of unstructured modeling approach [46] that is not able to give insight about the complexity of the system under study, nevertheless it permits to have a good reference model for the design of a reactor and to predict the dynamics of the system."
11,Dynamics of biogas evolution,"3.5 Dynamics of biogas evolution Using the found kinetic equations, the present paragraph is aimed to highlight the dynamic of the system by a macro-approach [47]. In analyzing such complex system, as schematized in Fig. 4, a reduction of complexity is necessary. The aim of macro-approach analysis is to find the controlling phenomena, which determine the dynamic of the whole system. To find the controlling step, using the terminology of the Chemical Reaction Engineering, it is necessary to put the macro-phenomena, i.e. observable phenomena experimentally detectable, on the time axis using a relaxation time parameter [48,49]. A macro-schematization of pathways of Fig. 4 is reported in Fig. 7 according with the experimental detected parameters. Three macro-phenomena can be defined and the corresponding relaxation time must be evaluated: 1. glucose uptake producing electrons by the following macro reaction: (1) Glucose → Pyruvate + e − 2. proton production generating the variation of the pH in the broth by the following macro reaction: (2) Pyruvate → VFA → H + 3. hydrogen production experimentally detected by the biogas evolution by the following macro reaction: (3) 2 H + + 2 e − → + H 2 The reactions (2) and (3) are in parallel among them and in series to the reaction (1). Evidence of this comes from a test (not reported in the present article) conducted with continuous pH control with NaOH: during H2 evolution a contemporary consume of the base occurred. It is important to remark that the serial reactions are controlled by the slowest reaction while parallel reactions are controlled by the most rapid reaction. It is necessary to clarify that the above reactions are only a macro-schema in order to link the experimentally measured macro-parameter with such mechanisms. The proton of reaction (2) and (3) are topologically different: the first is external of the cell machinery and is responsible of pH variation occurring in the broth while the second is insight the cell that is detected as hydrogen gas. For each of the above macro-reactions it is possible to estimate the respective relaxation time. For glucose uptake a first order kinetics was observed, thus the relaxation time is a constant: (4) τ Gl = 1 / k For biogas production a non-linear kinetics was observed, the relaxation time depends on substrate concentration; it can be estimate by the following [49]: (5) τ P = [ r P ( S ) / S ] − 1 for H+ production the relaxation time τ H + was estimated via the experimental pH values following the definition of relaxation time [48] i.e. relaxation time is the value of time corresponding to the 63% (1−1/e) of variation from initial and final H+ concentration occurred. The relaxation time of the three macro-reaction vs. glucose concentration is reported in Fig. 8 . In it the substrate concentration dominium can be divided in two main parts: part A in which the production of e− is the controlling step it takes almost the whole range of glucose concentration investigated; part B, at very low glucose concentration, where the release of H+ in the medium becomes the slowest phenomenon, i.e. the H+ formation is the limiting step of the microbial activity. Part A may be divided in two zones: zone A1 where the production of the proton is the faster phenomenon τ H + < τ p , i.e. the dynamics is the decrease of the pH and an accumulation of the electron with a modification of the environment towards a more reductive electrical potential. Zone A2 where the biogas production becomes the faster phenomena τ H + < τ p , i.e. the dynamics is a change of the rate of pH decreasing, because the protons generated by reaction (2) are partially consumed and an empowering of available e− occurs. This originated a shift towards a more oxidative potential i.e. when the hydrogen is produced the ROP moves in more positive range against H2 reference electrode. In part B at low glucose concentration in which the controlling step becomes the pH variation ( τ H + > τ G 1 > τ P ) , the global reaction proceeds very slowly owing to the difficulty of the microorganisms to change the pH only for endogenous phenomena. This analysis is valid for the exponential phase because the kinetics were evaluated in this range; nevertheless, in our opinion, at the light of the above dynamic considerations, the apparently strange behaviours of pH and ROP reported in Fig. 3a and b are elucidated. In fact in all the tests the pH presented two rates of variation and the ROP shows a decrease towards reductive value; when the biogas evolution goes in the exponential phase, quickly ROP moves towards oxidative range. Recalling the structural considerations found in the literature about the spatial configuration of Fd and Hydrogenase I and II as pH dependent [44] one could argue that the dynamic analysis and activities of enzymes are coherent. This thanks to the macro-approach even if it presents a low degree of precision but a good degree of exactness in Zadeh sense [50]."
12,Test in bioreactor,"3.6 Test in bioreactor In order to check the robustness of the dynamics considerations a fermentation test using a bioreactor with external (no endogenous) pH variation was done. The test was conducted at 60g/l of initial glucose concentration and the seed (10% v/v) was treated as reported in Material and Methods. The Fig. 9 shows the behaviour of the fermentation during time: after the “natural” decrease, pH was varied three times by adding NaOH in order to reach the range of optimal enzymes activity (6.8–5.4). In all cases the ROP was lowered and biogas evolution restarted even if with different rate. The test demonstrates, in our opinion, the validity of kinetics and dynamics considerations supported by the spatial structural role of the Fd and Hydrogenase I and II as reported in literature. In particular from Fig. 9 at each pH adjustment the increase of pH provokes a decreases of ROP, although this effect is not of the same magnitude. This fact might be due to not completely reversible spatial structure of enzymes. The elucidation of this aspect is out the scope of the present investigation and needs more details from theoretical as well as experimental point of views. As concerns biogas production a comparison between flask and bioreactor test might be done at 65h before pH adjustment and at 60g/l of initial glucose concentration. During this time the only difference is agitation, an increase of biogas production of bioreactor test is observable. The quantification of this effect is reported in Section 3.7. As shown in Fig. 9 the pH adjustment increases total biogas production of about 6 times."
13,Yield,"3.7 Yield The efficiency of such bioreaction is an important parameter to evaluate the process; to do it a maximum reference yield needs to be defined. In presence of mixed microorganisms and considering the complex pathways for the production of several VFA, the evaluation of the theoretical H2 yield is doubtful, due to the fact that some bacteria consume H2 as well as others produce alcohols and other bacteria produce H2 simultaneously to VFA production [51]. The stoichiometry of hydrogen production from glucose is linked to three main global reaction [5]: C6 H12 O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 C6 H12 O6 +2H2 →2CH3CH2COOH+2H2O C6 H12 O6 →CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 They account for acids formation metabolic pathway coupled with hydrogen formation. Considering that each metabolic product is coupled with different stoichiometric H2, the question how to take into account the different mole of hydrogen produced per mol of compound needs to be solved in order to evaluate the yield of H2 referred to 1mol of carbon source. To over pass the above question, the Authors suggest to evaluate experimentally the quantities of the metabolites and consequently correct the stoichiometric yield for each compound and finally to find a theoretical reference yield value by the following equation: (6) Y ∗ = ∑ j m Y j ∗ w j The reference yield means the maximum H2 production per mole of glucose; Yj is the stoichiometric H2 yield for every j-m compound and wj the weight experimentally determined in reference to the total VFA and ethanol quantities. Equation (6) presents the advantage to link the Y ∗ to the specific fermentation i.e. the quality of carbon source as well as the microorganisms used. Table 5 shows the application of the suggested procedure: wj is experimentally evaluated as mean value obtained for all test at the end of fermentation; its variability is about 10%. The reference H2 yield (Y ∗) valid only for the actual fermentation, is equal to 1.66mol H2/mol of glucose. This value represents again a maximum theoretical value because of the difficulty to evaluate the quantity of glucose consumed for cellular growth. This difficulty arises because the total suspended solid at the origin in the feed masks the biomass growth vanishing the precision of the measure. The quantitative measure of the microorganisms involved in the hydrogen production in presence of HFB consortium, in our opinion, remains an open question from experimental point of view in order to have an acceptable precision of the measure. Lastly in Table 6 are reported the efficiency ξ the ratio between the actual Y a and the reference yield Y ∗ as measure of effectiveness of the fermentation. The comparison of the efficiency of the test carried out by bioreactor with external pH adjustment modification, against the test with endogenous pH adjustment, shows an increase in H2 production of 2.8 times. Nevertheless not all this increase can be attribute to pH variation because the test with bioreactor presents a degassing effect of biogas due to agitation. In fact the evaluation of the efficiency at 65h i.e. before the first pH adjustment, shows a value of ξ =0.30. Hence the effect of agitation increases efficiency of 30%, while the effect of pH adjustment, increase the efficiency more than 100%."
14,Conclusions,"In the present article a detailed kinetics was set-up for the glucose consumption as well as for the biogas evolution using an enriched HFB biomass. The glucose consumption was found to be of first order kinetics while for the biogas evolution an inhibited kinetics appeared over 58g/l of glucose with a maximum production rate of 100ml/lh, the H2 content ranged in (40–60) %. As concerns the use of the kinetics in the prediction of the behaviour of bioreactor, it is to be highlighted the positive effect of mixing which is able to degas the biogas dissolved in the medium, increasing consequently the H2 production. In the present study this effect was estimated around 30%, in other words, the present kinetics from a quantitative point of view represents a conservative estimation. The kinetics was used to highlight the dynamics of the biogas evolution using a macro-approach and the relaxation time tools, to explain the experimental detected behaviours of the pH and ROP during the tests. Taking into consideration the behaviour of the Fd and Hydrogenase enzymes pools in the electron transfer chain linked with their spatial structure, the dynamics appears to be coherent with. In particular the role of the pH seems the most important parameter in the regulation of enzymes pool involved in H2 evolution. To verify the above sentence a test by bioreactor was carried out with external pH modification in order to adjust the pH within the optimal range. The test evidences an increasing of the efficiency of the glucose conversion into H2 of 1.13 times compared with test without external pH regulation. Lastly an experimental procedure to evaluate a reference yield of H2 on glucose taking into account the VFA produced as well as ethanol from the HFB microorganisms was proposed and applied for the actual fermentation case."
