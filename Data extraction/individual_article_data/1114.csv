0,Introduction,"Currently, owing to the increase in population and drastic monetary development, the world requires large amount of energy to utilize. Up to now, fossil fuel is the primary energy resource for the functioning of all kinds of artificial, human made and industrial activities [1–3]. Consequently, fossil fuels releases more toxic gases and pollute the clean environment [4]. Meanwhile, the sources of fossil fuels are significantly quenched owing to random utilization. More scientists and research groups have been working hard to explore alternative clean energy resources [5,6]. In light of they found hydrogen as a cleaner and renewable energy resource due to its extraordinary advanced characteristics like nontoxic, high energy density, and highly sustainable nature [7,8]. To date, among the available conventional and commercial strategies photocatalytic water splitting mechanism under the sunlight irradiation is an ideal pathway for hydrogen fuel production [9]. Till today, oxide-based semiconductors such as TiO2 [10,11], SnO2 [12], ZnO [13,14] BiOCl [15], MOFs [16], TiO2/C [17], TiO2-MIL-101 [18], CdS@ g-C3N4 [19], CdS@ MnS [20] have been used for hydrogen fuel production through the photocatalytic reaction. On the other hand, semiconductors such as CdS, MoS2, CoS2, and graphitic carbon nitride have been found to produce hydrogen fuel through the photocatalytic reaction [21–23]. Amid these all kinds of oxide, sulfide, and carbon-related compounds, CdS is the most promising visible, active photocatalyst that gained considerable attention towards hydrogen fuel production. CdS has a wide energy band gap (2.42 eV), optimum photo redox potentials, and efficient to create photo-induced charge carriers [15]. Nevertheless, hydrogen fuel production with larger quantities using CdS nanostructure is restricted due to its larger recombination rate. Probably, 92% of light-induced electron-hole pairs are recombining over the period of 10−10 s and the total quantum efficiency of solar light-driven water splitting mechanism towards the hydrogen fuel production is quenched [24]. Meanwhile, a larger probability of photo corrosion, poor stability, and lower chemical acceleration rate of water splitting mechanism is also a leading causes for the lower production rate of CdS nanostructure. To enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CdS, noble metals like platinum, palladium, gold, and rubidium were exploited as co-catalysts [25–27]. However, these noble metals are costly and non-abundant elements on earth. So, noble elements were not suggestible for increasing the photocatalytic performance under the sunlight through the CdS nanostructures. Hence, the design and production of noble metal-free, highly active, durable, and most stable photocatalytic material is hugely enviable. In this direction, numerous noble metal-free nano compounds were scrutinized towards the hydrogen evolution through the water splitting mechanism, which includes metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, metal alloys, and organic as well as inorganic compounds [28,29]. Among these complexes, a familiar metal oxide compound MoS2 nanostructure was recognized as a promising noble metal-free photocatalytic material for the efficient hydrogen evolution through the water splitting [22]. Since MoS2 has two-dimensional structures of perpendicularly stacked S-Mo-S layers bonded with van der Waals forces. Even so, as a co-catalyst MoS2 supports better photocatalytic activity only on metal edges and on defect sites. Further, to enhance the hydrogen evolution rate, numerous ways have been developed like morphology evolution, modifying band structure, creating dislocations, defect sites, and tuning of phase. An amalgam nanostructure with more than dual compounds shows potential and reliable performance towards the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. However, the hybrid nanostructure of CdS/MoS2 is essentially suffered from two significant constraints. The first one is lower electrical conductivity, and the second one is less surface area to volume ratio. These reasons indicated that the hydrogen production with CdS/MoS2 nanostructures is decreased due to fewer charge carriers and a lack of photoactive centers [30–32]. To increase hydrogen production rate, we synthesized and tried more nanostructures as a dual co-catalysts. In our trials we noticed SeS2 bandgap is close to MoS2 band gap, hence used SeS2 as co-catalyst. Dual co-catalyst MoS2-SeS2 on the surface of the CdS nanorods inhibits the recombination rate of charge carriers by the transformation of light-induced electrons through the simple paths, so it is a very well approach to generate the hydrogen fuel through the photocatalytic water splitting mechanism. The novelty of present research work is that (i) all the samples of CdS, MoS2, SeS2 and CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites were fabricated through the facile solvothermal method. (ii) The physicochemical properties of prepared CdS, CdS/MoS2 and CdS/MoS2-SeS2 were studied. (iii) Observed high photocatalytic hydrogen production for 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite. (iv) The photocatalytic H2 production mechanism of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite was anticipated through obtained outcomes. (v) Compared the H2 evolution rate of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite with the previous reports and presented in Table 1. For the first time, we report photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of heterostructured hybrid CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite without any noble metal and organic surfactant. The photocatalytic efficiency of all the prepared nanocomposites was examined in the aqueous media under artificial sunlight irradiation using lactic acid as a sacrificial agent for hole capturing. The obtained photocatalytic measurements predict that CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites showed better photocatalytic evolution rate of 168.93 mmol g−1 h−1, and it is significantly more considerable than that of pristine CdS, CdS/MoS2, CdS: Pt, CdS: CoP and CdS: RGO nanocomposites [33–36]. We firmly trust that the comprehensive results reported herein will play a considerable role in steering the design and development of different photocatalytic materials and their utilization for hydrogen fuel production using solar light through the water splitting mechanism."

6,Synthesis of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites,"2.5 Synthesis of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites To synthesize CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites, the required weight percentages of MoS2-SeS2 (6 wt% of MoS2 and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt% of SeS2) were first dispersed in 60 mL mixture of de-ionized water and ethanol and sonicated for 4 h. After 4 h of ultrasonication, the suspension was light black. Then prepared CdS nanorods (50 mg) were quickly poured into the MoS2-SeS2 black dispersion. The mixture was stirred overnight and then sonicated for 8 h to achieve close interfacial contact between the MoS2-SeS2 and CdS nanorods. CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites were collected. The final product was collected and washed several times with ethanol and de-ionized water to remove impurities, and finally heated at 100 °C for 8 h to obtain a final product."
7,Characterization,The microstructure properties were measured using a JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Crystal phase of the as-prepared powders was determined using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray source.

The optical absorption measurements were performed using a Shimadzu UV-1800 double-beam spectrophotometer to detect the bandgap of the nanocomposites. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed at room temperature using Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm.
8,Results and discussion,"Nanoscale CdS/MoS2-SeS2 hybrid structures were fabricated through the solvothermal route, and the synthesis procedure was represented in Scheme 1. In the synthesis process, at the first stage, MoS2 and SeS2 nanostructures were prepared through the solvothermal route. At the second stage, the one-dimensional nanostructure of CdS was synthesized through the solvothermal method. At last, by using the above-synthesized nanostructures, CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites were synthesized through the ultra-sonication process via wet chemical solution."
9,Morphological studies,"4.1 Morphological studies The morphological evolution of nanostructure plays an important role in the photocatalytic water splitting phenomenon corresponding to the larger surface area to volume ratio. To examine the dimensionality of the synthesized nanostructure composite, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) embedded with the energy dispersive analysis of X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) was used. Fig. 1(a–d) illustrates the TEM embedded with EDAX images of optimized CdS/MoS2-SeS2 (6 wt%) nanocomposite. Fig. 1(a, b) shows that the synthesized MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite/dual co-catalyst is well attached with one-dimensional CdS nanorods. Meanwhile, Fig. 1(c, d) the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy also corroborated the existence of all CdS and MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites and clear lattice fringes of CdS is around 0.35 nm, MoS2 around 0.83 nm and SeS2 is around 0.68 nm observed from Gatan microscopy suite and diameter of 30–40 nm [37,38]. Moreover, Fig. 2(a–e) represents the energy-dispersive spectroscopic analysis and corresponding mapping of prepared nanostructures. The comprehensive analysis reveals the successful preparation of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites, where the two-dimensional MoS2-SeS2 nano-thin films were completely layered on the one-dimensional CdS nanostructures. From TEM analysis it is clear that CdS nanorods are decorated with MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite which is helpful for increasing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. Fig. 2(a) shows the HAADF image of optimized 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2. Furthermore, the EDS analysis suggests that Cd, S, Mo, and Se existence with the expected stoichiometric ratio, it is shown in Fig. 2(b–e). Herein, Mo and Se were dispersed largely compared to the cadmium and sulfide ions, and it could be due to less atomic percentage of MoS2-SeS2 than CdS nanorods. From these analyses, we are speculated that the present synthesized nanocomposites afford better photocatalytic activity performance through the bifurcation of charge carriers and quenching of electron-hole recombination."
10,Structural studies and XPS analysis,"4.2 Structural studies and XPS analysis X-ray diffraction measurements were carried for the bare CdS, CdS/MoS2, CdS/SeS2, and CdS/MoS2-SeS2 (6 wt%) nanostructures to examine the phase purity and crystal structure, the obtained prototype of XRD is presented in Fig. 3(a). The XRD patterns show that pristine CdS nanorods possess a typical hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure and are confirmed with the JCPDS file number 89–2944 [39]. Simultaneously, the original structure of CdS didn't alter with the loading of MoS2, SeS2, and MoS2-SeS2 to the CdS nanorods. It could be due to the lower concentrations of catalysts MoS2, SeS2, and co-catalyst MoS2-SeS2. In addition to that, the intensity of XRD nodes was augmented with the incorporation of MoS2-SeS2 dual co-catalysts owing to the occupation of co-catalysts atoms on the surface of the CdS host lattice. Furthermore, no X-ray diffraction peaks corresponding to the spurious phases of Cd, S, Mo, and Se were noticed within the XRD instrument's resolution power, and it indicates the high purity of the synthesized nanocomposites [40]. The chemical state, atomic configuration and impurity phase of nanocomposites were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3(b) shows the XPS scanning survey of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 (6 wt%) nanocomposites and narrow scans of Cd, Mo, Se, and S elements. Preliminarily, it is evident that all the expected elements were present in the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 composite with suitable oxidization states. Fig. 3(c) depicts the XPS narrow scan of Cd element in CdS/MoS2-SeS2 composites. The XPS replica's narrow scan possesses two broad nodes in the binding energy locations of 404.09 eV and 412.07 eV with the atomic configuration of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 through the binding energy separation of 8.98 eV. It suggests that Cd ions were present in the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 with 2+ oxidization state [41]. On the other hand, Fig. 3(d) shows the XPS narrow scan of anion element S. Herein, XPS narrow scan consists of one broad peak in the binding energy region of 161.07 eV and a moderate hump in the energy location of 162.08 eV with the atomic pattern of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 by the binding energy gap of 1.02 eV, and it is corroborated that S ions were occupied in the respective locations with the oxidization state 2+ [40]. Fig. 3(e) represents the XPS narrow scan of Mo in CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. Mo's narrow scan possesses two broad peaks in the binding energy locations of 229.01 eV and 232.01 eV are ascribed to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 correspondingly [43]. It indicates that Mo ions were occupied in the cation sites with an appropriate oxidization state. Finally, Fig. 3(f) illustrates the XPS narrow scan of the Se element in the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. The narrow scan has two prominent nodes in the binding energy regions of 54.05 eV and 55.04 eV. These emerged peaks were endorsed with Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively [44]. Hence, the detailed XPS analysis reveals that all expected target compositions are present in the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites with their appropriate oxidization states. The spurious phases related to the elements and to their byproducts were not observed in the XPS spectra indicates the purity of the final synthesized nano-product."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution studies,"4.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution studies The photocatalytic water splitting performance of prepared pristine CdS, CdS/MoS2, and CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites was estimated under the simulated sunlight irradiation towards the hydrogen production in the solution of aqueous media and lactic acid as a sacrificial agent. In this direction, Fig. 4(a) represents photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in MoS2 loaded CdS nanorods. Figure shows that, in the absence of MoS2 catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate is inferior and approximately equals to 2.54 mmol g−1 h−1. It might be due to CdS compound constraints such as high photo corrosion characteristics and the tremendous recombination rate of charge carriers [45]. Simultaneously, with increasing the loading weight of MoS2 co-catalyst to the CdS nanorods, the magnitude of hydrogen evolution rate increases up to 6 wt% with the H2 production quantity of 123 mmol g−1 h−1. This hydrogen evolution rate is nearly 48 times that of bare CdS nanorods. Meanwhile, beyond the 6 wt% of MoS2, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate decreases due to the increase of turbidity nature of the solution [46]. Hence, 6 wt% of MoS2 is the optimum dosage concentration for CdS nanorods as a co-catalyst towards hydrogen production. To enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate in the synthesized nanocomposites, MoS2-SeS2 was used as a dual co-catalyst to the CdS nanorods functioning under the artificial light irradiation. Fig. 4(b) illustrates the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of MoS2-SeS2 loaded CdS nanorods. From the Fig. 4(b), it is evident that, at 6 wt% of MoS2-SeS2 composite loading on CdS nanorods, a better hydrogen evolution rate (HER) was achieved with the magnitude of 168.93 mmol g−1 h−1, and it is 67 times greater than that of HER of bare CdS nanorods. The effect of MoS2 and SeS2 co-catalysts is clearly observed in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, for MoS2 catalyst we observed that 6 wt% catalyst loaded on CdS is having more catalytic activity and for MoS2-SeS2 dual co-catalyst with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt%, 6 wt% of SeS2 loaded on CdS/MoS2 exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. Therefore, the percentage of co-catalyst loading on the pure CdS has significant importance. The obtained hydrogen evolution rate of nanocomposite CdS/MoS2-SeS2 was compared with previous reported materials, these are presented in Table 1. We performed XRD analysis for 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 sample after photocatalytic hydrogen production analysis, we did not noticed structural variation after using the sample in photocatalytic hydrogen production (shown in S1). Meanwhile, we perform the photocatalytic hydrogen production for pure CdS, CdS/MoS2 and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 samples for five hours, drawn the kinetic curves per each hour to notice how the hydrogen production rate is increasing and is shown in Fig. S2. The obtained enhanced hydrogen evolution in the prescribed nanocomposites (CdS/MoS2-SeS2) could be due to the following reasons. Initially, creating a large quantity of photon-induced charge carriers, separation or non-recombination of charge carriers, and migration of electrons towards the surface of catalytic materials. On the other hand, the hydrogen evolution rate is gradually decreased beyond the 6 wt% of MoS2-SeS2 dual co-catalysts on CdS nanorods. It might be due to the following reason. When a large portion of dual co-catalyst is added to the CdS nanorods, a thin layer is formed on the CdS system's surface. Consequently, the penetration of light into the reaction media is inhibited. Therefore, the photocatalytic water splitting mechanical phenomenon is reduced, and the hydrogen evolution rate is also quenched [59]. Fig. 4(c) shows the experimental results of hydrogen evolution for 6 wt% MoS2-SeS2 dual co-catalysts on CdS nanorods over five repeated cycles. From the figure, it is observed that CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites produce the same magnitude of hydrogen fuel (168.93 mmol g−1 h−1) within a constant time of five hours. From these results, it is interesting to note that the hydrogen evolution rate of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites is 1.4 times greater than that of CdS/MoS2 nanocomposites. In the photocatalytic water splitting mechanism towards the hydrogen evolution, the synthesized catalyst dose plays an important parameter. To avoid utilization of large quantity of catalyst dose, it is necessary to notice the most favorable and optimum dosage concentration to obtain the better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Fig. 4(d) shows that, with increasing the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite, the hydrogen evolution rate was gradually decreased and might be due to the creation of agglomeration among the nanostructures and formation of turbidity in reaction media. The effect of lactic acid (sacrificial agent) on hydrogen production rate of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 4(e). By optimizing all experimental conditions, we noticed that, by increasing the lactic acid concentration up to 3 mL, the rate of hydrogen production is gradually augmented. There after hydrogen evolution is quenched by increasing of lactic acid concentration. The reduction of hydrogen production with increased lactic acid concentration might be ascribed to the enhanced viscosity of solution due to the presence of a vast number of lactic acid molecules [60]. Consequently, the penetration of photons into the reaction media is reduced. Further, the reduction of hydrogen production with increased lactic acid concentration might be ascribed to the slow diffusion of reactants and products due to high viscosity of solution. Finally, the stability and recyclability of the as-synthesized CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites is a more important phenomenon for the practical application of catalyst in the direction of hydrogen production. Fig. 4(f) depicts CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite hydrogen evolution rate concerning recycling times. Interestingly, the rate of hydrogen production is almost negligibly decreasing over five complete cycles, indicating the high stability and durability of the prepared CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. Further long term durability experiment was performed up to 50 h and is shown in Fig. S3, the amount of hydrogen evolution rate increased up to 40 h, after which it decreased slightly, it indicates that the catalyst was stable up to 45 h, saturation after 45 h may be due to conversion of lactic acid to pyruvic acid and decrease in the lactic acid concentration. To understand the stability of the catalysts we perform the XRD analysis after photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction, the data shows no structural deviation after catalytic reaction. The results suggest that the synthesized product is highly stable for hydrogen production."
12,Origin of efficient hydrogen evolution rate,"4.4 Origin of efficient hydrogen evolution rate 4.4.1 Optical studies Naturally, the rate of hydrogen production depends on the available photons, free charge carriers, the transition of charge carriers towards the surface of the catalyst, trapping, and defect sites in the as-synthesized nanostructures. To examine the parameters mentioned above, ultraviolet, visible optical absorption spectra, and room temperature photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis was carried out. Fig. 5(a) shows the ultraviolet optical absorption spectroscopy of CdS, CdS/SeS2, CdS/MoS2, and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. The as-synthesized nanostructures optical absorption spectra possess a strong absorption edge in the wavelength region 480–550 nm. They indicate that all the samples are strongly able to absorb the light in the visible portion of electromagnetic radiation. Simultaneously, with the adding of co-catalyst and dual co-catalysts to the CdS nanorods, the optical absorption spectra were shifted towards the longer wavelength region and suggested the decrease of bandgap [61]. The estimated band gap values of the CdS, CdS/MoS2, CdS/SeS2 and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites are in the range of 2.30–2.40 eV calculated from Tauc plots (Fig. S4 (a–d)). The quenching of bandgap might be due to sp-d exchange interactions between band electrons of CdS nanorods and available free charge carriers in the co-catalyst and dual co-catalysts [68]. Fig. 5(b) shows the photoluminescence spectroscopy of CdS, CdS/SeS2, CdS/MoS2, and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. Herein all the samples were excited with the wavelength of 372 nm. From the photoluminescence spectra, all the synthesized nanocomposites possess strong, most prominent, and wide green emission peak in the wavelength region of 524 nm [52]. The creation of this emergence peak at the 524 nm might be due to more trapping and defect sites in the CdS, CdS/SeS2, CdS/MoS2, and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. Further, among the all prepared nanoparticles, bare CdS nanorods possess high luminescence characteristics and the luminescence intensity gradually decreased with the addition of co-catalyst and dual co-catalysts to host lattice. The quenching of luminescence intensity in the PL spectra suggests that non- recombination of photon-induced charge carriers and separation of electron-hole pair in the as-synthesized CdS/SeS2, CdS/MoS2, and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. These optical studies of prepared nanocomposites highly support the photocatalytic characteristics of the samples in terms of charge carrier bifurcation. The light driven charge carriers dynamics also investigated by time-resolved PL spectroscopy (Fig. S5). The time decay curve clearly demonstrated that the lifetime became shorter with the introduction of co-catalysts of MoS2 and SeS2 compared to the bare CdS nanostructures. The shorter lifetime indicated the most efficient carrier transfer from the band gap studies sates of CdS to co-catalyst materials. In this regard, the intensities and dynamics of PL supported the enhanced transfer efficiency of charge carriers in the CdS/MoS2-SeS2, which contributed to the high photocurrent density and stability. 4.4.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photocurrent analyses With the intention to explore the causes behind the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over the 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites, we investigated the electrochemical impedance characteristics of the samples. In general, EIS is a versatile analytical tool widely used to corroborate the presence of charge carriers, bifurcation of charge carriers like electron and hole, migration of charge carriers in the direction of the surface of the catalytic materials. Fig. 5(c) depicts the electrochemical impedance spectra of bare CdS, CdS/SeS2, CdS/MoS2 and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. The diagrams shows that compared to the pristine CdS nanorods, CdS/SeS2 and CdS/MoS2 nanocomposites, 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite possess a small semi-circle. Generally, less radius semi-circles in EIS plots indicate that the prepared compound contains higher conductivity [63]. Hence, compared to the bare CdS nanorods, CdS/SeS2 and CdS/MoS2 nanocomposites, 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite show an efficient current density with low resistance and designating the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Fig. 5(d) illustrates the photocurrent response of bare CdS and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites. The photon-induced charge carriers such as electron and hole and their migration ability towards the surface of bare CdS and 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites were estimated through the transient photocurrent retort with the equal interval of the period. From the diagram, it is self-evident that CdS nanocomposites possess less photocurrent density owing to their poor light-harvesting ability. Whereas 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites consist of large photocurrent density, it could be due to the efficiency of large absorption of the visible portion of electromagnetic radiation [64]. Furthermore, when the artificial source of light is switched off, the photocurrent's intensity is suddenly reduced and indicates that photon-induced electrons are transition towards the electrodes. Hence, all these peculiar characteristics of 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites are the most favorable material towards the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production with more durability and high stability. In general, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate intensely depends on the surface area of the photocatalyst, photogenerated charge carrier recombination, separation, and reduction capacity. To define the role of surface area and pore volume in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate, we performed the specific surface area and pore volumes of pure CdS and optimized 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite using nitrogen adsorption-desorption arcs shown in Fig. S6. The surface area and pore volume of the optimized 6 wt% of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposite is much higher than the pure CdS nanorods [65–67]. This indicates that, as compared to pure CdS nanorods, the optimized sample results in a greater number of reactive sites to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. From the obtained experimental results of CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites, especially for photocatalytic hydrogen production, a possible reaction phenomenon was schematically displayed in Scheme 2 through the lactic acid as a sacrificial agent for hole capture, MoS2, and SeS2 nanocomposites as dual co-catalysts and CdS nanorods as a visible light capture semiconductor. When the simulated sunlight is incident on the CdS nanorods, the valence electrons in the valence band (VB) of CdS excited to the conduction band (CB) and left the holes in the VB. Further, the photons provoked electrons in the CB of CdS system easily migrated towards the MoS2 and SeS2 dual co-catalysts due to their identical band edge potentials [68–70]. Consequently, the recombination rate of charge carriers is reduced and enhances the rate of hydrogen production. Simultaneously, the residual positive charge holes in the VB of CdS nanorods interacted with the active ions of lactic acid and converted them into pyruvic acid. This phenomenon is also highly quenched the recombination rate of charge carriers."
13,Conclusion,Highly efficient and cost-effective photocatalytic CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites were designed for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The designed photocatalytic semiconductor nanostructures are possessing robust sunlight harvesting abilities. The photocatalytic studies indicate that the CdS/MoS2-SeS2 nanocomposites have a better hydrogen evolution rate (168.93 mmol g−1 h−1) through long durability high stability and which is 67 times greater than that of HER of bare CdS nanorods. These investigations suggest many opportunities for the production of dual co-catalysts decorated chalcogenide-based nanostructures for high efficient solar light-driven photocatalysts for various applications.
