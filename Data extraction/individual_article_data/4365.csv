0,Introduction,"Nuclear energy has attracted much worldwide attention for its great potential to solve the world energy crisis owing to the large energy density, which is several million times higher than that of fossil fuels, and low emissions [1]. Uranium is currently the most important nuclear fuel, and its stable supply determines the sustainable development of nuclear energy [2–5]. Most of the uranium is mainly stored in seawater, which is up to 4.5 billion tons, several thousand times the total land reserves [6]. However, the extremely low concentration of uranium in seawater (3 ppb) and coexistence with a large number of other ions are the crucial obstacles for recovering uranium [7–9]. Scientists have developed various adsorbents with functional groups that can efficiently extract uranium from seawater [10–16]. Among them, the amidoxime group has been proved to own relatively high adsorption capacity and selectivity for uranium than other functional groups [17–20]. Therefore, loading the amidoxime group on a material with a high specific surface area will be beneficial for the improvement of physicochemical adsorption of uranium adsorbent. Fiber-shape material is the first option for amidoxime group loading due to its huge specific surface area, low flow resistance, and convenient recycling process [21–25]. The simplest way to prepare an amidoxime fiber is to amidoximate polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based fiber. However, this approach would deteriorate the microcrystalline structure of the fiber, resulting in the swelling and severe decrease of mechanical strength of the fiber. Therefore, researchers conceived various ways to load or graft amidoxime groups on other fibers with good mechanical properties [26–28], such as polypropylene (PP) [29,30], polyethylene (PE) [31–33], polyvinyl chloride(PVC) [34], Nylon [35], etc. However, how to balance the adsorption property and mechanical property of present amidoxime-based chelating fibers is still a critical problem. In our previous work, polyacrylonitrile nanoparticles (PAN NPs) were dispersed in continuous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix by emulsion spinning. The polyamidoxime nanoparticles (PAO NPs)/PVA composite fiber was obtained through amidoximation processing and possessed good metal adsorption properties and mechanical properties [36]. However, due to the large fiber diameter(≥20μm), many PAO NPs were wrapped deeply in the fiber matrix, which substantially slowed down the adsorption kinetics. Therefore, increasing specific surface area and exposing active adsorption sites should significantly improve its adsorption performance. Making the fiber submicron or nano size is an effective way to expose more PAO NPs on the surface of the fiber. There are mainly three methods for nanofiber production, including electrospinning [37], solution blown spinning, and centrifugal spinning [38]. The centrifugal spinning is easy to operate without a high voltage electric field or high-pressure airflow, and special solvents and has low equipment requirements and cost. Additionally, it can spin continuously and efficiently [39–41]. In this work, PAN NPs emulsion was synthesized by emulsion polymerization and mixed with PVA solution to obtain the spinning dope. PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers were prepared by centrifugal spinning, crosslinking, and amidoxime-oximation. The structure and adsorption properties of the obtained PAO NPs/PVA composite chelating nanofibers were characterized and investigated systematically."

Acrylonitrile (AN), methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylic acid (AA), hydrogen peroxide solution (30%), antibad blood acid (LAA), glutaraldehyde (GA), acetone, hydrochloric acid (HCL), hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and anhydrous sodium carbonate were all chemically pure and purchased from Kelong Chemical Reagent Company of Chengdu. All monomers were purified with decompression distillation method. Metal salts for adsorption experiments Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fe(NO3)3· 9H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were all analytically pure and purchased from Kelong Chemical Reagent Company of Chengdu. Deionized (DI) water was used to prepare all the solutions in the study."
3,Preparation of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers,"2.2 Preparation of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers The preparation process of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers was shown in Scheme 1 . Acrylonitrile (15 g), methyl methacrylate (0.53 g), and acrylic acid (0.75 g) were mixed with the emulsifier (0.36 g Tween-20 and 0.09 g sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) and poured into the reactor vessel. Then, the reactor vessel was heated up to 40 °C, and hydroperoxide(H2O2) (0.15 g) and ascorbic acid (LAA) (0.483 g) were added as a redox initiator pair. The reaction was kept at 40 °C and lasted about 4 h to finish the emulsion polymerization. PVA solution (concentration of 16 wt%) was prepared by dissolving PVA 1799(The PVA's structural unit is -CH2-CH(OH)-, which can increase the nanofiber's hydrophilic properties. In addition, PVA has excellent properties of fiberizability, weather and corrosion resistance, UV resistance, wear-resisting, creep resistance, etc.) in deionized water at 95 °C for 5 h. The PVA solution was mixed with PAN emulsion at different ratios (the mass percentage of PAN NPs in the total mass of PAN NPs and PVA are 13 wt%, 18 wt%, 24 wt%, 30 wt%, and 32 wt%) to form spinning dopes. These spinning dopes were centrifugal spun to form PAN NPs/PVA fibers, which were labeled as PAN NPs/PVA-13, PAN NPs/PVA-18, PAN NPs/PVA-24, PAN NPs/PVA-30, and PAN NPs/PVA-32, respectively. The PVA fiber without PAN NPs was also prepared through the same process. The rotation speed is 8000 r/min, nozzle to collector distance is 35 cm, and the nozzle's diameter is 0.3 mm. PAN NPs/PVA nanofibers were crosslinked with acetone and glutaraldehyde (the mass percentage of glutaraldehyde in the total mass of acetone and glutaraldehyde are 8%, 6.5%, 4%, 2.5%, 1%) at room temperature for 5 min. Then the crosslinked nanofibers were rinsed to neutral by deionized water and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. A certain amount of dried nanofiber was immersed in the deionized water for 24 h at room temperature, then washed and dried for calculating the residual mass rate R (according to Eq. (1)), which reflects the water-resistance of the nanofibers. Next, the PAN NPs/Crosslinked PVA nanofibers were amidoximated in the mixed solution of anhydrous sodium carbonate and hydroxylamine hydrochloride for 2 h at 80 °C to obtain PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers. Then the obtained fiber was washed with deionized water to neutral and dried for calculating the density of amidoxime groups (D) in the modified PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers according to Eq. (2). (1) R = W 1 W 0 W 0 and W 1 are the weight of the PAN NPs/Crosslinked PVA fiber before and after immersion and washing by deionized water, respectively. (2) D = W 3 − W 2 33 × W 3 × 1000 W 2 and W 3 are the weight of the fiber before and after amidoximation treatment, respectively."
4,Adsorption experiments,"2.3 Adsorption experiments Isothermal adsorption experiments (26 °C) were carried out under magnetic stirring in 50 mL uranyl ion solutions with different initial uranium concentrations (50, 100, 200, 500, 800 mg/L). After 24 h of adsorption, the concentration of ions in the solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Optima 7000DV). At time t, the fiber adsorption capacity for uranium Q t (mg/g) was calculated using Eq. (3). (3) Q t = C 0 − C t × V m where C 0 and C t (mg/L) are the concentration of uranium ions in the solution before and after the adsorption time t, V(L) is the volume of the adsorption liquid, and m(g) is the weight of the adsorbent. The adsorption isotherm curve was fitted by the Langmuir model and the Freundlich model, which are represented by Eqs. (4–7), respectively. (4) Q e = Q max × K L C e 1 + K L C e (5) Q e = K F × C e 1 / n (6) C e Q e = C e Q max + 1 Q max K L (7) Ln Q e = Ln K F + 1 n Ln C e where Q e (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity of the fiber for uranium at adsorption equilibrium; C e(mg/L) is the uranium concentration in the solution at adsorption equilibrium; Q m is the maximum adsorption capacity calculated according to the Langmuir model; K L (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant; K F [(mg/g) (L/mg)1/n] and 1/n are the Freundlich constants indicating adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. Dried PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers (the mass of adsorbent (mads) =50 ± 5 mg) were immersed into uranium solution (50 mL) with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L. The concentration of uranium solution was measured at regular intervals. The adsorption kinetic curve was fitted by the pseudo-first-order kinetic adsorption model Eq. (8) and the pseudo-second-order kinetic adsorption model Eq. (9). (8) Ln Q e − Q t = Ln Q e − k 1 t (9) t Q t = 1 k 2 Q e 2 + t Q e where k 1(min−1) represents the first-order adsorption kinetic rate constant, and k 2 (g mg−1·min−1) represents the second-order adsorption kinetic rate constant. The selectivity of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers for uranyl ion adsorption was then studied. PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers (50 ± 5 mg) were put into a 50 ml solution containing various metal ions (Cd2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Cu2+ Li+) and stirred magnetically at 26 °C for 24 h. The initial concentration of each metal ion solution is 50 mg/L. The affinity of the fiber to each metal ion was compared through their adsorption capacity."
5,Desorption experiment,2.4 Desorption experiment A mixed solution of 0.1 M H2O2 and 1 M Na2CO3 was used as the eluent. The PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers after uranium adsorption were soaked in the eluent at 60 °C for 30 min. The elution efficiency Ee of the fiber was calculated from Eq. (10). (10) E e = C e ′ × V ′ C 0 − C e × V
6,Results and discussion,
7,Structure of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers,"3.1 Structure of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers The morphology of the PAN NPs and centrifugal spun PAN NPs/PVA nanofibers observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that the PAN NPs are smooth round bean-like nanoparticles with an average diameter of 125 nm, which is measured by Malvern Zetasizer. The pure PVA fiber has a smooth surface and possesses the smallest diameter of 590 nm (calculated based on 50 fibers by Nano measure software). With the increase of PAN NPs, the fiber's surface gets rougher, and the fiber diameter increases because PAN particles increase the PVA solution's viscosity. However, when the contents of PAN NPs surpass 24 wt%, the nano-emulsion particles tend to aggregate and can be observed on the fiber surface, which has an adverse influence on the flow properties of PVA solution, leading to a decrease of the fiber diameter. If the content of PAN NPs exceeds 30%, the related nanofibers cannot be prepared by centrifugal spinning because the aggregation of PAN NPs at a high concentration might block the spinneret orifice. The PAN NPs/PVA-30 nanofibers with the highest cyanide content are crosslinked by glutaraldehyde [42] and amidoximated by hydroxylamine to get PAO NPs/PVA-30 nano chelating fibers. The effect of glutaraldehyde content on the water-resistance of the PAN NPs/Crosslinked PVA nanofibers, the density of amidoxime groups, and the adsorption capacity for uranium of the PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers are shown in Fig. S1. It can be seen that the degree of crosslinking both too high [43] or too low are likely to reduce the adsorption capacity of nanofiber. By a series of experiments, we decided that the nanofibers used in the subsequent tests are all crosslinked by 2.5% GA. It can be seen from Fig. S2 that the surface morphology of the nanofiber changed little except for the increase in diameter after fiber crosslinking. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers were displayed in Fig. S3. The isotherms of fibers showed type III characteristics isotherm with H3 hysteresis loops, which indicated the mesoporous structure of the nanofibers. The BET surface area and average pore width were calculated to be 0.7898 m2/g and 43.973 Å, respectively. The infrared spectra of the fibers at different processing stages are shown in Fig. 2 . The peak of the hydroxyl groups in PVA at 3300 cm−1 is blue-shifted after crosslinking. It should be attributed to partly etherification of hydroxyl groups and the reduction in hydrogen bond density [44–46]. The absorption peak at 1242 cm−1 is the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of C-O-C, suggesting that the hydroxyl groups are successfully aldehydezed by glutaraldehyde. After amidoxime modification (PAO NPs/PVA), the intensity of the cyano absorption peak of PAN at 2242 cm−1 drops significantly, and two new peaks appear at 1655 cm-1, and 950 cm−1 are ascribed to the CN and NO stretching vibration of amidoxime groups in PAO fiber. In the XPS spectra (Fig. 2) of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers, the O1s peaks can be differentiated into three peaks at binding energies (BE) of 532.15 eV, 532.33 eV, and 533.38 eV, which are corresponding to oxygen atoms in CH2CH-OH, C=N-OH, and the C-O-C species, respectively. The C1s peaks at the BEs of 283.07 eV, 284.75 eV, 286.17 eV, and 288.23 eV are assigned to C-C/CH, CN, CN, and CO peaks. The N1s emission peaks at 399.53 eV and 401.35 eV are attributed to CN and CN species. The results further prove that the amidoxime groups are successfully formed on the surface of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers."
8,Adsorption behavior,"3.2 Adsorption behavior As shown in Fig. 3 , the nanofibers after uranium adsorption(U-PAO/PVA) became brownish-red. The U 4f5/2(~392 eV) and U 4f7/2(~381 eV) orbital level splitting peaks of uranium appear in the XPS spectrum of U-PAO/PVA, which indicates that the fibers have adsorbed uranium. Vukovic [47,48] predict an η2 binding interaction by DFT calculations and crystallography for how amidoxime binds uranyl. The EDS characterization further proves that a large amount of uranium is adsorbed on the surface of the fiber uniformly. The adsorption isotherms of uranium onto PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers at various equilibrium concentrations are presented in Fig. 4 . The relevant parameters of the isotherm adsorption model are summarized in Table 1 . The correlation coefficient of the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model is higher than that of the Freundlich model, suggesting that the monolayer chemisorption dominates the adsorption process. The Langmuir equation's Qmax value is 269.54 mg/g, slightly higher than the experimental value. The adsorption kinetics of uranium on the PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers are presented in Fig. 4, and the correlated kinetic parameters are shown in Table 2 . The linear fitting parameter R2 (>0.99) of the pseudo-second-order model is higher than that of the pseudo -first-order. The Qe value calculated by the second-order equation agreed with the experimental data better in case that the Qe value calculated by the first-order equation was less than the experimentally found Qe values [49]. The result suggested that the adsorption of uranyl ions by PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers is mainly chemical adsorption [50,51]. The thermodynamic parameter ∆G 0 calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2) in SUPPORTING INFORMATION was −24.75 KJ/mol, indicating the adsorption process is spontaneous and feasible. According to report [52], the ∆G 0 for physicochemical adsorption was generally in the range of −80 between −20 KJ/mol. Thus, the adsorption mechanism could be considered as the result of both physisorption and chemical sorption at 26 °C. The results of isothermal dynamic adsorption experiments show that 8 mg of the PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers can adsorb 176.6 mg/g uranium from 250 mL uranyl solution with a concentration of 12 ppm at 26 °C in pH = 4.53. The comparison of the adsorption properties of our work and the results in other references are shown in Table S1. The adsorption performance of the PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers prepared in this paper is better than most other reported nanofibers. The protonation and deprotonation of functional groups on the nanofiber surface at different pH values will affect the adsorption behavior of the nanofiber to uranium. In Fig. 5a, the fiber shows a positive potential due to surface amino protonation in an acidic environment and a negative potential due to deprotonation when pH exceeds 4.34. Then the influence of pH at 3–9 on adsorption capacity of the nanofibers is investigated in Fig. 5b. The nanofiber could keep good adsorption properties to uranium when the pH range from 4.5 to 8.5. As shown in Fig. 5c, repeated elution experiments are carried out to analysis the regeneration performance of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers. The eluent's high desorption rate can be attributed to the carbonate ion's strong complexing ability with uranyl ion [53]. To improve the desorption efficiency, we add H2O2 gradually after putting adsorbents into Na2CO3 solution, according to the reference [54]. Besides, it shows that the reusability of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers during five sequential runs maintains a high adsorption capacity and high elution efficiency. The selectivity of adsorbent is an important indicator in judging the adsorption property of a chelating fiber in a real working environment. The adsorptions of different ions on PAO/PVA nanofibers are presented in Fig. 5d. The affinity order of PAO NPs/PVA nanofibers to metal ions is U > Cu > Cd > Fe > Co > Li. The affinity order should be attributed to the factors concluding electronegativity, hydrated radius, hydration energy, ionic radius and hardness [55–57]."
9,Conclusion,"In this study, PAN NPs were synthesized with emulsion polymerization and mixed with PVA solution to prepare a novel amidoxime chelating fiber by centrifugal spinning, crosslinking, and amidoximation. The nanofiber structure obtained by centrifugal spinning exposes a large number of PAN NPs to the fiber's surface so that more adsorption groups can be formed on the fiber's surface to improve the adsorption performance of the fiber. The results prove that the PAO NPs/PVA composite chelating nanofiber shows high uranium adsorption capacity and adsorption rate. This study provides an efficient way to prepare amidoxime nanofibers with excellent adsorption performance for potential seawater uranium abstraction application."
