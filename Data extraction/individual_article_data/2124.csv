0,Introduction,"Energy is a necessity in our daily society and industrial life. In the past few decades, the world energy needs are fulfilled by fossil fuels, such as crude oil, nature gas, and coal. However, with the increase of population and development of technology, fossil fuel cannot satisfy people's need as the primary energy source in the future due to the shortage of energy resources and a series of environment problems. Statistical Review of World Energy 2014 reported that the world primary energy consumption in 2014 is about 3 times increase compared with that in 1965, which indicates that energy demand has been increased sharply [1]. On the other hand, based on the Earth System Research Laboratory data about CO2 concentration in atmosphere collected at Mauna Loa Observatory, the CO2 concentration in atmosphere was continuously increasing from 320ppm to about 400ppm in the years from 1965 to 2014 [2]. As mentioned above, one can see that the CO2 concentration in atmosphere was continuously increasing along with the increase of energy demand. This is due to CO2 is released to atmosphere during the utilization of fossil fuels. It is commonly known that CO2 is one main gas which causes the greenhouse effect together with other gases, such as methane, NOx, and CFC. Nowadays, alternative environment-friendly energies are gaining more and more attention in the worldwide. Recently, many new technologies have been developed to effectively utilize the alternative energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, biomass, hydraulic, geothermal energy, and hydrogen energy [3–10]. Among these new energy sources, hydrogen energy gains more attention due to its advantages. For instances, (i) it has a high specific energy on a mass basis. The energy content of 9.5kg hydrogen is equivalent with that of 25kg of gasoline [11]. (ii) It can be produced by several ways, such as steam reforming of hydrocarbons, dry reforming of methane, gasification of biomass, and electrolysis of water, nuclear, solar and wind [12–15]. (iii) It is easy to be transported as natural gas. (iv) It only contains H atom, therefore, neither toxic nor greenhouse gas is released to the atmosphere when it is combusted. (v) It can be utilized for many purposes, eg., automobile and cell phone fuels, and electricity generation via fuel cell technology [16]. As above mentioned, many technologies are available for the production of hydrogen from conventional (fossil) and alternative energy such as biomass and solar energy. The economic analysis is always accompanying with the science and industrial technology. Methane is the main composition of natural gas. The cost of production of hydrogen from methane is highly sensitive to the cost of natural gas. Based on the Gray and Tomlinson analysis [17], the hydrogen production cost from methane is in the range of 2.55–2.33$/kg, which is flexible with the natural gas price [18]. Coal is another largest energy reserves in the world. A study in the U.S. DOE national energy technology lab indicates that the hydrogen production from coal with a yield of 255,400kg/day has a cost of 1.5$/kg. The cost of hydrogen production from different sources is listed in Table 1 [18]. The results of economic analysis indicate that the most economical source of hydrogen is coal, with an estimated cost of 0.86–1.34$/kg. Hydrogen is a main chemical in our daily life and chemical industry. It has many applications in chemical industries. For example, hydrogen can be used in ammonia synthesis, petrochemical industry, electronic industry, nuclear reactor and power generation system. Recently, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs) has attracted considerable attention due to its high power density, low reaction temperature, low local emissions, quiet operation, fast start-up and shutdown, and in-situ power generation [19]. In PEMFC system, Pt electrode acts as catalyst for adsorption and dissociation hydrogen molecule. However, the Pt electrode is easily poisoned by CO in H2 rich feed gas. CO molecule can be adsorbed on Pt active site strongly which will block the active site, causing the fuel cell voltage and current density to be decreased sharply. When the concentration of CO in H2 feed gas exceeds 10ppm, it irreversibly poisons the Pt-based anode electro-catalyst [20,21]. Traditional process options for hydrogen production choose gaseous, liquid and solid carbohydrate as feedstock. The process of hydrogen production includes steam reforming [22], dry reforming [23], partial oxidation reforming [24], auto-thermal reforming [25], oxidative reforming [26], carbon gasification [27–29], hydrocarbon decomposition [30], and water gas shift reaction [31]. Most of those reaction pathways need catalysts. The gaseous feedstock mainly includes methane; liquid feedstock includes methanol, ethanol, and gasoline; and solid feedstock includes coal, petroleum coke, and solid biomass. Some reactions are summarized in the following (Eqs. (1)–(9)): Steam reforming: (1) CH3OH+H2O→CO2+3H2 (2) CH3CH2OH+3H2O→2CO2+6H2 Dry reforming: (3) CH4+CO2→2CO+2H2 Autothermal reforming: (4) CH3OH+(1−x) H2O+0·5x O2→CO2+(3−x) H2 (5) 3CH4+4H2O+O2→3 CO2+10H2 Oxidative reforming: (6) CH4+1/2 O2→CO2+2H2 Carbon gasification: (7) C+H2O→CO+H2 Hydrocarbon decomposition: (8) CH3OH→CO+2H2 Water gas shift reaction: (9) CO+H2O→CO2+H2 As mentioned above, hydrogen can be produced by traditional catalytic or pyrolysis process. Recently, some new technologies are developed for hydrogen production. It is known that water (H2O) is abundant on the earth, and hydrogen can be produced directly from water by electrolysis process or photo-catalytic splitting process [32–35]. Both technologies have same reaction equation (Eq. (10)): (10) H2O→1/2 O2+H2 Various catalysts have been developed for hydrogen production. Recently, Agrell et al. [36] reported that ZrO2 promoted Cu/ZnO catalyst activity for steam reforming of methanol. They found that Cu/ZrO2/ZnO showed the turnover frequency (TOF) two or three times higher than ZrO2-free catalyst (Cu/ZnO). They also found that compared with Cu/ZnO catalyst, catalysts contained ZrO2 showed highly resistant to redox cycles and exhibited high stability. The XPS and TPR results indicate that high activity of ZrO2-containing catalyst is due to the well-dispersed Cu particles which is promoted by the addition of ZrO2. Flytzani-Stephanopoulos et al. [31] reported that isolated gold atoms on TiO2 catalyst can be synthesized by combination of gold deposition method with UV irradiation method. The isolated gold atom catalysts show excellent catalytic activity for water gas shift reaction. Despite that coke is easily formed on the Ni-based catalysts and results in the deactivation of catalysts in the hydrocarbon reforming process, such catalysts have been extensively studied in the reforming process for the hydrogen production. Especially, Navarro et al. [37] supported Ni as well as Pt on the Ce-La-modified Al2O3 for the oxidative reforming of hexadecane and found that Ni-based catalysts showed higher catalytic activity with higher H2 selectivity even than Pt-based catalysts. Biswas and Kunzru [38] supported Ni on CeO2/ZrO2 for ethanol reforming and found that 30% Ni/Ce0.74Zr0.26O2 showed a high catalytic activity at 600°C. Li and Chen [39–41] reported the sandwich structure catalyst (CoOx/MgO/Ta3N5) for water oxidation under visible light irradiation. They found that the catalyst with sandwich structure (CoOx/MgO/Ta3N5) showed very high water oxidation activity, and oxygen evolution rate of the resulting CoOx/MgO/Ta3N5 photo-catalyst is 23 times than of the pristine Ta3N5 sample. This is the highest achievement (11.3%) for the apparent quantum efficiency under 500–600nm illumination. The construction of p-n junctions with built-in electric field effect between two photocatalytic semiconductors is an efficient strategy to separate photo-generated carriers and enhance the photocatalytic activity. Yu and Zhang [42] reported that inserting a layer of zero-bandgap graphene at the interface between p-type NiO and n-type TiO2 can further enhance the separation of photo-generated carriers by building double-shelled NiO/rGO/TiO2 heterostructured coaxial nano-cables, which is proved to possess a remarkable high photocatalytic activity for water splitting. The characterization indicated that the high photocatalytic activity is due to that zero-bandgap rGO can increase the barrier height by lowering the Fermi level of the NiO nanofiber core and increasing the Fermi level of the TiO2 nanowire shell, and enhance the strength of built-in electron field. BiOI/BiVO4 p-n junction was synthesized by Ye et al. [43]. It is found that the unique structure of this kind of catalyst greatly improved the performance of BiVO4 for photoelectrochemical water splitting due to a synergistic effect. This new BiOI/BiVO4 p–n junction not only facilitates the separation and transfer of photo-generated charges, but also expands the light absorption range, which is the origin for this synergistic effect. The photocurrent density of BiOI/BiVO4 photo-anodes reached 3.27mAcm2 at 1.23V vs. RHE, which is much higher than those of pristine BiVO4 and BiOI (1.23mAcm2 and 0.15mAcm2 at 1.23V vs. RHE, respectively). At 0.68eV vs. RHE, BiOI/BiVO4 showed the maximum of applied bias photo-to-current efficiency of 0.97% at 0.68V vs. RHE. In nanomaterial research field, different nanostructure generally results in different physicochemical properties. The catalytic performance is also closely related to the nanostructure and surface structure [44]. Photoelecrochemical water splitting is a process that can directly convert solar energy into chemical energy and store it in chemical bonds, by producing hydrogen as a clean fuel source [45]. Zhang et al. [46] synthesized Au nanoparticles sensitized ZnO nanorod@nanoplatelet (NR@NP) core-shell arrays via a facile hydrothermal method followed by a further modification using Au nanoparticles. This unique nanostructure exhibited a promising behavior in photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting, giving rise to a largely enhanced photocurrent density, photo conversion efficiency as well as incident-photon-to- current-conversion efficiency (IPCE), much superior to those of pristine ZnO nanorods arrays and ZnO NR@NP. The maximum efficiency for the Au-ZnO NR@NP arrays was 0.69% (at 0.42V vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2), 1.3 times higher than the ZnO NR@NP arrays (0.54% at 0.40 vs. Hg Hg2Cl2) and even 1.5 times higher than the pure ZnO NR arrays (0.45% at 0.34 vs Hg/ Hg2Cl2). Furthermore, incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to evaluate the enhanced PEC water oxidation performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrated that the high performance of Au-ZnO NR@NP was attributed to the coordination of ZnO core-shell hierarchical nanostructure and the surface-plasmon-resonance effect of Au nanoparticles. The authors further indicated that the photo-generated electrons of ZnO transferred to Au, which suppressed the recombination of electron-hole pairs. TiO2 is one of the most widely investigated metal oxides because of its extraordinary surface, electronic and photocatalytic properties. However, the large bond gap of TiO2 and the considerable recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs limit its photocatalytic efficiency [47]. Recently, Liu et al. [48] fabricated a novel multijunction structure, with Si nanowires as the core, ZnIn2S4 nano-sheets as the branche, and TiO2 films as sandwiched layer. This junction exhibited a superior photoelectrochemical performance with a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.51%, which was 795 and 64 times higher than that of a bare Si wafer and nanowires, respectively. The authors indicated that the large enhancement was attributed to the effective electron-hole separation and the fast excited carrier transport within the multijunctions resulting from their favorable energy band alignments with water redox potentials, and to the enlarged contact area for facilitating the electron transfer at the multijunction/electrolyte interface. In recent years, functional materials based on the carbon were created by various groups. These materials with unique building blocks were attractive in many energy-related application fields due to their wide variety in form, versatility in function, abundance, low cost, and wide range of properties. Especially, one dimensional (such as carbon nanofiber) and two dimensional (graphene or graphitic carbon nitride) carbon materials have been considered as the most promising materials in the electro-catalysis filed in the last decades [49–51]. Finally, Wang and Li et al. were inspired by the models from living nature and constructed new functional catalysts systems [52,53]. For instance, photosystem II (PS II) is one of the photosynthetic enzymes responsible for the largest-scale solar-to-chemical energy conversion on earth, captures sunlight to drive water splitting into O2. This process can be operated at the ambient condition with nearly 100% quantum efficiency, and proceeds with a very small overpotential for water oxidation reaction [53]. Since it offers an high efficient light-driven water oxidizing enzyme (PS II), a natural-artificial hybrid system for overall water splitting reaction was designed, in which the PS II and inorganic photocatalysts (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh) were integrated and dispersed in aqueous solution. The authors found that the new natural-artificial hybrid system had high catalytic performance under visible light irradiation [52]. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are defined as inserting carbon atom into transition metal lattices and formation of chemical bonds. The properties of these carbide compounds are different from its parent metal and metal oxide. Based on the property of the bondings between metal and carbon atoms, the carbide compounds can be classified into three groups: salinic compounds, intermediate compounds and interstitial compounds. However, the salinic and intermediate compounds are unstable at relative low temperature as it is easily decomposed by water. The unique properties of interstitial compounds are resulted by the bonding between carbon atom and transition metal atom. To date, the general agreement concerning the bonding between molybdenum and carbon is that the bonding in molybdenum carbide contains third kinds of bondings: metallic bonding (rearrangement of metal-metal bonds); covalent bonding (bonding formation between metal and non-metal (carbon)); and the ionic bonding (charge transfer between metal and non-metal (carbon)) [54,55]. The interstitial carbide not only possesses high melting temperature (>3300K), high hardness (>2000kg/mm2) and high tensile strength (>300GPa), but also includes high electric and thermal conductivity which are similar to ceramics [56]. Due to these excellent properties, interstitial carbides have been extensively applied as various functional materials. Recently, transition metal carbides have attracted considerable attentions because they show catalytic activity similar to those of noble metals in various catalytic reactions such as methane reforming [47–59], water gas shift reaction [60–62], desulfurization [63,64], biomass conversion [65,66], hydrogenation [67,68], CO2 reduction [69,70], hydrocarbon isomerization [71,72] and electronic catalytic reaction [73,74]. Levy and Boudart [75], who are pioneers in the field of transition metal carbide catalysts, reported that tungsten carbide (WC) shows Pt-like catalytic activity in several catalytic reactions, i.e., isomerization of 2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-methylbutane. Subsequent investigation demonstrated that Pt-like property is due to the change in the electron distribution in tungsten by addition of carbon. An important factor in the unique catalytic activity of Pt in the isomerization reactions is its very large electronic negativity. Addition of carbon in transition metal (like tungsten or molybdenum) lattices might affect the electronic negativity of the new catalyst in a desirable direction. Very recently, Mai and Machado [76] used molybdenum carbide as catalyst for biomass product upgrading. They synthesized the molybdenum carbide nanoparticles within carbon nanotube (MoC@Carbon-nanotube) by incipient wetness impregnation method. It is the first time to use molybdenum carbide as catalyst for γ-valerolactone production via levulinic acid hydrogenation. TEM image showed that the molybdenum carbide was easily and uniformly dispersed in carbon nanotube and the particles size was about 3nm. The activity and selectivity of MoC@Carbon-nanotube reached 99% and 90%, respectively, at a reaction condition of 30bar of H2 and 200°C. Compared with Ru/active carbon catalyst, the MoC@Carbon nanotube showed higher turnover frequency (TOF). TOF of MoC@Carbon nanotube and Ru/active carbon are 4.8 and 2.8, respectively, at a reaction temperature of 100°C. Ma and Hao [77] also applied molybdenum carbide as catalyst for biomass product upgrading. They synthesized α-MoC1−x by temperature-program reaction method, and applied it for catalytic ethanolysis of kraft lignin into high-value small molecular chemicals. It is found that complete catalytic ethanolysis of kraft lignin over α-MoC1−x can be achieved in supercritical ethanol and the products included C6 monohydric alcohols, C8-C10 esters, C7-C10 monohydric phenols, C7-C10 benzyl alcohols, and C8-C10 aromatic hydrocarbons. One of the most attractive reactions is the conversion of cellulose into useful organic compounds [78]. Recently, Zhang and Ji [79] first used supported tungsten carbide as catalyst for cellulose conversion into ethylene glycol (EG). Subsequent investigation demonstrated that WC/AC (active carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into ethylene glycol. When a small amount of Ni was doped on the catalyst surface, the yield of ethylene glycol can be significant increased. Especially, the as-prepared tungsten carbide catalyst showed a remarkable catalytic activity than noble metal catalysts, i.e., Pt/Al2O3 and Ru/C. The yield of ethylene glycol reached 61% over 2% Ni-30% W2C/AC under a reaction condition of 245°C and 6MPa H2. Porosoff and Yang [69] firstly investigated CO2 activation over molybdenum carbide surface with traditional temperature-program surface reaction (TPSR) and ambient-pressure X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) experiment to detect the active nature of molybdenum carbide surface towards CO2 conversion to CO. Compared with noble bimetal catalysts (PtCo/CeO2 and PdNi/CeO2), the molybdenum carbide catalyst surface exhibited higher CO2 conversion, TOF and selectivity. They found that the selectivity and stability could be enhanced by supporting Co metal on molybdenum carbide surface. In this article, the latest development on the molybdenum carbide catalyst for hydrogen production is reviewed. Two main parts are included in this review: preparation of molybdenum carbide and application of it in hydrogen production technology. In the first section, various molybdenum carbide preparation methods and the strategies to modify the physicochemical properties of molybdenum carbide are described. It is concluded that solid-solid reaction method could provide high surface area and the synthesis process is relatively easy and safe. Furthermore, the addition of second metal could increase molybdenum carbide surface area and adjust catalyst surface electronic condition. In the second section, the applications of molybdenum carbide based catalyst for various catalytic reactions are described. The catalytic activity, stability, and deactivation and reaction mechanism over molybdenum carbide catalyst are critically reviewed and discussed. It indicates that molybdenum carbide should be an alternative catalyst with high efficiency for hydrogen production. Furthermore, based on the preliminary research survey in this review, we hope the readers can understand the prospects and challenge for application of molybdenum carbide as catalyst for the production of hydrogen from various reactions."
1,Preparation of molybdenum carbide,
2,Properties of transition metal carbide,"2.1 Properties of transition metal carbide The properties of transition metal carbides have been discussed extensively in several articles [80–86]. In this review, transition metal carbide crystal structure, surface properties will be briefly summarized at first. Comparing with salinic and intermediate compounds, interstitial transition metal carbides show more stable properties under relatively low temperature and humid environment. The unique properties of interstitial transition metal carbides are related to their electronic structure and crystal structure. The electron structure of interstitial results in the properties of carbide is different with its matrix metal. The metal lattice of interstitial carbide contains three forms: face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagonal closed packed (hcp) and simple hexagonal (hex) structure. In these structures, carbon atom located in the interstitial sites between metal atoms as shown in Fig. 1 [83,86]. The general agreement concerning the bonding between transition metal and carbon is that the bonding in transition metal carbide contains third kind of bondings: metallic bonding (rearrangement of metal-metal bonds); covalent bonding (bonding formation between metal and non-metal (carbon)); and the ionic bonding (charge transfer between metal and non-metal (carbon)) [54,55]. It is reported that due to the interstitial carbide special crystal structure, carbon is inserted into the metal-metal lattice and the distance of the metal-metal is longer that metal matrix. The increasing distance of metal-metal results in the d-band of molybdenum atom contraction, which could result in the increase of the Mo d-band density of states and even near the Fermi level. On the other hand, the carbon s-p orbits would be hybridized with the d orbits of Mo when molybdenum carbide is formed, and a new d orbit of Mo (rearrangement with carbon s-p orbits) will become widen and cause the energy distribution broader than that of Mo metal matrix [87]. This is very significant for different adsorbates. Due to the unique electronic properties, even though the molybdenum carbide surface is different from its metal matrix, it shows catalytic activity similar to those of noble metals (like Pt) in various reactions [88]. Kitchin and Chen [82] reported that due to the formation of molybdenum carbide, the d-band of molybdenum on the surface after molybdenum combined with carbon is broader than Mo (1 1 0). Based on this result, they found that several new bonding features are shown in molybdenum d-band, and this new d-band of molybdenum is similar to Pt d-band. It is known that, based on the band theory, d-band is very significant for reactant to be adsorbed and activated. Therefore, as mentioned above, the pure molybdenum carbide surface has similar surface electronic properties as Pt metal, indicating that molybdenum carbide can be seen as a potential material for replacing the Pt catalyst."
3,Preparation of molybdenum carbide,"2.2 Preparation of molybdenum carbide 2.2.1 Temperature-programmed reduction method Molybdenum carbide is not available naturally and must be synthesized. Since molybdenum carbide is usually dense (low porosity), the specific surface area is lower than 10m2/g. Here, the surface area highly depends on the synthesis route. Therefore, many groups focus on new synthesis route for obtaining a high surface area. Based on the carbon recourse, the synthesis route can be divided into three categories: solid-gas reaction, solid-liquid reaction, and solid-solid reaction. Generally, molybdenum carbide is synthesized by the solid-gas reaction (Temperature-Programmed Reduction, TPRe) method which employs the reaction between the molybdenum oxide (MoO3 or MoO2) and the mixture gas of hydrogen and carbon-containing gases, such as CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10 and aromatic compounds [89–92]. In the carburization process, carbon-containing gases are the carbon source, while hydrogen is for reduction of deposited carbon. Shi et al. [93,94] used the CH4 as the carbon source for the synthesis of molybdenum carbide under 20% CH4/H2 (150cm3/min) atmosphere. The details of carburization with a successive temperature-program process are as follows: the carburization temperature is raised from room temperature to 300°C at the rate of 5°/min, and then increased to 700°C at a rate of 1°C/min, and subsequently keeps at 700°C for 2h. The obtained carbide is cooled down to room temperature and passivated in 1% O2/Ar gas flow. The synthesis route is shown in Fig. 2. However, there are some shortages for TPRe method. For examples, the products generated from such a reaction are often covered by polymeric carbon resulted from the pyrolysis of excessive carbon-containing gases. This coke can reduce the surface area and block the catalytically active sites. Ma et al. [95] synthesized Ni doped molybdenum carbide by using TPRe method, in which methane served as the carbon resource. As shown in Fig. 3, for the fresh Ni-Mo2C (10) (Fig. 3(c)) and Ni-Mo2C (15) (Fig. 3(d)), carbon layers with thicknesses of 5.8nm and 12.5nm, respectively, were found. The author indicated that the higher loading of Ni promoted the methane dissociation on the molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process. The BET result indicated that Ni-Mo2C exhibited very low specific surface areas (26.7m2/g for Ni-Mo2C (1.6), 29.1m2/g for Ni-Mo2C (2.4), 7.8m2/g for Ni-Mo2C (10), 7.8m2/g for Ni-Mo2C (15)). According to Fig. 3, one can see that the molybdenum carbide is very densification (Fig. 3(b–d)), even the outer layer exhibits pore structure in the Fig. 3(a). On the other hand, in the TPRe process, employing a large amount of flammable gas at high temperature is very dangerous. Therefore, researchers try to develop new methods to synthesize molybdenum carbide under mild condition to obtain high BET surface area. 2.2.2 Solid-solid reaction method Recently, some researchers using carbon-containing solid compounds such as active carbon, carbon nanotube or organics as the carbon source for the synthesis of molybdenum carbide [96–98]. Han et al. [71] reported that nanostructured molybdenum carbide supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Mo2C/CNTs) can be synthesized by using carbothermal hydrogen reduction method. In this process, carbon nanotube acted as the carbon source. Raman spectrum indicated that the specific G-band structure of CNTs promotes the formation of molybdenum carbide at much lower temperature (600°C). TEM and XRD results indicated that the obtained molybdenum carbide is uniformly dispersed on the surface of outside carbon nanotube, and the particles size (calculated with Scherrer equation) is about 8.9nm for 10% Mo2C/CNTs, 10.5nm for 20% Mo2C/CNTs. 10% Mo2C/CNTs catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the conversion of methyl palmitate into hydrocarbons. Compared with noble metal catalyst (5% Pt/CNTs, conversion: 32%, selectivity: 84%), the supported molybdenum carbide catalysts showed higher conversion and selectivity (90% and 91%, respectively.) Kaewpanha et al. [99] reported that molybdenum carbide can be synthesized by doping Mo on biomass char surface. Here, the carbon source was original biomass (Japanese cedar). XRD patterns of the carburized products at different carburization temperatures when using cedar char as carbon source are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that at a low temperature, i.e., 600°C, only molybdenum oxide (MoO2) phase was observed. As the carburization temperature was increased to 700°C, it is found that the signal of MoO2 phase decreased and the signal of carbide began to appear. When the carburization temperature was increased to 800°C, the XRD pattern showed the peaks of pure Mo2C, indicating that Mo2C was successfully prepared by solid state reaction of dried cedar and molybdenum precursor. According to the XRD results, the authors assumed that the synthesis mechanism should be like that shown in Fig. 5. Here, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O should be decomposed to MoO3 (Mo6+) at first, and then continuously reduced to MoO2 (Mo4+). Thereafter, Mo4+ is further reduced to metallic molybdenum and then transformed into molybdenum carbide at high carburization temperature. They found that if dried biomass was used instead of pure carbon materials as the carbon source, the molybdenum carbide formation can be promoted and the carburization temperature can be reduced. This is because the produced gas such as CO and H2 from the biomass pyrolysis can provide reduction atmosphere to reduce the molybdenum oxide, leading to the formation of molybdenum carbide more easily. The SEM and EDS mapping photographs of Mo2C/cedar char sample are shown in Fig. 6, which indicates the existence of molybdenum carbide with good dispersion on the surface of the as-prepared sample. Gao and Tang et al. [100,101] prepared molybdenum carbide by using aniline as carbon resource. The obtained molybdenum carbide morphology exhibited wire-like morphology, which is composed of nano-particles (2–5nm) with microporous structure. BET analysis indicated that surface area reached 51.3m2/g. Ma et al. [102] also synthesized wire-like molybdenum carbide by direct carburization of aniline-intercalated molybdenum based organic-inorganic hybrid composite, and applied for steam reforming of methanol (SRM). Fig. 7 illustrates the carburization process. The characterizations revealed that the obtained wire-like carbide also contained nano-particles with microporous structure, as shown in Fig. 8. Compared with conventional molybdenum carbide synthesized by TPRe, these nanostructured molybdenum carbides show higher low-temperature SRM activity and high-temperature stability. 2.2.3 Solid-liquid reaction method Liquid carbon source can also be employed for the synthesis of molybdenum carbide. Giordano and Antonietti et al. [103,104] firstly prepared molybdenum carbide by using urea as carbon-source. MoCl5 was reacted with liquid alcohol and an appropriate amount of urea was added to form a polymer-like glassy phase which can be considered as the starting product for further conversion. This method is called “urea glass” route or “solution” route. The synthesis process is shown in Fig. 9. Due to their unique structure, the characterization indicated that the molybdenum carbide possesses a particle size of about 15–30nm, and the BET surface area is about 22m2/g. When the molar ratio of Mo/urea was adjusted, the final product phase was changed from the molybdenum nitride (Mo2N), to mixture phase (Mo2N and Mo2C) and finally to pure Mo2C. The TEM image of MoC synthesized by “urea galss” method is shown in Fig. 10. The experimental details of final products are shown in Table 2. Li and Gu et al. [105] reported that molybdenum carbide can be synthesized via a sodium co-reduction of molybdenum pentachloride (MoCl5) and carbon tetrabromide (CBr4) in benzene at 350°C for 12h. This reaction can be expressed as follow: (11) 2 MoCl 5 + CBr 4 +14 Na → Benzene Mo 2 C+10 NaCl+4NaBr Here, the product is mainly β-Mo2C with small amount of α-MoC1−x, and TEM image indicated that the particle size is about 30nm. 2.2.4 Other methods Besides those methods mentioned above, sonochemical method [106], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [107], microwave-assisted method [108] and plasma method [109–111] have also been applied for the synthesis of molybdenum carbide. Zhao et al. [112] synthesized molybdenum carbide by TPRe of MoO3 precursor using CH4 as the carbon source, followed by treating it with 5M NaOH at 90°C for 2–12h, and found that the surface area was increased 50%. 2.2.5 Discussion on the different methods The particle size, morphology, crystal structure and specific surface area of molybdenum carbide are affected by the carbon source and synthesis process. Generally, high catalytic performance is along with small particle size, high surface area and specific crystal structure. Ma et al. [102] reported that compared with β-Mo2C, α-MoC1−x exhibited higher low-temperature steam reforming of methanol reaction catalytic activity and high-temperature stability. A summary of the physicochemical properties of molybdenum carbides with different carbon sources and synthesis processes are listed in Table 3. It can be found that the second metal doping can promote the surface area of molybdenum carbide and also influence final product crystal structure. Ma and Jung [95,113] reported that the surface area of molybdenum carbide increased to some extent when the second transition metal was doped. It is possible that the reduction of MoO3 could be realized in the presence of the second metal at lower temperature since the second transition metal can catalyze the carbon source (e.g. methane) dissociation and/or reaction with oxygen atom. Thus, lower reduction temperature could limit the mobility of atoms and lead to smaller particle size formation and higher surface area. Ma et al. [114,115] reported that the loading amount of the second metal also affects the surface area and final product crystal structure of molybdenum carbide. Based on Table 3, one can see that the carbon source can also change the final carburization temperature. For example, compared with methane, butane can decrease the carburization temperature since methane molecular is more stable than butane molecular. Also, the carbon source also influences the surface area and crystal structure of final product. For example, compared with methane as the carbon source, the surface area increases from 10 to 76m2/g when butane is involved in the carburization process. From Table 3, it also can be found that the final molybdenum carbide product crystal phase is depended on the carbon source (i.e. methane as the carbon source will generate β-Mo2C while toluene and butane as the carbon source will generate α-MoC1−x). Jung et al. [113] investigated the effect of various transition metals on the solid-state transformation of MoO3 to molybdenum carbide in the CH4/H2, and found that the loading of Co and Cu resulted in the formation of β-Mo2C while the doping of Pt or Pd produced α-MoC1−x phase. It is proposed that the loading of Pt or Pd to MoO3 could reduce the initial reduction temperature and the solid-transformation process become a topotatic transformation through a MoOxCy intermediate phase, leading to the formation of α-MoC1−x. Based on this consequence, it can be assumed that the initial reduction temperature could be reduced by using of toluene and butane as the carbon sources since toluene and butane molecules are more easily activated than the methane molecule. From Table 3, it is also found that the solid support could affect the final molybdenum carbide phase, as shown in Table 3, active carbon results in α-MoC1−x phase while other supports produce β-Mo2C phase. This might be due to the high dispersion of MoO3 on the active carbon surface with nano sizes. As mentioned above, the initial reduction temperature plays an important role in the formation of α-MoC1−x. As we known, small particle size could be reduced at lower reduction temperature. Therefore, it is assumed that MoO3 (supported on active carbon) could be reduced at lower initial reduction temperature and the solid-transformation process becomes a topotatic transformation through a MoOxCy intermediate phase, leading to the formation of the α-MoC1−x. As shown in Table 3, the preparation method can influence the particle size of molybdenum carbide. Generally, molybdenum carbide shows larger particle size when TPRe route is applied [95,115]. The particle size can be reduced to some extent when it is confined in a small space, such as in carbon nanotube. Compared with TPRe method, when carbon nanotube is used as the carbon source, the particle size becomes nanoscale size (10nm). If the molybdenum carbide is synthesized inside the carbon nanotube, the particle size will be less than 3nm since the motivation of molybdenum particle is limited by the carbon nanotube wall [76]. Fig. 11 shows the TEM image in this case."
4,Catalytic properties of molybdenum cabide,"2.3 Catalytic properties of molybdenum cabide As mentioned above, molybdenum carbide exhibits unique physical and chemical properties, which combine the chatacteristic properties of three different classes of materials: covalent solid, ionic crystal, and transition metal. For example, extreme hardness and brittleness of molybdenum carbide are simlar as covalent solids; high melting temperature property is similar as ionic crstals; and they have electronic and magnetic properties similar as transition metals [86]. Due to these unique properties, molybdenum carbide exhibits as the potential candidate for various applications in material science. In recent years, more and more attention is focused on the other application of molybdenum carbide in heterogeneous catalysis. Most of studied on carbide catalysts are inspired by the pioneering work of Levy and Boudart [75], who suggested that all of the group VIII metals plus Cu and Au, only Pt, Ir and Au have the ability to catalyze the isomerization of 2,2-dimethypropane to 2-methylbutane. WC, on the other hand, shows the similar activity as Pt. Generally, the high catalytic activity is due to the change in the electron distribution in transition metals (such as Mo and W) by addition of carbon in the transition metal lattice. The high catalytic activity is also found in other reactions. Wu et al. [88] prepared the composites of MoC embedded in order nanomesoporous carbon materials as the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. The characterization indicated that MoC exhibited a more nagetive potential than those of the Pt electrodes. On the other hand, the photocurrent-voltage expriment indicated that the MoC based electrode yielded energy conversion efficiency of 8.34%, which is higher than the noble metal Pt (7.98%). Their results indicated that molybdenum carbide can be served as the alternative to the expensive Pt counter electrode. Chen et al. [116] reported that Al2O3 supported MoC has been applied to hydrazien decomposition reaction. The experiment results showed that Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic preformance for hydrazine decompositon. And the catalytic performance had comparable activities as that of noble metal Ir. Ji et al. [117] investigated the supported molybdenum carbide catalysts for the catalytic conversion of cellulose toward polyols, especially EG (ethylene glycol). Their results indicated that Pt/AC (active carbon) exhibited a moderate conversion of cellulose (66%). In constract, the AC supported molybdenum carbide catalyst led to a higher conversion of cellulose (85%). These results also indicated that MoC is a alternative catalyst for the expensive Pt noble metal catalysts. The second of advantages of molybdeum carbide as the catalyst is its high selectivity. Due to the electron redistribution after carbon inserted into the molybdenum bulk, molybdenum carbide often shows unique catalytic pathways, producing desirable product selectivities. For example, Han et al. [118] reported that the active carbon supported nano-sized molybdenum carbide (Mo2C/AC) can efficiently catalyze the conversion of renewable oils into diesel-like hydrocarbon mixture. When stearic acid was used as the substrate, the selectivity of olefins over Mo2C/AC (85.8%) catalyst was even higher than that of Pd nano particle catalyst (77.4%). On the other hand, when the methyl palmitate was used as the substrate, Pd catalyst exhibited high selectivity for decarbonylation products while molybdenum carbide toward to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) paraffins. H2-TPD results indicated that hydrogen molecule could be activated on the molybdenum carbide surface at the reaction temperature of 280°C, which is similar with Pd nanoparticles. The similar hydrogen activation behavior between MoC and Pd confirmed that molybdenum carbide exhibits hydrogenation activity as Pt-group noble metals in hydrogen-involved reactions. Qin et al. [119] also investigated molybdenum carbide as catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils, and found that Mo2C/CNF (carbon nanofiber) catalyst showed high selectivity and activity, and the catalytic performance had no any apparent loss after recycled 5 times. Furthermore, another potential catalytic advangate of molybdenm carbide is that it often shows higher sulfur and nitrogen tolerence than the noble metals [67,68,84,120–123]. The advantages and disadvantages of molybdenum carbide catalysts are summarized in Table 4."
5,Molybdenum carbide as catalyst for H2 production,"As mentioned above, as the surface electronic properties of molybdenum carbide are similar to Pt metal, molybdenum carbide is being attracted much attention as alternative noble metal catalyst. This part summarized the recent research progress on using molybdenum carbide as the catalyst for hydrogen production. Four main reactions are considered: (i) dry reforming of methane; (ii) steam reforming of methanol reaction; (iii) water gas shift reaction; (iv) hydrogen evolution from water electrolysis and other catalytic reactions."
6,Dry reforming of methane,"3.1 Dry reforming of methane Dry reforming of methane (DRM, CO2+CH4→2CO+2H2, ΔH°298=+247kJ/mol) is an effective way to utilize CO2 via a reaction with CH4 to produce CO and H2 (“synthesis gas (syngas)”). For industrial applications, syngas with a low H2/CO ratio as produced by this reaction is more suitable for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Various catalysts such as Pt [124], Ru [125], Rh [126] and Ni [127–129] have been studied for this reaction. Among those catalysts, considering the cost, Ni-based catalysts are regarded as the most promising industrial catalyst. However, Ni-based catalysts could be deactivated by coke formation [127,130]. To develop effective catalysts with low cost, many efforts have been done by scientists. One is utilization of molybdenum carbide as a catalyst for DRM reaction [12,93,131,132]. Darujati et al. [133] reported that β-Mo2C has catalytic activity for DMR reaction but it always deactivates rapidly due to the oxidation by CO2 at atmospheric pressure [133]. To improve its stability, the second metal doping is considered. Shi et al. [12] prepared Ni modified molybdenum carbide catalysts with different Ni/Mo molar ratios (1/3, 1/2 and 1/1, denoted as Ni-Mo2C (1/3), Ni-Mo2C (1/2) and Ni-Mo2C (1/1), respectively) for DMR reaction. They found that the catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide was greatly enhanced by the loading of Ni metal. The characterization indicated that Ni can promote methane molecule dissociation which is considered as the determine rate. The stability results indicated that both catalyst activity and stability are dependent on Ni/Mo molar ratio, and the highest activity and stability was obtained on the Ni-Mo2C (1/2) sample, above 80% of CH4 and CO2 conversion were maintained at 800°C during a reaction time of 20h as W/F=0.3gscm−3. In contrast, deactivation of performance was observed over Ni-Mo2C (1/3) and Ni-Mo2C (1/1). XRD and CO2-TPO results of the spent catalysts revealed that the deactivation of Ni-Mo2C (1/1) is due to the coke formation on the surface active sites while that of Ni-Mo2C (1/3) is the bulk oxidation. Here, for Ni-Mo2C (1/2), the methane dissociation rate and CO2 activation rate could match a balance, and a catalytic oxidation-re-carburization cycle as shown in Fig. 12 could be established. As a result, the deactivation due to carbon deposition and/or molybdenum carbide oxidation is avoided. Zhang et al. [93,134] synthesized Ni-Mo2C catalyst through the in-situ carburization of NiMoOx in CH4-CO2 feed of dry methane reforming, in which the role of Ni is considered to facilitate CH4 dissociation to generate active carbon and hydrogen species for the carburization of NiMoOx while CO2 is for hindering of redundant carbon species which generated by CH4 dissociation. A series of reactions for this process are proposed as follows: (12) CH4+3NiO→3Ni+CO+2H2O (13) CH 4 → Ni C + 4H (14) 2C+3MoO3→3MoO2+CO+CO2 (15) 2H+MoO3→MoO2+H2O (16) 3C+2MoO2→Mo2C+2CO+CO2 The authors further studied the effect of oxide precursor on the catalytic behaviors of Ni-Mo2C catalysts for dry methane reforming. The oxide precursor (NiMoOx) was synthesized by two different processes: one is by co-precipitation (CP) and the other is mechanical mixing (MM). Then, the carbides were prepared from these two kinds of oxide precursors through TPRe method. The final products were named as Ni-Mo2C (CP) and Ni-Mo2C (MM), respectively. Characterization indicated that different preparation methods led to different chemical compositions and reduction properties. They found that NiMoOx species existed in the NiMoOx (CP) sample, but NiO and MoO3 species were contained in NiMoOx (MM) sample. The activity performance tests for DMR indicated that there was around 15% drop of CH4 and CO2 conversion over Ni-Mo2C(CP) in the first four hours, and thereafter, the catalyst exhibited excellent stability over the remained test period, showing average CH4 and CO2 conversions of about 55% and 69%, respectively. In contrast, there was gradual decline of CH4 and CO2 conversion over Ni-Mo2C(MM), with a dropping from 76% to 20% in 20h. This is possible that Ni particles in NiMoOx are more difficult to be sintered during high-temperature carburization than in NiO. Nagai et al. [135] also found that NiMoOxCy is more active for H2 formation than Mo2C. Cheng et al. [136] used Co to modify molybdenum carbide by using TPRe method for DMR reaction. They found that Co-Mo carbide species can be formed in the relative lower Co loading sample, i.e. Co0.4Mo1Cx catalyst. On the contrary, at higher molar ratio, i.e. Co/Mo above 0.4, some cobalt atoms are separated from the Co-Mo carbide phase and exist in the form of metallic Co. The catalytic performance results indicated that the bimetallic Co0.4Mo1Cx catalyst has superior activity and stability. The conversion of CH4 reached 90% in 120min without any observed deactivation. However, when the Co/Mo molar ratio was increased to 0.5, i.e. Co0.5Mo1Cx, the activity and stability decreased significantly, and the conversion decreased from 85% to 70% in 120min reaction. The characterization results indicated that the high activity and stability were generated by Co-Mo-C phase which promoted the catalytic activity. XRD and XPS results showed that as the atomic ratio of Co to Mo was increased 0–0.4), the Co-Mo-C percentage in carbide was also increased. However, for the Co0.5Mo1Cx (i.e. Co/Mo=0.5, the promoting effect decreased. This is because higher Co/Mo atomic ratios facilitated the separation of Co from the Co-Mo carbide phase, giving a much shorter catalyst lifetime. In addition, according to the BET surface area measurement, cobalt content has an effect on the specific surface area of the carbide catalyst. The specific surface area was markedly increased when the Co/Mo atomic ratio was increased from 0.1 to 0.4 (0.1: 28.5m2/g; 0.2: 33.1m2/g; 0.3: 34.8m2/g; 0.4: 36.2m2/g). However, for Co0.5Mo1C samples, the BET surface area decreased (0.3). This also might be due to the phase separation, and more cobalt present in the metallic form, which have a small contribution to the specific surface area. Recently, many researchers focus on preparing supported molybdenum carbide catalysts for dry methane reforming [137,138]. Huang et al. [138] prepared Ni/Mo2C/SBA-15 catalyst for DMR reaction. Comparing with unsupported Mo2C, the Ni/Mo2C/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited better catalytic and anti-coking performance due to the smaller metal and carbide particles, higher dispersion, and better ordered pore distribution. For the unsupported Mo2C, the initial methane conversion was 99.5%, but it decreased sharply to 78.2% after 1.5h reaction due to the oxidation of molybdenum carbide. In contrast, for the Ni/Mo2C/SBA-15 catalyst, the catalyst activity was greatly enhanced by loading of molybdenum carbide on SBA-15. The initial conversion of CH4 and CO2 were both above 90% and maintained at this level for 140h and 168h, respectively under a reaction temperature of 800°C with GHSV=8000ml3 h −1g−1. The catalytic activity performance of various supported molybdenum carbide catalysts for DMR reaction are listed in Table 5. In Table 5, one can see that the choice of the support for the molybdenum carbide is crucial to catalyst stability. It should be noted that the relative stability of the supported molybdenum carbide catalyst is in an order of Mo2C/Al2O3 > Mo2C/ZrO2 > Mo2C/SiO2 > Mo2C/TiO2. Here, Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst shows an excellent long-term stability, this is important for its industrial application. For Mo2C/ZrO2, Mo2C loading amount seems to have no significant effect on methane and CO2 conversions. The authors suggested that the difference in the stability may be due to the interaction between MoO3 and support at the precursor stage. With the increase in the interaction between MoO3 and support, the dispersion degree can be increased. For the high dispersion sample, three possible consequences could be assumed: (i) reaction may occur between the oxide and the support to give a composite phase at the interface (e.g. Al2(MoO4)3) which could be more difficult to convert to the carbide under the carburization process; (ii) the formed molybdenum carbide may be very thin and as such, if deactivation occurs there is no further bulk carbon moved to the surface and thereby makes the catalyst stable; (iii) the surface MoO3 may interact with the support so that the transition from MoO3 to Mo2C renders more difficult, or alternatively the oxidation of Mo2C to MoOx becomes more facile [137]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the high stability of Mo2C/Al2O3 is due to the lower interaction between molybdenum oxide and alumina support and the low molybdenum oxide dispersion. Du et al. [139] found that Co modified molybdenum carbide supported on ZrO2 has high resistance to the oxidation of molybdenum carbide. As shown in Table 5, the increase of Co loading amount leads to the improvement of the stability of H2 yield. In addition, it is found that 15% Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 shows higher initial catalytic activity than 15% Mo2C/α-Al2O3. This might be due to the higher surface area of γ-Al2O3, which could let molybdenum carbide well dispersed on it. Anna et al. [133] investigated the effect of promoter addition on the catalytic activity of supported molybdenum carbide catalyst for DMR reaction. They synthesized K, Zr and Ce promoted molybdenum carbide by using impregnation method. The results indicated that K addition lowered the surface area of catalyst, causing low activity and rapid deactivation. Similarly, Zr addition also had little effect on either methane conversion or deactivation rates. On the other hand, for Ce promoter, the impregnation order was found to have obvious effect on the final activity. When Ce was impregnated and calcined before Mo impregnation, a marked improvement in stability and only a small decrease in methane conversion were observed. This is due to the redox properties of the Ce promoter (Ce2O3+CO2→2CeO2+CO), which helps to prevent the oxidation of Mo2C by CO2. David et al. [59] reported that the measured activation energy for DMR reaction over Mo2C at the reaction temperature of 800–900°C was approximately 172kJ/mol which is higher than that for supported Ni or noble metals. This high activation energy value might have relationship with DMR reaction pathway which is combined with carbidic carbon exchange and chemisorbed CO2. The surface reactions should be like below: (17) Mo [] Mo+CH4↔Mo [C] Mo+2H2 (18) Mo [] Mo+CO2↔Mo [O] Mo+CO (19) Mo [C] Mo + CO2↔Mo [C] Mo••••OCO (20) Mo [C] Mo••••OCO↔Mo [] Mo+2CO"
7,Steam reforming of methanol,"3.2 Steam reforming of methanol Considering the cost and safety of hydrogen, in-situ hydrogen generation by reforming of liquid hydrogen carriers should be more potential for future commercialization. Steam reforming of methanol (SRM) is considered as one of the most favorable chemical processes for hydrogen production because: (i) methanol is liquid at ambient condition; (ii) methanol has high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio; (iii) activation of methanol can take place at low temperatures (200–400°C); (iv) methanol is sulfur free and has no C-C bond so that carbon deposition on the catalyst surface can be hindered [3,140,141]. Various catalysts have been developed for the SRM reaction [3,142–144]. Copper-based catalysts, in particular Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, are the typical ones. However, Cu-based catalysts also have several limitations, for example, they have poor thermal stability at a temperature above 300°C due to the sintering of copper [145–147]. As a potential alternative catalyst, recently, molybdenum carbide has been extensively studied for SRM reaction. Széchenyi and Solymosi [148] prepared Mo2C by the carburization of MoO3 with a C2H6/H2 mixture for the methanol decomposition reaction and SRM reaction. The activity performance results indicated that methanol conversion rate can reach 100% at a reaction temperature of 350°C with a high yield of H2 production. Meanwhile, the catalyst showed high thermal stability in the reaction temperature ranged from 200 to 500°C and the methanol conversion rate remained constant for 8h at a reaction temperature of 500°C. Ma et al. [102] prepared nanowire molybdenum carbide (as shown in Fig. 8) for SRM reaction at temperatures in the range of 200–400°C. Compared with Mo2C synthesized by TPRe method, the nanowire molybdenum carbide had higher surface area (93.2m2/g), and showed higher catalytic activity and stability for SRM reaction. For wire-like-MoxCy (675°C), the methanol conversion reached 30% at a reaction temperature of 200°C; the total conversion rate of 100% was reached when the reaction temperature was increased to 350°C; and the methanol conversion rate remained at about 95% in 12h at a reaction temperature of 400°C (as shown in Fig. 13). Recently, a number of researchers focus on preparing metal modified molybdenum carbide catalysts for SRM reaction. Ma et al. [114] prepared iron group metals (Fe, Co, Ni) modified molybdenum carbide catalysts by using TPRe method with a 20% CH4-H2 mixture at 700°C for SRM reaction in the reaction range of 200–400°C. The results indicated that pure β-Mo2C and Co and Fe modified molybdenum carbide catalysts had poor activity and stability. It is found that the deactivation was mainly resulted from the surface oxidation. However, doping of Ni on the molybdenum carbide with a Ni/Mo molar ratio of 1.6/98.4 (Ni-Mo2C (1.6)) enhanced the activity and stability greatly. As shown in Fig. 14, the methanol conversion only slightly decreased from 100% to 80% in 10 h at a reaction temperature of 400°C. The catalytic performance results indicate that the catalytic stability was enhanced by doping Ni on the molybdenum carbide. In this case, Ni doping could create an active site which avoid the deactivation of molybdenum carbide. However, there was still slight deactivation over all reaction time, this might be due to that i) coke formation; as we known, Ni is the most active catalyst for C1 compounds, and coke will be formed when decomposition of methanol molecule occurs on it; ii) Ni particles sintering; Ni particles could be sintered at the high reaction temperature (i.e. 400°C). Moreover, the characterizations indicated that the doping of Ni can effectively promote methanol dissociation, and as shown in Fig. 15, an oxidation-reduction cycle can be established on the surface of Ni-MoC catalyst. Generally, oxidation is the main deactivation reason for carbide catalysts. The oxygen species provided for the oxidation of Mo2C is mainly originated from the dissociation of H2O. As shown in Fig. 15(A) and (B), the rate of water adsorption and activation over the surface of β-Mo2C catalyst is fast (water serves oxide reactant here) because the surface is in a reduced state. Compared with water, methanol shows relatively reduced property. As such, the dissociation rate of methanol should be slower than that water dissociation on the surface of molybdenum carbide. With the reaction time-on-stream, the oxygen species dissociated from water molecule increases so that the surface could be covered by it, as illustrated in Fig. 15(B). Finally, the surface of molybdenum carbide will be oxidized to molybdenum oxide by the adsorbed oxygen species; and in this case, the oxygen species on the surface could also hinder the reactant adsorption. Herein, the surface situations of Fe-Mo2C (1.6) and Co-Mo2C (1.6) should be similar as that of β-Mo2C. In contrast, when Ni is loaded on the surface of molybdenum carbide, it could accelerate the rates of methanol activation and dissociation, and as a result, more reduced species i.e. CO* could be produced, which will reduce the oxygen species generated by water on the surface, as shown in Fig. 15(c) and (d). In conclusion, the deactivation of β-Mo2C catalyst during SRM reaction is due to that the reaction rate of water activation is faster than methanol dissociation. In such a situation, the oxidized Mo species cannot be reduced by methanol. When Ni is loaded on the surface of molybdenum carbide, both reaction rates can be matched to a balance. Therefore, the oxidation-reduction cycle could be established over Ni-Mo2C catalyst as illustrated in Fig. 16. Ma et al. [95] further investigated the effect of Ni loading amount on the catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide for SRM reaction. They found that the loading amount of Ni had a great effect on the catalyst activity and stability, and a relatively lower loading amount led to higher activity and stability. When Ni molar ratio was over 5, the catalyst activity decreased sharply. Characterization results indicated that the low activity of high metal loading amount sample (e.g., Ni-Mo2C (25)) is mainly resulted from Ni metal sintering and coke formation during the carburization process. Deposited carbon will hinder the reactant adsorbed on the surface active sites for SRM reaction. In contrast, Ni modified molybdenum carbide with a Ni/Mo molar ratio of 2.4/97.6 (Ni-Mo2C (2.4)) showed much better stability performance and the methanol conversion over it remained over 89% in 50h test at 300°C. The authors also investigated the effect of S/C (steam/methanol) molar ratio on the SRM reaction and found that the S/C ratio had almost no influence on the methanol conversion. However, with the increase in the water amount in the feed gas, the CO content in the outlet gas decreased while the CO2 content increased since the water gas shift reaction was enhanced with the increase in water content in the feed gas. Ma et al. [115] also prepared Cu modified molybdenum carbide catalysts by using in-situ carburization of Cu doped molybdenum oxide (Cu-MoO3) with a 20% CH4-H2 mixture at 700°C for SRM reaction at temperatures ranged from 200 to 400°C. It is found that Cu doping amount also had great effect on the catalytic activity. Cu-MoxCy catalyst with a Cu/Mo molar ratio of 10/90 (Cu-MoxCy (10)) was found to have the highest catalytic activity and the methanol conversion reached 60% at a temperature of as low as 200°C, and the complete methanol conversion was achieved at 300°C. However, when the Cu/Mo molar ration was over 10/90, the catalytic activity deceased with the increase in the Cu loading amount, for Cu-MoxCy (25), very low catalytic performance was shown as the un-doped molybdenum carbide. TEM image indicated that the low activity of Cu-MoxCy (25) is mainly due to the coke formation on the molybdenum carbide surface during the catalyst preparation stage. As shown in Fig. 17, no carbon deposition can be seen on the TEM images of Cu-MoxCy (1.6) and Cu-MoxCy (10); but for Cu-MoxCy (25), the thickness of carbon layer reached approximately 11.3nm on the catalyst surface. The product composition results presented that H2 and CO2 were two main compositions in the outlet gas, together with a small amount of CO and CH4. Comparing with β-Mo2C catalyst, lower CO and CH4 concentrations were obtained. Here, Cu-MoxCy (10) catalyst showed a long-term stability at a reaction temperature of 300°C and the methanol conversion decreased slowly from 100% to 90% in 50h. Especially the compositions of the outlet gas were very stable in 50h, the H2 concentration in the product stream remained at 68%, indicating that Cu modified molybdenum carbide catalyst should be suitable for in-situ production of hydrogen from SRM reaction. The Mo 3d in XPS spectrum and Cu LMM spectrum indicated the coexistence of CuI and CuII species on the surface of the Cu-MoxCy catalyst. Here, it is considered that the existent of CuI species will result in high activity for methanol activation and high stability of the catalyst, and it might be produced from the strong interaction between Cu and MoxCy support. The authors inferred that the real active site should be located on the interface between Cu and carbide as shown in Fig. 18. Ma et al. [114] further prepared noble metal (Pt) modified molybdenum carbide for SRM reaction. It is found that comparing with Ni and Cu modified molybdenum carbide catalyst, Pt doped molybdenum carbide showed the highest low-temperature catalytic activity and product selectivity. Methanol conversion reached 100% even at a temperature as low as 200°C with a long-term stability. Fig. 19 summarizes the catalytic performance of β-Mo2C and Ni, Cu, Pt modified sample. One can see that compared with other metals (Ni and Cu) modified samples, Pt modified molybdenum carbide had an excellent SRM catalytic activity. Especially, the catalytic activity of Pt-MoxCy (0.8) has almost the same catalytic activity as that of Pt-MoxCy (1.6), indicating that the amount of Pt used for modifying molybdenum carbide could be reduced for a practical application. In the later discussion, we can know the high catalytic activity of Pt-MoxCy should be attributed to its special morphology and embedded nanostructure. Supported molybdenum carbide was also investigated in SRM reaction. Sean et al. [152] prepared two kinds of supported molybdenum carbide: Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 and Mo2C/ZrO2 for this reaction and found that compared with unsupported molybdenum carbide, the catalytic activity was enhanced by supporting it on the γ-Al2O3 or ZrO2 surface. Mo2C/ZrO2 showed a higher hydrogen yield than Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The DRIFTS results indicated that ZrO2 has the ability to retain the methoxy (–OCH3) groups on its surface while γ-Al2O3 has the ability to restore the hydroxyl (–OH) groups on its surface. Vigue and Bianchi [153,154] supposed the following two reactions to explain the bound of –OCH3 and –OH on the surface: (21) M-OCH3+M-OH→CH4+M-O-M Image 1 . Since ZrO2 has the ability to retain the methoxy, the surface reaction on Mo2C/ZrO2 should follow the reaction (22), while the surface reaction on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst should follow the reaction (21). Thus, methoxy on the Mo2C/ZrO2 surface is a key factor leading to a molybdenum carbide/zirconia support interaction which suppresses methanation (reaction 21). Mo2C/ZrO2 catalyst also showed long-term stability in the SRM reaction under the reaction condition of a steam-to-carbon ratio of 1 and 400°C. The methanol conversion of the Mo2C/ZrO2 catalyst remained at about 95% over 10h. Barthos and Solymosi [155] loaded molybdenum carbide on the active carbon (Norit) for SRM reaction. The activity test indicated that the loading amount had great effect on the catalytic performance. Especially, 10% Mo2C/Norit exhibited the best SRM activity and high stability in SRM reaction. Koós et al. [156] studied the effect of promoter K on the molybdenum carbide catalytic activity in SRM reaction. They reported that K hindered the complete carburization of MoO3 to the formation of molybdenum carbide. However, the K addition can increase the adsorption of methanol on the molybdenum carbide surface and enhanced the production of hydrogen. The K-promoted molybdenum carbide catalyst also showed high thermal stability and had no deactivation in the SRM reaction environment in 47h."
8,Water gas shift reaction,"3.3 Water gas shift reaction CO generated from the steam reforming of hydrocarbons and gasification of coal or biomass could be used for the efficient generation of H2 via water-gas shift (WGS, CO + H2O = CO2 + H2) reaction as illustrated in Fig. 20. Traditional CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts are commercially applied for the WGS reaction at low temperatures, but its activity is too low to be suitable for the transportation application [157–160]. Recently, Thompson et al. [161] developed a synthesis process for the preparation of metal modified molybdenum carbide catalyst, in which they used aqueous wet impregnation method in order to deposit Pt on molybdenum carbide surface directly (i.e., not on the oxidized surface). They found that this kind of catalyst had high activity for WGS reaction. It is indicated that the supported Pt had special morphology (raft-like) which can provide more active sites around the interface between metal and molybdenum carbide surface. Although this aqueous wet impregnation method avoided the exposure of the carbide to oxygen, it should be difficult to be applied in industry. Various molybdenum carbide catalyst physicochemical properties and WGS catalytic activity are listed in Table 6. One can see that comparing with commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst, molybdenum carbide catalyst shows high WGS stability. Furthermore, it should be note that supported metal influences not only the molybdenum carbide catalyst physicochemical properties, but also the catalytic activity and stability. Moon and Ryu [162] prepared molybdenum carbide at different carburization temperatures in a CH4/H2 atmosphere for WGS reaction. They found that the surface area of catalyst and activity have great relationship with the carburization temperature. The catalytic activity follows the order: Mo2C (640°C) > Mo2C (650°C) > Mo2C (660°C) > Mo2C (630°C) > Mo2C (615°C) > Mo2C (670°C) and the optimum carburization temperature is in the range of 640–650°C. The stability test results indicated that although it is more stable than Cu-Zn-Al commercial catalyst, gradually deactivation occurred during the thermal cycling runs. XPS analysis results indicated that the deactivation of the molybdenum carbide was caused by the transitions of Moδ+(IV < δ+ < VI, MoOxCy), MoIV and Mo2C on the surface of molybdenum carbide to MoVI (MoO3) with the reaction of H2O in the reactant. Patt and Moon et al. [60] also studied the pure molybdenum carbide catalyst for WGS reaction. Their results indicated that molybdenum carbide catalyst was more active than commercial Cu-Zn-Al WGS catalyst under the condition employed (220–295°C) and the apparent activation energies for the Mo2C (17±2kcal/mol) and Cu-Zn-Al (17±2kcal/mol) were similar. The stability test results indicated that there was no decrease in the activity for the molybdenum carbide catalyst during 48h. Nagai and Matsuda [163,164] reported a series of Co modified molybdenum carbide catalysts synthesized by TPRe for WGS reaction at 453K. The effects of carburization temperature and Co loading amount on the Co-Mo carbide on the activity for WGS water were investigated. It is found that 873-K carburized Co0.5Mo0.5C was the most active one among all prepared Co-Mo carbide catalysts; the initial activity was more active than the commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst. The activity test results indicated that the CO conversion increased with the increase in Co content up to 50%, and then decreased at a 75% Co content. Here, the Co0.5Mo0.5C showed the highest BET surface area. On the other hand, the characterization indicated that CO chemisorption amount on the Co0.5Mo0.5C-873K catalyst was 2.1 times higher than that on the commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst. It is also found that the reactivity of the Co-Mo carbide catalyst was very sensitive to the carburizing temperature. The TOF (turnover frequency) of the 873-K carburized catalyst was greater than that of the catalyst carburized at other temperatures, i.e., 873K: 9.6min−1, 823K: 6.2min−1. It indicates that the carburization temperature could result in the creation of various carbide species such as oxycarbides which result in different catalytic activity. The TPR, TEM and XRD results indicated that the bimetallic Co-Mo oxide was not completely carburized at 873K and some remained oxygen in some parts could generate amorphous Co-Mo oxycarbides. Nagai et al. [165] reported that molybdenum carbide with carbon deficient sites exhibited a much higher CO chemisorption than those completely crystallized molybdenum carbides. Thus, they suggested that high activity of 873-K carburized sample might be due to many carbon deficient sites in Co3Mo3C crystallites existed in the Co-Mo oxycarbides. On the other hand, the increase in activity is likely due to the increase in the Co atom. The increase in the Co content resulted in fine particles of the Co-Mo oxycarbides and a high CO chemisorption property. It is suggested that CO could molecularly adsorb on the Co- and C-terminated surface defect sites of the Co-Mo carbides rather than dissociating on the surface face, and as such, water will react with the adsorbed CO or carbidic carbon of the catalyst to produce H2 and CO2. Nagai et al. [166] further investigated Ni modified molybdenum carbide with various Ni loading amounts on the catalytic activity for WGS reaction at 453K. They found that the 873-K carburized Ni0.25Mo0.75C catalyst exhibited the highest conversion rate of CO among the catalysts carburized at 823, 923 and 973K with different Ni loading amounts. It indicated that the addition of Ni on the molybdenum carbide could enhance the catalyst activity and stability at low temperatures. The loadings of 15% (Ni0.15Mo0.85C) and 25% (Ni0.25Mo0.75C) Ni increased the CO conversion while further increase of Ni loading amount led to a decrease in catalytic activity since Ni loading amount influenced the final carbide surface area and surface properties. The surface area of Ni0.15Mo0.85C and Ni0.25Mo0.75C increased to 52m2/g and 45m2/g, respectively, from 26m2/g of Mo2C. However, further increase of Ni loading amount led to the decrease in surface area. Especially, Ni0.25Mo0.75C-873K catalyst exhibited a high CO chemisorption property. The activity test results indicated that Ni0.15Mo0.85C exhibited a CO conversion similar to that of Ni0.25Mo0.75C but had higher CO chemisorption and lower TOF (CO chemisorption: 66μmol/g for Ni0.15Mo0.85C, 24μmol/g for Ni0.25Mo0.75C; TOF: 6.7min−1 for Ni0.15Mo0.85C, 20 for Ni0.25Mo0.75C). The authors considered that Ni0.15Mo0.85C had more weak active sites while Ni0.25Mo0.75C had a relatively less strong active sites. Furthermore, the characterization indicated that Ni0.25Mo0.75C-873K catalyst contained β-Mo2C and amorphous Ni-Mo oxycarbide (NiMoC3.6O1.4) which led to the high activity. Ma et al. [151] applied noble metal (Pt) modified molybdenum carbide with embedded nanostructure for WGS reaction. A special embedded structure of Pt particle on molybdenum carbide was firstly found (as shown in Fig. 21). They considered that this structure could hinder Pt sintering at high carburization temperature and provide more active sites between the interface of Pt and molybdenum carbide substrate. Pt-MoxCy catalysts were prepared at different carburization temperatures. Comparing with the XRD pattern of Pt-MoO3, the intensity of the Pt peak became weaker after the carburization process, indicating that the size of Pt particles decreased or the morphology of Pt particles became more platelet-like. With the increase in the carburization temperature, it is found that the Pt position shifted to high angle (39.6–40°), indicating that with the increase in the degree of carburization, the Pt crystal structure was changed or a solid mixture was formed during the carburization process. The authors further investigated the surface nanostructure by STEM and HR-TEM. As shown in Fig. 21, Pt particle located on the surface of molybdenum oxide but inserted into the surface of MoxCy after the carburization process. It should be noted that the contact angle between the Pt and MoO3 surface is greater than 90°, indicating that the interaction between Pt and MoO3 surface should be very weak. However, after the carburization process, Pt particle seems to insert into the molybdenum carbide crystal and be surrounded by molybdenum carbide and form an embedded structure. This should be the main reason why the Pt particles did not sinter during the high temperature carburization process. Furthermore, such an embedded nanostructure could enhance the interaction between the Pt and molybdenum carbide. Based on the XPS, STEM and HR-TEM analyses, it is considered that the structure change of Pt-MoC during the carburization process will be as the process illustrated in Fig. 22. As a result, this embedded structure catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity for WGS reaction. As shown in Fig. 23, 3%Pt/MoxCy obtained by carburization at 700°C showed the best catalytic performance. Especially, at a reaction temperature as low as 150°C, the CO conversion reached 100%. Furthermore, the authors considered that the catalytic activity should be increased with the increase in the degree of embedded structure formation (see Fig. 24). Tominaga and Nagai [62] studied the WGS reaction mechanism on molybdenum carbide surface by using the density functional theory (DFT). They chose β-Mo2C (001) as the model face. The calculated results indicated that the large absolute value of the mulliken charge of the C atom of the adsorbed CO is related to the greater adsorption energy, and C–O bond length could be increased from 1.36 to 1.49Å after H2O adsorption, suggesting that the dissociation of C–O should occur after the H2O molecular adsorption. They suggested that the WGS reaction steps on β-Mo2C (001) surface will be as follows: (a) water molecule dissociates into OH and H; (b) OH group further dissociates to O and H; (c) CO molecule approaches O for the formation of CO2. Herein, step (c) exhibits a large energy gap in all the step, indicating that CO2 formation is the rate-determining step. The whole reaction steps can be expressed as follows: (23) CO+*↔CO* (24) H2O+*↔H2O* (25) H2O*+*↔OH*+H* (26) OH*+*↔O*+H* (27) CO*+O*+2H*↔CO2+H2+4*"
9,Other reactions for hydrogen production,"3.4 Other reactions for hydrogen production Very recently, Vrubel and Hu [73] reported that molybdenum carbide can be used as electro-catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from aqueous solution. They found that molybdenum carbide not only shows excellent HER activity at acid solution but also has good catalytic performance in basic solution. Generally, only a few catalysts shows the activity in both pH=0 and pH=14 solutions as Pt catalyst can do. Chen et al. [74] enhanced the molybdenum carbide HER activity by supporting molybdenum carbide particles on the carbon nanotube and XC-72R carbon black. They found that compared with bulk molybdenum carbide, MoC2 supported on carbon nanotube showed superior electrocatalytic performance for HER with small overpotential (63mV for driving 1mA/cm2 of current density). Near-edge XAS analysis and EIS results clearly indicated that incorporation of molybdenum carbide onto a carbon nanotube support gave a significant enhancement in the exchange current density and a remarkable reduction in change-transfer resistance. It is observed that the catalytic activity of MoC/carbon-nanotube even after 3000 cycles still remained as its initial activity, but that of bulk molybdenum carbide sharply decreased. Liao et al. [101] prepared nanoporous molybdenum carbide catalyst by pyrolysis of MoOx/amine hybrid precursor for HER electrocatalytic reaction. They found that due to enriched nanoporosity and large reactive surface area, the prepared molybdenum carbide exhibited superior HER activity with lower onset overpotential (70mV vs RHE) and higher current densities (63mA/cm−2, at 200mV) than commercial Mo2C. Such an electocatalytic activity is one of the best reported non-noble catalysts in acidic media to date. Wang et al. [167] investigated the effect of different molybdenum carbide phase on the HER catalytic activity in acidic media (pH=1). Four molybdenum carbide phases (α-MoC1−x, η-MoC, γ-MoC and β-Mo2C) were synthesized by using amone-metal oxide composite material as precursor. The HER activity indicated that β-Mo2C exhibited the highest catalytic activity with lower onset overpotential (40mV vs RHE) and higher current densities (0.9mA/cm−2, at 200mV) than others. However, based on both theoretical and experimental results, γ-MoC should be the most stable phase among all four phases. Chen et al. [168] prepared molybdenum carbide by using biomass-molybdenum oxide solid reaction method. They prepared MoO3 from ammonium molybdate via several thermal decomposition steps at first, and then, solid-state reaction between MoO3 and the amino groups in biomass proteins was performed for the formation of γ-Mo2N, and elemental carbon transforms molybdenum into β-Mo2C. As such, the obtained product is a Mo2N-Mo2C mixture. Such molybdenum carbide catalysts also drive the HER with low overpotential and high current density. The authors prepared Mo1Soy catalyst by using Soybeans as C and N sources and found that it exhibited very high catalytic activity with lower onset overpotential (70mV vs RHE) and higher current densities (12mA/cm−2, at 150mV). The authors considered that the HER catalytic activity of Mo1Soy should be attributed to the synergistic effect between the Mo2C phase and the γ-Mo2N phase in the composite material. Here, the presence of N and C atoms in the vicinity of the molybdenum center could facilitate the hydrogen production rate from water. The effects of synthesis method, material phase and surface properties on the catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide for HER are listed in Table 7. Zheng et al. [169] applied the molybdenum carbide as a catalyst for hydrogen production through ammonia decomposition reaction. Molybdenum carbide showed high activity and ammonia conversion reached 75% at a reaction temperature of 600°C, and remained stable for 100h. The relatively high hydrogen production rate (30mmol/gcat) observed for the catalytic decomposition of NH3 is attributed to those highly energetic sties (twin boundaries, stacking faults, steps and defects) existed in molybdenum carbide. Kaewpanha et al. [99] prepared biomass char supported molybdenum carbide by MoO3-dry cedar in-situ solid-state reaction and applied for hydrogen production from the steam reforming of biomass. The characterization indicated that molybdenum carbide was formed on biomass char at a carburization temperature of 800°C. The effect of Mo loading amount on the catalytic activity was investigated. It is found that comparing with non-catalytic system, as-prepared char supported molybdenum carbide obviously enhanced the hydrogen production yield. In the case of 20wt% of initial Mo loading amount, the highest H2 yield was obtained and about 5 times more than that of non-catalytic system (see Fig. 25). Regenerated experiment indicated that the deactivation of as-prepared catalyst resulted from the oxidation by reactant water. However, the as-prepared catalyst is easily regenerated under Ar atmosphere at 900°C, and the regenerated catalyst showed a little higher gas production yield than the original one. Koós and Solymosi [170] studied formic acid decomposition over Mo2C/carbon catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by the reaction of MoO3 with different carbon supports. At 475K, the activity for formic acid decomposition was in an order of 1% Mo2C/Norit > 5% Mo2C/Norit > 2%Mo2C/Norit > 1% Mo2C/CNT with selectivity to H2 between 95–98%, and almost no changes in activity or selectivity were observed within 10h. Flaherty et al. [171] investigated the pathway of decomposition of formic acid on two kinds of surface models, i.e. Mo (1 1 0) and C-Mo(1 1 0). Two general approaches, i.e., reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) combined temperature programmed desorption (TPD) on a clean molybdenum surface and reactive molecular beam scattering (RMBS) were used for investigating the formic acid decomposition, and determining the effects of carburization towards selective bond cleavage. It is found that carbon-modified Mo (1 1 0), i.e., C-Mo (1 1 0), showed up to 15 times more selective for the dehydrogenation of formic acid than that of Mo(1 1 0). The introduction of carbidic carbon on the Mo(1 1 0) surface suppressed the production of formyl but increased the fraction of bridge-bonded formate. By analysis of the reaction kinetics from 350 to 700K, it is found that the carburization of the surface poisoned the majority of active sites for dehydration while dramatically decreased the activation energy for dehydrogenation from 34.4±3.3 to 12.8±1.0kJmol/l. The RAIRS spectra showed the presence of new reaction intermediates on C-Mo (1 1 0) including monodentate formate, CO − 2 δ species, and carboxyl intermediates which were absent on Mo (1 1 0). On C-Mo (1 1 0) at 400K, the monodentate formate and the adsorbed CO − 2 δ species were observed while at 500K the carboxyl intermediate, OCOH, was also evident and as a result, CO2 and H2 were formed in the gas phase. The combination of kinetic and vibrational data indicated that the C–Mo(1 1 0) surface promoted dehydrogenation of formic acid via new reaction pathways which were not existed on Mo(1 1 0)."
10,Theoretical investigation of H2 production on molybdenum carbide surface,"3.5 Theoretical investigation of H2 production on molybdenum carbide surface Computational chemistry is rapidly emerging as a subfield of theoretical chemistry, where the primary focus is on solving chemically related problem by calculations. Here, theoretical investigation of structure properties of molybdenum carbide and catalytic process related to the H2 production over molybdenum carbide surface is reviewed. Carburization is a complex process. In this process, as mentioned above, carbon-containing gases are the carbon source, while hydrogen is for reduction of deposited molybdenum oxide [172]. The geometry and electronic structure of molybdenum oxide during the carburization process were studied by Dorota et al. [173]. The DFT calculation result indicated that the stability of single oxygen atom substituted structure in the carburization process is as follows: O (2) > O (3) > O (1). Here, O (1) is singly coordinated oxygen atom; O (2) is doubly coordinated oxygen atom and O (3) is triply coordinated oxygen atom. The stimulated structure is shown in Fig. 26. In the carburization process, it is found that the formation of C2 and CO groups is the stabilizing factor when the bulk structure is considered. These might be created without energy barrier, regardless the hindrances imposed by the lattice atom. While the surface cluster is considered during the carburization process, the energy barrier-less formation of C2H2 and CO species is also observed. In general, both in bulk and at the surface, the C-containing species have tendency to aggregate. The thermodynamic consideration reveals that the carburization of molybdenum oxide by methane is endothermic process. It is known that molybdenum carbide is highly metallic, and the band near the Fermi level (0–1eV) is mostly composed of Mo 4d orbitals. On the other hand, molybdenum carbide is known for its high hardness. Therefore, molybdenum carbide can be used as coating material, filling material in hard metals and grain refine alloys. However, the calculation results carried out by Liu and Salahub [174] indicated that rather than being rigid, molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are very flexible under reaction condition (i.e. in benzene hydrogenation reaction). The authors used the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism as the model to stimulate the adsorption of benzene and coadsorption of hydrogen molecule on the molybdenum carbide nanoparticle surface. The results indicated that benzene hydrogenation reaction is a surface structure sensitive reaction on the molybdenum carbide nanoparticle surface. The choice of active sites is more important than that of the size of the molybdenum carbide nanoparticle. In addition, the DFT results showed that the benzene and hydrogen molecules can change the molybdenum carbide nanostructure. At the end of the six hydrogenation reactions, the authors found that the structure of the molybdenum carbide nanoparticle was changed when compared with the initial state before the reaction. The optimized structure of the molybdenum carbide nanoparticle transformation during the benzene hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 27. To date, lots of efforts have been denoted in the experiments, however, few works have been carried out in the theoretical investigation in hydrogenation production on molybdenum carbide catalyst surface. Ren et al. [175] studied the structure and energetics of the chemisorbed CO2 and CH4 on the Mo2C surface by using the GGA-RPBE (Generalized Gradient Approximation-Revised Perdew Burke Ernzerhof) level of density functional theory. Although they did not give us the overall DRM (dry reforming methane) catalytic cycle, the information about chemisorbed CO2 and CH4 structure and energetics was provided for the related DRM reaction. Here, the molybdenum carbide [0001] surface model is shown in Fig. 28; the optimization results indicating all initial orientations on different sites of Mo2C are shown in Fig. 29; and the calculated adsorption energies and bond parameters as well as the net charges of the chemisorbed CO2 on the Mo2C are listed in Table 8. It can be found that CO2 in adsorbed position 1 (CO2-1) is the most stable adsorbed surface structure with the largest adsorption energy (−2.38), while CO2-2 to CO2-5 have much lower adsorption energies (−0.54 to −0.14). These results indicated that CO2 molecule adsorbed could be dissociated into CO and O. On the other hand, in gas phase, CH4 sequential dissociation should be highly endothermic reaction. The calculation results indicated that there is significant reduction in the dissociation energy on Mo2C surface owing to the presence of the strong Mo-CHx and Mo-H bonds. As mentioned above, for the dry reforming of methane reaction on the molybdenum carbide surface, CO2 should be dissociated to CO and O while CH4 gradually dissociated to H and CHx species, and the O could connect with C (which is generated from methane molecule) for the generation of CO. Although the catalytic performance of steam reforming of methanol and adsorption of methanol on Mo2C have been extensively studied [95,102,114,115,176,177]. However, there are still have several secrets in the black box concerning the adsorption properties, adsorbed site on the Mo2C surface, methanol molecule adsorption geometry and so on. The increasing application of modern theoretical methods in various fields of chemistry and catalysis provides an alternative tool to understand catalytic reaction at the molecular level. Recently, Pistonesi et al. [178] used DFT method to investigate methanol adsorption and dissociation on Mo2C [001] surface at the SRM reaction condition. The authors built the surface model based on the follow points: (i) Mo-terminated surface is very important for catalytic performance and the catalytic reaction mainly occurs on it; (ii) based on the previous UHV results, it can be assumed the presence of methoxy species during the methanol decomposition on the Mo2C. As such, the final adsorption geometry is shown in Fig. 30. O is finally bonded to a Mo atom on a top position with a O-Mo distance of 2.2A and with the H atom pointing toward a 3-flod position. The H-O-CH3 angle increases by 5%, also O-H and O-C distances increase by 5% and 1% after adsorption. Based on this model, the computed adsorption energy for methanol on Mo2C is −0.39eV (−37.8kJ/mol), which is excellent agreement with the value of −37kJ/mol measured by temperature programmed desorption. On the other hand, based on the Nudge Elastic Band method, the finding minimum energy position on specific spatial regions can be used to determine such a pathway. During this process the energy of the system reduces to 0.84eV for the final state, while there is an activation energy barrier of 0.6eV. Fig. 31 shows a possible reaction pathway while H is moved away from the methanol to give a finally adsorbed methoxy on the top and a 3-fold Mo site. This also indicates that molybdenum carbide should be a suitable catalyst for steam reforming of methanol reaction. Tominaga and Nagai [62] studied the water gas shift reaction mechanism over molybdenum carbide by using density functional theory (DFT) method. Firstly, it is suggested that CO should be adsorbed on four sites on the molybdenum carbide as shown in Fig. 32. In this optimized model, CO is placed on the threefold Mo site with the underlying C atom of the second layer of the C atom (a); CO is placed on the threefold Mo site without the underlying C atom (b); CO is placed on the twofold Mo site (c); the CO is placed on the onefold Mo site (d). The calculated energy changes for the adsorption of CO on the β-Mo2C are: model a (−281.59kJ/mol); model b (−321.00kJ/mol); model c (−215.24kJ/mol); model d (−160.46kJ/mol), respectively. Based on the adsorption energies, one can see that the models a and b have the second and the highest adsorption energies, respectively. This indicates that the CO tend to be adsorbed on the models a and b. However, further investigation indicates that the adsorption structure, model b, is expected to the intermediate step for the dissociation of the CO molecule under the sever reaction conditions such as high reaction temperature and/or high pressure. Thus, model b is not suitable for the WGS reaction. On the other hand, the IR data showed that the band at 1626cm−1 is (a) the nearest adsorption of the threefold Mo site with the underlying C atom at the calculated/corrected band of 1621cm−1. After the optimization of H2O dissociation on the β-Mo2C surface, the overall WGS reaction potential energy and transition state are shown in Fig. 33. One can see that the activation energy for the reaction process in step 1, i.e., H2O → H + OH (TS1), is 19.18kJ/mol. This process readily proceeds to the intermediate 2 which is the most energetically stable (568.6kJ/mol). The dissociation of OH in step 4 to form H and O atom (TS2) is as high as 217.1kJ/mol. The step from intermediate 3 to TS3 (O + CO → CO2) exhibits a large energy gap for all the step (555.0kJ/mol), indicating that intermediate 3 to TS 3 is the rate-determining step for WGS reaction. Therefore, the calculated reaction for WGS should proceed as follows: (a) water molecule dissociates into OH and H; (b) the optimization of the approaching OH and CO step does not result in the formation of CO2 but the dissociation of OH into O and H; (c) the OH is further dissociated into O and H atoms; (d) CO approaches O in which the largest energy gap is exhibited in all the steps, indicating that this is the rate-determining step; (e) CO2 is formed. Liu and Rodriguez [61] further studied the essential active site on molybdenum carbide catalyst surface for water gas shift reaction, in which they used the adsorption energy obtained from DFT calculation. Two different molybdenum carbide surface terminations were employed: Mo-terminated Mo2C (001) (Mo-Mo2C) and C-terminated Mo2C (001) (C-Mo2C). It is found that the activity decreased in a sequence: Cu > C-Mo2C > Mo-Mo2C. The low activity of pure molybdenum carbide due to the fact that either the Mo sites or the C sites can bond oxygen too strongly to allow the facile removal of oxygen in the form of CO2. The calculated adsorption energy is shown in Table 9. Compared with Cu, the adsorption energy of Mo-Mo2C and O-Mo-Mo2C have higher adsorption energy. However, when the molybdenum carbide surface is covered by O atom dissociated from H2O molecule, the O-covered Mo-terminated Mo2C (001) (O-Mo-Mo2C) will be the worst one among the catalysts studied here. This is due to the formation of Mo oxide in the surface, which introduces strong repulsion to those O-containing adsorbates (i.e. CO and H2O). In other words, O-Mo-Mo2C is too inert to adsorb CO and dissociate H2O. On the other hand, as shown in Table 9, O-C-Mo2C surface provides moderate adsorption energy for CO and H2O. The calculation results also indicate that the C-Mo2C covered by the same amount of oxygen (O-C-Mo2C) displays the highest WGS activity of all. The calculated relative rate of WGS reaction indicates that O-C-Mo2C exhibits the highest rate, followed by Cu > Mo-Mo2C > O-Mo2C. Overall, the high activity is due to the formation of a Mo oxy-carbide (O-C-Mo2C) on the surface of Mo2C during the WGS reaction. The C atoms destabilize the covered O by forming CO species, which shift away from the Mo hollow sites when the surface reacts with other adsorbates. In this way, the Mo sites are able to bond the reaction intermediates moderately, which results in a high WGS activity. In addition, both C and O atoms are not spectators and directly participate in the WGS reaction. Formic acid (HCOOH) has great potential as an in-situ source of hydrogen for fuel cell, because it offers high energy density and can be safely handled in aqueous state. However, there is a lack of solid catalysts with high selectivity. For formic acid dissociation reaction (HCOOH → CO2 + H2), there is a side reaction (HCOOC → CO + H2O). The side reaction could decrease the efficiency of H2 production. Koós and Solymosi [179] reported that the highly stable molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) catalyst prepared from the reaction of MoO3 with a multiwall carbon nanotube and carbon Norit can selectively decompose formic acid into CO-free H2 at 373–473K. Recently, Lou et al. [180] employed density functional theory computation to investigate the decomposition of formic acid (HCOOH) into CO2 and H2 on the β-Mo2C (101) surface. Based on the DFT calculation, there are three possibilities formic acid decomposition routes: (a) HCOOH → CHO + OH; HCOOH → HCO2 + H; HCOOH → CO2H + H. However, the formate (HCO2) route is the most favorable. Thereafter, formate dissociation into CO2 and H is kinetically much more favored route. On the other hand, formate dissociation into CO2 and H is the rate-determining step. DFT results indicate that the formation of CO and H2O is impossible way on molybdenum carbide surface, and molybdenum carbide exhibits a unique property to catalyze formic acid dissociation into CO-free H2. The authors further studied the adsorption properties of HCOOH, HCO2, CO2, and H, and found that the dissociation energy of the above mentioned species on Mo2C (101) is much higher than Pd (111) and Pt (111), in particular, the much stronger CO2 chemisorption."
11,Conclusions and remarks,"As reviewed above, hydrogen is considered one of the most promising clean energy in the future. Many catalysts have been development for catalytic hydrogen production. Since molybdenum carbide has similar catalytic property as noble metal (like Pt), many scientists reported molybdenum carbide and modified molybdenum carbide as the effective catalyst for hydrogen production using various reaction systems. It is firmly believed that molybdenum carbide will provide the potential and challenging opportunity for future hydrogen production. Overall, the following conclusions can be made from the recent researches on molybdenum carbide as a catalyst for hydrogen production: (a) Preparation route and carbon source can influence the physicochemical properties of molybdenum carbide, especially surface area, crystal structure and surface state. Comparing with other preparation ways, solid-solid state reaction method seems to be the best way to obtain molybdenum carbide with higher surface area, smaller particle size and highly ordered structure. (b) Metal/molybdenum carbides prepared by TPRe method under the carbon-contained gas-hydrogen atmosphere show higher catalytic activity and stability than the bulk molybdenum carbide. For these kinds of catalysts, surface area and crystal structure are influenced by the metal loading. On the other hand, it is found that the loading metal can modify the surface electronic environment of molybdenum carbide by the strong interaction between metal and molybdenum carbide. (c) Molybdenum carbide, metal modified molybdenum carbide and supported molybdenum carbide exhibit good activity for various hydrogen production reactions such as dry methane reforming, water gas shift reaction, steam reforming of methanol reaction and so on. Comparing with pure molybdenum carbide catalyst, the low-temperature activity and catalytic stability can be enhanced by doping the second transition metal on the molybdenum carbide catalyst. Especially, Pt modified molybdenum carbide shows ultra-high low-temperature catalytic activity for the steam reforming of methanol reaction and water gas shift reaction. (d) Special nanostructure can be found in metal loaded molybdenum carbide catalyst, which can influence the catalytic activity greatly. For example, embedded structure is found in the Pt-MoxCy catalyst. This special embedded structure results in high catalytic activity and long-term stability for SRM and WGS reactions. Characterization indicates that the formation of embedded structure might be due to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), and the active sites should be around the interface between Pt and molybdenum carbide. Despite the very interesting and unique surface reactivity of the molybdenum carbide catalysts has been found to date, several issues still need to be investigated and developed. Especially, the detailed experimental and theoretical investigations of the surface structure coupled with catalytic reactivity data are expected to definitely provide important information on understanding the catalytic mechanisms of the molybdenum carbide and metal modified molybdenum carbide deeply. Furthermore, detailed structural characterization by using surface science methods such as the STM and XANES techniques should be also very important for the understanding carbide surface properties, interaction between metal and carbide surface and relationship among the surface electronic properties, crystal structure and catalytic properties of molybdenum carbide catalysts. In the future work, the following points should be considered in order to lead forward the molybdenum carbide as a potential catalyst for hydrogen production: (a) Surface oxidation mechanism: Different from the noble metals, surface oxidation by oxygen, H2O and/or other oxygen containing reactants is one of the main reasons for the deactivation of molybdenum carbide during hydrogen production. To date, the surface oxidation mechanism is still not so clear. It is necessary to apply some novel in-situ imaging, monitoring, and measuring technologies combined with simulations such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study it in order to find a way to solve this problem. (b) Carbon deposition during preparation as well as reaction: It is found that carbon is easy to be deposited on the surface of molybdenum carbide during the preparation process when using gaseous carbon sources or during the reaction when using those reactants containing carbon. This is a general problem for many kinds of catalytic processes. For molybdenum carbide based catalysts, it is necessary to know the carbon deposition mechanism in more details, especially how the carbon species adsorb on the surface and are dissociated so that some ways can be found to solve the carbon deposition problem. (c) Catalyst structure: Some special structures can be found in different molybdenum carbide based catalysts. It is necessary to know the formation mechanism of these nanostructure. As reviewed above, it is found that the embedded structure is benefit to stabilize Pt nanoparticles on the molybdenum carbide surface even at the high temperature (700°C). It might be also suitable for other noble metals, such as Au and Pd. How to expand the knowledge on such kinds of special structure to other transition metal modified molybdenum carbide should a challenge in the future research. On the other hand, it is worth to deeply studying embedded structure using some new techniques such as X-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS). It is possible to obtain some new knowledge and improve the performance of other low-cost catalysts for hydrogen production. (d) New catalysts with new structure development: It is required to develop novel molybdenum carbide based catalysts with some unique structures which can improve the catalytic activity and stability. Recently, those materials with core-shell nanostructure have been attracted widely attention, and they are possible to be widely applied in electrochemical reaction and catalytic reaction fields [181–183]. The unique properties are mainly resulted from the interaction between the core metal and shell. The strong interactions between molybdenum carbide and its loading metal has been identified to have great influence on its activity and stability. It should be possible to synthesize core-shell metal modified molybdenum carbide catalysts, which might show some unique and interesting catalytic properties for hydrogen production. Another important clue is the preparation of catalysts with sandwich structure. Recently, Li and Chen [39] prepared CoOx/MgO/Ta3N5 catalyst with the sandwich structure for high-efficient water oxidation under visible light irradiation. For molybdenum carbide based catalysts, one promising way is to tune the activity of the molybdenum carbide surface by using other materials such as MoO3, MgO or CeO2 with a nanolayer (0.2–0.5nm) to modify the molybdenum carbide surface, and then dope the second metal on this state-of-the-art surface. It is possible to obtain a sandwich molybdenum carbide based catalyst as illustrated in Fig. 34. Here, this nano-layer is expected to improve the molybdenum carbide stability by enhancement of oxidation resistance and simultaneously the electron of the molybdenum carbide substrate could penetrate this nano-layer, and shows stable catalytic activity."
