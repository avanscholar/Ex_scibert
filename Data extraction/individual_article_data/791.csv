0,Introduction,"With the increasing awareness of unwanted climate change, the search for clean and sustainable energy sources has become imperative [1–3]. Hydrogen (H2) is an ideal fuel as its combustion only produces water. Electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting have long been considered as a promising approach for H2 production, which necessarily involves a H2 evolution reaction (HER) and a O2 evolution reaction (OER) [4–8]. Unfortunately, the sluggish OER kinetics often requires a relatively high anode potential to match the rate of HER, restricting the overall reaction rate and energy conversion efficiency. Despite numerous efforts on electrocatalysts optimization, the theoretical minimal applied voltage needed for overall water splitting (1.23 V) makes H2 production still a high energy consumption process [9,10]. In addition, the product of OER, O2, has limited high value. Thus, alternative anodic reactions that can generate valuable product at low voltage and provides electrons for H2 generation are highly desired. Coupling H2 production with more thermodynamically favorable anodic reactions is a promising approach to lower the overall energy requirements [11]. To achieve efficient alternatives to OER, electrooxidation of fine chemicals (such as ammonia, methanol, urea, and hydrazine) and low-cost biomass (such as benzyl alcohol, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and glycol) have been reported recently [12–17]. While these anodic reactions can lower the voltage input for hydrogen production and generate valuable products, the high cost of fine chemicals and the limited reducing power of biomasses limit practical application. Further, a strong alkaline media is generally required for these alternative reactions to be operated efficiently, and the unfavored corrosion issue inevitably increases the cost of system (Table S1 online). Herein we report a strategy of decoupling H2 production from water oxidation by integrating a bioelectrochemical cascade reaction (Fig. 1 ). Enzymatic reactions are currently receiving tremendous interest in the context of organic synthesis [18–22]. For instance, oxidase enzymes can convert low-cost biomass into high valuable products in neutral media in the presence of O2 ( R + O 2 → O x i d a s e P + H 2 O 2 ) [23,24], while concurrently generates H2O2 that can be further in situ electrooxidized ( H 2 O 2 → O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e - , ~0.68 V vs. RHE) more thermodynamically favorable than that of OER [25,26]. Based on these advantages, we hypothesized that with an efficient bioelectrochemical cascade reaction, this strategy can not only reduce the energy input for efficient H2 production but also generate high-value products in neutral media. To demonstrate this strategy, we used a bioelectrochemical cascade that takes place at a bioanode with a solid–liquid-air triphase interface as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 a. Based on this triphase bioanode architecture, sufficient oxygen needed in the oxidase enzymatic reaction can be directly provided from the air phase, resulting in the massive generation of H2O2 that can be in situ electrooxidized at the bioanode [27,28]. Thus, an efficient bioelectrochemical cascade reaction can be achieved and used as an alternative to conventional OER. In this work, taken glucose oxidase (GOx) and Pt as a model enzyme and electrocatalyst towards H2O2 oxidation, respectively, we found that the anodic potential and energy consumption were reduced by ~0.70 V and ~36%, respectively, relative to H2 production based on a bare Pt anode to achieve 10 mA/cm2. This led to efficient generation of H2 at the cathode and additional production of gluconic acid (GA)—an important and valuable chemical intermediate that is widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries at the bioanode."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4, 126,000 U g−1) was obtained from Toyobo Co., Ltd. Glucose and Chitosan were obtained from Sigma. H2PtCl6·6H2O was obtained from Aladdin. Glutaraldehyde, Acetic acid, Sulfuric acid, Sodium hydroxide, Monosodium phosphate, Sodium dihydrogen phosphate and Potassium chloride were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Carbon nanotube aqueous dispersion (0.15 wt%) was supplied from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. All solutions were prepared using ultrapure distilled water (18.2 MΩ cm, Hitech laboratory water purification system)."
3,Construction of the bioanode,"2.2 Construction of the bioanode First, the carbon cloth substrate was successively ultrasonic cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water, then immersed into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suspension (2 wt%) for 10 min. After being taken out and dried in air, it was annealed at 350 °C for 30 min. Then, carbon nanotube solution was diluted ten times (0.015 wt%) and drop-casted onto the carbon cloth substrate (1 mL/cm2) and dried at 80 °C for 0.5 h. After that, Pt nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto the surface at −0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl using H2PtCl6 solution (10 g/L H2PtCl6·6 H2O:H2O:1 mol/L H2SO4 = 1:1:2, v:v:v). Finally, a certain volume of a mixed solution of glucose oxidase (30 mg/mL in DI water), chitosan (2 mg/mL in 1 vol% acetic acid), DI water, glutaraldehyde (5 wt% in DI water) and carbon tube (0.015 wt%) with a volume ratio of 50:6:4:35 was drop-casted onto the above substrate with an area of 0.5 cm2, and dried naturally. Diphase bioanode was prepared using a graphite plat in a similar way except that carbon nanotubes were not used."
4,Characterization and electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Characterization and electrochemical measurements Microstructures of the bioanode were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S4700, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Water contact angle measurements were performed using a Contact Angle Goniometer (JC2000D6, Powereach, Shanghai, China). Enzymatic reaction kinetics measurements were carried out in a phosphate buffered solution (PBS, 0.2 mol/L, pH 7.2). The initial H2O2 formation rate (V 0) at different glucose concentrations was calculated by measuring the amount of H2O2 produced five minutes after the addition of glucose. The concentrations of H2O2 were determined by iodometry using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer in all experiments. Electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature using a CHI-660e work station (CH Instruments, Inc). The bioanode or Pt anode was used as the working electrode, a Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3 mol/L KCl) was used as the reference electrode. Although the potential was measured against an Ag/AgCl (3 mol/L KCl) reference electrode, the results in this work are presented against the RHE.The conversion between potentials versus Ag/AgCl and versus RHE was performed using the equation: (1) E vs . RHE = E vs . Ag / AgCl + E Ag / AgCl reference + 0.059 × pH . Hydrogen evolution test was carried out in a two-compartment reaction vessel separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117). The bioanode or Pt anode and reference electrode were placed in a chamber (anode chamber), the Pt mesh counter electrode was placed in the other chamber (cathode chamber). The experiment was performed in PBS solution (30 mL in each compartment, 300 mmol/L glucose was added to the anode chamber). To start the experiment, the PBS solution of cathode chamber was passed with N2 for 30 min to remove air. N2 was passed into the cathodic compartment at a constant rate of 20 mL/min, and the solution was stirred at 800 r/min. The quantification of gaseous H2 was conducted using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A). Liquid products (gluconic acid, GA) were quantified using a Bruker AVIII 600 MHz NMR spectrometer."
5,Results and discussion,"The triphase bioanode was constructed by sequentially immobilizing a carbon nanotube film, Pt nanoparticles and a GOx layer onto a polytetrafluoroethylene treated superhydrophobic carbon cloth substrate (experimental details in the Supplementary materials). The superhydrophobic carbon cloth substrate has a porous structure (Figs. 2b and S1a (online)) and a water contact angle (CA) of 151° ± 2° (inset in Fig. 2b). Following the carbon nanotubes film immobilization (Figs. 2c and S1b online), Pt electrocatalysts with a size ranging from 50 to 400 nm were electrodeposited onto the surface (Figs. 2d, S1c and S2 (online)). Finally, a GOx/chitosan composite layer was drop-casted onto the surface with an area of about 0.5 cm2 (Figs. 2e and S1d (online)). The as-constructed bioanode has a hydrophilic top surface with a CA of about 42° ± 2° and a superhydrophobic bottom surface, i.e., an asymmetric wettability. When the bioanode is in contact with an aqueous electrolyte, sufficient oxygen can be supplied directly and rapidly from the superhydrophobic side via gas phase to the reaction interface (Fig. 2a). Compared to a conventional solid/liquid diphase bioanode where interfacial oxygen can only be supplied from the aqueous phase, an efficient bioelectrochemical cascade reaction can be achieved using the as-constructed triphase bioanode. We then investigated the performance of the bioanode in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.2) containing glucose. For comparison, OER using a bare Pt anode was conducted under the same test conditions. According to the polarization curve shown in Fig. 3 a, a potential of ~1.78 V vs. RHE is required for OER at the bare Pt anode to afford a current density of 10 mA/cm2. In contrast, the potential required for the bioanode was significantly reduced by 0.7 V to achieve the same current density, indicative of a thermodynamically more favorable bioelectrochemical cascade reaction than conventional OER. Next, to rule out the contribution of glucose electrooxidation to the anodic current, direct electrochemical oxidation of glucose using a bare Pt anode in PBS was performed. As shown in Fig. S3 (blue curve, online), a much higher potential is required for direct glucose electrochemical oxidation under the same conditions, suggesting that the current output of the bioanode is solely resulted from the bioelectrochemical cascade reaction. To confirm the above results, chronoamperometry experiments using the bioanode and bare Pt electrode were then carried out at 1.1 V vs. RHE. Figs. 3b and c show that when the bioanode was used, H2 and GA were constantly produced at a rate of 0.17 mmol/h and 0.21 mmol/h (Fig. S4 online) as revealed by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, whereas these products were not detected when bare Pt anode was used because both glucose and water cannot be oxidized at such a low potential under the same conditions. These results confirm that both H2 and value-added products can be simultaneously obtained at a much lower anodic potential by replacing conventional OER with a bioelectrochemical cascade reaction in water splitting. An efficient bioelectrochemical cascade reaction is crucial for the proposed energy saving H2 production system, and thus oxidase kinetics was then evaluated. H2O2 generated during the oxidase enzymatic reaction at the triphase and diphase bioanodes was measured by iodometry without an electrochemical oxidation reaction [29]. The chromogenic changes after 300 s upon addition of glucose with various concentrations are shown in Figs. 4 a and S5 (online). The corresponding initial formation rates (V 0) of H2O2 were calculated via the Beer-Lambert law (Eq. (2)) and plotted in Fig. 4b (red curve) from which the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) and maximum velocity (V max) of triphase bioanode can be determined (Eq. (3)) to be 106 mmol/L and 5.5 μmol/min, respectively [30–32]. By integrating the V max value into Eq. (4), the apparent oxidase catalytic constant (K cat) at the triphase bioanode can be calculated to be 399 min−1, a value of 42-fold higher than that obtained using a diphase bioanode (9.4 min−1) as shown in Fig. 4c. The much-higher oxidase kinetics at a triphase bioanode can be attributed to the high accessibility of oxygen to the reaction interface via the air phase. It is worth noting that the oxidase enzymatic reaction rate can be further increased by over two times when the oxygen level in the gas phase was increased from 21% to 100% (Fig. S6 online). The high oxidase kinetics at a triphase bioanode is a prerequisite for the proposed H2 generation system to be efficiently operated. (2) A = k b c , (3) V 0 = V m a x · S K m + S , (4) K cat = V m a x [ E ] . The utilization efficiency of the oxidase enzymatic product H2O2 is another decisive factor governing the performance of the cascade reaction. During the electrochemical oxidation process, the H2O2 generated at the bioanode surface can also diffuse into the electrolyte, resulting in a lower utilization efficiency and lower H2 production at the cathode. Fig. S7 (online) shows the kinetics of H2O2 concentration in the solution with and without electrooxidation, indicating that over 80% of the oxidase enzymatic product H2O2 was electrochemically oxidized at the bioanode at a potential of 1.1 V vs. RHE. The high oxidase kinetics and H2O2 utilization efficiency gives the triphase bioanode a high reaction rate, leading to over 30-fold larger anode current (Fig. S8 online) and over 30-fold faster H2 production rate at the cathode compared with the water splitting system using a diphase bioanode (Figs. 4d and S9 (online)). We reason that the utilization efficiency of enzymatic product H2O2 can be further increased upon optimization of the triphase bioanode architecture and the selection of active electrocatalysts, leading to a much higher current output and H2 generation rate. The stability of the triphase bioanode-based anodic reaction was further evaluated. Fig. 4e shows a stability test for the triphase bioanode while being held at a constant potential of 1.1 V (vs. RHE). The current density decreased merely ~0.7 mA/cm2 over a 10-h course, suggesting good durability of the triphase bioanode. The bioanode was then coupled with a Pt mesh cathode to construct a two-electrode electrolyzer towards H2 production. Fig. 5 a shows that, in the absence of glucose, the polarization curve of the H2 production system in PBS had an onset potential at around 1.40 V. To achieve anodic current densities of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mA/cm2, cell voltages of 1.75, 1.84, 1.93, and 2.02 V, respectively, were required. In contrast, upon the addition of glucose, the anodic onset potential was reduced to 0.9 V, and the cell voltages were lowered to 1.05, 1.17, 1.31, and 1.42 V to achieve 5, 10, 15, and 20 mA/cm2, respectively (Fig. 5b). Using these voltages for comparison, we found that the input energy was reduced by ~36% with the bioanode to achieve a comparable current output (e.g., 10 mA/cm2) compared to that of the Pt anode, implying much better energy conversion efficiency relative to regular overall water electrolysis."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, we have demonstrated a strategy for decoupling H2 production from water oxidation by utilizing a bioelectrochemical cascade reaction that occurs at a triphase bioanode. Owing to the efficient oxidase kinetics at the triphase bioanode and the more favorable thermodynamics of the electrochemical oxidation of in situ generated H2O2 than the conventional OER, the cell voltage and energy input required for H2 production was reduced by ~0.7 V and ~36%, respectively, relative to the conventional water splitting. Moreover, valuable enzymatic product was generated at the bioanode. It is anticipated that even lower cell-voltage for H2 production and an increased product generation rate can be achieved by further tuning the triphase interfacial bioanode architecture and reaction interface microenvironment as well as improved electrocatalysts and oxidase enzymes, which is the focus of our future work."
