0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has attracted increasing interest all over the world because of its cleanness, renewable character, and gravimetric energy density (122kJ/g) [1], which is the highest among all kinds of known fuels. As compared to the conventional chemical routes to produce hydrogen, such as steam reforming of natural gas, gasification of coal and electrolysis of water [2], biohydrogen production processes are a more desirable alternative because they help to cope with the overproduction of agricultural products and industrial wastes, as well as to contribute to reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Biohydrogen production is generally divided into two categories: photosynthetic and dark fermentation [3,4]. Dark fermentation is a more promising method considering its high hydrogen evolution rate in the absence of any light source and the versatility of the substrates used. However, since an ideal maximum 4mol of hydrogen can be obtained from hexose through dark fermentation [5], more research is needed to make it economically viable for large scale production. Modifications of the fermentation process, including heat-shock pretreatment, metabolic engineering, gas sparging, optimum bioreactor design, integrating fermentative processes with that of photosynthesis, are some of the ways that have been reported to improve hydrogen productivity [6–12]. Recently, our group utilized gold nanoparticles, a bioactive agent, to enhance the hydrogen productivity of our anaerobic mixed culture [13]. However, the cost of gold nanoparticle was too high for practical application. Thus, searching new low-cost and efficient bioactive agents is necessary and important. As a low-cost reducing agent, l-cysteine was reported to reduce the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) values of the fermentation system and increase the growth rate of some bacteria [14]. Moreover, l-cysteine was claimed to be a mediator between bacteria and substrate [15], so it had the potential to be used as a bioactive agent for increasing the extent of fermentation, the reproduction of hydrogen-producing bacteria, and the utilization rate of the substrate, which were the most important factors for improving hydrogen productivity. Meanwhile, dark fermentation is also affected by many operating parameters, including environmental temperature, pH, cell density, and nutritional history of the cells. Among these factors, temperature is of vital importance and can affect both the cultivation and the hydrogen producing activity of bacteria [16]. Moreover, it may also affect the bioactivity of l-cysteine aiming to improve hydrogen productivity. In the considerations above, we utilized l-cysteine as a bioactive agent in order to enhance dark fermentative hydrogen production. Anaerobic mixed culture was used as inocula because anaerobic mixed culture could consume organic substrates derivable from wastes and could be used in association with wastewater treatment. The effect of l-cysteine was investigated through studies on hydrogen production characteristics, degradation efficiency, conversion efficiency of substrate to hydrogen, and metabolites distribution. According to our previous work [16], the optimal fermentation temperature range for the mixed culture used in this study was 30–35°C. Therefore, dark fermentations were conducted through batch tests at two mesophilic temperatures (35 and 30°C) as comparison in order to address whether and how temperature affects the bioactivity of l-cysteine."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and medium,"2.1 Inoculum and medium The anaerobic mixed culture was enriched from cracked cereals and identified to be dominated by Clostridium butyricum [17]. The bacteria were acclimated in a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8h at 35°C in chemostat for about 1 month. The reactor was stirred by gas circulation and the substrate reservoir was kept at 4°C by a water bath. 1l of the medium used for fermentation consisted of sucrose, 11 100mg; NH4HCO3, 3770mg; K2HPO4, 125mg; NaHCO3, 2000mg; CuSO4·5H2O, 5mg; MgCl2·6H2O, 100mg; MnSO4·4H2O, 15mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 25mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.125mg. The bacteria were directly used as inocula without any pretreatment."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures The seed microorganisms were placed into 120ml vials with a working volume of 80ml. After addition of 20ml inocula and 60ml nutrient solution, the air was removed from the headspace by argon gas sparging for 5min before the bottles were capped with rubber septum stoppers and placed in a reciprocal shaker (reciprocation: 5cm×120 strokes per min). The initial sucrose concentrations of all experiments were 12.5g/l and the l-cysteine concentrations were ranged from 0.1 to 1.0mM. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 and the operation temperatures of the reactors were controlled at 35 or 30°C, respectively. The biogas production was measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes, ranging from 10 to 100ml. Each experiment was replicated three times and average values of the results were reported in this study. The gas production data reported were standardized to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (760mmHg)."
4,Chemical analysis,"2.3 Chemical analysis The proportion of hydrogen was determined by a gas chromatograph (Techcomp Co., China, 7890II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 2m stainless iron column packed with Porapak Q (60/80 mesh). The operating temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were set at 70, 50 and 70°C, respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The cumulative hydrogen volume at each time interval was calculated from gas composition and the total volume of biogas production, using Eq. (1) [18]: (1) V H,i = V H,i − 1 + C H,i (V G,i − V G,i − 1)+ V H,0 (C H,i − C H,i − 1), where V H,i and V H,i−1 are cumulative hydrogen volumes at the current (i) and previous (i −1) time intervals, V G,i and V G,i−1, are the total biogas volumes in the current and previous time intervals which were measured by a plunger displacement method using appropriately sized glass syringes, ranged from 10 to 100ml. C H,i and C H,i−1 are the fraction of hydrogen in the headspace of the bottle at the current and previous intervals and V H,0 is the total volume of headspace in the bottle. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C2–C4) and other solvents were measured by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU Co., Japan, GC 14B) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 2-m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh). The temperatures of the injection port, the oven and the detector were set at 160, 140 and 160°C, respectively. The carrier gas was also Argon at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of sucrose after the reaction were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using sucrose as a standard [19]. The concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) were determined according to the procedures described in the standard methods [20]. The final pH and oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) values were measured using a pH meter (PHB-9901-3C, China). The ORP values were calculated by the equation of ORP= E 0 +249.1 (mV), where E 0 is the observed ORP and 249.1 is the potential value of saturated calomel electrode."
5,Model analysis,"2.4 Model analysis The modeling of hydrogen production during the batch studies is based on the following modified Gompertz equation (2) [21]: (2) CHV=THV exp{−exp[R m e(λ − t)/THV+1]} where CHV is the cumulated hydrogen production (ml); THV, total hydrogen volume (ml); t, reaction time (h); λ, lag time (h); and R m, the maximum hydrogen production rate (ml/h)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of l-cysteine on hydrogen production characteristics,"3.1 Effect of l-cysteine on hydrogen production characteristics Gas product analyses indicated that the biogas produced by the hydrogen-producing bacteria only consisted of H2 and CO2 without any detectable CH4 or H2S during the whole course of hydrogen production, suggesting that methanogens and sulphate-reducing bacteria were absent during the experiment. The final results of all 36 tests at two mesophilic temperatures are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Extra experiments using l-cysteine as the sole substrate with concentration of 0.1–1mM were done at 30 and 35°C. 1l of the medium used for fermentation consisted of l-cysteine, 0.1–1mmol; NH4HCO3, 3770mg; K2HPO4, 125mg; NaHCO3, 2000mg; CuSO4·5H2O, 5mg; MgCl2·6H2O, 100mg; MnSO4·4H2O, 15mg; FeSO4·7H2O, 25mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.125mg. The results showed that no hydrogen gas was detected during the whole experimental course, indicating that in this fermentation system, l-cysteine only acted as a reducing agent but not an extra substrate for producing hydrogen. Typical profiles of hydrogen production for cumulated hydrogen volume as a function of time at 35°C are shown in Fig. 1 . The pattern of the cumulated hydrogen with time exhibits a typical lag, exponential and stationary phase. The model fits experimental data in Table 1 well with the R 2 values all greater than 0.99. Consequently, the modified Gompertz equation is useful and relatively accurate to predict the cumulated hydrogen production (CHV) as well as the rate of H2 production (R m). When l-cysteine (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0mM) was added into the experiment, the lag times decreased dramatically to 1.2–4.0h, which were much shorter than 8.4h of the blank test. The maximum H2 production rate of experiments increased to 9.0–10.2ml/h, which were 1.5–1.7 times as 6.0ml/h of the blank test. In addition, the end time decreased to ca. 50h compared to ca. 69h of blank test. The acceleration of hydrogen production reflects l-cysteine increases the hydrogen-producing activity of the bacteria during the fermentation. From Table 1 we can see that the total hydrogen volumes and hydrogen yields show a rapid increase and then a slow decrease along with the increase of l-cysteine concentration. But all the total hydrogen volumes and hydrogen yields of the tests with addition of l-cysteine were higher than that of the blank test. One reason for this phenomenon is likely to be that l-cysteine depressed the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) values in fermentation systems to levels that would initiate cell growth [22]. This implication was supported by the results listed in Table 2 that the final ORP values of the tests after addition of l-cysteine were lower (−226∼−272mV) than the corresponding blank test (−171mV). The other reason is probably that l-cysteine can be a mediator between the bacteria and the substrate to increase the utility rate of the substrate [15]. Therefore, the cell growth and utilization rate of the substrate increased, resulting in the increase of the maximum hydrogen production rate, as well as the decrease of the lag time and end time. The maximum total hydrogen volume of 199ml and the hydrogen yield of 3.10mol H2/mol sucrose were obtained in the test with addition of 0.6mM l-cysteine, which were 18.3% and 15.2% higher than that of the blank test, respectively. In order to find whether and how temperature affects the bioactivity of l-cysteine, batch tests were conducted at 30°C as comparison using the same innocula as those tests at 35°C. The hydrogen production profiles of all tests at 30°C are shown in Fig. 2 and the results are also listed in Table 1. The lag times decreased from 11.5h of blank test to 1.9–5.7h of the tests with addition of l-cysteine, which were a little longer than the tests with the same concentration of l-cysteine at 35°C. The maximum H2 production rate of the blank test decreased from 6.0ml/h at 35°C to 4.1ml/h at 30°C, suggesting that the activity of bacteria decreased when the temperature was lowered by 5°C. Interestingly, when 0.1–1.0mM l-cysteine were added into the tests, the maximum hydrogen production rates increased pronouncedly to 9.0–11.7ml/h, which were 2.2–2.9 times as that of the blank test at 30°C. The immense increase of maximum hydrogen production rate is also because of the ability of l-cysteine to reduce the ORP values in the fermentation system with l-cysteine (−221∼−262mV) than the blank test (−160mV) [23], as well as to increase the utility rate of the substrate. This phenomenon indicates that the bioactivity of l-cysteine became a crucial factor for hydrogen production characteristics between the temperatures ranging from 30 to 35°C. Therefore, it can be inferred that anaerobic fermentation at 30°C would produce almost the same amount of hydrogen as that at 35°C after adding a little l-cysteine into the fermentor with the advantage to consume less power for maintaining a lower fermentation temperature. The maximum total hydrogen volume of 208ml and the hydrogen yield of 3.28mol H2/mol sucrose were obtained in the test with addition of 0.1mM l-cysteine, both of which were increased 70% in comparison to the blank one. The reason for the relatively large increase seems to be that decreasing the ORP values in the fermentation system by adding l-cysteine tended to tune the fermentation type of the hydrogen-producing bacteria to produce more hydrogen as product [24]. However, when the concentration of l-cysteine increased over 0.2mM, the total hydrogen volumes slowly decreased, although they were still higher than that of blank test. The same phenomenon was seen in the tests at 35°C. One reason may be the following: l-cysteine is a good absorbent for metal ions due to the presence of two carboxyl groups, two amido groups and two sulfur atoms in a molecule, the excess part of l-cysteine might combine with the nutrient element in the medium to form unavailable compound for bacteria, which would result in the decrease bioactivity of bacteria and the hydrogen yield [25]. However, at present the clear mechanism of this phenomenon is still an open question and needs to be investigated further."
8,Effect of l-cysteine on substrate utility efficiencies and metabolites distribution,"3.2 Effect of l-cysteine on substrate utility efficiencies and metabolites distribution Tables 1 and 2 show all of the data for biogas production, final pH, and metabolite distributions after the experiments ended. Table 1 shows that hydrogen content in the biogas are between 42–46% for experiments at 35°C and 34–47% for those at 30°C, respectively. The maximum hydrogen contents were 46 and 47%, obtained at 0.6 and 0.1mM l-cysteine at 35°C and 30°C, respectively, which were consistent to the maximum hydrogen production rates. Substrate degradation efficiencies of all experiments are over 97%, exhibiting the high substrate utility ability of this anaerobic mixed culture. Since all the data were obtained right after hydrogen production ended, the bacteria in the experiments with addition of l-cysteine could degrade substrate efficiently in a shorter time (ca. 69h) than the blank ones (ca. 50h). Conversion efficiencies of substrates to hydrogen were calculated based on the assumption of a maximum 8mol of hydrogen per mol of sucrose when the substrate was converted wholly to hydrogen and acetate, and the values are in the range of 34–39% at 35°C and 24–41% at 30°C, respectively. Different from other data given above, the VSS values (ranging from 800 to 1621mg/l) have no obvious trend along with the change of temperature or the increase of l-cysteine. Because of the complex community nature of the mixed cultures, we could not obtain much information just through VSS tests. Further research using other useful techniques, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction–Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE), are needed to understand the mutual relationship between different community of bacteria and their function on hydrogen production. Table 2 shows the major metabolites produced by the anaerobic mixed culture, such as ethanol, acetate, propionate and butyrate. In general, production of acetic and butyric acid favors the production of hydrogen, according to Eqs. (3) and (4), and on the contrary, production of ethanol and propionate results in less or even no hydrogen according to Eqs. (5) and (6) [26]: Acetate production: (3) C6H12O6 +2H2O→2CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 Butyrate production: (4) C6H12O6 →CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 Propionate production: (5) C6H12O6 +2H2 →2CH3CH2COOH+2H2O Ethanol production: (6) C6H12O6 →2CH3CH2OH+2CO2 As shown in Table 2, the productions of butyrate and acetate are in accordance with the trend of hydrogen production, indicating that acidogenic bacteria that produced butyrate or acetate contributed to the majority of hydrogen production. Acetate and butyrate concentrations increased more with the addition of l-cysteine compared with those of the corresponding blank tests. The metabolite distributions indicate that acidogenic bacteria contributed to the majority of hydrogen production. For most of the tests, however, the addition of l-cysteine effectively directed metabolism to produce more VFAs and less alcohols than the corresponding blank tests. The pH values of all the fermentation systems are in the range of 4.42–5.15, supporting a main acid formation of metabolites."
9,Conclusions,"Batch tests using l-cysteine as bioactive agent to improve hydrogen productivity were conducted at two mesophilic temperatures: 35°C and 30°C. The results show that addition of a small amount of l-cysteine (0.1–1.0mM) could shorten the lag time and end time, increase the maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield, as well as to shift the metabolic pathways to produce higher concentrations of acetate and butyrate. The highest increase in total hydrogen production volume (70%) and hydrogen yield (70%) was achieved by the addition of 0.1mM l-cysteine compared with the corresponding blank test at 30°C. Furthermore, the results of this work implicated that hydrogen production at relatively lower temperature (e.g. 30°C) with adding a small amount of l-cysteine into the fermentor would be less power-consuming with almost the same hydrogen yield with that at 35°C."
