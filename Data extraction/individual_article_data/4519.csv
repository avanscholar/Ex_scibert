0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as a clean energy carrier is currently produced from various costly processes such as the reforming of fossil fuels, resulting large emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants [1–4]. Alternatively, visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production with the potential of utilizing abundant, green, and free solar energy will simultaneously reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and the air emissions of pollutants [4–10]. Alongside, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is an important clean chemical resource that is widely used in organic synthesis and wastewater treatment, recently attracted much attention as an energy carrier in fuel cells as a substitute for hydrogen due to its lower volumetric energy density and high solubility in water· H2O2 is industrially synthesized via high energy-consuming anthraquinone method. Also, there is a direct synthesis method from H2 and O2 gas which needs noble metals as a catalyst. Recently, photocatalytic production of H2O2 over semiconductors through the 2e- reduction of oxygen gas has attracted interest due to its green nature, no risk development, and low price of the materials [11–13]. As an ideal example for an appropriate photocatalyst candidate working under visible light irradiation, layered compounds have demonstrated a wide range of physicochemical properties for potential practical applications [14–20]. Further, the resulting lamellar structure facilitates the easy transformation of the bulk to a nanostructure by exfoliation of the layers [9]. Among different layered materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted extensive research attention over the past few years [8,21]. In particular, g-C3N4, with its appropriate optical, chemical, and economical properties, along with its facile synthesis, can lead to the increased photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and the 2e- reduction of oxygen in the visible range of the solar spectrum [4,8,22–25]. Besides, the conduction band (CB) position of g-C3N4 appropriately meets both reaction potentials [26]. Despite the aforementioned merits, pristine g-C3N4 suffers certain drawbacks, including low specific surface area and high recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers, low charge transport capability at in-plane and interplane structure due to the presence of hydrogen and weak van der Waals bonds, respectively [27–29]. Elemental doping in the g-C3N4 framework has been applied as a typical strategy to improve its photocatalytic performance [30–33]. The substitution of non-metal elements in g-C3N4 melem units and metal elements in nitrogen pores can enhance the charge carriers’ separation and mobility in the in-plane structure [34–36]. Besides the intercalation of metal elements between the molecular layers can enhance the delocalization of the π-electronic system in the vertical direction and as a result decrease the potential barrier for charge transport [37–40]. Therefore, the doping-induced modification is still a promising technique for electronic band structure manipulation and charge transport improvement in the g-C3N4 structure. Many theoretical and experimental works have shown that doping strategies can be more successful in combination with nanostructure formation [33,41–45]. This method can solve the problems associated with the low surface area and inaccessible basal plane [46]. Also, this method provides more edge sites that are remarkably active centers for catalytic reactions. Fu et al. [33] prepared hierarchical porous O-doped g-C3N4 nanotubes via sequential thermal oxidation exfoliation and curling-condensation of bulk g-C3N4. They synthesized bulk g-C3N4 by thermal condensation of melamine at 550 °C for 2 h. Tube-like O-doped g-C3N4 showed a capacity of 0.045 mmolg−1 CO2 uptakes, more than double that (0.019 mmolg−1) of bulk g-C3N4. This CO2 uptake is enhanced due to increased surface area as a result of an extremely porous texture tube-like O-doped sample. The main product of photocatalytic CO2 reduction was CH3OH. Han et al. [47] reported the fabrication of iodine-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets via a two-step method of thermal polymerization, followed by ball milling. Then, the as-prepared bulk sample and iodine were ground in a planetary ball mill for 50 h at 25 Hz to make iodide-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets, which exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 890 μmolg-1h−1 compared with 390 μmolg-1h−1 for iodide free g-C3N4 nanosheets and 90 μmolg-1h−1 for bulk g-C3N4. Zhu et al. [48] fabricated a phosphorus-doped flower-like nanostructure of g-C3N4 in the one-step synthetic procedure. Their flower-like P-doped g-C3N4 exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 2000 μmolg-1h−1, compared with 250 μmolg-1h−1 for the pristine sample. Most studies simply utilized one doping element and improved the π electron delocalization in the single-g-C3N4 sheet, in-planar structure. Meanwhile, the delocalization of π electrons between layers achieved by mixing different dopant elements shows a great promise [49–51], as Cheng and his coworker studies showed that the higher potential barrier of 33.2 eV inhibit charge transport between the layers compare with 7.9 eV across the hydrogen bonds at the in-plane structure [46]. Here, we present the successful synthesis of highly porous and wrinkled B, Cs co-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets using a co-doping method assisted with hydrogen-bonded melamine framework formation through recrystallization of melamine in water at elevated temperature [52] followed by calcination step, and thermal etching process. In the co-doped sample, the H3BO3 as a boron dopant source has the advantage to produce melamine-boric acid adduct. Melamine and boric acid form a supramolecular structure by making hydrogen bonds [53,54]. The formation of this adduct causes that other melamine molecules in the solution phase connect to the structure in a defined direction that is different from the pure melamine solution. Interestingly, the breakage of these hydrogen bonds in the precursor structure during thermal treatments produces a porous and twisted structure in the final nanosheets. In the following, the photocatalytic activities of the prepared new photocatalysts were investigated and an original mechanism was proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,2.1 Chemicals All the chemicals were of analytical grades and used without any further purification. Distilled water was used for all the experiments.
3,Synthesis procedure,"2.2 Synthesis procedure 2.2.1 Preparation of boron and caesium co-doped g-C3N4 bulk (B, CsCN-B) and nanosheets (B, CsCN-Ns) In a typical recrystallization procedure, 5 g of melamine and different amount (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g) of boric acid and caesium chloride were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and magnetically stirred for 60 min at room temperature. Then, the as-prepared dispersion was refluxed at 70–80 °C for another 60 min. During this time, the mixture completely dissolved in the water. After cooling the solution, the as-obtained white precipitate (recrystallized melamine plus boron and caesium) was centrifuged at 4000 rpm, washed with distilled water three times, and then dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The obtained white complex powders were completely grounded and heated in a ceramic-covered crucible from RT to 500 °C under air condition and kept at 500 °C for 3 h, after that the temperature was raised to 550 °C and heating was continued for another 3 h. To prepare g-C3N4 nanosheets, the obtained powder of bulk sample was placed in an open crucible and thermally exfoliated for 2 h at 500 °C. Two other co-doped samples were prepared by adding different amounts of boric acid and cesium chloride (0.1 g and 0.3 g) and were labeled as B, CsCN-1 and B, CsCN-3, respectively while keeping other parameters constant. 2.2.2 Preparation of non-doped g-C3N4, single-doped g-C3N4 bulk form (GCN-B, BCN-B, CsCN-B), and nanosheets (GCN-Ns, BCN-Ns, CsCN-Ns) The procedure to make non-doped, single boron-doped g-C3N4 (BCN) and single caesium-doped g-C3N4 (CsCN) were the same as that for the co-doped samples, except that only no dopant or one dopant (0.2 g) material was added to the melamine aqueous solution. After preparing bulk samples (BCN-B, CsCN-B), the same heat treatment was applied to make nanosheets. To optimize the type of dopant including single doping and co-doping, all prepared nanosheets photocatalysts were applied in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) as the target pollutant and photocatalytic production of H2O2 under visible light irradiation and neutral pH condition. The degradation results (Fig. S9) demonstrated that co-doping is more effective than single doping in both photooxidation and selective photoreduction experiments."
4,Photocatalytic tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic tests 2.3.1 Hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were carried out in a glass reactor with stirring at RT and side illumination. A Xenon lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm, Scott) and an IR filter were used to restrict the illumination to the visible light portion. In a typical procedure, 1 mg of photocatalyst powders were dispersed in a 10 mL aqueous solution of 20% (v/v) triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Then, (3% wt) Pt was photo deposited as a co-catalyst on the photocatalyst powder surface by dissolving H2PtCl6 in a photocatalyst suspension and irradiating with a 300 W Xenon lamp for 1 h. The solution was then bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min before irradiation to remove the air solubilized in the solution. The gas samples were taken every 60 min and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with a barrier discharge ionization detector (BID) to measure the hydrogen production rate. 2.3.2 Selectively 2e- reduction of oxygen: H2O2 production Photocatalytic experiments for H2O2 production were conducted by adding 20 mg of catalyst to 20 mL liquor containing 5% ethanol, followed by oxygen purging for 30 min to obtain an oxygen-saturated suspension. Afterward, the mixture was illuminated by a 300 W xenon lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter for different time intervals up to 1 h. An iodometric method was used to calculate the H2O2 concentration [12]. In detail, the catalysts were separated via centrifugation and filtration. Then, 2 mL of 100 mM potassium iodide and 50 µL of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (10 mM) were added to the 20 mL of supernatant. The obtained mixture was stirred for 5 min and analyzed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer by applying the absorbency of iodine in 352 nm. 2.3.3 RhB degradation The performance of the as-prepared samples in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was evaluated by analyzing the decomposition of RhB (10 mg/L) under 300 W xenon light irradiation and cut-off filter 420 nm. In each experiment, 15 mg of photocatalyst powder was added to 15 mL of aqueous RhB solution. The suspensions were magnetically stirred for 0.5 h in the dark to obtain adsorption–desorption equilibrium before light irradiation. During photocatalytic degradation, 4 mL of the suspensions were taken at the specified intervals and then centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst particles. The RhB concentrations were analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at λmax = 550 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer and the concentration was obtained using the standard curve."
5,Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were conducted in a three-electrode cell system using electrochemical station Versa STAT 3. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductive film glass deposited with the samples, Pt wire, and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The clean FTO glass was first obtained by sequentially washing with acetone, distilled water, and ethanol in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min. Afterward, 30 mg of each sample was well dispersed in a mixture of 10 μL Nafion solution (5%) and 2 mL ethanol for 60 min using an ultrasonic bath. In continue, 100 μL of the as-prepared suspension was drop-casted onto 2 × 2 cm−2 FTO glass. After air-drying at 50 °C, a homogeneous film was obtained. The photocurrent response of the photocatalysts was measured at 0.3 V bias voltage in a mixture of 0.2 M Na2S and 0.04 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution to prepare the photocurrent-time curves. Mott-Schottky plots were obtained at a frequency of 1.5 kHz. For the Nyquist plots, the frequency was ranged from 100 kHz to 0.01 kHz."
6,Characterization equipment,"2.5 Characterization equipment The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker AXS (D8 Advance model) diffractometer in the range of 2θ = 10.0–80.0 at 0.1-degree steps using 3 kW Cu-closed X-ray tube radiation. A Varian 670/620 spectrometer was used to record the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. The surface composition of the samples was analyzed based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific spectrometer equipped with a monochromated Al-Kα, UV He1, and He2 source of energy under an ultrahigh vacuum of 1.0 × 10-10 Torr. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (Model: Nova NanoSEM) was used to analyze the surface morphology of the photocatalysts. The diffuse reflectance spectra were taken by using a Carry 5000 UV–VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). The spectra were recorded at room temperature in the air in the range of 200–800 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer (NF900(FLS920), Edinburgh Instrument, UK) at an emission wavelength of 340 nm and a range of 200–800 nm. For the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, various g-C3N4 catalysts were provided after flame sealed in capillary tubes to prevent air and moisture exposure during the lifetime measurement. To measure the TRPL, the second harmonic generated beam of a Ti:sapphire laser (800 nm in the wavelength, 100 fs in the pulse width, and 82 MHz in the repetition rate) was used. The collected luminescence signal was dispersed by a monochromator (MS3504i, SOLAR TII) then detected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT-100, Becker & Hickl). The luminescence signal from the photomultiplier tube was processed by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system (SPC-730, Becker & Hickl) to yield the temporal behavior of g-C3N4. The monitoring window for the TRPL measurements was 520 nm and the excitation intensity was about 15 kW. To measure the surface area and pore size distribution, the Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) technique based on N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms was applied and an auto physisorption analyzer (model: ASAP2020 Analysis, Micrometrics Instruments) was employed 165 for this analysis. A Thermo Fisher Scientific UV–vis spectroscopy instrument (model: G10S UV166 Vis) was utilized to measure the remaining concentration of RhB at the maximum absorption wavelength of 554 nm. The photoelectrochemical characterizations were performed using Versa STAT 3, Princeton Applied Research device."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Morphology and surface properties,"3.1 Morphology and surface properties The morphology and microstructure of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. S2a and b show the SEM images of GCN-B and B, CsCN-B. GCN-B exhibited a column-like morphology, B, CsCN-B demonstrated the stacked structure of porous nanosheets. After the thermal etching process, GCN-Ns in Fig. S2c and d showed twisted and curved flaked layers which are the remaining parts of the columns breakage. This curved flaky structure of g-C3N4 has been obtained due to using a hydrogen-bonded melamine framework as the precursor which is different from the molecular melamine. Breaking many hydrogen bonds in this structure will produce curved nanosheets. Fig. 1 a-1f shows that the B, CsCN-Ns has been made of delaminated, 13-nm-thick, wrinkled nanosheets with many pores. The wrinkled and porous texture of B, CsCN-Ns was not observed for GCN-Ns which can be a result of the formation of hydrogen bond structure of melamine-boric acid adduct (supramolecular structure). The wrinkled and porous morphology of B, CsCN-Ns clearly shows the effective thermal treatment for the breaking of in-plane hydrogen bonds between heptazine units at a high temperature which may cause twisting of melon units [29]. The greater number of available lateral edge sites and the large proportion of accessible basal planes associated with largely enhanced porosity in co-doped nanosheets boosted the opportunity of available active sites for photocatalytic reactions [55]. Moreover, HRTEM images of B, CsCN-Ns in Fig. 1e and f confirmed the successful exfoliation of layers and the generation of the thin and porous structures of nanosheets. Also, the elemental mapping analysis assisted with HRTEM well-present the uniform distribution of B, and Cs in the carbon–nitrogen framework of B, CsCN-Ns. Meanwhile, the Cs mapping shows that the amount of Cs ions incorporated into the g-C3N4 structure is much less than the B amount. This result has been confirmed by EDX data, Fig. S3. and Table S1. In the reaction vessel for preparation of the precursor, melamine molecules in water were connected via the formation of hydrogen bonds and produce a melamine-based hydrogen organic framework (HOF). The boron source (H3BO3, boric acid) can be connected to the melamine via hydrogen bonds and makes the melamine-boric acid supramolecular structure. Therefore, H3BO3 can be entered into the melamine-based HOF structure via the formation of hydrogen bonds. This structure of melamine HOF with H3BO3 is stable in water due to a strong hydrogen-bonded structure; therefore, washing with water cannot remove boron from the framework. Whilst, the Cs source was CsCl, an inorganic salt. In the reaction vessel, CsCl dissolves in water via hydration of Cs+ and Cl- ions. In the following, some of the Cs+ ions can be adsorbed onto the melamine-based HOF using cation-π electron interaction but not all of them. The cation-π electron interaction competes with cation hydration; therefore, some of the Cs ions can be washed out during the washing process with water. Therefore, the resulting amount of Cs is much lower than that of boron in the precursor and the g-C3N4 structure. Surface analysis by N2 adsorption–desorption (Fig. 2 a) reveals that all the prepared samples exhibit type IV isotherm [56]. Meanwhile, B, CsCN-Ns demonstrated a well-resolved H3-type hysteresis with a pore volume of 0.3 cm3g−1 and a specific surface area of 77 m2g−1 (Fig. 2b, and Table S2). This kind of hysteresis loop reveals the presence of groove pores of a nonrigid generation formed by flaky particles in the type of mesopores and macropores [57], as shown in the SEM images of B, CsCN-Ns in Fig. 1a-d."
9,Crystal structures and the chemical states,"3.2 Crystal structures and the chemical states X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to study the effect of doping and thermal exfoliation on the paracrystalized structure of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 3 a, all prepared g-C3N4 samples contain two diffraction peaks of (100) and (002), which agrees with the bulk g-C3N4 (JCPDS 87–1526) [58]. The peak at 2θ = 27.50°, which is equivalent to a d-spacing of 3.23 Å, belongs to the (002) plane and is a sign of graphite-like structure material [59,60]. The low-angle diffraction peak (100) at 2θ = 13.1° with a nitride inter-pore distance of 6.75 Å is a reflection of the lattice plane being parallel to the c-axis and indicates in-plane structural packing of heptazine units in the structure [61,62]. This peak signifies the interlayer periodicity [60]. As Fig. 3c and d show, the position and intensity of the two main characteristic peaks of GCN-B were not greatly affected by only B, Cs co-doping. However, after thermal exfoliation, both samples presented a less pronounced (002) peak. The less intense (002) peaks in the nanosheet samples imply that the atomic sheets of the graphitic carbon nitride were profitably exfoliated. The (100) peaks have widened for the exfoliated catalysts and it can be related to two different parameters, the first one is decreased g-C3N4 atomic sheet size during the thermal etching process and the second one is breaking hydrogen bonds between melon strands within g-C3N4 atomic sheets. Other XRD parameters including dislocation density and strain were calculated based on the (100) plane and brought in Table 1 . The increased dislocation density (σ) and strain (ε) after both doping and thermal exfoliation process show the addition of new atoms (B, and Cs) and breaking of hydrogen bonds which cause fluctuations in the atomic structure of the single atomic sheets. Furthermore, the (100) peak position shifted to a lower angle due to the increase in nitride inter-pore distance or heptazine unit size from 6.75 to 6.82 Å as GCN-B transformed into B, CsCN-Ns. This expansion of nitride pore size has happened due to boron and caesium incorporation into the g-C3N4 framework (inter-planner nitride pore for B, CsCN-B = 6.81 Å), which slightly distorts the nitride in-plane pores [63]. Fig. 3b, the characteristic FTIR spectra of GCN-Ns, B, CsCN-B, and B, CsCN-Ns illustrate the same signals as those of GCN-B, which demonstrates that the main structure of the g-C3N4 samples was well retained even after co-doping and thermal exfoliation [27]. Similar FTIR signals were obtained for BCN-B and BCN-Ns and CsCN-B and CsCN-Ns (not shown). These results, in conjunction with the XRD data, clearly confirm the two-dimensional conjugated backbone of g-C3N4, which is essential for the π-delocalized electronic system to produce photo charge carriers that are well maintained [64]. The surface composition and chemical state of GCN-NS and B, CsCN-Ns were investigated using XPS analysis. The XPS survey spectra are shown in Fig. S4a confirm that the main components of both samples include a large fraction of C and N elements and a small amount of oxygen. The oxygen does not go to the g-C3N4 structure and it just exists in the form of surface oxygen connected to the surface carbon due to the adsorbed CO2 (C=O bond) or the formation of C-O bonds originated from the thermal oxidation process, Fig. S4b, and c. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of B1s in Fig. 4 a confirms the successful doping of B element in the graphite-like network with binding energy peaks centered at 192.0 eV and 188.0 eV, which correspond to the B-(N)3 and B-NH2 coordination, respectively [65,66]. Also, the core level spectrum of Cs3d in Fig. 4b confirms the presence of Cs in the B, CsCN-Ns structure. The Cs3d peak has been split into two separate peaks, Cs3d5/2 and Cs3d3/2, due to spin–orbit coupling of d orbitals located at 724.0 and 738.1 eV, respectively. The specific surface ratio of the two peaks, Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2, reported as a doublet of d orbitals was 3:2 [67]. The C1s and N1s spectra of the GCN-Ns and B, CsCN-Ns were de-convoluted into Lorentzian shapes and shown in Figs. S5, and Fig. 4c, d, respectively. In the N1s core level spectra (Fig. 4c and S5a), the sharp and intense peak at around 398.0 eV represents sp2 hybridized nitrogen in the ring (C-N=C). The group peak at around 400.0 eV is assigned to the overlap of tertiary nitrogen N-(C)3 and amino functions (C-N–H) [68]. The intensity reduced amino functionality peak for B, CsCN-Ns, presenting at a lower energy level than that of GCN-Ns, is related to exiting of amine groups from the surface and obtaining different surface structures from the bulk. Also, the shift of the peak positions suggests a change in the electronic structure after doping [69]. Also, an extra peak at about 399.0 eV in N1s core level spectrum of B, CsCN-NS was obtained which is not obtained for GCN-Ns. This extra peak can be a result of Cs coordinated nitrogen’s lone pair. In the C1s core level spectra (Fig. 4d and S5b), a small peak around 284.8 eV is assigned to graphitic carbon (C–C/C=C), which originated from external carbon contamination [70]. The second sharp peak around 287.8 eV is attributed to sp2 hybridized carbon in the N-containing aromatic ring (N-C=N). The next energy contribution at 289.1 eV can be assigned to the sp2-hybridized carbon in the aromatic ring attached to the NH2 group [45,71]. Besides, a weak signal positioned around 293.0 eV in the C1s spectra (Fig. 4d and S5b) and around 403.8 eV in the N1s (Fig. 4c and S5a) spectra can be assigned to the π electrons delocalized in CN heterocycles [64,72] thereby confirming the graphitic stacking of CN layers. The increased intensity of these two peaks in B, CsCN-Ns as compared with GCN-Ns, demonstrate the improved delocalization of π electrons resulting from the enhanced charge carrier mobility in B, CsCN-Ns. As it can be seen from Fig. S6, the chlorine (Cl) has not been detected in the XPS core-level spectra of Cl 2p3/2 that has peaks in the range of 198.5–199 eV. This may be because of the negative charge of chlorine in the solution which prevents the adsorption of Cl- on the rich electron structure of melamine hydrogen-bonded organic framework. Therefore, Cl- ions were washed out by rinsing the precursor (Melamine HOF) and cannot be incorporated into the g-C3N4 structure. Whilst Cs ions having positive charges could be easily adsorbed on the rich electron melamine HOF structure via cation- π electrons interaction. Solid-state 11B and 133Cs MASS-NMR characterization were conducted to obtain more details on the B and Cs chemical environments in B, CsCN-Ns. The 11B NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 5 a demonstrates two different chemical shifts at (δ) = -2.89 and + 15.97 ppm related to two different boron atom positions in the heptazine ring, one at the corner and another at the bay sites, as shown in Fig. 5a, inset. The signal of the corner sites appeared at higher ppm than that of the bay sites because the boron in the corner sites is connected to three nitrogen atoms and, therefore, the boron nuclei are more deshielded than the boron in the bay sites [66]. The intensity of the signals shows a much greater number of boron atoms in the corner sites than in the bay sites. Moreover, the 133Cs NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 5b reveals two inequivalent Cs+ nucleus sites in the g-C3N4 framework. The first peak at δ = -86.65 ppm and the second at δ = 433.07 ppm are related to interplane (Cs ions intercalated between layers) and in-plane (Cs ions located at nitrogen pores) Cs ions, respectively. The positive chemical shifts are observed due to the presence of 133Cs nuclei in the nitrogen pores. The high positive chemical shift suggests the presence of surrounded Cs nuclei with nine nitrogen lone pairs in each pore which can effectively deshield the Cs nucleus. In contrast, the negative chemical shifts arise due to the intercalation of Cs+ between the layers. These intercalated Cs ions are held by negatively charged g-C3N4 layers and the ion’s nuclei experience greater shielding effects from their local electrons than that of the reference material (CsNO3 with a chemical shift of zero) [73]. From the intensity of both signals, we can conclude that intercalated sites are more favorable for Cs+ nuclei. The 13C MASS-NMR spectra (Fig. S7) for all prepared photocatalysts exhibit two distinct peaks at δ = 164.5 and 156.6 ppm, representing the C atoms in (CN2(NHx)) and the C atoms of melem (CN3), respectively (Fig. S7 inset) [74,75]. GCN-B exhibits additional characteristic peaks of C sp2 (likely aryl), bonded to two aryl C sp2 at δ ≈ 125.5 ppm and 136.4 ppm, which are related to the adventitious carbon structure. No peaks corresponding to C sp3 at δ = 0–70 and 120 ppm are detected."
10,Optical properties and electronic band structure,"3.3 Optical properties and electronic band structure The optical property and electronic band structure of the as-prepared samples were studied using UV–Vis absorption and XPS valence band (VB) spectra. As shown in Fig. 6 a, two absorption peaks at 250–350 nm and 350–450 nm in the UV–Vis spectrum are assigned to the electronic transitions in conjugated heterocycle ring networks [76,77]. This confirms that the doping and thermal oxidation do not damage the π-conjugated system of g-C3N4. The optical band gap of g-C3N4 is attributed to the transitions between the weakly localized π–π* states that result from the sp2 hybridization of C and N in the CN framework [72]. Co-doping in the bulk structure greatly affects the band edge position and increases the absorption in the visible range. This was confirmed by the bandgap calculation (Tauck equation) when the energy gap decrease from 2.7 to 2.6 eV for GCN-B and B, CsCN-B, respectively (Figs. S8a and 8b). The UV–Vis spectrum of GCN-Ns shows a blue shift in the band edge position, concerning its bulk form GCN-B. Moreover, its calculated band gap (2.8 eV) confirmed this data (Figs. S8a and b). The Tauc plot of GCN-Ns shows an extra electron transition that is lower than the band gap (2.7 eV) and shows the presence of mid-gap states due to the presence of the defects in the structure. Interestingly, B, CsCN-Ns sample showed an enhanced absorption tail in the visible light. The possible electron transitions were investigated via Tauc plot calculation. The obtained Tauc plot validates the presence of one extra electron transition (2.4 eV) besides its band gap electron transition, 2.8 eV. The presence of the mid-gap which is excited by visible light enhances visible light absorption for B, CsCN-Ns. Furthermore, the observed bandgap increase in the nanosheet samples, GCN-Ns and B, CsCN-Ns is attributed to the strong quantum confinement effect which is associated with their thin nanosheets obtained from thermal exfoliation treatment. Fig. 6b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of GCN-B, B, CsCN-B, GCN-Ns, and B, CsCN-Ns at 350 nm excitation wavelength. Compared to GCN-B, B, CsCN-B shows a much lower peak intensity at around 475 nm. This suggests a suppressed photo charge recombination due to the increased charge diffusion rate in the π-conjugated system caused by the presence of B and Cs. Boron could substitute C atoms in the bay and corner positions in the heptazine units, which was confirmed by the B1s core level in the XPS spectrum. Incorporating boron into the g-C3N4 matrix transformed the electron-deficient boron atoms to electron-donating sites. In comparison with the normal π conjugated system of GCN, the vacant 2pz orbital of boron conjugates with the π-electron system to extract the electrons [78]. The lower electronegativity of boron, as compared with that of carbon, increases the activity of the π electrons and hence their mobility. The Cs ions coordinated by nitrogen atoms will extend the π conjugated system both in inter-plane and in-plane spaces [37]. They sit in the nitrogen pores and between the layers via coordinating with lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms. The delocalization of the π electrons was further confirmed by the 133Cs MASS-NMR spectrum can greatly improve the charge transfer and mobility, and hence significantly contribute to the decrease in the recombination rate of the charge carriers. Furthermore, GCN-Ns shows a lower PL peak intensity in comparison with both GCN-B and B, CsCN-B, indicating that thermal oxidation in combination with doping is a more effective way than only doping. This is due to the reduced charge diffusion length arising from the porous nanosheets formation that enables more charge carrier movement to the surfaces for the reactions. In addition, the enlarged band gap of the nanosheets induces a quantum confinement effect that in turn promotes charge transfer and prevents recombination of the charge carriers, in comparison with B, CsCN-B. Among all the samples, B, CsCN-Ns exhibits the lowest PL peak intensity, owing to the synergistic effect of doping and thermal exfoliation, and hence the slowest photo charge recombination rate. Based on the VB determination in the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 7 a,b, the VB positions of the nanostructures showed a positive shift as compared to the bulk structures, demonstrating an increased oxidation ability for the photogenerated holes after thermal exfoliation. Fig. 7c shows the electronic band structure of the bulk and nanosheet samples. For both the nanosheets of GCN-Ns and B, CsCN-Ns, the band gap opening resulted from the quantum confinement effect was observed compared to their parent bulk structure. B, CsCN-Ns with a high negative enough CB and mid-state under its CB and the most positive VB potentials besides the highest BET surface area of 74 cm2g−1, which afforded it the highest charge carrier mobility and the lowest recombination rate of all the photo charge carriers. This may imply a higher photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation in both reduction and oxidation reactions for B, CsCN-Ns, as compared to the other samples. The quantitative measurements of the charge-carrier lifetime with time-resolved PL spectroscopy demonstrate the probability of their contribution in photocatalytic reactions before recombination. A longer charge-carrier lifetime usually represents a higher possibility of their participation in the photocatalytic reactions, thus implying a better photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8 shows the PL decay curve superimposed by a bi-exponential fit using Eq. (1): [39,57] (1) P L t = A 1 e - t τ 1 + A 2 e - t τ 2 where τ 1 and τ 2 are the fast and slow lifetimes for the components, and A 1 and A 2 are the scaling factors for the long and short components, respectively. The PL response at the initial time (0 ~ 0.6 ns) after the pulse was excluded because it may be affected by the instrument response function (IRF). The average lifetime ( τ ) of charge carriers was calculated using Eq. (2): [57] (2) τ = A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 The charge-carrier lifetime of each sample is tabulated in Table S3. B, CsCN-Ns exhibited the longest lifetime for both fast components of 1.04 ns (69.55% weight) and a slow component of 4.98 ns (30.45% weight). The longest lifetime for both the short-lived and long-lived carriers indicates that both the doping and the nanostructure formation enhance the charge transfer and mobility and prevent both non-radiative and radiative recombination in the g-C3N4 framework."
11,Photoelectrochemical characterization,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical characterization The improved charge-carrier separation and transfer capability due to the simultaneous co-doping and thermal oxidation (in B, CsCN-Ns sample) were confirmed by the quenched emission peak around 475 nm in the steady-state PL measurement. To gain insight into the bulk and surface charge transfer, transient photocurrent response and PEC impedance measurements were conducted under 150 W xenon lamp illumination equipped with a 400 nm cut-off filter. For transient photocurrent response, a mixed solution of Na2S and Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte to quickly trap the photoinduced holes on the surface of the catalysts. Subsequently, the surface charge recombination was eliminated. Thus, any enhancement in the photocurrent response reflected the improved charge separation efficiency in the bulk of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 9 a, B, CsCN-Ns produces a photocurrent density of 600 μA cm−2, compared to around 450, 200, and 200 μA cm−2 for GCN-Ns, GCN-B, and B, CsCN-B, respectively. B and Cs doping in the bulk structure of g-C3N4 could not enhance the charge separation efficiency because of the extremely stacked layered structure of the bulks, which increased the recombination probability and decreased the surface area. However, the thermal oxidation of the bulk samples effectively improved the charge separation and transfer due to the decreased charge diffusion length, which increased the charge diffusion rate of the carriers from the bulk to the surface of the catalyst and simultaneously decreased the charge recombination opportunity and surface area. Although co-doping was not effective in charge transport in the bulk g-C3N4, as clearly confirmed by the same amount of transient photocurrent response that was obtained for both GCN-B and B, CsCN-B, it can be more effective after thermal oxidation, therefore, B, CsCN-Ns has the highest value, as shown in Fig. 9a. The surface charge transfer efficiency of the as-prepared photoelectrodes was investigated using PEC impedance spectroscopy. The EIS Nyquist plots can be fitted to the equivalent electrical circuit, as shown in Fig. 9b inset. In this circuit, Rs, Rct, CPEct, Rss, and CPEss indicate the FTO/catalyst layer resistance, charge transfer resistance of the catalyst layer, constant phase element of the catalyst layer, charge transfer resistance of the interface/electrolyte, and constant phase element of the interface/electrolyte, respectively. The fitting data of the samples are shown in Table S4. As indicated in Fig. 9b, B,CsCN-Ns exhibits a much smaller semicircle diameter and, therefore, a lower interfacial charge transfer resistance compared with the other samples. This suggests that B, CsCN-Ns has the lowest interfacial charge transfer from the electrode surface to the water molecules during the photo-oxidation process. These results support our postulation that charge transfer can be affected by increasing the intra-plane charge mobility with the help of boron-substituted heptazine units and Cs ions fused in nitrogen pores, also, the in-plane charge separation and transfer can be facilitated via intercalated Cs ions. The intercalation of Cs atoms leads to the formation of charge-delivery tunnels that decrease the electronic localization and thereby extend the π-conjugated system between the layers. Therefore, B, CsCN-Ns not only possesses the highest charge separation ability but can also transfer the charge carriers effectively to the reactant molecules adsorbed on the surface active sites, which explains the highest photocatalytic activity shown by B, Cs CN-Ns in the redox reaction. Mott-Schottky (M−S) analysis was conducted to investigate the charge carrier density and flat band potential position. As shown in Fig. 9d and e, the M−S plots of all prepared photocatalysts depict two linear parts, which reveal the presence of two different capacitive behaviors concerning two regions, the bulk of the electrode and the electrode interface with electrolyte, as depicted in Fig. 9c. The Nyquist plot fitting data further confirmed the presence of two different resistance and capacitance for the as-prepared photoelectrodes. In the case of two junction behavior and the presence of a surface state of Nss, when the Fermi level reaches the bandgap state level, it is discharged. Then a plateau occurs depending on the value of the Helmholtz layer capacitance CH at the electrolyte side of the junction. When the surface state is charged, the Mott–Schottky lines continue. However, the flat band potential is modified according to the extent of unpinning of the Fermi level [79]. Hence, we can conclude that our photoelectrode system for all four samples was made of two capacitors and two resistances. As clearly shown in Fig. 9c, one resistance is related to the charge transport at the electrode surface/electrolyte junction (Rss) and one capacitor is related to the surface state (Css). This circuit is connected in series to transfer charge in the bulk of the electrode (Rctb) and space charge layer capacitor of the semiconductor (Csc). The charge carrier density and flat band potential position can be obtained from the M−S plot using the Mott-Schottky equation, Eq. 3:[79] 1/C2 = 2/ε ε0 A2q ND [(Vi-Vfb)-kbT/q] 3 where Vi is the applied potential, Vfb the flat band potential, ND the dopant density, KB the Boltzmann’s constant, T the temperature, q the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (taken to be 4.6 for g-C3N4), and ε0 the vacuum permittivity. As shown in Fig. 9d and e, the slope of the M−S plots for GCN-B did not show any obvious change after co-doping (for B, CsCN-B) and thermal oxidation (GCN-Ns and B, CsCN-Ns), which indicates that the charge carrier density is the same for all prepared samples. However, the flat band potential of GCN-B and B, CsCN-B can be extrapolated from the capacitive behavior of the bulk (linear region 1 in M−S plot Fig. 9d), with a result of about −0.60 and −0.55 V vs. RHE. After thermal oxidation, the flat band potential was shifted to a more negative potential, which was further proved by the CB determination results of the nanosheets compared to the bulks. The identified flat band potential for the nanosheets was −0.85 V vs. RHE, which shows the much greater negative shifts and more favorable energy state of electrons for reduction reactions. The second linear parts (linear region 2 in Fig. 9d and e) are related to the capacitive behavior of the surface states on the photoelectrodes."
12,Photocatalytic performance and the mechanism,"3.5 Photocatalytic performance and the mechanism To evaluate the photocatalytic reduction ability of the as-prepared catalysts, two different reduction reactions were conducted under visible light irradiation. The first was photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction in 20% triethanolamine solution as a sacrificial agent to capture the photogenerated holes and the second was photocatalytic H2O2 production (the selective two-electron oxygen reduction) in 5% ethanol solution as a sacrificial agent. As depicted in Fig. 10 a, GCN-B exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 145.0 μmolg-1h−1 under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm) because of its lowest surface area (12.6 cm2g−1), deficient light-harvesting, and poor charge transfer capability. Although, after co-doping with B and Cs, the quantity of produced hydrogen slightly increased (164.0 μmolg-1h−1), due to its bulk structure and low surface area (12 cm2g−1) it cannot be integrated via doping only. The nanosheet samples, including GCN-Ns and B, CsCN-Ns, exhibited a higher H2 production rate compared to their parentsʾ bulk. GCN-Ns showed a hydrogen production rate of 495 μmolg-1h−1, and B, CsCN-Ns exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 1120 μmolg-1h−1 The H2O2 production ability of the prepared photocatalysts via the two-electron pathway of the oxygen reduction reaction, in Fig. 10b, exhibited the same trend as that of the H2 production. For H2O2 production from O2 reduction reaction, there is a competition between three different reactions including [80]: O2 + 2H++ 2e- = H2O2 O2 + H+ + 1e- = OOH O2 + 4H++ 4e- = 2H2O Graphitic carbon nitride promotes the selective two-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2. This selective production is related to the efficient formation of 1, 4 endoperoxide species on the melem unit. After light irradiation, the produced electrons are localized at the 1,4 positions of the melem unit and make it suitable for O2 electrophilic attack. O2 adsorption on electron reach carbon position produces superoxide radicals that rapidly are reduced by the next electron on the N site. Protonation of the endoperoxide species will produce H2O2 [11–13,81,82]. The results show that B, CsCN-Ns produces a higher amount of H2O2, 113 μmolg-1h−1, compare to other prepared catalysts of 47, 28, 19 μmolg-1h−1. Fig. 10c and d demonstrated the solar fuel production rate of H2 and H2O2 for the prepared catalysts and the reusability of the B, CsCN-Ns in five representative cycles for both reactions. The improved photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production rate of B, CsCN-Ns comes from two different sources: 1- The higher surface area of this catalyst which provides more active sites for the reactions, 2- The presence of B and Cs in the framework which increases charge carrier separation and transfer and decrease charge recombination which effectively enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide rate, 3- The more negative conduction band in B, CsCN-Ns provide the higher reduction ability for the electrons to participate in the reduction reactions. We expected that the oxidation ability of B, CsCN-Ns to be higher than that of the other samples because of the more positive position of its VB, in addition to its highest porous surface area and lowest recombination rate of charge carriers. To verify this hypothesis, the photocatalytic oxidation ability of different samples was examined by photo-oxidation of 15 mL of RhB 10 ppm under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). The results are shown in Fig. 11 a and b well exhibited that B, CsCN-Ns can completely degrade the molecular structure of RhB at around 45 min with a rate constant of about 9 × 10 - 2 min−1 which is amazingly higher than GCN-Ns and GCN-B, and B, CsCN-B rate constants. Fig. 11d depicted that the B, CsCN-Ns show a reliable photoactivity during five repeated cycles. To determine which reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for RhB degradation, active radical trapping experiments were conducted for two specious including . OH, and . O2 –. For detecting superoxide radical role in RhB degradation, the reaction vessel was purged with N2 gas for 1 h, under dark conditions before photocatalytic reaction. By omitting the oxygen, the photodegradation efficiency of RhB decreased sharply which shows the effective role of superoxide for degradation. Meanwhile, by adding isopropyl alcohol into the reaction medium in another round, we tried to trap produced hydroxyl radicals. Omitting hydroxyl radicals from the reaction medium had a negligible effect on photodegradation efficiency which means that the hydroxyl radicals do not have a critical role in photodegradation reaction, Fig. 11c. Based on these findings, a mechanism was proposed for the photocatalytic reactions on B, CsCN-Ns, Scheme 1 . The porous and high surface area of the 13-nm-thick wrinkled layers of B, CsCN-Ns provide abundant active surface sites for light-harvesting and photo charge carrier generation in the electronic structure. The photogenerated charge carriers can be easily transported from the inside of the catalyst to its surface without significant recombination thanks to the highly delocalized π electrons due to the beneficial roles played by Cs and B and extremely small diffusion length for the charge carriers. When the charge carriers hit the surface, the sufficient negative potential of the electrons (CB = -0.92 V), compared to the H+/H2 and O2/H2O2 redox potentials, enables them to participate in the hydrogen evolution and H2O2 production reactions, whereas the holes on the opposite side are captured by triethanolamine or ethanol in the solution. The positive potential of the holes strengthens them so that they can participate in the oxidation reaction of RhB to completely photodegrade the pollutant. Meanwhile, the superoxide radicals produced by the CB electrons can assist the holes in the photodegradation of RhB. Furthermore, although the B, CsCN-Ns band gap is enlarged compared to that of GCN-B, it remains sufficient to harvest photons in visible light spectrum credits to the mid-gap state presentation between the band gap at around −0.52 eV. In summary, these outstanding photocatalytic properties of B, CsCN-Ns make it a suitable photocatalyst candidate in both reduction and oxidation reactions."
13,Conclusion,"Briefly, a new co-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst, B, CsCN-Ns, was synthesized based on hydrogen-bonded melamine framework precursor followed by calcination and thermal exfoliation. Also, the use of H3BO3 as a boron dopant source formed melamine-boric acid adduct via hydrogen bonds which can change the hydrogen-bonded melamine framework structure. Final thermal etching of B, CsCN-B led to the fabrication of a few-layer wrinkled porous structure with a BET surface area of 74 m2g−1 in B, CsCN-Ns. B as a structural dopant increased the charge carrier transport and mobility in the heptazine units with the help of sharing its vacant pz orbitals in the π-conjugated structure of heptazine units. Also, Cs ions which enter the nitrogen pores and intercalate between the layers, enhance the in-plane and interplane charge mobility and reduced the recombination rate. The intercalated Cs ions acted as electron tunneling agents between the adjacent layers to thereby produce a highly delocalized π electronic system in the vertical direction. The hydrogen evolution rate of B,CsCN-Ns was calculated to be about 1,120 μmolg-1h−1, compared with 145 μmolg-1h−1 for GCN-B in the presence of triethanolamine 20%. Besides, this catalyst showed a high hydrogen peroxide production rate of 113 μmolg-1h−1 compares with 19 μmolg-1h−1 for its bulk one. Furthermore, the prepared catalyst demonstrated a high photooxidation ability toward RhB degradation which is mainly conducted by superoxide radical participation. Thus, this work has provided new insights into the design and engineering of a suitable photocatalyst based on g-C3N4 for improving both photooxidation and photoreduction abilities."
