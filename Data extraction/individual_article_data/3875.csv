0,Introduction,"An increasing concern on global warming and rapid diminution of fossil energy reservoir has intensified the attention to new alternative energy sources. Hydrogen (H2) is a promising energy carrier, having a high energy content of 142 MJ kg−1 [1] which is 3-fold higher or more than that of oil (42 MJ kg−1). Currently, H2 is produced by steam reforming of methane. However, methane is not a desirable source since it is not renewable and its reforming emits CO2. In comparison, microorganisms can produce H2 from biomass and this biological process is carbon-neutral [2]. Among various applications, H2 is expected to be most useful for chemical fuel cells. Fuel cells generate electricity from oxidation of chemicals with high energy conversion efficiency. Although large-scale fuel cells are under development to fulfill static electricity demands in residences and factories, fuel cells are primarily targeted to relatively small-scale, mobile energy generators which are important for transportation vehicles and mobile electronic devices. For mobile applications, biological H2 production system should be compact and readily usable. This requires an efficient biocatalyst and convenient reaction system which provide a high volumetric productivity and stability. Recently, various recombinant Escherichia coli strains have been developed to fulfill these requirements [3–5]. One such strain is E. coli SH5, which has deletion mutations in uptake hydrogenases (ΔhyaAB), lactate dehydrogenase (ΔldhA) and fumarate dehydrogenase (ΔfrdAB). These deletions either prevent the consumption of H2 produced or the diversion of carbons to other pathways which do not give H2 production. In addition, the strain SH5 has deletion for hycA which encodes a negative regulatory protein suppressing the expression of formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). Due to these manipulations, SH5 could produce H2 at a theoretical yield of 1.80–2.11 mol/mol on glucose and with a high rate of ≥50 mmol H2 mg cell−1 h−1 on formate [6]. The use of immobilized microbial systems is well documented for the production of diverse products including antibiotics, enzymes, organic acids and alcohols. The processes with immobilized cells have several advantages over those with free cells, such as re-usability, reduced risk of contamination and operational stability. In addition, in the immobilized systems, high productivity can also be achieved by increasing cell density during immobilization. The application of immobilized cells to H2 production has been reported for different support materials such as agar [7,8], lignocellulosic materials [9], sodium alginate [10], calcium alginate [11]. Recently, Ishikawa et al. reported on the development of compact bioreactor systems with immobilized cell and its use for fuel cell [10,12]. However, the production rate was low as 500–750 ml H2 L−1 h−1 and the operation proceeded only for 4 h. They did not examine the long-term operation of the system through repeated substrate addition. In this study, we report the development and optimization of compact H2 production system which exhibits a high H2 productivity and stability using E. coli SH5 strain. Conditions for cell immobilization such as the kind of immobilization matrix, cell loading and agar concentration were investigated. In addition, the factors affecting H2 production rate including temperature, pH, and substrate concentration were studied in detail. Finally, a sustained H2 production under optimized conditions was attempted."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and culture conditions,2.1 Microorganisms and culture conditions E. coli SH5 was used in this study [6]. The culture was periodically sub-cultured on Luria Bertani (LB) medium and maintained in 70% glycerol at −70 °C.
3,Preparation of immobilized cells using different support materials,"2.2 Preparation of immobilized cells using different support materials E. coli SH5 was grown at 37 °C for 12 h in 1 L capped culture bottles which contained 900 ml of medium (g L−1; tryptone 10, yeast extract 5, NaCl 5, glucose 10; pH 7.0). Afterwards, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min and re-suspended in Bis–Tris buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5). The bacterial suspension was properly diluted to obtain a desired cell density. Support materials such as agar, agarose and calcium alginate were prepared in Bis–Tris buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5) as 3.5% solutions and autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. After cooling to 45 °C, bacterial cell suspension (30 OD at 600 nm, unless stated otherwise) and support materials were mixed thoroughly at the ratio of 1:3. For the preparation of agar and agarose beads, the cell-polymer mixture was dropped into a two-phase liquid solution composed of the top oil phase (liquid paraffin) and bottom aqueous phase (sterile ice-cold distilled water) in an anaerobic chamber (Coy, Model B; Coy Laboratory Products Inc., Grass lake, MI, USA) under a 95% N2 and 5% H2 gaseous atmosphere. The cell-polymer mixture was polymerized and solidified in the oil phase, and the gel beads were collected from the aqueous phase. Afterwards, the gel beads were washed thrice with Bis–Tris buffer to remove the oily phase. For alginate immobilization, instead of two phase mixture, 0.2 M CaCl2 aqueous solutions were used. The bead’s size (2 mm in diameter) was maintained uniformly in all matrixes and the prepared beads were stored as submerged in 4 °C distilled water before use."
4,Batch H2 production using immobilized cell beads,"2.3 Batch H2 production using immobilized cell beads Batch H2 production was carried out in 165 ml serum vial with a working volume of 30 ml. Half the working volume was occupied by cell beads and the other half by sodium formate solution (100 mM) in Bis–Tris buffer (pH 6.5, 100 mM). Vials were sealed using a butyl rubber septum and aluminium cap, and flushed with Ar (99%) for 10 min. While incubating in a reciprocal water bath (37 °C and 150 rpm), gas samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals and checked for H2 production. Liquid samples were also taken periodically and observed under microscope for cell leakage. H2 production rate was measured while varying temperature (25–45 °C), pH (5.5–7.0), cell loading concentration in beads (6–100 OD), sodium formate (50–500 mM) and agar matrix concentration (1.0–4.0%). Unless stated otherwise, the standard conditions were defined as follows: cell concentration in the suspension used for immobilization, 30 OD; sodium formate, 100 mM; agar concentration in the solution used for immobilization, 3.5%; pH, 6.5."
5,Fed-batch experiments using agar immobilized cells,"2.4 Fed-batch experiments using agar immobilized cells Fed-batch experiments were performed using agar immobilized cell beads by supplying sodium formate periodically. Formate was added to be 200 mM every 3 h. Immobilized cell beads were either washed or unwashed before adding formate. In the former case, the cell beads were transferred into a fresh vial and washed two times with 15 ml Bis–Tris buffer (pH 6.5, 100 mM). When opened for washing, the vial was flushed with Ar for 10 min before starting a new run of H2 production. The effect of nutrient addition on the maintenance of H2 production capability of the immobilized cells was also investigated. Three different nutrient solutions such as organic nitrogen sources (0.3% yeast extract and 0.6% tryptone), glucose (20 mM), and both nitrogen sources and glucose, were tested. The nutrient to be tested was supplemented along with formate (200 mM)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Bacterial growth was measured at 600 nm using a double beam spectrophotometer (Lamda 20, Perkin–Elmer, USA). The cell concentration of 1.0 OD was determined by measuring cell dry weight using a pre-determined correlation between OD (1 OD600 = 0.3 g/L DCW of washed cells). Glucose and formate concentrations were determined by an HPLC equipped with an auto sampler and RI and PDA detectors (HPLC, Agilent 1100 series, USA). The culture samples at the appropriate intervals were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 μm Tuffryn-membranes (Acrodisc, Pall Life Sciences). Then the samples were eluted through the column, Aminex HPX-87H; 300 × 7.8 mm (Bio-Rad) at 50 °C using 5.41 mM H2SO4. The flow rate was set at 0.5 ml min−1 and the flow cell temperature was at 35 °C. The analogue output range was set at 0.1 V with positive polarity for RID. H2 and CO2 were quantified using a gas chromatograph (DS 6200; Donam Inst. Inc, Korea) equipped with a TCD detector. Stainless steel columns packed with Molecular Sieve 5A and with Hayesep Q (Alltech Deerfield, IL, USA) were used for quantification of H2 and CO2, respectively. The temperature of the injector, column oven and detector was set at 90, 80 and 120 °C, respectively. Argon was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min−1."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Evaluation of different support materials for cell immobilization and H2 production,"3.1 Evaluation of different support materials for cell immobilization and H2 production Three different matrices, namely agar, agarose and sodium alginate, were tested as immobilizing materials for SH5 cells (Table 1 ). Although prepared by using the same amount of cells and same concentration (w/v) of support materials, some difference in H2 production rates were observed; 716.0 ± 61.4 ml L−1 h−1 (agar), 682.9 ± 42.3 ml L−1 h−1 (agarose) and 676.1 ± 47.3 ml L−1 h−1 (alginate), respectively. H2 production yields were also varied in three matrices and agar showed the highest yield of 100 ± 3.0% which is the theoretical maximum. This suggests that H2 has a low adsorption on agar and is highly permeable through its matrix. Agar and agarose exhibited a mechanical stability and no appreciable breakage of bead or leakage of cells was observed. On the contrary, alginate beads were broken during production of H2. For further experiments, agar was selected as immobilization matrix material."
9,Optimization of H2 production conditions with immobilized cells of E. coli SH5,"3.2 Optimization of H2 production conditions with immobilized cells of E. coli SH5 3.2.1 Temperature and initial medium pH Effect of temperature on H2 production rate was studied between 25 °C and 45 °C at pH 6.5. H2 production rate increased as temperature increased up to 37 °C and the maximum of 716.0 ± 61.4 mL H2 L−1 h−1 was observed at 37 °C (Fig. 1 a). Effect of pH was studied in the range between 5.5 and 7.0 at a fixed temperature of 37 °C. The maximum volumetric H2 production rate was observed at pH 7.0 as 771.0 ± 36.5 mL H2 L−1 h−1 (Fig. 1b). The pH dependence is generally consistent with the previous reports that E. coli shows a maximum H2 production rate at a slightly acidic pH [13,14]. However, it should be pointed out that the immobilized system is less sensitive to the change of temperature and pH than free cells. Similar observation was reported by Yokoi et al. for immobilized Enterobacter aerogenes [16]. For further studies, pH 6.5 and 37 °C were selected. 3.2.2 Cell load The effect of cell load in immobilized bead on H2 production rate was studied in the range between 6 OD and 100 OD (Fig. 2 ). The H2 production rate increased as cell concentration increases. However, above 100 OD, no further increase in H2 production rate was observed. This suggests that substrate transfer through the bead is rate-limiting (data not shown). When cell OD was above 100, the viscosity of bead preparation solution became high and bead preparation was technically difficult. Furthermore, the beads prepared with high cell load above 100 OD were mechanically unstable during H2 production and their breakage was observed. For the following studies, 100 OD was employed for bead preparation. 3.2.3 Sodium formate concentration Effect of formate concentration on H2 production rate was studied in the range between 50 mM and 500 mM (Fig. 3 ). H2 production rate increased almost linearly as formate concentration increased from 50 mM to 350 mM and levelled off above 350 mM. Highest volumetric productivity was observed at above 350 mM as 2400 mL H2 L−1 h−1. In free cells, formate above 50 mM is known to be inhibitory to H2 production [15]. In comparison, the immobilized system in this study was less sensitive to high formate concentration and this is attributed to the lowered formate concentration inside the bead due to mass transfer resistance through the agar matrix. Although H2 production rate was high above 350 mM formate, the yield of H2 on added formate was decreased below 80%. It is attributable to the increase of pH in the liquid medium as Na+ accumulates and actually, pH variation was observed at 6 h according to the formate concentration; 7.4 ± 0.2 (50 mM formate), 7.8 ± 0.2 (100 mM formate), 8.2 ± 0.2 (200 mM formate), 8.5 ± 0.2 (350 mM formate), 8.6 ± 0.2 (500 mM formate). The following experiments were conducted with 200 mM formate. 3.2.4 Agar concentration The concentration of agar determines the porosity, stability, and permeability of gel beads. The effect of agar concentrations on H2 production and bead stability was studied using the different agar concentrations in the range of 0.5%–3.5% (data not shown). When agar concentration was below 2%, especially when less than 1%, beads breakage was significant. At agar concentrations between 2% and 3.5%, no cell breakage was observed and, furthermore, volumetric H2 productivity was almost constant as 1500 mL H2 L−1 h−1. In addition, H2 production yield was also constant in that range as 1.0 mol H2/mol formate. This indicates that, at agar concentrations between 2% and 3.5%, substrate and products are easily transferred through the bead. Since the mechanical stability of the beads increased as agar concentration increased, agar concentration of 3.5% was employed for further studies."
10,Repeated use of immobilized cells for H2 production with or without cell washing,"3.3 Repeated use of immobilized cells for H2 production with or without cell washing The stability and re-usability of agar immobilized cells for H2 production were studied by periodically replenishing sodium formate (Fig. 4 ). The beads were either washed or not washed before adding formate. When the immobilized cell beads were not washed, H2 production rate and yield decreased progressively and significantly as formate addition was repeated. Compared to the first run, H2 production yield decreased by 39% and 71% in the second and third runs, respectively. In comparison, when the immobilized cell beads were washed before adding new formate, the decrease of H2 production was much less significant. For the latter case, the second run showed 25% decrease compared to the first run and the third run did not show any further decrease compared to the second run. The pH of the liquid medium increased to 8.3 when the first run is completed due to the accumulation of Na+. The increase of pH is assumed as one of the major reasons to reduce H2 production in unwashed runs."
11,Effect of addition of nutrients and glucose on H2 production by immobilized cells,"3.4 Effect of addition of nutrients and glucose on H2 production by immobilized cells For practical application, washing of immobilized cells is not desirable. In order to study the possibility of a sustained H2 production rate without cell washing, effect of nutrient addition on the maintenance of H2 production activity was investigated. Nitrogen sources (yeast extract and tryptone) as well as glucose were examined (Fig. 5 ). Addition of nitrogen sources improved the H2 production in the second and third runs, but the effect was only marginal. On the other hand, glucose addition showed a significant improvement over the control (no nutrient added) or the one supplemented with nitrogen sources. When nitrogen sources were additionally supplemented along with glucose, some more improvement was observed but the difference was only marginal. Glucose effect seems to be multiple. First of all, glucose can produce ATP during its hydrolysis and the ATP can contribute to the maintenance of cell viability and the enzyme activity for H2 production. Second, glucose alleviated the pH change of the reaction medium to a certain extent. At the end of the first run, medium pH increased from 6.5 to 8.3 in the control culture or nitrogen sources added cultures. In comparison, in the glucose-added experiment, the medium pH at the end of the first run was 7.9. The lower pH is attributed to the production of various acids by anaerobic metabolism of glucose. Since the pH change in the liquid medium is significant, its effect on H2 production was further studied by adjusting the medium pH to the range of 6.0–7.0 using 4 N HCl at the end of each run (Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 shows that, by pH control and glucose supplementation, the stability of immobilized cells has been greatly improved. Volumetric production rates (1641.5 ± 725.3 mL H2 L−1 h−1 at 20 min) even increased slightly as the runs progressed. These results along with Fig. 5 indicate that ATP and medium pH are the most important factors for sustained H2 production in immobilized E. coli cells from formate."
12,Conclusion,"We have developed H2 production system using agar immobilized cell beads. Through optimization of bead preparation method and H2 production conditions, a high volumetric H2 production rate of 2400 mL H2 L−1 h−1 could be obtained. Furthermore, using a recombinant H2 producing E. coli strain SH5 and supplying formate as substrate also allowed a high H2 production rate. The stability of immobilized cells was largely dependent on intracellular ATP regeneration and the reaction medium pH. By glucose addition and pH control, H2 production activity could be maintained stably for 10 h while producing H2 from sodium formate which was repeatedly added."
