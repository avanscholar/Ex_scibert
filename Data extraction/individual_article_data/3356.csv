0,Introduction,"Photocatalysts could convert solar energy into chemical energy by producing hydrogen from hydrogen-containing compounds including water in particular [1–7]. Thus hydrogen production by use of semiconductor photocatalysts has recently received much attention. Still, not many semiconductors are known that could produce hydrogen from water under visible light. Instead of using a single semiconductor, coupling of semiconductors with other semiconductors, metals, and molecules forming a junction structure has been found to enhance the performance of photocatalysts by a synergistic effect such as an efficient charge separation and improvement of photostability [8–16]. As new configurations of such junction structure, we already reported CdS(bulk)/TiO2 nano-bulk composite (NBC) photocatalysts [17–19], photocatalytic nanodiode consisting of p-type CaFe2O4 and n-type PbBi2Nb1.9W0.1O9 [14] and p–n diode type nanocomposite photocatalyst with Ohmic junction WO3/W/PbBi2Nb1.9Ti0.1O9 [14]. These configurations of the heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited very high activity for hydrogen production from water under visible light (λ ⩾420nm) in the presence of a hole scavenger. In the present work, we report a new nano-bulk composite type heterojunction photocatalyst, TiO2/AgGaS2, that comprises of random multilayers of TiO2 nanoparticles decorating highly crystalline AgGaS2. AgGaS2 is a p-type I–III–VI ternary semiconductor that crystallizes in a chalcopyrite structure [20]. It has a direct band gap of ca. 2.68eV, a highly desirable energy range for solar cells and photocatalyst applications. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report about fabrication of a composite photocatalyst consisting of chalcopyrite material (AgGaS2) as p-type semiconductor and n-type TiO2 nanoparticles. Its structure and photocatalytic activity are discussed in hydrogen production from electrolyte solution containing sulfide and sulfite as sacrificial reagents under visible right irradiation (λ ⩾420nm)."
1,Experimental,"AgGaS2(AGS) was prepared by the conventional solid state reaction [20]. Thus, a stoichiometric mixture of Ag2S (Aldrich 99.9%) and Ga2S3 (10% excess, Aldrich 99.99%) was calcined at 1073K for 5h under N2 flow, followed by a post heat-treatment at 1123K for 3h with a 40% H2S/He mixture gas flow (35μmols−1) to remove the anionic defects. To fabricate TiO2/AgGaS2 heterojunction photocatalysts of NBC structure, bulky AgGaS2 calcined at 1073K for 1h under He flow was stirred in isopropyl alcohol and tetra-titanium isopropoxide in a TiO2/AgGaS2 mole ratio of 0–2 and H2O was added drop-by-drop for hydrolysis. The prepared composite powder was dried and hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 423K for 1day to increase the crystallinity of TiO2 in TiO2/AgGaS2 heterojunction photocatalysts. The crystalline phases of the products were determined by X-ray diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical properties were analyzed by UV–VIS diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). Morphologies of photocatalysts were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4200) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, Field Emission Electron Microscope) instrument operated at 200kV. The BET surface area was evaluated by N2 adsorption in a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Micrometrics, ASAP 2012). The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure in a closed circulation system using a Hg-arc lamp (450W) equipped with a UV cut off filter (λ ⩾420nm). Before reaction, 1wt% of Pt was deposited on photocatalysts by photodeposition method under visible light (λ ⩾420nm). The rate of H2 evolution was determined in an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3. Without these hole scavengers, the photocatalyst is unstable by attack of holes. The evolved amounts of H2 were analyzed by a gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier)."
2,Results and discussion,"In our previous works [12,17–19,21], we have demonstrated that the NBC structure is particularly useful configuration to form a heterojunction structure. Here, nanoparticles of a semiconductor interface with highly crystalline bulky particles of the other semiconductor. We have demonstrated that the NBC structure is most efficient when the visible light absorbing semiconductor is highly crystalline bulk type material, whereas the other semiconductor is in the form of nanoparticles to maximize the interfacial area between two-types of semiconductors [18]. Thus, we chose a configuration consisting of bulky AgGaS2 with high crystallinity decorated with nanosized TiO2 particles. Based on this concept, we fabricated a heterojunction of bulk AgGaS2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by using solid state reaction followed by sol–gel process. Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of TiO2, TiO2/AgGaS2 and AgGaS2. The AgGaS2 sample showed well-developed tetragonal phase without any impurity with unit cell constants of a =5.765Å and c =10.281Å (space group I42d) in agreement with the reported values [20]. TiO2 was in anatase phase for both single and the junction material. When the mole ratio of TiO2 to AgGaS2 increased, the intensity of anatase (100) peak of TiO2 became higher. But the crystallinity of TiO2 in TiO2/AgGaS2 heterojunction was lower than that of the single component TiO2 nanoparticle even considering its lowered mass density in the composite material. The morphologies of TiO2/AgGaS2 composite photocatalyst were observed by SEM and TEM images as shown in Fig. 2 . The bulky AgGaS2 particles of an irregular shape exhibited smooth surface and size of ca. 2–3μm. The BET surface area by N2 physisorption was ca. 1m2/g. All data represent a high crystallinity of bulk AgGaS2 particles. In contrast, TiO2 particles were ca. 10nm in size and had the high BET surface area of 191m2/g. In TiO2/AgGaS2 heterojunction particles, the morphology of two semiconductors was maintained. Thus clearly defined geometry of nanoparticles dispersed in contact with a large bulk particle could be seen in Fig. 2b and c and is depicted in the inset. Note that TiO2 particles formed random multiple particle layers on the surface of bulk AgGaS2 as reported in our previous works [17–19]. The UV-diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra for these materials are shown in Fig. 3 . The bulky AgGaS2 photocatalyst showed a sharp edge at 490nm, while that of TiO2 was observed at 390nm. These edge positions are consistent with the band gap energies of AgGaS2 (2.68eV) and anatase TiO2 (3.2eV). The spectrum of the TiO2/AgGaS2 composite photocatalyst showed a combination of these two spectra like that of a physically mixed sample [17–19]. Thus, it is evident that two semiconductors are physically combined in the TiO2/AgGaS2 composite photocatalyst. When the molar concentration of TiO2 in TiO2/AgGaS2 composite increased, the intensity of the absorbance spectra coming from AgGaS2 decreased as expected. The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure in a closed circulation system using a Hg-arc lamp (450W) equipped with a UV cut off filter (λ ⩾420nm). Before reaction, 1wt% of Pt was deposited as a co-catalyst on photocatalysts by photodeposition method under visible light [17–19]. The Pt co-catalyst provides sites for electron collection and hydrogen production from water over semiconductor photocatalysts, and is indispensible for high photocatalytic activity. The rate of H2 evolution was determined by measuring concentrations of H2 by a gas chromatography, generated from an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3. Fig. 4 shows time courses of H2 evolution for about 3h, which represent linear increase of the evolved H2 with the reaction time. Although the reaction time was not long enough to test the long term catalyst stability, there was no sign of activity deterioration under the present photocatalytic reaction test in the presence of hole scavengers. The average rates of hydrogen evolution during the period are also indicated in Fig. 4. As expected, TiO2 alone did not show any visible light activity. The heterojunction photocatalyst TiO2/AgGaS2 (1:2) showed higher photocatalytic activity (by a factor of ca. 1.4) than that of single AgGaS2 photocatalyst of the similar physical properties. The difference would have been greater if the comparison was made for the same mass of the active AgGaS2 phase only. However, for too high a coverage of TiO2 nanoparticle like the case of TiO2/AgGaS2 (2:1) decreased the activity, probably because TiO2 hinders the contact of electrolyte and AgGaS2 surface responsible for hole reaction. Thus an optimum content of nanosized TiO2 particles decorating bulky AgGaS2 exists that brings the highest rate of hydrogen production. The rates observed for AgGaS2 and TiO2/AgGaS2 (1:2) photocatalysts, both loaded with 1wt% Pt, represent ca. 12.4 and 17.5% of the quantum yields (100×the number of hydrogen atoms produced/number of irradiated photons) at λ ⩾420nm, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates from sulfide-based photocatalysts reported in the literature. From this table, we could confirm that our catalyst represents high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production under visible light (λ ⩾420nm). The working principle of the TiO2/AgGaS2 heterojunction photocatalyst is depicted in the inset of Fig. 4. Upon light absorption at AgGaS2, excitons (or electron–hole pairs) are generated, diffuse to the p–n interface, and dissociates into free carriers. There, electrons and holes diffuse in opposite directions [9,22]. Thus, difference in the conduction band position drives electrons toward surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles, where hydrogen evolution takes place with assistance of Pt co-catalyst. The holes remain in AgGaS2 and react with hole scavengers of Na2S/Na2SO3 in electrolyte. This is an extra exciton dissociation mechanism in addition to the depletion layer for the single semiconductors dispersed in solution. The higher probability of exciton dissociation would lead to reduced electron–hole recombination and enhanced photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction photocatalyst. Based on the presented results, it can be concluded that the proposed fabrication of heterojunction system consisting of chalcopyrite structure, AgGaS2 and TiO2 nanoparticles can be a successful and generic strategy to develop highly active photocatalysts under visible light."
3,Conclusions,"A new heterojunction photocatalyst TiO2/AgGaS2 based on highly crystalline AgGaS2 decorated with TiO2 nano-particles was fabricated by solid state reaction and sol–gel synthesis. This NBC structure results in an efficient charge separation, caused by facile dissociation of electron–hole pairs at the interface. Thus, photoelectrons generated from bulky AgGaS2 diffuse toward surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles. The efficient charge separation leads to reduced electron–hole recombination and enhanced photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production. An optimum content of TiO2 particles in the TiO2/AgGaS2 composite exists that induces the highest rate of hydrogen production under visible light (λ ⩾420nm) irradiation from water containing sulfide and sulfite ions as hole scavengers."
