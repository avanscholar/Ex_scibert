0,Introduction,"The warming of our planet has been closely linked to the anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.[1] To prevent further increase of Earth’s temperature, substitution of fossil fuel based energy with that of generated from renewable resources, such as solar,[2–3] wind[4–5] and biomass,[6–7] has been considered essential. However, the effectiveness of these alternative energy resources in the fight against climate change has not been without controversy.[8] In the case of biofuels in particular, there has been an ongoing debate about how environmentally friendly they are in reality.[9] For instance, some studies suggest that production of biofuels consume more energy than they produce.[10–11] One of the major factors contributing to the cost of biofuel production is the dehydration of bioalcohols. This process has traditionally employed distillation, which requires large amounts of energy to achieve sufficient purity for alcohol to be used as fuel. Furthermore, ethanol, for instance, makes an azeotrope with water. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain more than 95 wt% purity ethanol with distillation only. Such difficulties have led to the development of alternative methods for dehydration of bioalcohols, such as, extractive distillation, adsorption and membrane separation, as well as, hybrid methods which incorporate membrane separation and distillation.[12–14] Membrane pervaporation has been considered as one of the most effective and energy-saving processes for separation of alcohol-water mixtures, in particular, for the azeotropic ones.[15–17] Hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes have been developed for the separation of alcohol and water,[12] although making reliable and economical membranes is challenging.[18] For the fabrication of hydrophobic pervaporation membranes, MFI, a hydrophobic zeolite, has been widely used, either in the form of a thin film membrane deposited on a porous support,[19–20] or by dispersing MFI crystals in a polymer matrix,[21–22] exhibiting high flux and separation factors. Furthermore, several molecular simulation studies investigated the adsorption, diffusion and separation of alcohol and water systems in MFI zeolite.[23–27] By carrying out configurational bias grand canonical Monte Carlo (CB-GCMC) simulations Xiong et al.[23] reported that the adsorption of water in MFI is negligible due to its hydrophobicity and that larger alcohols are adsorbed at relatively lower pressures compared to the smaller alcohols. Krishna et al.[24] employed CB-GCMC and molecular dynamics (MD) methods to show that it is not possible to accurately estimate adsorption and diffusion characteristics of alcohol-water mixture based on single component data due to the effect of hydrogen bonding between water and alcohol molecules. Gómez-Álvarez et al.[25] performed GCMC and MD simulations in MFI and showed that the diffusion coefficients of water, methanol and ethanol in the adsorbed alcohol-water mixtures were greater than their diffusion coefficients in the adsorbed single component. Studies cited in references 23 to 25 were conducted in periodic MFI structures and as such were not representative of pervaporative membrane separation experiments. Working with periodic structures also meant that these studies did not consider the effect of functional groups; i.e. silanol groups, that are present on the external surface on the separation of alcohol-water mixtures, which can be an important factor as we show later in this paper. Jia et al.,[26] on the other hand, carried out MD simulations to study the diffusion of alcohol-water mixtures through MFI slabs in a simulation setup that mimicked pervaporation separation experiments. They emphasized that the behaviour of mixtures differed considerably from that of for the single component systems. For example, they reported that water diffused through the MFI membrane when it was in a mixture with ethanol but not in the single component phase, which they attributed to the strong hydration energy of ethanol; however, they did not elaborate on the origins of this effect at the molecular level. Furthermore; the MFI model they used did not have any partial atomic charges; i.e. the interaction between the MFI and alcohol and water molecules were purely based on van der Waals forces, and that there were no silanol groups on the external surface of the MFI slabs they used, which are both important for an accurate modelling of the system. Additionally, the method they used did not allow computing the steady-state fluxes. Takaba et al.,[27] investigated the pervaporation of an ethanol/water binary mixture in silicalite membrane with dual ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. However, they modelled the ethanol and water molecules as Lennard-Jones fluids, i.e. single spheres, which is a very crude approximation that prevents exploring the role of specific interactions on the separation mechanism. In this work, we investigate the dehydration of bioalcohols in an MFI membrane by carrying out concentration gradient driven molecular dynamics simulations (CGD-MD).[28] CGD-MD is a non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation method which works by applying bidirectional bias forces to maintain the concentration of molecules in designated control volumes. By maintaining a higher concentration at the inlet of a membrane (feed), and lower concentration at the outlet of a membrane (permeate) the CGD-MD method creates a concentration gradient which drives the diffusion of molecules through the membrane. This method was previously used to study multicomponent gas transport and separation in porous membranes.[28–30] Using the CGD-MD approach allows computing the steady-state flux of molecules and membrane selectivity directly, which is important, because some of us previously showed that at conditions where fluid molecules strongly associate, selectivity of a membrane may not always be computed accurately based on predictions of single component transport properties.[29] Here, we consider the separation of methanol and ethanol from water in an MFI pervaporation membrane setting; i.e., vacuum on the permeate side. The simulations are carried out in the liquid phase and at ambient conditions, and thus useful to understand the potential of porous membranes for the dehydration of bioalcohols with minimum energy consumption; i.e. without heating of the feed. Most importantly, our study reveals that water molecules prefers forming hydrogen bonds with alcohol molecules over the silanol groups that exist on the external surfaces of the MFI membrane. This leads to a diminishing effect on the alcohol-water selectivity and lower than expected alcohol fluxes."
1,Methods,"Methanol and ethanol molecules were modelled with the TraPPE-UA force field.[31] In this force field, bonds are rigid but angles are flexible, and CHx groups are treated as united atoms, i.e., single interaction centres. For the water molecule, a flexible variant of the SPC/E model was used.[32–33] An MFI membrane was constructed by using the “Computation-ready 2D Zeolitic Slabs Database” of Knio et al.[34] This database consists of DFT optimized unit cells of zeolites and their model surfaces for different crystallographic planes terminated with –OH groups. The dimensions of the MFI membrane used in our simulations were 60.49, 53.17 and 110.83 Å in the ×, y and z direction, respectively, and the external surfaces were perpendicular to the straight channels [010]. The membrane was treated as a flexible structure using the force field developed by Sastre et al.[35–37] Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules were used to calculate the cross term parameters between different atom types for Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, which was used to model short range non-bonded interactions. Long range electrostatic interactions were computed using the Ewald summation method.[38] The cut-off distance for the LJ potential and the real part of the Ewald sum was set to 12 Å. Further details on the force field used and all parameters are provided in Table S1. As mentioned in the introduction, we used the CGD-MD method to study the liquid phase transport of water, methanol and ethanol, and the separation of equimolar methanol–water and ethanol–water mixtures. The CGD-MD simulation setup is illustrated in Fig. 1 and CGD-MD specific parameters are provided in Table S2. A detailed explanation of how CGD-MD method works can be found in Ozcan et al.[28] and Perego et al.[39] In our CGD-MD simulations, the MFI membrane was placed in the centre of the simulation box, which was 311.0 Å ​in the z direction (Fig. 1). During the CGD-MD simulations, the concentration of the water, methanol and ethanol molecules were maintained at their target densities in the feed control region (FCR) and the permeate control region (PCR), to mimic a pervaporation membrane separation setup; i.e. higher concentration in FCR (feed) and vacuum in PCR (permeate). This is achieved by applying bi-directional bias forces on fluid molecules in the feed force region (FFR) and the permeate force region (PFR). The bias force works in such a way that if the instantaneous concentration in the control region is less than the target concentration then the bias force acts in the direction to move more molecules to the control region; and if the instantaneous concentration in the control region is more than the target concentration then the bias force acts in the direction to remove molecules from the control region. We emphasize that it is the concentration gradient that is established across the membrane which facilitates the transport of the molecules, not the bias forces. Molecules which cross the membrane return to the feed side through the periodic boundary (see blue arrows in Fig. 1). This ensures that there are always molecules in the feed side and that the transport of the molecules through the membrane can reach to steady state. All CGD-MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs MD simulation package (version 2019.2) patched with an in-house modified version of Plumed 2.4.2. The patch is freely available for download.[40] Simulations were run in the NVT ensemble and the temperature was kept at 300 K using a Nose-Hoover thermostat. Leapfrog algorithm[38] was used for integrating the Newton’s equations of motion with a timestep of 1 fs. A small number of Si atoms (less than 2%) were restrained to their initial positions in order to avoid the MFI membrane drifting under the concentration gradient. To ensure that the flux of the molecules through the MFI membrane has achieved steady state, CGD-MD simulations were first run for 200 million steps, followed by 200 million steps of productions runs, during which fluxes, z-density profiles and hydrogen bonding characteristics of water, methanol and ethanol were calculated in single component and mixture settings."
2,Results & discussion,
3,Force field validation,"3.1 Force field validation We first validated the force field by computing the adsorption isotherms of methanol, ethanol and water in MFI and comparing them against experimental data. For this purpose, we performed grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation using the RASPA molecular simulation package.[41] Further details of the GCMC simulations are provided in the SI. Fig. 2 shows the comparison between simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms of methanol, ethanol and water in MFI.[23,42] The agreement between the simulated and experimental data is good. In particular, simulated isotherms reproduced the fact that methanol and ethanol are adsorbed at a lower pressure compared to water. It should further be noted that the experimental data for water adsorbed in MFI within the pressure range shown in Fig. 2 is very sensitive to the sample quality and the amount of water adsorbed is much lower compared to the amount of water that condenses in the pores of all-silica MFI at very high pressures, i.e. greater than 75 MPa.[43–44]"
4,"Single component permeation of methanol, ethanol and water in the MFI membrane","After validating the force field, we studied the single component permeation of methanol, ethanol and water in the MFI membrane by carrying out CGD-MD simulations. Target concentrations of methanol, ethanol and water in the feed control region were set to their liquid molar densities at 300 K. in the permeate control region, the target concentrations were set to vacuum to mimic pervaporation conditions (Table S3). Instantaneous concentrations (Figure S1) and the average concentrations of methanol, ethanol and water (Table S3) in the control regions in single component simulations show that the concentration of the molecules were maintained very close to the target values during the production runs. Fig. 3 shows the z-density profiles of methanol, ethanol and water in the MFI membrane. While both methanol and ethanol enter the MFI membrane, water does not enter because of the hydrophobicity of the MFI zeolite. The z-density profiles of methanol and ethanol reflect the structure of MFI, i.e., the z-densities peak at the intersection of the zig-zag and straight channels. The fluxes of methanol, ethanol and water in the MFI membrane were calculated by using the following formula[28] J z = N i + - N i - t A xy where J z is the flux in the direction of the flow, N + and N - are the number of molecules that cross a geometric plane located at the centre of the membrane in the positive and negative z-directions, respectively, A x y is the cross sectional area of the membrane, and t is the simulation time. In the single component simulations, methanol flux is about twice that of ethanol, and water has a zero flux (Table 1 ) since it does not enter the MFI membrane, which is in agreement with the experimental findings that water only enters all-silica MFI at very high pressures.[43–44] This may suggest that MFI can demonstrate complete selectivity for methanol and ethanol over water; however, as we show in the mixture simulations below this is not the case."
5,Dehydration of binary alcohol-water mixtures in the MFI membrane,"To study the dehydration of binary alcohol-water mixtures in the MFI membrane, we considered equimolar mixtures of methanol–water and ethanol–water. For both mixtures, target concentrations of the components in feed control region were set to reproduce the molar density of equimolar mixtures at 300 K assuming ideal mixing, and the target concentrations were set to zero in the permeate control region to mimic pervaporation conditions (Table S4). Instantaneous concentrations (Figure S2) and the average concentrations of methanol, ethanol and water (Table S4) in the control regions in mixture simulations show that the concentration of the molecules were maintained very close to the target values during the production runs. Fig. 4 shows the z-density profiles of methanol, ethanol and water in the MFI membrane in the mixture simulations. Unlike the case in the single component simulation of water, the density of water within the membrane, although very small, is non-zero in both mixture simulations. That is, water enters the membrane when it is in a mixture with methanol or ethanol. Indeed, there is a quantifiable water flux in MFI in the mixture simulations, although it is very small compared to the fluxes of methanol and ethanol (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of water appears to be slowing down the permeation of methanol and ethanol in alcohol-water mixtures (Table 1). One can argue that the slower fluxes of methanol and ethanol in alcohol-water mixtures compared to their fluxes in the single component simulations is due to their relatively lower feed concentrations in the mixture simulation compared to their feed concentrations in the single component simulations. However, the lower feed concentrations of alcohols in the mixture simulations do not alone account for the slower fluxes of methanol and ethanol in the mixture simulations. For instance, the feed concentration of methanol in the mixture simulations is about 45% lower than that of its feed concentration in the single component simulation; i.e. 10.43 vs 14.99 [molecules/nm3], respectively (Tables S3 and S4). The flux of methanol in the mixture simulation is about an order of magnitude smaller than its single component flux (Table 1). Likewise, the flux of ethanol in the mixture is three times smaller than its single component flux (Table 1), but the ethanol feed concentration in the mixture simulation is only ≈30% lower than that of in the single component; i.e. 7.92 vs 10.16 [molecules/nm3], respectively (Tables S3 and S4). To understand why water enters the MFI membrane in the alcohol-water mixture simulations but not in the single component water simulation, we analysed the number of hydrogen bonds that form between the silanol groups located on the feed side of the MFI surface and the methanol, ethanol and water molecules (Table 2 ). In single component simulations, water molecules form about five times more hydrogen bonds with the surface silanol groups compared to methanol and ethanol. This may be due to two reasons; first, water has two OH groups whereas methanol and ethanol has only one, and second, the molecular density of water is larger compared to methanol and ethanol, that is, there are relatively more water molecules present per unit volume in comparison to methanol and ethanol. However, in the mixture simulations there is a very different scenario. The number of hydrogen bonds that methanol or ethanol form with the silanol groups are more than the number of hydrogen bonds that form between the water molecules and silanol groups. The number of hydrogen bonds that water forms with silanol groups when it is in a mixture with methanol is about 10 times smaller compared to that of in the single component simulation, and it is 14 times smaller when it is in a mixture with ethanol. This cannot be explained only by the lower concentration of water in the mixture simulations (10.39 and 7.88 molecules/nm3 for methanol and ethanol mixtures, respectively (Table S4)), compared to its concentration in the single component simulation, (33.7 molecules/nm3 (Table S3)). It is clear that, water molecules interact more strongly with the alcohol molecules; i.e. through hydrogen bonding, compared to the surface silanols. This in turn facilitates the diffusion of water in the MFI membrane, because thanks to the hydrogen bonding that forms between the water and alcohol molecules, water molecules are carried in to the MFI with the diffusing methanol and ethanol molecules. The preferred hydrogen bonding of water with alcohol molecules also explains the lower than expected fluxes of methanol and ethanol in their mixtures with water. While water enters MFI thanks to the hydrogen bonds that it forms with alcohol molecules, it slows down the permeation of methanol and ethanol. It is also noteworthy that the hydrogen bonding is relatively weaker between alcohol molecules in the membrane compared to the feed (see Table S5 and the pertinent discussion in the ESI).[45] The reason for the preference of water molecules for making hydrogen bonding with alcohols rather than with surface silanols can be due to the difference in the polarity of –OH groups in the silanol groups and those of in the methanol and ethanol molecules. Partial charges of oxygen atoms in the ––OH groups of alcohol and the silanol are very similar (i.e., q O alc = - 0.7 e and q O sil = - 0.725 e ). However, the partial charge of the hydrogen atom of the –OH group of alcohol is more than twice that of for the hydrogen atom of the –OH group of the silanol (i.e.; q H alc = 0.435 e and q H sil = 0.2 e , respectively). The larger hydrogen partial charge on the alcohol –OH group leads to a stronger interaction with water compared to the interaction between the silanol group and water. This suggest that even if defect free membranes can be manufactured, the hydrogen bonding between water and alcohol molecules will always result in diffusion of water molecules along with alcohols, thus eliminating the possibility of complete dehydration of biofuels. Nevertheless, the ethanol/water selectivity based on the ethanol and water fluxes from the ethanol–water mixture simulation, i.e. 0.03/0.0005 = 60, can still be considered very high."
6,Conclusions,"The purification of bioalcohols using pervaporation membranes based on hydrophobic zeolites potentially has several advantages in comparison to distillation, including and most importantly, lower energy requirements. All silica MFI zeolite allows the diffusion of pure methanol and ethanol and prevents the diffusion of pure water due to its hydrophobic character. Pure water hydrogen bonds strongly with the silanol groups on the external surface of the MFI. On the other hand, when water is in a mixture with alcohol, the hydrogen bonding of water with silanol groups reduces due to its preferred hydrogen bonding with alcohols and this leads to water permeating through the MFI membrane along with alcohol molecules. The strong hydrogen bonding between water and alcohol molecules may suggest that total selectivity of alcohol over water in a hydrophobic pervaporation membrane, such as MFI, cannot be achieved. However, our findings also hint at the possibility of modifying surfaces with functional groups that will overcome the interaction between water and alcohol molecules and retain water outside the membrane as a new strategy for manufacturing membranes with improved separation performance for the dehydration of bioalcohols."
