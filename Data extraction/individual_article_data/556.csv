0,Introduction,"In recent years, carbon neutrality is proposed to promote using renewable energy and materials due to the serious white pollution brought by the ubiquitously used non-biodegradable plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polystyrene. With the improvement of environmental protection awareness, the sustainable resources, especially environmental-friendly materials have aroused wide attention. Substituting the existing plastics by bioderived or biodegradable materials with comparable performance is considered as the most useful and promising method to keep the balance between carbon emission and absorption [1,2]. Many scientific research works are directed towards renewable and biodegradable composites to develop bio-based products as alternatives to non-biodegradable materials [3,4]. Corn starch (CS) is one of the most potential natural polymers with a wide range of sources, inherent biodegradability, low cost and annual renewability, which is considered to be a promising substitute for some traditional petroleum polymers. Due to the low cost of CS raw materials and the feasibility of thermoplastic processing with traditional plastic processing equipment, it is very attractive to use CS for the development of new biodegradable materials with universal applicability and good industrial application prospects. Hence, CS is usually blended with other biodegradable materials, such as poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (butylene succinate) (PBS), poly (butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) to prepare low cost and eco-friendly composites with comparable properties [5–8]. However, with the incorporation of CS, the mechanical properties of composites deteriorate dramatically. For example, the tensile strength of PVA/CS composites decreased rapidly with the increase of thermoplastic starch content [9]. Although many efforts have been made in processing of starch composites, it remains a great challenge to develop biodegradable plastic/starch composites with higher mechanical strength. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is considered as an important synthetic polymer with outstanding oil resistance, solvent resistance and gas barrier properties, which exhibits unique advantages in bionic skin, energy harvesting, food and pharmaceutical packaging [10–12]. More importantly, PVA has biodegradability in the composting conditions with the presence of suitable microorganisms [13,14]. Tsujiyama's work reported that PVA could be degraded by the white-rot fungus (Fomitopsis pinicola) [15]. Bian's work reported that PVA could be degraded by using cross-linked enzyme aggregates of degrading enzymes from Bacillus niacini [16]. However, the melt-processing of PVA is a great challenge since the high degree of crystallinity as well as intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds derived from the multi-hydroxyl structure of PVA, making the melting temperature (Tm) extremely close to its decomposition temperature (Td) [17]. Consequently, it is often accompanied with decomposition of PVA during the heating process, which makes it difficult to be processed into three-dimensional (3D) products. Traditional solution processed industrial fabrication of PVA products is limited to producing low-dimensional PVA products such as PVA films or fibers, which greatly limits the further application and development of PVA. Herein, we have prepared PVA/CS composites through melt-processing with significantly improved mechanical properties by incorporating cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as reinforcing fillers, in which formamide/water was used as plasticizer. CNFs are usually incorporated into other biodegradable materials such as PLA, PBS and PBAT to improve their mechanical properties [18–20]. In this work, a large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of CS may interact with the hydroxyl groups of PVA to form hydrogen bonds and alter hydrogen bond regularity of PVA molecular chains, which can confine the crystallization of PVA [21,22]. Besides, CNFs are capable of integrating the above two materials through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and forming strong interfacial combination for composites reinforcement [23–25]. The resultant biodegradable nanocomposites exhibit enhanced melt-processability and mechanical properties, which not only show potential application in substituting the existing non-degradable plastics but also provide a feasible strategy to promote carbon neutrality."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Corn starch (CS) was purchased from Xi'an Guowei Starch Co., Ltd., China. CNFs were provided by Chengdu Fololi New Material Technology Co., Ltd., China. Poly (vinyl alcohol)-1799 (PVA-1799), with molecular weight of 1700 and alcoholysis degree of 99%, was provided by SINOPEC Sichuan Vinylon Works (China). Analytical grade formamide was purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Plant (China)."
3,Preparation of melt-processed PVA/CS/CNFs composites,"2.2 Preparation of melt-processed PVA/CS/CNFs composites CNFs suspension with weight fraction of 1% was dried in the oven at 60 °C for 48 h to reduce the moisture level below 10%. CS was dried at 60 °C overnight. The small clips of PVA-1799 were pulverized in a high-speed blender to increase the specific surface area so that it can better absorb formamide and water. Then, the different proportions of PVA, CNFs and dried CS powder were blended with formamide and deionized water (DI Water) in accordance with the formulation shown in Table 1 (the content of CS, CNFs, formamide and DI Water is defined as per hundreds of PVA matrix). These mixtures were sealed in a beaker at ambient temperature for seven days to ensure plasticizers fully diffused into the PVA molecular chains [26]. Next, these mixtures were melt-mixed at 150 °C in a HAAKE Polylab QC mixing machine (Germany) with a rotating speed of 30 rpm for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the blends were shredded into small pieces with a crusher (FW200, Beijing Kewei Yongxing Instrument Co., Ltd). Finally, these small pieces were made into three-dimensional samples by compression moulding (DPE62(D), Shanghai Sima Weili Rubber & Plastic Machinery Co., Ltd) at 160 °C and 10 MPa for 10 min."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Micromorphology of CNFs and PVA/CS/CNFs composites was obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-5600, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The sample was previously coated with gold sputtering and mounted onto mental stubs using double-sided carbon tapes. 2.3.2 Zeta potential Zeta potential of CNFs was measured using Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Co., Britain) at room temperature. The sample was tested at a pH of 7.0. 2.3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis FTIR spectra of the PVA/CS/CNFs composites were recorded at ambient temperature by means of a NEXUS 670 spectrophotometer (Nicolet, USA), taking over 20 scans with a resolution of 2 cm−1, ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1 under the same conditions as the background. The samples were measured in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. 2.3.4 Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) analysis Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRAM HR Evolution instrument (HORIBA, France). The diode pumped Nd:YAG laser power is 500 mW while the operating wavelength is 785 nm. All the samples were measured from 100 to 3500 cm−1 with 100 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. 2.3.5 Thermal property analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by using a PerkinElmer TGA4000 (USA) in nitrogen atmosphere with heating rate of 10 °C /min and temperature ranging from ambient temperature to 600 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried on a Q25 DSC (TA, USA) in nitrogen atmosphere with heating rate of 10 °C /min and temperature ranging from 50 to 250 °C. Samples were tested in a sealing crucible during the whole process in order to avoid the vaporization of plasticizers. The crystallinity of PVA, PVA/CS, and PVA/CS/CNFs composites is calculated based on the following equation, X c = Δ H m wΔ H m 0 in which w is the weight fraction of PVA matrix in the composites, ΔH m is the heat of fusion and ΔH m 0 is the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline PVA which equals to 161 J/g [27]. 2.3.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis XRD patterns were collected on an Ultima IV instrument (Rigaku, Japan), using Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 0.1540 nm), an acceleration voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The samples were measured from 5° to 50° with a step interval of 0.02°/s. The Scherrer equation is used to calculate the crystallite size of PVA, PVA/CS, and PVA/CS/CNFs composites. D = Kλ β 1 / 2 cos θ where D is the crystallite size, β 1/2 is the full width of the peak measured at half maximum height (FWHM), K is a constant which equals to 0.94. 2.3.7 Tensile tests The data of tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break were obtained by operating an INSTRON 5966 universal testing machine (USA) according to ASTM D 412–80 specification with a crosshead speed of 100 mm/min. At least five measurements of each sample were conducted in order to eliminate experimental error."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Material design,"3.1 Material design Blending of renewable natural polymers and degradable plastics is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to prepare fully biodegradable composites and approach carbon neutrality. As renewable biological materials, CS and CNFs have a large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, biodegradable PVA also has many hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1a). In this study, we design an intermolecular complexation strategy (Fig. 1d) to realize the extension of processing window of PVA and the improvement of mechanical properties at the same time [28,29]. Initially, formamide and water form complexation with PVA molecular chains and disassociate original PVA inter- and intra-molecularly hydrogen bonds. In this way, formamide and water can reduce Tm of PVA via disrupting the regularity of molecular chains and inhibiting crystallinity (Fig. 1b) [30]. Next, both CS and CNFs contain a large number of hydroxyl groups which can be bonded to the disassociated hydrogen bonds of PVA, thereby disturbing hydrogen bond regularity of PVA molecular chains and improving the melt-processibility of PVA. CNFs integrate the above two materials through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and formulate strong interface combination for composites reinforcement [31–33]. As a result, high performance and low-cost sustainable composites are achieved via this intermolecular complexation strategy."
7,Microscopic morphology characterization of CNFs,"3.2 Microscopic morphology characterization of CNFs As shown in Fig. 2a, the image of SEM demonstrates CNFs with a diameter around 100 nm, exhibiting high aspect ratio and specific surface area. The renewable and biodegradable CNFs system is a desired candidate to replace inorganic nanoparticles to enhance organic polymer materials and prepare high-performance biomass-based nanocomposites [34,35]. Fig. 2b shows the digital photo of CNFs suspension and the Zeta potential of CNFs solution was −32.7 mV, confirming that the surface of CNFs is negatively charged. The electrostatic repulsive force between CNFs endows them with satisfactory suspension stability, which makes them finely disperse in matrix materials [36]."
8,FTIR and FT-Raman analysis,"3.3 FTIR and FT-Raman analysis Fig. 2c shows the FTIR spectra of PVA, PVA/CS composites and PVA/CS/CNFs composites. The characteristic absorption peaks of PVA are at 3315 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of side –OH groups), 2917 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of -CH2 groups), 1091 cm−1 (crystalline domains of PVA) and 1048 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of CO groups) [37,38]. The absorption peak at 3315 cm−1 shifts to lower wavelength by adding CS and CNFs. It demonstrates that the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds of PVA are broken, accompanied by the formation of new hydrogen bonds among PVA, CS, CNFs, and plasticizers during the melt-processing treatment. More importantly, the absorption peak at 1091 cm−1 shows a slight blue shift, which indicates that there is a variation of crystalline domains in PVA [39]. As shown in Fig. 2d, the Raman spectra of PVA, PVA/CS composites, PVA/CS/CNFs composites are presented to illustrate the interfacial interactions in the hydrogen bonding network. The absorption peaks at 2907, 1443, 1146, 1094, 916, 856 cm−1 are ascribed to PVA [37,40]. It is obvious that with the addition of CS and CNFs, the intensity of absorption peak at 2907 cm−1 becomes weaker. It indicates that molecular structure of PVA chain changed, and the original inter- and intra-hydrogen bonds of PVA chain disassociated and formed new hydrogen bonds with CS and CNFs. Specifically, the intensity of absorption peaks of PVA-20CS-10CNFs is nearly the weakest, suggesting that the formation of hydrogen bonding network among PVA, CS and CNFs which can hinder the crystallization of PVA."
9,Thermal analysis,"3.4 Thermal analysis As shown in Fig. 3a, the TG curves show that the thermal degradations of these composites have two main steps which start at about 210 °C and 250 °C. These two major weight losses for the composites are mainly attributed to the decomposition of PVA [41]. Notably, with the increase of CS and CNFs content, the main degradation peak of these composites conspicuously shifts to higher temperature. Meanwhile, the maximum degradation rate is lower, indicating that CS and CNFs significantly improve the thermal stability of the composites. This result is probably due to the good compatibility between CS and PVA matrix and the stability of CNFs. The DTG curves (Fig. 3b) show that these composites lost about 20% of their weight till 200 °C before the first step degradation of composites, which is due to the evaporation of formamide and water in the composites. Initial degradation temperature (Ti) of these composites by extrapolation method obtained from DTG curves are listed in Table 2 . Notably, with the addition of CS and CNFs, Ti gradually increases. Especially, Ti increases sharply when CNF is added, which is due to the good thermal stability and homogeneous dispersion of CNFs. The DSC curves given in Fig. 3c show that the peaks around 160 °C are attributed to the crystal melting peaks of PVA and the peaks around 230 °C belong to the thermal degradation of the PVA composites [42]. The crystal melting peaks of PVA obviously shift to lower temperature with the increase of CS and CNFs content, accounting for the fact that CS and CNFs could restrain the crystallization of PVA. The thermal data summarized from DSC curves are listed in Table 2, including Tm, ΔH and Xc of these composites. The Tm of these composites gradually decreases from 160.13 to 145.54 °C with different ratio of CS and CNFs, illustrating that these natural polymers containing polar hydroxyl groups on the surface can effectively inhibit crystallization and decrease the Tm of PVA. Furthermore, the values of ΔH and Xc obtained by calculating DSC curves according to the formula, decrease prominently and are consistent with the trend of Tm value (Fig. 4b). The results could be explained that CS and CNFs form new hydrogen bonds with PVA molecules and perturb the regularity of molecular chains and inhibited the crystallization of PVA. Decreasing Tm and increasing Ti are the keys to realize melt-processing of PVA. As shown in Table 2, when formamide and water are added as plasticizers according to our previous studies [26,39], the melt-processing window of PVA is 92.14 °C. It is interesting to note that with the addition of CS, Ti gradually increases and Tm decreases. Moreover, as the content of CNFs increases, Ti dramatically increases while Tm further decreases. Ultimately, the melt-processing window of PVA is prominently expanded, which has a broad range of 132.99 °C with the incorporation of 20 wt% CS and 10 wt% CNFs (Fig. 4c)."
10,Crystalline behavior analysis,"3.5 Crystalline behavior analysis XRD patterns of PVA, PVA/CS composites and PVA/CS/CNFs composites are presented in Fig. 3d, which are obtained to manifest the crystalline structure of PVA. The diffractograms show crystalline peaks localized at 2θ of 11.5°, 19.5° and 23.0°, which can be ascribed to the diffraction planes of 100, 101 and 200 of PVA, respectively [41,43]. The result demonstrates that the intensities of the crystalline diffractogram peaks become weaker and narrower with the incorporation of CS and CNFs. The formation of new hydrogen bonds between CS, CNFs and PVA replaces the intrinsic inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds of PVA, and constructs a new intermolecular complexation which leads to the inhibition of the crystallization of PVA. The crystallite sizes of PVA, PVA/CS composites, and PVA/CS/CNFs composites obtained from XRD are shown in Fig. 4a and Table 2. The crystallite size of PVA, with addition of formamide and water as plasticizers, is 8.5 nm. The crystallite size of PVA increases to 11.3 nm with CS added into the matrix. It is probably due to the reduction of crystallization sites and the decrease of crystal nuclei number. As a result, the formed crystal nuclei have larger spaces for crystal growth with sufficient time during melt cooling process. The crystallite size decreases with further addition of CS and CNFs. The possible reason is that the presence of CS and CNFs can occupy the part of the crystal growth space and disturb the regularity of PVA molecular chains by forming hydrogen bonds at the interface, which is in accordance with the DSC analysis."
11,Mechanical properties,"3.6 Mechanical properties Fig. 5a-c show the tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break of the melt-processed PVA composites, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, when CNF is not added to the composites, the tensile strength of the sample containing 20 wt% CS decreases by 13% from 22.5 MPa to 19.5 MPa compared with the sample containing 10 wt% CS. The SEM micrographs of PVA/CS/CNFs given in Fig. S1 illustrate that composite with high CS content in the PVA matrix appears some agglomerates and defects. The tensile strength of the sample containing 10 wt% CS and 20 wt% CS severally increases to 28.1 MPa and 24.2 MPa when 10 wt% CNFs are introduced into the composites, which is higher than most reported PVA composites with different CS content (Fig. 5d) [9,44–52]. For example, the PVA composite with 20 wt% starch content exhibit lower tensile strength (19.8 MPa) [9]. This result is attributed to the high length-diameter ratio and specific modulus of CNFs, which can realize stress transfer and improve the strength of the PVA composites. Such a combination between biodegradable polymers and nano-scale reinforcement is one of the most practical methods to enhance their mechanical properties [53]. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the modulus and elongation at break of the composites have the same tendency as tensile strength, which further demonstrate the result that CNFs have good adhesion and strong interfacial interaction with PVA matrix. The modulus and elongation at break of PVA composites with 20 wt% CNFs decrease apparently, which is ascribed to the agglomerates of CNFs in the PVA matrix caused by the high filler content and eventually leads to the stress concentration at the defect. As shown in Fig. S2, the tensile strength and modulus of the composites decrease when plasticizer content increases. At the same time, elongation at break of the composites increases with the increase of plasticizer. The content of plasticizer has the greatest effect on the elongation at break. Moreover, the effect of formamide content on the mechanical properties of composites is greater than that of water content. PVA, formamide and DI Water were blended in accordance with the formulation shown in Table S1 (the content of formamide and DI Water is defined as per hundreds of PVA matrix)."
12,Conclusion,"The Use of bioderived materials is seen as one of the most practical and promising methods to achieve carbon neutrality. This work investigated the biodegradable natural materials CS- and CNFs-filled PVA composites with improved melt-processability and mechanical properties. The result displays that on the basis of formamide and water as plasticizers, CS and CNFs can further restrict the crystallization of PVA by forming hydrogen bonding network. Overall, the PVA composites containing 10 wt% CS and 10 wt% CNFs has competitive mechanical properties, while melt-processing window is broadened to 131.46 °C. Since the composites are predominantly made up of renewable and biodegradable materials and fabrication process adopts melt-processing technology, the composites are expected to be sustainable and carbon neutral. In addition to PVA, our work can also be applied to other biodegradable plastics in pursuit of low cost, simple production process and comparable performance with universal plastics, which is of great significance for the wide applications of biodegradable plastics in various fields."
