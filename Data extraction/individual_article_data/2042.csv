0,Introduction,"At present, social development is highly dependent on internal combustion engines for transportation, commerce, and power generation [1]. Especially, compression-ignition engines are widely used for their excellent fuel efficiency, but a large amount of NOx and particle matters (PM) emissions have a serious adverse effect on the environment and health [2]. With the implementation and continuous strictness of emission regulations, efficient and clean combustion is imperative, which has caused scholars to explore and research advanced combustion technologies [3–8]. The homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion mode has been proposed in the last century. Due to the higher compression ratio and homogeneous mixture combustion, high thermal efficiency and low emissions can be achieved simultaneously [9]. However, since HCCI combustion is mainly driven by chemical kinetics, it is difficult to control the ignition timing and combustion rate, which leads to violent combustion and unacceptable noise under high load [10–12]. Reitz et al. optimized the design on the basis of HCCI technology and proposed the concept of reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) [13]. In this new mode, two sets of independent fuel supply systems are set to provide the engine with two different fuels [14], and low reactivity fuel is provided through port injection to form a homogeneous mixture while high reactivity fuel is provided through direct injection [15]. Due to the stratified distribution of reactivity, concentration, and temperature in the cylinder, the combustion process can be controlled by the fuel injection timing and injection volume, resulting in segmented heat release characteristics, thereby overcoming the load limitation of HCCI [16]. In the RCCI combustion mode, the reactivity stratification in the cylinder has a crucial influence on the combustion characteristics [17], so two or more fuels with different reactivities are often used to combine. The flexibility of such fuel makes various types of alternative fuels and different combinations extensively studied [18]. For example, biofuels, which are widely used in compression-ignition engines because of their oxygen content and renewability, have great potential in the RCCI mode [19,20]. Numerous studies have shown that oxygenated biofuels have considerable advantages in reducing PM emissions [21-23]. Yeh et al. [24] studied the effects of 14 different oxygenated fuels on diesel engine emissions, finding that alcohols are more effective in reducing PM emissions than other oxygenated fuels. This has also made alcohol fuels (including methanol [25], ethanol [26] and the recently more popular butanol) studied more [27], and even some results have also been achieved on some higher-level alcohols such as pentanol [28] and hexanol [29], etc. However, low-carbon alcohols such as propanol and butanol are considered to be more advantageous than higher-carbon alcohols with longer carbon chains in the RCCI combustion mode. Their advantages mainly include: (1) Higher octane number, which can increase the reactivity stratification gradient of RCCI combustion, increase ignition delay, reduce the peak heat release rate, and thus broaden the load range [30]; (2) Higher latent heat of vaporization. The cooling effect from the fuel evaporation in the cylinder reduces the temperature of the mixture, thereby reducing the formation of NOx [31]; (3) Higher fuel oxygen content. According to some early studies [32], the reduction of soot emissions is mainly related to the oxygen content of the fuel. The higher the oxygen content is, the less the soot emissions will be; (4) Shorter carbon chain length. According to the study by Westbrook et al. [33], as the carbon chain length of fuel molecules increases, the tendency to form six-member transition rings increases during molecular isomerization, which will increase the number of soot precursors in the intermediate product, resulting in more soot; (5) Lower cost [34]. Compared with high-carbon alcohols, the development of low-carbon alcohol biotechnology has brought lower costs, which has increased production and applications in internal combustion engines [35]. Recently, Koivisto et al. [36] studied the effects of oxygen-containing functional groups on the combustion and emissions of diesel engines and found that the position of oxygen-containing functional groups in the molecule is one of the main molecular characteristics that affect ignition delay, and ignition delay significantly affects combustion and emission performance formation. It can be found that as the length of the carbon chain increases, the position of oxygen functional groups, i.e. the hydroxyl group positions (OHP), in the alcohol molecules with the same molecular formula are different, which makes the alcohols have isomers starting from propanol [37]. Propanol is a three-carbon alcohol. Its isomers include n-propanol and iso-propanol, which are the simplest pair of alcohol isomers. The main difference lies in the difference in OHP. However, the butanol of four-carbon alcohol has four isomers, including n-butanol, sec-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol [38]. Compared with propanol isomers, butanol isomers are different because of the presence of carbon chain branching (CCB). Such molecular structure such as OHP and CCB is believed to change the bond energy and isomerization pathway of the molecule, and also change the physical and chemical properties to a certain extent, thereby affecting combustion and emissions [39,40]. Accordingly, many scholars have explored the influence of OHP and CCB in the molecular structure of alcohols from the perspective of molecular structure. Li [41] studied the laminar combustion characteristics of the six isomers of the higher alcohol pentanol and the air mixture, and the results show that when the hydroxyl group or the methyl group becomes branched, i.e. OHP moves inward and CCB increases, the laminar burning rate is decreased, with the similar degree of influence. In addition, if more groups become branched, such as a further increase in CCB, the laminar combustion rate will be further decreased. Wu et al. [42] measured the laminar flame velocity and Markstein length of four butanol isomers at a pressure of 1 to 5 atm. The results show that the increase of CCB will cause slower flame speed because the branched chain structure is easier to crack into more stable branched species. Preuß et al. [43] studied and evaluated the potential of mixtures of four high-carbon alcohol C8 and C10 with different CCB and vegetable oil as internal combustion engine fuel in a heavy-duty compression-ignition engine. In the test, a lower in-cylinder temperature was formed through a certain EGR level, and it was found that 2-propyl-1-heptanol with a propyl branched carbon chain structure achieved the highest thermal efficiency, and straight chain alcohols had higher heat release rate than branched alcohols, which also leads to a higher level of NOx emission. This may be related to the physical and chemical properties of the fuel and the formation of the mixture. Koivisto et al. [44] systematically studied the combustion and emission characteristics of the mixtures of 17 kinds of high-carbon alcohols with C8-C16 chain length and diesel in a compression-ignition engine using an ultra-low-capacity fuel system, and the results show that the change of OHP in the high-carbon alcohol molecules has a significant effect on ignition delay. The internal shift of OHP leads to an increase in ignition delay, which also leads to more NOx and nuclear PM emissions. Besides, Yang [45] systematically studied the ignition characteristics of alcohol/n-heptane mixed fuels in a rapid compressor test and found that the change of OHP has a greater impact on the ability of propanol isomers to grab active groups, and it also has a greater impact on the ability of butanol and pentanol isomers to produce active groups, while CCB enhances the stability of alcohol molecules and greatly weakens the ability of alcohols to grab active groups. It is worth noting that the ability of alcohol fuels to grab active groups and to generate active groups by themselves has a greater impact on the ignition characteristics of mixed fuels. Kasper et al. [46] used two independent molecular beam mass spectrometry techniques to study the combustion of lower alcohols n-propanol and iso-propanol in a low-pressure premixed flat flame to explore the influence of OHP, and found that they had combustion intermediates with different activities during the oxidation process. The oxidation of n-propanol resulted in a large amount of propionaldehyde in the intermediate, while the oxidation of iso-propanol mainly resulted in acetone. The main reason for this phenomenon is that different OHPs form different dehydrogenation decomposition routes. This phenomenon even affects the progress of combustion and the generation of emissions to a certain extent. Gu et al. [47] studied the laminar combustion velocity and flame stability of the premixed flame of low-carbon alcohol butanol and its isomers with air in the shock tube and found that the molecular structure of the fuel greatly affects the laminar combustion velocity but does not change the flame stability. From the perspective of the bond energy dissociation, the main reason for this phenomenon is considered to be that the large bond energy is not conducive to the hydrogen extraction reaction, which then leads to the reduction of the combustion velocity. Zheng et al. [48] also studied the effects of low-carbon alcohol butanol and its isomers on conventional and low-temperature combustion when blended with diesel in a single-cylinder diesel engine. The results show that the ignition delay is iso-butanol > sec-butanol > n-butanol > tert-butanol in descending order. The main reason for this anomaly is believed to be that the reactivity of the butanol/diesel mixture depends on the relative inhibition of the butanol isomers on diesel oxidation. Because tert-butanol has the weakest ability to compete with diesel for hydroxyl groups, it has the shortest ignition delay, while soot emissions are just the opposite. In addition, some previous studies [49,50] also show that under low-pressure premixed flame conditions, benzene, propargyl and other soot precursors are the main intermediate products of tert-butanol, thereby leading to the increase of soot emissions. Liu et al. [51,52] studied the influence of lower alcohols n-butanol and sec-butanol with different OHPs on conventional and low-temperature combustion when blended with diesel, but found that n-butanol and sec-butanol had insignificant influence on combustion and soot emissions when blended separately with diesel with a small proportion of 20%. However, Gu et al. [53] studied the blending of n-butanol and iso-butanol with diesel and found that iso-butanol with branched structure has longer ignition delay and higher soot emissions because of the lower cetane number of iso-butanol and the presence of CCB, which makes it easier to form soot precursors. It can be seen from these previous studies that the changes in OHP and CCB in alcohol fuels (whether high-carbon or low-carbon alcohols) have a greater impact on ignition delay and combustion rate. However, currently, most of the research on the molecular structure of alcohols in diesel engines has focused on mixed fuels, and the in-cylinder technical field explored is mainly conventional and blended combustion. The combustion method used in such literature can form temperature and concentration stratifications in the cylinder to affect combustion and emission performance [54]. However, it is worth noting that the study by Tang et al. [55] on the effects of the three stratifications in RCCI mode on ignition delay through optical diagnostics shows that the fuel’s reactivity and concentration stratifications jointly determine the ignition delay, and the influence of the reactivity stratification is greater than that of the concentration stratification while the temperature stratification has little effect on ignition delay. Therefore, it will become more meaningful to explore the influence of alcohol molecular structure on combustion and emission performance in RCCI mode. To sum up, the RCCI mode can form stratifications of reactivity, concentration and temperature in the mixture, thereby affecting the combustion and emission performance of RCCI. Meanwhile, the lower alcohol fuel is greatly potential in the application in this mode. The above-mentioned studies on alcohol fuels show that the molecular structure of alcohol, i.e. OHP and CCB, has a significant impact on combustion and emissions. Although scholars have carried out experimental investigations on the influence of the molecular structure of alcohol fuels in compression-ignition engines, the research objects are often high-carbon alcohols with longer carbon chains, and the technical field of in-cylinder combustion is mainly concentrated in combustion modes such as conventional or blending mode. The stratifications in the cylinder are mainly temperature and concentration stratifications rather than fuel reactivity stratification. Therefore, it is more necessary to study the influence of lower alcohol molecular structure in RCCI mode. In this paper, propanol, butanol and their isomers, a total of six lower alcohol fuels, were selected as the low reactivity fuels for RCCI engine. Different from the above-mentioned research on the molecular structure of lower alcohols, this research, starting from propanol, constructed three molecular structures: changes of OHP, methyl branches (MB), and straight carbon chain (SCC). See details in Section 2. Then, experimental data of exhaust emissions are drawn from a RCCI engine under different oxygen mass content (RO) and start of injection (SOI), and changes of exhaust emissions with OHP, MB and SCC under different RO and SOI are analyzed in Section 3.1. Finally, real influence factors and influence sequence of OHP, MB, SCC, RO and SOI on different emissions are analyzed quantitatively through Spearman correlation and linear regression coefficients in Section 3.2. Through the above analysis, the research on the influence of the molecular structure of lower alcohols on RCCI engine emissions was finally realized."
1,Experimental setup and procedures,
2,Experimental bench,"2.1 Experimental bench Because all experiments were carried out on the same RCCI engine of our research group, the description of Fig. 1 was omitted in this article. While details of the schematic of the engine and instruments setup can be found in our previous article [56,57], and gaseous emissions were measured by a gas analyzer (MEXA-7100DEGR, HORIBA), of which the uncertainty is ± 0.2%. The only difference is that the total number and average diameter of exhaust particles were measured by the Solid Particle Counter (NanoMet3), of which the uncertainty is ± 0.1%. Among them, NOx was measured by chemiluminescence analyzer, HC by hydrogen flame ionization method and CO by non-dispersive infrared ray, while the particle number concentration (PNC) and particle average diameter (PAD) were measured by a Diffusion Size Classifier, and the particle mass concentration (PMC) was measured by a thermo-dilution method. HC, CO and NOx emissions are obtained by recording 10 values manually within one minute after the engine is stabilized and then averaging them, while particle emissions are also average value of about 120 data collected in 1 min automatically after the engine is stabilized. The main technical characteristics of the engine are shown in Table 1 , and Table 2 lists the accuracy of the main measurement parameters. Among all data provided in this study, 0 °CA (crankshaft angle) is considered as the top dead center of the compression stroke."
3,Experimental fuels,"2.2 Experimental fuels In order to study the influence of OHP, MB and SCC of lower alcohol molecules on RCCI emissions, the diesel was selected as the high reactivity fuel in this experiment, and six alcohols including propanol/butanol isomers were selected as the low reactivity fuels. Fig. 2 shows the molecular structure relationship of 6 kinds of lower alcohol fuels: (1) n-propanol → iso-propanol, n-butanol → sec-butanol or iso-butanol → tert-butanol is the molecular structure change process of OHP internal shift; (2) n-propanol → iso-butanol or iso-propanol → tert-butanol is the molecular structure change process of MB increase; (3) n-propanol → n-butanol or iso-propanol → sec-butanol is the molecular structure change process of SCC increase. For main physical and chemical properties of various fuels used in this study, see Table 3 ."
4,Experimental procedures,"2.3 Experimental procedures As is shown in Table 4 , a series of parameters remain unchanged in this study when the test is designed in order to understand the influence of molecular structure on RCCI emissions: the engine speed is controlled at 1500 r/min, the diesel fuel enters the cylinder through direct injection with the injection pressure of 100 MPa, and six lower alcohol fuels are premixed and then injected into the cylinder through port fuel injection system, with the injection pressure and injection timing of 0.55 MPa and −360 °CA ATDC, respectively. During the experiment, the inlet temperature was kept at 30 ± 1 °C, and the temperatures of the cooling water and lubricating oil were respectively constant at 90 ± 1 °C and 80 ± 1 °C. In this study, Etotal has always been maintained at 2000 J/cyc. Etotal is the sum of the energy of alcohol and diesel fuel supplied into the engine per cycle, and its definition is shown in Formula 1. In order to explore the impact of molecular structure on RCCI combustion and emissions from a broader perspective, four diesel injection timings (SOI), namely −10, −12, −15, −20 °CA ATDC, were chosen and three fuel oxygen contents (RO), namely 8%, 10%, and 12% were selected. RO is the oxygen mass content in alcohol and diesel fuel supplied into the engine per cycle, and its definition is shown in Formula 2. RO is different from Oalcohol in Table 3. Oalcohol is the oxygen mass content in the alcohol. (1) E t o t a l = m a l c o h o l · H a l c o h o l + m d i e s e l · H d i e s e l (2) R o = m a l c o h o l · O a l c o h o l m a l c o h o l + m d i e s e l Notes: Halcohol is lower heating value of the alcohol; Hdiesel is lower heating value of the diesel; malcohol is the mass of the alcohol injected into the manifold per engine cycle; mdiesel is the mass of diesel injected into the cylinder per engine cycle; Etotal is the sum of the energy of alcohol and diesel fuel supplied into the engine per cycle; Oalcohol is the oxygen mass content in the alcohol; RO is the oxygen mass content in alcohol and diesel fuel supplied into the engine per cycle. It is worth mentioning that although the low heat value and Oalcohol of different low-carbon straight chain alcohols may be different from each other, the alcohol/diesel cycle injection mass has been constructed by combining Formulas (1) and (2) to maintain a constant Etotal of 2000 J/cyc with three Ros for six low-carbon straight chain alcohols, as shown in Table 5 , the detail calculation process of malcohol and mdiesel are as follows: The calculation formula of malcohol and mdiesel, formula (3) and (4), can be obtained by combining formula (1) and (2). (3) m a l c o h o l = R o · E t o t a l R o · H a l c o h o l + ( O a l c o h o l - R o ) · H d i e s e l (4) m d i e s e l = ( O a l c o h o l - R o ) · E t o t a l R o · H a l c o h o l + ( O a l c o h o l - R o ) · H d i e s e l Taking n-propanol as an example, when Ro is 8%, we know that Etotal is 2000 J/cyc, Hdiesel is 42.65 MJ/Kg, On-propanol is 26.67%, and Hn-propanol is 30.6 MJ/Kg, seem from Table 3. From equations (3) and (4), mn-propanol is 15.37 mg/cyc and mdiesel is 35.87 mg/cyc can be obtained respectively, as shown in Table 5."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Main performance parameters of RCCI engine,"3.1 Main performance parameters of RCCI engine This section presents the test data of four main performance parameters of RCCI engine: cylinder pressure, heat release rate, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and thermal efficiency. Due to the large amount of data (72 working points) in this study, it would be messy to include all the data points in the figure. Therefore, by removing the data points expressing repeated information, Fig. 3 is obtained as shown below. In this article, the fuel names in the figures are all abbreviated: n-p. for n-propanol, i-p. for iso-propanol, n-b. for n-butanol, s-b. for sec-butanol, i-b. for iso-butanol, and t-b. for tert-butanol. Different shapes of symbols and colors are used for indication, and the percentage represents the size of RO, which is distinguished by the degree of solidity. 8% oxygen content is shown by a hollow symbol, 10% by semi-solid, and 12% by a solid. Fig. 3(a)-(b) show the change of cylinder pressure and heat release rate with the Crank Angle, and they share the same abscissa. Fig. 3(a)-(b) provide cylinder pressure and heat release rate of all six low alcohol isomers when SOI is −20°CA ATDC and Ro is 8%, and of three fuels, n-p., i-p. and n-b. when SOI is −10°CA ATDC and Ro is 8% and 12%. As can be seen from the figure, the curves of cylinder pressure or heat release rate are almost overlapped at the same SOI, that is, the two do not change with molecule structure or Ro. However, SOI has a great influence on cylinder pressure and heat release rate, which will directly change the starting point of heat release and the heat release peak of premixed combustion, etc. With the advance of SOI, the heat release rate curve is advanced overall, and the heat release peak of premixed combustion increases. Fig. 3(c)-(d) reveals the change of IMEP and thermal efficiency as SOI, Ro and low alcohol isomers change. IMEP and thermal efficiency share the same abscissa, of which the unit is SOI. Fig. 3(c)-(d) gives experimental data of IMEP and Thermal efficiency of all six low alcohol isomers and four SOIs, when Ro is 8%, and of three Ros and four SOIs for only i-b., respectively. It can be seen from the figure that the increase of Ro will lead to a significant decrease in IMEP or thermal efficiency. IMEP increases with the advance of SOI, while thermal efficiency increases first and then decreases with the advance of SOI. In addition, it is worth noting that the IMEP or thermal efficiency of propanol isomers is higher than that of butanol isomers, except for tert-butanol. The IMEP or thermal efficiency of tert-butanol is obviously higher than that of the other three butanol isomers, which is similar to that of propanol isomers."
7,Changes of emissions with molecule structure,"3.2 Changes of emissions with molecule structure In this section, changes of exhaust emissions, including HC emission, CO emission, NOX emission, particle mass concentration (PMC), particle number concentration (PNC) and particle average diameter (PAD) with OHP, MB and SCC are analyzed through three-dimensional figures based on the experimental data drawn from the RCCI engine under different Ro and SOI. In order to show the changes of exhaust emissions with OHP, MB and SCC under different RO and SOI in a clearer and more intuitive manner, three-dimensional figures were adopted. For the convenience of description, OHP, MB, SCC, RO and SOI are collectively referred to as five impact factors in this paper. As is shown in Figs. 4-9 , the two abscissas indicate RO and SOI while the ordinate shows exhaust emissions. The SOI of the three sets of data under different RO is the same, i.e. −10, −12, −15, and −20 °CA ATDC. In the figure, in order to show the influence of OHP, MB and SCC more intuitively, a group of data with only OHP change is marked with a circle, a group of data with only MB change is marked with a triangle, and a group of data with SCC change is marked with a square. The impact of RO and SOI is easy to identify in the three-dimensional graph, so the associated data group is not deliberately marked. 3.2.1 Gaseous emissions Fig. 4 reveals changes of HC emission with five impact factors. As can be seen from the figure, the changes of HC emission with five impact factors are very obvious. As to the influence of fuel changes, it is found that the HC emission rankings of the six lower alcohol fuels are all n-propanol < iso-propanol < n-butanol < iso-butanol < sec-butanol < tert-butanol; as to the influence of OHP, it can be seen from the comparison of the HC emission of n-propanol and iso-propanol, that of n-butanol and sec-butanol or that of iso-butanol and tert-butanol that the internal shift of OHP leads to an increase in HC emission; as to the influence of MB, it can be seen from the comparison of the HC emission of n-propanol and iso-butanol or that of iso-propanol and tert-butanol that the increase of MB causes the increase of HC emission; as to the influence of SCC, it can be seen from the comparison of the HC emission of n-propanol and n-butanol or that of iso-propanol and sec-butanol that the increase of SCC causes the increase of HC emission; as to the influence of RO, it can be seen that HC emissions will increase with the increase of RO; and as to the influence of SOI, it can be seen that HC emissions will almost always decrease with the advancement of SOI. Besides, it can also be concluded that the HC emission changes with a certain influencing factor will not be affected by the changes of the other four factors, but the changes of the other four factors will change the numerical value of HC emission. Fig. 5 reveals changes of CO emission with five impact factors. It can be seen from the figure that, similar to HC emission, CO emission changes with five impact factors are equally obvious. Regarding the impact of fuel changes, the order of CO emission for the six lower alcohol fuels is iso-propanol < n-propanol < tert-butanol < sec-butanol < iso-butanol < n-butanol; regarding the impact of OHP, i.e. through the comparison of CO emission of n-propanol and iso-propanol, that of n-butanol and sec-butanol or that of iso-butanol and tert-butanol, it can be seen that the internal shift of OHP will lead to a reduction in CO emission; regarding the impact of MB, i.e. through the comparison of the CO emission of n-propanol and iso-butanol or that of iso-propanol and tert-butanol, it can be seen that the increase in MB will cause the increase of CO emission; regarding the impact of SCC, i.e. by comparing the CO emission of n-propanol and n-butanol or that of iso-propanol and sec-butanol, it can be seen that an increase in SCC will cause a reduction in CO emission; regarding the impact of RO, it can be seen that CO emission will increase with the increase of RO; and regarding the impact of SOI, it can be seen that CO emission will almost always decrease with the advancement of SOI. Also, it can be concluded that CO emission is similar to HC emission, and its changes with a certain influencing factor will not be affected by the changes of the other four factors, but the changes of other four factors will change the value of CO emission. Fig. 6 reveals changes of NOX emission with five impact factors. It can be seen from the data in the figure clearly that different from HC and CO emissions, NOX emission almost only changes with changes in SOI, and NOX emission increases with the advancement of SOI. The remaining four impact factors can be ignored regardless of the change of NOX emission with SOI or the value of NOX emission. 3.2.2 Solid particulate emissions Fig. 7 reveals changes of PMC with five impact factors. Unlike gaseous emissions, PMC changes with five impact factors are slightly more complicated. It can be seen from the figure that when the influence of fuel changes is investigated, it can be seen that the PMC ranking of different fuels will change with the changes of RO and SOI; when the influence of OHP is investigated, iso-butanol and tert-butanol are a group of fuels for OHP internal shift which causes the increase of PMC. However, when the fuel group is changed, i.e. when n-propanol and iso-propanol or n-butanol and sec-butanol are used as the two groups of fuels for OHP internal shift, it is found that the influence of OHP on PMC is not obvious; when the influence of MB is investigated, n-propanol and iso-butanol are used as a group of fuels for increase of MB, resulting in a decrease in PMC. However, when the fuel is changed, i.e. when iso-propanol and tert-butanol are used as a group of fuels for increase of MB, such increase causes an increase in PMC. It can be seen that the change of fuel affects the influence of OHP or MB on PMC; when the influence of SCC is investigated, i.e. by comparing the PMC of n-propanol and n-butanol or that of iso-propanol and sec-butanol, it can be seen that the increase of SCC causes the decrease of PMC in most cases; when the influence of RO is investigated, at late injection timing, i.e. when SOI is −10 or −12 °CA ATDC, PMC decreases with the increase of RO. However, at an earlier injection timing, i.e. when SOI is −15 or −20 °CA ATDC, PMC increases with the increase of RO. Taking n-butanol as an example, when SOI is −20 °CA ATDC and after RO is increased from 8% to 10%, PMC is increased from 0.3 mg/m3 to 0.38 mg/m3; when the influence of SOI is investigated, it is found that when RO is 8%, the PMC of the six fuels is all decreased with the advancement of SOI. As the RO increases and the low reactivity fuel is n-propanol, iso-propanol, or tert-butanol, PMC still decreases with the advancement of SOI. While when the low reactivity fuel is n-butanol, sec-butanol or iso-butanol, PMC firstly increases and then decreases with the advancement of SOI. Based on the above analysis, it can also be concluded that in addition to the change rule of PMC with SCC is not affected by the other four factors, the change rule and value of PMC with a certain influence factor will be affected by some other factors. Fig. 8 reveals changes of PNC with five impact factors. It can be seen from the figure that when the impact of fuel changes is examined, it can be seen that PNC of n-propanol is always the highest while PNC of sec-butanol is always the lowest, and the PNC ranking of other fuels will vary due to difference of RO and SOI; when the influence of OHP is examined, and n-propanol and iso-propanol or n-butanol and sec-butanol are used as the two sets of fuels for OHP internal shift, it is found that the PNC of n-propanol is greater than that of iso-propanol and the PNC of n-butanol is greater than that of sec-butanol. That is, OHP internal shift causes decrease in PNC. However, when the fuel is changed, i.e. when iso-butanol and tert-butanol are used as a group of fuels for OHP internal shift, it is found that the PNC of iso-butanol is smaller than that of tert-butanol. That is, OHP internal shift causes the increase of PNC. It can be seen that the change of fuel group affects the influence law of OHP on PNC; when the influence of MB is examined, it can be seen from the comparison of the PNC of n-propanol and iso-butanol or that of iso-propanol and tert-butanol that the increase of MB causes the decrease of PNC in most cases; when the influence of SCC is examined, i.e. by comparing the PNC of n-propanol and n-butanol or that of iso-propanol and sec-butanol, it can be seen that the increase of SCC causes the decrease of PNC; when the influence of RO is examined, it can be seen that PNC will decrease with the increase of RO; when the influence of SOI is examined, it is found that with a lower oxygen content, i.e. when RO is 8%, PNC firstly decreases and then increases with the advancement of SOI. Meanwhile, with the increase of RO, the tendency of PNC to decrease firstly and then increase with the advancement of SOI becomes no longer obvious. It can also be concluded from the above analysis that the variation of PMC with MB, SCC or RO is not affected by the other four factors, and the other four impact factors will only change the value of PMC. However, the change rule and value of PMC with OHP or SOI will be affected by some other factors. Fig. 9 reveals changes of PAD with five impact factors. It can be seen from the figure that when the impact of fuel changes is examined, it can be seen that the PAD ranking of different fuels will change with the changes of RO and SOI; when the impact of OHP is examined and the n-propanol and iso-propanol or n-butanol and sec-butanol are used as the two groups of fuels for OHP internal shift, it is found that the PAD of n-propanol is less than that of iso-propanol and the PAD of n-butanol is less than that of sec-butanol in most cases. That is, OHP internal shift causes the increase of PAD. However, when the fuel group is changed, i.e. when iso-butanol and tert-butanol are used as a group of fuels for OHP internal shift, it is found that there is no clear rule for the influence of OHP on PAD; when the influence of MB is investigated, it can be seen from the PAD of n-propanol and iso-butanol or that of iso-propanol and tert-butanol that PAD increases with the increase of MB in most cases; when the influence of SCC is investigated, i.e. by comparing the PAD of n-propanol and n-butanol or that of iso-propanol and sec-butanol, it can be seen that the increase of SCC causes the increase of PAD; when the influence of RO is examined, it can be seen that PAD increases with the increase of RO; and when the impact of SOI is examined, it can be seen that PAD firstly increases and then decreases with the advancement of SOI. It can also be concluded from the above analysis that the variation of PAD with MB, SCC, RO or SOI is not affected by the other four factors, but the other four impact factors will change the value of PAD. However, the variation of PAD with OHP is related to the observed fuel group. 3.2.3 Causes of the phenomena The OHP internal shift makes the alcohol tend to form more stable intermediates during the reaction [39], thereby inhibiting its reactivity and leading to lower flame propagation speed, which will intensify incomplete combustion in the near-wall regions [56]. However, the combustion temperature in such regions may be decreased to a temperature not suitable for the oxidation of HC to CO [62,63], leading to an increase in HC emission but decrease in CO emission with OHP internal shift; The MB increase enhances the stability of alcohol molecules and greatly weakens the ability of alcohols to grab active groups [45]. Besides, with the increase of MB, the total diesel injection is reduced, as can be seen from Table 5, so that the diesel in the near-wall regions is reduced. These two reasons may intensify incomplete combustion and eventually cause an increase in HC and CO emissions simultaneously; Originally, the SCC increase would lead to the increase of reactivity of alcohols, but at the same time, the total diesel injection is reduced, as can be seen from Table 5, which may eventually intensify incomplete combustion. Moreover, the combustion temperature may be decreased to a temperature not suitable for the oxidation of HC to CO, ultimately resulting in an increase in HC emission but decrease in CO emission with SCC increase; With the RO increase, the global reactivity of the mixture is reduced, hence an increase in HC and CO emissions simultaneously. With the SOI delay, shown in Fig. 3(b), the heat release is retarded and the combustion temperature is reduced, leading to an increase in HC and CO emissions simultaneously. As for the solid particulate emissions, different from the traditional diesel diffusion combustion, the particles from the RCCI engine mainly consist of two parts [64]: the nucleation mode particles (d < 30 nm) and the accumulation mode particles (30 nm < d < 400 nm). Moreover, the nucleation mode particles dominate the particle number while the accumulation mode particles dominate the particle mass. With the SOI delay, the PMC increased, which means the accumulation mode particles increased. As can be seen from Fig. 3(b), the heat release is retarded and the proportion of premixed heat release is decreased with the SOI delay, leading to a decrease in the combustion temperature and an increase in the proportion of diffusion heat release, which causes an increase in PMC and a decrease in NOX emission. The MB increase leads to a branched chain, which is conducive to the generation of soot precursors [53]. Similarly, SCC increase will promote the tendency to form six-membered transition rings, leading to more soot generation [33]. Both of which are all beneficial to the formation of the accumulation mode particles, hence an increase in PAD. While the reason for decrease of PNC and increase of PAD with the RO increase is more complex. As the detailed reason for this result has been expounded emphatically in our previous study [57], it will not be repeated in this article. In a nutshell, since the number concentration and surface area of pre-existing particles in the exhaust gas increase with increasing RO, the degree of the liquid condensation of volatile organic fraction (VOF) /non-VOF increases, leading to an increase in both accumulation mode particle number and mass concentration. Conversely, the liquid nucleation degree is reduced, leading to a decrease in nucleation mode particle number concentration. These causes eventually lead to the decrease of PNC and increase of PAD with the RO increase, and so does to the decrease of PNC with MB or SCC increase."
8,Correlation and regression analysis,"3.3 Correlation and regression analysis The influence rules of five factors for all the six emission parameters are discussed in section 3.1, yet it is still unable to differentiate between the real factors and irrelevant ones. Consequently, the influence order of the real factors is unrevealed. Among all the factors, OHP, MB and SCC represents different states of fuel characteristics, which numerical values could not be directly read from experiments, i.e. non-parametric variables [65]. Besides, the two numerical factors RO and SOI could not sheer obey Gaussian distribution under operation condition number of 72. It is proper to employ Spearman correlation coefficient to distinguish the real influence fators of each emission under the above background. By ranking the states of non-parametric variables and values of parametric ones, Spearman correlation could reveal monotonous relationship between two variables, whether parametric or non-parametric. Spearman correlation is also applicative for abnormal distributions, and its sensitivity on linear correlation is close to Pearson correlation [66]. For an influence factor X i and an emission parameter Y j , rank the two variables in order and transform them into rank variables rg X i and rg Y j [67], the Spearman correlation coefficient could be calculated by the following equation: ρ rg X i , rg Y j = cov ( rg X i , rg Y j ) σ rg X i σ rg Y j where, ρ rg X i , rg Y j denotes the Spearman correlation coefficient between rg X i and rg Y j . cov ( rg X i , rg Y j ) denotes the covariance of rg X i and rg Y j . σ is the standard deviations of corresponding rank variable. Identical states or values in a same variable are assigned fractional ranks equal to the average of their positions in the ascending order. Moreover, significance tests are conducted to exclude irrelevant factors. Fig. 10 shows the Spearman correlation coefficients between five impact factors and six emissions [68]. The critical Spearman correlation coefficients with a confidence of 99% is ± 0.303 under condition number of 72, which are marked by the two vertical dotted lines [69]. If the absolute value of Spearman correlation coefficient between any two arbitrary influence factor and emission parameter is larger than the critical value, the two variables are significantly correlated, which means the factor owns an authentic influence on the corresponding emission. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the real influence factors of different emissions are quite different, and there is a positive and negative correlation. The real influencing factors reveal the most effective factors to reduce certain emissions, and the positive or negative correlation respectively represents the increase or decrease of a certain emission with the increase of a certain real influencing factor. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the real influence factors of HC emission are MB and RO, and they are all positively correlated; the real influence factors of CO emission are SCC and RO, and both are positively correlated; the real influence factors of NOX and PMC emissions are only SOI, but they are negatively correlated and positively correlated respectively; the real influence factors of PNC are SCC, RO and SOI, and PNC is negatively correlated with SCC and RO; the real influence factors of PAD are also SCC, RO and SOI, while all of which are positively correlated with PAD. Moreover, in combination with Fig. 4 and Fig. 10, when examining HC emission, it is worth noting that, HC emission seems to change positively with SOI obviously, but in fact, the emission is not correlated with the SOI. The determination of real influence factors and influence sequence is necessary and helpful to optimize combustion strategy. The method of linear regression is adopted to determine the influence order of real factors for six emissions. All the variables are normalized preprocessed to exclude the influence of different range. The method of least squares is used to calculate the regression coefficients of real influence factors for the six emissions respectively. It is evident that the larger the absolute value of a regression coefficient is, the more sensitive to the corresponding factor the emission will be. The sensitivity sequence of the real influence factors for the six emissions could be intuitively revealed by Fig. 11 as follows: HC emission is RO > MB, CO is RO > SCC, NOx and PMC are only SOI, PNC is RO > SCC > SOI, and PAD is RO > SCC≈SOI. It also can be inferred that, NOx and PMC are uncorrelated to molecule structure, all emissions are unrelated to OHP, and only HC is correlated to MB. While SCC is correlated to multiple emissions, which are CO emission, PNC and PAD, and emission types correlated to Ro and SOI are the most."
9,Conclusions,"In this research, low alcohol isomers, propanol and butanol, are adopted as low reactivity fuels and diesel adopted as high reactivity fuel on the RCCI engine. Three kinds of molecular structure, OHP, MB, and SCC are constructed between the low alcohol isomers. To investigate the effect of molecule structure on exhaust emission, the following two aspects of work have been carried out based on the experimental data drawn from the RCCI engine under the same Etotal but different RO and SOI: 1. Changes of exhaust emissions with OHP, MB, SCC, Ro and SOI are analyzed. 2. Real influence factors and influence sequence of OHP, MB, SCC, Ro and SOI on different emissions are analyzed quantitatively though Spearman correlation and linear regression coefficients. The conclusions are as follows: (1) A certain emission seems to change with a certain impact factor obviously, but in fact, the emission may not be correlated with the impact factor. For example, although HC emission decreases with the advance of SOI, they are not correlated with each other. (2) Different emissions have different real influencing factors. For example, NOX and PMC emissions are unrelated to molecule structure. On the contrary, they are only correlated to SOI. Moreover, all emissions are unrelated to OHP, and only HC emission is correlated to MB, while SCC is correlated to multiple emissions, and emission types correlated to Ro and SOI are the most. (3) The determination of real influencing factors and influence sequence is helpful to optimize combustion strategy. For example, to reduce HC and CO emissions at the same time, reducing RO would be the most effective way to do so comparing to changing the other four impact factors, because only Ro is the real influencing factor of both HC and CO emissions, and it has the strongest positive correlation with HC and CO emissions."
