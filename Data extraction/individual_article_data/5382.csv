0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting using semiconductor catalysts is featured by low pollution, which makes it an idea 'green' and recyclable route for solar energy conversion [1–4]. However, to make it competitive with other energy sources, the activity/cost ratio must be raised substantially because of the low activity and/or high cost of photocatalysts so far. Cost considerations are the motivation for the development of metal-free low-cost photocatalysts that are instead based on, for example, carbon nanostructures and polymers such as graphitic carbon nitride (CN) [5–8]. Increases in activity of photocatalytic reaction has long relied on the nanostructure design including templating [9,10], supramolecular preorganization [11,12] and construction of CN based heterojunctions [13–15] to engineer its electronic structure and optical properties to facilitating photogenerated charge separation and redox reaction. In particular, constructing heterostructure by coupling two or more dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is an effective strategy. Photogenerated charge separation is efficient in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures with appropriate band alignment, whereas it is inefficient in single layer [16–18]. Generally, 2D heterostructures can be classified into two types: the vertical heterostructures (VHSs) and lateral heterostructures (LHSs). The former, also known as van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructure [19–21], is commonly constructed by stacking multiple monolayers vertically layer-by-layer, and the latter is the direct edge-connection between different 2D materials at interface. VHSs have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally, and demonstrated in various enhanced functional materials and devices [22–25]. Compared to VHSs, LHSs have higher epitaxial quality and stability because there are more than one 2D material stitched together seamlessly in-plane by covalent bonds at the interface [26–28]. Therefore, LHSs have intriguing properties, such as concomitant enhancements of stability and charge transfer relative to corresponding VHSs. However, suitable basic building blocks available for constructing LHSs are extremely limited, and up to now it is currently challenging to experimentally prepare the LHSs with unique structure (such as 1D porous tube) to achieve the desirable performances. Graphitic carbon nitride (CN), as an intriguing 2D metal-free photocatalyst, has recently attracted increasing research attention owing to its Earth-abundant and low-cost, easy fabrication, chemical stability, and favorable band positions [29–32]. Different from most photocatalysts, CN is capable of generating H2 and H2O2 from water even in the absence of catalytic metals [33–35]. However, its quantum efficiency is quite low because CN is severely poisoned by the produced H2O2, which is difficult to remove from the CN surface during water splitting [36–38]. Although various strategies such as stirring, bubbling, and/or addition of chemical agents have been proposed to regenerate the poisoned CN catalyst, while its low intrinsic quantum efficiency cannot be improved due to its rapid recombination of charge carriers [38]. Recently, Kang et al. [37] have demonstrated that carbon nanodots (C-Dots) anchored on CN surface can greatly improve the quantum efficiency (up to 2% ‘solar-to-hydrogen’ efficiency) because C-Dots possess high catalytic activity for H2O2 decomposition. However, the reported method for fabrication of CN/C-Dots composites is multi-step (at least 3 steps), time-consuming (>5 days) and energy-wasting. Subsequently, several methods have been proposed to prepare CN/C-Dots hybrids. [36,39–42] Similarly, these methods are rather complicated: in general, hydrothermal process is first used to prepare C-Dots, and then the CN/C-Dots hybrids are obtained by thermal treatment. Unfortunately, the obtained CN/C-Dots are generally nanosheets, which are prone to agglomerate and against for multiple absorption and utilization of visible light. Moreover, the C-Dots are deposited on the CN surface, forming CN/C-Dots VHSs (Fig. 1 a) that are adverse to charge transport at interface. Fig. 1c presents the electrostatic potentials along the vertical direction in CN/C-Dots VHSs, i.e., across the vdWs forces-mediated interface. A large potential barrier of 20.95 eV across the interface seriously hinders the transport of charge carriers between CN and C-Dots. In contrast, the transport of charge carriers in CN/C-Dots LHSs is much easier because the covalent bonds at the interface can serve as the transport channels of charge (Fig. 1b,d) that would expedite the catalytic reaction kinetics process and thus improve the photocatalytic activity. As is well known that the heterogeneous catalytic reaction takes place at the surface of catalyst, it is also important to enhance the surface active site exposure for fully exhibiting the intrinsic activity of catalyts. In this regard, it is highly desirable to sew C-Dots and CN to form LHSs concurrently with special morphology to realize the synergetic improvement of active surface area exposure and enhancement the charge transfer for achieving highly efficient hydrogen generation. Herein, we for the first time develop a facile, scalable, one-step, bottom-up approach to synthesis CN/C-Dots LHSs nanotubes with ultra-thin and porous wall by thermal polymerization of the supramolecular complexes composed of melamine (M), cyanuric acid (C) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CyD) with different content as starting materials. β-CyD can not only serve as a soft template to regulate morphology, but also used as carbon precursors to afford C-Dots. By incorporating a moderate amount of β-CyD into the supramolecular complexes, the obtained CN/C-Dots LHSs with ultra-thin porous tubular nanostructure can remarkably increase the accessibility of active sites and light harvesting, promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and interfacial charge transfer, and improve the mass transport, all of which greatly enhance the catalytic performance toward both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting. Specifically, we corroborate that the ultra-thin porous tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs catalyst performs well for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with spectacular photocatalytic performance of 24,760 μmol h−1 g−1 (λ > 420 nm), and excellent electrocatalytic activities toward both HER (low overpotential of 415 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (340 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2) in 1 M KOH, respectively."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and reagents,"2.1 Chemicals and reagents β-cyclodextrin (β-CyD) was produced from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory. Melamine was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cyanuric acid was purchased from Chengdu Aikeda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments. All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification."
3,Preparation of CN and Ultra-Thin tubular graphitic carbon Nitride-Carbon Dots lateral heterostructures (CN/C-Dots LHSs),"2.2 Preparation of CN and Ultra-Thin tubular graphitic carbon Nitride-Carbon Dots lateral heterostructures (CN/C-Dots LHSs) CN/C-Dots LHSs were synthesized via a directly calcination method. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of β-CyD and appropriate cyanuric acid were dissolved in deionized water (40 mL) with gentle stirring. In another beaker, a certain amount of melamine was also added to 40 mL of deionized water under stirring. The molar ratio of cyanuric acid and melamine is 1:1. After continuous stirring for 1 h, then the melamine solution and cyanuric acid solution were mixed and vigorously stirred for 12 h, followed by vaporizing the milky solvent at 90 ℃ in an oil bath drying oven. The as-obtained powder was transferred to a crucible with a lid and calcinated at 500 ℃ for 4 h in a muffle furnace with a ramp of 2.3 °C min−1. After cooled naturally to room temperature, the resulting solid was obtained and denoted as CN/C-Dots100 (ultra-thin tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs). Similarly, CN/C-Dotsx (x = 25, 50, 200 and 500 mg) were produced with the variation in the amount of β-CyD. For comparison, the pure CN was prepared by directly heating melamine and cyanuric acid under the same procedure."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The morphology and microstructure of the samples were systematically investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission (TEM, JEM-3010, Japan) electron microscopy. The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from adsorption data recorded using the Micromeritics, ASAP2020. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation source (λ = 0.154 nm). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was recorded on an IR Affnity-1 FTIR spectrometer using conventional KBr pellets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an PHI Quantera x-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with 300 W Al Kα radiation. The optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts were investigated using UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600 plus, Japan). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature on a An F-2500 fluorescence spectrometer under the excitation of 350 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were collected using a streak camera (C10910, Hamamatsu), in which the emission signal was reflected onto the streak camera by a mirror. Mott-Schottky plots for the electronic band structure, Nyquist plots and photocurrent-time curves for the charge transfer properties were measured with CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CHInstruments, Inc., Shanghai)."
5,Photocatalytic test,"2.4 Photocatalytic test Photocatalytic hydrogen generation reactions were carried out in a Pyrex top-irradiation reaction vessel connected to a closed glass gas system (LabSolar-III AG, Perfectlight Limited, Beijing). The reaction temperature was kept around 10 ℃ by a flow of cooling water during the reaction, Xe lamp (300 W) with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) as light source. Generally, 50 mg of the photocatalysts powders was dispersed in 330 mL aqueous solution containing 10 vol% methyl alcohol as sacricial electron donor and 1 wt% (with respect to the catalyst used) H2PtCl6 as a co-catalyst during the reaction. The hydrogen was analysed by a gas chromatograph (GC1690, Hangzhou JieDao) using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with high-purity nitrogen carrier gas. The linearity and accuracy of GC are 9.37 μmol/106 and 0.005%, respectively. The sensitivity, noise and drift parameters of TCD are ≥1500 mV mL/mg, ≤0.03 mV and ≤0.1 mV/30 min, respectively. For comparison, the photocatalytic tests were also conducted with similar process but without adding Pt and methyl alcohol, respectively. For cycle test, once the photocatalytic reaction of 6 h was completed, the catalysts were centrifuged, washed several times with alcohol and water, and then re-dispersed in solution with methyl alcohol and degassed in vacuum for the subsequent cycle. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) for hydrogen evolution was measured using a similar experimental setup, only with appropriate band pass filters (420 nm) to perform the water splitting experiment under the designated monochromic light. The intensity of the monochromic light was averaged at 20 mW cm−2 representative points by PLS-SXE300D photoradiometer and the active area of the reactor was approximately 16 cm2. The AQY was estimated as: AQY = number o f e v o l v e d H 2 m o l e c u l e s × 2 number o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o n s × 100 The performance of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by CN and CN/C-Dotsx were evaluated using Methyl Blue (10 mg L−1) as the decomposing organic contaminants under visible light. The visible light source for the photocatalytic reaction consists of 300 W halogen lamps. In each experiment, 10 mg of the photocatalyst powder was added to 40 mL model pollutant solution. The suspension was stirred in the dark to obtain an absorption–desorption equilibrium, 5 mL of the suspension was collected at irradiation intervals, and then the photocatalyst particles were removed by centrifugation. The absorbance of supernatant of MB is analyzed at 664 nm as measured by a TU-1910 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The degradation efficiency can be evaluated by the function Ct/C0 × 100%, where C0 is the initial concentration of organic pollutants and Ct is the degraded concentration."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical testing was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai). All the tests were measured in a traditional three-electrode system using the as-synthesized CN or CN/C-Dotsx coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm × 2 cm) as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode in 0.2 м Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8) as the reference electrode. To prepare the working electrode, all of the catalyst was ultrasonically dispersion uniformity in 1 mL ethanol containing 2 mg catalyst and 15 μL of Nafion PFSA polymer D520 (5%), FTO glass was sequentially washed with acetone, distilled water and ethanol simultaneously. The compound was sonicated for 2 h to obtain a uniform suspension, then 250 μL of the resulting uniform suspension was dropped onto the FTO side (1 cm × 1 cm) and dried at 60 ℃, generating a working electrode. For EIS Nyquist plots measurements, the frequency ranged from 100 KHz to 10 mHz with an amplitude of 50 mV. The photocurrent response of the photocatalysts was recorded as light on and off using a 300 W halogen lamp as visible light source without bias voltage. For HER activity test, line scan voltammetry (LSV) plots were executed at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 0) and presented with iR compensation. Tafel plots were received by the conversion of LSV. For OER activity test, 1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = 14) as the electrolyte, nickel foam (1 cm × 2 cm) rather than FTO glass as the catalyst carrier, which was carefully cleaned with concentrated HCl solution (PH = 3) in an ultrasound bath for 30 min inorder to remove the surface NiO layer, and then cleaned by deionized water and absolute ethanol for 15 min each time, keeping other parameters constant."
7,Computational methods,"2.6 Computational methods All our calculations were based on density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [43,44]. The exchange and correlation potentials were described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) [45]. The approach of Grimme (DFT-D3) was taken into account for improving the description of dispersion interactions [46]. The first Brillouin zone is sampled with the Monkhorst-Pack grid of 7 × 7 × 1 and 2 × 4 × 1 for vertical and lateral heterostructure, respectively. The total energy and all atomic force on each atom converged to less than 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. The cutoff energy of the plane wave basis set was 500 eV. A vacuum layer of 15 Å along the z-direction was used to avoid possible periodic interactions."
8,Results and discussion,"To realize this ingenious catalyst design (Fig. 2 ), choosing a multifunctional template is critical to construct nanotubular LHSs. In our experiments, β-CyD is selected as the dual functional material to serve as self-template for morphology control and provide carbon precursors to afford C-Dots. As is well known, β-CyD features a heptagon cavity structures with exposed hydroxyl groups around the boundary and outer surface, which create a potential opportunity to engineer the nanostructure via controlling the intermolecular interactions with other molecules. Briefly, the CN/C-Dots100 LHSs nanotubes were synthesized via a simple one-step thermal polymerization of M, C and β-CyD supramolecular precursor (the yield of the synthesis is 10%, Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the obtained CN/C-Dots100 exhibit a well-defined nanotube morphology (Fig. 3 ) with the diameter of 150–500 nm and wall thickness of about 8.0 nm. Compared to the previous reported tubular CN [10,42,47–52], the CN/C-Dots100 are perfect nanotubes with such a ultra-thin wall, to our knowledge, is the smallest one reported so far, implying a novel formation mechanism. Generally, the MC supramolecular precursor rods would result in irregular bulk, nanosheets or porous tubes with very coarse surface after thermal polymerization. Similarly, we also obtained the bulk polymer structure with large scale size of 2.0–3.0 μm (Fig. S2a) from the short rods and irregular polyhedrons of MC (Fig. S1a). Interestingly, the morphology of precursors is largely dependent on the incorporation of β-CyD, which can be attributed to the formation of hydrogen-bonded networks among melamine, cyanuric acid and β-CyD molecules (MC-β-CyD) since β-CyD features a heptagon cavity structure with exposed hydroxyl groups around the boundary and outer surface. The incorporation and quantity of β-CyD affect the strength and number of hydrogen bonds in the MC-β-CyD networks and tune the morphology of formed supramolecular aggregates. It is clear that smaller and more homogeneous polygonal precursors firstly are obtained, accompanied by the appearance of some rods (Fig. S1b) at relatively low amounts of β-CyD (~25 mg); and then more and more rods with smooth surface are formed at intermediate mounts of β-CyD (~100 mg) (Fig. 3a and Fig. S1c); finally most precursors are irregular aggregates at high mounts of β-CyD (~200 mg) (Fig. S1d). Unexpectedly, the morphologies of CN/C-Dots obtained from these precursors are very different after the same thermal polymerization. Half-open spherical nanostructures are obtained when the concentration of the β-CyD is relatively low (CN/C-Dots25, (Fig. S2b), corresponding to the first critical micelle concentration (CMC) [53]. As the concentration of the β-CyD increases to the second CMC, ultra-thin nanotube structures are formed (CN/C-Dots100), (Fig. 3b,c and Fig. S2c). With a further increase in the amount of β-CyD (~200 mg), the CN/C-Dots200 become reticulated nanosheets (Fig. S2d). Obviously, β-CyD plays a key role in the morphology control and only appropriate amounts of β-CyD can result in the ultra-thin nanotube structures. Interestingly, a large number of holes with diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nano meters can be found in the nanotube wall (Fig. 3d,e) because vast amounts of gases, such as NH3 and CO2, are spontaneously generated during the polycondensation of the MC-β-CyD supramolecular precursors. The porous ultrathin nanotube structures can significantly enlarge the surface area, highly exposed active sites, and facilitate fast mass transport. Moreover, the high-magnification TEM image in Fig. S3 shows many C-Dots are embedded in the CN skeleton frame, indicating that β-CyD can be used as carbon precursors to afford C-Dots in thermal polycondensation process, and the covalent interactions leading to micro-regional LHSs between CN and C-Dots. A high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of C-Dot crystallite (Fig. 3f) shows an interplanar spacing of 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the 〈1 0 1〉 spacing of graphitic carbon [37,42], and the C-Dots is embedded in the CN skeleton, exhibiting an intimate contact between them. These results explicitly demonstrate that the CN/C-Dots LHSs have been constructed, which is beneficial to the charge transfer at interface. The crystal and fingerprint structural analyses were further performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Fig. 4 a shows that the XRD patterns of the obtained samples exhibit very similar profiles, where the charateristic peaks located at 27.5° and 13° can be well assigned to the (0 0 2) (i.e., periodic stacking of layers along the c-axis) and (1 0 0) (i.e., in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units) planes of CN structure [54–56], respectively, revealing the structural phase of CN is still maintained after C-Dots embedding. Compared to pure CN, the peak at 13° of CN/C-Dots LHSs is gradually weakened with an increasing of β-CyD (Fig. S4a), since the implanted C-Dots break, to some extent, the periodicity of the in-plane structure. A closer characterization over the (0 0 2) peaks demonstrates an apparent broadening and shift to smaller diffraction angle could owe to the enlargement of interlayer spacing by inclusion of the C-Dots as well as the reduced thickness of the graphite structure (Fig. 4a) [11,57,58]. This crystal lattice distortion suggests the insertion of C-Dots into CN framework. At higher content of β-CyD added, a broad peak centered at about 24.7° appears (Fig. S4b), which can be ascribed to the graphite (0 0 2) interlayer stacking, reflecting the formation of lots of C-Dots [57,59]. The FT-IR spectra in Fig. 4b match well to the typical characteristic vibration modes of CN, indicating a similar skeleton structure to that of pure CN. The characteristic sharp band at 812 cm−1 is attributed to the out-of-plane bending vibration of hepatize rings [60,61]. More importantly, the stretching vibrations band at 816 cm−1 for CN shifts to a lower wavenumber of 812 cm−1 for CN/C-Dots LHSs (Fig. S5), further suggesting the incorporation of C-Dots in CN framwork and the interaction at the interface between C-dots and CN, which is in agreement with the XRD analysis. The bands in the regions of 1200–1700 cm−1 is correspond to the stretching modes of CN heterocycles in the “melon” framework, the peaks at 1245, 1323, and 1412 cm−1 are relate to the C-N bond, and that 1569 cm−1 and 1635 cm−1 correspond to the CN bond in CN heterocycles [62]. The broad band at 3000–3500 cm−1 is associated with the stretching vibrations for the uncondensed amino and hydroxyl groups [63,64], Significantly, the increased hydroxyl band at about 3400 cm−1 (especially evident for CN/C-Dots100 and CN/C-Dots200) in the FT-IR spectra of CN/C-Dots indicates the enriched hydroxyl groups of CN/C-Dots, which could be probably taken as an indicator of the incorporation of C-Dots rich in hydroxyl group derived from the pyrolysis of β-CyD into CN. Besides that, the peaks at 810, 1569 and 1635 cm−1 are gradually weakened with the increased amount of β-CyD, indicating that the excessive C-Dots will form the coating layer in CN structure [42], consistent with the XRD results. BET surface area of the ultra-thin tubular porous CN/C-Dots100 LHSs is ca. 120.4 m2 g−1, which is higher than other CN/C-Dotsx (x = 25, 50, 200 and 500) samples (Fig. 4c; Fig. S6), and is about 3.5 times higher than that of pure CN (ca. 32.5 m2 g−1) and over 12 times higher than that of the traditional bulk CN (10.0 m2 g−1) [27,65]. As expected, Fig. 4d shows that the tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs possesses larger pore volume (0.48 cm3 g−1) with respect to pure CN (0.20 cm3 g−1), and its pore size exhibits a wide distribution in the region of 5.0–120.0 nm and one peak at 8.0 nm is abruptness, further verifying the mesoporous and/or macropore structure of tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, consistent with TEM observation (Fig. 3e). The chemical states of carbon and nitrogen in the samples and intimate interaction between C-dots and CN were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectra (Fig. S7) reveal that both pure CN and tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs are mainly composed of carbon and nitrogen with a small amount of oxygen. The C/N atomic ratios for pure CN and tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs are listed in Table S1. The C/N atomic ratio for pure CN obtained from XPS is 0.75, consistent with the theoretical value for CN. As expected, a increase in the C/N ratio (0.86) on the surface of CN/C-Dots100 LHSs is obtained. Further, the higher C/N ratio for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs (0.498) than that in CN (0.456) is also confirmed via EDS analysis (Table S2). The enrichment of C element in tubular CN/C-Dots100 further suggests that C-Dots have been successfully embedded into the CN skeleton frame. As shown in Fig. 5 , high resolution XPS spectra give C 1 s and N 1 s core electron peak regions of pure CN and tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs. The deconvolution of the overlapped C 1 s peaks produces three peaks centered at 284.6 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.1 eV (Fig. 5a), which are respectively associated with carbon species in pure graphitic species (CC), C-NHx (x = 1, 2) on the edges of heptazine units and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms bonded to the aliphatic amine in the aromatic rings (CNC) [30,60,66]. In the tubular CN/C-Dots LHSs, a small new peak centered at 289.5 eV is associated with the CO bond due to the surface hydroxylation of C-Dots and adsorbed oxygen-containing groups [67–69], demonstrating the co-existence of C-Dots rich in hydroxyl groups derived from the spontaneous pyrolysis of β-CyD. This result is consistent with the FT-IR spectra analysis. The N 1 s spectrum contains four components at 398.5 eV, 399.8 eV, 400.9 eV and 404.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 5b). The sharp peak located at 398.5 eV is correspond to the sp2-hybridized aromatic in triazine rings N-(C)2 [60], and those located at 399.8 eV and 400.9 eV are respectively ascribed to bridging N atoms in N-(C)3 groups and the amino functions carrying hydrogen (NH), while the weakness peak centered at 404.2 eV is most probably attributed to the positive charge localization in heterocycles [55]. The decrease of the peak area ratio corresponding to N-(C)2 for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs could be ascribed to the incorpation of C-Dots into CN along in-plane (Table S3). Moreover, a small shift binding energy of CNC, N-(C)2 and N-(C)3 in C 1 s and N 1 s spectra of tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs with respect to pure CN (Table S4) indicates that the electron structure of CN is changed after coupling C-Dots, reflecting the intimate interaction between C-Dots and CN. C-Dots embedded in CN by inserting β-CyD into the MC supramolecular alter the optical properties and light harvesting ability of products. It is evident that as the β-CyD usage increases, the color of obtained powders changes from faint yellow to gray, and finally to black (Fig. S8). Fig. 6 a,b show the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and calculated bandgaps for pure CN and CN/C-Dots LHSs with different amounts of β-CyD. Fig. 6a shows that the typical absorption spectrum of pure CN consists of a strong intrinsic absorption band, and a progressive redshift in the absorption edge of CN/C-Dots LHSs can be observed with increasing β-CyD usage. The most important feature in Fig. 6a is that compared to pure CN, the CN/C-Dots LHSs have an additional tail-like absorption band from 470 nm to near infrared (NIR) region (800–1600 nm) and it becomes broader and stronger with increasing β-CyD usage. The increased optical absorption of LHSs in the wide visible region (≈470–800 nm) could be attributed to the synergistic effect of C-Dots and the multiple reflection of incident light within the porous tubular structure, while the NIR absorption region may be caused by the presence of abundant C-Dots [70–72], implying the intimate cantact of CN and C-Dots. Bandgaps of the samples determined from the transformed Kubelka-unk function is decreased from 2.80 eV for CN to 2.16 eV for the tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs (Fig. 6b), which is typically considered an ideal value of the bandgap for photocatalytic solar energy conversion. Besides the effect on the electronic band structure, C-Dots in CN are also expected to influence the separation and recombination of photoexcited charge carriers [41,42], which can be verified by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) decay spectroscopy. PL data for pure CN under irradiation (λ > 350 nm) display an intense fluorescence signal (Fig. 6c). This singal progressively weakens and redshifts for CN/C-Dots LHSs with β-CyD increasing in the supramolecular complexes and completely disappears when β-CyD usage exceeds 200 mg. The weakened PL intensity confirms that the insertion of C-Dots in CN inhibits the recombination of the charge carriers and promotes the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, which can be attributed that the covalent bonds at the interface between C-Dots and CN can serve as an transport channels of charges, leading to micro-regional electron delocalization between CN and C-Dots [42]. The effective separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs over CN/C-Dots LHSs can be further corroborated by TRF measurements (Fig. 6d). The average PL lifetime (τ) can be calculated by the equation: ( τ ) = ( A 1 τ 1 2 + A 2 τ 2 2 ) / ( A 1 τ 1 + A 2 τ 2 ) [65]. The fluorescent intensities of both samples decay exponentially. It is obvious that in contrast to pure CN, tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs display slow decay kinetics. Two radiative lifetimes with different amplitude can be obtained by fitting the decay spectra (Table S5). In detail, the shortest PL lifetime of 0.10 ns in pure CN increases up to 0.25 ns in tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, though its amplitude (percentage) decreases from 71.90% to 61.25%. While the longest PL lifetime is increased from 0.81 ns (28.10%) for pure CN to 1.901 ns (38.75%) for the tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs. As a result, the average life is about 1.62 ns for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, which is almost 2.56 times longer than that of pure CN (0.63 ns). It is believed that the prolonged lifetimes of charge carriers, playing a crucial role in improving the probability of their involvement in catalytic reactions before recombination, are associated with the improved electron transfer and/or electron band structure changes induced by the synergistical effect of covalent bonding at interface and ultra-thin porous nanotube structure. The electronic band structures of samples can be determined by the analysis of Mott-Schottky (M−S) plots at different frequencies of 1.0, 2.3 and 3.1 KHz, respectively (Fig. S9). The conspicuous positive slope is originated from the typical n-type characteristic semiconductor and the flat band potentials are ascertained as x-intercept in M−S plots [70,73]. Moreover, the smaller slope of the CN/C-Dots LHSs in Mott-Schottky plot suggests a higher electron donor density, which may be attributed to the embedded C-Dots. The conduction band (CB) edge and valence band (VB) edge of all samples are given in Fig. 6e, which shows that the electron band structure of CN has been altered by the strong interaction between CN and C-Dots. Interestingly, the obtained CN/C-Dots LHSs satisfy the thermodynamic conditions for photocatalytic splitting of water for hydrogen production. For example, the conduction band edge potentials of pure CN and CN/C-Dots LHSs are determined to be about −0.82 V and −0.92 V with refer to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Compared to pure CN, the 0.1 V upshift potential for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs would result in a large thermodynamic driving force in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The photocatalytic HER performance of pure CN and CN/C-Dotsx LHSs are first evaluated under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) with 1 wt% Pt as co-catalyst and 10 vol% methyl alcohol as sacrificial agent. Fig. 7 a shows that H2 evolution could be detected for all samples with the highest H2 evolution rate of 24760 μmol h−1 g−1 observed for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, which is almost 113 times of pure CN (218.5 μmol h−1 g−1) and significantly higher than those of other samples, and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) is as high as 21.2% at 420 nm. Note that the super-high photocatalytic HER rate of tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs is much higher than those of previous reported CN/C-Dots systems (Table S6) and other tubular CN materials (Table S7). It is reported that the water splitting over C-Dots modified CN evolves through a stepwise two-electron/two-electron two-step process under visible light irradiation [37]. It has been verified that pure CN catalyst possesses the photocatalytic HER activity at the initial stage of the reaction; however, the photocatalytic kinetics would be gradually stagnated because of the strong poisoning effect of produced H2O2 [36], which results in the gradual loss of the photocatalytic activity of CN. Here, introducing an appropriate amount of C-Dots could promote the H2O2 decomposition and O2 generation via chemical catalysis, inhabiting the poisons of CN nanostructures and sustaining “purged” CN for the photocatalytic generation of H2 during the reaction [36,37]. Moreover, the ultra-thin porous tubular nanostructure is highly favourable to the light penetration and absorption, separation of photogenerated carriers, and rapid cross-plane diffusion of masses (such as H2 gas). Furthermore, the H2 evolution rate of tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs remains stable over 10 h of testing (Fig. 7b). The repeatability of tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs is conducted in three consecutive runs under the same conditions as shown in Fig. S10. Little deactivation of the catalyst is detected upon repeated use and it sustains high photocatalytic H2 generation activity after 3 cycling, confirming a superior operational stability of the ultra-thin porous tubular nanostructure. Moreover, tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs also performs excellent HER activity of 2356.9 μmol h−1 g−1 with AQY of 8.67% (Fig. 7c) in the absence of co-catalyst Pt. Even more striking, in pure water (without sacrificial agent), H2 evolution rate of 305.35 μmol h−1 g−1 is observed under visible light irradiation and the quantized AQY of 2.14% is also obtained (Fig. 7d), which is much higher than those of previous reported CN-based systems. We further highlight that the optimum ultra-thin porous tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs catalyst outperforms various kinds of previously reported CN-based catalysts in different solutions system (Fig. 7e) and the specific test conditions are given in Tables S6–10. The remarkable improved catalylic hydrogen evolution activity of porous tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of multi-factors such as the unique ultra-thin porous tubular structure with large BET surface area (120.4 m2 g−1, Fig. 4c), high thermodynamically driven force with negative CB at −0.92 eV for hydrogen evolution based on a combined analysis of DRS, the Mott-Schottky plots and electronic structure (Fig. 6a,b,e and Fig. S9), and the effective charge transfer as confirmed via PL spectra analysis (Fig. 6c,d). In addition, CN/C-Dots LHSs also exhibit superior photodegradation ability for methyl blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation (Fig. S11). Compared to CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, CN/C-Dots200 display the best performance for MB degradation reactions owing to the high thermodynamically driven force with positive VB at 1.65 eV for oxidation reaction, as well as the relatively low charge transfer resistance and large BET surface area. The electrical properties of CN are expected to be dramatically altered by the synergistic effect of the embedded C-Dots and its structural topology (i.e., ultra-thin porous tubular nanostructure). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is first used to investigate the electrical conductivity of the samples, as shown in Fig. 8 a. Generally, the smaller radius of the Nyquist plots corresponds to the faster electron transfer kinetics of the redox reaction and lower charge transfer resistance (Rct, inset in Fig. 8a). Clearly, the diameter of Nyquist plot of CN decreases as the C-Dots are embedded. Among these samples, tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs affords the smallest Rct value with the faster charge-transfer ability [74–76], which would greatly promot charge migration and separation rate, in good agreement with the results of the M−S tests. The reason for the conductivity change is mainly owed to the covalent bond at the CN/C-Dot interface, serving as charge transfer channel, and the good conductivity of C-Dots. This can be further demonstrated by the transient photocurrent measurements (Fig. 8b), where tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs show an obvious enhancement of photocurrent with respect to pure CN (12 μA cm−2 vs 2 μA cm−2), indicating a greatly enhanced charge separation and excellent visible-light response ability. We next evaluate the electrocatalylic activity for hydrogen evolution in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium on pure CN and LHSs cathodes using a three electrode cell with reference to RHE. Fig. 8c shows that all samples have the activity of HER, in which tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs displays an onset overpotential of 130.0 mV versus RHE, and a low overpotential of 415.0 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, much lower than that of pure CN. To in-depth understanding the kinetics of electrode process on HER mechanism, Tafel slopes are derived from the polarization curves, i.e., the linear portion of the Tafel plots are fitted to the Tafel equation ( η = a + b log J , where η is overpotential, J is current density, a is exchange current density, and b is Tafel slope) [77,78]. Generally, three possible reaction steps for the HER in acidic electrolytes have been suggested, including a primary discharge step (Volmer reaction, Tafel slope ~120 mV dec−1), an electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction, Tafel slope ~40 mV dec−1) and recombination step (Tafel reaction, Tafel slope ~30 mV dec−1) respectively [79,80]. In Fig. 8d, a small Tafel slope of 92 mV dec−1 is observed for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs, suggesting that the release of molecular hydrogen is the rate-determining step. This illustrate that the HER process on porous nanotube structure as electrocatalyst follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Further, the OER behavior for tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs is evaluated in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH), achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with low overpotential of 340 mV for OER and small Tafel slopes of 110 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8e,f). The results demonstrate that tubular CN/C-Dots100 LHSs also have outstanding OER activity. It is worth noting that all the prepared CN/C-Dots nanostructures represent superior OER performance. Specially, CN/C-Dots200 provides an onset potential of 240 mV vs. RHE and generates a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a overpotential of 320 mV (Fig. 8e) and small Tafel slopes of 77 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8f). Different from previous reports about CN/C-Dots nanostructures, we here present a ultra-thin porous tubular CN/C-Dots LHSs nanostructure by using a facile, scalable and bottom-up strategy. The superior photo/electrocatalytic HER and OER activities of the synthesized porous tubular CN/C-Dots LHSs can be attributed to the following aspects: (I) First and foremost, the appropriate content of C-Dots inserted in CN promotes H2O2 decomposition, effectively inhibiting the poisons of CN surfaces and facilitating H2 generation. Moreover, the electrons are more prone to transfer from the CN lattice skeleton to the surface hydroxyl groups in C-Dots, which efficaciously extends conjugate electron system to realize local spatial charge separation. (II) The unique ultra-thin porous tubular structure not only suppresses the agglomeration of catalysts, leading to large exposed surface area and more surface active sites exposed, but also is of great benefit for fast mass transport, such as H2 desorption during the photo/electrocatalytic process, which greatly accelerate the reaction kinetics of HER and OER. (III) The ultra-thin tube wall significantly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated charge from the inner to the surface, improving photogenerated charge transport ability along the radial direction. (IV) The unique porous structure with embedded C-Dots can remarkably enhance light-harvesting ability due to the multiple scattering effects, and concurrently tune the electronic structure to further increase light harvesting and improve the charge migration and separation, as verified by various tests."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, for the first time, we successfully prepared ultra-thin porous tubular CN/C-Dots LHSs with outstanding photo/electrocatalytic HER and OER performances. The special nanostructure can be fabricated by a facile, scalable and bottom-up method, i.e., directly thermal treatment of the supramolecular complexes composed of M, C and β-CyD, where β-CyD as the soft template takes responsibility for the formation of C-Dots and morphology control. The prepared ultra-thin porous tubular CN/C-Dots LHSs prove to be the outstanding multifunctional catalyst for water splitting, exhibiting extremely high HER activity of 24,760 μmol h−1 g−1, much higher than that over the metal-free CN nanotube photocatalysts reported so far. Moreover, it presents excellent HER/OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 415 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 340 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The excellent catalytic performances could be attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple factors, in particular, structural topology and heterojunction. We expect that this approach can be extended for the synthesis of a variety of polymer- or C-Dots-based LHSs with desired structural topology and heterojunction to achieve enhanced performance for various applications in catalysis, solar energy utilization, and environmental issues."
