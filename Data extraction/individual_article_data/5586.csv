0,Introduction,"The development of strong ultrathin fibers from biodegradable and biocompatible natural/synthetic polymers through the use of electrospinning technique has been of considerable interest in biomedical, tissue engineering and drug delivery [1], sensors [2] and nanocomposite structures [3]. Due to the unique characteristics of electrospun fibers, e.g., high surface area to volume ratio and strength, these fibers are excellent candidates for various applications including filtration, scaffolds in tissue engineering, drug delivery, enzyme immobilization, biosensors and more important, their potential application as high-performance encapsulation system for bioactive compounds [4,5]. In the electro-spinning process, an electrically charged polymer solution is ejected as a fine jet through a narrow syringe under a high voltage differential. When the charged polymer jets are impinged on to a collector surface, rapid evaporation occurs, the jet elongates and the fibers are formed on the surface of the collector. There are many parameters which influence the electrospinning process including polymer and solution properties (molar mass, viscosity, surface tension, electrical conductivity and pH), processing conditions (applied electric voltage, tip to collector distance, feed rate) and ambient conditions (temperature and humidity) [6]. In the context of literature review, there have been several studies on the use and production of electrospun biopolymer-based ultrathin fibers from polylactic acid, pectin, chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol, whey protein concentrate with/without pullulan, nanocrystalline cellulose, barley starch, maltodextrin, soy protein and non-polymeric components like cyclodextrin [7–11] and the influence of processing conditions like influence of applied voltage, solution flow rate, needle to collector distance and needle diameter, polymer concentration, solution viscosity and conductivity, and electro-spinning solvents, and the effect of temperature and humidity on the developed film [12,13]. Electrospun fibers may be given additional functionality by incorporating functional nano-scale compounds, e.g. antibiotics [7], encapsulation of silver nanoparticles [8], antimicrobial agents like cinnamaldehyde [9], aloe vera [10] and limonene [11] into the electro-spinning solution. Such nano-structural distribution can overcome the issue of low stability of encapsulated ingredients and can improve the distribution of the functional components. Pulses are important crops in the world because of their nutritional quality. They are rich sources of complex carbohydrates, protein, vitamins and minerals [14,15]. Legume seeds and their by-products such as protein isolates have a high protein digestibility [16] which make them a good candidate for making composites, capsules and hydrogels in food packaging and biomedical industry [17]. Pea seeds contain about 22–23% proteins. The majority of pea proteins are globulins and albumins, which represent about 80% of total seed protein content. Albumins represent 18–25% and globulins 55–65% of total proteins. All globulins and some of albumins are storage proteins, which are used as nitrogen sources for the new embryos after seed germination. Major pea storage proteins, legumin, vicilin and convicilin are globulins and represent 65–85% of the total proteins [18]. Nanofiber structures of PPI may perform well for such applications. The globular nature of PPI and probably the potential lack of molecular entanglement makes producing nanofibers challenging. The addition of a spinnable polymer may be required, as was used with other proteins such as egg or soy proteins [19,20]. To the best of our knowledge, PPI has not been electrospun into nanofibers yet. This is important because the ability to electrospin nanofibers that contain PPI could combine the unique attributes of this protein with those that nanofibers offer. For example, PPI nanofibers can be envisaged as nanocapsule matrix to improve nutritional value of food products or act as a texture modifier. Also PPI nanofibers may be considered for drug delivery, tissue scaffold and antibacterial mats. In this study, strategies to make nanofibers with PPI and enhance these PPI-based fibers with changes in concentration and pH were explored. Critical issues such as whether PPI can be electrospun into nanofibers in their native, chemically or heat denatured forms; or must be electrospun with a carrier polymer were also assessed. The effect of solution pH and concentration on electrospinning, as it influences PPI solution behavior, and finally, incorporation of cinnamaldehyde as essential oil and antimicrobial agent to fabricate an antibacterial mat were examined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pea protein isolate (PPI) was obtained from Canadian Protein Co. Inc. (Canada). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with molecular weight 80,000 DA, cinnamaldehyde (CA) and Tween 20 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. (Montreal, Canada)."
3,Preparation of polymer solution for electrospinning,"2.2 Preparation of polymer solution for electrospinning Hybrid solutions of PPI and PVA were prepared using the following procedure. Stock solutions of PVA at 50 g/L and of PPI at 150 g/L both in distilled water were prepared and stirred for 1 h at 90 °C and for 10 min at room temperature, respectively, with a magnetic stirrer to make homogenous solutions. 150 g/L PPI was the maximum amount of protein which could produce a solution with proper flowability in combination with PVA for electrospinning. The two prepared solutions were mixed to make a hybrid solution and its pH was adjusted to selected levels (2, 7, 9 and 12) by adding hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as necessary and then heated to 80 °C and stirred for 30 min. These conditions of time and temperature were necessary to denature the PPI. The ratios of PPI to PVA were set at 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60: 40, 70: 30 and 80:20. Therefore, the total dry matter PPI and PVA in the mentioned solutions changed from 130 to 70 g/L; respectively. Tween 20 was added to all the solutions at 0.5% on the basis of the solution volume in order to reduce the surface tension of the water, which can cause a beaded fiber via capillary-driven instability [21]. As the first step, the solutions of 50:50 mass percent ratio of PPI: PVA were made at four pH levels of 2, 7, 9 or 12, to investigate the influence of pH on the electrospinning process. At pH 12, the product was a gel like material and not usable in this study. With the selected pH level and 50:50 (PPI: PVA), the influence of flow rate (0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5 and 2 mL/h), syringe tip to collector distance (10, 15 and 20 cm) and applied voltage (10, 15, 20 and 25 kV) were also investigated. As the next step, different concentrations of solution were prepared with the optimum pH level and the samples were evaluated. To prepare antimicrobial nanofibers, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1.5% (g/g) CA (based on total solution weight) was added to selected ratio of PPI/PVA from the previous step and the solution was emulsified using a magnetic stirrer. The morphology of nanofibers containing CA and their antibacterial characteristics were evaluated."
4,Characterization of the polymeric solution,"2.3 Characterization of the polymeric solution 2.3.1 Rheology Rheological behavior of the solutions were evaluated using a controlled strain cone and plate geometry rheometer (TA instrument, New Castel, DE, USA). The cone angle was 2° and the plate diameter was 40 mm. Temperature was set to 25 °C ± 1. Shear rate was varied from 1 to 100 s−1. The shear stress (τ) and shear rate (γ∙) data were collected. The data were fitted to the power law model (Eq. (1)): (1) τ = k γ ∙ n τ = k γ ∙ n where, τ is the shear stress (Pa), γ∙ is the shear rate (s−1), k is the consistency coefficient (Pa·sn) and n is flow behavior index. Using the values of flow behavior index and consistency coefficient, apparent viscosities were calculated using Eq. (2) for different shear rates: (2) η = k γ ∙ n − 1 where, η is apparent viscosity (Pa·s). 2.3.2 Electrical conductivity Electrical conductivity of polymer solutions were evaluated at 25 °C ± 1 using a conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo, Mississauga, On, Canada)."
5,Electrospinning,"2.4 Electrospinning The electrospinning apparatus (Invenso Inc., Istanbul, Turkey), equipped with a variable high voltage 0–30 kV power supply was used. The anode was attached to a stainless-steel needle with an internal diameter 16 μm that was connected to a 10 mL plastic syringe containing the biopolymer solutions. The syringe was placed horizontally lying on a digitally controlled syringe pump while the needle was directed toward the collector. The needle was connected to the emitting electrode of positive polarity of high voltage power supply. A positively charged jet of the polymer solution was formed from the Taylor cone that travelled through the air gap and was deposited on the collector. Electrospinning conditions of applied voltage, tip to collector distance and feed rate were fixed after selecting the proper level for the variables. For this purpose, flow rate of the solution (0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5 and 2 mL/h), applied voltage (10, 15 and 20, 25 kV), and the distance between the needle and the collector (10, 15 and 20 cm) were evaluated with the solution concentration of 50: 50 (PPI: PVA). The electrospinning process was performed in a laboratory at 25 ± 1 °C and around 40% relative humidity."
6,Characterization of electrospun nanofibers,"2.5 Characterization of electrospun nanofibers 2.5.1 FTIR spectra Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the presence of specific chemical groups in the chemical structure of selected mats using an AT-FTIR (TENSOR 37 spectrophotometer with OPUS 6.0 software, Billerica, MA, USA). For this purpose, small pieces of mat samples were directly placed on the ray exposing stage and spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000–650 cm−1 using the resolution of 2 cm−1 and 16 scans. The FTIR spectra were normalized and major vibration bands were associated with chemical groups. 2.5.2 Scanning electron microscopy Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the morphology of the elecrospun fibers. Mat samples (5 × 5 mm) were deposited on an aluminum holder. SEM photographs were taken with a Hitachi S-4700 FEG-SEM scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) at different magnifications at room temperature. The working distance was maintained between 15.4 and 16.4 mm, and the acceleration voltage used was 5 kV, with the electron beam directed to the surface at a 90° angle and a secondary electron imaging (SEI) detector. At least 30 nanofibers SEM images were randomly selected, and the diameter size distribution was determined using the Image J software."
7,Antibacterial activity of nanofibers,"2.6 Antibacterial activity of nanofibers The antimicrobial activity of the nanofibers containing PPI:PVA (50:50) and different concentrations of CA (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1.5% g/g) was evaluated using two test microorganisms: E. coli (gram-negative, ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 25922) and L. monocytogenes (gram-positive, ATCC 6538P), both non-pathogenic (obtained from a McGill microbiology lab). Cultures of E. coli and L. monocytogenes were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth at 37 °C for 24 h. The strain selection represented typical pathogenic organism groups commonly occurring in various kinds of food products. Antimicrobial activity tests were carried out using the agar disk diffusion method. Disks cut from nanofiber mats (10 mm diameter) with different concentrations of CA, previously sterilized under UV irradiation for 0.5 h, were placed on petri dishes containing Mueller–Hinton agar, previously spread with 0.1 mL of each inoculum. The bacterial culture concentration in the inoculum was 106 CFU m/L. The petri dishes were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial activity of each material was evaluated by observing the growth inhibition zone and measuring the inhibition diameter (mm). Tests were carried out in duplicate for each formulation [22]. The antibacterial activity of these fiber mats against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes was also measured by using the viable cell counting method. About 0.1 mL of each microorganism was cultivated in 100 mL of a nutrient broth solution, to give a bacterial concentration of about 1011 CFU/mL. After this, 1 mL of the bacteria/nutrient solution was added to 9 mL of sterilized nutrient broth solution (0.8%). Several decimal dilutions were performed until the bacterial concentration increased from 103 to 106 CFU/mL. Two different bacteria concentrations were selected for use, 104 and 106 CFU/mL. PPI/PVA mat containing different contents of CA were used in the antibacterial tests. The size of the fiber mats were as disks of 10 mm diameter. To perform the antibacterial testing, the respective fiber mats were put into 10 mL of the bacteria/nutrient solution incubated in a shaker at 37 °C for 12 h. After the exposure of the bacteria to fiber mats, 0.1 mL of the bacterial solution was taken out and quickly spread on a plate containing nutrient agar. Plates containing bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then the numbers of the surviving colonies were counted. These results were compared to the number of bacteria colonies of the untreated control that had not been exposed to the fiber mats [23]."
8,Statistical analysis,2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were made to evaluate the differences in average diameters of PPI/PVA electrospun nanofibers. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the data by using Statistica v.8 software. A p-value equal or <0.05 was considered significant. The Fisher's test was used to compare the average diameters of the samples.
9,Results and discussion,"Preliminary works showed that PPI in its native or denatured state did not have sufficient entanglement or interactions to support the electrospin process. Preliminary attempts to electrospin PPI at various concentrations, in native and denatured forms only yielded micro and nanoparticles but no fibers. Therefore, in the next step, PPI was blended with a water soluble electrospinnable polymer, PVA, to facilitate fiber formation. PVA was chosen as a carrier polymer matrix due to its non-toxic, biocompatibility, biodegradability and chemical resistance nature. PVA has been used in several studies to increase the spinability of the solutions [6,24]. In this study, a non-ionic surfactant 2% Tween 20 was added to the solution in order to decrease the surface tension, which increased the chance of obtaining more homogeneous nanofibers [25]. According to Vega-Lugo and Lim [26] and Yang, Li, Hong, Zhao, Qiu, Wang and Wei [27], high surface tension causes bead formation. Also it has been shown that surface tension of the solution will be differently influenced by types of solvents [27]. The addition of various surfactants into electrospinning solution decreased the surface tension of the solution. When the solutions (PPI/PVA) containing no surfactants were used, extensive amount of dropping was observed. To produce homogenous nanofibers, selection of process parameters including flow rate, voltage and distance between collector and the syringe tip, was necessary and therefore focussed in this study. The flow of the polymeric solution through the syringe needle tip influences the morphology of the electrospun nanofibers. A critical flow rate for a specific polymeric solution can produce homogeneous nanofibers. In this study, it was observed that flow rate <1 mL/h, caused the solution to be dried and block the syringe after short time, and much higher values led to dropping of the solution and forming beaded nanofibers. The latter may be due to the incomplete drying of the nanofiber jet during the movement between the needle tip and collector. Therefore, a practical value for flow rate was considered at 1 mL/h. This flow rate allowed the formation of a stable jet cone (trial and error). This finding is in agreement with some earlier research [28,29]. The presence of the droplets is also attributed to the influence of the gravitational force and surface charge density. Any change in the surface charge density may influence the nanofiber structure. A reduction in the surface charge density will allow the merging of electrospun nanofibers during their flight toward the collector. A spherical droplet is deformed into a Taylor cone and forms ultrathin nanofibers at a critical voltage with the flow of current from a high voltage power supply into the polymeric solution. This critical voltage depends on the polymer characteristics. When the voltage increases, finer nanofibers are formed due to stretching of the polymer solution and repulsion of charge within the polymer jet [30]. In this study, the lower and higher ends of the applied voltage (10 and 25 kV) resulted in the formation of beaded nanofibers. Also, the morphology of nanofibers at 15 and 20 kV didn't show significant differences. According to Haider, Haider and Kang [30], the increase in the diameter and formation of beads or beaded nanofibers with an increase in the applied voltage are attributed to the decrease in the size of the Taylor cone and an increase in the jet velocity for the same flow rate. Based on the results, 15 kV was considered as proper applied voltage. The PPI/PVA nanofibers were also affected by the distance from syringe tip to collector. It was found that at shorter distance, non-homogeneous nanofiber with some beads were formed, which might be due to the less deposition time or evaporation rate. On the other hand, at longer distance the thickness/diameter of nanofibers decreased; however this reduction was not significant. The proper tip to collector distance for PPI/PVA solution in this study was considered as 15 cm. These results are in agreement with those of Matabola and Moutloali [31] and Wang and Kumar [32]; however, there have been cases where no effect on the morphology of the nanofiber has been observed with a change in the distance between the metallic needle and collector [24,30]. Overall, it was concluded that the proper variables for electrospinning of PPI/PVA blends were flow rate 1 ml/h, voltage 15 kV and 15 cm distance from syringe tip to collector. The above parameters were maintained at these levels in order to compare the effects of pH and concentration on fiber morphology."
10,Effect of pH on solution characteristics and fiber morphology,"3.1 Effect of pH on solution characteristics and fiber morphology The shear stress (τ) versus shear rate (γ∙) data obtained from rheometer, were fitted to power Law model (Eq. (1)) and high coefficient of determination values (r2) were observed ~0.999 (Fig. 1a). Table 1 summarizes the power law parameters of PPI/PVA blends at different pH (2, 7 and 9) levels. These solutions showed flow behavior index (n) ranging between 0.724 and 0.934, indicating pseudoplastic (shear thinning) behavior. Fig. 1b shows apparent viscosities of spinning solution demonstrating a decreasing trend with an increasing shear rate. As shown in Table 1, when the pH values increased, the consistency coefficient (k) of the solution decreased (p < 0.05). According to Cho, Nnadi, Netravali and Joo [33] and Tam, Oguz, Aydogdu, Sumnu and Sahin [25] when the pH levels of soy protein solutions and lentil flour were increased, the viscosity values decreased due to unfolding of protein molecules resulting from protein molecules entanglement reduction. Dissanayake, Ramchandran and Vasiljevic [34] stated that the net charge on protein molecules increases when the pH value moves away from protein isoelectric point. Consequently, water molecules will have higher affinity to protein molecules and hydration degree may increase. On the other hand, by increasing intermolecular repulsion between protein molecules at lower shear rates, the weak interactions between molecules may be disrupted as the shear increases. Another important parameter in electrospinning is the electrical conductivity of the solution since the charged ions in the solution influence the jet formation. Raghavan, Lim, Ahn, Nah, Sherrington, Ryu and Ahn [35] explained that by increasing charge density of the solution, the tension increased in the presence of electric field and more aligned fibers obtained. Addition of ionic salts or changing pH, in case of presence of particles that could be charged, can increase the electrical conductivity. In fact by increasing electrical conductivity, the repulsion on charged particles increased resulting in inducing the critical parameters (bending instability and stretching) for fiber formation [36]. In the present study (Table 1), increasing pH of the PPI/PVA blends from 2 to 9 led to increasing in electrical conductivity (0.0481 to 0.0898 S/m). This finding is in agreement with those of Vega-Lugo and Lim [36] and Tam, Oguz, Aydogdu, Sumnu and Sahin [25] who reported the increase in their electrical conductivity values with increasing pH. The change in electrical conductivity and viscosity of the solution also had a significant effect on the diameter of the nanofibers (Table 1). From these data, it may be concluded that at electrical conductivity lower than a critical value and apparent viscosity outside a specific range, the Taylor cone formation and electrospinning cannot be well done. Also it was found that even though the electrical conductivity of the PPI/PVA at pH 2 compared to pH 9 was low, nanofibers could still be formed, indicating that conductivity was not the only factor in fiber formation. Changes in pH of the electrospinning solution are also expected to affect fiber morphology of PPI/PVA. The homogenous nanofibers could not be obtained from PPI/PVA solution at pH 7 (Fig. 2 ) which was in accordance with the results of Cho, Nnadi, Netravali and Joo [33] and Colín-Orozco, Zapata-Torres, Rodríguez-Gattorno and Pedroza-Islas [37]. The most homogeneous nanofibers were observed at pH 9. Low intensity fibers with some beads were also formed at pH 2. The diameters of electrospun fibers according to the pH level of the solution changed from 195 to 230 nm (Table 1). Based on these findings, to study the influence of concentration on nanofiber formation, all the solutions were prepared at pH 9."
11,Effect of polymer concentration on solution characteristics and fiber morphology,"3.2 Effect of polymer concentration on solution characteristics and fiber morphology Solutions with various PPI/PVA ratio were prepared at pH 9. For all samples shear thinning behavior was observed with n values lower than 1, while those of samples with 60–80% (vol/vol) PVA were high (0.864–0.975 Pa·sn) (Fig. 3a). k and apparent viscosity values showed an overall decreasing trend with increasing PVA and decreasing PPI content (Fig. 3b); however, by increasing PVA content from 50 to 80%, apparent viscosity also increased (Table 2 ). The higher viscosity in blends containing higher total polymer concentration may be due to the tendency of polymers to make hydrogen bonding. As a result the viscosity of these solutions having high bonding capacities will increase [38]. It is obvious that the polymer concentration and the viscosity of the solutions are directly correlated. In this study the lowest viscosity value was 0.120 (Pa·s) related to the 50/50 PPI/PVA blend whereas the highest was 0.330 (Pa·s) corresponding to the solution containing the highest protein content. These results are in close agreement to those of previous studies i.e. 0.34 to 2.33 Pa·s for whey protein concentrate and 0.980 to 1.680 Pa·s. with polyethylene glycol blend and lentil flour [20,25]. One reason for this difference in range may be due to using different polymers with different molecular weight, and different contents of biopolymers. As seen in Table 2, the electrical conductivity values did not change significantly by changing in solution concentration. According to Tam, Oguz, Aydogdu, Sumnu and Sahin [25] this may be due to the increase in immobility of ions in higher viscosities as a result of increasing in polymer content. In this study the electrical conductivity of the solutions with different concentrations ranged between 0.0781 and 0.0905 S/m almost in the range of those found by other authors [20,25,39]. Studying the nanofiber diameters is very important since it provides information about the uniformity of the fibers. Increase in polymer concentration influenced the nanofiber diameters significantly (Table 2). By increasing PPI content, the average diameter of the nanofibers increased from 448 nm in 20/80 (PPI/PVA) to 567 nm in 70/30 (PI/PVA). Most nanofibers had diameter around 495 nm. The average diameter for PVA solution at 5% (w/vol) was 320 nm. From Table 2, it can be observed that the most homogenous nanofibers were formed at 20/80, 30/70 and 40/60 PPI/PVA having lower standard deviations. Increasing the PPI content in solution decreased the homogeneity of nanofibers. According to Cho, Nnadi, Netravali and Joo [33], by increasing the soy protein content from 9 to 13 wt%, the average nanofiber diameters increased from 0.6 ± 0.2 to 4.5 ± 1.5 μm, which was explained by increasing the viscosity of the solution. Different types of protein, carbohydrates and carrier polymers can influence the fiber diameter [25]. Fig. 4 shows SEM images of PPI/PVA blends at different concentration ratios. It was found that the 80/20 and 70/30 PPI/PVA blends were not suitable concentrations for fiber production compared to other ratios. These images confirm that polymer concentration is very important in electrospinning process due to its effects on viscosity of the solution. Obtaining homogeneous nanofibers at higher viscosities was not possible. Shahreen and Chase [40] also expressed that very low and very high viscosity values prevent fiber production. From Table 2, it may be concluded that the proper range for fiber formation was between 0.120 and 0.253 Pa·s and by increasing the solution viscosity within this range, the diameter of the fibers increased."
12,Inclusion of CA into PPI/PVA hybrid and morphology of the encapsulation membrane,"3.3 Inclusion of CA into PPI/PVA hybrid and morphology of the encapsulation membrane Results related to the influence of concentration on nanofiber formation showed that the maximum amount of PPI in combination with the minimum PVA content which could produce homogeneous nanofibers was found in the 50/50 PPI/PVA ratio. Therefore, to prepare antibacterial nanofibers, CA incorporated into 50/50 PPI/PVA solution. Table 3 indicates the nanofiber and nanocapsule diameters. The picture of the fabricated mats and associated SEM images of nanofibers containing different concentrations of CA are shown in Fig. 5 . It was observed that the nanofibers were randomly oriented and the capsules of CA were distributed along the fibers. The capsules correspond to CA, probably formed during electrospinning process due to the rapid evaporation of the solvent (water), leading to the nanofibrous matrix that embedded capsule structure. It appears that PPI/PVA fibers and CA particles form a core-shell structure. Most probably PPI/PVA hybrid and CA particles formed separate aqueous phases in the presence of excess solvent (water) because of different exclusion volume and these phases created a dispersed system in which droplets of CA were dispersed in the aqueous PPI/PVA rich solution [11]. According to Schiraldi, Fessas and Signorelli [41] the reason for separation of particles from the surrounding dispersion medium is a thermodynamic incompatibility which is related to the surface tension effect between the particles of aqueous droplets and solvent molecules. In this situation when the solvent is converted to nanofibers during electrospinning process, and the droplets generated the characteristic small capsules around the fibers [11]. The density of the capsules increased by increasing the CA concentration. The mechanism of capsule formation on the fibers were consistent with the findings of other researchers [26,42]. These results confirm that the concentration of active component play an important role in the capsule density of the fiber. For example, addition of allyl isothiocyanate from 5 to 20% resulted in nanofibers of smaller diameter with higher capsule density [26]."
13,FTIR analysis,"3.4 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra obtained for PPI and PVA powders (Fig. 6a) and for PPI/PVA mat (50:50) and, pH 2, 7 and 9 are shown in Fig. 6b. For the PPI sample, the broad absorption in the range of 3600 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1 was assigned to OH and NH stretching vibrations. The absorptions at 1683 cm−1 and 1623 cm−1 were attributed to amide I (CO stretching) and that of 1511 cm−1 was assigned to amide II (CN stretching and C-N-H bending vibrations) of amide functional groups [6]. For PVA sample, the absorption corresponding to the OH from intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds was observed at 3550 cm−1 to 3200 cm−1. The band at 3000 cm−1 to 2840 cm−1 was attributed to CH stretching vibrations from alkyl groups and that of 1750 cm−1 to 1735 was assigned to the CO stretching of non-hydrolyzed vinyl acetate groups. The band observed around 1140 cm−1, 1150 cm−1 to 1085 cm−1 and 1461 cm−1 to 1417 cm−1 were attributed to the CO asymmetric stretching, COC and CH2 vibrations; respectively [43]. Particularly for the mats, the reaction of the PVA with PPI resulted in a considerable reduction of the intensity of the OH peaks (3600 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1) indicating a possible formation of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds between PPI and PVA. The sample prepared at pH 2 showed more reduction compared to those at pH 7 and 9. Also the OH stretching was shifted to higher wavenumbers (3225 cm−1 assigned to pH 2 and 3253 cm−1 for pH 7 and 9), whereas in relation to PPI, the shift was to lower wavenumbers. It has been reported that the almost disappearance of the band at 1219 in PPI/PVA mat specifically at pH 7 and 9, might be due to an indication of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the components [6]. The amide I intensity at 1623 cm−1 decreased by increasing pH level from 2 to 7 and 9. The other band at 1683 cm−1 corresponding to amide I group was also disappeared. The disappearance of band related to 1750 cm−1 to 1735 cm−1 in mat samples was probably indicating the presence of very limited acetate groups in the hybrid [43]. Around 2840 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1, FTIR spectra of mats revealed two important bands at 2847 cm−1 and 2912 cm−1 of CH stretching attributed to the alkyl chains. Relatively strong bands were observed in the region of 1400 cm−1 to 1100, verifying the formation of CO asymmetric stretching, COC and CH2 vibrations groups in the chemical structures of mat samples with the highest intensity in that of pH 2. Since there was no peak split in the hybrid nanofibers, it can be concluded that PPI and PVA were uniformly dispersed within the fibers. Fig. 6c shows the FTIR spectra of pure CA and PPI/PVA mat containing different concentrations of CA. As observed, the FTIR spectra of pure CA exhibited the characteristics peak at 1625 cm−1 and 1678 cm−1 corresponding to skeletal vibrations relating CC stretching in the benzene ring and the carbonyl group (CO) [9]. Also, the peak in the 1500 cm−1 to 1000 cm−1 and from 970 cm−1 to 687 cm−1 were assigned to the bending of the aromatic ring CH bonds. In the case of PPI/PVA/CA, some characteristic peaks of CA, PPI and PVA were observed confirming the presence of all three compound in the sample, while some other peaks were remarkably weakened or disappeared suggesting a host-guest interaction between CA and PPI/PVA solution [9]."
14,Antibacterial properties,"3.5 Antibacterial properties The antimicrobial activity of PPI/PVA/CA the composite electrospun mats was investigated with E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes as test microorganisms. As shown in Table 4 , samples containing 0.5, 1 and 1.5% CA exhibited an inhibition zone for the growth of L. monocytogenes, while for inhibition of E. coli growth, only 1 and 1.5% CA were effective. The diameter of the inhibition zone of PPI/PVA nanofiber mats with 1 and 1.5% CA were 15 mm and 18 mm for E. coli, and 10 mm (0.5 wt%), 12 mm (1 wt%) and 15 mm (1.5 wt%) for L. monocytogenes. In case of E. coli, increasing CA content from 1% to 1.5%, resulted in 1.44 times increase in inhibited area, while for L. monocytogenes increasing CA content from 0.5 to 1 and 1.5% increased the inhibition area by 1.44 and 1.56 times. Despite the low inactivation at the lower concentrations of CA, the number of bacterial colonies decreased even at 0.25 and 0.5% concentrations of CA (Fig. 7 ). This may suggest the PPI/PVA mats with different concentrations of CA, can result in some inactivation and retardation of the growth of gram negative and gram positive bacteria with the initial colony densities of 7 × 106 CFU/mL. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of PPI/PVA/CA nanofiber mats was positive. According to Wen, Zhu, Feng, Liu, Lou, Li, Zong and Wu [9] the electrospun polylactic acid/cinnamaldehyde/cyclodextrin nanofibrous mat exhibited better antibacterial activity than the cast films with the same mass. This was due to the better incorporation of cinnamaldehyde into polylactic acid nanofibers confirming that the electrospinning is a useful method in preparing antimicrobial nanofilms. Other researchers also revealed the higher efficiencies of electrospun nanofibers mat in encapsulation of antimicrobial agents [8,22,23]."
15,Conclusions,"Homogenous nanofibers were fabricated at 15 kV, 15 cm distance from tip to collector and 1 mL/h flow rate from hybrid solutions of pea protein isolate/polyvinyl alcohol at different ratios at pH 9. Fiber diameter increased with protein concentration. The solution ratios of 50/50, 40/60, 30/70 and 20/80 PPI/PVA could produce homogenous nanofibers in acceptable range. A novel single-step methodology for encapsulation of bioactive/antimicrobial cinnamaldehyde (CA) was developed using the hybrid PPI/PVA which could inhibit the growth of E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes and has a potential promising application for bioactive delivery in food industry."
