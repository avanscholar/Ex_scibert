0,Introduction,"The constantly growing demand for primary energy and depleting fossil fuel resources are conducive to the search for new energy solutions based on the renewable resources. Biorefineries producing energy and marketable bioproducts from biomass and organic waste are becoming increasingly popular (Dragone et al., 2020). The production of bulk chemicals from organic waste, however, faces the problem of economic viability, which is why a new spectrum of products is being sought. Therefore, more and more attention is paid to new solutions such carboxylate platform, i.e. open culture fermentation (OCF) leading to the formation of medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the molecule in the process of carboxylic chain elongation (CE). The CE process is based on the oxidation of the electron donor to acetyl-CoA and then combining it with another CoA derivative, e.g. acetyl-CoA in combination with acetyl-CoA leads to the formation of butyrate, and the combination of acetyl-CoA with butyryl-CoA leads to caproate (Spirito et al., 2014). Large species diversity in OCF systems enables fermentation in non-sterile conditions, which translates into a reduction in the capital and operating costs compared to the axenic systems. Conducting the CE via OCF competes with the methanogenesis, to overcome this issue, specific methanogenic inhibitors can be added to promote the CE. However, the high cost of chemicals makes it unprofitable. Another strategy is to run the OCF at a controlled mildly acidic pH of 5.5, which leads to the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens (Angenent et al., 2016). The production of methane is still possible by hydrogenotrophic methanogens; however, theoretically it does not cause competition for the substrate with the CE-conducting microorganisms (Grootscholten et al., 2014). The most popular MCCA described in the literature is caproate, containing 6 carbon atoms in the molecule. Caproate can be a precursor for the production of liquid fuels in the chemical conversion processes and together with other MCCAs can be widely used in various sectors of the industry (Wu et al., 2019). The extensive use of MCCAs could promote a carboxylate platform over a methane production. However, there are many restrictions on caproate production that affect production stability. The biggest problems are fluctuations in the structure of the microbiome, competitive metabolic pathways and a product toxicity (toxic effect of undissociated forms of MCCAs) (De Groof et al., 2019). Therefore, the CE process is characterized by relatively high instability, which translates into reduced economic viability of the process. The solution might be a diversification of products during the OCF; however, their generation should not be mutually exclusive. Co-production of caproate and biohydrogen may be a promising solution. Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising energy carriers of the future energy systems (Bundhoo and Mohee, 2016). During a dark fermentation (DF) microorganisms can produce hydrogen with acetate and butyrate as main by-products. The main obstacle in the biohydrogen production is the presence of hydrogen-consuming microorganisms such as methanogenic archaea, homoacetogenic bacteria or propionic fermenters (Castelló et al., 2020). Inhibition of methanogenic archaea is also a key to enhance the CE process. Hydrogen consumption for propionate production followed by its elongation to valerate and heptanoate is also unfavourable for caproate production because it affects the consumption of carbon that could be used to produce caproate. Another common microorganisms, which negatively affect biohydrogen production during the DF, are lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Their presence in the DF is typically associated with substrate competition between them and hydrogen producers. However, in a caproate-hydrogen co-production system, formation of lactate might be desirable due to its positive impact on the CE. In addition, the coexistence of CE and DF may enable the use of DF by-products to further form caproate. Therefore, the co-production of both products is not only possible but can also be mutually beneficial. Unintentional caproate production, during research related to hydrogen production using glucose as the main substrate, has been observed previously in (Ding et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the co-production of caproate and hydrogen has not been demonstrated so far as the two main OCF products. Their efficient co-production may prove to be a more cost-effective solution than seeking to maximize MCCAs generation, which often leads to destabilization of the process. The main objective of this study was to conduct long-term co-production of hydrogen and caproate as the two main anaerobic OCF products. First, batch tests were carried out using a synthetic medium consisting of nutrients and various lactate, acetate and lactose concentrations in order to investigate the potential of presence of these compounds for hydrogen and caproate co-production. Then a continuous process was carried out in the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) using acid whey as a model feedstock due its high concentration of lactose and lactate. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that shortening of a hydraulic retention time (HRT) would inhibit methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis, which would enable mutual coexistence of CE and DF as leading processes in the bioreactor."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Batch processes with a synthetic medium,"2.1 Batch processes with a synthetic medium 2.1.1 Inoculum and substrate Modified basal medium was prepared based on (Grimalt-Alemany et al., 2018) with the modification of carbon source solutions as indicated in Table 1 . The sludge was obtained from a 1 L UASB reactor located at the Poznan University ofTechnology used to conduct the CE process to MCCAs from AW as previously described in (Duber et al., 2018). Each bottle was inoculated as follows: 7.5 mL of UASB sludge was taken, centrifuged and washed with 0.9% w/v NaCl solution, then centrifuged again, resuspended in 2 mL of 0.9% w/v NaCl solution and added to the bottle. 2.1.2 Operating conditions and process configuration The batch processes were carried out in triplicate in 500 mL serum bottles capped with butyl rubber stopper and aluminium cap. The working volume was 150 mL. Initial pH was set to 5.50 ± 0.05. Nitrogen was used to flush bottles to ensure anaerobic conditions. The bottles were kept in an incubator at 30 °C for 10 days. Liquid samples were taken daily for organic acids, alcohols and lactose analysis. Gas samples for analysis of gas composition were taken after 10 days at the end of the process. The tests were carried out in two lactate to acetate ratios (4:1 and 7.5:1 mM C/mM C) for two sums of carbon source (270 and 135 mM C). All tests were executed with or without lactose (135 mM C). A control fermentation of lactose at a concentration of 135 mM C was also carried out. Detailed initial conditions are listed in Table 1."
3,Continuous processes,"2.2 Continuous processes 2.2.1 Inoculum and substrate The anaerobic sludge from Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (Poznan area, Poland) was used as an inoculum and prepared as in (Duber et al., 2018). The substrate was AW obtained from traditional quark production at the diary plant (OSM Kowalew – Dobrzyca, Poland). AW was obtained directly from the production line before reaching the collecting tank. After transporting, the AW was stored at 4 °C and used as a substrate without prior preparation. The average concentrations of lactose, lactate, acetate and ethanol in AW were 1077 mM C, 352 mM C, 37 mM C and 46 mM C, respectively. The substrate was fed into the bioreactor from a tank stored at 4 °C. 2.2.2 Operating conditions and process configuration The process was carried out in a 1 L working volume bioreactor UASB made from cylindrical plexiglass with recirculation ensuring sludge suspension as described before in (Duber et al., 2018). The process was carried out while maintaining constant temperature of 30 °C and constant pH of 5.5 with automatic correction using 2 M NaOH. The gas production was quantified using a volumetric gas flow meter (Ritter, Germany). The process was divided into two periods depending on a HRT. During the stage I, the bioreactor was operated for 44 days and the HRT was maintained at 5 days. On day 44, HRT was shortened by half. Stage II lasted from day 45 to 127."
4,Analytical techniques,"2.3 Analytical techniques Details of metabolites analysis were described before (Zagrodnik et al., 2020). Briefly, analysis of gas composition (methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen) was performed with gas chromatography with TCD detector (Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with Porapak N column). Organic acids and alcohols concentrations were monitored by gas chromatography with FID detector (Shimadzu GC-2014 equipped with Zebron ZB-FFAP column). Concentrations of lactate and lactose were monitored with high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu LC-20, Rezex ROA-Organic Acid column, RI detector). Methodology and equations for the analysis were described before (Duber et al., 2018; Zagrodnik et al., 2020)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,The composition of substrate affects the choice of metabolic pathway,"3.1 The composition of substrate affects the choice of metabolic pathway Initial conditions as well as gas and carboxylates yields are presented in Table 1. Various carboxylates were produced in the batch trials with lactate and acetate as substrates. The presence of butyrate and the detectability of hydrogen at the end of the process indicated the activity of CE. Despite the use of acetate in the CE, the final acetate concentration in the trials was higher compared to the initial one. This is due to the propionate production from lactate during which acetate was formed as a by-product (27.0 mmol C acetate per 100 mmol C propionate) (Seeliger et al., 2002). Lack of methane production indicated the inactivity of methanogens during the OCF. The change in the lactate to acetate ratio slightly affected the distribution of carboxylates in the mixture. For the 7.5: 1 ratio, propionate yields were approximately equal to the butyrate yields, while for the 4: 1 ratio, butyrate prevailed in the carboxylates mixture. Changes in the amount of total initial carbon sum did not affect the product spectrum. OCF of the control batch, containing only lactose, showed high hydrogen yields as well as the presence of butyrate and acetate which confirmed a high activity of microorganisms responsible for the hydrogen production. In addition, lactate was also detected in the effluent, indicating the activity of LAB. Low final pH (3.42 ± 0.05) probably inhibited further lactate fermentation processes. In the gas mixture methane was undetectable, which confirmed the lack of activity of methanogens during the OCF. The use of lactose as an additional carbon source, in addition to lactate and acetate, resulted in high yields of hydrogen (from 466.8 to 631.4 mL/mol Cinitial) and butyrate (from 482.9 to 603.0 mmol C/mol Cinitial). Again, no methanogen activity was observed. Interestingly, in the tests with lactose as an additional carbon source, carboxylates with an even number of carbon atoms in the molecule were promoted. Propionate yields were marginal and ranged only from 9.1 to 61.4 mmol C/mol Cinitial compared to the propionate yields between 214.0 and 291.1 mmol C/mol Cinitial for the trials, in which lactate and acetate were the only carbon sources. Change of carbon sum of lactate and acetate from 270 mM C to 135 mM C, while maintaining the same lactate to acetate ratio and the same concentration of initial lactose, did not change the spectrum of products in any case, which also suggested that the process redirection was affected by the lactose addition and not by the total available initial carbon. The decrease in the activity of propionate formation contributed to the elimination of the acetate accumulation. The observed lower final acetate concentration compared to the initial one suggested that the acetate supplied to the process was used in the CE process. The trials proved that hydrogen co-production with compounds that enabled the CE to caproate was possible. Lack of caproate production in the batch processes could be explained by short fermentation times or rapid lactate consumption to form butyrate. Lactose as an additional carbon source, besides lactate and acetate, not only influenced the production of hydrogen but also directed the production to carboxylates with an even number of carbon atoms in the molecule. It was shown that not only the presence of electron donors and acceptors affected the selection of the metabolic pathway, but also the availability of other compounds i.e. lactose. Thus, the composition of the substrate might affect the selection of metabolic pathway for the co-production of bioproducts. Waste streams such as AW which consist mainly of lactose and lactate may be a real promising substrates for the co-production of caproate and hydrogen."
7,Inhibition of methane production in the carboxylate platform led to co-production of caproate and hydrogen during continuous process,"3.2 Inhibition of methane production in the carboxylate platform led to co-production of caproate and hydrogen during continuous process Stage I lasted from day 0 to 44. The first 15 days constituted the start-up during which the total carboxylates concentration raised to 777.8 mM C (Fig. 1 A). In the following days the production of total carboxylates stabilised and their concentration ranged from 777.8 mM C to 939.5 mM C. The production of short chain carboxylic acids was predominated throughout the entire period with butyrate and acetate as the main products. Caproate was also produced from the beginning of the process, which proved the activity of microorganisms responsible for CE. However, its concentration and specificity were relatively low (maximum concentration and specificity were 144.7 mM C and 15%, respectively). The gaseous products detectable in the gas mixture were carbon dioxide and methane (the maximum production rate was 3.91 LCO2/L/d and 1.99 LCH4/L/d, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Hydrogen produced during the OCF could be immediately consumed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens as well as homoacetogenic bacteria, which could also be responsible for a high acetate concentration (Saady, 2013). Carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule were also produced, which indicated the activity of propionic fermentation, followed by the CE of propionate to valerate and heptanoate. In order to achieve high H2 yield, it is necessary to inhibit the microorganisms responsible for hydrogen consumption. One way to eliminate the effects of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is to wash them out of the system by reducing HRT (Grootscholten et al., 2013). Therefore, on day 44 the HRT was reduced to 2.5 days. Stage II lasted from day 45 to 127. The change in a HRT resulted in a redirection of the process to MCCAs. Butyrate production began to decline, while caproate production increased. The MCCAs specificity increased starting from 21% on day 45 and reaching 80% on day 95. On days 71 to 77, a temporary increase in butyrate production from 69.7 to 113.9 2 mmol C/L/d was observed. It could be due to a higher use of acetate in CE, which translated to decrease in acetate production on those days from 49.5 to 14.0 mmol C/L/d. From day 77, acetate production averaged only 11.9 ± 3.2 mmol C/L/d. Along with the increased production of caproate, ethanol production appeared in the bioreactor. In addition, the production of carboxylates with an odd number of carbon atoms in the molecule decreased (from 58.0 mmol C/L/d on day 45 to 11.7 mmol C/L/d on day 83 and 4.4 mmol C/L/d at the end of the process). From day 71, hydrogen begun to be detectable in the gas mixture. It could have been influenced by the decreased activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which translated into a decrease in the consumption of hydrogen and CO2 (Fig. 1B). On the 84th day, methane production was almost completely inhibited (0.42 LCH4/L/d). Washing out methanogens during caproate production has been observed in the literature at much lower HRT than in our studies (Grootscholten et al., 2013); however, the methanogens growth may depend on the substrate used, reactor type and operational parameters. In the following days, methane production averaged 0.24 ± 0.15 LCH4/L/d. The reduction of HRT and conducting the process at the acidic pH led to almost complete inhibition of of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. On the 92nd day, the highest productivity of caproate was achieved (176.9 mmol C/L/d) along with high hydrogen production (2.18 LH2/L/d). The electron recovery for caproate and hydrogen for day 92 of the process was 45.8%. On that day, the increase in ethanol production also ended and amounted to 80.5 mmol C/L/d. The decrease in total carboxylates and caproate production later in the process as well as the accumulation of lactate might have been affected by the toxic effect of the accumulated products. During the 50 days period (from 78 to 127 day) the average hydrogen and caproate production of 1.78 ± 0.75 LH2/L/d and 133.4 ± 17.9 mmol C/L/d was achieved, respectively. Co-production of MCCA and hydrogen from AW in one bioreactor can be an alternative to the recently proposed solution for the production of MCCA from AW by using two-stage fermentation with maximization of lactate production under thermophilic conditions and CE under mesophilic conditions (Xu et al., 2018). However, further research, in particular regarding downstream processing, is needed to achieve detailed economic viability."
8,Conclusions,"The presence of lactose in the medium along with lactate and acetate enabled the co-production of hydrogen and compounds involved in CE as well as reduced the activity of propionic fermentation. In addition, trials proved that the presence of lactose influenced CE to butyrate selection. Promising co-production of hydrogen and caproate in an OCF system was achieved from AW in the UASB reactor after shortening the HRT, during 50 days of co-production, almost no methane formation was observed."
