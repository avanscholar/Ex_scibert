0,Introduction,"Electrolyte solutions differ from other solutions in some properties such as vapor pressure, boiling temperature, freezing temperature, etc. This difference depends on the number of ions in them (Wright, 2007). An extensive review of thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions has been presented by Maribo-Mogensen et al. (2015). Calculation of phase equilibrium of hydrocarbons in the presence of electrolyte solutions is one of the most important and practical topics in chemical and petroleum engineering (Lin, 2007; Sun et al., 2019). Oil and gas reservoirs usually contain aqueous solutions, and it is important to investigate the phase equilibrium of hydrocarbon components with these solutions (Nabipour et al., 2020). Moreover, electrolyte solutions are available in many chemical processes such as desalination, wastewater treatment, extraction distillation, geological carbon storage, etc. Also, in oil and gas production, the equilibrium of the electrolyte containing system must be studied to prevent the formation of gas hydrates and corrosion and to increase the oil recovery (Lin, 2007). Dongre and Jana (2020) investigated the effect of salt removal on hydrate instability. Masoudi et al. (2005) presented a new model of precipitation salt that can be used for various hydrated salts. One method of enhanced recovery from gas condensate reservoirs is to inject methanol into the well. Therefore, it is very important to study the phase behavior between hydrocarbons with electrolyte solutions and alcohols. Electrolyte solutions are significantly more complex than other solutions. Because it has charged particles and the interaction between them is much greater than the interaction between particles in neutral solutions. Al-Anazi et al. (2002) found that alcohol was effective in removing condensate in low and high permeability cores. The salinity of the formation water at gas condensate reservoir is an important parameter when considering methanol injection to treat condensate. Adding methanol in the well to eliminate condensate causes the study of the phase behavior of systems containing hydrocarbons-water-alcohol, hydrocarbons-water-salt, water-alcohol-salt and hydrocarbons-water-alcohol-salt to be of great importance. In recent decades, there have been a lot of studies on electrolytes including experimental methods and modeling of these solutions by the equation of states (EOSs) such as Peng-Robinson (PR), statistical association fluid theory (SAFT) and, cubic plus association (CPA) or activity coefficient models (Haghighi et al., 2009; Held et al., 2012). Currently, very few studies have examined the phase behavior of complex systems that simultaneously contain hydrocarbons, water, alcohol, and salt. Riazi and Moshfeghian (2009) presented an application of a thermodynamic model based on the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) method combined with the Debye-Huckel (DH) activity coefficient model for electrolyte solutions to represent liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) behavior of systems containing oil, brine and ionic surfactants. Knickerbocker et al. (1979) experimentally examined the phase behavior of electrolyte solutions in the presence of hydrocarbons and alcohol. Negahban et al. (1986) investigated the solubility of a system consisting of electrolytes with alcohol and hydrocarbons and used the results to modify the activity model. Serpa et al. (2017) studied the solubility of carbon dioxide in a solution of brine and alcohol. They concluded that increasing the salt concentration reduces the solubility of carbon dioxide. Hence, providing an equation to predict the behavior of these mixtures remains a challenge. The high complexity and non-ideality of these compounds is the main reason for this lack. Several studies have investigated phase equilibrium for different systems. Tables 1–3 summarizes several examples of researches conducted with different systems to model phase behavior. Table 1 shows some of the studied systems on the phase behavior of water, alcohol, and hydrocarbons. Table 2 presents some of the studies performed on alcohol and brine systems and finally, Table 3 relates to researches on the fuzzy behavior of hydrocarbon, water, and salt. Despite the efforts made to study the phase equilibrium of water, alcohol, and electrolytic systems, a comprehensive analysis of these systems is missing. In this work, various equilibrium data published by previous researchers were collected, and then phase behavior of different systems including water, alcohol, and hydrocarbons was modeled using the CPA equation of state (EOS). Moreover, modified CPA EOS by DH equation was utilized for the prediction of the phase behavior of different systems containing salt. In this research, modeling was performed in both two-phase and three-phase systems. The three-phase systems consisted of a hydrocarbon liquid, an aqueous phase, and a vapor phase. The phase behavior of systems containing heavy hydrocarbons in the presence of salt was investigated using the modified CPA EOS. In this work, we tried to provide a thermodynamic equation to predict the concentration of different phases using laboratory data. These systems are very non-ideal due to the presence of water, alcohol, salt, and multiphase system. Therefore, the need for an electrolytic EOS to predict these systems is still felt. An EOS that can consider the phase behavior and solubility of systems that contain water, alcohol, salt, and hydrocarbons simultaneously. Also, an equation that considers the effect of interaction forces between ions. Despite the efforts made in the previous studies, the phase behavior of systems in which hydrocarbons, water, salt, and alcohol are present at the same time remains a challenge. Since in the discussion of enhanced condensate recovery from gas condensate reservoir, methanol injection is a tested and effective method for removing gas condensate from well column, so it is necessary to study the behavior of alcohols in the presence of hydrocarbons and brine. Gas condensate mainly contains heavy hydrocarbons which are normally liquid. Connate water in these reservoirs is considered as very salty water, therefore salt is the important component. In this research, with improving the CPA EOS with DH term, an equation is provided to achieve the composition of each phase in hydrocarbon-alcohol- brine mixture at LLE."
1,Thermodynamic model,"In this study, a flash calculation by a modified CPA EOS with the DH equation was utilized to investigate the phase equilibrium of different mixture. We first validated the CPA EOS for different systems without the presence of salt, and after ensuring the accuracy of the predictions of the CPA, we improved this equation by using the DH equation for electrolytic systems. The DH term was added to the EOS to consider the effects of ionic interactions."
2,CPA EOS,"2.1 CPA EOS CPA EOS was first introduced by Kontogeorgis et al. (1996). CPA EOS was initially used for mixtures containing water and alcohol and later used for other components such as acids, glycols, and amines (Kontogeorgis and Folas, 2009; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996). This EOS is a combination of an association and a cubic term. In this study, the SRK EOS is used for the cubic term. The CPA EOS is written in terms of the compressibility factor: (1) Z C P A = Z S R K + Z A s s o c i a t i o n where: (2) Z S R K = v v − b − a R T ( v + b ) (3) Z A s s o c i a t i o n = − 1 2 ( 1 + ρ ∂ ln g ∂ ρ ) ∑ i ∑ A i x i ( 1 − X A i ) where a is the energy parameter, b the co-volume parameter, v the molar volume, ρ the density, g the radial distribution function, x i the mole fraction of component i, and X A i the fraction of site A not bonded in molecule i. The CPA (P,V,T) EOS can be written as (Kontogeorgis et al., 1996; Macedo et al., 1990): (4) P ( T , v , x ) = − ( ∂ A / R T ∂ V ) T , n = R T v − b − a ( T ) v ( v + b ) − 1 2 R T v ( 1 + ρ ∂ ln g ∂ ρ ) ∑ x i ∑ A i ( 1 − X A i ) where a ( T ) is the energy parameter and for a pure component is calculated from equation (4) and (5): (5) a ( T ) = a 0 × α ( T ) (6) α ( T ) = [ 1 + C 1 ( 1 − T r ) ] 2 When the CPA EOS is used for mixture the parameters a and b are calculated from van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules: (7) b = ∑ i ∑ j x i x j ( b i + b j 2 ) ( 1 − l i j ) And: (8) a ( T ) = ∑ i ∑ j x i x j a i ( T ) a j ( T ) ( 1 − K i j ) Huang and Radosz (1990) provided several schematics for X A i . In this study, we used 4C schematic for water and 2B schematic for alcohol."
3,DH theory,"2.2 DH theory Peter Debye and Eric Huckel used their theory of gravity between ions. Since strong electrolytes have high solubility in the solution, the distance between ions in the strong electrolyte is less than ions in the weak electrolyte (Debye and Hückel, 1923). This increase in the concentration in strong electrolytes leads to the distribution of ions inside the solution uniformly, and electrostatic forces cause a mutual attraction between the ions with the different electrical charges. Therefore, to be aware of the solutions of the electrolyte, the potential energy has to be calculated. They assumed the solvent as a dielectric fluid without any structure and considered dissolved ions with the spherical point. Also, they have presented a model for computation of the potential due to electrostatic interactions by linearization of the Poisson- Boltzmann equation. When one or more of the electrolyte components exist inside the solution, the calculation of the fugacity of the non-electrolyte components in the aqueous phase requires improvement. The fugacity modification is performed by combining an EOS with the DH term (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 1991; Haghighi et al., 2009). DH's activity coefficient is derived from the following relationship (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 1991; Pinho and Macedo, 2002): (9) ln γ i D H = 2 A M i d m d i B 3 f ( BI 1 2 ) where M i is the pure component molecular weight (kg/mol), d i and d m , are the pure-component and salt-free mixture densities (kg/m3), and I is the ionic strength based on molality. The parameters A, B, I, and function f ( BI 1 2 ) are given by (Macedo et al., 1990): (10) f ( BI 1 2 ) = 1 + BI 1 2 − 1 ( 1 + BI 1 2 ) − 2 ln ( 1 + BI 1 2 ) (11) I = 1 2 ∑ i m i z i 2 (12) A = 1.327757 × 10 5 d m 1 2 ( η m . T ) 3 2 (13) B = 6.359696 × d m 1 2 ( η m . T ) 1 2 where η m is the salt-free mixture dielectric constant. η m is evaluated from: η m = x S F . η W where x S F and η W are the salt-free mole fraction and the dielectric constant of water."
4,Model implementation algorithm,
5,Flash calculation,"3.1 Flash calculation In this study, the flash algorithm is used to obtain mole fractions of each component in a different phase. The flash calculations are used for processes that are liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid-vapor equilibrium. The feed is entered into a flash-tank and is separated into two (VLE, LLE) or more (LLVE) streams at a constant temperature with pressure changes or in constant pressure with temperature variations. This study consists of both two types of flash. When the system is an equilibrium mixture, the calculations are stopped and the value of each component is obtained in each phase. From the thermodynamic point of view, the system becomes equilibrium when the fugacity of each component is equal in any phase. The fugacity of the vapor phase is calculated by: (14) f i V = φ i V . y i . P And by assuming ideality for the liquid phase, the fugacity of liquid is calculated by: (15) f i L = φ i l . x i . P where φ i V and φ i l represent fugacity coefficients for component i in vapor and liquid phase. y i and x i represent mole fraction of component i in vapor and liquid phase respectively and P is pressure. At the equilibrium condition we have: f i L = f i V . In electrolyte mixtures, the calculated fugacity coefficients of non-electrolyte components ( φ i ) require improvement by the DH term. This modification is done by the following (Haghighi et al., 2009): (16) ln φ i = ln φ i E O S + ln γ i D H i = 1,2 , .... , n where n is the number of non-electrolyte components. As it was mentioned earlier in this paper φ i E O S is calculated by CPA EOS. All calculations are performed in MATLAB software and the results are typically listed as absolute average deviation (AAD) defined by: (17) A A D % = ( 1 N ) ∑ i = 1 N ( y i C a l c − y i E x p y i E x p ) × 100 % where N is the number of data points, y i C a l c and y i E x p respectively, represent the calculated results and experimental value of any property, e.g., solubility or concentration, etc. Table 4 shows the values of the CPA EOS parameters. It should be noted that these values were obtained for NaCl and KCl salts by minimization of error (Folas et al., 2005, 2006)."
6,Results and discussion,"This study consists of two parts. The first part discusses systems used to validate the thermodynamic model (CPA EOS) and the second part refers to the DH application for electrolyte solutions. The first part includes systems such as water-alcohol, water-alcohol- hydrocarbon and the second part includes systems such as water-alcohol- salt, water-hydrocarbon- salt, and finally water-alcohol- hydrocarbon-salt. The modeling was performed as an equilibrium of two-phase (gas-liquid) and three-phase (gas-liquid-liquid) systems."
7,The binary systems without electrolyte,"4.1 The binary systems without electrolyte Binary systems were the first systems modeled in this paper. There are many experimental models for the water system and methanol, whose phase behavior of these systems has been investigated by researchers in the past (Hartono and Kim, 2004; Kurihara et al., 1995; Li and Englezos, 2004; Mikhail and Kimel, 1961; Soujanya et al., 2010). For this section, the data used to model this system was taken from the compilation by Gmehling and Onken (1977). Figs. 1 and 2 show the results of this simulation. Another binary system that was modeled is water and methane. Many researchers have proposed different experimental data and some of them, modeled the phase behavior of this mixture at different temperatures and pressure conditions (Chapoy et al., 2003; Culberson and McKetta, 1951; Kobayashi and Katz, 1953; Li and Englezos, 2004; Yamamoto et al., 1976). In this study, experimental data of Li and Englezos (2004) were used for modeling the mole fraction of methane in the liquid and vapor phases. The results of this simulation are shown in Fig. 3 ."
8,The multi-component systems without electrolyte,"4.2 The multi-component systems without electrolyte In this part, the multi-component systems consist of the association ingredients such as water, and alcohol was modeled by CPA EOS in the form of two and three phases. The phase behavior of these systems, as well as the calculation of the solubility of hydrocarbons in water and alcohol, has been studied by researchers about the importance of this issue in the discussion of methanol injection to increase the oil recovery from gas condensate wells and hydrate formation. Some of these studies are mentioned in Table 5 . To model the solubility of hydrocarbon(s) in the mixture of water and methanol, a set of experimental data was used. This modeling was carried out in the two-phase equilibrium conditions (VLE) for light hydrocarbon(s) and three-phase equilibrium conditions (VLLE) for heavy hydrocarbon(s). First, we started with the simplest mixture and calculated the solubility of methane in the methanol aqueous solution. For this system, experimental data were extracted from Wang et al. (2003) and Frost et al. (2014) works. The results of this modeling are shown in Figs. 4–8. As can be deduced from Figs. 4–8, the molar fractions of methane in aqueous methanol solution are very small quantities. However, the CPA EOS has predicted most of these values very well. In Fig. 4 and at high pressures, the model results are not in good agreement with the reported experimental data. This issue could be due to very small values of methane solubility and the possibility of errors in the experimental values. Also, water, alcohol, and hydrocarbon mixtures are very non-ideal systems from a thermodynamic point of view. It has always been the focus of many researchers to acquire the solubility of hydrocarbons, especially heavy hydrocarbons in water and alcohol, and the discussion of methanol injection in gas condensate wells. For this mixture, a set of experimental data was used to obtain the hydrocarbon solubility in the water and methanol mixture (Ayyalasomayajula et al., 2002; Nassar et al., 2000) The results of this simulation are reported in Figs. 9–12 . The other objective of this study is to model and obtain the solubility of light and heavy hydrocarbons in multi-component and multi-phase systems. For this purpose, the experimental data reported by Bang (2005) were used. The results of this modeling are shown in Fig. 13 for the methanol mole fraction in each phase."
9,The multi-component systems with electrolyte component,"4.3 The multi-component systems with electrolyte component The main focus of this work is the thermodynamics of an aqueous solution of strong electrolytes for multicomponent systems. In this section, we modeled several systems, which include the study of phase behavior and the amount of hydrocarbon solubility in the mixture of water and alcohol, and salt. At first, Water-alcohol-salt and water-hydrocarbon-salt systems were modeled, and then the mixture that was simultaneously included water, alcohol, salt, and hydrocarbon, was modeled. Water and alcohol are considered to be highly non-ideal materials, and for this reason, they have always been studied by many researchers especially in sciences such as chemical engineering, medicine, etc. Past results have shown that with increasing the alcohol within the brine, the salt solubility is reduced, which eventually leads to the deposition of salt (Al-Anazi, 2003). Many studies have been done on the phase equilibrium of this system in the last decades. In this study, a set of experimental data reported by Yao et al. (1999) were used for NaCl salt with methanol aqueous solution, and a set of experimental data used for KCl salt with water and methanol (Xu et al., 2018). The major salts that present in the industry and various processes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In this section, the phase behavior of different systems in the presence of these two salts has been considered and results are shown in Fig. 14 and Table 6 . In this section, the DH term was applied to CPA EOS to consider electrostatic interactions between salts and other components. At these conditions, the two-phase equilibrium of vapor-liquid equilibrium was investigated and since the salt concentration was negligible in the vapor phase, it was assumed that there is no salt in this phase. Investigating the solubility of light and heavy hydrocarbons in various solutions has always been considered by researchers in the oil and gas industry. Gas hydrate can be considered as one of the most important reasons for examining the solubility of hydrocarbons in electrolyte solutions since salts are known as hydrate inhibitors. It is also of great importance in discussing the enhanced oil recovery and gas condensate wells. For this object, a set of experimental data were used to calculate the mole fraction of hydrocarbon in equilibrium with water and electrolytes. O'Sullivan and Smith (1970) and Aasberg-Petersen et al. (1991) presented vapor-liquid equilibrium experimental data for water-NaCl-methane and these data were utilized in this work. Figs. 15–21 show the results of this modeling. At the next step, two systems including pentane, water, and salt as well as hexane, water, and salt were modeled using experimental data provided by Góral et al. (2011). Figs. 22 and 23 illustrate the results of this modeling. The solubility of hydrocarbon in a system including water, alcohol, and salt was investigated. Experimental data for these systems are rare to find, which can be attributed to difficulties that arise during the test conditions and experimental costs. Liquid-liquid equilibrium data for the normal octane solubility in the water and alcohol mixture were modeled with two concentrations 1 and 5 molal of sodium chloride salt using the modified CPA EOS. Experimental data were proposed by Negahban et al. (1986). The results of this modeling are reported in Tables 7 and 8 ."
10,Conclusion,"In this study, the phase behavior of different systems was modeled in two and three phases. Modeling was carried out in two parts of non-electrolyte and electrolyte mixtures. In the non-electrolyte systems, different systems such as water-hydrocarbons, water-alcohol, and water-alcohol-hydrocarbon were modeled with the CPA EOS. In this part, a very good agreement was observed between the results obtained from the model and experimental values. Then, different electrolyte systems were modeled by e-CPA EOS. To predict the phase behavior of electrolyte solutions, the DH term was added to the CPA EOS. This equation was presented to predict the composition of each phase in the interaction between hydrocarbons, water, salt, and alcohol. In previous researches, systems that contain all four components at the same time have rarely been studied for a variety of reasons, including the extreme complexity of these solutions or exorbitant costs of experimental tests. The results of the proposed model were satisfactory in comparison with experimental data. Finally, a mixture was modeled containing all four components of water, alcohol, hydrocarbons, and salt simultaneously. In this mixture, salt with two concentrations of 1 and 5 M was present. In this case, also, the results of this simulation were precise enough to compare with the presented experimental data. Further investigations are suggested to experimentally study the phase equilibrium of the hydrocarbon, water, salt, and, alcohol system and to compare the results with the proposed model in this study."
