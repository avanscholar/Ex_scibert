0,Introduction,"Globally, approximately 1.3 to 1.6 billion tons of food, such as fresh vegetables, fruits, bread and dairy products, are wasted in the food supply chain each year. Food waste accounts for one-third of the total annual food production, and this percentage is increasing yearly, causing a serious waste of resources and environmental pollution [1]. In Asia, particularly in China, food waste consists of approximately 56% vegetables and fruits; 34% rice and noodles; and a very small proportion of fish, meat and dairy products [1]. The moisture content of food waste can be as high as 60–90%, and the composition of the degradable portion is about 41–62% carbohydrate, 15–25% protein and 13–30% lipids [2]. Due to the characteristics of food waste (high moisture, low calorific value and unstable state), the traditional food waste treatment methods include incineration, landfilling, composting, heat treatment and use as animal feed [3]. Fermentation of food waste has been proven to be an effective treatment method that can simultaneously reduce environmental hazards and recover energy from food waste substrate [4]. There have been many studies on fermentative production of hydrogen and methane from food waste. The food waste fermentation method includes a one-stage anaerobic digestion and a two-stage co-generation of hydrogen and methane [5–8]. Many studies have investigated the co-fermentation of food waste and other biomass in order to adjust the C/N ratio of the fermentation system [9–13]. These co-fermentation methods have been shown to increase the yield of methane to a certain extent and improve the overall energy conversion efficiency; however, serious problems still exist due to the high lipid content of food waste, the slow degradation of lipids and the coating of microorganisms by lipids. After mechanical degreasing, a large amount of lipids still enters the fermentation system, easily causing the system to collapse. Pretreatment is effective for reducing inhibition by lipids and enhancing the fermentation performance. Food waste pretreatment methods can be divided into four categories, namely heat treatment; mechanical treatment, including microwave, ultrasonic, high-pressure and pulse discharge; biological treatment, including enzymatic hydrolysis and aerobic composting; and chemical treatment, including addition of acid, alkali and oxide [14]. There have been many studies on the pretreatment of food waste biomass to improve hydrogen and methane production [15–21]. The higher hydrogen and methane yields from these pretreatment methods were mainly reflected in the higher content of soluble reducing sugars. However, hydrogen and methane production via fermentation of protein and lipid components in difficult-to-degrade food waste has not often been studied, especially with respect to the fermentation of lipid components that are more difficult to dispose of. At present, there are few studies on lipid pretreatments for anaerobic digestion [22]. When 8–10 g-TVS/L of food waste was added along with 30% of floatable oil, the methane yield was the highest, reaching 573.0 mL CH4/g-TVS. However, when the floatable oil exceeded 35%, the methane yield greatly decreased due to a drop in the pH and the substantial accumulation of fatty acids. According to Meng et al. (2017), an oil concentration below 40 g/L resulted in an overall methane yield of 607.7–846.9 mL/g but when the oil concentration reached 50 g/L, the system became unstable [23]. Liu et al. (2018) extracted a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae sp. LZU10 for lipid pretreatment. The lipid degradation rate reached 39.5%-59.6% and the methane yield was increased by 41% [24]. However, the biological pretreatment step is cumbersome and lengthy. Meng et al. (2015) utilized a series or three lipase enzymes to treat animal fats and vegetable oils. The optimal pretreatment conditions were 24 h, 1000–1500 μL and 40–50 °C, improving the overall methane yield by 80.8–157.7%, 26.9–53.8% and 37.0–40.7% by three enzymes, respectively [25]. Biological enzyme treatment is a viable pretreatment method for lipid biomass; however, it is difficult to industrialize due to the high enzyme treatment cost. Li et al. (2018) found that for anaerobic digestion of mixed lipids in food waste, the overall energy conversion efficiency was highest when the ratio of substrate to inoculum was between 0.8 and 1.2, but when the ratio exceeded 1.2, fermentation was inhibited due to a drop in pH and the accumulation of small molecular fatty acids [26]. Nowadays, ozonation pretreatment, with its active high-energy oxygen atom, ozone (O3) is commonly used to treat waste with a high COD content, such as wastewater and solid waste [27,28]. A small amount of research is available on the use of ozonation pretreatment in conjunction with anaerobic digestion. Ariunbaatar et al. (2014) found that an ozonation pretreatment could promote the methane yield during anaerobic digestion; however, an ozone concentration above 0.034–0.202 g O3/g-TVS oxidized the reducing sugar in the food waste biomass, thus inhibiting fermentation [29]. Cesarod et al. (2019) showed that an ozonation treatment improved the performance and biodegradability of contaminated anaerobic digestion slurry. An ozonation concentration of 0.16 g O3/g-TVS exhibited the optimal benzo[a]pyrene degradation effect in the anaerobic digestion slurry after 11 days of fermentation [30]. However, ozonation pretreatment on degrading waste lipids for improving co-generation of hydrogen and methane have never been reported. In this study, glyceryl trioleate, a common lipid component of food waste, was used as the feedstock for dark fermentation and methanogenesis. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the effects of the ozonation pretreatment on lipid degradation; (2) determine the effects of the ozonation pretreatment on the fermentation of lipids and food waste; and (3) measure hydrogen production by dark fermentation and identify a method to improve both the methane yield and the overall energy conversion efficiency of the system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates and characterization,"2.1 Substrates and characterization In this study, the food waste used for fermentation came from the Hangzhou Environment Company, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China and was originally sourced from restaurants, school cafeterias and families in Hangzhou. The food waste was sorted, crushed and then the floatable oil was extracted. The food waste was then stored in a −20 °C refrigerator before the experiments. All the food waste biomass used for fermentation and detection was food waste with floatable oil content removed. The composition of the food waste is shown in Table 1 . The lipid substrate used in the experiment was glyceryl trioleate (CAS 122-32-7, Sigma), a common lipid component of food waste. Glycerol trioleate, a pure substrate, was easier to test the degradation products by GC–MS and analyze the degradation mechanism. The molecular formula of glyceryl trioleate is C57H104O6, the relative molecular mass is 885.43 g/mol, the density is 0.91 g/mL and the effective component is 65%. Glyceryl trioleate was stored at 2–8 °C prior to the experiment. The moisture content in the food waste was determined by heating in a 105 °C oven to a constant mass [31]. The reducing sugar content in the food waste was determined using the DNS method, and the protein and lipid components were determined using a previously described experimental method [32,33]. The organic matter and ash contents were determined by burning in a 450 °C muffle furnace for 2 h [32]. Chemical and elemental analysis, as well as heating value and COD measurements, were performed as per our previous methods [34]. The lipid components after pretreatment were determined by GC–MS (GCMS-QP 2010, Shimadzu, Japan). The microstructure of the solid substrate during fermentation was investigated by SEM (desktop microscope TM-1000, HITACHI, Japan) and FTIR (gas chromatograph–FTIR spectrometer SGE, Agilent 6890, Nicolet 5700, USA)."
3,Pretreatment,"2.2 Pretreatment Glycerol triolelate and food waste biomass were pretreated with ozone prior to fermentation. A pure oxygen source ozone generator (ECON, China) was used during the ozonation pretreatment process. Ozone was fed into a 417 mL fermentation flask through a long steel pipe (180 mm × Φ 3 mm) at a constant flow rate of 30 mL/min. The ozone concentrations were set to 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.2 and 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS. After calculation, the pretreatment time was set to 0, 1.5, 3.75, 15 and 60 min, respectively. Three sets of experimental substrates were tested: lipids; a mixture of food waste and lipids (referred to as a mixed substrate); and food waste. For the first set of experimental substrates (lipids), glyceryl trioleate (5 g-TVS) was added to the fermentation flasks. For the second set (mixed substrate), glyceryl trioleate (2.5 g-TVS) and food waste (2.5 g-TVS) were added to the fermentation flasks. For the third group (food waste), food waste (5 g-TVS) was added to the fermentation flasks. Distilled water was added to each fermentation flask to a total volume of 100 mL and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 using 1 M NaOH solution. pH value of ozonation pretreatment was set to 8.0 according to a previous study which demonstrated that ozonation pretreatment with alkalescence environment showed a better pretreatment effect for food waste [29]. The closed flasks were then exposed to different ozone concentrations. After pretreatment, the pre-processed product was stored in a −20 °C refrigerator without pH adjustment before the fermentation experiments."
4,Inocula,"2.3 Inocula The inoculum used for dark hydrogen fermentation was mixed hydrogen-producing bacteria that were separated from the activated sludge of a biogas fermenter at a farm in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The activated sludge contained various bacteria and archaea, including hydrogen-producing bacteria and methanogens. The separation method was as follows: 500 mL of activated sludge was added to a 1-L flask, placed in a high-pressure steam sterilizer (Sanyo MLS-3780, Japan) and boiled at 100 °C for 30 min. The methanogens and other microorganisms in the activated sludge were killed whereas the hydrogen-producing bacteria were retained in the form of spores. The boiled activated sludge was added to a sterilized 500-mL flask containing dark hydrogen-producing bacteria enrichment medium. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1 and then the enrichment was cultured in an anaerobic workstation (Whitley DG250, USA). After 2 days, the supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh medium. This step was repeated 3 times to enrich the mixed dark hydrogen-producing bacteria. 16S rRNA gene analysis identified the main strain of the mixed dark hydrogen-producing bacteria in the activated sludge as Clostridium butyricum [35]. The 1-L dark hydrogen-producing bacteria enrichment medium was composed of 1 g/L yeast extract, 4 g/L peptone, 20 g/L glucose, 3 g/L NaCl, 2.5 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L L-cysteine, 0.1 g/L MgCl2, 0.157 g/L FeCl2, 10 mL vitamin solution and 10 mL trace elements solution [33]. The trace elements solution was composed of 0.2 g/L CoCl2·6H2O, 0.05 g/L ZnCl2, 0.01 g/L NiCl2·6H2O, 0.01 g/L MnCl2, 0.01 g/L H3BO3, 0.01 g/L AlK (SO4)2, 0.01 g/L CaCl2 and 0.01 g/L Na2MoO4. The vitamin solution was composed of 0.02 g/L citric acid monohydrate, 0.01 g/L glutamic acid, 0.025 g/L ascorbic acid, 0.01 g/L p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.025 g/L riboflavin, 0.025 g/L creatine and 0.01 g/L folic acid. The medium was autoclaved at 121 °C in the sterilizer and then held for 20 min prior to adding the vitamin and trace elements solutions. After the sterilization was completed and the temperature was lowered, the vitamin and trace elements solutions were added to the medium. The methanogens used in this experiment were isolated from a fermenter at the Hangzhou Environment Company, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. The separated activated sludge (500 mL) was placed under anaerobic conditions for 30 d to consume the original organic matter. The pH was then adjusted to 8.0 ± 0.1. Next, 1.25 g of cellulose was added to the flask, which was then placed in the anaerobic workstation for enrichment. The enriched methanogens were obtained after 14 days. 16S rRNA analysis identified the main methanogens as Methanosarcina and Methanothrix [35]."
5,Dark-hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion,"2.4 Dark-hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion Dark-hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion batch experiments were carried out in 417 mL fermentation flasks. Dark-hydrogen fermentation batch experiments were carried out for 3 days. Anaerobic digestion batch experiments were carried out for 39 days. If the biohydrogen or biogas production rate was less than 1 mL/g-TVS/d, the dark-hydrogen fermentation stage or anaerobic digestion stage can be considered as finished, respectively. Many studies have suggested that for microalgae, kitchen waste, cassava residue and other biomass, the substrate concentration in fermentation was generally in the TVS range of 10 g/L-20 g/L [31]. When the substrate TVS concentration was lower than 10 g/L, the organic load was too low to provide sufficient nutrients level for microorganisms during fermentation. However, when the substrate concentration TVS was higher than 20 g/L, the organic load might be too high for the growth and metabolism of microorganisms [34]. Thus in this study, TVS concentration of 16.7 g/L was chosen for fermentation. Three sets of experiments were performed in triplicate. The fermentation flasks contained 100 mL of ozone-pretreated turbid liquid (corresponding to 5 g-TVS of original substrate) and 175 mL of sterile distilled water. The pH of the fermentation system was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1 using 6 M HCl and 6 M NaOH solutions. After the addition of 25 mL of enriched hydrogen-producing bacteria, the pH was readjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1. The flasks were sealed with rubber stoppers and then purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min with the flowrate of 80–100 mL/min. Next, the flasks were connected to a 1000 mL plexiglass gas collection tank to collect the generated gas, and then placed in a constant temperature water bath maintained at 35.0 ± 1.0 °C for dark fermentation. After the hydrogen production stage was complete, the subsequent residues were used in the anaerobic digestion stage. The dark hydrogen fermentation residues were inoculated with the methanogenic inoculum based on a TVS ratio (substrate to inoculum) of 1:2. The TVS ratio of 1:2 has been widely used in the batch experiment of anaerobic digestion [33]. This selected ratio ensures the presence of a slight excess of methanogens during anaerobic digestion, which then allow for the investigation of the impact of biomass pretreatment on methane fermentation. In this study, TVS of the methanogenic inoculum was 4 wt% (40 g/L). After calculation, the fermentation flasks contained 150 mL (corresponding to 2.5 g-TVS of the substrates) of hydrogen fermentation residues, 125 mL of methanogenic inoculum, and 25 mL of sterile distilled water. Also the mono-production groups contained 2.5 g-TVS of the subsrtates, 125 mL of methanogenic inoculum, and sterile distilled water added to the total volume of 300 mL. The pH of the fermentation system was adjusted to 8.0 ± 0.1 using 6 M HCl and 6 M NaOH solutions. The remaining steps were the same as the hydrogen production stage. Two anaerobic digestion groups were set up using either the hydrogen production residues (co-production group) or glycerol trioleate without hydrogen production (mono-production group). Each group was tested under the different ozone pretreatment conditions."
6,Analytical methods and calculations,"2.5 Analytical methods and calculations The gases produced during dark-hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion are mainly composed of H2, CO2 and CH4, with impurity gases, such as H2O, N2 and O2 [35]. The components of the produced gas were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The soluble metabolic products (SMPs) contained in the dark fermentation effluents were determined using GC (Agilent 7820A, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide yields obtained during the experiment were calculated based on the actual gas production and the concentrations of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. The standard temperature (273.15 K) and pressure (100 kPa) was used for biogas composition analysis. In order to facilitate comparison of their relative values in different states, it is necessary to specify a state as a criterion for comparison, which is called the standard state. All the measurements were corrected according to the standard temperature and pressure. The hydrogen and methane yields represent the ratio of hydrogen and methane production (mL), respectively, to the dry organic weight of the substrate (g-TVS) [36]. The energy conversion efficiency is defined as the ratio of the produced hydrogen and methane energy to the substrate energy [34]."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Degradation of glycerol trioleate after pretreatment and dark-hydrogen fermentation,"3.1 Degradation of glycerol trioleate after pretreatment and dark-hydrogen fermentation 1 mol of glycerol trioleate macromolecular biomass can be hydrolyzed to 1 mol of glycerol and 3 mol of oleic acid, which can be used for fermentation to produce hydrogen and methane. Additionally, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are simultaneously produced during dark-hydrogen fermentation of glycerol. The related hydrolysis reactions are as shown in Eqs. (1)–(4) [37]. The resulting small molecular fatty acids can be used by methanogens as substrates to produce methane during the second stage of anaerobic digestion [38]. (1) (2) (3) (4) Long-chain fatty acids, such as oleic acid and stearic acid, are gradually degraded via the β-oxidation pathway [39,40], as shown in Eq. (5). (5) Long - c h a i n f a t t y a c i d s → β - o x i d a t i o n H 2 + C O 2 + a c e t i c a c i d even n u m b e r o f c a r b o n L o n g - c h a i n f a t t y a c i d s → β - o x i d a t i o n H 2 + C O 2 + p r o p i o n i c a c i d odd n u m b e r o f c a r b o n Through the β-oxidation process, two carbon atoms are removed from the long-chain fatty acid each time the molecule enters the pathway. This metabolic process allows bacteria and archaea to form various metabolites. Long-chain fatty acids with even-numbered carbon atoms can be completely degraded, while the last three carbon atoms of fatty acids with odd-numbered carbon atoms will form propionic acid. During the anaerobic digestion stage, methanogens can use acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid to produce methane. Moreover, they can convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane [41]. The high-energy free radicals produced by the ozonation pretreatment can attack the chemical bonds of macromolecular carboxylic acids, thereby reducing the number of carbon atoms in oleic acid. GC–MS was used to investigate the fatty acid composition of the decomposition products of glycerol trioleate after treatment with 0.02–0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone. The products and proportions obtained after the pretreatment are shown in Table 2 . After ozonation pretreatment, the main carboxylic acid components of the oil phase were oleic acid (undegraded), hexadecanic acid (two C atoms removed) and tetradecanoic acid (four C atoms removed). Under the action of ozone and alkali (pH ~ 8.0), the high-energy free radicals induced C18 to gradually degrade to C16 and C14 via β oxidation. The ozone concentration had an obvious effect on the ozonation pretreatment. At a higher ozone concentration, the proportion of undegraded oleic acid was lower, whereas the ratio of C16 and C14 obtained by degradation was higher. This is because within the ozone range tested (0.02–0.8 g-O3/g-TVS), the higher the ozone concentration, the faster the high-energy free radicals induced the C18 reaction rate through β oxidation, and the more thorough the reaction. As such, the proportion of oleic acid decreased from 81.89% after pretreatment with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone to 21.44% after pretreatment with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone. Correspondingly, the proportions of hexadecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid increased from 12.64% and 0%, respectively, after pretreatment with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone to 30.23% and 43.84%, respectively after pretreatment with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone. The hydrolysis process was also accompanied by the degradation of glycerol trioleate. A more complete degradation process results in a more thorough hydrolysis reaction that produces glycerol, which is more favorable for producing hydrogen. Undegraded glycerol trioleate has a relatively high molecular weight, so its utilization by methanogens was slow. C18 was also degraded into C16 and C14 through the action of microorganisms, thus when the proportion of tetradecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid was higher, anaerobic digestion was better. The effects of the above pretreatment conditions were verified by the results of dark hydrogen and methane production. The yield of dark hydrogen fermentation is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Undegraded glycerol trioleate has a large molecular weight and glycerol, which can be used by the hydrogen producing bacteria, hardly existed; therefore, glycerol trioleate was difficult to be directly used by the hydrogen-producing bacteria. The unpretreated glycerol trioleate had a very low hydrogen yield of only 0.60 ± 0.06 mL/g-TVS. An increasing ozonation preretreatment concentration resulted in a gradually increased hydrogen yield and the peak hydrogen production rate in the dark fermentation process, within the tested ozone concentration range. The hydrogen yield increased from 14.63 ± 0.35 mL/g-TVS to 22.55 ± 0.86 mL/g-TVS after the pretreatment was increased from 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone to 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone. This might be due to the fact that the higher ozonation pretreatment concentration results in more complete degradation of glycerol trioleate. In addition, a higher ozone concentration results in a more complete hydrolysis process. The glycerol obtained by hydrolysis could be converted into fatty acids and hydrogen by hydrogen-producing bacteria. Moreover, after the degradation of macromolecular oleic acid to hexadecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, coating of the hydrogen-producing bacteria by lipids was also reduced; thus, the hydrogen yield of the dark hydrogen fermentation was also higher. However, the relative molecular weight of glycerol trioleate is 885.43 g/mol, while the molecular weight of glycerol is very small. When the hydrogen yield was calculated in units of mL/g-TVS, the yield was extremely low, as was the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen production. The SMPs detected in the dark hydrogen fermentation effluents of glycerol trioleate after pretreatment with different ozone concentrations are shown in Fig. 1(b). The main SMP components were acetic acid and butyric acid, with a small amount of propionic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid and caproic acid. These results are consistent with the metabolic pathways of dark fermentation bacteria [42]. The SMP concentration in the dark hydrogen fermentation effluents of glycerol trioleate without pretreatment was only 5.12 ± 0.59 mM. This was because glycerol trioleate, which had not been hydrolyzed and degraded, has a large molecular weight and the macromolecular lipids are difficult to be directly utilized by hydrogen-producing bacteria. After the ozonation pretreatment, the SMP concentration in the dark hydrogen fermentation effluents of glycerol trioleate increased. The concentration of acetic acid increased from 21.48 ± 1.26 mM to 43.10 ± 3.25 mM after pretreatment with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS and 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone, respectively. The concentration of total SMPs increased from 50.27 ± 4.03 mM to 77.24 ± 2.16 mM after pretreatment with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS and 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone, respectively. Therefore, in the tested concentration range, a higher ozone concentration resulted in a better hydrolysis and degradation effect, as well as a higher utilization degree of glycerol and an increased SMP concentration. This indicates that the ozonation pretreatment can promote the hydrolysis of glycerol trioleate and the degradation of oleic acid to a certain extent, as well as improve the substrate utilization by dark hydrogen-producing bacteria to improve the efficiency of fermentative hydrogen production. Thus, more SMPs were formed during the dark hydrogen fermentation process. The SMPs of the ozonation pretreated biomass were approximately 15 times higher than that of the unpretreated biomass during the dark hydrogen fermentation process. This is consistent with the results of the GC–MS analysis and those of hydrogen production by dark fermentation."
9,Methane production from co-production groups and mono-production groups of glycerol trioleate,"3.2 Methane production from co-production groups and mono-production groups of glycerol trioleate The methane yields from co-production groups and mono-production groups of glycerol trioleate are shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively. After approximately 39 days, methane production from both the co-production and mono-production groups did not change significantly, which signifies that the anaerobic digestion stage was complete. The methane yield from the unpretreated glycerol trioleate of the co-production group was 520.37 ± 16.22 mL/g-TVS, with the methane production rate peaking at 28.07 ± 2.18 mL/g-TVS/d on the 15th day. As the ozone concentration in the ozonation pretreatment increased from 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS to 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS, the methane yield correspondingly increased from 808.80 ± 5.50 mL/g-TVS to 946.45 ± 16.22 mL/g-TVS, respectively. Furthermore, the peak methane production rate gradually increased to 63.70 ± 5.04 mL/g-TVS/d. The methane yields and peak methane production rates of the co-production groups were higher than those of the mono-production groups under the same pretreatment conditions. Two peaks appeared in the rate curves of the co-production groups. The first peak appeared during the first 3 days and represented the utilization by methanogens of SMPs produced during the hydrogen production stage. A large amount of SMPs were produced during the hydrogen-producing stage. According to the KEGG database, carboxylic acids are degraded into small molecular acetic acid and butyric acid prior to anaerobic digestion, which is called β-oxidation [39], is a necessary procedure for macromolecular carboxylic acids to produce methane. And this metabolic pathway often takes more than 10 days with many enzymes such as CoA ligase [39]. Thus, SMPs, such as acetic acid and butyric acid, are more easily utilized by methanogens than macromolecular carboxylic acids. Therefore, acidification during hydrogen production was beneficial for increasing the methane yield and peak methane production rate. The highest concentration of SMPs after the 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone pretreatment was 77.24 ± 2.16 mM, which is why the co-production group under this pretreatment condition was the highest of the first peak. The second peak of the co-production groups and the only peak of the mono-production groups represented the gradual degradation of long-chain fatty acids into short-chain fatty acids through the β oxidation process and the subsequent utilization by methanogens. Without the ozonation pretreatment, the β oxidation process of the co-production and mono-production groups was slow. The methane yield and peak methane production rates were also lower. Excessive concentrations of macromolecular acids can hinder the fermentation process of methanogens and even inhibit their activity. As the ozone concentration increased, the ratio of hexadecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid also increased, and the macromolecular glycerol trioleate was degraded, which increased the substrate utilization capabilities of the methanogens. As a result, the peak methane production rate and methane yield increased, and the time to reach the peak methane rate gradually shortened. This is consistent with the GC–MS results. The sCOD of the anaerobic digestion effluents was measured for the 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozonation pretreated and unpretreated co-production/mono-production groups (Fig. 2(c)). According to the KEGG database, carboxylic acids are degraded into small molecular acetic acid and butyric acid prior to anaerobic digestion through β-oxidation process, which often takes more than 10 days. Solid macromolecular carboxylic acids cannot be tested by sCOD. As the lipids were gradually degraded into small molecular acids and cannot be timely utilized by methanogens due to the large amount of SMPs, the sCOD concentration gradually increased. After about 12 days, the small molecules produced by the gradual substrate degradation were utilized by the methanogens while almost no SMPs were continuously produced, causing a decrease in sCOD. Initially, the sCOD of the co-production group without pretreatment was 1140 ± 100 mg/L while that of the mono-production group without pretreatment was 580 ± 30 mg/L. As the lipids were gradually degraded into small molecular acids, the sCOD concentration gradually increased and then did not change significantly. At the end of the anaerobic digestion, the sCOD was very high at approximately 4000 mg/L. This might be due to the slow degradation of the lipids and the large number of methanogens that were coated by lipids. Due to the high concentration of lipids and the slow degradation of the feedstock, the lipids were gradually oxidized into solid fatty acids. The fatty acids accumulated and conversed into blocks, with a large amount of methanogens being coated by the blocks. The substance exchange and information transfer were seriously inhibited, therefore both the liquid and the oil phase components were not easily utilized by the methanogens [25,26], resulting in a gradual increase of sCOD and a subsequent decrease in the methane yield and peak methane production rate. The sCOD of the co-production groups were slightly higher than those of the mono-production groups. This might be due to the fact that the small molecular SMPs produced during the hydrogen production process increased the sCOD. Initially, the sCOD after the 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozonation pretreatment was 4780 ± 160 mg/L for the co-production group and 560 ± 20 mg/L for the mono-production group. As the anaerobic digestion progressed, the effluent sCOD gradually increased to approximately 5000 mg/L on day 12 and then decreased to less than 1700 mg/L at the end of the anaerobic digestion process. This was because during utilization of the small molecular acids, the small molecules produced by the gradual substrate degradation were effectively utilized by the methanogens, and almost no lipid accumulation occurred; therefore, the sCOD gradually decreased. This is consistent with the methane production results."
10,Microscopic analysis of the residual lipids and bacterial sludge mixture in the methane fermentation effluents,"3.3 Microscopic analysis of the residual lipids and bacterial sludge mixture in the methane fermentation effluents FTIR spectra were obtained for the residual lipids and bacterial sludge mixture of the methane fermentation effluents on day 39 for the co-production groups with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozonation pretreatment and without pretreatment (Fig. 3 (a)). The FTIR spectra showed the effect of the ozonation pretreatment on the composition and chemical structure of the mixed sludge at the end of the anaerobic digestion. The chemical functional groups detected before and after the pretreatment were remarkably similar. The two sludge samples showed clear peaks at 2930 cm−1, 2850 cm−1, 1555 cm−1, 1410 cm−1. The two sludge samples showed clear peaks at 2930 cm−1, 2850 cm−1, 1555 cm−1, and 1410 cm−1. The characteristic absorption peak at 1410 cm−1 represents the –CH2 shearing vibration peak, which is a characteristic absorption peak of the carbon chains in lipids or fatty acids [43]. The characteristic absorption peak at 1410 cm−1 represents the O–H stretching vibration peak, which is a characteristic absorption peak of glycerin and alcohols [43]. The peak at 1410 cm−1 was not obvious, demonstrating a thorough utilization of glycerin. The characteristic absorption peaks at 2930 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1 represent the stretching vibration peaks of –CH2 and –CH, respectively, which are the characteristic absorption peaks of the carbon chains in lipids or fatty acids. Compared with the characteristic peaks of the sludge samples without pretreatment, the absorption peak intensities for the samples with a high ozone concentration pretreatment were weakened at 2930 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1. The characteristic absorption peak at 1555 cm−1 represents the stretching vibration peak of the CO functional group [5], which is characteristic of lipids or organic acids. Compared with the characteristic peak of the sludge samples without pretreatment, the 1550 cm−1 absorption peak intensity of the samples with a high ozone concentration pretreatment was obviously weakened. The spectra show that, compared with the unpretreated sludge samples, the contents of the –CH and CO functional groups were lower than the samples with a high ozone concentration pretreatment. This is consistent with the methane production results. The treatment capacity for lipids was lower even though the number of methanogens was the same. Furthermore, a large amount of lipids remained in the fermentation system at the end of day 39 during the anaerobic digestion stage. The ozonation pretreatment promoted the gradual degradation of macromolecular glycerol trioleate into small molecular substrates. This improved utilization by methanogens, resulting in a relatively complete degradation process. SEM images were obtained for the residual lipids and bacterial sludge mixture of the methane fermentation effluents of the co-production groups with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozonation pretreatment (Fig. 3(b)) and without pretreatment (Fig. 3(c)) on day 39. The SEM images were used to compare and analyze the effects of the ozonation pretreatment on the coating of methanogens by lipids at the end of anaerobic digestion. Additionally, the effect of the ozonation pretreatment on methane production could be determined. The SEM images show that the hydrogen-producing bacteria and methanogens were rod or sphere shaped, with a length and diameter from 0.5 to 2.5 μm. The lipids were in the shape of clusters and blocks, and their surface was fluffy and rough with particle sizes from 1 to 5 μm. The solid lipids were mainly macromolecular solid fatty acid clusters that were oxidized or not degraded. In the SEM images, the sludge and minerals showed a smooth surface and a fixed geometric shape. The samples from the co-production group that had not been pretreated with ozone were closely coated with lipids. Additionally, the rod-shaped and globose microorganisms were buried in a large amount of solid fatty acids and separated from each other, and a low number of hydrogen-producing bacteria and methanogens were visible on the surface. Conversely, a large number of microorganisms, especially rod-shaped microorganisms, were visible on the surface of the ozone-pretreated co-production sludge. The amount of lipids visible on the surface was very small and the coating by macromolecular fatty acids was greatly lowered. The ozonation pretreatment was beneficial to the degradation of macromolecular lipids. It improved the lipid degradation and utilization ability of the hydrogen-producing bacteria and methanogens, resulting in a rapid fermentation process and a short lag time. Therefore, long-chain fatty acids did not easily accumulate and, thus, would not inhibit methane production. The effects of accumulation and slow degradation of solid macromolecular fatty acids on anaerobic digestion are reflected mainly in three aspects. First, macromolecular fatty acid and small molecular soluble acetic acid accumulation caused a substantial decrease in pH value, which deviated from the optimum pH value (7.5–8.0) during anaerobic digestion [33]. Second, due to the high concentration of lipids and the slow degradation of the feedstock, the lipids were gradually oxidized into solid fatty acids. The fatty acids accumulated and conversed into blocks, with a large number of methanogens being coated by the blocks. Since microorganisms were surrounded by solid fatty acids, microorganisms were difficult to contact the small molecular soluble acetic acid, which was the feedstock of anaerobic digestion, causing a decrease in methane production. Third, extensive substance transfer, energy conversion and information transmission existed between hydrogen-producing bacteria and methanogens. However, these only existed with direct contact between different microorganisms or contact between microorganisms and fermentation broth, which was the reason why the separation of microorganisms inhibit fermentation. For instance, the separation of microorganisms caused a inhibition in electron transfer [32], which was essential in anaerobic digestion, thereby strongly inhibiting the fermentation activity."
11,Hydrogen production from food waste and mixed substrate after ozonation pretreatment,"3.4 Hydrogen production from food waste and mixed substrate after ozonation pretreatment The composition of the food waste was analyzed after pretreatment with different concentrations of ozone (0.02–0.8 g-O3/g-TVS). The products and components obtained after the pretreatment are shown in Table 3 . As the ozone concentration increased, the proportion of lipids increased from 29.36% to 65.97%, while the proportion of proteins and carbohydrates decreased from 18.59% to 9.20%, and from 43.99% to 15.03%, respectively. This is a result of the oxidizing properties of ozone. Ozone can oxidize parts of proteins and carbohydrates into carbon dioxide and water, and it also has a certain degradation effect on lipids. The low ozone concentration oxidized a small amount of other organic matter while degrading the lipids, whereas the high ozone concentration oxidized a large amount of other organic matter while effectively degrading the lipids. Dark hydrogen production from food waste under different ozone pretreatment concentrations is shown in Fig. 4 (a). When the ozone concentration was 0 and 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS, the dark hydrogen yield from food waste peaked at 47.37 ± 1.25 mL/g-TVS and 48.25 ± 0.99 mL/g-TVS, respectively. However, when the ozone concentration was further increased, the hydrogen yield decreased. For example, when the ozone concentration was 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS, the hydrogen yield decreased to 14.53 ± 0.62 mL/g-TVS, which was 69.3% lower than that of the untreated food waste. The trend observed for the hydrogen yield and ozone concentration is consistent with the trend of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in food waste. This is because carbohydrates and proteins have a higher hydrogen production potential than lipids, and are the main substrates used by hydrogen-producing bacteria to produce hydrogen during dark fermentation [44]. The concentration of SMPs in the dark hydrogen fermentation effluents of food waste after pretreatment with different ozone concentrations are shown in Fig. 4(b). When the ozone concentrations were 0 and 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS, the total amount of SMPs during the dark fermentation of food waste peaked at 183.24 ± 10.97 mM and 192.03 ± 12.33 mM, respectively. When the ozone concentration exceeded 0.05 g-O3/g-TVS, the total amount of SMPs rapidly decreased, which is consistent with the hydrogen production trend. The main SMP components were acetic acid (25.55–112.33 mM) and butyric acid (11.55–51.33 mM). The presence of these two acids is consistent with the hydrogen production pathway of small molecular carbohydrates [45]. It is worth noting that SMPs first increased and then decreased with increased ozone concentration. Although the measured carbohydrate content has decreased with the trend of two acids, the food waste after degreasing also contains 28.11% of lipids. Based on the KEGG database, lipids are degraded into small molecular acetic acid and butyric acid prior to anaerobic digestion, and these lipids also converted into acetic acid and butyric acid. According to Fig. 1, more SMPs were formed during the hydrogen production of lipids with higher ozone concentration. Thus, the increase first and then decrease of SMPs with increasing ozone concentration should be due to the combined influence from carbohydrates and lipids. Along with acetic acid and butyric acid, the hydrogen-producing effluents also contained a small amount of small molecular volatile organic acids, such as propionic acid, isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid, which are the main SMPs produced during amino acid degradation [45]. These results are consistent with the dark fermentation metabolic pathway of lipids and proteins in food waste. The dark hydrogen production of the mixed substrate (food waste and lipids) under different ozone pretreatment concentrations is shown in Fig. 4(c). When the ozone concentration was increased from 0 to 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS, the dark hydrogen production of the substrate increased from 23.98 ± 0.83 to 31.44 ± 1.49 mL/g-TVS. The hydrogen production trend was the same as that of the food waste, in that when the ozone concentration was further increased, the hydrogen yield decreased. At an ozone concentration of 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS, the hydrogen yield dropped to 18.73 ± 0.66 mL/g-TVS, which was 21.9% lower than that of the unpretreated substrate. However, in contrast to the hydrogen production from food waste, the hydrogen yield from the mixed substrate after 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone pretreatment was 26.93 ± 1.11 mL/g-TVS, which was higher than that of the unpretreated group. This was because the ozonation pretreatment had a more significant effect on substrates with a higher ratio of lipids. When the lipid content was high, lipid degradation by ozone was stronger than the oxidation of the remaining organic matter; therefore, a better pretreatment effect was achieved. The SMPs in the dark hydrogen fermentation effluents of the mixed substrate after pretreatment with different ozone concentrations are shown in Fig. 4(d). When the ozone concentration was increased from 0 to 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS, the total amount of SMPs from dark hydrogen production of the substrate increased from 99.14 ± 1.26 mM to 124.25 ± 6.79 mM. When the ozone concentration exceeded 0.05 g-O3/g-TVS, the total amount of SMPs rapidly decreased, which agrees with the hydrogen yield. The main SMP components were acetic acid (37.10 ~ 58.19 mM) and butyric acid (17.43 ~ 35.22 mM), with a small amount of small molecular volatile organic acids, including propionic acid, isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid. These results are consistent with the dark fermentation metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. It is worth noting that although the 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone pretreatment exhibited the best promoting effect on hydrogen production from lipid biomass, most of the carbohydrates and proteins in the food waste with a low lipid concentration were oxidized by ozone at this concentration. Indeed, the hydrogen yield and SMP concentration decreased; therefore, indicating that it is not suitable to pretreat food waste with ozone concentrations exceeding 0.2 g-O3/g-TVS."
12,Methane production from food waste and mixed substrate after ozonation pretreatment,"3.5 Methane production from food waste and mixed substrate after ozonation pretreatment The methane yields from co-production groups and mono-production groups of food waste under different ozone pretreatment concentrations are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), respectively. Methane production from co-production groups of food waste under different ozone concentrations exhibited similar trends; however, their methane yields were different. The methane yield from the co-production group pretreated with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone was the highest, reaching 510.76 ± 8.02 mL/g-TVS, whereas the unpretreated co-production group was 498.06 ± 5.02 mL/g-TVS. Conversely, an excessively high ozone concentration (>0.05 g-O3/g-TVS) had a significant inhibitory effect on the co-production of methane from food waste. The methane yield of the co-production group pretreated with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone was the lowest at only 220.69 ± 11.27 mL/g-TVS, which was 55.7% lower than that of the unpretreated co-production group. The methane yields of the mono-production groups exhibited the same pattern, but the methane yields and production rates of the co-production groups were higher than the mono-production groups under the respective pretreatment conditions. This is because the large amount of SMPs produced during the hydrogen production stage promoted anaerobic digestion. The methane yields from co-production groups and mono-production groups of the mixed substrate under different ozone pretreatment concentrations are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. The methane yield of the mixed feedstock from the co-production group pretreated with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone was the highest, reaching 672.06 ± 6.23 mL/g-TVS, which was 20.9% higher than that of the unpretreated co-production group (555.89 ± 5.15 mL/g-TVS). Mixed substrate co-production groups pretreated with 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS and 0.05 g-O3/g-TVS ozone showed higher methane yields than the unpretreated group. However, an excessively high ozone concentration (>0.2 g-O3/g-TVS) had a significant inhibitory effect on the co-production of methane from the mixed substrate. The methane yield of the mixed substrate co-production group pretreated with 0.8 g-O3/g-TVS ozone was the lowest at 535.29 ± 10.22 mL/g-TVS, which was 3.7% lower than that of the unpretreated co-production group. Similarly, the methane yields and production rates of the co-production groups were higher than the mono-production groups under the same pretreatment conditions. By comparing methane production from the food waste and mixed substrate, it was found that the ozonation pretreatment exerted a more obvious promoting effect on the substrate with a higher ratio of lipids. With a higher lipid content, the degradation of lipids by ozone was stronger than the oxidation of other organic matter, thereby enabling a better pretreatment effect."
13,Energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen and methane co-generated from lipids,"3.6 Energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen and methane co-generated from lipids Ozone, a strong oxidant, was decomposed into radicals that react with organic substrates in two ways: directly and indirectly [46]. The direct reaction based on the radicals of ozone can destroy the easily fermentable sugar, thus resulting in a loss of biomethane production; the indirect reaction of ozone, which depends on the hydroxyl ion, caused the degradation of complex organic compounds such as lipids and proteins in FW, thus yielding a increase in the biomethane production [28]. In a previous study, ozonation was used as sludge pretreatment in order to improve the sludge stabilization by anaerobic digestion. The use of this process led to an improved COD solubilization of 60%, thus increasing the biogas production and the soluble organic matter removal efficiency during anaerobic digestion [46]. In another study, the increase in sCOD of treated substrates compared to untreated ones was higher after ozonation than after other pretreatments, probably due to the fact that the substrates used for their experiment contained a higher level of lipids and proteins [47]. However the authors did not analyze the chemical content of the substrate. And another research demonstrated that ozonation could be an attractive method for a substrate with a high content of more complex and recalcitrant organics [28]. Based on the results obtained in this study, ozonation was found to be an efficient method to enhance the methane production of lipids (Fig. 2), which can be shown by the energy conversion efficiency. Table 4 summarizes the energy conversion efficiencies and corresponding parameters of previously published research on biogas production from lipids, food waste and mixed substrates by anaerobic digestion after different pretreatments. The energy conversion efficiency was calculated using the heating values of hydrogen (242 kJ/mol), methane (801 kJ/mol), glycerol trioleate (47.46 kJ/g-TVS) and the mixed substrate of food waste and lipids (35.66 kJ/g-TVS). The dark hydrogen yield from lipids and the mixed substrate was low. Since hydrogen could only be produced by glycerin, which has a large molecular weight, the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen production was only 0.2%. However, during the dark fermentation stage the hydrogen-producing bacteria enhanced substrate degradation and acidification while producing hydrogen. This process generated a large number of short-chain volatile fatty acids that were more easily utilized by the methanogens and subsequently promoted the second stage of anaerobic digestion. The energy conversion efficiency of methane co-generation with hydrogen from lipids and the mixed substrate under their optimal pretreatment conditions reached 71.82% and 78.73%, respectively. The ozone concentration significantly affected the total energy conversion efficiency of the generated hydrogen and methane during anaerobic digestion of food waste. The total energy conversion efficiency of the mixed substrate with a 0.02 g-O3/g-TVS ozone pretreatment was 20.88% higher than that of the unpretreated substrate. However, at ozone concentrations higher than 0.05 g-O3/g-TVS, the total energy conversion efficiency gradually decreased with increasing ozone concentrations. The composition and nature of food waste and waste lipids change depending on the source area, receipt time and transportation. As such, the composition of food waste and waste lipids reported in the literature is quite different, resulting in different biogas and energy production values. However, the literature also shows that some pretreatment methods can promote lipid degradation and anaerobic digestion in order to produce biogas. Some studies have used lipase or biological treatment to degrade lipids, achieving energy conversion efficiencies between 53.8% and 61.9% [23–25]. Another study showed that the energy conversion efficiency of food waste after ozonation pretreatment was about 58.8% [29]. In this study, the ozonation pretreatment method was adopted, and the energy conversion efficiency of hydrogen and methane co-production was up to 71.8%. Furthermore, the methane yield and total energy conversion efficiency reached or exceeded those for lipids pretreated with enzymes or bacteria prior to anaerobic digestion."
14,Conclusions,"In this study, food waste and the typical food lipid, glycerol trioleate, were used as fermentation substrates. Specifically, three substrates (lipids, food waste, and a mixture of lipids and food waste) were pretreated with different ozone concentrations and then subjected to two-stage co-generation of hydrogen and methane to improve the energy conversion efficiency. After ozonation pretreatment, the hydrogen and methane yields from lipids gradually increased with the increasing ozone concentration (0.02–0.8 g-O3/g-TVS). The highest hydrogen and methane yields were 22.6 mL H2/g-TVS and 946.5 mL CH4/g-TVS, respectively, and the total energy conversion efficiency reached 71.8%. This indicates that the ozonation pretreatment of lipids is a very effective method to simultaneously increase the methane yield and energy conversion efficiency, thereby promoting the degradation of substrates and alleviating the coating of microorganisms by lipids. However, excessive ozone (≥0.05 g-O3/g-TVS) pretreatment of food waste decreased not only hydrogen yield but also methane yield, because most small-molecular carbohydrates and a part of proteins were consumed by ozone oxidization. Future research should focus on reducing the energy consumption of the ozonation pretreatment and studying ways to inhibit ozonation oxidation of small-molecular organic matter."
