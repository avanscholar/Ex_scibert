0,Introduction,"The majority of scientists now agree that the evidence for global warming and the related climate change is overwhelming and undeniable. Today about 80% of global energy demand is met by burning fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum), and this, coupled with clearing forests, has dramatically increased the amount of carbon dioxide, one of the so-called greenhouse gases, in the Earth’s atmosphere (Melis and Melnicki, 2006). Meanwhile, the increasing dependence on fossil fuels (mainly petroleum) and the continual decline of the finite global petroleum reserves have caused significant increases in prices (OPEC, 2010) and a threat of severe energy shortages in the near future (Barbosa et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2008b, 2010; Das and Veziroglu, 2001). With regard to protecting both energy security and the environment, there is an urgent need to develop lean and renewable energy sources, and efforts to achieve this are being undertaken in many countries. Among the potential alternatives, hydrogen energy has been widely recognized as an ideal and recyclable energy carrier, which could play a major role in meeting future demands (Chen et al., 2006). Hydrogen (H2) has tremendous potential as a clean, renewable energy currency, and its highest heating value of 142MJ/kg compares well with that of any other known fuel, and is compatible with combustion processes for energy conversion without producing the carbon-based emissions that contribute to global warming (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). In view of this, there is thus an urgent need to develop a sufficient and efficient supply of H2. In particular, hydrogen production through light-dependent or independent fermentative conversion of organic substrates is of great interest. Dark fermentation could convert a wide range of organic substrates into H2 at a fast production rate along with the formation of volatile fatty acids and alcohols. However, the COD removal efficiency of dark fermentation is quite low, and thus its effluents require further treatment (Chen et al., 2008c). In contrast, photo-fermentation has a high theoretical H2 yield and high COD reduction efficiency, but the economic feasibility of phototrophic H2 production could be limited by the low catalytic activity of the H2-producing enzyme (nitrogenase) and to light-limitation at high bacterial densities. Thus, improving the phototrophic H2 production rate would be a substantial step towards development of an efficient photo-fermentation process, as well as a successful integrated dark–photo-fermentation process to achieve the theoretically highest H2 yield of 12mol/molhexose (Lo et al., 2008b). This review of the current literature summarizes a comprehensive range of knowledge on biohydrogen production via photo-fermentation with an emphasis on photobioreactor design and engineering strategies that aim to enhance phototrophic H2 production."
1,Hydrogen production,
2,Conventional hydrogen production methods,"2.1 Conventional hydrogen production methods Conventional hydrogen production mainly relies on thermochemical and electrochemical processes, with the former used most frequently. Three major thermochemical H2 production approaches involve the steam reforming of natural gas, partial oxidation and coal gasification."
3,Biological hydrogen production,"2.2 Biological hydrogen production Biological H2 production methods, including water photolysis, photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation, have attracted much attention recently since they are considered the most environment-friendly ways of producing H2 (Koku et al., 2002). The biological H2 production process is sustainable and less energy intensive when compared to conventional physicochemical H2 production methods, as it is usually operated at ambient temperatures and pressures. In particular, fermentative H2 production involving microbial conversion of organic substrates into H2 by light-dependent (e.g., photosynthetic bacteria) or independent (e.g., acidogenic bacteria) metabolic pathways (Liu et al., 2009a; Lo et al., 2010) is of great interest due to the potential for producing clean energy (H2) from renewable resources (e.g., organic wastes) with an additional benefit of waste reduction. 2.2.1 Dark fermentation Many anaerobic bacteria perform hydrogen producing pathways during dark fermentation processes. For example, Clostridial species are known as classical acid producers and usually ferment glucose to butyrate, acetate, ethanol, CO2 and H2. Other anaerobic bacteria, including the species of Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium, are also known to produce hydrogen (Lo et al., 2010). The anaerobic fermentative bacteria can utilize various carbon sources to produce H2, such as glucose, starch, cellulose and sucrose. The volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetate and butyrate, are predominant soluble metabolites when the metabolic pathways are in favor of H2 formation (Fang et al., 2005). When acetic acid is the end-product, the theoretical substrate to H2 yield is 4molH2/molglucose, whereas the theoretical yield becomes 2molH2/molglucose when butyrate is the end-product (Logan, 2004). However, biohydrogen production from hyperthermophile Thermotoga neapolitana in a batch culture gives a higher H2 yield of 1.8–3.2mol-H2/molglucose (Nguyen et al., 2010). 2.2.2 Photo-fermentation Purple non-sulfur bacteria could evolve H2 through catalysis of nitrogenase under nitrogen-deficient conditions using light and organic acids as the energy and carbon source, respectively. Photosynthetic bacteria have been frequently used to produce H2, because they have a high theoretical yield and produce a relatively small quantity of by-products (mainly CO2) (Lo et al., 2010). In addition, photosynthetic bacteria can produce H2 using organic acids (e.g., acetic acid (HAc), butyric acid (HBu)) as substrate, which are the predominant soluble metabolites from dark hydrogen fermentation or other wastewater (Chen et al., 2008a). Meanwhile, the photosynthetic bacteria also produce hydrogen from non-volatile acids, such as lactate, succinate and malate, or even sugars. Hence, this raises the possibility of using photosynthetic bacteria to degrade dark fermentation effluents for further H2 production (Liu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). 2.2.3 Hybrid system using photosynthetic and dark-fermentative bacteria Production of H2 via dark-fermentation of organic wastes as well as other recyclable resources is cost-effective, pollution-free and environmentally friendly. Organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, butyric acid) are the predominant soluble metabolites from dark-H2 fermentation which can be further utilized by photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) to produce H2 at the expense of light energy (Shi and Yu, 2006). Therefore, the combination of anaerobic fermentative bacteria and PSB has been regarded as an efficient system for energy recovery from organic wastewaters (Tao et al., 2007). The theoretical maximum yield of hydrogen and HAc from dark-H2 fermentation is 4molH2/molglucose and 2molHAc/molglucose. Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can utilize organic acids (e.g., HAc, HBu) as the carbon sources and produce H2 under photoheterotrophic conditions. According to Eq. (1), the theoretical substrate to H2 yield for the photo-fermentation is 4molH2/molHAc when using HAc as the carbon source. (1) 2 CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 O 3.0 → Light Energy 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Therefore, a combination of dark-H2 (with a yield of 4molH2/molglucose when HAc is the end product) and photo-H2 fermentation can lead to a maximum theoretical hydrogen yield of 12molH2 by using 1molglucose and 12mol of H2O (Eq. 2). (2) C 6 H 1 2 O 6 + 6 H 2 O 3.0 → Light Energy 12 H 2 + 6 CO 2 Table 1 summarizes hydrogen production performance (in terms of H2 yield) by different combined systems of dark and photo-fermentation. Keasling et al. (1997) suggested that the yield of 8mol/molglucose is sufficient for economic applications. Therefore, it might be commercially viable if dark and photo-H2 production systems are combined in series to produce H2 at a higher yield and lower chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent (Keasling et al., 1997). Table 1 also shows that there is a large variation in the hydrogen yield under different integrated dark–photo-fermentation processes, ranging from 2.4 to 7.1molH2/molcarbon sources, depending on the type of species and the cultivation methods used."
4,Introduction to photosynthetic bacteria,"2.3 Introduction to photosynthetic bacteria Photosynthesis is the physicochemical process by which plants and photosynthetic bacteria convert sunlight into energy, then using this energy to synthesize organic compounds, such as carbohydrates and sugars. In plants, algae and certain types of bacteria (e.g., cyanobacteria), the photosynthetic process results in the release of molecular oxygen and utilization of carbon dioxide for the synthesis of carbohydrates (oxygenic photosynthesis) (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Other types of bacteria can use light energy to synthesize organic compounds, but do not produce oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis) (Melis and Melnicki, 2006). In these bacteria, the electron flow is cyclic and is driven by a single photosystem, producing a proton electrochemical gradient that is used to provide energy for the reduction of NAD+ by an H+ or e- in the process (Melis and Melnicki, 2006). Anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms have representatives in four phyla: purple nonsulfur bacteria (Rhodospirillaceae), green nonsulfur bacteria (Choloroflexus), purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae) and green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae). Among these, purple nonsulfur (PNS) bacteria have been the most commonly used for photo-H2 production. Bacteriochlorophylls found in photosynthetic bacteria are the primary pigments in purple nonsulfur bacteria, and different bacteriochlorophylls have different types of absorption wavelength, from 700 to 1000nm (Gloe et al., 1975). For example, bacteriochlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll b, which are structurally similar to the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, are the two types of bacteriochlorophylls found in purple nonsulfur bacteria for ATP synthesis. However, the major absorption bands for the purple nonsulfur bacteria are located at 400, 805, and 850nm. Light bands at 800 and 850nm are known to result from absorption by bacteriochlorophylls of the purple nonsulfur bacterium, while the light absorption bands around 400nm are contributed by bacteriochlorophylls and hemes (Chen et al., 2006). Bacteriochlorophylls are essential to ATP-consuming photo-H2 production, as they stimulate this process in photosynthetic bacteria."
5,The key enzymes associated with hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria,"2.4 The key enzymes associated with hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria The key enzymes that are involved in hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria are nitrogenase and hydrogenase. Photo-hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria is mainly catalyzed by nitrogenase (Gloe et al., 1975), which allows evolution of H2 in the absence of molecular nitrogen and oxygen, but with the consumption of ATP and free electrons originating from the reducing power (Miyake et al., 1999a). In the absence of N2, ammonia is not formed but H2 production continues, as shown in Eq. (3) (Akkerman et al., 2002). However, when N2 is available, ammonia is formed and product inhibition occurs (Eq 4), leading to down regulation of the activity of nitrogenase. As a result, hydrogen production is inhibited. Sufficient supply of ATP is also one of the major factors affecting the efficiency of phototrophic H2 production. The primary inhibitors for nitrogenase are molecular oxygen and ammonium. The oxygen irreversibly inhibits this enzyme. In contrast, ammonium is commonly used as a nitrogen source for the growth of photosynthetic bacteria, but when the nitrogen source concentration gets too high, the nitrogenase activity is rapidly inhibited due to product inhibition effect (Chen et al., 2008c). Therefore, the inhibition of ammonia is reversible, as the nitrogenase activity would recover when ammonium is consumed or removed. (3) 2 H + + 2 e - + 4 ATP → H 2 + 4 ADP + 4 P i (4) N 2 + 8 e - + 8 H + + 16 ATP → 2 NH 3 + H 2 + 16 ADP As indicated in Eqs. (3) and (4), ATP is required for H2 production. For photosynthetic bacteria, ATP synthesis is a light-dependent event, requiring light energy primarily at the wavelengths of 522 and 860nm (Akkerman et al., 2002). Therefore, the design of photobioreactors used for phototrophic H2 production must consider using appropriate light sources with sufficient light intensity and appropriate wavelengths to ensure efficient photo-H2 production. The hydrogenase of purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria belongs to membrane-bound uptake hydrogenases (Türkarslan et al., 2002). This enzyme is able to uptake hydrogen at low hydrogen partial pressure to reduce a relatively high potential electron acceptor. Nevertheless, the hydrogenase also allows production of little or an unmeasurable amount of hydrogen. In vitro studies show that the hydrogenase of photosynthetic bacteria is capable of both hydrogen production and consumption. However, since hydrogen production from photosynthetic bacteria is mainly attributed to nitrogenase, the hydrogen-producing activity of hydrogenase is negligible (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). It is obvious that the hydrogen uptake activity of hydrogenase is a critical factor for photoheterotrophic hydrogen production, and thus attempts to mutate the photosynthetic bacteria to eliminate their capacity for hydrogenase synthesis usually result in improved photo-hydrogen production (Kondo et al., 2002a). Also, it is known that hydrogenases are nickel enzymes, and thus limiting the availability of nickel may attenuate the synthesis of this enzyme (Koku et al., 2002)."
6,The benefits of photosynthetic bacteria for photo-hydrogen production,"2.5 The benefits of photosynthetic bacteria for photo-hydrogen production Photo-hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria was first discovered with Rhodospirillum rubrum (Gest et al., 1950). Purple nonsulfur (PNS) bacteria are regarded as the most promising microbial system for photo-H2 production, and this form of production is well documented in the literature (Chen et al., 2008a; Lo et al., 2010, 2008a). Using PNS bacteria to produce hydrogen has the following benefits: (1) Higher theoretical H2 yield. (2) Lack of O2-evolving activity, thereby minimizing the problem of O2 inhibition. (3) Ability to use wide spectrum of light between 400 and 900nm (Chen et al., 2006). (4) Ability to utilize volatile organic acid originating from dark-fermentation or other wastewater treatment (Liu et al., 2009a,b,c), and thus the process can be integrated with dark fermentation to achieve a high H2 yield."
7,Medium composition and cultivation conditions for photosynthetic bacteria,
8,Carbon sources,"3.1 Carbon sources The carbon substrates are usually the most critical factors affecting the kinetics of cell growth and photo-hydrogen production (Chen and Chang, 2006a; Fang et al., 2005). PNS bacteria are able to utilize a wide variety of substrates as carbon and nitrogen sources. A majority of carbon sources are used for cell growth, with only the minority suitable for photo-hydrogen production. The main reason is the photo-hydrogen production performance may differ according to the different metabolic pathways of photosynthetic bacteria. The most commonly used carbon sources for photo-H2 production are the dominant soluble metabolites produced from dark H2 fermentation, such as acetate, butyrate, propionate, and lactate (Barbosa et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2010). The performance of photo-fermentation can be evaluated by two frequently used parameters. The first one is the hydrogen production rate, which represents the kinetics of H2 production. The second one is the substrate to H2 yield, which is defined as the ratio of the actual photo-hydrogen production to the maximum theoretical photo-hydrogen production resulting from complete conversion of the carbon substrates to H2 and CO2, according to the Eqs. (5)–(8): (5) Lactate : C 3 H 6 O 3 + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 3 CO 2 (6) Malate : C 4 H 6 O 5 + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 4 CO 2 (7) Butyrate : C 4 H 8 O 2 + 6 H 2 O → 10 H 2 + 4 CO 2 (8) Acetate : C 2 H 4 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 Table 2 summarizes the dependence of the performance of phototrophic H2 production on the type of carbon sources used. It shows that a wide range of carbon sources were used to produce H2 via photo-fermentation with different photosynthetic bacteria, and that some of the carbon substrates are very effective, achieving over 70% theoretical yield. For example, Rhodopseudomonas palustris P4 could convert acetate into H2 at a yield of 60–70% (Oh et al., 2004). Moreover, using succinate as carbon source, Rhodobacter sphaeroides RV was able to obtain a 75% H2 yield (Tsygankov et al., 1994). Lactate was also utilized for H2 production by Rhodobacter capsulatus B10, attaining a very high H2 overall production rate of 120mll−1 h−1 (Tsygankov et al., 1998)."
9,Nitrogen sources,"3.2 Nitrogen sources H2 production from photosynthetic bacteria is primarily mediated by nitrogenase, whose activity is strongly inhibited when an excess amount of NH 4 + ions is present (Chen et al., 2008b; Koku et al., 2002), and thus the type and concentration of nitrogen source is critical to the efficiency of photo-H2 production. Lee et al. (2002) demonstrated that wastewater that contained a small amount of ammonia was more appropriate for photo-H2 production than that with a higher ammonia concentration. However, Chen et al. (2008c) also showed that ammonium is a preferable nitrogen source for the growth of PSB, as the addition of a small quantity of NH 4 + ions could enhance photo-H2 production. Carbohydrate-rich wastewaters are widely used for dark-hydrogen fermentation, and the resulting waste, which could be used to feed the photo-fermentation system, usually contains a large amount of NH 4 + ions, leading to negative effects on the performance of photo-H2 production. Hence, selective optimization of nitrogen source concentration is essential for successful operation of the phototrophic reactor in the integrated dark–photo-fermentation process (Lo et al., 2008b). In contrast to NH 4 + ions, glutamate seems to have less of an inhibitory effect on nitrogenase, and thus is frequently used as the nitrogen source for photo-H2 production (Chen and Chang, 2006b; Koku et al., 2002). Shi and Yu (2005a) also reported that glutamate was readily used by R. capsulate as a nitrogen source for improving photo-H2 production from mixed VFAs. However, glutamate is more expensive than NH4Cl, thereby using glutamate as the nitrogen source may increase the cost of photo H2 production. Alternatively, trying to lower the concentration of NH 4 + in the medium to a non-inhibitory level for photo-fermentation might be a good strategy in practical applications."
10,Effects of environmental factors on photo-hydrogen production,"3.3 Effects of environmental factors on photo-hydrogen production 3.3.1 Co-factors Molybdenum and iron are the important co-factors for the synthesis of nitrogenase (Koku et al., 2002), and thus an appropriate supply of these ions in the medium may also play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of phototrophic H2 production. Krahn et al. (1996) showed that higher photo-hydrogen production performance obtained from the acidogenesis of source selected municipal solid wastes required an external supply of microelements, such as iron and molybdenum. Yu and Lee (2003) showed that the photo-hydrogen production performance increased with increasing Fe ion concentration, but did not increase with increasing Mo ion concentration. 3.3.2 Light intensity Phototrophic hydrogen production requires ATP and free electrons originating from the reducing power. Sufficient supply of ATP (Miyake et al., 1999a) thus becomes one of the major concerns for efficient photo-H2 production. Since ATP synthesis in photosynthetic bacteria is a light-dependent event, requiring light energy primarily at the wavelengths of 522, 805 and 850nm (Akkerman et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2006), it is critical for a H2-producing photobioreactor to use appropriate light sources and a light intensity that provides sufficient light energy with the needed wavelengths. There are many reports describing the influence of light intensity on photo-H2 production performance. Shi and Yu (2005b) utilized response surface methodology to demonstrate the effects of initial cell concentration and light intensity as well as their interactive effects on photo-H2 production. In another study, the effects of two different light intensities (40 and 680μmolphotons/m2/s) on photo-H2 production was explored with three photosynthetic bacteria, i.e. Rhodopseudomonas sp., Rhodopseudomonas palustris and a non-identified strain (Barbosa et al., 2001). The results showed that a low light intensity (ca. 40μmolm−2 s−1) led to an increase in light efficiency and a decrease in H2 yield, total volume of H2 evolved and H2 production rate. Argun and Kargi (2010) also discovered that 10,000lux was an optimal light intensity for the photo-hydrogen production rate and H2 yield. The light conversion efficiency is also regarded as an important design parameter that determines the feasibility of the photo-hydrogen production process. To date, the highest light conversion efficiency reported is 7.9%, which was achieved using the light generated from a solar simulator (Miyake and Kawamura, 1987). However, this value was obtained in a laboratory-scale experiment with a low light intensity, and achieving high light conversion efficiency in large-scale photobioreactors is likely to be challenging. 3.3.3 Temperature The operating temperature is always a critical factor influencing the performance of cell growth, photo-H2 production, H2 yield and substrate conversion efficiency, and this is also true for photohydrogen production by pure photosynthetic bacteria. The optimal growth temperature range for many photosynthetic bacteria is between 30 and 40°C (Stevens et al., 1984). Wang et al. (2010) also found that optimal growth temperature for the Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 is between 27.5 and 32.5°C, whereas a sharp decline in hydrogen production was observed when the temperature was above 35°C. He et al. (2006) showed that the culture temperature significantly influenced the bacteria growth, hydrogen production rate and substrate conversion efficiency. The optimal growth temperature was 30°C for photo-H2 production with Rhodobacter capsulatus JP91 and IR3 (He et al., 2006). 3.3.4 pH Different pH values of culture medium determine the ionic form of the active site and enzyme activity. Therefore, the pH value of the culture medium normally affects the biochemical reaction characteristics. Shi and Yu (2005b) explored the effects of pH, nitrogen source concentration, and their interaction on H2 production by photosynthetic bacteria. Koku et al. (2002) reported that the optimum pH for the nitrogenase and hydrogenase was 7.1–7.3 and 6.5–7.5, respectively. Moreover, the pH value has also been proven to be an essential factor for H2 production by dark fermentative bacteria (Fang and Yu, 2002)."
11,Photobioreactor design for hydrogen production,"In both lab-scale and pilot-scale photo-hydrogen production systems, the key factors that need to be considered for photobioreactor design and operation are how to use appropriate light sources (intensity and wavelength), how to enhance light conversion efficiency, and how to maintain an appropriate cell concentration during prolonged operation. Conventional photobioreactors use external illumination systems (e.g., tungsten filament, halogen filament or incandescent lamps) (Barbosa et al., 2001; Kondo et al., 2002b), the light intensity decreases exponentially with the distance from a reactor wall as the concentrations of cell and product increase. Consequently, the light conversion efficiency of conventional photobioreactors has been limited (Nakada et al., 1995). In addition, the stability of continuous culture of photosynthetic bacteria is usually poor, as the cell growth and hydrogen production are sensitive to changes in the environment and the medium composition. Maintaining a sufficient cell concentration in the continuous photobioreator is also a challenge. Due to the problems and limitations associated with conventional photobioreactors, several innovative designs have been proposed to improve the photo-hydrogen production performance and light energy conversion efficiency. Table 3 compares the operating stability, photo-hydrogen production performance and electricity consumption of different types of photobioreactors. The advantages and drawbacks of these different designs for photo-hydrogen production performance are discussed below."
12,Solar energy excited optical fiber photobioreactors,"4.1 Solar energy excited optical fiber photobioreactors In solar energy excited optical fiber photobioreactors, the reactor vessel is illuminated with sunlight transmitted through optical fiber. In a design proposed by Chen et al. (2008b), sunlight was transmitted into the photobioreactor via side-light optical fibers, which were directly immersed into the fermentation culture to ensure high light intensity and uniform distribution. The side light optical fibers were excited by a sunlight collecting system (Chen et al., 2008b). The sunlight was collected by using fresnel lenses and then transmitted through an end-light optical fiber to the side-light optical fibers. The light tracking system makes each fresnel lens rotate toward the position of sun so that the side-light optical fiber can gain maximum light energy from sunlight during the daytime (Chen et al., 2008b). Internal illumination could maintain a uniform light distribution and light intensity inside the photobioreactor, and avoid shielding effects due to the increase in cell density. The performance of this internal-illumination type photobioreactor was quite good, giving a high H2 production rate and yield of 22.7ml/l/h and 62.3% with Rhodopseudomonas palustris using acetate as the carbon source (Chen et al. 2008b)."
13,Photobioreactors with immobilized cells,"4.2 Photobioreactors with immobilized cells Recent studies showed that addition of an appropriate amount of porous carriers into the fermentation broth could enhance cell growth and promote photo-H2 production with a 51–67% increase in H2 production rate (Chen and Chang, 2006a; Eroğlu et al., 2008). It is thought that the carriers can provide more surface attachment sites to enhance biofilm formation, so that the cell concentration in the photobioreactor is increased. In addition, the solid carriers may also provide buffer capacity for extreme conditions such as high organic loadings (Chen et al., 2007), high NH3-N concentration, and pH shock, thereby allowing better operational stability of the photosynthetic bacteria culture. Moreover, similar to the function of immobilized cells, the carriers coated with biofilms could enhance cell retention for continuous operation, thereby avoiding wash-out of photosynthetic bacteria when operating at a low hydraulic retention time (Fißler et al., 1995). Various immobilization methods and carrier supports were applied to enhance the photo-hydrogen production rate. The first report disclosing the use of immobilized cells in photo-fermentation system was published by Vincenzini et al. (1981), who explored the effect of using immobilized cells on photo-hydrogen production from wastewater. Fißler et al. (1995) reported that using immobilized Rhodopseudomonas palustris cells with polymeric materials such as agar, agarose, k-carrageenan or sodium alginate gel could improve photo-hydrogen production. Nakada et al. (1996) trapped the Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells in a two-layer gel to investigate the distribution of pigment, cell growth and light penetration in the gels. Tsygankov et al. (1994) also reported using porous glass matrix with surface modification to provide a higher surface to volume ratio for the cell attachment. The results showed that the maximum hydrogen evolution rate and substrate to H2 yield was 1.3ml/h/ml porous glass and 75%, respectively. Indigenous photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 immobilized in PVA-boric acid gel granules was able to achieve a high photo-hydrogen production rate of 80.6ml/gcelldryweight/h (Tian et al., 2009). Xie et al. (2010) reported that co-culturing of Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 and immobilized Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53 was a promising way of converting glucose into hydrogen, achieving a yield of 3.10molH2/molglucose. Although there are many successful cases where using immobilized cells could promote the performance of photo-H2 production, the presence of a large amount of immobilized cells inside the reactor may significantly hinder the light penetration into the culture broth, leading to an inefficient light supply. Thus, sufficient mixing or circulation of the culture medium may be required to eliminate the light blocking effects arising from using immobilized cells in the photobioreactor."
14,The plate-type photobioreactors,"4.3 The plate-type photobioreactors Plate-type photobioreactors have received increasing attention recently for the cultivation of photosynthetic bacteria due to the features of a large illumination surface area, short light path, low cost, and being easy to clean up. Although using plate-type photobioreactors can often obtain high cell density and high hydrogen productivity, they are difficult to scale up and also have the limitations of the culture temperature being difficult to control, biofilm formation on the surface of photobioreactor and significant hydrodynamic stress. Kondo et al. (2006) constructed a multi-layered photobioreactor, which enabled the user of a grid, medium layer and membrane to dilute a strong incident light and diffuse it uniformly in the photobioreactor to improve photo-hydrogen production performance (Kondo et al., 2006). Nakada et al. (1995) constructed a photobioreactor composed of four equal compartments. The light path was set normal to the parallel planes of the compartments to evaluate photo-hydrogen production performance and absorption wavelength at various depths in the reactor (Nakada et al., 1995). In order to improve the light energy conversion efficiency, El-Shishtawy et al. (1997) proposed a novel photobioreactor which was designed by combining light receiving face and reflection sheet to transfer light sources. The results showed that the maximum light conversion efficiency was 9.23% by using 1cm culture thick with a halogen lamp."
15,The LED photobioreactors,"4.4 The LED photobioreactors According to the literature (Chen et al., 2006), the major absorption bands of photosynthetic bacteria are located at wavelengths of 522 and 860nm. In particular, the light at 800–900nm is required for ATP synthesis in photosynthetic bacteria, and is thus essential to ATP-consuming photo-H2 production. Among the light sources available, LED light sources have a narrow spectral half-power band-width of 20–30nm. Therefore, using LED at the specific wavelengths that meet the photosynthetic absorption spectrum of photosynthetic bacteria could be a good strategy to enhance light conversion efficiency. Compared with traditional light sources, LED are light and small enough to fit into virtually at any photobioreactor, and they have several additional benefits, including lower light energy consumption, longer life-expectancy, and lower heat generation. Some studies applied LED at a wavelength of 590nm as the sole light source for cultivation of the Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 to improve photo-hydrogen production (Tian et al., 2009), attaining a maximum hydrogen production rate, H2 yield and light conversion efficiency of 3.816mmol/m2/h, 0.75molH2/molglucose and 3.8%, respectively. Kawagoshi et al. (2010) also reported that halo-tolerant photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sp. KUPB1 can be well grown and produce H2 under long-wavelength light-emitting diode (LW-LED) light irradiation, suggesting that LW-LED is quite useful for photo-hydrogen production."
16,Outdoor photobioreactor design for photo-hydrogen production,"4.5 Outdoor photobioreactor design for photo-hydrogen production Conventional outdoor large-scale photobioreactors usually operate with direct sunlight illumination. Sunlight is free and contains the full spectrum of light energy (Ogbonna et al., 1999), and thus most of the commercial photosynthetic bacteria cultivation systems are operated outdoors to take advantage of this. However, the performance of outdoor photobioreactors faces significant challenges with regard to contamination, direct exposure to UV irradiation, and the inherent instability of the solar energy supply. Moreover, since the intensity of sunlight varies greatly with the seasons, solar spectrum and operating time, it is very difficult to maintain steady microalgae culture performance in outdoor cultivation. In addition, the limitation of light energy is the most commonly encountered problem in large-scale cultivation when the size of the photobioreactor is increased, and the illumination area per unit volume is commonly used as a design criterion. Kim et al. (1987) presented the first example of using sunlight as the light source on a semi-continuous outdoor photobioreactor to improve photo-hydrogen production during the operation time of 45days. Miyake et al. (1999b) constructed a sunlight collecting system and used a halogen lamp to simulate sunlight illumination pattern. Despite the higher H2 yield that can be obtained from photosynthetic bacteria, there are very few successful examples of commercial-scale processes for photohydrogen production using them (Koku et al., 2002; Nakada et al., 1999). This is mainly because of the higher operating costs, unstable light availability and mixing efficiency, and the difficulty in identifying or purifying high-value products (e.g., poly-hydroxy-butyrate or Q10) for industrial-scale production. Consequently, different operating strategies and photobioreactor configurations may be required to achieve commercially viable photohydrogen production. In addition, the residual biomass from photo-fermentation can also be used as additives in animal feed or the source of poly-hydroxy-butyrate (PHB) (Sangkharak and Prasertsan, 2007). Meenakshisundaram and Vatsala (2001) mentioned that seasonal variations, in particular in the sugar and sulfur content, has a critical effect on H2 production using individual and/or co-culture of Citrobacter freundii and/or Rhodopseudomonas palustris P2 at lab-scale and pilot-scale operations."
17,Comparison of different photobioreactors for photo-hydrogen production systems,"4.6 Comparison of different photobioreactors for photo-hydrogen production systems Most small or middle size photobioreactors (e.g., up to 10–20L working volume) are illuminated by using tungsten lamps, which require higher power consumption. Using thesame photobioreactors, replacing tungsten lamps by LED resulted in a 33.3% decrease in electricity consumption (from 28.8 to 19.2kW-h). Although immobilized-cell and plate-type photobioreactord have higher electricity consumption, they both have good operating stability and photo-hydrogen production performance. Most commercial cultivation systems for photo-fermentation are carried out in outdoor photobioreactors using solar energy as the light source, which has no energy related costs. However, the operating stability of outdoor photobioreactor is usually weak. In addition, although solar energy excited optical fiber photobioreactors have low power consumption and high operating stability, the high capital cost of the light collection device and challenges in scaling up the process remain significant drawbacks. As shown in Table 3, the electricity consumption (for the light supply) of different photobioreactors decreases in the order of conventional artificial light (28.8kW-h)=immobilized-cell photobioreactor (28.8kW-h)>Plate-type photobioreactor (19.2kW-h)>LED photobioreactor (2.59kW-h)>solar energy excited optical fiber photobioreactor (0.3kW-h)>outdoor photobioreactor (0kW-h)."
18,Conclusions,"Photosynthetic bacteria utilize wastes from dark fermentation to produce H2 at a high yield with simultaneous waste reduction. However, if it is to play a more important role in the overall bioH2 production system, the efficiency of photo-fermentation must be significantly improved to solve the problems with low H2 production rate, poor operation stability, and high operating cost. This review shows that photo-hydrogen production could be effective when using favorable culture conditions, cultivation strategies, and photobioreactor design. In particular, sufficient light supply and appropriate bioreactor configuration are of critical importance. Integration of dark and photo-fermentation could lead to a high yield of over 7.0molH2/molhexose, which greatly improves the economic feasibility of producing bioH2 through fermentation processes. However, there are still challenges to overcome with regard to the on technical and economic feasibility of large-scale photo-H2 production systems operated outdoors using sunlight as the sole energy source."
