0,Introduction,"The increasing trend in global energy consumption has made priority the development of new technologies. Most of the energy we use comes from fossil fuels; however this is not sustainable in the short term, because it has serious consequences on the environment; in addition, these fossil fuels on Earth are limited and will soon be exhausted. In order to replace or reduce the use of fossil fuels, it is important to look for environmentally friendly energy alternatives (wind, hydro, solar, geothermal, biomass, etc.). However, the availability of this type of energy is unstable. In this context, hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier because it is a rich, versatile element and involves clean energy. However, hydrogen is an energy carrier that does not exist freely on our planet and thus needs to be produced (Liao et al., 2012). The most promising approach and the best low energy consumption and environmentally friendly alternative is to carry out the reaction of dissociation of water (water-splitting) to obtain hydrogen in a clean manner (Liao et al., 2012). For this reason, semiconductor-mediated production of hydrogen from water has acquired special importance in recent years (Calatayud et al., 2012; Kudo and Miseki, 2009). In this process, the electronic structure of the semiconductors plays an important role, making it possible to transfer the energy from the photons to the water, leading to its decomposition into hydrogen and oxygen. The basic operating principle of the photocatalytic semiconductor particles with water is simple once it is known that the band-gap (Eg) is the separation between a lower energy band in which there are electrons (valence band, VB) and a higher energy band without electrons (conduction band, CB). First, the irradiation of light with energy greater than the band-gap of the photocatalyst, excites an electron in the VB to the CB resulting in the formation of an electron–hole pair (e−–h+). These photogenerated electrons and holes reduce and oxidize, respectively, the chemical species on the surface of the photocatalyst, where they migrate (Liao et al., 2012). The process is greatly affected by the crystal structure and particle size, since defects act as recombination centers, trapping photogenerated electrons and holes, with consequent reduction of the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor up to 90 %. However, if the particle size is small, apart from increasing the reactive surface available, the distance to reach the reaction sites on the surface will be small, which will reduce the chances of recombination (Kudo and Miseki, 2009). Therefore it is important to find nanostructured materials with small particle sizes, thus the role of nanotechnology and nanomaterials is crucial for the development of novel alternatives in hydrogen production based on greener chemical processes. Many materials have been investigated as photocatalysts since the discovery of photocatalytic water-splitting on a TiO2 electrode under ultraviolet light (UV) in 1972 by Fujishima (Fujishima and Honda, 1972), however, titanium oxide-based nanomaterials remain the most studied as heterogeneous photocatalysts (Fujishima et al., 2000; Fujishima et al., 2007) for the production of hydrogen and electricity from solar energy (Fujishima and Honda, 1972; Bahruji et al., 2011; Zaleska, 2008), due to their optical and electronic properties, chemical stability, low cost, abundance and low toxicity (Liao et al., 2012; Bahruji et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2008). There are different methods for preparation of nanostructured titanium oxide and the results are usually different depending on the synthetic path or calcination parameters used (Luis et al., 2011). Even for the same procedure, the particle size may vary if a different amount of starting material is used (Thamaphat et al., 2008). Since the photo-induced reactions occur mainly on the catalyst surface, a large surface is needed. Therefore, there is great interest in the synthesis of nanoparticles or nano-sized semiconductors (Souvereyns et al., 2013). In recent years, the development of new synthetic processes for reducing the particle size has been very significant, achieving the preparation of mesoporous/nanoporous TiO2 materials nanopowders, nanocrystals, thin films, nanotubes (titania nanotubes, TNTs) and nanorods using sol-gel methods with or without (Yu et al., 2002) the use of organic surfactants templates, by hydrothermal synthesis (Chen et al., 2010), homogeneous precipitation, molten salt method or chemical vapor-phase synthesis (Thamaphat et al., 2008; Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013; Kho et al., 2011). However, methods based on the sol–gel technique are the most widespread in the liquid phase synthesis, given its versatility, reproducibility and ease of control of synthesis variables (Chen and Mao, 2007; Gupta and Tripathi, 2011). From all forms of titanium oxide, rutile is the most thermodynamically stable, with anatase and brookite structures transformed to rutile phase at a particle size greater than 14nm. In addition, the band-gap of anatase is approximately 3.20eV while it is 3.02eV for rutile and 2.96eV for brookite, and therefore the energy of activation for anatase is much higher than for rutile or brookite. Thus, the synthetic method needs to be completely controlled to avoid non-expected mixtures of products. In addition, calcination temperature control is of great importance, because on raising the temperature the crystallinity increases, but the surface area decreases due to the collapse of the pores of TiO2 as a result of the irreversible transformation of anatase to rutile (Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013; Gupta and Tripathi, 2011; Mohammadi et al., 2008) and in a change of the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface which usually affects the photocatalytic activity (Oosawa and Grätzel, 1988) Thus, the resulting photocatalytic activity is dominated by the balance between different factors that need to be controlled during the synthetic process and by the proportion between the crystalline phases of titanium oxide. (Gupta and Tripathi, 2011). However, in all titanium oxide phases (anatase, rutile or brookite) only the UV (4% solar energy) light can be used to activate titanium oxide photocatalyst (Janczarek et al., 2007). Thus, the inability to use visible light (50% of solar energy), coupled with rapid and numerous processes of electron–hole (e−–h+) pair recombination, limit the efficiency of TiO2 in the photocatalytic hydrogen production (Liao et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2007), raising consumption energy and operating costs (Janczarek et al., 2007). Therefore, the primary objective to improve the photocatalytic properties and applicability of these compounds consists in reducing the band-gap and reducing (e−–h+) pair recombination processes (Calatayud et al., 2012). For a band-gap reduction through modification of TiO2 to visible light photoactivity (Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013; Janczarek et al., 2007) different methods have been extensively studied (Zaleska, 2008; Gupta and Tripathi, 2011; Ni et al., 2007). It has been observed experimentally (Hwang et al., 2004; Konta et al., 2004; Niishiro et al., 2007; Habibi et al., 2012) that doping with transition metals “3d” (one element, various elements, or an element and a co-catalyst) is an effective and simple method to adjust the values of band-gap, as the dopants act as electron acceptors and minimize recombination of generated loads. However, when the optimal amount is exceeded, the photocatalytic activity decreases considerably due to the formation of (e−–h+) recombination centers (Chen et al., 2010). It is important to find a simple and economic process for doping materials, so the use of a cheap and abundant element that is able to improve the photocatalytic and light absorption properties may be a suitable option. In this context, our group (Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013) has recently improved the synthesis of titanium oxide doped with Zn by including an inexpensive source of Zn such as Zn(NO3)2 for the preparation of Zn-doped mesoporous titanium oxide nanoparticles (with particle sizes of 10 to 20nm). To improve H2 production and separation of (e−–h+), electron donors (sacrificial or reactive scavengers holes) may be added; however, as they are consumed in the photocatalytic reaction, a continuous addition of electron donors is required to sustain hydrogen production (Liao et al., 2012; Kudo and Miseki, 2009; Ni et al., 2007; Chiarello et al., 2010). Organic compounds (hydrocarbon) derived from renewable sources are widely used as electron donors. Compounds such as methanol (Chiarello et al., 2010), ethanol, isopropanol, CN−, EDTA, lactic acid (Ni et al., 2007), glycerol (Al-Mazroai et al., 2009), oxalic acid, formic acid, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde (Liao et al., 2012) have been tested, proving to be effective in improving hydrogen production (Chen et al., 2010). Furthermore, to improve performance in photocatalytic reforming of methanol and other alcohols in the presence of water, the surface of the photocatalyst can be charged with metals that act as co-catalysts (Pt, Au, Pd, Ag) (Klug and Alexander, 1974). Noble metals can help to prevent (e−–h+) recombination, which results in an increase of photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (Liao et al., 2012; Bahruji et al., 2010). TiO2 photocatalysts loaded with noble metals can be prepared by precipitation deposition, impregnation, photo-deposition and colloidal mixture methods; but as in the case of pure TiO2 photoactivity, methods of synthesis and metal loads can significantly affect the production of H2 (Liao et al., 2012). It is noteworthy that, although the presence of methanol as electron donor is beneficial in photocatalytic hydrogen production from water, the amount in the gas mixture fed must be kept low because otherwise it is not possible to complete the oxidation from methanol to CO2. Also, it has been shown that photocatalysts-containing noble metal nanoparticles perform best reforming of methanol, both in terms of efficiency of hydrogen production and low production of CO, due to the small particle size and better dispersion in the oxide surface area (Chiarello et al., 2010). Bearing all these antecedents in mind and working towards a green hydrogen production via methanol photoreforming using doped titanium oxide nanoparticles, this paper reports a detailed study on the Zn-doping effect on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanostructured photocatalysts (prepared under different synthetic conditions). Moreover, hybrid photocatalysts consisting of doped aggregates of titanium oxide nanoparticles on which palladium nanoparticles are supported as co-catalyst have been studied. The hybrid nanosystems are active in the photocatalytic degradation of MB under LED light and in the photocatalytic reforming of methanol for hydrogen production, confirming that nanomaterials based on titanium oxide, may be a viable alternative in the future for sustainable and environmentally friendly hydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium(IV) isopropoxide, 97% (Sigma-Aldrich), titanium(IV) butoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), nitric acid (Fluka Analytical), ascorbic acid, 99,7% (Panreac), 2-propanol, 99% (Sigma-Aldrich) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate, 98% (Acros-Organics), PdCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene redistilled (Sigma-Aldrich) were used in this study without further purification. In addition, [Pd(cod)Cl2] (cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene) was prepared according to the literature procedure (Balbín et al., 2014) and was used as the palladium source. Methylene blue (MB) (Scharlau) was chosen as a model pollutant for testing photocatalytic activities of the synthesized materials. Milli-Q water (18.2MVcm, Millipore Waters, USA) was used in all the syntheses."
3,Synthesis of titanium oxide nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of titanium oxide nanoparticles TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared based on the method described by our group (Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013). This method is based on the hydrolysis of the titanium source in Milli-Q water at controlled pH. Different parameters (Table 1 ) have been studied in order to determine their influence in the synthetic process, the band-gap and the photocatalytic activity. For a regular synthesis, a 100mL aliquot of the titanium source was dissolved in dry 2-propanol. This solution was prepared immediately before addition, in order to avoid uncontrolled hydrolysis. In parallel, a 100mL solution containing the desired amount of zinc nitrate hexahydrate was prepared in Milli-Q water. Both solutions were added dropwise (1mL/min) to 500mL of the acidic solution using a peristaltic pump Perimax 12/4. The pH of the acidic solution was previously adjusted to pH 2.0 using two different acids (nitric acid or ascorbic acid). After dropwise addition of the solutions of both Ti and Zn sources, the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 16h. The solvents of the suspension were removed by filtration and the resulting sticky solid was dried at 90°C for 3h. The resulting solid was ground in a mortar and subsequently calcined in a muffle Carbolite AAF 1100 under static conditions at 500°C or 600°C for 16h with a heating rate of 0.8°C/min from room temperature."
4,Synthesis of hybrid titanium oxide photocatalyst,"2.3 Synthesis of hybrid titanium oxide photocatalyst Hybrid photocatalysts Pd nanoparticles-doped titanium oxide were synthesized using a grafting procedure (Lázaro-Navas et al., 2015) which is based on two steps: firstly, the synthesis of the corresponding titanium oxide support and secondly the incorporation of the palladium nanoparticles, in situ. The general procedure carried out for the preparation of the hybrid materials was as follows: in a dry box, the corresponding amount of the doped titanium oxide (2.0g) and [PdCl2(cod)] (the required amount to have 2% or 0.5% Pd/TiO2 ratio) were added to a Schlenk tube and dried under vacuum for several hours at room temperature. Subsequently, 40mL of toluene was added under an inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then heated at 100°C and stirred for 24h. The reaction conditions were optimized after several syntheses at different temperatures, reaction times and solvents. Finally, the hybrid material was isolated by filtration and the resulting solid washed with THF (2×10mL) and Milli-Q water (2×50mL) to remove residual unreacted palladium complex before drying under vacuum for 24h."
5,Characterization techniques,"2.4 Characterization techniques The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by different analytical techniques in order to determine the physical and chemical properties of materials. 2.4.1 N2 gas adsorption–desorption Isotherms were obtained at 77K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 analyzer. The samples were outgassed in an inert atmosphere before analysis and the total pore volume was assumed as the one recorded at P/P0 =0.97. Surface specific areas were calculated using the BET method. Pore size distributions were determined by the BJH. 2.4.2 Powder X-ray diffraction XRD pattern of the materials were obtained on a Philips PW3040/00 X'Pert MPD/MRD at 40mA and 45kV, using a wavelength Cu Ka (λ=1.54Å). The mean crystallite size (D) was calculated from the line broadening of corresponding X-ray diffraction peaks, according to the Scherrer equation (Chen and Mao, 2007; Danilchenko et al., 2002; Reyes-Coronado et al., 2008). In this study, all diffractograms obtained are close to the Cauchy function (Klug and Alexander, 1974). 2.4.3 X-ray fluorescence Zn wt.% determination by XRF was carried out with an X-ray fluorescence spectrophotometer Phillips MagiX with an X-ray source of 1kW and an Rh anode using a helium atmosphere. The quantification method is able to analyze from 0.0001% to 100% Zn. 2.4.4 DR-UV–vis spectroscopy All spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 500 Scan using solid samples in diffuse reflectance mode and transformed to a magnitude proportional to the extinction coefficient (K) by means of the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R)), which was used for the calculation of the band-gap. 2.4.5 Transmission electron microscopy TEM was carried out with a Philips Tecnai 20, operating at 200kV, with thermionic gun and LaB6 filament; 2.7Å resolution and ±70° tilt of the sample. 2.4.6 Electrochemical and photo-electrochemical characterization Conductivity measurements of the samples were performed by the two-probe technique, using a GWINSTEK model GDM-8255 apparatus. The electrical conductivity (EC) data was studied at atmospheric pressure and the measurements were performed using 5K-step measurements in the temperature range 300–600K. The conductivity of the samples was measured as a function of temperature. Measurements were performed at heating and cooling runs with a rate less than 1K/min. A conventional cell was used for electrochemical and photo-electrochemical (PEC) characterizations including a Pt auxiliary electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode (SCE) and the working electrode (WE). For PEC studies, materials electrodes were prepared as paste (Boudjemaa et al., 2015). The current-potential J(V) characteristics were carried out using a Voltalab potentiostat galvanostat PGZ301. All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature using the electrolyte Na2SO4 (0.1M, pH–7) continually flushed with nitrogen and illuminated using an UV lamp."
6,Photocatalytic test: degradation of aqueous solutions of methylene blue (MB),"2.5 Photocatalytic test: degradation of aqueous solutions of methylene blue (MB) The photocatalytic behavior of the synthesized materials was determined by a degradation reaction of MB, an organic contaminant which facilitates visualization of the results under visible light. The reaction was carried out using a fixed amount of catalyst (25mg) which was dispersed in 50mL of an aqueous 0.01mM solution of MB. For a general photocatalytic reaction the mixture MB solution and photocatalyst was stirred in the darkness of a black box (Spectronics Cabinet Model CM-10) with a multi-shaker (OVAN) at 320rpm for 1h to ensure the adsorption equilibrium was reached. Subsequently, the suspensions were irradiated in the black box with a 6 WHg tube lamp (Spectronics ENF-240C/FE) operating at 365nm, and the reaction was stirred at 320 rpm at different time intervals (0min, 30min, 1h, 2h and 6h). After the photocatalytic treatment, the solution was filtered and the absorbance of the solution measured in a spectrophotometer UV-vis Analytik Jena SPECORD 200, at 660nm (maximum wavelength of MB). For the hybrid Zn-doped TiO2–Pd nanoparticles photocatalytic experiments, 25mg of the hybrid sample was dispersed in 50mL of a 0.01mM MB solution. The radiation source was a visible LED lamp (AS-Schwabe 42411, 4.5W) and the reactions were carried out for 24h. In all cases, the degradation was monitored by measuring the changes of UV–vis absorption spectra as a function of irradiation time. All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and absorbance measurements in triplicate. The reproducibility of results in terms of error was less than 10%."
7,Hydrogen gas production: photocatalytic reforming of methanol,"2.6 Hydrogen gas production: photocatalytic reforming of methanol The test, based on the work of Bahruji et al. (Bahruji et al., 2011), studied the activity of doped TiO2 materials for photocatalytic water splitting reaction using methanol as sacrificial agent. The first step is to prepare Pd/TiO2 catalyst, in which 0.5wt.% Pd nanoparticles are supported on doped-TiO2 using incipient wetness impregnation method. Thus, 0.016g of PdCl2 was dissolved in 2mL of deionized H2O with 2 drops of HCl. The Pd solution was added onto 2g of doped-TiO2 powder (YPZ5 A-500) and the mixture was mixed thoroughly before drying in air oven at 120°C for 2 hours followed by air calcination at 500°C for 3h. The reaction vessel consisted of a Pyrex reaction flask with a purge line and a septum for sampling. The as-prepared catalyst PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 was ground in a pestle and mortar and sieved to an aggregate size of less than 53μm. The reaction mixture, consisting of 0.2g catalysts and 100mL deionized water, was placed in the flask and purged with Ar for 30min to remove dissolved gases. Then, 100μL of methanol was added, and the mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer and illuminated with a 400W Xe arc lamp (Oriel model 66084) from the side of the flask. Samples of 0.2mL gas were extracted by syringe at different times and analyzed using a Varian 3300 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and MS 13X column (2m long)."
8,Results,
9,Synthesis and characterization of photocatalysts,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of photocatalysts 3.1.1 Synthesis of Zn-doped mesoporous aggregates of titanium oxide nanoparticles Mesoporous aggregates of TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by controlled hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide or titanium(IV) butoxide in a solution of HNO3 or ascorbic acid in water at pH 2 following the same synthetic protocol described recently by us (Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013; Lázaro-Navas et al., 2015). The reactions were carried out by stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature during 16 h and after the removal of the solvents by simple filtration and washing with water, a final calcination step was carried out at 500 or 600°C. The resulting materials were named PZ0-N-500, PZ0-N-600, PZ2-N-500, PZ2-N-600, PZ5-N-500, PZ5-N-600, BZ0-N-500, BZ0-N-600, BZ2-N-500, BZ2-N-600, BZ5-N-500, BZ5-N-600, PZ0-A-500, PZ0-A-600, PZ2-A-500, PZ2-A-600, PZ5-A-500, PZ5-A-600, BZ0-A-500, BZ0-A-600, BZ2-A-500, BZ2-A-600, BZ5-A-500, BZ5-A-600, where P or B correspond to the titanium source (titanium(IV) isopropoxide or titanium(IV) butoxide, respectively) 0, 2 or 5 is the quantity of Zn doping, N or A are the acid used for the acidic solution (nitric acid or ascorbic acid, respectively) and 500 and 600 is the calcination temperature (Table 1). The resulting solids were characterized by various techniques including N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV spectroscopy, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), electrochemical and photo-electrochemical methods. 3.1.2 Synthesis of hybrid materials A hybrid nanomaterial TiO2 with supported palladium nanoparticles (PZ5-A-500-Pd2) was synthesized using a grafting reaction of a palladium(II) organometallic salt [Pd(cod)Cl2] (79.9mg) onto the previously synthesized titanium oxide (PZ5-A-500). The final material PZ5-A-500-Pd2 in which 2.0wt.% Pd nanoparticles has been supported on doped-TiO2, was characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV spectroscopy, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), electrochemical and photo-electrochemical methods. In addition, another hybrid nanomaterial TiO2 with supported palladium nanoparticles, especially designed for the hydrogen production studies was prepared (PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5) as reported in Section 2.6. The resulting material was characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), electrochemical and photo-electrochemical methods. 3.1.3 Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms As shown in Fig. 1a and b for representative examples, two types of adsorption-desorption isotherms are obtained, corresponding to the type IV with hysteresis loop type H2 (eg. PZ0 N-500), and the type V with hysteresis loop type H3 (eg. BZ5-A-600), according to the IUPAC classification (Sing et al., 1985). Therefore, all synthesized materials are forming porous agglomerations of nanoparticles. In general, non-doped titanium oxide materials isotherms are not different from those of the doped ones, beyond changes in the adsorbed volume of nitrogen and small variations in the steep region between 0.6 and 0.8 relative pressures. However, clear trends related to the type of acid used to maintain the pH of the reaction were observed. Samples synthesized in a medium with nitric acid, irrespective of the titanium source used, calcination temperature or amount of dopant, have an isotherm type IV. Conversely, when using ascorbic acid in combination with titanium(IV) butoxide, besides an increase in the hysteresis loop when the calcination temperature is raised to 600°C, a change is observed in the type of isotherm, becoming isotherm type V. It is also remarkable that in the desorption branches of some materials, the hysteresis loop is not closed, because the micropores appear to be so small that they are unable to empty entirely. Regarding the hybrid materials titanium oxide-Pd nanoparticles, an adsorption-desorption type IV isotherm with H2 hysteresis loop is obtained, although porosity is significantly lost after immobilization of palladium, due to different agglomeration of the material compared with that of the starting doped titanium oxide. The pore size distribution, as shown for two examples in Fig. 1c and d, is narrower and more homogeneous for materials calcined at 500°C (eg PZ5-A-500.); while in the case of the materials calcined at 600°C (eg. PZ5-A-600) it is not regular, observing multiple pore sizes and/or much wider distributions. Also in those cases where the isotherm is type V, non-homogeneous distributions of the pores are obtained, a feature already noted by some authors (Sreethawong et al., 2007). In general, an increase in the calcination temperature worsens the textural properties of the synthesized material (Tables 2 and 3 ), as despite increasing the pore diameter (Dp), it greatly decreases the surface area (SBET). Furthermore, the use of titanium(IV) isopropoxide as a titanium source provides more homogeneous textural properties than the use titanium(IV) butoxide. In most cases, doping with Zn improves textural properties in terms of surface area, although sometimes the optimum value is 2% and not 5%, perhaps due to an excess in the direction of the structure promoted by Zn2+ ions causing a reduction in porosity. In the hybrid materials titanium oxide-Pd nanoparticles, when compared to the starting material, it was observed that the surface area and pore volume decreased after immobilization of palladium, while the pore diameter slightly increased. 3.1.4 X-ray fluorescence To measure the exact amount of zinc which has been doped in each synthesized materials (theoretically 0%, 2% and 5% Zn; and 2% Pd), X-ray fluorescence analysis was carried out showing that although the loading values increase as the amount of starting Zn is higher, the actual amount is always lower than the theoretical maximum (Table 2). 3.1.5 Powder X-ray diffraction XRD confirms the formation of non-amorphous (crystalline) surfaces in all cases, showing the peaks corresponding to the anatase phase, rutile and/or brookite (Fig. 2 ). The anatase (JCPDS pattern reference card No. 21-1272 (Reyes-Coronado et al., 2008) or from 84 to 1286 (Thamaphat et al., 2008)) crystallizes in an octahedral system with 2θ values of 25° (101), 48° (200) and 63° (116). Rutile (JCPDS No. 21-1276 (Reyes-Coronado et al., 2008) or 88-1175 (Thamaphat et al., 2008)), has a tetragonal system and the most intense peaks occur in 2θ values of 27° (110) 36° (101) 55° (211). Finally, brookite (JCPDS No. 29-1361) (Reyes-Coronado et al., 2008), has an orthorhombic crystal system, where the most characteristic peaks appear at 2θ values of 26° (111), 31° (121) and 43° (221). Moreover, it was confirmed that palladium anchoring on the material does not significantly change the crystallinity of the material as the peaks are similar to those of the starting titanium oxide; however, additional peaks at 2θ values of 40°, 47° and 68° corresponding to Pd nanoparticles (JCPDS 46-1043) were observed (overlapped with those of anatase). Considering the X-ray diffraction patterns of all the materials studied, it can be concluded that while doping with zinc produces a subtle loss of crystallinity with respect to undoped TiO2, in all cases anatase is the main component (>90%); except for materials BZ0-A-600, BZ2-A-600 and BZ5-A-600, which have larger percentages of rutile, due to a higher calcination temperature. In addition, the use of titanium(IV) isopropoxide and calcination temperature of 500°C, results in more homogeneous materials based only on anatase. Regarding the crystallite size of all the studied materials, values vary between 0.228nm and 7.145nm and there is no clear tendency to consider a significant change affected by some of the studied variables. There is a clear exception in material BZ0-A-600 which has a crystallite size of 20.445nm probably due to its larger amount of rutile phase compared with all the other studied materials. It is important to note that zinc doping affects the formation of different amounts of rutile and brookite phases. Thus, the amount of rutile decreases to be nearly imperceptible when doping the material with zinc; while the brookite phase (only present when nitric acid is used), follows the opposite behavior, being favored by doping with zinc. 3.1.6 Transmission electron microscopy TEM micrographs (Fig. 3 ) confirm the formation of porous aggregates of quasi-spherical nanoparticles of particle sizes of less than 20nm. Not significant differences in the morphology were observed when changing the synthetic parameters. Regarding the hybrid material, it maintains its structural integrity and TiO2 morphology in the anatase phase, forming porous aggregates of nanoparticles (Fig. 3, (c)). However, the images show clusters of metal nanoparticles of Pd (Fig. 3, (d)) uniformly distributed on the TiO2 nanoparticle agglomerates. The size distribution of clusters of Pd particles is narrow, and of about 68.5±22.3nm. 3.1.7 Diffuse reflectance UV visible spectroscopy Finally, to complete the characterization of the materials, the Kubelka–Munk functions versus wavelength were obtained by ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV–vis). The maximum absorbance of the Kubelka–Munk function from doped samples shifts to slightly higher wavelengths with respect to the undoped sample (Fig. 4 , top), as previously observed in other materials based on metal-doped TiO2 (Zaleska, 2008; Chen et al., 2010; Sánchez-Muñoz et al., 2013; Chen and Mao, 2007). From this representation, with the knowledge that the samples are consistent with indirect allowed transition, modified Kubelka–Munk functions have been plotted against the radiation energy in order to graphically calculate the band-gap (Fig. 4, bottom). The results (Tables 2 and 3) show that the values, between 2.84 and 3.11eV, are quite similar for the different materials, but only slightly different depending on the titanium source and calcination temperature. Nevertheless, bigger differences are noticeable for samples synthesized in a medium with ascorbic acid, because, regardless of the calcination temperature and the amount of dopant, the use of titanium(IV) butoxide causes a decrease in the band-gap value with respect to the materials in which titanium(IV) isopropoxide has been used. This decrease, up 0.26eV, is more pronounced when the calcination temperature is 500°C, reaching the lowest band-gap values (2.84eV). In case of the hybrid material PZ5-A-500-Pd2, the band gap value is of 2.31eV, which constitutes a significant decrease compared with the value of the material without Pd (Table 2). This behavior seems to follow the pattern described by other authors for doping titanium oxide with noble metals (Bahruji et al., 2011). Note that the value, being less than 2.5eV, may be considered suitable for implementation in the production of hydrogen by visible light."
10,Electrical and photoelectrochemical properties,"3.2 Electrical and photoelectrochemical properties The best way to compare the electrical conductivity (EC) of the different materials is to compare the slopes of the linear branch of the EC curves. The effect of the temperature on the EC of PZ0-A-500, PZ2-A-500, PZ5-A-500, PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 and PZ5-A-500-Pd2 samples is described in Fig. 5 . For all samples, the graph shows that the EC enhanced with increasing the temperature. The PZ0-A-500 sample, without zinc deposition, showed the lowest conductivity which decreased with the temperature while the PZ2-A-500, PZ5-A-500, PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 and PZ5-A-500-Pd2 samples exhibited a thermally activated (semiconductor) behavior. In the Arrhenius plot of hopping conduction of the samples, a linear relationship between 1/T and log (σ) was observed, indicating that the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity (σ) obeys an Arrhenius type: σ = σ 0 exp − ΔE kT where σ0, k and ∆E are the pre-exponential constant, the Boltzmann constant and the activation energy for conduction, respectively. The increase in conductivity values with temperature could be attributed to the negative temperature coefficient of resistance and semiconducting nature of material. The obtained ΔE varied from 0.048 to 0.49eV for PZ2-A-500 and PZ5-A-500, respectively, due to the increase in zinc amount. However, the activation energy decreased with Pd addition and passed from 0.49 for PZ5-A-500 to 0.238 and 0.037 eV for PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 and PZ5-A-500-Pd2, respectively. PEC characterization of TiO2 based materials is important in order to study suitable positions of the electronic bands. Regarding the photoelectrochemical properties, Fig. 6 shows the intensity–potential (I–V) curves for the materials PZ2-A-500, PZ5-A-500, PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 and PZ5-A-500-Pd2 in the dark and under illumination in the neutral medium. Scanning was initiated on the anodic region with a speed rate fixed at 10mVs-1. The curves show that the photocurrent manifests in the anodic direction, confirming the n-type conductivity of the materials. Moreover, the positive slope in Mott-Schottky plot lends further support of n-type conductivity (Fig. 7 ). Two distinct peaks O1 (0.47V) and O2 (0.85V) are easily seen on the cyclic J(V) characteristic of the electrochemical couple Ti3+/4+ and Zn2+/0, respectively (Fig. 8 ). On the reverse scan, the peaks R1 (−1.19V) and R2 (0.03V) are attributed to the reversible reduction of Zn2+ and Ti4+, corresponding to the electrochemical couple Ti3+/4+ and Zn2+/0 respectively."
11,Photocatalytic test: Degradation of methylene blue (MB),"3.3 Photocatalytic test: Degradation of methylene blue (MB) To verify the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials, the decomposition reaction of MB under UV light was studied for each of the synthesized materials. Regardless of the material used, a decrease in MB concentration over time was observed; although the kinetic is faster for Zn-doped materials. It is important to note that, in several cases, the best degradation of MB is obtained from materials doped with 2% Zn, indicating that in these cases, a higher doping value (5% Zn) may have a negative effect in the photocatalytic degradation process. The apparent rate constant (k, s−1) for the degradation of MB can be determined from the regression curves of ln(C/C0) versus irradiation time, linearly adjusting to pseudo first order kinetics. The apparent rate constants are given in Table 4 and a comparison of the values is shown in Fig. 9 . The higher the constant, the greater MB degradation indicating an increased efficiency of the studied photocatalyst in this type of reaction. The results (ranging between 3.10·10−6 and 2.09·10−4 s−1) agree with the previously exposed trends, exhibiting higher values for the photocatalysts synthesized in ascorbic acid medium. In fact, for the materials obtained using ascorbic acid, titanium(IV) isopropoxide and calcination temperature 600°C, the apparent rate constants are very similar to each other regardless of the doping quantity. According to the studied textural properties and photocatalytic tests in the degradation of MB, material PZ5-A-500 presented the optimal properties for a further photocatalytic study. Thus, the hybrid materials PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 and PZ5-A-500-Pd2 were synthesized and the material with a higher Pd content was studied in the photocatalytic degradation experiment of MB, first under UV light and subsequently under visible LED light (4.5W) for 24h. The degradation of MB using PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5 as photocatalyst under UV-light showed the positive influence of the Pd nanoparticles. Therefore, the initial concentration was doubled in order to quantify MB concentration and only 15mg of photocatalyst was used. By regression curve, an apparent rate constant of 1.2·10−3 s-1 was obtained, which greatly improves the one obtained from its starting material PZ5-A-500 (7.86×10− 5 s-1). In addition, similar studies under visible light were carried out for PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5, but no remarkable degradation was observed. However, degradation of MB was observed for PZ5-A-500-Pd2 under visible LED light, with a kinetic constant of 1.05·10−5 s−1. The same photocatalytic experiment was carried out using PZ5-A-500 material and no degradation of MB was observed. This experiment confirms that the incorporation of Pd in the surface of the material has a very positive effect on the photoactivity of the material. The photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible light of the hybrid material PZ5-A-500-Pd2 may be due to its lower band gap value compared with that of PZ5-A-500. Thus, PZ5-A-500-Pd2 is able to absorb a higher percentage of visible light to start the photocatalytic process. In addition, the higher photocatalytic activity of PZ5-A-500-Pd2 may also be due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. The palladium incorporation in the hybrid material structure may also decrease the (e−–h+) pair recombination, supporting the degradation process and enhancing the photocatalytic activity."
12,Rate of hydrogen production by photocatalytic reforming of methanol,"3.4 Rate of hydrogen production by photocatalytic reforming of methanol Hydrogen gas was produced from the water splitting reaction; in this case methanol was used as sacrificial agent to enhance the activity. One general problem is the reaction of the active oxygen species on the valence band of TiO2 with resulting H2. The oxygen species, which can be in the form of O2 −, OH−• radical or O2 gas, is prone to react with resulting H2 to form water (Daskalaki et al., 2011). In order to prevent backwards reaction, methanol was added to scavenge the oxygen species and form CO2 gas. The material used for this test, YPZ5-A500 impregnated with 0.5% Pd metal nanoparticles (PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5), was characterized by TEM (Fig. 10 ), showing clusters of Pd on the surface of the photocatalyst of doped TiO2. The volume of hydrogen gas produced is shown in Fig. 11 , confirming that the synthesized materials show potential for the production of energy. 1.79mL of H2 was obtained after 300 minutes of reaction, following a linear progression in the rate of hydrogen production over time. The efficiency of the same material was also tested by doping it with 0.5% nickel, but it appears that Ni-doped catalyst, as well as YPZ5-A500 without additional doping, are inactive for hydrogen gas production. The activity of Pd, Ni and YPZ5-A500 catalysts is related to the ability of metal co-catalysts to accept photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2. Enhancing the energy carriers lifetime is important for water reduction and therefore the presence of noble metal co-catalyst improves the TiO2 activity. YPZ5-A500 activity is significantly increased with Pd metal as this exists in zero oxidation state and therefore can induce Schottky barriers for electron migration from the conduction band of TiO2 to the metal surface. In Ni doped onto TiO2 catalyst, Ni tends to be present in its oxidized state after calcination in air at 500°C. NiO unlike Ni behaves as a narrow band gap semiconductor with band gap energy of 2.2–2.4eV (Yang et al., 2008). The conduction band of NiO is more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 so the transfer of electrons is thermodynamically hindered (ECB of −0.96 vs NHE at pH 12; TiO2 ECB =−0.8 vs NHE at pH 12) (Chockalingam et al., 2011). The results indicate the importance of the noble metal on TiO2 to improve (e−–h+) lifetimes and provide active sites for hydrogen production."
13,Conclusion,"This particular study has shown that simple nanomaterials such as doped titanium oxide are potentially able to assist in environmental processes such as water decontamination by the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water and green energy hydrogen production via methanol photoreforming. From a cheap, simple and scalable method involving the hydrolysis of a titanium source in water at controlled pH, both undoped and doped with zinc TiO2 nanoparticles have been prepared using different synthesis variables finding that the transition temperature anatase-rutile, the textural properties, the number and coexistence of phases and an excess in the amount of dopant are affected by the different conditions used. The synthesized materials were tested in the photocatalytic degradation of a solution of MB, by irradiation with UV light (365nm). The observed kinetic constants for all materials studied ranged between 3.10·10−6 and 2.09·10−4 s−1, being higher values for photocatalyst synthesized in ascorbic acid medium. For most materials, slightly higher values were observed in the Zn doped materials, which indicates the positive influence of doping with Zn on the photocatalytic activity. However, variations in the kinetic constants are unrelated to changes in the values of the band gap. In addition, photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible LED light was obtained using the hybrid material PZ5-A-500-Pd2. Finally, promising results in the production of hydrogen by photocatalytic reforming of methanol were obtained when anchoring post-synthesis Pd nanoparticles on the surface of the photocatalyst. The material studied PZ5-A-500-Pd0.5, containing 0.5% Pd, was able to produce 1.79mL H2 in 300min of reaction, following a linear progression."
