0,Introduction,"A promising route to meet the need for petroleum-free pathways for the production of lower olefins, the building blocks of the chemical industry, is the use of the versatile chemical feedstock, syngas, for the production of higher alcohols that can later be converted into olefins. This synthesis route has been investigated with different families of catalysts including noble metal Rh-based catalysts [1–6], alkali modified methanol synthesis catalysts over Cu based catalysts [7–11], modified Fisher Tropsch catalysts over Co and Fe based catalysts modified with Ir [12–15], and alkali promoted Mo-based catalysts [16–19]. Potassium promoted MoS2 based catalysts are a particularly promising family of catalysts [20] due to their resistance to sulfur poisoning, less severe coke deposition, and high ethanol selectivity. Early studies over unsupported alkali/MoS2 and alkali/Co/MoS2 with a 13C-methanol co-feed by Santiesteban et al. revealed that only preferential enrichment of the terminal carbon of ethanol occurred, suggesting that CO inserted into a methyl intermediate to form an acyl precursor that was hydrogenated to produce ethanol [21]. However, recent studies hypothesized that ethanol self-coupling reactions to 1-butanol may also be important over related catalysts [22–24]. Christensen et al. observed that the production of 1-butanol was more strongly enhanced than 1-propanol formation with increasing ethanol co-feed over a carbon supported K/Co-MoS2 catalyst, suggesting that self-coupling of ethanol or ethanol-derived species leads to 1-butanol [23]. This is further supported by enhancement of 1-butanol production with an acetaldehyde co-feed over a K/Co-MoS2 catalyst [25]. The use of supports to enhance the reactivity of K/MoS2 catalysts has been widely investigated, exploring a variety of oxide and carbon supports [26–34]. However, limited understanding of reaction pathways over supported K/MoS2 catalysts is available due to the complexity of the catalyst and reaction mechanism(s). Previous work in our group showed that Mo-support interactions directly affect the higher alcohol product distribution [35–38], with hydrotalcite-derived mixed MgAl oxide (MMO) supports containing small K/MoS2 domains (predominantly double MoS2 layers) yielding high C2+OH selectivity. Changes in product distribution over the MMO supported K/MoS2 catalyst via ethanol and ethylene co-feeds provided insight into reaction pathways [38]. CO insertion was hypothesized to be the primary pathway to higher alcohols over the MMO supported catalyst. Similar C3+OH production rates over the MMO supported catalyst with ethanol and ethylene co-feed experiments indicated that alcohol formation with ethanol co-feed likely proceeded via the same acyl intermediate as olefin carbonylation. The MMO support was thought to influence secondary pathways involving methanol plus 1-propanol coupling to form isobutyl alcohol and catalyze ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol. In this work, we track the fate of 13C by 13C NMR and GC–MS analysis in CO hydrogenation reactions with 13C2-ethylene and 13C2-ethanol co-feeds over the MMO supported catalyst to elucidate the higher alcohol reaction pathway(s). K/bulk-MoS2 was used as a control catalyst subject to 13C2-ethylene co-feed, with an emphasis on understanding the role of K/MoS2 and K/MoS2-MMO sites on higher alcohol formation pathways. The K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst was not subjected to reactions with 13C2-ethanol, as the ethanol co-feed was found to be largely unreactive previously [38]. This study provides an unprecedented level of insight into the reaction pathways to higher alcohols from syngas over MMO supported K/MoS2 catalysts."
1,Experimental procedure,"The MMO support was prepared in a similar manner as described in previous work [35–37]. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%), and aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%) solutions (Mg:Al molar ratio of 7:3 and 0.6M in metal ions) were coprecipitated with a 1.2M NaOH solution (EMD, 97.0%) and a 0.15M Na2CO3 solution (Aldrich, 99.5+%) at 65°C and a pH of 9.5. Subsequently, the solution was stirred for 48h, washed and filtered with 2L of deionized water, dried at 105°C and calcined at 450°C for 2h under air flow. Bulk MoS2 was prepared with similar methods as described in the literature [39]. Ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S) (Alfa Aesar, 20–24% aq.) was combined with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT) (Sigma Aldrich, ACS Reagent) and stirred for 1h at 65°C in an oil bath. 25mL of a 25wt.% acetic acid solution was then added to the mixture to precipitate the thiomolybdate. Next, the precipitated solution was washed and filtered with deionized water. The material was then subsequently loaded into a quartz tube to decompose the thiomolybdate to the MoS2 phase by heating to 450°C for 2h at 5°Cmin−1 under 40mLmin−1 of flowing N2. The resulting bulk MoS2 was then passivated with 1% O2 in He (Matheson Trigas, UHP) flow at 40mLmin−1 for 8h at room temperature. MMO supported K/MoS2 catalysts were prepared with an approximate Mo loading of 5wt.%, K loading of 3wt.%, and a molar ratio of Mo:K of 1 (referred to as MoKMMO). K was added to the synthesized bulk MoS2 with a molar ratio of Mo:K of 1, with this sample referred to as K/bulk-MoS2. Both supported and unsupported precatalysts were physically ground for 15min with K2CO3 (Aldrich, 99%, stored in an oven at 105°C) [40]. The prepared K/bulk-MoS2 and MoKMMO catalysts were then pelletized, crushed, and sieved through a 20–40mesh. The precatalysts were then loaded into a 6.35mm steel tube reactor (1g for MoKMMO and 0.15g for K/bulk-MoS2) and pretreated, in situ, with 10% H2S/H2 (Matheson Tri-Gas, UHP) to reduce the surface oxidized K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst and precatalyst oxide phase of the MoKMMO catalyst to the MoS2 phase at 450°C for 2h at a heating rate of 5°C/min and a flow rate of 20mL/min. The CO hydrogenation reactions with syngas (45% H2, 45% CO, 10% N2, and 50ppm H2S) were carried out at 310°C and 1500psig after in situ sulfidation. The syngas flowrate was adjusted between 10 and 20mL/min to reach pseudo steady state at 8% conversion after ∼3days of reaction. Then the ethanol co-feeds, unlabeled ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%) or 10% 13C2-ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99 atom% 13C), balanced with ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%), was introduced into the reactor using a 500D Isco Pump. Similarly, ethylene co-feeds, unlabeled ethylene (Matheson, 99.95%), or 10% 13C2-ethylene (Cambridge Isotope, 99%), balanced with ethylene (Matheson, 99.95%) was introduced into the reactor using a 100DX Isco pump. Ethanol and ethylene co-feed experiments containing natural abundance (∼1.1atom%) 13C were conducted as control experiments. Ethanol co-feeds were heated to 200°C to convert the liquid to the vapor phase and pressurized to 1500psig before introduction into the reactor at 1 and 2μL/min, making a 0–6mol% composition with the syngas feed. The ethylene co-feed was pressurized to 1500psig and introduced into the reactor at 3 and 4μL/min, making a 0–9 mol% composition with the syngas feed. The ethanol and ethylene co-feeds were fed into the reactor at the first flowrate set point until the reaction reached pseudo steady state. Once pseudo steady state was reached, the liquid reaction products were collected for 18h using a liquid nitrogen trap placed downstream from the backpressure regulator and subsequently transferred to NMR tubes for 13C NMR analysis. The flowrate was then increased to the second set point (2μL/min for ethanol co-feed, 4μL/min for ethylene co-feed). After the reaction reached pseudo steady state a third time, the same procedure as discussed above was used to collect liquid products. Additionally, gas-tight NMR tubes were used to collect a gas aliquot for subsequent 13C NMR and GC–MS analyses. It is important to note that similar conversions and product distributions were observed before and after liquid product collection, as can be observed by the error bars in Fig. S1–S3 in the Supplementary information (SI). This suggests that the catalyst was stable during liquid product collection. Finally, the co-feed was shut off until the product selectivity returned to its original state. Similar product distributions as obtained initially were observed after returning to the original state (Fig. S4), suggesting that the co-feeds did not cause any significant change in the catalysts. It is important to note that 13C co-feed experiments led similar product distributions to those obtained with unlabeled co-feed experiments, as previously reported [38]. The main products were quantified using single point calibration curves with an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (GC) (carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane/propylene, C1–C6 linear alcohols). Isobutyl alcohol, as well as various aldehyde, acetate, and propionate species were also quantified as “other oxygenates” in Fig. S1–S2, S4. The productivity of reacting CO and the distribution of products were calculated in terms of moles C per g of Mo per hour from pseudo-steady-state data. These units were chosen to enable a direct comparison of reaction products. The carbon distributions shown in terms of productivity in units of moles of C per gram of Mo per hour quantified from the GC data for the MoKMMO catalyst for 10% 13C2-ethanol co-feeds (Fig. S4a) and for 10% 13C2-ethylene (Fig. S4b) co-feeds are within 20% of closure (Table S1). The K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst showed deviations within 10% of closure for 10% 13C2-ethylene co-feed (Table S1, Fig. S4c). Deviations in the carbon balance are likely attributed to the non-real-time determination of the inlet co-feed, as explained in SI, and deviations of the internal standard (N2) during reaction. All catalysts were passivated at the completion of the reaction, in situ, with 1% O2 in He for 8h at room temperature at 20mL/min. Catalysts were placed in a vial under nitrogen and stored in a desiccator. Ex situ characterization of the reaction-aged catalysts was performed via nitrogen physisorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A Micromeritics Tristar II was used for collecting nitrogen physisorption isotherms at −196°C after the reaction-aged catalysts were heated to 200°C under vacuum for 10h prior to the analysis. A Philips X-pert diffractometer was used using Cu-Kα radiation to collect XRD patterns of reaction-aged catalysts. 13C NMR liquid samples were prepared by adding reaction products (300μL) into CDCl3 (600μL) with THF (50μL) as the internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AVIII-400 spectrometer using broad band proton decoupling. All chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) with reference to the center CDCl3 solvent peak at 77.0ppm. Quantitative measurements were made by suppressing the Nuclear Overhauser Effect using an inverse gated decoupling pulse sequence (zgig) and utilizing a 90° pulse angle with a sufficiently long pulse delay of 200s to ensure complete recovery, as determined from an inverse recovery T1 experiment. GC–MS liquid samples were prepared by adding reaction products and THF (internal standard) in the ratio of 10:1 into acetone (solvent). GC–MS analysis was conducted on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S. The MS absolute intensity for all m/z of EtOH, 1-PrOH, and 1-ButOH products was normalized by the highest THF absolute intensity at m/z =42.5 to compare unlabeled and labeled co-feed experiments. 13C NMR gas samples were prepared by pressurizing gas-tight NMR tubes to 80psig after pulling vacuum on the tubes. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AVIII-400 spectrometer using broad band proton decoupling. Measurements were made by suppressing the Nuclear Overhauser Effect using an inverse gated decoupling pulse sequence (zgig) and utilizing a 30° pulse angle with a pulse delay of 6s. GC–MS gas samples were prepared by pressurizing gas-tight NMR tubes to 70psig after pulling vacuum on the tubes. An Agilent 6890 GC coupled with a Micromass AutoSpec mass spectrometer were used for GC–MS analysis. The mass spectrometer was set to a mass resolution of 3000. The GC column used was an Agilent DB-5. The column was held at 30°C. Splitless injections were made, and the mass spectrometer was scanned from 10 to 110Da at 0.5s/decade."
2,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of the reaction-aged catalysts are shown in Fig. S5. The diffraction peaks present in the reaction-aged K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts can be indexed to the hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS: 00-037-1492). While the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst showed the [002] MoS2 plane at 14° (indicative of MoS2 stacking) [41], the [002] MoS2 plane was negligible in the reaction-aged MoKMMO catalysts. This indicates a low degree of stacking associated with the predominant double MoS2 layer formation over this catalyst [38]. The reaction-aged MoKMMO catalysts do show relatively broad peaks for the MoS2 [100] (33°) and [110] (58°) and peaks characteristic of MgO at 44° and 64°. Table S2 shows the BET surface areas calculated from N2 physisorption data (P/P0 of 0.06–0.2) for the reaction-aged catalysts studied. The BET surface areas for the reaction-aged MoKMMO catalysts vary between 48m2g−1–63m2g−1 for co-feed experiments, similar to the reaction-aged catalysts without exposure to a co-feed [38]. As observed in previous work, the reaction-aged K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts did not exhibit measurable porosity [38]. There is no measurable difference in the textural properties in the reaction-aged catalysts after co-feed exposure compared to those with only syngas hydrogenation exposure."
3,13C2-ethanol co-feed,"3.1 13C2-ethanol co-feed The major product distribution quantified from the GC data for 10% 13C2-ethanol (13C2-EtOH) co-feed for the MoKMMO catalyst is shown in Fig. S1a. The 13C2-EtOH co-feeds strongly perturbed the product distribution toward 1-propanol and 1-butanol over the MoKMMO catalyst, similar to what has been previously observed with unlabeled co-feed experiments [38]. It was previously hypothesized that CO insertion is likely the predominant pathway to higher alcohols (Fig. 1 ), as the chain growth probability decreased with increasing carbon chain length. It was also hypothesized that 1-propanol formation likely occurs through CO insertion into an ethyl species (C2H5*) (derived from co-fed ethanol) to form a propionyl species (C2H5CO*) that can be hydrogenated to form 1-propanol. Similarly, 1-butanol was hypothesized to be formed via hydrogenation of butanoyl species (C3H7CO*) after CO insertion into a propyl intermediate. Fig. 2 shows the 13C carbon enrichment of major products for the 13C2-EtOH co-feed. A carbon was determined to be enriched as a result of the 13C2-EtOH co-feed (open boxes) if the enrichment factor was greater than that of the unlabeled ethanol co-feed (solid boxes). An example of 13C carbon enrichment of 1-propanol over the MoKMMO catalyst for 13C2-EtOH can be observed in Fig. S6. All the carbons in 1-propanol include a center peak attributed to unlabeled 1-propanol, and a doublet attributed to J coupling with the adjacent labeled carbon. Note that the C1 in 1-propanol is not enriched (Fig. 2) and the doublet observed for this carbon (C1) is attributed to the significantly enriched adjacent C2 carbon. For 13C NMR analysis, the methanol peak area was normalized to one, as a means to account for experimental error between unlabeled and labeled experiments, since methanol productivity is not influenced by ethanol or ethylene co-feeds. The addition of the center peak and doublet areas normalized by the area of THF represents the 13C carbon enrichment in Fig. 2. It is important to note that only singlets (corresponding to the center peak in labeled co-feed experiments) were observed for unlabeled co-feed experiments attributed to the natural 13C abundance. As expected, both carbons in ethanol were significantly enriched (also observed with GC–MS in Fig. S7) when 10% 13C2-EtOH was co-fed, as only ∼56–67% of the ethanol is converted to higher chain products (Table S1). It is evident in Fig. 2 that preferential enrichment of the terminal carbons of the C3–C4 alcohols occurred. This is further supported by MS analysis, where 13C2-1-PrOH and 13C2-1-ButOH were observed (SI). The MS spectrum of 1-PrOH for 13C2-EtOH co-feed shows no 13C enrichment of the C1 carbon ([13CH3OH]+ fragment with m/z =32) when compared to the unlabeled ethanol co-feed, further suggesting that the terminal carbon is not enriched (Fig. S8). The terminal carbons in 1-butanol are preferentially enriched, suggesting that 1-butanol formation primarily occurs through CO insertion into a propyl intermediate (derived from a propoxy intermediate in the route to 1-propanol, as shown in Fig. 1). These results elucidate that the findings by Santiesteban et al. [21], suggesting that CO insertion is the primary pathway for higher alcohol synthesis over unsupported K2CO3/Co/MoS2, extend to supported catalysts (i.e. MoKMMO). Specifically, 1-propanol and 1-butanol formation over the MoKMMO catalyst primarily proceeds through CO insertion into an alkyl intermediate to form an acyl precursor that can be hydrogenated to produce the corresponding alcohol (Fig. 1). Even though the C1 and C2 13C carbon enrichment is subtle with increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feed over the MoKMMO catalyst compared to the unlabeled ethanol co-feeds (Fig. 2), the peaks in the NMR spectrum provide compelling evidence that 13C4-1-butanol species, indicative of ethanol self-coupling, are present in experiments with the 13C2-EtOH co-feed. A doublet is observed for the C1 in 1-butanol for the 13C2-EtOH co-feeds (Fig. 3 ) in addition to the center peak attributed to unlabeled 1-butanol, indicating that the C2 in 1-butanol is labeled. This is different from the 1-butanol 13C NMR spectrum with the 10% 13C2-ethylene (13C2-ethylene) co-feed (discussed below in Section 3.2), where no doublet could be observed for the C1 in 1-butanol (in addition to the center peak attributed to unlabeled 1-butanol), indicating that the C2 is not enriched. Therefore, the doublet observed for the C2 for 1-butanol for 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiments is attributed to J coupling with the significantly enriched C3 in 1-butanol. The doublet observed for the C2 in 1-butanol for the 13C2-EtOH co-feed suggests that the adjacent C1 or C3 in 1-butanol is enriched. The MS spectrum of 1-butanol for the 13C2-EtOH co-feed, shown in Fig. S9, provides evidence that the C1 in 1-butanol is enriched, as enrichment of the [13CH3OH]+ fragment with m/z = 32 was observed compared to the unlabeled ethanol co-feed (not observed with 13C2-ethylene co-feed). The doublet observed for C3 and C4 and the 13C enrichment in Fig. 2 provide evidence that both C3 and C4 are labeled and preferentially enriched, as explained above. In addition, Fig. S10 shows that the ratio of the doublet to the center peak increases for both C1 and C2 in 1-butanol for increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feeds, indicated by an increase in the ratio of the coupling between 13C1 and 13C2. The combination of these results elucidate the presence of 13C4-1-butanol molecules with the 13C2-EtOH co-feed, suggesting that ethanol or ethanol-derived species self-coupling to 1-butanol occurs, particularly with increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feed. However, the preferential enrichment of the terminal carbons in 1-butanol indicates that ethanol or ethanol derived species self-coupling to 1-butanol proceeds to a smaller extent as a secondary pathway compared to CO insertion over the MoKMMO catalyst. The work of Christensen et al. on K/CoMoS2 and Santos et al. on K/MoS2 catalysts previously suggested that higher alcohol formation proceeded not only through CO insertion, but also via aldol condensation of ethanol to 1-butanol with ethanol and nitrogen (syngas-free) co-feed experiments [23,24]. The caveat of their syngas-free ethanol reaction is that it may be more (or less) likely to facilitate the ethanol self-coupling reaction due to the presence of a nitrogen atmosphere, with the reaction potentially occurring differently in a syngas atmosphere [22]. This observation highlights the importance of this work as the first study to conclusively show evidence for ethanol self-coupling to form 13C4-1-butanol species in a syngas atmosphere over a K/MoS2 based catalyst. The distribution of other oxygenates quantified from the GC data for the 13C2-EtOH co-feed for the MoKMMO catalyst is shown in Fig. S3a. The MoKMMO catalyst shows a variety of important products, as observed before with unlabeled co-feed experiments [38]. Ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate formation increases with increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feeds, suggesting that ethanol is a precursor to these species [38]. Similarly, propyl propionate and propyl acetate increase with increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feeds, likely a result of increasing 1-propanol formation, as 1-propanol is likely the precursor of these species. Fig. 4 shows the 13C carbon enrichment of the minor products for the 13C2-EtOH co-feed. It can be observed that the ethoxy group is preferentially enriched for ethyl acetate, suggesting that the ethoxy species (C2H5O*) derived from ethanol reacts with an acetyl species (CH3CO*) (not enriched at 3% 13C2-EtOH). Similarly, the terminal carbons in the propoxy group (C3H7O) of propyl acetate are preferentially enriched, indicating that a propoxy intermediate (formed in the route to 1-propanol) reacts with an acetyl species to form propyl acetate. This is in agreement with the study by Santiesteban et al., where they observed that the methyl group of methyl acetate was preferentially enriched with a 13C-MeOH co-feed, suggesting that methanol is a building block for methyl acetate, formed via an acetyl intermediate reacting with a methoxy anion [21]. With increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feed (6.1% 13C), the methyl carbon (CH3) in the acetyl group (CH3CO) of ethyl acetate becomes slightly enriched relative to the 13C carbon enrichment of the propoxy group. No significant enrichment in the methyl carbon in the acetyl group of propyl acetate can be observed, as the increase in formation of ethyl acetate is significantly higher (∼40%) than that of propyl acetate with increasing 13C2-ethanol co-feed. Since the enrichment of the acetyl group is only apparent in ethyl acetate with abundant (6.1%) 13C2-EtOH in the syngas feed, it can be concluded that hydrogenation of an acetyl species (CH3CO*) to the ethoxy intermediate (C2H5O*) is largely irreversible under the conditions employed (Fig. 1). It was previously hypothesized that ethyl propionate is formed via esterification of propionate (produced in the route to 1-propanol) with the co-fed ethanol [38]. Fig. 4 shows that both ethyl groups of ethyl propionate are preferentially enriched. Similarly, the terminal carbons in the propionate species and the propyl group are enriched in propyl propionate, suggesting that propyl propionate is formed via esterification of propionate with 1-propanol. These results elucidate that propionate species are formed via esterification of propionate with the corresponding alcohol. Additionally, it was hypothesized that the increase in 2-methyl-1-propanol formation observed over the MoKMMO catalyst with increasing ethanol co-feed was associated with the increase of 1-propanol derived species that coupled with methanol [38]. Even though it is not conclusive which of the methyl groups of 2-methyl-1-propanol is enriched, it can be concluded that only one of the methyl groups is labeled, as only a doublet is observed for the C2 carbon in isobutyl alcohol (in addition to the center peak attributed to unlabeled isobutyl alcohol). Therefore, the preferential enrichment of terminal carbons of 2-methyl-1-propanol over the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-EtOH indicates that 1-propanol is coupled with methanol to form isobutyl alcohol."
4,13C2-ethylene co-feed,"3.2 13C2-ethylene co-feed The major product distribution quantified from the GC data for the 13C2-ethylene co-feed for the MoKMMO catalyst is shown in Fig. S1b. Similar to the 13C2-EtOH co-feeds, the 13C2-ethylene co-feeds shifted the product distribution toward C3–C4 alcohols from C2–C3 alcohols over the MoKMMO catalyst, as previously observed with unlabeled co-feed experiments [38]. It was hypothesized that alcohol formation from ethanol co-feed proceeds through the same intermediate as olefin carbonylation, as similar C3+OH formation rates were observed for 13C2-ethanol and 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiments when the major products were normalized by mol C of co-feed (Fig. S2) [38]. This hypothesis was supported by the work of Santiesteban et al. on a K2CO3/Co/MoS2 catalyst, where they observed 1-propanol containing 13C in two alternative positions (13CH3CH2CH2OH and CH3 13CH2CH2OH, but not 13CH3 13CH2CH2OH) with a 13CH3OH co-feed suggesting that CO insertion could occur on symmetric ethylene species [21]. Similar to the 13C2-EtOH experiments, it is evident in Fig. 5 a that preferential enrichment of the terminal carbons of the C3–C4 alcohols occurred over the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiments. This is further supported by MS analysis, where 13C2-1-PrOH and 13C2-1-ButOH were observed (SI). Fig. S11 shows peaks for [13C2-M]+ with m/z =62 for doubly label 1-PrOH, and its corresponding [13C2-M−H]+ with m/z =61. Even though no [13C2-M]+ with m/z =76 was present for 1-butanol (Fig. S12), the peak at m/z =58 attributed to [13C2-M−H2O]+ indicates the presence of doubly labeled 1-butanol. Note that this peak is only present in the 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiment (not in the unlabeled ethylene co-feed). It can therefore be concluded that alcohol formation from ethanol proceeds via the same acyl intermediate as olefin carbonylation over the MoKMMO catalyst. It is important to note that the C1 in 1-propanol and C2 in 1-butanol are not enriched (Fig. 5a) and the doublets observed for these carbons are attributed to J coupling with the significantly enriched C2 carbon in 1-propanol and C3 in 1-butanol, respectively. It has been previously observed that an ethylene co-feed significantly enhances the 1-propanol formation over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst, unlike an ethanol co-feed, which was largely unreactive [38]. However, the 13C2-ethylene co-feed over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst does not influence the product distribution to C3+OH as significantly as over the MoKMMO catalyst (Figs. S1b, and S1c), supported by significantly lower 13C2-ethylene conversion (50–58%) over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst compared to 100% 13C2-ethylene conversion over the MoKMMO catalyst, as shown in Table S1. Similar to the MoKMMO catalyst, preferential enrichment of the terminal carbons of the C3–C4 alcohols over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst was observed with 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiments (Fig. 5b), also supported with GC–MS analysis (Fig. S13–S14). As discussed above, the doublet observed for the C1 in 1-propanol and C2 in 1-butanol is attributed to J coupling with the significantly enriched C2 in 1-propanol and C3 in 1-butanol, respectively. Relatively lower 13C enrichment of the terminal carbons in 1-butanol was observed over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst compared to that of the MoKMMO catalyst, consistent with the hypothesis that ethylene has the propensity to more favorably adsorb on smaller K/MoS2 domains over the MoKMMO catalyst compared to large, multilayer K/MoS2 domains over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst [38]. Therefore, these observations provide support that the intimate contact between the K/MoS2 domains and MMO has a synergistic effect in higher alcohol formation. The distribution of other oxygenates quantified from the GC data for 13C2-ethylene co-feed over the MoKMMO catalyst is shown in Fig. S3b. As previously observed, propyl acetate and propyl propionate formation increases with increasing ethylene co-feeds over the MoKMMO catalyst, suggesting that 1-propanol is a precursor to these species [38]. Similar to the 13C2-EtOH co-feed over the MoKMMO catalyst, only the propoxy group in propyl acetate is preferentially enriched with 13C2-ethylene (Fig. 6 a), providing further evidence that acetate species formation proceeds through the reaction of an alkoxy species and acetyl species (CH3CO*). The propyl group and the terminal carbons in the propionate group are preferentially enriched in propyl propionate with 13C2-ethylene, similar to 13C2-EtOH. The terminal carbons of propanal can be observed to be enriched with 13C2-ethylene over the MoKMMO catalyst (Fig. 6a), as relatively more propanal is formed with ethylene co-feeds than ethanol co-feeds [38]. More apparent than with 13C2-EtOH, the terminal carbons of 2-methyl-1-propanol were preferentially enriched with 13C2-ethylene, indicating that the increased propanal formation, likely via ethylene hydroformylation, can lead to coupling with methanol to form isobutyl alcohol. Although the productivity to other oxygenates is significantly smaller for the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst compared to the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-ethylene co-feeds (Fig. S3b-c), similar 13C carbon enrichments in propanal, propyl acetate and propyl propionate were observed for both catalysts (Fig. 6a and b). It is important to note that the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst does catalyze 1-propanol plus methanol coupling to isobutyl alcohol, 1 1 Fig. S14c of Catal. Sci. Technol. 2016, 6, 1957–1966 has incorrect product labels. Refer to Fig. S3c for accurate product distribution. as the terminal carbons of isobutyl alcohol were labeled with 13C2-ethylene, similar to those over the MoKMMO catalyst. This suggests that the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst does contain the acid-base pairs necessary to catalyze isobutyl alcohol formation."
5,Gas sample analysis for 13C2-EtOH and 13C2-ethylene co-feeds,"3.3 Gas sample analysis for 13C2-EtOH and 13C2-ethylene co-feeds As previously observed, the co-fed 13C2-ethylene more strongly enhanced the formation of ethane compared to the 13C2-ethanol co-feed over the MoKMMO catalyst (Fig. S1a–b) [35]. Consistent with the reaction productivity results, the 13C NMR spectrum for the gas sample for the 13C2-ethylene co-feed over the MoKMMO catalyst showed a higher intensity singlet for C2H6 than the gas sample for 13C2-EtOH co-feed (Fig. 7 ). Similarly, a singlet is observed for C2H6 over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst with 13C2-ethylene co-feed. Even though it can be observed via 13C NMR that ethane is enriched over the MoKMMO and K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts with 13C2-EtOH and 13C2-ethylene co-feed experiments, it cannot be determined whether singly and/or doubly labeled ethane are present. GC–MS was used to investigate this issue further. It was found that doubly labeled ethane is likely present in reactions using both 13C2-EtOH and 13C2-ethylene co-feeds (Fig. S15–S17), but it cannot be ruled out that singly labeled ethane is also present due to fragment analysis complexity (refer to SI for further discussion). CO and CO2 singlets were observed in the 13C NMR spectra of the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-EtOH co-feed, while no peaks were observed for the unlabeled co-feed experiments over these catalysts under identical reaction and 13C NMR conditions, indicating the presence of 13CO and 13CO2. Additionally, 13CH4 was observed with GC–MS analysis (not observed via 13C NMR) over the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-EtOH (Fig. S15). As discussed above, with increasing 13C2-EtOH co-feed (6.1% 13C), the methyl carbon (CH3) in the acetyl group (CH3CO) of ethyl acetate becomes slightly enriched, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of the ethoxy intermediate (C2H5O*) to an acetyl species (CH3CO*) is reversible to a small extent. Therefore, it is likely that the step involving CO insertion to the acetyl species (CH3CO*), shown in Fig. 1, is also reversible, leading to the formation of 13CO and 13CH4, with 13CH4 formed from an enriched methyl precursor (13CH3*). 13CO2 is hypothesized to be formed over the MoKMMO catalyst through the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, as K/MoS2-based catalysts have a high WGS activity, which makes 13CO2 an inevitable product [42–44]. With a 13C2-ethylene co-feed the 13CO and 13CO2 singlet decreases in intensity over the MoKMMO catalyst compared to that of the 13C2-EtOH co-feed. This observation indicates that the formation of 13CO and 13CH4 from 13C2-ethylene is expected to occur to a lesser extent than with the 13C2-EtOH co-feed, as the deoxygenation of the ethoxy species (C2H5O*) to form ethyl species (C2H5*) is likely largely irreversible in a reducing syngas atmosphere. Consistently, negligible 13CH4 is observed with GC–MS analysis over the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-ethylene co-feed (Fig. S16). Less intense CO and CO2 singlets were observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst when compared with that of the MoKMMO catalyst for 13C2-ethylene co-feeds, indicating that the formation of 13CO and 13CO2 with 13C2-ethylene co-feeds is catalyst dependent, and; therefore, is unlikely to occur in the gas phase. It is thought that ethylene has the propensity to more favorably adsorb on smaller K/MoS2 domains over the MoKMMO catalyst as compared to large, multilayer K/MoS2 domains present in the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst, supporting the lower 13CO and 13CO2 formation over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst [38]. Additionally, 13CH4 is observed over the K/bulk-MoS2 catalyst with a 13C2-ethylene co-feed (Fig. S17), further supporting that 13CO and 13CH4 formation likely occurs via an enriched acetyl precursor (13CH3CO*). Furthermore, it is important to note that the carbonyl groups of the acetate and propionate species were not enriched with 13C2-EtOH nor 13C2-ethylene co-feed over the MoKMMO and K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts, thus providing evidence that the carbonyl carbon for these species originated from syngas CO. Similarly, CO insertion of 13CO originating from 13C2-EtOH and 13C2-ethylene likely occurs on a minor scale, as the C1 carbon from 1-PrOH and 1-ButOH shows little to no enrichment with both 13C NMR and GC–MS analysis."
6,Conclusions,"Syngas conversion to higher alcohols was studied over the known MoKMMO and K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts using 10% 13C2-ethanol and 10% 13C2-ethylene co-feeds, as a means to elucidate the reaction pathways to higher alcohols. Analysis of the 13C carbon enrichment via 13C NMR clearly showed that (i) preferential enrichment of terminal carbons in C3–C4 alcohols over the MoKMMO catalyst occurred, and (ii) 13C4-1-butanol is observed during reaction over the MoKMMO catalyst with a 13C2-ethanol co-feed (not present with 13C2-ethylene co-feed) providing conclusive evidence for ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol. It is concluded that higher alcohol formation over K/MoS2 based catalysts primarily occurs through CO insertion, and the MMO support facilitates ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol to only a small extent as a secondary pathway. Acetate species are formed via an acyl precursor reacting with an alkoxy anion, and propionate species are formed via esterification of propionate with the corresponding alcohol. 13C2-ethanol co-feeds additionally showed that the hydrogenation of acetyl species (CH3CO*) to ethoxy species is largely irreversible. It is also concluded that isobutyl alcohol formation observed over both the K/bulk-MoS2 and the MoKMMO catalysts occurs via methanol coupling with 1-propanol or 1-propanol derived species. Formation of 13CO and 13CH4 over the MoKMMO and K/bulk-MoS2 catalysts with 13C2-ethylene co-feeds and over the MoKMMO catalyst with 13C2-ethanol co-feed provides evidence that 13CO and 13CH4 formation likely occurs via an enriched acetyl precursor (13CH3CO*) derived from either a 13C2-ethylene or 13C2-ethanol."
