0,Introduction,
1,Hydrogen as a source of renewable energy,"1.1 Hydrogen as a source of renewable energy Excessive use of non-renewable fossil fuels, such as petroleum and coal, is problematic due to finite fossil fuel resources, and for the state of the environment (Sambusiti et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2013). Hydrogen is considered as a promising alternative, due to its clean combustion product (i.e., water) and high energy density by mass (i.e., 142kJ/g of higher heating value) (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Guwy et al., 2011). The major source of hydrogen production (steam reforming of natural gas) is a mature technology but is soured from fossil fuel (Xia et al., 2015b). A second mature source (water electrolysis) converts electricity to hydrogen; the sustainability of the produced hydrogen is dependent on the sustainability of the electricity generation."
2,Hydrogen via anaerobic fermentation,"1.2 Hydrogen via anaerobic fermentation In contrast, hydrogen production via anaerobic fermentation can be considered a green source of energy and can be renewable and sustainable (Matsumura et al., 2014; Saady, 2013; Sambusiti et al., 2015). The soluble metabolic products (SMPs) derived from fermentation can be used for the production of biofuels and biochemicals (Guwy et al., 2011; Motte et al., 2015). The substrate choice is critical in establishing the green credentials of hydrogen fermentation (Sambusiti et al., 2015)."
3,Seaweed as a source of hydrogen,"1.3 Seaweed as a source of hydrogen Marine seaweed (macroalgae) biomass, which may be derived from mass cultivation and/or natural algal blooms, offers an attractive option for biohydrogen production. Seaweed has many advantages over conventional biomass from food crops and cellulosic materials. These include: high biomass productivity; growth in a marine environment (not requiring arable land); and lack of lignin and hemicellulose which allows easy fermentation and minimises requirement for substrate pre-treatment (Matsumura et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013). Nevertheless, there are challenges in hydrogen fermentation using seaweeds as substrates."
4,Suitability of carbohydrates in seaweed for hydrogen production,"1.4 Suitability of carbohydrates in seaweed for hydrogen production Carbohydrates are the most important components for hydrogen production; monomers derived from carbohydrates involve the basic fermentation reactions (Sambusiti et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2015a). The carbohydrate monomers derived from land-based biomass are dominating by glucose and xylose, hydrogen production from which, has been extensively investigated (de Vrije et al., 2007; Fang and Liu, 2002; Lin and Cheng, 2006; Pierra et al., 2014; Salerno et al., 2006; Tien Anh et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2009). However, carbohydrate monomers, such as mannitol, may dominate seaweed (Wei et al., 2013) and have a remarkable effect on the performance and potential of hydrogen production from seaweed (Xia et al., 2015a). Mannitol (C6H14O6) is a typical seaweed carbohydrate, which can be 20–30% of dry weight in brown seaweeds (Matsumura et al., 2014). Mannitol is a simple sugar alcohol with high solubility in water, however, it is difficult to ferment particularly in an anaerobic environment; this makes it a challenge for biohydrogen production (Wang et al., 2013)."
5,"Components of seaweed, which adversely affect hydrogen production","1.5 Components of seaweed, which adversely affect hydrogen production Seaweeds usually have much higher sodium content as compared with land-based biomass, due to their origin in the marine environment (Matsumura et al., 2014). A high sodium concentration may adversely affect the hydrogen fermentation process (Kivisto et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Pierra et al., 2014; Sambusiti et al., 2015; van Niel et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2005). Furthermore, the high content of proteins (7–20% of dry weight) in seaweeds may produce excess ammonia/ammonium during anaerobic degradation (Wei et al., 2013). The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) level is considered another important parameter in hydrogen fermentation (Salerno et al., 2006; Sambusiti et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2009)."
6,Objectives,"1.6 Objectives Hydrogen fermentation using mannitol as a substrate is rare in the literature (Heyndrickx et al., 1991; Matsumura et al., 2014); no literature was found used mixed anaerobic inoculum. Moreover, the impacts of sodium and TAN concentrations on hydrogen production from mannitol have yet been investigated. The use of the seaweed carbohydrate mannitol as a model substrate for fermentative hydrogen production would be helpful for the understanding of the fermentation process treating seaweeds and beneficial for the further process optimisation. Thus the objects of this study are to: • Calculate the theoretical specific hydrogen yields (SHYs) of mannitol fermentation via different metabolic pathways. • Assess the impacts of parameters (initial pH, sodium concentration, TAN concentration and mannitol concentration) on the fermentation process. • Analyse overall energy conversion. • Assess further SMP utilisation approaches."
7,Methods,
8,Inoculum,"2.1 Inoculum The mixed anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB) were separated from the anaerobic digestion sludge collected from a farm digester treating dairy slurries, food wastes and grease wastes. The sludge was pre-treated in an autoclave at 100°C for 30min to suppress the non-spore-forming hydrogen consumers (e.g., methanogenic microorganisms), then was acclimated three times (3days each time) to activate spore-forming AFB (e.g., Clostridium butyricum) for subsequent fermentation (Xia et al., 2015a). The acclimation medium was modified according to a previous study as follows (all values per litre): mannitol, 20.0g; tryptone, 3.0g; yeast extract, 1.0g; NaCl, 3.0g; K2HPO4, 2.5g; MgCl2, 0.1g; FeCl2, 0.1g; l-cysteine, 0.5g; vitamin liquid, 10.0mL; and trace element liquid, 10.0mL. The compositions of the vitamin and trace element solutions were descripted in a previous study (Cheng et al., 2012). The contents of total solids and volatile solids (VS) in the inoculum were 7.0%±0.4% and 4.0%±0.2%, respectively."
9,Fermentation processes,"2.2 Fermentation processes Batch fermentation tests were conducted in triplicate in two AMPST II systems (Bioprocess Control, Sweden). This system mainly includes a sample incubation unit (600mL glass bottles placed in a water bath), a carbon dioxide fixing unit (120mL glass bottles with 3M NaOH solutions) and a gas volume measuring device (gas tipping device equipped with pressure and temperature sensors). 30mL of acclimated AFB and 270mL of basal medium were added to a glass bottle. The total fermentation volume was 300mL. The initial pH was measured by a pH metre (Jenway 3510, UK) and adjusted by using 6M NaOH or 3M HCl solutions. In pH trials, the initial compositions of the fermentation liquor were as follows (g/L): mannitol, 10; NH4Cl, 1.34 (or 25mM); NaCl, 2.93 (or 50mM); K2HPO4, 2.5g; MgCl2, 0.1g; and FeCl2 0.1g. The initial pH was tested in 7 steps (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0±0.05). A control run was operated without mannitol under an initial pH of 7.0±0.05, whereas other experimental parameters were set the same as experimental runs. In TAN concentration trials, the initial compositions of the fermentation liquor were as follows (g/L): mannitol, 10; NH4Cl in the range 0–26.75 (or 0–500mM); NaCl, 2.93 (or 50mM); K2HPO4, 2.5g; MgCl2, 0.1g; and FeCl2 0.1g. The NH4Cl concentration was tested in 7 steps (0, 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500mM). The initial pH was set as 8.0±0.05. A control run was operated without mannitol under initial NH4Cl concentration of 1.34g/L (or 25mM). In sodium concentration trials, the initial compositions of the fermentation liquor were as follows (g/L): mannitol, 10; NH4Cl, 1.34 (or 25mM); NaCl in the range 0–58.5 (or 0–1000mM); K2HPO4, 2.5g; MgCl2, 0.1g; and FeCl2 0.1g. The NaCl concentration was tested in 8 steps (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 1000mM). The initial pH was set as 8.0±0.05. A control run was operated without mannitol under initial NaCl concentration of 2.93g/L (or 50mM). In mannitol concentration trials, the initial composition of the fermentation liquor were as follows (g/L): mannitol in the range 0–40g/L; NH4Cl, 1.34 (or 25mM); NaCl, 2.93 (or 50mM); K2HPO4, 2.5g; MgCl2, 0.1g; and FeCl2 0.1g. The mannitol concentration was tested in 6 steps (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40g/L). The initial pH was set as 8.0±0.05. A control run was operated without mannitol. The bottles were sequentially sealed with rubber stoppers, purged with nitrogen gas, and then maintained at 37.0±0.5°C by a water bath for 72h during fermentation. A mixing system was employed for each bottle to provide a mixing speed of 60rpm, which switched between on and off for 60s periods. The produced biogas was released from the bottle headspace, passed through 3M NaOH solution, and then the flow rate was recorded by a gas tipping device. The hydrogen volumes were automatically normalised to standard temperature (0°C) and pressure (1atm) and zero moisture content by the AMPST II system."
10,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid, butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, valeric acid and caproic acid from the fermentation effluent were quantified by a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent HP 6890, USA) using a flame ionisation detector (FID) and a Nukol fused silica capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm; Sigma–Aldrich, USA). Argon was used as a carrier gas. The concentrations of lactic acid, ethanol and mannitol were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Agilent 1200, USA) using a refractive index detector (RID) and a Hi-Plex H column (300mm×7.7mm; Agilent, USA). 0.005M H2SO4 was used as elution fluid. The specific hydrogen yield (SHY, mL H2/g mannitol or mol H2/mol mannitol) was defined as the ratio of the maximum cumulative hydrogen volume (mL or mol) to the initial mannitol input (g or mol). No hydrogen was produced in the control runs (inoculum without mannitol). The data on SMP concentrations were obtained by subtracting the SMP concentrations in the experimental runs from the SMP concentrations in the control runs to minimise the errors caused by the inoculum. The specific yields of ethanol (g ethanol/g mannitol or mol ethanol/mol mannitol) and butyric acid (g butyric acid/g mannitol or mol butyric acid/mol mannitol) were defined as the ratios of the concentrations of ethanol (g/L or mM) and butyric acid (g/L or mM) to the initial mannitol concentration (g/L or mM). The energy conversion efficiency was calculated based on the quantities and the higher heating values of acetic acid (874kJ/mol), propionic acid (1527kJ/mol), lactic acid (1364kJ/mol), (iso−) butyric acid (2184kJ/mol), (iso−) valeric acid (2837kJ/mol), caproic acid (3492kJ/mol), ethanol (1367kJ/mol), hydrogen (286kJ/mol) and mannitol (3025kJ/mol) (Xia et al., 2015a). The hydrogen production efficiency (HPE) was defined as the ratio of the SHY (mL H2/g mannitol or mol H2/mol mannitol) to the theoretical maximum SHY (615.4mL H2/g mannitol or 5mol H2/mol mannitol). All of the trials and measurements were conducted in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean±standard deviation."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Metabolic pathway and theoretical specific hydrogen yield,"3.1 Metabolic pathway and theoretical specific hydrogen yield The main metabolic pathways in mannitol fermentation are as shown in Fig. 1 . Mannitol is first converted to fructose-6-phosphate, coupled with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generation (Gow and Gadd, 1995; Wei et al., 2013). Fructose-6-phosphate is then converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is also an intermediate product in glucose fermentation and can be further converted to pyruvate as well as the end products, such as lactic acid, ethanol, acetic acid and butyric acid (Lee et al., 2012). Hydrogen is usually produced via combining protons and electron donors, which can be in the forms of reduced ferredoxin and NADH, with the hydrogenase acting as a catalyst. The electron donor consumption can be equally considered as hydrogen consumption (Saady, 2013). To our knowledge, the theoretical SHYs of mannitol through various SMP production pathways during fermentation have yet to be reported in the literature. A theoretical analysis of the main fermentation reactions associated with hydrogen production and consumption are presented in Table 1 . Compared with glucose fermentation, mannitol fermentation can offer higher hydrogen production potential due to the excess NADH generation in the conversion of mannitol to fructose-6-phosphate. The theoretical SHYs reaches 5mol H2/mol mannitol (615.4mL H2/g mannitol) and 3mol H2/mol mannitol (369.2mL H2/g mannitol), via acetic acid and butyric acid pathways in mannitol fermentation, respectively, as compared with 4mol H2/mol glucose (497.8mL H2/g glucose; acetic acid pathway) and 2mol H2/mol glucose (248.9mL H2/g glucose; butyric acid pathway). The lactic acid and ethanol pathways do not produce hydrogen in glucose fermentation (Angenent et al., 2004; Saady, 2013), whereas these pathways offer a theoretical SHY of 1mol H2/mol mannitol (123.1mL H2/g mannitol) in mannitol fermentation. The production pathways of proponic, valeric and caproic acids consume hydrogen in glucose fermentation (Angenent et al., 2004; Saady, 2013). They also show negative effects for hydrogen production using mannitol as a substrate, with theoretical SHYs of −1mol H2/mol mannitol (−123.1mL H2/g mannitol), −13mol H2/mol mannitol (−1600.0mL H2/g mannitol) and −3mol H2/mol mannitol (−369.2mL H2/g mannitol), respectively. Methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis pathways may also consume hydrogen during fermentation by mixed AFB. Nevertheless, methanogenesis is easily to suppress via (1) inoculum pre-treatment such as heat shock and (2) operational parameters such as high organic loading rate, low pH and high volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration. In contrast, homoacetogenesis is relative difficult to inhibit in mixed cultures, because it is not dependent on the inoculum pre-treatment, the substrate, reactor type or operational parameter (Saady, 2013). As shown in Table 1, all of the hydrogen production and consumption pathways show negative free energy changes under standard conditions; this indicates they are thermodynamically favourable. Nevertheless, increased hydrogen levels in the fermenter headspace improve the thermodynamic favourability for hydrogen consumption pathways, whilst reducing the thermodynamic favourability for hydrogen production pathways."
13,Effect of initial pH on hydrogen and SMP production,"3.2 Effect of initial pH on hydrogen and SMP production The effects of initial pH on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 2 , and the effects of initial pH on SMP production are shown in Table 2 . The low initial pH of 4.0 was not advantageous for hydrogen production, exhibiting a SHY of 44.8mL H2/g mannitol. Meanwhile, the mannitol utilisation efficiency (MUE) was only 32.3%, and the total SMP concentration was only 1.13g/L. This is mainly attributed to the fact that the activities of AFB are inhibited at a low pH condition (Saady, 2013). When the initial pH increased from 5.0 to 8.0, the SHY gradually increased from 83.0±3.0mL H2/g mannitol to 224.2±5.7mL H2/g mannitol, meanwhile the MUE increased from 55.0% to 100.0%. The increased initial pH improves the activities of AFB and stabilities of hydrogenase at the starting stage, thereby resulting in increases in MUE and SHY. As a result, the SMP concentration consistently increased from 3.67g/L to 4.95g/L. The SMPs mainly comprised butyric acid (48.9–51.8%) and ethanol (38.6–40.7%), which are responsible for hydrogen production (Table 1). The pH decreased with the production of VFAs, such as butyric acid, although the use of K2HPO4 (2.5g/L) has a certain ability to buffer the pH changes during fermentation. The final pH ranged between 4.3 (initial pH of 5.0) and 4.7 (initial pH of 8.0). In previous studies that controlled pH during the hydrogen fermentation, suggested optimal pH ranged between 5.5 and 6.5 (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Fang and Liu, 2002). Nevertheless, in these trials without pH control, the optimal initial pH may be higher when compared to values obtained in constant pH trials, to offset the inhibitory effect caused by pH drop during the fermentation. When the initial pH increased to 9.0, the SHY reduced to 173.4±21.6mL H2/g mannitol, whereas the MUE remained at 100.0%. The SMP concentration slightly decreased to 4.15±0.29g/L. The butyric acid production in the initial pH of 9.0 significantly decreased by 20.7% as compared with the initial pH of 8.0, indicating that the hydrogen production via butyric pathway has been reduced. Furthermore, some unidentified pathways may be enhanced (e.g., succinic acid production), which also reduce the hydrogen production. When the pH further increased to 10, the SHY significantly decreased to nearly zero. The total SMP concentration was only 0.3±0.06g/L, whereas the MUE remarkably reduced to 8.8%. As a result, the final pH in the fermentation effluent still remained at 9.7±0.04. These results imply the AFB are not adaptable to such an alkaline environment; their activities and metabolisms are seriously inhibited. Overall, the initial pH of 8.0 is an optimal condition for hydrogen production, therefore this value is selected for the further trials."
14,Effect of TAN concentration on hydrogen and SMP production,"3.3 Effect of TAN concentration on hydrogen and SMP production The effects of TAN (including ionised ammonium and unionised ammonia) concentrations on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 3 . The effects of TAN concentrations on SMP production are shown in Table 3 . When TAN concentration increased from 0mM (0g/L of NH4Cl concentration) to 25mM (1.34g/L of NH4Cl concentration), SHY gradually increased from 207.4±4.5mL H2/g mannitol to 224.2±5.1mL H2/g mannitol. The MUE remained at 100.0%, whereas the SMP concentrations, dominating by butyric acid (51.8–54.0%) and ethanol (38.6–39.7%), ranged between 4.60±0.21 and 4.95±0.40g/L. This suggests an efficient mannitol fermentation is associated with butyric acid and ethanol pathways. Nitrogen is an important element for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids as well as enzymes of AFB. An appropriate TAN concentration is beneficial to bacterial growth and hydrogen fermentation (Sambusiti et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2009). With a further increase in TAN concentration to 50mM (2.68g/L of NH4Cl concentration), no significant effect on the production of hydrogen or SMP was been detected. When the TAN concentration increased from 100mM (5.35g/L of NH4Cl concentration) to 500mM (26.75g/L of NH4Cl concentration), the SHY significantly reduced from 130.6±5.9mL H2/g mannitol to 20.5±3.7mLmL H2/g mannitol, and the MUE decreased from 76.5%±6.1% to 26.1%±4.0%. A high TAN concentration may cause seriously inhibition, because it can change the intracellular pH, increase the maintenance energy demand, and inhibit the enzyme associated with hydrogen production (Sambusiti et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2009). In the TAN concentration of 500mM, the SMP concentration was only 0.65±0.03g/L, with the ethanol and butyric acid percentages of 66.7% and 0.5%, respectively. The high ethanol percentage and low butyric acid percentage obtained at a high TAN concentration is consistent with previous studies using glucose as a substrate (Wang et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2005). These results indicate a change in AFB community and shift in metabolic pathways under a high TAN concentration (Wang et al., 2009). The free (unionised) ammonia nitrogen (FAN) is more inhibitory to AFB because of its high permeability to cell membrane, which leads to proton imbalance and potassium deficiency (Chen et al., 2008). The equilibrium between ionised ammonium and FAN is as shown in Eq. (1). The FAN concentration can be calculated via Eq. (2) (Rajagopal et al., 2013). (1) NH 3 + H 2 O ↔ NH 4 + + OH - (2) FAN = TAN 1 + 10 - pH 10 - 0.09018 + 2729.29 T ( K ) When the fermenter operated at a pH of 4.0 and 37°C, FAN only represents 0.001% of TAN, whereas FAN increases to 1% and 11% at pH of 7 and 8, respectively. FAN does not usually show a major inhibitory effect in fermentation due to its low percentage at low pH (e.g., 5–7), which is caused by the accumulation of VFAs. However, in the trials at TAN concentration of 500mM and initial pH of 8.0, FAN concentration can be as high as 57mM (798mg/L); this may cause an acute inhibition at the initial stage of the fermentation (Rajagopal et al., 2013). The previous studies suggested optimal TAN concentrations for hydrogen fermentation usually ranging between 7 and 71mM (98 and 994mg/L), mainly depending on the inoculum source, pH and temperature (Salerno et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009). A long time inoculum acclimation from a low concentration to a high concentration of TAN may be an effective approach to improve the inhibitory threshold (Salerno et al., 2006). In this study, the TAN concentration of 25mM (350mg/L) is an optimal condition for hydrogen production, therefore this value is selected for the further trials."
15,Effect of sodium concentration on hydrogen and SMP production,"3.4 Effect of sodium concentration on hydrogen and SMP production The effects of sodium concentrations on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 4 , and the effects of sodium concentrations on SMP production are shown in Table 4 . The SHY was 105.7±3.7mL H2/g mannitol, and the MUE was 92.5%±1.1% under a sodium free environment (0g/L of NaCl concentration). As the sodium concentrations increased from 25mM (1.46g/L of NaCl concentration) to 50mM (2.93g/L of NaCl concentration), the SHY gradually increased from 184.9±21.9mL H2/g mannitol to 224.2±5.7mL H2/g mannitol, and the MUE achieved 100.0%. These results may be attributed to the fact that a proper sodium gradient can improve the activity of NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, thereby improving the reduction of ferredoxin and providing more possible electron donor for hydrogen production. In addition, more substrates can be actively transported into the AFB cells because of an unbalanced sodium gradient caused by a high extracellular sodium concentration (Lee et al., 2012). Nevertheless, higher SMP concentrations of 5.29–5.71g/L were obtained under 0–25mM of sodium concentration as compared with that that obtained under 50mM of sodium concentration. These results can be attributed to the enhancement of intracellular component degradation of AFB under a hypoionic stress (AFB transferred from the acclimation medium at a high sodium concentration of 51mM to the fermentation medium at a low sodium concentration 0–25mM) (Carrieri et al., 2010). As the sodium concentration increased from 100mM (5.85g/L of NaCl concentration) to 400mM (23.40g/L of NaCl concentration), the SHY gradually reduced from 158.9±7.9mL H2/g mannitol to 128.7±2.7mL H2/g mannitol, and the MUE decreased from 80.4%±2.4% to 71.2%±0.2%. This result implied AFB were moderately inhibited with the increasing sodium concentration. Zheng et al. reported a 50% reduction of SHY at sodium concentration of 443mM using glucose as a substrate (Zheng et al., 2005). As the sodium concentration increased to 600mM (35.10g/L of NaCl concentration), which is close to the salinity of seawater, the SHY dropped significantly to 18.6±6.8mL H2/g mannitol, while the MUE decreased to 27.5%±3.0%, and the SMP concentration decreased to 1.17±0.24g/L. These results indicate a serious inhibition in substrate utilisation and hydrogen production. Under a high sodium concentration, excess sodium is pumped out of the AFB cells by consuming ATP. The significant increase of cell maintenance energy demand can inhibit the growth of AFB (Lee et al., 2012). Furthermore, a high cation concentration may lead to the cell lysis of AFB (van Niel et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2005). This is obviously of issue for hydrogen production from seaweed (containing mannitol) and is a rationale for washing seaweed to reduce salt content. As the sodium concentration further increased to 1000mM, the SHY decreased to nearly zero, whereas the MUE reduced to 9.8%. The SMP concentration was only 0.24±0.03g/L, dominating by ethanol (75.3%±6.1%). The high ethanol percentage can be attributed to the significant change in AFB community and a shift in metabolic pathways under such a high sodium concentration. Lee et al. reported a significant inhibition of the butyric acid pathway at a high sodium concentration using glucose as a substrate (Lee et al., 2012). Only a few bacteria, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus megaterium and Halocella cellulolytica, were reported to be activated in hydrogen fermentation under saline conditions (Pierra et al., 2014). The non-halophilic AFB acclimated in a fresh water environment in this study, can hardly tolerate a high sodium concentration close to seawater level (600mM of sodium concentration). Nevertheless, direct use of the marine or saline inoculum, as well as use of inoculum after long term adaption to a high sodium concentration, may reduce the inhibition in hydrogen fermentation in a high sodium environment (Kivisto et al., 2010; Pierra et al., 2014). In this study, the optimal sodium concentration of 50mM is an optimal condition for hydrogen production, therefore this value is selected for the further trials. This optimal sodium concentration is very close to that (optimal sodium concentration of 43mM) obtained in a previous study using glucose as a substrate (Lee et al., 2012). It is very difficult to exclude the inhibition effect from chloride ion, both in the NaCl and NH4Cl trials. However, the previous study suggests that the inhibition caused by chloride ion is relative low as compared with sodium and TAN under the same concentrations during hydrogen fermentation (Lee et al., 2012)."
16,Effect of mannitol concentration on hydrogen and SMP production,"3.5 Effect of mannitol concentration on hydrogen and SMP production The effects of mannitol concentrations on hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 5 , and the effects of mannitol concentrations on SMP production are shown in Table 5 . As the mannitol concentration increased from 2.5g/L to 10g/L, the SHY gradually increased from 171.1±4.7mL H2/g mannitol to 224.2±5.7mL H2/g mannitol, whereas the MUE remained 100.0%. AFB can efficiently use all of the mannitol at a low substrate concentration. Nevertheless, a certain amount of mannitol was consumed by the cell growth of AFB rather than hydrogen fermentation, thereby resulting in a low SHY under a low substrate concentration (Wang et al., 2013). As the mannitol concentration further increased to 40g/L, the SHY gradually decreased to 32.4±0.02mL H2/g mannitol, and the MUE decreased to 17.1%. The high mannitol concentration can lead to fast substrate degradation at the initial stage of fermentation, resulting in a significant increase of VFAs; this can further cause the pH decrease, which inhibits AFB activities and causes SHY reduction."
17,Comparison of SHYs between mannitol and other model substrates,"3.6 Comparison of SHYs between mannitol and other model substrates Fermentative hydrogen production from carbohydrate monomers and glycerol has been widely reported in previous studies (Table 6 ) (de Vrije et al., 2007; Fang and Liu, 2002; Kivisto et al., 2010; Lin and Cheng, 2006; Maru et al., 2013; Pierra et al., 2014; Salerno et al., 2006; Seifert et al., 2009; Tien Anh et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2009). The theoretical maximum SHY from glucose, xylose and glycerol are 4mol/mol, 10/3mol/mol and 3mol/mol, respectively, based on the 100% of acetic acid pathway (Maru et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2015a). The high SHYs are usually accompanied by the dominating acetic acid pathway, whereas other SMP production pathways (e.g., butyric acid, lactic acid and ethanol) implies less hydrogen production or more hydrogen consumption (de Vrije et al., 2007; Fang and Liu, 2002; Maru et al., 2013; Seifert et al., 2009; Tien Anh et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2009). Most of the previous studies were conducted under a mesophilic condition (e.g., 25–40°C), providing SHYs of 99.8–389.6mL H2/g substrate, corresponding to the HPEs of 13.7–67.5%. Increasing fermentation temperature to a thermophilic condition (e.g., 50–80°C) not only increases the metabolic activities of AFB and enhances the thermodynamic favourability of hydrogen production reactions, but also inhibits most of the mesophilic hydrogen consumers, thereby improving the process stability and efficiency of hydrogen fermentation (Xia et al., 2015a). As a result, high SHYs of 418.1–696.3mL H2/g substrate, corresponding to the HPEs of 84.0–95.3%, can be obtained under a thermophilic environment (Table 6). However, the increasing energy demand to maintain a high temperature may make the thermophilic process less attractive. Only a few studies have been conducted using mannitol as a substrate for hydrogen fermentation under mesophilic conditions. Matsumura et al. obtained a maximum SHY of 209.2mL H2/g mannitol, corresponding to the HPEs of 34.0%, using marine bacteria Vibrio tritonius as the inoculum at 37°C (Matsumura et al., 2014). Heyndrickx et al. reported a maximum SHY of 219.1mL H2/g mannitol, corresponding to a HPE of 35.6%, using mannitol as a sole substrate and Clostridium pasteurianum as an inoculum at 37°C (Heyndrickx et al., 1991). In this study, a maximal SHY of 224.2mL H2/g mannitol (1.82mol H2/mol mannitol), corresponding to a HPE of 36.4%, was obtained by heat pre-treated anaerobic digestion sludge at 37°C. Single-species culture may be efficient for the fermentation of simple substrates such as sugars. Nevertheless, for complex biomass treatment, single-species culture can hardly degrade all of the substrates, because it cannot produce all of the enzymes that are required for the degradation of complex substrates. In addition, single-species culture is sensitive to inhibitors and easily contaminated (Jobard et al., 2014). In contrast, mixed cultures possessing high microorganism diversity allow complementarity of functions; this can make the consortium more adaptable to various substrates and enhance the degradation efficiency in treating complex mannitol-based biomass, such as seaweeds. Moreover, mixed cultures are more resistant to bacterial contamination and inhibitors, making it more suitable for future large-scale applications (Jobard et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2015a). In a further study, the mixed cultures, which were used in this study, can efficiently degrade and ferment Laminaria digitata (a brown seaweed naturally grown in Irish coastline). An SHY of 79.6±1.2mL/g VS was obtained via a three day fermentation (data not published)."
18,Fermentation as a platform for the production of biofuels and biochemicals,"3.7 Fermentation as a platform for the production of biofuels and biochemicals The energy conversion efficiencies of mannitol fermentation are shown in Fig. 6 . The fermentative products from the optimal run were mainly composed of hydrogen (224.2mL H2/g mannitol or 1.82mol H2/mol mannitol), butyric acid (0.256±0.015g butyric acid/g mannitol or 0.52±0.03mol butyric acid/mol mannitol) and ethanol (0.191±0.021g ethanol/g mannitol or 0.75±0.08mol ethanol/mol mannitol). The overall energy conversion efficiency was 96.1%±7.4%, mainly in the form of hydrogen (17.2%±0.4%), butyric acid (38.3%±2.2%) and ethanol (34.2%±3.7%). These results suggest mannitol fermentation under an optimal condition is efficient in energy conversion. In contrast, the TAN (500mM of TAN concentration) and sodium (600mM of sodium concentration) inhibition cases only provided low energy conversion efficiencies of 11.2%±0.8% and 20.6%±4.3%, respectively. For the inhibition cases most of the energy (72.5–73.9%) remained in the residual mannitol. Furthermore, a small amount of energy in mannitol can be converted to unidentified SMPs (such as succinic acid) as well as AFB biomass (Wang et al., 2013). The produced hydrogen and ethanol have the potential to be used as vehicle fuels, whereas VFAs need further a conversion process. VFAs can be used as substrates for: production of hydrogen via photo fermentation; production of methane via anaerobic digestion; production of biodiesel through microalgae and yeasts; and direct electricity generation in microbial fuel cells (Motte et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2015b). Furthermore, VFAs also can be used as external carbon sources for denitrification in wastewater treatment. A higher economic value may be obtained when VFAs are used as substrates for the production of various chemicals such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, alcohols and aldehydes (Chang et al., 2010; Motte et al., 2015)."
19,Conclusion,"Mannitol, which may be derived from seaweeds, provides theoretical SHYs of 5, 3 and 1mol H2/mol mannitol via acetic acid, butyric acid and ethanol pathways, respectively. Heat pre-treated AFB were demonstrated as an efficient inoculum to convert mannitol to hydrogen, VFAs and ethanol. The optimal run provided a SHY of 1.82mol H2/mol mannitol (224.2mL H2/g mannitol), corresponding to a HPE of 34.0%, and an overall energy conversion efficiency of 96.1%, mainly comprising hydrogen (17.2%), butyric acid (38.3%) and ethanol (34.2%)."
