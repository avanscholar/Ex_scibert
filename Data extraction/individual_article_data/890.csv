0,Introduction,"Nowadays, fossil energy resources are principally used to meet most of the global energy needs. Current energy consumption data suggests that soon, there will be significant problems and challenges related to energy supply and demand. Combustion of fossil fuels provide to emissions of carbon particles, CO2 and harmful gases such as SOx and NOx to the atmosphere [1,2]. Therefore, environmentally friendly fuels, which are both easy to store and cost-effective, are of huge significance for sustainable development [3]. Hydrogen is an perfect candidate as an energy carrier [4]. Currently, various of technologies are used to production of hydrogen. However, only a small group of them can be recognized as environmentally friendly. Hydrogen production by steam reforming of hydrocarbons (natural gas) is a dominant technology, but this technology requires high temperatures (700–1100 °C) and emits large amounts of CO2 [5]. For this reason, water splitting using light is one of the most interesting advances to hydrogen production. The water separation process can be carried out at an ambient temperature and pressure conditions, and what is most important is environmentally friendly. When higher alcohols are used as sacrificial agents, H2 production can also be associated with the production of high value products (i.e. acetaldehyde) derived from selective alcohol oxidation [6,7]. Among various semiconductors, TiO2 has been extensively investigated due to its photosensitivity, chemical and thermal stability, low toxicity, and finally low cost. However, there are some limitations of its applications, it has a large band gap (about 3.2 eV for anatase), which makes it sensitive only to light below 387 nm in the ultraviolet (UV) range, and high recombination rate of electron-hole pairs [8,9]. Attempts have been made to fine tune the conduction band and/or valence band to shorten the band gap [10,11]. Another way to facilitate charge separation is to couple TiO2 with another conductor. Graphene, as a two-dimensional sp2 carbon network arranged in a honeycomb structure, is one of the most commonly used materials in recent years for that purpose. It has unique mechanical, optical, electronic and catalytic properties [12,13]. Composite materials containing TiO2 and graphene may demonstrate increased photocatalytic activity due to very good mobility of electrons in the excited state, which hinders electron-hole recombination. There are many reports in the literature on various photocatalysts based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with TiO2, CdS, WO3, BiVO4, ZnO [14–20]. Particular attention is focus to the graphene-TiO2 nanocomposite. Sun et al. [21] synthesized graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites by simply covering the functionalized graphene with P25 nanoparticles by heterogeneous coagulation. Li et al. [22] reported a novel Au@CdS/RGO/TiO2 heterostructure as photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation via splitting water. Moon et al. [23] develop not only organic-electron-donor-free, but also noble-metal-free TiO2-based photocatalytic system for the generation of H2O2; in-situ formation of cobalt phosphate (CoP) was achieved on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/TiO2 composite. Mou et al. [24] reported N-doped graphene (NGR) composite photocatalysts (NGR/TiO2) for solar energy conversion. Liu et al. [25] develop a facile method to synthesize TiO2–graphene composites with different exposed crystal facets for hydrogen production. Liu H., et al. [26] prepared RGO/TiO2 nanocomposites which were synthesized by a straightforward procedure using TiCl3 as both reducing agent to reduce GO and the precursor of TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The photocatalytic effect of reduced graphene oxide, despite many studies, is still the subject of many new studies because of the complexity of the rGO structure (hybridized atoms, variety of functional groups, defects, etc.). The idea of a composite with rGO allows increasing the photocatalytic efficiency because both the specific reaction sites and the photo-corresponding range are improved. This work shows a facile method to obtain TiO2–rGO composite photocatalysts by a hydrothermal method and investigation of the effect of calcination temperature on hydrogen's photoproduction. These composites exhibit better hydrogen photoproduction activity than TiO2."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Photocatalysts were obtained by mixing reduced graphene oxide and titanium dioxide, which was provided by Grupa Azoty Zakłady Chemiczne “Police” S.A. company (Poland) as a crude titanium dioxide slurry. A solution of ammonia (25%, Avantor Performance Materials Poland S.A.) was added to the crude slurry until pH = 6.8 and dried at 105 °C for 24 h. This material was denoted as starting-TiO2. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was supplied by NANOMATERIALS LS (Poland) and was prepared by a modified Hummer’s method. Isopropanol (purity 99.5%) was purchased from Firma Chempur (Poland)."
3,Synthesis of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the photocatalysts Photocatalysts containing graphene oxide and TiO2 were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and calcined in Ar to avoid the oxidation of rGO [27,28]. Initially, 2 g of starting-TiO2 and rGO (10 wt%) were mechanically mixed in a mortar. The material was transferred to an autoclave containing 2 mL of isopropanol. The mixture was heated at 180 °C for 4 h under autogenous pressure. To remove residual alcohol and water, the pressure valve in the reactor was open and the sample was heated for 1 h. Finally, the material was calcined at 300, 500, 700 and 900 °C for 4 h under Ar flow (60 mL/min). The resulting photocatalyst were designed as TiO2/rGO-10-300, TiO2/rGO-10-500, TiO2/rGO-10-700 and TiO2/rGO-10-900. Reference samples were obtained following exactly the same method, but without rGO (denoted as TiO2, TiO2-500 and TiO2-700 before calcination and after calcination at 500 and 700 °C, respectively)."
4,Characterization methods,"2.3 Characterization methods The phase composition and the crystalline structure of the photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The average crystallite size was calculated according to the Scherrer’s equation. Titania anatase over rutile ratio was estimated following the method described elsewhere [29]. The identification of anatase and rutile phases was based on JCPDS 01-070-7348 and 01-076-0318 standard cards, respectively. Diffuse absorbance UV–vis spectroscopy was acquired on a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer equipped with a PIV-756 integrating sphere. Barium sulphate was used as standard. The bandgap (Eg) was determined from Tauc graphs by plotting [ F R h v ] 1 / 2 as a function of hυ and extrapolating the linear portion to [ F R h v ] 1 / 2 = 0 [30]. The surface area (SBET) and porous structure of the photocatalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K on a QUADRASORB evo™ Gas Sorption analyzer. Prior to measurements, the samples were degassed at 100 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The surface area (SBET) was calculated by the multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, while the total pore volume (Vtotal) was determined on the basis of the adsorbed N2 at a relative pressure p/p0 = 0.99. The micropore volume (VmicroDR) was calculated by applying the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equation using adsorption branches of the measured isotherm. The mesopore volume (Vmeso) was calculated by subtracting micropore volume from the total pore volume. Raman spectra were collected with a Renishaw in Via Qontor confocal Raman microscope equipped with a 532.1 ± 0.3 nm laser with a nominal 100 mW output power directed through a specially adapted Leica DM2700 M microscope (x50 magnification). Spectra were acquired in the two ranges, 50–800 cm−1 and 1000–2000 cm−1, with an exposure time of 0.5 s, 1% of maximum laser power and 18 repetitions. Total carbon content was determined using a CN 628 elemental analyzer (LECO Corporation, USA). Transmission electron microscopy analysis (HRTEM and HAADF-STEM) was carried out using a FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope equipped with a field emission electron gun operating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing the powder catalysts in an alcohol suspension; a drop of the dispersion was placed over a grid with a lacey-carbon film."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production To perform the photocatalytic tests were use a tubular glass photoreactor (Fig. S1). The analyses were made at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure under dynamic conditions. Gaseous reactant mixture of H2O: EtOH = 9:1 on a molar basis, which was directly introduced in the photoreactor, was obtained with an argon stream (20 mL/min) bubbled through a Drechsel bottle containing a liquid mixture of water–ethanol. The partial pressure of ethanol was 0.30 kPa. An UV light source from SACOPA S.A.U. consisting of four LEDs emitting at 365 ± 5 nm and a synthetic quartz cylindrical lens that transmitted the light to the photocatalyst was used [31,32]. The photocatalyst samples (2 mg) were dispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated and the resultant suspension was placed onto circular porous cellulose membranes (from AlbetLabScience, pore size 35–40 µm, 80 g/m2, thickness 0.18 mm). The sizes of membrane surface covered by the photocatalyst was 1.88 cm−2. The impregnated cellulose membranes were dried at 60 °C, weighted to check for the amount of supported photocatalyst and then placed in the photoreactor. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was ca. 100,000 h−1. The irradiance over the sample was 80 ± 2 mW/cm2 as measured with a UV-A sensor (model PMA 2110, Solar Light Co.), which registered the UV radiation within spectral response 320–400 nm, connected to a radiometer (model PMA2200, Solar Light Co.). The outlet of the photoreactor was directly connected to a Varian CP-4900gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with MS 5 Å, Plot U and Stabilwax columns for a complete analysis of the photoreaction products, which were monitored on-line every 4 min. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated using equation: A Q Y = 2 n H 2 n p Â · 100 = n N A E T / E P Â · 100 where nH2 is the number of molecules of H2 generated and np is the number of incident photons reaching the catalyst. The number of incident photons can be calculated by np = ET/Ep, where ET is the total energy reaching the catalyst and Ep is the energy of a photon. ET = PSt, where P (W m2) is the power density of the incident monochromatic light, S (m2) is the irradiation area and t(s) is the duration of the incident light exposure. Ep = hc/λ, where h is the Planck's constant, c the speed of light and λ (m) is the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light. The number of hydrogen molecules can be calculated as nH2 = nNA, where n are H2 moles evolved during the time of light exposure (t), and NA is the Avogadro constant [33]. In our case, experimental conditions were: the wavelength of the incident light was λ = 365 nm, the power density of the incident light at the paper surface was P = 80 mW cm2 and the irradiation area was S = 1.88 cm2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of the samples,"3.1 Characterization of the samples The XRD profiles of the samples prepared in this work are presented in Fig. 1 . Table 1 lists the crystalline phase composition and the average crystallite size of anatase and rutile phases. The sample TiO2 used as precursor primarily consists of anatase phase (98%) with a negligible fraction of the rutile phase, according to previous reports. The XRD patterns for rGO-modified TiO2 did not show peaks corresponding to graphene. This has also been observed in our previous works [34–36] and it is related to the small amount of rGO with relatively low diffraction intensity [37] and also to the overlapping of the main rGO peak at 24.2° with that of anatase at 25.4° [38]. The appearance of rutile at the expense of anatase generally occurs at calcination temperatures higher than ca. 500 °C [39]. Above this temperature, a typical anatase-to-rutile phase transition is observed. It is interesting to note that the presence of rGO strongly inhibits the anatase-to-rutile transformation. In particular, the samples calcined at 700 °C in absence and presence of rGO (TiO2700 and TiO2/rGO-10-700) contain 72% and 16% of rutile phase, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the anatase phase exhibits much higher thermal stability after rGO modification, which is a direct proof of the intimate contact between rGO and TiO2. Also, 14% of anatase phase is found for TiO2/rGO-10 calcined at 900 °C, whereas at this temperature the bare TiO2 anatase phase fully converts to rutile [40]. This behaviour is opposite to that exhibited by TiO2 samples doped with carbon/graphite, which are strong reducing agents and promote the anatase to rutile transformation via oxygen vacancy and defect formation [41,42]. In addition, the presence of rGO also inhibited the growth of both anatase and rutile crystallites (Table 1), again pointing out to a strong interaction between rGO and TiO2. Therefore, the rGO flakes restrictTiO2 phase transformation and sintering. The morphology of the prepared photocatalysts TiO2/rGO-10–300 andTiO2/rGO-10-700 were characterized by TEM and images are shown in Fig. 2 . In both samples, HRTEM images showed TiO2 with lattice spacing of 0.36 nm, which corresponds to the anatase (101) plane. For theTiO2/rGO-10-700 TiO2 sample, lattice spacing of 0.25 nm corresponds to the rutile (101) plane. These results are in accordance with the XRD data presented in Table 1. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the samples used in this work are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding calculated band gap energy values are listed in Table 2 . The TiO2 material is characterized by high absorption in the UV region [43]. TiO2 samples calcined at 500 and 700 °C show a noticeable shift of the absorption edge into the visible region caused by the anatase-to-rutile transformation [44]; this is particularly evident for TiO2-700. Photocatalysts modified with rGO exhibit absorption in the visible region. This absorption is caused by both the rGO content and calcination, which caused changes in samples colour. Moreover, it can be observed that the absorption increases with the increase of calcination temperature. After modification with rGO and calcination, photocatalysts changed colour from white for TiO2-A180 to grey. The highest absorption in the visible region was noticed for the sample TiO2/rGO-10-900. For this sample, it can also be observed a significant shift in the absorption into the visible region related to a decrease of the energy band-gap value. Estimated band gap values for all tested nanomaterials are listed in Table 2. The band gap energy for TiO2/rGO-10-900 material is the lowest and reaches 2.95 eV (the band gap varies from 2.95 to 3.28 eV). Both shifts in the absorption into the visible region and narrowing the band gap energy are attributed to the presence of rutile in the photocatalyst [43]. The BET surface area values and pore volumes of the nanomaterials studied in this work are listed in Table 2 as well as their carbon content determined by elemental analysis. All TiO2-rGO materials exhibit similar carbon content, between 6.5 and 7.2 wt%. It is noted that a mesoporous structure characterizes the photocatalysts. The calcination of TiO2 generally led to the decrease of the SBET values and total pore volume, as expected. This is strongly related to the increase of crystallite size (see Table 1) [45]. By comparing the results obtained for rGO-decorated photocatalysts and reference TiO2 samples, it is possible to conclude that rGO modification caused a noticeable increase of the SBET surface area and total pore volume. This observation is attributed to the structural and physical properties of rGO (SBET = 310 m2/g; Vtotal = 0.32 cm3/g) [46]. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of the rGO-TiO2 photocatalysts. In all cases the spectra is dominated by the characteristic signals of anatase (presented in Fig. 4a) and the broad D and G peaks of rGO located at ca. 1300 and 1600 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 4b). The typical modes of anatase could be observed: the Eg(1) peak (148 cm−1), B1g(1) peak (394 cm−1), Eg(2) peak (637 cm−1), and the A1g + B1g(2) modes centered at 512 cm−1. No rutile peaks are visible due to their low intensity in the Raman spectra with respect to anatase. The two characteristic peaks at about 1328 and 1602 cm−1 for the graphitized structures were also observed in the Raman spectrum of the rGO-TiO2 composites. The values of the G/D intensity ratio range from 0.76 to 0.86, which are characteristic of the high disorder of the rGO structure [47]."
8,Photoproduction of hydrogen,"3.2 Photoproduction of hydrogen The samples were tested in the photogeneration of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure using a gas EtOH:H2O mixture (10% EtOH, molar) at room temperature (25 °C) at a gas hourly space velocity of GHSV = 100,000 h−1. Steady-state normalized hydrogen photogeneration rates are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be easily seen that the photoproduction of hydrogen is higher for the photocatalysts modified with rGO than for reference samples without rGO. The reference samples TiO2, TiO2-500 and TiO2-700 produced smaller amounts of hydrogen comparing with samples modified with rGO; almost an order of magnitude. Therefore, a significant increase in the photogeneration of hydrogen is associated with the combination of titanium dioxide with rGO (Fig. S2). Importantly, the production of hydrogen was stable over time. Reduced GO promotes electron mobility and decreases charge carrier recombination rate. The photogenerated electrons migrate from the TiO2 to rGO, improving the photoactivity [48]. The calcination temperature during the preparation of the photocatalysts has a strong effect on the photoproduction of hydrogen in the rGO-TiO2 samples. The phase composition of photocatalyst is one of the most crucial parameter that affects photoactivity. It is commonly known that samples consisting mainly of the anatase phase show higher activity than samples contain rutile [49]. Accordingly, the TiO2-700 and TiO2/rGO-10-900 samples containing 72 and 86% of rutile, respectively, shows definitely lower hydrogen production. The most substantial effect is observed for TiO2/rGO-10-700 photocatalyst consisting of 84 and 16% of anatase and rutile, respectively. A similar phase content is encountered in the commercial photocatalyst AEROXIDE® TiO2 P25, which is considered the standard photocatalyst. It has been demonstrated that such proportion of anatase to rutile is related to better charge carriers separation and higher activity [50]. Both effects, rGO modification and calcination process benefit the photocatalytic efficiency of the material. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of TiO2-rGO-700, calculated as described in the Section 2.4, was 2.24%, notably above the 0.18% estimated for pure TiO2 (Table S1). The production of hydrogen using titanium dioxide has been the subject of many studies. The summary of recent representative studies described in the literature carried out on TiO2 composites and the results of this study are shown in Table 3 . The catalysts prepared in this work show H2 photoproduction rates which are among the highest ever reported in the literature, competing only with nitrogen-doped TiO2-C3N4 composites. The production of hydrogen using titanium dioxide has been the subject of many studies. The summary of recent representative studies described in the literature carried out on TiO2 composites, and the results of this study are shown in Table 3. One can notice a significant increase in the photoproduction of composite hydrogen to titanium oxide alone. Titanium dioxide without the addition of rGO produced smaller amounts of hydrogen concerning the samples modified with rGO. Similar conclusions get Chen et al. [51] when investigating commercial titanium oxide and titanium oxide doped with Au. Also, Xing et al. [52] under similar conditions achieved hydrogen production for TiO2 and NiTiO3 / TiO2: 3 mmol h−1 g−1, 11.5 mmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The catalysts prepared in this work show H2 photoproduction rates, one of the highest among ever reported in the literature, competing only with nitrogen-doped TiO2-C3N4 composites."
9,Conclusions,"Composites of TiO2 with 10 wt% of reduced graphene oxide were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method and calcined at different temperatures under argon. The results revealed that the TiO2-rGO composite calcinated at 700 °C exhibited the highest performance with a hydrogen photogeneration rate of 9.53 mmol/h−1g−1. This represents a novel and useful approach to the design of a new generation of photocatalysts for the photoproduction of hydrogen because the use of TiO2 is limited by its large band gap and the relatively fast recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. One way to enhance the electron-hole lifetime in TiO2 is to combine it with rGO and suppress recombinations centers by performing a thermal treatment. The presence of rGO in TiO2-rGO composites has two strong effects on the thermal treatment with respect to bare TiO2. Firstly, it hinders sintering of TiO2; secondly, it hinders the structural transformation of anatase into rutile. These two effects, together with the concomitant electron delocalization induced by rGO in the TiO2-rGO composites, result in boosted hydrogen photoproduction rates."
