0,Introduction,"The massive use of non-renewable traditional fossil fuels can lead to global problems such as overproduction of CO2 etc., it is particularly imperative to upgrade renewable biomass resources to chemicals and fuels [1–3]. Compared with traditional fossil fuels, the biomass is a more readily available resource and can be obtained from the non-edible bagasse, corn stalks, grass, wood etc. [4]. Moreover, the chemical platform molecules derived from biomass resources usually contain more unsaturated functional groups along with aromatic rings, like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural (FAL), which are conducive for further synthesis of drugs, spices, resins and other related chemical products [5]. FAL is one of bridges that connects between the renewable biomass materials and the biorefinery industry, which is generally produced from hemicellulose and polysaccharide by acid digestion and dehydration reactions [6,7]. FAL has a great potential to prepare a large number of valuable chemical products by hydrogenation, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methylfuran (MF) and furfuryl alcohol (FOL) that can be used to produce various chemicals, resins, lysine, fragrances and so on [8]. In industrial production, FOL is mainly obtained over the copper chromite catalyst (CuCr2O4). Although the catalyst has good catalytic activity, it often requires harsh reaction conditions (higher temperature and pressure) and is easy to be deactivated. Moreover, the catalyst is harmful to the environment due to the greater toxicity of chromium [9]. Therefore, it is significant to develop an eco-friendly catalyst which can effectively catalyze hydrogenation of FAL to FOL under mild conditions. Various Cr-free catalysts of noble [10–13] and non-noble metal [14–17] have been developed widely. In general, non-noble metal catalysts (Co, Ni, Cu, Fe) are cheap and easy to prepare, but the hydrogenation reaction needs to be carried out under high temperature and/or high pressure due to the poor ability of activating hydrogen and easy deactivation of catalysts. The noble metal-based catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru) have excellent catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions, but which are limited by the high cost of noble metal. In recent years, Pt has attracted extensive attentions in the selectivity hydrogenation of FAL, and various strategies were used to improve the activity and stability of the Pt catalysts. For instance, preparing the highly dispersed single-atom catalysts [18], adding other noble or no-noble metals to improve the electronic properties of the active metal and create new active sites [19–22], modifying surface property to increase specific surface area of appropriate support [21,23] and using new loading technologies [24,25] are also effective strategies for enhancing the hydrogenation activity of supported noble metal catalysts by enhancing the metal-support interaction. Thus, finding appropriate, stable and efficient supports is significant for the hydrogenation of FAL. Recently, mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely researched in the field of photocatalysis, energy storage, gas adsorption, sensing and heterogeneous catalysis [26–28], because of its excellent electronic properties, great thermal and chemical stability, and facile preparation from abundant and inexpensive raw materials [29,30]. Different from traditional carbon materials, g-C3N4 is a nitrogen-rich carbon material with a stacked 2D nanosheet structure, which can modify the surface structure of noble metal catalysts and is suitable to disperse and stabilize noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) [31,32]. Mesoporous carbon nitride materials can be prepared by thermal polymerization of different nitrogen-containing precursors through hard or soft template methods [32–34], however, these methods usually require a complex synthesis process with long time and high cost. Herein, modified mesoporous carbon nitride supports (m-CN-x) were successfully synthesized by a simple and low-cost ammonium chloride bubble template method, the surface area and surface nitrogen species can be controlled by adjusting the amount of ammonium chloride. Pt NPs were subsequently supported on m-CN-x by a facile and eco-friendly ultrasonic impregnation assisted polyol reduction method. Among them, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst showed the best catalytic performance and conversion efficiency for FAL to FOL under mild reaction conditions and great stability. We investigated the effect of the m-CN-x supports on the structure and catalytic activity of the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts, meanwhile we also suggest that the roles of pyridine nitrogen(N-C = N), tri-coordination nitrogen (N-(C)3) and terminal amino group (C-N–H) in preparation of supported Pt."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Melamine (C3H6N6), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and FAL were purchased from Guang Fu Fine Chemical Research institute (Tianjin, China). Ethylene glycol (EG) and isopropanol were obtained from Fuyu Fine Chemical Reagent (Tianjin, China). 1-Octanol was bought from Tian Li Chemical Reagents (Tianjin, China). FOL was purchased from Zhan Yun Chemical Reagents (Shanghai, China). All of the chemicals were pure analytical grade and used as received without further purification."
3,Synthesis of supports,"2.2 Synthesis of supports The bulk g-C3N4 (b-CN) was synthesized by heating melamine in a tube furnace. In detail, 6 g of melamine was placed in boat crucible and heated to 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 4 oC·min−1 under N2. The m-CN-x support was prepared with reference to the methods of Dong and Zhang groups [35,36], and some improvements were made. In a detailed experiment, 6 g mixture precursors of melamine and ammonium chloride according to the mass ratio of melamine to ammonium chloride of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 were added into beaker with 30 mL water. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, then the mixture was treated with ultrasound for 30 min, the water was removed by dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Next the resultant solid was put in boat crucible and heated to 550 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 4 oC·min−1 under N2 to obtain the mesoporous g-C3N4. The resulting mesoporous modified g-C3N4 supports were named as m-CN-1, m-CN-2 and m-CN-3, according to the mass ratio of melamine to ammonium chloride of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, respectively."
4,Preparation of Pt/m-CN-x,"2.3 Preparation of Pt/m-CN-x The Pt/m-CN-x catalysts were prepared by a facile and eco-friendly ultrasonic impregnation assisted EG reduction method. In a typical procedure, the m-CN-x support (0.200 g) was dispersed in the 25 mL EG and 15 mL H2O solution, and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. Next, 1.593 g pre-prepared 1 wt% H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution that was obtained by adding 1.000 g H2PtCl6·6H2O into 99.00 g deionized water was added into the slurry dropwise under strong and magnetic stirring; and the slurry was further ultrasonicated for another 30 min. Then the mixture was put into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and heated at 140 °C for 24 h under stirring speed of 800 rpm. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol for five times. The Pt/m-CN-x catalysts were obtained after drying in the vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. For comparison, the Pt/b-CN catalyst was also prepared in the same way. All catalysts were stored in a dry and closed vessel."
5,Catalyst characterization,"2.4 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation (40 kV, 20 mA) and the scan range of 10–80 °. The surface area and properties of porous structures was derived from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms with a Micromeritics Tristar II porosimetry analyzer. In each case, the catalyst (more than 100 mg) was degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 5 h before the measurement. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was evaluated in a Kratos-AXIS ULTRA DLD equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out on a JEOL model JEM-2100 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800) with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The content of Pt was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a PerkinElmer Optima 7000DV analyzer. Before the test, the sample was dissolved in aqua regia and diluted with water. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were collected by Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer in the region of 600–4000 cm−1 using KBr pellet. The amount of C, H and N was tested by elemental analyzer (Vario ELIII, Elementar)."
6,Hydrogenation of FAL to FOL,"2.5 Hydrogenation of FAL to FOL The hydrogenation reaction of FAL was carried out in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave with a pressure gauge and a magnetic stirrer. In detail, the reactant mixture of FAL 0.252 g (2.602 mmol), 29 mg catalyst and 15 mL isopropanol were loaded into the autoclave with temperature-controlled furnace. Subsequently the reactor was sealed, purged three times with 4 bar H2 to remove air, and pressurized with required H2 pressure (6–14 bar). Finally, the autoclave was set to the desired temperature (40–80 °C) and stirred at 800 rpm for 0.5–4 h. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled down quickly by water bath, and 1-octanol was added to the reaction solution as an external standard. A small amount of the reaction mixture was sucked up by a Syringe, then the sample was filtered with organic phase Syringe Filter (0.45 μm, Jiangsu Green Union Science Instrument Co., Ltd) to separate the catalyst and liquid sample, lastly the liquid sample was stored in sample tube and analyzed quickly by gas chromatography (BFRL SP-3420, China) equipped with FID detector and HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). The conversion of FAL and the selectivity of FOL was calculated by external standard method. During the stability test, the catalyst was reused without any further treatment. More specifically, the catalyst was recycled by centrifugation and washing the reaction mixture with isopropanol after finishing the hydrogenation reaction and dried in the vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight, after that, the catalyst was ground and recycled for the next cycle."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Physicochemical properties of supports m-CN-x,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of supports m-CN-x The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (b-CN) and different mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (m-CN-x) supports are given in Fig. S1. The diffraction peaks are agreed with the phase of g-C3N4 (PDF JCPDS 87–1526). The typical (1 0 0) crystal plane located at around 13.1° and the (0 0 2) crystal plane at around 27.4° correspond to the in-plane tris-triazine units and the interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic units, respectively [37,38], and the b-CN and m-CN-x supports present almost the same diffraction position, indicating that the original conjugated structure of g-C3N4 is maintained after adding ammonium chloride. In detail, the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4° decreases with increasing the amount of ammonium chloride gradually from m-CN-1, m-CN-2 to m-CN-3, suggesting the hydrogen bonds of the intralayer framework are broken gradually and the long-range atomic order of the intralayer tris-triazine units becomes low [39]. The m-CN-x support with more short-range atomic order [40] is advantage of the dispersion of metal NPs due to increasing the surface area and the generating pores. The FT-IR spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the m-CN-x supports have same chemical structure with b-CN and in accordance with the characteristic infrared spectrum of the typical g-C3N4 [41], as showed in the Fig. S2. All the samples display an adsorption peak at 808 cm−1 can be ascribed to be the out-of-plane breathing mode of heptazine rings [42], the absorption band in the region of 1200 cm−1 to 1700 cm−1 corresponds to the characteristic stretching modes of N-C = N heterocyclic [41] and the broad absorption band from 3000 cm−1 to 3600 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibration of N–H stretching of the uncondensed amino groups [43]. The broad absorption band belonged to the uncondensed amino groups exhibits weaker slightly and the relative strength of N-C = N heterocyclic enhances, indicating that ammonium chloride can improve the polymerization process of g-C3N4 and only destroys the periodic arrangement of the intralayer tris-triazine units, but the basic atomic structures of the units are maintained. This is consistent with the results of XRD. The C/N ratio of the m-CN-x supports determined by elemental analyzer decreases slightly with the increase in the amount of ammonium chloride, as illustrated in the Table S1, which may be due to the fractional loss of terminal amino group from g-C3N4, because theoretically the N in the amino group is more easily lost than pyridine nitrogen and tri-coordination nitrogen [44]. But the overall C/N ratio maintains at about 0.678, the result also indicates that the original conjugated structure of the g-C3N4 does not change after adding the ammonium chloride. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured to understand the property of the surface area and pore structure of different supports, as depicted in Fig. S3 and Table S2. All samples display characteristic isotherms of type IV with H3 typical hysteresis loops, suggesting the presence of mesoporous in sheet-shaped granular materials [45]. Compared with b-CN, the BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of m-CN-x increase gradually with the content of ammonium chloride, as summarized in Table S3, demonstrating the ammonium chloride can efficiently exfoliate g-C3N4 in-situ and improve the surface area and pore structure. The XPS reveals that the O, N, C elements coexist in all supports (Fig. S4A). Three peaks can be distinguished over the N1s spectrum (Fig. S4B). The main peak at around 398.4 eV corresponds to the N-C = N, which is thought to be pyridine nitrogen, the peak at the 399.8 eV is assigned to the N-(C)3 specie and the peak at 400.7 eV may correspond to C-N–H, which is attributed to the terminal amino functional group [46,47]. The content of the surface N species over different supports was estimated by integral characteristic peak area (Table S3). Obviously, with increasing the amount of ammonium chloride, the content of N-C = N gradually increases from 26.1% (b-CN) to 33.1% (m-CN-3), the C-N–H content gradually decreases from 12.6% (b-CN) to 5.6% (m-CN-2) then increases to 6.2% (m-CN-3), while the content of N-(C)3 decreases from 15.3% (b-CN) to 10.3% (m-CN-3). These results indicate that the surface property of the g-C3N4 is influenced by the decomposition of ammonium chloride in synthesis process. Furthermore, the surface area of m-CN-x increases due to the production of ammonia gas and hydrogen chloride gas from the decomposition of ammonium chloride in the preparation process, this can promote the polymerization of the amino group (C-N–H) and destroy the periodic arrangement of the intralayer tris-triazine units, leading to the decrease of amino group and N-(C)3 content and the increase of N-C = N content. However, the addition of excess ammonium chloride can produce a large number of gases, which can further destroy the long-term ordered atomic arrangement of g-C3N4, weaken the polymerization of terminal amino group, resulting in the increase of the surface amino group content. The above results suggest that the addition of ammonium chloride not only can improve the surface area and pore structure, but also regulate the distribution of nitrogen species on the surface of the g-C3N4, however, the basic atomic structures of the tris-triazine units can still be maintained."
9,Physicochemical properties of catalysts Pt/m-CN-x,"3.2 Physicochemical properties of catalysts Pt/m-CN-x The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different Pt/m-CN-x catalysts are given in Fig. 1 . The patterns are agreed with the typical phase of g-C3N4, and a new peak can be indexed to the Pt (1 1 1) crystal plane appeared at 39.7° [48]. The intensity of the Pt (1 1 1) increases slightly from Pt/b-CN, Pt/m-CN-1, Pt/m-CN-2 to Pt/m-CN-3 that may be related to the increase in the actual loading of Pt, as proved by ICP-OES in the Table 1 . We also calculated the Pt NPs size of different catalysts from the Pt (1 1 1) crystal plane based on the Scherrer equation, as listed in the Table 1. The Pt NPs size of Pt/m-CN-1, Pt/m-CN-2 and Pt/m-CN-3 is 2.9, 2.5 and 2.8 nm, respectively, which is slightly smaller than that of Pt/b-CN (3.1 nm), suggesting that the m-CN-x support prepared by adding ammonium chloride is favor for the dispersion of Pt NPs. The surface area of the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts increases slightly compared with the corresponding m-CN-x supports (Table 1, Fig. 2 ), which may be due to the further exfoliation of the g-C3N4 supports facilitated by ultrasonic treatment [49] during the process of loading Pt NPs. The morphology and structure of the samples were further measured by SEM, TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. S5, b-CN shows bulk and aggregate structure, m-CN-2 displays a sheet morphology of partial folds. The TEM images of the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts (Fig. 3 ) reveal that Pt NPs are well anchored to the surface of the m-CN-x sheets, moreover, the size of Pt NPs on m-CN-x is smaller than that on b-CN. The average size of Pt NPs is 2.7, 2.5, 2.1 and 2.3 nm for Pt/b-CN, Pt/m-CN-1, Pt/m-CN-2 and Pt/m-CN-3, respectively (Table 1), which is consistent with the results calculated from XRD. HRTEM image of Pt/m-CN-2 (Fig. 4 B) shows a typical Pt NPs with lattice distance of 0.227 nm belonged to the (1 1 1) plane of metallic Pt, which is also agreement with the XRD result. Meanwhile, HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 4C) and EDS mapping (Fig. 4 D-F) of Pt/m-CN-2 also reveal the homogeneous distribution of C, N and Pt on the surface of the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst, which further prove that Pt NPs are highly dispersed on the m-CN-2 support. To examine the surface properties and chemical states of catalysts, XPS measurements were analyzed for different catalysts. The XPS reveals that O, N, C, and Pt elements coexist in catalysts as shown in Fig. S6A. The C1s spectrum of catalysts (Fig. S6B) can be fitted into two peaks, the peak at 284.6 eV is ascribed to C–C, which comes from the standard reference carbon, whereas the peak at 287.8 eV is attributed to the sp2-bonded carbon (N–C = N) in the triazine rings of g-C3N4 [50]. Three peaks can be distinguished by the N1s spectrum (Fig. 5 A), belonged to the N-C = N, N-(C)3 and C-N–H species. We also calculated the content of the surface N species in different catalysts showed in Table S3. Obviously, the surface N content of the Pt/b-CN and Pt/m-CN-x catalysts is lower than that of the corresponding b-CN and m-CN-x supports, as shows in Fig. 6 , which may be due to the fact that the Pt NPs are anchored on the different N species. In addition, we also calculated the contents of the surface C in different supports and catalysts presented in Table S3. The results demonstrate that the surface C content of the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts are higher compared with the corresponding supports, which prove that the Pt NPs are anchored to the nitrogen species, leading to the reduction of the surface N and the increase of the surface C. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, the XPS of Pt 4f of the Pt/b-CN and Pt/m-CN-x catalysts show two doublet peaks that corresponds to the 4f core levels of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 for two types of Pt species. The stronger peaks at 70.8 and 74.4 eV for Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 are from Pt0, and the peaks with a relatively low intensity at 72.4 and 75.5 eV can be ascribed to Pt2+ [51], which may be the formation of Pt-O or Pt-N bonds on the surface of the catalyst. Obviously, the Pt 4f7/2 binging energy of Pt0 over the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts has negative shifts 0.4 eV compared with the standard Pt0 (71.2 eV), which may be due to the strong interaction between lone pair electrons of N in support and 5d unoccupied orbitals orbital of Pt [52]. Normally, the increase in electron density on metal results in the decrease of binding energy [19], thus the XPS results indicate that Pt NPs are electron-rich derived from the strong interaction between Pt NPs and support. Besides, we also calculated the content of the Pt species on Pt/b-CN and different Pt/m-CN-x catalysts (Table 2 ). It can be seen that the content of Pt0 specie increases first and then decreases from Pt/m-CN-1 (75.1%), Pt/m-CN-2 (92.6%) to Pt/m-CN-3 (83.4%) with the increase of ammonium chloride in the preparation of the m-CN-x support, which is higher than that of Pt/b-CN (69.4%). Generally, the surface content of N species of catalyst will significantly decrease compared with the corresponding supports if the Pt NPs are selectively anchored on the different N species, because the Pt NPs will overlap on N species. Therefore, we can understand the distribution of actual N anchor sites on the surface of catalyst by counting the amount of the reduction of N species after the support load Pt NPs. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the reduction of different nitrogen species on the support surface after the Pt NPs are loaded on b-CN and different m-CN-x carriers. In other words, Fig. 7 shows the distribution of N anchor sites for Pt NPs on different catalysts. For the b-CN support, the surface content of N-(C)3, C-N–H and N-C = N is 15.3%, 12.6% and 26.1%, respectively (Fig. 6A), and the sequence of preferred anchoring of Pt NPs is as follows: N-(C)3 > N-C = N > C-N–H (Fig. 7A). With the increase in the amount of ammonium chloride for the m-CN-x(x = 1, 2, 3) support, the surface content of N-C = N gradually increases from 26.1% to 33.1%, and the surface content of N-(C)3 decreases from 15.3% to 10.3%, while the surface content of C-N–H decrease from 12.6% to 5.6% then increase to 6.2%, compared with the b-CN support (Fig. 6 B-D). We observe that the sequence of preferred anchoring of Pt NPs is as follows: N-C = N > N-(C)3 > C-N–H (Fig. 7 B-D), simultaneously, we can find that as the amount of ammonium chloride increased, Pt NPs tended to be anchored to pyridine nitrogen (N-C = N). Recently, Wang’s group suggested that the tri-coordination graphitized nitrogen contributes to the nucleation and dispersion of noble metal NPs, while pyridine nitrogen can be used as both anchor site and dispersant through experiments and DFT calculation [53]. Herein, combined the measurements of TEM and XPS, we can discover that the Pt NPs are more inclined to be anchored on N-C = N (Fig. 7), the size of Pt NPs gradually decreases from 2.7 nm to 2.1 nm and the content of Pt0 species increases from 69.4% to 92.6% with ammonium chloride from b-CN to m-CN-1 and m-CN-2 (Table 2). However, when excessive ammonium chloride is used (m-CN-3), more Pt NPs are inclined to be anchored on N-C = N (Fig. 7D), the content of Pt0 on the surface reduces slightly, and the size of Pt NPs increases from 2.1 nm (m-CN-2) to 2.3 nm (m-CN-3). These results may be due to the fact that the m-CN-2 support has more suitable anchor environments for the nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs, but the relatively little content of N-(C)3 is observed on m-CN-3. As a result, the nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs on the surface of Pt/m-CN-3 is affected, leading to the increase of Pt NPs size and the decrease of the content of Pt0. Previous study showed that modification of N species on the surface of carbon carriers is beneficial to the dispersion of noble metal, the increase of proportion of metallic species and prevent oxidization of metallic species in the air [54]. In our case, the ammonium chloride modified g-C3N4 support has a high nitrogen content more than 59 wt% and the abundant nitrogen species, especially pyridine nitrogen and tri-coordination nitrogen (N-C = N and N-(C)3), which are appropriate for stabilizing highly dispersed electron-rich Pt0 NPs, preventing their oxidation largely. To sum up, we suggest that pyridine nitrogen (N-C = N) may play the role in anchoring and dispersant, while the tri-coordination nitrogen (N-(C)3) may be beneficial to the nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs, and the combined actions of the proper amount of pyridine nitrogen and tri-coordination nitrogen are favorable for Pt NPs to disperse evenly on the surface of catalysts in the form of Pt0. Besides, the amino group (C-N–H) may be more inclined to anchor the Pt2+ species. Thus, we can adjust the surface anchoring environment of the g-C3N4 support by controlling the amount of ammonium chloride so as to regulate the nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs and the content of Pt0."
10,Hydrogenation of FAL over the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts,"3.3 Hydrogenation of FAL over the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts 3.3.1 Catalytic hydrogenation performance The selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL was chosen as a probing reaction to understand the strong interaction between Pt NPs and the m-CN-x support over the Pt/m-CN-x (x = 1, 2 and 3) catalysts. The blank experiments over these m-CN-x supports confirm that no appreciable conversion of FAL (less than 1%) is observed under the reaction conditions, indicating that the m-CN-x supports are inactive for the FAL hydrogenation reaction and the active specie of catalyzing furfural conversion is Pt NPs. In addition, the hydrogenation reaction was also performed by using 1 MPa of nitrogen instead of 1 MPa of hydrogen, and the conversion of FAL is less than 1%, which confirm that the hydrogenation reaction is indeed from the molecular hydrogenation than the transfer hydrogenation of isopropanol. As shown in Table 2, the conversion of FAL and selectivity of FOL is related to the structure of the supports, the catalytic hydrogenation activities increase first and then decrease from Pt/m-CN-1, Pt/m-CN-2 to Pt/m-CN-3 (Table 2), meanwhile, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst shows the best catalytic hydrogenation performance with 98.5% conversion of FAL and 99.3% selectivity to FOL. Apparently, these Pt/m-CN-x (x = 1, 2 and 3) catalysts display much higher catalytic activity than the Pt/b-CN catalyst under the same reaction conditions. The above results illustrate that the conversion of FAL and selectivity of FOL is related to the structure of the supports. The turnover frequency (TOF) was also calculated according to the method reported in our previous works [55], as listed in Table 2. Obviously, the TOF follows as the order: Pt/m-CN-2 (795 h−1) > Pt/m-CN-1 (753 h−1) > Pt/m-CN-3 (705 h−1) > Pt/CN (662 h−1), meanwhile, Pt/m-CN-2 shows the highest TOF with 795 h−1. According our previous works [56,57], we found that the Pt-based catalysts which have the high content of the Pt0 species and small size is efficient to improve the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde. Therefore, the excellent selective hydrogenation catalytic activity over the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst may be due to the smaller size of Pt NPs and higher content of Pt0. Compared with some excellent Pt-based catalysts used in selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL reported in recent years, as listed in Table S4, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst still shows great conversion efficiency under mild reaction conditions. Mack et al. found that different oxide carriers have great influence on the selective hydrogenation activity of FAL, when using CeO2, MgO and γ-Al2O3 as carriers, the reaction rates (in the light of the produced moles of FOL per gram of Pt per minute) were 12.8, 7.93 and 9.92 mmol·gPt -1·min−1, respectively [58]. Other examples were that, 78 mg of Pt(3)Co(3)/C catalyst converted 3.642 mmol of FAL with 100% yield of FOL in 35 mL isopropanol after 5 h at 100 °C, the rate was 5.18 mmol·gPt -1min−1 as a result [19]; 50 mg of Pt/FHP catalyst converted 8 mmol of FAL with 97.3% yield of FOL in 5 mL isopropanol after 9 h at 60 °C with 2 MPa of H2, the reaction rate reached 0.115 mmol·gPt -1·min−1 [59]. Currently, Zhang group implemented the hydrogenation of FAL with 5% mol Pt of Pt-CeO2@UIO-66-NH2 catalyst converted 0.0002 mmol of FAL with 99.0% yield of FOL in 10 mL isopropanol after 30 h at 80 °C with 1 MPa of H2, the rate of FOL produced was only 0.564 mmol·gPt -1·min−1 [24]. Besides, commercial 5%Pt/C catalyst showed less than 20% yield of FOL after 3 h at 140 °C with 60 bar H2 [60]. Obviously, the reaction conditions over the commercial catalyst are stricter and the yield of furfuryl alcohol is lower [60]. In this study, we applied 29 mg of the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst for the hydrogenation of 2.602 mmol FAL in 15 mL isopropanol at mild reaction conditions, 97.8% yield of FOL and reaction rate of 36.1 mmol·gPt -1·min−1 were achieved at 70 °C under 1 MPa H2 for 2 h. Based on the above results, the conversion efficiency of our catalyst is higher than that of most Pt-based catalysts in the literatures and the commercial catalyst. 3.3.2 Effect of reaction conditions The effects of reaction time, reaction temperature and H2 pressure on catalytic performance were conducted over the optimum catalyst Pt/m-CN-2 to get the highest yield of FOL, as displayed in Fig. 8 . Obviously, the conversion of FAL gradually increases with the reaction time (0.5–3 h), and FAL is completely converted after 3 h. But the selectivity of FOL increases first and then decreases with the extension of reaction time. At the beginning of reaction, the relatively low selectivity of FOL may be due to the lower conversion of FAL and the formation of less amount of FOL, and part of FOL can adsorb on the surface of the catalyst to lead to the low measurement value of the FOL selectivity. With prolonging reaction time, the selectivity of FOL increases along with the FAL conversion. When the reaction time is 4 h, FAL achieves complete conversion, and the main-product FOL will continue to undergo hydrogenation reaction to produce tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol or undergo pyrogenic decomposition reaction to produce other by-products, leading to the decrease of the selectivity of FOL [21] (Fig. 8A). The selectivity of FOL and the conversion of FAL also can be found to have the same fluctuation by increasing reaction temperature (Fig. 8B) and H2 pressure (Fig. 8C). Thus, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity with FAL conversion of 98.5% and FOL selectivity of 99.3% under H2 pressure of 1 MPa at 70 °C for 2 h. 3.3.3 Recyclability study of catalyst The stability tests were performed to study the reusability of the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst for FAL hydrogenation at the optimum reaction conditions. For every run, the reaction was carried out at the same reaction conditions. The catalyst after the reaction was centrifugalized and washed with isopropanol and water to remove the organics adsorbed on the surface of catalyst, followed by drying in vacuum oven overnight for the next run without any other treating. As shown in Fig. 8D, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst can be reused for four times without significant deactivation, and the fifth run showed a slight decrease of 6% in activity compared with the first run. Thus, the results indicate that the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst is stable and has excellent reusability under the reaction conditions, which is of very significant to apply in industry. To investigate the cause of the slight decrease in catalyst activity, we carried out relevant tests on the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst after used 5 times (used Pt/m-CN-2). ICP-OES measurement shows that the content of Pt in used Pt/m-CN-2 is almost unchanged (2.0%) compared with the fresh Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst (Table 1), which means there is no leaching of Pt NPs in Pt/m-CN-2 in the process of reuse. The TEM image (Fig. 9 A) shows that the Pt NPs size of the used Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst (2.2 ± 0.4 nm) is also similar to that of the fresh Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst. However, the content of the Pt0 species on the surface of the used Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst (89.1%) decreases slightly about 3.5% from the XPS analysis (Fig. 9B). Thus, the slight decrease in activity for the used Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst after 5 runs may be due to the fact that the Pt0 species is partially oxidized in the cycle reaction, which also suggests that the Pt0 species is the main active species in the selectivity hydrogenation reaction."
11,Effect of supports m-CN-x on catalytic performance,"3.4 Effect of supports m-CN-x on catalytic performance In this work, we synthesized mesoporous modified g-C3N4 supports (m-CN-x) with different physical properties through the ammonium chloride bubble template method, then the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts were prepared by anchoring the Pt NPs on the surface of the m-CN-x supports through a relatively mild and eco-friendly ultrasonic impregnation assisted polyol reduction method, and applied for the selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL. The Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst presents the best catalytic performance with 99.3% selectivity to FOL and 98.5% conversion of FAL under mild reaction conditions, moreover, it can be recycled for 5 times without significant deactivation. The good catalytic activity is owing to the optimized anchoring environment of the m-CN-2 support by adding ammonium chloride in the synthesis process, leading to the improvement of the dispersion of Pt NPs and the formation of more Pt0 species on the surface of Pt/m-CN-2. In other words, ammonium chloride plays an important role in the synthesis of the m-CN-x supports, resulting in the enhanced activity of Pt/m-CN-x. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S3) and XRD results (Fig. S1) show that the addition of ammonium chloride can improve the BET surface area and pore environment of the m-CN-x supports. The large surface area is beneficial to the dispersion of Pt NPs on the m-CN-x surface, confirmed by the TEM measurements (Fig. 3), and the mass transfer of substrates and products in the reaction process. The Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst has the best catalytic activity, but its surface area is not the largest, which indicates that surface area is not the only factor affecting catalytic activity. The XPS results (Table S3) show that the distribution of N species on the m-CN-x surface can be modified by adjusting the amount of ammonium chloride, and the anchoring position of Pt NPs is related to the distribution of nitrogen species. With increasing the amount of ammonium chloride, more Pt NPs tend to be anchored on N-C = N of the m-CN-x (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, the content of the Pt0 species on the Pt/m-CN-x (x = 1–3) catalysts is higher than that on Pt/b-CN, and the surface content of the Pt0 species on Pt/m-CN-2 reaches the highest value (Table 2). The activity tests (Table 2) display that the smaller the Pt NPs and the higher Pt0 content on the surface of catalyst, the better catalytic hydrogenation performance of furfural, indicating that the modification to g-C3N4 support by ammonium chloride can effectively improve the hydrogenation activity of furfural over the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts. Moreover, we suggest that tri-coordination nitrogen (N-(C)3) is beneficial to nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs, while pyridine nitrogen (N-C = N) may be anchoring and dispersant, appropriate amount of pyridine nitrogen and tri-coordination nitrogen is favorable for Pt NPs to disperse evenly on the surface of catalysts in the form of Pt0. Besides, the amino group (C-N–H) may be the potential anchor sites for Pt2+ species. Therefore, we can adjust the anchoring environment of the surface of g-C3N4 by controlling the amount of ammonium chloride so as to regulate the nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs and the content of Pt0 species on the surface of catalysts, improving the activity of the catalyst."
12,Conclusion,"In our work, the Pt/m-CN-x catalysts, highly dispersed electron-rich Pt NPs on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride supports (m-CN-x), were synthesized by a facile and eco-friendly ultrasonic impregnation assisted ethylene glycol reduction method. The structure and surface properties of m-CN-x, including surface area and the distribution of surface nitrogen species, can be adjusted by controlling the amount of ammonium chloride. It can be found that the changes of these physicochemical properties of m-CN-x show great influences on the formation of the surface Pt species on m-CN-x, resulting in the different catalytic activity over Pt/m-CN-x. Among these catalysts, the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst exhibits not only excellent hydrogenation activity of FAL to FOL under mild reaction conditions, but also valuable recyclability, which can be attributed to the formation of highly dispersed, small-sized and electron-rich Pt NPs with high content of Pt0 on the surface of the Pt/m-CN-2 catalyst. Furthermore, we suggest that tri-coordination nitrogen (N-(C)3) is beneficial to nucleation and dispersion of Pt NPs, pyridine nitrogen (N-C = N) may be anchoring and dispersant, and the amino group (C-N–H) may be the potential anchor sites for Pt2+ species. Our work provides a new idea for modifying the surface properties of graphitic carbon nitride carrier, and supported Pt on them as the excellent selective hydrogenation catalysts."
