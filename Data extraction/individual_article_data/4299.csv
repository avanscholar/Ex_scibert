0,Introduction,"The environmental pollution, depletion of fossil carbon sources and, growing demand for clean energy are essential to the sustainable development of economics. In this context, many efforts have been made to utilize carbon dioxide as an alternative carbon source as its readily available, with no toxic byproducts of various large-scale industrial processes [1,2]. In particular, the present research focused on the effective hydrogenation of CO2 to value-added chemicals such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, as a potential alternative to fossil fuels, as an essential feedstock for the chemical industry and could play a crucial role in supply chains with reduced carbon footprints economies [3–6]. Light olefins (C= 2-4) are considered as one of the essential petrochemical building blocks engaged in the production of vast clusters of chemicals such as polymers and other derivatives. Traditionally, light olefins are produced from the steam cracking of naphtha and dehydrogenation of lower alkenes [7–9]. However, these processes are associated with a considerable amount of energy consumption and a high amount of carbon emission. Recently, Fe based catalysts were extensively used for the synthesis of olefins from CO2 [10–12]. However, the reverse water-gas-shift reaction, methanation, and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis occur concomitantly over Fe based catalysts with the CO2 hydrogenation, which produce a series of carbon containing by-products such as CO, CH4, and paraffins, and thus resulting unsatisfactory selectivities and yields for the formation of olefins [13]. Numerous works have attempted to modify Fe based catalysts by adding secondary elements and then to increase the reaction rates of CO2 hydrogenation along with tuneable selectivity to afford desired reaction products. Decoration of alkali atoms, e.g. Na [11,14,15], K [11,16,17], Rb [12], or Cs [11] into Fe based catalysts, may promote the generation rate of iron carbide as an active phase for the formation of olefins [11,16], tune the surface basicity of the Fe based catalyst [18], modify the adsorption properties of the catalyst for either reactants or reactive intermediates to suppress the formation of CH4 formation and the re-adsorption of olefins [14,17], enhance the stability of iron carbide during catalysis [15], or change the identities of surface carbon species [15]. Addition of secondary metal Cu [19,20], Co [21] or Ce [22] or metal oxide (ZnO [23] or MnO2 [24–27]) into Fe based catalysts to form a surface alloy or decorate the Fe cluster surfaces, could alter the adsorption of CO2 and the activation of CO bonds [24,27], inhibit the subsequent hydrogenation of olefins to paraffins [24], facilitate the reduction of Fe2O3 and the formation of active Fe5C2 species [25,26]. Indeed, the structures of either Fe catalysts or modified Fe based catalysts have been examined extensively to establish the structure-performance relationship of Fe catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to olefins [28]. Despite a large number of studies, a clear connection between the structures of these Fe based catalysts and their catalytic functions in both CO2 conversion and the formations of olefins has not been unambiguously established, which was caused mainly by the complexed reaction networks for CO2-H2 reactions. In this present work, the catalytic role of Na and/or Zn addition on the performance for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, particularly to light olefins, over a Fe based catalyst thoroughly evaluated by rate measurements under either differential condition or integral conditions. The texture properties of these modified Fe based catalysts were extensively characterised by BET, CO-TPR, ex-situ XRD and, Raman spectroscopy. We have proved that CO2 hydrogenation over Fe based catalysts occurred via a combination of the primary reverse water-gas-shift reaction and the subsequent CO hydrogenations to form both olefins and paraffins. Addition of Zn into Fe catalysts altered the rates of both the primary and subsequent reactions to carbon containing products, thus did not influence the selectivities of carbon containing products. Decoration of Na into the Fe based catalysts did not affect the rates of primary reverse water-gas-shift reaction, but altered the rate dependencies for olefins formation and thus modified the relative rates of olefins formation to paraffins formation. As result of the decoration of Na and Zn into the Fe based catalyst, CO2 hydrogenation exhibited an excellent performance for olefins formation."
1,Experimental method,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Fe catalysts were prepared by a precipitation method. Normally, 10 g of Fe(NO3)3•9H2O (Aladdin, ≥ 99.99 %) were dissolved in doubly deionized water (>18.2 MΩ). Subsequently, an aqueous solution (1.2 M) of (NH4)2CO3 (Greagent, NH3 ≥ 40.0 %) was added into the Fe(NO)3 solution (0.05 M) dropwisely at 0.03 cm3 s−1 under continuous stirring at 298 ± 3 K to reach the pH value at about 8.5. The resulting precipitates were separated by filtration, washed with doubly deionized water, heat-treated at 333 K in ambient air for 10 h and then at 673 K for 4 h (0.03 K s−1) to afford the final solid (Fe2O3) as the precursor of Fe catalysts. A Fe-Zn catalyst with an atomic ratio of Fe/Zn = 2/1 was synthesized via a co-precipitation method. An aqueous Na2CO3 (Sinopharm Chemical reagent, ≥ 99.8 %) solution (0.2 M) was dropped, at a speed of 0.03 cm3 s−1 under continuous stirring at 298 ± 3 K, into 60 cm3 ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8 %) contained FeCl2 (0.22 M, Aladdin, ≥ 99.0 %) and ZnCl2 (0.11 M, Aladdin, ≥ 99.8 %) to reach the pH value at about 8.5. Subsequently, the resulted sample was washed using 20 dm3 deionized water and dried at 333 K in ambient air for 10 h. The final Fe2O3-ZnO mixture was obtained under ambient air at 673 K (0.03 K s−1) for 4 h. Catalysts with 2% Na on Fe (Fe-2Na, mass ratio of Na to Fe is 2:98) or with 2% Na on Fe-Zn (Fe-Zn-2Na, mass ratio of Na to Fe and Zn is 2:98) were synthesized by impregnating the Fe2O3 or the Fe2O3-ZnO powders with an aqueous solution containing NaNO3 (Sinopharm Chemical reagent, ≥ 99.0 %). After the impregnation, these samples were kept at 333 K under ambient air for 12 h and then heat-treated by increasing the temperature at 0.03 K s−1 to and holding isothermally at 673 K for 4 h."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The XRD characterization of these catalysts before and after CO2 hydrogenation was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, under an accelerating voltage of 40 kV and a detector current of 40 mA, with a scanning step length of 0.02° and scanning rate of 0.3 s/step over a 2θ range of 15−80°. The average particle size of different crystal phases (ZnFe2O3, ZnO, Fe3O4, and Fe5C2) in catalysts was calculated via the Scherrer equation by the width of diffraction patterns with reference to the full width of half maximum of the crystalline facets at (311) for ZnFe2O4, (101) for ZnO, (311) for Fe3O4, and (021 or 510) for Fe5C2. Raman spectrum characterization was analysed by using HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer with a laser light source of 532 nm. The surface area and pore size of these catalysts, pre-treated under dynamic vacuum at 373 K for 3 h and then 573 K for 12 h, were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption with ASAP-2460 instruction. Temperature-programmed CO reduction (CO-TPR) experiments were conducted in a micro plug flow reactor (Hiddern CATLAB) equipped with a gas analytical mass spectrometry (Hiden, QIC20). During CO-TPR, catalyst samples (0.1 g) were heat-treated in flowing 10 % CO/Ar (Jining Xieli Special Gases Co. Ltd. ≥ 99.9 %, 8.3 cm3 gcat −1 s−1) by a ramping rate of 0.083 K s−1 from 353 K to 1023 K."
4,Catalytic evaluation,"2.3 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic rates of the conversion of CO2 and the formation of carbon containing products were measured in a packed bed plug-flow reactor. The catalysts (0.1 g, 125−180 μm) were physically mixed with quartz granules (Aladdin, ≥ 99.0 %, 0.1 g, 125−180 μm) in the packed bed reactor with a quartz to catalyst mass ratio of 1:1 to avoid catalyst bed gradients in concentration and temperature. The catalyst was pre-treated in flowing 10 % CO/Ar (Jining Xieli Special Gases Co. Ltd., ≥ 99.9 %, 0.83 cm3 s−1) at 623 K (0.083 K s−1) at 0.5 MPa for 6 h, before exposure to CO2-H2 reactants at 1.5 MPa. Reactants were prepared from CO2/Ar (Zezhong Technology Co. Ltd., 25 % CO2), H2 (Jining Xieli Special Gases Co. Ltd., ≥ 99.999 %) and Ar (Jining Xieli Special Gases Co. Ltd., ≥ 99.999 %), which were controlled independently by mass flow controllers (Brooks instrument, 5850E). The concentration of gaseous products was analysed by an online gas chromatography (Ruimin Instrument (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., GC2060 System), which equipped with a TDX-01 packed-bed column connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a HP Plot-Q capillary column connected to a methanation reactor followed by a flame ionization detector (FID), and a HP Plot-Q capillary column connected to a FID detector. CO2 conversion, X C O 2 , was calculated by the ratio of the summation of a molar flow rate of carbon containing products and the molar flow rate of CO2 at the inlet of the reactor ( F C O 2 , i n , mol h−1) [Eq. (1)]: (1) X C O 2 = ∑ v i F i , o u t F C O 2 , i n where, F i, out denotes the molar flow rate of carbon containing product i (i=CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, …et al) at outlet of the reactor, v i refers the carbon number of the carbon containing product i. The conversion rate of CO2 ( r C O 2 ) or the formation rate of carbon containing products ( r i ) were calculated based on the converted molar flow rate of CO2 or the molar flow rate of carbon containing product (F i) per weight of iron (g), as expressed in Eqs. ((2) and (3)). (2) r C O 2 = F C O 2 , i n - ∑ v i F i , o u t m F e (3) r i = F i , o u t m F e The selectivity of carbon containing product i (i=CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, …et al) was defined as the rate ratio of CO2 converted into product i to CO2 reacted [Eq. (4)]: (4) S i = v i r i r C O 2 The selectivity of olefins in hydrocarbons ( S o l e f i n s ) is defined as the formation rate ratio of olefins to the summation of all hydrocarbons [Eq. (5)]: (5) S o l e f i n s = ∑ v j r j r C O 2 - r C O - r C H 4 where, v j refers the carbon number of olefin j, r j, r CO, and r C H 4 refer the formation rates of olefin j, CO, and CH4, respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physicochemical properties of the Fe based catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the Fe based catalysts The physical properties, BET surface area, pore volume, average pore diameter, and average crystallite size of the as-prepared catalyst precursor were summarised in Table 1 . In general, the addition of sodium and/or zinc as promoter increased the BET surface area of the catalyst, which was consistent with the previously reported that Zn, acts as a structural promoter, leads to an increase in the surface area of the catalyst [29,30]. Both the pore volume and the average pore diameter were decreased on the Fe catalyst after the decoration of sodium, but enhanced on the Fe-Zn catalyst. Incorporating Na and/or Zn into Fe2O3 did not alter the average crystallite size of precursor for the Fe based clusters. The as-prepared Fe-Zn-2Na exhibited higher BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter than those of Fe, Fe-2Na, and Fe-Zn catalyst. The reducibility and carbonizability of the Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts with the addition of a Na promoter were investigated by CO-TPR experiments. Fig. 1 presents the CO-TPR profiles of the as-prepared Fe based catalysts. The Fe and the Na decorated Fe catalysts show three CO consumption peaks in the CO-TPR profiles, assigned to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 (505 K), the reduction of Fe3O4 to metallic Fe (623 K), and the carbonization of Fe to iron carbide (749 K), respectively [31]. Addition of 2 % Na into Fe catalyst led all the three CO consumption peaks to appear at the higher reduction temperature, indicating Na inhibits the reduction and carbonization of Fe2O3, consistent with our previous results [15]. Fe-Zn and Na decorated Fe-Zn catalysts only show two CO consumption peaks, attributed to the dissociative reduction of ZnFe2O4 to Fe3O4 and ZnO (618 K) and the reduction and carbonization of Fe3O4 to FeCx (793 K) [31]. Fe-Zn catalysts decorated with 2 % Na also led the CO consumption peaks to shift to higher reaction temperatures (631 and 812 K), suggesting that Na suppresses the reduction and carbonization of Fe-Zn catalyst. These results indicated that the addition of Na promoter increased the temperatures for reduction and carbonization, proposed previously by modifying the surface basicity of Fe and Fe-Zn catalyst and enhancing the interaction between Fe and ZnO [32] Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Fe based catalysts before reduction and during CO2 hydrogenation. None of the crystalline Na components was observed on these Fe based catalysts before reduction and after CO2 hydrogenation, probably due to a high dispersion of Na species on Fe based catalysts. For the Fe and the Na decorated Fe catalysts, hematite Fe2O3 was the dominant phase before reduction (Fig. 2a), and the iron oxide was transferred to iron carbide (FeCx) after 10 h of CO2 hydrogenation at 593 K (Fig. 2b). The iron carbide species, such as Fe3C, Fe5C2 and FeC, and metallic Fe, might exist concomitantly in the Fe catalyst and the Na decorated Fe catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation, consistent with our previously reported results [15,27]. However, the Fe5C2 phase might be the dominant iron carbide species from the XRD pattern in Fig. 2b, reported previously as an active phase for olefin formation during both CO and CO2 hydrogenation [33–36]. For the Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts, ZnFe2O4 was detected as the dominant phase before reduction (Fig. 2a), decomposed and transferred as a mixture of ZnO and iron carbide phase during CO2 hydrogenation at 593 K (Fig. 2b). Fe5C2 was still the dominant iron carbide species in the Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts. The addition of Zn and/or decoration of Na into the Fe based catalysts did modify the crystallite size of Fe5C2 (18.0 ± 2.0 nm). The intensity of the Fe2C5 phase in the Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts was observed much higher than those in the Fe and Fe-2Na catalysts, indicating ZnO may facilitate the formation of Fe5C2. The Raman spectra were recorded to further reveal the molecular-level information on all the four Fe based catalysts before and after CO2 hydrogenation reaction under similar reaction conditions. Before reduction, the Raman spectrums of both Fe and Na decorated Fe catalysts showed six vibrational modes span from about 210 cm−1 to 620 cm−1 in Fig. 3 a, previously assigned to two A1g modes (219 cm−1 and 493 cm−1) and four Eg modes (245 cm−1, 286 cm−1, 404 cm−1, and 610 cm−1) of the D 3 d 6 crystal space group of α-Fe2O3 [37–39]. In addition, the board band centered at 1310 cm−1, assigned to a two-magnons scattering of the hematite [37–39], was shown in Fig. 3a. This result indicates that the vibrational mode of the Fe and Na decorated Fe catalysts did not vary with the addition of Na onto the surfaces of the Fe catalyst. The Raman shift spectra of Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na were different from those of Fe and Na decorated Fe catalysts. The Raman spectrums of Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts did not show any modes of either tetrahedral ZnO or Fe2O3, but showed three broad bands centred at 333 cm−1, 471 cm−1, 657 cm−1, respectively, associated with modes in cubic ZnFe2O4 spinel [40,41]. The Raman spectrums of these as-prepared Fe based catalysts were consistent with their diffraction features in XRD. These results clearly indicate that α-Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 spinel exist dominantly on the precursor of Fe catalyst and Fe-Zn catalyst, respectively, irrespective of either the addition of Na or not. Fig. 3b shows the Raman spectra of these Fe based catalyst after 10 h reaction. Two major carbon-carbon bands centred at 1339 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 were observed, related to the vibration of structurally disordered (amorphous) carbon species (D band) and sp2-bonded carbon atoms (G band) [42–44]. The presence of the D and G bands hinted the heterogeneity of the carbon species formed on the Fe based catalysts during the reaction. The D bands were further deconvoluted by Lorentz distribution into three sub-bands: D1 (at 1339 cm−1, A1g symmetry mode), D3 (at 1489 cm−1, amorphous carbon), and D4 (at 1231 cm−1, A1g symmetry mode) [42–44]. The intensity ratios of D to G band (ID/IG ratio) refer to the relative contribution of the disordered carbon and crystalline graphite carbon on the catalysts. The ID/IG ratios decreased on the Na decorated Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts, suggesting the formation of more crystalline graphite carbon during catalyst on the catalysts promoted by Na. The ID/IG ratio for all four catalyst was in order of Fe-Zn-2Na (0.97) < Fe-2Na (1.17) < Fe-Zn (1.37) < Fe (2.71). The lowest ID/IG value indicated the highest fraction of crystalline graphite carbon on the Na decorated Fe-Zn catalyst."
7,Effect of Na and Zn decoration on the conversion of CO2 hydrogenation and the distribution of products,"3.2 Effect of Na and Zn decoration on the conversion of CO2 hydrogenation and the distribution of products The conclusive effects of Zn and Na addition on the catalytic performance of the Fe based catalyst were evaluated at 593 K, total pressure of 1500 kPa and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10000 cm3 gcat −1 h−1. CO2-H2 reactions on bare ZnO, Na2CO3, or NaOH were undetectable at 553−623 K. CH4, CO, olefins and paraffins were the major carbon-containing products detected on these Fe based catalysts. The conversion of CO2 hydrogenation on these Fe based catalysts and the distribution of carbon containing products were collected after the reactivity of CO2-H2 reactions reached steady-state which the changes (per 1 h time on stream) in conversion and selectivities were less than 5 % of their respective values, and summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 4 . The CO2 conversion over the Fe catalysts (0.1 g) was 36.0 %, with carbon selectivities toward CO, CH4, and C2-C6+ hydrocarbon of 8.3 %, 48.7 %, and 43.0 %, respectively. The selectivity of C2 =-C6+ = in C2-C6+ hydrocarbon was 47.6 %, corresponding to a low olefins-to-paraffins ratio of 0.91. Decoration of 2 % Na on Fe catalysts, the conversion of CO2 decreased from 36.0 %–25.0 %, with a high CO selectivity of 13.0 % and a lower selectivity of CH4 (37.9 %) than those on Fe catalysts. However, the selectivities of all olefins in hydrocarbons increased, and those of all paraffins decreased, as shown in Fig. 4, resulting in a higher olefins-to-paraffins ratio of 5.22. Therefore, the addition of Na could alter the reverse water-gas-shift reaction and led to more CO formed during CO2 hydrogenation, and then increased the fraction of olefins in C2-C6 hydrocarbon via Fischer–Tropsch reaction (CO-H2 reaction), consistent with previously reported effects of Na and the CO2 hydrogenation reaction as a combination of the reverse water-gas-shift and the Fischer–Tropsch reactions [45–47]. Addition of 33 % Zn on Fe catalysts (molar ratio of Fe/Zn = 2/1), the conversion of CO2 remained constant in the experimental error (36 % on Fe versus 37 % on Fe-Zn), with a slightly lower CH4 selectivity of 40.2 % and a slightly higher selectivity of C2-C6+ hydrocarbon (43 % on Fe versus 51.1 % on Fe-Zn). The addition of Zn increased the selectiveties of both C2-C6+ paraffins and C2 =-C6+ = olefins to high values, leading to a constant value of the olefins-to-paraffins ratio. Decoration of 2 % Na on the Fe-Zn catalyst, the conversion of CO2 increased slightly from 37.0 %–43 %, with an increase in CO selectivity to 15.7 % and a significant decrease in CH4 selectivity to 22.8 %. The selectivity of C2-C6+ hydrocarbon increased from 51.1 % to 61.5 % with C2 =-C6+ = of 88.6 % in C2-C6+ hydrocarbon, resulting a high olefins-to-paraffins ratio of 7.31. In addition, the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS, CO2+H2=CO+H2O, Δ H 298 ° = 41 kJ mol−1) occurs concomitantly with the CO2-H2 reactions. Decoration of Na and/or ZnO into Fe based catalysts promoted the reaction extent of the RWGS reaction to approach its chemically equilibrium at 593 K, as their approach-to-equilibrium values (μ RWGS, Table 2) equal unity (1.0 ± 0.2). Thus, the partial pressures of CO2, CO, H2, and H2O and their relative ratios were determined through the thermodynamic relationship of the RWGS reaction [Eq. (6)] during the CO2-H2 reaction over the modified Fe based catalysts: (6) P H 2 O P C O P C O 2 P H 2 = K R W G S Hence, the CO2 conversion during CO2 hydrogenation over these modified Fe-based catalysts was determined by the thermodynamic activity of the RWGS reaction, irrespective to either decoration of Na or addition of Zn into Fe catalysts, depended strongly on the equilibrium constant of RWGS and the partial pressure of H2O, CO, and H2 at the outlet of the reactor. CO2-H2 reaction over Fe catalyst exhibited an extremely high carbon selectivity toward CH4 formation; however, either decoration of Na or addition of ZnO into Fe catalyst led the CH4 selectivity to lower values. Therefore, the decoration of Na and/or addition of ZnO suppressed the formation of CH4 during CO2-H2 reaction over Fe based catalysts and led to higher carbon selectivities toward C2-C6+ hydrocarbon. In addition, comparing with the Na decorated Fe catalyst (Fe-2Na), the fraction of hydrocarbon with larger carbon numbers (e.g. C4-C6+ olefins and C4-C6+ paraffins) was higher on the Na decorated bimetallic Fe-Zn catalyst (Fe-Zn-2Na), it indicates ZnO might play a crucial role in the formation of carbon-carbon bond during hydrogenation. As results of Na decoration and ZnO addition, both olefin formation and carbon-chain growth reaction were promoted to a high extent together with the suppressed CH4 formation, thus, the selectivities of all C2-C6+ olefins increased during CO2 hydrogenation."
8,Selectivities and reaction pathway for CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts,"3.3 Selectivities and reaction pathway for CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts Fig. 5 shows the selectivities of CO, olefins, and paraffins for CO2-H2 reactions on Fe based catalysts at 593 K as functions of CO2 conversion, which was varied by changing either the gas flow rates of reactants or the mass of Fe based catalysts. Conversion of CO2 decreased with an increase of GHSV from 15000 to 540000 cm3 g−1 h−1, because of the residence time of reactants on all these catalysts decreased. The carbon selectivities of both olefins and paraffins decreased with the decreasing of CO2 conversion, but CO selectivities increased as CO2 conversion decreased. None-linearly extrapolation of carbon selectivities to zero CO2 conversion could remove the contributions from subsequent reactions and give the carbon selectivities from primary CO2 hydrogenation. At zero CO2 conversion, the carbon selectivity of CO approaching to ∼100 % together with the zero values of carbon selectivities toward the formation of olefins and paraffins indicated that CO was a reaction intermediate formed primarily via reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS) during CO2 hydrogenation; other carbon containing products (olefins and paraffins) were formed concurrently via CO reacted with hydrogen in subsequent reactions. Scheme 1 shows the proposed CO2-H2 reaction networks, including a direct route from CO2 to CO in RWGS reaction and sequential CO hydrogenation routes for C2-C6+ olefins and C2-C6+ paraffins. The results were consistent with the previously reported pathway of CO2 hydrogenation, which contains both RWGS reaction and CO hydrogenation (Fischer–Tropsch) reactions [45,46]. Decoration of Na or addition of Zn into Fe catalyst affected the carbon selectivities trends through their influences on the relative rates of primary RWGS reaction and subsequent CO hydrogenations, which led to carbon selectivities toward CO, olefins, and paraffins vary with CO2 conversion differently on different Fe based catalysts. On both Fe and Fe-Zn, carbon selectivities increased with CO2 conversion in a similar trend as shown in Fig. 5, which suggested that the addition of Zn did not affect the relative rates among RWGS reactions, CO hydrogenation to olefins and to paraffins. Zn influenced the rates of carbon-carbon bond growth during the subsequent CO hydrogenation and modified the distributions of hydrocarbons with different carbon numbers (Fig. 4). Decoration of 2 % Na on both Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts, the CO selectivity decreased more slowly and the selectivities of paraffins increased more slowly with an increase in CO2 conversion up to 20 % than those on both Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts. The result indicated that Na on Fe or Fe-Zn catalysts could inhibit the rates of CO hydrogenation to paraffins formation."
9,Effect of reactant partial pressures on the CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts,"3.4 Effect of reactant partial pressures on the CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts The rates of CO2 conversion and the individual carbon containing products during CO2 hydrogenation over Fe based catalysts (Fe, Fe-2Na, Fe-Zn, and Fe-Zn-2Na) were measured under different CO2 and H2 partial pressures at a total pressure of 1500 kPa and a reaction temperature of 593 K. CO2 conversions were below 15 % and reverse water-gas-shift reaction was far away from its thermodynamic equilibrium at a high space velocity of 540000 cm3 g−1 h−1 in all rate measurements. The measured rates and selectivities remained independent of time-on-stream between 10 h and 60 h and within experimental errors (±5 %). Figs. 6 and 7 show the effects of H2 pressure (375–750 kPa H2 and 187.5 kPa CO2) and CO2 pressures (125–250 kPa CO2 and 562.5 kPa H2) on the conversion rates of CO2 and the formation rates of CO, olefins, and paraffins, respectively, during CO2-H2 reactions at 593 K on Fe, Fe-2Na, Fe-Zn, and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts. The rates of CO2 conversion, per gram of Fe atoms, increased linearly with H2 pressures on the Fe, Fe-2Na, and Fe-Zn catalysts, but increased larger than linearly with H2 pressure on Na decorated Fe-Zn catalyst. In contrast, the rates of CO2 conversion were insensitive to CO2 pressure on the Fe, Fe-2Na, and Fe-Zn catalysts, but increased slightly with CO2 pressure on Fe-Zn-2Na catalyst. The rates of CO2 conversion on both Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts were at least twice of those on Fe and Fe-2Na catalysts, indicating the addition of ZnO promotes the rates of CO2 hydrogenation. The formation rate of CO increased slightly with H2 pressure over all these four Fe based catalysts. However, CO formation rates were insensitive to CO2 pressure on Fe-2Na catalyst, but they increased less than linearly with CO2 pressures on Fe, Fe-Zn, and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts. The formation rates of C1-C6+ paraffins increased larger than linearly as the H2 pressure increases on all these Fe based catalysts. The rates of paraffins formation were inhibited slightly by CO2 pressure on Fe, Fe-2Na, and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts, and decreased significantly with CO2 contents in reactants on Fe-Zn catalyst. The formation rates of C2 =-C6+ = olefins increased larger than linearly with increasing H2 pressure on both Fe-2Na and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts, but were insensitive to H2 pressure on Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts. CO2 pressure did not influence the formation rates of C2 =-C6+ = olefins on all these Fe based catalysts. The specific rate dependencies of CO2 conversion and carbon containing products formation with respective to reactants differ during CO2 hydrogenation over different Fe based catalysts, because the addition of Na and/or Zn to Fe catalyst modified the reducibility of these Fe based catalysts and the identities of carbon species on the catalyst surfaces. The reducibility of Fe catalysts and/or the identities of surface carbon species might affect the kinetically relevant steps, active site structures, and the quantities of unoccupied Fe atoms, and thus the rate dependencies. The surface oxophilicity of the catalyst has been reported previously to determine the extent of surface oxygen and then the oxygen involvement in kinetically relevant step for C-H activation [48]. Modification of the oxophilicity of Ni catalyst by adding Co atoms lead to a transition in the rate dependence for methane reforming [48]. The rate of CO2 conversion (i=CO2) or carbon containing species i (i=CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, …) formation (per gram of Fe atoms) during CO2 hydrogenation over Fe based catalyst j (j=Fe, Fe-2Na, Fe-Zn, or Fe-Zn-2Na) is denoted as r i,j and expressed in a general power-law form below to vary with the CO2 and H2 pressures (P CO2 and P H2): (7) r i , j = k i , j P H 2 α i , j P C O 2 β i , j where k i,j is the effective rate constant, and α i,j and β i,j are the apparent reaction orders with respective to H2 and CO2 pressure, respectively, for CO2 conversion or carbon species i formation during CO2 hydrogenation over Fe based catalyst j at a constant reaction temperature of 593 K. The apparent reaction orders (α i,j and β i,j) and the effective rate constant (k i,j) were estimated using a non-linear regression of rate data with the rate expression [Eq. (7)]. The values of the apparent reaction orders corresponding to the partial pressure of CO2 and H2 at 593 K, over different Fe based catalysts, were summarised in Table 3 . As mentioned above, the addition of Na or Zn did not influence the reaction order with respective to H2 pressure for the formation of paraffins, such as CH4 (1.8–2.0), C2H6 (1.6–2.2), and C3H6 (1.4–2.4). However, the reaction order with regards to CO2 for paraffins formation exhibited a largely negative value on Fe-Zn catalysts (-1.8 to -1.1) and a slightly negative value on other Fe based catalysts (-0.6 to -0.3 on Fe, -0.8 to -0.5 on Fe-2Na, and -0.2 to 0.0 on Fe-Zn-2Na). Interestingly, the addition of Na on both Fe catalyst and Fe-Zn catalyst led to the formation of olefins, such as C2H4 and C3H6, to depend more significantly on H2 pressure (reaction orders of 0.1−0.7 on Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts versus 2.0–2.4 on Fe-2Na and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts). In contrast, the reaction orders regard to CO2 pressure for the formation of olefins did not change by adding either Na or Zn into Fe catalysts. Although, the reaction orders with respective to CO2 exhibited negative values, but they showed insignificantly negative values (-0.2 to 0.1) than those for the formation of paraffins (-1.8 to 0.0). These results are referring that higher CO2 partial pressure accounts for the formation of olefin on all Fe based catalysts, while higher H2 partial pressure is more favorable for the formation of olefins only on Na decorated Fe or Fe-Zn catalysts."
10,Effect of temperature on the reactivities of CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts,"3.5 Effect of temperature on the reactivities of CO2-H2 reaction on Fe based catalysts We explored next the effects of temperature on the catalytic conversion rates of CO2 and the formation rates of carbon containing products during CO2 hydrogenation over different Fe based catalysts. The rates of both CO2 conversion and products’ formation for CO2-H2 reactions over different Fe based catalyst were illustrated in Fig. 8 a-e, plotted as functions of reaction temperature (550−650 K). These rates exhibited distinct functional dependencies with reaction temperature over different Fe catalysts, because decorations of Na or/and ZnO into Fe catalyst might influence the activation enthalpies and entropies for these rates, and then change the ratios of rate constants for different carbon containing products and/or the relative ratio of primary and subsequent reaction rates during CO2-H2 reaction to different extents on different Fe based catalysts. The net rates of CO2 conversion on ZnO-modified Fe based catalysts (Fe-Zn and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts) were still twice of those on Fe and Fe-2Na catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation at different reaction temperatures (550−650 K). The rates increased with the rise of temperature on all Fe based catalysts, but became insensitive to reaction temperature over Fe, Fe-Zn, and Fe-Zn-2Na catalysts with a further increase in reaction temperature. The unchanged rates of CO2 conversion with reaction temperature might be limited by the thermodynamic constraints of RWGS during CO2-H2 reaction. On Fe catalysts, the reaction extent of RWGS gradually approached to chemically equilibrium with increasing reaction temperature (Fig. S2). However, the approach-to-equilibrium values (μ RWGS=P CO P H2O P H2 −1 P CO2 −1 K RWGS −1) for RWGS during CO2-H2 reaction over these Fe-based catalysts modified by either decoration of Na or addition of ZnO equalled unity (Fig. S2), irrespective to the reaction temperature. The formation rates of both CO and CH4 increased with increasing reaction temperature on all these Fe based catalysts (Fig. 8b and c). The apparent activation barrier were at a similarly low value of 25 ± 10 kJ mol−1 for CO and CH4 formation. On Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts, the formation rates of both olefins and paraffins varied with reaction temperature under the same trend: they initially increased with increasing reaction temperature until the reaction temperature reaches about 593 K, above which they maintained at constant values, as shown in Fig. 8d and e. Therefore, the ratio of olefins to paraffins on Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts were insensitive to the reaction temperature, increased slightly with the temperature. On Na decorated Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts the formation rates of olefins increased to maximum values, respectively, as the reaction temperature increases, and then decreased with increasing reaction temperature. In contrast, the formation rates of paraffins on Na decorated Fe and Fe-Zn catalysts decreased continually with increasing temperature. Thus, the ratios of olefins to paraffins on these Na decorated catalysts increased sharply to optimal values with reaction temperature, and then decreased as a further increase in temperature. These results indicated that the decoration of Na into both Fe and Fe-Zn catalyst modified the optimal elementary reaction route for CO2 hydrogenation and especially for the formation of both olefins and paraffins."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, the Fe catalyst decorated by Na promoter and zinc atoms exhibited a good performance for CO2 hydrogenation to synthesize C2 =-C6+ = olefins. Addition of zinc atoms into Fe catalysts facilitated the generation of iron carbide, as an active phase for the formation of olefins, during CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast, decoration of 2 % Na into either monometallic Fe or bimetallic Fe-Zn catalyst promoted their surface basicity and suppressed the reduction and carbonization of Fe cluster, which could modify the stability of iron carbide during catalysis. The surface crystalline graphite carbons on Fe catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation were promoted by either decoration of Na or addition of Zn atoms, resulting the ratio of the disordered carbon and the crystalline graphite carbon (ID/IG) to decrease in an order of Fe > Fe-Zn > Fe-2Na > Fe-Zn-2Na. CO2 hydrogenation over Fe catalysts occurred via the combination of the primary reverse water-gas-shift reaction to form CO and the subsequent CO hydrogenation to produce olefins and paraffins. Addition of Zn into Fe catalysts promoted the rates of both the conversion of CO2 and the formation of carbon containing products, but did not affect the relative rates among primary RWGS reactions, secondary CO hydrogenation to olefins and to paraffins. Decoration of 2 % Na into Fe based catalysts did not modify the rates of reverse water-gas-shift reaction, but varied the formation rate ratios of paraffins and olefins from CO hydrogenation, which result an increase in CO selectivity and a decrease in selectivity of paraffins over Na decorated Fe based catalysts. The formation rates of paraffins depended significantly on the H2 pressure (reaction orders: 1.4∼2.4) but were inhibited by CO2 pressures, their dependencies were not affected either by Na decoration or Zn addition. However, the addition of Na on both Fe catalyst and Fe-Zn catalyst led the formation of olefins to depend more significantly on H2 pressure, thus, Na might modify the identities of catalyst surface and then the relevant steps for the formation of olefins by changing the reducibility of Fe catalysts and/or the identities of surface carbon species. The changes in elementary steps led the temperature dependencies for the formation of olefins, as well as their activation barriers and entropies to undergo variation, resulting the ratios of olefins to paraffins on these Na decorated catalysts to increase sharply to optimal values with reaction temperature and then decreased as a further increase in temperature."
