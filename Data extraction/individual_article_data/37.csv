0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass materials are considered as the most promising and sustainable hydrocarbon reserves to replace fossil resources since a great deal of platform compounds derived from the biomass are renewable for producing fuels and fine-chemicals. 1 , 2 As one of main platform compounds which can be converted to a wide scope of value-added chemicals, furfural and corresponding chemical transformation systems have been paid an increasing attention in both academic research and industrial application. 3 , 4 In the transformation network, because furfuryl alcohol (FOH), the direct hydrogenation product of furfural (FAL), is a desirable feedstock for production of many important or functional chemicals including resins, synthetic fibers, vitamin C, lysine, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, 5–10 the quantitative hydrogenation of FAL to FOH is of great importance for industrial application, and an efficient catalytic system is crucial to implement the chemical transformation, which has intrigued extensive studies on formulating highly selective catalytic system for the reaction. Precious metal samples such as Pt, Ru, Pd were demonstrated to be efficient under the relatively mild conditions for the reaction, 11–14 however, the unaffordable cost of these metals greatly suppressed their potentials in scaled-up applications, in addition, some works also showed that the selectivity to desired product FOH could be not always ensured on these precious metal sites due to the fact that these sites could be equally alive for activating CC on the ring and CO on the chain of FAL. 15–17 In contrast, inexpensive metal catalysts such as Ni, Co, Cu-based samples were also formulated for the reaction, employing the single metal as active component, a high temperature was found to be necessary to accelerate the transformation of FAL, but it was accompanied by the saturation of aromatic ring and the subsequent hydrogenolysis of C–O bond to break ring, also resulting in the low selectivity to FOH. 18–20 To overcome the drawback, many researchers shifted their attentions to multi-metallic catalysts, 20–24 for instance, Wei et al. found that the selectivity to FOH of 70% at 125 °C on Co/NC could be enhanced to 100% by the introduction of Zn to make Co–Zn/NC as catalyst. 20 Although above endeavors have been improving the capability of catalyst systems, some problems could be still ignored upon these metallic structures. As known, the chemical transformations of biomass derivatives analogous to hydrogenation of FAL mostly performed in a liquid reaction mixture in which metal component was spontaneous to leak in solution under the harsh conditions like high temperature and pressure, the leakage could lead to serious problems including the performance-degradation and system-pollution so that confining the application of such catalyst. For example, Cu–Cr alloy has been developed as a commercial catalyst for selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOH, however, the leakage of Cr and consequent harmful influence on environment have driven people to seek new catalysts for industrial application. 5 , 6 , 25 , 26 Trapped by above inherent shortages, the state-of-the-art catalysts remain far away from the application criterion for industrial transformation of the biomass derivatives. To span the limitation, innovation of efficient and applicable replacement catalyst, particularly the non-metallic catalyst, could be an essential approach. In practice, the non-metallic catalysts were seldom investigated in hydrogenation reactions due to the experience that, except for metals, there have been no other materials found to be functional to activate hydrogen. We have attempted to employ metal phosphides as hydrogenation catalysts, unfortunately, none of the phosphide catalysts such as Ni2P and Co2P showed acceptable catalytic efficiency for hydrogenation of phenyl alkynes, α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and levulinic acid in liquid reaction systems, 27 , 28 because phosphide crystalline itself is very poor for activating hydrogen, although such covalent compound is robust to prevent metal leakage in liquid. Surprisingly, when combining Ce with the phosphides, the formed CePO4 was evident to chemically adsorb hydrogen, which contributed to prominent enhancements in both activity and selectivity for these hydrogenation reactions. The observation prompts us to focus on the catalytic feature of rare earth phosphate, to the best of our knowledge, the role and function of the salt-kind of rare earth compounds have been not focused for catalysis applications, particularly for hydrogenation transformation of biomass derivatives. In this work, the relatively heavy rare earth element Nd was formulated in a series of Nd-Co-P composites for hydrogenation of FAL, the catalytic performance and corresponding catalysis origin were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Nd(NO3)3·6H2O (99%, AR) and cyclohexanol (99%, CP) were products of Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; Ethylene glycol (99%, AR), furfuryl alcohol (FOH, 98.5%, AR), KBr (AR), Co(NO3)2·6H2O(98%, AR) and (NH4)2HPO4 (99%, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; Furfural (FAL, 99%, AR) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co., LTD. All chemical regents commercially obtained in chemical analysis purity were used directly without further purification."
3,Preparation of catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of catalysts Nd-Co-P samples with different Nd/Co molar ratios were prepared from a one-pot solvothermal synthesis system. Briefly, Nd(NO3)3 and Co(NO3)2 at different molar ratios were dissolved in deionized water, then the aqueous solution containing (NH4)2HPO4 was added dropwise into above mixture; after the solution was stirred in 800 r/min for 30 min, the solution was transferred into the hydrothermal kettle treatment system to react at 180 °C for 24 h; then the system was naturally cooled down to room temperature, the precipitation from the solvothermal synthesis system was separated by centrifugation, washed and dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the precursor; the obtained precursor was calcined at 800 °C in air for 3 h and successively reduced for 2 h in a 50 mL/min hydrogen flow to acquire catalyst sample. The reduction treatment condition was testified to be adequate to get in-reducible catalyst by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements for hydrogenation applications. 27 , 28 In this work, before carrying characterizations and catalytic measurements, the precursor was treated according to the thermal reduction procedure to get fresh catalyst for investigations. As comparative analysis, single-metal-element contained Nd–P and Co–P samples were also prepared from the same preparation system under similar conditions."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The metal element compositions of samples were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 5100 inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) apparatus. The specific surface area of the samples was measured by performing Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) procedure on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were performed on a Persee XD-3 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka (k = 0.15406 nm) as radiation source. The samples were scanned at a rate of 2(°)/min in the angle (2θ) range of 5°–90°. An Axis Ultra DLD electron-spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was employed to collect X-ray photoelectron spectra of the samples. The measurements were operated at 15 keV and 120 W, and the binding energy was rectified according to the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon at 284.5 eV. Trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) of samples were taken on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope configurated with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analyzer conducted at acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by sonicating in hydrous ethanol and then the suspended sample was dropped and dried on a carbon film coated 400 mesh copper grids. Temperature programmed desorption of H2 and FAL (H2-TPD and FAL-TPD) experiments were carried out on a Micromeritic-Auto-Chem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer combined with a thermal conductivity detector and a computer-controlled furnace. Prior to measurement, approximately 50 mg of fresh catalyst was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube for pretreatment at 400 °C for 60 min in pure argon (30 mL/min) to exclude the possibly adsorbed gas-pollutant on the fresh sample during transferring process. For H2-TPD measurements, the system was cooled to room temperature under the protection of argon and saturated with flowing H2 (30 mL/min) for 60 min, then pure argon was switched into the system again to purge free adsorbate for 30 min; subsequently, the sample was heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and desorption signals were monitored by TCD. For FAL-TPD measurements, the FAL steam at 100 °C balanced by pure argon (30 mL/min) was bubbled into system for 60 min; then the system was blowed by pure argon (30 mL/min) until the system was cooled to 50 °C, the temperature was raised with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and TCD signal was recorded simultaneously. The in-situ Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of the catalysts were also conducted in this work, the details are given in supporting information."
5,Catalytic measurements,"2.4 Catalytic measurements The catalytic measurements for hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) were all performed at 120–150 °C under 1.0–5.0 MPa H2 in a 50 mL Teflon reactor with a stainless-steel autoclave heater equipped with a liquid-sampling device. The reaction mixture compositions were set to be comparable with those reported in literature. 11–24 , 29–34 Typically, the reaction mixture was composed by 2 mmol FAL, 50 mg catalyst and 30 mL solvent. Prior to the reaction, the reaction system was purged 3–5 times with H2 to exclude air and kept stirring at speed of 800 r/min, then reaction condition was carefully manipulated to the desired pressure and temperature, and the composition change of reaction solution with prolonging reaction period was collected on a gas chromatograph (GC 7820A, equipping a flame ionization detector and an Agilent 19091J-413 capillary column (DB-WAX, 30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm)) linked with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC–MS 7890B-5977A, equipping an Agilent 19091S-433 capillary column (HP-5MS, 30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm)). Both FAL and FOH compositions were simultaneously analyzed and calibrated according to the previously measured standard composition curves to determine FAL conversion and FOH yield, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Composition and structure of catalysts,"3.1 Composition and structure of catalysts The metal element compositions of prepared Nd-Co-P samples were measured by ICP-OES measurements, and the Nd/Co molar ratios for five samples were clarified in the range of 0.12–0.55. Firstly, the crystalline structures of catalysts were measured by XRD tests, the patterns of typical samples are given in Fig. 1 (a). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the feature diffractions for Co2P crystalline (PDF cards No. 32–0306) and NdPO4 crystalline (PDF cards No. 25–1065) exhibited on Co–P and Nd–P samples, respectively; with these two samples as references, both Co2P and NdPO4 diffractions were present on Nd-Co-P samples (2-4), moreover, the relative intensity of NdPO4 peaks compared with Co2P was gradually increased with the increase of Nd/Co ratio among Nd-Co-P samples. Besides main feature diffractions of Co2P, CoP diffraction peaks can also be observed on Co–P sample, in view of their relative intensity compared with the intensity of Co2P diffraction peaks, the fraction of CoP component can be estimated at a relatively low level (about 30%), in turn, CoP diffraction peaks were further suppressed to neglectable level among Nd-Co-P samples. In addition, the evident shifts of 2θ degrees for the diffraction peaks were not found among samples, suggesting that the interaction of two metal component is not prominent in view of crystalline feature, therefore, the prepared Nd-Co-P samples could be mainly structured as NdPO4/Co2P composites. XPS measurements were carried out to further identify the elemental distributions on the surface of samples, corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 1(b–d). In comparison to the nearly-flat baseline exhibited on Co–P sample from Nd 3d spectra shown in Fig. 1(b), the main peaks around 1005.3 and 982.7 eV assigned to the 3d5/2 and 3d7/2 photoemissions of Nd(III) species can be observed on Nd–P and Nd-Co-P samples, 35 , 36 and it was not surprising to see that these Nd(III) signals were gradually increased by increasing Nd/Co ratio among Nd-Co-P samples. Fig. 1(c) shows Co 2p spectra of samples that, except for the insignificant signal changes observed on Nd–P sample, Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 photoemissions of Co(δ+) species denoted by the intensive peaks around 793.4 and 778.1 eV, accompanied by relatively weak peaks around 797.0 and 781.2 eV assigned to Co(II) species, were all exhibited on Co contained samples; 37 , 38 meanwhile, P 2p photo emissions of P(δ–) species denoted by the peak around 129.8 eV in Fig. 1(d) are also shown on Co–P and Nd-Co-P samples, the co-existence of Co(δ+) and P(δ–) species observed on Co-contained samples were always attributed to the surface feature of Co2P, 38–40 which further confirmed the existence of Co2P crystalline identified by XRD measurements on these samples. Besides P δ– species, the peaks centered at 133.4 eV assigned to P(V) pertinent to oxidized P species such as PO4 3− were also observed on all samples, 41 , 42 particularly for Nd-Co-P samples, the relative intensity of P(V) peak gradually increased with the increase in Nd/Co ratio among samples, suggesting that Nd(III) species could integrate with PO4 3− to form NdPO4 on these samples, which was also in harmony with the results from XRD measurements. It should be noted that Co(II) species were observed on Co-containing samples although all of these samples were previously reduced before measurements, which could be attributed to the un-controllable surface oxidation of sample during the delivery process. 27 , 28 The morphological features of samples are exhibited by TEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 2 . With EDS-mapping images, it can be found that Co–P sample evolved as random connected stick-like particles with length in μm scale; in contrast, Co component in Nd-Co-P samples all were present as nanoparticles in size of 200–400 nm; as far as Nd component, for both Nd–P and Nd-Co-P samples, the elemental distributions seemed to be the aggregations of nanoparticles below 20 nm. The more detailed structure informations were clarified by high resolution TEM images, as shown in Fig. 2, the similar electronic diffractions with d-space around 0.258 nm were discovered on the particles in size of 200–400 nm for all Nd-Co-P samples, the observation was close to the electronic diffraction d-space on Co–P sample, which could be assigned to the feature diffraction of Co2P [120] crystalline (PDF cards No. 32–0306), 43 , 44 indicating that the big particles (beyond 200 nm) observed from Co–P and Nd-Co-P samples were mainly composed by Co2P; in contrast, on the aggregations of small nanoparticles (below 20 nm) around Co2P particles for Nd-Co-P samples, the electronic diffraction d-space values approach 0.350 nm were all resolved, which was similar to the feature electronic diffraction of NdPO4 [111] crystalline (PDF cards No. 25–1065) shown on Nd–P sample. These images testified that the prepared Nd-Co-P samples were present as nanocomposite particles consisting of Co2P particle with size above 200 nm surrounded by NdPO4 particles around 20 nm, indicating that the high-temperature treatment from preparation facilitated the adequate growth of crystalline for both components, as disclosed by previous XRD measurements; in addition, such big size could also make a confinement in fully merging crystalline of two components or creating efficient metal–metal interaction, 2 , 12–14 , 16 which could be another factor responsible for the un-resolvable hints of component-interaction among our samples. With above characterizations, it can be figured out that, Nd-Co-P samples prepared in this work were mainly present as nanocomposites consisting of Co2P particle surrounded by NdPO4 aggregations, according to the Nd:Co ratio of 0.12–0.55 from ICP-OES analyses, the prepared Nd-Co-P nanocomposites can be readily denoted as (NdPO4) m /Co2P, with molar ratio m of two components in the range of 0.24–1.1."
8,Catalytic performances of samples,"3.2 Catalytic performances of samples 3.2.1 The setting of reaction condition For liquid hydrogenation reaction of organic reactant substrate, the reaction conditions such as solvent, temperature, pressure and relative composition of catalyst to FAL could play notable roles in reaction process. 45 , 46 Firstly, the solvent influence was investigated by employing (NdPO4)0.46/Co2P as example catalyst for hydrogenation of furfural (FAL), the comparative results are given in Fig. S1 (see in supporting information). Except for water and dichloroethane, distinct transformations of FAL to FOH were observed when employing alcohols, toluene and hexane as solvents, and the highest yield of FOH was gained in ethylene glycol, so in the following catalytic measurements, ethylene glycol was used as solvent to investigate and compare catalytic performance of catalysts. Subsequently, influences of reaction temperature, H2 pressure and reaction mixture composition were also testified by employing (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P as representative catalyst, which can be found in Fig. S2 (see in supporting information). By modulating these conditions, the moderate catalytic performance (FAL conversion above 90% but not to reach 100%) during 240 min of reaction period can be obtained at 140 °C under 4.0 MPa H2 when using 50 mg catalyst in 30 mL ethylene glycol containing 2.0 mmol FAL, the reaction condition was also comparable with that reported in literature, 11–24 , 29–34 so these parameters were set as typical condition to compare catalytic performance of different catalysts in this work. 3.2.2 Catalytic efficiency and reusability of samples Fig. 3 shows the variations of FAL conversion and FOH yield with reaction time over Co2P (NdPO4) m /Co2P and NdPO4 catalysts. During reaction time of 240 min, NdPO4 showed insignificant yield of FOH; over Co2P, a slow change in FAL conversion up to about 29% was accompanied by a poor ending FOH yieldof 22% in the set reaction period; in comparison to two reference samples, the dramatic enhancements in both FAL conversion and FOH yield such as final FOH yield above 65% were observed among (NdPO4) m /Co2P catalysts, and the highest FOH yield of 97.6% was obtained by modulating m at 0.80. These results clearly indicated that combination of NdPO4 on Co2P to form and manipulate composite structure was a sound way to elevate catalytic efficiency for hydrogenation of FAL to FOH. A referee reminded us that the influence of CoP composition among samples on their catalytic performance should be considered although Co components were mainly present as Co2P in all Co-contained samples. In fact, it is difficult to deliberately or controllably prepare samples with the diverse Co x P crystalline compositions in current preparation system, meanwhile, it was found that a mixture of crystalline with metal component in different valance states could be a benefitcial factor to improve catalytic performance particularly for redox reactions such as hydrogenation of biomass derivates, since the potential between different valance states could greatly speed the electron transferring process. 7 , 11 , 37 Thus, we are prone to believe that the existence of CoP at least can not be diagnosed as a negative factor to suppress the catalytic performance of Co-contained catalysts in this work. In addition, CoP compositions among samples are generally in the relatively low level in comparison to the distinct change in Nd composition, therefore, the contrast catalytic performance differences among samples could be mainly attributed to the combination of Nd rather than the change of CoP composition. Considering that the catalytic recycle results from both high-conversion stage and low-conversion stage (<50%) are necessary for evaluating the efficiency and reusability of catalyst, besides 50 mg (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P catalyst (as same as the amount in previous catalytic measurements), we also deliberately employed the catalyst in the reduced amount of 15 mg according to the comment of a reviewer to endure the recycle test, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). It can be observed that both FAL conversion and FOH yield were kept in almost constant level during five successive catalytic cycles when employing catalyst in different amounts; among these cycles, the monitored Co leakage in reaction solution by ICP-OES was found to be not more than 1.0%, simultaneously, the leakage of Nd was consistently present at un-detectable level during the recycle process. In addition, in filtration comparison shown in Fig. 4(b), it is exhibited that the reaction would be suspended once catalyst was removed out of the reaction solution, these results further disclosed that the prepared (NdPO4) m /Co2P catalyst was efficient and robust for selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOH. 3.2.3 Kinetic and mechanism investigations on typical samples It is known that chemical activation of hydrogen by catalyst is a primary step involved in hydrogenation reactions, which is usually characterized by H2 chemical adsorption–desorption measurements. Among the measurements, H2-TPD characterization is the mostly employed method to illustrate the feature of catalyst used in thermal catalytic hydrogenation reactions. 11–24 , 29–34 Thus we also collected H2-TPD profiles on our typical catalysts in Fig. 5 . In comparison to nearly-flat baseline observed on Co2P, the distinct H-desorption peaks below 100 °C raised on (NdPO4) m /Co2P and NdPO4 catalysts. In view of the intensity and the temperature range for these H-desorption peaks, the observed H-adsorption–desorption feature of NdPO4 contained samples was close to that of metal surface. 11–24 , 29–34 These results clearly indicated that isolated Co2P component was poor to activate H2, in contrast, NdPO4 was exclusively alive for activating H2, and this could be the reason for the observed catalytic enhancement on (NdPO4) m /Co2P compared to Co2P. Notably, the area of H-desorption peak from H2-TPD profile is always employed to calculate the number of active sites for hydrogenation reactions by using a known Pt-based catalyst as calibrating reference, 29–34 so the essence of the method is to calibrate out the active site comparable with Pt site for the given catalyst no matter what component is contained in the catalyst, then the turnover frequency (TOF) values can be calculated by normalizing initial reaction rate (the rate with reactant conversion not more than 10%) to the number of active site. Following the method, we calculated the active site numbers and corresponding TOF values on catalysts. For Co2P, in view of the absence of H-desorption signal on the sample, enlightened by the CO-IR chemisorption method developed for metal phosphides from Oyama group, 47 , 48 we also attempted to resolve the active site number on Co2P sample by employing CO chemisorption measurements (not shown). Unfortunately, the insignificant information was obtained, thus the active site number for the sample had to be estimated from its mass-specific area. Above data taken together with other surface parameters of typical catalysts are listed in Table 1 . Interestingly, the active site numbers estimated from H2-TPD measurements among (NdPO4) m /Co2P catalysts were increased in nearly proportional change with the increased Nd:Co surface ratio; moreover (NdPO4)0.46-0.80/Co2P showed over ten-fold higher TOF or intrinsic activity (0.42–0.50 s−1) than Co2P (0.04 s−1), indicating that the active site number is dependent on the surface composition of NdPO4, and that in turn directly leads to the activity enhancement for the hydrogenation reaction. In addition, it should be noted that the considerable amount of by-products such as cyclo-pentanone (CPO) and acteal were formed on isolated Co2P surface, in turn giving a low selectivity of 76% to FOH, which could be attributed to the fact that Co2P is poor for activating hydrogen, so the yield of hydrogenation product is greatly suppressed. In contrast, by combination of NdPO4 on Co2P, the selectivity was increased from 90% on (NdPO4)0.46/Co2P to over 97% on (NdPO4) m /Co2P catalysts with m ≥ 0.80. These results disclosed that, by combination of NdPO4, the formulated (NdPO4) m /Co2P composite was beneficial not only to enhancing the activity but also to improving catalytic selectivity for hydrogenation of FAL to FOH in virtue of the unique hydrogen activation function of NdPO4, in other words, the catalytic efficiency for the reaction could be dramatically enhanced on the prepared Nd-Co-P composites depending on the exclusive capability of NdPO4 to activate hydrogen. Linking all of parameters in Table 1, some additional issues need to be further clarified. As shown in Table 1, the surface area (mass-specific area) among (NdPO4) m /Co2P samples is gradually increased in comparison to that of Co2P sample, one may be attributed to the enhanced catalytic performance on (NdPO4) m /Co2P. Indeed, the increased surface area (mass-specific area) or particle dispersion means that more active sites will be exposed and accessible to reactant in a certain amount of catalyst, which in turn will lead to a proportional increase in reactant conversion. In our case, firstly, the experimental results are in conflict with the expectation, for instance (NdPO4)1.1/Co2P was not the best sample in view of FAL conversion despite the fact that the sample had the largest specific area among samples; secondly, with previous TEM measurements, it can be found that Co components in all of samples are present as particles with size above 200 nm, whereas NdPO4 is present as aggregations in size around 20 nm. In view of such big size-gap between two components, it was reasonable to attribute the increase in specific area to the combination of much smaller NdPO4 aggregations rather than the size change of Co component itself. Additionally, the influence of particle with size above 100 nm on catalyst dispersion is always neglectable in catalysis since the dispersion of such particles is below 0.01. Thus, the performance gap among present catalysts should be attributed to the combination of NdPO4 rather than the insignificant dispersion change of Co2P component. It is also notable from the data in Table 1 that the isolated NdPO4 was poor for the hydrogenation reaction although NdPO4 was testified to be functional for activating H2, and that increasing NdPO4 composition among (NdPO4) m /Co2P samples to a higher level (m > 0.80) would suppress TOF value such as low value of 0.11 s−1 on (NdPO4)1.1/Co2P. To illustrate the reason for these observations, we performed further studies on kinetic and mechanism. Fig. 6 shows the kinetic measurements on Co2P and (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P by altering reaction temperature. As shown in Fig. 6(a, b), it can be found that the linear correlations of lnc t (c t : FAL concentration at different reaction time t) were all shown on two samples, indicating that catalytic transformation of FAL on two samples would all follow a pseudo first-order kinetic process; with the slops from the kinetic linear curves on every temperature, the values of reaction rate constant (k) were determined, then Arrhenius (linear) plots over two samples were plotted by fitting lnk to the reciprocal of reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 6(c, d); according to the plots, the apparent reaction activation energy (E a) values were measured to be 36.9 and 24.0 kJ/mol on Co2P and (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P, respectively. Such kinetic analysis results disclosed that (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P had much lower E a than Co2P, implying that, with the unique ability of NdPO4 to activate hydrogen, the energy threshold for the reaction would be greatly suppressed on (NdPO4) m /Co2P, leading to the dramatic activity enhancement present on (NdPO4) m /Co2P in comparison to isolated Co2P. Prompted by the insight, the kinetic influence of H2 was further investigated on (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P, Fig. 7 (a) shows the variations of FAL concertation with reaction time at different H2 pressures (p(H2)), then lgr 0 (r 0: initial reaction rate with FAL conversion around 10%) was correlated with lgp(H2) to draw a linear-relationship plot in Fig. 7(b), where the reaction order (n) for H2 was estimated as 0.52. Linking all of the results from above kinetic measurements, the experimental reaction rate equation for hydrogenation of FAL on (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P can be expressed as r = k·[FAL]·[H2] 0.52. By the equation, it can be recognized that the reaction behaviors of hydrogenation of FAL on (NdPO4) m /Co2P could be conjunctively governed by the interaction from both of reactants, H2 and FAL. Since activation of H2 on NdPO4 component has been clarified by previous H2-TPD measurements, the issue was focused on the interaction between FAL and catalyst surface. To address the topic, FAL-TPD and in-situ FT-IR measurements on Co2P (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P and NdPO4 were performed and corresponding profiles are given in Fig. S3 (see in supporting information). In comparison to the neglectable signal change on NdPO4, an obvious and broad desorption peak raising from 50 to 700 °C was observed on (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P from FAL-TPD profiles (Fig.S3A), which was similar to the peak present on Co2P, the result suggested that Co2P was decisive for activating FAL during the reaction, and that a cooperative activation function of two components involved in (NdPO4) m /Co2P composites for two reactants (FAL and H2) could be another factor to facilitate the hydrogenation of FAL to FOH. In the following in-situ FT-IR measurements (FIgs. S3(b–d)), besides the role of Co2P to activate FAL, the formation of FOH from hydrogenation of FAL on (NdPO4)0.80/Co2P was further clarified (details shown in supporting information). Based on above TPD, kinetics and in-situ FT-IR investigations, a Langmuir–Hinshelwood process that consists of the following elemental reaction steps was speculated for hydrogenation of FAL on (NdPO4) m /Co2P composite catalyst, where S1 presents active site of NdPO4 component to activate H2 and S2 denotes Co2P site to activate FAL. (1) H2 + 2S1 ⇔ 2H–S1 (2) FAL + S2 ⇔ FAL-S2 (3) H–S1 + FAL-S2 ⇒ HFAL-S2 + S1 (4) HFAL-S2 + H–S1 ⇔ FOH–S2 + S1 (5) FOH–S2 ⇔ FOH + S2 By assuming the elemental reaction (3) as the rate-determining step, 49 the general reaction rate equation would be expressed as Eq. (6), in which k 3 is the rate constant of step (3). (6) r = k 3·[FAL-S2]·[H–S1] In contrast to step (3), other steps would quickly reach equilibrium state, so [H–S1] and [FAL-S2] could be directly expressed as following equations: [H–S1] = K 1 0.5·[H2]0.5·[S1] (K 1: the equilibrium constant of step (1)); [FAL-S2] = K 2·[FAL]·[S2] (K 2: the equilibrium constant of step (2)). Then the general rate equation can be transformed to Eq. (7), in which, k = k 3 K 1 0.5·K 2·[S1]·[S2]. (7) r = k·[FAL]·[H2]0.5 The deduced rate equation was close to that obtained from experimental measurements, so the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism could be a reasonable pathway for hydrogenation of FAL to FOH on (NdPO4) m /Co2P composite structure, in which, H2 and FAL were respectively adsorbed-activated on NdPO4 and Co2P to facilitate the transformation through the surface reaction as the rate-determining step. Also, the mechanism study further confirmed that the unique contribution of NdPO4 to activate H2 was a crucial compensation factor to overcome the defect of Co2P, which in turn directly facilitate the hydrogenation transformation of FAL to FOH over (NdPO4) m /Co2P composites through the rapid Langmuir–Hinshelwood process. In addition, it must admit that activating FAL on Co2P was also a necessary step in whole reaction process, which means that the presence of Co2P and consequent surface distribution of NdPO4 to Co2P were another important factors to govern reaction behavior and catalytic performance, in this view, the poor performance observed on NdPO4 and the diverse catalytic parameters obtained from (NdPO4) m /Co2P samples by altering molar ratio of two components could be attributed to the factors. To this point, the proper molar ratio between two components (m) was demonstrated to be around 0.80. As mentioned above, it should be noted that pure Co2P possessed considerable activity particularly in comparison to singular NdPO4. The poor activity of NdPO4 could be attributed to its disability to activate FAL; in contrast, Co2P is very efficient for activating FAL although it is poor to activate hydrogen. To the point, the surface properties of Co2P could be a notable clue. It was found that a considerable fraction of surface was occupied by Co(II) species among all of Co-contained samples (XPS), which is in line with the popular observation on Co x P samples, 38–40 implying that isolated Co species out of Co x P could exist in these samples. In a reductive environment such as the reduction treatment or the hydrogenation reaction system employed in this work, these Co species could transform to Co(0) state, in turn, such Co sites can easily ignite the activation of H2 even in a low surface coverage and run the process of hydrogenation reaction, the evident activity of singular Co2P compared to NdPO4 could be attributed to the existence and function of these Co sites. To inspect the speculation, we deliberately employed an acid-boiling washing treatment on fresh Co2P and (NdPO4)0.8/Co2P catalysts, then put them for hydrogenation of FAL, respectively. Interestingly, Co leakage fractions from Co2P and (NdPO4)0.8/Co2P are 1.6% and 4.3%, respectively, but the consequent performance losses Co2P and (NdPO4)0.8/Co2P are 30% and not more than 10%. The higher performance loss with a lower Co leakage observed on Co2P suggested that the isolated or separable Co species on the surface of Co2P crystalline could play an important role in governing the catalytic performance for hydrogenation reaction, in spite of the fact that they exist in a small surface fraction (not sufficient to arise detectable H2 chemisorption-desorption signal). The efficiency of combination Nd to formulate (NdPO4) m /Co2P composite catalyst for hydrogenation FAL to FOH could be further illustrated by the comparison with the performance of reported catalysts in literature, as shown in Table S1 (seen in supporting information). In general, the performance of isolated Co2P sample was in the low rank of state-of-the-art catalysts, however, by composing NdPO4, the catalytic performance in view of TOF and selectivity over the formulated (NdPO4) m /Co2P composites was better than those on popular transition metal catalysts, 22 , 24 , 30–33 and even comparable with the performance of some precious metal catalysts. 11 , 12 , 29 The distinct comparison results further verified that NdPO4 made an outstanding contribution for acquiring superior catalytic efficiency for hydrogenation of FAL to FOH over (NdPO4) m /Co2P composites."
9,Conclusions,"The easily-prepared Nd-Co-P samples structured as (NdPO4) m /Co2P nanocomposites were examined to be efficient and reusable catalysts for selective hydrogenation of furfural (FAL), in terms of superior intrinsic activity and quantitative yield of furfuryl alcohol (FOH) which are comparable with the performance of precious metal catalysts. In comparison to isolated Co2P, NdPO4 is evidently alive for activating hydrogen, which serves as the decisive factor responsible for the dramatic enhancement in activity and the ideal selectivity to FOH achieved on (NdPO4) m /Co2P. These findings confirm that the robust rare earth phosphates possessed unique capability to activate hydrogen, and the capability can gift the rare earth salt potential to act as a novel catalytic component out of the scope of the state-of-the-art (metallic) catalysts for hydrogenation reactions in particular hydrogenation transformation of biomass derivatives like FAL; meanwhile, the discovery can also open a new window towards the design and application of the non-metallic material for other green mass transformation techniques involving hydrogen in view of the distinct interaction between hydrogen and the robust cost-affordable material."
