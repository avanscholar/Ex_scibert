0,Introduction,"Environmental pollution with respect to the rapid fossil fuel consumption has played a major role in the increasing global warming and other potential threats to the society. In recent years, biofuels can be put forth to reduce the carbon emission. Among them, hydrogen seems a promising fuel due to its high energy content and clean nature with no CO2 emission during the combustion process. Additionally, hydrogen can be also directly used in fuel cells to generate electricity (Kumar et al., 2016a; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016a). During recent times, galactose a major component in marine algae, dairy industry wastewaters has been investigated for biohydrogen production (Kumar et al., 2014b; Park et al., 2015). However, the hydrogen production rate and yield were relatively lower than other simpler sugars such as glucose, sucrose and xylose, the variations is attributed by the complex metabolic utilization pathway of galactose to hydrogen fermentation. For biohydrogen production, galactose must first be converted to glucose-1-phosphate via the Leloir pathway (which requires chemical energy input) and subsequently be metabolized to produce various soluble metabolic products (SMPs) and hydrogen (Park et al., 2014). Additionally, galactose has been studied in batch (Kumar et al., 2014a; Park et al., 2011) and continuous process via CSTR (Kumar et al., 2014b; Park et al., 2015). However, few studies have been reported for hydrogen production from galactose via UASBR operation. Upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactors (UASBR) have been widely used in the anaerobic treatment of industrial wastewaters for efficient organic removal and simultaneous methane generation over the past decades (Auphimai et al., 2014; Espana-Gamboa et al., 2012). In recent years, continuous hydrogen production via UASBR system has also gained interest, as it possesses the stable and efficient hydrogen production performances than other bioreactors such as continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), fixed bed reactor (FBR), immobilized reactors (ICR), etc (Barca et al., 2015; Bakonyi et al., 2014a; Jung et al., 2011a). Another advantage of using UASBR for hydrogen production is the formation of stable hydrogen producing granules (HPGs), which are generally having high settling properties and efficient biomass retention under shorter hydraulic retention time (HRT) with high organic loading rate (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016c; Kumar et al., 2016; Si et al., 2015; Seghezzo et al., 1998). However the main limitation of using UASBR for hydrogen production is the long start-up period time required for the formation and stabilization of the HPGs, usually takes several months (Chang and Lin, 2004; Dong et al., 2011). In recent years various successful strategies were adopted to reduce the time required for the formation HPGs, such as inducing the rapid granulation formation by intermittent pH change (Zhang et al., 2007), self-granulation (Jung et al., 2013) and use of pretreated granules as a support matrix (Hu and Chen, 2007). From earlier studies, it is quite evident that proper start-up strategy is required for improving the operational stability and granule formation during the continuous hydrogen production. Additionally, the heat treatment method on suppressing the undesired hydrogen producing microbial populations such as methanogens and lactate producing bacteria, showed notable increment in the hydrogen producing performances of the mixed culture system (Bakonyi et al., 2014b; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016d). Earlier reports indicated that the even after the applied initial heat treatment, the methanogens (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2014) and lactic acid bacteria (Kim et al., 2008) were not completely suppressed and their observance in the bioreactor system greatly affected the low hydrogen yield. And some strategies were cope up with an immediate effect to suppress the undesired hydrogen producing populations are as follows, lowering the HRT, changes in the early switch over time from batch to continuous mode operation (Kim et al., 2008), addition of chemicals (Shanmugam et al., 2014; Sivagurunathan et al., 2016a). Besides, the application of repeated heat treatment method has been proven as a reliable method for suppressing the unwanted microbes in continuous operation and further reduces the time needed to achieve the stable hydrogen production during the process disturbances conditions (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b; Wu et al., 2003; Duangmanee et al., 2007). Therefore, this study was aimed to enhance the hydrogen production performances from galactose via UASBR by assessing the role of repeated heat treatment on stable hydrogen production performances."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock and seed inoculum,"2.1 Feedstock and seed inoculum The monosaccharide sugar, galactose (Daejung, Korea) was used as the sole carbon source for the hydrogen production. The seed sludge (anaerobic mixed cultures) was collected from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The characteristics of the sludge were TCOD: 22.6g COD/L, VSS: 12.6g/L and pH: 6.8. Heat treatment (90°C for 30min in a water bath) was applied as a pretreatment method to cultivate/enrich spore forming hydrogen producers and also to prohibit the activity of hydrogen consumers (methanogens)."
3,Preparation of the hybrid immobilized cells,"2.2 Preparation of the hybrid immobilized cells The hybrid immobilized cells were prepared by mixing powdered sludge with the sodium alginate (2% w/v), chitosan (1% w/v) and activated carbon (2% w/v) mixture and extruded into a calcium chloride solution (2% w/v) solution. Slight modifications were done from the detailed procedure for the immobilization explained in our previous research (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014a). The formed immobilized beads were washed with sterile distilled water to remove the excess CaCl2 and then dried using thick tissue papers. The prepared beads were stored in the refrigerator until being used in the experiments."
4,Continuous reactor set-up and operation,"2.3 Continuous reactor set-up and operation A total volume of 3.2L UASBR bioreactor with an effective working volume of 2.5L was used and the schematic experimental set up was shown in Fig. 1 . The start-up of the reactor was followed as reported elsewhere (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b). The reactor was maintained at a constant temperature of 37°C without pH control. A basal endo medium (Endo et al., 1982) was used with the following ingredients (g/L): 5.24, NH4HCO3; 6.72, NaHCO3; 0.125, K2HPO4; 0.1, MgCl2·6H2O; 0.015, MnSO4·6H2O; 0.025, FeSO4·7H2O; 0.005, CuSO4·5H2O; 0.00012, CoCl2·5H2O. HRT was maintained as 6h. Initially, kept in batch mode for 2days and then shifted to the continuous mode from day 3 onwards. The anaerobic condition was provided by N2 purging for 10min during the initial reactor start-up. The volume of the biogas produced was measured by wet gas meter and adjusted with standard temperature and pressure."
5,Analytical procedure,"2.4 Analytical procedure Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (SRI 310, SRI Instrument) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with mole sieve 5A (SRI Instrument) and 0.9m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, SRI Instrument) with 99.99% nitrogen as carrier gas as reported in our earlier study (Kumar et al., 2014b). The fermentation samples were collected on daily basis and stored in the refrigerator at 4°C prior to analysis of parameters. For the volatile fatty acids (VFA), alcohols and sugars analysis, procedures were described before (Kumar et al., 2014b)."
6,Microbial community analysis,"2.5 Microbial community analysis Total genomic DNA collected at various HRT samples were extracted by using the Mobio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (Solana Beach, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were PCR-amplified using a primer set, 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 518R (5′-ATTTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) (Goodfellow and Stackebrandt, 1991). 454 Pyrosequencing of the PCR amplicons was conducted by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (454 Life Science, Branford, USA). The analysis of the sequencing results were followed as described in our earlier study (Park et al., 2015). The q-PCR analysis was followed as reported elsewhere (Sivagurunathan et al., 2017)."
7,Results and discussions,
8,Hydrogen production performances during initial start-up period,"3.1 Hydrogen production performances during initial start-up period The start-up of bioreactor is a crucial step in continuous hydrogen production system, where it allows the growth of the functional consortium adapted to the applied environmental conditions and consequently reached the steady-state (the variations in H2 gas production usually with less than 10% standard deviation) conditions for the efficient and stable hydrogen production performances (Bakonyi et al., 2014c). Besides, proper switch over time (hydrogen producing reaches exponential phase) is required for the long-term and stable operation by allowing the stable hydrogen producing biomass to grow, whereas the improper switch over time leads to the unstable hydrogen production performances by the activity growth of non-hydrogen producers such as lactic acid bacteria or propionic acid bacteria (Kim et al., 2008). Another significant factor influence the start-up period is the type of the reactor, Usually CSTR, possess the short start-up time due to the better mass transfer and mixing ability, however the cell biomass wash out occurs at low HRT usually less than (8h). On the other hand, the UASBR possess the superior in handling the biomass retention at low HRT and high organic loading rate (OLR) at HRT less than 3h. However, the long start-up period phase is the major limitation of this process, where the granule formation requires long time and it also depends on the activity of the flocculating hydrogen producing microbial community (Chang and Lin, 2004). The addition of pretreated methanogenic granules (Hu and Chen, 2007) or developed granules from CSTR could be notably shortened the start-up time of the UASBR to achieve the stable and efficient hydrogen production (Jung et al., 2011b). In this study, the UASBR was started-up in a batch mode operation for 24h to enhance the microbial biomass, followed by continuous operation with HRT of 6h. The hydrogen production performance of the UASBR operation during 40days was shown in Fig. 2 . During the initial start-up period (10days) the hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield (HY) remained in the range of 4.5L/L/d and 0.5mol/mol galactose, with a sugar utilization of 66%. After the initial start-up period, the hydrogen production gradually increased up to 9.1L/L/d and 1.07mol H2/mol galactose (Table 1 ). Generally, acetate (HAc) and the butyrate (HBu) are the essential volatile fatty acids to produce the hydrogen, theoretically acetate can produce 4mol of hydrogen per glucose and the butyrate can produce 2mol of hydrogen per glucose. These two acids play a major role in the biohydrogen production. During the start-up period (Fig. 3 ), initial start-up period (1–10days) propionate and lactate were observed as 1544mg/L and 240mg/L, with low amount of acetate and butyrate concentrations of 700mg/L and 3836mg/L, respectively, probably due to the presence of lactic acid or propionate forming bacteria. However, after the initial start-up period (25–32day), the propionate and lactate concentrations surged to 904mg/L and 328mg/L and the increased concentration of acetate (1136mg/L) and butyrate (4126mg/L), which favors the improvement in the hydrogen production performances."
9,Repeated heat-treatment: hydrogen production performances of UASBR,"3.2 Repeated heat-treatment: hydrogen production performances of UASBR In generally, hydrogen production by mixed cultures is accomplished with the diverse group of the bacterial populations, such as propionic acid bacteria (PAB) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). As indicated earlier (Kim et al., 2008), PAB and LAB were not completely suppressed by heat-treatment method, besides the early changes in the switch-over time from batch to continuous might helpful in the elimination of these (PAB and LAB) population from the biohydrogen reactor (Kim et al., 2008). Another useful, strategy in the elimination of these non-hydrogen populations is the application of intermittent temperature shift, as indicated by Sivagurunathan et al. (2014b) temperature shift, successfully eliminates the HPr forming bacteria in a continuous system and resulted in the enhancement of the hydrogen production over. In the present study, the repeated heat treatment (80°C for 30min) was applied on 33rd day of the UASBR operation. After the repeated heat treatment, the continuous operation was stopped for one cycle (6h), there forward continuous operation was progressed at 37°C. The results showed that after the repeated heat treatment, the hydrogen production performances (HPR and HY) was significantly improved by 37%, with the stable value of 12.5L/L/d and 1.5mol/mol galactose, respectively. The volatile fatty acids results showed that temperature disturbance resulted in enhancement of the HAc and HBu production concentration up to 1469mg/L and 4915mg/L, with less amount of HPr (394mg/L) and HLa (111mg/L) and also an increment in the substrate utilization >98%."
10,Changes in microbial community structure before and after repeated heat treatment,"3.3 Changes in microbial community structure before and after repeated heat treatment The microbial community dynamics of the effluent samples obtained from the UASBR before and after repeated heat treatment was monitored by 454-pyrosequencing analysis. As it seen from the pyrosequencing Fig. 4 , the bacterial population was greatly influenced with the changes in the temperature. The species richness and the diversity indices are mentioned in Table 2 . The number of reads and operational taxonomic units (OTU) indicated that the microbial dynamics were enriched after the applied intermittent pretreatment with the reads of 3782 (before-repeated heat treatment) and 4455 (after-repeated heat treatment), and their corresponding OTUs were 21 and 27, respectively. The Shannon and Simpson also exhibited the species richness was significantly affected by the intermittent temperature changes in the reactor. The microbial diversity in the UASB obtained before the repeated heat treatment had a superior Simpson’s diversity index (0.33) and diminished Shannon’s index (1.23), indicating that after the repeated heat treatment new steady state performances has been achieved as a result of the increased microbial diversity with a higher Simpson’s diversity index (0.43) and an increased Shannon’s index (1.64). Similar species richness was observed with galactose substrate in continuous operation (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016c; Kumar et al., 2016b). Fig. 4 depicts the distribution pattern of the microbial diversity based on phylum (a) and class (b) level. The microbial diversity consists of mostly bacterial species and without the presence of archaea populations, indicated the effectiveness of the inoculum conditioning during the initial phase of the experiment. The microbial diversity varied remarkably during the post transition phase of the repeated heat treatment (80°C for 30min) on day 33. During the initial steady state phase of the experiment, the microbial dynamics at phylum level mostly consist of Proteobacteria with abundance over 61.3%, followed by Bacteroidetes 24%, and Firmicutes 14.5%. After the repeated heat treatment the bacterial diversity abundance were remarkably changed with Firmicutes being the dominant bacterial population with abundance over 88%, with a significant drop in the Proteobacteria (10.81%) and Bacteroidetes (0.13%) dominance. The Actinobacteria populations were remarkably stable during the entire operation with a negligible percentage of less than 0.3%. The significant improvement in the Firmicutes populations after the repeated heat treatment is the resultant of the selective enrichment of the spore forming populations mainly Bacilli and Clostridium groups. Since, the Firmicutes populations are considered as an important member of the active hydrogen producing bacteria (Park et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2016b; Sivagurunathan et al., 2017), their increased abundance is coincided with the improved hydrogen production performances over 25%. At the class level distribution (Fig.4b), the key bacterial populations were Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, and the least abundance was Negativicutes. During the initial steady state period, before repeated heat treatment conditions, the Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia populations consists more than 85% of the entire class, with an individual percentages of 61.3% and 24%, respectively. However, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia populations were remarkably suppressed with the applied repeated heat treatment with a least abundance 10.8% of Gammaproteobacteria and almost complete elimination of Bacteroidia class. The class of Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia mainly consisted of non-spore forming vegetative cells of Enterobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae family, thus during the repeated heat treatment over 80 οC for a period of 30min on day 33, these populations dominance were reduced significantly. Whereas, the abundance of Clostridia and Bacilli were greatly increased from 3.6% to 59% and 10.8% to 29.8%, after the intermittent heat treatment strategy supported the successful enrichment of the active hydrogen producing bacterial populations and the suppression of the non-hydrogen producing organisms, mainly Prevotellaceae. The key metabolic end products formation during glucose metabolism of Preovtella Sp. was lactate, acetae, formate and succinate with no hydrogen producing ability (Takahashi and Yamada, 2000). Moreover, these species act as a competitor for the active hydrogen producing bacterial populations and thereby reducing the hydrogen yield and production rate. Hence, the suppression of these populations group is necessary for improving the hydrogen production and substrate utilization ability. A similar phenomenon was reported in previous studies (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b; Wu et al., 2003; Duangmanee et al., 2007), (Table 3 ), after the intermittent applied pretreatment, the elimination of non-hydrogen producing bacterial populations and the enrichment of Clostridium populations usually occurs with an improvement in hydrogen production performances. In the present report, the intermittent heat treatment showed remarkable influence on the microbial diversity, with an increment in OTUs from 21 to 27 and HPR from 9.1L/L/d to 12.5L/L/d. The genus level microbial populations before and after the repeated heat treatment were as follows, Klebsiella (60.5%), Prevotella (24%) and Lactobacillus (9.8%) being the dominant bacteria, while the low level of Clostridium (3.6%) and Citrobacter (0.8%) was observed during the initial steady-state conditions. These microbial population’s dominance coincided with the increased production of lactate and propionate (Table 1) with reduced hydrogen production than the post-treated condition, as the later; provide reduced formation of lactate and propionate with concomitant increment of acetate and butyrate formation and resulted in elevated hydrogen production (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b). The repeated heat treatment remarkably reduced the proportion of Klebsiella, Prevotella and Lactobacillus lower than 1.1% of the entire microbial community, with a significant enhancement of Clostridium (59%), Eneterococcus (23.1%), and Citrobacter (9.1%) populations, respectively. However, in this study some non-spore forming bacteria such as Enterococcus and Citrobacter genus, were not suppressed completely and they regain their growth when their favorable reactor temperature of 37°C appeared during further continuous operation. Similar conditions were observed in a recent study (Sivagurunathan et al., 2016b), where the Enterococcus and Citrobacter populations were enriched along with the Clostridium species during continuous operation in a CSTR. In order to further strengthen the quality of the microbial community analysis and supporting the repeated heat treatment activity, the quantitative microbial analysis of the bacterial populations was done by using the q-PCR technique and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . The Clostridum butyricum was not significantly affected and being the dominant populations in all tested conditions with a value of 6.66×108 and 6.87×101 copies/ng DNA, besides the other population dynamics was affected with the repeated heat treatment method. During the initial conditions, the Lactobacillus Sp. was rose to a value of 38%, further surged to 12.2%, similar behavior of Enterobacter Sp. cells was also observed with a rise (25%) and drop (12%) after the heat treatment. The Enterococcus Sp. showed the least abundance of 7% and 1%, respectively. These corroborations demonstrated that Clostridium species was the major hydrogen producers during the entire operational period of the UASB reactor."
11,Conclusions,"This research demonstrated that repeated heat treatment was found to be an efficient strategy for reliable hydrogen production in UASBR. The repeated heat treatment improved hydrogen production performance by 37% and remarkably reduced the proportion of Klebsiella, Prevotella and Lactobacillus lower than 1.1% of the entire microbial community, with a significant enhancement of Clostridium (59%), Eneterococcus (23.1%), and Citrobacter (9.1%) populations, respectively. This research provides new possibilities for the suppression of non-hydrogen producers and enhancement of hydrogen production in continuous operation."
