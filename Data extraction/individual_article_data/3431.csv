0,Introduction,"The partial reduction of alkynes to alkenes is an indispensable process for the synthesis of numerous commercial compounds including polymers, vitamins, flavourings and fragrances. The petrochemical and bulk chemical industries have employed kiloton-scale continuous processing to enact these transformations for over a century, as the efficient heat and mass transfer inside continuous gas-liquid-solid apparatus lead to high overal process eficiencies in comparison with batch [1]. However, continuous processing methodologies have only been adopted by fine chemical companies in the past two decades [2] and there exist still many areas for improvement. Herein we present the selective continuous catalytic hydrogenation of the alkynes 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (abbr. MBY) and 2-butyne-1,4-diol (abbr. BYD) over catalytic static mixers (abbr. CSMs), a structured, immobilised catalyst system designed by CSIRO to afford greater control over the chemical process than classical fixed bed technologies [3–8]. These hydrogenations were optimised for alkene and space-time yields over CSMs coated with one of three catalysts: BASF NanoSelect™ LF 200, Lindlar’s catalyst and a cold-sprayed nickel surface [3]. The alkynes were chosen for their commercial relevance: BYD is reduced to (Z)-2-butene-1,4-diol (abbr. (Z)-BED), which is utilised in the synthesis of fine chemicals including vitamin B6 and GABAergic antiepileptic drugs, along with pesticides like endosulfan and dihydrofurans [9]. Almost 5000 tonnes of BED were produced in 2000 alone [10]. MBY is reduced to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (abbr. MBE), a key intermediate in the manufacture of vitamins A and E. Its importance should not be underestimated; the development of a synthetic route to vitamin A opened the door for NGOs like WHO and UNICEF to deliver supplements to over 40 countries [11], endeavours which have saved over 1.25 million lives since 1998 [11]."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the catalytic static mixers,"2.1 Preparation of the catalytic static mixers Three catalyst sets, each containing four CSMs, were investigated and are presented herein. Each CSM was made from a static mixer scaffold with a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 150 mm, which was then coated with a catalytic layer. The static mixers were printed from 316 L stainless steel powder using selective laser melting (SLM). Further details on CSM design and the printing process can be found in our earlier works [3–5]. The first set was wash-coated with BASF Nanoselect™ LF-200 (0.5 % colloidal palladium on titanium silicate, abbr. Pd-TS). The second set was wash-coated with Lindlar’s catalyst (5.0 % palladium on calcium carbonate with lead poison, abbr. Pd-LC). To prepare these CSMs, the stainless steel static mixers were first cleaned with hydrochloric acid followed by deionised water and acetone washes to remove any residual oil and solvent. An aqueous slurry was prepared by adding a predetermined amount of catalyst powder into water and it stirring overnight to obtain uniformity. Generally, the mixers were dipped in the slurry for a few seconds, followed by pressurised air blowing to eliminate excess liquid and prevent channel blockage. Finally, the mixers were placed in an oven under 120 °C to eliminate the residual solvent. This process was repeated 2–3 times to achieve the desired amount of catalyst loading and allow for comparable layer thicknesses across several CSMs. Before and after each coating step, the mass of each mixer was recorded to calculate the accumulative total catalyst loading. The third set of CSMs, termed nickel cold sprayed (abbr. Ni-CS), were prepared by metal cold spraying of nickel powder onto the stainless steel scaffold. Detailed description of the cold-spraying process, the printing process for CSMs and the catalytic flow reactor can be found in our previous works [3–5]. The three catalyst sets described above had the following noble metal loadings: Pd-TS: 0.018 mmol Pd per CSM, Pd-LC: 0.233 mmol Pd per CSM, Ni-CS: 14.06 mmol Ni per CSM."
3,Continuous flow hydrogenation experiments,"2.2 Continuous flow hydrogenation experiments A series of continuous flow hydrogenation experiments with gaseous hydrogen were conducted using a tubular CSM reactor, capable of operating up to 12 CSMs in series (each with a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 150 mm). For these studies, 4 CSMs were used and the remaining chambers occupied by ‘blank’ uncoated stainless steel mixers. The reactor and its general operation has been described in previous work [4–6,8]. Prior to first use, the CSMs were activated inside the reactor by flowing hydrogen over them at 195 mLN/min at 24 bar and 120 °C. Activation was conducted for 5 h for the Pd-TS and Pd-LC-coated CSMs, which has the effect of reducing any oxides present on the surface and normalising the size of the Pd metal nanoparticles formed [12]. The Ni-CS CSMs were activated for 24 h, reducing the nickel oxide that had formed on the surface via aerobic passivation and increasing the size of the metal particles [13]. After activation, the reactor was flushed with ethanol using the liquid reagent pump and slowly cooled. For a typical semi-hydrogenation of MBY or BYD over CSMs (see reaction schemes in Fig. 1 ) the following experimental protocol was employed. Upon reactor start-up, the washing solvent was introduced and the reactor heated and pressurised to the desired values. Thereafter, hydrogen gas was introduced at the gas flow rate intended to be used in the reaction, and the binary gas-solvent flow left for 15 min. This conditioning period facilitates the degradation of labile carbonaceous deposits that may be present on the CSM surfaces [14], as well as the adsorption of hydrogen to the metal nanoparticles and the redistribution of the metal by exposure to solvent and hydrogen [12]. The gas flow rate is determined by the desired hydrogen to substrate ratio (abbr. H/S), which usually varied between 1 and 2 for MBY reactions and between 1 and 20 for BYD reactions. The pump feed was then switched to a solution of alkyne. For alkyne solutions of concentration [0.5 M] and lower, the reagent solution was continuously flowed through the reactor until steady state was attained, at which point a 5−10 mL product fraction was collected and analysed by 1H-NMR and GC–MS For solutions exceeding [0.5 M], a 40 mL plug of alkyne solution was pumped through. The input feed was then switched back to solvent and several fractions collected. The steady state conversion was deduced by 1H-NMR and confirmed by GC–MS, both measured off-line. Further details on analysis methods and reagents can be found in notes and references. The four independent variables constituted pressure up to 24 bar, temperature up to 120 °C, liquid flow rate up to 45 mL/min and hydrogen to substrate ratio (abbr. H/S) up to a gas flow rate of 500 mLN/min. For each CSM-substrate pair, a minimum of ten hydrogenation experiments were conducted to identify the optimised conditions for alkene and space-time yields (abbr. STY). Optimisation was performed manually for all sets except for the hydrogenation of MBY over Lindlar’s-coated CSMs, for which a design of experiments (abbr. D.o.E.) program was used to generate and analyse a set of 16 screening experiments with one repeat. Manual optimisation was then performed on neat MBY based on the results of the D.o.E."
4,Looped flow hydrogenation experiment,"2.3 Looped flow hydrogenation experiment A loop flow experiment was performed for the semi-hydrogenation of [0.31 M] BYD in 30 % isopropyl alcohol in water (abbr. aq. iPrOH) over 12 Ni-CS CSMs at p =20 bar, T =55 °C, VL =1 mL/min and VG,N = 24.5 mLN/min (giving a nominal initial H/S = 3.24) in order to interrogate the substrate traces over time, from which kinetic data could be derived. Herein the reactor outlet was connected to the reservoir of starting material, hence the liquid phase was pumped in a closed loop through the reactor. First the entire reaction loop was primed with stock solution and brought up to reaction conditions. The reaction was started by introducing hydrogen, which constitutes time t0. The concentrations of BYD, the intermediate BED and the fully reduced product BAD inside the reservoir were analysed at various time intervals by 1H-NMR. This loop flow operation mode can be considered as a semi-batch process, as the liquid phase is processed over time in a closed loop (batch) while a constant continuous flow of hydrogen is fed through the reactor system (continuous)."

6,Optimisation of the semi-hydrogenation of MBY and BYD,"3.1 Optimisation of the semi-hydrogenation of MBY and BYD Fig. 2 and 3 show all experimental results collected on the semi-hydrogenation of MBY to MBE and BYD to BED, and Table 1 and 2 show selected examples from this data, where either the alkene yield or the space-time yield of the reaction was optimsed. The cluster of points in the top right-hand corner of Fig. 2 represents the superior performance of the Pd-TS catalyst in the semi-hydrogenation of MBY, achieving both >90 % conversion and >90 % selectivity. Lindlar's catalyst and BASF Nanoselect™ LF-200 have been extensively compared in the works of Vilé et al., who also found that at equal conversions in toluene, Pd-TS was more selective towards MBE than Pd-LC [15]. The authors attributed this to the endothermic adsorption of the hydroxyl group onto the surface of Pd-TS; in the case of Pd-LC, this adsorption is exothermic, resulting in a reduction in hydrogenation selectivity as the molecule is bound to the catalytic surface for longer [15]. Fig. 3 demonstrates that Pd-LC was the best for the reduction of BYD, with close to full conversion and >85 % selectivity. We hypothesise that the poor compatibility of BYD with Pd-TS originates from the unfavourable interactions between the hydroxyl groups and the catalytic surface, necessitating higher pressures and H/S ratios to achieve a good conversion which comes at the cost of selectivity. However these disparities may also arise from the different solvents or concentrations at which the alkyne hydrogenations were tested; later experiments demonstrated that Pd-LC did not perform particularly well for high-molarity solutions of BYD or neat MBY, thus its poor performance with the latter substrate may be a consequence of [6 M] concentration at which it was tested. The Ni-CS CSMs showed a performance intermediate between the Pd-TS and Pd-LC for both alkynes. That it was unable to achieve as high an alkene yield as the palladium catalysts is unsurprising: not only is palladium known to be uniquely highly selective for the alkene in alkyne hydrogenations [16], but Pd-LC [17] and Pd-TS [18] are specifically modified to increase their selectivity thereto. Furthermore, the Ni-CS nickel particle diameter distribution ranges from 0.1–10 μm, whereas the palladium on the LC and TS surfaces is nanoparticulate (smaller metal particles are generally more selective in alkyne hydrogenations [16]). Considerably more forcing conditions were required for the Ni-CS CSMs to achieve comparable conversions to the palladium catalysts due to the lower catalytic activity of nickel than palladium. However, these CSMs consistently demonstrated by far the highest space-time yields with up to 3 kg L-1 h-1 (see Table 1), which originates from their excellent performance at high liquid flow rates. This is most likely attributable to the significantly higher metal loading of the Ni-CS CSMs (60 times more than the Pd-LC and over 700 times more than the Pd-TS) which may make them better suited for high throughput and industrial production. The fact that the Pd-LC had a similar activity than Pd-TS, at a ∼10-fold higher Pd-loading, can be attributed to the cumulative poisoning effect of the lead and quinoline, which effectively inactivate up to 90 % of the catalytic sites [17]. Unfortunately, the Ni-CS CSMs suffered from the accumulation of superficial carbonaceous deposits after several weeks of operation (a well-documented drawback of nickel in catalytic hydrogenation [16]) visible as a brown layer covering the surfaces (Fig. 4 ). Despite this carbonaceous layer, the CSMs performed equally well as in their first tests. The first CSM inside the serial flow path showed the highest degree of material build-up, whilst the last CSM was almost unscathed. The hydrogenation of [6 M] MBY over Pd-LC was optimised using a D.o.E. setup (further details for which can be found in the supporting information), while all other MBY and BYD catalyst combinations were optimised manually. The D.o.E. approach was useful to map the sample space of the input-output parameter interactions, revealing relationships that could not be learned from the data originating from the manually optimised runs. However, of the seventeen D.o.E.-directed reactions performed, only five resulted in acceptable yields, hence the manual approach was chosen for all following investigations. 3.1.1 Effects of process conditions Some general trends were observed in the hydrogenation experiments. As expected, increasing pressure, liquid residence time and H/S ratios were associated with improved conversions but severely diminished alkene and (Z)-alkene selectivities (Fig. 5). Contrary to many literature studies [14,16,19], increasing temperature was also found to benefit conversion at the cost of selectivity. Analysis of our results from the D.o.E. confirmed these correlations, from which we were able to quantify the influence of each variable on the output parameters using the D.o.E. software as shown in Fig. 6. Without the aid of the D.o.E. program, the only effective visualisation of the input-output sample space could be achieved using heat-maps (cf. Table 3 ) owing to the difficulty of interpreting the interactions between four input and four output variables. Note that the fourth output parameter, the alkene yield, was derived from the conversion and the selectivity as the product of those two; hence it is considered an interdependent and not an independant output variable. 3.1.2 Effects of solvents The reduction of [0.31 M] BYD over the Ni-CS CSMs in methanolic solvent achieved greater conversions and space-time yields but poorer selectivities than in aq. iPrOH (cf. Table 4 ) which can be attributed to higher rates of hydrogenation in methanol. This is most likely a consequence of several interacting effects. Firstly, methanol is a slightly better solvent for hydrogen than 30 % aq. iPrOH [20], thus should facilitate a more rapid uptake of hydrogen by the nickel catalyst and therefore more rapid hydrogenations [21] (which would be perceived as an increase in conversion and decrease in selectivity). Secondly, greater substrate-solvent repulsions decrease the activation energy for hydrogenation, as highly solvated molecules are shielded from interacting with the catalytic surface. In situ tests indicated that BYD is more soluble in aq. iPrOH than methanol, reinforcing our hypothesis that hydrogenations should proceed more rapidly in methanol. Finally, Augustine and Techasauvapak state that competitive adsorption of solvent molecules against the substrate is the dominant solvent effect in the kinetics of catalytic hydrogenation [22]. The weaker nucleophilicity of methanol than water should mean it competes with the alkyne less effectively at the catalytic surface, occupying fewer catalytic sites and boosting the rate of hydrogenation. 3.1.3 Theoretical kinetic modelling (1) B Y D + H 2 → B E D r 1 = k 1 B Y D H 2 (2) B Y D + 2 H 2 → B A D r 2 = k 2 B Y D H 2 2 (3) B E D + H 2 → B A D r 3 = k 3 B E D H 2 To a degree of approximation, three elementary reaction pathways control the rate of production of BED and BAD from BYD, shown as schemes 1−3. This is a highly reductive overview, as in reality multiple pathways lead to the formation of these and other products such as the (E)-alkene, and adsorption and mass transfer kinetics play a significant role. However, these assumptions are sufficient for this system. Just considering these three reaction pathways and assuming a constant H2 concentration (vide infra), rate equations for the individual alkyne, alkene and alkane concentrations can be derived as functions of time (all of which could ostensibly be extended to the hydrogenation of any alkyne). Curve fitting of experimental data can then be used to find the values of the rate constants. Detailed derivations of the rate laws for BYD, BED and BAD shown below can be found in the supporting information. B Y D = B Y D 0 e - k 1 H 2 + k 2 H 2 2 t B E D = B Y D 0 k 1 k 3 - k 1 - k 2 H 2 e - k 1 H 2 + k 2 H 2 2 t - e - k 3 H 2 t B A D = B Y D 0 - B Y D 0 k 1 + k 2 H 2 - k 3 k 2 H 2 - k 3 e - k 1 H 2 + k 2 H 2 2 t + k 1 e - k 3 H 2 t 3.1.4 Kinetic study using a looped flow setup In order to derive k-values for this kinetic model, a closed-circuit loop experiment was set up over Ni-CS CSMs wherein the reactor outlet was connected to the reservoir of starting material. Our studies on the influence of process parameters demonstrated that selective hydrogenation to the alkene was favoured by milder conditions, so, to achieve a selective reaction, a low temperature was chosen, although the pressure and H/S had to be higher to attain reasonable rates of reaction over the Ni-CS CSMs. This setup was beneficial for analysis because it allowed the [H2] parameter to be considered quasi-constant over time and along the length of the tubular reactor system, as a constant flow of hydrogen was delivered through the loop system at a high H/S ratio in combination with a fixed volume of starting material. This assumption is correct for all data points barring the first two (see supporting information), which explains the somewhat large discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental BED concentrations, and can be attributed to the initial competition between alkyne and hydrogen for adsorption to the metal surface. Fig. 7 shows the consumption of BYD and production of BED and BAD over time. The consumption of BYD follows an exponential decay curve, exhibiting pseudo-first order properties with an apparent rate constant kapp = 1.056 × 10−4. Based on our experimental observations and the kinetic model described above, we calculated the following rate constants: k 1 = 1.18 × 10−4 L mol−1 s−1; k 2 = 2.08 × 10−5 L2 mol−2 s−1; k 3 = 1.34 × 10−4 L mol−1 s−1. From this, the following initial rates of reaction can be calculated: r 1(t = 0) = 2.77 × 10−5 mol L−1 s−1; r 2(t = 0 s) = 3.70 × 10−6 mol L−1 s−1; r 3(t = 0) =0 mol L−1 s−1. These initial rates are also the maxima for r 1 and r 2 respectively (as they are dependent on [BYD] which is highest at t = 0); the maximum rate for reaction 3 is at t ≈ 9000 s, where r 3(t = 9000) = 1.12 × 10−5 mol L−1 s−1. The excellent fit between the experimental data and theoretical kinetics may suggest that CSMs are a good medium by which to test the intrinsic rate constants of new and commercial catalysts; however, this hypothesis needs to be validated first with further investigations, to exclude the potential of this being an artefact of the curve-fitting methods. The presence of a significant quantity of BAD in the reaction solution at the first time-point suggests that the direct hydrogenation of BYD to BAD without desorption (mechanistic selectivity pathway [], scheme 2) is a thermodynamically viable pathway, as the alternative thermodynamic selectivity pathway (schemes 1 and 3) requires the reduction of BYD to BED followed by its desorption, re-adsorption and hydrogenation to BAD[16]. Since both adsorption to a metal facet (due to the relief of strain from opening one of the π-bonds) and hydrogenation are more favourable for an alkyne than an alkene [16], the presence of sufficient BYD should competitively inhibit the adsorption and hydrogenation of BED. However, to explain the low BED:BAD ratio of 2.2:1 at the first time point (corresponding to 13 % conversion) the mechanistic selectivity pathway must be invoked. The thermodynamic selectivity pathway is favoured at higher BED concentrations, specifically when r 3 > r 2, which occurs at the concentration: k 3 k 2 H 2 B E D > B Y D Under these conditions, this means the thermodynamic selectivity pathway is kinetically favoured at 8.5 [BED] > [BYD]. This is characteristic of unmodified metal surfaces like the Ni-CS, whilst a smaller multiplier would be expected for catalysts optimised for alkene selectivity (such as Pd-TS) due to their suppression of the pathway corresponding to k 3 [16]."
7,Benchmarking against conventional technology,"3.2 Benchmarking against conventional technology We benchmarked the performance of the CSMs presented herein against data reported in the literature on packed bed, stirred tank, round-bottom flask, monolith and capillary systems (Fig. 8 and 9 ). Comparisons of the CSM performance against these literature values reveals a consistently superior performance of our structured catalyst in terms of both space-time and alkene yields. The most productive packed bed entry for MBY is based on palladium embedded in titanium nanotubes [23], which suffers from far lower scalability and significantly higher cost than commercially available catalysts. For BYD, several catalyst systems achieve better molecular yields [24–26]; however, these are all in batch setups, thus are much more difficult to scale up, have lower STYs and lack several of the advantages of a tubular or column type continuous flow system."
8,Leaching,"3.3 Leaching Leaching tests were conducted on the output of the reactor with a standardised continuous hydrogenation protocol reducing vinyl acetate to ethyl acetate over a total run time of several hours. The results shown in Table 5 revealed slight leaching from the stainless steel bodies of the reactor and mixer cores, with the major metal species of 316 L steel, such as Fe, Cr and Ni, all being found in detectable quantities. The only significant leaching of catalytic metal came in the form of nickel from the surfaces of the cold sprayed mixers, which is less concerning than the leaching of palladium as the maximum acceptable oral concentration limit for nickel (10 ppm) in pharmaceutical products is double that of palladium [35]."
9,Conclusions,"Excellent results have been achieved for the partial hydrogenations of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol and 2-butyne-1,4-diol over catalytic static mixers coated with palladium and nickel catalysts. The adaptability of a CSM-based system has proved extremely useful, as each of the three catalysts tested was superior in at least one aspect: Pd-LC catalyst for conversion and selectivity of BYD reductions, Pd-TS for conversion and selectivity of MBY reductions and nickel cold sprayed for overall productivity and space-time yield. The CSMs demonstrate catalytic behaviour consistent with packed bed catalysts, responding to parametric variation in predictable ways, and outperform several academically tested catalytic systems in terms of both alkene yields and space-time yields. The reaction kinetics have also been modelled and the rate constants for each elementary pathway have been determined."
