0,Introduction,"Greener energy and climate change represent global challenges from current state-of-the-art technologies, mostly based on fossil fuel transformation [1]. Artificial fuel generation based in semiconductors would offer a route for a sustainable and green energy when using renewable feedstocks as reactant(s) of the chemical processes [2–5]. In this context, production of hydrogen using bio-alcohols as sacrificial agents has been shown as a feasible and attractive photocatalytic route from both energy and environmental perspectives [6–18]. Among bio-alcohols, methanol provides significant activity for hydrogen photo-production and is considered a model molecule for the above mentioned process. [19–23]. Moreover, methanol is foreseen as a key energy vector for a greener future. In essence, in photo-catalytic processes bio-alcohols (including methanol) are hole capture reactants, facilitating the electron path to the photocatalyst surface, allowing thus to this charge carrier to be involved in chemical steps leading to the generation of hydrogen gas [2,22]. Titania is an universal photocatalyst due to their inherent, good properties (such as low cost, wide availability, significant stability and activity) and appears as an optimum choice for production of hydrogen from bio-alcohols [2,3]. As shown in many studies, combination with noble metals and particularly platinum as co-catalyst considerably enhances titania photoactivity in this reaction. In the presence of the noble metal, charge recombination is decreased due to the active role played by platinum in electron trapping processes. In addition, the coupling of two protons to generate hydrogen is a well established reaction occurring at metal surfaces, which will enhance the production of hydrogen with respect to the situation typical for a oxide (titania) surface [8,22]. In spite of the mentioned two main roles played by the noble metal, the activity of Pt-loaded titania samples has been frequently rationalized in terms of a significant number of physicochemical properties related to morphology including size, shape, and porosity of both components but also interface contact or properties between the metal and the oxide, as well as electron-acceptor properties of the metal phase itself and subsequent beneficial effects in charge recombination [24–35]. The importance or prevalence of one of these properties has not been addressed completely in the literature although thorough discussions are available in review works [2,3,5,36,37]. Several preparation methods have been essayed to disperse platinum onto the Evonik P25 titania surface, photodeposition or impregnation (the latter in combination with chemical or thermal reduction) being probably two of the most used ones [7–35]. Here we will use the chemical reduction procedure, controlling the two variables previously shown to affect metal dispersion to a significant degree. These variables are the reductant to noble metal molar ratio as well as controlling the atmosphere, and particularly eliminating oxygen from it [38,39]. Using thus Pt-promoted P25 supported materials, we tested the photoactivity using methanol as sacrificial agent. To measure the activity we calculated the true quantum efficiency of the production of hydrogen. Following the numerical procedures developed previously by Alfano, Marugán and coworkers [40–42], we carry the study of the radiation absorption and scattering effects of the suspended catalysts and with this we measured on rigorous basis the efficiency of the hydrogen photo-production using methanol as sacrificial agent. Such study was combined with a careful physicochemical characterization of the catalytic solids (using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron, UV–visible and photoluminescence spectroscopies as well as a detailed microscopy analysis) together with an in situ analysis using infrared under illumination conditions. Our main goal was to measure on quantitative basis (using the efficiency parameter) and interpret (through the in situ IR study) the role of the interface in the reaction. To do it, the Pt primary particle size as well as charge carrier handling by the whole noble metal – titania system is kept constant in the samples under study. In this way we eliminate the parameters mentioned in the literature as most significant to drive hydrogen production in photo-reforming reactions [7–35]. We will show that the metal-oxide interface properties influence decisively the value of the true quantum efficiency."
1,Experimental,
2,Sample preparation,"2.1 Sample preparation TiO2/Pt composite photocatalysts were prepared by a deposition method, in which commercial TiO2 (P25, Evonik) was used as support to deposit Pt nanoparticles under an inert gas atmosphere. The P25 was suspended by stirring in a deionized water solution for 30min. After that, a certain quantity of H2PtCl6 (Aldrich) was added to the solution (to get a 0.5wt.% of Pt on metal basis) and kept on stirring along 5min more. Then, a NaBH4 aqueous solution was quickly added, where the molar ratio between Pt and NaBH4 was 1:x. In this work x varied from 2.5 to 10. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1h and then centrifuged, and the separated solid was rinsed with distilled water and dried at 100°C for 12h. The different samples were named as P25-xPt, where x is the molar ratio of NaBH4 (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10) with respect to Pt. Chemical analysis by total reflection X-ray Fluorescence (Bruker S2 PicoFox, and FEI 8030c) confirmed the Pt weight present at the catalysts as the nominal one, with a maximum error of 2.7%. P25 was treated with NaBH4 with a quantity similar to that used for the P25-5Pt sample to serve as reference. The absence of Cl, B and Na was confirmed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence in all samples."
3,Characterization techniques,"2.2 Characterization techniques XRD profiles of the samples were obtained using a Seifert D-500 diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation with a 0.02° step. Crystallite sizes were estimated using XRD and the Willianson–Hall formalism. The BET surface areas and average pore sizes and pore volumes were measured by nitrogen physisorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Shimadzu UV2100 apparatus using BaSO4 as a reference. Photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer LS50B). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed with a spectrometer Physical Electronics 5700 using a Mg Ka source (1253.6eV) (model 04-548 Dual Anode X-ray Source). The X-ray source was run at a power of 300W (10keV and 30mA). All spectra were obtained at 5·10−10 Torr of vacuum and using a 720μm diameter analysis area. The specimens were analyzed at an angle of 45° to the surface plane. The X-ray source was located at 54° relative to the analyzer axis. Binding energy (BE) values were referred to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8eV. Survey and multiregion spectra were recorded at C 1s, O 1s, Ti 2p and Pt 4f photoelectron peaks. The atomic concentrations were calculated from the photoelectron peak areas using Shirley background subtraction [43] and sensitivity factors provided by the spectrometer manufacturer PHI (Physical Electronics, 6509 Flying Cloud Drive, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, USA). For the study of the Pt 4f signal of the Pt-containing solids, the background of the Pt 4f region of the support P25 was subtracted. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectra (XEDS) were recorded on a JEOL 2100F TEM/STEM microscope. XEDS analysis was performed in STEM mode, with a probe size ∼1nm, using the INCA x-sight (Oxford Instruments) detector. Specimens were prepared by depositing particles of the samples to be investigated onto a copper grid supporting a perforated carbon film. Deposition was achieved by dipping the grid directly into the powder of the samples to avoid contact with any solvent. Particle size distributions of the noble metal were obtained counting more than 150 particles in all cases. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectra (DRIFTS) were taken in a Bruker Vertex 80 FTIR spectrometer using a MCT detector and running under OPUS/IR software. The setup consists of a praying mantis DRIFTS accessory (Harrick Scientific) and a reaction cell (HVC, Harrick Scientific). The reaction mixture was prepared by injecting 3000ppm of methanol (⩾99%; Aldrich) into a wet (1:9 methanol, MeOH, to water ratio) N2 flow before entering the DRIFTS cell. Higher quantities of methanol provide a strong gas-phase IR signal which does not allow to obtain any information of the surface species. The DRIFTS spectra were collected in the range of 4000–600cm−1 with a resolution of 2cm−1, by averaging 10 scans over a total of 1.2s. In DRIFTS experiments in situ light excitation was carried out using 365nm (20nm half-width) radiation. Each sample, without any previous treatment, was subjected in a continuous mode (without modifying gas mixture) to a single, multi-step experiment which aims to test the following: (i) adsorption of the reactive mixture under dark conditions, (ii) reaction mixture evolution under illumination conditions, and (iii) subsequent stay at dark conditions. Spectra were taken after different exposure times to verify any evolution behavior."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements Regarding photocatalytic measurements, they were carried out using a batch pyrex (cutting absorption at ca. 290nm) reactor, in which the photocatalyst was in a 1:u (v/v; u from 3 to 9) MeOH/H2O mixture medium maintained at a constant temperature (25±1°C). A schematic representation of the reactor is presented in Fig. 1 . The catalyst suspension (0.5gL−1) was degassed with an Ar stream for 20min (the absence of oxygen in the gas stream checked by Mass Spectrometry). The solution inside the reactor was irradiated using a Hg-Xe lamp (500W) and a dichroic filter allowing exposure of the catalysis to the 280–400nm wavelength range. An Ar flow of 10mLmin−1 (further increase in the flow does not affect catalytic results) was used to transport the gas-phase products of the reaction to the detection system. Fig. 1 presents a schematic representation of the photoreactor. The reaction rates were evaluated at 3h from the start of the irradiation, where a pseudo-stationary situation is reached. The concentration of reactants and products was analyzed using an on-line Mass spectrometry (Omnistar 300) and gas chromatography (Agilent 6890)."
5,Calculation of photocatalytic efficiencies,"2.4 Calculation of photocatalytic efficiencies Two photocatalytic efficiency observables related to the H2 generation are usually calculated. According to their corresponding definitions, they can be understood as two accuracy levels to compare the efficiency of the photocatalytic processes occurring during the reaction. The strictest one is the so-called quantum efficiency and is defined, according to the IUPAC recommendation [44], as the ratio of the number of molecules produced and the number of photon interacting with the sample (Eq. (1)). (1) η q ( % ) = 100 × 2 × r ( mol m - 3 s - 1 ) e a ( Einstein m - 3 s - 1 ) This equation takes into account that the transfer of two electrons is required to produce one H2 molecule. The reaction rate can be easily calculated from experimental catalytic experiments (described above, in this experimental section); however, the denominator requires the solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the heterogeneous reactor used to measure photocatalytic properties. The second efficiency observable according to the IUPAC is the so-called photonic efficiency (also called apparent quantum efficiency) of the reaction and it can be determined as follows: (2) η p ( % ) = 100 × 2 × r ( mol m - 2 s - 1 ) × V ( m 3 ) q ( Einstein m - 3 s - 1 ) × A ( m 2 ) where, besides the reaction rate defined before, V is the reactor volume, and q represents the incident radiation flux averaged in the illuminated reactor surface (A). A value of q equal to 1.8×10−7 Einsteincm−2 s−1 at the sample average position was experimentally measured using a radiometer (Delta OHM). In this work, we also report the photon absorption efficiency (ηA ). This last, provides information of the radiation intensity lost and can be expressed as follows: (3) η A ( % ) = 100 × e a ( Einstein m - 3 s - 1 ) × V ( m 3 ) q ( Einstein m - 3 s - 1 ) × A ( m 2 ) The average volumetric rate of photon absorption (ea in Eq. (1)), was obtained by solving the RTE which can be expressed as Eq. (4) assuming (i) the emission radiation is negligible and (ii) steady state condition during the photocatalytic processes [40,42]. (4) dI λ , Ω ̲ ( x ̲ ) ds = - κ λ ( x ̲ ) I λ , Ω ̲ ( x ̲ ) - σ λ ( x ̲ ) I λ , Ω ̲ ( x ̲ ) + σ λ ( x ̲ ) 4 π ∫ Ω ′ = 4 π p ( Ω ′ ̲ → Ω ̲ ) I λ , Ω ′ ̲ To solve Eq. (4), it is necessary to determine, first, the optical properties of the photocatalyst suspensions. This is (i) the spectral absorption coefficient ( κ λ ), the spectral scattering coefficient ( σ λ ), and the scattering phase ( p ( Ω ′ ̲ → Ω ̲ ) ). Here, and according to previous successful studies in similar TiO2-based catalysts [42,45], the Henyey and Greenstein phase function (Eq. (5)) was adopted to calculate the scattering phase function [46]. (5) p ( Ω ′ ̲ → Ω ̲ ) = 1 - g λ 2 1 + g λ 2 - 2 g λ 2 u 0 3 / 2 where g λ is the so-called asymmetry factor and u 0 is the director cosine between ingoing at outgoing radiation. The optical properties were obtained by solving the RTE (which considers radiation absorption and scattering effect by the catalyst) using the discrete ordinate method (MOD) in a rectangular spectrophotometer cell in combination with a nonlinear, multiparameter regression procedure (lsqnonlin, Algorithm: Trust-Region-Reflective Optimization). Before that, the extinction coefficients ( β λ ) were obtained by applying a standard linear regression to the plots of β λ versus catalyst concentration C in a broad range (0.1–5×10−3 gL−1). Besides, considering that the cell can be represented as an infinite plane parallel medium with azimuthal symmetry, a one-dimensional, one-directional radiation transport model can be used to solve the RTE. Fig.2 A shows a schematic representation of the RTE solution scheme where the net light intensity is presented by one angular-related variable (μ =cos(θ)) at each point of the cell one-dimensional (x variable) representation. The fitting procedure renders the values of ω λ (the so-called albedo defined in Eq. (6)) and g λ (Eq. (5)) parameters that minimize the differences between model predictions and experimental data of diffuse transmittance and reflectance measurements at the spectrophotometric cell for a set of catalyst concentrations, C, and in the wavelength range of the light source [45,47]. Then, the volumetric scattering and absorption coefficients can be obtained as follows: (6) σ λ = β λ ∗ ω λ (7) κ λ = β λ - σ λ The extinction β λ , scattering σ λ and absorption κ λ coefficients, as well as the asymmetry factor g for all samples of the study are presented in Fig. 3 . Once the optical properties of the catalyst(s) have been established, the evaluation of the radiation field inside the photoreactor can be carried out. The MOD tool was used to transform the integro-differential equation (4) into a system of algebraic equations that can be solved numerically. Our reactor configuration requires the use of a cylindrical two-dimensional ( r - z variables), two-directional ( θ - ϕ variables) model of the photoreactor radiation field (Fig.2B and C). The net radiation intensity at each r - z point of the reactor is now represented using a discretized spatial mesh having two angular-related coordinates μ = cos ( θ ) ; η = cos ( ϕ ) . Fig.2C displays μ ; η unitary, basal projection(s) in a quadrant of the space around a r - z point calculated using the so-called S16 method [40]. The computation of the intensity at each point of the reactor requires to divide the space in 4 quadrants as depicted in Fig.2D and the measurement of the incident light intensity at the frontier (liquid surface) using actinometry [40–42,47]. According to the Duderstadt and Martin recommendation [48], and following the numerical procedure scheme detailed by previous authors [40–42], the finite difference (MOD) was derived directly from the radiation balance for each mesh cell (Fig.2D). Finally, once the intensities were obtained, the local volumetric rate of photon absorption ( e a ) was calculated at each r - z point of the reactor according to the following: (8) e a = ∫ λ κ λ ( x ̲ ) ∫ Ω = 4 π I λ , Ω ̲ ( x ̲ ) d Ω d λ"
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization results,"3.1 Characterization results The XRD patterns presented in Fig. 4 show contributions from the anatase polymorph having the I41/amd space group as well as a relatively minor one of the rutile (P42/mnm) phases. These two phases of the materials appear in a ca. 80/20 (anatase:rutile) ratio according to the calculation method of Zhang et al. [49]. This corresponds to the well-known pattern of the P25 material (also included in Fig. 4 for comparison purposes), which displays unnoticeable changes after the deposition of the noble metal for all samples studied in this work. The absence of XRD platinum signals can be thus mentioned, in accordance with the relatively limited amount of active metal present in the catalysts. The anatase phase displays a primary particle size always close to 20nm while the rutile phase counterpart is close to 30nm (Table 1 ). The relative constancy of these values is an expected fact considering the method of preparation described in the previous, experimental section. In consonance with the XRD results, the morphological properties obtained by N2 physisorption do not reflect changes after platinum deposition in the preparation conditions tested. In fact, the surface area as well as pore volume and size values characteristic of the P25 sample appears, within experimental error, unperturbed as an effect of platinum deposition in all samples (see morphology information collected in Table 1). The structural and morphological stability of the support during the noble metal deposition is translated in the similar optical properties displayed by the solids according to Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows rather subtle differences in optical properties of importance in the rate of photon absorption (Eq. (8)) and thus negligible influence in (potential) efficiency parameter variations among samples (Eq. (1)). Fig. 5 presents the UV–visible spectra of the catalysts. Small differences among samples are observed around 375nm, and in fact a shoulder is visible for the P25-2.5Pt sample and is almost absent for the rest of samples. The small shoulder at ca. 375nm indicates the presence of a oxidized Pt fraction (specifically the presence of metal – oxychloride bonds; see Ref. [50]) as below justified using XPS. The UV–visible spectra of the solids are dominated by the characteristic sigmoidal feature of titania samples and correspond (in our case) to a physical average of the anatase and rutile valence to conduction band excitation(s). Assuming both oxides as indirect gap semiconductors [51], they provide a pseudo band gap energy corresponding to the molar average between phases present at each sample. These band gap values are summarized in Table 1. The constancy of the observable is again noticed, in accordance with the above mentioned unperturbed state of the oxide component after metal deposition. The combination of the XRD, morphology and optical results indicates the noble metal deposition that occurs with minimal disturbance of the Evonik P25 support. We note, on the other hand, that the XPS/XEDS analysis of the surface, rendered similar Ti/O ratios for all samples, while chemical analysis indicated the absence of sodium or chlorine from such surfaces. Together with the XRD and UV–visible study, the same (within experimental error) Ti/O XPS ratio indicates no appreciable effects of the Pt deposition in P25 physicochemical properties (including localized or band-type electronic states). The physicochemical properties of the platinum co-catalyst were analyzed with the help of microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fig. 6 displays representative TEM micrographs for the four samples studied. TEM studies showed the presence of the noble metal (chemical composition further corroborated using XEDS) at the surface of the ca. 20–30nm platelet-like oxide nanoparticles. In all cases, we observed round-shaped platinum particles, indicative of quasi-spherical particles, dispersed onto the surface of the materials. This metal morphology is the most commonly observed in titania supported materials [23,33,35]. The analysis of the corresponding noble metal particle size distributions is presented in Fig. 7 . The morphological values included in Table 2 indicate the relative similitude of the platinum particles in all samples, and this is measured not only in terms of the mean size but also of higher order moments (variance). It is also interesting to note the fine control of the particle size achieved, with average size close to 1.0nm and relatively small tails, extending only up to ca. 3nm, for all samples studied here. The average particle size and variance are compared favorably with the results presented previously in the literature using the same amount of metal and different preparation procedures such as photo or chemical deposition methods [23,33,35]. This indicates the significant uniformity in terms of primary particle size achieved using our preparation method. To further analyze the particle size distribution and particularly, the properties of primary importance in photocatalysts, we have measured the metal surface area exposed to the reactants using the full size distribution and considering quasi-spherical, cubo-octahedral noble metal particles [56]. As it is usually carried out, this observable is presented as a dispersion value. We estimated that the noble metal has a rather good dispersion, above 0.84, for all samples and that differences among samples are rather small, below 2.5% (0.85±0.01 for all samples). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was further used to characterize the noble metal component. We particularly focus on the analysis of platinum oxidation state. The Pt 4f core level spectra of the studied samples, after background subtraction of the Ti 3s plasmon loss, are presented in Fig. 8 . The limited metal loading (0.5wt.%) and the high dispersion of the Pt metal (modulating metallic type states by quantum confinement) make difficult to obtain clean XPS signals (the signal to noise ratio in the samples is ca. 2–3). Note also that alternative Pt core level peaks such as Pt 4d (recorded for our samples) or others are not useful due to the strongly limited intensity displayed in the case of our samples. The Pt 4f core level signal is, as mentioned, overlapping with the Ti 3s plasmon loss signal, a fact that increases the complexity of the analysis [52]. The background was obtained from the P25 sample but the subtraction produces some uncertainty in the high binding energy side of the Pt 4f spectra. Thus we focus on the (qualitative) analysis at the lower binding energy region presented in Fig. 8. We observe the predominant presence of Pt(0) (with a Pt 4f 7/2 peak at ca. 70.8eV) for all samples except for sample P25-2.5Pt, where an oxidized Pt state displaying intensity at ca. 72.5eV appears dominant. The binding energy of the last contribution suggests a partially oxidized state below Pt(II) [52,53]. The XPS results are in agreement with the conclusions extracted from the UV–visible spectra. As the primary particle size of Pt and dispersion is nearly identical in the materials, we can conclude that a important fraction of Pt is reduced in the sample series as the borohydride:metal ratio increases. The noble metal (chemical state) variation throughout the sample series seems in any case of rather limited magnitude if we dismiss the P25-2.5Pt catalyst."
8,Photoactivity measurements: quantum efficiency,"3.2 Photoactivity measurements: quantum efficiency The photo-catalytic production of hydrogen obtained using the samples and methanol as sacrificial agent is displayed in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9 we present an analysis of the performance as a function of the sample for a 1:9 MeOH:H2O mixture. Similar results are obtained for other MeOH:H2O ratios. As can be seen in this Fig., the reaction rate is sensitive to the synthesis conditions. This produces a maximum difference in rate larger than 3. Due to the minute differences among samples in the noble metal phase in terms of dispersion observed by TEM (Table 2), such difference value is essentially maintained if the rate would be normalized per Pt surface molar content. This indicates that although optimization of both the amount of platinum surface exposed to reactants and the support are critical to obtain high activity [2,3,5,36], there are other significant parameters affecting activity so as to render differences above 300% in our series of samples. Fig. 10 presents the variation of the reaction rate as a function of the MeOH:H2O ratio for the most active P25-5Pt sample. An acute dependence of the rate with this experimental variable is observed in this figure. This dependence is somewhat similar to results previously published by other groups with a significant dependence at relatively low methanol content [54,55]. Note however that the plateau typically observed at higher methanol concentration is here less marked than in other cases [55]. In any case, our maximum rate is of ca. 27.6mmolg−1 h−1 or 1.22mmolmol-Ptsurf. −1 h−1 (calculated assuming a metal dispersion of 0.86, obtained by considering quasi-spherical noble metal particles. See Ref. [56] for details of the calculation). These values are comparable with the best rates reported in the literature [12,32,33,35,54,57,58]. The reusability was also tested at the optimum reaction conditions displayed in Fig. 10 and differences below 5% were noted in three recycling times. To measure the chemical behavior of P25-Pt samples in hydrogen production on truly quantitative basis, we calculated the “true” quantum efficiency for hydrogen production using our samples. In Fig. 11 we plot the values of the photonic (ηp ) and quantum (ηq ) efficiency observables for all P25 and Pt-loaded samples using the reaction rates obtained in 1:9 CH3OH:H2O mixture and presented in Fig. 9. According to equation 1, we obtained a maximum ηq value of ca. 5.6%, with an enhancement ratio with respect to the bare titania of 104. So, Pt can increase the real performance of titania by two orders of magnitude. The photonic efficiencies are always lower than quantum efficiencies (a fact general in photocatalytic measurements and coming directly from their definitions) but presenting the same trend and rather minute differences when comparing samples of the series. The small differences presented in Fig. 11 evolution between the two efficiency observables through the sample series comes from the different physical observables present in the denominator of Eqs. (1) and (2). More specifically, while it is a constant though the sample series in Eq. (2), in Eq. (1) we detected limited differences among samples originated by the different absorption and scattering capabilities of the materials (as exemplified by the radiation absorption efficiency ηA presented as well in Fig. 11) and affecting the quantum efficiency evolution. In any case, the trends of the two efficiency observables are rather similar and differ only in subtle details. The quantum efficiency ηq of the P25-5Pt samples for hydrogen production ranges from 5.6 to 28.0% as a function of the methanol to water ratio. These values are rather high, ca. one to two orders of magnitude, when compared with typical values for photo-degradation of several pollutants using P25 photocatalysts [42,59]. This indicates the large efficiency achieved in this particular reaction, with a significant use of the available photons. Other metal-promoted titania catalysts having Pt [12,20], Cu [15,16] or Ni [60] previously published in the literature reported photonic efficiencies calculated in a similar way (although the q observable is not always obtained for the whole wavelength range used in the experiments) from ca. 2 to 8%. However, we did not find any report in the literature concerning the true quantum efficiency for hydrogen production using titania-based photocatalysts. Only Pt-promoted carbon nitride based materials presenting quantum efficiencies below 2% under sunlight-type excitation have been previously reported [61]. As mentioned, the true quantum efficiency values just reported strongly indicate the significant activity and efficient use of photons achieved by the P25-5Pt sample."
9,Interpretation of photoactivity,"3.3 Interpretation of photoactivity To further analyze the role of the platinum component in the activation of methanol we presented in Fig. 12 an in situ infrared study of two catalysts by showing difference spectra taking as background the first spectrum obtained during each step (from i to iii) of the treatment of the samples consisting in sequential: (i) adsorption of methanol in the presence of water vapor, (ii) reaction mixture (methanol:water) under illumination conditions, and (iii) subsequent stay at dark conditions under the same reactive mixture used in previous steps of the experiment. Samples were not pre-treated prior to IR measurements. As demonstrated previously, hydrogen is produced in a stoichiometric ratio with the methanol consumed in the reaction [22,62]. Such stoichiometric ratio depends on the carbon containing products that are photo-generated. Protons (or proton-related entities such as OHs) extracted from the sacrificial agent suffer, on the other hand, fast scrambling with water-related entities at the titania surface [22,63,64]. The studies indicate that the limiting factor in hydrogen production can be related to the transformation of methanol at the surface of the catalyst, which is here followed using infrared spectroscopy. The infrared analysis started with the analysis of methanol adsorption onto the catalysts surfaces. In B,G panels of Fig. 12 we observed for both samples a complex line shape in the CH stretch region (2980–2800cm−1) with at least four peaks, although one is not fully resolved and detected only as a shoulder of the main peak of the lower wave number region. The CH region would thus indicate the co-existence of methanol (2947/2838cm−1) and methoxy (2922/2814cm−1) species [16,65,66]. The presence of methoxy species can be confirmed by the presence of the CO stretching at ca. 1100cm−1, although the intensity in this region is hardy quantitative in our case due to the strong absorption of the samples below ca. 1200cm−1. The dissociate (methoxy) species, presenting the symmetric and asymmetric CH stretch at the lower wave number part of each spectral feature of the 2980–2800 region, seems to be present in significant quantities in both samples but with larger intensity in the case of the P25-10Pt case (panels B, G in Fig. 12). Methanol/methoxy adsorption displaces water from the surface as demonstrated by the negative peaks at the hydroxyl (3650–3000cm−1; panels A, F of Fig. 12) and molecular water (the above mentioned region and the region around 1590cm−1; panels E, J of Fig. 12) regions. Additional positive peaks at the 1570–1300cm−1 region are also observed in panels E, J of Fig. 12 and would be indicative of the presence of carboxylates. Specifically, for both samples positive peaks at 1550–1510, and 1360–1350cm−1 indicate the presence of (likely bidentate) formate groups while the broad peak(s) presented in the 1440–1410cm−1 would indicate the simultaneous presence of acetate species although this wave number region might also have (minor) contributions for methanol/methoxy species [67–69]. Under illumination of the samples, methanol/methoxy species are progressively consumed from the surface of both samples mostly producing CO2 at the gas phase (signal around 2350cm−1; panels C, H of Fig. 12). During reaction methoxy species increase their relative coverage with respect to methanol ones. In any case, the surface coverages of the methanol-related ad-species remaining at the P25 support under reaction conditions have an inverse correlation with the CO2 gas formed, indicating the direct relationship between the evolution of the methanol molecule and the production of CO2. As mentioned this also has a direct consequence in hydrogen production [22], and the differences between the two samples studied using infrared correlate well with this hypothesis. The most active sample, P25-5Pt, is able to transform methanol-type species more effectively than the P25-10Pt sample. Note, on the other hand, that the methanol degradation pathway or mechanism under illumination is rather difficult to be fully clarified but interesting clues are provided by the infrared study presented in Fig. 12. Apart from the above mentioned moieties, in the 1650–1300cm−1 range the spectra taken under illumination conditions present a negative peak at ca. 1590cm−1 and a series of positive peaks appearing at the 1550–1350cm−1 region (panels E, J of Fig. 12). Although tracking these ill-defined contributions is complex, it appears that new peaks at 1530–1520 (both samples), 1460 (P25-10Pt) and 1400 (P25-5Pt) cm−1 indicate the increasing presence of additional carboxylate moieties at the surface of titania. The P25-5Pt sample seems to produce preferentially formates while the P25-10Pt sample produces formate and acetate species. Note however that the main methoxy and carboxylate species detected in the titania surface are not strongly affected during the dark period which finalizes the experiment. Although this is not a definitive proof, the result strongly suggests that the majority of the species responsible for these carboxylate-type signals detected by IR have long residence for half-life times at the surface of the catalysts which may suffer a slow desorption kinetics from the titania surface. In spite of it, the presence of carboxylate moieties at the oxide surface is, according to the literature, promoted by the noble metal and light simultaneous action [70]. The IR results of Fig. 13 , corresponding to the P25 support, show the limited production of carboxylate species in the case of the bare oxide. Moreover, differences in the carboxylate-related frequencies in the 1600–1350cm−1 region are obvious in the presence or absence of Pt (panels E of Figs. 12 and 13). Such differences start at the saturation steps and further appear during photo-reaction. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, although there are a significant number of carboxylate-type species at the oxide component surface and not all are likely active species, it appears that the carboxylate species in contact with then noble metal evolve faster than those at the bare titania surface. More in depth information related to the fate of carbon-containing species in close proximity to the noble metal comes from the negative peaks visible in panels D and I of Fig. 12 and located at 2065–2060 and 1997cm−1, pointing out to adsorption of CO over on-top and bridge sites of metallic platinum nanoparticles [71,72]. It is important to note that the characteristic CO species over titania (ca. 2175–2120cm−1; see Ref. [73]) are not observed for the samples (Fig. 12) nor for the support alone under reaction (see Fig. 13; panel D). This analysis indicates that methanol-related fragments approaching the platinum titania interface are quickly oxidized, forming carbon oxides, in contraposition to the slower reaction of carboxylate-type species at the titania surface. The initial presence of CO at the platinum surface and the corresponding (negative) intensity correlate well with the initial (burst) production of CO2 when comparing the two samples. The progressive variation of the CO signal under reaction (as we show difference spectra, indicative of CO evolution), the constancy of relatively weak CO signals at post-reaction, dark conditions (as we show difference spectra from the initial spectrum at dark, no significant CO increase can be discerned), and the (qualitatively inverse) correlation with the intensity of CO2 molecule at gas phase suggest the active role played by the Pt-P25 interface in activating the methanol molecule. Note that the process renders CO2 as CO gas is absent at the gas phase (considering both IR and photo-catalytic results) and presumably transformed at the noble metal surface in a fast step. As previously discussed, the methanol molecule can be initially activated in the titania surface but a critical effect of platinum in producing carbon dioxide and thus producing maximum hydrogen from each methanol molecule can be envisaged from the infrared results presented. Therefore, the noble metal plays a role in activating the alcohol molecule, rendering carbon oxide(s) from carboxylate-type moieties, a fact previously not discussed at length in the literature. Note that the differences between the P25-5Pt and P25-10Pt samples are limited to the temporal evolution of the above CO and CO2-related phenomena, indicating a similar primary catalytic mechanism for producing such molecules from the activated alcohol moieties, although visible differences connected with the most efficient conversion of CO into CO2 by the most active P25-5Pt catalyst are evident in Fig. 12. In Fig. 14 we showed the photoluminescence signals obtained for our solids upon excitation with a 365nm wavelength. Titania solids are indirect band gap semiconductors and the main de-excitation radiative channels are related to defect-related electronic levels, presenting usually low intensity. Specifically, below ca. 620nm the photoluminescence of our titania P25-based samples displays the presence of two broad peaks in consonance with previous studies [51]. Multiple de-excitation transitions have been detailed for titania samples after excitation with UV light but those can be grouped into two types of transitions corresponding to high-energy (sometimes called green) and low energy (sometimes called red) de-excitation channels [74–76]. In our case the maximum is at ca. 450nm for all samples and thus green de-excitation dominates. The main point for our purposes is that all the solids present rather similar photoluminescence signal with mostly modest variations in the overall intensity of the photoluminescence study. Moreover, the signal presents a trend such as P25-75Pt<P25-5Pt<P25≈P25-2.5Pt≈P25-10Pt. This trend is not the one displayed by the efficiency in Fig. 11 and therefore the effect of the platinum in the recombination of charge seems not to be the dominant one in driving activity within our sample series. We note that the mismatch in the trends presented by the two observables concerns our series of samples presenting strong similitudes in terms of the titania support (surface) and Pt morphology characteristics. These two capital properties in driving optimum hydrogen production [2,3,5] are not relevant here to interpret the optimization of activity through our sample series. Differences among samples seem thus related on how the charge received by the platinum nanoparticles is utilized by the whole catalyst in generating chemistry. The critical role of the metal support interface is suggested by the infrared data and although it appears that all samples carried out such task within the same primary catalytic mechanism according to infrared results, a reasonable correlation is observed in the efficiency in transforming methanol-related carboxylate species into carbon dioxide and the surface activity of platinum to transform the alcohol and render hydrogen-free carbon-containing molecules. The metal-support interaction seems to play a key role for controlling/promoting the rate of the carboxylate-type to carbon dioxide conversion and thus in fasting significantly the activity with respect to the pure titania samples, maximizing the hydrogen yield of the reaction. Differences among our Pt-containing samples seem therefore related to the CO adsorption properties of the noble metal particles and, more likely, to the full oxidation of carbon monoxide to render carbon dioxide with the help of OH species in a water gas shift type step. The specific local structural/electronic properties of the interface at each sample critically affect the activity through its influence in this reaction step. In deep analysis of active OH involved in the reaction and sited at the metal-support interface is only possible by ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance) or nuclear resonance techniques of relatively difficult use under in situ, illumination conditions and out of the scope of this work. The study shows therefore that the step-way transformation of methanol (CH3OH+2h+ →CH2O+2H+; CH2O+H2O+2h+ →HCOOH+2H+; HCOOH+2h+ →CO2 +2H+; 2H+ +2e− →H2), proposed previously by several authors [20,33], has as relevant kinetic step the transformation of carboxylate-type species (in the case of our most active samples which are likely formate-type) into hydrogen-free carbon species with involvement of OH species of the support at metal-support interface sites. This confirms, on the other hand, that alternative routes such as methanol or formaldehyde photo-decomposition steps at the bare titania support sites seem to be of secondary importance to render hydrogen in our samples."
10,Conclusions,"In this work the deposition of platinum on the titania P25 surface was carried out using a chemical deposition method with the help of sodium borohydride as reducing agent under an inert atmosphere. A series of samples were thus prepared varying the metal to borohydride molar ratio. The structural and electronic characterization of the samples was able to show that the support was not affected by the metal deposition for all samples studied. Using TEM we showed that the samples have similar particle size distributions of the noble metal phase, presenting in all cases high dispersion values, above 0.84. Relatively small differences are suggested by XPS in terms of the presence of oxidized Pt for the P25-2.5Pt sample while the remaining catalysts have a dominant zero valent, metallic state. The rigorous measurement of the efficiency of the hydrogen production provides a quantitative estimation of differences among our (structurally similar) Pt-loaded samples, with an increase in quantum efficiency from ca. 1.6 to 5.6. Overall, the study shows that a neat increase by 3.5 times (or 250%) in the efficiency can be thus achieved for samples having essentially the same noble metal phase. A similar noble metal morphology justifies the relatively modest variations in the electron handling properties of the materials measured by photoluminescence which, in any case, appears to be uncorrelated with photo-activity variation through the series of samples. The IR study highlights that fine details of the noble metal interaction with the support (likely related to interface OH-type species) provide a more efficient activation of the sacrificial alcohol and this appears to be directly linked to the efficiency in the production of hydrogen. Thus, although Pt particle size, morphology, and charge handling properties are important properties in providing high activity, the present study shows that a significant increase in the true quantum efficiency can be obtained by controlling the interaction with the support and the way this affects the sacrificial agent photo-activation. The important efficiency achieved in optimum conditions, ηq =28.0%, indicates the significance of this factor for obtaining a photocatalyst providing efficient use of light (photons) to energy conversion."
