0,Introduction,"The enantioselective reduction of ketones occupies a pivotal role in the construction of chiral secondary alcohols, which are ubiquitous motifs of numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals, functional materials and chiral reagents for organic synthesis [1–3]. Among the numerous reduction methods, asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones attracted the most intensive attention due to its low-cost, cleanness and perfect atom economy, and it is capable of conducting large-scale production to give optically active products [4–12]. Since the major breakthrough made by Noyori and co-workers in 1987, chiral ruthenium–diphosphine complexes had become the primal option for asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones [13]. At present, the design of a catalyst is becoming more rational because of the deeper mechanistic understanding of high-performance catalysts in terms of enantioselectivity, turnover frequency (TOF), and turnover number (TON) [8]. In this regard, some very efficient catalysts have been devised, which not only enriched the tool kit of the hydrogenation methodology, but also showed new promise for higher efficiency for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones [6]. In addition to the dominant ruthenium complexes, other noble metals such as Os, Rh, Ir, and Pd have also been extensively explored. Recently, earth abundant metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) in asymmetric hydrogenations also come to the front [14–23]. Nowadays, asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones has become one of the most practical and straightforward methods for the preparation of chiral alcohols [5–7,24–28]. A number of elegant reviews on the topic of asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones have already been there. Some recent reviews accounted the chiral phosphorus ligand development [29–36] and mechanistic insight [37]. Others focused on the alternative metal catalyst to ruthenium for asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones [14,34,38]. Several recent papers present the state-of-art of industrial application in the related field [39,10,40–42]. In this review, we are trying to summarize the development of the asymmetric hydrogenation of multi-functionalized ketones and the solutions to some sophisticated stereochemistry control thereof."
1,The breakthrough in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized ketones,"Noyori and coauthors synthesized the first ruthenium complex with chiral BINAP ligand (L1), which realized a general and efficient enantioselective hydrogenation of β-ketoesters. In the presence of such a chiral catalyst, a wide range of β-ketoesters (1) were reduced to chiral β-hydroxyl carboxylic esters (2) under H2 (100atm) in very high enantioselectivities [13] (Scheme 1 ). In their continued research on the hydrogenation of ketone substrates using [RuX2(BINAP)] complex, they noticed that the presence of a coordinating group was indispensable for the facile hydrogenation of the neighboring carbonyl group. The general sense for the enantio induction indicated that the five- and six-membered chelating coordination of ruthenium with carbonyl oxygen and X or Y are essential for both the reactivity and enantioselectivity [43] (Scheme 2 ). β-Ketoesters, acting as a bidentate σ-donor ligand, coordinate to the (R)-BINAP–Ru complexes to form two possible diastereomers. Owing to the stereochemical requirement for better transfer of the RuH to the CO bond, these diastereomers must be sterically favored. The special backbone of chiral BINAP provides a clear bias for hydride delivery to occur via four-membered transition states. The R-alcohol-generating transition states is much more stable than the diastereomeric S-alcohol-forming structure, which suffers from severe steric repulsion between the alkyl substituent and the phenyl group of the ligand, in accord with the generally high enantioselectivities [5]. Afterward, various catalytic systems were successfully applied to a wider array of other functionalized ketones, which contain diverse directing groups such as alkoxyl, siloxyl, chloride, keto, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, carboxyl, phosphonates, and sulfonyl (Fig. 2) [44,45]."
2,The development of chiral ligands for the asymmetric hydrogenation,"Chiral complex is the hardcore for hydrogenation catalyst. Apparently, the structure (conformational, steric, and electronic properties) of the chiral ligand had a fundamental influence on the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the chiral catalyst. The substrates to be hydrogenated often have variable structures and bear multiple functional groups, which may have an unforeseeable interaction with the catalyst; therefore, there is a consistent desire for the design and synthesis of new chiral ligands for asymmetric hydrogenations [29–36] Fig. 1 . BINAP, with an axial element of chirality, is conformationally flexible and can accommodate a wide variety of transition metals by rotation about the binaphthyl C(1)C(1′) pivot and C(2 or 2′)P bonds without a serious increase of torsional strain [46]. The resulting seven-membered rings containing only sp2-hybridized carbon atoms are in turn skeletally unambiguous and are skewed largely than analogous structures containing sp3 carbons. These features provide distinct differentiation of the quadrant space sectors [47,48]. Inspired by the great success of BINAP in asymmetric hydrogenation, a series of diphosphines with an atropisomeric scaffold were developed and testified to be very active, selective and versatile ligands in this area (Fig. 3 ) [29–36]. With the advent of atropisomeric ligands, other types of ligands and catalysts had also been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction (Fig. 4 ), for example, chiral ferrocenyl phosphine ligands (L15, L16) [49–52], C2 -symmetric P-chiral phosphine ligands t-Bu-QuinoxP∗ (L18) [53], and chiral spiro tridentate pyridine–aminophosphine (SpiroPAP) ligands (L20). It is worthy of mention that Ir/SpiroPAP catalyst is extremely efficient for the hydrogenation of β-ketoesters (up to 99.9% ee, 123,000TON) [54–56]. With the chiral macrocyclic ligand L22 as ligands, iron catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of β-ketoesters was realized. The hydrogenation of ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate afforded 95% yield with 97% ee in 30h at 65°C in ethanol (S/C=50) [15]."
3,Asymmetric hydrogenation of α- or γ-substituted β-ketoesters,"In the hydrogenation of multi-functionalized ketones, the competitive coordination of the functionalities to metal catalysts are unfavorable for a higher enantioselectivity [43]. It is usually difficult to acquire very good enantioselectivity owing to the competition of the two directing groups. Antipodal configurations of the hydrogenation product would be generated through the two possible coordination modes (Path A and Path B) [47]. Particularly, the competition was fiercer when X and Y have similar coordination abilities. Therefore, the high enantioselectively hydrogenation of multi-functionalized ketones is very challenging."
4,α-Substituted β-ketoesters,"4.1 α-Substituted β-ketoesters Noyori et al. reported the pioneering work of the stereoselective hydrogenation of racemic α-substituted β-ketoester by dynamic kinetic resolution (Scheme 4 ) [57]. The efficiency and sense of the enantio- and diastereoselectivity were much dependent on the substrate structures and reaction conditions. With [RuCl(C6H6)(R)-BINAP]Cl as catalyst, racemic cyclic ketone 3 was hydrogenated with high anti diastereoselectivity, to give a 99:1 mixture of the β-hydroxyl ester (4) (92% ee) and its C-2 epimer 4′ (93% ee) quantitatively. However, using RuBr2(R)-BINAP as the catalyst, α-amide substituent in the β-ketoester (5a) directed mainly syn product with remarkable selectivity (syn/anti =99:1): protected l -threonine (6a) was obtained in 98% ee, and 1% of allothreonine (6a′) was formed (Scheme 4). They concluded that stereoselective hydrogenation involved a kinetic discrimination of rapidly equilibrating enantiomers. The absolute configuration at C-3 was governed by the configuration of the BINAP ligand while the C-2 configuration was determined by substrate structures. The remarkably high anti selection observed with 3 is rationalized in terms of the sterically constrained tricyclic transition state A. While the origin of the unique syn selection directed by an amide or related groups, they envisaged a transition state B which was stabilized by hydrogen bonding between CONH and the ester OR [57]. Genêt et al. reported simultaneously in 1989 the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-acetamido-3-oxobutyrate (5a) through dynamic kinetic resolution with Ru/CHIRAPHOS (L23) catalysts (Scheme 5 ) [58,59]. Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of β-keto-α-amino esters through DKR stands for a very powerful synthetic methodology, and hence the method had been utilized by many other groups for the synthesis of some important natural products, pharmaceuticals and biological active compounds [60–71], such as cyclic peptides [64–67], β-lactam antibiotics [68,69], and thiamphenicol [70] (Fig. 5 ). Noyori et al. also explored the asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic α-(benzamidomethyl)β-ketoester (7). The hydrogenation of methyl 2-(benzamidomethyl)-3-oxobutanoate (7a) using (R)-BINAP–Ru-catalyst in dichloromethane achieved a high syn-selectivity to give (S, R)-8a in 92% de and 99% ee which was important intermediate for the syntheses of carbapenem derivatives and other β-lactam antibiotics [57,72]. Takaya and Akutagawa et al. further investigated the factors influenced the activity and stereoselectivity by using a variety of dihalo-Ru(arene)–BINAP complexes [68]. They found that the stereochemical outcome of the reaction strongly depended on both the nature of halide counter anions of the catalyst (I− >Br− >Cl−) and the nature of the aryl substituents to the phosphorus atom. Particularly, the nature of the substituents on the phenyl rings to the phosphorus of the BINAP-type ligands had tremendous influence on the reaction. A combination of [Ru(cymene)I2]2 and (R)-3,5-t-Bu2–BINAP gave syn-8a in 99% ee and 98% de (Scheme 6 ) [67,73]. These results inspired other groups to improve the efficiency and selectivity of new catalytic systems. The catalytic properties of several ligands, such as SEGPHOS [74], BITIOP [75], and DIOPHEP [76], and the use of different counter anions [77] have been evaluated for this transformation. Our group demonstrated that [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2] associated to DTBM–SUNPHOS in DCM/TFE and DCE/TFE combination of solvent was more efficient for DKR of α-substituted β-ketoesters 7 than the corresponding [Ru(p-cymene)I2] in DCM/MeOH and DCE/MeOH [78]. Zhang et al. reported that the asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-phthalimide-3-oxobutyrate (5c) through dynamic kinetic resolution with Ru/C3-TunePhos (L8) catalysts (Scheme 7 ) [79]. When the substitution at α-position of β-ketoester was changed from acetamide group to phthalimide in which the hydrogen bonding can’t be formed as the structure B (shown in Scheme 4), the reversed stereoselectivity was observed compared with Noyori’s system [57]. Using Ru/C3-TunePhos catalyst, the allo-threonine derivative 6c was obtained in more than 99% ee and >97:3 dr [79]. Hamada et al. reported the anti-selective asymmetric hydrogenation of α-amino-β-ketoesters via DKR using α-amino-β-ketoester hydrochlorides (9) as substrates [80] (Scheme 7). Using Ru–(S)-BINAP complex under mild condition (50°C, 100atm H2), anti-β-hydroxyl-α-amino esters (10) was obtained in excellent ee. Mechanistic investigation revealed that reaction may take place via the hydrogenation of the double bond in the enol tautomer 11 of the substrate to deliver the anti-selectivity. Genêt et al. reported highly stereoselective synthesis of anti-β-hydroxyl-a-amino ester hydrochlorides (10) through the asymmetric hydrogenation of 9 by using [Ru(R)-SYNPHOS)Br2], and they applied this approach to finish an easy synthesis of the natural product sulfobacin A [81–83]. Furthermore, other transition metal catalyzed DKR of α-amino-β-ketoester (9) also were reported (Scheme 8 ) [84]. Hamada et al. reported that Ir-(S)-MeO-BIPHEP-BARF complex effectively catalyzed the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic α-amino-β-ketoester (9) to afford aromatic anti-β-hydroxyl-α-amino esters (6′) under low hydrogen pressure [85,86]. Phansavath and Ratovelomanana-Vidal et al. also reported the hydrogenation of α-amino β-ketoester hydrochlorides using the cationic binuclear iridium(III) catalysts [Ir(H)(S)-SYNPHOS]2(μ-X)3]X, which are easy to handle and shelf-stable [87]. They found that the use of [Ir(H)(S)-SYNPHOS]2(μ-I)3]I complex allowed for a higher enantiomeric ratio (81:19–94:6) and good to excellent dr (83:17–99:1). Hamada’s group also studied the hydrogenation DKR with the Rh complex and chiral ferrocenylphosphines. In the presence of stoichiometric sodium acetate, anti-β-hydroxyl-α-amino esters (6′) were obtained in 58–83% ee and good diastereomeric ratio of 92:8–97:3 [88]. Compared to Ru, Ir, and Rh, nickel has drawn much attention in homogeneous catalysis because it is much more abundant and less expensive [89,90]. However, using chiral nickel-diphosphine complexes for asymmetric hydrogenation remained a formidable challenge until rather recently, especially for ketone substrates. Hamada et al. realized successfully the asymmetric hydrogenation of α-amino-β-ketoester hydrochlorides (9) using homogeneous chiral nickel-diphosphine catalysts through DKR to generate anti-β-hydroxyl-α-amino esters (6′) with high diastereo- and enantioselectivities. In nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation, most of the commercially available chiral phosphines seem to be futile, except some JosiPhos-type ligands. In the presence of sodium acetate, the substrate was smoothly converted and the anti-β-hydroxyl-α-amino esters (6′) with exclusive diastereoselectivity (anti/syn >99:1) and good enantioselectivity (93% ee) (Scheme 8) [17,18]. The research of the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of α-alkyl-substituted acyclic β-ketoester (12) via DKR was less relative to aliphatic cyclic β-ketoester (3) and α-heteroatom-substituted acyclic β-ketoester (5, 7 and 9). Hu et al. reported Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of various α-alkyl-substituted β-aryl ketoesters (12) via DKR had been realized in high diastereo- and enantioselectivities with sterically hindered chiral ferrocenyl P,N,N-ligands L21b in which a stereogenic center was introduced at the pyridinylmethyl position (Scheme 9 ). They studied the effect of ligand structure on the hydrogenation performance by introducing the different substituent into the pyridinylmethyl position, and found that the chiral ferrocenyl P,N,N-ligand bearing 2-methyl phenyl group gave the best enantioselectivity for the hydrogenation of α-alkyl-substituted β-aryl ketoester [91]. Hydrogenation of a racemic α-substituted β-ketophosphonate (14 and 16) via DKR has also been developed. Noyori reported the (S)-BINAP–Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation of racemic α-bromo β-ketophosphonate (14a) to give (1R,2S)-β-hydroxyl phosphonate (15a) in 98% ee and 84% yield. The product was used for the synthesis of a clinically used antibiotic fosfomycin [92]. The author explained the stereochemical efficiency of the second-order stereoselective reaction based on the asymmetric induction between the catalyst and substrate as well as the kinetic parameters with the Felkin–Anh working model. The phosphonate in these substrates clearly directed the asymmetric hydrogenation through interaction with the Ru center of the catalyst. The absolute configuration of the hydroxyl-bearing C(2) stereogenic center was determined by the intermolecular asymmetric induction from the BINAP–Ru catalyst, whereas the 1,2-threo relative configuration resulted from the intramolecular asymmetric induction by the bromine-containing C(1) stereogenic carbon (Scheme 10 ). Following this report, Noyori et al. developed BINAP–Ru catalyzed hydrogenation of α-amido-β-ketophosphonates (16) with electronegative α-amido group to give α-amido-β-hydroxyl phosphonates (17) in high enantio- and diastereoselective manner (Scheme 11 ) [93]. Our group also reported the diastereo- and enantioselective hydrogenation reaction of α-amido-β-keto phosphonates (16) catalyzed by [RuCl2(benzene)]2 and (S)-SunPhos [94]. We found that additives play important roles in improving the diastereo- and enantioselectivities. In the presence of CeCl3·7H2O as the additive, the syn/anti ratio and ee's were largely increased to 99:1 and 99.8% ee, respectively (Scheme 11). Genêt and Ratovelomanana-Vidal reported the DKR of racemic α-chloro β-ketophosphonates (14b) through ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation [95]. The α-chloro β-hydroxyl-phosphonates (15b) were obtained in good to high enantio- and diastereomeric excesses using DIFLUORPHOS (Scheme 10). Hattori et al. expanded the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of α-alkyl-substituted β-ketoester (5, 12) via DKR to the asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic α-acetyl γ-lactam (18) with Ru–BINAP catalyst to obtain optically active β-hydroxy γ-lactam (19) [96]. Subsequently, researchers of Pfizer and Eli Lilly used the method for the preparation of pyrrolidine containing chiral drug, respectively (Scheme 12 ) [97–99]. Recently, Zhou et al. reported a highly efficient Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic α-acetyl γ-lactam (18). With Ir-SpiroSAP catalyst, a series of racemic β-ketolactams were hydrogenated to give chiral β-hydroxy γ-lactam (19) with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities (83–99.9% ee and syn/anti: 97:3→99:1) at low catalyst loading (TON up to 5000) (Scheme 12) [100]."
5,γ-Substituted β-ketoesters,"4.2 γ-Substituted β-ketoesters β-Ketoesters with functional groups on the γ-carbon can be subjected to hydrogenation reaction; the products are versatile chiral intermediates for further synthetic application [101]. In particular, γ-heteroatom substituted β-hydroxyl esters serve as key precursors of atorvastatin chiral side-chain, Kaneka alcohol, l-(−)-carnitine, and (R)-(−)-GABOB ((R)-γ-amino-β-hydroxyl butyric acid) (Scheme 13 ). However, the presence of additional functional groups may negatively affect the enantioselectivity of hydrogenation, due to competitive ligation to metal center [102]. The asymmetric hydrogenation of N-protected γ-amino β-ketoesters (20) catalyzed by RuBr2(BINAP) was studied firstly by Noyori et al. They found that the γ-stereogenic center in the substrates significantly affects the degree of the diastereoselectivity (Scheme 14 ). The efficiency of the catalyst control and the intramolecular 1,2-asymmetric induction from γ-stereogenic center cooperated to form the natural threo β-hydroxyl γ-amino acid derivatives (21) with high stereoselectivity. The directing effect of the ester function is of overwhelming significance in building up the β-stereogenic center [103,104]. The diastereoselective hydrogenation of N-protected γ-amino β-ketoesters provided an efficient entry to the statin series, which have been recognized as a key component of some low molecular-weight peptides such as the aspartic proterinase inhibitor, pepstatin, and dipeptide renin inhibitors. Our group reported the asymmetric hydrogenation of a variety of protected ethyl 1-(2-aminoaceto) cyclopropane carboxylates (20b) with [RuCl(SunPhos)(benzene)]Cl as catalyst (Scheme 15 ). The enantioselectivities were highly influenced by amino-protecting groups. When benzyl was used as amino-protecting group, ee of the hydrogenation was decreased to 11%. The employment of t-butoxycarbonyl group had accomplished the highest enantioselectivity (up to 98.7% ee) (Scheme 15) [105]. Furthermore, the hydrogenation product was subjected to three routine steps to give (S)-7-amino-5-azaspiro[2.4] heptane (22), which is a key intermediate for some quinolone antibacterial agents like sitafloxacin and olamufloxacin. When γ-chloro β-ketoesters (23) was hydrogenated with [RuX2(S)-BINAP], Noyori et al. found that under the conditions for β-ketoesters (room temperature, 100atm H2), the desired (R)-alcohols 24 were obtained in <70% ee. They reckoned that the poor enantio differentiation was possibly due to the competitive coordination between the ester group and chlorine atom. They solved the competitive coordination by elevating the reaction temperature. The asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxo-butanoate (23a) was accomplished with Ru(OCOCH3)2[(S)-BINAP] to give (R)-alcohol 24a in 97% ee [106]. γ-Chloro-β-hydroxyl esters serve as key precursors of natural products and pharmaceuticals [107,108], therefore, several ligands have been evaluated for the hydrogenation of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxo-butanoic ester (23a) (Scheme 16 ) [109–117]. The atropisomeric C2 -symmetric diphosphines showed high enantioselectivity for the hydrogenation of 23a, such as MeO–BIPHEP (L6) [112], SYNPHOS (L4) [113,114], (R)-Xyl–P-Phos (L10) [115], and (R,2S,3S)-Bu–PQ-Phos (L28) [116]. The regioselectivities and/or enantioselectivities in the asymmetric hydrogenation may been influenced by the dihedral angles of biaryl phosphine ligands [74,117]. Saito et al. designed SEGPHOS series ligands with small dihedral angels. The stereorecognition abilities of SEGPHOS–Ru complex catalysts in the hydrogenation of a wide variety of carbonyl compounds are superior to those observed with BINAP–Ru complex catalysts [74]. Genêt and Ratovelomanana-Vidal compared that the asymmetric hydrogenation of β-ketoesters, α-ketoesters, and α-hydroxyl ketones under the same conditions with BINAP, MeO–BIPHEP and SYNPHOS as the ligands respectively. They found that the highest values of ee were always obtained with SYNPHOS ligand which has the lowest dihedral angle, and explained that the smaller the dihedral angle results in the higher the interaction between the bulky equatorial phenyl group of ligand and the substrates [114]. Then they reported the synthesis of DIFLUORPHOS (L7) which had a narrow dihedral angle and electron-withdrawing substituents and they performed high catalytic activity for the asymmetric hydrogenation of fluorinated β-ketoesters and chloroacetoacetate (23a) [118,119]. Based on the similar design notion, our group synthesized a new diphosphine ligand, SunPhos [120]. We introduced the germinal substituted groups (dimethyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl) onto the SegPhos scaffold so that the dihedral angles along the C2 -axial (C1–C2–C3–C4) and (C1–C2–C5–C6, Fig. 3) could be adjusted but the coordination environment remained. SunPhos performed high catalytic activity for the asymmetric hydrogenation of simple β-ketoesters and chloroacetoacetate (23a) [120]. Gong et al. reported the synthesis of 7,7′-disubstituted BINAPs (L29) and exemplified the catalytic potential of this class of ligands in Ru-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation [121]. In addition, BINOL-derived phosphinite ligands, Ph-o-Xylyl-BINAPO (L30), allows for the Ru catalyzed hydrogenation of 23a with high enantioselectivity [122]. Imamoto et al. reported the synthesis of C 2-symmetric P-chiral phosphine ligands, t-Bu-QuinoxP∗ (L16), which exhibited good to excellent asymmetric induction in Ru-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones [53]. On the basis of the existing report, the presence of substituent with oxygen atom in β-ketoesters also was found to influence the enantioselective of the hydrogenation (Scheme 17 ). Ethyl 5-(benzyloxy)-3-oxopentanoate (25a) was hydrogenated in 98% ee with RuBr2[(S)-BINAP] as catalyst, whereas the reaction of the lower homolog, ethyl 4-(benzyloxy)-3-oxobutanoate (25b), exhibited only 78% ee. When the steric hindrance of protected group of oxygen atom was increased, the enantiomer ratio was increased to 97.4:2.6 in the case of triisopropylsilyl group protected 25c as substrate [43]. In a similar way of asymmetric hydrogenation of γ-chloro β-ketoesters (23), elevating the hydrogenation temperature also can solve the competitive coordination of oxygen atom. Beck and Jendralla reported the asymmetric hydrogenation of ethyl γ-benzyloxyl acetoacetate (25b) with an in situ prepared catalyst by heating RuCl2(C6H6) and (R)-BINAP in DMF. The hydrogenation proceeded at 100°C under only 4atm of hydrogen with a ratio of S/C =1500–2000 at a 10kg scale to give the product in 97% ee and 96% yield [123]. Ratovelomanana-Vidal and Genêt et al. reported the hydrogenation of ethyl 4-benzyloxyl acetoacetate (25b) with RuBr2(R)-MeO–BIPHEP as catalyst at 80°C, quantitative yield and 96% ee with S/C up to 4000 [124]. The catalytic activity of i-Pr–BPE (L31) [125], Bip∗ (L32) [126] and dendritic diphosphine L33 [127] were also evaluated for this transformation (Scheme 18 ). The electron-rich diphosphine L31 allow the hydrogenation of γ-benzyloxyl acetoacetate (25b) to obtain 26b in 99% ee under mild conditions [125]. The asymmetric hydrogenation of γ-alkoxyl acetoacetate was used in the synthesis of mevinolin analogs [123], and the natural products such as apoptolidin [128,129], (−)-isoavenaciolide [130] and liposidomycins [131]. Our group carried out a systematic study on the effect of these different heteroatoms (Scheme 19 ) [132]. For all of the substrates except the one with a sulfide substitution 27a, the interference of the heteroatoms was not problematic in achieving high enantioselectivities. Once the sulfide in 27a was oxidized to sulfone 27b, the ee of 28b was increased from 65% to 97%, suggesting that the competitive coordination of the sulfur atom was largely subdued. The hydrogenation of ethyl 4-cyano-3-oxobutanoate (X=CN, 27h) had also been tried considering that the chiral 28h was a very useful chiral intermediate [133,134]. However, this substrate showed no reactivity at all. We had later demonstrated that α-cyano esters were an inhibitor of the catalyst. Enantiomerically enriched ethyl 4-arylsulfonyl-3-hydroxybutyrates (28b–28d) were achieved for the first time through asymmetric hydrogenation. Using [RuCl(p-cymene)(S)-SunPhos]Cl as catalyst, these hydrogenation reactions can be carried out with low catalyst loading (up to 5000 S/C) with uncompromised enantioselectivity [135]."
6,δ-Ketal-β-ketoesters,"4.3 δ-Ketal-β-ketoesters The catalytic enantioselective hydrogenation of δ-ketal-β-ketoesters would provide an economically and ecologically benign avenue to a series of statins. Tararov and Börner et al. first investigated the stereochemistry of the catalytic hydrogenation of δ-ketal-β-ketoesters to ethyl (5S)-5,6-(isopropylidenedioxy)-3-hydrohyhexanoate (syn- 29 and anti-29) using a number of chiral Rh(I) and Ru(II) complexes with phosphine ligands [136]. They found that the hydrogenation catalyzed by commercially available Ru[(R)-BINAP]Cl2 afforded a complex mixture of the desired syn alcohol and the rearranged product. They explained that the acidic properties of catalyst led to the byproduct. So several organic bases (Et3N, BnNH2, imidazole, piperazine) and AcONa were screened to neutralize the acidity of catalyst. Best results were obtained with Ru[(R)-Tol–BINAP]Cl2·AcONa as a catalyst in EtOH. At 50°C, under 100bar of H2 and 0.1mol% catalyst loading, it gave the desired syn alcohol in 99% de and ca. 98% chemical purity (Scheme 20 ) [137]. The highly enantioselective hydrogenation can be carried out in the presence of Ru[(R)-BINAP)]Cl2 at room temperature, affording the corresponding β-functionalized β-hydroxyl ester (R)-30b in 98.7% ee, and TONs up to 20,000. The resulting chiral ethyl (R)-3-hydroxy-5,5-dimethoxypentanoate [(R)-30b] can be converted to the chiral side chain of statins (Scheme 20) [136]. Our group reported the asymmetric hydrogenation of several δ-ketal-β-ketoesters (31) with Ru(Sunphos)(benzene)Cl]Cl as the catalyst to give the chiral hydroxyl products 32 in excellent ee’s (Scheme 21 ). It was worth mentioning that CaCO3 was an indispensable additive to stabilize the ketal group. CaCO3 is a week inorganic base, which traps HCl that formed in the reaction. However, the other basic additives like Na2CO3 or Et3N precluded the hydrogenation of 31. The products 32 could be de-protected and used for further transformations [138]."
7,"Asymmetric hydrogenation of γ,δ-unsaturated-β-ketoesters","The chemoselective hydrogenation of the CO over CC bonds in α,β-unsaturated ketones is one of the most outstanding contributions from Noyori [139]. Using chiral Ru–BINAP–diamine complexes under basic conditions, chiral allyl alcohols could be obtained in very decent yields and ee. γ,δ-Unsaturated-β-ketoesters (33) have both α,β-enone subunit and β-ketoester structure. Genêt et al. reported that the asymmetric hydrogenation of (E)-methyl-3-oxooct-5-enoate (33a) with [RuBr2(S-BIPHEMP)(L5)] as catalyst (Scheme 22 ). When the alkenyl group was not conjugated to carbonyl of β-ketoesters, the reaction was highly enantio- and chemoselective, and the yield was quantitative [140]. Georg et al. attempted to synthesize the chiral β-hydroxyl γ-enoates (34), an important building blocks for the total synthesis of the epothilones, by Ru-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation [141]. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the hydrogenation offered the corresponding β-hydroxyl γ-enoates (34b) in 50% yield with 82% ee at room temperature for 2h; longer reaction time and higher temperature yielded over-reduced products. They also investigated the hydrogenation of γ,δ-unsaturated-β-ketoesters in which the thiazole moiety was replaced by a phenyl ring. The corresponding β-hydroxyl γ-enoates (34c and 34d) was given in 86–89% yield with 89–94% ee (Scheme 23 ). The results indicated that the presence of the thiazole moiety promoted the reduction of the enone double bond and was responsible for lowering the enantiomeric excess of the reaction. Our group tried to hydrogenate the γ,δ-unsaturated-β-ketoesters (33) by using [Ru(SunPhos)(benzene)Cl]Cl as the catalyst. After 2h, we observed both the allyl alcohol product 34 and over-hydrogenated 35 (Scheme 24 ) [135]. Obviously, it was still very difficult to avoid the hydrogenation of the conjugated CC bonds. The bulkiness of ortho-substitution may favor a higher ratio of 34f to 35f, therefore we investigated the hydrogenation of 33g, hoping that the more hindered CC bond could be retained. After optimizations, 21.3 grams of 33g was successfully hydrogenated to 34g in excellent ee (>99%) and yields (>95%) with a TON up to 10,000 (Scheme 24) [135]. The enantiomerically pure 34g provided a new chiral starting material for the synthesis of pitavastatin calcium, which is widely used for blood cholesterol lowering medication. Our group also introduced a γ-halo heteroatom into γ,δ-unsaturated β-ketoesters provided the trisubstituted alkenes, which may reduce the possibility of the olefin reduction, and the vinyl halide moiety could undergo further transformations by organometallic methods [141,142]. With [RuCl(benzene)(S)-SunPhos]Cl as the catalyst, a variety of (Z)-methyl 4-chloro-3-oxo-5-arylpent-4-enoates (36) were hydrogenated to give exclusively the carbonyl reduction product with good enantioselectivities under mild condition (70°C, 10bar H2). Both the conjugated CC double bonds and adjacent vinyl halogens remained untouched (Scheme 25 ) [143]. The bromine atoms in the allyl alcohol products could be removed by using PdCl2(dppf)/HCOONa or employed as chiral alkenyl electrophile for cross-coupling reactions [143]."
8,Chemo- and enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones with multiple carbonyl groups,"As mentioned above, it is usually difficult to acquire very good enantioselectivities in multi-functionalized ketones owing to the competition of the two directing groups. Increasing in temperatures or changing in the bulkiness or electronic properties of the directing groups was the main mean to enlarge the energy gap between the two reaction pathways. However, these methods were still invalid in the presence of very close directing groups (X and Y are both esters, Scheme 3). For example, the asymmetric hydrogenation of 3,5-dioxo esters. This kind of compounds involved partial structure of both β-diketones and β-ketoesters, two kinds of functionalized carbonyl compounds that are efficiently hydrogenated by chiral ruthenium catalyst. Therefore, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction was expected not to be simple [135]."
9,Early attempts,"6.1 Early attempts Saburi et al. firstly examined the hydrogenation of 3,5-dioxoester (38) with RuCl2[(S)- or (R)-BINAP]2·NEt3 as the catalyst precursor, giving dominantly anti-3,5-dihydroxyesters (39) with the ratio of anti:syn from 82:20 to 51:49. Their results showed that the hydrogenation proceeded dominantly via β-diketone mode and the C-3 carbonyl groups was selectively hydrogenated to give (S)-3 hydroxy-5-oxoesters (40) (Schemes 26 and 27 ). The C-5 carbonyl group was subsequently hydrogenated to afford the anti-dihydroxyl ester, similarly to the hydrogenation of β-diketones (Scheme 27) [144]. Carpentier et al. reinvestigated the asymmetric hydrogenation of methyl dioxohexanoate (38) into mixtures of 3,5-dihydroxyesters (39) and 3-hydroxylactones (41) with a variety of ruthenium catalysts [145]. When dichloromethane was used as solvent, Ru-(S)-MeO–BIPHEP gave predominantly (3R,5S)-anti-39a in up to 78% de and 95% ee, affording an efficient synthesis of (S)-6-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2-pyrone (42a) in up to 95% ee. On the contrary, some Ru–(amidophosphane phosphinite) complexes sluggishly catalyzed the reaction of syn-39a′ in up to 92% de but with poor ee. Furthermore, methyl (R)-3-hydroxy-5-oxohexanoate (40a), was the exclusive primary hydrogenation product with RuBr2[(S)-Tol-BINAP] as the catalyst, which can be isolated in high yields but with moderate ee (Scheme 28 ). Kiegiel et al. examined the asymmetric hydrogenation of 3,5-dioxoheptanediester (43) with ruthenium catalysts. They found that the hydrogenation of methyl 3,5-dioxoheptane diester (43a) and t-butyl ester (43b) was unsatisfactory due to significant formation of the meso-diols and only modest ees were achieved, while the non-racemic diimide 43c was hydrogenated by (S)-Ru–BINAP to give diol 44c in high yield (92%) and high diastereomeric excess (96% de). When (R)-BINAP catalyst was used, the face selectivity was reversed, but the (3R, 5R) equivalent of 44c′ was obtained in only 78% de. This result suggests that the chiral auxiliary played an important, but not a crucial, role in the asymmetric induction (Scheme 29 ) [146]."
10,Comparison of the hydrogenation rates of simple β-ketoacid derivatives,"6.2 Comparison of the hydrogenation rates of simple β-ketoacid derivatives It is obvious that the competition in the multi-functionalized ketone substrates was fiercer when X and Y have similar coordination abilities. High ees are expected only if one of them dominated in the directing effect. Therefore, a comparison of the hydrogenation rates of simple β-ketoacid derivatives would help to find out their coordination priorities to the ruthenium catalyst. Brückner et al. [147,148] reported that β-ketocarboxylic acid derivatives with more electron-rich C(O)NR2 moieties had a faster onset hydrogenation rate than those with ester by studying their rate differences in alcohols with [RuCl2(S)-BINAP]·NEt3 under relatively mild conditions (4bar of H2, ambient temperature). This substituent-dependence made it possible to hydrogenate β-keto(pyrrolidides) very enantioselectively while β-ketoesters stayed untouched initially but reacted subsequently. The hydrogenation of a mixture of three β-ketocarboxylic acid derivatives carried out selectively one by one (Scheme 30 ). In these competitions a typical “first-choice substrate” delivered product from early on while the “second-choice substrate” was unaffected unless the “first-choice substrate” had disappeared. This switch from an initially inert mode to a reactive mode means that for these asymmetric hydrogenations, selectivity and reactivity are determined in different steps. Substrate selection, in one or more steps, provides an intermediate, which may form reversibly or irreversibly, but must be more stable than the reactants. This intermediate proceeds toward the hydrogenated product through the rate-determining step. As soon as the latter materializes, its rate is independent from whether the substrate under consideration was “first” or “second” choice [147,148]. Our group also reckoned that a comparison of the hydrogenation rates of simple β-ketoacid derivatives would help to find out their coordination priorities to the ruthenium catalyst [149]. When the achiral Ru-SunPhos catalyst was used, in EtOH, β-ketoamides were found to be hydrogenated slightly faster than β-ketoesters, but the difference was not very distinct (Scheme 31 ). Surprisingly, the β-ketoamides (45c and 45f) were found to be inactive toward hydrogenation in EtOH. Further examination disclosed the unusual alcoholysis of 45c and 45f, which disturbed the rate comparison experiments. In order to avoid alcoholysis of the β-ketoamides, we made a rather arbitrary choice to use THF as solvent since it had been reported frequently that EtOH and MeOH were the best solvent for Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of β-ketoacid derivatives [149–152]. Indeed, the β-ketoesters (1h–k) underwent no conversion in THF at 70°C for prolonged reaction time. The β-ketoamides (45b–h) could be hydrogenated smoothly in THF under the same reaction conditions. We performed an asymmetric version of the reaction and excellent enantioselectivities were observed for these β-ketoamides in THF. For the first time, highly enantiomerically pure 46c and 46f were prepared through asymmetric hydrogenations, which provided very useful chiral blocks for total synthesis."
11,3-Oxo-glutaric acid derivatives,"6.3 3-Oxo-glutaric acid derivatives Upon these results, our group investigated the enantioselective hydrogenation of 3-oxo-glutaric acid derivatives (47) in the different solvents (Table 1 ) [149]. For most examples in Table 1, higher ees were observed in THF than in EtOH. Overall, acetone was found to be an even better solvent than THF, especially for 47e and 47j. The absolute configuration of 48f was determined to be R by X-ray crystallography, which validated our proposal that the amide carbonyl was the dominant directing group during the hydrogenation reaction. The bis(β-ketoacid) derivatives within one molecule 49 could be selectively hydrogenated in 98% ee in THF, and the ketone groups on the esters side remained untouched [149] (Scheme 32 )."
12,"β,δ-Dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives","6.4 β,δ-Dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives THF was found to be a crucial for the hydrogenation of 3-oxoglutaric acid derivatives, so the hydrogenation of β,δ-dioxoesters (38) was examined in THF. Unprecedented good chemoselectivities were obtained but the ees were very low (Scheme 33 ) [135]. Based on the previous report, we noticed β-diketones and β-ketoesters had the similar reaction activity in Ru-diphosphine catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations [149,153]. We had also discovered a big reactivity difference between β-ketoesters and β-ketoamides (Scheme 31) [149,152]. We surmised that when β,δ-dioxo amides (51) were hydrogenated in THF, the β-ketoamide unit (1,3-dicarbonyl) would preferentially coordinate to the Ru-catalyst (Mode A) whereby the enantioinduction led to the formation of 52. The mode B would be less favored judging from the observation that 1,3-pentanedione shows no hydrogenation reactivity under the same conditions as β-ketoamides (Scheme 34 ). The above assumption was confirmed by the high chemo- and enantioselective hydrogenation of a wide scope of β,δ-dioxoamides (Scheme 35 ) [154]. Screenings of amides moiety showed that the ee’s tertiary amides were higher than the second amides. However, we were unable to isolate the hydrogenation product of 3,5-dioxo-N-phenylhexanamide (51f) under the same conditions. Substrates with a longer alkyl chains led to somewhat lower ees (52b vs. 52h–i). Bulkier substituents like tert-butyl and cyclohexyl further impaired the enantioselectivities, the ees of 52j and 52k were only 92% and 88%, respectively. Trisubstituted conjugate olefin 51l was also tolerated under the hydrogenation conditions. Intriguingly, the introduction of an ortho-methoxyl group in 51o, which might participate in the coordination in some degree, decreased the ee from 96% to 81%. Heteroaryl substrate with a furan ring 51t was hydrogenated to 52t in 97% ee with an S configuration, which supported our conjecture in Scheme 34. Unfortunately, the pyridinyl substrates 51u–v were totally inactive. The vicinal heteroatoms had some side effect of the hydrogenation. For example, 51w afforded 52w with only 25% conversion and 69% ee under the same conditions. The substrate with a conjugated CC to the δ-carbonyl 52x was quite unstable in the hydrogenation reaction [154]. THF was quite essential for both the chemo- and enantioselectivities in the above hydrogenation reactions. For example, when 51b was hydrogenated in MeOH under the same conditions, both β- and δ-carbonyls were hydrogenated after 3h. At the 15% conversion (5h) of 51c, β-hydrogenation product 52c could be isolated, but the ee was only 64%. Hydrogenation of 51s in DCM, acetone, i PrOH, and dioxane gave only double hydrogenation products [154]."
13,"β,δ-Dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives with the gem-disubstituted groups","6.5 β,δ-Dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives with the gem-disubstituted groups Danishefsky et al. [155] discovered that the nature of the substrate played a significant role in chemo- and stereoselectivities of the hydrogenation of β,δ-dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives. The selective asymmetric reduction of the C3 ketone of β,δ-diketoester (53) was the key issue for the completion of the synthesis of epothilones [156–158]. The choice of a suitable reduction method was crucial to obtain a high diastereoselectivity and chemoselectivity. Selective asymmetric hydrogenation of the C3 ketone without concomitant reduction of the ketone at C5 would be imperative. The hydrogenation of β,δ-diketoester (53) with [RuCl2((R)-BINAP)]2·[NEt3] afforded the desired diol 54 with excellent diastereoselectivity (>95:5, no minor diastereomer observed by 1H NMR) (Scheme 36 ). Moreover, the carbonyl group at C5 was never reduced but was necessary for the reduction of the C3-carbonyl. Author attributed this result to the presence of the gem-dimethyl functionality bridging the adjoining carbonyl groups. Our group studied the asymmetric hydrogenation of β,δ-dioxocarboxylic acid derivatives (55) with the gem-disubstituted groups. The hydrogenation of various substituted 3-oxo-glutaric acid derivatives revealed an incredible substitution and solvent effect (Scheme 37 ) [149,152]. Even with the same skeleton of 55d–h, the different substituents had inexplicable influence on the reactivity and enantioselectivities. Specifically, the diethyl substituted 55e could not be converted in EtOH even under harsher conditions. More surprisingly, unusual chiral reversion with solvent was observed for 55b and 55c. In mixed solvent of EtOH and THF (V/V=8/1), the ee of 56b was 27% (between 12% and 88%), while the ee of 56c was higher than in a single solvent. Until now, these solvent effects are still beyond our understandings. However, on the other side, we may use different solvents to modify the enantioselectivities for the hydrogenation of more functionalized ketones. Breit et al. applied the asymmetric hydrogenation of 3-oxoglutaric acid derivative (55) and β,δ-diketoester (38) with the gem-disubstituted groups in the total synthesis of the epothilones D (Scheme 38 ). After optimization of the reaction conditions (75°C, EtOH, 5.0mol% of [RuCl(S-BINAP)cymene]Cl), the hydrogenation of 3-oxoglutaric Weinreb amides (55i) furnished the desired β-hydroxyl ester both in 99% yield and 92% ee. In the hydrogenation of β,δ-diketoester (38g), the reaction temperature was found to be crucial for the outcome of this process in terms of obtained yields and enantioselectivities. The hydrogenation of β,δ-diketoester (38g) worked well at lower temperatures (10°C) with (S)-BINAP as the privileged ligand to afford the desired product 40g in both high yield (99%) and decent enantioselectivity (86% ee). After deprotection of the tert-butyl ester, the enantioselectivity could be easily enriched by recrystallization of the β-hydroxyl acid [159]."
14,Summary and outlook,"In this review, we have demonstrated the development of asymmetric hydrogenation for multi-functionalized ketones. Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of multi-functionalized ketones provides effective and powerful synthetic method for secondary alcohols with other functionalities. Even though the enantioselective hydrogenation of simple ketones and many mono-functionalized ketones has been resolved by Noyori’s ruthenium system thirty years ago, there remain many challenges in this field. In the hydrogenation reaction, the competitive ligation of the functionalities to central metal catalysts tends to decrease the enantioselectivities. An increase in temperatures or a change in bulkiness or electronic properties of the directing groups was the main means to enlarge the energy gap between the two reaction pathways. The simultaneous control of chemo- and enantioselectivities in the hydrogenation of several multi-functionalized carbonyl substrates was realized by using THF as a nonconventional solvent and as a weak coordinating ligand. This progress that has been made toward the homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of multi-functionalized ketones that can be possibly utilized in the industrial processes of the synthesis of a key intermediate for pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of complex natural compounds. In spite of this, we are aware that our achievement does not fully meet the demands of industrial application in terms of catalytic activity (TON and TOF), enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity; we are still intrigued by a battery of unfathomed questions during our studies. What are the roles of the additives and solvents in the reversal of the enantio induction? Why do some substituents have so huge influence on the reactivity and ee’s? How to make sure whether the multiple carbonyls were hydrogenated through their enol forms or not? Why was THF so special for the hydrogenation of the dicarbonyl substrates? The answers definitely underlie the nature of how the catalyst conferred the good chemo- and enantioselectivities to these ketone substrates."
