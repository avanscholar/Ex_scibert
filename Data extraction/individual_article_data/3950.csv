0,Introduction,"Over the past few decades, the excessive combustion of fossil fuels has rapidly increase the concentration of CO2 to the atmosphere, leading to serious environmental concerns, such as global warming and sea level rise [1,2]. CO2 capture and conversion to various liquid or gaseous products has been proposed as a potential and feasible method to maintain a carbon balance when combined with renewable energy sources, which can effectively address these issues [3,4]. To achieve this goal, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been explored as a simple and efficient technical solution to mitigate atmospheric CO2 through utilizing renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy [5,6]. Unfortunately, CO2 is a stable molecule and is difficult to reduce to organic fuels [7]. This has encouraged us to design some efficient catalysts, which should ideally possess excellent faradaic efficiencies (FEs), sufficiently low overpotentials and high selectivities. In the present decades, a wide range of materials, including transition metals, [8,9] transition metal oxides, [10,11] metal complexes, [12–14] metal alloys [15,16] and heteroatomic carbon materials [17,18] have been investigated for the electroreduction of CO2. Compared with other materials, carbon materials, due to their high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity and flexible/easily modified structure, are promising and desirable materials for CO2 electroreduction. Graphene-based carbon materials, especially nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), due to their low-cost, high surface areas and significant electrocatalytic activity, are worthy electrode choices, which are being rapidly researched for energy and environment applications [19,20]. Recently, Wu et al. [21] noted that an N-doped three-dimensional graphene foam requires negligible onset overpotential (−0.19 V) for CO2 reduction to CO, and it exhibits superior activity over Au and Ag, achieving a similar maximum FE for CO production (∼85%) at a lower overpotential (−0.47 V). Ensafi et al. [22] used a Pt@nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide for the direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to methanol at an applied potential of −0.30 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and a pH equal to 2.0 with a high FE (41%) that operates in water and at ambient temperature and pressure. This has inspired us to explore new NG-based catalysts with high catalytic activity and high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO2. Copper, as a distinguished and low-cost metal catalyst in the field of the electrochemical reduction of CO2, can convert CO2 into hydrocarbons in aqueous solution [23]. Achieving high efficiency in the Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction process requires Cu catalysts with sufficient active sites [24]. Numerous efforts have been made to develop Cu electrodes with splendid electrocatalytic ability for CO2 reduction. For example, copper electrodes, fabricated using a pulse electrodeposition method, exhibited a high FE of 85% at an applied potential of −2.8 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and enhanced partial current density (J, 38 mA/cm2) for methane [25]. Jaramillo’s group reported that copper as an electrocatalyst has the unique ability to produce a total of 16 different CO2 reduction products across a range of potentials in the CO2 electroreduction process [26]. Additionally, Yang’s group conducted investigations on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to methane with improved performance on ultrathin 5-fold twinned Cu nanowires [27]. Moreover, TiO2, due to its peculiar chemical and physical behaviors, [28,29] has been widely investigated in recent years for versatile applications including photocatalysis for hydrogen production [30], solar cells [31], sensors [32], self-cleaning [33] and drug delivery [34]. Nevertheless, considerably fewer reports have been focused on the use of TiO2 as a co-catalyst or support material in the electroreduction of CO2 [35]. Notably, TiO2 can act as a redox electron carrier to facilitate various reduction reactions, including CO2 conversion [36]. Additionally, the TiO2 surface has been reported to assist in CO2 adsorption, where it may stabilize CO2 reduction intermediates and also be capable to reduce the overpotential [37]. We previously reported various Cu electrocatalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Cu/TiO2) for the electroreduction of CO2 with reasonable FEs for ethanol [38]. In the present work, a Cu/TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) modified NG substrate was synthesized and used as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to alcohols in aqueous media. With this system, we measured different CO2 reduction products by controlling the potential over a wide range on the same Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst. The catalyst displayed incomparable performance with a low overpotential of 0.12 V for the production of methanol and a maximum FE of 19.5% at a potential of −0.20 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). And the catalyst is capable of producing ethanol with a high FE up to 43.6% at an overpotential of 0.84 V. In addition, the Cu/TiO2/NG composite had superior stability with a high efficiency retained for 20 h in the electrochemical process."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, sodium citrate, hydrazine hydrate and TiO2 (AR grade) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (SCR) with 99% purity. NG was provided by Beijing HWRK Chem Co., Ltd (3.0–5.0 wt%). Carbon paper (CP, HCP010) was purchased from Shanghai Hesen Electrical Co. All the chemicals were used without further purification."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization Crystal-phase X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an Ultima IV X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5406 Å). Microstructure and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were analyzed using Hitachi S-4800 field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (EDX, Oxford; UK). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) patterns were recorded by TECNAI G2F30 Transmission Electron Microscope. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab 250Xi using 200 W monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The 500 μm X-ray spot was used. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10−10 mbar. Typically, the hydrocarbon C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon was used for energy referencing. All the electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI 660C electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd)."
4,Materials synthesis,"2.3 Materials synthesis In our work, we used a simple, inexpensive and novel procedure to synthesize a series of graphene-based materials. As an example, Cu/TiO2/NG was synthesized by the following procedure: 10 mg of NG was first dispersed into 60 mL of deionized water by sonication to yield a homogeneous NG suspension. Then, 3.57 mg of TiO2 was added into the turbid solution, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min. Then, 5.73 mg of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was poured in the above solution. To stabilize Cu2+, sodium citrate was added. Hydrazine hydrate was also dropwise added at room temperature to reduce Cu2+. After stirring the solution gently overnight, it was undergone those process: centrifuged, washed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 4 h. Moreover, Cu/NG and TiO2/NG were prepared using the same process, except for the absence of TiO2 or Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in the solution, respectively."
5,Electrochemical study,"2.4 Electrochemical study To prepare the Cu/TiO2/NG/CP electrode, 2 mg of the above prepared Cu/TiO2/NG was suspended in 40 μL of deionized water with 20 μL of a Nafion®117 dispersion (5 wt%) to form a homogeneous ink assisted by ultrasonication. Then, the ink was spread onto the CP surface by a micropipette and then dried under room temperature. The loading of the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst was 1.0 mg/cm2. Electrolysis experiments were conducted at 25 °C in a gas diffusion electrode cell, which consisted of a cathode (the Cu/TiO2/NG/CP electrode mainly involved in CO2 reduction and the hydrogen evolution reaction), an anode (platinum plate auxiliary electrode, inducing water oxidation), and an SCE as the reference electrode. In the experiments, the cathodic and anodic compartments were separated using a Nafion® 117 proton exchange membrane. A 0.2 M KI aqueous solution, as the electrolyte, was used in the cathode and anode compartments, respectively. Under continuous stirring, CO2 was bubbled through the catholyte for 20 min before electrolysis. Then, potentiostatic electrochemical reduction of CO2 was continuously carried out with CO2 bubbling. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out in a single compartment cell with a three-electrode configuration, which consisted of the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst coated onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode as the working electrode, a platinum gauze auxiliary electrode, and an SCE reference electrode. The electrolyte was bubbled with N2 or CO2 for at least 30 min to form a N2- or CO2- saturated solution. The LSV measurements in gas-saturated electrolyte were conducted in 0.2 M KI solution at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. J was normalized to electrochemically active surface area (EASA, see supporting information for details). The potential, measured against the SCE electrode, was converted to the potential versus RHE according to the equation: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.059 × pH + 0.241."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Liquid phase products were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy recorded on an Ascend 400 (400 MHz, Bruker, Germany) spectrometer in D2O with Me4Si as an internal standard."
7,Results and discussion,"The structural characterizations of Cu/TiO2/NG, Cu/NG, TiO2/NG and NG were performed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1 A. As seen in the XRD patterns of the four different composites, diffraction peaks at 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° are ascribed to Cu (111), (200) and (220) reflections, respectively, which are represented by dashed lines. The typical diffraction peaks of TiO2 are expressed by solid lines. The diffraction peaks of C for graphene (denoted by dashed dotted lines) are not observed in the XRD pattern of Cu/TiO2/NG, which is possibly due to the high peak intensities of the other crystalline components relative to those of graphene in the resulting composite. In addition, no peaks from other phases are detected, indicating that the composites are of high purity. EDX analysis of Cu/TiO2/NG also supports this finding (Fig. S1). XPS characterization was further measured to obtain more information on the surface electronic states of the Cu/TiO2/NG composites, as shown in Fig. S2d. The XPS spectrum of the Cu/TiO2/NG composite consists of five peaks for carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, titanium and copper. The N1s XPS spectrum of Cu/TiO2/NG represents an N doping density of 4.28 ± 0.5% atomic. The high-resolution N1s spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1B, deconvolutes four main nitrogen species [39], that is, pyridinic N (B.E. 398.9 eV), pyrrolic N (B.E. 400.1 eV), graphitic N (B.E. 401.2 eV), and N-oxide (B.E. 402.2 eV), of which the proportions are 53.5%, 17.7%, 19.1% and 9.7%, respectively, as shown in the schematic (Fig. S3). Furthermore, the C1s peak was fully analyzed (Fig. S4), which agrees with earlier findings for this material. In addition, NG, Cu/NG and TiO2/NG were also investigated by XPS, as shown in Fig. S2a–c, showing that each material possesses corresponding elemental peaks. To obtain detailed information on the morphology, SEM and TEM were used. As revealed from Fig. S5a and b, NG, as supporter, shows flexible, translucent graphene sheets with a wrinkled texture. TiO2 nanoblocks were first deposited on the surfaces of NG to form TiO2/NG, and then, Cu NPs were reduced on the TiO2/NG surface forming Cu/TiO2/NG. As seen from Fig. 1C, the SEM investigation reveals that vast Cu NPs with diameters of 8 ± 4 nm are coated on TiO2, which are scattered and anchored onto the graphene framework, allowing an increased exposure of Cu NPs as active sites for the electroreduction of CO2 (Figs. 1C and S5g–h). TEM characterization further confirmed the scattered distribution of Cu NPs on TiO2 or sheet-like graphene (Figs. 1D and S6d). Such a special construction structure of Cu on TiO2 NPs within graphene layers will enhance their interaction and improve the performance of the catalyst for CO2 reduction, as described in detail in the following text. In contrast to Cu/TiO2/NG, pure NG, Cu/NG and TiO2/NG were also characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Figs. S5 and S6. It can be clearly seen that Cu or TiO2 NPs are decorated on the surface of the graphene sheets and enwrapped by the graphene layers. Moreover, in the absence of TiO2, Cu NPs accumulated into larger particles (Figs. S5c,d and S6b), suggesting TiO2 can create and stabilize small and well-dispersed Cu nanoparticles, which allows more active sites-Cu nanoparticles for CO2 reduction. LSV curves were measured to characterize the electrocatalytic performance of Cu/TiO2/NG for CO2 reduction in 0.2 M KI solution. The catalytic activities of NG, Cu/NG, TiO2/NG and Cu/TiO2/NG were compared, as shown in Fig. 2 . Only a monotonous increase of J was obtained under N2 atmosphere. An obvious reduction peak at −0.17 V vs. RHE was observed on Cu/TiO2/NG under CO2 atmosphere, which is more positive than that on Cu/NG (−0.37 V vs. RHE), indicating that the existence of TiO2 in Cu/TiO2/NG may be more favorable to promoting CO2 electroreduction in the CO2 electroreduction process. However, in the absence of Cu, the LSV curves on TiO2/NG and NG demonstrate much more negative onset potentials of hydrogen evolution in CO2-saturated 0.2 M aqueous KI solution, which indicates that Cu is an effective catalyst toward the reduction reactions observed here. Interestingly, the incorporation of TiO2 into the Cu/NG system results in a lower overpotential and higher J under either N2 or CO2 atmosphere. Although pristine TiO2 is not reactive with CO2, which is likely due to the difficulty of the angular CO2 radical coming in contact with the regular TiO2 structure, [40] it can act as a redox electron carrier to facilitate CO2 conversion and assist in CO2 adsorption, [36] thus it may be able to stabilize the CO2 − intermediate and also reduce the overpotential [37]. Notably, the electrochemistry of Cu/TiO2/NG purged with N2 in 0.2 M KI solution (pH = 6.62) does not show a reduction peak (Fig. 2D, black curve). In contrast, a reduction wave at −0.12 V vs. RHE is observed for the 0.2 M KI solution under N2 atmosphere in the presence of H2SO4 (pH = 5.17) (Fig. 2D, blue curve), which is ascribed to the electroreduction of pyridine (Py) combined with H+ to form a PyH intermediate on the surface of Cu/TiO2/NG, as confirmed by previous literatures [41–43]. When the solution is saturated with CO2, a reduction wave corresponding to CO2 reduction at −0.17 V vs. RHE is observed and is characterized by a considerably higher J (Fig. 2D, red curve). Moreover, a slight reduction peak at approximately −0.75 V vs. RHE was discovered on the Cu/TiO2/NG surface under CO2 atmosphere. These results suggest that Cu/TiO2/NG has high activity for the electroreduction of CO2. To obtain insight into the catalytic ability of the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst, potentiostatic electrolysis was conducted on Cu/TiO2/NG in CO2-saturated 0.2 M KI solution at the peak potentials of −0.20 V and −0.75 V vs. RHE. In the cathode compartment, I− has a strong covalent bond to the electrode forming Cu-I catalytic layer, which can facilitate the electron transfer from electrode to CO2 and render the subsequent electron-transfer more expedient [44]. Such a special role of KI aqueous solution may contribute to CO2 electroreduction. In order to ensure the consistency of the electrolyte, KI aqueous solution was used in the anode compartment, just serving as electrolyte. The catalytic ink was prepared by mixing Cu/TiO2/NG with a 5 wt% Nafion solution and distilled water and then spraying this mixture onto CP with a diffusion layer to form a gas diffusion electrode. This gas diffusion electrode served as the working electrode, a platinum plate functioned as the counter electrode, and an SCE served as the reference electrode. Under the reported reaction conditions, the liquid products were detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy. For comparison, potentiostatic electrolysis were also carried out on NG, Cu/NG and TiO2/NG. As described in Table 1 , methanol and ethanol (accompanied with n-propanol) were obtained on both Cu/NG and Cu/TiO2/NG at −0.20 V and −0.75 V, respectively; however, no liquid products were detected on NG and TiO2/NG, which confirmed the LSV results. Moreover, Cu/TiO2/NG possesses higher FEs (19.5% for methanol at −0.20 V vs. RHE and 43.6% for ethanol at −0.75 V vs. RHE) than Cu/NG (12.7% for methanol at −0.20 V vs. RHE and 24.1% for ethanol at −0.75 V vs. RHE), indicating that Cu/TiO2/NG exhibits the optimal performance toward CO2 electrochemical reduction among all four graphene-based carbon materials. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity may be partially caused by the increased EASA, and therefore, cyclic voltammograms of the ferri-/ferrocyanide couple ([Fe(CN)6]3−/4−) as a reference probe on these catalysts were evaluated (Fig. S7) [45]. As expected, the largest EASA was obtained on Cu/TiO2/NG (Table 1). The increase can be attributed to the increased number of active sites, as already described in the above text. At −0.20 V vs. RHE, Cu/TiO2/NG displayed a larger partial J (0.061 mA/cm2) for methanol relative to that of Cu/NG (0.041 mA/cm2), as shown in Table 1. In addition, the J of CO2 reduction on Cu/TiO2/NG at −0.75 V vs. RHE was 2.06-fold higher than that on Cu/NG for ethanol and 1.21-fold higher than that on Cu/NG for n-propanol, respectively. Similarly, this also shows that Cu/TiO2/NG possesses superior activity for the electroreduction of CO2, consistent with the above experimental results. Notably, the obviously enhanced catalytic activity may be ascribed to the synergistic effect among Cu, TiO2 and NG. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also supports the optimal performance of Cu/TiO2/NG among the four graphene-based carbon materials, as shown in Fig. S8. In linear region, the slope of the EIS spectrum of Cu/TiO2/NG is higher than those of the other three electrodes, which indicates that Cu and TiO2 inserted into NG helps enhance mass diffusion. In summary, controlling the structure and composition of a multi-component catalyst can enhance the electrocatalytic activity [46]. Fig. 3 represents the partial J and FE of each product on the Cu/TiO2/NG material at different potentials. The partial J and FE for methanol and ethanol display a volcanic shape depending on the applied potential. In detail, the onset potential for methanol generation at −0.10 V vs. RHE, corresponds to an overpotential of 0.12 V [47], and a maximum partial J and FE (achieved 19.5%) were obtained at −0.20 V vs. RHE and then decreased as the potential further increased in the negative direction. The partial J for ethanol increased sharply with a negatively shifting potential until reaching the potential of −0.75 V vs. RHE, where the maximum FE for ethanol production (43.6%) was achieved. Upon further shifting the potential in the negative direction, the J and FE for ethanol began to decline, consistent with the appearance of the hydrogen evolution reaction [48]. However, the partial J of n-propanol first increased with a negative shift of the applied potential and then reached a plateau when the potential reached −0.75 V. Interestingly, across a range of applied potentials, different alcohols could be obtained with high efficiency and selectivity by solely controlling the applied potential on the same cathode material, which was seen in our previous reports [49,50]. A detailed schematic illustration of the electroreduction of CO2 over the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst will be presented later. Stability is an equally vital factor to develop catalysts for CO2 reduction. We tested the long-term performance of the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst at −0.20 V vs. RHE for 20 h. The J maintains a steady value at approximately 0.31 mA/cm2 (Fig. S9a), and the FE of methanol only fluctuates slightly at approximately 19% throughout the test. (Fig. S9b). Moreover, to better illustrate the stability of the material, Cu/TiO2/NG was also measured at −0.75 V vs. RHE over 20 h. The J retains a constant value at approximately 1.43 mA/cm2 (Fig. S10a), and the FE of ethanol only fluctuates slightly at approximately 43% over the test duration (Fig. S10b). After the long-term experiment, we analyzed the composition of the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst. The XRD patterns showed no considerable changes (Fig. S11). Methanol was only obtained on the Cu/NG and Cu/TiO2/NG materials at a potential of −0.35 V vs. RHE and more positive potentials. Methanol, corresponding to a 6 e− reduction with H+ cation, was obtained in the presence of Py on the Cu/NG and Cu/TiO2/NG composites, which has been confirmed by previous literatures [41–43]. The loading of Cu or Cu/TiO2 NPs may adjust the electronic structure of NG, which improves the catalytic activity for the electroreduction of CO2 to methanol. On the other hand, at −0.45 V vs. RHE and more negative potentials, ethanol, as a C2 product, was the major product, which was commonly produced by the copper-containing species in these composites. During the reduction of CO2 to ethanol, carbon-carbon coupling for adsorbed intermediates on Cu surface is crucial step at some point in the reaction [46]. In comparison, the FEethanol of 27.4% was obtained on Cu/TiO2 NPs in our previous work [38]. For the NG substrate, the carbon atoms, which are adjacent to the nitrogen atoms, may be positively polarized, resulting from electron-withdrawing effects in the graphene π-conjugated system. This polarization may provide an active site for Cu atoms to adsorb C2 intermediates, which may favour ethanol generation [51–53]. Notably, TiO2 was successfully introduced into the Cu/TiO2/NG catalyst, which exhibits a high efficiency and low overpotential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in comparison to the Cu/NG catalyst, indicating that TiO2 as a co-catalyst has strong redox ability to facilitate CO2 reduction, stabilize intermediates, and reduce the overpotential of CO2 electroreduction [36,37]. Fig. 4 reveals a proposed schematic illustrating the above described reaction process. More detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism of CO2 electroreduction to methanol and ethanol requires further study."
8,Conclusion,"In summary, we demonstrated the fabrication of a novel Cu/TiO2/NG material, as a heterogeneous catalyst, which remarkably enhanced the activity and selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to alcohols in CO2-saturated KI aqueous solution. The catalyst efficiently converted CO2 into various alcohols (methanol, with a maximum FE of 19.5% at −0.20 V vs. RHE; ethanol, with a maximum FE of 43.6% at −0.75 V vs. RHE) by solely shifting the applied potential. The catalyst exhibited high stability in long-term electrolysis. The notable enhanced catalytic activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to different alcohols on Cu/TiO2/NG was ascribed to the synergistic effect among Cu, TiO2 and NG. Our promising Cu/TiO2/NG composite catalyst may offer a new way to design efficient CO2 reduction catalysts based on inexpensive, easily prepared graphene-based materials and inspire the utilization of metals to serve as the active sites for hydrocarbon. Additionally, more detailed mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, will be illustrated in the near future."
