0,Introduction,"In recent decades, it has become evident that fossil fuels resources are depleting and that CO2 emissions are partly responsible for global warming [1]. At the same time, the demands for energy supply has never been higher worldwide due to an increasing population and way of living [2,3]. The use of biomass to produce valuable energy carriers is one possible pathway for reducing the impact of present energy usage, as well as the dependency on fossil fuels [4]. Biomass can be converted into liquid, gas, and char via pyrolysis [5–9]; these products may then be utilized for different purposes. The pyrolysis bio-crude, i.e., the liquid condensate predominantly consisting of oxygenated organic compounds (oxygenates), is problematic to handle and exploit, and removal/conversion of oxygenates is needed. While catalytic pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) aim to deliver an oil refinery compatible feedstock and a completely deoxygenated liquid, respectively, severe coking and deactivation of the catalysts employed generally limit their industrial implementation [10]. Therefore, a conditioning step of the raw pyrolysis product before further processing can have many benefits from a process point-of-view. The full gas phase composition from the pyrolyzer is in this work referred to as pyrolysis gas, i.e., the permanent gases together with the bio-crude oxygenates and water in the gaseous state. Mild (or partial) oxygenate deoxygenation lowers the pyrolysis gas dew point temperature, thus lowering the risk of unwanted condensation in process equipment, and also reduces the corrosive and polymerizing power of the condensate [11,12]. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation by carbon laydown in catalytic steam reforming due to particularly troublesome classes of oxygenate compounds, such as heterocycles, methoxy phenols, and phenols [13], may be circumvented. After such a conditioning step, the bio-crude may be treated with hydrogen at high pressure and converted to suitable hydrocarbon products via catalytic HDO [8,14–17] or catalytically cracked and steam reformed in SR, optionally followed by a separate lower temperature water-gas shift (WGS) step, into a synthesis gas [18–23]. Furthermore, concepts for bio-crude conditioning during hydrotreatment are previously reported [24]; however, all concepts reported utilize condensed bio-crude, as well as high hydrogen pressures, increasing the overall processing costs. An online conditioning step would be superior as re-evaporation of thermally labile bio-crude is not required. Moreover, atmospheric pressure treatment without the addition of external hydrogen at high pressure or steam minimizes additional costs. In the present study, the concept of online mild catalytic treatment of pyrolysis gas over an iron-based catalyst without the addition of external hydrogen or steam is considered. Previous laboratory-scale studies on catalytic flash pyrolysis [14,16], catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors [25–27], as well as model compound studies [28,29], indicate that Fe-based catalysts are interesting as low-cost materials for oxygenate deoxygenation/conversion at intermediate temperatures. We investigated the potential of using a Fe-based catalyst for conversion of pyrolysis gas (bio-crude and permanent gas), produced in an industrial small-scale pyrolyzer, for production of less oxygenated liquid and hydrogen-enriched gas as a pre-conditioning step before further treatment. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no such concept has been investigated previously at industrial scale. Other materials such as zeolites have been extensively used for bio-crude deoxygenation and upgrading, achieving high degrees of deoxygenation [30]. However, major components of bio-crude (i.e., phenols) have low reactivity on ZSM-5 (a zeolite catalyst) and undergo thermal decomposition producing coke. Zeolite catalysts also deactivate quickly by carbon laydown from the decomposition and polymerization of large organic molecules present in the bio-crude [14,31]. Therefore, zeolites need frequent regeneration and their use in a fixed-bed reactor is therefore problematic. In addition to the coking problem, most employed zeolite materials are water sensitive at elevated temperatures and the resulting dealumination causes irreversible deactivation [14]. The current study focuses on general process performance and the chemistry taking place on the Fe-based catalyst surface. Specifically, the catalyst activity toward pyrolysis vapor conversion to permanent gases and non-oxygenated hydrocarbons as well as the WGS reaction properties are evaluated by comprehensive analysis of changes in bio-crude and permanent gas composition, as well as by characterization of fresh and spent catalyst. In addition, reaction pathways of the pyrolysis gas catalytic reforming are proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental setup,"2.1 Experimental setup All experiments were performed at Cortus Energy AB biomass gasification facility in Köping, Sweden [32]. The experimental setup was installed on site and utilized the gas produced from the pyrolysis reactor. The pyrolysis reactor consists of a rotary kiln where dried biomass is fed and pyrolyzed at a temperature of 380°C and at slow heating rates (approx. 15°C/min). The resulting char is ground and fed to an indirectly heated steam gasifier, while the pyrolysis gas is transferred to burners in a heated line (pyrolysis gas line) and combusted to produce the heat required for steam gasification. The setup, designed and developed at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . It consists of four main parts; a high-temperature filter, a fixed-bed catalytic reactor, piping and valves, and a sampling system. A simple block diagram of the sampling system is shown separately in Fig. 2 . All piping and valves were heated and insulated to avoid condensation along the tubes. All piping and valves were trace heated to avoid condensation along the tubes and all the heated parts were insulated to minimize the heat loss. The hot gas filter was used to remove particulates from the raw pyrolysis gas (line 1) before entering the catalytic reactor. The filter was heated externally and purged with nitrogen periodically (line 4) to avoid build-up of a filter cake and a consequential pressure drop. The dust-free pyrolysis gas (line 2) could either bypass or enter the catalytic reactor. The volume of the reactor was 2.3dm3 and had an inner diameter of 55mm. The reactor was externally heated using three heating zones with a height of approximately 0.3m each, controlled by the reactor wall temperature. Three thermocouples monitored the temperature inside the reactor. Sampling of the pyrolysis gas was done with a known dry gas sampling flow of 2l/min. The system enabled both sampling of condensate (bio-crude and water) and permanent gases (N2, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2+) mixture before and after the catalytic reactor. C2+ compounds, measured by GC, were C2H4, C2H6, and 1-butene. The first two and the last impinger bottles contained iso-propanol, while the rest of the bottles in the sequence contained water. The first three impinger bottles with glass frit were placed in a cooling water bath, enabling rapid condensation of the bio-crude and water, as well as preventing evaporation of the iso-propanol. The application of a low sampling rate helps minimize losses due to evaporation, and flow rates from 1.7 to 10l/min are recommended [33]. The use of impinger bottles with glass frit is needed for the breakdown of aerosols possibly formed during the cooling of the pyrolysis gas [33]. Moreover, the use of alcohol in the cooled impinger bottles also helps to minimize their formation during the condensation [34]. The last two impinger bottles were added for further cooling of the pyrolysis gas. A phosphorous pentoxide column was placed before the GC to remove any remaining moisture."
3,Materials and methods,"2.2 Materials and methods 2.2.1 Materials The tests were carried out using chips of treetops and branches (GROT). The composition of the biomass is listed in Table 1 . The catalyst used for experiments was an unsupported Fe-based catalyst (Haldor Topsoe A/S, HT-25409) with a cylindrical pellet shape form of 6×6mm size. Inert filler (Vereinigte Füllkörper-Fabriken, DURANIT® Inert Balls D99 with the size of 1/8″) was used in the volume of the reactor above and below the catalytic bed to increase the thermal conductivity, as well as improving radial mixing, reducing the axial dispersion and minimizing channeling over the catalytic bed. 2.2.2 Gas and condensate analysis The composition of the permanent gases in the pyrolysis gas, i.e., after condensing out water and the bio-crude, was analyzed using an online micro-GC (Thermo Scientific, C2V-200). The C/H/O and S analyses, as well as the water content and ash analyses of condensate samples, were performed at Karlhamnsverkets laboratory, UNIPER. Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content were determined according to ASTM D5291 and sulfur to ASTM D1552 analyses methods. Oxygen and water content were determined by difference and Karl Fischer titration (ASTM E 203), respectively. Ash was determined according to ASTM D482 standard. Because no changes were observed in the third bottle (water) of the condensate sampling train after sampling, only the contents of the two first condensate bottles (iso-propanol) in the train were analyzed after being mixed together (Fig. 2). No phase separation was observed in either bottle prior to or after mixing and a single phase liquid was submitted for analysis. Gravimetric determination of condensate before and after the catalytic treatment of the pyrolysis gas was carried out. The increase in weight of the sampling bottles is a measure of the bio-crude and water content. It is important to mention that all bio-crude analyses were performed with iso-propanol as a solvent, but results reported are on isopropanol-free basis. With respect to conversion of compounds and compound classes, they are reported on a water- and isopropanol-free basis. Condensate samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector (MSD). The GC was equipped with a 30m×250µm×0.25µmHP-5ms column using He as carrier gas. The scan range was set from 45 to 550 m/z. The inlet and transfer lines were both held at 280°C while the split ratio was set to 20:1. Initially, the GC furnace was held at 40°C for 2min followed by a heating rate of 2°C/min until the temperature reached 140°C. Thereafter, the heating rate was changed to 5°C/min until 240°C was reached, and subsequently to 10°C/min until 315°C was reached, followed by isothermal treatment for 20min. ChemStation software was used for peak integration and NIST11 library for peak identification. Condensate samples were also analyzed using 1H-NMR to determine the change of the functional groups, such as aromatics, phenols, and aldehydes, of different components in raw and treated bio-crude. Approximately 30mg of the condensate samples were dissolved in 1mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with TMS as an internal standard. The 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 400MHz on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer at room temperature. 2.2.3 Catalyst characterization In order to determine the total carbon content of the catalyst, chemical analysis of fresh and used catalyst samples were performed by IR quantification of sample high-temperature oxidation generated CO2 in a LECO, CS230 series and an ELTRA, CS-2000 series instrument. The state of the spent catalyst was also analyzed at Topsoe by means of XRD using a PANalytical Empyrean instrument, and an in-house WGS activity test procedure. The BET surface area was determined using a Micromeritics, ASAP 2000 unit, with data collected at relative pressures between 0.06 and 0.2. The samples were outgassed under vacuum and at a temperature of 250°C for 4h prior to analysis. Data was collected at the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature (77K). Temperature programmed oxidation of the fresh and used catalyst was performed at a heating rate of 6°C/min up to 800°C in a 30ml/min flow of 5% O2 in He, while monitoring the difference in thermal conductivity between inlet and outlet gas. The hold time at 800°C was 60min. 2.2.4 Theoretical calculation For evaluation of results, we performed a mass balance calculation for carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen over the catalytic reactor, based on Eq. (1). The flow of the raw pyrolysis gas is denoted with the index “in” and the treated flow with “out”. (1) N i , IN = ∫ 0 t f ̇ OUT y i M wi α i dt + ∫ 0 t x i G ̇ OUT dt + Δ C i =C, H, or O, Ni , IN [g] is the inlet mass, yi the molar fraction of a compound in the gas, f ̇ out [molh−1] is the total outlet molar flow of gas, α i is the number of atoms of element i in a compound, and xi is the mass fraction of i element in the condensate. M wi [gmol−1] is the atomic weight of i element (C, H, and O), and G ̇ OUT [gh−1] is the outlet mass flow rate of the condensate. The third term, ΔC [g], concerns only carbon deposit on the catalyst wherein the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface is determined by the total mass of the accumulated carbon. T [h] refers to the total experimental time. Conversion of main compounds in the pyrolysis vapor over the reactor was calculated using Eq. (2). (2) X i = 1 - yield i , treated bio - crude yield i , raw bio - crude where i denotes different compounds in the condensate. The yield is proportional to the yields of bio-crude components and is normalized on solvent- and water-free basis. The yield is calculated based on Eq. (3). (3) yield ∝ area ∗ M ̇ ( 1 - x H 2 O ) where area is the integrated area of GC–MS results, normalized on solvent-free basis. M ̇ [molh−1] denotes total mass flow of bio-crude (dry-basis) and x H 2 O is the mass fraction of water in the condensate. The water gas shift reaction quotient was calculated using Eq. (4) [35]. (4) Q = p CO 2 p H 2 p CO p H 2 O where p signifies the partial pressure. 2.2.5 Catalyst stabilization and activity tests The raw pyrolysis gas was produced at a set temperature of 380°C at slow heating rates, using dried GROT as the feedstock in the pyrolysis unit after drying [32]. The average flow rate of pyrolysis gas was 1.11Nm3/h, excluding the nitrogen flow of 0.31Nm3/h. All the experimental units and parts shown in Fig. 1 was kept at 450°C except during the in-situ activation/stabilization period of the catalyst where the temperature of the catalytic reactor was kept at 400°C. Thermocouples inside small thermowell pockets extending into the reactor in the middle and at the bottom of the reactor measured the top and bottom temperatures in the catalytic bed. The top thermocouple measured the inlet gas temperature inside the reactor. Table 2 describes the operational conditions of the catalytic reactor. After the initial catalyst stabilization in the pyrolysis gas, the reactor temperature was raised to 450°C. The total stable operation and time on stream of the iron-based catalyst was 8h. The hot gas filter was purged approximately every 1.5–2h and filter cake residues were collected in a container, connected to the bottom of the filter unit. The online micro-GC monitored the gas composition and stability of the test. The GC samples were taken every 2–3h. Condensate samples were collected from the raw and treated pyrolysis gas at the beginning and end of reactor time on stream (ToS). The experimental conditions are summarized in Table 2."
4,Results,
5,Catalytic reactor operation,"3.1 Catalytic reactor operation Fig. 3 shows the temperatures at the top and at the bottom of the catalytic bed, and reactor gas inlet during the initial stabilization period. For simplicity, the schematic of the reactor with thermocouples are shown in the top left corner of the Fig. 3. Each curve has the same color as the thermocouple (TC) shown in the schematic. The temperature profiles shown start with a period where the reactor temperatures are close to 400°C and purged with pure nitrogen, followed by a switch from nitrogen to pyrolysis gas. During this initial stabilization period, no purging of the filter was performed to minimize flow fluctuations. After the first introduction of the process gas at maximum flow rate (ToS: 40min), a sharp and rapid increase in the bottom temperature of the reactor occurred (black curve). To counteract this rapid temperature increase, the process gas flow was reduced when the temperature at the bottom of the catalyst bed reached 490°C. Thereafter, it was slowly increased back to normal flow again in a stepwise manner until the temperature peak vanished (ToS between 60 and 85min). There was also a significant temperature decrease developing over time at the top of the catalytic bed, reaching its minimum at 340°C shortly after a full process gas flow was attained again (red curve). The inlet gas temperature fluctuated within approximately 10°C during the initial time of activation (blue curve). The initial dynamics, the catalytic bed inlet endotherm and bed exit exotherm are discussed in Section 4.1. After the initial temperature changes in the catalyst bed, the temperatures stabilized and the reactor wall temperature was then increased to 450°C in each heating zone. Thereafter, the reactor temperatures were constant, implying stable operational conditions and flows. The inlet gas, and top and bottom bed temperature were constant for the remaining stable 8-h ToS. The observed gas inlet temperature (440°C) was 10°C lower than the reactor wall temperature (450°C), whereas the catalytic bed top (412°C) and bottom (450°C) were approximately 40°C and 10°C lower and higher than the inlet gas temperature, respectively. The 10°C lower gas inlet temperature compared with the reactor wall temperature was most likely related to heat loss from the top of the reactor, especially the reactor flange."
6,Raw and treated product characterization,"3.2 Raw and treated product characterization 3.2.1 Mass balance and distribution The mass balance output-to-input ratio (Nout/Nin), based on the online micro-GC, gravimetric results and condensate analyses, for C, H, and O were 0.81, 1.14, and 0.98, respectively. The carbon laydown on the catalyst was included in the C balance. The observed differences are most likely associated with errors in condensate sampling and water content measurement. However, any inherent biases are most likely cancelled out, as we compare the differences in samples taken before and after catalytic treatment, using the same procedure. The losses in condensate sampling associated with the inherent aerosol formed during pyrolysis are negligible, due to the minimal aerosol formation under the pyrolysis conditions used (low temperature and slow heating rate) [36,37]. The mass distribution of bio-crude, permanent gas, and water of raw and treated pyrolysis gas is shown in Fig. 4 on an N2-free basis. There is a 51wt% reduction in bio-crude content while the water and permanent gas content increase by 56.1wt% and 18.2wt%, respectively. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of carbon fraction in raw and treated pyrolysis gas. Permanent gas yielded 40% and 50% C in raw and treated pyrolysis gas, respectively. Carbon fraction in raw bio-crude is 59%, decreasing to 42% in the bio-crude after pyrolysis gas treatment. The carbon laydown on the catalyst was 3% of the total C yield in the treated pyrolysis gas. C laydown results are presented and discussed in Sections 3.3 and 4.3. 3.2.2 Bio-crude analysis Table 3 shows the C, H, O, N, S, and ash analysis of bio-crude on a solvent- and water-free basis, as well as water content in the condensate, for raw and treated samples collected from the sampling line. The oxygen and carbon content in the solvent-free bio-crude decreases and increases over the reactor, respectively, while the hydrogen content does not seem to change. The higher content of oxygen in the raw bio-crude, compared with the biomass, can be attributed to the low pyrolysis temperature and the slow heating rate, mainly decomposing cellulose and hemicellulose, containing higher oxygen content compared with lignin [7,38]. The content of water increases from 20 to 44.3% by weight in the total condensate. If the condensate, after a likely necessary desulfurization step, should be fed to a pre-reformer and a subsequent higher temperature steam reformer for production of a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas, relevant ratios are the condensate steam-to-carbon ratio (Steam/C) and overall O/C and H/C ratios [39]. These ratios are also given for the raw and treated condensate in Table 3. Fig. 6 displays the yield changes of compounds in the bio-crude as main components and major group of molecules with their calculated yields in the bio-crude before and after pyrolysis gas treatment. A decrease in yields of all the group of compounds is observed. The highest decreases are for acetic acid (77.7%) and methoxy phenols (73.6%), followed by, in order of decreased reduction, catechol (benzenediol), BTX, heterocyclic compounds, non-aromatic ketones, alkyl phenols, and phenol. Looking more detailed into the alkylated phenols group of molecules, p-cresol and 3-ethyl phenol yields increases (2% and 6.5%) over the reactor, shown as an insert in Fig. 6. The functional groups of the compounds were also determined by 1H-NMR. The results is presented according to different proton chemical shift regions (δ, ppm) for the functional groups [40,41], as shown in Table 4 . The main differences between raw bio-crude and after pyrolysis gas treatment is in the 0.2–1.8, 3.0–4.2, and 4.2–6.4 chemical shift regions. The intensity in the 3–4.2 (methoxy group) is reduced, while it increased for 0.2–1.8 (alkyl protons) and 4.2–6.4 (phenolic). 3.2.3 Permanent gas analysis The composition of the permanent gas in the raw and treated pyrolysis gas versus ToS, shown as GC sampling time intervals, is displayed in Fig. 7 a and b on a N2-free basis. The changes of the permanent gas composition in the raw pyrolysis gas are negligible over time. In case of the treated pyrolysis gas, some smaller variations are observed for the permanent gas composition during the 8h of stable operation. There is no clear trend in the changes, and the variations are most likely related to a certain degree of inlet gas flow fluctuations. Fig. 8 a and b presents the calculated average molar flow rates of the permanent gas components in the raw and treated pyrolysis gas. The average molar flows of hydrogen and carbon dioxide increase significantly, the C2+ compounds change marginally, while the carbon monoxide molar flow decreases significantly. Changes in the molar flow rate of methane are virtually negligible."
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.3 Catalyst characterization Table 5 presents characterization results obtained for fresh and spent catalyst. The fresh catalyst BET surface area is estimated to 72m2/g. As expected for the case of the spent catalyst, the BET surface area is lower and correlates directly with the relative increase in average catalyst crystallite sizes. The bulk phase of the used catalyst after the test was Fe3O4 (magnetite) as determined by XRD. The amount of deposited carbon on the catalyst is roughly 10–11% of the weight of the catalyst for all samples from the top to the bottom of the bed. In order to determine to what degree the catalyst may have influenced the pyrolysis gas composition, via the water gas shift reaction, spent catalyst samples were also tested for high-temperature WGS activity at Topsoe. Spent catalyst pellets from both the top and the bottom of the catalytic bed were found to possess a considerable WGS activity, in the order of 20–30% to what could be expected for a commercial Fe-based high-temperature WGS catalyst in its fresh state. Results from TPO experiments, performed on fresh and spent samples from top, middle, and bottom of the bed, are shown in Fig. 9 , displayed as inverted thermal conductivity values. The secondary Y-axis shows the linear increase of temperature, starting at around 30°C and ending at 800°C. All the spent catalyst spectra demonstrate a significant peak around 450°C, not present for the fresh catalyst. Negative peaks around 250°C are also observed for the spent sample. Weak peaks around 800°C are identified for the spent catalyst samples, which could be related to its use. For the fresh catalyst, weak peaks are also visible, but they are most likely related to carbon-based materials used in the synthesis of the catalyst."
8,Discussion,
9,Catalytic reactor operation,"4.1 Catalytic reactor operation The operating conditions as well as changes in temperature profiles during the catalyst initial stabilization phase and ToS are discussed to further elucidate the observations in the catalytic reactor. As shown in Fig. 3 and described in detail in Section 3.1, the first exposure to pyrolysis gas at an inlet process gas temperature of about 400°C, resulted in a clear initial exothermic response at the bottom of the catalytic bed, followed by an endothermic response at the top of the catalytic bed simultaneously as the gas flow was lowered. A significant endothermic behavior was also observed at the top of the catalytic bed during the stable 8h of ToS at 450°C. As will be discussed later in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 regarding the observed changes in product composition over the catalytic bed, the endotherm at the top of the catalyst bed is most likely explained by deoxygenation and oxygenate cracking/steam reforming reactions. The extent of homogeneous gas phase (thermal) reactions was minimal as concluded from minimal gas composition changes observed in our previous study [42] when using inert bed material in the reactor. The 40°C temperature increase from the top of the catalytic bed to the exit of the catalytic bed is certainly partly due to the reactor heating, but very likely also due to an exothermic catalyst activation as well as a significant contribution from the exothermic forward WGS reaction, CO+H2O→CO2 +H2, as supported by the observed CO consumption over the catalyst discussed in the next Section (4.2), and the considerable WGS activity measured for the spent catalyst. During the initial catalyst stabilization phase of operation using raw pyrolysis gas, we suggest the observed variations in catalytic bed top and bottom temperatures to be a combination of the reactions described above. This combined with a potentially exothermic catalyst activation process and an influence of a significantly varying gas flow rate, including a varying axial heat transfer, may further explain the changes in the top and bottom temperatures. Due to the temperature exotherm and temperatures reaching at least as high as 490°C in the bed, dampening of the catalyst activity is likely to have taken place during the catalyst stabilization phase. This dampening of the activity is likely due to accelerated carbon laydown caused by enhanced thermal cracking of oxygenates. Catalyst sintering is also accelerated at high temperatures, contributing to the decrease in the catalyst activity."
10,Bio-crude and permanent gas analyses,"4.2 Bio-crude and permanent gas analyses The possible explanation behind the changes in bio-crude and permanent gas is explored in this section. As observed in the GC–MS results in Fig. 6, the significant conversion of 77.7% and 73.6% for acids and methoxy phenols is proof that the Fe-based catalyst is active toward reduction of high oxygen-containing and unstable oxygenate compounds. The smaller reduction of phenolic and alkylated compounds as well as increased conversion of p-cresol and 3-ethyl phenol by 2% and 6.5%, respectively, indicates a less catalytic activity toward reduction of phenol compounds and a selective catalytic conversion to certain alkylated phenols. Similar results, displaying increased yield of alkyl phenols, have been observed in other studies for gas-phase HDO [14,26,43] and alkylation [44,45], using Fe-based catalysts. Interestingly, our data also suggests a significant reduction (approximately 60%) of the rather stable BTX components in the bio-crude after catalytic treatment. Arab et al. [46] observed hydroxylation of benzene to phenol over a Fe-based catalyst. It is known that the hydroxylation of benzene on Fe species by H2O2 oxidant follows a radical mechanism, where Fe species are the active components for accelerating the formation of OH groups [47]. OH groups multiply with the increase of Fe active sites, resulting in a high conversion of benzene. This may describe the changes in the stable BTX compounds in the bio-crude. Referring to the 1H-NMR results in Table 4, the intensity in the 3–4.2ppm chemical shift region reduced considerably, confirming the methoxy phenol reduction observed in the GC–MS result. The observed increase in alkyl protons (0.2–1.8ppm range) after pyrolysis gas treatment is in agreement with the small increase in C2H6, observed in the micro-GC results in Fig. 8b. Cracking of larger hydrocarbons to lighter ones, such as alkanes, is one of the possible explanations for increase in this shift region. Oxygenate decarbonylation may also contribute to the increase in alkyl protons. The observed reduction in aromatic protons (6.4–8.0ppm range) is also in agreement with the decrease detected in the GC–MS results for compounds that include aromatic rings such as BTX, phenol, and methoxy phenols. However, the increase in 4.2–6.4ppm region, representing the characteristic resonance of phenolic protons, was not in complete agreement with the corresponding GC–MS results. One of the reasons could be related to the OH characteristic range, being broader than expected. Labile protons such as OH groups can exchange with other labile groups in water, solvent, etc. Therefore, the shift region for such a proton may vary depending on concentration of the exchanging species, exchange rates, and other parameters, making it difficult to evaluate the results solely based on 1H-NMR. Besides the changes described above for the bio-crude compositions, the KF titration analysis of the condensate confirmed an increase in the water content in the condensate and an overall production of water over the catalyst, as can be seen in Fig. 4. This water production originates primarily from very facile and fast oxygenate dehydration reactions, which will be elaborated in the next Section (4.3) by analysis of the bio-crude Van Krevelen diagram. According to the average molar flow of permanent gases, shown in Fig. 8a, the increase for hydrogen and CO2 is 11.7-fold and 1.36-fold, respectively. The CO molar flow decreased by 3mol/h, whereas the methane and lighter higher hydrocarbon increases are negligible and marginal, respectively. This demonstrates significant WGS activity and minimal, if any, CO hydrogenation activity. The increase in molar flow rate of hydrogen was 8.1mol/h, whereas the increase in molar flow of CO2 was 4.2mol/h over the reactor. If the only active role in permanent gas conversion was governed by the WGS reaction, identical increase in content of H2 and CO2 would be expected. Therefore, it implies, as already can be concluded from the GC–MS results, that other reactions besides oxygenate dehydration and forward water gas shift reaction also contribute significantly to the synthesis gas production, such as for instance the observed acetic acid decomposition. A high acetic acid decomposition activity is in accordance with Brijaldo et al. [48] who observed a high selectivity toward hydrogen production via catalytic decomposition of acetic acid by supporting palladium on an iron oxide carrier."
11,Catalyst activity and reaction mechanism,"4.3 Catalyst activity and reaction mechanism The decrease of the BET surface down the bed, observed in Table 5, is directly related to catalyst sintering occurring during the test. This conclusion is based on the relative ratio between average crystallite sizes in the spent and fresh catalyst presented in Table 5, obtained by the XRD data. The temperature increase observed at the bottom of the reactor during the catalyst stabilization phase (see Fig. 3) lead to an accelerated catalyst sintering accordingly. As shown in Fig. 9 for TPO results, a 450°C peak was produced for the spent samples, whereas no similar peak was detected for the fresh catalyst, clearly demonstrating a significant carbon laydown on the spent catalyst. This is fully in line with the C-LECO analysis, displaying an evenly distributed C laydown throughout the catalytic bed of approximately 10wt%. Based on the C yield results (Fig. 5), the carbon laydown on the catalyst relative to the total amount of carbon processed was 2.5%, being a significant amount. However, the carbon laydown was only a small fraction of the total pyrolysis gas carbon passing over the catalyst during the entire test when compared with coke deposition on zeolite catalysts because of the strong adsorption of compounds on zeolites strong acid sites as well as steric hindrances [49–52]. Despite the carbon laydown and catalyst sintering, the catalyst still possessed a considerable deoxygenation and WGS activity during the test. Based on the online GC results shown in Fig. 7b, and the very stable catalyst bed temperatures during the 8-h test, the catalyst did not appear to deactivate to any large degree under stable conditions. There was no apparent significant trend in the change of exit gas composition or catalyst bed temperatures. Because our data suggests insignificant catalyst deactivation during the stable 8-h test, it is entirely possible that the vast majority of carbon laydown and catalyst sintering occurred during the initial catalyst stabilization phase. A direct way to reduce the carbon laydown on the catalyst in potential future tests would be to develop a better-controlled and milder in-situ catalyst stabilization/activation procedure. In addition, recycling part of the exit gas, which is significantly richer in H2, H2O, and CO2, and significantly leaner in oxygenates than the inlet gas, helps reduce coking on the catalyst. Recycling of reformate in prereforming of heavy feedstocks demonstrated effective decrease of coke deposition [39]. Comparable to low-temperature and atmospheric pressure steam reforming of ethanol and acetic acid, resulting in low carbon laydown and reaching extended stable operation time [53–55], a mild pyrolysis gas pre-conditioning step similar to the one studied here may be beneficial before further bio-crude processing. The reason for negative peaks in the TCD response TPO data, appearing in the 100-350°C range for the spent catalyst samples, is not immediately evident. One explanation could be a reaction consuming oxygen without too much evolution of product gas in this temperature range, e.g., sample oxidation. This would result in a product gas with higher thermal conductivity than the reference gas (5% O2 in He) and thus give rise to a negative peak in Fig. 9. The small shoulder and weak peak, observed for spent catalysts at around 600°C and 800°C, respectively, are related to smaller amounts of less reactive graphitic-like carbon also deposited on the catalyst. A useful representation to gain insight into the effect of the catalyst on changes in bio-crude composition and the possible reaction pathways is a Van-Krevelen diagram [26]. The diagram is shown in Fig. 10 where results used are based on C/H/O analyses of the solvent-free bio-crude on a dry basis, before and after pyrolysis gas treatment. The lines in the figure represent oxygenates dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbonylation routes. The catalyst reduces bio-crude O/C ratio while the H/C ratio is reduced to a lesser extent. It can be concluded that one of the major pyrolysis gas oxygenates reaction pathways is that of dehydration. However, with respect to decarbonylation and decarboxylation, it is not possible to conclude from the Van Krevelen diagram which of the pathways is more dominant. A simplified mechanism for the conversion of the pyrolysis gas, using the iron-based catalyst is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 11 . Besides establishing the expectedly facile oxygenate dehydration, also other deoxygenation routes (decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation) and oxygenate cracking/steam reforming reactions (e.g., for acetic acid, methoxy phenols, BTX, and heterocyclic compounds), were confirmed to take place as indicated by our results. Dayton et al. [14] suggested deoxygenation of methoxy phenol and indicated an increase in alkyl phenol content as a sign of deoxygenation using an iron-based catalyst. Such a deoxygenative alkylation of methoxy phenols may explain the slight increase of certain alkyl phenols (p-cresol, 3-ethyl phenol) in our study. With respect to hydrodeoxygenation as a reaction route in general, it is unlikely to be significant due to the very low H2 partial pressure in the present study. This is consistent with the fact that the hydrogen content does not increase in the bio-crude after catalytic treatment. Dehydrogenation is not favored at low operating temperatures, and based on the insignificant amounts of methane and minor amounts of higher hydrocarbons formed over the catalyst, CO/CO2 methanation and higher hydrocarbon formation via FT chemistry is very limited, if occurring at all. The non-catalytic thermochemical conversions were minimal because the changes in the gas composition over the bed filled with inert material was insignificant [42]. A drastic difference in surface chemistry of the gas components is anticipated, depending on whether the active surfaces of the catalyst are of Fe-oxide or Fe-carbide character under the process conditions. In the case of Fe-carbide, a significant activity for CO and CO2 hydrogenation into methane and lighter hydrocarbon FT-products is expected [56–58]. No such significant CO/CO2 hydrogenation activity was observed, whereas a significant WGS activity is strongly suggested by our results. We thus infer that the active surface of the Fe-based catalyst under our process conditions was of a Fe-oxide type [22,23] similar to the Fe3O4 observed for the bulk phase of the catalyst after the test. A certain sulfur tolerance of the catalyst can thus be expected [22], and this is a very important feature for catalysts in biomass applications because of the non-negligible sulfur content in biomass. As a final note, a calculation of the WGS reaction quotient (Eq. (4)) results in a value of 2.2 for the exit gas composition during the stable 8-h pyrolysis gas test, corresponding to a composition at WGS equilibrium for a temperature of about 630°C. The equilibrium Q-value at 450°C is 7.5, and the result thus shows that the forward WGS rate under the investigated process and catalyst loading conditions was somewhat slower than required to produce a fully water gas shift equilibrated gas. The catalyst activity may very well have been quenched to a significant degree by a high, site-blocking, surface oxygenate coverage, competitive reactions and additionally reduced by the established carbon laydown and catalyst sintering."
12,Conclusions,"In the present study, the industrial use of Fe-based catalyst for pyrolysis gas conditioning was successfully explored, including an investigation and elaboration of the chemistry taking place over the Fe-based catalyst. After the catalyst’s initial stabilization and during the stable run, an endotherm developed at the inlet of the catalytic bed and a lift in temperature along the bed was observed. This is partly related to oxygenate deoxygenation and cracking/steam reforming of the pyrolysis gas and forward WGS reaction, respectively. An increase in permanent gas and reduction in the bio-crude and its oxygen content was observed in the treated pyrolysis gas. A major dehydration of oxygenates occurred over the bed, and the increase in water content of the treated pyrolysis gas was related to fast dehydration rates. Despite observed catalyst carbon laydown and sintering, there was no noticeable catalyst deactivation during the stable 8-h of operation. Significant oxygenate cracking/steam reforming activity of pyrolysis gas was observed with high reduction of acetic acid, methoxy phenols, ketones, catechol, and heterocyclic compounds indicating a slightly stabilized resultant bio-crude; a significant conversion was observed even for stable BTX compounds. The catalyst exhibited significant WGS activity during the run (CO consumption and H2 production) and was further demonstrated by separate WGS activity tests for the spent catalyst after operation in pyrolysis gas. The WGS reaction rate during the actual pyrolysis gas conditioning was likely inhibited to a certain degree by a high surface coverage of stable oxygenates and sintering, resulting in a non-equilibrated gas. Other deoxygenation reactions such as decarbonylation and decarboxylation also appeared to take place to a lesser extent. No significant CO/CO2 hydrogenation activity into lighter hydrocarbons was observed. We thus conclude that the active surface of the Fe-based catalyst under our process conditions was of a Fe-oxide type rather than Fe-carbide, in line with the observed Fe3O4 as the bulk phase of the catalyst after the test. Development of a milder and better-controlled initial in-situ catalyst stabilization procedure is necessary for carbon laydown reduction. A direct way to reduce the carbon laydown on the catalyst in potential future tests would likely be to recycle part of the exit gas, which is significantly richer in H2, H2O, and CO2, and significantly leaner in oxygenates, than the inlet gas. The present results show that iron-based materials are potential candidates for application in a pyrolysis gas pre-conditioning step before further treatment or use, and a way of generating a pyrolysis gas enriched in hydrogen. Nevertheless, experiments with longer exposure time are necessary to verify the lifetime of the catalyst and the viability of the technology."
