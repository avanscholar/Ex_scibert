0,Introduction,"Copper-based catalysts have attracted significant attention for hydrogenation reactions over the last two decades because of the low cost and low toxicity of this metal, compared to nickel, cobalt, or noble metals [1]. However, the control over the size of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) is often difficult when standard methods such as impregnation are used to introduce the metal, especially onto mesostructured supports. Populations of large copper NPs, with low dispersion, poor catalytic activity and poor stability, are usually reported in the final catalysts [2–10]. Several strategies have been tested to stabilize copper NPs at sizes below 10 nm in mesostructured silicas: thermal treatments carried out at low pressure [11,12], modification of silicas by APTES grafting [2,13–15], impregnation using organometallic complexes [16–18], procedures based on deposition-precipitation [2,19–23], and decomposition of inorganic precursors by autocombustion [24,25]. When standard impregnation procedures are nevertheless used, it has been shown that copper dispersion can be promoted by the addition of a second metal (e.g., Ni, Cr) [26–29], or by the functionalization [30,31] or pore occlusion of the silica support by surfactants [29–32]. This has resulted in an increase of catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, used as a probe reaction. The hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CNA) is known to be challenging as the unsaturated alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol (CNOL), should be selectively produced via CO bond hydrogenation. However, the preferred path on most catalysts, including silica-supported Cu systems, is the hydrogenation of the CC bond owing to favorable thermodynamics and lower activation barriers [32–36]. While the literature on noble metals is abundant, fewer attempts have been made so far to develop a selective copper-based catalytic system [28,31,32,35–51]. It has been reported that Cu+ or Crδ+ sites adjacent to active metallic Cu0 centers can function as electrophilic centers that polarize the CO bond via the lone electron pair in oxygen, thus improving the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group in CNA to CNOL, yet at low reaction rates [28,31,39]. Marchi et al. reported that ternary Cu–Zn–Al and quaternary Cu–Ni(Co)–Zn-Al catalysts were one order of magnitude more active than Cu/SiO2 in CNA hydrogenation, while selective towards CNOL [36]. In these systems, Cu0 particles appeared as highly dispersed over a super-stoichiometric zinc aluminate spinel, and in close interaction with M2+ cations. On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that the introduction of Al atoms at the support surface has a positive effect on the activity and chemoselectivity of both Cu- and Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of CNA [43,52]. The presence of Lewis sites, onto which the CNA molecule adsorbs via its CO bond, is supposed to be a key to improve the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol, without the intervention of a second transition metal. It can thus be tempting with mesostructured supports to solve simultaneously the problem of catalytic activity by promoting copper dispersion thanks to strong metal-support interactions, and the problem of selectivity toward cinnamyl alcohol by providing surface Lewis sites with enhanced affinity for the CO bond. To this end, ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) supports can be modified by addition of aluminium (ordered mesoporous silica-aluminas, OMSA). A facile way to incorporate high amounts of aluminium into the structure of SBA-15 mesoporous silica is to combine the direct synthesis of silica in aqueous medium with Al introduction via a two-step pH adjustment method [53]. This approach was successfully used to prepare Al-SBA-15 with a wide range of Si/Al ratios (5–130) [54]. Compared with siliceous SBA-15, short and long-range mesopore ordering and textural quality are retained, and the number of Lewis sites can be easily controlled. Herein, we show that even if introduced by standard impregnation, monometallic copper can be stabilized as highly dispersed nanoparticles on water-stable Al-SBA-15 OMSA. These catalysts will be compared with materials prepared on SBA-15 OMS and ordered mesoporous alumina (OMA) supports, to highlight the effect of both the size of Cu nanoparticles and of the aluminium incorporation on the catalyst performances in cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals required to prepare the supports and the catalysts were used as purchased: tetraethylorthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4, TEOS, 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich), nonionic triblock copolymer Pluronic P123 (poly(ethyleneoxide)-block - poly-(propyleneoxide)-block - poly(ethyleneoxide)-block, EO20PO70EO20, molecular weight = 5800, BASF Corp.), distilled water, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 %, Sigma-Aldrich), nitric acid (HNO3, 67 %, Sigma-Aldrich), aluminium iso-propoxide (C9H21AlO3, 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (C2H6O, 100 %, Sigma-Aldrich), aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)2·9H2O, 98.5 %, Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide solution (28 % in water, Fluka), and copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich). For the hydrogenation test, the chemicals were also used as purchased: trans-cinnamaldehyde (C6H5C3H3O, 98 %, Merck) as reagent and isopropanol (C3H8O, 99.9 %, Sigma-Aldrich) as solvent."
3,Supports synthesis,"2.2 Supports synthesis OMS (ordered mesoporous silica) support was synthesized according to the procedure proposed by Zhao et al. [55]. 4 g of Pluronic P123 was dissolved in a 1.6 M solution of HCl at 40 °C. The appropriate amount of TEOS (8.5 g) was then added dropwise to the above solution, which was subjected to magnetic stirring for 24 h. The resulting gel was submitted to hydrothermal treatment for 48 h at 100 °C. After recovering by filtration, washing, and drying, the structure directing agent was removed from the pores by calcination under stagnant air at 550 °C for 6 h (in a muffle furnace, using a heating ramp of 1.5 °C min−1). OMSA (ordered mesoporous silica-alumina) supports were prepared by a two-step pH-adjustment method, according to a procedure previously established [54]. Step 1 corresponds to the synthesis of the OMS support, with the aluminium source added after 4 h of stirring, during the aging step of 24 h. The amounts of Al(NO3)3·9H2O were calculated to obtain an alumina content of 10 and 20 wt.% in the final materials. The aged gel was subjected to a first hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 72 h. For step 2, the suspension resulting from step 1 was cooled down to ambient temperature and the pH value of the mother liquor was adjusted to 7.5 by using a 4 M ammonia solution. The pH was continuously monitored with a calibrated pH-meter. After pH adjustment, the mixture was subjected to a second hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 48 h. The final solids were recovered by filtration, washing with distilled water, and drying at 60 °C for 12 h. The open porous structures of OMSA were obtained by calcination (see the paragraph above). The calcined aluminosilicate samples were designated as OMSAX, where X stands for the aluminium content in the material expressed as wt.% Al2O3 (X = 10 and 20). OMA (ordered mesoporous alumina) support was prepared using the EISA method proposed by Yuan et al. [56]. 1 g of Pluronic P123 was dissolved at room temperature in 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol. 3 mL of HNO3 (67 %) and 2.04 g of aluminium iso-propoxide were added into the mixture under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 5 h. Solvent evaporation was performed at 60 °C. When the total evaporation was achieved, the yellow solid was recovered and calcined in stagnant air at 500 °C (1 °C min−1)."
4,Catalysts synthesis,"2.3 Catalysts synthesis Catalysts were denoted by Cu/MS where MS stands for the mesoporous support (MS = OMS, OMSAX). All nominal loadings were 5 wt.% metallic Cu. Metal oxide-loaded OMS and OMSA samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous copper nitrate solutions, followed by mild drying (25 ± 1 °C under air for 5 days) [27]. The powders were submitted to calcination under stagnant air at 500 °C for 6 h (heating ramp of 1.5 °C min−1) to obtain the oxidic form of Cu. After calcination, the solids were stored under ambient conditions in sealed flasks. Cu/OMA catalyst was prepared by a solvent-free, melt infiltration (MI) procedure [29,57,58]. This method was chosen because, when contacted with water (the solvent usually used for impregnation), OMA is subjected to a significant loss of pore structure ordering [59]. The MI method involved mixing the appropriate amounts of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and OMA, followed by grinding for 45 min. The solid mixture was heat-treated at 120 °C in sealed conditions. The obtained infiltrate was calcined under the same conditions as the other catalysts. It can be noted that MI failed to introduce copper nitrate into the porosity of siliceous SBA-15, resulting in the formation of large metallic particles outside the pores."
5,Physico-chemical characterization,"2.4 Physico-chemical characterization Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was performed on a Perkin sequential scanning spectrometer to determine the amount of copper in the catalysts. Before analysis, a known amount of calcined sample was introduced in a diluted HF-HCl solution and then digested under microwave. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker AXS D5005 X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54184 Å). For high-angle analysis, the data were collected in the 2θ range 10−80° with a step of 0.05° (step time of 8 s). Phase identification was made by comparison with the ICDD database. The average crystallite size of CuO was calculated according to the Scherrer equation using the diffraction lines at 35.5 and 38.7°. Nitrogen physisorption was carried out on an Autosorb MP-1 automated gas sorption system from Quantachrome Instruments. The textural data were calculated from the corresponding isotherms using conventional algorithms (B.E.T. for surface area measurement, and NL-DFT for pore size distribution). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 (Thermo Electron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, WI) photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα source (1486.6 eV, powered at 20 mA and 10 kV). Binding energies were determined relatively to the Si 2p XPS peak set at 103.2 eV. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was used to characterize the pore structure of the supports and the distribution of Cu. The micrographs were obtained on a JEOL 2100 instrument (operated at 200 kV with a LaB6 source and equipped with a Gatan Ultra scan camera). EDXS was carried out with a Hypernine (Premium) detector (active area: 30 mm2) using the software SM-JED 2300 T for data acquisition and treatment. Before analysis, the sample was included in a resin and crosscuts of ∼100 nm were realized by ultramicrotomy. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and N2O titration were performed on a Chembet Pulsar TPR/TPD instrument from Quantachrome. About 30 mg of calcined samples were inserted in a U-shape microreactor. Before each TPR run, the catalyst was activated at 500 °C for 1 h under a flow of simulated air (40 mL min−1). After cooling down to 50 °C, the H2 containing flow was stabilized (40 mL min−1, 5 vol.% H2 in Ar) and the TPR was performed from 50 to 700 °C, with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1. The dispersion of metallic copper (DCu), average copper particle size (dCu) and active surface area (SCu) were determined using nitrous oxide titration with the Quantachrome device. 30 mg of samples were introduced in the microreactor. The first reduction was carried out under the same conditions as used for TPR, up to 500 °C. The gas was switched to Ar. The reactor was cooled down to 50 °C, kept at this temperature for 30 min, and then the gas was switched to N2O (40 mL min−1) for 30 min in order to oxidize the zero-valent Cu surface atoms. The sample was again flushed with pure Ar for 30 min, and then a second TPR run was performed."
6,Catalytic testing,"2.5 Catalytic testing Prior to the catalytic tests, the calcined materials were crushed and sieved to select a granulometric fraction smaller than 0.126 mm. Catalysts were reduced under hydrogen flow (1 L h−1) at 500 °C for 10 h (heating rate 6 °C min−1) in order to obtain the metallic catalysts. Cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation was performed in liquid phase in a 4593 Parr reactor. Reduced catalysts were transferred to the reactor without exposure to air. The experimental conditions were: reaction temperature 110 °C, 1 mL of trans-cinnamaldehyde, 40 mL of isopropanol, 250 mg of catalyst, H2 pressure 10 bar, stirring rate of 750 rpm. Aliquots of reaction mixture were periodically taken for analysis. Analysis was performed by GC (HP 5890 equipped with a DB-5 capillary column and a FID detector). Identification of the reactants and products was achieved from the retention times of pure compounds, and occasionally by GC–MS (Agilent 6890 N system equipped with an Agilent 5973 MSD detector and a DB-5-ms column). For the quantitative analyses, the FID response factors for each compound were taken into consideration. For recycling tests, catalyst Cu/OMSA20 was recovered from the reaction mixture after 120 min of reaction by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and isopropanol, dried at 60 °C overnight, calcined at 500 °C and reactivated under H2 at 500 °C. The catalyst was then tested under the conditions described above. Conversion, selectivities and TOF were calculated as follows: c i n n a m a l d e h y d e c o n v e r s i o n m o l % = N 0 − N t N 0 × 100 p r o d u c t s e l e c t i v i t y m o l % = N p r o d u c t N t o t a l × 100 T O F s − 1 = r 0 N C u where N 0 is the initial molar concentration of cinnamaldehyde. N t is the molar concentration of cinnamaldehyde at a given reaction time t. N p r o d u c t is the molar concentration of product. N t o t a l is the total molar concentration of products. r 0 is the initial reaction rate calculated from the initial slope of the conversion curve, expressed in molCNA gcat −1 s−1. N C u is the amount of surface copper sites calculated from N2O titration data, expressed in molCu gcat −1."
7,Results and discussion,
8,"Structural, textural and surface characterization","3.1 Structural, textural and surface characterization Al-SBA-15 supports (OMSA10, OMSA20) were prepared with Al2O3 contents of 10 and 20 wt.% (Si/Al atomic ratio = 7.7 and 3.4, respectively), while SBA-15 silica (OMS) and organized mesoporous alumina (OMA) were used as reference supports. The low-angle XRD patterns of OMSA supports (ESI, Fig. S1) exhibit one well-resolved peak and two weak peaks assigned to (100), (110) and (200) reflections associated with hexagonal p6mm symmetry of well-ordered mesostructured SBA-15. In line with our previous results [54], it can be seen that upon Al introduction via the pH adjustment method, the short- and long-range mesopore ordering and pore size of Al-SBA-15 materials are well preserved at high Al loadings, because the concentration of Al species is high enough to protect the mesoporous structure against hydrolytic degradation. 5 wt.% copper was introduced by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate on OMS and OMSA, or by melt infiltration of hydrated copper nitrate in the case of OMA. The choice of the latter procedure was made necessary by the high sensitivity of mesoporous aluminas to exposure to water [59,60]. ICP-OES analysis confirmed that Al2O3 and Cu contents were close to the targeted values (Table 1 ). Wide-angle XRD patterns of the calcined Cu-containing samples are presented in Fig. 1 . All the samples based on OMS and OMSA display a broad peak at 2θ ∼24° characteristic of amorphous silica. No diffraction peaks belonging to alumina can be observed in the diffractograms of OMSA-based systems, indicating a dispersed or amorphous state for aluminic species. The diffractogram of Cu/OMA exhibits broad features assigned to poorly crystallized alumina. Besides, the Cu/OMS pattern presents intense and narrow diffraction peaks in the range 2θ = 30−80°, characteristic of monoclinic CuO (ICDD 048-1548) (Fig. 1a). These CuO crystallites are large (mean size of 31.5 nm, estimated by the Scherrer equation), and thus located on the external surface of the support given the pore size of SBA-15 (8.4 nm). With the introduction of aluminium in the support (Cu/OMSA10), the diffraction peaks assigned to large CuO particles become much less intense and broader (Fig. 1b), indicating that the average size of these crystallites has decreased (17 nm, Table 1). For the sample with the highest amount of aluminium (Cu/OMSA20), no diffraction peaks can be observed (Fig. 1c). Copper phases are thus highly dispersed, at a size below the detection limit in XRD (∼ 3 nm). These results might be considered as first evidence of the positive role of the Al2O3 coating in improving the dispersion of copper species upon impregnation, due to an enhanced interaction between the OMSA support and copper species [61]. Very weak diffraction peaks are equally observed for Cu/OMA (Fig. 1d). Textural properties were investigated by N2 physisorption at −196 °C (Table 1). Fig. 2 shows the isotherms and pore size distributions for Cu catalysts (characteristics of the bare supports are shown in ESI, Fig. S2). For Cu/OMS and Cu/OMSA, sharp adsorption/desorption branches specific to highly-ordered materials are observed (isotherm of type IV with H1 hysteresis loop [62]). Even at high loadings of alumina, the narrow pore size distribution, centered at 8.4–9.2 nm, was maintained. The apparent decrease of specific surface area and pore volume after metal deposition is explained in part by the mixing of SBA-15 with CuO. For Cu/OMS in particular, CuO is present as large aggregates of extraporous CuO particles which do not clog the porosity (ESI, Fig. S3), and a very low copper content is measured in the silica grains (<0.5 wt.% by EDXS). Cu/OMA displays a type IV-isotherm with a hysteresis loop of type H2, indicating an ordered mesoporous material, though less structured than OMS. Surface area and pore volume were preserved after copper introduction by melt infiltration. TEM images acquired for copper-containing OMSA and OMA materials are displayed in Fig. 3 . The TEM micrographs for the OMSA samples (images A and B) confirm an ordering of the mesoporous structure typical of SBA-15 systems. The local structure of the Cu/OMSA solids thus appears to be in excellent agreement with data extracted from nitrogen physisorption and low-angle XRD. No Al2O3 aggregates are seen blocking the pores of OMSA10 and OMSA20. EDX measurements carried out on the grains (typical spectra are shown in ESI, Figs. S4 and S5) are in agreement with the nominal Si/Al atomic ratios (Si/Al = 7–9 and 3.1–3.5, respectively), indicating that, as formerly demonstrated for these compositions [54], aluminium heteroatoms are incorporated within the Al-SBA-15 mesostructured supports. The OMA-derived sample also displays ordered hexagonal arrays of mesopores, confirming the retention of the mesostructure after copper deposition by melt infiltration. As shown in ESI, Fig. S4, the overall content of copper evaluated by EDX in the mesostructured zones of Cu/OMSA10 is consistent with the nominal Cu loading; in line with wide-angle XRD results, a few bulky CuO crystallites were also identified on the TEM images. In contrast, no extra-porous CuO aggregates could be observed by TEM in the case of Cu/OMSA20 (ESI, Fig. S5) and Cu/OMA. For Cu/OMSA10 and Cu/OMSA20, CuO species could not be initially seen in the channels of the supports because of their dispersed state. Nevertheless, small particles (1 nm) grew upon exposure to the electron beam, confirming the presence of copper in the pores (ESI, Fig. S6). These results demonstrate that the OMSA20 support containing 20 wt% Al2O3 combines the textural characteristics of OMS and a dispersion ability for CuO similar to that of the OMA support, while benefitting from a high stability when exposed to aqueous solutions. Results published so far in the literature, and related to other methods of Cu introduction onto Al-containing mesostructured systems, have evidenced contrasting trends. While Orellana Rico et al. mentioned an improvement of copper dispersion on Al-containing SBA-15 silica [63], Yin et al. reported that an excessive amount of aluminium (Si/Al = 5) had a negative effect on the copper dispersion when the catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation (copper loading of 20 wt.%) [61]. Nilsen et al. prepared Cu-Al-MCM41 materials by direct synthesis, with 10.7 wt.% of copper, and a Si/Al ratio of 20. They observed that CuO was present as an extra-porous phase despite the high amount of aluminium incorporated into the solid [64]."
9,Nature and reducibility of the copper phases,"3.2 Nature and reducibility of the copper phases The chemical and electronic characteristics of the copper phases were investigated by XPS for the Cu/OMSA20 sample, after calcination and after reduction at 500 °C. Cu 2p core level spectra are presented in Fig. 4 . The calcined sample shows the Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublet peaks centered at 933.3 and 952.8 eV, respectively, with a spin-orbit splitting of 19.6 eV. The absence of a peak located at 932.4 eV confirms the absence of bulk copper oxide NPs, in line with XRD and TEM observations [65]. On the other hand, a shoulder at 935.4 eV on the 2p3/2 peak suggests a charge transfer from metal ions toward the support, and the formation of species in which copper is in strong interaction with the support [61,66–69]. A small satellite peak, arising from the 3d-4 s transition during the relaxation process [70], is observed at 944.5 eV (11.2 eV from the main peak). XPS thus suggests the existence of Cu2+ species in two different chemical environments: the contribution at BE =933.3 eV can be attributed to highly dispersed CuO, while the shoulder at BE =935.4 eV is assigned to copper in a CuAl2O4 spinel phase. The low ratio between the intensities of the main peak and satellite peak (Isat/Ipp = 0.07) may also be explained by the high dispersion of CuOx species in octahedral coordination [71] (in contrast with a value of 0.55 for bulk CuO [66,67]). A correlation of this low Isat/Ipp value with the existence of Cu+ species would not be relevant because no signal specific to Cu+/Cu0 species at ∼932 eV can be detected for the calcined sample [72–74]. After reduction under H2 at 500 °C, the binding energy is shifted to a lower value (932.8 eV) while the satellite peak disappears, revealing that copper species are now in a reduced form [61]. The position of the Cu L3M45M45 Auger peak at 568.3 eV (ESI, Fig. 7; modified Auger parameter: 1850.9 eV) evidences the Cu° character of copper after reduction at 500 °C. Cu+ ions would provide a signal at 570 eV, with an Auger parameter close to 1849 eV [75,76]. Thermo-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to determine the reducibility of the copper species and confirm their characteristics in terms of dispersion and interaction with the support (Fig. 5 ). The TPR profile for Cu/OMS exhibited a single hydrogen consumption peak with a maximum at 286 °C, corresponding to the reduction of the large CuO particles outside the SBA-15 porosity. When the aluminium loading increases in the sample, the reduction profile becomes more complex and reduction temperatures shift to higher values. These changes can be related to the CuO particle size [77], or to interactions with the Al2O3- functionalized support surface. The reduction behavior of copper species supported on γ-alumina was used as a reference for comparison; copper aluminate is known to reduce at the highest temperature [78]. The most complex profile belongs to Cu/OMSA10, with multiple reduction steps. Three maxima of reduction at 220, 308 and 410 °C, could be respectively assigned to the small amount of external bulk-like oxide particles, highly dispersed copper oxide particles in the porosity, and copper species in strong interaction with the surface (CuAl2O4) [77,79–81].The profile of Cu/OMSA20 resembles to that of Cu/OMA sample, suggesting similar characteristics of Cu species in the two materials. The main reduction peaks are observed at 310 and 390 °C (Cu/OMSA20), and 340 and 410 °C (Cu/OMA). Most copper is thus confirmed to be present as dispersed CuO and copper aluminate, expected to predominate at low Cu loading and for calcination temperatures up to 500 °C [81]. For Cu/OMSA20, a shoulder located at 220 °C could originate from the reduction of residual CuO in weak interaction with the support. Experimental hydrogen consumptions are in good agreement with the theoretical consumptions calculated taking into account the elemental composition by ICP (15.5-16.2 cm3 g−1; ESI, Table S1). Up to 700 °C, the TPR profiles recorded for Cu/OMS, Cu/OMSA10 and Cu/OMSA20 essentially reflect the complete reduction of Cu2+ to Cu°. An exception may be made for Cu/OMA, for which the calculated reduction degree is 86 %. This could be in line with the presence of a residual, difficult-to-reduce, bulk copper aluminate phase. Finally, two TPR profiles were recorded after a first stage of reduction of Cu/OMSA20 under H2 for 10 h at 500 °C (Fig. 5c’ and c’’). After a subsequent exposure to N2O, the TPR profile exhibits a reduction peak at 170 °C associated to Cu+ surface oxidized species [31]. In contrast, when a TPR is performed immediately after reduction at 500 °C without exposure to air, no H2 consumption is detected. Copper is thus present in the metallic state after reduction for 10 h at 500 °C, which will be the reduction conditions before transfer into the reactor for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation."
10,Dispersion of copper active phase,"3.3 Dispersion of copper active phase The dispersion of metallic copper after reduction at 500 °C was determined by N2O titration [82–85]. Results are expressed as copper dispersion (DCu), average particle size (dCu), and metallic copper accessible surface area (SCu) (Table 2 ). The dispersion of copper and the associated metallic surface area both increase with the aluminium content in OMSA. In particular, the values found for Cu/OMSA20 are very similar to those obtained for Cu/OMA, confirming that the characteristics of Cu particles on OMSA20 are close to those on mesoporous alumina."
11,Catalytic properties,"3.4 Catalytic properties The catalytic properties of the copper-based reduced catalysts were evaluated in the liquid phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CNA). As shown in Scheme 1 , this process involves parallel and consecutive reactions, with the possible formation of partially hydrogenated molecules (hydrocinnamaldehyde - HCNA; cinnamyl alcohol - CNOL) and of a fully hydrogenated product (hydrocinnamyl alcohol - HCNOL). It was verified under N2 atmosphere that no hydrogen was transferred from the isopropanol solvent to cinnamaldehyde. Cu/OMS shows a very low activity (∼9 %) after 6 h of reaction (Fig. 6 A). This is related to the poor dispersion of copper and consequently to a low exposed active surface [28,36]. Activity increases with the increase of Cu exposed surface area (Table 2), and thus with the aluminium content in the support. Cu/OMSA10 and Cu/OMSA20 leads to CNA conversions of ∼48 and ∼80 % after 6 h of reaction, respectively. Interestingly, the activity obtained for the Cu/OMA catalyst is essentially similar to that of Cu/OMSA20, despite the fact that Cu/OMA exhibits a slightly higher Cu° surface area. At maximum conversion (9 %), the OMS-supported catalyst exhibited selectivities to CNOL, HCNA and HCNOL of 44, 49 and 7 %, respectively. Fig. 6B–D display the selectivities to CNOL, HCNA and HCNOL, respectively, as a function of conversion for the OMSA and OMA-supported systems. The dominant product at low conversion (9–12 %) is that resulting from the hydrogenation of the CO bond, namely CNOL: selectivity of 50 % for Cu/OMSA10, 62 % for Cu/OMSA20, 64 % for Cu/OMA, in all cases higher than that measured for Cu/OMS at the same conversion, and increasing with the content in Al. At any conversion below 40 %, the selectivity to CNOL increases and that to HCNA, resulting from the hydrogenation of the CC bond, decreases when more aluminium is incorporated. These results clearly indicate that the hydrogenation of the CO bond is initially preferred over that of the CC bond on Cu/OMSA20 and Cu/OMA. The selectivity to HCNOL, the total hydrogenation product, lies in the range 8–20 % with no influence of the amount of aluminium. Selectivities to CNOL decrease with increasing conversion (41, 47 and 51 % measured for Cu/OMSA10, Cu/OMSA20 and Cu/OMA, respectively, at XCNA = 40 %; down to ∼30 % at XCNA ∼80 %), while the selectivity to HCNOL increases. As the selectivity to HCNA remains essentially constant at XCNA > 40 % for all catalysts, such evolution of selectivity may indicate that in a second stage the adsorption of the CC unsaturated alcohol (CNOL) predominates over that of CC saturated aldehyde (HCNA), leading to a further conversion to the saturated alcohol (HCNOL). The reusability of Cu/OMSA20 solid was assessed upon three catalytic runs, with intermediate stages of calcination at 500 °C and reduction under H2 at 500 °C (ESI, Fig. S8). A minor decrease in activity and essentially unchanged selectivities were noticed, demonstrating the stability of the catalyst synthesized on OMSA20. In the literature, the production of CNOL has been related to the existence of Cu+ ionic species [31,39]. In the present case, XPS and TPR seem to rule out the presence of a significant amount of Cu+ species on the better dispersed catalyst. Chambers et al. also reported that 18 nm Cu particles enhance CNOL selectivity [35]. In our case, the OMS-supported catalyst (large Cu particles, 31.5 nm) exhibits similar selectivities to CNOL and HCNA, at a low level of conversion (9 %). In contrast, Rudolf et al. showed that the size of small nanoparticles of metallic copper (2.3–6 nm), when supported on a mesoporous silica, did not influence the adsorption of CNA, and that a low selectivity to CNOL (<5 % for a conversion of 40 %) was obtained for all catalysts [30]. As a consequence, we will suppose that it is the alumina-rich support surface that ensures a high activity and favours the hydrogenation of the CO bond on small Cu particles, with respect to that of the CC bond (selectivity to CNOL between 60 and 80 % at conversion < 10 %, between 50 and 60 % at conversion = 30 %). Gutierrez et al. reported selectivities to CNOL on alumina-supported Cu catalysts very close to the values obtained here on Cu/OMA and Cu/OMSA20 (51 % at a conversion of 30 %), but on larger and less dispersed copper particles (6−19 nm, compared to the values evaluated here, 3−4 nm) [39]. The TOF value calculated from our results on Cu/OMSA20 (6 10−3 s−1 at 110 °C) compares well with the TOF values given for their most active Cu catalysts in similar experimental conditions (5–7 10−3 s−1 at 100 °C in isopropanol). In two instances from the literature in which Cu was highly dispersed on Al-containing supports, selectivities to CNOL were also found to be similar to ours (selectivity to CNOL = 47–53 % at a conversion of 30 %, 36–38 % at a conversion of 60 % [36]; selectivity to CNOL = 55 % at a conversion of 35 % [43]). By comparison with the literature, we thus suggest that surface Lewis acidic sites brought by the introduction of aluminium species, and in the close vicinity of the metallic Cu sites, are involved in the adsorption of CNA molecules via the polar CO bond [52], as also observed for other systems, like Rh supported on oxides such as TiOx, VOx, ZrOx [86], Pt on supports manifesting SMSI effects (TiO2) [87], or bimetallic catalysts containing one of the metallic elements in a cationic state [88]. That a small amount of undetected Cu+ species located at the interface between the small Cu particles and the support also play a similar role in the reaction cannot however be excluded."
12,Conclusions,"Al-SBA-15 mesoporous silica-alumina materials with high Al content were used as supports for copper NPs. Al was incorporated during the synthesis of the SBA-15 support following a two-step pH-adjustment method, and Cu was introduced by a standard incipient wetness impregnation procedure using an aqueous solution of copper nitrate. Reference samples were prepared by using ordered mesoporous silica and alumina supports. The results evidenced that a significant gain in copper NPs dispersion was achieved over the aluminium containing supports, with a dispersion enhancement from <5 % (when copper is dispersed over silica support) up to >25 % (when copper is dispersed over an aluminium-rich support). The water-stable SBA-15 support containing 20 wt% of alumina displays a dispersing effect similar to a pure mesoporous alumina support, on which impregnation with aqueous solutions cannot be carried out owing to a lack of stability when exposed to water. The stabilization of copper over aluminium-rich supports is suggested to stem from CuAl2O4 species generated during thermal treatment. In line with the high exposed metallic area, Cu-based catalysts on aluminium-rich supports (20 wt% alumina and pure alumina) showed a high activity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde in liquid phase. Compared to Cu/SBA-15, these catalysts also exhibited a high selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, showing a preferential hydrogenation of the CO bond up to a conversion of around 50 %. Hence, our results show as a proof-of-concept that the introduction of aluminium into the SBA-15 silica has multiple consequences: stabilization of copper as highly dispersed NPs on the internal surface of the mesopores, and improvement of both the activity and selectivity of the monometallic copper catalysts by promoting dispersion and changing the adsorption mode of CNA molecules onto the catalyst surface."
