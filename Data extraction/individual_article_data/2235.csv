0,Introduction,"Because of obvious drawbacks such as fluctuating costs, geo-political issues, and heterogeneous distribution around the world associated with the use of fossil feedstocks (crude oil, coal, natural gas, etc.), it has become necessary to look for alternate feedstocks. In view of this, biomass which is renewable and available in abundance can be useful, particularly to synthesize the chemicals. In the last couple of years, lignocellulosic biomass consisting of three main components, cellulose (ca. 50%), hemicellulose (ca. 30%) and lignin (ca. 20%) is considered as an excellent feedstock for the chemicals synthesis because of no food value attached to it. While, cellulose is a homopolysaccharide made up of glucose; hemicelluloses are of various types and based on their composition are named as, xylan (polysaccharide of xylose), arabinogalactan (arabinose, galactose), glucomannan (glucose, mannose), etc. Lignin, whose primary function is to protect the cell wall from microbial attacks is highly branched, complex polymer made up of aromatic monomers. Besides cellulose and hemicelluloses, inulin is another frequently occurring polysaccharide in the plants which is mainly composed of fructose. The conversions of these polysaccharides into wide range of industrially important chemicals such as, glucose, fructose, xylose, arabinose, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, glycols, etc. has been reported in the literature (Rinaldi and Schüth, 2009; Kim and Lee, 1988; Sahu and Dhepe, 2012; Wang and Zhang, 2013). One of the imperative classes of the biomass derived chemicals is sugar alcohols. Polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, inulin, etc.) are typically hydrolyzed using acidic catalysts into corresponding monomer sugars and these sugars can further undergo hydrogenation reactions in the presence of supported metal catalysts to yield sugar alcohols. Several reports claim, the development of one pot method for the conversion of cellulose and glucose into sugar alcohols (sorbitol and mannitol) over supported metal catalysts (Tathod et al., 2014; Dhepe and Fukuoka, 2007). However, compared to this, very few reports show conversion of hemicelluloses, inulin and agricultural wastes into sugar alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts. It is reported that conversion of hemicelluloses like xylan, arabinogalactan, arabinan into sugar alcohols i.e. xylitol, arabitol, galactitol, etc. is possible over Ru/C and Ru/MCM-48 catalysts (Yi and Zhang, 2012; Kusema et al., 2012; Guha et al., 2011). Hydrolysis of inulin using acidic zeolite LZ-M-8 to yield fructose (Abasaeed and Lee, 1995) and its further conversion into sugar alcohol (mannitol+sorbitol) using Ru/C catalyst is also shown (Heinen et al., 2001). Nevertheless, only handful of reports discuss the use of untreated agricultural wastes instead of isolated polysaccharide, in the production of sugars and furans (Dhepe and Sahu, 2010; Sahu and Dhepe, 2012). Conversion of bagasse and beet fibers to yield sugar alcohols has been reported in the recent past (Yi and Zhang, 2012; Guha et al., 2011). The development of ‘Biofine’ and ‘Mascal’ methods is known for the efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into levulinic acid and ethyl levulinate in the presence of mineral acids (H2SO4, HCl) and organic solvents (ethanol, dichloroethane) (Hayes et al., 2008; Mascal and Nikitin, 2010). However, use of corrosive acids and highly volatile and halogenated solvents may hamper its commercial applications. It is estimated that India produces ca. 342 MMT of sugarcane, ca. 158 MMT of rice and ca. 86 MMT of wheat per annum and the production of these crops is increasing along the years (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-ateway/go/to/download/Q/QC/E). Considering this, huge amounts of agricultural wastes (bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw, etc.) generated from these crops, which are typically lignocellulosic materials can be used for the production of chemicals and particularly, in the production of sugar alcohols. Nonetheless, development of efficient catalytic methods to achieve better yields for sugar alcohols formation from variety of substrates like monomer sugars, polysaccharides (hemicelluloses, inulin, etc.) and agricultural wastes is essential. Sugar alcohols, sorbitol and xylitol are named in the list of “top value added chemicals obtained from biomass” prepared by US DOE, which underlines the significance of these sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are extensively used as low calorie sweeteners and find application in oral hygiene products. Sorbitol is used in humectants and applications of xylitol are well known in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries (Mikkola and Salmi, 2001). Researchers have also investigated the possibility of the production of hydrogen from sugar alcohols using supported metal catalysts (Davda and Dumesic, 2004). Furthermore, conversion of sugar alcohols into chemicals such as 1,4-sorbitan, sorbose, isosorbide, glycols, lactic acid, vitamin C, etc. has been studied (Sun and Liu, 2011; De Wulf et al., 2000). Mannitol is used clinically for its osmotic diuretic properties and in the treatment of cerebral oedema (Shawkat et al., 2012). Because of the wide range of applications of sugar alcohols in various industries, demand for those is increasing incessantly (Yadav et al., 2012). Considering the importance of sugar alcohols, conversion of sugars and polysaccharides into sugar alcohols using supported metal catalysts is studied comprehensively and among all the supported metal catalysts, Pt and Ru based catalysts are shown to perform much better and hence are used quite often (Yi and Zhang, 2012; Yadav et al., 2012). It is well known that in the hydrogenation reactions, the activity of the supported metal catalysts can be enhanced by the addition of promoter metal(s). Generally, along with Pt and Ru metals, promoters such as Ga, Fe and Sn are combined since they have a tendency to remain in electron deficient state which helps in achieving higher carbonyl group hydrogenation activity by way of polarizing the carbonyl group (Marinelli et al., 1995). However, among all the bimetallic catalysts known for hydrogenation, Pt–Sn bimetallic catalytic system is interesting in regards with understanding the effects of concentration of promoter, metal-promoter interaction, metal-support interaction and mechanistic studies (Torres et al., 1999; Homs et al., 2001). Herein, the synthesis of Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts and comparison of their activities with monometallic Pt catalysts in the conversion of wide range of substrates like C5 sugars (xylose and arabinose), C6 sugars (glucose, galactose and fructose), hemicelluloses (xylan and arabinogalactan), inulin and agricultural wastes (bagasse, rice husk and wheat straw) to yield sugar alcohols (sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, arabitol, etc.) is reported."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The supported metal catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method using γ-Al2O3 (AL) and Carbon black pearl-BP2000 (C) supports. Prior to catalyst preparation, supports were evacuated at 150°C for 6h under vacuum (−700Torr). As per the requirement of wt% loading of metal, quantities of metal precursor solutions (10wt% aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and SnCl2·2H2O solution in 3M HCl) were drop wise added under stirring to the support (suspended in water). Mixture was stirred for 16h at room temperature (30°C). Next, solvent was removed by rotary vacuum evaporator and obtained powder was then dried at 60°C for 12h in oven and at 150°C for 3h under vacuum. In case where AL is used as support, completely dried powder was subjected to calcination (at 400°C for 2h in a flow of oxygen, 20mL/min) and reduction (in a hydrogen flow, 20mL/min at 400°C for 2h). Catalysts in which C (carbon) is used as a support, were directly reduced without calcination (in a hydrogen flow, 20mL/min at 400°C for 2h). Pt/AL, PtSn/AL, Pt/C and PtSn/C catalysts were prepared by keeping Pt loading of 2wt% and Sn loading of 0.25wt% i.e. Pt(2)/AL (2wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3), Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL (2wt% Pt-0.25wt% Sn/γ-Al2O3), Pt(2)/C (2wt% Pt/Carbon) and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C (2wt% Pt-0.25wt% Sn/Carbon). Other than these catalysts, acidified-Pt(2)/AL catalyst (2wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 acidified by adding HCl during synthesis) was prepared. In a typical synthesis process, aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (quantity according to 2wt% loading of Pt) and 3M HCl (quantity equals to the quantity of 3M HCl used to prepare Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL) were added to AL and the mixture was stirred for 16h. Rest of the catalyst preparation procedure was same as explained above."
3,Catalytic test,"2.2 Catalytic test All the catalytic reactions were carried out in a batch mode autoclave with a 50mL capacity (Amar Equipments, India). In all the reactions, substrate/catalyst ratio was kept constant as 2wt/wt (0.15g substrate and 0.075g catalyst were taken in 35mL of water). After charging the autoclave with substrate, catalyst and water, H2 was fed in the reactor with 16bar pressure (at room temperature). Reaction mixture was stirred at 150rpm until desired reaction temperature is reached and after that stirring was increased to 900rpm. This time was considered as starting time of the reaction. Experiments were carried out in a temperature range of 110–200°C, for various reaction times (15min–16h). Up on completion of reaction, autoclave was cooled to room temperature under the flow of air. The gas was vent off and the reaction mixture was collected. Catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the liquid was filtered through 0.22μm syringe filter and was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)."
4,Analysis of reaction mixture,"2.3 Analysis of reaction mixture Reaction mixture was analyzed using HPLC (Agilent Technologies, 1200 infinity series, USA) equipped with HC-75 Pb++ (Hamilton, 7.8mm×300mm) column maintained at 80°C. Water at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min was used as an eluent. Refractive index detector (RID, Agilent Technologies, 1200 infinity series, cell temperature, 40°C) was used for the detection of compounds. Another HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, 1200 infinity series, USA) equipped with HC-75 H+ (Phenomenex, 7.8×300mm) column (at 60°C) was also used to analyze the products. Sulfuric acid (0.5mmol) was used as an eluent (0.6mL/min) and for the detection of products, RID (Agilent Technologies, 1200 infinity series, cell temperature, 40°C) was used. Calibration curves were drawn for all the compounds using standard compounds obtained commercially. Quantification of oligomers was performed by drawing calibration curve using standard containing oligomers having degree of polymerization (DP) of 2<DP<7). HPLC equipped with Pb++ column was used for the quantification of oligomers, sugars, sugar alcohols and furfural. For the analysis of glycols (glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, ethylene glycol), levulinic acid and furfuryl alcohol, HPLC system equipped with H+ column is used. For the details on the calculations of conversions and yields please refer Supplementary data."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The support material, γ-Al2O3 (AL) had a surface area of 179m2/g, determined by N2 sorption technique. With the impregnation of metals on AL to synthesize Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts, decrease in the surface area to 157 and 164m2/g was seen. Another support material, carbon black pearl-BP2000 (C) had a surface area of 997m2/g while C supported catalysts, Pt(2)/C and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C had surface areas of 958 and 966m2/g, respectively. To check the effect of Pt and Sn loading on the acidity of the support (AL, C), NH3-TPD study was undertaken (please refer Supplementary data for TPD program. As observed in Fig. S1A ( Supplementary data ), TPD profile for AL support showed one broad peak at 180°C, which can be assigned to the presence of weak acid sites (0.4mmol/g) on AL. However, after impregnation of Pt and PtSn on AL, sharp decrease in the peak intensity was seen. A careful observation suggests that in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst a new peak appears between 350 and 550°C may be due to the presence of Sn as Sn+δ species (Lewis acid site). From this analysis, total acid amount was calculated and it was observed that after impregnation of metal(s) on the AL, the total acid amount was decreased from 0.4mmol/g (AL) to 0.24mmol/g (Pt(2)/AL) and 0.22mmol/g (Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL). This is obvious since it is expected that during the synthesis of catalysts, Pt and Sn will interact with the acidic sites of AL. On the contrary, carbon supported catalysts, Pt(2)/C and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C do not show any major peak (Fig. S1B, Supplementary data) since support (C) itself do not have any acidity. Though, a very low intensity peak between 400 and 500°C is observed in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst, which may arise because of possible presence of Sn+δ species, the calculation of acid amount based on this peak was almost impossible. Yet, the intensity of this peak was too low compared to the peak observed in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst which indicates that, if at all Sn is present in +δ state its concentration in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst is more than Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst. For comparison purpose, NH3-TPD study for Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst was performed and the profile shows a very low intensity peak at 400–500°C (Fig. S1A, Supplementary data) due to presence of Sn+δ species. Here also, decrease in the peak intensity for AL was seen which imply that Sn may interact with AL and thus reduce the amount of acid sites on AL. Based on the NH3-TPD study, it can be concluded that Sn interacts with the acid sites on AL to decrease their concentration (Bacaud et al., 1981) and also forms new type of acid sites which may be assigned to the formation of Lewis acid sites. With the help of ICP-AES technique, determination of the metal contents of the monometallic Pt(2)/AL, Pt(2)/C, acidified-Pt(2)/AL and bimetallic Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL, Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalysts was done. The results indicate that the expected loading and actual loading of metal on the support were in close proximity (±4% error based on actual loadings). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL depict that in both the catalysts, Pt is present in the metallic state and do not form alloy or intermetallic system (Fig. S2A, Supplementary data). In both the catalysts, characteristic peaks for Pt at 2θ o =39.8, 46.3, 67.5, 81.3 and 85.8 were observed and are assigned to planes (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222), respectively (JCPDS file No. 01-088-2343). In case of bimetallic catalyst, peaks for PtSn or Pt3Sn species were not seen (JCPDS file No. 25-0614 and 35-1360, respectively) indicating that Pt and Sn might be present as separate species. On the contrary, when Pt(2)/C and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalysts were subjected to XRD analysis (Fig. S2B, Supplementary data), even with lower concentration of Sn (0.25wt%), peaks due to PtSn alloy formation are clearly visible (JCPDS file No. 25-0614).Using TEM technique, the particle size distribution of Pt in monometallic and bimetallic catalyst was calculated to be around 20–30nm and 10–20nm, respectively. The oxidation state of Sn in the AL supported PtSn catalyst was checked by XPS analysis. The Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectrum of the catalyst showed peak at 486.6eV, which is assigned to the oxidized species of Sn (II or IV). As the difference in the binding energies for Sn (II) and Sn (IV) is very small, it was very difficult to distinguish between these two species by XPS studies (Lima et al., 2010). It is shown in the literature that even after reducing the catalyst at high temperatures, Sn supported on AL, remains in higher oxidation state (Baronetti et al., 1986) and the same observation is done in this study since catalyst was reduced under hydrogen flow at 400°C for 2h but still Sn is present in the ionic state. The similar observation of presence of Sn in higher oxidation state (II or IV) was made during NH3-TPD study (Fig. S1A, Supplementary data). Characterization of the spent catalyst recovered from the xylan reaction was done to understand the effect of reaction condition (190°C, 16h) on the catalyst. For the characterization of the spent catalyst, it was recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and subjected to various characterizations without calcination and reduction. ICP-AES analysis of spent Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst and reaction mixture confirmed negligible leaching of Pt from the catalyst (0.21ppm), but no leaching of Sn was seen. XRD pattern of spent catalyst (Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL used in the conversion of xylan (190°C, 16h) shows extra peaks at 2θ o =26.3 and 54.5 other than observance of characteristic peaks for Pt. These extra peaks can be assigned to the impurities such as unconverted substrate or any side product(s) adsorbed on the catalyst surface, which can affect the activity of catalyst (Fig. S2A, Supplementary data). Moreover, TEM analysis of the spent catalyst depicts that there is no significant change in the particle size of metal after use."
7,Hydrogenation of C5 and C6 sugars,"3.2 Hydrogenation of C5 and C6 sugars First, Pt(2)/AL monometallic and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL bimetallic catalysts were evaluated to check their catalytic activities in the hydrogenation of C5 (xylose and arabinose) and C6 (glucose, galactose and fructose) sugars. As observed from Table 1 , with the change of catalyst from monometallic, Pt(2)/AL to bimetallic, Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst, enhancements in the conversion of xylose was possible from 67% to 97% at 130°C. It is important to note that along with the increase in conversion, bimetallic catalyst also improved the yields obtained for sugar alcohols to 91% (xylose as substrate) and 93% (arabinose as substrate) from 37% (xylose as substrate) and 43% (arabinose as substrate) observed with monometallic Pt(2)/AL catalyst. A careful observation also suggests that, over monometallic catalyst, higher amount of furfural and glycols formation was possible compared to bimetallic catalyst. The decrease in the glycols (glycerol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol) yield on bimetallic catalysts explains that their formation may occur directly from xylose since if glycols are formed from sugar alcohols then in bimetallic catalytic system their yield should have been higher since high concentration of sugar alcohols were available in the reaction mixture compared to monometallic catalyst. To check the stability of sugar alcohols under reaction conditions and to know whether glycols were obtained from the sugar alcohols, reactions with xylitol over Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL were carried out at 130°C for 120min. The results imply that sugar alcohols were stable under reaction conditions since only 2–4% of glycols were formed with ca. 5% conversions. These results confirm that the formation of glycols may possibly occur from sugars. When hydrogenation reactions of C5 sugars were carried out at 190°C, similar trend of product formation was observed i.e. increase in sugar alcohols yields and suppression of undesired product formation (glycols, furfural) over bimetallic Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts (Table 1). To check the effect of support on the hydrogenation activity at 190°C, Pt(2)/C and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C were evaluated in the conversion of xylose under similar conditions. While, over Pt(2)/C catalyst, 15.5% yield of sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) with 71% conversion was obtained, Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst yielded 22% of sugar alcohols (65% conversion) (Table 1). These results indicate that there is no considerable improvement in the yield of sugar alcohols when Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C was used instead of Pt(2)/C catalyst. Contrary to this as mentioned above, in case of AL supported catalysts, substantial increase in the activity of bimetallic catalyst (73%) is evident over monometallic catalyst (28%) when reactions were done under similar conditions (190°C, 15min, Table 1). Moreover, with the similar Pt and Sn loading on C and AL support, higher activity with Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst (73%) was observed compared with Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst (22%). Hence for the conversions of all other substrates Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts were used. It should be noted here that with the increase in temperature to 190°C, lower amount of sugar alcohols and higher amount of glycols were formed compared to reactions done at 130°C (Table 1). This means that, higher temperatures are not favorable for sugar alcohols formation from C5 sugars. To understand this phenomenon and to know whether formation of side products (glycols) in higher concentration at higher temperature is from xylitol, stability studies of xylitol were conducted at 190°C. However, only 5–8% of xylitol conversion to glycols was observed, which imply that xylitol is stable under reaction conditions and that formation of glycols is possible directly from sugars. Based on the above discussions, it is suggest that at higher temperatures there is a possibility of enhancement of the rate of xylose to glycols reaction (as in non catalytic reaction at 190°C, 12.8% yield of glycols was obtained) and hence lower yields for sugar alcohols were obtained at 190°C compared to 130°C. The xylose hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 190°C using S/C ratio of 4 (wt/wt) instead of 2 to check whether lower loading at higher temperatures show improved activity for sugar alcohols formation as it is anticipated that with higher loading side reactions may prevail. Additionally, use of lower quantity of the catalysts would be favorable to commercialize the process. When 0.038g of Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst was used, slight decrease in the sugar alcohols yield (66%) was seen compared to 0.075g catalyst (73%) (Table S1, Supplementary data). Though, catalyst loading was decreased by half, only slight decrease in the yields was seen which indicates that, it is possible to carry out the reactions even with lower catalyst concentrations. However, to achieve better activity with lower concentration of catalyst was not successful. Considering this, all other experiments were carried out with 0.075g catalyst i.e. S/C ratio of 2 (wt/wt) because it showed higher activity than 0.038g catalyst loading. The results presented in Table 1 indicate that formation of furans (furfural and furfuryl alcohol) was possible even in the absence of catalyst (11.6%). However, it is interesting to note that over Pt(2)/C catalyst similar yield for furans (13%) was seen as observed in non-catalytic reaction but, it was less than the yield observed over Pt(2)/AL catalyst (20%). It is suggested that, this difference in the furans yield between C and AL supported catalyst is due to the presence of acidic sites on AL (0.4mmol/g, Fig. S1A, Supplementary data) those can catalyze dehydration reactions of sugars to yield furans. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that, after incorporation of Sn in the Pt(2)/AL catalyst, formation of furan compounds was almost suppressed (1%). However, same was not true with Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst (11%). The difference in the activity between Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst was possibly due to the availability of higher number of metallic sites in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL (average particle size, 15nm) catalyst than monometallic catalyst (average particle size, 25nm). Based on the above explanation it was expected that for both the catalysts similar TOF (turn over frequency) should be observed as only factor playing role is availability of active sites. However, difference in the TOF for Pt(2)/AL (10.26min−1) and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL (14.5min−1) suggest that besides increase in active sites some other factors were also playing role in enhancing the sugar alcohols formation. It is reported in the literature (Dautzenberg et al., 1980) that Sn interacts with the acidic sites of AL to form a complex and this in turn may decrease the number of acid sites in the catalyst. In this work also, based on the XRD, NH3-TPD and XPS analysis, it is proved that in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst (0.22mmol/g), less number of acid sites are present compared to Pt(2)/AL (0.24mmol/g). The above discussions reveal that to obtain higher yields of sugar alcohols over Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst, increase in number of metallic sites and suppression of acidic sites are helpful. Another important factor which can influence the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalyst is the oxidation state of the promoter (Sn). Oxidation states of metals in bimetallic catalysts and their effects on the catalytic activity have been studied and it is shown that with the presence of electron deficient promoters, better hydrogenation activity can be achieved (Burch, 1981; Muller et al., 1979). In current work, XPS study proved that Sn is present in ionic state (+II or +IV) in Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL bimetallic catalyst. Sn in ionic state is known to promote the activity of the catalyst in hydrogenation reactions (Burch, 1981) by way of polarizing CO bond of carbonyl group (Homs et al., 2001). Because of interaction with AL, Sn was not reduced to ‘0’ state and thus remains in (+II) or (+IV) oxidation states (XPS). Ionic Sn thus formed, interacts with the CO bond of carbonyl group present in sugar molecules to polarize it. At the same time, splitting of H2 occurs on the Pt metal and H+ and H- are generated which can easily hydrogenate the polarized CO bond of carbonyl group of sugars. In this way, Sn can speed up the hydrogenation reaction of sugars. Since, AL supported catalysts show acidity which is almost not observed with C supported catalysts, AL supported catalysts were capable of isomerizing xylose to yield arabinose which in turn gives rise to arabitol. It was also possible that once xylitol was obtained from xylose, it could undergo acid catalyzed epimerization reaction to yield arabitol over AL supported catalysts. The catalytic performances of Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL were also evaluated in the hydrogenation of C6 sugars i.e. glucose, galactose and fructose at 190°C and 130°C (Table 2 ). Analogous to the results obtained with C5 sugars (Table 1), C6 sugars also showed improvement in the sugar alcohols (sorbitol, galactitol, mannitol) yields with the use of bimetallic catalyst, Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL compared to monometallic Pt(2)/AL catalyst. It was observed that maximum of 84% sugar alcohols (sorbitol+mannitol) yield can be obtained from glucose while with fructose as a substrate maximum of 90% yield was achievable at 130°C. As expected, with fructose as a substrate high concentration of mannitol (50%) was possible as against high concentration of sorbitol formation seen in case of glucose as substrate. Because of acidic nature of AL, it was capable of epimerizing sugar alcohols to yield mannitol and sorbitol. However, it was surprising to note here that when glucose is used as substrate, concentration of mannitol was not higher which suggest that either isomerization of glucose to yield fructose or epimerization of sorbitol to yield mannitol was restrictive. However, sorbitol and mannitol stability study performed under similar reaction conditions did not show much conversion (ca. 5%) and hence it is suggested that in the presence of AL preferably, glucose and fructose undergo isomerization reactions. Moreover the isomerization of fructose to glucose is faster than glucose to fructose formation since in fructose reaction higher amount of sorbitol (hydrogenation product of glucose) was formed but when glucose was used as a substrate, formation of mannitol (hydrogenation product of fructose) was less. With galactose as a substrate, 80% yield for galactitol was seen at 130°C. In all the reactions, isomerization products of sugars and epimerization products of sugar alcohols were observed. Results obtained with C6 sugars at 190°C also showed lower carbon balance, which again confirms that from monomer sugars to achieve best possible yields for sugar alcohols and high carbon balance, lower temperatures would be preferred."
8,Hydrolytic hydrogenation of hemicelluloses (xylan and arabinogalactan) and inulin,"3.3 Hydrolytic hydrogenation of hemicelluloses (xylan and arabinogalactan) and inulin After observing enhancements in the yields of sugar alcohols from C5 and C6 sugars using Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL bimetallic catalyst compared to the Pt(2)/AL monometallic catalyst it was decided to evaluate activities of these catalysts in the conversion of three different polysaccharides namely, xylan (polysaccharide of xylose), arabinogalactan (polysaccharide of galactose and arabinose) and inulin (polysaccharide of fructose). To find out the optimized reaction conditions (to obtain highest sugar alcohols yields) with all the three substrates, initially reactions with Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL were carried out at 170, 180, 190 and 200°C. Below 170°C no catalytic activity for sugar alcohols formation was observed in case of xylan substrate and above 200°C reaction temperature, coke/char formation was visible with all the substrates. Interestingly, Inulin could show activity even at 100°C. Further, reactions with all the substrates were done with both the catalysts for varying time periods viz. 8, 10, 12, 16 and 20h to realize the optimum time where maximum sugar alcohol yields are possible. In the study, it was found that with xylan as a substrate, at 190°C and within 16h maximum of 15.5% yield for sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) could be obtained using Pt(2)/AL catalyst whereas over Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst, 43% yield was obtained (Fig. 1 A). Compared to this, non catalytic reaction showed 12.5% sugar alcohols yield (Fig. 1A). The reactions carried out with arabinogalactan at 180°C for 12h showed 25% and 47% of sugar alcohols (galactitol+arabitol) yields over Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts, respectively (Fig. 1B). Under similar reaction conditions, without catalyst, 15% yield of sugar alcohols was observed. Surprisingly, in the case of inulin as a substrate, maximum sugar alcohols formation was observed when reactions were done at 110°C for 12h. Inulin which is made up of fructose showed total sugar alcohols yields of 40% with Pt(2)/AL catalyst but improvement in yield to 77% was seen over Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst (Fig. 1C). With all the three substrates, other than sugar alcohols, formation of glycols (glycerol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol), levulinic acid, furfural, furfuryl alcohol and oligomers was also observed however, the yields of these products were dependent on the catalyst and substrate used (Fig. 1)."
9,"Conversion of agricultural wastes (bagasse, rice husk and wheat straw) into sugar alcohols","3.4 Conversion of agricultural wastes (bagasse, rice husk and wheat straw) into sugar alcohols Because, very high yields of sugar alcohols were achieved over bimetallic Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst from sugars and isolated polysaccharides it was thought of extending this catalytic system to synthesize sugar alcohols from agricultural waste. In this work, three different substrates such as, bagasse, rice husk and wheat straw were used without any pre-treatment. It is known that during growth, crops use various nutrients and since no pre-treatment besides washing these materials with cold water was given prior to reaction, the presence of any metals on these substrates was checked by ICP-AES study. Besides this, to quantify the products formed; these materials were characterized by Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) method to understand the composition (hollocellulose, pentosan, lignin, ash). The details on the results on both these characterization are summarized in Table S2 (Supplementary data). All the three substrates were subjected for the reactions at 140, 150, 160, 170, 180 and 190°C for different time durations (8 to 20h) to find out the optimum reaction conditions at which highest sugar alcohols yields can be obtained. In case of bagasse, at 160°C within 16h, 43% and 72% yields for C5 sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) were obtained with Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts, respectively (Fig. 2 ). With the increase in temperature to 170, 180 or 190°C, no increase in the sugar alcohols yield was observed. When instead of bagasse, rice husk was used as a substrate and the reaction was performed at 160°C for 12h, 32% yield of C5 sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) was obtained over Pt(2)/AL catalyst. Improvement in the yield to 60% was seen when bimetallic, Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst was used under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 2). The similar trend of increase in C5 sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) yield from 29% to 49% was observed with Pt(2)/AL and Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts, respectively with wheat straw as a substrate (Fig. 2). In all these reactions, 16–26% substrate conversions were observed (please refer Supplementary data). To verify the effect of catalyst concentration on the sugar alcohols yield, when experiment was carried out with 0.038g of Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL and 0.15g bagasse (S/C=4wt/wt) at 160°C for 16h, decrease in the sugar alcohols yield to 56% was observed (Table S1, Supplementary data). With the decrease in the sugar alcohols yield, increase in the side products formation was seen, which implies that side reactions becomes predominant (glycols, furans) under thermal conditions (Table S1). To check whether with the increase in time sugar alcohol yield can be enhanced, reaction was done for 24h but still marginal increase in the yield (61%) was achieved. The bimetallic Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst may possess the residual acidity because at the time of catalyst preparation, Sn precursor (SnCl2·2H2O) was dissolved in 3M HCl. Although catalysts were calcined and reduced at 400°C, complete removal of HCl cannot be ensured. To check whether PtSn/AL catalyst posses such acidity, silver nitrate test was performed and it was confirmed that catalyst posses some Cl−. To study the effect of residual acidity on the conversion of sugars and polysaccharides to sugar alcohols, acidified Pt(2)/AL catalyst (please refer catalyst preparation) was prepared and the reactions were carried out with this catalyst. However, before reactions, presence of Cl− on the catalyst was confirmed by silver nitrate test. The catalytic activity of this catalyst was evaluated in xylose and xylan reactions. When xylose reaction was performed at 190°C for 15min using acidified Pt(2)/AL catalyst, 26% yield for sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) was observed which was similar to the yield obtained with Pt(2)/AL catalyst (28%). Similarly, when acidified Pt(2)/AL was evaluated in the conversion of xylan at 190°C for 16h, 17% yield of sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) was obtained which is comparable with the yield obtained using Pt(2)/AL catalyst (15.5%). These results prove that the enhanced yields of sugar alcohols over Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalysts in various reactions (using different substrates) were because of addition of Sn and not because of residual acidity."
10,Catalyst reuse study,"3.5 Catalyst reuse study To understand the stability, catalyst reuse studies were done with the Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst using all the substrates. While carrying out reuse studies, similar reaction conditions were used where for each substrate best possible sugar alcohols yields were obtained. After each catalytic run, catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and then washed with water. This wet catalyst, without taking weight was directly used in the next catalytic run. The catalyst showed good reusability up to 4th run in the hydrogenation reactions of xylose and galactose performed at 190°C. The slight decrease (1st run: 73%, 2nd run: 72%, 3rd run: 70%, 4th run: 68% in xylose conversion and 1st run: 75%, 2nd run: 74.5%, 3rd run: 73.5%, 4th run: 72.5% in galactose conversion) in yield of sugar alcohols after each run was blamed on the loss of catalyst during separation and washing steps. Likewise, catalyst reuse study with xylan was done at 190°C (16h), with arabinogalactan at 180°C (12h) and with inulin at 110°C (12h). While with xylan as a substrate, after each consecutive run ca. 8% loss in activity was observed (1st run: 43%, 2nd run: 34%, 3rd run: 26%), in case of arabinogalactan, loss was ca. 3% (1st run: 47%, 2nd run: 44%, 3rd run: 40%). When inulin was used as a substrate, in the 1st run, 77% yield was observed which later decreased to 70% and 55%. The slight decrease in the catalytic activity in subsequent reactions was because of handling loss of catalyst during recovery that disturbs the substrate/catalyst ratio. It is important to note here that when catalyst was recovered from bagasse and rice husk reactions after successful selective conversion of hemicelluloses into sugar alcohols; along with catalyst, water insoluble unreacted cellulose and lignin were also recovered as solids. Next, the recovered solid (containing catalyst, cellulose and lignin) was washed with water and without any other treatment was charged in the autoclave for next reaction. The results on the catalyst reuse study for bagasse and rice husk substrates showed decrease in the catalytic activity by ca. 10–12% with respect to the yield obtained in earlier run. The decrease in the activity in these reactions was natural since along with recovered catalyst, unreacted cellulose and lignin from earlier run were also charged in the reactor. This way in next run, addition to 0.15g (which was charged afresh) the total charged substrate (or solid) was higher compared to earlier run. This essentially changed the substrate to catalyst ratio and due to this there might have been decrease in the activity. To overcome this issue, catalyst reuse study was done using another method. Upon completion of bagasse reaction using Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst, reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the solid (catalyst+unconverted agricultural waste) and liquid. Solid was then washed with water and dried at 60°C for 12h and then at 120°C under vacuum for 3h. Dried solid was calcined at 550°C for 5h (in O2 flow, 20mL/min) to remove the unconverted part of substrate (cellulose and lignin). Later, catalyst was reduced at 400°C for 2h (in H2 flow 20mL/per min) to obtain Pt in metallic state which otherwise might be present in the higher oxidation state because of calcinations carried out at higher temperatures. Since now catalyst was free of any contamination, S/C ratio was maintained in the following experiments and it was believed that catalyst would show similar activity. However, when this catalyst [Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL] was used in the next reaction at 160°C for 16h, slight decrease (7–9% compared to earlier reaction yield) in the yield of C5 sugar alcohols (xylitol+arabitol) was observed. Nevertheless, this decrease in yield was less than the earlier procedure employed where total solid (catalyst and unreacted substrate) was used. Above discussed results highlight that Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL bimetallic catalyst gives better activity than Pt(2)/AL monometallic catalyst toward the conversion of sugars, polysaccharides and agricultural wastes into sugar alcohols. To realize the reason behind the enhanced yields of sugar alcohols and role of Sn in the promotion of the activity of Pt/AL catalyst toward hydrogenation, various properties of catalyst were correlated with the activity. It is recognized in the literature that, with the addition of Sn in optimum concentration, increase in the dispersion of Pt on AL support is possible. Consequently, with higher dispersion catalyst gives enhanced activity as dispersion is one of the important factors governing the activity of PtSn bimetallic catalyst (Seleznev et al., 1974). It is probable that Sn interacts with the AL support to form the surface shell which hampers the movement of Pt precursors on the support during calcination and reduction processes. This restriction of movement of metal in turn is responsible for the prevention of the sintering of Pt particles (Sexton et al., 1984). In this work, TEM analysis proved that Pt was well dispersed in bimetallic Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst (10–20nm) than in monometallic Pt(2)/AL catalyst (20–30nm). It is reported that there is a possibility of PtSn alloy formation when Sn is in higher concentration, which can reduce the surface area of Pt (Verbeek and Sachtler, 1976). However, from XRD patterns for bimetallic catalyst (Fig. S2A, Supplementary data) it was indicated that Pt is present in the metallic form and no alloy formation is observed on the bulk level. Nevertheless, it should be noted that since loading of Sn was too low (0.25%) even if Sn forms alloy with Pt, the peaks due to alloy in XRD may not be visible. But, in case of Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/C catalyst, formation of alloy was clearly visible from XRD analysis (Fig. S2B, Supplementary data). These results were in line with the NH3-TPD analysis of Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL catalyst, wherein observance of new peak possibly due to formation of Lewis acid sites (Sn+δ) was seen due to absence of alloy formation (Fig. S1A, Supplementary data). The XPS analysis data was also helpful in corroborating these facts. To conclude, all the above discussions proves that, when carbon is used as a support material, the interaction between support and Sn is not possible. Hence, tendency of Sn to form alloy with Pt was higher in this catalyst (Coloma et al., 1996) compared to AL supported catalysts. Therefore it is believed that even after addition of Sn to Pt/C catalyst, no much change in the catalytic activity was seen compared to Pt(2)/C catalyst. Nevertheless, with AL supported catalysts, drastic increase in the catalytic activity was achieved. Besides this, Sn in electron deficient state (II or IV) act as a Lewis acid site and hence can catalyze isomerization and epimerization reactions of sugars and sugar alcohols, respectively. In this context, researchers have studied the conversion of xylose to xylulose (isomer) and lyxose (epimer) using Sn-BEA (zeolite) catalyst (Choudhary et al., 2013). Similarly, isomerization and epimerization of glucose over Lewis acid catalyst (Sn containing zeolite, Sn-Beta catalyst) is also known (Román-Leshkov et al., 2010). However, in the current work formation of xylulose and lyxose could not be detected because under the reaction conditions these epimers and isomers were capable of undergoing fast conversions to yield sugar alcohols."
11,Conclusions,"From the results, it could be concluded that, after addition of Sn as a promoter to Pt(2)/AL catalyst, an enhancement (1.5–3times) in the formation of sugar alcohols from mono (xylose, arabinose, glucose, fructose, galactose) and polysaccharides (xylan, arabinogalactan, inulin) was possible. The Pt(2)Sn(0.25)/AL was also capable of converting agricultural waste (bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw) into sugar alcohols with high yields (49–72%). It is proposed that due to presence of Sn in the ionic form (Lewis acid) polarization of carbonyl group of sugars is possible, which in turn shows better hydrogenation activity."
