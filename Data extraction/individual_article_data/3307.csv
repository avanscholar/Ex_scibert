0,Global biogas production and utilization,"With rapid economic development, urbanization and population growth, global primary energy consumption grew by 2.9% in 2018, reaching 13.87 billion tonnes oil equivalent (BP, 2019). While over past decades, the world has been heavily dependent on fossil fuels (e.g., oil, coal and natural gas) as the main source of energy, fossil fuels are expected to be depleted within 200 years (Shafiee and Topal, 2009). In addition, large amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) are released during the burning of fossil fuels, causing serious environmental issues including global warming and climate change. For example, a new high of 136 billion tonnes of CO2 was calculated to be released into the atmosphere in 2018 caused by fossil fuels combustion (Le Quéré et al., 2018). Therefore, a renewable energy transition is required to alleviate the depletion of fossil fuels and dramatically reduce the global carbon footprint. In contrast to fossil fuels, biomass is a clean and renewable energy source with huge reserves. It is estimated that the total global production of biomass is approximately 150 billion metric tons annually (Balat and Ayar, 2005), however, much of the biomass ends up in waste streams, including sewage, food wastes, straw, stalks, horticulture residues, and livestock manure. The energy embedded in biomass can be recovered by anaerobic digestion (AD), a robust and widely applied bioprocess that converts waste organic carbon to biogas, an important biofuel with methane (CH4) as the main component. It has been estimated that at least 25% of all bioenergy can originate from biogas in the future (Holm-Nielsen et al., 2009). There are currently 130,000 small to large-scale digesters and 50 million micro-digesters in operation around the world (Jain, 2019). Even though the energy derived from current AD facilities is huge, only 1.6–2.2% of the potential of AD has been unlocked due to limitations in collection, storage and transport equipment systems (IRENA, 2019). If the majority of feedstocks could be sustainably captured, the AD process has the potential to generate 10,100 to 14,000 TWh of energy, equivalent to 6–9% of global primary energy consumption (IEA, 2018). Furthermore, by capturing carbon from various biomass, the AD process is potentially able to reduce 3000–4000 million metric tonnes of CO2, which is more than 10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission (Jain, 2019). In addition, the global biogas industry is experiencing extraordinary growth. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) statistics show that the quantity of global electricity generated from biogas in 2016 was twice as much as that in 2010 (IRENA, 2019). Therefore, biogas production from the AD process significantly contributes to not only energy supply, but also carbon emission reduction. Energy extraction and GHG mitigation via AD is particularly important for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which are large energy consumers and GHG emitters. For example, the electricity consumed by WWTPs in the United States comprises 3–4% of the country's total energy demand (WRF, 2013), while the cost of electricity accounts for over 30% of total costs at WWTPs nationally (USEPA, 2010). However, a large amount of energy is embedded in wastewater mainly in the form of sewage sludge, equivalent to around 13 MJ/kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) (Gandiglio et al., 2017). This is 3–5 times the amount of energy required for the overall wastewater treatment process (WERF, 2014). If all available wastewater is treated via AD globally, the generated biogas has the potential to provide 210 to 300 TWh of energy, equivalent to the energy demand of 27–38 million people (Jain, 2019). Therefore, efficient utilization of biogas from AD in WWTPs will enable a paradigm shift in wastewater treatment from an energy-consuming to an energy-neutral or energy-positive process, and accelerate the development of a green/circular economy for the water treatment industry. Europe is leading the world in biogas production and utilization, with 17,783 biogas plants, an annual yield of ~30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of biogas, and 63,511 GWh of electricity generated from biogas in 2018 (Fig. 1 ). In Europe, 74% of biogas is generated from anaerobic digestion of energy crops, manure, and agricultural waste; 17% of biogas is derived from landfill; and 9% of biogas is from sewage sludge in WWTPs (Scarlat et al., 2018). The biogas produced in Europe is mainly used for heat and electricity generation, with electrical efficiency of 30–45% through using gas engines (van Foreest, 2012). In Germany for instance, more than 800 WWTPs utilize biogas for generating electricity (900 GWh/year) or heat (1800 GWh/year), which can support a quarter of total energy required by the WWTPs (dos Santos et al., 2016). Recently, a new Renewable Energy Directive has been established by the European Union for increasing the proportion of renewable energy to 32% by 2030 (Nissen et al., 2018), creating strong support for further biogas industry development in Europe. In addition to European countries, China, United States, and Brazil are large biogas producers (11–16 bcm/year for each country) (Fig. 1). These countries have tremendous biogas feedstocks including food wastes, energy crops, manures and slurries (Xue et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). In 2015, the actual total biogas production in China reached up to 15.8 bcm (MARA, 2017). Recently, new policies and regulations, such as the National 13th Five-Year plan set by China (MARA, 2017), and the National Biofuel Policy (RenovaBio) announced by Brazil, have been established for stimulating biogas production and utilization. However, the development of the biogas industry in these countries lags behind Europe. Due to the low volume loading rate, the efficiency of biogas generators is very low (20–30%), limiting commercial profits and the sustainability of biogas production (Cheng et al., 2013; Hui et al., 2018). Moreover, the majority of biogas in China is used for domestic cooking, while a large portion of biogas is directly flared in the United States, further contributing to low-energy efficiency and environmental issues (REN21, 2019). Therefore, it is vital to upgrade biogas industrial infrastructure and develop innovative technologies for advancing biogas utilization. Many other countries with large populations and vast territories, e.g., Russia, Australia, India, and Nigeria, also have great potential for biogas production (Fig. 1). These countries have a widely available feedstock supply, e.g. organic wastes from agriculture, landfill, and WWTPs. However, the actual biogas yield in these countries is far behind that of Europe. For example, although the annual biogas potential of Russia is estimated to be up to73.7 bcm, which is comparable to that of Europe, only ~10 biogas plants have been established in Russia (Gielen and Saygin, 2017). In addition, the utilization of biogas in these countries is generally unsustainable, with the properties of low energy efficiency and high carbon emission. For example, most biogas is being used for generating electricity and heat, or flared in Australia."
1,Biogas upgrading and current technologies,
2,Biogas upgrading necessities and policy support,"2.1 Biogas upgrading necessities and policy support Biogas mostly comprises methane (CH4, 40–75%) and carbon dioxide (CO2, 15–60%), accompanied by trace gasses including hydrogen sulfide (H2S, 0.005–2%), nitrogen (N2, 0–2%), water vapor (H2O, 5–10%), halogenated hydrocarbons (VOC, 0–0.6%), siloxanes (0–0.02%), oxygen (O2, 0–1%), carbon monoxide (CO, <0.6%), ammonia (NH3), and dust particles (Andriani et al., 2014; Kapoor et al., 2019). While CH4 is the energy-rich compound in biogas, all other components are undesired and limit the advanced utilization of biogas. Firstly, the presence of gas contaminants (mainly CO2) in biogas leads to its low calorific value (~6 KWh/m3), and effectively decreases the volumetric capacity of gas cylinders, making biogas only suitable for applications with low energy utilization efficiency, e.g., cooking and lighting. Secondly, biogas can only be cost-effectively stored for a few hours in the limited infrastructure, and biogas transportation is difficult because CO2 readily transforms into dry ice under high pressure when biogas is compressed (Angelidaki et al., 2018; Kapoor et al., 2019). Thirdly, the corrosive gas H2S in the raw biogas can cause significant damage to gas engine units due to SO2 emission from combustion (Angelidaki et al., 2018). Biogas upgrading can be used to remove these gas contaminants (mainly targeting CO2 removal), and simultaneously convert biogas to biomethane (methane content >96% based on Germany's standard). Compared to raw biogas, biomethane has a much higher energy content (~10 KWh/m3) and wider applications. Biomethane can be directly injected into the existing natural gas grids, thus solving the issues of transportation and storage for biogas (Khan et al., 2017). In addition, biomethane can be utilized as a vehicle fuel in place of fossil fuels, thereby reducing overall CO2 emissions. In terms of these advantages, a number of national policies have been established worldwide for facilitating the biogas upgrading industry. For example, the European Commission has established the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework to boost the development of renewable energy, aiming to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by ≥40%, increase renewable energy to ≥32%, and improve energy efficiency by ≥32% (Commission, 2014). As a completely renewable energy, biomethane is an ideal substitute for natural gas with net-zero GHG emissions. The European Biogas Association (EBA) has proposed policy incentives for stimulating biomethane production, e.g., facilitating biomethane application in heavy industries and shipping, de-fossilizing the gas grid and sector, and giving biomethane priority access to the gas grid (EBA, 2019). Moreover, according to the National 13th Five Year Plan, China aims to increase annual national biomethane production up to 10, 20 and 40 bcm in years 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively (De Clercq et al., 2017). In 2016, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) included biomethane as an advanced biofuel. Specifically, California issued Assembly Bill No. 1900 to promote the utilization of pipeline biomethane (Pasqual et al., 2018). Europe is also leading the world in biogas upgrading and commercialization. The number of biomethane plants in Europe has increased from 187 in 2011 to 540 in 2017, accompanied by a significant increase in biomethane yield from 0.07 bcm in 2011 to 1.8 bcm in 2017 (Bioenergy Europe., 2019). The physicochemical upgrading technologies implemented on an industrial scale include pressure swing adsorption (separating biogas components using special adsorbent materials, e.g., zeolites and activated carbon) (Augelletti et al., 2017), high pressure water scrubbing (employing water to remove CO2 and H2S from biogas due to much higher water solubility of CO2 than that of CH4) (Budzianowski et al., 2017), chemical scrubbing (applying organic solvent, e.g., methanol and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol, or aqueous amine solutions for absorbing CO2 and H2S) (Petersson and Wellinger, 2009), membrane separation (hierarchically separating biogas components based on selective permeability properties of membranes) (Bauer et al., 2013), cryogenic separation (acquiring liquified CH4 by gradually decreasing biogas temperature) (Baena-Moreno et al., 2019), and chemical hydrogenation (reducing CO2 with H2 catalyzed by Nickel or Ruthenium) (Jürgensen et al., 2015). Although many of these technologies have been well-developed, they have multiple disadvantages in high investment, operating and maintenance costs, high energy demands, requirement for a large amount of water (e.g., high pressure water scrubbing) or regeneration of expensive adsorbent (e.g., pressure swing adsorption), and production of waste chemicals that are toxic to humans and the environment (e.g., chemical scrubbing), and unsustainability (e.g., chemical hydrogenation)."
3,Hydrogen-driven chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies,"2.2 Hydrogen-driven chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies In contrast to physicochemical methods, hydrogen (H2)-driven biogas upgrading via biological technologies can be carried out at ambient conditions (i.e. atmospheric pressure and moderate temperature) without the use of expensive catalysts and chemicals. In such biotechnologies, CO2 in the biogas is chemoautotrophically converted to CH4 or other value-added chemicals with renewable H2, which can be generated from water electrolysis driven by wind or solar (Angelidaki et al., 2018). Generating electricity from solar and wind has drawn increasing attention, since these energy sources are renewable, sustainable and clean. The production cost of electricity from renewable sources has also experienced a sharp decrease during recent decades. The cost of solar has fell from $0.378/kWh to $0.068/kWh (dropped by 82%) from 2010 to 2020 (IRENA), and is expected to continue to drop to $0.02–0.04/kWh in 2050 (Mayer, 2015). In several European countries, e.g., Denmark, >26% of electricity is generated from wind (Sovacool, 2013). Efficiently storage or utilization of the surplus electricity is important, otherwise excess energy will be wasted and the power grid will be unstable (Carton and Olabi, 2010; Georgilakis, 2008). Batteries can be utilized for storing electricity, but they have the disadvantages of limited capacity to store electricity, high manufacturing cost, and high risk of environmental pollution caused by obsolete materials. Converting solar and wind energies into H2 is appealing, since H2 is a clean energy that can be directly derived from water electrolysis. However, H2 has a very low volumetric energy density (10.88 MJ/m3), giving rise to difficulties for storage, and its utilization as a fuel for transportation is still under development. In contrast, CH4 has a remarkably higher energy content (36 MJ/m3) than H2, with existing infrastructure for storage (e.g., natural gas grid), and has extensive applications (e.g., as vehicle fuel). Therefore, H2-assisted chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies have excellent potential for converting intermittent energy (wind, solar and raw biogas) to stable energy carriers (biomethane) that can be easily stored, contributing to the development of a sustainable, environmentally friendly and circular economy. 2.2.1 Biogas upgrading using hydrogenotrophic methanogens Hydrogenotrophic methanogens are chemoautotrophic microorganisms capable of converting CO2 to CH4 using H2 as an electron donor (Reaction 1): (1) 4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2 H2O ΔG°′ = −130.7 kJ/mol A diverse range of methanogenic microorganisms including Methanobacterium, Methanothermobacter, Methanobrevibacter and Methanococcus, harbor their particular pathways to convert H2 and CO2 into CH4 (Fig. 2 A) (Costa and Leigh, 2014; Zabranska and Pokorna, 2018). Firstly, CO2 is reduced to methanofuran- bound formyl group (formyl-MFR) with reduced ferredoxin (Fdred) as the electron carrier. The formyl group is transferred to tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and dehydrated to methenyl-H4MPT. The electron carrier F420H2 then reduces methenyl-H4MPT to methylene-H4MPT, and further to methyl-H4MPT. Transfer of the methyl group from methyl-H4MPT to sulfhydryl coenzyme M (HS-CoM), forming CoM-CH3, is carried out by a membrane-bound methyltransferase (Mtr). CoM-CH3 is finally reduced to CH4 accompanied by oxidation of HS-CoM and HS-CoB to CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide. Moreover, the soluble F420-reducing hydrogenase (Frh) catalyzes the oxidation of H2 and reduction of cofactor F420 to F420H2, while a heterodisulfide reductase (HdrABC) reduces oxidized ferredoxin (Fdox) to Fdred, and reduces the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB to CoM-SH and CoB-SH, via electron bifurcation (Kaster et al., 2011). During the process of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, energy is conserved by the action of Mtr, which expels sodium ions across the membrane, forming a sodium motive force for ATP synthesis. The biogas upgrading configurations which use hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be divided into three categories: in-situ, ex-situ and hybrid technologies (Kougias et al., 2017). The in-situ biogas upgrading technology has the advantage of low capital investment without the need for extra infrastructure. For this technology, H2 is directly delivered into anaerobic digesters to stimulate activity of endogenous hydrogenotrophic methanogens, therefore promoting CO2 conversion to CH4. In-situ biogas upgrading has been successfully achieved in anaerobic digesters treating various organics, including manure (Luo et al., 2012), and food waste (Okoro-Shekwaga et al., 2019) (Table 1 ). In this way, CH4 content can generally be enhanced to >75%, and up to 100%, reported by Agneessens et al. (2017) (Table 1). Luo & Angelidaki (2013a) found that in-situ supply of H2 to an anaerobic reactor co-digesting manure and whey enhanced the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, enriching Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus in the system. In addition, temperature was found to be crucial in shaping microbial communities and H2 utilization pathway in-situ biogas upgrading reactors (Zhu et al., 2019). Under mesophilic conditions (35 °C), the majority of H2 was utilized by both aceticlastic methanogens and homoacetogens. In contrast, under thermophilic conditions (55 °C), H2 was mostly consumed for supporting cell growth, and a portion of H2 was used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens (Zhu et al., 2019). For the ex-situ technology, biogas supplied from an external source is introduced into an anaerobic reactor together with H2, giving rise to bioconversion of H2 and CO2 to biomethane via hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Table 2 ). For instance, Bassani et al. (2015) designed a biogas upgrading system integrating two continuous stirred tank reactors, with one reactor for biogas production and another for biogas upgrading. Biomethane with CH4 purity above 85% was produced under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions when H2 was injected into the second reactor. It was found that the introduction of H2 promoted the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus. Kougias et al. (2017) achieved methane purity >98% using a bubble column reactor for ex-situ biogas upgrading. Microbial community analysis indicated that a MBA08, a potential acetogen affiliated to Clostridia, as well as hydrogenotrophic methanogens including Methanothermobacter and Methanoculleus, became the dominant genera. The hybrid technology combines in-situ and ex-situ biogas upgrading into an integrated system, in which a portion of CO2 is captured by the in-situ technology to produce a higher grade biogas, followed by the ex-situ process for further removing residual CO2. For example, a hybrid system consisting of two thermophilic upflow reactors was set up by Corbellini et al. (2018). H2 was injected into the first reactor fed with cattle manure and potato-starch for in-situ biogas upgrading, and an enriched hydrogenotrophic culture was inoculated into the second reactor for ex-situ biogas upgrading. Biomethane with 91% CH4 content and a CH4 production rate of 355 mL CH4/Lreactor-day was attained at steady state. The utilization of CO2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the second reactor helped to buffer the pH drop induced by production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the first reactor. 2.2.2 Biogas upgrading using homoacetogens A new concept gaining attention is the conversion of CO2 in biogas into value-added liquid chemicals, while simultaneously upgrading biogas to biomethane using homoacetogens. Various homoacetogens, e.g., Clostridium scatologenes (Liu et al., 2018), C. autoethanogenum (Heffernan et al., 2020) and Acetobacterium woodii (Cheng et al., 2018), are capable of producing biofuels or their precursors, e.g., acetate, butyrate, and ethanol, using hydrogen as the electron donor and CO2 as the carbon source (Table 3 ). Compared to CH4, these biofuels or liquid chemicals have higher energy density and commercial value, and are more convenient for storage and transportation. The majority of homoacetogens utilize H2 and CO2 to produce acetate (Reaction 2) via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (reductive acetyl-CoA pathway) (Fig. 2B) (Latif et al., 2014; Schiel-Bengelsdorf and Dürre, 2012; Wood, 1991), which is the most efficient metabolic pathway for carbon fixation and energy generation (Lever, 2016). The conversion of CO2 is associated with two branches, the carbonyl and methyl branches, while acetyl-CoA serves as the main intermediate and precursor for liquid chemicals production. In the carbonyl branch, CO2 is reduced to CO catalyzed by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex (CODH/ACS). In the methyl branch, CO2 is successively reduced to formyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF), methyl-THF and further methyl-CoFeSP. CO and methyl-CoFeSP are then bound to generate acetyl-CoA catalyzed by the CODH/ACS. Reducing equivalents (electrons) are acquired through H2 oxidation catalyzed by hydrogenase, and are conserved in the form of NAD(P)H and ferredoxin, which serve as electron donors for reducing CO2. Acetyl-CoA is then converted to acetate catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase (Ragsdale and Pierce, 2008). Several acetogens (e.g., C. autoethanogenum and C. ljungdahlii) can also generate ethanol with acetaldehyde as the intermediate catalyzed by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald), aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE), and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) (Liew et al., 2017). Longer chain fatty acids, e.g., butyrate, can be generated by chain elongation reactions (Batlle-Vilanova et al., 2017). (2) 2CO2 + 4H2 → CH3COO− + H + + 2H2O ΔG°′ = − 95 kJ/mol Compared to a pure culture, mixed cultures are more versatile, considering their CO2 conversion process does not require sterilization, simplifying process operation. The reduction of CO2 to diverse organic acids, including acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and hexanoate has been reported using a mixed culture supplied with H2 (Levy et al., 1981; Zhang et al., 2013). Acetogens, e.g., C. kluyveri and C. ljungdahlii in the mixed culture are reported to play crucial roles in CO2 conversion (Zhang et al., 2013). Although homoacetogens exhibit potential for value-added chemical production from CO2, there is limited application of homoacetogens for biogas upgrading (Omar et al., 2018, 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). An interesting study was carried out by Zhao et al. (2020), in which a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) inoculated with homoacetogen C. ragsdalei P11 was employed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production. They upgraded biogas to biomethane with CH4 content up to 97.6%, and obtained acetate and ethanol production rates of 37.8 and 13.5 mmol L − 1d−1, respectively. Omar et al. (2018, 2019) also achieved CO2 conversion to alcohols or VFAs with Moorella sp. or Acetoanaerobium noterae as the major functional microorganisms. These findings indicate that in addition methanogens, homoacetogens are also suitable for biogas upgrading. However, because the final products, converted from H2 and CO2 by homoacetogens, are generally mixed chemicals (i.e., mixed organics and alcohols) rather than a single product, it is challenging to extract these products from reactor systems. More exploration is required to make homoacetogen-dependent biogas upgrading a feasible and widely adopted biotechnology in the future."
4,Key barriers of current biotechnologies for biogas upgrading,
5,Metabolic limitations in in-situ biogas upgrading,"3.1 Metabolic limitations in in-situ biogas upgrading The in-situ biogas upgrading process relies on existing infrastructure (i.e., anaerobic digesters) for H2 addition, having the advantages of simplicity and low construction cost. However, metabolic limitation associated with VFAs accumulation, dramatic pH change, and CO2 depletion is a big issue in-situ biogas upgrading, typically leading to low biomethane production rate and CH4 content (Fu et al., 2020a; Simon, 2015). The AD process is composed of four steps, including hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Complex organics are firstly hydrolyzed to monomers (hydrolysis), which are then fermented to alcohols and VFAs, e.g., acetate, butyrate and propionate (acidogenesis). These chemicals are further bio-converted to H2, CO2, formate and acetate (acetogenesis), which are utilized as substrates by methanogens for generating CH4 (methanogenesis) (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, the syntrophic interactions among different functional microorganisms play a critical role in sustaining AD performance and stability. Sudden introduction of a high amount of H2 could result in imbalance among syntrophic microorganisms (hydrolyzing bacteria, acetogens and methanogens), thus influencing not only methanogenesis, but also the three upstream steps. For example, exogenous H2 addition could suppress the activity of syntrophic bacteria for degrading VFAs and alcohols, because acetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable when H2 concentration is high (> 10 Pa) (Batstone et al., 2002; Liu and Whitman, 2008). The accumulated VFAs (e.g., propionate concentration > 900 mg/L) could exhibit inhibitory effects on methanogens (Wang et al., 2009). Additionally, H2 introduction may stimulate homoacetogens, thus promoting CO2 conversion to acetate with H2. If acetate consumption rate cannot keep up with its production rate, the overall AD process would be suppressed (Mulat et al., 2017). A pH range of 6.8 to 7.4 has been recommended for maintaining optimal synergistic reactions in the AD process (Dohányos et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the accumulation of VFAs and alcohols in anaerobic digesters induced by direct H2 introduction could cause acidification, leading to deterioration of the biological processes in AD (Angelidaki et al., 2018). On the contrary, it is worth noting that the methanogenic process could create alkaline conditions. According to ionization reaction 4, the consumption of CO2 by methanogens could result in reduction of H + in the liquid phase, thus increasing pH. Typically, a pH of 8.5 is the threshold for optimal methanogenesis, while a higher pH would restrict the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Angelidaki et al., 2018; O'Flaherty et al., 1998). (4) H2O + CO2 ⇋ H + + HCO3 − It has also been observed that CO2 could be depleted by hydrogenotrophic methanogens when the ratio of H2 to CO2 is higher than 4:1 (Luo and Angelidaki, 2013a). On one hand, the depletion of CO2 will limit the carbon source for hydrogenotrophic methanogens, thus negatively influencing methanogenesis process (Liu and Whitman, 2008). On the other hand, homoacetogens that have low H2 affinity (inversely related to the H2 saturation constant Ks) may have competitive advantages over hydrogenotrophic methanogens for H2 when CO2 concentration is low and H2 concentration is high (Agneessens et al., 2018). Collectively, although in-situ biogas upgrading is a promising approach for improving CH4 content in biogas, respective microorganisms associated with the four functional steps in the AD process are interactive. It is critical to optimally balance the syntrophic and methanogenic activities to maximize biomethane production from biogas."
6,Low hydrogen gas transfer rate,"3.2 Low hydrogen gas transfer rate One of the major challenges for H2-assisted biogas upgrading technology is the low H2 transfer rate from the gas to the liquid phase, which is caused by the quite low H2 solubility (1.6 mg/L under 20 °C and 101 kPa) (Kaye and Laby, 1986). Because the biological processes occur mainly in liquid phase, H2 must transfer across the interface between the gas and the liquid phase, to be accessible to hydrogenotrophic microorganisms. As a consequence, the low H2 transfer rate is a major rate-limiting step for hydrogenotrophic bio-processes. This issue is particularly serious for the in-situ biogas upgrading process due to the very limited H2 penetration. Even massive H2 is introduced into biogas upgrading systems, H2 is only available to superficial margins of the methanogenic consortium due to limited H2 mass transfer in anaerobic fermenting sludge matrix (Aryal et al., 2018; Garcia-Robledo et al., 2016). The typical equation for describing the rate of H2 diffusion in a liquid is shown in Eq. (5): (5) Rt = 22.4 kLa (H2gTh−H21) where Rt represents H2 mass transfer rate (mol/L-h), kLa represents linear gas transfer coefficient (h − 1), H2gTh represents H2 concentration in gas phase (mol/L), and H2l is measured dissolved H2 in liquid phase (mol/L). Moreover, proper H2 diffusion equipment is needed, since unused H2 easily escapes from the system. The resultant low gas utilization efficiency will significantly increase the cost of H2 supply, therefore decreasing the economic benefits. In addition, the H2 which escapes could form a combustible localised atmosphere, posing safety risks."
7,Limited production rates of biomethane and value-added chemicals,"3.3 Limited production rates of biomethane and value-added chemicals The production rate of biomethane via in-situ and ex-situ methanogenesis processes are typically in the range of 0.1–1 L/Lreactor-day, and 0.1–3 L/Lreactor-day, respectively, while the production rate of liquid chemicals (e.g., acetate) via homoacetogens, is generally less than 5 g/L/d (Table 1-6). A higher production rate is required to make the biological biogas upgrading process more economically viable and technically feasible for industrial applications. Homoacetogens are efficient in converting CO2 with H2 to multiple chemicals (Daniell et al., 2012), but homoacetogenesis exhibits very low selectivity for final products. Although acetate is the predominant final product converted from CO2, the target chemicals are multicarbon molecules, such as butyrate, ethanol, butanol and 2,3-butanediol, which have much higher commercial value than acetate. For instance, it was found that Moorella sp. generated ~ 40 times higher concentration of acetate than ethanol with provision of CO2 and H2, even when the pH (5.8) was optimal for ethanol production (Sakai et al., 2005). Moreover, the concentrations of butyrate, caproate and caprylate were 1.8, 0.98 and 0.42 g/L, respectively, which is much lower than the acetate concentration (7.4 g/L) produced in an MBfR system supplied with H2 (Zhang et al., 2013)."
8,Potential solutions for overcoming barriers,
9,Relieving metabolic limitation in in-situ biogas upgrading,"4.1 Relieving metabolic limitation in in-situ biogas upgrading Pulsed H2 addition could be a feasible strategy to relieve metabolic limitation for in-situ biogas upgrading (Agneessens et al., 2017). It has been found that as long as the concentration ratio of injected H2 to daily produced CO2 from AD is less than 8:1, the pH rise was limited to 0.17, while CO2 concentration could be maintained above 11.8%, thus eliminating negative impacts induced by alkalization and CO2 depletion. The CH4 content in the raw biogas can be upgraded to 100% provided that the H2 to CO2 ratio exceeds 6:1, while the accumulated VFAs were far below their inhibitory concentration. The pulsed H2 injection could stimulate the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, e.g., Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales, giving rise to an increased H2 uptake rate (Agneessens et al., 2017). As mentioned in Section 3.1, the pH in anaerobic digesters tends to decrease during acidogenesis, and increase in methanogenesis. The pH balance associated with the two steps is crucial for maintaining favourable microbial metabolism involved in both anaerobic digestion and in-situ biogas upgrading. The VFA-producing potential of feedstocks impacts the trends in pH. Feeding substrate that contains highly abundant organics, e.g., food waste (Yu et al., 2018), readily induces excessive acidification during organic decomposition. Co-digestion of different feedstocks could be a strategy for avoiding dramatic pH change. For instance, waste activated sludge, a substrate that can release NH4 + to buffer acidity, has been generally used for co-digestion with food waste (Dai et al., 2013). Nevertheless, if the feedstock has low VFA-producing potential (e.g., cattle slurry), the VFAs generated from acidogenesis might not be sufficient to buffer the increased alkalinity from methanogenesis. In order to prevent a dramatic pH increase by methanogenesis, Luo & Angelidaki (2013a) carried out co-digestion of manure and acidic whey for in-situ biogas upgrading. Consequently, the pH was maintained below 8.0 and the introduced H2 was almost 100% utilized for CO2 conversion to CH4. The degradation of VFAs (e.g., propionate) is thermodynamically favourable, giving rise to minor VFA accumulation in effluent. In addition, operational parameters of stock feeding, e.g., the organic loading rate, are also crucial in controlling pH (Agneessens et al., 2018). Additives, such as, biochar (Zhang et al., 2020), zero valent iron (ZVI) (Su et al., 2013), and ash (Yin et al., 2019), have potential to accelerate methanogenesis for in-situ biogas upgrading. Biochar supplementation can provide additional nutrients, e.g., P, K, Ca, and Mg, to boost the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Shen et al., 2015). For example, biochar amendment was found to selectively enrich Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina in a thermophilic anaerobic digester treating food waste (Zhang et al., 2020). Su et al. (2013) assessed the impact of nano ZVI (zero-valent iron) on an anaerobic digester treating sewage sludge, and found the CH4 content in biogas increased by 5–13% with the amendment of 0.10 wt% of nano ZVI. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was promoted by enhanced H2 generation from anaerobic corrosion of ZVI (Dykstra and Pavlostathis, 2017). Additionally, it has also been reported that stepwise introduction of ash could promote methanogenesis via inhibiting the activity of hydrolytic and acidifying enzymes while improving the activity of coenzyme F420, which is critical to methanogenesis, thus leading to a 10% increase in CH4 content of biogas in an anaerobic digester (Yin et al., 2019). Since introducing additives leads to increased treatment costs and potentially negative impacts on the environment, low-cost and environmentally compatible alternatives need to be developed. Compared to the in-situ process, ex-situ biogas upgrading, in which biogas production and biogas upgrading take place separately, has fewer microbial metabolic limitations and higher flexibility. Firstly, the ex-situ biogas upgrading process performed by hydrogenotrophic microorganisms proceeds in a separate unit, without imposing negative impacts on the AD process. Secondly, the biological processes involved are easier to control and adjust with minor interference of organics. Moreover, the ex-situ biogas upgrading unit can be flexibly connected to a remote power source (Angelidaki et al., 2018), making the integrated system more controllable."
10,Enhancing H2 mass transfer rate and utilization efficiency by optimizing reactor configuration and operational conditions,"4.2 Enhancing H2 mass transfer rate and utilization efficiency by optimizing reactor configuration and operational conditions The major challenge for implementing both in-situ and ex-situ biogas upgrading is H2 mass transfer limitation. According to Eq. (5), the H2 transfer rate can be improved by enhancing kLa, which is dependent on reactor configuration and operating conditions (Bassani et al., 2017; Pauss et al., 1990). Luo and Angelidaki. (2012) established a reactor equipped with a continuous stirrer for maintaining liquid homogeneity, and a gassing device for introducing H2 and biogas. When the speed was increased from 500 to 800 rpm in the continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), the biogas loading rate increased from 12 to 24 L/Lreactor-day, while the CH4 content in the upgraded biogas was maintained at ~90%. However, H2 mass transfer rate was still the limiting factor for efficient H2 utilization in this system. For in-situ biogas upgrading, the intense mixing leads to high shear forces which disrupt synergistic associations between H2-producing (fermenters) and H2-utilizing (methanogens) microorganisms, thereby slowing down or disrupting both fermentation and methanogenesis. In addition, the intense mixing consumes a lot of energy, and continuous stirring is not appropriate for industrial application. In order to overcome H2 transfer limitation, a series of new reactor designs have been developed, including the bubble column reactor, solid-state bioreactor, trickling bed reactor, biofilm plug-flow reactor, and hollow fiber MBfR, for efficient biogas upgrading (Fig. 3 ). Bubble column reactor. The bubble column reactor, which generally has a high height/width ratio, is equipped with gas diffusers (e.g., stainless steel diffusers or alumina ceramic membranes) for H2 dispersion (Fig. 3B) (Bassani et al., 2017). The H2 mass transfer rate was improved by changing the diffuser pore size (e.g., increasing diameter from 0.4 µm to 2 µm) and gas recirculation rate, and installing a ceramic sponge above the H2 diffusers (Bassani et al., 2016, 2017). By employing this system for ex-situ biogas upgrading, Bassani et al. (2017) achieved a CH4 yield of 0.25 LCH4/LH2, and biomethane purity of 96%. Moreover, it was reported that the bubble column reactor has a much higher efficiency for biogas upgrading (>98% CH4 content in the output gas) than the CSTR (<79% CH4 content in the output gas) with the same gas feeding rate (Kougias et al., 2017). Solid-state bioreactor. The unique feature of the solid-state bioreactor is the packing of solid particle materials (e.g., vermiculite and granular perlite) for immobilizing functional microorganisms (e.g., methanogens) (Fig. 3C). The high specific surface area of the particles creates sufficient contact among microorganisms, gas and liquid, thus increasing the gas transfer rate (Rittmann et al., 2015). The ex-situ biogas upgrading potential of a fixed bed bioreactor composed of two solid state reactors in series was assessed by Alitalo et al. (2015), in which a maximal methane productivity of 6.35 L/Lreactor-d and a hydrogen conversion rate of 100% were obtained. In addition, waste materials (e.g., wood ash) can be mixed in the packing materials as inorganic nutrient for supporting the growth of methanogens (Alitalo et al., 2015). Trickle-bed reactor. The trickle-bed reactor contains carriers for biofilm attachment, supplied with a continuous liquid flow for wetting the biofilm and providing nutrients (Fig. 3D) (Burkhardt and Busch, 2013). This reactor design creates a unique three-phase biofilm-liquid-gas structure, which has a high concentration gradient and a quick diffusion route, ensuring a high gas transfer rate. In addition, the specific surface area of the carriers could further confer a high H2 and CO2 conversion efficiency. Gas recirculation, an energy-consuming process that has been commonly used in other reactor designs is not necessary in the trickle-bed reactor. The use of this system for biological methanation from H2 and CO2 was tested in a study by Burkhardt et al. (2015), which achieved a CH4 production rate of 1.17 Nm3/(m3•d), and 100% H2 utilization efficiency. Moreover, Rachbauer et al. (2016) operated a trickle-bed reactor inoculated with hydrogenotrophic culture and fed the reactor with H2 and raw biogas under mesophilic conditions. With a gas retention time of 2.3 h, the biogas could be upgraded to biomethane (> 96%) at a productivity of 2.52 m3 CH4/m3 reactor vol-d, equivalent to a biogas upgrading capacity of 6.9 m3 biogas/m3 reactor vol-d (Rachbauer et al., 2016). Biofilm plug-flow reactor. An innovative biofilm plug-flow reactor was also proposed for biogas upgrading (Savvas et al., 2017). A PVC tube (7 m length and 13 mm internal diameter) containing polyethylene wheels as carriers for attaching biofilm was hung on a frame to form vertical loops. Biogas was continuously fed through the tube while liquid medium was recirculated very slowly (10 ml/min). After reaching steady state, the tube was placed horizontally, and gas was uniformly delivered across the biofilms which were kept wet via intermittently introduced medium. With this configuration, the gas residence time and the effective volume of the biofilms were maximized, giving rise to 99% CO2 conversion efficiency at total gas flux rate of 100 v/v/d, with highest reported methane evolution rate of 40 v/v/d. Moreover, a high mass transfer rate was achieved without the gas-liquid agitation which was generally used for CSTR, minimizing energy consumption. Hollow-fiber MBfR. The MBfR has also been utilized in both in-situ and ex-situ biogas upgrading processes. The core component of the MBfR system is the gas-permeable hollow fiber membranes, which not only provide a suitable surface for microorganisms to grow and form biofilms (Lai et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2018a, 2018b; Ontiveros-Valencia et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017), but also confer a high gas utilizing efficiency and transfer rate that is not achievable via gas sparging (Fig. 3E) (Martin and Nerenberg, 2012). When delivered through the membrane lumen, H2 efficiently disperses through the membrane wall to the biofilm on the outer surface. Luo and Angelidaki (2013) achieved a CH4 content >90% by installing bubble-less hollow fibers in an anaerobic reactor digesting cattle manure and whey (Luo and Angelidaki, 2013b). Díaz et al. (2015) further set up a pilot-scale MBfR for converting H2 and CO2 to CH4, demonstrating a kLa of 430 h − 1, biomethane yield of 0.22 LCH4/LH2, and biomethane purity of 95% CH4, with a maximum H2 loading rate of 40.2 L/L reactor-d. Interestingly, when the MBfR was inoculated with a mixed culture from an anaerobic digester, Zhang et al. (2014) achieved bio-conversion of CO2 and H2 to multiple value-added chemicals, including acetate, butyrate, and medium chain fatty acids (caproate and caprylate), with 100% hydrogen utilization efficiency. In general, increasing reactor pressure and gassing rate promotes the rate of gas-liquid mass transfer, thereby improving the purity of upgraded biomethane, and the volumetric biomethane production rate (Seifert et al., 2014). In addition, temperature significantly impacts methanogenesis and gas fermentation. It has been reported that for an in-situ biogas upgrading system, the CO2 and H2 conversion rate was 60% higher under thermophilic conditions than that with mesophilic temperatures (37%) (Luo and Angelidaki, 2012), although higher temperature resulted in lower gas dissolution."
11,Bioelectrochemical system (BES) as an innovative technique for biogas upgrading,"4.3 Bioelectrochemical system (BES) as an innovative technique for biogas upgrading Biogas upgrading using BES has drawn considerable interest owing to multiple advantages, including low energy input, ability to recover multiple resources from wastes, and generation of value-added chemicals (Bajracharya et al., 2017; Zeppilli et al., 2019). BES-assisted CO2 conversion is also resistant to fluctuations in electricity supply, potentially able to overcome the instability of renewable energy in practical applications (Rojas et al., 2018). A membrane (e.g., proton exchange membrane (PEM) or anion exchange membrane (AEM)) is generally installed to divide the BES system into anode and cathode chambers, and external power is required to overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic limitation of the biological reactions (Fig. 3F) (Villano et al., 2012). Typically, organics (Lu and Ren, 2016) or water (Van Eerten‐Jansen et al., 2012) are decomposed at the anode, transferring electrons to the cathode, where H2 is generated and then utilized by methanogens for biogas upgrading. Alternatively, electroactive methanogens carry out CO2 reduction by directly utilizing electrons from electrodes through extracellular electron transfer (Villano et al., 2010). Alkali production and CO2 absorption could also favor biogas upgrading in the BES (Xu et al., 2014). Moreover, H2S in the raw biogas can be removed via microbial or electrochemical H2S oxidation, generally with sulfur or sulfate as the final products (Buisman et al., 1990; Guiot et al., 1997; Ni et al., 2019; Tartakovsky et al., 2014). In a reported in-situ BES-assisted biogas upgrading process, electrodes were directly placed into an anaerobic reactor to generate H2 or electrons for CO2 reduction (Table 4 ) (Tartakovsky et al., 2011). A portion of H2 was utilized by methanogens to convert CO2 to CH4 to purify the biogas, while the presence of O2 facilitated hydrolysis of organics and desulphurization of biogas (Tartakovsky et al., 2011). BES has been found to shorten stabilization time, and boost organic and VFA degradation for anaerobic digestion (Tartakovsky et al., 2014). Moreover, BES is an attractive approach for simultaneous ex-situ biogas upgrading and resource recovery (Table 5 ). An innovative three-chamber BES was established to simultaneously upgrade biogas, treat digestate, and recover ammonia (Zeppilli et al., 2019). An AEM and a CEM were installed to divide the system into one anode chamber (in the middle) and two cathode chambers (on two sides). Biogas was injected into the CEM-cathode chamber, while digestate containing a high concentration of organics and NH4 + was introduced into the anode chamber. In this system, organics were decomposed in the anode chamber, while CO2 in the biogas was removed in both cathode chambers via methanogenesis and CO2 sorption (due to alkali production via methanogenesis) (Zeppilli et al., 2019). The process of methanogenesis in the CEM-cathode could also drive NH4 +migration from the anode chamber for maintaining electroneutrality, thereby enabling the recovery of concentrated ammonium in this chamber. Recently, Fu et al. (2020) set up a BES equipped with a proton exchange membrane, and added ferrous ion into the anode chamber, for simultaneously upgrading biogas and sulfur recovery. When biogas was injected into the system, sulfide was oxidized to recoverable sulfur particles, via a ferrous ion-mediated redox reaction in the anode chamber (Fu et al., 2020b). Meanwhile, H2 was generated via incorporation of electrons from the cathode and protons that migrated from the anode during sulfide oxidation. The H2 generated was then used for driving CO2 conversion to CH4, through the action of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode chamber. It is worth noting that CO2 conversion to value-added liquid chemicals, e.g., formate (Zhao et al., 2012), acetate (Jourdin et al., 2015), and ethanol (Anwer et al., 2019), can also be realized by BES (Table 6 ). Acetogens, such as, C. ljungdahlii (Jabeen and Farooq, 2016) and Sporomusa ovata (Im et al., 2016), can survive and catalyze bioelectrochemical reactions in a BES. For example, using a BES, Jourdin et al. (2015) achieved a high acetate production rate, up to 685 g m − 2 day−1, and final acetate concentration of 11 g/L, with electron and CO2 utilization efficiency at 94% and 100%, respectively. Electrodes with advanced or modified materials, e.g., cobalt tetra-amino phthalocyanine and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Zhao et al., 2012), synthesized EPD-3D electrodes (Jourdin et al., 2015), and MnO2 coated carbon felt (Anwer et al., 2019), are to promote CO2 conversion and liquid chemicals production. Moreover, the spectrum of chemicals produced from BES can be expanded to longer chain fatty acids which have higher commercial value than acetate. Generally, both acetate and ethanol are needed by acetogens for chain elongation. However, in the BES, H2 or electrons from the cathode could act as electron donors for producing acetate and ethanol, which are combined to generate longer chain fatty acids via chain elongation (Prévoteau et al., 2020). For example, by employing a laboratory-scale BES installed with carbon felt electrodes, the production rates of CO2-derived butyrate and caproate can reach up to 3.2 and 0.95 g L − 1 day−1, respectively (Jourdin et al., 2018). Although a few studies have demonstrated the potential of BES for biogas upgrading and value-added chemicals production, it is still at an early stage of development. Most of BES systems are lab-scale studies using bio-reactors of a few liters, with drawbacks including low current densities, low production yields, high capital cost of electrodes and membrane, and biofouling, thus hampering economical scale-up (Christodoulou and Velasquez-Orta, 2016). Promising strategies are proposed to make BES more suitable for industrial application e.g., inoculating BES with highly active, genetically engineered microorganisms, as discussed below."
12,Maximizing production of targeted chemicals using genetic engineering tools,"4.4 Maximizing production of targeted chemicals using genetic engineering tools Genetic modification using technologies such as genetic recombination, gene overexpressing, and in-frame deletion of targeted genes, is a powerful way to reprogram metabolic pathways to obtain the desired carbon transformation. Recently, a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to constructing genetically engineered microorganisms for improving the concentration and production rate of value-added chemicals (Batstone et al., 2002; Bi et al., 2013; Chakravarty and Brigham, 2018; Khan et al., 2014; Liew et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2020). Although genetic engineering is an effective approach for reinforcing microbial CO2 conversion and controllably generating value-added multicarbon molecules, its applications in biogas upgrading are extremely limited. Here, we put forward several potential strategies, including carbon flux redirection, CO2 fixation reinforcement, and more advanced genetic engineering technologies, which potentially can be employed for maximizing desired value-added chemical production during biogas upgrading (Fig. 4 ). 4.4.1 Redirecting carbon flux Reconstructing microbial metabolic networks using genetic engineering tools is a useful approach for generating the desired products from CO2. By using such a strategy, carbon flux is redirected from general pathways to targeted pathways for synthesizing chemicals of interest. In fact, a few hydrogenotrophic methanogens have been genetically modified to realize CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals, e.g., geraniol and isoprene, that have a much higher commercial value than CH4 (Lyu et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2020). Recombinant methanogen Methanococcus maripaludis was constructed with the insertion of an exogenous gene encoding geraniol synthase (Lyu et al., 2016). This modified strain was able to convert CO2 to geraniol with the supply of H2, thus generating geraniol at 2.8 mg/g of cell dry weight. Similarly, recombinant expression of isoprene synthase in Methanosarcina acetivorans yielded isoprene (Murphy et al., 2020). Moreover, CH4 conversion to lactate was achieved by constructing a recombinant Methanosarcina acetivorans, cloned with three genes associated with Mcr for activating CH4 by the reverse methanogenesis pathway, and one gene involved in 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd) for generating lactate (McAnulty et al., 2017). In addition to methanogens, other anaerobic or aerobic hydrogenotrophic bacteria have also been genetically manipulated toward synthesising desired products. A. woodii, an anaerobic bacterium able to grow with H2 and CO2, has been engineered with a pathway to divert carbon flow to acetate, with accumulation of up to 51 g/L of acetate within 3.8 days. Genes involved in the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, e.g., acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase, were overexpressed (Straub et al., 2014). Likewise, modifying the ethanol synthesis route via inactivating aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) in C. autoethanogenum was found to raise ethanol production up to 180% over the wildtype strain (Liew et al., 2017). Of particular interest, some aerobic gas-fermenting bacteria, e.g., Cupriavidus necator, Ralstonia eutropha and Rhodobacter capsulatus, have been genetically engineered for producing highly valuable biofuels and chemicals, e.g., pentadecane, methyl ketones, heptadecane, and botryococcene with the supply of H2 (Bi et al., 2013; Chakravarty and Brigham, 2018; Khan et al., 2014). Krieg et al. (2018) engineered Cupriavidus necator to heterologously express α-humulene synthase and the mevalonate pathway. Supplied with H2 and O2, this engineered strain converted CO2 to terpene α-humulene, an important compound in medicine, perfumes and advanced biofuels, with a product content of 10 mg α-humulene/g cell dry mass. 4.4.2 Reinforcing CO2 fixation by converting heterotrophs to autotrophs Compared to autotrophs, heterotrophs growing on organics like sucrose, glycerol and glucose are more widely applied for industrial-scale production of various chemicals due to their high activity and versatility. Nevertheless, using these organic feedstocks for biotechnological manufacturing competes with their use as food and animal feeds. Therefore, it is more sustainable and economically viable if CO2 in the biogas can be utilized as a carbon source by heterotrophs for producing desired chemicals. Engineering heterotrophs to be autotrophic microorganisms is a promising approach to achieve this objective. For example, although the wild-type archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus cannot utilize CO2, a recombinant strain can express heterologous genes involved in the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutylate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle for CO2 fixation after insertion of a related operon, thus conferring the ability to convert H2 and CO2 to 3- hydroxypropionate (Keller et al., 2013). In order to produce a high yield of chemicals like butanol from CO2, Fast & Papoutsakis (2018) engineered core heterologous genes associated with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway from autotrophic C. ljungdahlii to C. acetobutylicum, which are wild-type obligate heterotrophs. Furthermore, by endogenous metabolic network rewiring and continuous laboratory evolution, Gleizer et al. (2019) reconstructed an Escherichia coli which fixed CO2 autotrophically via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) pathway, and acquired reducing power and energy from formate that was produced electrochemically. 4.4.3 Advanced genetic engineering techniques for biogas upgrading With the rapid development of tools for genetic engineering and synthetic biology, progress towards highly efficient and accurately targeted production of biofuels and chemicals from CO2 is gathering pace. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a powerful and sophisticated technology enabling high-throughput genetic screening and scarless metabolic pathway modification. Some acetogens, e.g., C. ljungdahlii (Huang et al., 2016) and C. autoethanogenum (Nagaraju et al., 2016), have been genetically edited using CRISPR/Cas9 for influencing metabolic CO2/CO conversion to ethanol. Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are another robust tool for targeted chemicals production. By computationally integrating genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, GEMs support a global and comprehensive view of metabolism, enabling prediction of metabolic fluxes, and further facilitation of reconstructing desired metabolic networks (Reed et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2010). Although the aforementioned techniques may be employed for converting CO2 to value-added chemicals, application of these genetic engineering technologies in biogas upgrading is extremely limited, and requires further exploration."
13,Conclusions and perspectives,"Upgrading biogas to biomethane improves the calorific value of biogas and broadens the range of application. Compared to the challenges of physicochemical methods that need expensive catalysts or intensive energy, H2-driven biogas upgrading is promising particularly from a long-term perspective, considering that the cost of H2 from water hydrolysis (powered by renewable wind and solar energy) is consistently declining. The biological H2-driven biogas upgrading process consists of two approaches: i) using hydrogenotrophic methanogens to convert CO2 with H2 to CH4, and ii) employing homoacetogens to convert CO2 and H2 into value-added chemicals (Fig. 5 ). Based on substantial progress from lab-scale studies focusing on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for biogas upgrading, several large-scale plants have been established so far. Located in Allendorf, Germany, BioPower2Gas is the first commercial biological H2-driven biogas plant in the world (Bailera et al., 2017). In this plant, H2 is generated by a 2 × 150 kWe electrolyser, and delivered into the biogas reactor from the base for biological methanation with CO2 at a loading of 15 Nm3/h. Consequently, the CH4 content in biogas increased from 50% to 75%. In addition, an in-situ biogas upgrading plant was established in Foulum, Denmark. A 1200 m3 thermophilic reactor was fed with agricultural waste at an organic loading rate of 4–6 VS/L reactor/d, and injected with up to 33.5 m3 H2 (Jensen et al., 2018). Moreover, Electrochaea constructed an ex-situ biogas upgrading plant in Foulum, Denmark. A 10,000-liter reactor was inoculated with methanogens, and supplied with H2 generated by a 1 MWe alkaline electrolyser, which was powered by excess wind power, thereby converting raw biogas to biomethane with CH4 content >97% (Bailera et al., 2017; Electrochaea 2021.). In addition to methanogens, homoacetogens also show potential for utilization in biogas upgrading. Different from methanogens, homoacetogens are able to generate a broad range of value-added chemicals, which are more transportable and commercially valuable than CH4. Although conversion of CO2 and H2 to fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate and butyrate) and alcohol (e.g., ethanol) by homoacetogens has been extensively studied, application in biogas upgrading (e.g., using MBfR and BES systems) is still in early stage. LanzaTech, a company which develops advanced technologies for gas fermentation, is employing homoacetogens to convert syngas (gas mixture of H2, CO2 and CO) to liquid fuels. The commercialization potential of biogas upgrading using homoacetogens is worth exploring. Technical bottlenecks for implementing industrial-scale H2-driven biogas upgrading include H2 mass transfer limitation (Jensen et al., 2018). In order to address these issues, improved reactor designs and appropriate genetic manipulation are necessary to enable biogas upgrading with high H2 and CO2 conversion efficiency and final products selectivity. Moreover, integrating different functional microorganisms using two-stage biological processes is a promising strategy to realize CO2 and H2 conversion to specialty chemicals (e.g., triacylglycerides and single cell proteins (SCPs)) that cannot be efficiently synthesized by pure culture (Hu et al., 2016; Molitor et al., 2019). For example, using two-stage design, 18 g/L of C16-C18 triacylglycerides was generated by integrating homoacetogen Moorella thermoacetica and metabolically engineered yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Hu et al., 2016), and a SCPs mass-fraction of 40–50% in cells was produced by combination of C. ljungdahlii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Molitor et al., 2019). This review summarizes recent findings in biological H2-dependent biogas upgrading technologies. This review particularly highlights key challenges associated with the current technologies, such as metabolic limitations, low H2 transfer rate, and limited CO2 conversion rate. More importantly, we also propose new strategies for overcoming technical barriers, including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation, novel reactor designs to improve hydrogen gas transfer rate and utilization efficiency, as well as employing advanced genetic engineering tools to improve biogas upgrading efficiency and rate. It is expected that the insights offered in this review will stimulate more efforts to explore biological H2-dependent biogas upgrading, thus boosting application of the relevant technologies."
