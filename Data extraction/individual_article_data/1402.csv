0,Introduction,"Many advantages, such as improved therapeutic effect for a variety of low molecular weight drugs, reduced solubility and toxicity, controlled diffusion and targeted delivery, have been attributed to polymeric drug delivery systems over conventional carriers [1,2]. The simplest approach in fabrication of a drug carrier polymeric system involves physical mixing or blending of the drug in a polymer matrix. In this case, drug release occurs either by the disintegration of or by the diffusion from the polymeric matrix. During this process, the drug conserves its native pharmacological properties [1] and therefore, these types of drug carrier systems have been paid great attention. Polylactide (PLA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide (PEO) and poly(Ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) are amongst the most commonly used polymers in carrier systems, since natural polymers have an ability to release the drug in a more controlled manner [3]. All these polymers have biocompatible and biodegradable nature besides offering ease of fabrication in multifarious forms. However, the range of their applications are restricted by poor mechanical properties [4–7]. In recent years, several types of biocompatible carriers have been developed to be used especially as wound dressing [8,9]. One of the polymers that receive significant interest for such applications is chitosan (CS) [10]. CS is a natural biopolymer composed of β-[1→4]-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose and 2-amino-2–2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose units [2]. Due to the abundance of amine and hydroxyl functionalities in its structure, CS is a versatile biopolymer. Moreover, CS can be physically conditioned into films, gel beads or fibers owing to its solubility in mildly acidic media [11]. CS is proven to be biodegradable, biocompatible and have been shown to exhibit adhesive, wound healing and antimicrobial properties. Concordantly, it is extensively studied for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications [10]. The primary interest in CS as wound dressing material is also related to its functionality in cell proliferation. It has been reported that CS promotes wound healing during its gradual breakdown to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units by triggering fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition and hyaluronic acid synthesis at the wound site [12]. However, delivery structures composed solely of CS offer poor mechanical stability and a high rate of release is observed at the very early stages of release process as opposed to the desired sustained release profile [13]. One of the strategies to overcome this negative phenomenon is to blend CS with synthetic polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) or polystyrene which results in the formation of composite materials with enhanced properties such as thermal stability, tensile strength and percentage elongation at break in addition to tuning cost performance ratio [14]. PVA, is a nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymer with film-forming ability [15–17]. The hydroxyl functionalities in PVA not only pertain to the hydrophilicity of the material but also enhance the formation of inter- and intramolecular bonding between the components of the matrix materials [18]. All these attributes make PVA a good candidate for polymer matrix of drug delivery systems [1–2,10,19] and thus, CS and PVA have been frequently studied as binary blend films in order to obtain desired materials with enhanced properties for specific application fields including biomedical [20–24,12]. CS-PVA nanofibre mats were shown to be superior over commercial gauze treatment by Charernsriwilaiwat et al. (2012) in terms of wound healing [12]. Similar results were reported by Abbas et al. (2019) for CS/PVA membranes and by Yuvaraja et al. (2017) for CS/PVA beads [23,24]. Also, a synergism between CS and PVA was demonstrated by Yuvaraja et al. (2017) due to earlier wound healing and better wound closure with respect to pure CS [23]. Cross-linking is the foremost approach for stability enhancement and in the case of drug delivery, it also aids in slowing the drug release rate by hindering diffusion. The cross-linking process could be achieved by the different type of methods including physical or chemical cross-linking with regard to concerned requirements [3,21,22,25]. However, the use of eco-benign cross-linkers have become more prominent based on the safety and environmental facts. Researchers have recently preferred natural and environmental friendly cross-linkers to offer a green-synthesis approach. While the commonly used cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde are cytotoxic, genipin (GEN) a natural cross-linking agent isolated from fruits of Gardenia jasminoides, Ellis, could be used to obtain stable cross-linked networks with much less toxicity [10,26]. In the present study, the effectiveness of drug release from chitosan/poly(vinyl alcohol) complexed blend films was studied as a function of film composition and cross-linking density. More efficient release profile and mechanical strengthening was targeted through chemical cross-linking with GEN without compromising from biocompatibility. Ibuprofen (IBU), which is known as an effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and antipyretic properties, was selected as the model drug. By formulating IBU into CS/PVA, the main drawbacks associated with IBU, i.e. poor solubility in water and short half-life of approximately 2 h were aimed to be eliminated [27]. In vitro drug release studies were performed with IBU so as to examine the potential of IBU loaded CS/PVA/GEN for providing the necessary protection and hydration to the wound [28]. A novel formulation was suggested and tested for IBU release. Additionally, the morphological and chemical structures of the films were characterized. Since fabricated films were intended for use as wound dressing, mechanical performance, water vapor permeability, cytotoxicity and water uptake capacity of the films were also investigated. With this study, an environmentally benign one-step approach was proposed for the production of IBU embedded CS/PVA blend films cross-linked by GEN as an alternative to toxic crosslinking agents. Furthermore, superior mechanical properties were recorded with respect to CS/PVA blends cross-linked with conventional cross linkers."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Chitosan (CS) powder (Mw: 100,000–300,000 g/mole) with 85% deacetylation degree was purchased from ACROS. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (30,000–50,000 g/mole, 99% hydrolyzed), acetic acid (CH3COOH), ethanol (C2H6O), phosphate buffer saline (PBS) tablet, methanol (CH3OH), genipin (GEN) powder (≥98%, HPLC), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (C3H8O) and ACS reagent grade ninhydrin were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Ibuprofen (IBU) was kindly provided by Bilim Ilac, Turkey. Cell Culture chemicals and solutions for cytotoxicity tests including medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-Roswell Park Memorial Institute, DMEM-RPMI), antibiotic, trypsin, fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from PAN Biotech (Germany). (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)−2-(4-nitrophenyl)−2H-5-tetrazolio] 1,3benzenedisulfonate) (WST-1) cell proliferation reagent was provided from Roche (Switzerland). l-arginine was received as a gift from Prof. Dr. Berna Sarıyar Akbulut (Marmara University). All chemicals were used as supplied without further purification."
3,Production of blend films,"2.2 Production of blend films Films were fabricated by solvent casting method. Accordingly, 2% (wt.) CS solution was prepared by dissolving CS powder in 4% (v/v) acetic acid solution at room temperature. 10% (wt.) PVA solution was prepared and mixed with CS solution under stirring for 15 min at 120 rpm with different weight ratios as indicated in Table 1 . These formulations were coded as CS/PVA. For the cross-linked films, the CS/PVA solution was blended with an aqueous GEN solution to a final concentration of 1 × 10−4 ~1 × 10−3 M and coded as CS/PVA/GEN for further reference. IBU was dissolved in ethanol and added to CS/PVA or CS/PVA/GEN in 20% volumetric ratio. Finally, all mixtures were casted on glass petri dishes and dried at 36 °C overnight."
4,Film characterization,"2.3 Film characterization The CS/PVA, CS/PVA/GEN and CS/PVA/GEN-IBU blend films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Measurements were carried out by Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) unit in the scanning range of 380 and 4000 cm−1. The FTIR spectra were drawn as an average of 16 scans. The morphologies of crosslinked and non-crosslinked CS/PVA films were both investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL, JSM-5910LV, USA) after Au/Pd coating. 2.3.1 Determination of cross-linking degree The cross-linking degree of films were determined by ninhydrin assay. Ninhydrin solution (0.6% w) was prepared in 1:1:20 volumetric mixture of isopropanol, methanol and ethanol. The assay was conducted following the method described by Cui et al. (2014) [29]. However, of glycine, l-arginine was utilized for preparation of the standard curve. The concentration of free NH2 instead groups in the sample were determined spectrophotometrically based on the optical absorbance at 570 nm (Agilent Cary Win 2.0). The cross-linking degree was calculated according to Eq. (1); (1) C r o s s − l i n k i n g d e g r e e ( % ) = ( M N H 2 P l a i n − M N H 2 C r o s s − l i n k e d ) M N H 2 P l a i n * 100 Herein, M N H 2 P l a i n and M N H 2 C r o s s − l i n k e d denotes the mole fraction of free amino groups in non-cross linked and genipin cross-linked samples, respectively. 2.3.2 Swelling tests The water uptake capacity of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN films was evaluated by swelling of the films in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C under continuous stirring (130 rpm) for 24 h. Following that, the swollen films were collected and wiped off to remove excess surface water. The swelling ratio of the films (%) was calculated based on the recorded weights according to Eq. (2); (2) S w e l l i n g r a t i o ( % ) = W s − W d W d x 100 Where Ws and Wd are the weight (g) of the films before and after swelling, respectively."
5,Mechanical tests,"2.4 Mechanical tests The mechanical properties, namely tensile strength and elastic modulus were measured using a Universal Testing Machine (Zwick Z010 universal tensile tester, Kennesaw, GA) with 0.01 N load cell and 2 mm/min crosshead speed. Rectangular film specimens were cut in dimensions of 1 cm x 5 cm. For accuracy, five samples were tested for each composition at room temperature and the average value was recorded. The tensile strength was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) T S = F m a x A Where F max is the maximum force (N) at break and A corresponds to the cross-sectional area of the specimen (mm2)."
6,Cytotoxicity tests,2.5 Cytotoxicity tests WST-1 cell proliferation and viability assay with L929 cell line (Murine Fibroblast) was used to determine cytotoxicity of CS/PVA 2:3 and CS/PVA/GEN 1.0 blend films following the protocol described in detail by Aycan et al. [19]. This method is briefly based on the comparison of the number of viable cells (WST-1) between a sample-free control group and seeded samples. The absorbance values of WST-1 were measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm via Promega GloMax®-Multi+ detection system.
7,Water vapor transmission rate,"2.6 Water vapor transmission rate The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of polymeric films was determined according to the ASTM method E-9600 (ASTM, 2004) with slight modifications. The films were hermetically sealed in a permeability cup (Diameter = 1.6 cm). An open permeability cup was used as control. In order to prevent humidity changes and maintain the relative humidity (RH) at 75%, anhydrous silica (0% RHc) was placed inside the permeability cups and saturated NaCl solution (75% RHd) was used in desiccator. The WVTR through the exposed film area was measured from the cups weight loss as a function of time. The experiments were conducted in triplicates. The slope of each curve was determined by linear regression and WVTR was calculated by using Eq. (4); (4) W V T R = S * 24 A ( g / m 2 day ) where S is the slope of each curve (g H2O/h) and A is the permeation area (m2)."
8,In vitro drug release studies,"2.7 In vitro drug release studies In vitro drug release experiments were conducted with polymeric films precut in 1 cm2 sizes. Accordingly, the drug loaded film samples were immersed into falcon tubes containing 15 ml of PBS having pH value of 7.4 and shaken at 130 rpm (37 °C). After determined time intervals, 3.0 ml of the solution was withdrawn and replaced with the same amount of fresh buffer solution in order to maintain a constant volume release medium. The amount of IBU released from the fabricated films was determined using UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 60 Spectrophotometer) by measuring the intensity of the UV absorbance at 265 nm. The% cumulative release was calculated as; (5) % c u m u l a t i v e r e l e a s e = [ C n + 3 20 ∑ C n − 1 ] * 1000 Where Cn and C n − 1 are the amount of drug released at the time n and n-1, respectively."
9,Kinetics of ibu release,"2.8 Kinetics of ibu release Drug release from hydrogels involve simultaneous processes of water absorption and drug desorption. The desorbed drug then diffuses through the swollen film by diffusion [30], and thus the transport rate is controlled by diffusion and/or swelling. In hydrophilic polymers erosion and rapid destruction may accompany swelling which eventually contributes to the drug release rate [31,32]. For diffusion-controlled systems, Fickian model of release kinetics is valid and the release profile can be obtained by the solution of Fick's second law of diffusion [32]. Meanwhile when swelling dominates, the release process follows zero order kinetics and is called as Case II transport. In anomalous or non-Fickian type transport, diffusion, swelling and erosion mechanisms all contribute to the transport rate. Mathematical models corresponding to the described conditions are zero order, first order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas-Sahlin models which are provided through Eqs. (6)–(10). (6) M t = M 0 + k 0 t (7) l o g M t = l o g M 0 − k 1 t / 2.303 (8) M t = k H t 1 / 2 (9) M t M ∞ = k K P t n (10) M t M ∞ = k D t m + k R t 2 m Herein, M t and M 0 are the amounts of dissolved drug in release medium (mg IBU per g carrier) at any time t (h) and under initial conditions, respectively. Likewise, M∞ is the amount of drug released at infinite time. In each of the equations, release rate constants are represented by the letter k with the subscripts 0, 1, H, KP, D and R denoting zero order, first order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer Peppas, diffusion and relaxation, respectively. The exponent n is specific to the geometry and is used as identifier of transport mechanism [27,32]. For slab geometry, corresponding values of n are 0.5 for Fickian diffusion and 1.0 for non-Fickian diffusion. The values of n within 0.5 to 1.0 are indicative of anomalous transport and above 1.0 Super Case II transport occurs [32,33]. Peppas-Sahlin model includes the exponential constant m which is also dependent upon the respective proportions of delivery device, i.e. the ratio of film diameter to film thickness. The corresponding value of m was specified as 0.5 for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN films involved in this study. The ratio of relaxational transport (R) over Fickian term (F) can be calculated based on Eq. (11) [34]. (11) R F = k R k D t m The initial 60% of IBU release profiles from CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN were correlated with zero order, first order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas Sahlin models so as to describe drug release kinetics. The data were fitted to these models using nonlinear regression tool of POLYMATH 6.10. Confidence limit was taken as 95% in estimation of model parameters. Model precision was evaluated based on the values of regression coefficient (R2) and variance (σ2) calculated via Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively. (12) R 2 = ∑ ( M t , e x p − M t , c a l c ¯ ) 2 ∑ ( M t , e x p − M t , c a l c ¯ ) 2 + ( M t , e x p − M t , c a l c ) 2 (13) σ 2 = ∑ ( M t , e x p − M t , c a l c ) 2 N − K where Mt,exp and Mt,calc represent the experimental value and model estimation for the amounts of dissolved drug in release medium (mg IBU per g carrier) at any time t. N is the number of runs and K is the number of estimated parameters."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism Software (V.5, San Diego, USA) was used for statistical analysis. One way ANOVA was performed to compare the difference between applicable groups. The results were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) within the 95% confidence level."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Film production,"3.1 Film production Drug delivery systems are generally produced by two major routes of the first involving fabrication of a scaffold and successive loading of the drug. On the other hand, the second route is a one step procedure in which the drug is already encapsulated in matrix formulation [29]. The latter method is restricted by attaining homogeneous distribution of the drug within the whole matrix without sacrificing from functional properties desired for healing applications. Keeping these constraints in mind, production of anti-inflammatory drug embedded CS/PVA based blend films was aimed in this study. Crosslinking process was carried out to achieve enhanced mechanical performance and stability. For this purpose, GEN was used as crosslinking reagent due to its much less toxicity compared to other crosslinking reagents. As listed in Table 1, different amounts of CS, PVA and GEN were used for film production in aim for optimizing film properties and homogeneity of drug distribution. IBU was chosen as the model drug to provide anti-inflammatory effect. The optimization studies involved two consecutive steps of which the former was determination of CS to PVA ratio (samples 1–6). Amongst the synthesized films, CS/PVA 2:3 was superior in terms of retaining film structure in solution, film flexibility in dry state and homogeneity of drug distribution (see Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, this formulation was presented as the base case in discussions about the effects of cross-linking on material characteristics and drug release. In the latter step, the effect of cross-linking on the above mentioned properties were studied as a function of GEN concentration. Selection of the optimal GEN content was not only based on physical properties but also on swelling and release behavior as discussed in preceding sections."
13,Film characterization,"3.2 Film characterization The FT-IR spectra of CS/PVA, CS/PVA/GEN, and IBU loaded CS/PVA/GEN blend films are depicted in Fig. 1 . In all spectra, the major peaks of CS were observed at about 3250 cm−1 (-OH and –NH stretching), 2906 and 2942 cm−1 (CH symmetric and asymmetric stretching), 1085 cm−1 (CN stretching), 1155 cm−1 (asymmetric stretching of COC bridge) and 1560 cm−1 (NH bending of amide III) in both spectra. Additionally, the peaks at 1648 cm−1 (C = O stretching of amide I) and 1329 cm−1 (CN stretching of amide III) corresponded to the presence of residual N-acetyl groups of CS [29]. The bands at 1707 cm−1 and 1409 cm−1 are due to the characteristic stretching of C = O and CH bending of PVA, respectively. Moreover, the absorption bands at 843 and 917 cm−1 were assigned to CH rocking of PVA [35]. The characteristic peaks of CS/PVA were preserved after the incorporation of GEN into the structure with the exception of slight shifting towards lower frequencies due to conformational changes in the blend film. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between –NH and –OH groups of CS and PVA are visualized at 918 cm−1 both for crosslinked and noncrosslinked samples [36]. Yet, significant changes were observed in the relative intensities of the peaks at 1648–1650 cm−1 and 1560 cm−1 due to the interaction between primary amine and ester groups of CS and GEN structures, respectively. The plausible reaction pathways for this interaction have been previously discussed to start either by a nucleophilic attack from the primary amines of CS on the C3 carbon atom of GEN, or by a nucleophilic substitution reaction which leads to the conversion of primary amines to secondary amides and end with the formation of a cross-linked heterocyclic structure [37]. The increased intensity ratio of 1648 cm−1 to 1560 cm−1 corroborates the latter mechanism [29]. Based on these observations and recent literature [36–38], it can be hypothesized that covalent bonding occurs via amino groups of CS rather than hydroxyl groups of PVA. Moreover, diminishing of the peaks at 750–500 cm−1 region, which are the fingerprints of the saccharine structure of CS, ascertained the formation of amide-type bonds between GEN and CS [14,39]. A comparison of the FTIR spectra of plain CS/PVA/GEN and IBU loaded CS/PVA/GEN blend films exposed strong interactions between IBU and blend components. After the incorporation of IBU into the structure, the common characteristic C = O stretching peak of IBU and PVA located at 1709 cm−1 was disappeared and the CN band of the polymeric network arising from CS counterparts was shifted from 1085 cm−1 to 1065 cm−1 [40,41]. The latter was as a result of amide bond formation between carboxylic and amino groups of IBU and CS [42,43]. All changes in 500–950 cm−1 region were assigned to characteristic CH bending of IBU [44]. The significant decreases observed for the peaks at about 3200 and 2900 cm−1 were attributed to the interaction between hydroxyl groups of PVA and GEN and carbonyl group of IBU through hydrogen bonding [41,45,46]. Furthermore, the decreased intensity of the peaks around 2100 and 1900 cm−1 were possibly due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the polymeric network [47]. In the light of these observations a reaction mechanism was proposed and depicted in Scheme 1. Fig. 2 a-d presents the SEM morphologies of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN blend films. As shown on Fig. 2a-b, the surface of CS/PVA film is quite compact and uniform. The homogeneous appearance of the films indicated good miscibility of CS and PVA phases [48]. Surface roughness increased notably after crosslinking (Fig. 2c-d) due to the increased intermolecular attachment between polymeric chains [49] and was corroborant with literature [11,29]. The increase in surface roughness facilitates cell adhesion and thus, it is a favorable property in terms of wound healing applications. The color of the films evolved from transparent yellow to dark-blue in the order of increasing GEN concentration (See Supplementary Fig. 1). Color transformation is characteristic of cross-linking with GEN and is a result of fluorophore formation [50].This further verified the cross-linking reaction between primary amines and GEN through radical polymerization [11,29]. 3.2.1 Cross-linking degree The cross-linking degree of CS/PVA films increased in the order of GEN concentration as shown in Fig. 3 . Significant increments (p<0.001) were recorded in the cross-linking degree for GEN concentrations up to 0.25 mM and reached as high as 35.7 ± 1.0%. Beyond 0.25 mM, the recorded enhancement in the cross-linking degree, i.e. only 3.7%, was not significant to justify the additional consumption of GEN. The calculated cross linking degrees exceed the values reported in literature for CS/PVA films cross-linked with genipin or glutaraldehyde in most of which 30% was declared as an ultimate limit [29,51]. During the cross-linking process, polymerization of GEN is also likely to occur along with the desired cross-linking reaction between GEN and CS/PVA. In order to promote the main cross-linking reaction, process conditions must be chosen accurately. Matcham and Novakovic (2016) have studied the effects of pH, temperature and time on cross-linking density of CS/PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone)/GEN hydrogels by monitoring fluorescence [50]. Though cross-linking was maximized under pH 4.0, 24 °C and over 18 h of cross-linking time, in unregulated pH environment (as it is in our study), 37 °C and 12–15 h of cross-linking period were favorable in terms of the suppression of GEN oligomerisation. However, similar level of 35.4 ± 1.1% was previously published by Yuan et al. who established the determining role of cross-linking time on the cross-linking ratio of chitosan microspheres [52]. The average period required for drying of CS/PVA films synthesized in this study was 15 h during which cross-linking proceeded in an unregulated pH environment at 38 C and thus, relatively higher degrees of cross-linking were attributed to the prolonged cross-linking time and optimal drying temperature. 3.2.2 Swelling tests The swelling behavior of CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN films was evaluated in PBS at pH 7.4 and 37 °C referring to physiological conditions of plasmatic environment [53]. The results presented in Fig. 4 revealed that the swelling ratio of CS/PVA/GEN films were lower than CS/PVA films. Furthermore, an evident decline was recorded in the swelling ratios of CS/PVA/GEN blend films in the order of increasing crosslinking reagent (GEN) concentration. This decrease arises from the growing of crosslinking density of the polymer chains and these results are consistent with the crosslinking degree of the synthesized films as previously shown in Fig. 3."
14,Mechanical properties,"3.3 Mechanical properties Elastic modulus and tensile strength of the fabricated films were evaluated in order to observe the effect of GEN concentration on the mechanical performance. As shown in Fig. 5 , elastic modulus increases with increasing the concentration of GEN which causes reducing the chain mobility of network [49]. Crosslinking process forms a three-dimensional network structure by providing a reinforcement of polymeric chain interactions [54]. Therefore, intermolecular forces became more dominant and tensile strength of the CS/PVA film increased by 1.8 folds from 24.4 ± 4.2 MPa to 44.9 ± 5.1 MPa after crosslinking. Advances within 1.1–1.4 folds were previously declared for tensile strength of CS membranes cross-linked with GEN and CS/PVA blends cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, respectively [51,55]. The measured tensile strength values exceed 21.8 MPa reported in literature for CS/PVA blends with the same composition, previously [1]. On the other hand, it is worth noting that there was a decrement in tensile strength as the concentration of GEN was further increased to 0.001 M. This behavior could be related to the disrupted interactions of hydrogen bonds due to crosslinking CS/PVA with a relatively higher concentration of GEN. This phenomenon was also observed previously for CS and CS/PVA membranes [51,56]."
15,Cytotoxicity tests,"3.4 Cytotoxicity tests L929 cells (Murine Fibroblast) were employed to investigate cytotoxic effect of CS/PVA 2:3 and CS/PVA/GEN 2:3/1.0 films. As shown in Fig. 6 , both CS/PVA 2:3 and CS/PVA/GEN 2:3/1.0 films showed more than 96% of cell viability compared to that of control group, which means that fabricated films possessed great cytocompatibility for wound healing applications."
16,Water vapor transmission rate,"3.5 Water vapor transmission rate An ideal wound dressing should provide an adequate level of moisture in order to prevent wound dehydration and excess accumulation of wound exudates [57]. Normal skin removes water vapor at the rate of 190–215 g H2O/day.m2 and this value increases as a function of the wound degree for injured skins [58]. The WVTR of CS/PVA 2:3 and CS/PVA/GEN 2:3/0.25 films were found as 240 g H2O/day.m2 and 227 g H2O/day.m2, respectively. Consequently, the WVTR results of both obtained films could be considered as being close to the ideal range for wound healing applications. The reduction in WVTR after crosslinking is consistent with literature and related to the increased density of the polymer network with lower free volume, which hinders the diffusion of water molecules [29,36]."
17,In vitro drug release studies,"3.6 In vitro drug release studies In vitro IBU release behaviors of CS/PVA and crosslinked CS/PVA/GEN films were performed at pH 7.4, resembling physiological conditions of plasmatic environment [53]. After 4 h of drug release, the cumulative release percentages of IBU were found as 86.0% and 75.4% for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN blend films, respectively. As seen in Fig. 7 , the IBU release from crosslinked CS/PVA/GEN film occurred at a slower rate than CS/PVA film. This behavior could be explained by the formation of strong interactions in the network structure through crosslinking process. Thus, IBU release from crosslinked film occurred by a more controlled manner in longer elution span. Besides, the burst release leading to significant amount of drug release in a short time was observed for CS/PVA films. The release results indicated that the incorporation of GEN as a crosslinking reagent had an important effect on IBU release via decreasing the burst effect."
18,Kinetic studies,"3.7 Kinetic studies Fig. 7 shows the cumulative percentage of IBU released as a function of time for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN. Evidently, more than 80% of the drug is released within 24 h. However the release rate was decelerated for CS/PVA/GEN. The decrease in drug release rate was mainly related to the reduced swelling ability of the blend after crosslinking [10]. The results obtained from regression analysis of data from drug release experiments were provided on Table 2 . The conformation of models to experimental data is also provided in Fig. 8 (a-b) for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN, respectively. The conformity of experimental data to various mathematical models describing drug release provides insights about the mechanism of drug transport. While diffusion is the prevailing mechanism for drug release from non-biodegradable polymers, swelling and erosion might take over in biodegradable polymeric carriers [32]. According to the results listed in Table 2, zero order, first order and Higuchi mathematical models that are indicative of diffusion controlled systems, failed in the description of IBU release from CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN. The corresponding regression coefficients (R2) for these models were lower than that of semi-empirical equations of Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas-Sahlin. Korsmeyer-Peppas model not only provided the highest R2 but also the lowest variance values (σ2) with randomly distributed residuals. The diffusional exponent (n) in Korsmeyer Peppas model was estimated as 0.31 and 0.68 for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN, respectively. These values of n implied that an anomalous transport mechanism combining Fickian diffusion and relaxation was valid in IBU release from the synthesized matrices [31,32,34,59]. However, the relative contributions of drug diffusion and polymer relaxation could not be evaluated using Eq. (9) due to the negative relaxational coefficient for CS/PVA and the large magnitude of deviations in estimated model coefficients for CS/PVA/GEN."
19,Conclusion,"IBU encapsulated CS/PVA and its GEN cross-linked counterparts were successfully prepared with different formulations so as to study the effects on swelling, physical morphology and mechanical characteristics. CS/PVA blend with 2:3 ratio was selected for loading and release studies mainly due to acceptable physical durability and swelling degree. IBU encapsulation was achieved with a good solubility owing to polymeric film medium constituents. An optimized concentration of GEN was postulated as 0.25 mM at which ultimate tensile strength of 44.9 ± 5.1 MPa was recorded. Cross-linking with GEN prohibited burst release and the release from cross-linked matrix was reduced by approximately 50% by the end of the first hour of operation. Data obtained from in vitro drug release experiments were adjusted to mathematical models by nonlinear regression. Highest correlation was recorded with Korsmeyer Peppas model which proved that a complex transport system involving diffusion and polymer relaxation prevailed for CS/PVA and CS/PVA/GEN. The resulting matrix passed cytotoxicity tests with over 96% cell viability implying the biocompatibility of produced blends. In regards to its mechanical durability and release properties, it can be concluded that IBU encapsulated CS/PVA/GEN film could function effectively as pain suppressing wound dressing material. Further studies should involve antibacterial testing and in vivo IBU release to elucidate the real performance of CS/PVA/GEN in wound site."
