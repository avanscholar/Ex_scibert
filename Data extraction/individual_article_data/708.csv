0,Introduction,"The increasing world energy demand has led to more than 11 billion tonnes of fossil fuel consumption per year and it is anticipated that the oil deposit will be completely absorbed by the year of 2042 (Shafiee and Topal, 2009). In this context, hydrogen is considered as promising mobility fuel because of its high energy yield i.e approx 143 MJ kg−1 and produces water as a byproduct after combustion (Dashti et al., 2018; Parker et al., 2018). Hydrogen could be a substitute for fossil fuels due to its potentially higher efficiency of conversion to useable power, non-polluting nature and high energy density (Cox, 2018; Rezakazemi et al., 2012). Among the different technologies used for hydrogen production, the biological means of hydrogen production through the fermentative process under ambient environmental conditions is one of the promising approaches towards sustainable hydrogen production (Alexandropoulou et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2017). The development of sustainable biohydrogen production is of great interest as it uses agroindustry wastewater and solid waste as feedstock which promotes environmental and economic advantages (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017; Wang and Yin, 2018). The palm oil-based industries have a major contribution for producing organic-rich palm oil mill effluent (POME) wastewater in Malaysia. The high nutrient content in POME makes it an ideal fermentation medium for anaerobic treatment processes. Previous reports have shown that POME could be utilized as a substrate for hydrogen production (Choong et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2017). As the biomass transformation into the H2 is a complex biological process, it significantly influenced by different physicochemical parameters including substrate concentration, substrate-inoculum ratio, initial pH, etc. (Han et al., 2017; Haron et al., 2018). However, the inappropriate/uncontrolled process parameters alter the metabolic pathways of hydrogen producing inoculum, which leads partial degradation of carbohydrates or conversion of sugars into metabolites other than H2 (Angeriz-Campoy et al., 2017). The optimization of fermentative conditions, particularly the operational parameters including initial pH and substrate-inoculum ratio are very important factors for controlled fermentative H2 production (Elreedy et al., 2017). The statistical approach especially response surface methodology (RSM) is considered as an effective approach to observe the interactive effect of multiple variables in a response. Recently, the RSM has been used for optimizing process parameter of fermentative H2 from different wastewaters (Mishra et al., 2018a). The substrate type and its concentration influences the microbial growth and consequently the hydrogen productivity (Batista et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2018a,b). Different fermentative inoculum can be stabilized with variation in the optimal substrate concentrations, therefore it is important to determine the optimal ranges (Islam et al., 2017). The excess addition of sludge/inoculum results the enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity, which increases the alcohol production and lower hydrogen production (Leskovac et al., 2002; Mishra et al., 2017). Recently, Elreedy et al. (2017) reported the impact of inoculum-substrate ratio on hydrogen production. They reported the maximum hydrogen yield of 22.27 ± 1.1 mL/g-COD initial at the optimal inoculum-substrate ratio of 3.78 g VSS/g-COD, when mono-ethylene glycol contaminated wastewater and dark fermentative sludge was subjected as substrate and inoculum, respectively (Elreedy et al., 2017). Although several studies have been investigated the impact of various operational process-parameters (pH, HRT, stirring rate, substrate concentration, inoculum concentrations etc.) on dark fermentative hydrogen production from POME. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of substrate-inoculum ratio on hydrogen production from ultrasonicated POME wastewater has not been studied. Furthermore, the kinetics study of dark fermentative hydrogen production from POME is emergent to understand more about the dark fermentative performance of POME to improve hydrogen productivity. Therefore, this study emphasized the effect of substrate-inoculum ratio on H2 production from POME using heat activated sludge as inoculum. The Kinetics of H2 production was evaluated applying Gompertz equation to measure the H2 production rate, H2 production potential, and the lag phase, using cumulative H2 production from experimental data. Further, the substate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME was statistically optimized using RSM and the interactive effects of these variables on H2 production were studied using perturbation plot and response surface plot."
1,Experimental section,
2,Substrate and inoculum,"2.1 Substrate and inoculum POME sludge and fresh POME were collected from an anaerobic pond of FELDA palm oil industry, Lepar Hilir, Gambang, Pahang, Malaysia at the geographical point of (3°38ˈ20.73ˈˈN, 103°00ˈ39.39ˈˈE) and (3°38ˈ38.19ˈˈN, 103°00ˈ35.64ˈˈE), respectively. POME was manually filtered using 2 mm laboratory sieve to remove the coarse particles and kept in laboratory refrigerator with temperature below −20 °C (Glass Door Chiller Chill-1050, Tech-Lab Scientific Sdn. Bhd, Malaysia) to prevent microbial activity such as biomass degradation (acidification) by indigenous microbes. Furthermore, POME was ultrasonically pretreated using probe-type sonicator (Q700, Qsonica, New Town, CT) at 0.13 kw/20 khz, without controlling pH and temperature. The observed COD, TS, VS and initial pH of POME were 5.2 ± 0.5 g.L−1, 3.6 ± 0.3g.L−1, 1.3 ± 0.5 g.L−1and 6.4 ± 0.3, respectively. The concentrations of TS and VS in seed sludge were 13.5 ± 0.4 g/L and 8.52 ± 0.13 g/L, respectively."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up The experiments were designed to investigate the impact of substrate-inoculum ratio to enhance the hydrogen production utilizing ultrasonicated POME wastewater as substrate. The diagrammatic representation of the experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The experiments were performed in batch mode using a series of Scott bottles with a working volume of 350 mL. Each reactor was filled with the ultra-sonicated POME and further inoculated with heat-treated sludge (70 °C for 10 min; 90 °C and 110 °C for 10 min to deactivate the methanogens) with autoclaved water to get substrate-inoculum ratio (COD/VS) of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. The COD level of POME was kept constant at the 1.3 ± 0.5 gCOD/L (by diluting with autoclaved water), in all batches. The sludge concentrations added to the POME were 6.50, 3.40, 2.10, 1.60, and 1.30 g-VS L−1, to balance the substrate-inoculum ratios of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. Each batch test was also supplemented with the nutrients (g/L) 10, glucose; 1, yeast extract; 3, peptone; 1, KH2PO4; 0.5, K2HPO4; 0.1 MgCl2, and 0.001, resazurin for the initial acclimatization of inoculum. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 by adding 1 N NaOH to the POME. Each reactor was flushed with oxygen-free nitrogen gas (˃99.5% purity) for 1 min with the flow rate of 250 mL/min and the temperature of the reactors was kept constant at 37 ± 2 °C using temperature-controlled stirrer with stirring rate of 120 rpm/min."
4,Analytical,"2.3 Analytical The H2 content in produced gas was analysed using Gas chromatograph (GCMS-QP, 2010; Shimadzu, Japan) which equipped with the thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD); stainless steel column (1.5 m, SS350A); molecular sieve of 80/100 mesh; and the N2 gas was used as carrier gas. The operational conditions for GC were followed accordingly to our previous literature (Mishra et al., 2018b). COD, BOD, Total solids, oil concentrations and volatile suspended solids were analysed by following APHA standards methods (Eaton et al., 2005). The H2 production performance for kinetic studies was investigated corresponds to cumulative H2 production in each batch operations. The H2 yields were calculated by dividing the amount of H2 produced over the COD amount consumed (L/g-CODconsumed)."
5,Results and discussions,
6,Kinetic analysis of H2 production,"3.1 Kinetic analysis of H2 production The hydrogen potential at different SIR was studied by using Gompertz model in a batch experiment. The substrate-inoculum ratio effects to the COD, BOD, pH, oil concentrations, total solids and VSS of dark fermentative effluents as we can observe from Table 1 . The cumulative H2 production calculation during the experimentation was applied to fit in the Gompertz equation (Argun and Dao, 2017). The observed correlation coefficient was ranges from 0.879 to 0.992. These values showed that the Gompertz equation can be used to calculate H2 production potential, production rate and lag period. (1) H ( t ) = P . e x p { − e x p [ R m . e P ( ρ − t ) + 1 ] } where H(t) is cumulative H2 production, P is the maximum H2 production potential, Rm is H2 production rate, and ρ is the lag period. The cumulative H2 production curves obtained from experiments at the different ratio (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) of substrate-inoculum ratio are illustrated in Fig. 2 . During the process, only hydrogen and carbon dioxide production was observed, no methane was detected during the experiment. Curve fitting on the experimental data showed that substrate-inoculum ratios could be effective for H2 production potential as well as H2 production rate. The substrate-inoculum ratios effects on H2 production potential (P), production rate (Rm), were analysed using Gompertz equation (eq. (1)) summarized in Table 2 . The maximum H2 production of 448 mL H2 was observed at the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.6; however, the highest production rate of 17.98 mLH2/h was observed at 0.4. The H2 production potential was enhanced with increasing substrate-inoculum ratio from 0.2 to 0.6 and reduced by the further increase in substrate-inoculum ratio from 0.6 to 1.0. The hydrogen production rate was apparently decreased by increasing substrate-inoculum ratio value from 0.4 to 1.0. The variations in cumulative H2 production corresponds to different substrate-inoculum ratios is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the H2 production increased with the increased proportion of 0.2–0.6. The highest hydrogen production potential (P) of 448 mL H2 was observed at the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.6 with the minimum lag-phase ( ρ ) of 8.2 h. Whereas, the Rm of 17.9 mL H2/h with the ρ of 16.8 h were observed at the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.4. The reason for increase cumulative hydrogen production up to the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.6 might be due to the balance substrate for hydrogen producing inoculum while the higher inoculum concentration into the substrate led to production of metabolites products other than the hydrogen. These results are consistent with existing literature. Cappai et al. (2015) investigated the inoculum-to-substrate ratio (g-VSinoculum/g-VSSubstrate) at the operational conditions of temperature 39 °C; pH: 6.5, to observe the effect of parameters on hydrogen production. They concluded that the lower value of inoculum-substrate ratio decreases the H2 production due to the limitation of microbial biomass hydrolysis (Cappai et al., 2015). The variation of biohydrogen production by varying the inoculum addition was also reported by Argun and dao, (2017), and they found that the maximum H2 yield of 123.27 mL g/TOC with 5% of inoculum concentration. While the further decrease in yield was observed by increasing concentration of inoculum. The substrate concentration is considered as one of the critical factors in the microenvironment for H2 producing bacterium. High level of the substrate, ensuring the rapid diffusion of substrate into the inoculum. However, as shown in Table 2, when the substrate-inoculum ratio was higher than 0.6, H2 production potential and rate were gradually decreased, which could be attributed to the maximum consumption of substrate by inoculum for their growth instead of H2 producing metabolic pathways."
7,Statistical optimization of substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME,"3.2 Statistical optimization of substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME 3.2.1 Statistical optimization of dark fermentation H2 production using RSM The central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize H2 production using substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME as variables and H2 yield as a response. The optimal substrate-inoculum ratio of the fermentative medium facilitates the metabolic activity for hydrogen generation and prevents the substrate-inhibition during the fermentative processes (Akhlaghi et al., 2017). On the other hand, the pH of the dark fermentative substrate is considered as one of the crucial factors for biohydrogen production, as it affects the hydrogenase activity of inoculum and other metabolic pathways (Logan et al., 2002). The Design of expert (version-7.1.6) was used to set experimental series of 13 runs, where the substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME were varied from 0.4 to 0.6 and 4.0 to 6.0, respectively corresponding to the hydrogen yield as a response. The optimum level of substrate-inoculum ratio, initial pH and their interactive-interactions were analysed using CCD. The multiple-regression analysis (Table 3 ) observed using the experimental values suggest, that the reaction followed the second order polynomial equation for H2 yield, Eq. (2) (coded) and Eq. (3) (actual). (2) Y = 40 − 6.958 X 1 + 0.016 X 2 − 0.015 X 1 X 2 − 0.58 X 1 2 − 0.56 X 2 2 (3) Y = − 2.8873 + 6.492 SIR + 0.6548 pH − 0.1475 SIR pH − 5.825 S I R 2 − 0.056 p H 2 where, Y represents the H2 yield and X1 and X2 defiend the substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of medium, respectively. The ANOVA of the present model suggests the well-fit response surface for H2 yield and quadratic model having F-value of 5.14 as illustrated in Table 4 . The 5.14 value of Model-F-value implies the significance of the model. Further, Model P-value suggested that there is only 2.69% chance that model value is large due to noise. The model predicted [initial pH], [substrate-inoclum ratio]2, and [initial pH]2 as significant model terms and ANOVA showed that the experimental data is statistically significant. 3.2.2 Perturbation plot analysis The interactive effect of these two variables at the single point of response can be observed by statistical design using perturbation plot. The effect on response due to variations in the variable is varied away from the single reference point when one variable remains constant (Taherdanak et al., 2015). The sheerness of the curvature in the perturbation plot reflects that how much sensitive is a response when there are changes even in one variable. While the flatness of line represents the lack of significance on the variable on response (Mishra et al., 2018a). Here, the perturbation plot was applied to analyse the H2 yield as response and substrate-inoculum ratio along with the initial pH as variables in designing the central-point, Fig. 3 . It can be observed from Fig. 3, the substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH have a significant impact on H2 yield. The maximum H2 yield of 0.416 L.H2/g-CODremoved was obtained at the substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of 0.5 and 5.0, respectively. The perturbation plot indicating the positive effect of substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH during fermentative H2 production from POME. This could be explained as the pH provides an optimal protonic-balance inside the inoculum to channelize the oxidation-reduction-based processes properly. While the optimal concentration of organic matter for microbial growth which influences the H2 production. 3.2.3 Response surface and contour plot analysis The level of process parameters (variables) are shown in Table 5 and the measured hydrogen yield; Y (response) was also listed in Table 5. Fig. 4 illustrates the predicted and actual plots for hydrogen yields. It can be observed that from Fig. 4 (a), the predicted values are close to the actual ones, which validates the current model. Moreover, the residual error is very low as presented in Fig. 4b. The predicted and actual values show good agreement as the observed residual values are low. Response surface plot and contour plots are shown in Fig. 5 , which depicts the interactions between two variables for hydrogen production from POME. The hydrogen range was from 0.251 to 0.416 LH2/g-CODremoved (Table 5), which depicts the interaction between two variables for hydrogen production from POME. The surface confined in the smallest ellipse in the contour diagram indicates the maximum predicted values. A significant increase in H2 yield was found at the initial pH varies from 4.0 to 6.0; the H2 yield of 0.416 L.H2/g-CODremoved observed at initial pH of 5.0 after 100 h of fermentation. Similarly, substrate-inoculum ratio showed a significant increase in H2 yield when it varies from 0.30 to 0.60; the maximum H2 yield of 0.416 L.H2/g-CODremoved was observed at a substrate-inoculum ratio of 5.0. However, the hydrogen yield is decreased to 0.251 0.416 L.H2/g-CODremoved in batch test operated at substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of 0.30 and 6.0, respectively in the following fermentation period. The spire at the surface plot (Fig. 5a), indicating that the maximum H2 production could be achieved in the following experimental ranges. While, the contour plot (Fig. 5b), showed that the dependency of H2 production on substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME, and shows the maximum H2 production is attainable at the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.3 to 0.3 and initial pH of 4–5. This clearly suggests that the initial pH of the POME is effective for H2 production when the substrate-inoculum ratios were varied in it. These results are inconsistent with the various literature where the optimal pH of the POME was observed for the maximum hydrogen production between 5 and 6 (Mishra et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2013). The lower pH of the medium is more suitable for conversion of the acid to alcohol, which results in the lowering in H2 productivity, especially when the sludge was used as inoculum in fermentative medium (Qiu et al., 2016). The performance of microbial communities is influenced by the medium pH as it not only playing an important role in bacterial growth but also effects bacterial metabolism and physiology. Dark fermentative H2 production at low pH boosted the proton transfer rates and thereby achieved high availability of proton which results in increased H2 productivity (Islam et al., 2017). Overall, it was observed that substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of POME had a significant impact on fermentative hydrogen production when active sludge was used as inoculum. The cumulative H2 production in batch mode experiment simulated by using the Gompertz model and the interactive-interaction of substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH of H2 production was illustrated successfully using response surface and contour plot. 3.2.4 Validation The validation experiment for the optimum level of variables is very important to validate the developed empirical model. The experiments were conducted to relate the experimental results with the predicted values from the model equations. The performing experiments were set at the parameters as described in Table 6 , substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.49 and initial pH of 5.1. The experiments were conducted in triplicates to get a significant value of H2 yield. Under the optimized substrate-inoculum ratio and initial pH the observed H2 yield was 0.374 ± 0.06 L.H2/g-CODremoved which showed a good agreement with the predicted H2 yield of 0.397 L.H2/g-CODremoved. The correlation between the predicted and experimental values verifies the validation of the model and the existence of an optimal point."
8,Conclusion,"The present study was conducted to evaluate optimum operational conditions for establishing higher metabolism/kinetics by hydrogen producing fermentative archea from activated sludge. In this regard, the performance of hydrogen production was evaluated using different ratio of substrate-inoculm. Among them, 0.6 substrate-inoculum ratio was found to be potential for maximum hydrogen potential (448 mL H2), short lag phases (8.2 h) and maximum hydrogen production rate (14.62 mL H2 h-1). Furthermore, statistical optimization using response surface methodology; substrate-inoculum ratio, as well as initial pH, have proved to be an important factor to enhance hydrogen production. The maximum yield H2 yield of 0.416 L H2/g-CODremoval was observed at the optimum conditions of the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.5 and an initial pH of 5.0. Conclusively, these results could be useful for providing insight and extrapolation to fermentative hydrogen production studies by using various wastewater."
