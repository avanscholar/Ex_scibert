0,Introduction,"H2-SCR is considered to be the most promising green technology to replace the current NH3-SCR technology. Its low-temperature operation can make (dispel nitrogen oxides, deNOx) equipment more flexible and have no harmful by-product emissions, thereby more environmentally friendly. Pt or Pd catalysts supported or doped on various supporters, such as zeolites [1-4], nonzeolitic metal oxides [5-7], spinel [8-10], and perovskite [11-13] were widely investigated under hydrogen SCR conditions, which have good deNOx activity in the temperature range from 150 °C to 400 °C. However, many practical reasons restricted its application: (1) the stable N-O bond has a high activation energy (201 kJ mol−1), which blocks the kinetics of H2-SCR; (2) the relatively scarce supply of H2 (0.5% − 2%) leads to an inevitable energy loss and low utilization rate of H2; (3) the supply of H2 as a fixed source causes hidden dangers in transportation and storage safety. Based on the above factors that impede the practical application, we believe that developing a more low-temperature inline hydrogen production technology and coupled the low temperature generated inline hydrogen to remove nitrogen oxides are a more promising deNOx way. Various technologies for hydrogen production from alcohols have been widely used [14-16]. Methanol steam reforming (MSR) technology shows great potential in industry application. Methanol stands out because of its high C-H ratio, no stable C-C bond, liquid form at room temperature, and considerable hydrogen production capacity. In addition, its product has a low CO concentration and reaction temperature, so it is the best choice for inline hydrogen production. Many studies are devoted to developing more active centers of the MSR, and the Cu [17-19] and Pd [20,21] species play a critical role. Due to the low cost, large reserves, and high conversion rate of hydrogen production, Cu-based catalysts are more utilized. CuO-ZnO [16], CuO-Al2O3 [18], CuO-CeO2 [22], CuO-ZrO2 [23,24] have been extensively studied; much of them are supported catalysts. For the supported catalyst, the size of the active center metal particles is the critical factor in determining the catalyst's performance. Generally, the smaller the metal particle size of the active center is, the better the catalyst activity would be, but the surface free energy would also increase significantly, which would lead to a certain degree of aggregation [25]. Yang and Liao [26] prepared Cu/ZnO/CNT catalysts with different metal loadings. MSR test results showed that the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO/CNT catalyst initially increased with the increase of total metal loadings. However, when the total metal loadings reached 30 wt%, the catalytic activity began to decline. Therefore, they believe that high content of metals can cause partial destruction of structures or metal aggregation, leading to a decreased activity. In industry, carriers with solid interaction with active components are usually used to avoid surface agglomeration to form stable and dispersed metal clusters with high catalytic activity. However, the catalysts prepared by loading methods are complex to guarantee the dispersion of the surface-loaded metals, usually producing clusters of different sizes. Such heterogeneous properties would reduce the efficiency of active components and lead to unnecessary side reactions. Therefore, developing a copper-based catalyst with more dispersed active sites is the key to complete the low-temperature MSR coupled SCR process. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), formed by bridging ligands other than transition metals and oxygen, are immobilized in specific structures due to the internal metal valence bonds, which provide a new possibility for exposing and dispersing specific active components [27-31]. Due to the coordination of the central metal ions with the solvent molecules such as water molecules and ethanol molecules, the theoretically unsaturated sites can be established in frameworks. Utilizing calcination or vacuum treatment, MOFs can expose these unsaturated sites easily. Cu-BTC (or HKUST-1) has a typical regular framework composed of two polycarboxylic acid copper units created by Cu ions and carboxylate oxygen atoms [32]. The Cu-based catalysts can be used as reactive species for methanol steam reforming. Therefore, the Cu-BTC framework is chosen as a precursor material for MSR reaction in this trial. We use MOFs as a sacrificial template and their carboxylate oxygen to calcine and restore Cu clusters in the nitrogen atmosphere. The stable structure of MOFs itself fixed Cu clusters' position, leaving Cu and C species after calcination, thus preparing Cux/C (x = 400,600,800) materials. After the characterization of FESEM, the original Cu-MOF morphology and regular Cu-polyatomic clusters were visible, making the active sites arranged regularly and avoiding the side effects of aggregation. Therefore, this paper optimized the inline hydrogen production coupling deNOx process: using Cu-BTC as the precursor, the Cu-polyatomic-cluster CuxC catalyst with the regular arrangement and uniform dispersion was prepared by calcination and activation, which was used in the inline hydrogen production part. Hence the MSR catalyst with a lower temperature was obtained, which was suitable for inline hydrogen production coupling deNOx process. Simultaneously, we chose the mature low-temperature, high-efficiency deNOx PdOx-Mn3O4@Ni catalyst prepared previously for deNOx. Porous nickel was used to enrich local dilute hydrogen and support load trace Pd modified Mn oxide catalyst and Cux/C catalyst. The hydrogen production efficiency of Cux/C series catalysts and the deNOx efficiency of Cux/C series catalysts after coupling were investigated. In the deNOx stage, online-GC could monitor the visible hydrogen production, which proved this process's feasibility. The effects of different GHSV and water vapor on the H2-SCR deNOx activity were tested under the coupling process conditions. XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS, Raman, FTIR, and other characterization methods were used to reveal the catalyst's morphology and composition characteristics and explained the possible reasons for its high efficiency. This work provides a way to prepare the catalyst with a uniform dispersion of active sites and a new approach for the safe implementation of H2-SCR."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of Cux/C-MnPdOx@Ni catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of Cux/C-MnPdOx@Ni catalysts The typical preparation method of Cu-BTC was based on the reported step [28,32,33] by hydrothermal synthesis: 4.5 mmol copper nitrate was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water. 2.5 mmol pyromellitic acid dissolved in 15 ml ethanol was then added into the solution. After stirring for 30 min to mix thoroughly, the mixture was transferred into the lining of a 50 ml Teflon hydrothermal reactor, crystallized at 120 °C for 12 h. The obtained sample was washed several times with ethanol and water and dried at 150 °C for 12 h. The prepared Cu-BTC was calcined under the nitrogen atmosphere of 150 ml/min, and the temperature was set at 400 °C,600 °C,800 °C, respectively. The derivatives were donated as Cu400/C, Cu600/C, and Cu800/C, respectively (abbreviated as Cu-based catalysts). Based on the previous research [34], MnPdOy (with 0.42% Pd content) catalyst(abbreviated as Pd-based catalysts) was synthesized using the one-step hydrothermal method PdCl2, NaOH, NaBH4 as precursors. The target catalyst for foam nickel loading was prepared by the impregnation method. Firstly, the oxide layer on the surface of the foamed nickel was cleaned by hydrochloric acid. Secondly, the prepared Cu-based catalyst and Pd-based catalyst were evenly dispersed in isopropanol solution, and finally, the repetitive loading steps were completed in the 70 °C ovens. The overall loading was about 180 mg, and the Pd-based catalyst was less than 30 mg. The target catalyst was named Cux/C-MnPdOy@Ni, where × represented different calcined temperatures, including 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C, respectively (abbreviated as Cu-Pd-based catalysts)."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Qualitatively analyzed the essential components of the prepared catalysts were revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which were recorded on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.5406 Å) with a range of 5°less than2θ less than 50° and 10°less than2θ less than 80°. The synthesized samples' morphologies and elemental composition characteristics were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Gemini SEM 500) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; Falion 60S). Further, demonstrate the candidates' topographical features were carried on a JEM 2100 analytical electron microscope transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) patterns. The pore volume was calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured from nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis by using Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 instrument. The materials' surface properties and valence states were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis using an ion beam EX06 device and XR6 microfocus monochrome XPS (Al Kα) device. Laster micro Raman spectrometer (Iuvia Reflerx) was utilized to analyze the molecular structure of samples at 532 nm laster, while Fourier transforms infrared spectra (FTIR) was recorded using Thermo NICOLET iS10 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with a frequency range from 4000 to 650 cm−1. In addition, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out with a simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA 449 F3). The temperature range was 0–1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere (20 ml/min)."
4,Catalytic activity procedure,"2.3 Catalytic activity procedure The catalytic test reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed flow reactor, including methanol steam reforming (MSR) and methanol steam reforming selective catalytic reduction (MSR-SCR). The simulated gas was containing water-alcohol ratio (ω) = 1.3 and N2 as balance gas for MSR. For MSR-SCR, the simulated gas comprised 800 ppm NO, water-alcohol ratio (ω) = 1.3, and N2 as balance gas. A Brooks thermal mass flowmeter maintained the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, h−1). The temperature control was acquired at 50–450 °C through K-type thermocouples inside and outside the fixed bed. The effluent's concentration of the gas was recorded using the online chemiluminescent NO-NO2-NOx analyzer (Thermo, 42i model). The final total conversion was calculated with stable data. H2 concentration was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC 7890) equipped with a Hayesep Q column (i.d. 2 mm, length 35 cm) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The NO conversion (%) and GHSV (h−1) are calculated by the equations (1)-(2): (1) NO Conversion ( % ) = [ NO ] in [ NO ] out [ NO ] in × 100 % (2) GHSV ( h - 1 ) = ( F ( CH 3 OH + ωH 2 O ) ∗ ρ mix / ( 32 + 18 ω ) ∗ 22 . 4 ∗ 1000 + F ) ∗ 60 v cat Where [NO] in, [NO] out, represent the inlet and outlet gas concentration of the reaction at each temperature; F(CH3OH + ωH2O) represents the feed rate of methanol and water mixture, ω represents the molar ratio of methanol to water; F represents the total flow of other reaction gases; ρmix represents the density of methanol and water mixture."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the Cux/C-MnPdOy@Ni catalyst,"3.1 Characterization of the Cux/C-MnPdOy@Ni catalyst As the main activity center for hydrogen production, copper species have been extensively confirmed [35,36]. However, in practical applications, the aggregation of copper can lead to catalysts' instability and inactivation. Therefore, we tried to use the organic metal frame structure as a template to obtain its derivatives by calcination at different temperatures under nitrogen protection. The carboxylate oxygen atoms helped reduce the Cu species in the original anchoring position to achieve a more stable and uniform dispersion of the active sites. The smaller the active center's particle size, the higher the catalyst's dispersion, which significantly affects the catalytic efficiency improvement [25]. The XRD patterns were shown in Figure S1, where characteristic peaks at 2θ≈6.5°, 9.5°, 11.5°, and 13.4° [33,37,38] were matched well with typical crystal planes (200), (220), (222), and (400) of HKUST-1/Cu-BTC. The related characteristic peaks of cuprous oxide were not detected in the XRD patterns, indicating the completely reduced synthesized product. HKUST-1/Cu-BTC possesses a tetrahedral structure of the face-centered crystal. Every three Cu2+ linked to four coordination consists of twelve carboxylate oxygen atoms from the two BTC [28] (structure diagram demonstrated in Figure S1 a). After calcination at designated temperature, the surface's composition of Cu species changed to metallic, as shown in Fig. 1 b, and the original octahedron structure was reserved. The remaining structure gave a chance for better anchoring and dispersing Cu species. EDS mapping revealed that the selected region's protruding particles corresponded to the Cu element. The remaining structure was composed of C elements, and the O elements almost disappeared. The multiple copper clusters in the field of vision were precise and uniform. We synthesized MnPdOy catalyst through the one-step hydrothermal method, and the TEM image at a higher resolution of 20 nm exhibited its original structure in Fig. 1e. Its XRD characteristic diagram matched with the Mn3O4; simultaneously, the distinct peaks of Pd or PdO were not detected, which might be related to smaller hydrothermal synthesis particles and evenly dispersed (shown in Figure S1 b). Physical mixing of the above two catalysts and impregnated on the nickel foam surface formed our core catalyst. As shown in Fig. 1c, the white particles on the surface were uniformly dispersed Cu particles. The Cu clusters uniformly arranged on the surface of the octahedron structure formed the active center for hydrogen production. MnPdOy acted as the deNOx active center. The 3D cross-linked structure of foamed nickel buffered the inline hydrogen generated and continuously supplied towards the subsequent denitrification reaction. The inline hydrogen production coupled with deNOx technology became possible. Further enlarged FESEM diagrams visualized 400 °C, 600 °C, 800 °C of the Cux/C catalyst after calcination, corresponding to Fig. 2 a, d, g. The organic framework's oxygen atoms were lost in the nitrogen atmosphere due to calcination, leaving Cu clusters fixed by C, so the octahedral surface became rough, and the structure collapsed. Higher-resolution FESEM images were shown in Fig. 2b, e and h. As the calcination temperature increased, the Cu bulk phase encapsulated by carbon films was gradually exposed. With the burning and consumption of carbon, the Cu metal on the surface gradually increases and maintains a high uniformity. The average particle size of exposed Cu metal at each temperature was calculated using particle size statistical software, as shown in Fig. 2c, f, i. After calcination at 400 °C, the most distributed Cu was 5 nm in diameter, 7 nm at 600 °C, and 3 nm at 800 °C. A single Cu atom diameter was approximate 0.25 nm. Therefore these atoms can be assumed as a stable and dispersed Cu active site formed by multiple copper clusters. Such a structure can effectively avoid the effect of Cu atom agglomeration. A high transmission electron microscopy analyzed the microphase of the samples. Fig. 3 a displayed the morphology of the 800 °C calcined derivatives, in which the dark particles corresponded to Cu clusters, and the films assigned to the amorphous carbon structure gradually formed after calcination. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was captured in the marked area of Fig. 3b, as shown in Fig. 3c. A series of diffuse concentric circles and a diffuse central spot revealed that the carbon belongs to an amorphous state. In Fig. 3d and e, lattice fingerprints were obtained, which belong to different Cu particles' crystal planes. After the measurement, d = 2.07 Å belonged to the (111) crystal plane of Cu, corresponding to the high-intensity diffraction peak at 43.2° in the previous XRD diagram. We also conducted the inverse Fourier transform on the selected area in Fig. 3e, as shown in Fig. 3f. The array was a typical cubic face-centered single crystal, where the measured lattice spacing d = 1.71 Å and d = 1.27 Å corresponded to the (200) and (220) planes of Cu."
7,Optimal inline hydrogen production coupled deNOx,"3.2 Optimal inline hydrogen production coupled deNOx In this section, we explored the hydrogen production capacity of Cux/C@Ni series catalysts, the feasibility of the coupling process, and the denitrification performance of the coupling process. The hydrogen production of the Cux/C@Ni series derivatives was shown in Fig. 4 a, which was enough to meet the hydrogen demand of deNOx. Compared with that, we chose the Cu800/C @Ni catalyst with better hydrogen production capacity to explore the optimal MSR hydrogen production conditions. We elaborated on the hydrogen production coupling hydrogen deNOx process of the best catalyst. The performance of hydrogen production of Cu800/C @Ni was discussed in Fig. 4b. The water-methanol ratios (ω) are critical factors for the hydrogen production efficiency over the MSR catalysts. Here, we had chosen three different conditions of ω = 1.1, 1.3, 1.5. The target catalyst's hydrogen production has been tested at the moderate space velocity of 12000 h−1, and the results were collected by online GC. In the selected conditions, when ω = 1.3, the target catalyst exhibited higher hydrogen production at each temperature. Therefore, we determined ω = 1.3 as a fundamental condition in subsequent experiments. Similarly, space velocity has also affected the performance. As shown in Fig. 4c, the candidates have higher hydrogen production under 12000 h−1 and 22000 h−1 conditions in our tested space velocity range. Therefore, we chose 22000 h−1 space velocity for the following experiment. Previous experiments [39] demonstrated the feasibility of inline hydrogen production coupled with denitrification. We synthesized this homogeneous polyatomic cluster Cu-based catalyst to optimize the hydrogen production effect and improve the reaction performance. Similarly, we have designed relevant experiments to prove the feasibility of the coupling reaction. When the simulated gas was composed of methanol and nitric oxide, the atmosphere of HC-SCR was provided for the system. The Cu-based catalyst could be used as the active center for NO removal, but the highest removal efficiency of both Cu-based and Cu-Pd-based catalysts within 200 °C was less than 60%, which meant that the removal ability of nitrogen oxides was limited. When the composition of simulated gas changed to methanol, water vapor, and nitric oxide, methanol and water vapor could provide a reforming reaction environment. Combined with previous experiments, the pure copper-based catalyst had a particular hydrogen production ability in the reforming environment, and hydrogen production could be detected as early as 150 °C. Therefore the weak denitration ability before 200 °C might be owing to the priority of reforming hydrogen production reaction. Moreover, under the condition of H2-SCR, the Pd-based catalyst has more than 80% denitration efficiency at 80 °C, while the Cu-based catalyst showed poor denitration ability within the temperature of 225 °C. Therefore, it was speculated that the Pd-based catalyst had priority to undertake the active center of hydrogen denitration when both existed together. The amount of hydrogen generated before the 125 °C was lower than that of the detection line, but the improved deNOx efficiency from the reforming atmosphere can be predicted that a certain amount of hydrogen existed at this time. Simultaneously, we detected the production of N2O in the reaction(Figure S2). There may be by-products when hydrogen content was relatively low, but with the increase of hydrogen gas, the by-products N2O disappear, which was consistent with our results. In summary, two separate functional centers on Cu-Pd-based catalyst might be the reason for its excellent denitration ability in the atmosphere of methanol, water, and NO. One was the Cu-based catalyst serving as the active center for hydrogen production, and the other was the Pd-based catalyst as the active denitrification center. The catalyst after coupling has good deNOx performance, as shown in Fig. 4e, which showed the deNOx performance under different space velocity conditions. The candidate can maintain more than 80% removal efficiency in the 12000–32000 h−1 space velocity range. The highest removal efficiencies were all over 80% and could maintain a wide temperature range. When further increased the temperature, the production of hydrogen by MSR is inhibited, thereby leading to the hydrogen used for deNOx decrease, so the deNOx performance was weakened. The moisture in flue gas is usually considered to be harmful to denitration. Thus, we conducted the effect of moisture on the system. As shown in Fig. 4f, the trial was conducted under the condition of ω = 1.3 + 22000 h−1 + 800ppmNO + N2balanced. After deNOx stabilized above 80% in 30 min, 2% of water vapor was introduced, and the conversion rate initially decreased slightly. This may be due to competitive adsorption of NO, H2, and H2O [40-42], resulting in the desorption of NO [43]. With the increase of water vapor concentration to 3% and 5%, the catalyst still can maintain over 70% deNOx conversion in the stable 60 min, indicating that the candidate catalyst has good water resistance."
8,Valence states and redox capacity of the Cux/C @Ni catalyst,"3.3 Valence states and redox capacity of the Cux/C @Ni catalyst Due to the coupling catalyst has better hydrogen production ability at low temperatures, this section mainly focuses on its structural characteristics. The change of the valence state of the catalyst elements and the composition of the surface elements profoundly impact the catalytic activity. Therefore, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to reveal the hydrogen production part of catalyst's surface elements' valence state distribution. The spectrum of each component after treatment was shown in Fig. 5 . Firstly, the surface oxygen components of catalysts usually play an essential role in redox reactions. Fig. 5a revealed that there were mainly two characteristic peaks in the surface oxygen composition of the spectra. The related species were: OH– or CO3 2– adsorbed species within 530.7–531.7 eV and adsorptive water molecules (H2O) larger than 533 eV [44]. Adsorbed oxygen species with the lower surface binding energy were easier to be removed and thus provide more oxygen vacancies, thereby facilitating the catalytic reaction [35,44,45]. With the increase of calcination temperature, the characteristic peak of O1s orbital appeared in the direction of low binding energy, which indicated that O was easy to obtain electrons and generated more lattice oxygen. With the increase of surface Cu exposure, a small part of Cu and O were bounded. The survey spectrum of the elements (Fig. 5c) exhibited that the system's oxygen content tended a significant downward trend. As the main hydrogen production center, the valence state of Cu was also a significant concern. Fig. 5b revealed the characteristic shocking peak belonging to Cu2+, which was existed in the original precursor Cu-BTC. In calcined samples 2–4, the satellite peak of Cu2+ disappeared, and the peak position corresponded to Cu0 or Cu+. With the increase of calcination temperature, the characteristic peak of Cu 2p moved to the direction of high binding energy, indicating that a part of Cu existed in conjunction with O, which was consistent with O 1 s orbit change. To clarify the valence state of Cu species in Cux/C series catalysts, we analyzed the Auger spectrum (Fig. 5c) of Cu, and the sample 1–3 represented the derivatives of calcination temperature of 400, 600, and 800 °C, respectively. The XPS peaks of 916.5 eV, 916.4 eV and 916.9 eV correspond to Cu+, while 918.4 eV,918.5 eV and 918.8 eV correspond Cu0. Above all indicated the Cu species in this system were mixed-valence states with two forms of Cu0 and Cu+ together and served as active sites for methanol production. With the increase of calcination temperature, as shown by FESEM, the number of Cu clusters exposed on the surface increased, which was consistent with the general pattern of XPS. The peak intensity of surface copper increased, even with the content of surface copper increased. Electrons mainly occupy the valence band with low binding energy (less than 15 eV), and their state is related to bonding orbit. Therefore, measuring the spectrum of this region is very useful for understanding the electronic structure of materials. The Cu 3d and O 2p orbital electrons mainly contributed to the valence band spectrum of sample 1. In spectra of samples 2–4, there was a broad peak between 1 and 4eV of binding energy, consistent with the Cu 3d orbit of Cu2O in literature [46]. In the existing Cux/C catalyst system, the highest occupied zone (less than 5 eV) was mainly Cu 3d. Therefore, these materials' physical and chemical properties depended on the chemical state of Cu [47], and the conductivity was more potent than that of the precursor. With the increase of calcination temperature, the binding energy of Cu 3d orbital increased slightly (from 3.1 eV to 3.5 eV). Simultaneously, a small shoulder near the Fermi level (the lowest binding energy) of Cu 3d orbital of the derivative was generated by the ionization of the most stable orbit dZ 2 along the linear bond axis [46]. The electron-rich environment would cause the d-orbital splitting, proving the newly formed amorphous carbon layer provided an environment for electron transport. According to the formula ∫ N ( ε ) εdε / N ( ε ) dε , the corresponding d-band center energy [48] (Fig. 5 f) can be obtained by further integrating the valence band spectrum of sample 2–4, where N ( ε ) was the XPS intensity after deducting the background, and the integral range was from EF to (6 + EF) eV (EF was Fermi energy level). The results indicated that with the increase of calcination temperature, the d-band center energy of the samples was less than that of pure Cu (−3.35 eV). The Cu800/C sample had the lowest d-band center energy (−3.52 eV), which revealed that calcination reduces the d-band center energy of Cu, weakened the adsorption capacity of surface Cu species, and might be conducive to the online desorption of H2 . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can be used to determine the functional groups in materials. The results of this paper were in good agreement with those obtained by previous studies. The Cu-BTC precursor's typical infrared spectrum exhibited the main bonding structure, which mainly contained the surface hydroxyl groups corresponding to the broad peaks between 3700 and 3200 cm−1; the symmetric tensile vibration of C = O corresponding to the peaks between 1900 and 1650 cm−1; C = C and C-O corresponding to the peak at 1653 cm−1 and 1370 cm−1. These results confirmed that the HKUST-1/Cu-BTC framework was consistent with the data reported in the literature [49,50]. High temperature-activated calcined derivatives were samples 2–4. The characteristic peaks belonging to H2O disappeared; that is, the adsorbed water molecules in the system and the crystal water bounded to the Cu species disappeared, following the uncoordinated metal sites exposed. After 400 °C calcination (sample 2), the vibrational peaks of C = C and C-H bonds of benzene ring at 1557 cm−1 and 1113 cm−1 still existed, indicating the benzene ring structure remained and the skeleton collapse incomplete. When the calcination temperature continued to increase the C-O-Cu bond fracture, the Cu-BTC crystal's original skeleton and pore structure was destroyed. The structure of the new C-loaded metal Cu clusters was gradually formed, so the characteristic peak in the 1900–1300 cm−1 range gradually disappears. The existence of spectral peaks at 726 cm−1 proved the substituted Cu on the benzene ring retained in calcination. Raman spectroscopy complemented the valence-bond method of the prepared samples. Sample 1 reflected the Raman spectra of Cu-BTC prepared in this chapter. The low-frequency vibrational region of 170–600 cm−1 reflected the vibrational mode of Cu2+ species in the Cu2C4O8 cluster. The high-frequency vibrational region of 730–1800 cm−1 mainly composed of the organic part of MOF framework: the peaks at 742 cm−1 and 826 cm−1 belonged to the out of plane bending vibration peak and benzene ring vibration peak, respectively; the peaks at 1004 cm−1 and 1610 cm−1 belonged to the C = C stretching vibration of benzene ring; the energy bands at 1466 cm−1 and 1527 cm−1 belonged to the C = C stretching vibration peak, respectively; the two peaks at 1466 m−1 and 1527 m-1were attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric deformation vibration elements of –COO, respectively. Above all were consistent with the literature of Cu-BTC [51]. We also characterized the graphitization degree using Raman spectroscopy to understand the derivative catalysts' electron transport capacity. The D band (about 1350 cm−1) and G band (about 1580-1) [52] in Raman spectra were related to the relative motion of sp3 and sp2 hybrid carbon atoms [53,54]. The more sp2 hybrid carbon atoms were related to the higher graphitization degree of carbon-based materials. The D band's relative strength ratio to the G band (ID/IG) of the catalyst was displayed in Fig. 6 b. The catalysts calcined at 600 and 800 °C gained prominent D and G bands, and the higher the temperature was, the higher the ratio was. Therefore, the more amorphous the carbon contained in the catalysts was. This trend was consistent with the amorphous carbon layer characterized by TEM. However, the D and G bands formed by calcination at 400 °C were not typical due to the incomplete decomposition. The thermogravimetric results shown in Figure S3 recorded the temperature curves of precursor decomposition, which assigned that the precursor decomposed completely at about 400 °C. Compared with our experimental results, the deficient activity of the 400 °C calcined derivatives may be due to the incomplete formation of the carbon layer. The amorphous carbon layer formed under the experimental conditions provided a place for Cu to transfer electrons, forming a solid coupling effect between Cu and C species and improving the hydrogen production efficiency of the Cu-based catalyst. The performance of different coupling catalysts for MSR-SCR was conducted based on ω = 1.3 and space velocity of 22000 h−1, as shown in Fig. 6c. The candidate catalysts all possessed a particular deNOx performance in the 100–275 °C temperature range, of which Cu800/C-MnPdOy@Ni of the catalyst reached an excellent deNOx efficiency at 125 °C above 90%. Fig. 6d displayed the hydrogen production monitored in the MSR-SCR process, which can be inferred that the deNOx effect was positively correlated with the hydrogen production. Cu800/C-MnPdOy@Ni gained better hydrogen production ability at each temperature, producing more hydrogen available for deNOx, therefore obtaining the best coupling deNOx efficiency."
9,Conclusions,"The Cu polyatomic cluster catalyst with stable and uniform dispersing characteristics is the key to the inline production of hydrogen coupled deNOx technology. According to this study's results, Cu-based catalysts with uniformly distributed active sites can be prepared by calcining HKUST-1/Cu-MOF precursors in nitrogen for inline hydrogen production. In FESEM, the Cu polyatomic clusters were visualized. EDS mapping, XPS, XRD, and other characterization methods confirmed that the homogeneous particles dispersed after reduction were Cu polyatomic clusters. The results exhibited that the best catalyst Cu800/C-MnPdOy@Ni can achieve over 90% removal efficiency at 120 °C under the optimal conditions of ω = 1.3 + 22000 h−1 + 800ppmNO + N2balanced, and possessed good water-resistance. Furthermore, the production of H2 was monitored in the process, which proved the feasibility of its coupling reaction. This experiment's results provide a new approach for preparing catalysts with a uniform dispersion of active sites and safer H2-SCR.
