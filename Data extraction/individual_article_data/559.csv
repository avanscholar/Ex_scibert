0,Introduction,"The hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and esters derived from bio-based feedstocks is an important reaction used to obtain fatty alcohols and other bulk chemicals [1,2]. Fatty alcohols can serve as intermediates in the manufacture of a wide range of chemicals including flavours, fragrances, nutrients and pharmaceuticals [3,4]. The particular application is largely determined by the chain length; many commercially available detergents and surfactants comprise C12–14 fatty alcohols while longer chain fatty alcohols may find use as fuels and lubricants. Global fatty alcohol consumption reached 2.2 million tonnes in 2012 [5] and is forecast to continue growing year-on-year until 2020 with the highest production and consumption levels reported for Southeast Asia [6]. Beginning in the early-1930s with seminal studies by Adkins and co-workers [7,8], numerous works describing catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acid derivatives to their alcohols have appeared in the literature [9–13]. Adkins spearheaded the development of a range of Cu/Cr/Ba oxide-containing catalysts and their application in hydrogenation of lactic acid esters to 1,2-propanediol, α-amino and hydroxy esters to amino alcohols and glycols, methyl and n-butyl caproates to n-hexanol. Due to the intrinsic resistance of carboxylic acids and esters in particular towards reduction [14,15], current heterogeneously-catalysed processes are operated under extremely harsh conditions with temperatures in the range 200–300°C and 140–300bar H2 pressures [16]. The introduction of bimetallic catalysts allowed to carry out the reaction under much milder reaction conditions. For example, the use of bimetallic Au-Ag [17] and Au-Cu [18] catalysts allowed carrying out the hydrogenation of dialkyl oxalates with high selectivity to ethylene glycol at temperatures as low as 145°C. A bimetallic catalyst formulation of longstanding interest for hydrogenation of methyl esters is Ru-Sn. Narasimhan and co-workers [19,20] reported that methyl oleate could be selectively hydrogenated to oleyl alcohol over a NaBH4-reduced Ru-Sn-B/Al2O3 catalyst at 270°C and 44bar H2 pressure. The B and Sn components were proposed to enhance the electron density of Ru species and the dispersion of metallic Ru, respectively. Regarding the reaction mechanism, it was proposed that Ru sites promote the dissociation of H2 while adjacent Lewis acid (Sn2+/Sn4+) sites polarize the carbonyl group of methyl oleate. This is followed by hydride transfer from adjacent Ru-H sites to form a carbanion species that is rapidly hydrogenated to give alcohol. However, the contribution of different Ru/Ru-Sn phases, Sn species, support-effects and whether the reaction proceeds via an aldehyde or hemiacetal intermediate remains the source of much controversy. Further investigations [21–24] demonstrated that the relative concentrations of metallic and ionic Sn species can be controlled by the support material. The support itself may also participate in ester hydrogenation and, for an 8wt% Ru/ZrO2·xH2O catalyst applied in the hydrogenation of methyl propionate to 1-propanol [25], it was claimed that hydrogen bonding between surface hydroxyl groups of the support and the substrate can induce polarization of the carbonyl group of the ester and facilitate hydride insertion steps. Mendes et al. [26] described the importance of strong metal support interactions for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acid derivatives over Ru/TiO2. It was proposed that TiO2, in addition to stabilizing a high dispersion of active Ru particles, also directly participates in the catalytic reaction by polarizing the carbonyl group through surface Tin+ sites. The potential of other bimetallic catalysts including Rh-Re, Rh-Mo and Ru-Re for the hydrogenation of a range of carboxylic acids and their esters was investigated by Fuchikami and co-workers [27]. Much interest has been expressed in using Re in combination with other noble metals in aqueous phase reforming reactions, [28,29], hydrogenation of amides [30,31] and hydrogenation of C6–C18 fatty acids [32,33]. Pt-Re catalysts in particular are known to be highly active and selective catalysts in hydrogenation of amides to amines [34]. The activity of 2% Pt-10% Re/graphite catalysts towards hydrogenation of 108 substrates under moderate to mild conditions (c.a. 160°C, 5–70bar H2) was assessed by Stein and Breit [30]. For a series of cyclic amides including N-acetyl piperidine, 99% conversion with 100% selectivity to the corresponding tertiary amine could be achieved. The promoting effect of Re in Pd-catalysed hydrogenation of aqueous succinic acid to 1,4-butanediol was also considered by Especel and co-workers. [35]. Evaluating both impregnation and surface redox reduction preparation methods, addition of Re to 2wt% Pd/TiO2 gave rise to increased activity and selectivity of the catalytic reaction. Characterisation of catalysts prepared via surface redox reduction highlighted good dispersion of Pd and Re species, though few comments were made regarding the metal oxidation states. Previous characterisation studies [36,37] have discussed the difficulty in completely reducing Re to its metallic state given its high oxophilicity, making it likely that ReOx species co-exist with metallic Pd being present on TiO2. Depending on the preparation method, the amount of Re needed to induce synergy can vary from 0.6 to 0.8wt.% (surface redox) to 3.5wt.% Re (impregnation), confirming that the extent of Pd-Re interactions is influenced by the preparation method. Tomishige and co-workers [32] demonstrated the versatility of Pd-Re catalysts in hydrogenation of fatty acids including hexanoic, capric, palmitic and stearic acids. Using a ReOx-Pd/SiO2 (Re/Pd=8) catalyst, fatty alcohol yields in the range 92–99% were obtained at 140°C and 80bar H2. Hardacre and co-workers [33] were successful in hydrogenating stearic acid to stearyl alcohol using passivated 4wt% Pt-x wt% Re/TiO2 catalysts under unprecedentedly mild conditions of 120°C and 20bar H2. In-situ EXAFS measurements performed by the same group [38] indicated that more efficient reduction and stabilization of alloyed Pt-Re species takes place on TiO2. Finally, detailed mechanistic analysis by Dumesic and co-workers [39] has underpinned the importance of bifunctional acid sites derived from combination of a highly reducible metal with an oxophilic metal for selective CO hydrogenolysis reactions. We recently emphasized the importance of bifunctional/cooperative character for both heterogeneous and homogeneous ester hydrogenation catalysts [2]. Acid-base non-innocent ligands are known to provide the cooperative function in homogeneous transition metal catalysts and consequently activity can be improved through careful ligand design [40–43]. For heterogeneous ester hydrogenation catalysts, cooperative function can be derived from metal–metal and/or metal-support interactions. In this work, we aimed at investigating the promotional effect of Re on the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in the hydrogenation of model esters and carboxylic acids including methyl and ethyl hexanoate, methyl benzoate and hexanoic acid (Scheme 1 ). Catalysts were characterised by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction with the aim of understanding how addition of Re to Pt/TiO2 modifies catalyst structure and activity. Additionally, in-situ FTIR was used to study the origin of catalyst inhibition in the hydrogenation of methyl esters."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Catalysts precursors, reactants and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: perrhenic acid, HReO4 (75wt.%, aqueous), hexachloroplatinic acid, H2PtCl6·6H2O, methyl hexanoate (99.9%), ethyl hexanoate (99.9%), methyl benzoate (99.9%), hexanoic acid (99.9%) and hexane (99%) were used as received without additional purification. Catalyst supports were obtained from the following sources: α-Al2O3 (Condea), Carbon (RX-3, Norit), CeO2 (Sigma Aldrich), SiO2 (Grace), TiO2 (P-25, Degussa). Supported 3wt% Pt-x wt% Re (x =0–14.3) catalysts were synthesized by wet-impregnation with all quantities listed per gram of catalyst. HReO4 (10–128μL) was added to a solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (3.98mL, 1g in 25mL H2O). The appropriate amount of support (125–250μm) was then added to the solution while stirring at 80°C. The material was dried (110°C, 16h), ground using a pestle and mortar and reduced at 300°C in 10% H2/He (100mL/min) for 2h."
3,Catalyst characterisation and testing,"2.2 Catalyst characterisation and testing 2.2.1 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of adsorbed methanol FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded in the range of 4000–400cm−1 by a Bruker Vertex V70v instrument. The spectra were acquired at a 2cm−1 resolution and averaged over 32 scans. The samples were prepared as thin self-supporting wafers of 25–35mg/cm2 and placed inside a controlled environment infrared transmission cell, capable of heating and cooling, gas dosing, and evacuation. Prior to the measurements, all catalysts were reduced at 300°C by flowing 10vol.% H2 in N2 (total flow 100mL/min) for 2h. The cell was evacuated at room temperature and the sample was then pulse-dosed with either 12C or 13C-labelled methanol. The cell was subsequently heated to 180°C with a 2°C/min heating rate. The temperature was held for 2min at each temperature interview and a spectrum was recorded. All spectra presented were normalized to the weight of the pellet sample. 2.2.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Transmission electron micrographs were acquired on a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200kV with a LaB6 filament. Typically, an amount of the sample was ground and suspended in pure ethanol, sonicated and dispersed over a Cu grid with a holey carbon film. Samples were first reduced in 10vol.% H2 in He (total flow 100mLmin−1) at 300°C for 2h, followed by passivation in 1vol.% O2 in He for 2h. 2.2.3 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) H2-TPR experiments were performed in a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 equipped with a fixed-bed reactor, a computer-controlled oven, and a thermal conductivity detector. Typically, 50mg catalyst was loaded in a tubular quartz reactor. The sample was reduced in 4vol.% H2 in N2 at a flow rate of 10mL/min, while heating from room temperature up to 700°C at a ramp rate of 2°C/min. The H2 signal was calibrated using a CuO/SiO2 reference catalyst. 2.2.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS measurements were carried out with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, equipped with a monochromatic small-spot X-ray source and a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyzer with a 128-channel detector. Spectra were obtained using an aluminium anode (AlKα=1486.6eV) operating at 72W and a spot size of 400μm. Survey scans were measured at a constant pass energy of 200eV and region scans at 50eV. The background pressure was 2×10−9 mbar and during measurement 3×10−7 mbar Argon because of the charge compensation by the dual-beam low energy electron/Argon ion source. Data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software. The binding energy was corrected for surface charging by taking the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon as a reference at 284.6eV. 2.2.5 Catalyst activity measurements All hydrogenation experiments were prepared inside a large, two-hand glove bag (AtmosBag with zipper lock, Sigma Aldrich). The glove bag was purged five times with nitrogen after which a constant flow rate was applied to give a suitable working over-pressure. A pre-reduced catalyst (3–18mg) was then loaded into a small stainless steel autoclave followed by the addition of solvent (3.5mL), substrate (0.44mmol) and internal standard (dodecane, 35.2μL) after which the autoclave was sealed and removed from the glove bag. The autoclave was subsequently purged five times with hydrogen (2MPa) before filling the vessel to the desired pressure (5MPa). Using a hot plate equipped with magnetic stirring capability, the autoclave was gradually heated to 180°C (unless otherwise stated) before stirring at 1000rpm was commenced (1–8h). On completion of the reaction, both heating and stirring were stopped, the autoclave was removed from the hot plate and then cooled in ice-cold water. Once cooled, the contents of the autoclave were filtered using an organic-based polymer frit and a sample was prepared for GC-FID analysis (Shimadzu GC-FID equipped with RX-5 carbowax column). Calibration was performed using known concentrations of all reactants and products in order to determine correct response factors."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation Fig. 1 shows representative TEM images of TiO2-supported Pt and Re catalysts. The average sizes for nanoparticles in 3wt% Pt and Re/TiO2 samples are 1.3 and 1.1nm, respectively. Both catalysts exhibit a relatively narrow particle size distribution (±0.4nm). The population of sub-nanometre particles is greatest for Re/TiO2 (>50%), which is typical when strong metal support interactions exist [44]. The effect of Re addition to Pt/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2 ; both an extended particle size distribution and increased average particle size were observed for all bimetallic Pt-Re samples compared to their monometallic counterparts. On increasing addition of Re to Pt, there is a notable decrease in average particle size. At the same time, there is a broader distribution and particles up to 3nm in size could be observed in all three samples. Consequently, Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 comprises the largest population of sub-nanometre particles (35%) among all Pt-based catalysts studied here. A similar effect was previously reported [44] for a series ZrO2-supported Pt and Pt-Re catalysts. This effect was proposed to contribute to superior activity of the bimetallic catalysts in aqueous phase glycerol reforming. Fig. 3 summarizes the results of the H2-TPR characterisation of the catalysts. For all samples, reduction was observed at relatively low temperatures. Reduction features range from sharp peaks centred around 100°C to broad features with shoulders up to 250°C. The low temperature reduction of Re alone on TiO2 is a somewhat surprising result given that reduction of Re in the Re/C counterparts [29] only started at around 300°C and reached completion only close to 500°C. This points to the support-assisted reduction of Re by TiO2. The consumption of H2 upon the TPR experiment expressed as H2 to metal ratios exceeds the theoretical values for all materials investigated, thereby providing an indication of (i) H2-spillover effects in reduction of Re/Pt-Re species on TiO2, and (ii) reduction of the support surface. The presence of broad shoulders starting at approximately 150 and 230°C in TPR profiles for Pt-Re (1:5) and Re/TiO2 samples, respectively, suggests the presence of some residual isolated ReOx species attached to the TiO2 surface of the Re-rich catalysts [28]. We further employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyse the chemical composition and the nature of species on the surface of TiO2-supported catalysts. Quantified XPS data summarized in Table 1 clearly shows that Re-addition to Pt/TiO2 leads to a surface Re enrichment. Even the most Re-poor catalyst with the bulk Pt:Re ratio of 5:1 shows a more than 3-fold excess of surface Re, while the active component on the surface of Pt-Re (1:5)/TiO2 catalyst is almost entirely Re. The percentage of surface exposed Pt is also consistently low and decreases by approximately 50% with increasing Re content. On addition of Re to Pt/TiO2, a slight shift of the Pt features to higher binding energies (71.0 to 71.7eV) is observed in all samples suggesting that Pt and Re are in good contact (Supporting information, Fig. S1). The binding energy of the Re 4f7/2 peaks in XPS spectra of the Re 4f region for bimetallic samples decreases from 41.8 to 40.0eV with increasing Re content. Furthermore, a higher binding energy of 42.4eV is observed for Re/TiO2 which suggests that the Pt component in Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts promotes the reduction of ReOx oxide species on the surface."
6,Catalytic activity measurements,"3.2 Catalytic activity measurements Optimization of the reaction conditions in hydrogenation of methyl benzoate and methyl hexanoate substrates was first undertaken (Supporting information, Table S1). The hydrogenation of esters to alcohols over supported Pt-Re catalysts was determined to be a highly-activated process. As a result, the catalytic results discussed below (unless otherwise stated) were obtained after 8h reaction time at 180°C and under 50bar H2 pressure. Solvent screening identified hexane as the optimal reaction solvent. Analysis of the influence of the support on the activity of Pt and Pt-Re (1:2) catalysts evidences the promoting role of the metal oxide supports and Re doping on the conversion of methyl hexanoate to 1-hexanol and methanol (Fig. 4 ). In addition to 1-hexanol and methanol (and potentially in turn CO), other possible reaction products include (i) n-hexane, formed via hydrogenolysis of 1-hexanol, (ii) methane, pentane and CO2, formed through the decarboxylation of methyl hexanoate, (iii) hexyl-hexanoate, formed by transesterification of methyl hexanoate with 1-hexanol produced in-situ. Selectivity to 1-hexanol is also influenced by the support material with highest values over 90% obtained for Pt-Re (1:2)/CeO2, TiO2 and CeZrO2 catalysts. Alcohol selectivity in the case of their carbon and alumina-supported counterparts was only around 70% (Supplementary information, Table S2). Based on these initial results, further optimization was undertaken for TiO2-supported Pt-Re catalysts. The results in Fig. 5 evidence the emergence of a synergy between catalyst components upon the addition of Re to Pt. The activity increases up to a Pt:Re ratio of 1:2 resulting in alcohol yield improvement of approximately 3-fold for both methyl- (4–11%) and ethyl (8–23%) hexanoate. Activity declines by around 50% on moving to Pt-Re (1:5)/TiO2 and we believe that this is due to the substantial decrease in surface Pt to Re ratio (Table 1), leading to a partial loss of synergy. Crucially, Re/TiO2 is inactive towards ester hydrogenation adding support to the notion that Re plays a secondary role in Pt-Re catalysts. The contribution of TiO2 in the reaction mechanism is also likely in view of the fact that Pt/TiO2 exhibits some activity in ester hydrogenation [26,45]. Pt and Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts were found to be 1.6–3 times more active in hydrogenation of ethyl hexanoate compared to methyl hexanoate. A maximum conversion of 23% was achieved over Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2. Changing the substrate however did not dramatically affect product distribution showing a high selectivity of over 90% to 1-hexanol with minor products constituting alkanes (Table 2 ). For our most active Pt-Re catalyst, selectivity to 1-hexanol reached 98%. The lack of a clear relationship between selectivity and Re content was previously acknowledged by Hardacre and co-workers [33] in hydrogenation of stearic acid, also over Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts. Our results suggest that increasing the amount of Re in Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts leads to an increase in the number of available sites capable of polarizing the carbonyl group of alkyl esters as opposed to modifying the extent and/or mechanism of hydrogenation. This is partly supported by the XPS data presented in Table 1, which shows a pronounced increase in surface Re content for higher Re loadings (3.6–14.3wt%). The increase of catalyst loading (Fig. 6 ) has only a minimal effect on methyl hexanoate conversion. In the case of Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2, the 6-fold increase of the catalyst content leads to double conversion of the ester, while in the case of the monometallic Pt/TiO2 catalyst this conversion increased only by 50%. We conclude that this effect cannot be attributed to mass-transfer limitations given the fact that when methyl benzoate was used as a substrate, the conversion was complete with these catalysts already after 3h (see Fig. 6, blue triangle). The conversion of the aromatic ester methyl benzoate, however, exhibited poor chemoselectivity, as aromatic ring hydrogenation was facile. The major reaction products were methyl cyclohexanoate, cyclohexanol and methanol. A factor that cannot be eliminated at this stage is the possibility of catalyst deactivation by the reaction products. This hypothesis is supported by comparison of the performance of Pt, Re and Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts in hydrogenation of methyl and ethyl hexanoate. It is also concluded from Fig. 5 that simply changing the alkoxy moiety in the ester from methyl to ethyl dramatically improves the rate of ester hydrogenation over all Pt-based catalysts. Therefore, to check the possibility of catalyst deactivation by the reaction by-product, two additional experiments were performed in which one mole equivalent of methanol was added to the reaction medium (Fig. 7 ). Activity is significantly hindered in the presence of excess methanol and points towards deactivation due to in-situ formed methanol. In response to the above findings, a series of time online measurements were performed using our most active catalyst, Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 (Fig. 8 ). In addition to methyl hexanoate, the hydrogenation of hexanoic acid was performed to directly assess the effect of short chain alcohol formation on catalyst performance. It is now possible to fully convert hexanoic acid under the same reaction conditions with 75% conversion after 2h reaction (compared to just 6% methyl hexanoate conversion). In conjunction with results shown in Fig. 7, this categorically proves that ester hydrogenation is hindered in the presence of short chain alcohols, in particular, methanol. Next the influence of catalyst mass on activity is compared for hexanoic acid and methyl hexanoate substrates in Fig. 9 . For the hydrogenation of hexanoic acid (in which no short chain alcohol is produced), a first order behaviour with respect to catalyst mass is observed. The conversion rises uniformly with increasing catalyst mass. It is plausible that increasing the mass of Pt or Pt-Re (x:y)/TiO2 used in methyl ester hydrogenation improves the initial rate of 1-hexanol and methanol production. As a result, a higher concentration of methanol may be in contact with the catalyst at shorter reaction times which could lead to faster deactivation in-situ and help explain the limited response in Fig. 6. We further employed in situ FTIR spectroscopy to understand the deactivating role of methanol for Pt-Re (x:y)/TiO2 catalysts during ester hydrogenation. The interaction of methanol with 3wt% Re, Pt and Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 catalysts was investigated. For Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2, multiple features were detected with increasing temperature (Fig. 10 ). The gradual formation of a broad band centred at 2073cm−1 was attributed to CO [46], formed via decarbonylation of methanol. This interaction was reported by Rochester [47] and Igarashi [48] groups to be that of Pt-CO and we consider this species to be primarily responsible for the catalyst deactivation in our study. Formation of another band at 2360cm−1 in addition to multiple features in the region 1800–1350cm−1 were also observed and attributed to carbon dioxide, formic acid, formaldehyde, water and formate species, respectively [49,50]. Additional experiments (Supplementary information, Figs. S2 and S3) support the above assignments [51]. For 3wt% Re/TiO2, we did not observe any major features in recorded spectra and, given this catalyst is inactive in ester hydrogenation, we infer that catalyst deactivation is related to the poisoning of Pt. However, factors including the size, shape, co-ordination number and dispersion of Pt species can be modified by Re-addition. Lastly, for Pt/TiO2, formation of a broad band centred at 2046cm−1 was observed (Fig. 11 (a)). While we also attribute this band to CO, it is situated 27cm−1 lower than its Pt-Re (1:2) counterpart, which is presumably due to the band positions being sensitive to factors including alloying and Pt dispersion [52]. Referring back to TEM images in Fig. 1, there is indeed a lower population of sub-nanometre particles in Pt/TiO2. What is very interesting here is that only CO, formaldehyde and formate species are formed, highlighting that decarboxylation and other complex reactions may only proceed over bimetallic Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts; Re-addition can thus modify the behaviour of Pt. To conclude, comparison of normalized spectra presented in Fig. 11 suggests CO binding is strongest for Pt/TiO2 (a) and also more facile at lower temperatures compared to Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 (b)."
7,Discussion,"It is well-known that supported Pt-Re catalysts are effective in the hydrogenation of a range of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids [32] and amides [30,31] and, in this study, we showed that Pt and Pt-Re systems can also be used to hydrogenate methyl and ethyl esters to their corresponding alcohols under mild conditions (180°C, 50bar H2). Evaluation of different support materials in hydrogenation of methyl hexanoate revealed reducible supports, in particular TiO2, to favour both higher ester conversion and selectivity to 1-hexanol compared to inert supports such as carbon and silica. A key aspect of our investigation was to better understand the effect of Re-addition to Pt/TiO2. First, we found Re/TiO2 to be inactive in hydrogenation of methyl hexanoate. It was next determined that on increasing the amount of Re in Pt-Re/TiO2 up until a Pt to Re molar ratio of 1:2, methyl hexanoate conversion could be improved by a factor of approximately 3. Further increasing the amount of Re decreased conversion. All Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts exhibited high selectivity towards 1-hexanol, implying the effect of Re-addition is therefore to enhance the rate of reaction by providing sites at which activation via interaction with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of the ester can be facilitated. Characterisation of the catalysts by TEM reported the average particle sizes of bimetallic Pt-Re catalysts as being slightly larger (1.3–1.5nm) than their monometallic (1.1–1.3nm) counterparts. Simultaneously, the population of sub-nanometre particles was observed to increase by as much as 50% moving from Pt to Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2. Most interestingly, the largest population of sub-nanometre particles was detected for Re/TiO2 and therefore it is very likely, based on this information, that alloying between Pt and Re metals has occurred. Referring to the XPS spectra of the Pt (4f7/2) and Re (4f7/2) regions, good contact between Pt and Re was suggested by a slight shift of the Pt features to higher binding energies (71.0 to 71.7eV) with increasing Re content. Alongside this, the Re 4f7/2 peaks became progressively more metallic in nature (41.8 to 40.0eV) with almost 20 times as much surface-exposed Re detected on Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 compared to Pt/TiO2. Finally, bulk characterisation of Pt, Re and Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts by TPR indicated that it is also easier to reduce Re in the presence of Pt and on TiO2 due to H2-spillover effects. Taking these factors into account, we propose that catalytic activity in hydrogenation of esters is associated with alloyed and largely metallic sub-nanometre Pt-Re particles comprising a high Re/Pt surface ratio. Changing the alkoxy group of the ester substrate can have a significant effect on catalytic activity. On substituting methyl for ethyl hexanoate, conversion over Pt and all Pt-Re/TiO2 catalysts was significantly improved (reaching a maximum at Pt:Re=1:2) and with high selectivity to 1-hexanol maintained. However, the maximum conversion of ethyl hexanoate is still only 23% (11% for methyl hexanoate) and, in addition, methyl and ethyl hexanoate conversion did not show uniform response with respect to catalyst mass and time online parameters, respectively, suggesting that transport limitations and/or catalyst deactivation may be present in the system. We eliminated the former possibility given that supporting experiments in which methyl benzoate was hydrogenated over Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 under the same mild conditions allowed for complete conversion (due to non-selective hydrogenation of the aromatic ring) and therefore mass-transfer limitations cannot be responsible for the hindered performance described above. More support comes from hexanoic acid hydrogenation experiments in which it was possible to achieve full conversion and first order behaviour with respect to catalyst mass. As water is produced in carboxylic acid hydrogenation as opposed to methanol/ethanol when hydrogenating methyl/esters, it came to the attention that a functional group effect may explain why there is limited ester conversion. This hypothesis is confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. On approaching a reaction temperature of 180°C, methanol undergoes decarbonylation, dehydrogenation and, depending on the type of catalyst, decarboxylation in-situ to yield carbon monoxide, formic acid, formaldehyde, water, formate species and carbon dioxide, respectively. It is decarbonylation of methanol to CO that is responsible for catalyst deactivation by the poisoning of active Pt sites. The formation of surface carbonyl has been confirmed by the appearance of new IR bands upon methanol adsorption attributed to Pt-CO observed at 2046cm−1 for Pt/TiO2 and 2073cm−1 for Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 catalysts. With reference to the literature [52], we propose that the difference of 27cm−1 could be due to the CO band position being sensitive to factors including alloying and Pt dispersion. Such deactivation phenomena was previously disclosed in 2006 by Merck & Co [53]. for several classes of hydrogenation reactions performed in short chain alcohol solvents and over Raney-Ni and supported Pd catalysts. Critically, none of the aforementioned species were observed on Re/TiO2 which indicates that methanol interacts and undergoes reaction specifically over Pt sites; however, the presence of Re can indeed modify Pt behaviour. Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 can facilitate decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reactions whereas decarbonylation is the only significant process over Pt/TiO2. Decarbonylation is however more facile over Pt/TiO2 with CO formed even upon the room temperature adsorption of methanol and normalization of spectra recorded for Pt and Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 pellets shows decarbonylation having taken place to greater extent over the former catalyst."
8,Conclusions,"Supported Pt, Re and Pt-Re catalysts prepared via impregnation were evaluated in hydrogenation of hexanoic acid, methyl benzoate and methyl/ethyl hexanoate substrates under mild conditions. Characterisation of catalysts by TEM, TPR and XPS provided evidence of synergy between Pt and Re in terms of decreasing particle size and particle size distribution, contribution of H2-spillover effects during reduction and concentration of surface Pt/Re species, respectively. Full conversion of hexanoic acid over supported Pt-Re catalysts and a first order dependence on catalyst mass were observed. In ester hydrogenation, optimal activity is achieved over Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 in the hydrogenation of methyl/ethyl hexanoate to 1-hexanol and methanol/ethanol. On substituting methyl hexanoate for ethyl hexanoate, activity could be improved by as much as a factor of 3 depending on the Pt to Re ratio in the catalyst. Additional experiments in which either the catalyst mass or reaction time were varied indicated that catalyst deactivation was responsible for this difference in activity. Direct addition of methanol to the reaction medium was found to be highly detrimental to activity suggesting that the diminished catalytic performance observed upon the hydrogenation of methyl esters is due to the inhibiting role of the methanol by-product formed in the course of the reaction. In situ FTIR spectroscopy measurements of Pt, Re and Pt-Re (1:2)/TiO2 catalysts supported both the decarbonylation of methanol and resulting CO poisoning of Pt surface sites, thereby explaining the observed catalyst deactivation in situ. While catalysts were subject to deactivation related to Pt-CO interactions, the beneficial effects of Re and TiO2 as a support were recognised and could form the basis of future studies aimed at developing alternative Re-containing catalysts with improved tolerance for methyl ester hydrogenation."
