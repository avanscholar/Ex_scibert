0,Introduction,"Carbamates are valuable chemicals widely used in the manufacture of polyurethanes, which are widely used for producing surface coatings, synthetic fibers, and adhesives [1,2]. To date, the synthesis routes from various C1 resource to carbamates includes application of the phosgene (COCl2) and organic halides [3–6], transesterification of organic carbonates [7–9], and carboxylation of amines and CO2 [6,10–12] (Scheme 1 ). Among these C1 synthons, organic halides can hardly react with aromatic amines, as have been stated previously [3–6]. The transesterification of organic carbonate with amines appears to be sustainable. However, organic carbonates are produced from CO2 with alcohol [13] or epoxide [14,15], which increases the reaction steps and the cost of reaction. Therefore, these circumstances encourage the exploring of novel and effective routes, which directly synthesize carbamate using CO2 as the carbon source [16–18]. As a nontoxic, abundant, and low-cost C1 chemical feedstock, the utilization of CO2 is one of the most attractive processes for the synthesis of carbamates [19–29]. In this context, the direct synthesis of carbamates from amines, alcohol, and CO2 is considered to be a sustainable route. However, this reaction is restricted by two factors. One is the thermodynamic limitation, leading to the difficulty of dehydration [30]. Another is that the nitrogen atoms of amino groups in aromatic amines have lower electron cloud density, leading to the low conversion of aromatic amines [31,32]. To overcome the thermodynamic limitation and low reactivity of anilines, the catalytic reactions are preferentially performed at high CO2 pressure (e.g.5–30 MPa of CO2) and higher temperature (＞393 K), resulting in high yields (71–99%) [12,19,21,25,28,33]. Furthermore, dehydrating agents play an important role in this reaction, which can remove the coproduction of H2O from the reaction to enhance the yield of carbamates. Tomishige and co-workers achieve high-yield synthesis (up to >99%) of methyl N-phenylcarbamate (MPC) by using CeO2 as catalyst and 2-cyanopyridine as a dehydrating agent at 403 K [34]. The development of a highly effective catalyst and dehydrant is key to achieve high effective synthesis of carbamates at mild condition. Ionic liquids (ILs) are thought as a good medium for CO2 capture and conversion due to their unique features such as high thermal and chemical stability, negligible vapor pressure [35–40]. CO2 can be absorbed by ILs to produce liquid carbonate, carbamate, or phenolate salts under mild conditions. In this work, we described a simple catalytic synthesis of carbamates directly from amines, alcohol, and CO2 under mild conditions, using DBU as base, alcohol as a proton donor and substrate, and CH2Br2 as solvent and dehydrant."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were used without additional purification. CO2 (99.99 mol%) was supplied by Nanjing Messer Gas Co., Ltd. DBU, 1,5,7-Triazabicyclo[4,4,0]dec-5-ene (TBD), 1,5-Diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN), Pyridine, o-anisidine, m-anisidine, p-anisidine, 4-fluoroaniline, 4-bromoaniline, p-toluidine, and dibromomethane (CH2Br2) were purchased from Energy Chemical. Aniline (ArNH2), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and CH3OH were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. NaOH and ethyl acetate were purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd."
3,Characterization,2.2 Characterization The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO‑d 6 on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer and chemical shifts were recorded relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS). The ESI-MS was collected on a Shimadazu LCMS 2020 instrument. The reaction solution was analyzed by using a GC5890C gas chromatograph fitted with a Wonda CAP 5 column (30 m*0.32 mm*0.25 µm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The FTIR spectra was collected on a Nicolet NEXUS870 spectrometer. The structure of the product was further identified by using GC–MS.
4,Synthesis of DBU-based protic ionic liquid,"2.3 Synthesis of DBU-based protic ionic liquid [DBUH][CH3O] was prepared by a one-step route. The DBU and CH3OH were simply mixed at the molar ratio of 1:1 in an N2 atmosphere. Then, the mixture was stirred at 303.2 K for 12 h to offer final products and the characterization results were listed in Supporting Information (Figs. S1 and S2)."
5,Synthesis of MPC,"2.4 Synthesis of MPC In a typical experiment to synthesize MPC, ArNH2 (2 mmol), CH3OH (2 mmol), CH2Br2 (2.5 mL), and DBU (2 mmol) were added to a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor. The reactor was purged with dry CO2 three times to remove the air and filled with CO2 to 1 MPa for 7 h at 333.2 K. After the reaction, CO2 was released slowly. A small amount of the mixture was filtered for GC and GC–MS analysis."
6,The recovery of catalyst,"2.5 The recovery of catalyst After the reaction, water (3*10 mL) was used to extract [DBUH]. By using the rotary evaporator under high vacuum, water in the filtrate was removed. Then, the mixture was added to NaOH aqueous solution (6 mol/L) and stirred for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, DBU was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum for 48 h at 333.2 K before it was used for next cycle."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.1 Optimization of reaction conditions Initial research was designed to select ArNH2 as a substrate. The model conditions were set as a 7-hour reaction in CH2Br2 at 333.2 K, resulting in the formation of MPC. MPC was detected by the GC–MS and NMR analysis (Figs. S3-S5). Without DBU or CH3OH, no product was obtained (Table 1 , entries 1, 2). It was demonstrated that DBU and CH3OH were essential for the reaction. The results showed that the addition of DBU increased the conversion of ArNH2 to 74.1% (Table 1, entry 3). In general, the conversion of ArNH2 increased with the increasing concentration of DBU (Table1, entries 3, 4). Up to 96.9 % conversion of ArNH2 could be achieved. The excess addition of DBU (Table1, entry 5) did not promote the conversion because the base promoted the alcoholysis of MPC [41]. When a higher amount of CH3OH (Table 1, entries 6 and 7) was used, the conversion of ArNH2 decreased to 87.5% due to the cleavage of MPC into aniline through alcoholysis. When one equivalent of H2O was added, the conversion of ArNH2 decreased to 83.2% (Entries 4 and 8). It suggested that H2O inhibited the conversion of ArNH2. For comparison, three other strong bases were examined for synthesizing MPC. However, they showed lower activities (Table1, entries 9–11). The difference of the molecule structures may influence their reactivities. To sum up, entry 4 in Table 1 represented the best reaction conditions for further research. In order to further display the advantage of the catalyst and dehydrant, the catalytic performances were compared with other reported catalysts (Table 2 ). Fig. S6 showed the conversion of ArNH2 as a function of time. With increasing reaction time, the conversion of ArNH2 gradually enhanced. This tendency suggested that the process of dehydrative condensation was slow. Stoichiometric experiments revealed that this reaction process had two possible pathways (Fig. S7). The conversions of ArNH2 were 51.8, and 68.5%, respectively, which suggested that the reaction involving the ionic liquid of [DBUH][CH3O] was predominant. Based on the optimized conditions (DBU 4 mmol, CH3OH 2 mmol, CH2Br2 2.5 mL, pCO2 1 MPa), various substituted anilines and alcohol were adopted to synthesize carbamates (Table 3 ). Most of the anilines with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups in the phenyl ring were well tolerated (entries 2–7). The isolated product yields varied from 59.8 to 82.5%. Interestingly, substrates with electron-donating groups promoted the formation of carbamates (entries 2–5), whereas the yields of substrates with electron-withdrawing groups were lower (entries 6, 7). Using ethanol, the yields of the corresponding carbamate reached up to 85.2%. The above results indicated that the groups in the phenyl ring have little impact on the reaction. IL was highly efficient for producing various carbamate."
9,Reusability of absorbent and catalyst,"3.2 Reusability of absorbent and catalyst The synthesis of MPC from ArNH2, CO2, and CH3OH was a viable path. Reusability and recyclability of catalyst played an important role for the synthesizing of MPC. Using a similar procedure [46], the recycling of catalyst in the synthesis of MPC was also investigated. After the reaction, DBU was recovered by neutralization with NaOH aqueous solution and extraction with ethyl acetate. As shown in Fig. S8, the structure and purity of the recycled DBU was confirmed by the 13C NMR analysis. It was nearly the same as the new one. As described in Fig. 1 , it can be observed that the conversion of ArNH2 was almost unchanged after 6 cycles, and thereby it enhances the possibility of its application in industrial processes."
10,Reaction mechanism,"3.3 Reaction mechanism It was also interesting to have insight into the activation mechanism of [DBUH][CH3O]. The 13C NMR and FTIR spectra were employed to investigate the possible intermediate in the reaction process. After reacting with CO2, the 13C NMR spectrum of [DBUH][CH3O] exhibited a new peak at 156.92 ppm that was attributed to the carbonyl carbon of methylcarbonate anion [CH3OCO2]− (Fig. S9). This signal was in accordance with that of [NBu4][CH3OCO2] at 158.2 ppm [47] and [PMePh3][O2COH] at 160.3 ppm [48]. At the same time, the intensity of unreacted [CH3O]− at 48.54 ppm decreased while a new carbon signal at 51.29 ppm could be found after the absorption of CO2, indicating that the part of [CH3O]– reacting with activated CO2 to produce carbonate carbon. In the FTIR spectra (Fig. S10), after the CO2 absorption, a new band appeared at 1648 cm−1 which corresponded to C═O stretching band. This observation was consistent with the 13C NMR peak. In the MS spectrum (Fig. S11), the peak of [CH3OCO2]– can be found, supporting the results of the NMR and FTIR analysis. The mixture of [DBUH][CH3O] and 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene was examined by the 1H and 13C NMR analysis. Fig. S12 showed that the 1H NMR signal of NH2 of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene in this mixture shifted from 4.58 to 4.59 ppm, indicating that [DBUH][CH3O] could form hydrogen bond with NH2 of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S13, the C atom of this mixture had shifted. Specifically, the 13C NMR signals of the C atom of [CH3O]– shifted to 48.33 ppm, thus indicating the hydrogen bond existed in this mixture. This result agreed with the 1H NMR analysis. Thus, the NH2 group of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene could nucleophilically attack the C atom of the [CH3OCO2]–. To better understand the mechanism for the catalytic synthesis of carbamates, the mixture of [DBUH][CH3OCO2] and 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene had been investigated by the NMR analysis. Fig. 2 showed that the 13C NMR spectrum of [DBUH][CH3OCO2]/4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene emerged with five new signals. Among these signals, a new signal appeared at 152.10 ppm, which was ascribed to the carbonyl carbon atom of the carbamate (C═O) stretch and was consistent with the observation of previously results [49–51]. Meanwhile, the chemical shifts of other new signals had changed after CO2 absorption, which suggested the existence of benzol of carbamate acid. It indicated that the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene attacked the carbon atom of [CH3OCO2]– to form the intermediate [NHCO2]–. In addition, an NH bond in 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene was activated by DBU and followed by CO2 insertion, owning to hydrogen bond [52], resulting in the formation of [NHCO2]– (Fig. S14). Zhang et al. previously claimed that isocyanate was an important intermediate in the synthesis of MPC from aniline, CO2, and CH3OH [23]. We further utilized 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene as substrate and applied several control experiments to get better insight into the reaction pathway (Scheme 2 ). First, DBU was neutralized with CH3OH to form [DBUH][CH3O] (Scheme 2A, Figs. S1 and S2). Then, [DBUH][CH3O] can react with CO2 to form the intermediate of [DBUH][CH3OCO2] 3 (Scheme 2B). After adding 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene 4, the NH2 group of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene could nucleophilically attack the C atom of the [CH3OCO2]− to produce the intermediate 5 (Scheme 2C). As indicated by the results shown in Fig. 2, the [NHCO2]− of intermediate 5 was crucial for producing carbamate. Moreover, the mixture of DBU and 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene 4 can also react with CO2 to produce the intermediate 5 (Scheme 2D, Fig. S15). In the following step, the intermediate 5 reacted with CH2Br2 to form 4-methoxyphenyl isocyanate 6 which was determined by GC–MS and NMR analysis (Scheme 2E, Figs. S16, S17 and S39). Isocyanate had been reported as an important intermediate in the synthesis of carbamates [24,53]. The result indicated that CH2Br2 reacted with [NHCO2]−, resulting in the elimination of bromomethanol at 333.2 K [54]. Notably, bromomethanol was unstable and decomposed to hydrogen bromide and formaldehyde [55]. The methyl N-(4-methoxyphenyl) 7 can be synthesized from 4-methoxyphenyl isocyanate 6 and CH3OH in 86.3% (Scheme 2F). On the basis of the above results, Scheme 3 shows two plausible reaction mechanisms. One pathway shows that the proton in CH3OH was activated by superbase DBU to form IL 2. Then, CO2 was activated by [DBUH][CH3O] 2 to generate the intermediate 3. After that, the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene attacked the carbon atom of the intermediate 3 to form the intermediate 5 [56]. At the same time, the mixture of DBU and 4-methoxy-1-aminobenzene 4 could react with CO2 to form intermediate 5 in another pathway. In the following step, CH2Br2 attacked of [NHCO2]− to form higher reactive intermediate 5b [54,57]. Then, 5b decomposed to isocyanate 6. Next, esterification between isocyanate 6 and CH3OH resulted in the formation of the methyl N-(4-methoxyphenyl) 7."
11,Conclusions,"In this work, we reported an efficient and sustainable synthesis route to produce carbamates under mild conditions. Two possible pathways have been proposed for the synthesis of carbamates from amines, CO2 and alcohol. One pathway reveals that ILs catalysts, [DBUH][RO], being produced by neutralization of DBU and ROH, were found to activate CO2 to produce liquid carbonate. The nucleophilic nitrogen atom of amines attacked the carbon atom of liquid carbonate to form the [NHCO2]−. Simultaneously, the reaction pathway of DBU and amines reacted with CO2 to form intermediate of switch ILs. Then, CH2Br2 acted as a dehydrating agent due to its efficiency in forming an effective leaving group. [NHCO2]– was easily dehydrated to form isocyanate in CH2Br2 at 333.2 K and then reacted with alcohol to produce carbamate. Up to 96.9% conversion of amines could be achieved in 7 h at 333.2 K. This result was comparable or better to those obtained with other catalysts that operate under more forcing conditions [58]. In addition, the DBU could be easily recovered and remained good reactivity. This protocol to synthesize carbamates from absorption and conversion of CO2 provides a kind of highly promising, green and stable system for industry."
