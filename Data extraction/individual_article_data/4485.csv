0,Introduction,"Economic development around the globe have recently demanded the need for alternative resources of energy mainly, due to the harmful effects of using fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas etc.), such as greenhouse effect, global warming etc. Excessive consumption of fossil fuels, most common in urban areas, has increased pollution during the last few decades. This has also resulted in the high emission levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere [1], global warming and an increase in price and unexpected environmental fluctuations [2]. All these weakness of fossil fuels along with its fast depletion have strengthened the idea of alternative, renewable, sustainable and cheap energy sources such as biofuels i.e. bio-hydrogen, bio-methane, bioethanol, bio-methanol, bio-butanol etc. Robust increase in human population is accompanied with the generation of large amounts of different types of wastes and an urgent need to solve the problem of waste disposal has emerged. Investment of energy for waste disposal is not economical but utilisation of waste for energy production is promising. There is renewed interest in the production and use of plant origin fuels or organic (biodegradable) wastes for sustainable energy development. It also helps in development of economy and society in an eco-friendly manner. Biomass resources are the only renewable and suitable primary energy resource that can provide various alternative transportation fuels in the short-term [3]."
1,Where do we stand at present time?,"1.1 Where do we stand at present time? We are living in the age of technology and development in technology also leads to the development of various resources and methods used for pretreatment and production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Pretreatment technologies have developed simultaneously with the development of methods used for biofuel production [3]. A number of modifications were also applied in engines of automobiles, to utilise biofuels like bioethanol and biodiesel as they could blend with petrol and improves its efficiency. Biohydrogen can also be used for running vehicles, but there are many problems related to storage and transportation of biohydrogen. Various pretreatment methods have been used for the pretreatment of different kinds of biomass but most of chemical pretreatment methods utilised excessive amount of expensive chemicals. Physical pretreatment require high amount of energy which affects its feasibility and cost effectiveness. Many new technologies developed today are still limited to the lab scale production of biofuel and there is a need to develop such techniques which are feasible, cost effective and can be commercialised easily. The motivation of this review was achieved from the literature surveyed for the preparation of Ph.D. synopsis and it was found that a number of pretreatment methods have been used by several researchers and most of them resulted in contamination of environment due to large amount of chemicals used in the pretreatment process. This review critically describes various lignocellulosic biomasses used in recent years, composition of biomass, production of biofuels from different biomasses, comparison of various pretreatment processes used for biomass pretreatment and their effects on biofuel yields."
2,Biofuels and importance of biofuels,"Biofuels are defined here as organic fuels derived from agricultural biomass through contemporary biological processes and can be used for the generation of thermal energy by combustion or by use of other technology [4]. According to Anselm Eisentraut, International Energy Agency (IEA) [5] biofuels currently provide approximately 1.5% of global transport fuel, as a result of rapidly increasing production over the last decade. Recently, to reduce GHGs and for waste disposal, biofuel production has been preferred since biofuels are light, less carbon containing, high energy producing, cheap and low pollution causing agents."
3,Biomass to biofuels,"2.1 Biomass to biofuels In 2012, the estimated global petroleum consumption was about 89 million barrels per day from which about a half was used for gasoline production. The fossil fuel resources at this rate of consumption are predicted to run out within the next 50 years [6]. Biofuels offer a key solution for the present challenge since it is produced through renewable biomass resources. Biofuels can be classified into three main categories: First generation, second generation and third generation biofuels ( Fig. 1), while the fourth generation biofuels [7] make use of novel synthetic biology tools and are just emerging at the basic research level. The “First generation” biofuels are generally produced from agricultural crops (sugarcane, sugar beet, wheat, rice, soybean oil, sunflower and palm oil etc.) and there is a highly mature technology in converting crops to biofuels [8]. The consideration of using crops for food or for biofuel may be referred to as “Food v/s Energy” conflict. Therefore, researchers opted for the production of second and third generation biofuels which can be obtained from non-food crops, grasses, agricultural and food wastes, algae etc. The “second generation” biofuel production mainly focuses on the production of biofuels from the renewable resources, which could help to minimize the fossil fuel combustion and CO2 emission in concern to prevent our “Earth” from global warming. Thus, the utilisation of biomass resources is one of the most effective factors to protect our environment in the 21st century [9]. Examples of wastes which can be used for second generation biofuel production are municipal solid wastes, used cooking oil, industrial wastes, agricultural wastes, and sewage sludge. Biofuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-methanol, bio-butanol, biogas, and bio-hydrogen can be produced from them [8]. The “third generation” biofuels are mainly derived from algae feedstock. Bioethanol can be produced from algae feedstock and is known as one of the most important renewable energy source [10]. The “fourth generation” biofuels which are mainly photo biological solar fuels & electro-fuels and are expected to bring fundamental breakthroughs in the field of biofuels. Production of these solar biofuels is an emerging field technology and is based on the direct conversion of solar energy into fuel by use of raw materials which are inexhaustible, cheap and widely available [7]. First, second and third generation biofuels are derived from biomass whereas fourth generation biofuels take advantage of synthetic biology of algae and cyanobacteria [11–13]. Recently production of second and third generation biofuels is advantageous over first and generation biofuels as they are derived from agricultural residues and algal biomass respectively. Algal biomass is more abundant in nature, mainly grown in various types of wastewater sources [10]."
4,Biomass resources and biomass from agriculture,"2.2 Biomass resources and biomass from agriculture A wide variety of biomass can be used for biofuel production. The annual global primary production of biomass is about 220 billion tonnes on dry weight basis that is equivalent to 4500 EJ of solar energy captured each year. From this biomass, an annual bioenergy market of 270 EJ is possible on a sustainable basis [14]. Other biomass resources are wood and wood wastes, agricultural crops and their waste by-products, MSW, animal wastes, wastes from food processing, aquatic plants and algae. Maximum biomass energy is produced from wood and wood wastes (64%), followed by MSW (24%), agricultural waste (5%) and landfill gases (5%) [15]. Fast growing species such as poplar, willow or eucalyptus can be harvested after every few years. It is possible to harvest 10–13 t of dry matter biomass per hectare per annum, with short-rotation poplar coppices grown in three 7-year rotations on soil of average or good quality [16]. Waste wood from the forest products industry such as bark, sawdust, board ends etc. are widely used for energy production [9]. Algal biomass is also promising source especially for production of third generation biofuels like biodiesel. Table 1 details different categories of biomass resources. Agricultural biomass is a broad category of biomass which includes the food based portions of crops (corn, sugarcane, beets, fruits) and non-food based portions (leaves, stalks, cobs of corn stover, orchard trimmings, rice straw, rice husk), perennial grasses, and animal wastes [17]. Fruit wastes (pulp mill refuse) are the part of cellulosic wastes. Globally cultivated top four major crops are wheat, maize, rice and sugarcane respectively in terms of total cultivated area and production and they produce majority of lignocellulosic biomass in agriculture sector. Table 2 summarises estimated world annual production of major agricultural crop based biomass [18]. All these four major crops yield about 5358.54 million tonnes of dry biomass per year. Though its major part is utilised as animal's feedstock but a huge part of this biomass is burnt in fields [17]."
5,Chemical composition of agricultural wastes,"2.3 Chemical composition of agricultural wastes Agricultural wastes are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein and ash. Chemical composition of major agricultural crops is given in Table 3. Most of agricultural wastes are composed of lignocellulose which is a complex carbohydrate polymer of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The percent composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and others in lignocellulose are in the ranges 35–50%, 20–35%, 15–20% and 15–20% respectively [2]. 2.3.1 Cellulose Cellulose is linear and crystalline homo-polymer of repeating units of glucose linked by β − 1, 4 glycosidic bonds. The long linear chain of cellulose polymers, which have about 10,000 glucose units, are linked together by hydrogen bonds and van der Walls forces, because of which it is packed into micro fibrils [26] and chains tend to arrange in parallel and form a crystalline structure ( Fig. 2). 2.3.2 Hemicellulose Hemicellulose is a short heterogeneous and highly branched polymer. It is a heteropolymer of D-xylose, D-arabinose, D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose & some organic acids like acetic and glucuronic acid. Hemicellulose has linear and branched structure with backbone of repeated units of the same sugar (homopolymer) or by a mixture of different sugars (heteropolymer) ( Fig. 3). Besides the differences in the chemical composition, hemicellulose also differs from cellulose structure in other aspects, including: 1) the size of the chain, which is much smaller (it contains approximately 50–300 sugar units); 2) the presence of branching in the main chain molecules, and 3) it is amorphous and less resistant to chemicals [28]. 2.3.3 Lignin The lignin structure is not formed by sugar units, but by phenyl propane units linked in a large and very complex three-dimensional fashion. Three phenyl propionic alcohols are usually found as monomers of lignin, which include the alcohols p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl ( Fig. 4). Lignin is closely bound to cellulose and hemicellulose and its function is to provide rigidity and cohesion to the material cell wall, to confer water impermeability to xylem vessels and to form a physico–chemical barrier against microbial attack [28]. Lignin is hydrophobic in nature and is tightly bound to cellulose and hemicellulose polymers. It thus protects these polymers from microbial attack [20]."
6,Biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass,
7,Bio-hydrogen,"3.1 Bio-hydrogen Bio-hydrogen is a safe and cleanest biofuel for future prospects because when it is used as a fuel either in fuel cells or heat engines its only by-product formed is water which is carbon free and hence not a pollutant [31]. Bio-hydrogen is a non-toxic, colourless, tasteless and odourless gas and it has capability of producing more energy compare to any other fuel, which is about 122 kJ/g [32] has calorific value of 143 GJ/ton [31]. There are mainly three methods by which bio-hydrogen can be produced i.e. bio-photolysis of water, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation [33]. Bio-photolysis of water is a two-step process which involves a reversibly reducible cofactor and synergistic photo-metabolically active microorganisms like cyanobacteria and green microalgae [34]. Photo-fermentation is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen and is exhibited by a diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria by a series of biochemical reactions involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Photo-fermentation differs from dark fermentation as it occurs in the presence of light [35]. In dark fermentation hydrolysed biomass undergoes acidogenesis (formation of CH3COOH + H2) and hydrogen produced during acidogenesis is consumed in methanogenesis to form CH4 and CO2. In order to have good yield of hydrogen, its consumption (or methane formation) should be inhibited [36]. Bio-hydrogen can be produced from various feed-stocks like municipal solid wastes, wastewater sludge, lignocellulosic wastes and industrial wastes [8,37]. A large number of lignocellulosic wastes have been used for bio-hydrogen production ( Table 4). Heating of lignocellulosic biomass along with its alkaline or acid pretreatment has been found to be favourable for biohydrogen production. Most commonly used acid is H2SO4 and NaOH is the most commonly used alkali. Heating is necessary step for pretreatment and pH 5.5–6.5 is suitable for biohydrogen production [49]. Ultrasonic pretreatment gave higher biohydrogen yields [41]. Co-culture of micro-organisms may also increase biohydrogen production if different micro-organisms used are in symbiosis."
8,Bio-ethanol,"3.2 Bio-ethanol Currently bio-ethanol is the most common biofuel which can be mainly produced industrially from corn and sugarcane. The world annual production of ethanol increased to more than 85.6 billion litre in 2010. Ethanol can be blended with petrol because it can reduce emission of greenhouse gases, unburnt hydrocarbons and carcinogens. It can also reduce the emission of sulphur dioxide which is the main cause of acid rain [53]. There is a good potential of bio-ethanol production from various wastes and agricultural residues like woody feedstock, corn stover, corn stock, rapeseed waste, sugarcane bagasse, citrus peel, leaves and straws ( Table 5). It can be observed from Table 5 that dilute acid and alkali pretreatments have been commonly used for bio-ethanol production. Pretreatment of biomass with autohydrolysis (steam explosion) gave highest (~ 84%) bioethanol yield. Acid pretreatment has been found to be more effective with thermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass because in acid pretreatment hemicellulosic part of the biomass get converted into reducible sugars."
9,Bio-methanol,"3.3 Bio-methanol Large scale production of methanol from natural gas and coal is a well-developed technology. Methanol is a valuable liquid fuel and raw material for various synthetic hydrocarbon products. Petrochemical industries use methanol as a raw material for production of various chemicals such as MTBE, formaldehyde, acetic acid and biodiesel via trans-esterification. Methanol is a high octane liquid fuel which can be blended with gasoline and ethanol and can be used with today's vehicle technology at minimal incremental costs. Methanol prices today are competitive with hydrocarbon fuels [65]. Methanol is the most common type of alcohol used for performing the esterification reaction, as it is the least expensive industrial alcohol. In comparison with ethanol, it has a lower price, higher reactivity, simpler recoverability, preventing soap property and azeotrope formation tendency [66]. Bio-methanol is also said to be “wood alcohol.” Sustainable methods of bio-methanol production are currently less economical than ethanol production. Methanol is commonly produced from synthetic gas or biogas and used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Waste biomass such as old wood or biodegradable wastes are been used to produce methanol [67]. Some feedstocks used for bio-methanol production are described in Table 6. Less work has done on bio-methanol production (Table 6) and hence there is a need of further investigation on pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for methanol production. For bio-methanol production selection of microbes is a key step. Microorganisms like methylotrophs are used for oxidation of methane for methanol production. Methane can be easily produced from lignocellulosic biomass which can be than oxidised to bio-methanol with the help of methylotrophs."
10,Bio-methane,"3.4 Bio-methane Bio-methane is another highly promising biofuel due to its high energy value, for future perspectives and is formed during anaerobic digestion of the substrate. Methane production from a variety of biological or lignocellulosic wastes is considered favourable because of its economic and environmental benefits [9]. Production of methane via anaerobic digestion is a most efficient way of handling and energy generation from biomass, in term of energy output/input ratio (28.8 MJ/MJ) in comparison to all other technologies of energy production through biological and thermo-chemical routes of energy conversion processes [74]. Table 7 describes different feedstocks and their pretreatments used for bio-methane production. It can be concluded from Table 7 that among various types of pretreatments of substrate used for bio-methane production, alkali pretreatment (NaOH) has been most commonly used. It is evident from the literature that microalgal and macroalgal biomass are the good substrates for bio-methane production."
11,Bio-butanol,"3.5 Bio-butanol Commercial production of butanol is still not economical if the yield is lower than 25% of feedstock [85]. But the fuel characteristics of butanol are more attracting than the ethanol. Butanol can be used in internal combustion engine as a fuel. Because it's longer hydrocarbon chain causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline as compared to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without any modification. Similar to ethanol, a number of pretreatment methods are applied on lignocellulosic materials to break down the complex structure of cellulose, lignocellulose and lignin. Bio-butanol is generally produced through a microbial process, known as acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation [85]. Although, several bioprocessing approaches have been developed for pretreatment, saccharification and fermentation, bio-alcohol production from lignocelluloses is still limited because of the economic infeasibility of these technologies. This cost constraint could be overcome by designing and constructing robust cellulolytic and bio-alcohol producing microbes and by using them in a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) system [62]. Butanol is used as a solvent in cosmetics, hydraulic fluids, detergent formulations, drugs, antibiotics, hormones and vitamins and as a chemical intermediate in the production of butyl acrylate and methacrylate. It is also used as an extractant in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals [86]. Table 8 provides a list of feedstock used for production of bio-butanol. Enzymatic hydrolysis is more efficient among various substrate pretreatments used for bio-butanol production."
12,Bio-diesel,"3.6 Bio-diesel Bio-diesel is also a promising biofuel and high latent biodiesel could be derived from microalgae by microalgal biotechnology [3]. Algal biomass can be grown easily, under constructive conditions algae grows very rapidly and store about 50% oil of their total weight. There are thousands of algal species in our nature which vary in their length from microscopic to 60 m [95]. A large number of algal species (Chlorella, Chlamydomonas, Miscanthus, Nannochloropsis etc.) have been used for biofuel production in last few years. Algal by-products like oil and starch can be converted to biofuels like biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel. For biodiesel production, algal triglycerides undergo trans-esterification using an alkali catalyst [96]. Use of algal biomass for biofuel production owing more attraction than other biomass resources due to its capability to meet the future challenges in terms of abundance, elevated growth and production rates, no need to grow on agricultural land, highly suitable for production of liquid as well as gaseous biofuels and being capable in production of various kinds of value-added products in biorefineries [3]. Recently a new technology to capture carbon in the form of CO2 was developed using microalgal biomass [97]. Some biomasses used for bio-diesel production are described in Table 9."
13,Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass,"Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of cellulose, lignocellulose and lignin (Table 3). Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is the process ( Fig. 5) in which complex lignocellulose is converted into simple components such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Eventually removing lignin, preserving the hemicellulose, reducing the cellulose crystallinity and increasing the porosity of the material. A cost-effective pretreatment process must improve the formation of sugars in the subsequent phase of enzymatic hydrolysis, reducing the degradation of the carbohydrates, and the formation of inhibitors for hydrolysis and fermentation [102]. Main objectives of an effective pretreatment process are: a. Formation of sugars directly by hydrolysis, b. To avoid loss or degradation of sugars formed, c. To limit the production of inhibitory products, d. To reduce energy demands, and e. To minimize the cost of biofuel production. Methods of pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass Pretreatment methods are classified as- 1. Physical pretreatment. 2. Chemical pretreatment. 3. Physico-chemical pretreatment. 4. Biological pretreatment. 5. Combined pretreatment."
14,Physical pretreatment,"4.1 Physical pretreatment There are various physical pretreatment methods such as milling, chipping, grinding, freezing and radiation which are used to pretreat the lignocellulosic waste. These methods reduce the particle size and increase surface area of lignocellulosic materials. Several of these pretreatment methods are not effective alone and are used in combination with some other pretreatments. Various physical pretreatments along with their advantages and disadvantages are described as here: 4.1.1 Mechanical size reduction or mechanical comminution or milling Milling is often said to be the first step of pretreatment. Two-roll milling, ball milling, hammer milling, disk milling and colloid milling are several types of milling which are used in biofuel production processes. The type of the physical pretreatment used is responsible for the final particle size of feedstock achieved, for example, the particle size reduces to 10–30 mm and 0.2–2 mm, after chipping, milling and grinding respectively. Milling desperately consumes high energy which is its most important downside. Wet milling is more reasonable automatic pretreatment to overcome the energy consumption problem [68]. It has been found by De la Rubia et al. [103] that excessive size reduction of biomass may decrease biofuel production and result in over production of inhibitory volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which inhibits methane production during anaerobic digestion. Size reduction when combined with other pretreatment methods is more effective. A combination of milling, grinding, heating and 2% ammonia treatment resulted in highest biogas production from rice straw. Milling is advantageous as it does not produce ethanol fermentation inhibitors like furfural and hydroxyl methyl furfural [104]. 4.1.2 Microwave (MW) Microwave irradiation pretreatment is more conventional alternative technique to the simple heating process as it simply alters the ultra-structure of cellulose & degrades or partially removes hemicelluloses and lignin. It also enhances the enzymatic sensitivity of reducing sugars by disruption of silicified waxy surface. According to Gabhane et al. [105], microwave irradiation aids in cellulosic disintegration mainly due to dielectric polarization through molecular collision. The main advantages of this method are: high uniformity and selectivity short process time and less energy requirement compared to the traditional heating. Jackowiak et al. [106] irradiated wheat straw (WS) with MW at 150 °C and found that it was able to increase methane yield by 28% for WS as compared with untreated WS. Li et al. [107] investigated that MW pretreatment at 260 °C had an adverse effect on methane yield and methane production rate of an energy grass, Pennisetum hybrid. It was observed that 175 °C, biogas production decreased due to formation of refractory compounds. MW pretreatment might have the side effect of producing heat induced inhibitory products like phenolic compounds and furfural. Hence MW irradiation of lignocellulosic biomass is not fruitful individually due to formation of these inhibitors but usually has been used for providing heat assistance for acid and alkaline pretreatment and also for pretreating micro-organisms (inoculum) to supress their methanogenic activity [43]. Montingelli et al. [81] applied MW pretreatment on macroalgal biomass with beating and ball milling and reported its negative impact on bioenergy production with ball milling. 4.1.3 Extrusions (Ext) Ext is used for of heating and shearing to wet lignocellulosic biomass containing over 15–20% moisture. This is a thermo-physical pretreatment. It includes mixing, heating and shearing of material resulting in physical and chemical alteration. Effluent is not discharged and consequent effluent disposal cost and solid loss in extrusion can be eliminated [108]. Ext is more advantageous because high mechanical shear leads disruption of the biomass structure resulting in defibrillation and fibre shortening. It requires lower energy than mechanical comminution. The main problem occurs with Ext is restriction of flow ability of the material leading in separation of liquid from solid. This problem can be reduced by addition of chemicals (carboxy methyl cellulose combined with NaOH) which also enhance the flow ability of the material [109]. Chang and El-Dash used extrusion for pretreatment of cassava which resulted in an increased conversion of starch to ethanol [110]. When agricultural lignocellulosic biomass (maize, ryegrass, and rice straw silage and their blend) were extruded 8–13% more methane yield was achieved than untreated feedstocks. Brückner [111] carried out an industrial-scale study on biogas production from grass and maize and found that Ext increased total methane yield by 8–27% after 30 days of digestion. It has been suggested that an external heat supply may improve the Ext efficiency for increasing methane yield. Similar to other thermal pretreatments, formation of inhibitors like furfural and phenolic compounds also take place in Ext under certain conditions of high pressure. This is due to degradation of sugar and lignin content of material used. So care should be needed during treatment of materials through Ext. 4.1.4 Freezing (Frz) Frz is the recently developed novel approach for physical pretreatment of biomass and has ability to significantly increase the enzyme digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass. The method being very cost intensive and hence not much work has been done on it. The method has unique features like application of less dangerous chemicals, lower negative environmental impact and high productiveness. Chang et al. [112] reported 48–84% increment in enzyme digestibility of rice straw using Frz with 417.27 g/kg and 138.77 g/kg reducing sugar yields for 150 U cellulase and 100 U xylanase for 48 h respectively. Smichi et al. [113] pretreated Juncus maritimus with Frz/thawing pretreatment for its conversion to bioethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Theoretical ethanol yield was (84.28 ± 5.11) % with a productivity yield of (0.88 ± 0.16) g L−1 h−1 which was (90.87 ± 1.94) % of the theoretical yield. Freezing is also used to dry the lignocellulosic biomass [114]. 4.1.5 Pyrolysis Pyrolysis is a less energy consuming endothermic process in which the lignocellulosic biomass is treated at a temperature greater than 300 °C. In this process, decomposition of biomass cellulose into gaseous products H2, CO and char takes place. The residual char thus formed is further treated by mild acid and leached with water. The water leachate contains glucose as the main component which may be used as carbon source for biofuel production. Bu et al. [115] applied catalytic microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) for biofuels and other chemical production and concluded that heating rate, biomass conversion rate and product selectivity of different chemicals (hydrocarbons, guaiacols, furfural, furans, H2, CO etc.) were improved when some catalysts like activated carbon, silicon carbide and char were used with MAP."
15,Comparison of physical pretreatment methods,"4.2 Comparison of physical pretreatment methods It is evident that size reduction is the first step of pretreatment to reduce the size of lignocellulosic biomass, but this size reduction should not to be too large or too small to minimize the formation of inhibitors. For size reduction beating is more energy saving technique than simple milling and ball milling [81]. Selection of pretreatment methods totally depends on type and composition of biomass used for biofuel production. Among various physical pretreatment techniques described here, Ext is said to be best as it uses combination of mixing, heating and shearing, resulted in release of high amount of simple sugars which then undergo maximum biofuel production. Ext is cost effective process and can be applied easily for pretreatment of biomass. MW would also better than conventional heating if carried out at suitable temperature according to the type of biomass [107]. Frz has not been used widely due to its high operation cost and pyrolysis could be useful for production of gaseous biofuels but its use is limited in liquid biofuel production."
16,Chemical pretreatment,"4.3 Chemical pretreatment 4.3.1 Acid pretreatment (Acd) Acd is a well-known process most commonly used for chemical pretreatment of the lignocellulosic biomass. Acid solubilises polysaccharides (especially hemicellulose) into monomers by enzymatic hydrolysis leading to the enhancement of biofuel production. The commonly used conditions are low acid concentration with high temperature or high acid concentration with low temperature [48]. The major drawback of Acd is the production of various inhibitors (acetic acid, furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural) which inhibits growth of microbes [116]. Both organic and inorganic acids have been used for dilute Acd of lignocellulosic biomass these include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitrous acid [80], phosphoric acid, maleic acid, nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid etc. Among all above acids sulphuric acid was most commonly used [48,59,69,88,89]. Although concentrated acid treatment is highly effective on cellulose hydrolysis, but there are some negative impacts of using conc. acid i.e. toxicity, corrosiveness and requirement of expensive non-metallic containers for reactor construction. It should be noted that neutralisation of pH, which is necessary for pretreated materials prior to anaerobic digestion, generates large amounts of gypsum and resulting into disposal issues [69]. Dilute sulphuric acid has been commonly used for fermentative bio-ethanol production and found that furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural usually do not inhibit the microbial growth process until the concentration becomes more than 15–20 mM Uses of other acids like HNO3, CH3COOH and HCl have also been repeated but there use is limited due to less effective lignin removal. Georgia et al. [117] used 20 g HCl/100 g TS for pretreatment of sunflower straw and reported 104.78 ± 0.08 g ethanol yield. Phenolic compounds show their inhibitory behaviour according to their concentration and physicochemical properties i.e. solubility, molecular weight, hydrophobicity, etc. [118]. Therefore acid pretreatment conditions like acid concentration, retention time and reaction temperature should be monitored to reduce the production of inhibitors. Selection of suitable acid according to the material to be pretreated can also reduce the formation of inhibitors. 4.3.2 Oxidative pretreatment (Oxd) Oxidising agents like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or per acetic acid are used for pretreatment. Lignin forms soluble fragments with per acetic acid. During Oxd several reactions like displacement of side chains, electrophilic substitution, oxidative cleavage of aromatic nuclei or cleavage of alkyl aryl ether linkages can take place [58]·H2O2 pretreatment utilizes oxidative delignification which detaches and solubilizes the lignin and improve enzyme digestibility [62]. Oxd with H2O2 is most commonly used for enhancing microbial conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. Younho et al. [56] used H2O2 with acetic acid to pretreat Jarusalem artichoke and achieved approximately 84% ethanol yield. H2O2 was also used with alkali (NaOH and NaClO) [58,62] and found 79.27–84.64% and 207 mg/g ethanol yield respectively was estimated (Table 5). Oxd can be explosive if the oxidising agent is taken in concentrated form and is also cost intensive [119]. H2O2 is a strong oxidising agent for pretreatment of biomass used for biogas and bioethanol production but the drawback is that it oxidizes lignin to form soluble aromatic compounds which act as inhibitors. The H2O2 conc. more than 4% can also inhibit anaerobic digestion process due to toxicity of excess amount of hydroxyl ions to methanogens [120]. An additional research is needed to know the effect of peracetic acid on biohydrogen, bioethanol and methane production. 4.3.3 Alkaline pretreatment (Alk) Alk removes cellulose accessibility (for saccharification by enzymes) inhibitors like acetyl groups, lignin and several of uronic acid substitutions. Alk of lignocellulosic biomass disrupts the cell wall by solubilising polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicellulose lignin and silica by enzyme hydrolysis. Chemical swelling of fibrous cellulose also takes place [90] which includes salvation and saponification reactions favouring the disruption of crosslinks between hemicelluloses and some other components resulting in an increase in the porosity of the biomass. The main downsides of this method are need of long residence time and neutralization of the pretreated slurry [121]. Sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and ammonia are commonly used alkalis. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is most commonly used alkali in Alk and has been found to be more effective than untreated biomass with respect to biohydrogen, bioethanol, bio-methane and biobutanol production from different feedstocks [18,47,58,63,82,87,117]. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was used in the process of aqueous ammonia soaking to pretreat switch grass, resulting in solubilisation of 35% lignin and 41% hemicellulose and this pretreatment increased the methane yield by 65% at pretreatment conditions of 1.4 g dry material/g ammonia at ambient temperature for 5 days [122]. Based on above studies, NaOH pretreatment seems to be more cost effective and widely used Alk for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. The excessive use of NaOH may cause inhibition of anaerobic digestion, especially methanogenesis and also leads to soil salination and water pollution [18]. Chen [123] has developed an integrated NaOH pretreatment process in which NaOH was recycled to improve biogas yield from grape pomace and rice straw. This process could help to reduce the pretreatment cost and environmental pollution as well. 4.3.4 Ozonolysis Ozone gas can be used as an oxidant to break down lignin and hemicelluloses which result in an increase in cellulose biodegradability. Ozone is a water soluble powerful oxidant which can break down lignin and release soluble compounds with less molecular weight such as formic acid and acetic acid. Ozone pretreatment is expensive and a large amount of ozone is used to treat lignocellulosic materials, limiting the widespread use of ozonolysis. During ozone pretreatment, ozone molecules disintegrate into hydroxyl radicals (OH•) in water and these radicals result in oxidation by both the ozone itself and the OH• radicals [124]. Therefore, the pH of the solution determines to a large number of reactions that take place during ozonolysis pretreatment. 4.3.5 Ionic liquid pretreatment (IL) This pretreatment is based on ionic liquids (ILs) which can dissolve carbohydrates and lignin of lignocellulosic biomass, simultaneously. Ionic Liquids are organic salts composed of various cations and anions, primarily, large organic cations and small inorganic anions and have a melting point of 100 °C [106]. Degree of anion charge delocalization and cation structure are two major factors that affect chemical, physical and biological properties of ILs. Various ILs like N-methylmorpholine-N-Oxide monohydrate (NMMO), 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AMICl), 3-methyl-Nbutylpyridinium chloride (MBPCl) and 1-n-butyl-3 methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) have been used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to improve the enzymatic digestibility. Caporgno et al. [83] pretreated two species of microalgae with NMMO, resulting in 238–251 mL CH4/gvs. Major factors affecting the interaction between the lignocellulosic materials and the ILs used are anions, cations, time and temperature used in the pretreatment process. If ILs contains chloride, formate, acetate or alkyl phosphonate anions, it can dissolve cellulose by formation of strong hydrogen bonds [125]. Akhand (2012) optimised NMMO pretreatment for wheat straw and recorded 47% increase in methane yield than untreated wheat straw with 470 L/kg VS [126]. Although ILs pretreatment has significantly changed the biomass structure, it is also accompanied with three major problems i.e. need of large amount of expensive ILs, energy-intensive recycling of ILs and high viscosity of solution makes it difficult to handle. As compared to other volatile cellulose solvents ILs are more advantageous as they have low toxicity, viscosity and hydrophobicity, thermal stability, high reaction rates, broad cation and anion selection with low flammable properties. ILs do not have an environmental impact which makes them more popular than traditional liquid solvents. IL is a new technique for pretreating lignocellulose biomass for biofuel production yet there are some drawbacks like high cost, no data for toxicity issues and lack of knowledge about physico-chemical techniques. Thus, there is a need of further research in this field to find out the solution of these demerits. 4.3.6 Organosolv pretreatment (Orgv) Organic solvents (organosolv) like ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, acetone, ethylene glycol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol can be used, with or without the addition of a catalyst agent for the delignification of lignocellulosic material. The catalysts used may be organic or inorganic acids (HCl and H2SO4) or bases (NaOH, NH3 and CaCO3). Chenglun et al. [127] used organic amine catalytic Orgv of corn stover with n-propylamine and 60% v/v ethanol as solvent which resulted about 81.7% delignification and 83.2% total sugar yield. This pretreatment is especially effective for high lignin lignocellulosic biomass as it is capable of breaking the internal bonds of lignin and hemicelluloses. Guo-Chao et al. [91] pretreated corn stover using deep eutectic solvents for butanol production (Table 8). Fewer studies have been done using Orgv so there is a scope of further research in this field to optimise the suitable conditions."
17,Comparison of chemical pretreatment methods,"4.4 Comparison of chemical pretreatment methods Among all pretreatment methods described here Acd and Alk pretreatments were more extensively used for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass due to high solubilisation of cellulose and hemicellulose content and removal of lignin from the biomass. ILs and Orgn have high operational costs because of use of expensive ionic and organic liquids and recovery of these solvents is not possible. Ozn and Oxd also have high operational costs so their use is also limited. Although all of these pretreatment methods have their own merits and demerits, Acd can said to be best if dilute acid at high temperature is used for the pretreatment of biomass [80]. In Alk, wastage of water takes place for washing of pretreated biomass to remove the alkali, which not seems to be environmental friendly and Alk also contaminates soil and corrode the metal containers if used."
18,Physico-chemical pretreatment,"4.5 Physico-chemical pretreatment 4.5.1 Ammonia fibre explosion (AFExp) pretreatment In this pretreatment of biomass, liquid ammonia and the steam explosion process are applied. AFExp is a type of alkaline thermal pretreatment and optimization of the process can be done by varying water loading, ammonia loading, reaction temperature and residence time [128]. This process does not require small particle size for efficiency and inhibitors are not formed during the process but has some downsides like less efficiency towards high lignin containing biomass i.e. newspaper and softwood [129]. Hence it can be said that AFExp may be a cost effective technique for the pretreatment of biomass if ammonia can be recovered after pretreatment process. 4.5.2 Ultrasonication (US) US is a physical pretreatment used for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass for their conversion to biofuels but when US is used with an acid or base it can be called a physico-chemical pretreatment. In US, ultrasound generates monolithic cavitation, which results in various physical and chemical changes in liquid solutions. The physical change in US occurs from the collapse of cavitation bubbles then an elevated alteration in chemical nature is produced through the formation of free radicals [130]. The cell wall is disrupted due to the combine effects of both physical and chemical change. US pretreatment can disrupt the cell wall structure through cavitation, resulted in an increase in specific surface area, reduce the degree of polymerisation and also increase the biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass. In several studies of bio-hydrogen production, US pretreatment was used extensively with [42,48] or without an acid and alkali [38] to increase the yield. Federico et al. [48] used US with H2SO4, NaOH and CaCO3 for pretreatment of olive mill waste and olive pomace for bioethanol production and use of US with NaOH found best. It can be concluded that US pretreatment with alkali is more effective for disruption of cell wall for both biogas and bioethanol production. 4.5.3 Autohydrolysis (AutHy) or steam explosion pretreatment (SExp) SExp is a promising thermo-mechano-chemical method used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. This method makes biomass more operative to enzyme (cellulase) attack due to the disintegration of structural components of lignocellulose by steam-heating (thermo), shearing (mechano), and autohydrolysis of glycosidic bonds (chemical). In SExp, biomass particles are heated by the use of pressurized steam (160–270 °C, 20–50 bar) for only a few seconds to a few minutes and after that the reaction is stopped and pressure is released to atmospheric pressure, resulting in evaporation of succinct moisture and assimilation of lignocellulosic matrix [131]. Various feedstocks like olive tree pruning, coconut husk and cactus [61], wheat straw were pretreated with SExp for bioethanol production and sugarcane bagasse [79] and Miscanthus lutarioriparius [82] for bio-butanol production. The efficiency of SExp is affected by several factors like particle size, residence time (t), applied temperature (T). The optimum applied temperature residence time highly depends upon the type of biomass and is in the range of 120–220 °C for 2–8 min. SExp is advantageous because there is no need of chemicals hence no polluting effect, low energy demand and low recycling cost of waste stream but the major downside is low saccharification yields and solubilisation along with inhibitory products (furfural and hydroxyl methyl furfural) losses carbohydrates [116]. So much care should be taken on applying SExp like controlled temperature conditions and water washing of released sugars at the time of their solubilisation for removing the effect of inhibitory compounds. 4.5.4 Liquid hot water pretreatment (LHW) In LHW, high pressure and temperatures (160–220 °C) are employed to keep water in liquid state and it is kept in contact with biomass for about 15 min residence time in absence of any chemical or catalyst with relatively high xylose recovery about 80%. This results in an increase in cellulose digestibility because of hemicelluloses removal [132]. In contrast to SExp, rapid expansion or decompression is not required by LHW and pressure is utilised only for maintaining water and avoiding evaporation. LHW pretreatment has been found to be an efficient method for treating different types of lignocellulosic materials, like rice straw [18], sugarcane bagasse [133], corncobs, wheat straw, corn stover and rye straw [134]. Controlled pH between 4 and 7 is required in order to prevent the sugar degradation and formation of inhibitors. Laser et al. [133] applied LHW pretreatment on corn stover and optimised the pH-controlled LHW pretreatment (190 °C for 15 min) resulting in maximum hemicellulose solubilisation with minimal inhibitor formation. Unlike acid or alkali based pretreatments, LHW pretreatment does not require specific type of costly corrosive-resistant materials for reactor setup. It can be concluded that pH controlled (neutral pH) LHW pretreatment may result in releasing lower amount of inhibitors which will be favourable for anaerobic digestion process. 4.5.5 Wet oxidation (WO) pretreatment In WO pretreatment technology the lignocellulosic material is treated with water involving oxygen or air as catalyst. This operation usually occurs at temperature more than 120 °C and pressures ranging between 0.5 and 2 MPa for less than 30 min. In this technique, the transfer of solid phase hemicellulose to liquid phase is promoted and water to biomass ratio is taken about 1 L water for 6 g biomass. During WO, hemicellulose is hydrolysed into sugar oligomers. Banerjee et al. [135] conducted a study in which more efficient WO pretreatment conditions for rice husk was obtained at a reaction temperature of 185 °C and air pressure of 0.5 MPa for 15 min. 66.97% of the cellulose was present in the solid fraction and 89% lignin was removed. WO is a non-selective process and often accompanied by loss of hemicellulose. There are various advantages of WO pretreatment but its commercial application is generally revoked because of the high cost of pressure equipment, oxygen and catalyst used and also due to inhibitor (furfural and aromatic compounds) generation from oxidation of lignin. 4.5.6 CO2 explosion pretreatment (CO2 Exp) CO2 Exp is much similar to AFExp and SExp. CO2 molecules have similar size property as H2O and NH3 hence can diffuse into small pores of lignocellulosic biomass. This property is used in SExp and AFExp pretreatment methods also. The major downside of CO2 Exp is the high cost of the process as compared to AFExp. Inhibitor formation is negligible in the process as compared to SExp [136], and hence is preferred over other explosion type methods. Its non-toxic, non-flammable nature and higher conversion yield makes the CO2 explosion method more advantageous."
19,Comparison of physico-chemical pretreatment methods,"4.6 Comparison of physico-chemical pretreatment methods From physico-chemical pretreatments described here, it can be concluded that pH controlled LHW pretreatment is the best because it does not require any chemical or catalyst. In other pretreatment methods, chemicals like NH3, CO2, acid, alkali and catalysts were used along with physical pretreatment process. LHW require lower amount of pressure as compared to SExp and it doesn’t require costly corrosion resistant containers for operation. Inhibitor formation is also minimum at neutral pH for LHW."
20,Biological pretreatment,"4.7 Biological pretreatment Biological pretreatment is a safe and environmental friendly method for lignin removal from lignocellulose. Mostly used biological pretreatment methods are fungal pretreatment, microbial consortium and enzymatic pretreatment. 4.7.1 Fungal pretreatment (FP) The most favourable microorganisms for biological pretreatment are various species of white-rot fungi belonging to class Basidiomycetes. Phanerochaete chrysosporium have maximum efficiency among the various known species of white-rot fungi because of its high growth rate and also capable in lignin biodegradation [136]. Biological or microbial pretreatment makes difference with chemical and physico-chemical pretreatment methods as they do not require chemicals. Moisture content, particle size, temperature and pretreatment time affect lignin degradation and yield of enzymatic hydrolysis in biological pretreatment. Wan and Li [137] investigated the effect of various factors on the pretreatment productivity using Ceriporiopsis subvermispora for ethanol production from corn stover which resulted up to 31.59% lignin degradation and 94% of cellulose during pretreatment time of 18 day. In spite of tolerable environmental conditions, low amount of energy consumption and no chemical requirement, biological pretreatment still faces some downsides by which extensive applications of this artistry as a mercantile pretreatment method are negatively affected. These include requirement of large space, long process time and the need of recording microorganism growth continuously. 4.7.2 Microbial consortium pretreatment (MCons) Microbes from natural environment (soil, cow dung, goat dung etc.) are used for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass. MCons has the ability to degrade both cellulose and hemicellulose of biomass which is different to fungal pretreatment in which only lignin content of biomass is degraded. Zhang et al. [138] constructed a thermophilic MCons from samples combined from different sources such as thermophilic landfill and decaying straw which was then mixed with distillery wastewater to pretreat cassava waste at 55 °C for 12 h, leading to 96% higher methane yield than untreated waste. In another study, consortia screened from natural environment, mixture of pure strains of yeast and cellulolytic bacteria were also used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass in biological pretreatment [138]. Co-cultures of some pure strains were also investigated [49] for bio-hydrogen production (Table 4) and an increase in H2 yield was obtained. Consortium was also pretreated with MW [42], pH and heat [37,44] to supress the activity of methanogenic bacteria for maximum bio-hydrogen production (Table 4). The advantage of MCons over FP is that the sterilisation of lignocellulosic material is not required in most of the cases. 4.7.3 Enzymatic pretreatment (Enz) Enzymes with hydrolytic activity, most commonly cellulases and hemicellulases are used to pretreat the lignocellulosic biomass. It is believed that hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose is rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion [139]. In most of cases it was observed that Enz has minimal effect in increasing biogas production and enzyme cost was more, limiting the use of Enz. Sen et al. [48] pretreated rice straw with enzyme and acid for both bio-hydrogen and bio-ethanol production (Tables 4, 5). Various feedstocks like cassava pulp and cassava starch water, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover and planetary milling and Pinus rigida were pretreated with enzymes for bio-butanol production (Table 8). In general most of the biological pretreatments are not as promising as chemical pretreatment itself for biofuel production due to high retention time, cost effectiveness and high selectivity of microbes, further research is needed to overcome the issues of selectivity, cost, retention time and effectiveness."
21,Comparison of biological pretreatment methods,4.8 Comparison of biological pretreatment methods Among all three pretreatment methods described here MCons is the best because mixed microbial source are used in this process which reduces chances of contamination and also the cost of maintenance. Enz have high operation costs due to additional care should be taken at the time of pretreatment. In fungal pretreatment much care is require preventing the contamination of one species of fungi from the other because contamination may result in lower amount of biofuel production.
22,Combined pretreatment,"4.9 Combined pretreatment To overcome various drawbacks of above pretreatment methods, a combination of two or more methods for improving the pretreatment process are developed. An increased efficiency of sugar production, shortened process time and decreased formation of inhibitors is observed when combination of pretreatment methods has been tried. These combinations of pretreatment would result in more commercial process and higher biofuel yield [2]. 4.9.1 Combined SO2 and steam explosion pretreatment (SO2-SExp) Recovery of cellulose and hemicellulose both can be increased by the addition of SO2 to SExp pretreatment. The amount of SO2 added depends upon the type of biomass used and vary in the range of 1–5%. Maximum glucose yield up to 95% was obtained for 1% SO2 mixed with SExp at 200 °C [140]. 4.9.2 Combined enzyme hydrolysis and superfine grinding with steam explosion (EH-SFG-SExp.) Jin and Chen [141] studied enzymatic hydrolysis of a combination of superfine grinding and steam explosion of rice straw. SFG was combined with low severity SExp for treating rice straw to reduce the energy cost, shorten the grinding time, obtain high enzymatic hydrolysis and this combined pretreatment also avoids the production of inhibitors. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the superfine ground product yielded more reducing sugar and gained the highest hydrolytic rate, while the reducing sugar yield generated from the superfine ground residue alone which was even lower than that from the untreated rice straw. It is observed that combination of steam explosion and super fine grinding decrease particle size and improve reactive surface to the largest content, and it was considered to be less energy consuming than conventional mechanical grinding with respect to increase in the surface area of lignocellulosic material. 4.9.3 Combined dilute acid and steam explosion pretreatment (DA-SExp.) To enhance saccharification efficiency of biomass, the combination of dilute acid and SExp is applied. Xylose conversion can be maximized by first dilute-acid hydrolysis followed by break down of the lignocellulosic structure by SExp which is the second step. The application of DA-SExp on rice straw was investigated by Wen et al. [142] in which 2% H2SO4 was used in the first step at 165 °C for 2 min followed by the second step which was performed at 180 °C for 20 min resulting a high yield of xylose and production of low levels of inhibitors. 4.9.4 Combined supercritical CO2 and steam explosion pretreatment (SCCO2-SExp.) Alinia et al. [143] presented a comparison of supercritical CO2 and SCCO2-SExp pretreatment of wheat straw. It had been shown experimentally that the combined method employed in two stages i.e. the supercritical CO2 explosion at 12 MPa, 190 °C for 60 min and the steam-injection stage at 200 °C for 15 min was more efficient as compared to the supercritical CO2 explosion at 12 MPa, 190 °C and 30 min alone with a yield of 149.1 and 234.6 g/kg wheat straw for SCCO2 and SCCO2-SExp respectively. 4.9.5 Combined biological and dilute acid pretreatment (Bio-DA) It is well known that acid pretreatment is a favourable method for the solubilisation of hemicelluloses; instead, biological pretreatment disrupts the lignin–hemicellulose sheath by using fungus, with a need of low energy and mild environmental conditions [144]. Obviously, both pretreatment methods have some downsides such as environment-unfriendly behaviour, being energy-intensive and high pressure requirements for the acid pretreatment and long process time and lack of economic compatibility for biological pretreatment. 4.9.6 Combined organosolv and biological pretreatment (Bio-Orgv) The synergic effects of the combination of the two methods Bio-Orgv pretreatment were evaluated by Monroe et al. [145] on Pinus radiata wood chips. Brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was used for three weeks on Pinus radiata followed by delignification of the bio-treated material by the use of organosolv ethanol: water mixture. The results obtained through this experiment displayed that the same yield of bioethanol was achieved for both experiments i.e. bio-orgv and orgv alone. 4.9.7 Combined dilute acid and microwave pretreatment (DA-MW) Chen et al. [146] evaluated the impact of dilute H2SO4 acid pretreatment on sugarcane bagasse in combination with microwave heating. In that study, 10 g of dry bagasse sample was soaked in 200 mL H2SO4 with conc. of 1.56 wt%, blended in a reactor and heated in a microwave oven at three different reaction temperatures i.e. 130, 160 and 190 °C for two heating times of 5 and 10 min. Complete hemicellulose degradation and swelling as well as maximum biomass fragmentation were achieved at 190 °C. 4.9.8 Microwave-assisted-alkali pretreatment Microwave irradiation is capable in increasing the chemical reaction rate through their synergic effect and also leads to an explosion effect within the biomass particles. Instead of the conventional heating, microwave-based heating was utilised in a study to pretreat switch grass with an alkali, with 50 g/L solid content for 30 min treatment time at an optimum temperature of 190 °C and the sugar yield recorded was 58.7 g/ 100 g biomass [105]. 4.9.9 Combined biological and steam explosion pretreatment (Bio-SExp) Four white-rot fungi were used by Taniguchi et al. [147] to pretreat rice straw and among the fungi used P. ostreatus was found to be most effective for degrading lignin but it have lower impact on cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. Therefore, the combination with steam explosion on 1.5 MPa for 1 min was employed in order to decrease the considerable loss of helocellulose (the total polysaccharide fraction of wood or straw) during the long pretreatment time (60 days) and to increase the affectivity of pretreatment. The pretreatment time was reduced significantly from 60 to 36 days by the combination of the two methods. 4.9.10 Combined Ionic liquid and ultrasonic pretreatment Instead of the traditional heating pretreatment, the application of ultrasound as a pretreatment method could lead to enhanced saccharification ratio. Ninomiya et al. [148] studied the synergetic effect of combined ultrasonic pretreatment with different ILs i.e. 1-Butyl-3-Methylimidazolium chloride, 1-Allyl-3-Methylimidazolium chloride, 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium chloride, 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium diethyl phosphate, and 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium acetate. They reported that prior traditional heating at an optimum temp. 110 °C for 120 min for kenaf powders, which were then pretreated in first four ILs mentioned above resulted in the cellulose saccharification ratio of about 20%. When the ultrasonic pretreatment replaced the traditional heating in the same ILs at 25 °C for 120 min, this ratio was increased significantly from 60% to 95%. 4.9.11 Combined alkali and electron beam irradiation pretreatment Lu and Minoru [149] reported electron beam irradiation pretreatment of rice straw using an electron beam accelerator in NaOH solution. It has been reported that electron beam irradiation alter the lignocellulosic structure so that sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution could penetrate easily into the lignocellulosic complex and cellulose or hemicellulose gets scissored by irradiation which increased the reaction rate; ease of lignin removal and finally ease of enzymatic accessibility. 4.9.12 Combined alkali and photo-catalysis pretreatment Kun et al. [150] pretreated rice straw with alkali assisted photo-catalysis which affectively changed the tiny structure and physical properties of rice straw. It resulted in decrease in lignin content and hence increased the enzymatic hydrolytic rate of the pretreated rice straw. In absence of H2O2, alkali treatment of rice straw favoured dissolution of the small molecular size of glucose rich hemicelluloses, probably arising from α-glucan. Solubilisation of larger molecular size hemicelluloses rich in xylose was enhanced by the second stage treatment through alkaline peroxide. 4.9.13 Combined alkali and Ionic liquid pretreatment The combination of ammonia and anionic liquid, 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium acetate [(EMIM) Ac], for pretreatment of rice straw was reported by Nguyen et al. [151]. This method is based on solubilisation effect of ILs and delignification effect of ammonia in order to increase bio-digestibility of lignocellulosic materials, resulting in higher cellulose recovery and glucose conversion which could not be achieved by the individual ammonia or ILs pretreatments. 4.9.14 Microwave assisted acid pretreatment (MW-ACD) Several combinations of microwave pretreatment along with acid and alkali have been reported by Zhu et al. [152] for rice straw. Acid and alkali pretreatments remove hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. More lignin was removed by microwave assisted pretreatment as compared to pretreatment with alkali alone. It is evident by the results that the lower microwave power with longer pretreatment time and higher microwave power with shorter pretreatment time had almost the same effect on lignin removal and composition of lignocellulosic material at the same energy consumption."
23,Comparison of combined pretreatments,"4.10 Comparison of combined pretreatments A number of combinations were applied for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass in last few years. Combination of two or more pretreatment methods was found effective than a single pretreatment technique. EH-SFG-SExp is the best pretreatment method due to particle size reduction, more yield of reducing sugars, improvement of reactive surface and less energy consumption than conventional grinding [141]. DA-SExp is effective for yielding high amount of xylose with lesser amounts of inhibitor production. DA-MW was found good at 190 °C while pretreatment time was reduced about to half by using Bio-SExp with decrease in the amount of helocellulose. MW combined with acid or alkali seems to be more effective than conventional heating process because less time is required in the pretreatment and also reduces the operation costs."
24,Conclusion,"The abundance of lignocellulosic wastes has inspired the researchers to use this cheap source for biofuel production. Lignocellulosic waste is achieving popularity as a source of fermentable sugars for liquid fuel production. Enzymatic treatment after pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is more expensive and that is why extensive research has been carried out regularly to overcome this problem ultimately. To find a best pretreatment method it is also necessary to utilise the waste for the formation of biofuel without using expensive chemicals. In general pretreatment methods are classified into four main types, physical, chemical, physico-chemical and biological. All these methods have their own demerits or drawbacks and one method cannot be used for all types of biomass. So there is a need to understand various pretreatment processes, different biomass structure, composition and also the relationship between the composition and pretreatment of agricultural feedstock and their pretreatment according to different composition. Combining two or more pretreatment methods has resulted in improved yields but it also has some drawbacks like more energy intensive as compared to single pretreatment. In single pretreatment methods dilute acid pretreatment seems more suitable for various types of biomass as major part of hemicellulose is solubilised with partial removal of lignin. AFExp is more appropriate for agricultural wastes whereas LHW is suitable for biomass with low-lignin content. AFExp augments biomass digestibility, redistributes lignin and hemicelluloses and enhances the accessible surface area of the biomass. The utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production is found to be cost-effective and environmental friendly. Considering the evolution and necessity for second generation biofuel production lignocellulosic biomass appears a promising substrate. On contrary, we cannot depend entirely on second generation biofuels because lignocellulosic biomass is not available all time (available in abundance on harvesting time). A balance should be maintained between fossil fuels, first generation biofuels and second generation biofuels to fulfil our energy demand in future. For more economical development of second generation biofuels, finding a new market will be useful. Utilisation of second generation biofuel in airlines and aircraft industries may be a new market which is environmental friendly as well. This review article would be helpful to find the best method of pretreatment according to the lignocellulosic biomass type. It would also provide concise information about various types of combinations of pretreatment processes."
