0,Introduction,"Biomass has the potential to serve as a sustainable chemical resource in the industrial society. In biorefinery development, various biomass-based chemicals have been listed as potential candidates of biorefinery building blocks, and furfural is expected as one of new candidates [1]. The new top 10 candidates are ethanol, furans including furfural, glycerol, biohydrocarbons including isoprene, lactic acid, succinic acid, hydroxypropionic acid/aldehyde, levulinic acid, sorbitol, and xylitol in this order. Furfural has been widely investigated on the catalytic conversion into useful chemicals, whereas the reports of furfural are much less than those of ethanol and glycerol. Furfural with a low oxygen content is one of promising alternative chemical resources, and commercial production of furfural is well established [1]. Furfural is prepared through the dehydration of pentose polyols, such as xylose, or hemicelluloses catalyzed by sulfuric acid [2–4] and solid acid [5,6]. Hemicellulose, a polymer of glucose and xylose, is inedible biomass of some hardwoods and agriculture residues such as corncob and sugar cane bagasse [2]. Furfural can be derived to useful chemicals, such as furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (hereafter abbreviated as THFA), furfuryl amine, furoic acid, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltertahydrofuran, furan, tetrahydrofuran [7–9], and cyclopentanone [10]. THFA can be obtained in the hydrogenation of furfural [8,11] and is used as an industrial solvent [9]. Various useful chemicals, such as δ-valerolactone [12,13], tetrahydrofuran [13–16], 3,4-2H-dihydropyran (abbreviated as DHP) [17–26], 1,5-pentanediol [7,18,27–31], and 4-penten-1-ol [12,32–34], can be derived from THFA. In industrial applications, DHP is a chemical intermediate: it can be hydrated into 5-hydroxypentanal, which is further hydrogenated into 1,5-pentandediol [18]. DHP is also well known as a protection reagent of alcohol in organic synthesis [35]. It has been known that THFA is converted into DHP over alumina catalyst since 1930s (Fig. 1 ) [18]. The alumina catalyst, however, is readily deactivated in inert atmosphere such as N2 and He flow, so that the yield of DHP is so high only in the initial period [17–19]. Several modifications of alumina with other metal oxides are found in patent literatures: TiO2-rich TiO2-Al2O3 [20], V2O5/Al2O3 [22], MoO3/Al2O3 [22], and alumina catalysts modified with various metal oxides [23,24] work as a catalyst. It is reported that DHP yields exceed 90% at 250–320°C [20,26], while the deactivation behavior is unclear. The catalyst needs regeneration process for the catalysts used in the reaction [20]. There are several reports on the inhibition of deterioration of acid-catalyzed reactions with the aid of supported noble metal in hydrogen gas [36–38]. We have also found that alumina modified by transition metals such as Co stabilizes the conversion of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone to produce 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene in H2 flow [39], whereas the catalytic activity of alumina is seriously deteriorated irrespective of its high initial activity. Hydrogen with the supported metal probably removes the product from the acid sites prior to coke formation and plays an important role to stabilize the catalytic activity of alumina. In this paper, we investigated effective systems for the conversion of THFA into DHP to stabilize the catalytic activity and discussed the reaction pathway from THFA to DHP together with side reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst samples,"2.1 Catalyst samples THFA and DHP were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co, Ltd. 2-Hydroxyteterahydropyran was synthesized via the hydration of DHP, according to a reference [40]. Metal nitrates such as Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, and Cu(NO3)2 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. Alumina-supported noble metal catalysts, such as M/Al2O3 (M=Rh, Pt, Pd; 0.5wt.%), were supplied by N.E. Chemcat Co. γ-Al2O3 (DC-2382) and anatase TiO2 (DC-3124) were supplied by Dia Catalyst. Tetragonal ZrO2 (abbreviated as t-ZrO2) was supplied by Saint-Gobain K. K. and monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) by Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co. Yb2O3 and La2O3 were supplied by Kanto Kagagu Co., Ltd. Supported base-metal catalysts were prepared by impregnation using aqueous metal nitrate solution. The nitrate solution was added to a support, and water was evaporated at ambient pressure and 70°C by being illuminated by 350-W electric light bulb. After impregnation, the obtained solid was dried at 110°C over 24h and then calcined at 500°C for 3h."
3,Catalytic reaction,"2.2 Catalytic reaction The reaction of THFA to DHP was performed in a fixed-bed down-flow glass tube reactor with an inner diameter of 17mm and a length of 300mm at 200–300°C under atmospheric pressure at N2- or H2-flow rate of 20cm3 min−1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was preheated in the carrier gas at 500°C for 1h. After the preheating, the catalyst bed was cooled to the reaction temperature, and the substrate was fed into the reactor at a liquid feed rate of 1.5cm3 h−1. Unless otherwise noted, a reaction was carried out under the conditions using a catalyst of 0.5g at 300°C and W/F =0.32g h cm−3, where W and F are catalyst weight and reactant feed rate, respectively. The effluent was collected every hours for 5h at 0°C and analyzed by FID-GC (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co.) using a 60-m capillary column of TC-WAX (GL Science Inc.). A GC-MS (QP5050A, Shimadzu Co.) was used to identify products in the effluent."
4,Characterization of catalyst,"2.3 Characterization of catalyst The specific surface area of the catalyst, SA, was calculated with the BET method using N2 isotherm at −196°C. Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was conducted in air using Thermo plus TG8120 (Rigaku Co.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was taken by a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operated at 120kV. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 adsorbed at 100°C was examined by neutralization titration using an electric conductivity cell immersed in aqueous H2SO4 solution, and the detail procedure has been described elsewhere [41]. NH3 that desorbed with N2 carrier gas was bubbled into a dilute H2SO4 solution. The amount of desorbed NH3 was monitored from the change in conductivity of the solution. The sample was heated from 25 to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 in N2 flow of 50cm3 min−1. The amount of acid sites is defined as the number of NH3 molecules desorbed in the temperature range of 25–500°C on the assumption that one NH3 molecule adsorbs on one basic site of the catalyst surface. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were performed from 25 to 900°C at a heating rate of 5Kmin−1 to characterize the state of the supported metals. A mixture of H2/N2 (=1/9) was flowed at a rate of 10cm3 min−1 and ambient pressure over the catalyst filled in a quartz tube. The amount of H2 consumed during the reduction was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of catalyst samples,"3.1 Characterization of catalyst samples Table 1 summarized specific surface area of oxide catalysts such as Al2O3, t-ZrO2, m-ZrO2 and TiO2. Fig. 2 shows TPD profiles of NH3 adsorbed on the samples. The samples have desorption peak around 250°C. The amount of desorbed NH3 as a function of acid sites is also summarized in Table 1. Monoclinic ZrO2 was not acidic because NH3 did not adsorb at 100°C. It was proved that Al2O3, t-ZrO2 and TiO2 were acidic, as it is well known. Fig. 3 shows TPR profiles of alumina-supported metal oxides. Co3O4/Al2O3 had reduction peaks at 339, 488, and 583°C, and NiO/Al2O3 had reduction peaks at 467 and 520°C. CuO/Al2O3 had reduction peaks at 221 and 246°C. Rh/Al2O3 had a very small reduction peak at 231°C, while Pt/and Pd/Al2O3 had no peaks. The TPR results indicate that the supported metals of CuO/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Rh/Al2O3 are in metallic state in the reaction of THFA in H2 flow at 300°C. Fig. 4 shows a TEM image of 15wt% CuO/Al2O3 reduced at 500°C. Bright particles of alumina with the size of 20–30nm and dark copper particles with the same size as alumina were observed in the sample."
7,Reaction of THFA over several oxide catalysts,"3.2 Reaction of THFA over several oxide catalysts Table 2 summarizes the catalytic performance of several metal oxide catalysts in the dehydration of THFA at 300 or 350°C in N2 flow. DHP was produced over acid catalysts such as Al2O3, t-ZrO2, and TiO2, whereas DHP could not be produced over m-ZrO2 and rare earth oxides such as Yb2O3 and La2O3, which have only basic sites [42]. Catalytic activity of acidic Al2O3 and t-ZrO2 was significantly decreased with time on stream, as shown in Fig. 5A. TiO2 also showed deterioration (figure not shown). In the acid catalysts, Al2O3 and t-ZrO2 showed moderate activity to DHP because the catalytic deactivation was occurred in 5h. Thus, the results indicate that dehydration of THFA needs acidic sites. In addition, over Al2O3, change in selectivity in H2 flow was similar to that in N2 flow (Fig. 5A)."
8,Reaction of THFA over alumna catalysts modified with metals,"3.3 Reaction of THFA over alumna catalysts modified with metals Table 3 lists average catalytic activity of the samples in the initial 5h. Commercial Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 used as a catalyst seemed to have moderate activity in N2 flow at 300°C. However, they were deteriorated with time on stream, as shown in blue dotted lines in Fig. 5B and C. The main product was DHP, and the by-products were tetrahydropyran and δ-valerolactone. In H2 flow, however, Rh/Al2O3 showed stable conversion of THFA (Fig. 5B), while the selectivity to DHP varied with time on stream. On the other hand, Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 showed low selectivity to DHP in H2 flow because hydrogenation to tetrahydropyran proceeded (Table 3), and mass balance was low because of gasification. Pt supported on acidic catalysts such as sulfated ZrO2 shows a stable activity in the isomerization of alkane [36–38]. Unfortunately, noble metals such as Pt, Rh, and Pd are insufficient for keeping stable catalytic activity in H2 flow. The by-products were tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, 1-pentanol, and 1-butanol in H2 flow over the catalysts. In addition, over Rh/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3, δ-valerolactone was produced at 300°C, and 1,5-pentandiol was detected in H2 flow at a low temperature of 250°C. In contrast to the noble metals, CuO/Al2O3 showed stable conversion and high selectivity to DHP in H2 flow, while it was deteriorated in N2 flow (Fig. 5D). The by-products were tetrahydropyran and δ-valerolactone with a small amount produced even in H2 flow. Mass balance in H2 flow over CuO/Al2O3 was as high as that of Rh/Al2O3. Judging from the results of TPR (Fig. 3), it is obvious that Cu species are reduced to metallic state, which could be maintained during the reaction in H2 flow. Table 4 shows the effect of CuO content of Al2O3-supported catalysts on the reaction of THFA in H2 flow at 300°C. The THFA conversion was almost constant irrespective of CuO content or might gradually increase with increasing CuO content. On the other hand, the selectivity to DHP seems to be maximized at CuO content of 5–10wt.%: mass balance in this CuO range was better than that at high CuO contents as well as that at low contents. Fig. 6 depicts the change in catalytic activity of NiO/Al2O3 and Co3O4/Al2O3 in H2 flow with time on stream, together with that of CuO/Al2O3. Table 3 also lists their average activity. NiO/Al2O3 and Co3O4/Al2O3 had a similar catalytic behavior to those of Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3: mass balance was low because of gasification. The by-products were tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, 1-pentanol, 1-butanol, and δ-valerolactone in H2 flow over NiO/Al2O3 catalyst, while the by-products over Co3O4/Al2O3 catalyst were tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, and δ-valerolactone."
9,Characterization of alumina used in the reaction,"3.4 Characterization of alumina used in the reaction Fig. 7 shows TG-DTA profiles of pure Al2O3 and 5wt.% CuO/Al2O3 catalysts used in the reaction in H2 flow at 300°C for 5h. A large weight loss was observed at temperatures of 200–500°C and 180–450°C in the samples of Al2O3 and CuO/Al2O3, respectively. The alumina used in the reaction had a weight loss with 14.5% in the TG profile at 500°C, while the fresh alumina had a weight loss of dehydration with 3.0%. The difference of the weight loss between fresh and used catalysts would be regarded as carbon deposited on the samples during the reaction. The carbon was exothermically removed in air at 330 and 440°C (Fig. 7), and the color of the used alumina turned white after TG analysis. The CuO/Al2O3 used in the reaction, however, had a weight loss with 11.8% at 500°C and exothermic peak at 300°C, while the fresh CuO/Al2O3 had a weight loss of dehydration with 4.1%. The weight loss in the removed carbonaceous materials can be estimated by the difference of the weight loss between fresh and used catalysts: the amounts of coke deposited on pure Al2O3 and CuO/Al2O3 are 11.5 and 7.7%, respectively. This indicates that the coke formation is inhibited in the reaction over CuO/Al2O3 under H2 atmosphere conditions."
10,Probable reaction route over alumina,"3.5 Probable reaction route over alumina In order to prove an intermediate species, 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran (2HTHP) was prepared as an intermediate candidate. When 2HTHP, instead of THFA, was fed into the reactor over Cu-alumina catalyst in H2 at 200°C, 2HTHF was converted to DHP and to δ-valerolactone with the selectivity of 64 and 10%, respectively, at 100% conversion. The other products were 1-pentanol, pentanoic acid, and 1,5-pentanediol. Therefore, 2HTHP can be readily dehydrated to DHP at a temperature lower than 300°C which is the effective reaction temperature of THFA. It is proposed that 2HTHP is probably an intermediate from THFA to DHP. Fig. 8 summarizes a probable reaction routes in the conversion of THFA over modified alumina catalysts. At 300°C, THFA could be rearranged into 2HTHP. 2HTHP is immediately dehydrated to DHP, so that it could not be detected in the effluent mixture. Thus, the rate determining step is probably the initial step, which is the rearrangement of THFA into 2HTHP. The major by-products such as tetrahydropyran and δ-valerolactone are formed through step-wise hydrogenation of DHP and dehydrogenation of 2HTHP, respectively. Over the catalysts with high potential in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, 1-pentanol, tetrahydrofuran, and 1-butanol are formed via step-wise reactions, as shown in Fig. 8."
11,Conclusions,"Vapor-phase catalytic conversion of THFA to produce DHP was investigated over acidic catalysts modified with transition metals. Catalytic activity of alumina was seriously deactivated in N2 flow at 300°C, whereas the initial activity was high. Tetragonal ZrO2 also showed the same catalytic activity as alumina at 350°C. The catalytic activity of alumina modified with either Cu or Rh was stabilized in the conversion of THFA into DHP under H2 flow conditions. The optimum activity was obtained in the catalysts at CuO contents of 5–10wt.%: the selectivity to DHP exceeded 85% and the best mass balance was achieved. CuO was reduced to metallic Cu that was maintained during the reaction at 300°C, Cu metal probably works as a remover for deposited carbon and prevents coke formation by the aid of hydrogen. In the conversion of THFA to DHP, we propose that THFA is initially rearranged into 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran as an intermediate that is rapidly dehydrated to DHP. The first-step rearrangement could be the rate-determining step in the reaction."
