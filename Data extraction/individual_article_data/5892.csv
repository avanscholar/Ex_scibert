0,Introduction,"Biofuels, such as biodiesel and bio-alcohols, are important alternative renewable fuels to mitigate the recent energy crisis, future energy requirements, and environmental concerns [1,2]. According to the International Energy Agency, global energy consumption has increased sharply, and it will increase by approximately 53% by 2030 [3]. The United States Energy Information Administration projects that the liquid fuel consumption worldwide will increase from 86.1millionbarrels/day to 110.6millionbarrels/day by 2035 [4]. Furthermore, combustion of petroleum-derived fuel generates emissions that seriously affect both the environment and human health. Biodiesel is presently argued as a replacement of diesel fuel in the future because it is renewable, biodegradable, and have better fuel quality than diesel [5,6]. However, several issues with biodiesel growing an increasing interest to improve or modify biodiesel and it blends to improve overall engine performance. Biofuels, such as bio-alcohol, can play a vital role as a compliment of biodiesel–diesel blends. Alcohol fuels enrich oxygen content, as well as improve both the premixed and diffusive combustion stage. However, the utilization of these fuels as pure diesel engine fuel is restricted because of their lower heating value (LHV), lower cetane number (CN), miscibility and stability issues, and improper lubricating behavior [7]. Meanwhile, utilization of alcohols as a blending component with biodiesel blends is a potential method to solve biodiesel-related problems [8], which has been studied widely for lower carbon alcohols, such as ethanol and methanol [9–11]. However, the LHV and lower cetane index of these alcohols leads to increased ignition delay resulting in inefficient combustion. Moreover, these alcohols always create problems during engine operation. By contrast, higher alcohols, such as four-carbon butanol and five-carbon pentanol, have higher energy density, higher LHV, higher CN, better blend stability, less hygroscopic nature, and better miscibility, as well as can be utilized as blending component in diesel–biodiesel blends to improve low-temperature fluidity of biodiesel [1,8]. Pentanol and n-butanol are long chain alcohols with five carbons and four carbons respectively in their molecular structure; these alcohols have greater potential as a blending component with diesel fuel as well as biodiesel blends [8,11]. Numerous investigations used n-butanol as higher alcohol in biodiesel blends. Introducing n-butanol to the blends increases nitrogen oxide (NO X ) formations, while drastically decreasing the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions [12]. Moreover, particulate mass and elemental carbon concentrations, total number of particles, total particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission, carcinogenic potential, and cytotoxicity of particle extracts decrease with the addition of butanol compared with 20% blends of biodiesel with diesel. Meanwhile, the proportion of organic carbon (OC) in the particles increases with increasing butanol in the ternary fuel [13]. About 10% butanol in blended fuel is more beneficial than 5% butanol in reducing soot emission [14]. Imtenan et al. [15] studied the emission characteristics of diesel engine using 5–10% of n-butanol in diesel–jatropha biodiesel blends. Their team reported that HC emission increases with n-butanol addition in the blends, whereas both 5% and 10% n-butanol blended fuels reduce CO and smoke emission [16,17]. Utilization of n-butanol in palm biodiesel–diesel blends increases the brake power (BP) to 6%, decreases the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and increases brake thermal efficiency (BTE) compared with P20 [18,19]. Rakopoulos [20] used 20% n-butanol with cottonseed biodiesel blends and found decreased NO X , CO, and smoke emission of the blends. Yilmaz et al. [21] demonstrated that NO X emission from butanol blended fuels is increased than diesel, but as the butanol proportion in the blends increases, NO X emission decreases. They also reported that HC emission is higher for all the loads, but adding 20% butanol reduces HC emission [22]. Similar to n-butanol, adding 5-carbon pentanol in diesel–biodiesel blends diminishes soot emissions. At low and medium loads, emissions of NO X are reduced accordingly. Moreover, diesel engine fueled with oxygenated fuel blends can reduce CO and unburnt total HC emissions at low engine load [1]. Wei et al. [23] reported that adding 30% n-pentanol to diesel fuel enhances HC and CO emissions during low load, whereas increased load reduces emissions [19]. However, a slight increment (max. 8%) in NO X emissions and remarkable increment in NO2 emissions were observed. Particulate emissions decrease mass density and particulate concentration at the same time. The lower density and viscosity of alcohol treated blends increase atomization efficiency, and higher oxygen content promotes more complete combustion of fuels, hence reducing HC and CO emissions [24,25]. Higher oxygen content of biodiesel and alcohols provides oxygen in the fuel-rich zones and reduces smoke opacity. The addition of fuel-bound O2 in the blends ensures CO oxidation even in locally fuel-rich zones, thus helping reduce CO emissions [1]. The presence of a larger amount of O2 in the modified blends is the most reasonable justification for the high NO formation. A large amount of O2 proportion along with delayed combustion causes high flame temperature and expanded NO emission for CI 20 [24,26]. Lower cooling effects caused by the higher calorific value of higher alcohols is another reason for higher NO formation [24]. A higher BSFC was also observed with higher proportion of n-pentanol in the blends; however, the BTE is not affected [23]. Li et al. [1] studied the effects of adding pentanol in diesel–biodiesel blends to determine the combustion and emission performance of diesel engine. The team concluded that pentanol shows higher thermal efficiency [19] compared with mineral diesel under 0.5–1.0MPa IMEP within all test conditions. This result is attributed to higher maximum heat release rate and shorter combustion duration. Moreover, an evident decrease in soot emissions was attained with pentanol addition. NO X emissions are also simultaneously reduced compared with using pure diesel fuel at low to middle loads. Furthermore, diesel engine fueled with oxygenated fuel blends can reduce CO and unburnt total HC emissions except for the diesel–pentanol blends at low engine load. Addition of pentanol to diesel fuel reduces ISFC because of retarded injection timing given by the pentanol blended fuel [19]. Campos-Fernández et al. [27] used 10–25% pentanol in diesel fuel to evaluate the performance of diesel engine. They reported improved BTE of the blended fuel, but the power and torque are comparable to diesel fuel. With regard to BSFC, pentanol blends slightly exhibit better behavior than neat diesel fuel [7]. The comparatively lower BSFC of the modified fuel blends than CI 20 is attributed to the improved ignition quality caused by the large amount of O2, as well as the low viscosity and low density of the test blends [26]. The increase in BTE is attributed to the expanded accessibility of fuel-bound O2 content in the blend fuels and better atomization; this phenomenon increases the BP [28] and improves ignition quality [27] by reducing heat losses with decreasing temperatures at the beginning of combustion [29]. Growing interest on bio-alcohol and biodiesel blends has increased to develop alternative techniques. More investigations are necessary to realize the effect of adding higher alcohols on the overall engine performance. Investigation of pentanol–biodiesel and n-butanol–biodiesel fuels in CI engines is limited in literature. Studies on biodiesel–pentanol–diesel and biodiesel–n-butanol–diesel are also relatively low, and more investigations are necessary to understand the behavior of compression ignited engines, fueled with combinations of these fuels. The problems of biodiesel fuel can be mitigated by the superior fuel quality of higher alcohols. Although few studies are available on higher alcohols, comparative analysis of higher alcohols can elucidate their effectiveness. In this consideration, the present study compared the performance and emissions of diesel engine using n-butanol and pentanol as compliments of diesel–biodiesel blends."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biodiesel production and sample preparation,"2.1 Biodiesel production and sample preparation Petroleum diesel fuel and feedstocks of Alexandrian laurel (AL) oil were purchased from the Forest Research Institute, Malaysia. Biodiesel was made from unrefined vegetable oil through transesterification. n-Butanol and pentanol were obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan. Biodiesel was produced via acid-catalyzed esterification, alkali-catalyzed transesterification, and post-treatment. Crude AL oil had a high free fatty acid content of 20%, i.e., acid value of 40mgKOH/g. If oil contains more than 1% FFA, which corresponds to an acid value of 2mgKOH/g, then alkaline-catalyzed transesterification reaction cannot proceed. In addition, if the FFA level exceeds this amount, the soap formation inhibits ester separation from glycerin and decreases ester conversion rate [30]. However, if the acid value of oil is less than 4, then transesterification can take place [31]. In this study, biodiesel conversion transesterification was not possible by using a one-step alkaline; pretreatment was required because the free fatty acid content was extremely high. The procedure and steps for biodiesel production were similar to those described by Fattah et al. [32]. The following six fuel blends were prepared: (a) 15% biodiesel+85% diesel (AL15), (b) 15% biodiesel+15% n-butanol+70% diesel (AL15B15), (c) 15% biodiesel+15% pentanol+70% diesel (AL15P15), (d) 20% biodiesel+80% diesel (AL20), (e) 20% biodiesel+20% n-butanol+60% diesel (AL20B20), and (f) 20% biodiesel+20% pentanol+60% diesel (AL20P20). Results were compared with neat diesel and biodiesel with and without alcohols. 2.1.1 Fuel characterization Biodiesel production and its characterization were performed in the Engine Tribology Lab of the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Malaya. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesel and their blends were examined in accordance with ASTM 6751 and EN 14214 standard methods. Table 1 lists the equipment used for the measurement of properties in this experiment and Table 2 illustrates the measured fuel properties of various fuel blends with and without higher alcohols. Cetane number (CN), saponification number, and iodine value were calculated using the equations below [18], where Ai is the proportion of each component, D is the number of double bonds, and MWi is the mass of each component. (1) SN = ∑ 560 × Ai MWi (2) IV = ∑ 254 × D × Ai MWi (3) CN = 46.3 + 5458 SN - ( 0.225 × IV ) 2.1.2 Fatty acid composition (FAC) A gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890 Series, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector was employed to determine the fatty acid components of biodiesel. Table 3 presents the set-up conditions during the test, and Table 4 lists the FAC content of biodiesel. Total ester and methyl linolenate contents were measured using EN14103 standard, and mono-glyceride, di-glyceride, triglyceride, and free and total glycerin contents were assessed using EN14103 standard."
3,Engine testing and facilities,"2.2 Engine testing and facilities The experiment was conducted in the Heat Engine Laboratory of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Malaya. In this work, a single cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, naturally aspirated-direct injection diesel engine was employed. The main engine specifications are listed in Table 5 . An eddy current dynamometer was connected to the engine to adjust and measure the engine speed. A K-type thermocouple was employed to assess the temperature of lubricating oil, cooling water, exhaust gas, and inlet air. A Kobold ZOD positive-displacement type flow meter was used to monitor the flow of fuel. The engine fuel system was adjusted by including two individual tanks with two-way valves for diesel and biodiesel blends, which facilitated fast fuel exchange. The performance data were collected from a Dynomax 2000 data-acquisition system, which was monitored with the help of Dynomax 2000 software. CO, CO2, HC, and NO emissions were measured with BOSCH BAE-150 exhaust gas analyzer."
4,Test methodology,"2.3 Test methodology The engine was run with 100% throttle opening at different speeds that ranged from 1200 to 2400rpm with an interval of 300rpm. The temperature of lubricating oil in the engine was checked and maintained within 85–90°C. To ensure safety, water level in the cooling systems was also checked. The engine was first run with neat diesel until it reached stabilization. Data were then recorded into the data acquisition system for various operating conditions. Afterward, alcohol treated biodiesel blends were poured into the tank, and tests were run in a similar procedure. A test run was performed for about 10min to ensure that the blended fuel entered into the engine and purge out the diesel fuel from the fuel line. All data for each tested fuel were recorded after the engine approached stabilization at a given operating condition. After completion of each test, the engine was run for a few minutes to ensure that the remaining fuel in the fuel system has drained out, and then the next test fuel was poured into the vessel."
5,Error analysis,"2.4 Error analysis Measurement accuracy and uncertainty analysis of equipment used as well as obtained values are important facts for every test. As the engine operates under different conditions and calibrated instruments, uncertainty was analyzed throughout the entire study by repeating the tests and using linearized approximation method of uncertainty [34]. To perform precision measurement, data were taken at least three times and averaged to create a graph plot. Table 6 summarizes the values of the measurement accuracy and relative uncertainty of various parameters, including BP, BSFC, CO, HC, NO, and CO2 emissions."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Engine performance evaluation,"3.1 Engine performance evaluation 3.1.1 Brake specific fuel consumption Fig. 1 illustrates the BSFC variation as a function of speed for various test fuels. AL15 and AL20 biodiesel blends showed higher BSFC than diesel. Increase in fuel consumption for biodiesel blends is attributed to the volumetric effect of the constant fuel injection rate along with high viscosity and low calorific value [35]. However, alcohol blended modified test fuels reduced the rate of fuel consumption, and the reduction rate increased with increasing proportion of both alcohols at each speed. The four modified blends (AL15P15, AL15B15, AL20P20, and AL20B20) exhibited better BSFC over diesel–biodiesel blends. The reductions of BSFC were 4.55% and 2.2% for AL15P15 and AL15B15, respectively, compared with AL15 biodiesel blend, and 6.52% and 10.87% for AL20P20 and AL20B20, respectively, compared with AL20 biodiesel blend. C5 alcohol showed preferred BSFC than C4 alcohol within the fuel blends. C5 pentanol exhibited 6.5% and 4.35% less BSFC than C4 n-butanol for blending of 15% and 20% with diesel–biodiesel blends, respectively. Biodiesel and its modified blends acquire relatively lower energy content, which leads to higher BSFC than diesel [36]. Given the lower calorific value per unit mass of the blends, fuel expense should be higher. The comparatively lower BSFC of the modified fuel blends than biodiesel blends is attributed to the improved ignition quality because of the presence of larger amount of oxygen, low viscosity, and density of the test blends [37]. Moreover, pentanol blended fuel shows retarded injection timing, which is also attributed to lower BSFC [19]. Biodiesel blends obtained lower viscosity and density than the modified test blends, which results in the adhesion of fuel into the cylinder wall because of the occurrence of higher splash entrance caused by inappropriate atomization. In this way, these outcomes most likely demonstrate change of atomization of the modified blends. 3.1.2 Brake power The variation of BP with respect to engine speed is shown in Fig. 2 . In all engine speeds, biodiesel blends fuel (AL15 and AL20) exhibited lower BP than diesel, while the BP values were increased as alcohol was added to the biodiesel blends at each of the engine speed. In terms of alcohol performance, C5 pentanol showed 4.2% and 4.4% higher BP than C4 n-butanol for blending of 15% and 20% with diesel–biodiesel blends, respectively. The maximum power was found at 2100rpm of 7.55kW for ALP20P20, which is 12.77% higher compared with AL20. Because of the higher density and viscosity of biodiesel, proper atomization at higher speed is hindered; by contrast, alcohols decrease the density and viscosity of the blends, and their evaporative nature permits good atomization even at higher speed [37]. This condition may be the reason for the shift of maximum power at 2100rpm for all the fuel blends. On the contrary, pentanol blends substantially increased the maximum power for each of the modified blends. The higher power of the pentanol blends can be attributed to their lower density and viscosity. As pentanol and n-butanol contain higher oxygen in their atomic structure, higher oxygen content and good atomization, as well as lower density and viscosity, contribute to higher combustion efficiency, which results in high power [28,38,39]."
8,Engine emission evaluation,"3.2 Engine emission evaluation 3.2.1 Nitric oxide emission Formation of NO into the engine cylinder is controlled by in-cylinder temperature, oxygen proportion, air–fuel ratio, and remaining time into the cylinder. Moreover, NO formation is also governed by few mechanisms including thermal, N2O pathway, NNH, and fuel bound nitrogen [32]. Fig. 3 shows that NO formation increased with increasing speed for all the test blends, and the modified blends showed higher NO emission than diesel and biodiesel blends. More oxygen molecules exist in the chemical chains of pentanol, n-butanol, and AL biodiesel, which are attributed to the large amount of NO formation [17]. Moreover, higher atomic weight species combust in delayed combustion stages because of lower atomization at the beginning of controlled combustion. Subsequently, larger amount of oxygen proportion along with delayed combustion produces higher temperature and expanded NO emission for the test blends [32,40]. Addition of alcohols to AL biodiesel–diesel blends also decreased the CN of the blends and resulted in higher NO emission [41]. Fig. 3 demonstrates that AL15P15 and AL15B15 exhibited 13.2% and 16.8% higher NO emission than AL15 biodiesel blends, but AL20P20 and AL20B20 showed 7% and 10.5% higher NO emission than AL20 biodiesel blends, respectively. Results revealed that AL15P15 showed the lowest NO emission among the modified test fuels. The viscosity and density of C4 and C5 alcohols were lower with higher volatility, which enhanced the controlled combustion for the blends and thus achieved higher exhaust emission of NO. However, for the same proportion (15 and 20vol.%), pentanol blended fuels showed lower NO emission than n-butanol blended fuels (3% and 3.5%, respectively). The injection period for ternary blends would be longer during the ignition delay because the CNs of ternary blends are lower than the diesel fuel. Longer ignition delay results in more abruptly burned fuel during premixed combustion; this phenomenon elevates pressures and temperatures during diffusion combustion that in turn affect NO X emissions. The diesel engines are also equipped with a pump line nozzle type of fuel injection, which prevents inadvertent advanced injection caused by the high bulk modulus and viscosity of biodiesel, thereby increasing combustion temperature and thermal NO X [42,43]. 3.2.2 Carbon monoxide emission CO can be produced into the engine cylinder when charge combusts with insufficient air flow and low flame temperature [32]. However, formation of CO generally occurs at rich air–fuel mixture regions as a result of O2 inaccessibility to totally oxidize all CO proportion in the fuel. Fig. 4 demonstrates the variations of CO emissions of diesel fuel and ternary blends with respect to various engine speeds. The CO emission for all the test blends decreased with increasing speed and increasing alcohol proportion. Results showed an increased pattern of 33.1% and 18.5% for AL15P15 and AL15B15 compared with AL15, and 33.8% and 21.5% for AL20P20 and AL20B20, respectively, compared with AL20. Moreover, C5 pentanol showed even 13.9% less CO emission than C4 n-butanol on average. Biodiesel acquires moderately low carbon to hydrogen ratio (C/H) than diesel, which promotes the reduction procedure [44]. Moreover, because of the lower density of C5 and C4 alcohols compared with diesel, they evaporates easily inside the cylinder. Thus, the length of splash entrance becomes smaller. This effect helps the blending process and decreases CO discharge [45]. The modified blends with higher ratio of C5 and C4 alcohol contents improve the fuel air mixing procedure, particularly in the fuel-rich region of the combustion chamber by providing more oxygen. Mixing alcohols with diesel fuel affects the ternary blends because of the lower stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of the alcohols, thus lowering CO emissions. Additional fuel-bound oxygen in the blends ensures CO oxidation even in locally fuel-rich zones, which helps to reduce CO emission [1]. Different CO emission levels among the blends with additives may also be due to the physicochemical properties of the alcohols and other additives. 3.2.3 Carbon dioxide emission Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an ordinary end-combustion product of each fuel that contains carbon (biomass, wood, coal and its variations, oil, and petroleum and its subordinates) [46]. When adequate oxygen is available, hydroxyl radical OH is one of the principal oxidizing agents that converts CO into CO2 [47]. Fig. 5 shows the variation of CO2 as a function of engine speed. A drastic increment of 19.6% CO2 emission for biodiesel was observed compared with diesel because the oxygen content in biodiesel reacts with unburned carbon atoms during combustion and increases CO2 formation. More amount of CO2 and lower amount of CO (Fig. 4) in exhaust emission indicate complete fuel combustion [48]. However, the modified ternary blends also showed a significant increment of CO2 values than diesel, whereas a moderate decrease was found at maximum speed. AL15P15 and AL15B15 showed 15.6% and 19.9% increment of CO2, respectively, compared with AL15 biodiesel blends, and AL20P20 and AL20B20 exhibited 7% and 8.85% increment, respectively, compared with AL20 biodiesel blends. Moreover, at maximum engine speed of 2400rpm, CO2 was reduced within 7.4–11.76% for each tested blends compared with that at 2100rpm engine speed. In this case, C5 alcohol treated blends showed 4.3% and 1.85% reduced values of CO2 compared with C4 alcohol treated blends. When the chemical structures of the test fuels are considered, pentanol has the lowest carbon atoms per unit volume. During combustion, peroxyl and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) radicals are formed successively, which are further converted into hydroxyl radicals (OH) by absorbing heat from the combustion chamber. These OH radicals are mostly responsible for the conversion of CO into CO2. Thus alcohols increased the concentration of peroxyl and hydrogen peroxide radicals, which influenced the CO conversion process greatly. 3.2.4 Hydrocarbon emission The two main reasons behind the formation of HC in diesel engine are as follows. First, fuel blends prefer leaner than the lean combustion limit during delay period. Second, lower blending of fuel results in late fuel injection during combustion at low velocity. The comparison of HC emissions for different tested fuels with respect to engine speeds is shown in Fig. 6 . A decreasing trend of HC emission was observed for all the test blends at each engine speed. Fig. 6 clearly exhibits that the increasing presence of alcohols in ternary blends has a considerably decreasing effect on formation of HC emissions. This result indicates that the test engine emitted more HC at lower engine speeds. Air swirling velocity is extremely slow at lower engine speed, which causes long ignition delay. Slow mixing of ternary blends with air results in an over rich mixture or quenching of the combustion reaction; this can result in incomplete product combustion and higher presence of HC in the exhaust gases [49]. However, both AL20B20 and AL20P20 showed a decrement of 67.7% HC compared with AL15 and AL20, and AL15P15 and AL15B15 blends exhibited a reduction of 56.25% and 50%, respectively, compared with AL15. For the same proportion of alcohols, C5 treated blends showed 6.25% less emission than C4 treated blends with respect to each speed, whereas AL20B20 showed less HC emission than AL15P15. This finding is expected because of the greater amount of oxygen molecules that participate in the combustion of the modified blends resulting in lower HC emissions [50]. Droplet diameter of the fuel spray plays a key role in heat-up, evaporation, and ignition in burning chamber [51]. Increasing droplet diameter leads to a decrease in evaporation rate and an increase in ignition delay as well as HC formation."
9,Conclusions,"Pentanol and n-butanol are promising alternative biofuels that show improved engine performance and emission when blended with biodiesel without any engine modification. The engine performance and emission of a single cylinder DI diesel engine were investigated using different proportions of five-carbon pentanol and four-carbon n-butanol in diesel–biodiesel blended fuel with full throttle opening and varying speed conditions. The results were compared with AL15 and AL20 biodiesel blends and between the two specified alcohols as well as the modified blends themselves. Findings of the experiments demonstrated the following: • The modified blends of n-butanol and pentanol reduced BSFC for both C5 and C4 blended fuel compared with AL15 and AL20 biodiesel blends. However, C5 pentanol showed less BSFC than C4 n-butanol. In addition, the BP of the engine increased remarkably by treating the blends with alcohols, and C5 alcohol obtained higher BP than C4 alcohol treated biodiesel blends. • NO and CO2 emission increased for both alcohols; however, for the same proportion of alcohols, pentanol blended fuels showed lower emissions than n-butanol blended tested fuels. The CO and HC emissions of the engine significantly reduced compared with the diesel and biodiesel blends. C5 pentanol showed less exhaust emissions than C4 n-butanol when blended with AL15 and AL20 biodiesel blends."
