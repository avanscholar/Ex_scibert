0,Introduction,"The production of hydrogen from renewable sources using sunlight under ambient conditions has emerged as one of the most interesting routes for sustainable energy scenarios [1–3]. In addition to use a highly efficient and photoactive material, it is necessary to guarantee both mass transfer and photon delivery in the photoreactor to improve the efficiency of the process. No matter how good a photocatalyst is, if a proper mass and photon transfer to the photocatalyst is not attained in the photoreactor, the overall hydrogen yield will be strongly limited. Whereas there is an impressive number of works in recent years related to the design of photocatalysts [4–9], less attention has been paid to the proper design of photocatalytic devices [10–13]. Photoreactors are usually based on slurry systems, where the solid photocatalyst is dispersed within a liquid reactant. Slurry photoreactors provide excellent mass transfer, as well as high amount of catalyst exposed to reactants. Their main limitation, however, is the low penetration of light for opaque solutions, that is, with large quantities of photocatalyst, which limits the efficiency of the process [14]. In the last few years new ideas have come up for designing photoreactors to simultaneously facilitate both mass transfer and photon delivery aimed at producing hydrogen. For instance, Taboada et al. introduced optical fibers inside the channels of a cordierite monolith coated with a photocatalyst and substantially increased the photoproduction rate of hydrogen with respect to a conventional slurry photoreator [15]. More recently, Castedo et al. manufactured silicone photoreactors using 3D-printing techniques and tested them in the photogeneration of hydrogen using UV light and under direct exposure to sunlight [16,17]. Decreasing the distance between the photon source and the photocatalyst is a common strategy to increase efficiency [18]. Also, the immobilization of the photocatalyst on a solid surface has been attempted as a possible solution to the light opacity limitation occurring in slurry photoreactors (as well as a facile separation of the photocatalyst from the reaction media), although this can aggravate mass transfer [19]. Sans et al. coated the grooves of a commercial compact disk (CD) with a photocatalyst by an electrophoretic method and Serafin et al. coated macroporous silicon structures; both of them demonstrated extraordinary hydrogen photoproduction rates on a volume basis [20,21]. Due to size reduction, microreactor channels offer high surface-to-volume ratios and very small residence times, as well as effective photon transfer and short diffusion ratios. As a result, both mass transfer and photon delivery are signiﬁcantly enhanced and reaction parameters can be better controlled, with a fast response to operational changes [22]. In addition, microreactors provide economical beneﬁts. It is widely common that feasible and successful processes at a laboratory scale end up failing at industrial level. Microreactors allow the scale-up of applications by simply increasing the number of microreactors, each considered the unit cell. The combination of several devices in parallel deﬁnitely avoids the risks and high capital costs of scaling from laboratory to production plant, while eradicating demanding pilot plant experiments. In this work, we profit from the benefits of microreaction technology and have studied the use of a quartz microreactor for the photogeneration of hydrogen from water-ethanol in a discrete liquid-gas regime, that is, alternating the liquid mixture with Ar bubbles to facilitate the transfer of hydrogen from liquid to carrier gas. Our main purpose is to compare the performance using two different approaches (Fig. 1 ): (i) Slurry configuration, where the photocatalyst (Au/TiO2 powder) is dispersed in a solution mixture containing water and ethanol, which flows through the microchannels, where the reaction takes place; and (ii) Catalytic coating configuration, where the walls of the microchannels are coated with the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, therefore immobilizing it. In the second configuration there is no risk of blockage due to the agglomeration of catalytic material and no need to separate/recover the photocatalyst at the outlet of the microreactor, but photon delivery and catalyst loading may be a problem. Which is the best approach? The aim of this work is to compare the differences in terms of hydrogen yield between both strategies."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation Preformed Au nanoparticles encapsulated with dodecanethiol monolayer shells and suspended in toluene (7.88 mgAu mL−1) were used to decorate commercial Aeroxide® TiO2 P90 nanoparticles (Evonik Industries; average particle size 14 nm, speciﬁc surface area 90 ± 20 m2 g−1, anatase:rutile∼80:20 by weight) by incipient wetness impregnation. The Au loading determined by ICP analysis was 0.91 wt% with respect to TiO2. The preformed Au nanoparticles were synthesized according to a modified two-phase Brust method following previous studies [23,24]. The resulting photocatalyst was calcined at 673 K (2 K min−1) for 2 h. This treatment eliminated the dodecanethiol shells and assured a strong contact between Au and the TiO2 support, as reported previously [25], without altering the ratio of TiO2 polymorphs [26]."
3,Coating of the microchannels,"2.2 Coating of the microchannels The microreactor used was purchased from Invenios Europe GmbH. It contained 28 microchannels carved in the surface of a quartz plate; each one presented a length of 10.5 cm and a square transversal section with a width and height of 500 μm. This yields a surface-to-volume ratio of 6000 m2 m−3. To study the photocatalytic performance of the microreactor in the catalytic coating configuration it was necessary to immobilize the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst on the walls of the microchannels. According to a previous work, where the inﬂuence of the Au/TiO2 loading on H2 production on structured reactors was analyzed [15], a coating of 0.5 mg cm-2 was selected (7.4 mg). A sonicated suspension (40 kHz, 30 min) of Au/TiO2 (10 mg mL-1) in ethanol was deposited in each channel with a microsyringe (total volume of 1 mL) and the plate was dried and calcined at 673 K (2 K min-1) for 2 h. The microreactor was sealed with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cover, which absorbed a negligible percentage of incident UV radiation, by means of an oxygen plasma treatment (BD-20AC from Electro-Technic Products Inc.) [27]. The same procedure was used to seal the microreactor in order to study the photocatalytic performance of the slurry configuration without the photocatalytic coating."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Microstructural characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV in a JEOL 2010 F instrument equipped with a field emission source. The point-to-point resolution was 0.19 nm and the resolution between lines was 0.14 nm. Samples were dispersed in alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, and a drop of supernatant suspension was poured onto a holey carbon-coated grid. More than 150 individual particles were used for particle size determination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 mA, 40 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a SPECS system equipped with an Al anode XR50 source operating at 150 W and a Phoibos MCD-9 detector. The pass energy of the hemispherical analyzer was set at 25 eV and the energy step was set at 0.1 eV. Data processing was performed with the CasaXPS program (Casa Software Ltd., UK). Atomic fractions were calculated using peak areas normalized on the basis of acquisition parameters after background subtraction, experimental sensitivity factors and transmission factors provided by the manufacturer. UV–vis reflectance spectroscopy was performed on a Shimadzu UV3600 UV–vis/NIR apparatus equipped with a diffuse reflectance cell and BaSO4 as reference standard. The metal content of the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3200RL instrument. Adherence tests were performed in an ultrasound bath (40 kHz) filled with water."
5,Photocatalytic tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic tests The setup used for the photocatalytic tests is shown in Fig. 2 . A mass ﬂow controller (MassStream from M + W Instruments) was used to provide an Ar ﬂow, which was mixed in a T piece with the water-ethanol (PanReac Applichem) mixture provided by a syringe pump (GenieTouchTM from Kent Scientific Corporation). In this way, a discrete liquid-gas regime alternating the liquid of the mixture with Ar bubbles to facilitate hydrogen transfer from liquid to carrier gas was obtained. An UV source (Cetoni GmbH) containing 96 LEDs emitting at a wavelength of 365 nm was used to illuminate the microreactor. The illumination power of the LED array could be tuned from 0 to 100 %, which corresponded to an irradiance in the range from 0 to 3.86 mW cm−2 at the position of the microchannels, as measured with an UVA sensor (PMA 2110 from Solar Light Co.), which registered the UV radiation within a spectral response of 320−400 nm, connected to a radiometer (PMA2200 from Solar Light Co.). It is worth to comment that solar UV radiation corresponds to approximately 4 mW cm−2. At the outlet of the microreactor, a separator was placed and the gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 490) using MS 5 Å, Plot U and Stabilwax columns for a complete analysis of the photoreaction products, which were monitored on-line every 4 min. The error bars in the figures correspond to deviations in the GC analyses. When no error bars are shown, it means that the data fit inside the symbols in the graphs. The only reaction products detected were hydrogen and acetaldehyde in a stoichiometric proportion and no other byproducts were detected, hence the overall reaction was the dehydrogenation of ethanol into acetaldehyde and hydrogen, in accordance with previous studies [4]. The evaluation parameters were the H2 production rate (μmol min−1), the photoactivity referred to the amount of Au/TiO2 photocatalyst (μmol min-1 g−1), the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE), and the light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency. The apparent quantum efficiency was calculated from the ratio of the double amount of H2 (rH2), assuming that two photons are required for producing one hydrogen molecule, and the overall amount of photons reaching the microreactor (Nλ) using the equation AQE=(2·rH2/Nλ)·100 [28,29]. The efficiency of light-to-chemical energy conversion is defined as the energy stored as hydrogen (rH2·ΔHc,H2, where ΔHc,H2 is the heating value of hydrogen, 285.8 kJ mol−1) divided by the incident photon energy."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The preformed Au nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3 a corresponds to a low magnification, bright field TEM image. The mean particle size of Au was calculated to be 2.2 ± 0.5 nm, which is in accordance with previous results [25]. Fig. 3b corresponds to a high resolution TEM image. Several particles oriented along the [110] crystallographic direction (parallel to the electron beam) are indicated, as well as lattice fringes of metallic gold at 2.35 ± 0.02 Å, which correspond well to the (111) crystallographic planes. After impregnation on TiO2 and calcination, the sample was mapped by high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF-STEM) and analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fig. 3c shows a representative HAADF-STEM image, where TiO2 particles of about 8−12 nm offer low electron contrast and Au nanoparticles appear as bright dots given their higher Z number. The Au nanoparticles are well dispersed and measure ca. 2.5 ± 0.5 nm. Fig. 3d shows an EDX spectrum corresponding to the area marked in Fig. 3c. The presence of Au, Ti and O signals confirms the identification of the bright dots as Au (the Cu signals originate from the TEM grid). The Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was further investigated by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 4 a), where an absorption band centered at about 518 nm was observed due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au nanoparticles. The position and width of the band correspond well to the presence of 2–3 nanometer-sized Au nanoparticles [30,31]. Fig. 4b shows the XRD pattern of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. As expected, the diffraction peaks correspond to the anatase and rutile polymorphs with an approximate ratio anatase:rutile∼73:27, and the average particle TiO2 size calculated using the Scherrer equation is 13 nm, in accordance to TEM results. The surface of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition to adventitious carbon, the only signals detected came from the TiO2 support and the Au nanoparticles. No S signals from the thiolate shells of the preformed Au nanoparticles were detected. This is important since organic fragments at the surface of titania photocatalysts can act either as a recombination electron-hole centers or as promoters in the photogeneration of hydrogen [32]. The Ti 2p region exhibited signals at 458.4 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.1 eV (Ti 2p1/2), characteristic of Ti4+ in the TiO2 structure (with a spin-orbit splitting of 5.7 eV). Fig. 4c shows the Au 4f region, with Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 signals at 83.6 and 87.2 eV, respectively, which correspond to the presence of metallic Au. The calculated Au/Ti atomic surface ratio is 0.4 %. By using calibrated standards in our laboratory this value corresponds to an Au content of ca. 0.84 wt%. The good correspondence with the Au loading obtained by ICP-OES (0.91 wt%) is in agreement with the small size of the Au nanoparticles present in the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, which are within the sampling depth of the XPS analysis. To conclude this part, the characterization of the Au nanoparticles and the resulting Au/TiO2 sample indicates that the photocatalyst was correctly prepared. Fig. 5 shows optical microscopy images of the quartz plates and microchannels before (a,b) and after (c,d) coating them with the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst following the methodology described in section 2.2 to study the photocatalytic performance of the catalytic coating configuration of the microreactor. A careful inspection allows to conclude that the photocatalyst was well distributed along the totality of the microchannels, though not in a perfect way. After mapping the totality of the quartz plate by optical microscopy it is concluded that ca. 10–12 % of the surface of the microchannels was not totally covered. In contrast, the adherence of the catalytic coating was remarkable, after exposure to 40 kHz for 30 min the photocatalyst loss was below 5 wt%."
8,Photocatalytic experiments,"3.2 Photocatalytic experiments 3.2.1 Slurry configuration Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen production rates obtained in the slurry configuration experiments. Different suspensions were tested containing different amounts of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst powder, ranging from 0.02 to 0.44 mg mL−1 (Fig. 6a). The experiments were conducted under two irradiances, 1.93 and 3.86 mW cm-2 (Fig. 6b). Clearly, the amount of photocatalyst mixed with the reactants had a strong effect on the photoproduction of hydrogen. For both irradiance values, the photoproduction rate of hydrogen increased sharply when increasing the amount of photocatalyst up to a value of 0.2 mg mL−1. For photocatalyst loadings higher than 0.2 mg mL−1 the hydrogen photoproduction progressively decreased, which could be explained in terms of particle agglomeration. Particle agglomeration can have a significant influence on light absorption by the photocatalyst and/or on light scattering, which both have a strong effect on photocatalytic activity. As expected, the higher the irradiance used the higher the photoproduction of hydrogen. These results can be adequately explained taking into account the availability of both photocatalyst and photons. At low loading values, the photocatalyst particles are fully illuminated and the amount of hydrogen photoproduced increases progressively as the amount of photocatalyst increases. However, at high loading values, the opacity of the suspension limits the transfer of photons and the photoproduction of hydrogen decreases accordingly. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) calculated for the optimum photocatalyst loading (0.2 mg mL−1) is 0.30−0.38% for irradiances of 3.86 and 1.93 mW cm-2, respectively. An additional experiment was carried out to compare the photocatalytic performance of the photoreactor with microchannels with respect to a single-volume conventional photoreactor. A photocatalyst loading of 0.2 mg mL−1 was selected and an irradiance of 3.86 mW cm-2 was used for a proper comparison with the results reported above. The hydrogen photoproduction rate obtained with the conventional slurry photoreactor (no microchannels) was one order of magnitude lower than that of the channeled microreactor (0.002 vs. 0.032 μmol H2 min−1). This constitutes a clear proof of the importance of the surface-to-volume ratio of the photoreactor on the photoproduction of hydrogen. Clearly, the channeled microreactor is superior. For the same irradiance and photocatalyst loading, the higher the surface-to-volume ratio, the higher the photoproduction of hydrogen. 3.2.2 Catalytic coating configuration As already explained, the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst was immobilized on the walls of the microchannels in the catalytic coating configuration (0.5 mg cm−2). Different operational conditions were evaluated, namely the irradiance, flowrate of sweep gas (Ar), flowrate of water-ethanol and EtOH:H2O ratio. Fig. 7 shows the effect of photon irradiance on the photoproduction of hydrogen and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE). It is clear that the higher the irradiance the higher the photoproduction rate. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the rate constant (rH2) is found to be proportional to the light intensity (I) as rH2 = 0.039·I0.6. The rate equations used to describe photocatalytic reactions are usually based on simple power-law expressions of the type rH2=k·Iα, where k is the rate constant and α is an exponent between 0.5 and 1 that depends on the efficiency of the electron-hole formation and recombination processes. Since TiO2 is a n-type semiconductor, the photoproduced holes are much less numerous than electrons at low irradiance values, making hole formation the limiting step of the photoreaction and the reaction rate directly proportional to the light intensity. At high irradiance values, the concentrations of both electrons and holes are high and the rate of electron-hole pair formation becomes greater than the photocatalytic reaction rate, which favors electron-hole recombination, and the rate then becomes proportional to the square root of the light intensity. The value of the parameter α (0.6) is very similar to that obtained over Au/TiO2 photocatalysts tested in other photoreactors (0.65 ± 0.03 [16,17]). In contrast, there is an inverse trend in the power-law that relates irradiance values and AQE, being AQE values higher at low light intensity. This is a direct consequence of photon usage; as explained above, at low irradiance values the photoproduction rate of hydrogen is directly proportional to light intensity or, in other words, the electron-hole pairs generated upon illumination are readily involved in the redox processes leading to the formation of hydrogen. Under similar irradiation and in the absence of photon transfer limitation, the AQE of the microreactor for the catalytic coating configuration is ca. three times higher than that of the slurry configuration (0.8–1.2 % vs. 0.3−0.4%, respectively). In terms of photoactivity referred to the amount of the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, the comparison is similar, being 3.07 μmol H2 min-1 g-1 for the slurry configuration and 10.8 μmol H2 min-1 g-1 for the catalytic coating configuration under a light intensity of 3.86 mW cm−2, which represents a factor of ca. 3.5 times. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the performance of the catalytic coating configuration is clearly superior to that of the slurry configuration. For the catalytic coating configuration, the efficiency of light-to-chemical energy conversion obtained is 0.34 % at 3.86 mW cm−2. The influence of gas and liquid flowrates on the photoproduction of hydrogen and the effect of the EtOH:H2O ratio are shown in Fig. 8 . In the rage explored (15−20 mL min−1 Ar and 0.1−5 mL min−1 EtOH+H2O, which correspond to residence times of 2–2.8 s), there is no effect of these two operational parameters on the photoproduction rate of hydrogen (Fig. 8a and b, respectively). This is ascribed to the fact that the delivery of photons to the photocatalyst in the coated microchannels where the photoreaction takes place does not depend on the contact time and because no mass transfer limitations exists due to the low ethanol conversion achieved (less than 10-3 %). The effect of the EtOH:H2O ratio was studied from 1:99 to 50:50 (molar) under different irradiance values (Fig. 8c). The data fits well to a kinetic expression of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) type, rH2=k·Iα KcEtOH/(1 + K·cEtOH), with α = 0.6 for irradiance values of 3.86 and 1.93 mW cm−2 and α = 1 for 0.2 mW cm−2, as discussed previously (Fig. 7), an equilibrium pseudo constant K = 6.1 μmolEtOH -1 L, and an intrinsic kinetic constant k = 3.5 μmolH2 cm2α min-1 gcat -1 mW-α. The inset in Fig. 8c corresponds to the parity plot of the experimental and calculated hydrogen photoproduction rates, which shows a good correspondence. Kinetic expressions of the L-H type are common in TiO2-based photocatalyzed reactions [16,33]. Finally, the microreactor was tested with the catalytic coating configuration in a long-term photocatalytic run (Fig. 9 ). The hydrogen photoproduction rate was maintained stable."
9,Conclusions,"It is demonstrated that the photoproduction of hydrogen in microchannels is clearly higher when the photocatalyst is immobilized on the walls of the microchannels with respect to a microslurry configuration where the photocatalyst is dispersed in the reaction media. This is ascribed to the small dimensions of the microchannels, which assure a good balance between mass transfer and photon delivery. In contrast, severe photon transfer limitation exists in the microslurry configuration due to opacity of the mixture, which limits the hydrogen photoproduction rate. In terms of photoactivity referred to the amount of catalyst, the catalytic coating configuration yields ca. 3.5 times more hydrogen than the best slurry configuration (corresponding to a photocatalyst loading of 0.2 mg mL−1) under similar operational parameters. In addition, the catalytic coating configuration prevents from agglomeration of photocatalyst particles inside the microchannels and there is no need to recover the photocatalyst at the outlet of the microreactor. For the catalytic coating configuration, the rate constant (rH2) is proportional to the light intensity (I) as rH2=k·Iα with α = 0.6, and the data fits well to a kinetic expression of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type. Different operational parameters have been evaluated, being the EtOH:H2O ratio more influential than the sweep gas flowrate and the water-ethanol liquid flowrate. The microreactor shows a stable photoproduction of hydrogen in long-term runs."
