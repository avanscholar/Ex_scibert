0,Introduction,"Recently, pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) has attracted much attention as one of particle-preparation methods which is specially simple. According to the review by Yang [1], the mechanism is reported as follows. The laser-induced plasma is generated by the pulsed laser irradiation at the front of the target. The plasma plume in liquid is expanded due to both the absorption of further entering laser pulse and the plasma-induced pressure by the shock wave. Some chemical reactions take place inside the plasma and liquid, and also interface between the plasma and liquid. The plasma plume in liquid condenses into nanoparticles. Many researchers have reported preparation of many kinds of nanoparticles such as metals [2–5], alloys [6,7], and semiconductors [8]. Photocatalysts such as TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 have also been synthesized by PLAL [9–13]. Two types of targets are used for PLAL. One is a plate or a pellet, and another is powdered suspension. There are numerous applications for preparation of nanoparticles from plate type targets such as silver [2,3], titanium [9–11] and combination of platinum and titanium dioxide [12]. In the case of powdered suspension targets, fineness of particles [4,8,13], combination of two metals [6,7] and oxidation and reduction [5] have been reported. Therefore, it is expected that this method enhances catalytic reactions by fining catalysts and/or co-catalysts. In the previous papers, we have reported that powdered graphite silica (GS) enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production from methanol–water mixture on TiO2 by simply mixing GS as a co-catalyst [14,15]. GS is one of the natural minerals, whose main components are quarts, carbon and several kinds of clay. The enhancement effect is attributed to both the enrichment of hydrogen ions by the clay components in GS and the aggregation of GS and TiO2 particles. In this letter, we have applied PLAL to powdered GS to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production with TiO2. It was found that the amount of hydrogen gas was more increased by addition of the lased GS to TiO2 powder than by addition of raw GS. The improvement may be attributed to fining of GS by laser and the aggregation of TiO2 and lased GS."
1,Experimental,"The laser ablation for the suspension was conducted by using the second harmonics radiation (532nm) from a Nd:YAG pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics Co., GCR-130-10) with the pulse width of 7ns and a repetition rate of 10Hz. The laser power-fluence was kept at 0.16Jpulse−1 cm−2 and the ablation time was 1h. The powder of TiO2 (Degussa, P25) was used as a photocatalyst. The GS powder was obtained from Nishi-nihon Environmental Engineering Inc. Methanol (Wako) was of the highest grade available and was used as received. Doubly distilled water was used throughout the experiment. GS, TiO2 and a GS–TiO2 mixture were used as the powdered target. Ten milligram of each powdered target were suspended into 20cm3 of 50vol% methanol aqueous solution in a cylindrical tube (40cm3). The suspensions were stirred during the laser ablation. After the laser ablation, 10mg of TiO2 or GS powder was added to the lased suspension. The top of the cylindrical tube containing the suspension was sealed with a silicone rubber septum. Argon gas was bubbled into the suspension for 1h to remove oxygen gas in the suspension. The photoirradiation was carried out for 3h under Ar atmosphere of about 1atm with magnetic stirring. A super-high-pressure mercury lamp (Ushio, 500 W, USH-500SC) was used as a light source with an optical band pass filter (300–400nm, Asahi Techno Glass, UV-D33 S). The evolved gas was sampled through the silicone rubber septum by using a locking-type syringe at a constant time interval. The sampled gas was quantitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-8A, detector; thermal conductivity detector (TCD), column packing; molecular sieve 5Å, carrier gas; Ar). Before and after the laser ablation of GS suspension, the pH values and the specific surface area were measured using a pH meter (Horiba, D-51) and a nitrogen gas adsorption instrument (Flow Sorb II 2300, Micromeritics, Shimadzu) based on the BET method, respectively. The particle size of GS, TiO2 and mixture of GS and TiO2 in 50vol% aqueous methanol was measured using a laser-scattering particle size distribution analyzer (Horiba, LA-920) before and after laser ablation. The measurement was carried out using a batch cell with stirring. The images of catalyst powders were taken with a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4100)."
2,Results,"Fig. 1 A shows the time course of the amount of hydrogen gas evolved using various types of mixtures of GS and TiO2. The evolution rate of hydrogen gas for raw mixture of GS and TiO2 was 10μmolh−1. By the laser ablation of the mixture of TiO2 and GS, the rate was decreased to 6.6μmolh−1. As for the mixture of GS and lased-TiO2, the amount of evolved hydrogen gas was similar to that in the raw mixture. On the other hand, the amount of evolved H2 gas for the mixture of TiO2 and lased GS was two times as large as that of the raw mixture. It is clear from Fig. 1A that the initial rates of the hydrogen production are small. It is suggested that the initial hydrogen production was depressed because of the time lap for TiO2 and GS to take suitable conformation for the hydrogen production. The initial hydrogen production using the laser ablated mixture of TiO2 and GS was depressed most effectively. Although we cannot clearly explain the reason at present, the following explanation may be possible. The ablated carbon in GS (it contains carbon of about 5.8% [14–16]) may cover the TiO2 surface and, therefore, the additional time is needed for the desorption of carbon from the TiO2 surface and also for rearrangement of GS and TiO2 with suitable conformation. This may lead to the initial low activity for the hydrogen production. To estimate the rates of hydrogen production, the linear parts of the plots in Fig. 1A (after ca. 1.5h) were used for the calculation. The results are shown in Fig. 1B, from which it can be concluded that the laser ablation, especially that of GS alone is effective to enhance the activity of the hydrogen production. The pH value of 40cm3 of water containing 30mg of GS was measured before and after the laser ablation. An increment of ca. 0.3 in the pH value was observed after the laser ablation to GS. This pH increment suggests that the lased GS particles take in comparatively higher amount of hydrogen ions in water than raw GS. After the laser ablation for the 50mg of GS suspended in 5cm3 of water for 1h, the powder was dried and the specific surface area was measured. For comparison, the raw GS powder suspended and stirred for 1h was also studied. The surface areas of the raw GS and lased GS were 8.9m2 g−1 and 13.8m2 g−1, respectively. These results imply that the surface area of GS is increased by the laser ablation. Fig. 2 shows the particle size distribution of GS and/or TiO2 in 50vol% aqueous methanol. The size distribution of the mixture of lased GS and raw TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2E. Fig. 2A–C show the particle size distribution for mixture of GS and TiO2, GS alone and TiO2 alone, respectively. The solid and broken lines show the distribution before and after the laser ablation, respectively. Primary particles coexist with aggregates in the raw suspension (data not shown). The numeric summation of distribution for lased GS (a broken line in B) and raw TiO2 (a solid line in C) is shown in Fig. 2D. It is found that a peak of 3.4μm of the distribution shifts to that of 8.8μm as shown in Fig. 2E. From these results, it is considered that lased GS and raw TiO2 form the aggregates which have the size distribution similar to those of the raw mixture of GS and TiO2 as shown in a solid curve of Fig. 2A. The raw GS black powder in the solution sank down and the solution without stirring was clear. On the other hand, the lased solution without stirring was separated into two layers of the black sediment and the brown suspension. Fig. 3 shows the typical SEM images of several kinds of powder. Fig. 3A shows the GS suspension before the laser ablation. Fig. 3B and C shows the lased GS suspension. From these images, we can see that rougher surface particles coexist together with the fined particles in the lased GS suspension. The image of the mixture of lased GS and raw TiO2 is also shown in Fig. 3D. From this picture, we can see that the TiO2 powder is well distributed into the interstitial space of GS. TiO2 and GS aggregate in solution. The data of the particle size distribution indicate the particles aggregating in solution. Therefore, the measured particle sizes were larger than true ones. But in the SEM image, the particles were not aggregated due to drying the samples."
3,Discussion,"In the previous papers, we reported that powdered GS enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production from alcohol–water mixture by simply mixing with TiO2 [14–16]. The mechanism of the synergy effect between GS and TiO2 has been proposed as follows. The clay components in GS particles have the ability to elute several kinds of metal ions and exchange for hydrogen ions in the suspension. The ion-exchanged GS surface became more hydrophilic and hydrogen-ion-rich. The pH values of solution increase from ca. 6 to ca. 8 by adding GS. At pH values higher than 6.6, the –TiO− groups dominate on the hydroxylated TiO2 surface. The negatively charged TiO2 clamps together with GS. The hydrogen production is, therefore, increased by the photocatalytic reduction of hydrogen ions held in the clay in GS (see Scheme 2A). Scheme 1 shows a plausible model for the change of aggregation of GS particles by the laser ablation. Before the laser ablation, self-aggregates of GS powder coexist with primary particles. The laser ablation of the suspension resulted in the fine-subdivided GS particles and more hydrogen ions are taken in by GS. Though not all the particles were fined enough, the surface became rougher than raw GS. Taking all the results obtained into consideration, the mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen production is illustrated in Scheme 2 . By adding TiO2 to lased GS suspensions, both powders clump together and form aggregates peaked at about 8.8μm. It is considered that there are two types of TiO2–GS aggregates as depicted in Scheme 2B and C. Scheme 2B shows the aggregates between the fined-GS and TiO2 particles which are more complicated than the raw GS–TiO2 mixtures. TiO2 coheres to GS whose surface is roughened as illustrated in Scheme 2C. In both cases, the pH value of the GS suspension, the surface area of the GS particles and the interface area between GS and TiO2 are increased by the laser ablation. This leads us to conclude that the laser ablation for the GS powder results in the increase of both the reaction surface area and hence the photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, further detailed studies are needed to reveal the more detailed mechanism of the enhancement of hydrogen production and are in progress."
4,Conclusion,"We have found that the photocatalytic hydrogen production from methanol aqueous solution containing mixtures of TiO2 and GS is enhanced by the laser ablation in liquid. It was revealed that the lased mixtures of both GS and TiO2 decreased the H2 evolution rate as compared with that of the raw mixture. However, the addition of raw TiO2 to lased GS increased the amount of hydrogen gas twice as large as that in the raw mixture of GS and TiO2. The resultant interface area between lased GS and raw TiO2 is considered to be larger than that of the raw mixture of GS and TiO2. The improvement may be attributed to the combined effect of the fineness of GS particles, increase in the reaction surface area and the aggregation of lased GS and raw TiO2. In this communication, attention was paid to the aggregation and the size change of GS powder and the pH variation of the GS suspension."
