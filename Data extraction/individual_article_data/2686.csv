0,Introduction,"The development of self-healing polymers is highly desirable because its context of sustainability and long-term use. Self-healing polymers are able to heal physical or chemical damage and restore their mechanical properties [1–4]. Generally, extrinsic and intrinsic self-healing polymers have been developed. The former needs to pre-embed the healing agent firstly and the latter can repair damage by reversible physical or chemical interactions of the polymers itself [5–9]. For the extrinsic self-healing polymer, the damage can only be repaired once at the specific location, whereas the intrinsic self-healing polymer could heal itself multiple times. Therefore, intrinsic self-healing polymers have received extensive attention in the past decades [10–12]. The repair mechanism of most self-healing polymer is generally based on the reversible bond or movement of polymer segments. Polymer chain mobility is a key factor to facilitate self-healing. The polymer matrix will be healed only when polymer chains can diffuse along the destroyed interface [13–15]. Therefore, most of the present self-healing materials are soft and have low glass transition temperature (Tg) thanks to sufficient polymer chain mobility. However, a stiff self-healing polymer is needed as they can be used as strong material for building industry, aerospace engineering, and protective coatings. To solve this problem, Guan et al. reported a novel self-healing polymer containing the hard-soft microphase separated system, which could achieve the repair of damage and provides strength to the material [13]. Lai et al. reported a boroxine-containing polymer exhibiting simultaneously strong, stiff and water-assisted self-healing properties [15]. Liu and Chung reported a new functional polymer containing lignin, lignin-graft-poly(5-acetylaminopentyl acrylate) (lignin-graft-PAA), The polymer exhibited good self-healing properties and recovered to 93 % of the maximum tensile stress of the original sample after repair [16]. Aida’ group reported a mechanically, readily repairable glass with high density hydrogen bond via tailored noncovalent cross-linking [17]. Therefore, the systematic study of the application of such polymers in self-healing coatings is of great significance. Recently, UV-curable self-healing coatings have become an important research direction due to the advantages of environment-friendly, fast curing, high production efficiency and low energy consumption. Young et al. reported a series of UV-curable, self-healing, ladder-structured polysilsesquioxane inorganic-organic hybrid coatings [18]. The mechanical properties of self-healing coatings were improved and these coatings were able to show the smart recovery of robust bulk and nanoscale mechanical properties. Zhao et al. reported a series of UV-curable polyurethane coatings with different disulfide bond contents, and all coatings have good adhesion and flexibility before and after self-healing [19]. Liang’s group have reported a series of UV-curable self-healing coating based on Diels-Alder (DA) reactions [20–22]. DA reactions are distinct owing to their unique advantages, such as mild reaction conditions without the need for catalysts. Previously, we have reported a stiff self-healing coating based on UV-curable polyurethane with a“hard core, flexible arm” structure [23]. The coatings exhibited high hardness and excellent thermal stability. In order to improve the repair efficiency and mechanical properties of the coating, in this paper, we synthesized a novel UV-curable self-healing coating based on self-healing polyurethane (PU) oligomers and DA monomer. The self-healing coating contains a double crosslinked network system based on hydrogen bonding and D-A reaction. We hope to provide a new strategy for preparing self-healing coatings with good repair performance and excellent mechanical properties, thereby promoting the further development of related research."

The mixture was then placed in a three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and condenser, and it was stirred until complete dissolution. Next, 40 ml of THF containing HCTP (6.95 g, 0.02 mol) was added dropwise, and the resulting solution was stirred at 60 °C for 8 h. The crude product was obtained from extraction and filtration, and then distilled under reduced pressure. Finally, the residue was purified through a repeated precipitation method with ethyl alcohol. After filtration, the product was further purified by performing recrystallization using ethyl acetate, and hexakis (4-formylphenoxy) cyclotriphosphazene (HAPCP) was obtained. A 250-mL three-necked flask was fitted with a magnetic stirrer that had a thermometer and Dean-Stark apparatus. Subsequently, 4.7 wt % HAPCP (5.0 g, 5.8 mmol), phenol (19.6 g, 208.8 mmol), phosphotungstic acid (1.0 g, 0.35 mmol), thioglycolic acid (0.1 mL), and cyclohexane (80 mL) were placed in the flask. The mixture was heated to 100 °C, and the water produced during the reaction was separated through azeotropic distillation with cyclohexane. Azeotropic distillation was performed until no water emerged. Next, the volatile materials were removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was precipitated in a large amount of water. The resulting red solid was filtered and washed with chloroform before being dried in a vacuum at 40 °C for 48 h. Finally, the crude product was recrystallized using a 1/2 ratio of ethyl alcohol/water, and the yellow powder (H12) was collected and dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h. The synthesis route was shown in Fig. 1 ."
4,Preparation of UV-Cured self-healing PU(IPxH12),"2.3 Preparation of UV-Cured self-healing PU(IPxH12) 4.67 g (0.021 mol) isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and 0.3 wt% catalyst dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) were added to three necked flask equipped with mechanical stirring and reflux condensation tubes, dissolved in DMF, and stirred to 45℃. 0.01 mol Polycarbonate diols (PCDL) with molecular weights of 500, 1000, 2000 g/mol were dripped at a uniform rate.

After three hours of reaction, 1.56 g (0.83 mmol) dodecyl cyclotriphosphate (H12) was dissolved in DMF and dripped into the reaction flask. The temperature was raised to 70 ℃. The content of isocyanate in the reaction was determined by infrared spectroscopy. The product was self-healing UV-curable resin (IPxH12). As shown in the Fig. 2 , the first letter represents the type of isocyanate and X represents the molecular weight of PCDL, such as IP500H12."

Then, furfuryl alcohol (FA) (1.96 g, 20 mmol) was added to the flask. The reaction was stopped after 24 h at 60 ℃. The product was added to ether to stir and purify. After 24 h of drying in a vacuum oven, DA monomer was obtained. DA monomer (5.54 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in trichloromethane in a single flask, dripped with isocyanate methacrylate (IEM) (3.1 g, 20 mmol), 0.3 wt % butadiene dilaurate (DBTDL) and 0.1 wt% hydroquinone (HQ), stirred for five hours at 60℃.

The formulations are shown in Table 1 ."
7,Characterizations of samples,"2.6 Characterizations of samples A Thermo Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer was used to measure FTIR spectra of IPxH12 and I-DA. The wavenumber ranges from 500 to 4000 cm−1. 1H NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on AVANCE III HD 400 MHz from Bruker company with methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. The spectra of bismaleimide (BMI) and furfuryl alcohol (FA) were measured by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV–vis), and samples were scanned at room temperature with TU-1950 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer, with the scanning range of 200−450 nm. Gloss measurements were conducted using BYK-Gardner microTRI-gloss meter from BYK at a reflective angle of 60°. Pencil hardness was determined by pushing the pencil with different hardness on the surface of the coatings with moderate pressure and observing whether a scratch was made. Pendulum hardness of the coatings was measured using a Rocker hardness tester from BYK. A 10 × 10 grid was produced with a razor blade to test adhesion according to ASTM D3359. Self-healing properties were observed using an optical microscope (VHX-1000C) from the Keyence Company."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structural characterization of monomers and pre-polymers,"3.1 Structural characterization of monomers and pre-polymers The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig.4a, the chemical shift of 9.29 ppm was the characteristic peak of phenol hydroxyl (Ar−OH) and 5.23 ppm was the characteristic peak of benzene ring (Ar−CH), which proved the successful introduction of phenol groups. The characteristic peak of 6.67–6.84 ppm was the characteristic absorption peak of proton hydrogen on benzene ring. In Fig. 4b, the absorption peak of methyl carbon (Ar−CH) linked to benzene ring was 54.23 ppm. 155.6 ppm in phenolic hydroxyl bonded carbon (COH) and 150.0 ppm in CO spectrum, and the absorption peaks of benzene ring were 148.42 ppm (C) 134.85 ppm (CH), 130.26 ppm (CH), 120.72 ppm (CH), 115.52 ppm (CH). The results showed that the monomer H12 has been successfully synthesized. The 1H-NMR spectra of modified DA and IDA monomer are shown in Fig. 5 . Compared with the 1H-NMR spectra of DA monomers, the proton peaks of double bonds (−CH = CH-) at 5.7 ppm and 6.1 ppm, the proton peaks of carbamate (-NH−COO-) at 6.6 ppm, the proton peaks of methacrylic acid (−CH3) at 1.9 ppm, and methylene (−CH2-) at 3.3 ppm and 4.1 ppm. The results proved the successful grafting of acrylic double bond. The proton peaks of hydrogen on benzene ring are 7.2 ppm and 7.4 ppm, the double bond proton peaks on furan ring were 6.4 ppm and 6.6 ppm, the methylene proton peaks between benzene rings were 4.0 ppm, and the bond proton peaks between imide group and furan group were 1, 6 and 7, The 1H-NMR spectra proved the success of DA reaction. The FT-IR spectra of IDA monomer and spectra of FA and BMI with different reaction time are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the broad peak representing OH stretching vibration disappeared at 3555 cm−1 in BMI-FA spectra, at the same time, the stretching vibration peak of NH appeared at 3387 cm−1 in BMI-FA-IEM spectra, the bending vibration peak of NH appeared at 1520 cm−1, and the double bond-C = C-characteristic peak of methacrylic acid appeared at 1640 cm−1. It can be seen from Fig. 6b, the infrared characteristic peaks of furfuryl alcohol and bismaleimide at 1031 cm−1 and 1151 cm−1 gradually decreased, while the characteristic peaks of carbon-carbon double bond (-C = C-) and carbon-carbon single bond (-C-C-) in DA adducts at 1188 cm−1 and 1777 cm−1 gradually decreased. The results proved the successful grafting of acrylic double bond and the DA addition reaction. Fig. 7 is an ultraviolet spectrogram of furfuryl alcohol (FA) and bismaleimide (BMI) with different reaction time. A characteristic absorption peak [24] appeared at 310 nm in acetonitrile solution. This was due to the conjugation effect of ππ* (CC) and nπ* (CO) chromophores in the molecular structure of BMI. When d-A addition reaction was occurred between BMI and FA, the formation of d-A bond would destroy the conjugation effect. As can be seen from the Fig.7, with the increased reaction time, the characteristic absorption peak was gradually weakened, and the change of this absorption peak could be used to verify the success of the reaction. Fig. 8 is the 1H NMR spectra of resin IP500H12. It can be seen that the characteristic peaks of carbon-carbon double bond (CC) were observed at 5.7 ppm and 6.0 ppm, indicating that the photosensitive double bonds had been successfully grafted to the prepolymer. The resonances of NH were observed at 6.87 − 7.13 ppm, and the signals within the 7.14 − 7.27 ppm were connected to the benzene ring in the cyclotriphosphazene monomer. The characteristic peak of hydroxyl group at 9.2 ppm proved that only part of H12 was grafted successfully. A series of characteristic peaks at 0.5–4.3 ppm were connected to the methyl and methylene in polyurethane chain. The results showed that the product was successfully synthesized."
10,Properties of coatings based on different pre-polymers,"3.2 Properties of coatings based on different pre-polymers Table 2 showed a series of basic properties of coatings prepared with different pre-polymers. It can be seen that the introduction of modified IDA monomers has no obvious effect on the pencil hardness of the coatings. The pencil hardness of 500PU-DA series coatings was the highest, up to 3H. With the increase of molecular weight, the pencil hardness of the coatings decreases gradually. At the same time, the coatings have good gloss. It was found that the pendulum hardness of the coatings were increased with the increased content of IDA monomers in 1000 PU-DA and 2000 PU-DA series. The modified IDA monomers had more rigid benzene rings and ring structures, therefore, the introduction of these monomers could improve the hardness of the coatings. From the adhesion test of 500PU-DA series, it can be found that polyurethane resin has better adhesion after curing, which was due to the presence of a large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the structure. The results indicated that most samples had good adhesion, and the increased addition of IDA monomers will gradually decrease the adhesion,"
11,Self-healing properties of UV-cured coatings,"3.3 Self-healing properties of UV-cured coatings Fig. 9 is an optical microscope images of the UV-cured self-healing coatings before and after healing at 120 °C with different times. It can be seen that the self-healing ability of 500PU1-DA0 coating was poor. With the introduction of modified IDA monomer, the repairing ability of coating was gradually improved. 500PU1-DA1 coating took 10 min to complete the repairing. When the amount of DA unit was further increased, the complete repairing of coating could be achieved within 1 min. In the original polyurethane network, a repairing network, based on hydrogen bond network. When the reversible DA reaction was introduced, a double reversible networks containing DA cross-linking and hydrogen bonds was formed in the UV-cured coating. When the coating was damaged, the DA bond in the reversible network was opened by heating. At the same time, the hydrogen bond between the segments was dissociated. During the cooling process, the two networks were combined again, and self-healing process was completed. The healing process could be observed in Movies S1 − S2 (support information)."
12,Healing efficiency of UV-cured coatings,"3.4 Healing efficiency of UV-cured coatings Coating surface roughness can be measured and quantitatively represented using a gloss-meter. If the sample surface undergoes a certain wear, its gloss is reduced; thus, the gloss improvement after the healing can be used to determine the healing performance [25]. Table 3 shows the gloss changes of coatings before and after multiple self-healing. Once the coating surface is damaged, the gloss value evidently drops. The healing treatment helps the surface recover its gloss value. We repeated the damaging and healing processes three times. The healing efficiency can be determined using Eq. (1): Healing efficiency = gloss value healing/gloss value pristine. The healing efficiency of most coating decreased gradually with the grinding times. 500PU-DA coating exhibited the best self-healing performance, and the 1:2 and 2:1 series can reach 100 %, which is caused by the interaction of hydrogen bond network and reversible D-A network."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, multi-armed polyurethane oligomers and DA monomer with photo-sensitive groups were synthesized. The oligomers and DA monomer were used to prepare a UV-cured self-healing coatings and then investigated properties of the coatings, such as hardness, gloss, and adhesion. The multi-armed polyurethane oligomers using the rigid group as the “core” and the flexible segment as the “arm”. The DA monomer can occur Diels-Alder reaction while the polyurethane oligomers containing hydrogen bond. The completion of self-healing behavior of coatings was based on the hydrogen bond and D-A reaction. The results show that with the introduction of DA monomer, the repairing ability of coating was gradually improved. The complete repairing of coatings could be achieved within 60 s. In addition, the coating also exhibited a high pencil hardness, and the hardness of 500PU-DA coatings could reach 3H. The results proved the application prospects of the self-healing coatings with high repair efficiency and excellent hardness."
