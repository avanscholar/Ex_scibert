0,Introduction,"Storing renewable energy in form of hydrogen is regarded as one of the most fascinating energy storage routes, which makes large-scale, long-term, seasonal storage of the intermittent renewable energy possible [1–16]. However, developing a safe, reliable, compact, and cost-effective hydrogen storage method is still a key issue that needs to be carefully addressed before large-scale application of hydrogen energy is practical [17]. Currently, hydrogen can be stored as compressed gaseous hydrogen, cryogenic liquid hydrogen, and solid-state hydrogen in materials. Compressed gaseous hydrogen storage is the most popular and widely used method to store hydrogen due to its technical simplicity and fast filling-releasing kinetics [18]. However, the volumetric hydrogen density of this method is very low if the hydrogen storage pressure is below 20 MPa. Raising the storage pressure can increase the hydrogen density but will in turn remarkably increase both the tank cost and the energy consumption for compression [19,20]. Solid-state hydrogen storage is a method where hydrogen atoms or molecules are tightly bound with materials [17,21]. It is a promising hydrogen storage method since the volumetric hydrogen densities of the materials are generally higher than 100 kg H2 m−3 [22]. Therefore, it is possible to use a relatively small tank to store a large amount of hydrogen. Many kinds of hydrogen storage materials have been researched and developed, including conventional metal hydrides (MH) or alloys [17,23–30], complex hydrides [31–34], carbon-based materials [35–38], metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [39–42], organic liquid [43–47], ammonia borane [48–51], ammonia [52–56], etc. Currently, only limited categories of hydrogen storage materials have been subjected to practical application, such as rare-earth-based AB5-type alloys, titanium-based AB-type or AB2-type alloys [57–59]. However, the gravimetric hydrogen densities of such materials are too low (< 2 wt%) for mobile application [17,60]. In fact, the solid-state hydrogen storage method is more suitable for stationary application [61]. In addition, solid-state hydrogen storage system still suffers from slow hydrogen sorption kinetics because this process relies strongly on the hydriding/dehydriding reaction rate of the hydrogen storage materials. To supply hydrogen at a speed fast enough for high-power FC under low temperatures is still a technical challenge for solid-state hydrogen storage method [59,62]. Hybrid hydrogen storage that combines two or more methods can balance the hydrogen sorption performance with the storage density [63–66]. Gaseous and solid-state (G-S) hybrid hydrogen storage is a hybrid method that stores hydrogen in a high-pressure tank combined with hydrogen storage materials [63,67–69]. Daimler Benz AG first developed a G-S hybrid hydrogen storage steel vessel in 1985 and stored hydrogen under 10–30 MPa [70]. But this vessel was still as heavy as the conventional steel vessel. In 2003, researchers from National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology (AIST), NKK Corporation, Kansai University, and Kokan Doramu Corporation estimated the potential of a novel hybrid hydrogen storage tank combining an aluminium−carbon fiber reinforced plastic (Al−CFRP) composite tank with a hydrogen storage alloy. They suggested that the gravimetric hydrogen density of the hybrid tank is higher than a tank using only MH, and the volumetric hydrogen density is higher than an Al−CFRP composite gaseous tank [63]. Unfortunately, this hybrid tank is still too heavy compared with the gaseous tank. Researchers from Toyota Motor Corporation compared the hydrogen storage performances of a low-pressure MH tank (< 1 MPa), a high-pressure gaseous tank (35 MPa), and a high-pressure MH hybrid tank containing Ti–Cr–Mn alloy (35 MPa). They found that the high-pressure MH hybrid tank could store 7.3 kg of hydrogen in a 180-L tank, while it was only 3 kg for the gaseous tank with the same volume. In addition, the high-pressure MH hybrid tank could uptake 80% of the capacity within 5 min, which is much faster than the low-pressure MH tank, which took 30−60 min to reach the same capacity. However, the gravimetric hydrogen density of the high-pressure MH tank is still too low to be equipped in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV). In other words, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage method is more suitable for stationary rather than mobile application before lighter hydrogen storage materials are available. Previous studies on G-S hybrid hydrogen storage were generally mobile-application oriented. The storage pressures were mostly at a level of as high as 10–35 MPa, which resulted in both high cost and increased compression energy. In this work, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage method with working pressure below 10 MPa will be investigated and its possible application in a stationary hydrogen energy storage system will be discussed. A G-S hybrid hydrogen storage apparatus with hydrogen capacity of 10 Nm3 for a 10 kW hydrogen energy storage system will be designed and built. The performances of the hydrogen storage apparatus will be validated. This work will demonstrate that the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage with moderate storage pressure is a very promising method for stationary hydrogen storage application because it is compact, safe and can release enough hydrogen under low temperature in the initial stage when heat supply is not available (i.e., superior cold start performance)."
1,Experimental,
2,Hydrogen energy storage experiment platform,"2.1 Hydrogen energy storage experiment platform In 2014, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), which is a super-large state-owned enterprise that constructs and operates power grids in China, built a hydrogen energy storage experiment platform to study the feasibility of hydrogen to store renewable energy. Fig. 1 demonstrates the schematic diagram and the picture of the hydrogen energy storage system. It consists of a simulative solar energy module, a 10-kW alkaline electrolyzer, a hydrogen storage module, a 10-kW FC electricity generation module, and an energy management module. The alkaline electrolyzer utilizes the simulative fluctuant solar energy to generate hydrogen at an average speed of about 30 SLM (standard liter per minute). The hydrogen storage module uptakes hydrogen at a speed fast enough to store the hydrogen produced from the electrolyzer. When it is on the peak demand of electricity, the hydrogen stored will be converted to electricity and heat by the FC module. The hydrogen storage system supplies hydrogen at a speed of about 100 SLM."
3,Technical requirements for the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system,"2.2 Technical requirements for the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system To design a compact, safe, high-performance hydrogen storage system, many factors should be taken into account, which includes hydrogen storage capacity, working pressure, hydrogen storage density, hydrogen uptake and releasing rates, low-temperature booting performance, etc. Table 1 lists the detailed performance targets for the hydrogen storage system and their explanations. In this work, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system will be designed based on the technical requirements listed in Table 1."
4,Working pressure optimization method,"2.3 Working pressure optimization method For a G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank, the hydrogen storage density and the low-temperature booting performance depend strongly on the contents of the gaseous hydrogen and the solid-state hydrogen. Generally, more solid-state hydrogen means higher volumetric hydrogen density of the tank, while more gaseous hydrogen will result in better low-temperature booting performance. If the internal volume of a tank is fixed, the ratio of gaseous hydrogen to solid-state hydrogen will lie on the properties of the hydrogen storage materials used, the working pressure inside the tank, and the content of the hydrogen storage materials. Based on these assumptions, the working pressure of the hydrogen storage tank will be optimized and the hydrogen storage performance that the hydrogen storage materials should have will then be specified."
5,Preparations and measurements of the hydrogen storage alloys,"2.4 Preparations and measurements of the hydrogen storage alloys The alloy was prepared by a suspension melting furnace. The purities for the raw materials are as follows: Ti, 99.9%; Zr, 99.9%; Mn, 99.9%; Cr, 99.8%; V, 99.9%. Since the saturated vapor pressure of Mn is much higher than the other raw metals, the original content of Mn is excess of about 0.25–1.5 wt%. To ensure the homogeneity of the alloy, the alloy was melt for three times. A lot of work has been done to ensure the homogeneity of the 60 kg alloys: Firstly, clean, dry, and less rusty raw materials that are free of oil stains and impurities are used. Specially, sponge titanium, sponge zirconium, electrolytic manganese and ferro-vanadium alloy were used as the raw materials. The dimension of the ferro-vanadium alloy was optimized to be 1–3 cm. Secondly, due to the low melting point of Mn element, the loss of Mn during melting is unavoidable. Therefore, the optimized excess content of Mn is 1.0 wt%. Thirdly, the melting duration was also be optimized. It was shown that the alloy with 3-min melting has the best homogeneity. The pressure-composition isotherms (PCT) and the isothermal hydrogen sorption curves of the alloys were collected using a home-made Sieverts−type apparatus. Before measurements, the alloys were crushed into particles of < 200 mesh. Then the crushed alloys were enclosed inside a sample reactor and were activated for three times. During an activation cycle, the alloys were first outgassed at 200 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature (RT) for hydrogen absorption at 10 MPa. The outgassing process was conducted again at 200 °C for 1 h. As for the PCT measurement, the equilibrium conditions for each dose were > 10 min and < 10−5 wt% min−1."
6,Measurements of the hydrogen storage system,2.5 Measurements of the hydrogen storage system The hydrogen pressure inside the hydrogen storage system was detected by a pressure transducer. The hydrogen uptake/release rate was controlled by a hydrogen mass flow controller. A circulating heating medium or coolant with a certain temperature was used to keep the hydrogen storage tanks under a constant temperature during the hydrogen uptake/release measurements. Detailed information on the measurement instruments is demonstrated in Table 2 . The purity of the hydrogen used during measurements is > 99.99%.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Working pressure optimization,"3.1 Working pressure optimization Firstly, the hydrogen storage tank will be designed based on the technical requirements displayed in Table 1. Accordingly, the hydrogen storage capacity of the tank should be ≥ 10 Nm3, which means that the tank should be able to continuously release at least 10 Nm3 of hydrogen with a rate of 100 SLM at the highest temperature (about 50 °C) that the FC module can provide to power a 10 kW FC. Empirically, it is better to design the tank capacity with a margin of 20%. Therefore, a solid-state hydrogen capacity (C solid) of ≥ 12 Nm3 is preferred. If a Ti–Mn hydrogen storage alloy with hydrogen density of 1.6 wt% is used, the total weight of the hydrogen storage alloy should be 67.4 kg. The density of a Ti–Mn hydrogen storage alloy is generally 6 kg L−1 [71–73]. Then, the total volume of the alloy (V alloy) is 11.24 L. According to the item No. 2 in Table 1, the tank should continuously release hydrogen with a rate of 100 SLM for more than 10 min at −15 °C. Since the solid-state hydrogen in the materials cannot readily release out at such low temperature, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank should contain at least 1 Nm3 of gaseous hydrogen to meet the requirement of item No.2. Therefore, the capacity of the gaseous hydrogen is C gas = 1 Nm3. The total internal volume (V total) of the tank is: (1) V total = V alloy + V gas + V 0 V alloy: internal cylinder volume that is filled with alloy. V gas: internal cylinder volume that contains only gaseous hydrogen. V 0: dead volume of the tank including valves, gas tubes, cylinder body, thermal conductor, etc. Empirically, it is assumed here that (2) V 0 = 0.2 ( V alloy + V gas ) It is obvious that the total gaseous hydrogen stored in the internal volume of V gas should be 1 Nm3 (STP) and it is 12 Nm3 (STP) of hydrogen for V alloy. According to the state equation of ideal gas (3) P V gas = n gas R T The cylinder volume filled with gaseous hydrogen should be (4) V gas = n gas R T / p where R (= 8.314 J mol−1 K−1) is the universal gas constant, T (= 300 K) is the room temperature and n gas (= C gas/22.4 L mol−1 = 44.64 mol) is the amount of the gaseous hydrogen. The volumetric hydrogen storage density of the tank is (5) ρ V = ( m solid + m gas ) / V total where m solid is the weight of the solid-state hydrogen stored, and m gas is the weight of the gaseous hydrogen stored. Combined Eqs. (1−5), it is obtained that (6) ρ V = 0.9739 / ( 0.01124 + 111348 / p ) Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the volumetric hydrogen storage density (ρ V) of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank with the hydrogen pressure (p) plotted based on Eq. (6). It can be calculated that when p = 6.7 MPa, the volumetric hydrogen storage density of tank can reach 35 kg H2 m−3, which is comparable to a 70 MPa tank filled only with gaseous hydrogen. Taking into account of a margin of 20%, the working pressure of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank is finally designed to be 8 MPa. The working pressure will partially determine the hydrogen sorption properties that the hydrogen storage alloy should have. As the working pressure of the tank was designed to be 8 MPa, the end pressure of the hydrogen absorption plateau of the alloy at T = 10 °C in the PCT curves should be ≤8 MPa. To ensure complete hydrogen absorption, the end pressure should be further reduced to ≤ 6 MPa. According to item No. 6 in Table 1, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank should release H2 of ≥ 10 Nm3 at T = 50 °C when the internal hydrogen pressure reduces to 0.2 MPa. This means that the end pressure of the hydrogen desorption plateau should be higher than 0.2 MPa at T = 50 °C. In addition, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank should release 80% H2 of the total capacity when the internal hydrogen pressure reduces to 0.2 MPa at room temperature of 10 °C where no heat supply for H2 storage system is available. This means that the end pressure of the hydrogen desorption plateau should also be higher than 0.2 MPa at T = 10 °C. Based on the above analysis, the final target for the hydrogen storage alloy is that the end pressure of the hydrogen desorption plateau of the hydrogen storage alloy should be ≥ 0.2 MPa at T = 10 °C."
9,Material preparation and properties,"3.2 Material preparation and properties In this work, the Ti–Mn based AB2−type hydrogen storage alloy was selected as the hydrogen storage material for the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank since this kind of material is low-cost, long-cycle-life, and highly adjustable in composition-property. A hydrogen storage alloy with composition of Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 was prepared for this work. The PCT curves of this alloy under temperatures of −15 °C, 10 °C, 30 °C and 50 °C are shown in Fig. 3 a. As can be seen that the end pressure of the hydrogen desorption plateau at 10 °C is about 0.6 MPa, which is higher than the target pressure of 0.2 MPa. The end pressure of the hydrogen absorption plateau at 10 °C is about 5 MPa, which is below the target pressure of 6 MPa. Therefore, the hydrogen storage alloy developed in this work can meet the requirements for the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank presented in Table 1. From the PCT curves in Fig. 3a, it can be obtained that if the alloy uptakes hydrogen at 10 °C under 5 MPa and then releases hydrogen to 0.2 MPa at 50 °C, the alloy can store reversibly a hydrogen capacity of about 1.7 wt%, as demonstrated in Fig. 3a. The hydrogen absorption/desorption plateau pressures of the Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 alloy under temperatures of −15 °C, 10 °C, 30 °C, and 50 °C are 1.48/0.41 MPa, 3.05/1.27 MPa, 6.55/3.43 MPa, and 10.98/5.78 MPa, respectively. The hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction enthalpies can be obtained by the van't Hoff equation (Eq. (7)). (7) ln p H 2 = Δ H / ( R T ) − Δ S / R where p H2 (Pa) is the hydrogen absorption or desorption plateau of a PCT curve; ΔH (J mol−1 H2) and ΔS (J K−1 mol−1 H2) is the reaction enthalpy and entropy of the relevant absorption or desorption; T (K) is the absolute temperature under which the hydrogen absorption or desorption is conducted; R (= 8.314 J mol−1 K−1) is the universal gas constant. The plots of the lnp H2 versus 1/T for the hydrogen absorption and desorption of the Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 alloy are displayed in Fig. 3b. It was calculated that the enthalpies of the hydrogen absorption (ΔH a) and desorption (ΔH d) reactions of the Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 alloy are 21.7 kJ mol−1 H2 and 28.9 kJ mol−1 H2, respectively. To study the kinetic properties of the Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 alloy, the hydrogen absorption measurement under conditions of 8 MPa and 15 °C (Fig. 3c) and the hydrogen desorption measurements under conditions of 0.2 MPa and various temperatures (Fig. 3d) were conducted. It is shown that the alloy can uptake hydrogen of about 1.9 wt% within 3 min, while it can readily release hydrogen of 1.87 wt%, 1.58 wt%, and 0.97 wt% within 2 min under temperatures of 30 °C, 10 °C, and −15 °C, respectively. The kinetic performance is excellent for the Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.25 alloy."
10,Tank design and system integration,"3.3 Tank design and system integration The hydrogen storage alloy will generate/absorb heat when uptaking/releasing hydrogen, therefore the hydrogen storage performance of the tank depends strongly on the heat transfer properties of the tank. To offer good performance of the hydrogen storage system, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system was designed to consist of two tanks, which were integrated with other accessories such as valves, gas tubes, filters, etc. The hydrogen storage capacity of each tank is 6.5 Nm3 including 6 Nm3 of solid-state hydrogen and 0.5 Nm3 of gaseous hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 3a, the reversible hydrogen storage capacity of the alloy is 1.7 wt%, therefore the amount of the hydrogen storage alloy for each tank is 31.7 kg (6 Nm3 × 0.0899 kg m−3/1.7 wt%). Totally, 63.4 kg of the hydrogen storage alloy is needed for the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system. The outline dimensional drawing of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank is displayed in Fig. 4 a. The total internal volume of the tank was calculated to be 13.5 L. The external of the tank is wrapped with a water/coolant canister through which the circular hot water or coolant flows to heat or cool the tank. The structure of the passageway for the hot water or the coolant can be found in Ref. [74]. The hot water or the coolant will go through the passageway to deliver the heat into or out of the hydrogen storage tank to ensure fast hydrogen sorption performance of the tank. S31254 austenite stainless steel was used to build the tank body since it is more stable in high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere. The external diameter of the pressure-bearing tank is 140 mm. S30408 was used to build the water/coolant canister. The external diameter of the canister is 152 mm and the designed pressure level is < 1 MPa. The two ends of the pressure-bearing tank were weld with standard shell covers. The hydrogen storage tanks should be connected with other parts such as filters, vales, pressure gases, pressure reducing vale, etc. To ensure that the hydrogen storage system run safely and stably. Fig. 4b shows the connection diagram of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system. The filter is used to prevent the hydrogen storage alloy powders from coming out from the tanks. The pressure relief valve is a safety part to ensure the hydrogen pressure inside the tank is not higher than the upper pressure limit. The charging/discharging valves are the on-offs to control the start/stop of the hydrogen uptake/release. A one-way valve is set between the hydrogen storage system and the discharging opening to prevent the air from sucking back into the hydrogen storage tanks. The pictures of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system after fabrication are shown in Fig. 4c and d."
11,Hydrogen storage performance,"3.4 Hydrogen storage performance The built G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system was subjected to hydrogen charging and discharging measurements to evaluate its hydrogen storage performance. Before measurement, the hydrogen storage system was first degased to 1 bar followed by evacuation for 30 min. During the hydrogen uptake measurement, circulating water with temperature of 6 °C and flow rate of 1.2 m3 h−1 was used to cool the hydrogen storage tanks. The hydrogen flow rate was set to be a constant of 30 SLM and the maximum hydrogen pressure was limited to < 5 MPa. Fig. 5 a shows the hydrogen uptake performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system plotted as hydrogen flow rate and accumulating hydrogen uptake capacity respectively versus hydrogen uptake time. As shown in Fig. 5a, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system can continuously uptake hydrogen for about 408 min (i.e., 6 h, 48 min) at a constant flow rate of 30 SLM, with a hydrogen capacity of 12.232 Nm3. The hydrogen uptake was stopped when the hydrogen flow rate is reduced to 4 SLM, with a total capacity of 12.768 Nm3. The high-temperature hydrogen releasing measurement is conducted to evaluate the maximum hydrogen releasing capacity that G-S hybrid the hydrogen storage system can provide. Before measurement, the hydrogen storage system was first charged to 5 MPa with circulating water of 6 °C and 1.2 m3 h−1. Then the hydrogen releasing measurement was conducted at a flow rate of 100 SLM. Circulating water of 60 °C and 1.2 m3 h−1 was used to heat the hydrogen storage tanks during the measurement. Fig. 5b shows the hydrogen releasing performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system at high temperature (60 °C) plotted as hydrogen pressure, hydrogen releasing flow rate, and accumulating hydrogen releasing capacity versus hydrogen releasing time. As can be seen that the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system can continuously release hydrogen for about 111 min at a constant flow rate of 100 SLM, with a hydrogen capacity of 11.020 Nm3. When the hydrogen releasing flow rate is reduced to 5 SLM, the total capacity reaches to 12.022 Nm3. Then the volumetric hydrogen storage density of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank can be calculated to be 40.07 kg H2 m−3. It should be noted that the internal volume of the tank, which is 13.5 L for one tank, was adopted to calculate the hydrogen storage density. The room-temperature hydrogen releasing measurement was conducted to evaluate the hydrogen releasing performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system when heat supply is not available. The hydrogen storage system was first charged to 5 MPa. Then the hydrogen releasing measurement was conducted with circulating water of 15 °C and 1.2 m3 h−1. Fig. 5c shows the hydrogen releasing performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system at room temperature (15 °C) plotted as hydrogen pressure, hydrogen releasing flow rate, and accumulating hydrogen releasing capacity versus hydrogen releasing time. As shown in Fig. 5c, the hydrogen storage system can continuously release hydrogen for 69 min at a constant hydrogen flow rate of 100 SLM, with a hydrogen releasing capacity of 6.955 Nm3. A total hydrogen capacity of 10.163 Nm3 can reach when the hydrogen pressure inside the hydrogen tanks is reduced to 0.2 MPa. The room-temperature hydrogen releasing capacity (10.163 Nm3) covers 84.5% of the total releasing capacity (12.022 Nm3) at 60 °C. The lowest air temperature that Beijing can reach is about −15 °C all year round. The low-temperature (−15 °C) hydrogen releasing measurement was conducted to evaluate the hydrogen releasing performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system without heat supply at the initial running stage (5–10 min) of FC. The hydrogen storage system was first charged to 5 MPa at −15 °C. Then the hydrogen releasing measurement was conducted with circulating ethyl alcohol of −15 °C and 1.2 m3 h−1. Fig. 5d shows the hydrogen releasing performance of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system at −15 °C plotted as hydrogen pressure, hydrogen releasing flow rate, and accumulating hydrogen releasing capacity versus hydrogen releasing time. The G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system can continuously release hydrogen for 14.8 min at a constant hydrogen releasing flow rate of 100 SLM, with a hydrogen releasing capacity of 1.481 Nm3. The G-S hybrid hydrogen storage displays good performances in the cold start operation, completely meeting the requirement of the FC system."
12,Energy storage efficiency,"3.5 Energy storage efficiency For a typical hydrogen storage material, the hydrogen desorption reaction is endothermic, while it is exothermic for the hydrogen absorption reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to remove in time the absorption reaction heat from the hydrogen storage system or provide enough energy to facilitate the desorption reaction. Study on the energy storage efficiency is essential to understand the feasibility of the practical application of the pure solid-state hydrogen storage technology or the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage technology. For the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system, the energy storage efficiency (η) is determined by the following equation: (8) η = 1 − E c / E s where E c is the total energy consumed to power the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system, while E s is heat of combustion of the total hydrogen stored in the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system. According to section 3.4, the hydrogen storage system can reversibly store hydrogen of about V H2 (= 12 Nm3, STP), therefore, the amount of the hydrogen reversibly stored in the hydrogen storage system is (9) n H 2 = V H 2 / V m where V m (= 22.4 L mol−1) is molar volume constant of the ideal gas under standard atmospheric pressure. Then (10) E s = Δ H c n H 2 where ΔH c (= 285.6 kJ mol−1) is the combustion heat of 1 mol H2. The total energy consumed (E c) by the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system includes mainly four parts: (1) Energy (E 1) consumed to remove the reaction heat during hydrogen uptake process. (2) Energy (E 2) consumed to heat the hydrogen storage alloy bed from room temperature (25 °C) to the hydrogen releasing temperature (60 °C) during hydrogen releasing process. (3) Energy (E 3) consumed to heat the gaseous hydrogen inside the tanks from room temperature (25 °C) to the hydrogen releasing temperature (60 °C) during hydrogen releasing process. (4) Energy (E 4) consumed to maintain the endothermic hydrogen releasing process. Therefore, E c can be obtained by the following equation: (11) E c = E 1 + E 2 + E 3 + E 4 The heat of the hydrogen absorption reaction of the hydrogen storage system is designed to be removed by the circulating water. The heat produced during the absorption process (Q 0) can be calculated by the following equation: (12) Q 0 = Δ H a n H 2 where ΔH a is the hydrogen absorption reaction enthalpy of the hydrogen storage alloy, which should be 21.7 kJ mol−1 H2 according to section 3.2. If it is in summer when the environment temperature is higher than 25 °C, the heat generated during the hydrogen uptake process should totally be removed by a refrigerating machine. Taking into account the energy dissipation to the ambience environment, the efficiency of the refrigerating machine was determined to be η 1 = 80%. A water pump with a power of P 0 = 250 W was used to drive the circulating water. According to section 3.4, the absorption time (t a) is closed to 7 h. Therefore, the energy consumed to remove the heat during the hydrogen uptake process is (13) E 1 , max = Q 0 / η 1 + P 0 t a If it is in winter when the environment temperature is lower than 15 °C, the heat generated during the hydrogen uptake process can be removed by the circulating water of environment temperature and no refrigerating machine is needed. In this case, the energy consumed to remove the heat during the hydrogen uptake process is (14) E 1 , min = P 0 t a Therefore, (15) E 1 , min ≤ E 1 ≤ E 1 , max During the hydrogen releasing process, one needs to heat the hydrogen storage alloy and the hydrogen gas inside the tanks from room temperature (T 1 = 25 °C) to the hydrogen desorption temperature (T 2 = 60 °C). The energy consumed to heat the hydrogen storage alloy is (16) E 2 = c M m 1 ( T 2 – T 1 ) where c M (= 0.475 J g−1 K−1) is the specific heat capacity of the hydrogen storage alloy [75]. According to section 3.3, the mass (m 1) of the hydrogen storage alloy is 63.4 kg. The energy consumed to heat the hydrogen inside the tanks is (17) E 3 = c H 2 m 2 ( T 2 – T 1 ) where c H 2 (= 14.3 J g−1 K−1) is the specific heat capacity of the hydrogen. And the mass of the hydrogen (m 2) is (18) m 2 = M H 2 n H 2 where M H 2 (= 2 g mol−1) is the molar mass of hydrogen. The hydrogen desorption reaction of the hydrogen storage alloy is endothermic. Therefore, energy should be consumed to maintain the temperature. According to section 3.2 the hydrogen desorption reaction enthalpy (ΔH d) of the hydrogen storage alloy is 28.9 kJ mol−1 H2. Then, the energy consumed to maintain the endothermic hydrogen releasing process can be obtained by the following equation: (19) E 4 = Δ H d n H 2 / η 2 + P 0 t d where t d equals to 2 h according to section 3.4 and η 2 (= 80%) is the efficiency of the heater. Combined the Eqs. (8−19), the energy storage efficiency of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system can be calculated to be η = 71.5%–81.0%. If both the energy consumed to heat the hydrogen storage alloy and hydrogen and the energy to maintain the hydrogen releasing process were from the waste heat of the FC system, the energy storage efficiency of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system can be further increased to be η = 86.4%–95.9%. In should be noted that the real efficiency would be lower than the calculated one since not all energy consumed were taken into account, such as the energy needed to heat up the steel parts and the insulation, or the heat loss, etc. In addition, the heat provision and removal is important to the energy efficiency, however, since it is difficult to insert a thermocouple in the system, the temperature profile is also not available. Despite this, the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage technology is still an advanced hydrogen storage solution for hydrogen energy storage application in the power system considering its hydrogen storage performance and energy storage efficiency."
13,Conclusions,A gaseous and solid-state (G-S) hybrid hydrogen storage system with a working pressure of 5 MPa for a 10 kW hydrogen energy storage experiment platform was developed in this work. The G-S hybrid hydrogen storage tank has a high volumetric hydrogen storage density of 40.07 kg H2 m−3. It can readily release enough hydrogen with a constant rate of 100 SLM at a temperature of as low as −15 °C when the FC system is not fully activated and hot water is not available. The energy storage efficiency of the G-S hybrid hydrogen storage system is calculated to be as high as 86.4%–95.9% when it is combined with the FC system. The G-S hybrid hydrogen storage is validated to be a promising method for stationary hydrogen energy storage application.
