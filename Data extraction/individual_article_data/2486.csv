0,Introduction,"One of the main focus points in research nowadays is metal nanoparticles based nanocomposites. The conceptual understanding of the physics and chemistry involved in the nanocmposites would serve to make the best use of it. It is well established that polymers are excellent host matrices for the immobilization of metal nanoparticles like silver, gold, copper, etc., as they may act as reducing agent, stabilizer and capping agents in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. Hybrids of metal nanoparticles in plastic films are of high interest in many applications, especially those who require coating of large area (Sun et al., 2009). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is an important polymer which has been widely applied as a dielectric matrix for metal nanoparticles (Ali et al., 2016, 2018). It can be processed from water to form transparent elastic films with good physical and thermal stability, thus, it is an appropriate matrix for electronic, optical and opto-electronic applications (Monti et al., 2004). Therefore, PVA/metal nanocomposites can produce functional materials with outstanding optical and electronic properties (Saini et al., 2013). A significant number of reports in the literature accounts for the synthesis of metal polymer nanocomposites, with the possibility of tuning their electrical and optical properties for different applications (Mahendia et al., 2010; Weickmann et al., 2005; KreibigUVollmer, 1995). It has been depicted that the physical properties are closely related to the nanoparticle size and shape. For example, metallic nanorods of gold and silver exhibit anisotropic optical properties that are directly related to their aspect ratios (Chaudhari et al., 2007). In this context, choosing the metal/polymer combination, the relative concentrations and reduction method are key points to obtain a composite featuring specific properties (Mahendia et al., 2010; Weickmann et al., 2005). Polymer/metal nanoparticles composites are of high interest for many ﬁelds such as sensing (Lee et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2020) optical data storage (Pastoriza-Santos et al., 2018; Ghazy et al., 2021), photocatalysis (Cheng et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016) and photovoltaics (Atwater and Polman, 2010; Chen et al., 2013). This is due to the fact that the electrical characteristics of such composites are close to those of metals, whereas the processing methods and mechanical properties are typical for plastics. Thus, controlling the physical and electrical properties of polymer/metal composites would determine their possible applications (Mamunya et al., 2002). There is a growing interest in gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesis due to their unique properties in several research ﬁelds. Au NPs are the most stable and compatible metal nanoparticles used for preparation of smart devices (Ibrahim et al., 2020). In addition, they are distinguished for their high extinction coefficient and broad absorption band in the visible range. There is a great interest in the incorporation of gold nanoparticles within polymer matrices in order to obtain Au/organic hybrid nanocomposites which combine the functionalities of both polymer and Au NPs (Tokarev et al., 2008). Hydrogels based on PVA have been used as reactors for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles, since hydroxyl groups act both as reductant and stabilizer for tailoring the shape and size of Au NPs. Based on this, Au NPs were incorporated in PVA hydrogel via diffusion-controlled reductions of tetrachloroauric acid dissolved in the gels using sodium ascorbic acid or borohydride (Moreno et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2009). Ionizing radiation has been proven to be clean and efficient method to prepare polymer/metal nanocomposites (Ali et al., 2018; Ghazy, 2015; Ali et al., 2016; Afify et al., 2018; Ghazy et al., 2017) In particular, electron beam radiation, from electron accelerators, represents a facile strategy for the clean solid-state reduction of metal precursors in polymer films (Ghazy et al., 2021). In addition, the strategy is suitable for the mass production of nanocomposite materials. electron beam radiation has been used for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles in PVA matrix (Ghazy et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2008; Călinescu et al., 2014; Park et al., 2014; De Freitas et al., 2018). The electron accelerators are classified to low, intermediate and high energy accelerators with energies of 0.15–0.5, 0.5–5 and 5–10 MeV respectively. The penetration depth of electron beam increases as the acceleration energy increases and is also related to the material density (De Freitas et al., 2018). In this paper, we report on a novel and facile strategy to prepare PVA/Au nanocomposites by electron beam radiation-induced reduction method, without using reducing agents or excessive purification steps. The optical, structural, thermal and electrical properties of the PVA/Au nanocomposite films were characterized using ultraviolet/visible, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, thermal gravimetric analysis and electrical/conductivity techniques."
1,Experimental and characterization,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Poly vinyl alcohol, (PVA) (M. wt., 96,000–124,000 g/mol) was purchased from LOBA, Chemie, India. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate, (HAuCl4).3H2O, was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Bi-distilled water was used as a solvent in all experiments."
3,Preparation of PVA/Au composites,"2.2 Preparation of PVA/Au composites PVA solution was prepared by dissolving 6 g PVA in 100 ml bi-distilled water. The PVA solution was then warmed up to 90 °C and thoroughly stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 6 h (until the polymer solution became completely soluble). The PVA solution was left to cool at ambient temperature and then divided to equal volumes of 10 ml to which a 1 ml of 0.025 M HAuCl4 solution was added to each. All the solutions were kept with continuous stirring for about 2 h in order to insure well homogeneity of the solution. The pH value of the prepared solutions was adjusted to 4 with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M HCl. Finally, the PVA/Au solution was casted on a Petri dish and left to dry under ambient dark conditions to form the desired ﬁlm."
4,Electron beam (EB) irradiation,"2.3 Electron beam (EB) irradiation EB irradiation was carried out in an atmospheric air at ambient temperature using 3 MeV electron energy (energy instability: ±2% maximum), beam current = 30 mA (current instability: ±2% maximum) and beam power = 90 Kw electron beam accelerator. All samples were irradiated on one side using a current of 10 mA, extraction window length ≥90 cm and scan width controllable from 60 cm up to the maximum width of the scanner. The samples were exposed to an irradiation dose of about 10 kGy each pass. Several passes under these conditions were required for higher irradiation doses. The EB irradiation doses are ranged throughout this work from 25 up to 300 kGy."
5,Characterization methods,"2.4 Characterization methods 2.4.1 Ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer (UV–VIS) The optical properties of unirradiated and irradiated PVA-Au composite samples were measured in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Unicam spectrometer made in England). 2.4.2 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) The morphology and size of gold nanoparticles were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (model JEOL JEM-100CX, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The gold nanoparticles were extracted from 50 kGy irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposite. The film was dissolved at 90 °C for 1 h, and the solution was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The precipitated gold nanoparticles were withdrawn using a micropipette and dropped on a 300 mech carbon coated copper grid. Then it was left to dry for 24 h at room temperature. For the composite film irradiated at 300 kGy, first the film was embedded in ARALDITE/EMbed EMBEDDING KIT (Mollenhauer Formula) and then cut into sections of 80 nm using LKB 8800 ULTROTOME III-Sweden. 2.4.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Shimadzu-50. 10 mg of the samples (unirradiated and irradiated samples) were used for the analysis. Temperature was cycled from room temperature up to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere where the nitrogen flow was kept at constant rate of about 50 ml/min to prevent thermal oxidation processes of polymeric samples. 2.4.4 AC electrical conductivity measurements AC and DC electrical conductivity measurements of unirradiated and irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposite films were carried out at room temperature. The sample was placed in a sandwich configuration inside a conductivity measuring cell. A Keithley-617 digital electrometer was used for measuring DC resistance of the investigated samples at room temperature, whereas LCR bridge model Hioki 3532 was used for measuring the film impedance (Z, in ohm) and the phase angle (q, in degree) between the applied AC voltage and the resulting current in the sample. The applied voltage frequency was selected in the range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz where a scan of these frequency values was performed at room temperature."
6,Results and discussion,"In this work a straightforward strategy is provided for a one-step in-situ synthesis of AuNPs in the matrix of PVA films. A solvent free solid-state reduction of gold precursor was performed under the effect of electron beam irradiation. Scheme 1 represents a description of the preparation process. PVA films containing Au+3 are irradiated with electron beam radiation from an electron accelerator of 3 MeV energy and a penetration depth of about 9 mm. This guarantees a homogeneous distribution of the electron beam energy in the specimen. The electron beam reducing effect led to the formation of AuNPs homogenously throughout the PVA film matrix. Similar procedure was used by Yamamoto et al. to precipitate Pt nanoparticles inside etched capillaries in polyimide film (Yamamoto et al., 2020). When HAuCl4 is dissolved in the PVA solution, it can fully hydrolysis according to the following equation: AuHCl4 ↔ Au3+ + H+ + 4Cl4 − In order to ensure a homogenous distribution of AuHCl4 in the PVA matrix, 0.1 M HCl was added to the PVA/AuHCl4 solution in order to shift the equilibrium of the above reaction to the left side. This in turn, would reduce the photoreduction of Au+. Upon electron beam irradiation, the main primary species formed through the track of irradiation of polymers are electrons, cations and excited state molecules (Ashfaq et al., 2020; Burton, 1951). In solid state most of the electrons and cations would not escape from the spurs and recombine forming excited state molecules, which eventually undergo fragmentation forming radicals. However, the electrons can participate in the reduction process before it is thermalized through their secondary acts with neighboring molecules (i. e. become in thermal equilibrium with the medium as a result of interaction with molecules which it encounters). In PVA matrix loaded with gold precursor, the formed radicals undergo a number of competing reactions; mainly chain scission (degradation), chain crosslinking and reduction of gold precursor. It is well known that both chain scission (degradation) and crosslinking processes take place simultaneously in polymeric matrices irradiated with ionizing radiation (Vijay Kumar et al., 2019). The overall effect of ionizing radiation (EB in this work) on the polymer depends on which one of these processes would predominate during the irradiation process (Vijay Kumar et al., 2019). Scheme 2 shows the mechanism of the two processes. The formed macroradical on PVA upon EB irradiation can undergo chain crosslinking by combining with another macroradicals. On the other hand, the macroradicals can react with oxygen from air (irradiation process is under air conditions) to form polymeric peroxide radicals which abstract a hydrogen atom from another polymer chain to form a hydroperoxide. Then, it decomposes causing the session of the main chain of PVA forming macroradicals (Gongxu et al., 1993). In both cases, the formed macroradicals have a strong redox potential, which can reduce different metal salts to the corresponding metal atoms (Eisa et al., 2011; Nadal et al., 2020). The process of radical generation strongly depends on the irradiation dose, where a higher content of Au nanoparticles should be expected for higher irradiation doses. Additionally, the ejected electrons which are formed during the primary interaction of EB with the polymer matrix can contribute to the reduction of gold ions before thermalization. The suggested reduction of gold by macroradicals differs from that suggested earlier for the in situ reduction of gold ions in PVA solution by gamma radiation, at which the solvated electrons (eaq −) and hydrogen radicals (H•) were the main reducing species (Radosavljević et al., 2012). The size of the formed nanoparticles depends on the nucleation and growth steps. When the concentration of the reduced metal atoms reaches the supersaturation level the nucleation step starts. If the rate of nucleation is high, then the concentration of metal atoms will be lower than the supersaturation level. If the rate of reduction is not high enough and coalescence is prevented, the nucleation step will be followed by the growth of the particles on the already formed nuclei without formation of new nuclei. On the contrary, when the particle growth takes place by coalescence of primary particles, particles with larger size, broader size distribution and irregular shapes are expected (Eisa et al., 2011)."
7,UV–visible spectroscopy,"3.1 UV–visible spectroscopy Fig. 1 shows the UV–visible spectra of pure PVA film and EB irradiated PVA/AuNPs films. The PVA/Au films were irradiated at 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kGy. PVA is totally transparent in the visible range, so, there shouldn't be a significant absorption in the visible region. In the UV range, PVA has two absorption peaks at about 220 nm and 280 nm. These two absorption peaks can be attributed to the π - π * transitions of the CC and CO groups, respectively. EB radiation was used to reduce the Au3+ ions in the solid state without the need for any reducing agents, chemicals or purification steps. UV–Visible absorption spectra of EB irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposite films show the surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) centered in the range of 510–550 nm. It is noticeable that SPR peaks are relatively broad, which is mainly related to the polydispersity in size and shape (Mandal et al., 2004) These SPR bands of irradiated PVA/Au films undergo a significant blue shift as well as an increase in the absorption intensity with increasing the irradiation dose up to 200 kGy. The blue shift of the SPR peak for irradiated samples with doses from 25 up to 200 kGy is probably related to the radiation-induced degree of crosslink density within PVA matrix. At this irradiation dose range, the individual macromolecules of PVA are assumed to be crosslinked with each other as shown in Scheme 2. The increase in irradiation dose leads to a gradual decrease in the distance between the cross-links, eventually giving rise to a three dimensional network. This would inhibit the aggregation of AuNPs resulting in the formation of smaller nanoparticles (Liu et al., 2009). At this range of irradiation doses, more macroradicals are formed giving the chance for the formation of new nuclei at which new nanoparticles grow, while the preformed nanoparticles are relatively protected by the formed crosslinks. At higher irradiation doses (250 and kGy) the trend is reversed; where the absorption intensity started to decrease again and the peaks are slightly red shifted. This could be due to both the larger nanoparticle size and large size distribution of gold nanoparticles (ZaheerRafiuddin, 2012; Pastoriza-Santos et al., 2000). The reversed behavior is explained by the chain scission which started to predominate at higher irradiation doses. This would reduce the polymer molecular mass around AuNPs giving the probability for the migration of individual nanoparticles to aggregated AuNPs (Pastoriza-Santos et al., 2000)."
8,Optical energy band gap and activation energies estimation,"3.2 Optical energy band gap and activation energies estimation The optical energy band gap of a material is defined as the energy distance between the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB). The smaller the band gap is, the more electrically conductive the material will be. Metals have small band gaps whereas insulators have larger band gaps. Metals as gold NPs can make a polymer behave more like a semiconductor by introducing additional energy levels within the band gap. The UV–VIS spectra can be used to calculate the optical energy band gap and to estimate the types of electronic transition. The absorption coefficient (α) can be calculated by Beer Lambert's formula (Ali et al., 2018). The optical energy band gap energy (Eg, eV) was calculated using the Tauc's equation: (αhν) = β (hν − Eg)n where: α is the absorption coefficient, β is a constant depending on the specimen structure, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of radiation, hν is the energy of the incident photon, Eg (eV) is the optical energy band gap, and the exponent n determines the type of electronic transition responsible for absorption that can take values 1/2, 3/2, 2 and 3, for allowed direct, forbidden direct, allowed indirect and forbidden indirect transitions, respectively. A plot of (αhν) (Ali et al., 2018) (cm−1.eV) (Ali et al., 2018) versus hν (eV) shows a linear behavior, and the direct optical energy band gap can be obtained by extrapolating the linear portion to intercept the hν-axis at (αhν) (Ali et al., 2018) = 0.0, (see Fig. 2 ) (Shehata et al., 2017). Here, the optical energy band gap values of the obtained data of Eg (eV) for the unirradiated PVA/Au and EB irradiated (25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kGy) PVA/Au samples are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . The calculated optical energy band gap values (Eg, eV) decreases after doping HAuCl4 within PVA matrix. This is due to the direct redox reaction between PVA and Au3+ ions forming Au nanoparticles. For irradiated samples, Eg decreases following the increase in irradiation dose. The result of decreasing Eg showed a strong dependence on the reduction of gold ions by EB irradiation. On one hand, AuNPs is responsible for the formation of defects in the PVA films; those produce localized states in the optical band gap. Therefore, the decrease in the optical band gap is resulted from the higher content of localized states. Similar results were observed before (Ali et al., 2018; Abdelaziz, 2011). On the other, hand the effect of radiation on the PVA matrix may contribute to the decrease in optical energy band gap. This is because pure PVA is partially crystalline, the radiation-induced synthesis of Au nanoparticles within PVA matrix would lead to a higher extent of disorder (decrease in crystallinty due to the higher level of crosslinking reaction). Therefore, the degree of crystallinty as a function of irradiation dose can be considered as a parameter determining the values of the optical band gap energy (Sharaf et al., 1995). In other words, the decrease in the optical energy band gap with increasing irradiation dose can be attributed to the creation of defect points and/or free radicals that existed within the band gap due to crosslinking of polymer upon irradiation. The presence of these defects may lead to the formation of lower energy states within the electron beam irradiated polymeric composites (Pastoriza-Santos et al., 2000). In addition, the radiation-induced coordination/inter reaction between PVA and Au nanoparticles can hinder the mobility of molecules and decrease their activity, consequently reduce the Eg (eV) values (Sun et al., 2009). Another factor that can significantly change in the optical band gap is the formation of double bonds in the PVA structure upon irradiation, especially in the crystal structure. On the other hand, when Au NPs are coated with thin polymer (dielectric) layer-(shell), it induces perturbation which can result in a change of optical band gap energy. Moreover, surface effects on the crystal lattice of gold, such as lattice contraction, atomic relaxation, surface reconstruction, surface passivation, or strain induced by a host material, also can change the values of optical band gap energy (Jovanović et al., 2012; Krstić et al., 2014). The activation energy is another important optical parameter, which can be determined using the Urbach rule (Ismayil et al., 2015): α = α o exp (hν /Ea) where α o is a constant and Ea is the activation energy (eV). If ln (α) is plotted against the photon energy hν (eV) at various electron irradiation doses, then the values of the activation energy can be calculated by taking the reciprocals of the slopes of the linear portions of these curves. Fig. 3 reveals that the values of activation energy are dose dependent. The increase in the activation energy from 0.7 eV up to 2 eV with increasing irradiation dose from 25 up to 300 kGy can be attributed to the increase of disorders and defects upon electron beam irradiation. This result is an evident that there is a distinct change in the crosslinking density of the PVA/Au nanocomposite films after irradiation (RavindracharyIsmayilS. PNayak et al., 2011)."
9,Transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigation,"3.3 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigation The size and morphology of the AuNPs in the composite films were investigated using TEM. Images of section samples in irradiated films at 50 and 300 kGy are shown in Fig. 4 a–c respectively. It is noticeable that the amount of AuNPs was significantly increased in the composite film by increasing the irradiation dose from 50 to 300 kGy (Fig. 4a and b respectively). This result is consistent with the UV–Visible absorption spectra which showed a higher absorption spectrum for the higher irradiation doses (Fig. 1). AuNPs in the composite film irradiated at lower irradiation dose (50 kGy) could be extracted by dissolving the film in hot water (90 °C), their TEM image is shown in Fig. 4c. However, it was not possible to extract particles from the composite film irradiated at high irradiation dose (300 kGy) due to the formation crosslinked structure, which render the film insoluble. It can be seen that the observed AuNPs are in the size range of 10–65 nm with a mean size of 40 nm (Fig. 4d). Also, a mixture of morphologies for AuNPs can be recognized in both the microtome section samples and the extracted NPs (Fig. 4b–d). Although, the majority of gold nanoparticles exhibit the spherical morphology, other morphologies such as triangular and rod-like are also observed (Fig. 4c). This anisotropy can be attributed to the complex geometry of the reaction environment in the solid state reduction, where some particles are formed on the surface of the film while others are formed within the PVA matrix. In addition, PVA is a semicrystalline polymer, which contributes to the complexity in geometry, where some particles are formed in the amorphous region while others are formed on the crystalline-amorphous boundary layer. All these variations can contribute to the existence of different morphologies (Chaudhari et al., 2007; Mandal et al., 2004). The anisotropy in AuNPs morphology may cause the broadening of surface Plasmon peak of Au nanoparticles as observed in the UV–visible absorption investigation, (see Fig. 1). It is worth noting that, the morphology of the Au particles observed in the cross-section sample of the composite film irradiated at 300 kGy are the same as those extracted from the film irradiated at 50 kGy. Moreover, it is clearly observable in Fig. 5 a–c that the synthesized gold nanoparticles are not agglomerated, indicating that they were well distributed within the PVA matrix. The non-agglomeration is attributed to the formation of crosslinks induced by EB irradiation, which increases the extent of three dimensional network structure based on the level of irradiation dose. This in turn inhibits the Au nanoparticle aggregation, leading to the formation of AuNPs in the size range of 10–65 nm (Fig. 4e). In addition, irradiation is performed in air, chain scission occurs in parallel. Shorter chains are more mobile, so it is easier for them to be adsorbed on the surface of the particles and to stabilize them. The nanoparticles themselves, since they have absorbed polymer segments on their surface, represent crosslinking points."
10,Thermal stability properties,"3.4 Thermal stability properties Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to illustrate the influence of electron beam (EB) irradiation on the thermal stability of PVA/Au nanocomposites. Figs. 5 and 6 show the TGA and dw/dt thermograms for unirradiated and EB irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposite films. For the unirradiated PVA/Au sample, it was found that there are three temperature regions over which most of the weight loss occurs. The first weight loss peak from room temperature up to 130 °C can be attributed to the evaporation of the absorbed surface and interlayer water (weight loss is about 11%). After 130 °C, one can clearly observe two peaks in the regions 250–400 °C and 400–500 °C with maxima at about 375 °C and 452 °C, respectively. These two main thermal degradation peaks correspond to two distinct decomposition steps in the range of 250–500 °C. The first peak can be assigned to the side chain degradation of PVA matrix while the second peak can be related to the decomposition of PVA main chain. The dominant degradation processes appeared during this region (250–500 °C) is the elimination of OH groups and PVA chain scission reactions (Sun et al., 2009; Giménez et al., 1996; Abdul kareem and Anu kaliani, 2011; Vodnik et al., 2012). On the other hand, EB irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites exhibit four decomposition processes in the temperature range from 25 °C up to 600 °C, unlike unirradiated PVA/Au composite. The weight losses of irradiated PVA/Au samples in the temperature range (25–130 °C) decreases with increasing EB irradiation dose, reaching 9.2%, 9.0%, 8.4%, 8.6% and 7.4% at 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 kGy, respectively. Also, one can observe that the 375 °C decomposition peak of unirradiated sample was split up into two peaks appeared at about 325 °C and 365 °C. The first peak can be ascribed to the disintegration of AuNPs within PVA matrix, whereas the second decomposition peak can be attributed to the structural degradation of PVA intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Zhang et al., 2016; Siddaiah et al., 2018). The degradation peak at about 455 °C, corresponding to the region of the major weight loss, is due to the extensive degradation of PVA backbone. In addition, as the EB irradiation dose increased from 50 kGy up to 300 kGy, the thermal stability of the irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites decreased and at the same time, the decomposition temperatures of the composites slightly decreased. Table 2 represents the thermal stability parameters obtained for unirradiated and EB irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites. The initial temperature (Ti), temperature at maximum weight loss (Ts) and final temperature of TGA thermogram (Tf) with corresponding weight loss % are presented in Table 2. The temperature parameters (Ti, Ts and Tf oC) and the weight loss at Ts, °C decreases with increasing EB irradiation dose. At higher irradiation dose in the range of 200–300 kGy, it was noticed that the temperature of the degradation processes was shifted to a lower temperature (see Fig. 6). Our results indicate that Ti, Ts and Tf of irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites at lower temperatures compared to unirradiated PVA/Au sample. In addition, a significant increase in the residual weight percent of irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites compared to unirradiated one is evident. The residual masses after the degradation steps were higher for irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites compared to unirradiated sample. The difference between the residual mass values increase with increasing irradiation dose for irradiated samples. In conclusion, the weight loss values and the temperatures of the degradation processes are largely dependent on the interaction between AuNPs and PVA matrix (Vodnik et al., 2012). Those two mentioned parameters play important roles in the thermal stability of PVA/Au nanocomposites. The faster degradation rate of irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposite can be attributed to the interaction/coordination of Au nanoparticles within PVA matrix. This enhanced the heat transfer between the two components of the nanocomposite. Hence, it is hypothesized that the synthesized Au nanoparticles within PVA matrix act as catalyst for the thermal degradation process of PVA matrix (Eisa et al., 2018). This effect is more pronounced at higher irradiation doses due to the formation of more AuNPs within the PVA matrix. On the other hand, electron beam irradiation of PVA/Au nanocomposites increases the crosslink density of PVA matrix, and this can be correlated to the increased content of the solid residue percent. Additionally, the interactions between PVA chains and Au nanoparticles would provide a mass and heat barrier, that can contribute to this increment (Krklješ et al., 2007)."
11,Conductivity behavior of PVA/Au nanocomposites at room temperature,"3.5 Conductivity behavior of PVA/Au nanocomposites at room temperature The dependence of AC conductivity (σac) on the applied voltage frequency is of importance in determining the conductivity behavior of the localized charge carriers within the trapping sites in any matrix (Pike, 1972; Rahman and Mahanta, 1980). The experimental values of σac are obtained by subtracting the DC conductivity (σdc) value from the measured total conductivity (σtot) according to the formula (Elliott, 1987): σ a c ( ω ) = σ t o t − σ d c where ω is the angular frequency (2 π f). The σtot is calculated from the following equation σ t o t = d Z × A where d (cm) is the film thickness, Z (ohm) is the film impedance and A (cm2) is the electrode area of the measuring cell. The behavior of room temperature σac as a function of the applied frequency in the range from 50 kHz up to 5 MHz for unirradiated and irradiated samples is depicted in Fig. 7 . As observed from the figure, the σac of unirradiated and irradiated samples shows steady behavior for frequency values below 160 kHz, and then after there is a sharply increment with increasing frequency from 160 kHz up to 5 MHz. This behavior could be explained on the basis of the formation of charge transfer complexes (CTCs) inside the polymer chain network, after embedding AuNPs as dopant (Mahendia et al., 2010; Ghazy et al., 2021). It is assumed that the embedded Au nanoparticles fill the free volume holes and occupy the interstitial positions between the polymer chains, and therefore links these chains to some kind of bonds by charge exchange process between the Au nanoparticles and PVA chain network (Mahendia et al., 2010; Ghazy et al., 2021). Based on the former notion, it is suggested that the CTCs formed by the embedded Au nanoparticles would reduce the barrier height between the charge trapping sites to some extent. This in turn increases the transition probability via carrier barrier hopping (CBH) conduction mechanism that appears by applying the alternating electric field (Mahendia et al., 2010; Ghazy et al., 2021). Therefore, the increase of σac with increasing the applied field frequency (160 kHz up to 5 MHz) could be attributed to the reason that, as frequency increases, the number of hopping attempts per unit time taken by the charge carrier between trapping sites increases and hence conductivity increases. In our case, frequency values below 160 kHz is not sufficient to increase the number of hopping attempts (transition probability) to the values required to overcome the barrier height between the trapping sites. On the other hand, the sharp increase in σac at higher frequencies above 160 kHz is due to the increase in hopping attempts in a non-linear manner above the barrier height resulting in enhanced conductivity. Moreover, the family of curves that appears in Fig. 7 at different irradiation doses shows the same behavior, however more detailed observation of σac at different irradiation doses and some selected frequencies namely, 1, 50, 600 kHz and 1, 3, 5 MHz is taken into consideration. Fig. 8 depicts a noticeable increase in σac at high frequencies rather than that at low frequency values. A significant maximum conductivity appears at irradiation dose of 100 kGy, especially for the corresponding frequencies of 1, 3 and 5 MHz. This could be explained in the light of radiation effect on PVA/Au nanocomposite structure. In other words, the increase of the irradiation dose to the value of 100 kGy results in crosslinking reaction within PVA host matrix, which in turn increases the formation of more CTCs with Au nanoparticles that strongly affects the charge distribution within the matrix and hence conductivity increases (Ghazy et al., 2021; Mohammed et al., 2015). Further increase in the irradiation dose may cause a counter effect on σac. Since irradiation was performed under air, the chain scission and formation of more carbonyl groups are competing reactions with the predominant chain crosslinking reaction, as was confirmed by the UV–Visible absorption results (see Fig. 1). This would result in the formation of more defects and traps for the charge carriers in the PVA matrix causing a decrease in σac. On the other hand, irradiation doses below 100 kGy namely, 25 and 50 kGy, especially at higher frequencies show a noticeable successive decrease in σac as compared with the unirradiated sample. This behavior can be attributed to the effect of lower irradiation dose levels, where less degree of crosslinking occurs at lower irradiation dose contributing a decrease in crystallinty of PVA matrix. Also, at lower irradiation dose, unsatisfied bonds can be formed before considerable crosslinking reaction in PVA host matrix takes place. These unsatisfied bonds act as defect states or charge trapping sites that may relatively predominant as compared to the number of CTCs in the matrix, and thus producing a noticeable decrease in σac. The decrement in the degree of crystallinity at lower irradiation doses contributes to a decrease in the carrier mobility (Bouderbala et al., 2008)."
12,Conclusions,"Solid state synthetic method of PVA/Au nanocomposites was carried out using electron beam irradiation. This type of radiation is an effective technique for preparing inorganic/organic nanocomposites. The characterization of PVA/Au nanocomposites through UV/Visible spectroscopy indicates that the AuNPs show a SPR peak at about 510–550 nm wavelength. The optical energy band gap as a result of doping Au NPs was found to be significantly reduced due to the formation of charge transfer complexes. The optical energy band gap of irradiated PVA/Au nanocomposites was found to decrease depending on irradiation dose. Different shape morphologies (anisotropic structures) for the synthesized gold nanoparticles within PVA matrix was obtained and can be correlated to broadening of surface Plasmon absorption peak in UV/Visible investigation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the PVA-Au nanocomposites decompose in multi stages. The results indicate that the exposure to EB doses at levels between 50 and 300 kGy decrease the thermal stability of PVA/Au nanocomposite samples as compared to unirradiated sample. The temperatures (Ti, Ts and Tf) decrease with increasing irradiation dose, whereas the residual % values increases. AC conductivity at room temperature increases with increasing the applied field frequency from 160 kHz up to 5 MHz and shows maximum values at 100 kGy irradiation dose due to the increase in formation of CTCs with Au nanoparticles within the PVA matrix."
