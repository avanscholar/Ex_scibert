0,Introduction,"As the most widely produced chemical from lignocellulosic biomass, furfural (FAL) has received considerable attention as a platform for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from renewable feedstocks including agricultural waste [1–4]. About 60–70% of furfural produced worldwide is converted to furfuryl alcohol, which is the major ingredient in furan foundry binders [4]. Other chemicals produced from furfural include furan, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, furfurylamine, tetrahydrofurfurylamine, 2-methylfuran, methyltetrahydrofuran and furoic acid [4]. Tseng et al. [5] previously studied the design of a process to produce furfuryl alcohol from furfural. 2-Methylfuran is used as a solvent and as a precursor in the manufacture of various specialty chemicals. Because the demand for 2-methylfuran is considerably less than the demand for furfuryl alcohol, and because 2-methylfuran is produced as a byproduct (coproduct) in the production of furfuryl alcohol, it is not economical to produce 2-methylfuran with a dedicated process. Instead, furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran are produced in the same process by the hydrogenation of furfural. When two or more products are produced in the same process, it is desirable to control the product distribution as well as the overall production rate so that the distribution can be adjusted depending on market conditions. Planning and scheduling of multi-product batch processes has received considerable attention in the literature [6]; however, the design and control of multi-product continuous processes has received much less attention. Kapilakarn and Luyben [7,8] studied the plantwide design and control of continuous multi-product processes; however, their examples used fictitious species. Other authors have studied steady-state optimization [9] and scheduling [10,11] of multi-product continuous processes, but not dynamics and control. Therefore it is of interest to study the design and control of a realistic process with multiple products including product distribution switching. In this work, the design and control of a process for the simultaneous production of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methlfuran including product distribution switching is considered. Steady-state process design is simulated using Aspen Plus 7.3, and process dynamics and control are modeled using Aspen Plus Dynamics 7.3. The remainder of this work is organized as follows: in Section 2, the kinetic and thermodynamic models used in this work are presented and discussed. In Section 3, the steady state design of the process is presented, and improvements to the base-case design are presented and discussed. In Section 4, control structures are developed for the base-case and improved process and the dynamic responses including the responses to product distribution changes are reported. Finally in Section 5 conclusions are presented."
1,Kinetic and thermodynamic models,"Furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran can be produced by the hydrogenation of furfural in the gas phase. The reactions are: Furfural ( FAL ) + H 2 → Furfuryl Alchohol ( FOL ) Furfuryl alcohol ( FOL ) + H 2 → 2-methyl furan ( 2-MF ) +H 2 O A number of researchers have studied the hydrogenation of furfural over various catalysts; unfortunately, few of them also considered the reaction that produces 2-methylfuran. The most widely-used catalyst for the production of furfuryl alcohol is copper chromite. Brown and Hixon [12] present data for the yield of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methlfuran in a reactor packed with copper chromite catalyst at temperatures between 100 and 164°C. Based on their data, the following kinetic model was identified: (1) r FOL = 9.98 × 10 7 exp ( − 4166 T ) C F A L C H 2 2 (2) r 2-MF = 4.09 × 10 15 exp ( − 14838 T ) C F O L C H 2 where concentrations are in mol/L (kmol/m3) and the reaction rates are kmol/s-m3. Values of pre-exponential factors and activation energies were determined from data presented by Brown and Hixon given in Table 1 . Using these data, Arrhenius plots were constructed for both reactions and the activation energies and pre-exponential factors of both reactions were determined as shown in Fig. 1 . The form of Eq. (1) was suggested by Borts et al. [13] while the form of Eq. (2) assumes a first order dependence on the concentration of both reactants. Vapor-liquid and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria were modeled with the NRTL equation in Aspen Plus. Values of the NRTL parameters used in this work are given in Table 2 . Sources of the binary parameters are given in Table 3 . Interaction parameters between furfural and furfuryl alcohol and between water and furfural and water and furfuryl alcohol were available in the Aspen databank. Other sets of binary interaction parameters were regressed based on data taken from the literature as indicated in the footnotes to in Table 3. The stationary points including azeotropes predicted by Aspen Plus using the thermodynamic model are shown in Table 4 . In addition to the pure components, there are binary azeotropes between furfural and water and 2-methylfuran and water. T-xy diagrams for all pairs of condensable species predicted by the model are shown in Fig. 2 . Furfural and water and 2-methylfuran and water have large 2-liquid regions."
2,Process design,"The base-case design for the process is similar to one developed previously by Tseng et al. [5] and presented elsewhere in the literature [4,17] for the manufacture of furfuryl alcohol, and is shown in Fig. 3 . The major difference between the process considered in this work and that discussed previously is that the reactor is operated at higher temperature, so useful quantities of 2-methylfuran are produced in addition to furfuryl alcohol. In the process, fresh furfural and hydrogen are fed together with recycled hydrogen to a reactor in a molar ratio such that the partial pressure of furfural is less than the saturation pressure. A high conversion of furfural >99% is achieved in the reaction. The product distribution is determined primarily by the reactor temperature, with higher temperature favoring the production of 2-methylfuran. The reactor effluent is cooled and unconsumed hydrogen is recycled to the reactor. The liquid phase containing furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran and water is fed to a vacuum distillation column. Furfuryl alcohol is collected at the bottom, while 2-methylfuran and water are collected at the top. Because water and 2-methylfuran are almost completely immiscible, a single decanter is sufficient to separate them with high purity. The process is designed to produce furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran with a total production rate of 50kmol/h and a product distribution between 10% and 30% 2-methylfuran. Therefore the reactor volume and temperature were determined so that the conversion of furfural was 99.5% when the product distribution was 10% 2-methylfuran. This guarantees that the conversion of furfural will be at least 99.5% for all product distributions, since a higher yield of 2-methylfuran is achieved by increasing the reactor temperature. Reactor tube diameter was specified to be 3cm, and the number of tubes is set to 2400 and the tube length was determined to get 99.5mol percent conversion of furfural entering into the reactor. Properties of the reactor are shown in Table 5 . The effect of the feed ratio of hydrogen to furfural was investigated as shown in Table 6 , but it was found that using more hydrogen than the minimum required to prevent condensation of furfural had little benefit on the reaction rate but increased gas recycle costs. Therefore the lowest feasible ratio was used in the design. The distillation column was designed by adjusting the total number of trays and the feed tray location to minimize the total annual cost, while adjusting the reboiler and condenser duties to maintain the desired composition of furfural at the top and bottom of the column. A single decanter, operating at 20°C and 1bar could produce high purity 2-methylfuran and water provided that the composition of furfural and furfuryl alcohol in the distillate product was small enough. After the base-case design was completed, design alternatives to reduce cost and save energy were considered. The improved process design is shown in Fig. 4 . It was observed that a significant amount of energy was required to pre-heat the reactor feed. Although the reactor feed temperature is not high, a significant amount of energy was required to vaporize the furfural. Therefore a feed-effluent heat exchanger was implemented in which condensing furfuryl alcohol, water, and 2-methylfuran supplied the energy to vaporize the furfural. This heat exchanger saves 889kW of power which would otherwise be provided by low-pressure steam. In the original process design, the distillate receiver is well-mixed so a mixture of water and 2-methylfuran is refluxed back to the process. Further investigation showed that the separation in the distillation column was more efficient if only the organic phase (rich in 2-methylfuran) is refluxed back to the column. Therefore the process design was modified so that the distillate receiver functioned as a three-phase separator with two liquid phases. Only the organic phase is refluxed back to the column. Unfortunately, at the reduced pressure of the distillation column (0.1atm) it is difficult to achieve the desired purity of the two liquid phases in the first three-phase separator without going below the freezing point of water. Therefore a second three-phase separator operating at atmospheric pressure is used to achieve the final separation between water and 2-methylfuran. A vapor vent allows for the escape of trace amounts of hydrogen as well as any air that may leak into the low-pressure column. An additional feature of the improved process is that essentially all of the 2-methylfuran and water are condensed at low temperature (5°C) unlike the original process where some fraction of the 2-methylfuran and water are condensed at a higher temperature and pressure. Therefore the improved process has a higher demand for chilled water, which increases costs slightly. However the savings from improved column performance more than outweigh this additional cost. The contribution to the total annual cost from the capital and operating costs of each piece of process equipment is shown in Table 7 and the utility cost is listed as a separate part as shown in Table 8 . The equations used in the cost calculations are given in the Appendix. The total annual cost of the improved process is $604,000/yr."
3,Process control,"The dynamics and control of both processes (original and improved) were also studied using Aspen dynamics. All control structures considered were decentralized PI feedback control structures with cascade control implemented as required and described in this section. Default controller tuning parameters were used for flow control loops ( K c = 0.5 , τ I = 0.3 min) and level control loops ( K c = 10 , τ I = 60 , 000 min). The control structure developed for the original process is shown in Fig. 5 . The composition in the reactor effluent (which is related to the product distribution) is controlled by adjusting the setpoint for the reactor temperature controller. The setpoint for the ratio controller was determined from the following linear relationship (3) C C = 0.0251 F 2 − M F + 0.0251 where F2-MF is the desired production rate of 2-methylfuran and where CC is the setpoint for the composition 2-MF/(2-MF+FOL). The temperature in the reactor was measured at the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th intervals (out of 100) in the reactor and the temperature measurements were fed to a high-selector. The highest temperature among these six values was controlled by the feedback controller. Single point temperature control is employed for the distillation column. Tray temperature sensitivity analysis showed that the 11th tray (the tray above the reboiler) was most sensitive to changes in the reboiler duty; therefore this tray temperature was controlled by manipulating the reboiler duty. At the top of the column, the condenser duty is fixed. The temperature controller at the bottom of the distillation is tuned by relay auto-tuning. Tyreus-Luyben tuning parameters ( K C = 0.45 k c u and τ I = 2.2 P u and τ D = P u / 6.3 ) were used. Both the reactor temperature controller and the reactor effluent ratio controller were tuned by trial and error. Key control loops and the values of controller tuning parameters for the base-case process are shown in Table 9 . The dynamic performance of the process was tested with three different scenarios: Changes in the product distribution setpoint (from 20% 2-methylfuran to 10% and 30%), changes in the fresh feed flow rate of furfural (from 50 kmol/hr to 45 and 55 kmol/hr) and changes in the amount of water in the furfural feed (from 2mol% to 1mol% and 3mol%). Fig. 6 shows the response of the process to changes in the product distribution setpoint. The distribution change is accomplished within five hours, and all variables reach a new steady state within 15h. The purity of all species remains within specifications at all times. Fig. 7 shows the response of the process to a change in the production rate achieved by adjusting the fresh feed rate of furfuryl alcohol from 50kmol/h to 45 and 55kmol/h. The production rate change is complete within 10h, and all variables reach their steady-state values within 15h. Product composition never fell below the specifications. Fig. 8 shows the response of the process to ±1mol% change in the feed composition. Increasing the purity causes a small increase in the production rate of both products, while decreasing the purity causes a small decrease. Other variables are hardly affected. A control structure was also developed for the improved process, as shown in Fig. 9 . Most of the control structure is the same as for the original process, except that two level controllers are required for the two liquid phases in the distillate receiver. Key control loops and the values of controller tuning parameters for the improved process are shown in Table 10 . Dynamic responses of the processes in the same scenarios considered for the original process are shown in Figs. 10–12 . The results are similar to those seen for the original process and suggest that the improved process can also be controlled with a decentralized feedback control structure without parameter scheduling. In particular, after a change in product distribution (Fig. 10) the production rates of the two products change rapidly and reach steady-state within seven hours. Although the dynamic response of the improved process is similar to that of the original process, one disadvantage of the improved process is that additional instrumentation and controllers are required because there are two flash tanks, both of which have two levels, a pressure and a temperature which must be controlled."
4,Conclusions,"The design and control of a multi-product process has been studied. The process produces furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran by hydrogenation of furfural in a packed catalytic reactor. The process was designed to produce a total of 50kmol/h of product and 20% 2-methylfuran at the base case. Control studies indicate that the process can transition smoothly between steady states where the product distribution is between 10% and 30% 2-methylfuran. Changes in production rate and in the purity of the furfuryl alcohol feed can also be accommodated by the control structure without difficulty. In addition to being a multi-product process, the process is also an example of sustainable chemical manufacturing because it facilitates the manufacture of valuable chemicals from agricultural waste."
