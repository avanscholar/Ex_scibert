0,Introduction,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) management facilities are known to be a source of several trace gases to the atmosphere. Most of these gases are produced by biochemical degradation of fermentable organic matter and include terpenes, alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, organic acids, ammonia and reduced sulfur compounds [1–3]. Among these chemicals, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been found to be a significant contributor to the unpleasant smell associated to waste biodegradation [4–7]. Indeed, H2S has a distinct odor of rotten eggs and can be detected by humans at very low concentrations, in the range of 0.0005 – 0.3 ppm. In addition, H2S is known to be a highly toxic agent to humans: at low concentrations (2 – 20 ppm) produces nausea, headache, dizziness and tearing of the eyes; at higher concentrations (20–200 ppm) produces coughing, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract irritation and loss of the sense of smell; exposure to very high concentrations (>500 ppm) may cause immediate unconsciousness and/or sudden death [8]. Considering the above properties, H2S can create discomfort among employees in MSW management facilities and poses a threat to their safety and health. It is also one of the gases behind the complaints about the odor nuisance in the surrounding areas of MSW landfills [9]. H2S has been investigated in the ambient air of various waste management facilities, mainly with the purpose of assessing its contribution to the odor load and to find how the gas is spatially distributed. However, most of the studies performed so far on this topic were focused on Asian countries [2,6,10–12] and little is known about it in Europe, where solid waste composition, treatment systems and climate conditions are expected to be different. Furthermore, H2S was mainly investigated in open air facilities, such as landfill sites, while indoor sites were almost completely overlooked in the existing scientific literature. As far as we know, indoor H2S concentrations were only reported by Sun et al. [10] in a MSW transfer station, in Shangai, China, and by Colón et al. [5] in three mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants located in Catalonia, Spain. Data from this last study indicated that indoor H2S could reach very high concentration levels and also that the gas distribution was dependent on the MBT technology, the stage of the process, the daily variation of operating conditions and the effectiveness of ventilation systems. This H2S variability and the potential impact of high concentration levels on the human health of waste management workers, together with the scarcity of information on this topic in Europe, provided the motivation to conduct the present study. Therefore, the work described in this paper aimed to characterize the spatial distribution of H2S concentration in the ambient air of two MSW management facilities in Portugal, during two different periods, and to explore the sources and processes governing its variability. The data gathered from this study will be useful to promote an adequate operation of MSW management facilities, avoid odorous gases emissions, improve air quality and reduce the risks associated with exposure to H2S."
1,Experimental,
2,Description of sampling sites,"2.1 Description of sampling sites Two MSW management facilities were investigated: a MBT plant with an associated landfill of residual waste from treatment process, in operation since 2012; and a closed and sealed landfill which was in use until 2012. Both facilities were located in the central region of Portugal and were separated by approximately 8 km (the exact location cannot be disclosed by confidentiality restrictions). The MBT plant has a processing capacity of 190000 t⋅year-1. A simplified schematic diagram of the treatment process is shown in Fig. 1 . Briefly, after reception, MSW is subjected to a dry mechanical treatment designed to separate fermentable organic matter from recyclable materials (glass, paper, metal and plastic) and comprises various operations, such as sieving, manual, ballistic, magnetic and optical separation. The separated fermentable organic matter flow undergoes a wet mechanical treatment where it is mixed with water (in a pulper) and impurities are removed by density, sieving and inertia. Fermentable organic matter is then anaerobically digested to produce biogas and the remaining digestate is mixed with structural woody material prior to composting, which includes in-vessel aerobic digestion, maturation and refining. The plant is also equipped with two air cleaning systems (wet scrubber + biofilter) for the treatment of volatile compounds emitted during all the waste treatment steps shown in Fig. 1. One cleaning system treats gaseous emissions from the waste reception bunker and the dry treatment step and a second system treats gaseous emissions from the wet treatment step and the composting process. The associated landfill has an area of 17 ha and a total filling capacity of 2.5 Mm3. Wastewater generated in the MBT and landfill leachates are drained to an onsite wastewater treatment plant, with a capacity of 168 m3⋅day−1, before discharge in the aquatic environment. The closed and sealed landfill has an area of 15 ha and a total filling capacity of 2.2 Mm3. Leachates generated in the landfill are sent to a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 240 m3⋅day−1. Sampling sites were selected in order to cover potentially contaminated areas (emission hotspots) and to provide an overview of H2S distribution in the ambient air of the waste management facilities (Fig. 2 ). The following sampling points were selected at the MBT plant and operating landfill: (1) first sieving area - trommel 1; (2) manual separation cabin; (3) second sieving area - trommel 2; (4) pulper area; (5) maturation area; (6) next to the biofiltration unit treating emissions from the waste reception and dry separation - biofilter 1; (7) next to the biofiltration unit treating emissions from the wet separation and composting - biofilter 2; (8), (9) and (10) closed landfill cell; (11) and (12) landfill working face; (13) wastewater treatment plant; and (14) outside the landfill area (about 20 m north of the landfill border and upwind of the prevailing wind direction). Sampling at the closed and sealed landfill was done at: (15) landfill border; (16) and (17) landfill central area; and (18) leachate treatment plant. Sampling points 1 to 5 were located indoors, under the influence of air cleaning systems, and the remaining points were located outdoors."
3,Sampling and analytical methods,"2.2 Sampling and analytical methods Passive samplers from Radiello (Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri, Padova, Italy) were selected to monitor H2S concentrations in the solid waste treatment facilities. Although there is some controversy regarding the use of these samplers, particularly because of their insufficient accuracy in the measurement of low H2S concentrations, this method remains a valid alternative to automatic instruments in describing air contamination problems [13]. In addition, passive samplers were used in this study for their simplicity, portability and low cost. The H2S Radiello sampler consists of: a polyethylene adsorbing cartridge impregnated with zinc acetate; a protective polyethylene microporous diffusive body; and a polycarbonate supporting plate. During exposure to ambient air, H2S is chemically absorbed by zinc acetate to generate zinc sulfide, which is later extracted and analyzed for sulfide ion using the methylene blue colorimetric method. For outdoor monitoring, passive samplers were housed in protective shelters, to avoid direct sunlight and harsh weather conditions, and positioned at a height of approximately 1.5 m above the ground. H2S was monitored during two field campaigns conducted from 2 to February 9, 2018 (winter) and from 3 to September 10, 2018 (summer). Preliminary field and laboratory tests were conducted in order to determine the appropriate sampling time. Based on the expected range of concentrations, indoor samples were taken during the first day of the field campaign, through 8 h, from 9h00 – 17h00, coinciding with the normal working time of employees; and outdoor samples were collected during 7 consecutive days. Only one sample was taken per monitoring point and per campaign. After sampling, the cartridges were transferred into polyethylene tubes, capped and transported to the laboratory for analysis. According to the manufacturer's procedure [14], the H2S sampling rate, Q (in ng·ppb−1·min−1), depends on ambient air temperature by the following equation: (1) Q = 0.096 × K 298 3 . 8 where K is the ambient air temperature (in Kelvin). The H2S concentration in ambient air, C (in ppb), is calculated using the equation: (2) C = m Q × t × 1000 where m is the mass of sulfide ion (in μg) and t is the exposure time (in min). The analysis of sulfide was performed following the Radiello standard procedure [14]. Sulfide was extracted from the cartridges by pipetting 10 mL of ultrapure water into each tube and stirring vigorously in a vortex mixer. After adding 0.5 mL of a ferric chloride-amine solution, the samples were stirred again and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting methylene blue solution was then analyzed by spectrophotometry (T80+ UV/Vis Spectrophotometer, PG Instruments) at an absorbance of 665 nm. Calibration of the analytical instrument was performed with a series of standard solutions, spanning the sulfide concentration range of 0.115 – 1.145 μg⋅mL−1, prepared by dilution of the Radiello methylene blue calibration standard for H2S (Sigma-Aldrich). Some of the extracted samples, particularly those taken indoors, were diluted prior to analysis, in order to fit the range of concentrations of the calibration curve. The limits of detection and quantification for the measurement of H2S in ambient air were 2 and 4 ppb, respectively."
4,Results and discussion,"H2S concentrations recorded during the present study are shown in Fig. 3 . The highest values were observed in the MBT plant, particularly in the mechanical treatment hall (monitoring points 1 to 4) where the average concentration, calculated using data from both monitoring campaigns, was 1850 ± 1003 ppb (n = 8). In the composting treatment hall (maturation stage; monitoring point 5), the average concentration was considerably lower (19 ppb; n = 2) while intermediate values were found next to the biofiltration units (546 ± 951 ppb; n = 4). The observed trend, with maxima associated with the first stages of waste processing, where fermentable organic matter starts to degrade, is in accordance with the results of previous laboratory studies conducted by Moreno et al. [1], Liu et al. [15] and Wu et al. [16], showing that H2S emissions are more intense during the initial decomposition stage of MSW. Fig. 3 also shows a clear difference between concentrations in the MBT plant (average of 1216 ± 1164 ppb; n = 14) and concentrations in the area of the operating landfill and wastewater treatment plant (average of 24 ± 36 ppb; n = 14). Application of the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test indicated that H2S concentrations in the MBT plant were significantly higher than those recorded in the remaining sites, both in winter (median value: 1439 vs. 8.4 ppb; p < 0.05) and summer (median value: 729 vs. 7.8 ppb; p < 0.01). This could be explained by the daily flux of biodegradable waste sent to the landfill, which is lower than that processed in the MBT plant, and consequently has a lower capacity to release H2S into the atmosphere. Another explanation is the above-mentioned decrease in odorous gases emissions with the increasing biological stability of organic waste. In addition, the MBT plant monitoring points were located indoors or in outdoor areas with poor ventilation, such as those located in the vicinity of biofiltration units, in contrast with the landfill monitoring points, which were located in areas completely open to the atmosphere, where H2S emissions could be easily dispersed and diluted with ambient air. The average H2S concentration measured over the operating landfill (points 8 to 12) was 22 ± 32 ppb (n = 10). A maximum was found near the working face (105 ppb) and a minimum at the most distant location from the working face (<LQ). A similar spatial pattern, with higher H2S concentrations in surface working areas and lower concentrations in inoperative or surface covered areas, was reported before in other landfill sites located in South Korea [12], Lithuania [17] and China [11]. This trend reflects the still high H2S emitting potential of organic matter remaining in residual waste and the effect of surface soil cover, which limits gas transfer into the atmosphere. The same explanation, along with the landfilled waste age, can be given to describe the data recorded over the closed landfill site where H2S concentrations were found to be lower than the limit of quantification of the method used in this study. In general, emissions of H2S from waste management facilities tend to increase during the warm season because of the influence of temperature on biological activity [18]. Kim [19] reported a seasonal trend in H2S emissions, with the highest values in summer and the lowest in winter, in a young landfill site in South Korea. Vasarevičius [17] measured H2S concentrations over a municipal landfill in Lithuania and investigated the effect of different ambient parameters on the emissions of this gas. The author reported a seasonal variation in the atmospheric levels, with a peak in summer and a trough in winter, which was attributed to the effect of ambient air temperature on waste degradation. In the present study, average temperatures of 7.7 ± 0.9 °C and 19.0 ± 0.6 °C were recorded in a nearby meteorological station during the winter and summer campaign, respectively (a summary of meteorological observations is given in Table S2 of Supplementary Material). In spite of this variation, most of the sampling sites exhibited a decrease in H2S concentration from the first to the second period, indicating that other factors, besides ambient air temperature, have been influencing air concentrations in the investigated waste management facilities. Wind speed data (3.4 ± 0.8 m⋅s-1 and 1.9 ± 0.2 m⋅s-1, in winter and summer, respectively) suggest that atmospheric dispersion of outdoor gaseous emissions was more efficient during the first sampling campaign and therefore cannot explain the H2S results. The moisture content of solid waste might be the main reason behind the observed trend since this parameter is known to affect the microbial activity and the biodegradability of fermentable organic matter [20]. Indeed, it is possible that cold and wet conditions prevailing during winter (total rainfall of 6.7 mm and 0.0 mm during the winter and summer campaign, respectively) may have promoted moisture absorption by solid waste and organic matter degradation under anaerobic conditions, with the subsequent formation of H2S and other odorous gases [21]. Also worth to mention in Fig. 3 is the remarkable difference in H2S concentration between the winter and summer campaigns (1973 ppb – 71 ppb) in sampling point 7 (biofilter 2); the highest value was recorded on a day when the anaerobic biodigester (located next to this sampling point) underwent a routine maintenance operation to remove inert material from the bottom and therefore may have caused an increase in H2S emissions. A comparison of ambient air concentrations recorded in this study with results described in the scientific literature should be done with caution because H2S emissions from waste management facilities are dependent on many factors, which may differ from site to site, including: waste composition and age; management methods; and climate conditions. However, in spite of the possible variability in the above factors, H2S concentrations measured over the operating landfill and next to the wastewater treatment plant fit well within the range of values reported before in similar waste management facilities, such as those described in China and South Korea (Table 1 ). As mentioned above, currently available information in the scientific literature for MBT plants is very scarce. Colón et al. [5] have shown that H2S concentrations are highly variable in the indoor air of these plants, depending on the stage of the waste management process, the daily activity of the plant and the ventilation conditions. Comparing the data reported by Colón et al. [5] with those obtained in other studies (Table 1), it is worth noting that H2S concentrations in MBT plants were 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than those usually detected over landfill sites, which is line with the spatial variability observed in the present study. Measured concentrations were compared with the exposure limits established by European and Portuguese regulations on occupational health. For H2S, the European Directive 2009/161/EU defines an 8-h time-weighted average indicative occupational exposure limit value (IOELV) of 5 ppm and the Portuguese Standard NP 1796:2014 defines a threshold limit value – time weighted average (TLV-TWA), for a conventional 8-h workday, of 1 ppm. In the MBT plant all the measured H2S concentrations were found to be lower than the IOELV recommended by the European Directive. However, 7 out of the 14 measured concentrations were above the TLV-TWA of 1000 ppb recommended by the Portuguese Standard. The highest values were recorded at two monitoring points located in the mechanical treatment hall (trommel 1 and pulper), during winter, where concentrations were more than three times higher than the threshold limit value. Air quality improved during the summer campaign, but H2S concentrations at both sites were still two times higher than the threshold limit value. Although these sites are not permanent workplaces, data from this study point to concentrations globally high and above the TLV-TWA in the mechanical treatment hall, which may cause adverse health effects during prolonged exposure. Also of concern were the results from the manual separation cabin, where employees work 8 hours per day and concentrations were near the threshold limit value. Data from the landfills are not directly comparable with the above-mentioned regulations because the sampling period was longer than 8 h. However, the 7-day average values obtained in the ambient air of these facilities suggest that the TLV-TWA for a normal 8-h day was not exceeded."
5,Conclusions,"H2S concentrations varied by more than three orders of magnitude across the selected sampling sites. A concentration hotspot was found in the mechanical treatment hall of the investigated MBT plant, most likely as a result of the high load of fermentable organic matter in the first stages of the waste management process. Lower levels were recorded over the operating landfill but with a concentration increase when moving from the soil-covered area to the dumping area, showing the still high H2S emission potential of organic matter remaining in residual waste. The winter to summer decrease of gas concentrations observed in the majority of the sampling points suggests that other factors than ambient air temperature were controlling H2S production and emission into the atmosphere. In the MBT plant all the measured H2S concentrations were found to be lower than the indicative occupational exposure limit value recommended by the European Directive. However, 50 % of the data obtained in this plant were higher than the threshold limit value recommended by the Portuguese regulation on occupational health. Although these results cover a limited period of time, and therefore should be regarded as preliminary, they highlight the importance of conducting routine H2S monitoring and equipment maintenance programs in MSW management facilities, in order to promote an adequate operation of treatment processes, avoid odorous gases emissions and ensure indoor air safety and outdoor air quality."
