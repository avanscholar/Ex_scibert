0,Introduction,"Low-rank coals (including lignite and sub-bituminous coal) are abundant fossil resources, which account for 50% of the global total coal deposits [1–2]. However, high water and oxygen contents and low calorific value severely limit low-rank coals application in traditional utilization technologies, such as combustion and gasification. In light of this, more attention has been paid to develop a reasonable method for the efficient utilization of low-rank coals [3–4]. Low temperature pyrolysis is regard as an effective way to upgrade low-rank coals. Meanwhile, high value-added tar and gas can also be obtained [5–8]. Low temperature pyrolysis of low-rank coals has made great progress in the past decades [9]. Due to many severe technical problems still existed, such as low tar yield, high content of heavy components in tar, and the difficulties of gas–solid effective separation, the developed pyrolysis technology are basically in the pilot or industrial demonstration stage [9–10]. So far, there is still no large-scale commercial operation plant of low temperature pyrolysis of low-rank coals. It is well known that coal is abundant in carbon and deficient in hydrogen, and the content and occurrence of hydrogen in coal determine the distributions and characteristics of products during the low temperature pyrolysis process [11–12]. It is desired that more hydrogen migration into desired products and less hydrogen migration into undesired products. In order to enhance tar yield and to improve tar quality, many attempts were made, such as coal pretreatment [13–14], design new reactor to control coal pyrolysis and secondary cracking of volatiles [15–16], hydropyrolysis [17–18], catalytic pyrolysis [19–20] and co-pyrolysis of low-rank coals with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters [21–27], etc. Till now, co-pyrolysis of low-rank coals with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters, such as biomass [21–23], petroleum residue [6,24], coal liquefaction residue [7] and plastic [25–27], are investigated to clarify whether the hydrogen in hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters is beneficial to enhance tar yield and/or improve tar quality. Although co-pyrolysis of low-rank coals with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters were extensively investigated, the majority of them focus on the synergic effects on product yields and the optimization of experimental conditions for obtaining higher tars yield [24–30]. As mentioned above, the content and occurrence of hydrogen in raw materials is crucial to the distributions and properties of products during pyrolysis process. However, the investigations on the interaction mechanisms during co-pyrolysis of low-rank colas with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters from the perspective of hydrogen migration and redistribution is scarce. Therefore, it is very imperative to investigate hydrogen migration and redistribution behaviors to elucidate the interaction mechanisms during co-pyrolysis of low-rank coals with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters. In this paper, the co-pyrolysis behaviors of lignite with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters, rice husk (RH, abundant in hydroxy hydrogen) and vacuum residue (VR, abundant in aliphatic hydrogen), were investigated. Product and hydrogen distributions were analyzed and compared with the theoretical values to elucidate hydrogen migration and redistribution behaviors during co-pyrolysis process. This paper is aiming at providing fundamental information to better understand the potential interaction mechanisms between low-rank coals and hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters with different types of hydrogen."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials In the present study, Xilinhot lignite (XL) was obtained from Xilinhot coal mine, located in Xilinhot City, Inner Mongolia. Rich husk (RH) was collected from the countryside of Gaoyou City, Jiangsu Province. Vacuum residue (VR) was collected from Sinopec Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Co., LTD. XL and RH was ground to below 74 μm before pyrolysis experiments. VR is a very viscous solid at the room temperature and can be cut into small pieces using scissors. The proximate and ultimate analyses of samples are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the hydrogen content of XL is extremely low (4.16%), and the hydrogen contents of RH (abundant in hydroxy hydrogen) and VR (abundant in aliphatic hydrogen) are higher than that of XL. So, RH and VR were used as hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters in this study."
3,Experimental procedures,"2.2 Experimental procedures The individual and co-pyrolysis experiments were performed according to the Chinese National Standard GB/T 480–2010. The XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures were direct mixing of solid–solid, and the mixing of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures usually last for about 30 min. In short, about 15 g of sample was put into aluminum retort, and the heating program was as follows: rapidly heated from room temperature to 260℃ within 20 min, then heated to 550℃ in a rate of 5℃/min and held for 20 min [31]. A conical bottle was put in ice/water mixture to collect liquid product (tar and water), and a vacuum air bag was connected to collect gaseous product. After the completion of pyrolysis process, aluminum retort was took out and cooled down. The char was took out from aluminum retort and weighted to calculate the char yield (wt%, on a dry and ash free basis of raw materials). The mass of liquid product was calculated by weight the increment of the conical flask. The mass of pyrolysis water was obtained according to the Chinese National Standard GB/T 480–2010, and the mass of tar was obtained by subtracting the mass of water from the mass of the liquid. Gas yield was calculated by difference. In order to investigate the compositions and hydrogen types of tars, another two more times of each pyrolysis experiment were performed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis were performed by dissolving liquid products into n-hexane. Besides, the individual and co-pyrolysis tars were collected by C2Cl4. Then the solutions were detected by 1H NMR to determine the types of hydrogen in tar. For convenience, XL(100-x)RHx (x = 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30) was used to donate the XL/RH mixtures with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 wt% RH, respectively. XL-nHS, RH-nHS and XL(100-x)RHx-nHS were used to donate the n-hexane solubles of tars from the individual and co-pyrolysis, respectively. Each co-pyrolysis experiment was carried out at least three times in order to determine the variability of the results and to assess the experimental relative errors<5.0%."
4,Analysis,"2.3 Analysis 2.3.1 Proximate and ultimate analyses The proximate analyses of raw materials were made according to Chinese standard GB/T 212–2008. The ultimate analyses (C, H, N and S contents) of raw materials, chars and tars were performed using elemental analyzer (Vario Micro Cube, Elementar Trading Shanghai Co., Ltd.). The data was corrected by deducting the blank measurement and comparing with standard sample. The contents of C, H, N and S in the samples were obtained simultaneously. 2.3.2 Gas chromatography analysis Concentrations of individual component in gaseous products during co-pyrolysis process were tested using a 9800 type gas chromatography (GC) (Shanghai Kechuang Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd.) equipped with a TDX-01 column (thermal conductivity detector, TCD, for detecting H2, CH4, CO, and CO2) and a Plot-Al2O3 column (flame ionization detector, FID, for detecting C2 to C4 hydrocarbons). The hydrogen content in gas (wt%, on product basis) was obtained by calculating the total mass of hydrogen in hydrogen-containing compounds, such as CH4, H2, C2H6. 2.3.3 1Hydrogen-nuclear magnetic resonance Tars were analyzed by 1H NMR with a Bruker Avance Neo 600 MHz to investigate the hydrogen types in tars. The test temperature was set to be 25 ℃, spectral widths was 11.9 KHz, delay times was 6 s. 0.5 mL CDCl3 was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as internal chemical shift reference. Hydrogen types were classified into HA, HO, Hα, Hβ and Hγ (as shown in Fig. 1 ) based on the attribution of chemical shift [32–34], and the corresponding chemical shifts are presented in Table 2 . The relative contents of each hydrogen type to the total hydrogen were calculated by the integral calculations. And the total integral value of each spectrum was normalized to the corresponding value of the TMS area (chemical shift from −0.08 to 0.08 ppm). 2.3.4 Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometer analysis The n-hexane solubles (nHS) of tars were analyzed with a GC/MS analyzer (Agilent 6890/5973 N, Agilent Technologies, USA), which was equipped with a capillary column coated with HP-5MS (crosslink 5% PH ME siloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm film thicknsess, helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, mass scanning range of 30 ~ 500 amu). The column was heated to 60 °C and held for 2 min, and then heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 10 min. The organic compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra to NIST05 and Wiley7n library data, and their relative contents (the content of each peak area) were obtained by the methods of normalization of peak areas."
5,Calculation,"2.4 Calculation 2.4.1 Theoretical values In order to evaluate the interactions between raw materials during co-pyrolysis, theoretical values were calculated using weighted average sum as shown in Eq. (1). (1) Y mix , i = x Y A , i + 1 - x Y B , i where i is a kind of pyrolysis product (tar, water, gas or char) or a kind of gaseous product (H2, CO, CH4, CO2 or C2-C4 hydrocarbon) or a kind of hydrogen (HA, HO, Hα, Hβ or Hγ); Ymix,i is the theoretical yield of i from the co-pyrolysis; YA,i and YB,i are the yields of i from XL, RH or VR individual pyrolysis, respectively; and × is the mass fraction (on the dry and ash free basis) of RH or VR in the mixture. For convenience, theoretical values are denoted as T and experimental values are denoted as E. 2.4.2 Hydrogen distribution and balance during pyrolysis process The total hydrogen content in feed is calculated using weighted average of the hydrogen content of individual XL, RH or VR (measured by ultimate analysis). The hydrogen contents of individual and co-pyrolysis products on a dry and ash free feed basis are calculated by multiplying hydrogen content in product (wt%, on a daf product basis) and each product yield (wt%, on a daf feed basis), respectively. The relative contents of hydrogen in each pyrolysis product are calculated by dividing hydrogen contents of pyrolysis products on a dry and ash free feed basis to the calculated total hydrogen content (∑hydrogen)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Product distribution during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures,"3.1 Product distribution during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures The product distributions (on the basis of dry and ash free feed) from individual (XL, RH and VR) and co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures are shown in Fig. 2 . Meanwhile, the theoretical product yields (equal to the weighted average of product yields from individual pyrolysis) were also provided. As shown in Fig. 2(a), XL lignite pyrolysis produces mainly char (67.68%) with moderate yield of gas (17.11%) and low yields of water (9.40%) and tar (5.81%). It can be noted that tar yield of XL lignite is extremely low. According to the classification of Mineral Resources Industry Requirements Manual (Revised in 2014), tar yield on dry basis < 7%, 7–12% and > 12% belong to oil-bearing coal, oil abundant coal and high oil coal, respectively [35]. Therefore, XL lignite investigated in this study belongs to oil-bearing coal. During RH pyrolysis, char, gas, tar and water are uniformly distributed, and their yields are 27.86%, 22.28%, 21.59% and 28.27%, respectively. It is worth noting that tar and water yields from RH are about four and three times of those from XL, while char yield of RH is much lower than that of XL. This is likely due to the fact that the contents of volatiles and hydroxyl groups of RH are obviously higher than those of XL. For co-pyrolysis of XL/RH mixtures, with RH ratio increase from 5% to 30%, tar, water and gas yields increase from 5.84%, 11.07% and 17.25% to 8.55%, 16.75% and 19.23%, while char yield decrease from 65.85% to 55.47%. Furthermore, it can be noted that the experimental tar yields (5.84–8.55%) are obviously lower than that of expected (6.59–10.55%), and the experimental gas (17.25–19.23%) and water (11.07–16.75%) yields are higher than those of theoretical values (17.37–18.66% and 10.34–15.06%). Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of RH (abundant in hydroxy hydrogen) is not favorable for tar production during XL pyrolysis. As shown in Fig. 2(b), different from XL and RH, VR pyrolysis produces mainly tar (68.74%) with moderate yields of char (17.18%) and gas (11.70%) and extremely low yield of water (2.38%). For co-pyrolysis of XL/VR blends, with the increase of VR ratio from 4% to 18%, tar yield greatly increase from 8.59% to 16.38%, while char, gas and water yields slightly decrease from 65.80%, 16.88% and 8.59% to 60.60%, 15.26% and 7.76%. Different from the co-pyrolysis behaviors of XL/RH mixtures, the experimental char yields (60.60%–65.80%) from co-pyrolysis of XL/VR mixtures are slightly higher than theoretical values (58.78–65.54%), while the experimental gas yields (15.26–16.88%) are slightly lower than expected (16.16–17.02%). However, the experimental tar (8.59–16.38%) and water (7.76–8.59%) yields are almost equal to the theoretical values (8.47–16.90% and 8.16–9.10%). This implies that there is no synergetic effects on tar and water production during co-pyrolysis of XL/VR blends."
8,Hydrogen distributions in products from individual and co-pyrolysis processes,"3.2 Hydrogen distributions in products from individual and co-pyrolysis processes 3.2.1 Hydrogen distributions in tar The percentage of hydrogen in tars (hydrogen content of tar multiplied by tar yield), on the basis of dry and ash free feed, are provided in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the percentage of hydrogen migrated into tar during XL pyrolysis is 0.50%, while the hydrogen migrated into tars from RH and VR are up to 1.73% and 7.11%, respectively. This indicates that more hydrogen transferred into tars during individual pyrolysis of RH and VR than that of XL, and this is likely related to hydrogen content and occurrence in feed [11–12]. With increasing RH or VR ratio, the percentage of hydrogen transferred into tars increased gradually from 0.53% and 0.88% to 0.72% at RH ratio of 30% and 1.64% at VR ratio of 18% during XL/RH and XL/VR co-pyrolysis. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the experimental values of hydrogen migrated into tars (0.53–0.72%) are all lower than expected values (0.56–0.87%) during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH mixtures. This is likely due to the catalytic effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in RH [23,28,36]. Compared with XL, RH is abundant in AAEMs, and AAEMs can not only intensify the cracking of tar from RH but also tar from XL (part of AAEMs in RH are volatilized into gas phase at the pyrolysis temperature of 550 ℃, especially the element K), resulting in the migration of hydrogen from tar to gas. This is in accord with the hydrogen distributions in gaseous products during XL/RH co-pyrolysis (as shown in Fig. 8). Conversely, the experimental values of hydrogen migrated into tars (0.88–1.64%) are all higher than theoretical values (0.73–1.50%) during XL/VR co-pyrolysis. Compared with RH, VR is abundant in aliphatics [6,24,37–38]. Therefore, VR can provide more hydrogen-rich light radicals (such as hydrogen, methyl and ethyl radicals etc.), which would combine with free radical fragments generated from XL to form medium-molecular weight compounds (i.e. tar) otherwise these free radical fragments from XL would polymerize to form char if XL was pyrolyzed alone. In order to clarify hydrogen types in tars from individual and co-pyrolysis processes, tars were detected by 1H NMR and the relative contents of each type of hydrogen in tars (on the basis of total hydrogen in tar) are plotted in Fig. 4 . In tar from XL, Hβ (40.06%) are dominated, the contents of Hα (25.89%), HA (17.33%) and Hγ (14.17%) are moderate, and the content of HO (2.55%) is extremely low. However, in tar from RH, Hα (38.31%) and Hβ (35.85%) are equally dominated, and the contents of HA, Hγ and HO are 13.41%, 9.65% and 2.78%, respectively. In tar from VR, Hβ (56.82%) are dominated, the contents of Hγ (24.67%) and Hα (11.52%) are moderate, and the content of HA (5.10%) and HO (1.89%) are relatively low. It can be noted that the contents of Hβ and Hγ of tar from VR are much higher than those in tars from XL and RH, while the contents of Hα and HA of tar from VR are much lower than those in tars from XL and RH, indicating that aromatics content in tar from VR is relatively low while the content of aliphatics is relatively high, which is in accord with the results shown in Fig. 6 (b). In tars from XL/RH co-pyrolysis, the relative contents of Hβ, HA and HO decrease and content of Hα obviously increase with increasing RH ratio. Moreover, the experimental contents of Hα and HA are higher and that of Hβ and HO are lower than expected values in tars from co-pyrolysis of XL/ RH. This implies that the addition of RH shortens alkyl side chain of tar molecules, and this is probably due to the migration of methoxyl free radicals from RH into tar during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH. With the increase of VR ratio from 4% to 18%, the relative contents of Hα and HA gradually decrease from 19.53% and 11.80% to 15.57% and 8.61%. On the contrary, the relative contents of Hβ and Hγ increase from 47.41% and 19.17% to 52.01% and 21.88% with increasing VR ratio. Ho contents varied slightly in the range of 1.82–2.10% at different VR ratios. Besides, it can be noted that the experimental values of HA and Hα are lower than expected, while the experimental values of Hβ and Hγ are higher than theoretical values. This indicates that the tars from XL/VR co-pyrolysis contain more long chain aliphatics and/or aromatics with long alkyl side chain than expected, which is in line with the results that the experimental aliphatics content (67.88%) is much higher than theoretical value (42.20%, as shown in Fig. 6). The tars from individual (XL, RH and VR) and co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures were dissolved in n-hexane to determine the content of n-hexane solubles (nHS) in tar. As plotted in Fig. 5 , the contents of nHS in tars from XL and RH are 86.31% and 55.43%, while that from VR is up to 99.53%. It can be observed that the experimental values of nHS content in tars from XL90RH10 and XL70RH30 are almost equal to the theoretical values. However, the experimental values of nHS content of tars from XL93VR7 and XL82VR18 are higher than calculated values, suggesting the improvement of tars quality during XL/VR co-pyrolysis process. Zhu et al [1] found that tar quality exhibited a better performance according to the significant positive synergetic effect from light tar (boiling point < 360 °C) content during co-pyrolysis of Naomaohu lignite and cedar. Therefore, the tar quality during co-pyrolysis not only depend on the properties of raw materials, but also on the reactor structure, experimental conditions, etc. The n-hexane solubles were detected by GC/MS to determine their composition. As plotted in Fig. 6, the components in n-hexane solubles can be classified into aliphatics, monoaromatics, polyaromatics, phenols, other oxygen-containing compounds (OOCs, including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers and furans) and others (nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds, et al.). The compounds in each group are listed in Tables S1–S5. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the compositions of n-hexane solubles in tars from XL and RH individual pyrolysis varied significantly. The main components in XL-nHS are aliphatics (33.05%), polyaromatics (29.53%) and phenols (25.17%). Differently, phenols (62.30%) are the dominated components in RH-nHS, followed by OOCs (22.59%), and the contents of monoaromatics and polyaromatics are negligible. The significant difference is related to the chemical compositions of XL and RH. In XL70RH30-nHS-E, the main components are phenols (52.95%) and aliphatics (22.51%). Besides, it can be noted that the experimental polyaromatics content (XL70RH30-nHS-E) is lower than theoretical value (XL70RH30-nHS-T), while the experimental phenols and aliphatics contents are higher than expected. This suggests that the abundant phenolichydroxylgroups in RH would combine with the free radicals released from XL to produce more phenols otherwise these free radical fragments from XL would polymerize to form polyaromatics or char if XL was pyrolyzed alone. As shown in Fig. 6(b), in VR-nHS, aliphatics are the most predominant component, accounting for 86.91% of VR-nHS. The contents of other components are all extremely low. This indicates that the main components in VR-nHS are aliphatics [6,24]. This is in line with the results shown in Fig. 4(b). In XL82VR18-nHS-E, aliphatics are also dominated (67.88%) components. Besides, phenols and monoaromatics account for 12.91% and 8.43%, respectively. Moreover, it can be observed that the experimental aliphatics content (67.88%) is much higher than theoretical value (42.20%), this is in line with the 1H NMR results that the contents of Hβ and Hγ (especially Hβ) in tar from XL82VR18 are much higher than expected value. Moreover, the experimental contents of polyaromatics and phenols are lower than expected, especially polyaromatics. 3.2.2 Hydrogen distributions in gaseous product The yields of each gaseous components (on the basis of dry and ash free feed) during individual (XL, RH and VR) and co-pyrolysis (XL/RH and XL/VR blends) are plotted in Fig. 7 . It can be observed that CO2 and CO are the dominated components in gases from XL and RH individual pyrolysis, and the yields of hydrogen-containing gas (H2, CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons) are relatively low. CO2 yields from XL and RH are 13.03% and 15.40%, respectively. CO yield from RH is much higher than that from XL, this is largely ascribe to the abundant C-O and C-O-C bonds in RH [39–40]. However, the dominated components in gas from VR are CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons, and their yields are 3.58% and 7.30%, which are much higher than those in gases from XL and RH. CO and CO2 yields in gas from VR are extremely low, and they only account for 0.29% and 0.46% of feed. This is likely due to the fact that oxygen-containing components in VR is scarce, which is in accord with the ultimate analysis results of VR (as shown in Table 1). As shown in Fig. 7(a), the experimental yields of CO, H2 and CH4 are comparable with the theoretical values during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH mixture. When RH ratio is lower than 20%, the experimental CO2 yield is comparable with calculated value, while the experimental CO2 yield is higher than expected when RH ratio is higher than 20%. Although the yield of C2-C4 hydrocarbons is tiny, the experimental yields are obviously higher than expected values. As Li et al reported [41], the AAEMs in raw materials (such as coal and biomass) can promote the thermal cracking of tar to produce C2–C4 hydrocarbons. Therefore, the AAEMs in RH intensify not only the cracking of tar from RH but also that from XL to produce C2-C4 hydrocarbons. As plotted in Fig. 7(b), with increasing VR ratio, CO2 yield decrease monotonously from 12.04% to 9.97%, while CH4 and C2-C4 yields increase from 1.24% and 1.11% to 1.48% and 1.61%, respectively. Besides, the experimental CO2 and CH4 yields are slightly lower than theoretical values, while the yields of C2-C4 hydrocarbons (1.11–1.61%) are obviously higher than expected (0.44–1.40%). Fig. 8 displays the percentage of hydrogen in gases from individual and co-pyrolysis processes (on a dry and ash free basis of feed). It can be noted that the percentage of hydrogen in gases from XL and RH are 0.44% and 0.17%. However, the percentage of hydrogen in gas from VR is 2.13%, which are much higher than that from XL and RH. This is in line with the relatively high yields of CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons from VR. With the increase of RH or VR ratio, the percentage of hydrogen in gases from XL/RH co-pyrolysis varied slightly (0.46–0.50%), while the percentage of hydrogen in gases from co-pyrolysis of XL/VR increased gradually from 0.56% to 0.71%. Moreover, the experimental values (0.46–0.50%) of hydrogen percentage in gases are higher than theoretical values (0.36–0.43%) during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH mixtures. For co-pyrolysis of XL/RH blends, the abundant AAEMs in RH can not only intensify the cracking of tar from RH but also tar from XL, leading to the transfer of hydrogen from tar to gas, and this is in agreement with the product distributions of XL/RH co-pyrolysis (as shown in Fig. 2). Although the experimental gas yields are lower than theoretical values, the experimental values (0.56–0.71%) of hydrogen percentage in gases are almost equal to the theoretical values (0.51–0.74%) during co-pyrolysis of XL/VR mixtures. 3.2.3 Hydrogen distributions in char The percentage of hydrogen in chars (hydrogen content of char multiplied by char yield) from individual (XL, RH and VR) and co-pyrolysis (XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures) processes, on a dry and ash free basis of feed, are provided in Fig. 9 . As shown in Fig. 9, the percentage of hydrogen in char from XL is 2.12%, which are 0.85% and 0.58% from chars of RH and VR individual pyrolysis. This is largely due to the fact that the char yield from XL is much higher than that from RH and VR (char yields from XL, RH and VR are 67.68%, 27.86% and 17.18%, respectively). With increasing RH or VR ratio, the percentage of hydrogen transferred into chars decreased gradually from 2.05% and 2.07% to 1.67% at RH ratio of 30% and 1.98% at VR ratio of 18% during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures. Besides, it can be noted that the experimental values of hydrogen migrated into chars are slightly lower than expected during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH blends. Compared with XL pyrolysis alone, some large free radicals from XL would combine with medium or large oxygen-containing free radicals from RH during co-pyrolysis, and oxygen would induce the condensation of char and hydrogen is removed in the form of water [11]. On the contrary, the experimental values of hydrogen migrated into chars are slightly higher than theoretical values during XL/VR co-pyrolysis processes. This is probably due to that some large free radicals from XL would combine with medium or large hydrogen-rich alkyl free radicals from VR to produce char, and more hydrogen would introduce into char during XL/VR co-pyrolysis. 3.2.4 Hydrogen distributions in water The percentage of hydrogen in water from individual (XL, RH and VR) and co-pyrolysis (XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures) processes, on a dry and ash free basis of feed, are plotted in Fig. 10 . It can be found that the percentage of hydrogen in water from XL is 1.04%, while that from RH is 3.14%. This is largely due to the fact that RH is abundant in hydroxyl groups, especially phenolichydroxylgroups [39–40]. Differently, the percentage of hydrogen in water from VR is tiny, 0.26%. With the increase of RH ratio from 5% to 30%, the percentage of hydrogen migrated into water during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH blends increase from 1.23% to 1.86%. However, the percentage of hydrogen in water during XL/VR co-pyrolysis decrease from 0.95% to 0.86% with increasing VR ratio. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the experimental values (1.23–1.86%) of hydrogen migrated into water are higher than expected (1.15–1.67%) during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH blends. RH is abundant in hydroxyl groups (phenolic hydroxyl groups and alcoholic hydroxyl groups), and hydroxyl groups would combine with hydrogen easily not only from RH but also from XL to produce water during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH mixtures. However, the experimental values (0.86–0.95%) of hydrogen migrated into water are almost equal to the theoretical values (0.91–1.01%) during XL/VR co-pyrolysis."
9,Hydrogen migration and redistribution characteristics during co-pyrolysis processes,"3.3 Hydrogen migration and redistribution characteristics during co-pyrolysis processes Tables 3 and 4 shows hydrogen distributions in pyrolysis products during co-pyrolysis of XL/RH and XL/VR mixtures. As Tables 3 and 4 shows, the summation of hydrogen (on the basis of dry and ash free feed) in all products are almost equal to hydrogen in feed, and the relative error is below 5.50% for XL/RH and 3.80% for XL/VR mixtures co-pyrolysis. The above results indicates a good accuracy of the co-pyrolysis experiments. Hydrogen distributions in pyrolysis products from XL, RH and VR individual pyrolysis and XL/RH and XL/VR co-pyrolysis (on the basis of total hydrogen in feed) are plotted in Fig. 11 . For XL, 51.47% and 25.50% of hydrogen transfers into char and water, and only 12.25% and 10.78% of hydrogen transfers into tar and gas. This indicates that about 77% of hydrogen transfers into char and water, and the hydrogen transfers into tar is limited. This is largely ascribe to the chemical structures and properties of XL lignite. Differently, for RH, 53.31% of hydrogen transfers into water and the hydrogen transfers into char and gas are 14.43% and 2.89%, respectively. Meanwhile, hydrogen transfers into tar is 29.37%, which is much higher than that of XL lignite. For XL/RH co-pyrolysis, the hydrogen transfers into tar and water increase from 12.28% and 28.62% to 15.30% and 39.29% with increasing RH ratio. Meanwhile, the hydrogen transfers into char decrease from 47.70% to 35.27% with the increase of RH ratio, and the hydrogen transfers into gas varied slightly in the range of 10.14%–11.40%. Besides, the experimental hydrogen migrated into water (28.62–39.29%) and gas (10.14–11.40%) are higher than expected (27.38–35.99% and 7.76–10.24%), and the hydrogen migrated into tar (12.28–15.30%) and char (35.27–47.70%) are lower than theoretical values (13.33–18.75% and 37.50–49.05%). This indicates that the addition of RH is conducive to the migration of hydrogen from char and tar into gas and water during XL pyrolysis. The simplified reaction mechanism and hydrogen migration pathway during XL/RH co-pyrolysis is shown in Fig. 12 . For VR, 70.54% of hydrogen transfers into tar, and the hydrogen transfers into gas, char and water are 21.14%, 5.74% and 2.58%, respectively. The hydrogen migrated into tar increase markedly from 19.73% to 31.59% with the increase of VR ratio from 4% to 18%, while the hydrogen migrated into char and water gradually decrease from 46.42% and 21.29% to 38.16% and 16.57%. The hydrogen migrated into gas varied slightly in the range of 12.55–13.68%. Moreover, the experimental hydrogen migrated into char and gas are almost equal to the theoretical values. However, the hydrogen migrated into tar (19.73–31.59%) is slightly higher than expected (17.04–30.03%), and the hydrogen migrated into water (16.57–21.29%) is less than theoretical values (18.16–23.55%). This illustrates that the addition of VR is conducive to the migration of hydrogen from water into tar during XL pyrolysis. The experimental tar yields are almost equal to the theoretical values (as shown in Fig. 2), this suggests the improvement of tar quality during XL/VR co-pyrolysis. The simplified reaction mechanism and hydrogen migration pathway during XL/VR co-pyrolysis is shown in Fig. 13 . In conclusion, co-pyrolysis of low-rank coals with hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters cannot always enhance tar yield and/or improve tar quality, which largely depend on hydrogen content and occurrence of hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters."
10,Conclusions,"(1) The co-pyrolysis of XL/RH produces more gas and water and less tar than expected. Compared with XL, much more hydrogen transfers into tar and water (29.37% and 53.31% for RH, and 12.25% and 25.50% for XL) and less hydrogen transfers into char and gas during RH pyrolysis. The experimental hydrogen migrated into water (28.62–39.29%) and gas (10.14–11.40%) are higher than expected (27.38–35.99% and 7.76–10.24%) during XL/RH co-pyrolysis, and the hydrogen migrated into tar (12.28–15.30%) and char (35.27–47.70%) are lower than theoretical values (13.33–18.75% and 37.50–49.05%). This indicates that the addition of RH is favorable for the migration of hydrogen from tar and char to gas and water during XL pyrolysis, probably ascribe to AAEMs in RH intensify not only the cracking of tar from RH but also that from XL. Consequently, more C1-C4 hydrocarbons was produced. (2) The co-pyrolysis of XL/VR yields more char and less gas than expected. During VR pyrolysis, 70.54% of hydrogen transfers into tar, which are much higher than that of XL (12.25%) and RH (29.37%) individual pyrolysis. The hydrogen migrated into tar increase markedly from 19.73% to 31.59% with the increase of VR ratio from 4% to 18%, while hydrogen migrated into char and water gradually decrease from 46.42% and 21.29% to 38.16% and 16.57%. The experimental hydrogen migrated into char and gas are almost equal to the theoretical values, while the hydrogen migrated into tar (19.73–31.59%) is higher than expected (17.04–30.03%), and hydrogen migrated into water (16.57–21.29%) is less than theoretical values (18.16–23.55%). This indicates that the addition of VR is conducive to the migration of hydrogen from water to tar during XL pyrolysis. Consequently, the contents of nHS in tar from XL/VR co-pyrolysis are higher than expected, indicates the improvement of tar quality. (3) The co-pyrolysis behaviors of XL/RH and XL/VR are completely different, and the addition of hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters during lignite pyrolysis cannot always enhance tar yield and/or improve tar quality, which largely depend on hydrogen content and occurrence of hydrogen-rich carbonaceous matters."
