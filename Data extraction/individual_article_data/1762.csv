0,Introduction,"In the last decade, significant research attention has been devoted to the development of various types of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs), such as graphene, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), disordered porous carbons, onion-like carbon, and others [1–3]. A unique combination of physicochemical properties, including fairly good chemical stability, developed surface area, excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, and environmental acceptability, has made them promising materials for various applications, including heterogeneous catalysis [1–6]. Doping with heteroelements, in particular with nitrogen, provides additional opportunities for tailoring surface properties and functionality of CNMs and, thereby, allows one to tune their catalytic activity and selectivity [7–10]. So far, much of the research effort to realize the potential of CNMs in catalysis was focused on their use as carriers for various active species, such as metal [11–17] and metal oxide [18–20] nanoparticles, and metal-oxygen clusters (also called polyoxometalates) [21–24]. At the same time, some CNMs themselves (especially, N-doped ones) may act as effective metal-free catalysts for a range of chemical transformations, e.g., Friedel-Crafts reaction [25–27], aza-Michael addition [28,29], oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and light alkanes [30–33], alkylbenzenes [34,35] and cyclohexane oxidation [36,37], hydrogen evolution [38], and oxygen reduction [39,40]. Activated carbon was also applied in the last step of the industrial production of glyphosate [41]. The selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes or ketones is a challenging chemical transformation from both fundamental and industrial viewpoints, and transition metal catalysts, including expensive noble metals, have been widely employed to achieve this goal [42,43]. However, growing environmental concerns stimulated the search for efficient metal-free catalysts [4,5,9,10]. Luo et al. reported liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol with molecular oxygen over CNTs without any promoter [44]. On the other hand, the presence of substoichiometric amounts of HNO3 [45] or nitrogen doping [44,46] enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of CNTs in this reaction. Some other types of N-doped CNMs also demonstrated pronounced catalytic activity in the oxidation of benzylic alcohols with molecular oxygen [47–49] or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) [49,50]. So far, there is no agreement in the literature which type of N species in N-CNMs is responsible for their catalytic activity [47–52]. A key role of graphitic or quaternary nitrogen species (NQ) was implicated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over N-CNTs [51] and alcohol oxidation over N-doped graphene nanosheets [47] and activated carbon catalysts [48]. On the other hand, by correlating XPS data with catalytic results, Lin and Su concluded that pyridinic nitrogen species (NPy) play a pivotal role in the oxidation of benzylic alcohols [50]. More recently, Lin et al. synthesized N-doped nanocarbons with NPy as dominating N species and demonstrated their high efficiency in the aerobic oxidation of various alcohols and phenols, thereby suggesting that NPy could play an unexpectedly positive role in selective oxidation [49]. In turn, Nakamura and co-workers suggested that active sites in N-doped carbon materials responsible for the oxygen reduction reaction are carbon atoms with Lewis basicity next to pyridinic N [52]. One of the modern trends of the chemical industry that meets the requirements of green and sustainable chemistry is the use of biomass-derived chemicals. Lignin is the second most abundant form of biomass after cellulose and one of the largest renewable feedstocks composed of aromatics [53–56]. Lignin consists of methoxylated phenylpropane building blocks differing in the number of methoxy groups, the so-called syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, presumably originated from the polymerization of sinapyl, coniferyl, and p-coumaryl alcohols, respectively. Oxidative lignin valorization may lead to the formation of low molecular weight phenolic compounds of high practical value, e.g., syringaldehyde (SAld) and vanillin, which are valuable intermediates for the manufacture of trifluoroalkyl-substituted compounds [57,58], pharmaceutically relevant amines [58,59], and other drugs [53,60]. Syringyl alcohol (SA) is considered as a model substrate for syringyl unit in lignin [53]. Given that its molecule comprises both phenolic and alcoholic functional groups, two types of oxidative transformations are possible, leading to either SAld or 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) ( Scheme 1). Recently, Lin and co-workers reported that N-doped CNMs are able to catalyze both benzylic alcohol oxidation to aldehydes and oxidation of substituted phenols to p-benzoquinones [49]. Therefore, we suggest that SA can serve as a useful probe molecule for the evaluation of the catalytic performance of various CNMs. Following our interest in the use of N-CNMs as heterogeneous catalysts for environmentally benign oxidative transformations, in this work we explored catalytic properties of N-CNTs prepared by different techniques in the aerobic oxidation of SA as a model substrate. The structure-activity relationships were investigated to understand the role of diverse N species in the oxidation process. Optimization of the catalyst and reaction conditions has allowed us to reach SAld yield as high as 97% using only 1 atm of air as oxidant and isopropanol, ethanol or water as green solvents. Special attention was drawn to the question of the catalyst stability and reusability as well as the nature of the catalysis."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Syringyl alcohol (97%), syringaldehyde (98%), and 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone (98%) were purchased from Alfa. All other compounds were the best available reagent grade and used without purification."
3,Instrumentation,"2.2 Instrumentation Chromos GC-1000 equipped with a flame ionization detector and a quartz capillary column BPX5 (30 m × 0.25 mm). GC–MS analyses were carried out using an Agilent 7000B system with the triple-quadrupole mass-selective detector Agilent 7000 (HP-5 ms quartz capillary column 30 m × 0.25 mm). HPLC analyses were performed using an HPLC Agilent Technologies 1220 Infinity LC with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C-18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5-Micron, H2O-MeCN = 50:50, 1 mL/min, 25 °C). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Brüker AVANCE-400 spectrometer at 400.130 MHz. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a KRATOS ES300 photoelectron spectrometer with non-monochromatic AlKα radiation (hv 1486.6 eV). The Au4f7/2 and Cu2p3/2 core-level lines with binding energies 84.0 eV and 932.7 eV, respectively, were used for the spectrometer calibration. The quantitative estimation of the surface composition of N-CNTs samples was performed using XPS data. The nitrogen, oxygen, and Fe content (in atomic %) was normalized to the carbon content and denoted further in the text as N/C, O/C, and Fe/C (at%). Nitrogen adsorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using an ASAP-2400 instrument. Prior to measurements, the samples were evacuated at 200 °С for 24 h. The water capacity of the samples was measured by the standard incipient wetness impregnation method. Electron microscopy images were obtained using JEM-2100 instrument. Raman spectra were collected using a HORIBA LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm."
4,Catalyst preparation,"2.3 Catalyst preparation CNTs and N-CNTs were synthesized by a standard chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique using ethylene or ethylene-ammonia mixtures (C2H4/NH3 =1:3; 2:3; 3:2) and a 62%Fe-8%Ni-Al2O3 catalyst [61,62]. For the sake of comparison, N-CNTs-P samples were synthesized by post-modification of as-synthesized CNTs with 50%NH3/Ar mixture. A detailed description of the synthesis procedures can be found in Supporting Information."
5,General procedure for catalytic oxidations,"2.4 General procedure for catalytic oxidations Oxidation of SA was carried out in thermostated glass reactors under vigorous stirring (500 rpm). Typical reaction conditions were as follows: substrate, 0.05–0.5 mmol; air or O2, 1 atm; N-CNTs (N-CNTs-P), 2.5–25 mg; solvent (iPrOH, iPrOH/H2O (1/1), EtOH, or H2O) 1 mL; 40–80 °C. For comparison, the reaction was performed in an inert atmosphere. In this case, the catalyst was preliminarily stored in iPrOH under argon flow for 10 min and then SA solution was added and stirred under argon flow for another 20–30 min. After that, the reactor was tightly closed and the samples of the reaction mixture were taken periodically through a PTFE septum for GC analysis. Before reuse, the catalyst was separated by filtration, washed with hot iPrOH (CH3CN, EtOH), and then dried in a vacuum at 120 °C for 2 h. Samples of the reaction mixture were withdrawn periodically during the reaction course by a syringe and analyzed. The oxidation products were identified by GC, GC-MS, and 1NMR analysis using authentic samples, SAld and DMBQ. The product yields were quantified by GC using biphenyl as an internal standard. For reactions performed in water, the product yield was quantified by HPLC analysis. Aliquots (5 µL) of the reaction mixture were taken periodically by a syringe and diluted with a mixture of MeCN/H2O (1/1, 100 µL) before analysis. Each experiment was reproduced at least two times. The initial rates of SA oxidation were estimated from reaction profiles at conversions below 20%. Turnover frequency values (TOF = (moles of SAld formed)/(moles of N × time) were determined from initial rates of SAld formation by GC. The number of N was determined by XPS [48]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization N-CNTs prepared using the conventional CVD technique have a typical bamboo-like structure (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information) and, consistent with our previous studies, reveal the quasi-homogeneous distribution of N atoms over the external and internal graphene layers [63]. Among this series, the nitrogen content in the catalyst samples was varied from 1.8 to 5.2 at%. Physicochemical characteristics of the samples prepared by CVD are provided in Table 1. The specific surface area of N-CNTs varies in a narrow range of 148–158 m2/g and nitrogen doping does not cause any significant change in the textural properties compared to the pristine CNTs. It is known that the porosity of both CNTs and N-CNTs refers mainly to the inter-particle porosity originated from the interweaving of the tubes [64]. XPS measurements indicated the presence of five types of N species (Fig. S2a) ascribed to pyridinic NPy (~ 398 eV), pyrrolic NPyr (~ 400 eV), graphitic NQ (~ 401 eV), oxidized NOx (~ 403 eV), and molecular NN2 (~ 405 eV) [65–67]. An increase in the total nitrogen content is usually accompanied by increasing content of all structural species [61,62,68], which can be explained by the catalytic growth mechanism of N-СNTs on the Fe catalyst with the equiprobable incorporation of nitrogen in diverse positions [69]. However, an increase in the nitrogen content also leads to an increase in the input of pyridinic nitrogen, altering the NPy/NQ ratio from 0.5 to 0.9 ( Fig. 1a). In turn, the growth of the NPy/NQ ratio in N-CNTs correlates with the increase in structural defectiveness [62]. Indeed, the value of ID/IG (the ratio of integral intensities of D (~ 1300 cm−1) and G (~ 1600 cm−1) lines in the Raman spectra, which is considered in the literature as an indicative of defectiveness, tends to enlarge with the growing N content (increasing NPy/NQ) (Table S1). The relationship between pyridine-like nitrogen and structural defects was confirmed by the experiment where the sample 4.4%N-CNTs was subjected to high-temperature annealing in Ar atmosphere. This process led to the decrease in the nitrogen content from 4.4 to 1.8 at% and simultaneous reduction of the NPy/NQ ratio from 0.9 to 0.4 (Table 1, Fig. 1b). At the same time, the ID/IG ratio decreased from 3.0 to 2.6 (see Table S1). On the other hand, the hydrophilicity of the N-CNTs increased with an increasing amount of NPy (Fig. S3), which agrees well with the literature [21,22,68]. Pyridinic nitrogens incorporated into external and internal graphene layers of the tubes make the capillary effect more pronounced and, as a result, improve the N-CNT water capacity [63]. Note that the hydrophilicity of the annealed sample turned out slightly less than that of the N-CNTs sample with a similar N content (see Fig. S3). Studies by XPS also showed that the O/C ratio in CNTs and N-CNTs varied in a narrow range of 2–3.5 at% (Table 1). The O1s spectra of all samples revealed four peaks ( Fig. 2). Based on the literature, these peaks can be assigned to quinone ~ 530.5 eV (O1), carbonyl ~ 532.0 eV (O2), phenolic (or carboxyl) ~533.5 eV (O3) and hydroxyl ~ 535 eV (O4) groups [70]. Interestingly, the amount of O1 species decreased significantly after the sample annealing in Ar (Fig. S4). Physicochemical characteristics of two samples prepared by post-modification are provided in Table 1 along with characteristics of the parent CNTs. The increase in BET surface area of the N-CNTs-P samples compared to the pristine CNTs proceeds at the stage of the preliminary CNTs oxidation (see Experimental for details) and can be explained by the shortening of tube length, as the micropores are not formed [70]. After the post-modification procedure, the oxygen content in the samples was 2.5–4.5 at%. Although the same set of O1-O4 surface groups was registered in the O1s spectra, the relative input of O1 peak corresponding to quinone groups was considerably higher compared to the N-CNTs prepared by CVD (Fig. 2). According to XPS, the nitrogen content in the N-CNTs-P samples varied from 0.7 to 2.3 аt.% (Table 1). It was demonstrated earlier that post-modification of preliminary oxidized CNTs by N-containing molecules does not affect the carbon tube structure [71,72]. Therefore, we may assume that nitrogen can incorporate predominantly into external graphene layers when the post-modification method is employed. As a result, its concentration in the external layers may exceed the N/C value determined by the standard XPS technique. Although in the N-CNTs-P samples nitrogen occupies the same structural positions as in the N-CNTs (Fig. S2), comparison of the inputs of different types of N for N-CNTs-P (Fig. S5) and N-CNTs (Fig. 1a) with close N/C (e.g., 2.3 and 1.8 at%, respectively) shows that the doping method greatly affects the ratio of diverse nitrogen species. While in the 1.8%N-CNTs sample, the dominant form is graphite-like nitrogen and NPy/NQ equals 0.5, pyrrolic N prevails in 2.3% N-CNTs-P and the ratio of NPy/NQ is as high as 1.7. In sharp contrast to the N-CNTs series prepared by CVD, nitrogen doping leads to the decrease of water capacity of N-CNTs-P compared to pristine CNTs, which further decreased with increasing N content (Fig. S3). Therefore, the supposed incorporation of N into external graphene layers and substantially higher values of NPy/NQ ratio in N-CNTs-P make them significantly different from the N-CNTs samples in terms of the surface properties."
8,Catalytic performance of N-CNTs in SA oxidation. The effect of N-doping method,"3.2 Catalytic performance of N-CNTs in SA oxidation. The effect of N-doping method The aerobic oxidation of SA was first assessed in the presence of N-CNTs prepared by CVD. While N-free CNTs were practically inactive, N-CNTs mediated oxidation of SA to SAld without evident formation of the alternative product DMBQ. Both the rate of SA oxidation and attainable SAld yield increased markedly with increasing nitrogen content in N-CNTs ( Fig. 3), thereby indicating that N-doping is crucial for the observed catalytic activity. N-CNTs with 5.2 at% N (denoted as 5.2%N-CNTs) afforded SAld with the yield of 97% after 5 h using only 1 atm of air as oxidant and iPrOH as solvent. The presence or absence of light affected neither the reaction rate nor aldehyde yield, which discarded any photochemical process. Additives of p-benzoquinone (0.01 mmol) also produced no effect on the oxidation rate, which implies the absence of a chain radical process or a process with short chains [73]. In inert atmosphere (Ar), the reaction was very slow (see Fig. 3). The formation of minor amounts of SAld under anaerobic conditions could be due to molecular oxygen adsorbed on the surface of N-CNTs. Given that the role of various N species in oxidation processes is still under debate [47–52], we attempted to assess the role of diverse nitrogen functional groups in the N-CNTs-catalyzed SA oxidation to SAld. Plots of the initial rates of SA oxidation versus the amount of each type of N as well NPy/NQ estimated from the XPS data are shown in Fig. 4. One can notice that all the plots, including the dependence on the total N content (Fig. 4a) are not linear. The larger amount of N, the more pronounced is the reaction acceleration. This is also clearly demonstrated by the growing values of TOFs assessed formally for each type of N (Table S2). All these imply that the amount of both total and specific N sites is not the only factor that has an impact on the catalytic activity of N-CNTs in the SA oxidation (if it were so, the TOF values would be independent of the N content). This can be rationalized if we remember that the ratio between different N species changes with growing total N content in N-CNTs. While quaternary N species predominate for samples with low N content (e.g., NPy/NQ = 0.5 for 1.8%N-CNTs), the amount of NQ and NPy becomes comparable if the general N content increases (NPy/NQ = 0.9 for 4.4% and 5.2%N-CNTs). Therefore, the higher values of TOFs assessed for N-rich catalysts (Table S2) might evidence in favor of the essential role of pyridinic N in the title reaction. On the other hand, the N-CNTs sample annealed in argon at 1150 °C to decrease the input of low-temperature nitrogen species demonstrated significantly higher activity relative to the parent sample and the sample with a similar N content ( Fig. 5 and Table S3), although the content of pyridine-like nitrogen decreased by 3 times while graphite-like nitrogen reduced by 1.4 times only (as a result, the NPy/NQ ratio decreased from 0.9 to 0.4). Therefore, we may conclude that variations in the NPy/NQ ratio, at least in the range studied, are not so critical for the catalytic activity of the CVD-prepared N-CNTs, and there are some other factors, which produce an impact on the oxidation process. For example, we should take into account that the amount of total oxygen and, in particular, the amount of quinone-type oxygen atoms in N-CNTs decreased significantly after the annealing procedure (see Fig. S4). Their detrimental role for catalytic activity was further confirmed while evaluating the N-CNTs-P samples (vide infra). Indeed, the yield of the aldehyde product with the N-CNTs-P samples turned out considerably lower than with the N-CNTs prepared by CVD ( Fig. 6). Even the sample with relatively low N content, 1.8%N-CNTs, was significantly more active than both N-CNTs-P samples. Among the latter, the sample with lower N content, revealed lower initial oxidation rate but higher activity in terms of the attainable product yield, indicating a trend different from that observed for the conventional N-CNTs. This might be rationalized if we remember that the N-CNTs-P samples were treated with HNO3 before the modification and 0.7%N-CNTs-P was treated under milder conditions (see Experimental for details). As a result, it contained less amount of surface oxygen species, specifically O1 (see Table 1). We may assume that the presence of such oxygen groups might favor irreversible adsorption of the oxidation products. Indeed, one can judge from Fig. 6 that sample 2.3%N-CNTs-P, which possesses the highest concentration of quinone-type oxygen atoms among the materials studied (see Fig. 2), reveals fast deactivation during the reaction course. To verify this hypothesis, we performed SA oxidation over both types of catalysts in the presence of SAld additives and found that indeed aldehyde produced a more substantial rate-reducing effect on N-CNTs-P than on N-CNTs ( Fig. 7)."
9,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.3 Optimization of reaction conditions Taking into account the superior activity of the CVD-synthesized N-CNTs with high N content in the title reaction, further optimization of the reaction conditions was carried out using mostly sample 5.2%N-CNTs. The effect of the solvent nature on the reaction rate and product yield was investigated ( Fig. 8). In addition to iPrOH, its 1/1 mixture with water, EtOH (containing 4% of H2O), and water itself were chosen as ‘green’ solvents with a suitable boiling temperature and capability to dissolve both alcoholic substrate and aldehyde product. While excellent yields of SAld were achieved in all four solvent systems, the reaction rate (TOF) increased in the order iPrOH < EtOH < iPrOH/H2O (1/1) ~ H2O (Fig. 8). The initial rates of SAld accumulation increased linearly with increasing catalyst amount ( Fig. 9), indicating the absence of external diffusion limitations. The reaction conditions were optimized further using 5.2%N-CNTs as catalyst and EtOH as solvent. The initial concentration of SA could be augmented up to 0.5 M without any decrease in the aldehyde yield based on the substrate ( Table 2, entries 1–3). As a result, the volume yield of the target product SAld could reach 87 g/L. Moreover, it was found that the initial reaction rate (TOF) is practically independent of the SA concentration employed. This may imply that activation of molecular oxygen by the catalyst (the formation of active oxidizing species) is the rate-limiting step of the SA oxidation process, which is not surprising if we take into account the relatively high reactivity of SA. Previously, first order in the substrate was found for unsubstituted benzylic alcohol oxidation over N-doped graphene nanosheets, suggesting the participation of alcohol in the rate-determining step [47]. The decrease in temperature slowed down the reaction but practically did not affect the product yield (Table 2, compare entries 4–6). The oxidation rates exhibited an Arrhenius temperature dependence ( Fig. 10), indicating that there is no change in the rate-limiting step over the evaluated temperature range. An estimation of activation energy Ea from the Arrhenius plot gave the value of 30 kJ/mol. Previously, Ea of 56 kJ/mol was determined for oxidation of benzyl alcohol over N-doped graphene [47], while the values of 71.4 and 22 kJ/mol were estimated for N-CNTs prepared by chemical vapor deposition method [46] and N-doped activated carbon [48], respectively. Taking into account that all used N-doped carbon nanomaterials have an identical set of nitrogen species, such drastic difference in Ea values, most likely, reflects different rate-limiting steps in these systems. Finally, we found that the oxidation rate increased significantly when molecular oxygen was employed as an oxidant instead of air (compare entries 3 and 7, Table 2), which also suggests that O2 participates in the rate-limiting step of the SA oxidation process."
10,Comparison with other systems for SA oxidation,"3.4 Comparison with other systems for SA oxidation Comparison of the results on SA oxidation acquired in this work with the results reported in the literature for various catalyst systems is shown in Table 3. According to the early works, SAld can be obtained with 86% yield from SA by stoichiometric oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone in dioxane [74]. Bozell and co-workers accomplished oxidation of SA to the corresponding benzoquinone in the presence of Co-Schiff [75,76] or Co(salen) [77] complexes. The formation of SAld (20–33%) was also observed in some cases, depending on the reaction conditions. Aerobic oxidation of SA was realized by Ji and co-workers at ambient conditions using Cu(OAc)2 with or without TEMPO, respectively [78,79]. In these catalyst systems, SAld could be obtained with a yield of 90–96%. Clear advantages of N-CNTs are superior SAld product yield, the absence of any transition metals and additives, the use of atmospheric air as the sole oxidant, and a possibility to be recycled and reused (see below)."
11,Catalyst stability and recyclability,"3.5 Catalyst stability and recyclability The hot filtration test revealed no SAld formation in the filtrate after catalyst removal from the reaction mixture ( Fig. 11), indicating the truly heterogeneous nature of the catalysis over N-CNTs. It is worth noting that N-CNTs may contain residues of the catalyst for the growth of carbon nanotubes, i.e. 62%Fe-8%Ni-Al2O3, despite thorough treatment with concentrated HCl [81]. To exclude the effect of metals on the catalytic results we performed oxidation of SA in the presence of the growth catalyst, as-synthesized N-CNTs and N-CNTs washed with НСl (Fig. S6). The reaction does not proceed in the presence of 62%Fe-8%Ni-Al2O3 while the acid treatment of N-CNTs has no dramatic effect on the nanotube activity. Elemental analysis of the reaction mixture after the separation of N-CNTs detected a negligible amount of Fe in the solution (<1 ppm), indicating no metal leaching. All these experiments collectively suggest that the observed intrinsic activity of N-CNTs can be attributed to the carbon material only. Reusability of N-CNTs was firstly studied under the following reaction conditions: [SA] 0.1 M, 5.2%N-CNTs 25 mg, air, iPrOH 1 mL, 80 °C. The catalyst was recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration, stirred in iPrOH at 80 °C for 2 h 2–3 times to remove the adsorbed product, and dried under vacuum at 100 °C before reuse. This treatment enabled catalyst regeneration and reuse. The catalytic activity of N-CNTs reduced after the first use, but then it remained constant ( Fig. 12, runs 4–6). Despite the TOF decrease after the first run, excellent SAld yield could be achieved during, at least, 7 reuses. Without the catalyst regeneration by washing and drying, we observed a gradual decrease in catalytic activity (Fig. 12, runs 1–3) caused, most likely, by adsorption of the SAld product on the catalyst surface. A similar recycling performance was observed in other solvents, including iPrOH/H2O (1/1), where the highest reaction rate was observed (Fig. S7). Studies by XPS showed that the surface concentration of all nitrogen species in the initial catalyst and catalyst recovered after the catalytic reaction was very close ( Table 4). In contrast to the activated carbon catalysts [48], no transformation of nitrogen species to N oxide ones was found. On the other hand, some increase in the O/C ratio was detected, which can be due to partial oxidation of CNTs during the reaction and/or adsorption of oxygen-containing products on the carbon surface. In line, a slight increase in the intensity of the C1s spectra at 286–288 eV was observed for the spent and regenerated catalysts (marked by an arrow in Fig. S8). For better comparison, a difference spectrum was calculated by subtracting the C1s spectrum of the initial sample from the corresponding C1s spectrum of the spent catalyst with the highest O/C value (line (5) in Fig. S8). The difference spectrum shows a broad peak with maxima at ~286.4 and ~288.5 eV. According to the literature, the former can be related to the carbon forming C-OH and/or single C-O-C bonds while the latter originates from triple O-CO bonds [82–84]. Importantly, the fairly good catalyst recyclability (see above) implies that the catalyst still retains a sufficient number of active centers, which enables subsequent runs without loss of performance."
12,Conclusions,"To summarize, this work demonstrated that SA is a useful organic substrate for the evaluation of catalytic behavior of N-doped CNTs synthesized by different methodologies. We have found that N-CNTs prepared by the conventional CVD technique are highly active, selective, and recyclable metal-free catalysts for oxidation of the alcohol function in SA to produce SAld while keeping the phenolic group intact. Catalytic activity of N-CNTs increases greatly with increasing N content but can be also enhanced by annealing in Ar. On the other hand, N-CNTs-P prepared by post-modification of CNTs reveal the opposite trend, which is, most likely, related to an increased amount of surface oxygen species in these materials. The detrimental role of quinone-type oxygen species on the surface was implicated from the catalytic studies on SA oxidation coupled with XPS measurements. Although at the present state of knowledge we cannot differentiate the role of NPy and NQ in the title reaction, we suggest that both types of N species are likely advantageous for the SA oxidation over N-CNTs. While NQ might play a key role in the activation of molecular oxygen as suggested previously, hydrophilicity enhanced due to increasing NPy/NQ ratio would favor adsorption of the SA substrate on N-CNTs and thereby facilitate subsequent oxidative transformation."
