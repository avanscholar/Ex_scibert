0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels are considered as the main cause for the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O (Ebrahimian and Karimi, 2020; Mathanker et al., 2020). Hence, there has been great interest in the development of sustainable, renewable and clean energy sources. As a CO2-neutral and renewable energy source, biomass is receiving a lot of attention. Biomass to biofuels is one of the most important routes for the utilization of biomass. Biofuels like biopolyol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioethanol, biogasoline and biobutanol are promising options to displace fossil-based fuels. For instance, European Union planned to produce and use biofuels in transport sector from 10% in 2020 to 25% in 2030 for each Member State (Liu et al., 2020). The key to realize this target for biofuels is the utilization of cellulosic or lignocellulosic biomass which are second generation biofuel feedstocks. Compared with first generation biofuel feedstocks, second generation biofuel feedstocks have the advantages of less competitive with food for fuel production and great resource availability. As a gasoline replacement, biobutanol is regarded as a promising replacement for bioethanol due to its merits over bioethanol such as lower corrosiveness, higher energy content and better compatibility with fuel engines without engine modification (Ebrahimian and Karimi, 2020; Sun et al., 2020b). Biochemical and thermochemical are the two major methods for second generation biomass feedstocks to butanol. The acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, which produces butanol from biomass via fermentation using Clostridial bacteria (Quiroz-Ramírez et al., 2017), is the main biochemical approach. Currently, the ABE fermentation method is the most established process for producing biobutanol (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). However, this method faces some challenges, including low productivity, difficulty in handling lignocellulosic biomass and hard to separate butanol from fermentation broth (Dumitrescu et al., 2019). Thermochemical approach for the production of biobutanol is the biomass gasification and mixed alcohols synthesis process. The thermochemical method has the advantages of a wide feedstocks adaptability, high productivity and easy to separate butanol from fermentation broth. Okoli and Adams (2014) designed a thermochemical route for the production of biobutanol from lignocellulosic biomass via gasification and mixed alcohol synthesis in Aspen Plus. The results showed that the minimum butanol selling price was $0.83/L. Based on the above work, Okoli and Adams (2017) replaced the simple mixed alcohol synthesis reactor model with a kinetic model to research the impact of design parameters. After that, Okoli et al. (2016) established a thermochemical process for the production of biobutanol from macroalgae via gasification in Aspen Plus. Based on the above analysis, these studies mainly focused on the performance of a biomass to biobutanol system using circulating fluidized bed gasifier. For the above circulating fluidized bed gasifier, biomass is partially oxidized by steam. Replacing air by steam can enhance syngas heating value but increase the cost of gasification because of the expensive steam production (He et al., 2019). Besides, tar, which is an inevitable byproduct in biomass gasification process, significantly affects the quality of syngas and the operation of equipment (Wang et al., 2020b). As a promising and novel gasification technology, biomass chemical looping gasification (BCLG) converts biomass into syngas with low tar amount through lattice oxygen in oxygen carrier substituting molecular oxygen hence avoiding use of steam and pure oxygen (Chen et al., 2019). Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of BCLG process (Li et al., 2019a). In this process, fuel reactor is regarded as reduction reactor in which biomass is oxidized by oxygen carrier to syngas such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4, etc. Air reactor is considered as oxidation reactor in which reduced oxygen carrier is regenerated by air (Liu et al., 2018a). Up to date, the main research of BCLG are primarily focusing on experiments such as searching for desirable oxygen carrier (Liu et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2019a; Liu et al., 2019b). Additionally, some recent work has aimed at process simulation for the BCLG technology. Li et al. (2010) conducted a comprehensive process simulation for the BCLG system using Aspen Plus to research the performance of oxidizer reactor. Nurdiawati et al. (2019) designed a process configuration to produce NH3 from microalgae by introducing gasification integrated with syngas chemical looping. Ge et al. (2019) proposed a system for power generation via BCLG and simulated the whole system in Aspen Plus. Kuo et al. (2018) developed a process for co-production of H2 and electricity through biomass gasification coupled with chemical looping hydrogen production. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, there has been no study of the application of biomass chemical looping gasification to a lignocellulosic biomass to biobutanol system. In this paper, a novel process is designed to produce biobutanol via BCLG. Additionally, as a kind of second generation biofuel feedstock, pine sawdust is used as material for biobutanol production. The process configuration is developed in Aspen Plus to provide mass and energy balance for economic performance evaluation such as purchased equipment investment, total capital investment, total production cost and minimum butanol selling price."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Process simulation overview,"2.1 Process simulation overview The proposed scenario in this paper is simulated by Aspen Plus V9 software to obtain energy and mass balances. RK-SOAVE is selected as global property method. STEAM-TA is used for steam and water process simulation. Biomass, ash and char are considered as nonconventional components. Tar produced from pyrolysis is modeled as a mixture of three components: benzene (60 wt%), toluene (20 wt%) and naphthalene (20 wt%) (Ahmed et al., 2015). Fe2O3, SiC, FeO, Fe3O4 and C are set as solid components, while H2, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, butanol, ethanol, methanol, etc. are taken as conventional components. In addition, DCOALIGT and HCOALGEN are chosen to estimate the density and enthalpy for the nonconventional components."
3,Process design,"2.2 Process design Fig. 2 shows the flow sheet of the proposed system, displaying the main converting steps to produce butanol from pine sawdust via chemical looping gasification, water gas shift, acid gas removal and mixed alcohol synthesis. Table 1 displays the primary operation parameters for the process steps. The proximate analysis of the pine sawdust (dry basis) is 0.60 wt% ash, 8.28 wt% moisture, 84.82% wt.% volatile matter and 14.58 wt% fixed carbon. The ultimate analysis of the pine sawdust (dry basis) is 6.21 wt% hydrogen, 48.44 wt% carbon, 0.05 wt% nitrogen, 0.01 wt% sulfur and 44.69 wt% oxygen. Additionally, the lower heating value of the pine sawdust is 19.80 MJ/kg (Huang et al., 2013). The steps of the process are described in detail as follows. 1000 t/d (dry basis) of pine sawdust is fed into the fuel reactor in which it reacts with oxidized oxygen carrier (1250 t, Fe2O3 90 wt% and SiC 10 wt%) to produce syngas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, etc) and reduced oxygen carrier solids (Fe3O4) (Li et al., 2019b). The temperature and pressure of the fuel reactor are 840 °C and 0.2 MPa, respectively. Then, the reduced oxygen carrier particles are sent to the air reactor and directly combusted with air for oxidized oxygen carrier and heat generation. The temperature of the air reactor can reach above 1100 °C and can be adjusted by controlling the amount of air. The energy carried by oxidized oxygen carrier from the air reactor can compensate for the heat needed in the fuel reactor. Additionally, the fuel reactor is modelled using RYield and RGibbs block in Aspen Plus. RGibbs block is used to simulate the air reactor (Li et al., 2010). The calculation options for the above RGibbs blocks are calculate phase equilibrium and chemical equilibrium. The target of tar reforming is to remove tar that are detrimental to the downstream equipment and catalyst. Syngas from chemical looping gasification is delivered to the tar reformer. Then, steam and tar from syngas is catalyzed by Ni/Mg/K catalyst with Al2O3 as support (Dutta et al., 2011). After that, the catalyst is separated from syngas by cyclone and transported to the regenerator in which the catalyst is regenerated. The regenerated catalyst is separated from exhaust gas by cyclone and sent back to the tar reformer. The tar reformer is simulated by RGibbs block in Aspen Plus (Okoli and Adams, 2014) and the calculation option for this RGibbs block is calculate phase equilibrium and chemical equilibrium. The main aim of water gas shift is to adjust H2/CO to meet the desired H2/CO ratio at the alcohol synthesis. The syngas from tar reformer is scrubbed with water to get rid of ammonia and particulates. After that, the syngas is heated to meet the required reaction temperature and then reacts in high temperature reactor. The gas is then cooled to produce steam and sent to low temperature reactor. In addition, Co-Mo sulfur tolerant catalyst is used in the reactors. The water gas shift reactors are modeled using RStoic block and the conversion of CO is set to 60%. The gas from water gas shift is compressed to 3 MPa by compressor and enters the amine system to remove H2S and CO2 by scrubber. The acid gas is transported to LO-CAT process in which H2S is converted to S and CO2 effluent stream is produced. In the ZnO bed, the H2S is further reduced to meet the requirement of alcohol synthesis catalyst. Sep block is developed to model the scrubber in Aspen Plus (Okoli and Adams, 2014). The cleaned syngas is sent to the mixed alcohol synthesis reactor by compressor. The synthesis reactor is composed of two fixed bed reactors and the operation pressure is 7.6 MPa of the two reactors. The syngas reacts with recycled methanol from alcohol separation section to produce C1-C3 oxygenates in the first reactor, while higher alcohols such as pentanol, isobutanol and hexanol are produced in the second reactor (Okoli and Adams, 2017). The above reactors are simulated using RStoic block and the CO conversion per-pass is set to 40%. The mixed alcohols are sent to flash drum to get rid of gases, then heated and transported to molecular sieve to remove water. Three columns are developed to obtain 99.5 wt% isobutanol separated from mixed alcohols. RadFrac block is used to simulate columns in Aspen Plus. In this process, high pressure steam is used to produce electricity, while low pressure steam is used in distillation columns, tar reformer and amine system. The electricity generated can meet the process electricity requirement. Additionally, cooling water is developed to realize the heat exchange requirement. Compr block is employed to model the steam turbine in Aspen Plus."
4,Economic analysis,"2.3 Economic analysis Total capital investment (TCI), total production cost (TPC) and minimum butanol selling price (MBSP) are developed to the economic analysis of this process and the benchmark year is 2017 in this study. Table 2 presents the components of TCI, which includes indirect investment, direct investment and working capital (WC) (Yang et al., 2019). Additionally, fixed capital investment (FCI) includes indirect investment as well as direct investment (Wang et al., 2020a). In order to calculate TCI, it is necessary to know the equipment cost (EC) which is expressed as (Sun et al., 2020a): (1) E C 2017 = E C ref × Q Q ref n × CEPC I 2017 CEPC I ref where Qref and ECref are the production capacity and equipment cost of the reference case, Q and EC2017 are the production capacity and equipment cost of the planning plant in 2017 and n refers to the scale exponent. CEPCI refers to chemical engineering plant cost index, which is developed to refresh EC from a past date to present time. The values of Qref, ECref, CEPCIref and n are listed in Table 3 . According to the EC2017 and corresponding percentages in Table 2, the TCI in 2017 can be calculated. TPC primarily consists of raw material, utilities, maintenance and operating, depreciation, plant overhead cost, administrative cost, distribution and selling cost (Kumar et al., 2020). Based on Table 4 , the TPC can be calculated. According to the prediction data of the whole system, the investment for utilities as well as pine sawdust are obtained. Additionally, under conditions of 4% salvage value and 20 years lifetime, depreciation can be calculated according to straight line method. Based on the TPC, the MBSP is estimated using MBSP = TPC/butanol production."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Simulation results and plant efficiency,"3.1 Simulation results and plant efficiency Based on the energy and mass results from Aspen Plus of the proposed process, main simulation results for the proposed process are displayed in Table 5 . The prediction results of the proposed process are important for the calculations of the economic analysis. The mass flow of butanol is 6.35 t/h, which is associated with carbon monoxide conversion settings made for alcohol synthesis reactor. Water consumption is a crucial consideration especially for water constrained regions. Water consumption for this proposed process is primarily due to evaporation in cooling water tower. Water demand for the proposed process is 13 t/h. As displayed in Table 6 , the whole energy efficiency of the proposed process is 45.33%."
7,Economic analysis,"3.2 Economic analysis 3.2.1 Equipment cost, total capital investment and minimum butanol selling price Fig. 3 (a) shows the breakdown of total equipment cost of the proposed process. For the given production capacity (4.57 × 107 kg/year), the total equipment cost is 4.65 × 108 CNY. From the breakdown of total equipment cost, it is primarily dominated by syngas compressors, CO2/H2S removal and sulfur recovery system, tar reformer and scrubber as well as steam turbine, which account for 26.87%, 23.30%, 15.90% and 14.14% of the total equipment cost, respectively. Additionally, according to Table 2, the FCI, WC and TCI are 1.33 × 109 CNY, 1.99 × 108 CNY and 1.53 × 109 CNY, respectively. Based on Table 4, the TPC of the proposed process is 4.27 × 108 CNY/year. In addition, the butanol production capacity of the proposed process is 4.57 × 107 kg/year. Therefore, MBSP is 9.35 CNY/kg. The breakdown of MBSP is shown in Fig. 3(b). Raw material, depreciation, maintenance and operating account for 60.66%, 14.91% and 9.52% of MBSP, respectively. Rational control of raw material is useful option to keep the stability of MBSP. 3.2.2 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis to identify crucial cost drivers on MBSP is performed. Selected parameters are water price, plant lifetime, total equipment cost, pine sawdust price and operating labor. Each parameter is assumed to move 20% away from the base case. As shown in Fig. 4 , water price, total equipment cost, pine sawdust price and operating labor are positively correlated with MBSP, while plant lifetime is negatively correlated. Pine sawdust price has the largest effect, but operating labor has the smallest effect. 3.2.3 Effect of CO conversion and carbon tax on MBSP As shown in Fig. 4, some crucial variables cannot be improved till the plant’s construction period. Nevertheless, conversion of CO has a great influence on economic cost and can be determined in the research stage. The effect of CO conversion on MBSP is displayed in Fig. 5 (a). Enhancing CO conversion from 40% to 60% makes a small decrease of MBSP. When CO conversion is decreased from 40% to 10%, MBSP increases largely. Besides, CO conversion as low as 20% can achieve MBSP of 10.40 CNY/kg, which can competitive with the MBSP of biobutanol from municipal solid waste (Ashani et al., 2020) and lignocellulosic biomass by pretreatment and hydrolysis (Jang and Choi, 2018). China is the largest carbon emitter with large annual increased CO2 emissions in the world (Tong et al., 2019; Xiang et al., 2014). Thus, China is facing increasing international pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions. Chinese government made many commitments to curb CO2 emissions. Carbon tax is regarded as a crucial policy instruments to reduce CO2 emissions (Zhang et al., 2017). This means there will be an explicit cost to reduce CO2 emissions for chemical process. As shown in Fig. 5(b), when carbon tax increases from 0 to 250 CNY/t CO2, MBSP elevates from 9.35 CNY/kg to 10.41 CNY/kg."
8,Comparative analysis with other process,"3.3 Comparative analysis with other process A comparison for butanol producing cost with that of other producing processes is shown in Fig. 6 . Okoli and Adams (2014) reported the butanol producing cost from pine woody based on circulating fluidized bed gasification (Process 1) is 0.83 $/L in 2012 (base year). The butanol production cost from macroalgae based on circulating fluidized bed gasification (Process 2) reported by Okoli et al. (2016) is 1.97 $/L in 2014 (base year). The cost of butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass based on fermentation method (Process 3) is 1693 $/t researched by Jang and Choi (2018) in 2018 (base year). The cost of butanol production from switchgrass using acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation method (Process 4) is 1.58 $/L researched by Ave and Adams (2018) in 2015 (base year). According to Acetaldehyde Acetic Acide Chemical Industry (2014), butanol production cost through petrochemical route (Process 5) is 8.86 CNY/kg in 2014 (base year). Butanol production cost for the current work (Process 6) is 9.35 CNY/kg in 2017 (base year). The above butanol production costs were calculated in different base year and adjusted for inflation to the year 2018 according to Eq. (2). (2) BP C 2018 = B P C ref × CEPC I 2018 CEPC I ref where BPC refers to the butanol production cost. There are a range of values for butanol production cost. This is due to the difference of the butanol production technology, raw material, etc. Process 1 has the lowest butanol production cost, while process 2 has the largest butanol production cost. Although the butanol production cost of this work is larger than process 1, the lignocellulosic biomass to butanol process via BCLG can potentially be a good choice."
9,Conclusions,"A new lignocellulosic biomass to butanol process via BCLG is designed and modeled in Aspen Plus. The economic performance is assessed to give support for the investment and development of the proposed process. The butanol production rate, water demand and the whole energy efficiency are 6350 kg/h, 13 t/h and 44.31%, respectively. The total equipment cost, TCI and MBSP are 4.65 × 108 CNY, 1.53 × 109 CNY and 9.35 CNY/kg, respectively. The total equipment cost is primarily dominated by syngas compressors, CO2/H2S removal and sulfur recovery system. Sensitivity analysis show that pine sawdust price has the largest effect on the MBSP."
