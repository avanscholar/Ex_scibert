0,Introduction,"The group of REEs is formed by 17 chemical elements, encompassing the 15 lanthanides (La to Lu), and two pseudo-lanthanides (Sc and Y) (Iftekhar et al., 2018a). They have similar electronic settings, which result in a high-stability +3 oxidation state, and in general, they occur together in the same minerals (Costa et al., 2020). Among REEs, Ytterbium (Yb) is used in optical fibers, ceramics, luminescent materials, catalysts (Zheng and Xiong, 2011), and thermal barrier systems (Gupta and Krishnamurthy, 1992). The effluents discharge of these industrial activity such as oil refining, mining (Costa et al., 2020), electronic components manufacturing (Avdibegović et al., 2018), and electronic waste recycling (Huang et al., 2018) often contains different REEs, including Yb, in diluted solutions (low concentrations) that can contaminate the environment. Considering the great economic value, scarcity, and high industrial demand, the recovery of these metals from aqueous effluents is of environmental and economic interest. Economically, the recovery of REEs brings financial gains by reusing resources already extracted in a new production cycle (Dutta et al., 2016). Environmentally, the recovery of REEs from secondary sources minimizes impacts related to extraction, such as extensive use of land, energy and water, emission of greenhouse gases, and generation of large volumes of solid waste and liquid effluents (Cayumil et al., 2016). Conventional methods, including chemical co-precipitation (Petrov et al., 2001), filtration (Yaftian et al., 1998), solvent extraction (Fontana and Pietrelli, 2009), and ion exchange (Urbanski et al., 1996), can be applied for separation, purification, and preconcentrate of these REEs present in wastewater (Anastopoulos et al., 2016). In contrast, bioadsorption technology for recovery of REEs has been considered an alternative method due to its low operational cost, simplicity, and adequate ability to removal and recover REEs at low concentrations (Costa et al., 2019). Recently, studies have published the use of bioadsorbents for recovery of REEs as the brown alga Sargassum polycystum for La3+, Eu3+, and Yb3+ (Diniz and Volesky, 2005), brown alga Turbinaria conoides for La3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, and Yb3+ (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2010), and use of xanthan gum by anchoring metal ions zirconium (Zr@XG–ZA) to recover Sc3+, Nd3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ (Iftekhar et al., 2018b). Sericin and alginate particles are an alternative promising bioadsorbent for removal of toxic metals as Cu2+ and Zn2+ (da Silva et al., 2016), Cd2+ (Lima et al., 2017), Ni2+ and Pb2+ (Silva et al., 2017), Cr3+ and Cr6+ (de Andrade et al., 2018); recovery of precious metals as Pd2+, Au3+, Pt4+, and Ag+ (Santos et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2017); and recovery of rare-earth as La3+ (Costa et al., 2019). In the textile industry, during processing of silk yarns, much of the sericin is discarded along with the effluents generated in the process (Aramwit et al., 2012). About 50,000 tons of residual sericin are generated for every 400,000 tons of Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons processed per year (Saha et al., 2019). However, improper disposal of this protein in water resources can cause serious environmental damage due to the increased chemical and biochemical oxygen demand required for its degradation (Gulrajani et al., 2008). The use of sericin as a bioadsorbent of REEs can be an interesting application. However, the high solubility of sericin in water and its poor structural properties make it difficult to use as a bioadsorbent. Such limitations can be solved by combining sericin with other macromolecules (da Silva et al., 2016). Alginate, a branchless linear natural polysaccharide formed by the β-D-manuronic (M-block) and α-L-guluronic (G-block) acid monomers, is abundant in brown algal (Lopes et al., 2017). The way sodium alginate is extracted is not stable, so the use of protonated or calcium-saturated forms stabilizes the alginate hydrogel structures, making it less soluble in water and thus increasing the possibilities of application of this material (Augst et al., 2006). The easy copolymerization, crosslinking and blending between sericin and alginate results in protein products having improved structural, physical and chemical properties (Aramwit et al., 2012). The goal of this manuscript is to investigate ytterbium bioadsorption in batch system by SAPVA particles produced from sericin, extracted from silkworm cocoons, sodium alginate, and PVA. The incorporation of PVA as crosslinked in polymeric matrices is an interesting alternative because it is a biodegradable material that has hydroxyl groups (Lv et al., 2017). This crosslinking agent can bond silk sericin with sodium alginate and reduce the solubility of the particles formed (Santos et al., 2019). In this study, we evaluated for the first-time removal and recovery of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles from aqueous media. Effect of initial pH on the performance of Yb3+ ions uptake and Ca2+ ions release was investigated to improve the bioadsorption process. Kinetic study and ion exchange contribution were investigated to understand the limiting steps and kinetic mechanism of the process. Desorption study was carried out to evaluate ytterbium recovery and bioadsorbent regeneration. Finally, the components of the blend and the particles were characterized before and after ytterbium bioadsorption. The use of SAPVA particles for recovery of Yb3+ ions from aqueous medium, besides being an interesting solution for the disposal of sericin by textile industry, is also the first step towards the future recovery of ytterbium metal (scarce, expensive, and widely used in industrial activities) of industrial effluents that are generated in large volumes every day."
1,Material and method,
2,Materials and reagents obtained,"2.1 Materials and reagents obtained Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons was supplied by Bratac Silk Mills Company (Paraná/Brazil). Ytterbium nitrate pentahydrate ((Yb(NO3)3·5H2O) purity of 99.9% trace metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich Company) was the salt metal used at the bioadsorption experiments. The standard solution of ytterbium (1000 mg/L, purity of 99.9%) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Sodium alginate (molecular weight 155,000 g/mol) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (87–90% hydrolyzed, average molecular weight 30,000–70,000 g/mol) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company. Ammonium acetate (CH3COONH4, purity of 98.7%), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, purity of 25%), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, purity of 99%), acetic acid (C2H4O2, purity of 99.88%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, purity of 36.5%), and citric acid (C6H8O7, purity of 99.5%) were obtained from Dinamics Contemporary Chemistry. Nitric acid (HNO3, purity of 65%) was acquired from Synth. Ethanol (C2H6O, purity of 99.5%) and calcium chloride (CaCl2, purity of 96%) were obtained from Anidrol. The ultrapure water was obtained by the system reverse osmosis (OS20LXE, Gehaka)."
3,Preparation of bioadsorbent particles,"2.2 Preparation of bioadsorbent particles The silkworm cocoons were cleaned and cut to pieces of about 1.0 cm2. Sericin extraction from the silkworm cocoons was performed in a ratio of 0.04:1 (w/V) (0.04 kg of cocoon to 1 L of ultrapure water) by autoclaving (AV-18, Phoenix) at 393 K (100 kPa) for 40 min. After extraction, sericin solution was filtered to remove the fibroin fibers, stabilized at ∼298 K for 12 h, and frozen/thawed for 24 h for sericin fractionation. The supernatant containing proteins still insolubilized (peptides of greater molar weight) was filtered, heated by autoclaving at 393 K for 10 min to resolubilize the protein. Sericin solution was adjusted to 2.5% (w/V) with ultrapure water, according to da Silva et al. (2016). The blend was prepared by the addition of 2.0% (w/V) sodium alginate to the adjusted protein solution 2.5% (w/V), according to da Silva et al. (2016). Then the PVA crosslinking agent was added in the proportion of 0.5% (w/V) to the sericin and alginate blend formed, according to Santos et al. (2019). PVA is responsible for promoting the formation of covalent crosslinked between the polypeptide chains causing a change in the conformation of sericin chains, which reduces the solubility of particles produced in aqueous medium (Santos et al., 2019). The sericin/alginate/PVA blend was dripped into crosslinking solution of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, 4.1% (w/V), to form SAPVA particles, by the exchange Na+ ions present in the alginate structure by Ca2+ ions in solution. After this process, the particles produced were washed and thermally crosslinked at 313 K for 24 h and then 373 K for 24 h."
4,Bioadsorption experiments in batch,"2.3 Bioadsorption experiments in batch 2.3.1 pH bioadsorption The metallic speciation of ytterbium and calcium with the same concentration of 0.001 mol/L was simulated with the help of the Visual MINTEQ® 3.0 software. Effect of initial pH was evaluated at ytterbium initial concentration of 0.001 mol/L, particles dose of 10.0 g/L, and the pH ranging of 2–5. pH was controlled and adjusted using HNO3 solution (0.1–5.0 mol/L). The experiments were performed in a shaker (TE-4200, Tecnal) with continuous agitation at 21 rad/s, temperature of 298 K for 24 h. Yb3+ concentration was measured at atomic absorption spectroscopy, AAS (Shimadzu, AA-7000). Ca2+ concentration was quantified in the assay by AAS (PerkinElmer, AAnalyst 100). The equilibrium bioadsorption capacity ( q e ) was calculated by Equation (1). (1) q e = ( C 0 − C e ) · V W 2.3.2 Bioadsorption kinetics The kinetic experiments were carried out under constant magnetic stirring at 21 rad/s, ∼298 K, and particles dose of 10.0 g/L. The ytterbium initial concentrations evaluated were: 0.0005, 0.0011, and 0.0015 mol/L. The solutions pH was adjusted at 5.0 according to the pH effect experiment (see Section 2.3.1). Aliquots were collected periodically from 0 to 870 min and analyzed by AAS, to measure residual ytterbium ion concentration. The adsorption capacity at time t ( q t ) was determined by Equation (1), replacing the term metal concentration at equilibrium ( C e ) by metal concentration at time t ( C t ) To investigate the mechanism involved kinetic and mass transfer non-linear modeling were investigated. The pseudo first-order (PFO) (Lagergren, 1898), pseudo second-order (PSO) (Ho and McKay, 1998), intraparticle diffusion (ID) (Weber and Morris, 1963), Boyd (Boyd et al., 1947), and external mass transfer resistance (EMTR) (Puranik et al., 1999) models (see Supplementary material) were fitted to the obtained profiles for Yb3+ ions using the OriginPro® 2020b and Maple® 2020 softwares. Models fitness were evaluated by determination coefficient, R2 and corrected Akaike information criteria, AICc (Bonate and Steimer, 2011) (see Supplementary material). 2.3.3 Ion exchange evaluation Batch assays were performed to understand the ion exchange contribution that occurs in bioadsortive experiments. The experiment performed was similar to the kinetic experiments, except for the ytterbium initial concentration, which was defined as 0.0015 mol/L. In addition, a control experiment was conducted with ultrapure water under the same conditions. This experiment was carried out to determine the net ion exchange of Ca2+ ions in aqueous medium. To construct the concentration profile of Ca2+ light metal present in SAPVA particles prior to the bioadsortive process and the ytterbium rare-earth metal, aliquots were taken at pre-set times (0–870 min). The residual metal ion contents Yb3+ and Ca2+ were measured by AAS. 2.3.4 Desorption experiments SAPVA particles were loaded with ytterbium according to the procedure described in section 2.3.2, with an initial concentration of 0.0015 mol/L Yb3+. The ytterbium-loaded bioadsorbent was placed in contact with six eluents: nitric acid (0.1 mol/L), hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol/L), citric acid (0.1 mol/L), calcium chloride (0.1 mol/L), acetic acid (0.1 mol/L), and ethanol (5.7 mol/L). The experiments were performed in shaker at 21 rad/s, 298 K, and particles dose of 10.0 g/L, for 300 min (time needed to reach the equilibrium). Samples were determined by AAS. The desorption capacity ( q D ) and recovery efficiency ( % ) were determined by Equations (2) and (3), respectively. (2) q D = C D · V D W (3) r e c o v e r y e f f i c i e n c y = q D q e · 100 For the eluent with the best performance, the effect of eluent concentration was investigated in the efficiency of ytterbium ion release from SAPVA particles. In addition, desorption and bioadsorption kinetics were performed using the regenerated SAPVA particles, applying the same procedure described in the bioadsorption kinetics (see Section 2.3.2) and ion exchange evaluation experiments (see Section 2.3.3)."
5,Characterizations,"2.4 Characterizations The components of blend and particles produced were characterized. Isoelectric point (pHzpc) of bioadsorbent particles was obtained by electrokinetic analyzer (SurPASS, Anton Paar). Cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the SAPVA particles was performed using the adapted methodology described by Šoštarić et al. (2018), in which the sites capable of performing the Ca2+ exchange was saturated by NH4 + ions. The morphological characteristics and semiquantitative chemical composition of the bioadsorbent particles were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (LEO 440i, LEO Electron Microscopy). The medium diameter of 400 particles was performed by optical microscopy (DC4-456H, National Stereo Microscope). The identification of functional groups was obtained by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) from Quantachrome NOVA1200e conducted the surface area analysis. The apparent and true densities were obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry (AutoPore IV 9510, Micromeritics) and helium pycnometry (Accupyc II 1340, Micromeritics), respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Cation exchange capacity,"3.1 Cation exchange capacity SAPVA particles were prepared using the ionic gelation method by drip in Ca(NO3)2·4H2O solution, by exchanging Na+ ions present in the alginate structure by Ca2+ ions in aqueous medium. Given the possible importance of ion exchange mechanism, we quantified the CEC of the SAPVA particles. The quantities of Ca2+ ions released by SAPVA particles in ultrapure water at neutral pH (∼6.88) and CH3COONH4 1.0 mol/L solution at neutral pH (∼7.01) were 0.143 ± 0.003 and 0.598 ± 0.019 mol/kgSAPVA, respectively. The net amount of exchangeable Ca2+ ions was determined by the difference between the displacement of exchangeable ions in ultrapure water and CH3COONH4 solution. The CEC of the Ca2+ ions obtained by SAPVA particles was 0.455 ± 0.017 mol/kgSAPVA. It is noted that, even in ultrapure water, about 25% of the concentration of Ca2+ ions present in SAPVA particles was released (0.143 ± 0.003 mol/kgSAPVA). This behavior indicates a leaching process in which the Ca2+ ions captured during ionic crosslinking to form SAPVA particles were displaced from the surface of the bioadsorbent. The low concentration of Ca2+ ions released in ultrapure water indicates that this metallic ion has a high affinity with the bioadsorbent sites. In addition, a low variation in the pH of ultrapure water (∼6.49) and CH3COONH4 1.0 mol/L solution (∼7.17) was observed, indicating that there was no involvement of H3O+ ions in the competition for the sites occupied by the exchangeable Ca2+ cation. Therefore, the results obtained by CEC analysis highlight the characteristic of cationic exchanger of SAPVA particles, where the Ca2+ ions act as exchangeable cations in aqueous medium and indicate that this mechanism may be involved in the bioadsorption process of REEs (including Yb)."
8,Effect of initial pH,"3.2 Effect of initial pH Metallic speciation diagram for the various species of ytterbium and calcium in aqueous media is illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The diagram shows that at pH below 5.5, ytterbium is found in its soluble ionic form (Yb3+) and above this value, hydrolysis of this metal occurs (formation of YbOH2+). For calcium, more than 99% of Ca2+ ions exist in soluble ionic form up to pH 11.0. Above this pH value, Ca2+ hydrolysis occurs, forming the CaOH+ species. Therefore, the effect of initial pH on uptake Yb3+ ions and release Ca2+ ions by the SAPVA particles was performed in the pH range of 2.0–5.0, since in this range it is possible to ensure that the ytterbium and calcium are in their soluble ionic form. This ensures that any ytterbium removal does not occur by chemical precipitation. The effect of initial pH on the bioadsorption of ytterbium by SAPVA particles is shown in Fig. 1 (b). As the pH increases from 2.0 to 3.0, the amount of Yb3+ bioabsorbed increases and amount of Ca2+ released decreases. Yb3+ uptake and Ca2+ release reach a maximum at pH = 4.0, and remains stable up to pH = 5.0. In fact, at lower pH, the concentration of H3O+ is higher than Ca2+ and/or Yb3+, leading to superiority in complexation between H3O+ and –COO− groups. The increasing pH to 3.0, H3O+ concentration decreased and the release of Ca2+ and the bioadsorption of Yb3+ are increased. When the pH is higher than 3.0, only ion exchange between Ca2+ and Yb3+ occurs, as noted in plateau in the plots. The bioadsorption capacity and removal efficiency reaches the maximum value at pH 5.0 (0.096 ± 0.001 mol/kg and 96.18 ± 0.08%, respectively). In this condition, the amount of Ca2+ ions released by SAPVA particles was 0.143 ± 0.013 mol/kg. Whereas divalent cations, such as Ca2+, connects two adjacent –COO− groups to form an “egg-box” structure (Jiang et al., 2020), trivalent metal ions, such as Yb3+, coordinate with two adjacent carboxyl groups and one carboxyl groups of a different chain (Lapo et al., 2020). Therefore, the replacement of Ca2+ ions by Yb3+ ions during the bioadsorption process can be considered as evidence of the cation exchange mechanism between –COO− groups and H3O+, Ca2+ or Yb3+, depending on the pH of the medium. In addition, the zeta potential of SAPVA particles is shown in Fig. 1 (c). The pHzpc value for SAPVA particles is 4.4. At this pH the charge on the surface of particles is 0 mV. Below pH 4.4 the particles have positive charges on their surface and above that value negative charges. Chen et al. (2011) reported pHzpc of 3.5 for sericin particles, Torres et al. (2005) found pHzpc of 3.0 for alginate particles, and de Andrade et al. (2018) reported pHzpc of 3.0 for sericin and alginate particles. SAPVA particles showed raise uptake of Yb3+ ions with increasing pH of medium due to the negatively charged surface. Therefore, pH 5.0 was defined to carry out Yb3+ bioadsorption kinetics and ion exchange experiments by SAPVA particles."
9,Kinetics study,"3.3 Kinetics study Fig. 2 shows Yb3+ uptake by SAPVA particles at Yb3+ initial concentrations of 0.0005, 0.0011, and 0.0015 mol/L. The kinetic equilibrium time and ytterbium amount at equilibrium for Yb3+ uptake by SAPVA particles increased from 110 min and 0.044 mol / kg to 300 min and 0.142 mol/kg as Yb3+ initial concentration increased from 0.0005 to 0.0015 mol/L. Additionally, from the inclination of the kinetic curves, it is observed that initially the bioadsorption rate is high and it decreases as it approaches the equilibrium condition, since there is a reduction in the driving force as bioadsorption occurs. The PFO and PSO kinetic models, and ID, Boyd, and EMTR mass transfer models, were fitted to the experimental date (Fig. 1S) (see Supplementary Material) in order to assess the capacity of SAPVA particles on Yb3+ removal, as well as to determine mechanism involved in the bioadsorption process. The parameters obtained for the models are present in Table 1 . Table 1 and Fig. 1S (a) show that for all three Yb3+ initial concentrations studied, PFO and PSO models appropriately fitted to the experimental data of Yb3+ removal by SAPVA particles. The fitting results of Yb3+ uptake by SAPVA particles followed PFO with a slightly higher value of R 2 (0.986–0.996) and smaller AICc (−326.332 to −268.931) compared to PSO. Moreover, the bioadsorption capacity of Yb3+ ions at equilibrium predicted from PFO model agreed with the experimental data. This model was used to evaluated ytterbium bioadsorption by Turbinaria conoides (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2010) and Zr@XG–ZA (Iftekhar et al., 2018b). The PFO model was developed by Lagergren (1898) to evaluated the behavior of a q t versus t adsorption curve, where in the first minutes the adsorptive process occurs rapidly, and then this process varies slowly and asymptotically until equilibrium is reached. ID model was used to evaluate the steps involved in the bioadsorption process: intraparticle diffusion and film diffusion. This model satisfactorily fitted the experimental data of the second linear region of Fig. 1S (b) and Table 1. Moreover, the constant C obtained for the two highest Yb3+ concentrations (0.0011 and 0.0015 mol/L) was higher than obtained for the Yb3+ concentration of 0.0005 mol/L. This result indicates that at higher Yb3+ concentrations the boundary layer thickness is larger, justifying the longer times needed to reach equilibrium and consequently lower bioadsorption rate constant values obtained by the PFO model. In cases where fitting the ID model indicates the influence of another mechanism on the process, adjusting Boyd model, shown in Fig. 1S (c-1, c-2, and c-3), to the experimental data helps determine the slowest stage of the bioadsorption process (external diffusion or intraparticle diffusion). This adjustment resulted in good determination coefficients for the concentrations of 0.0005 and 0.0015 mol/L. In contrast, the adjustment of the Boyd model was not satisfactory for the concentration of 0.0011 mol/L (R 2 = 0.787). At all evaluated Yb3+ initial concentrations are possible to observe that the straight line provided by the linear fit did not intercept the origin, indicating the multilinearity of the bioadsorption process, where the ID does not act as the only controlling step. In addition, effective diffusion coefficients of the order of 10−10 to 10−11 magnitude indicate that ID is the limiting step of the process (Singh et al., 2005). In the Yb3+ bioadsorption process, it is observed that the effective diffusion coefficients are of the order of magnitude of 10−6, value 4 to 5 orders of magnitude greater than the reported. Thus, this is an indication that ID, although influencing the process, is not the limiting step in the investigated system. Lastly, the EMTR model (Fig. 1S (d)) assumes that the limiting step of the process is external film diffusion. Among all diffusion models, this was the best fit to the system evaluated, which can be observed by the high R 2 and low AICc obtained. Therefore, external resistance is the limiting step and governs the Yb3+ bioadsorption process in SAPVA particles."
10,Ion exchange mechanism,"3.4 Ion exchange mechanism According to CTC analysis, Ca2+ ions initially present in SAPVA particles can be exchanged for metal cations in solution. The investigation of the ion exchange mechanism was performed. Fig. 3 presents the behavior of Ca2+ ions release during the bioabsorption of the Yb3+ ions studied. From Fig. 3 it is possible to observe that the general behavior of the experiment is characteristic of cation exchange. The concentration of bioadsorbed cationic species decreases, while the concentration of light metal occurs. In this case, during the bioadsorption kinetics of Yb3+ ions, there was a large release of Ca2+ ions until the bioadsorption equilibrium time was reached in ∼300 min. de Andrade et al. (2018) employing the sericin/alginate particles for Cr3+ and Cr6+ biosorption under the same experimental conditions, but at pH 3.5, also observed a large Ca2+ release (∼210 min) during the process. To understand the mechanism of cation exchange, reaction stoichiometry is a fundamental aspect, presented in Equation (4). (4) 3 C a a d s 2 + + 2 Y b s o l 3 + ↔ 3 C a s o l 2 + + 2 Y b a d s 3 + Hence, for trivalent cation Yb3+, for each three displaced light metal cation Ca2+, two rare-earth metal cations are bioadsorbed, theoretically. Fig. 4 shows the theoretical and experimental kinetic profile of Ca2+ ions released during Yb3+ bioadsorption process. In this case, for the Yb3+ rare-earth metal cation studied, an equivalent amount of Ca2+ ions released in aqueous medium was observed compared to the suggested stoichiometry (2:3). Diniz and Volesky (2005) demonstrated that the exchange ion between Ca2+ ions for binding with La3+, Eu3+ and, Yb3+ ions in Sargassum polycystum occurs in a 1:1 ratio. Cation exchange mechanism was verified in the study by Vijayaraghavan et al. (2010) with the brown alga Turbinaria conoides, where the EDX analysis showed that the Ca2+ peaks on the material surface were reduced when new bioabsorbed La3+, Ce3+, Yb3+ and Eu3+ ions peaks were present. From the CEC quantification of the SAPVA particles, it was possible to calculate the release capacity of Ca2+ ions along the bioadsorption of Yb3+ ions. Fig. 5 illustrates this behavior. The amount of bioabsorbed Yb3+ increases and the amount of Ca2+ released decreases over time. Both the captured Yb3+ and released Ca2+ ions reach the plateau at an equilibrium time of ∼300 min and remain constant over time. The amount of Yb3+ bioabsorbed at equilibrium was 0.142 mol/kg and amount of Ca2+ released at equilibrium was 0.236 mol/kg, which is consistent with the proposed stoichiometry (2:3). During the Yb3+ solution experiment and ultrapure water control experiment, the pH was controlled and kept constant at 5.0, so that only the cation exchange between the Ca2+ and Yb3+ species occurs. Wang et al. (2013) evaluated the Nd3+ ions capture and Ca2+ ions release by alginate beads doping with silica (ALG/SiO2). The authors noted that amount of Nd3+ uptake and Ca2+ release at equilibrium were 0.840 and 1.250 mol/kg, respectively, in about 360 min. Wang et al. (2014) also found an equilibrium time of about 360 min during the evaluation of the cation exchange efficiency of Nd3+ (1.290 mol/kg) and Ca2+ (1.950 mol/kg) ions in calcium alginate/poly glutamic acid gel beads (ALG-PGA). On the other hand, Wu et al. (2010) observed a long time to reach equilibrium (about 1680 min) during the cation exchange of La3+ (0.890 mol/kg) and Ca2+ (1.120 mol/kg) in magnetic alginate beads. In this study, despite the smaller amount of Yb3+ ions captured and Ca2+ ions released at equilibrium, the equilibrium condition during ion exchange was achieved more quickly. The polymeric network flexibility of SAPVA particles, especially in the “egg-box” structure, may explain the exchange of species with different charges (Deze et al., 2012). In this structure, carboxyl groups on the G-block of a polymer chain bonds with the carboxyl groups on the G-block of adjacent polymer chain in the presence of Ca2+ divalent cations (Algothmi et al., 2013). The polymeric network flexibility and carboxyl groups accessibility allowed the coordination of the trivalent cations Yb3+ with two adjacent carboxyl groups and one carboxyl group of a different chain (Lapo et al., 2020). In addition, with the increase in the complexation of Yb3+ ions, this rearrangement of the polymeric network becomes more difficult due to the greater rigidity of the polymeric chains. Thus, the steric hindrance effect may occur with more Yb3+ ions captured by the SAPVA particles. Therefore, the mechanism that governs the bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles can be described by the reaction of cation exchange with Ca2+ ions, as well as steric hindrance effect, and other possible side reactions."
11,Desorption and regeneration study in batch,"3.5 Desorption and regeneration study in batch Desorption study was performed to select the most effective eluent for the Yb3+ elution on the surface of the SAPVA particles. The elution capacity of nitric acid (0.1 mol/L), hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol/L), citric acid (0.1 mol/L), calcium chloride (0.1 mol/L), acetic acid (0.1 mol/L), and ethanol (5.7 mol/L) was investigated (Fig. 6 ). HNO3 showed the highest Yb3+ ions desorption efficiency (85.86 ± 0.9%), followed by hydrochloric acid (80.2 ± 0.29%), citric acid (69.51 ± 0.58%), calcium chloride (17.07 ± 0.97%), acetic acid (6.56 ± 0.07%), and ethanol (0.52 ± 0.09%). According to Costa et al. (2020), the use of acids as eluent presents advantages, since acidic media are common effluents in industrial activities. Despite this, the use of acidic eluents can damage the surface of bioabsorbent materials and result in weight loss. Therefore, the concentration of HNO3, one of the most reported eluents in the literature for REEs desorption (Costa et al., 2020), was varied to assess its effect on the Yb3+ ions recovery. Experimental results in Table 2 showed that the elution percentage reached a value higher than 95% when the concentration of HNO3 is above 0.3 mol/L. This result is related to the high concentration of H3O+ ions, which successfully released the Yb3+ ions from the SAPVA particles. This behavior is supported by the results of the effect of initial pH on uptake Yb3+ and release Ca2+ (Fig. 1 (b)), which showed that there was low removal of Yb3+ ions at pH 2.0. In addition, despite the highly acidic medium, there was low mass loss of the SAPVA particles (around 3.10%). Xiong et al. (2006) found that the Yb3+ desorption efficiency in imino-diacetic acid resin reached 100% when the HCl concentration was above 2.0 mol/L. Zheng and Xiong (2011) also observed an increase in the efficiency of Yb3+ desorption with an increase in the concentration of HCl in weak acid cation exchange 110 resin, reaching a maximum elution efficiency of approximately 92% using HCl at 3.0 mol/L. The average elution efficiencies were statistically compared using the Tukey’s test by Statistica® 7.0 software. There was no significant difference among HNO3 concentrations from 0.3 to 1.0 mol/L. The mean elution obtained was statistically equivalent at a 95% confidence level. Therefore, the concentration of 0.3 mol/L HNO3 was chosen to desorption kinetics study of Yb3+ ions, as it is economically and environmentally viable to use the lowest concentration of acid eluents. Desorption kinetics of the SAPVA particles loaded with 0.0015 mol/L Yb3+ was performed with a 0.3 mol/L HNO3 solution (Fig. 7 ). Desorption efficiency and amount of Yb3+ ions desorbed were achieved in more than 99% and 0.142 mol/kg, respectively, in 40 min equilibrium time. Low equilibrium times were also observed in the desorption kinetics of Nd3+ in ALG/SiO2 (Wang et al., 2013) and ALG-PGA (Wang et al., 2014). The rapid desorption supports the statement that the bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles is governed by the external mass transfer resistance. In order to compare the performance of SAPVA/Yb system with the regenerated SAPVA particles (SAPVA/Yb-HNO3), bioadsorption kinetics at Yb3+ initial concentration of 0.0015 mol/L was performed. Fig. 8 shows the uptake of Yb3+ ions and release of Ca2+ ions by SAPVA/Yb-HNO3 particles as function of time. For the SAPVA/Yb-HNO3 system, the time required to reach equilibrium was 120 min. For the SAPVA/Yb system (Fig. 2), the equilibrium condition was reached in ∼300 min for the highest Yb3+ initial concentration (0.0015 mol/L). In addition, there was an increase in the capacity to capture Yb3+ ions and removal percentage to values of 0.152 mol/kg and 99.75%, in the SAPVA/Yb-HNO3 system. This increase was about 7.32% in relation to the SAPVA/Yb system. This increase in the bioadsorption capacity of the SAPVA particles after regeneration in an acidic environment occurred due to protonation and increase in the surface area promoted by HNO3, which resulted in the appearance of new sites on the bioadsorbent that present a greater interaction with Yb3+ ions, favoring ion exchange (Park et al., 2010). The Ca2+ ions were completely released from the SAPVA/Yb particles during the first regeneration cycle. It can be speculated that the positions of Ca2+ ions in the polymeric network of spherical particles of SAPVA were replaced by H3O+ ions. In this way, the contamination by Ca2+ ions during the ionic crosslinking of the SAPVA particles can be eliminated by means of acid pretreatment before the Yb3+ ions bioadsorption, improving the bioadsorptive capacity of the material and reducing the equilibrium time. To evaluate the experimental data on the bioadsorption of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA/Yb-HNO3 particles, the kinetic fit models of PFO, PSO, ID, Boyd, and EMTR were applied, as shown in Fig. 2S (see Supplementary Material). The kinetic parameters obtained in the fit models, are present in Table 1S (see Supplementary Material). The external resistance to mass transfer can be attributed as the main controlling step in the bioadsorption of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA/Yb-HNO3 particles. A similar conclusion was found for the SAPVA/Yb particles."
12,Bioadsorbent characterization,"3.6 Bioadsorbent characterization The SEM micrographs of pure PVA (a and b), sericin/alginate particles (c and d), SAPVA particles (e and f), and SAPVA/Yb particles (g and h) were obtained using electron microscopy technique scanning (Fig. 9 ). Fig. 9 (c) and (e) shows that the production process of sericin/alginate and SAPVA particles resulted in a bioabsorbent material of approximately spherical and low porous shape. After bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions there was no significant change in the shape of the particles, however, some cracks were formed on its surface, as shown in Fig. 9 (g). From the surface micrograph of the sericin/alginate and SAPVA particles with 1500x magnification (Fig. 9 (d) and (f)), it was possible to observe that the particles showed homogeneity in their composition. Addition of the crosslinking agent PVA (Fig. 9 (a and b)) to the blend of sericin/alginate did not change the homogeneity of the particles produced. After bioadsorption of Yb3+ ions, it can be seen from Fig. 9 (h) that there was an increase in surface roughness. The low porosity of bioabsorbent material verified from the analysis of Fig. 9 (d), (f), and (h) corroborate with the results of porosity and surface area of bioabsorbent particles. In fact, low porosity values (11.631, 9.947, and 13.019% for sericin/alginate, SAPVA, and SAPVA/Yb particles, respectively) and low specific area values (0.063, 0.054, and 0.052 m2/g for sericin/alginate, SAPVA, and SAPVA/Yb particles, respectively) were verified by analyzing the data reported in Table 4 . EDX analysis (Table 3 ) showed that the SAPVA particles produced have in their composition the elements carbon, oxygen, and calcium with atomic percentage of 41.91, 54.99, and 3.11%, respectively. In addition, according to the FTIR analysis, functional groups formed by the elements nitrogen and hydrogen were verified. After bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions, the atomic percentage on the surface of the particles was 46.83% carbon, 50.39% oxygen, 2.18% calcium, and 0.60% ytterbium. The presence of Yb3+ ions on the surface of SAPVA/Yb particles indicates that there was, in fact, bioadsorption. The decrease in the atomic percentage of calcium element after bioadsorption was equivalent to the atomic percentage of ytterbium element captured by particles in comparison with the proposed stoichiometry (2:3). These results showed that the bioadsorptive process can be governed by ion exchange of Yb3+ ions for Ca2+ ions. Micrographs captured by optical microscopy at 10x magnification were evaluated by ImageJ® software to obtain the medium diameter of samples of 400 particles. Medium diameters of 1.251 ± 0.095, 1.295 ± 0.113, and 1.218 ± 0.082 mm (Table 4) were obtained for sericin/alginate, SAPVA, and SAPVA/Yb, respectively. In addition, the reduction in apparent density observed for the SAPVA/Yb particles indicates that the Yb3+ ions were bioadsorbed on surface and not only in pores of the bioadsorbent, causing an increase in the particle volume. The increase in the porosity of particles after Yb3+ ions removal corroborates this hypothesis. The subtle variation in the true density also reveals less pore filling, since the analysis disregards the volume of empty pores. In fact, the kinetic analysis of the ytterbium bioadsorption process in SAPVA particles, showed that despite the intraparticle diffusion influencing the ytterbium bioadsorption process, external diffusion is the limiting step of the process. Analyzes of identification of functional groups were carried out to comparatively evaluate the structure of the components of blend (sericin (a), alginate (b), and PVA (c)), sericin/alginate particles (d), SAPVA particles (e), and SAPVA/Yb particles (e1) particles, using the FTIR technique (Fig. 10 ). The spectra of sericin/alginate particles (d), SAPVA particles (e), and SAPVA/Yb particles (e−1) are very similar. In these spectra, four important functional groups, Amide A, I, II, and III, are shown through the peaks (Barth, 2007). The amide A band observed between 3310 and 3270 cm−1 occurs due to the stretching vibration of the –NH bond of amide group. However, the peaks found in this work close to this band were 3421.47, 3429.14, and 3443.12 cm−1 for the sericin/alginate, SAPVA and SAPVA/Yb particles, respectively. This behavior is related to the overlapping of the –N–H bond identified in sericin powder (3306.49 cm−1) to the hydroxylated amino acid residues (stretching vibration in –OH groups) identified in alginate (3435.99 cm−1) and PVA (3450.31 cm−1). The presence of bands corresponding to 1700–1600, 1582–1504, and 1300 - 1200 cm−1 are related to the amide I (–CO and –NH), amide II (–NH and –CN), and amide III (–CN and –NH), respectively (Teramoto et al., 2008). From Fig. 10, it is possible to observe that the functional groups amide I, II, and III identified in the sericin/alginate and SAPVA particles produced in this study are related to the presence of the protein sericin. This powder protein exhibited peaks at 1646.31, 1527.81, and 1239.07 cm−1 for amide bands I, II, and III, respectively. In addition, the presence of alginate in the composition of particles increased the peaks of amide band I interval, indicating that it is essential for the secondary structure organized intra and intermolecular. As shown in Fig. 10 (b), pure sodium alginate showed bands at 1608.47 cm−1 (–COO−) and 3435.99 cm−1 (–OH), which are characteristic of stretching vibration of carboxyl groups in sodium alginate (Ribeiro et al., 2004). The vibration of amide I and II are the most frequently used for analysis of the secondary structure of protein chain (Barth, 2007). Sericin consists mainly of random coil and a small amount of β-sheets structures. Depending on the structure of sericin molecules present, their solubility is affected, and greater the amount of sericin molecules has β-sheets structure, lower solubility of sericin in aqueous media (Padamwar and Pawar, 2004). The reduction in solubility of sericin/alginate particles after addition of 0.5% (m/V) of crosslinking agent PVA to the blend, reported by Santos et al. (2019), may be related to the transformation of random coil structures into β-sheets structures. In fact, the higher absorption intensity of amide I and amide II groups observed through Fig. 10 by SAPVA particles, compared to sericin/alginate particles, may be related to the increase in the amount of β-sheets structures after chemical crosslinking. Comparing the spectra (c) and (c-1) in Fig. 10, after bioadsorption of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles, there was a displacement in the peaks corresponding to amide I (1644.89–1650.60 cm−1) and hydroxyl (3429.14–3443.12 cm−1), which indicates the involvement of these functional groups in the removal of Yb3+ ions. In this way, FTIR spectra provide additional evidence that the bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles is governed by ion exchange mechanism between carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and Yb3+ ions. The proposed ion exchange mechanism between (–R–COO)2Ca and (–R–O)2Ca groups and Yb3+ ions is shown in Equation (5) (Zhang et al., 2016) and (6) (Gok, 2014), respectively. The proposed mechanism of SAPVA particles interaction with Yb3+ ions is depicted in Fig. 11 .

13,Conclusions and future prospects,"The bioadsorbent (SAPVA), prepared by crosslinking sericin/alginate blend with PVA, was first evaluated for ytterbium bioadsorption. The uptake of Yb3+ and release of Ca2+ indicate pH value of 5.0 as optimal for bioadsorption. The kinetic study revealed that the ytterbium bioadsorption was best described by PFO model and governed by external diffusion. Ion exchange with Ca2+ was proposed as a possible bioadsorption mechanism. Complete desorption of Yb3+ ions was achieved using 0.3 mol/L HNO3 as the eluting agent. Additionally, complete release of Ca2+ ions in the regenerated particles improved the bioadsorptive capacity and equilibrium time. The characterization of SAPVA particles showed that even after addition of crosslinking agent PVA, the bioadsorbent had a low porosity, low surface area, and homogeneous composition and distribution. These properties did not show significant changes in the post-bioadsorption particles of Yb3+ ions. FTIR analysis showed evidence that the bioadsorption process of Yb3+ ions by SAPVA particles is governed by ion exchange mechanism between (–R–COO)2Ca and (–R–O)2Ca groups and Yb3+ ions. Overall, the results suggest that SAPVA particles are promising for removal and recovery of rare-earth ions, especially Yb3+, in aqueous solutions. Therefore, further investigations are strongly encouraged for future studies, such as: 1) Equilibrium and thermodynamic study for better understanding the characteristics of the bioadsorption process. 2) Regeneration cycles to assess the reuse of SAPVA particles and Yb3+ ions recovery. 3) Selective recovery of Yb3+ ions in the presence of common organic and inorganic contaminants and other REEs, using the SAPVA particles proposed in this work. 4) Fixed-bed column studies for scale-up. 5) Application of SAPVA particles in the recovery of REEs from real industrial effluents. 6) Life Cycle Assessment to investigate the environmental performance of SAPVA particles."
