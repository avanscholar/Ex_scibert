0,Introduction,"By electrochemical water splitting, electrical energy can be converted and stored as hydrogen (H2) fuel for more versatile applications [1, 2]. In conventional water splitting cells, the generation of H2 from protons reduction on cathode is usually accompanied by the oxidation of water into oxygen (O2) on anode. In general, H2 are the desired products of electrochemical water splitting, while the O2 products have relatively low application value. The simultaneous generation of O2 and H2 in water splitting cell could result in the separation issue of pure H2 products. In theory, the oxidation of water into O2 can be achieved through a direct 4-electrons oxidation pathway ( Reaction 1) or an indirect 2-electrons oxidation pathway (Reactions 2 and 3) [3, 4]. 4-electrons oxidation pathway: O2 (g) + 4H+ (aq) + 4e- → 2H2O (l), E ʘ= 1.229 V vs. RHE (1) 2-electrons oxidation pathway: H2O2 (aq) + 2H+ (aq) + 2e- →2H2O (l), E ʘ= 1.776 V vs. RHE (2) 2H2O (l)+ O2 (g) + 4e- → 2H2O2 (aq), E ʘ= 0.695 V vs. RHE (3) It is apparent that the 4-electrons pathway of water oxidation is preferentially initiated in thermodynamics relative to the 2-electrons oxidation pathway. However, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formed from the 2-electrons oxidation of water is more useful than the O2 from the 4-electrons oxidation of water. As is well known, H2O2 is an important chemical that widely used in paper, medicament and environmental protection industries [5, 6]. In this respect, if the oxidation of water be purposely manipulated towards 2-electrons pathway, we can produce H2O2 and H2 simultaneously in an electrochemical water splitting cell for more versatile applications. Significantly, due to the competitive presence of 4-electrons oxidation of water both in thermodynamics and kinetics, it is hard to achieve 2-electrons oxidation of water directly on anode with high Faraday efficiency to produce H2O2. But excitingly, some pioneering reports have demonstrated that the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 from 2-electrons water oxidation can be indirectly achieved in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte [7-11]. The general mechanism of H2O2 synthesis can be expressed as Reactions 4 and 5. Specifically, the electrochemical oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 − be firstly initiated on anodes, then the 2-electrons oxidation of water into H2O2 is accomplished with the initiation of HCO4 − [11-14]. HCO3 - (aq) + H2O (l) → HCO4 - (aq) + 2H+ (aq) + 2e- (4) HCO4 - (aq) + H2O (l) → H2O2 (aq) + HCO3 - (aq) (5) From Reactions 4 and 5, we could know that the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 from water oxidation is closely related to the oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 − on anodes. Meanwhile, above mechanism suggests that H2O2 can be electrochemically produced in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte using suitable anodes with inert property of H2O2 decomposition and high activity of HCO3 − oxidation. It is noteworthy that H2O2 is not stable enough in alkaline aqueous solution, and HCO3 − has been found to be activator for the decomposition of H2O2 into some active oxygen species (such as, •OH, 1O2) [15-17]. In addition, since the electrochemical oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 − to produce H2O2 only be initiated at relatively high potential (E≥1.80 V vs. RHE) [7-11], while the electrochemical oxidation of H2O2 into O2 can be happened at lower potential (2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 2e− → 2H2O2 (aq), E ʘ= 0.695 V vs. RHE) [3, 18]. These mean that the simultaneous presence of H2O2 decomposition in the cell during the production of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte, and thus the H2O2 products cannot be accumulated to high concentration in theory. Furthermore, the purity of the electrochemically produced H2O2 is not high enough as the commercial H2O2 due to the presence of HCO3 −. Nevertheless, the present researches are mainly preoccupied with the development of anode materials for electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte [7-11], but neglected above objective information of H2O2 decomposition and low-purity. To illumine the research direction and application prospect of electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte, it is necessary to explore the in-situ utilization of the low-purity H2O2 products in cell. Graphite electrode has advantages of low-cost of preparation, good stability in weak alkali solutions and inert property of H2O2 decomposition, graphite electrode may be suitable anode for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte. Inspired by the concept of dual-functional photocatalysis [19, 20], we assembled an electrochemical cell using graphite electrodes and HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte, and investigated its dual-functional water splitting to produce H2 on cathode and achieve electro-Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants in anode side simultaneously. Through the initiation of HCO3 − oxidation into HCO4 − on graphite anode, H2O2 was electrochemically produced attaining a high concentration of ∼950 ppm at 3.0 V vs. RHE. Taking the function of HCO3 − in activating H2O2 into •OH, the resultant H2O2 was in-situ used to achieve electro-Fenton-like degradation of methylene blue and phenol effectively. Meanwhile, pure H2 was produced from protons reduction on graphite cathode with ∼99 % Faraday efficiency during the in-situ utilization of H2O2 for organic degradation. Our work provides an inspiring dual-functional water splitting as well as electro-Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants in alkaline solution, which illumine the application prospect of electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing electrolyte."
1,Experimental section,
2,Electrochemical production of H2O2 and H2,"2.1 Electrochemical production of H2O2 and H2 The electrochemical production of H2O2 and H2 was performed on a CHI 760E workstation with a three-electrode cell. The working electrode and counter electrode were graphite sheets (1 cm × 2 cm × 0.08 cm. 99.99%), and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (Shanghai INESA Scientific Instrument) was used as the reference electrode. The measured potentials (vs. Ag/AgCl) were calibrated into the potentials vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following Nernst equation: (1) E R H E = E θ A g / A g C l + E A g / A g C l + 0.0592 p H where Eθ Ag/AgCl = 0.197 V, pH is the pH value of electrolyte. The pH of each electrolyte was detected using a pH meter, and the pH of 1.0 M K2CO3, 1.0 M KHCO3, 1.0 M Na2SO4, 1.0 M Na2HPO4 and 1.0 M NaH2PO4 were 10.8, 8.2, 6.9, 8.5 and 3.5, respectively."
3,Detection of H2O2 and H2,"2.2 Detection of H2O2 and H2 After the electrochemical reaction, the formation and concentration of H2O2 in electrolyte were doubly checked though commercial H2O2 testing strips (HangZhou Lohand Biological Co., LTD) and TiOSO4 UV-vis spectrometer method. For the H2O2 strip testing method, H2O2 strip was directly put into the electrolyte for 10 s, and the color of H2O2 strip would be changed if the electrolyte contains H2O2. By the comparison to standard color card, the concentration of H2O2 in electrolyte was determined. For UV-vis spectrometer method testing, 2 mL of electrolyte was firstly collected from cell, and then 1.0 M H2SO4 was added into the electrolyte to adjust it to acidity. After that, 400 μL of 0.1 M TiOSO4 was mixed with the electrolyte for 10 min, the concentration of H2O2 in electrolyte was finally determined at the 402 nm of UV-vis spectrometer (Persee TU-1901, China) based on Bouguer-Lambert-Beer's law (see Fig. S1). At 3.0 V vs. RHE, the production amount of H2 in cell was detected using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph. The cell was gas-tightly treated to meet the gas chromatography detection. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was calculated according to following equation. (2) η ( H 2 O 2 ) = amount of generated H 2 O 2 theoretical amount of H 2 O 2 × 100 % The Faraday efficiency of H2O2 production on graphite anode at different potentials in 1.5 M KHCO3 was further investigated on the basis of the actual production of H2O2 and theoretical production of H2O2. The theoretical production of H2O2 was calculated using the recorded charge assuming it all originate from the 2-electrons oxidation of water into H2O2. The actual production of H2O2 was determined by TiOSO4 UV-vis spectrometer method. The equation is as follows. (3) η ( H 2 O 2 ) = amount of generated H 2 O 2 theoretical amount of H 2 O 2 × 100 %"
4,Electrochemical degradation of methylene blue and phenol,"2.3 Electrochemical degradation of methylene blue and phenol The electrochemical degradation of methylene blue and phenol were conducted on a CHI 760E workstation using constant or pulsed potential mode. The graphite sheet working electrode has an exposed geometric surface area of 6 cm2 (2 cm × 3 cm × 0.08 cm. 99.99%), and 50 mL of electrolyte with graphite electrode were placed for 30 min to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. During the electrochemical degradation, a constant stirring was applied with 100 rpm to the electrolyte. After different degradation times, 3 mL of electrolyte was collected from cell to detect the changes of methylene blue or phenol concentration. The changes of methylene blue concentration were detected by UV-vis spectrometer method (see Fig. S2). The changes of phenol concentration were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu liquid chromatography, LC-16). The detection wavelength of liquid chromatography was set at 270 nm, and 50% acetonitrile and 50% water was used as mobile phase. The TOC removal was checked by TOC analyzer (Shimadzu, TOC-L CPH) through adding sufficient 1.0 M H2SO4 to remove the inorganic carbon in electrolyte. In addition, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of hydroxyl radical (•OH) in KHCO3/H2O2 and K2CO3/H2O2 solution were detected by a Bruker EMX Plus-10/12 EPR spectrometer. Before and after electrochemical reaction, the 13C NMR signals of HCO3 −and HCO4 −in KHCO3 electrolyte were detected by NMR instrument (Bruker BioSpin, 600M HZ) at 25°C."
5,Results and discussion,"To confirm the feasibility that H2O2 and H2 can be simultaneously synthesized in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte using graphite electrodes, commercial graphite sheets were used directly as anode and cathode to conduct the investigations. Fig. 1 a shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of graphite sheet anode in 1.0 M KHCO3, NaH2PO4, K2CO3, Na2SO4 and Na2HPO4 aqueous electrolyte. It is apparent that the oxidation current on graphite sheet electrode in five kinds of electrolytes is obviously different, which ranks as follow: K2CO3 > KHCO3 > Na2SO4 > Na2HPO4 > NaH2PO4. Based on the LSV observation, a constant potential of 3.0 V vs. RHE was applied on the graphite sheet anode for 60 min reaction in above electrolytes (the current vs. time data shown in Fig. S3 in ESI). During the constant potential reaction, continuous gas evolution was observed on the graphite sheet cathode, but significantly weaker gas evolution on graphite sheet anode. Though gas chromatograph detecting, the gas products from graphite cathode was confirmed to be pure H2, and the Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution reaction was found to be ∼99% (inset of Fig. 1 b). After the constant potential reaction, the presence and concentration of H2O2 in electrolytes were doubly checked though commercial H2O2 testing strips and TiOSO4 spectrophotometric method (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1 c, the color of H2O2 testing strip and TiOSO4 solution was obviously changed after contacting with the as-reacted K2CO3 and KHCO3 electrolytes, but insignificant changes after contacting with the as-reacted Na2SO4, Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 electrolytes. The color changes of H2O2 testing strip and TiOSO4 solution indicated that H2O2 was electrochemically produced in K2CO3 and KHCO3 electrolytes after the constant potential reaction. Further quantitative detecting found that about 822 ppm H2O2 was produced in the K2CO3 electrolyte, and about 325 ppm H2O2 in the KHCO3 electrolyte. In the Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 and Na2SO4 electrolytes, negligible H2O2 was detected. The Faraday efficiency of H2O2 production on the graphite anode at different potentials in 1.5 M KHCO3 was shown in Fig. S4. At 2.0 V vs. RHE, since the reaction was not completely initiated, the Faraday efficiency of H2O2 production on graphite anode was very low (∼1%). But at 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 V vs. RHE, the Faraday efficiency of H2O2 production on graphite anode was improved to ∼24%, which indirectly suggested that the Faraday efficiency of oxygen evolution on graphite anode was about 76%. As mentioned in Introduction section, previous reports have demonstrated that the formation of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte is indirectly happened. The electrochemical oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 − is firstly achieved on anodes, and then the 2-eletrons oxidation of water into H2O2 be initiated by HCO4 − (see Reactions 4 and 5) [11-14]. Since the conversion reaction of HCO4 − and H2O with H2O2 and HCO3 − is partial reversible reaction [12], namely, HCO4 − (aq) + H2O (l) ↼ ⇁ H2O2 (aq) + HCO3 − (aq), HCO4 − and HCO3 − should exist in solution simultaneously. To verify the formation mechanism of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolyte, we contrastively detected the 13C NMR signal for the KHCO3 electrolyte before and after 60 min reaction at 3.0 V vs. RHE. As displayed Fig. 1 d, for the KHCO3 electrolyte after constant potential reaction, the 13C NMR signals of HCO3 − (δ=160.6) and HCO4 − (δ=158.5) were simultaneously detected, while only the 13C NMR signal of HCO3 − was observed in the electrolyte before the reaction [12, 17]. Further investigations indicated that the oxidation current on graphite sheet electrode as well as the production amount of H2O2 at 3.0 V vs. RHE are positively correlated with the concentration of K2CO3 and KHCO3 electrolytes ( Fig. 1 e to 1 h). From above investigations, it is certain that H2O2 and H2 can be electrochemically synthesized in KHCO3 or K2CO3 aqueous electrolytes using graphite anode. Significantly, to the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first observation about the synthesis of H2O2 using graphite anode as well as higher concentration of H2O2 formed in K2CO3 aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 2 a and 2 b are the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of graphite sheet anode in 1.0 M KHCO3 and K2CO3 aqueous electrolyte at different potentials, respectively. At 1.8 V vs. RHE, an obvious semicircle arc and linear curve are observed in the Nyquist plots of graphite sheet electrode both in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes. Such form of Nyquist plots is the typical EIS signals that be usually observed on the electrode having obviously electrochemical and concentration polarizations [3]. At higher potentials (1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 V vs. RHE), the Nyquist plots of electrode were changed significantly, in which more semicircle arcs were shown. From the electrochemical AC impedance principle [3], it could judge that more than one electrochemical reaction be happened on anode when the potential higher than 1.8 V vs. RHE. At 1.8 V vs. RHE, O2 evolution was obviously observed, indicating the presence of water oxidation. But based on the thermodynamic and kinetic judgements, it is impossible to initiate the oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 − at 1.8 V vs. RHE since the standard potential of this reaction (E ʘ) is 1.80 V vs. RHE. When the potential higher than 1.8 V vs. RHE, HCO3 − can be oxidized into HCO4 −, and then H2O2 will be produced by the reaction of water with HCO4 − (Reactions 4 and 5). In the other hand, H2O2 can be electrochemically oxidized into O2 when the potential higher than 0.695 V vs. RHE in thermodynamics (2H2O (l) + O2 (g) + 2e− → 2H2O2 (aq), E ʘ= 0.695 V vs. RHE) [3]. Contrastive LSV investigations found that the as-formed H2O2 in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolyte is indeed electrochemically oxidized by the graphite sheet anode when the potential higher than 0.9 V vs. RHE ( Fig. 2 c and 2 d). In summary, the semicircle arcs of graphite sheet anode's Nyquist plots at higher potential than 1.8 V vs. RHE can be attributed to the oxidation of water into O2, the oxidation of HCO3 − into HCO4 −, and the oxidation of H2O2 into O2. On the basis of above observations, we know that H2O2 can be electrochemically synthesized in HCO3 − or CO3 2−-containing aqueous electrolyte, but the electrochemical oxidation of H2O2 is simultaneously happened during the production of H2O2. It is well known that H2O2 is not stable enough in alkaline aqueous solution, and which was clearly confirmed by our detection. The gradual decomposition of the electrochemically produced H2O2 in K2CO3 and KHCO3 aqueous solution was observed, indicating that these H2O2 products cannot be stored up for long time (Fig. S5). Accordingly, it is difficult to produce high concentration of H2O2 through the electrochemical approach in HCO3 − or CO3 2−-containing aqueous electrolytes. The longer time synthesis investigations proved that the resultant H2O2 in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes is not durative increasing with reaction time. As indicated in Fig. 3 a, the concentration of resultant H2O2 in 1.5 M K2CO3 is obviously increased at the initial 60 min of electrochemical reaction at 3.0 V vs. RHE, and reached the maximum (∼950 ppm). In the subsequent 60 min of reaction at the same potential, the concentration of H2O2 did not raises with reaction time and even decreased. Similar observation was found in the KHCO3 system ( Fig. 3 b) and some previous reports related to the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in KHCO3 electrolyte [9-11]. It should be stated that the change of graphite anode after the constant reaction at 3.0 V vs. RHE is very slight (Fig. S6), excluding that the slow production of H2O2 in latter reaction is caused by the inactivation of graphite anode. For the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes, in addition to the unsustainable accumulation of H2O2 products, the purity of resultant H2O2 is also unsatisfactory due to the presence of KHCO3 or K2CO3. To fulfill the fundamental purpose of electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 − or CO3 2−-containing aqueous electrolytes, it is significant to explore the in-situ utilization of the low-purity H2O2 products. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility that the degradation of organic pollutants through H2O2 catalysis and the synchronous synthesis of H2 from proton reduction in the electrochemical cell with KHCO3 or K2CO3 electrolyte and graphite electrodes. To produce suitable amount of H2O2 for the obvious degradation of methylene blue or phenol, thus the investigations were conducted at 3 V vs. RHE. Fig. 3 c and 3 d exhibit the H2 evolution amount from graphite cathode as well as the degradation rate of methylene blue (50 ppm) or phenol (20 ppm) in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolyte at 3.0 V vs. RHE, respectively. Both in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes, except for stable production of H2, the degradation rate of methylene blue or phenol gradually increased with the reaction time (see Fig. 3 c, 3 d, S2 and S7). As contrasts, in the Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 and Na2SO4 electrolytes, lower degradation rate of methylene blue or phenol was observed at same potential (Fig. S8), suggesting the formation of H2O2 in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes plays a positive role in methylene blue and phenol degradation. Additionally, although the production amount of H2O2 in K2CO3 electrolyte is higher than that in KHCO3 electrolyte at same conditions (see Fig. 1 c, 1 g and 1 h), the degradation efficiency of methylene blue and phenol in K2CO3 electrolyte are lower than that in KHCO3 electrolyte. According to the salt hydrolysis theory, KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolyte both are contained strong alkaline ion (K+) and weak acid radicals (HCO3 − and CO3 2−). Just due to the difference of hydrolysis degree, the content of HCO3 − in KHCO3 electrolyte is higher than that in K2CO3 electrolyte. So, it can be inferred that the simultaneous presence of H2O2 and HCO3 − could initiate the degradation of methylene blue or phenol efficiently. In previous works related to H2O2/HCO3 − co-catalysis, HCO3 − has been demonstrated to be of the function of activating H2O2 into active radicals (such as, •OH, 1O2) for the degradation of organic pollutants [15-17]. Above observations illumine the environmental application prospect of the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in KHCO3 and K2CO3 electrolytes. It is noteworthy that the degradation of organic pollutants with H2O2/HCO3 − co-catalysis is typical homogeneous reaction, and the degradation rate of organic pollutants is usually dependent on the supply rate of active radicals [15-17]. As for the degradation of methylene blue or phenol in KHCO3 electrolyte, H2O2 is continuously produced when a constant and suitable potential applied on the graphite anode, but the activation and conversion of H2O2 into active radicals may be not seamless connection with the production of H2O2 as expected. Hence, the degradation efficiency of methylene blue and phenol in KHCO3 electrolyte could be improved through optimizing the production and activation balance of H2O2. Fig. 4 a and 4 b show the degradation rate comparison of methylene blue and phenol in KHCO3 electrolyte under constant potential and pulsed potential mode, respectively. Two kinds of potential application modes and their current response curves are shown in Fig. 4 c and Fig. S9a. Compared to the degradation under constant potential mode, higher degradation efficiency of methylene blue and phenol was achieved when a pulsed potential mode with turn-on/turn-off time ratio of 1/2 be applied on graphite anode. Such an obvious difference can be explained from the aspects of the production and activation balance of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 4 c, under constant potential mode, the production of H2O2 is continuous, while the consumption of H2O2 for methylene blue and phenol degradation is not equally fast due to the rate-limiting of H2O2 activation and conversion into active radicals. The excessive H2O2 in KHCO3 electrolyte will be electrochemically decomposed in O2, and results in H2O2 products wasting. Under the pulsed potential mode, interval turn-off times of potential were set during the production of H2O2, which are propitious to the activation and conversion of H2O2 into active radicals for degradation reaction. Since no power consumption during the turn-off times of potential, the utilization of H2O2 products is more efficient and thus more energy-efficient (Fig. S9b). Fig. 4 d shows the residual percent of 50 ppm methylene blue in 1.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte after the same potential application time (3.0 V vs. RHE for 15 min) but different potential turn-on/turn-off time ratios (Fig. S10). It is obvious that the residual percent of methylene blue is proportional to the potential turn-on/turn-off time interval ratio. In other words, setting longer turn-off time interval after the potential turn-on can improve the utilization of H2O2 products for methylene blue degradation. Based on this finding, a turn-on/turn-off time ratio of 1/6 was applied to conduct the electrochemical degradation of different concentrations of methylene blue or phenol in 1.5 M KHCO3. Owing to the presence of interval turn-off times for the activation and conversion of H2O2 into active radicals, this pulsed potential mode shows effective degradation for methylene blue and phenol ( Fig. 4 e to 4 h and Fig. S11). Above results indicated that the degradation efficiency of methylene blue or phenol in KHCO3 electrolyte under pulsed potential mode is higher than that under constant potential mode. To understand the degradation mechanism of methylene blue and phenol in KHCO3 electrolyte, we investigated the active species for degradation reaction. As observed in above Fig. 3 c, 3 d and Fig. S8, the simultaneous presence of H2O2 and HCO3 − is the prerequisite for efficient initiating the degradation of methylene blue and phenol. Took methylene blue as a model, further investigations displayed that the degradation of methylene blue cannot be initiated in methylene blue/KHCO3 solution, methylene blue/H2O2, methylene blue/H2O2/NaH2PO4, methylene blue/H2O2/Na2SO4, methylene blue/H2O2/Na2HPO4 solution (no electrochemical reaction), but only be initiated in methylene blue/KHCO3/H2O2 solution ( Fig. 5 a and Fig. S12). Furthermore, the degradation of methylene blue in 3.0 M tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) aqueous electrolyte with graphite sheet electrode at 3.0 V vs. RHE is almost negligible ( Fig. 5 b). But in pure methylene blue aqueous electrolyte with the same electrode, potential and reaction time, the degradation of methylene blue was observed despite it only be 22% degradation rate. At 3.0 V vs. RHE, •OH can be electrochemically produced through water oxidation (H2O → •OH + H+ + e−, E ʘ=2.73 V vs. RHE). Since t-BuOH is a typical •OH-scavenging agent [16, 21, 22], above degradation rate difference suggests that the degradation of methylene blue involved •OH as an active radical. To further confirm this observation, a comparative degradation of methylene blue was conducted in KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte with and without t-BuOH. As exhibited in Fig. 5 b, the degradation rate of methylene blue was weaker in t-BuOH/KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte relative to that in KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, electron spin resonance (ESR) detections directly revealed that the •OH signal in H2O2/K2CO3 and H2O2/KHCO3 aqueous solution are gradually enhanced with the mixing time of H2O2 and K2CO3 or KHCO3 ( Fig. 5 c and 5 d) [23-25], confirming the function of HCO3 − in activating H2O2 into •OH. Meanwhile, the •OH signal intensity in K2CO3 solution is weaker than that in KHCO3 solution, which is consistent with the degradation rate difference of methylene blue in K2CO3 and KHCO3 electrolyte (see Fig. 3 c and 3 d). Therefore, it can be confirmed that the electrochemically formed H2O2 can be effectively activated into •OH by HCO3 −, and then •OH act as active radicals to drive the degradation of methylene blue. Summarized the findings in the present work, the electrochemical cell for dual-functional water splitting can be illustrated as Fig. 5 e. On graphite sheet cathode, H2 can be produced from protons reduction with high Faraday efficiency. On graphite sheet anode side, H2O2 firstly be produced through the initiation of water oxidation by HCO4 − that electrochemically formed from HCO3 − oxidation. Then, the as-produced H2O2 be activated into •OH by HCO3 −, and the degradation of organic pollutants be initiated with •OH oxidation. Relative to the conventional electrolysis of water to produce H2 fuel, the present dual-functional water splitting can produce H2 fuel and achieve electro-Fenton-like pollutants degradation simultaneously. Additionally, the another highlight of present work is that the electro-Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants can be achieved in alkaline solution, which breaks the limitations of traditional electro-Fenton that the H2O2 and active radicals-driven degradation reaction depends on the sustained reduction of O2 and iron-based anode electrolysis in acid solution [26]. More importantly, our findings provide comprehensive insight into the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in KHCO3 electrolytes, and illumine its promising prospect in industrial applications due to the low-cost of preparation and good stability of graphite electrode."
6,Conclusions,"In summary, an electrochemical cell was assembled using graphite electrodes and HCO3 −-containing aqueous electrolytes for dual-functional water splitting. On the graphite cathode of cell, H2 was produced from protons reduction with ∼99% Faraday efficiency. Simultaneously, H2O2 was electrochemically produced in from the anode side through the initiation of HCO3 − oxidation into HCO4 − on graphite anode. Further taking the function of HCO3 − in activating H2O2 into •OH under pulse potential, the resultant H2O2 can be in-situ used to achieve electro-Fenton-like degradation of methylene blue and phenol effectively. The present work provides an inspiring dual-functional water splitting as well as electro-Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants in alkaline solution, which illumines the application prospect of electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 in HCO3 −-containing electrolyte."
