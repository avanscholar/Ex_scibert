0,Introduction,"The chemoselective hydrogenation of carbonyls in multiunsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, is a longstanding challenge, since both thermodynamics and kinetics favor the hydrogenation of CC bonds over CO bonds [1]. A variety of heterogeneous metallic catalysts have been developed to control the selectively of the reaction by means of alloying, ligand modification, and support optimization [2–10]. The elucidation of geometric and electronic effects on Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions has been attempted. The selectivity of CO hydrogenation exhibits a strong dependence on the particle size distribution, and the reaction rate is also sensitive to the structure of the Pt nanoparticles [11–13]. The electronic modification of Pt in bimetallic catalysis is an effective strategy for improving catalytic performance. However, the lack of structural control limits further enhancement because the second metal promoter unselectively blocks the Pt active sites. Surface science studies have suggested that direct adsorption of substances on the self-assembled layers of ligands is critical to adjusting the selectivity of the hydrogenation. The arrangement and the orientation of ligands with different chain lengths on the metal surfaces can be used to tune the adsorption geometry of the aldehyde molecule and boost the hydrogenation selectivity [14]. The confinement of metallic Pt or Pd sites in porous metal–organic frameworks also promotes the selectivity of the CO activation due to steric hindrance of the CC group as it approaches the active sites [15–17]. In addition, the catalytic performance depends on the manipulation of kinetic parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, and humidity). The use of water as a promoter or inhibitor to enhance the activity and selectivity of a catalyst has been demonstrated in many types of reactions, including CO oxidation, methanation, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, oxygen evolution reactions, and various processes used in organic synthesis [18–23]. The extensive interest in the utilization of water is due to its substantial economic and ecological advantages, as well as its various functions, including solvation effects, carbon removal, and surface reconstruction [24–27]. A reaction pathway followed by a water-mediated Mars–Van Krevelen reaction has been reported in single-atom Pt1/CeO2-catalyzed CO oxidation. The intermediate is formed via the interaction of CO and the hydroxyl group from the dissociation of water rather than the direct reaction of CO with the lattice oxygen [28] The Au-catalyzed oxidation of CO has also been enhanced by water-promoted decomposition and conversion of the reaction intermediates [29]. Recently, water-assisted hydrogen diffusion across the surface of a metal oxide was directly confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) movies, suggesting that catalytic hydrogenation, hydrogen evolution, or the reformation of hydrogen may be accelerated by the presence of water [30]. For instance, it was found that water could take part in the synthesis of C2+ alcohols via CO2 hydrogenation by serving as the hydrogen source [31]. Despite the great progress and valuable insights from the above investigations, the details of the role of water in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation processes remain elusive. For conjugated CO hydrogenation, the replacement of organic solvent with water has been proven available to improve both the activity and selectivity of Au and Pt catalysts [32,33]. Trace amounts of water have also been shown to enhance the activity on Pt-based catalysts [34]. The orientable chemisorption of the hydrophilic CO moiety in dipolar water solvent leads to satisfactory selectivity to unsaturated alcohol, according to the kinetic characterizations and adsorption spectra data [35–37]. Furthermore, isotopic-exchange studies have clarified the evolution of catalytically active sites in the pathway of direct hydrogenation by the dissociated H2 [38,39]. The essential effect of water merits further investigation for selective hydrogenation on heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, we employ carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported bimetallic PtFe nanoparticles (NPs) to efficiently achieve the chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamyl alcohol (CALA) with water as the only solvent. We illustrate the role of water as both a hydrogen carrier and a polar solvent by isotopic labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. The coexistence of two reaction pathways for water-mediated hydrogen exchange and dissociative hydrogenation with H2 is also confirmed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Pt(acac)2 (97.0%), Fe(acac)3 (97.0%), benzyl alcohol (99.0%), cinnamaldehyde (CALD, 99.0%), phenylpropyl aldehyde (HCALD, 95.0%), cinnamyl alcohol (CALA, 98.0%), 3-phenylpropanol (HCALA, 99.0%), isopropanol (99.9%), n-heptane (98.0%), ethyl acetate (99.8%), cyclohexane (99.5%), and n-hexane (97.0%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). HNO3 (69%) and H2SO4 (98%) were provided by Aladdin Reagent Corp. (Shanghai, China). The deuterated solvent D2O (deuteration degree > 99.8%) was provided by J&K Scientific (Shanghai, China). CO (99.99%), H2 (99.999%), and Ar (99.999%) were supplied by Nanjing Special Gas Factory (Nanjing, China). Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (purity 97.1%, SBET 241 m2/g, bulk density 0.05 g/cm3) were purchased from CNano Technology (Zhenjiang, China)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation CNTs were chosen as the support due to their anchoring effect; the CNT surface with abundant oxygen-containing groups can stabilize the metallic sites via strong interactions. Supported Pt-based nanoparticle (NP) catalysts were prepared according to a modified procedure using benzyl alcohol and carbon monoxide as the co-reductant. The method affords a moderate size distribution of bimetallic NPs that have clean surfaces and do not contain residual organic ligands [40]. Consequently, the effects of the ligand can be ruled out, and the intrinsic activity of the Pt-based catalysts in water is truly reflected in the selective hydrogenation reaction. 2.2.1 Pretreatment of CNT support The pristine CNTs were pretreated with concentrated HNO3 at 120 °C for 4 h to remove impurities and to introduce surface oxygen-containing groups to enhance the metal dispersion. The treated CNTs were washed with deionized water several times and dried in a 100 °C oven overnight. The CNT supports were kept dry before use. 2.2.2 Preparation of supported Pt-based catalysts In a typical synthesis of the supported Pt catalyst, Pt(acac)2 (100 mg, 0.25 mmol), 40 mL of benzyl alcohol and 800 mg of dry support were mixed together at room temperature and then stirred for 10 min. The resulting homogeneous yellow suspension was transferred to a glass pressure vessel. The sealed vessel was charged with 1 bar of CO gas and then heated for 3 h with vigorous stirring in an oil bath that had been preheated to 180 °C. After the vessel was cooled to room temperature, the catalyst was collected by centrifugation and washed several times with ethanol. For supported PtFe catalysts, the same preparation procedure was used and certain amounts of Pt(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3 were employed as metal precursors to obtain the desired Pt/Fe mole ratio. The Pt loadings were fixed at approximately 6.2 wt% for all Pt-based catalysts and confirmed by ICP-OES measurements. The identified real Pt/Fe ratios were 3.3, 8.5, and 58.7 for the Pt3Fe/CNT, Pt9Fe/CNT, and Pt60Fe/CNT catalyst, respectively. 2.2.3 Acid washing of the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst The reference catalyst was prepared via acid washing. The acid-washed sample without surface Fe species (Pt3Fe/CNT-H2SO4) was obtained as follows: Pt3Fe/CNT (100 mg) was soaked in 20 mL of H2SO4 (0.5 M) for 30 min, and the slurry was filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water. Based on ICP-OES analysis, approximately 10% of the Fe has been removed, and the estimated Pt/Fe ratio of the Pt3Fe/CNT-H2SO4 sample was 3.7."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations The metal loadings for all catalysts were quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Avio 200, Perkin Elmer) by measuring the metal concentrations in solutions of the complexes dissolved in 40% hydrofluoric acid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractometer using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffraction data were collected between 10° and 70° with a resolution of 0.02° (2θ). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM 3010 instrument operated at 300 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and elemental line scanning were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN system operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were acquired using a VG Scientific ESCALAB Mark II spectrometer equipped with two ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) chambers. All binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV."
5,Catalytic tests,"2.4 Catalytic tests Selective hydrogenations of CALD were carried out in a stainless steel reactor with a Teflon liner (Parr 4950, controller 4843). A 10-mg portion of catalyst, a certain amount of CALD (200, 400, or 1000 µL), and 10 mL of the solvent were added into the reactor. The molar ratio of CALD to total Pt atoms in the catalysts was approximately 500, 1000, or 2500, based on the CALD sampling amount. The residual air inside the reactor was expelled by pressurizing and releasing hydrogen several times. The reaction was performed at 60 °C under 20 bar of hydrogen. The stirring speed was set at 700 rpm for all the experiments in this study to eliminate the external mass transfer limitation. The equivalents of CALD, hydrogen pressure, and reaction temperature, as well as reaction time, were controlled in the tests of catalytic performance. After the reactions were carried out in organic solvents, the catalyst powder was removed by centrifugation. For the reactions in water, in consideration of insoluble substances in water phase, ethyl acetate was added into the liner to thoroughly extract organic products and the solid catalyst was removed by centrifugation. All the products in the solution were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent, 6890N) equipped with a CP-WAX 52 CB column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Tetradecane was added as an internal standard. The byproducts were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS, Agilent, GC 6890N, MS 5973). The carbon balance was >98% in the hydrogenation reactions. We computed Conversion = { [ N in CALD - N out CALD ] / N in CALD } × 100 % , Selectivity p - i = N out p - i / ∑ i N out p - i × 100 % , Carbon balance = [ N out CALD + ∑ i N out p - i ] / N in CALD × 100 % , Specific reaction rate = [ V × ρ × Conversion/MW / Time × N total Pt ] , where p-i represents hydrogenation products; N(p-i) is the molar amount of the corresponding product i; V, ρ, and MW are the sampling volume amount, density, and molecular weight for CALD, respectively; and N total(Pt) is the molar number of total Pt atoms in employed catalyst. The experimental CALD concentrations versus time are plotted according to a rate law that is first-order with respect to CALD, and the rate constant k is calculated from a regression fit of the experimental data: ln ( C t / C 0 ) = - k × t , where Ct represents the CALD concentration at reaction time t and C 0 is the initial CALD concentration. Isotope studies were performed under similar reaction conditions except that deuterated solvent (D2O) was used. For control experiments with/without the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst, the substances for the standard hydrogenation reaction, including CALD and three kinds of main products (CALA, HCALD, and HCALA), were mixed with D2O and stirred in a Parr reactor at 25 °C under 20 bar of N2 for 24 h. The deuterated products were analyzed by GCMS and 1H NMR (Bruker Advance 400 M)."
6,Theoretical calculations,"2.5 Theoretical calculations The structural model for the FePt surface in the present calculations was built based on previously reported characterization results for the Pt3Fe NP catalysts [21]. Briefly, we used three-layered Pt(1 1 1) surfaces to model the Pt substrate, and we selected Fe6O18H15 as a model for Fe(OH) x . Our calculations showed that Fe6O18H15 can strongly anchor to the stepped surfaces of the Pt(1 1 1) planes. First-principle calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on the all-electron projected augmented wave (PAW) method [41,42]. The k-point sampling was generated following the Monkhorst–Pack procedure with a 2 × 3 × 1 mesh. The Perdew–Wang 91 form of the generalized gradient approximation was used to calculate nonlocal gradient corrections to the correlation and exchange energies [43,44]. The GGA + U approximation with a U eff of 3.0 eV for Fe atoms (antiferromagnetic) was used [44,45]. During structural optimization, the bottom layers of the slab were fixed at the bulk truncated position, while the top two layers and the adsorbates were fully relaxed. To prevent artificial interaction between the repeated slabs along the z-direction, a 15 Å vacuum was introduced with correction of the dipole moment. The reaction barriers were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method [46,47]. The final transition state (TS) structures were refined using a quasi-Newton algorithm until the forces were less than 0.03 eV/Å."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst structure,"3.1 Catalyst structure The XRD patterns (Fig. 1 A) confirmed that the metallic NPs were well dispersed on the surfaces of CNT support. For all the catalysts, the (0 0 2) main diffraction at 25.8° suggested that the hexagonal graphite structure had been retained in the CNT support after the loading of the metals and pretreatment procedure of acid washing [48]. The diffraction peaks corresponding to the Pt(1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes at 39.6° and 46.1°, respectively, were observed for the Pt/CNT catalyst. For the bimetallic PtFe catalysts, these peaks gradually shifted to higher angles with increasing Fe loadings. Specifically, the peaks were located at 40.1° and 46.8° for the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. This indicated the formation of the PtFe alloy phase and was consistent with the unit cell shrinkage due to the smaller lattice parameter of Fe [49]. In addition, the alloy structure of the PtFe NPs in the Pt3Fe/CNT–H2SO4 catalyst was maintained during acid washing with dilute H2SO4. The XPS studies confirmed that the Pt in the Pt-based catalysts was mainly reduced to metallic Pt0 (Fig. 1B). The binding energies of 71.4 and 74.8 eV for the Pt4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 orbitals, respectively, were observed on the CNT-supported Pt and PtFe catalysts. Neither modifying Fe nor removing the oxygen-containing groups on the surfaces of the CNTs had a notable impact on the Pt binding energies. The signals from the Fe2p 3/2 orbitals were relatively weak; however, the coexistence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ species (55% vs. 45%) was observed for the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst (Fig. 1C) [50]. Furthermore, the disappearance of the Fe-related peaks in the XPS spectrum of the Pt3Fe/CNT–H2SO4 catalyst confirmed the possibility of targeted removal of surface Fe species by acid washing pretreatment [51]. The TEM images of the Pt/CNT catalyst revealed that the CNT-supported monometallic Pt NPs are 2.7 ± 0.6 nm in particle size (Fig. 2 A and B). With the modification of the second Fe metal, the sizes of PtFe NPs on CNT surfaces increased slightly in comparison with that of monometallic Pt NPs. As shown in Fig. 2C–H, the size distributions of PtFe NPs for Pt60Fe, Pt9Fe, and Pt3Fe catalysts are 5.4 ± 1.3, 5.4 ± 0.9, and 6.7 ± 1.7 nm, respectively. STEM-EDX elemental line-scanning analysis was performed on various PtFe catalysts to further identify the formation of PtFe alloy structure. The compositional line profiles of Pt and Fe clearly cross individual Pt60Fe, Pt9Fe, and Pt3Fe particles, as illustrated in Fig. 2I–K. Accordingly, the ratio of the signal strength of Fe to Pt lines increased with the increasing Fe/Pt ratio from 1/60 to 1/3. The HRTEM images directly showed a lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, which corresponds to the (1 1 1) faces of Pt and PtFe alloys (Fig. 3 A and B). Based on these characterization data, the CNT-supported PtFe NPs were composed of a PtFe alloy core and a shell comprising Fe oxide species."
9,Effects of the modification with Fe species,"3.2 Effects of the modification with Fe species The selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamyl alcohol (CALA) was performed on CNT-supported Pt and PtFe catalysts under relatively mild conditions (Fig. 4 ). The catalytic performances in isopropanol, a common solvent for this reaction, are presented in Fig. 4A. To better judge the selectivity of the catalytic hydrogenation, a consistent level of CALD conversion (approximately 60%) over various catalysts was achieved by regulating the reaction times. The monometallic Pt/CNT showed an unsatisfactory CALA selectivity of 50.5%. The modification of Pt with Fe as a second metal dramatically enhanced the chemoselectivity for the CO hydrogenation, and the addition of a sufficient amount of Fe was necessary for the enhancement. Specifically, the selectivity for CALA reached 95.5% at 60.9% conversion over the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. The relationship between the specific reaction rate and the Pt/Fe ratio demonstrated that the alloyed PtFe could also boost the rate of the hydrogenation reaction as compared with the monometallic Pt/CNT catalyst. Furthermore, the variations in the performances with the Pt/Fe ratio indicated that the catalytic process was very sensitive to the structure of the PtFe NPs and the Pt–Fe interactions on the surface. On one hand, the electropositive Fe species could increase the electron density on the Pt to lower the probability of CC activation and polarize the CO group for nucleophilic attack by the H species dissociated on the Pt site [52]. On the other hand, the oxidized Fe species may act as Lewis acidic sites and interact with the CO group in CALD, promoting the selective conversion of CALD to CALA [34,53]. For instance, our previous work demonstrated that iron oxide nanoisland-decorated Pt NPs displayed improved catalytic performances in the selective hydrogenation of CALD [54]. The specific Pt–FeO x interfaces could also be generated by using atomic layer deposition, and the high selectivity for CALA was believed to be due to the precise blocking of low-coordinated Pt sites with Fe oxides [55]. It was reported that isopropanol could serve as a hydrogen donor in the transfer catalytic hydrogenation reactions [56,57]. A H2-free blank hydrogenation reaction test in isopropanol was performed over a Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. CALD conversion less than 1% and CALA selectivity 48.9% were obtained under N2. Such low selectivity suggested that the hydrogenation of CALD on Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst may not follow the transfer hydrogenation pathway. The huge conversion gap also indicated that the direct hydrogenation overwhelmingly dominates the reaction process and isopropanol plays a solo role of solvent rather than hydrogen donor."
10,Activity in water,"3.3 Activity in water The optimized Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst was employed to explore the catalytic performance in CALD hydrogenation with pure water as the solvent. The activities and selectivities of Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst in water and other types of organic solvents were first compared. Those solvents (e.g., cyclohexane and ethyl acetate) are frequently used in hydrogenation reactions of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. 5 , satisfactory CALD conversion and CALA selectivity were achieved in water as the solvent. It should be mentioned that the reaction rate of hydrogenation of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is not correlated with the hydrogen solubility, because the CALD conversion in isopropanol was less than half of that in water even though the solubility of H2 in isopropanol is four times higher than that in water [58]. With the aid of water, the CALA selectivity of the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst further increased to 97.2%, while the conversion reached 62.1% in 0.5 h (Fig. 6 ). Such high selectivity (95.9%) was still observed at nearly complete conversion (98.1% in 1 h). The decline in the CALA selectivity in favor of the formation of the fully hydrogenated hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCALA) suggested that the sequential hydrogenation of the CO and CC bonds occurred on the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst in water. The facilitation effect of water was also observed in the hydrogenation reactions over Pt, Pt9Fe, and Pt60Fe catalysts (Fig. 4B). For instance, the CALA selectivity in water increased to 72.8% while the selectivity in isopropanol was 50.5% at the same level of conversion for the monometallic Pt/CNT catalyst. Slightly increased selectivity of CALA was also obtained in water on Pt9Fe/CNT and Pt60Fe/CNT catalysts, compared with that in isopropanol. In general, the polar water can substantially promote the adsorption and activation of hydrophilic CO groups over CC groups, thus producing CALA with a similar polarity [59]. However, we expect that this may not be the only role of water in this reaction process."
11,Water-involved hydrogen exchange,"3.4 Water-involved hydrogen exchange To further study the effects of water, pure deuterium oxide (D2O) was used instead of H2O to determine its effect on the hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by Pt3Fe/CNT. The exchange between D2O and the related substances in the CALD hydrogenation reaction should be one of the first concerns. The reference test for the exchange process was carried out in the absence of the catalyst and H2. The H–D exchanges between the D atom in D2O and the H atom in CALD and three kinds of main hydrogenation products (CALA, HCALD, and HCALA) were not favored without the catalyst, because only the regular molecular ion peak was observed on GCMS spectra for the individual substances (Fig. 7 A–D). The H2-free exchange test was also performed in the presence of the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. No deuterated CALD and HCALD were detected by GCMS spectra, indicating that the alkenyl group and the aldehyde groups could not interact with molecular D2O on the surface of the PtFe catalyst (Fig. 7F and H). The peak of m/z 135 for CALA and the peak of m/z 137 for HCALA were observed on GCMS spectra, which suggested that the H atom in the hydroxyl group preferred to exchange with the D atom in D2O with the action of the PtFe catalyst (Fig. 7E and G). However, it should be noted that although the H–D exchange process was nearly completed, only one D atom was deuterated into the hydroxyl groups for all CALA and HCALA molecules. This suggested that α-C-H could not be exchanged with D2O under the reaction condition. The Pt3Fe/CNT catalyzed hydrogenation reaction of CALD in D2O was then performed and the details of the isotope studies are provided in Table 1 . Analysis of the GCMS spectra revealed that the hydrogenation products were deuterated during the catalytic reaction (Fig. 7I–T). For the reaction at 25 °C and 1 bar of H2, the molecular ion peaks at m/z 136 and 135 have clearly emerged in the GCMS spectrum of the CALA product, as shown in Fig. 7I, which suggested that both ends of the CO bond in CALD were deuterated during the hydrogenation reaction. This result confirmed that it was a D2O-involved reaction process rather than a simple H–D exchange process. Such a D2O-involved process also occurred in the CC hydrogenation reaction, which was supported by the fact that the peaks at m/z 138 and 137 and the coexisting peaks at m/z 140, 139, and 138 were observed on the GCMS spectra of HCALD and HCALA products, respectively (Fig. 7J and K). This result is summarized in Scheme 1 , which strongly proves that D2O was involved as a hydrogen exchange bridge in the selective hydrogenation of CO and CC bonds in CALD [60]. In consideration that the deuteration of products using HD or D2 generated in situ from H2–D2O exchange on Pt catalyst may be one of the possible reaction pathways [61], the H2–D2O exchange reactions in the absence of CALD were also performed over Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. The yields of gaseous HD and D2 produced from the H2–D2O exchange reaction and the deuteration degrees (the relative abundances for m/z 136, 135, and 134) of the CALA product in the D2O-involved hydrogenation reaction could be compared under the same reaction conditions (e.g., temperatures, H2 pressures, samplings, and times), as shown in Fig. 8 . For H2–D2O exchange, similarly low yields of D2 (approximately 0.3%) were observed under different reaction conditions, and the yield of HD at 25 °C and 1 bar of H2 was much lower than that at 60 or 25 °C and 20 bar of H2. This suggested that the reaction rate of exchange between H2 and D2O was mainly improved by the higher H2 pressure in this temperature range. For the D2O-involved hydrogenation reaction under a H2 pressure of 20 bar, the ratio of the relative abundances of the peaks at m/z 135 and 136 to that at m/z 134 at 25 °C was obviously higher than that at 60 °C for CALA product (Fig. 7 M and 7Q). When the reaction temperature was 25 °C, the peak at m/z 135 became dominant and the degree of deuteration was significantly increased under ambient H2 pressure, in marked contrast to that under 20 bar (Fig. 7I and M). This suggested that much more D2O actively and rapidly participated in the hydrogenation reaction at lower H2 pressure and lower temperature. The reaction rate of H2–D2O exchange and the deuteration degree of CALA product in the hydrogenation reaction revealed the opposite trend with varied H2 pressures and temperatures. In addition, the lower yield of HD and D2 could not guarantee adequate supplies of D atoms to achieve such a higher deuteration degree of hydrogenation products. Therefore, as illustrated in Scheme 1, the D2O-involved hydrogenation was neither a simple exchange process between D2O and substances nor a tandem reaction process consisting of H2–D2O exchange reaction and deuteration reaction by HD or D2 generated in situ. The core role of water was examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations for CALD hydrogenation over the PtFe surface model (details in Figs. S1–S3). As shown in Fig. 9 , the assistance of water significantly decreases the energy barrier of the overall reaction, especially the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, for both the CALA and HCALD formation processes. However, even in the presence of water, noticeably lower activation energy barriers favored CO hydrogenation over CC hydrogenation on the PtFe surface (14.84 vs. 18.88 kcal/mol). This highlights the excellent synergetic effect between the water and the bimetallic PtFe NP catalysts in enhancing both the conversion of CALD and the selectivity for CO hydrogenation. In contrast to the water-free formation of CALA, the water-mediated pathway had a much lower energy barrier (14.84 vs. 21.49 kcal/mol for WIN1-WTS1-WIN2 and IN1-TS1-IN2, respectively, in Fig. 9A). After the co-adsorption of CALD and dissociated H atoms on the surface of the catalyst, the water initially attached to the Pt–H surface and the O atom of the CALD species via two hydrogen bonds, acting as a hydrogen bridge. The water-assisted hydrogen exchange process was then achieved. Complete abstraction of the H atom from the Pt surface generated a bond with the O atom in H2O, while the O–H bond on the other side of the H2O broke and the H atom transferred into the hydrogenation product, producing H-exchanged H2O and CALA, as shown in Scheme 2 . Water-involved hydrogen exchange is apparently affected by the hydrogen bonding interactions between the H2O, CALD, and Pt sites. To elucidate their mechanism of influence, we created two mixed solvent systems, H2O–n-heptane and H2O–isopropanol, with different combinations of hydrogen bonds. Fig. 10 A shows that the conversion rate of CALD increased proportionally with the ratio of water to heptane over the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. However, the reaction rate initially decreased and then increased as the water/isopropanol ratio increased (Fig. 10B). This clearly indicated that the interactions between polar solvent molecules could competitively interrupt the hydrogen bonding interactions in the water-involved hydrogen exchange and thus influence the CALD conversion. For Pt3Fe/CNT-catalyzed CALD hydrogenation, the reaction rate constants (k) in H2O and D2O were analyzed in the initial reaction stages. ln(Ct /C 0) was plotted as a first-order function of reaction time with respect to CALD, as shown in Fig. 11 . k H2O and k D2O are 8.2 × 10−3 min−1 and 5.8 × 10−3 min−1, respectively, and the ratio of k H2O to k D2O is only 1.4. This result suggested that the kinetic isotope effect existed in the catalytic hydrogenation reaction with the involvement of D2O; however, the cleavage of OH bonds in H2O and subsequent hydrogen exchange were not the rate-determining steps. This accords with the result from DFT calculations that the H2O-bridged hydrogen-exchange process easily occurs with a relatively low energy barrier."
12,Reusability of Pt3Fe/CNT in water,"3.5 Reusability of Pt3Fe/CNT in water The presence of stable Fe3+ and Fe2+ species on the surface of the Pt3Fe NPs was of great importance for both the catalytic activity and the hydrogenation selectivity. When oxidized Fe species were eliminated from the surfaces of the NPs by acid washing with dilute H2SO4, the CALD conversion after the same reaction time fell to half of its initial value (Fig. S4). At a similar level of CALD conversion, the selectivity for CALA had decreased slightly with the Pt3Fe/CNT–H2SO4 catalyst, unlike that with the fresh Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst. However, the Pt3Fe/CNT–H2SO4 catalyst still showed a higher CALA selectivity and a conversion twice as high as what was achieved with the monometallic Pt/CNT catalyst, and this may have been due to the stability of the PtFe alloy in the bulk NPs [53,62]. The stability and reusability tests for the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst in water were performed repeatedly, and the results are shown in Fig. 12 . After each reaction run, the catalyst was separated from the mixture, washed with ethanol several times, and then dried overnight. There was a slight fluctuation in both the CALD conversion and the CALA selectivity in the recycling runs. A CALD conversion of 87.5% and a CALA selectivity of 90.3% were maintained even after six runs, indicating good recyclability of the Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of CALD in water. The structure of the recycled Pt3Fe/CNT catalyst was examined by a series of characterization techniques, and no marked variations were observed. In addition, no leaching of Fe into the reaction solution was detected. Both the alloy structure and the moderate crystal size of the PtFe NPs were maintained, which was reflected in the XRD pattern of the spent catalyst (Fig. 13 A). The XPS spectra suggested that Pt was kept in the metallic Pt0 state, as shown in Fig. 13B. Surface Fe species were still present as both Fe2+ and Fe3+; however, the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio increased during the hydrogenation reaction (31% Fe2+ and 69% Fe3+, Fig. 13C). The transformation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ suggested that the electron-donating process occurred on the Fe2+ sites in the hydrogenation reaction. The TEM and HRTEM images revealed that the Pt3Fe NPs on the CNT surface slightly grew to 7.3 ± 2.2 nm from 6.7 ± 1.7 nm after six reaction runs (Fig. 13D–F). The STEM-EDX elemental line-scanning profiles (Fig. 13G) confirmed that the core structure of Pt3Fe alloy NPs was well preserved. To further study whether water-involved hydrogen exchange occurs steadily in the hydrogenation of CALD, alternating reactions were run in H2O and D2O. The reactions were performed at 25 °C and 1 bar of H2, and the products were analyzed by GC–MS. As illustrated in Fig. 14 , when D2O was used instead of H2O as the solvent, the main molecular ion peak in MS spectra from the CALA product was m/z 135 rather than m/z 134, which strongly confirmed the participation of D2O in the reaction system. In the fourth run, the intensity of the peak at m/z 135 did not change, suggesting that the water-involved hydrogen exchange was a stable reaction pathway in the hydrogenation of CALD."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, we demonstrated that supported PtFe NPs can efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol with high selectivity (>97%) under relatively mild reaction conditions with pure water as the solvent. By conducting a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, we confirmed that the pathway of water-involved hydrogen exchange was active during the catalytic reaction, and this pathway coexisted with direct hydrogenation with dissociated H2. The water molecule acts as a bridge to facilitate hydrogen exchange between the CALD species and the Pt sites with lower thermodynamic energy barriers. We expect that the strategy of exploiting the synergistic effects of water and metallic catalysts could be adopted to explore novel catalytic systems for the development of selective hydrogenation processes. See Figs. S1–S4 and Table S1 for DFT calculation details and comparison of catalytic performances."
