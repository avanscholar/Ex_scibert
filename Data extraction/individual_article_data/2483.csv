0,Introduction,"The environmental consequences of extensive fossil fuel use have already begun to surface. This excessive usage of fossil fuels has caused global warming and acid rain, resulting in serious effects on the earth's climate, weather conditions, vegetation, and aquatic ecosystems. In contrast to these chemical processes, hydrogen is featured as an ideal, clean, and sustainable energy. The biological production of hydrogen using mixed or pure anaerobic bacterial cultures has attracted substantial interest recently due to its high conversion and non-polluting nature [1–4]. The complete concept of hydrogen production, application, and analysis has been studied since the mid-1980s. These studies have addressed the concepts of hydrogen production from non-renewable and renewable energy sources, transportation, storage, utilization, and safety issues [5]. Hydrogen can be produced from non-renewable (coal, nuclear energy) and renewable energy sources (sun, hydro, wind, biomass, tides, etc.). The process of hydrogen production from non-renewable sources by different groups of microorganism can still release environmentally unfriendly or hazardous waste. However, renewable energy sources are unlimited, and these methods of hydrogen production have little impact on the environment. Therefore, unquestionably, a worldwide research goal is the use of hydrogen as a carrier of energy generated from renewable energy sources [6–8]. Biological processes that evolve hydrogen gas are categorized as a renewable energy source. This has been the subject of basic and applied research for several decades. In these processes, hydrogen production is carried out either by microorganisms that can split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules or by fermenting organic materials to produce hydrogen [9]. Based on the metabolic pathways performed by different group's microorganisms, biological hydrogen production processes can be classified as biophotolysis of water using algae and cyanobacteria, photo fermentation of organic materials by photosynthetic bacteria, and dark fermentation of organic materials using fermentative bacteria [10]. A novel hybrid system of combining dark and photo fermentations has also been investigated to enhance hydrogen production [11]. Among a large number of microbial species, pure cultures of the genera Enterobactor, Bacillus, and Clostridium are the most efficient producers of hydrogen [12,13]. Glucose is the preferred carbon source for fermentation processes, which predominantly produce acetic acid or butyric acid and hydrogen gas, according to the following reactions [13,14]: C6H12O6 +2H2O→2 CH3COOH+2CO2 +4H2 C6H12O6 →CH3CH2CH2COOH+2CO2 +2H2 From the above reactions, it is evident that a maximum of 4mol H2/mol glucose could be obtained when acetic acid is the by-product, and half of this yield per molecule of glucose is obtained with butyrate as the fermentation end product. Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 (ATCC 13564) is known as alcohol-producing microorganism for fermentative acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) production from defined media. Its hydrogen producing potential has not been well studied [15]. Since very few studies have taken on hydrogen production using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 (ATCC 13564) (hereafter referred to as CS N1-4), still more research should be carried in this field. Therefore, the ability to produce hydrogen using CS N1-4, as well as the effects of varying initial substrate concentration, initial medium pH, and temperature, were investigated in this work."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganism and pre-culture development,"2.1 Microorganism and pre-culture development CS N1-4 culture stock was obtained from a culture collection maintained at the Chemical Engineering Department, UKM. The culture stock was grown on TYA agar medium. Single colonies (three to five) of CS N1-4 from TYA agar culture were transferred anaerobically into 10ml 15% potato–glucose (PG; 150g fresh mash potato, 0.5g (NH4)2SO4, 10g glucose, and 3g CaCO3) medium, and these were incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 30h [16]. A 1ml aliquot of this culture was transferred into 9ml fresh PG medium, incubated in the same conditions at 37°C for 18h and used as inoculum."
3,Culture media,"2.2 Culture media A solution of 15% PG medium per liter of distilled water was used as a growth medium for inoculum. This medium was incubated in boiling water for 1h and then filtered with cotton cloth. The filtrate was sterilized in an autoclave at 121°C for 15min. Tryptone–yeast extract–acetate (TYA) medium was used for the pre-culture and main culture, and the following composition was used per liter of distilled water [17]: 40g glucose, 2g yeast extract, 6g Bact-Tryptone, 3g ammonium acetate, 10mg FeSO4.7H2O, 0.5g KH2PO4, and 0.3g MgSO4.7H2O per liter of distilled water. The concentration of glucose was varied from 1 to 40g; in this experiment to investigate the substrate effect on hydrogen production. The pH of the TYA medium was adjusted to 6.5 with 5M NaOH and sterilized at 121°C for 15min [18]. TYA agar medium was prepared by adding 15g Agar Bacteriological No.1."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure Batch culture experiments were carried out at 37°C in a 500ml Duran bottle. On the top of the bottle, there was an inlet for the medium and outlets for gases. CS N1-4 was grown in PG for 30h and used as inoculum. The inoculum (10% v/v) was transferred into fermentation medium (TYA) to study the effect of initial pH, glucose concentrations and temperature. The culture pH was not controlled during fermentation. The initial pH of the TYA medium was adjusted to 6.0 with 5M NaOH and sterilized at 121°C for 15min. The fermentation temperature was maintained at 37°C using a water bath. The evolved gas mixture from the reactor, containing both hydrogen and carbon dioxide, was passed through 5M KOH solution to absorb most of carbon dioxide [19] and then subjected to analysis by gas chromatography (GC). The experiments were done using the design of experiment (DOE) to know which conditions are the best for hydrogen production. The best conditions to this microorganism for hydrogen production were 6.0±0.2, 10 and 37°C “initial pH, glucose concentration and reaction temperature respectively”. The effect of initial glucose concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40gl−1 were evaluated at fixed conditions initial pH and temperature of 6.0±0.2, 37°C. The effect of initial pH was studied from 4.0±0.2 to 8.0±0.2 at fixed conditions initial glucose concentration and temperature of 10gl−1, 37°C. The effect of temperatures was tested from 25 to 40°C at fixed conditions initial glucose concentration and initial pH of 10gl−1, 6.0±0.2."
5,Analysis methods,"2.4 Analysis methods The composition of the gas was analyzed using gas chromatography (SRI 8610C, USA) equipped with a helium ionization detector (15m length). The temperatures of the oven, injector, and detector were 50, 100 and 150°C, respectively. The cell biomass concentration was estimated as the Dry Weight Cell (DWC) by spectrophotometrically measuring the optical density at the 660nm wavelength, and then relating the optical density to DWC. The reducing-sugar (glucose) content of the medium was estimated using the Miller method [20]. The glucose concentration in the medium was measured using the 3, 5 dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay for total reducing sugars. A 1ml aliquot of the sample and 2ml aliquot of the DNS reagent mixture were mixed together in a test tube. The mixtures were placed in a boiling water bath for 5min and then diluted with 10ml of distilled water. The absorbance at OD550nm was recorded for all samples, and the glucose concentration was calculated from a standard curve."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of inoculum size,"3.1 Effect of inoculum size The effect of the inoculum size of (5%, 10%, and 20%) (v/v) was investigated in a 100ml culture containing TYA medium at 37°C. Table 1 shows that the bacteria grew fairly well in the TYA medium with 10% inoculum. The absorbance values at 660nm were 0.945, 1.361, and 1.031, for the 5%, 10% and 20% inocula, respectively. The yield of hydrogen in correlation with size of inoculum is not linear as indicated by this study. The optimum size of inoculum is (10% v/v) as presented in Table 1 and giving a highest hydrogen yield. Reflects that higher specific growth rate and doubling time were observed when the inoculum size was (10% v/v). This result is in agreement with data reported elsewhere [15]."
8,Effect of initial glucose concentration,"3.2 Effect of initial glucose concentration The initial glucose concentration plays an important role in the size and yield of hydrogen production during fermentation at relatively low initial glucose levels. The rate of fermentation was low according to the law of mass action as reported in the literature [13,21], and the effect of glucose content in the culture media on fermentation for 48h is presented in Table 2 . The highest yield of hydrogen was observed when initial glucose concentration was 10gl−1 with consumption of 81.8%, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The best yield of hydrogen production on varying glucose concentration with time was 10gl−1, as displayed in Fig. 2 , and then decreased with increasing glucose concentration."
9,Effect of initial medium pH,"3.3 Effect of initial medium pH Solution pH is an important controlling factor of anaerobic fermentation processes. Many researchers have reported that pH could affect the metabolic pathway of dark fermentation in pure culture [3,15,22,23]. A set of tests in this study was performed by varying the initial pH from 4.0±0.2 to 8.0±0.2 for 48h. Result shows that the maximum rate of hydrogen production was measured at initial pH 6.0±0.2, while the minimum rate of hydrogen production was recorded at the initial pH 4.0±0.2 as presented in Fig. 3 . As presented in Fig. 4 , lower consumption was observed at an initial pH of 4.0±0.2, and higher consumption was observed with an initial pH of 6.0±0.2. The profile of biomass concentration and glucose consumed during the course of growth of CS N1-4 in a batch system for 52h is presented in Fig. 5 . Biomass increased with time during the experiment while the glucose concentration decreased over time for 10gl−1 of glucose."
10,Effect of temperature,"3.4 Effect of temperature The effect of temperature on the rate of hydrogen production was also investigated in this study. The range of temperatures studied was from 25 to 40°C. The initial glucose concentration and initial pH were 10gl−1 and 6.0±0.2, respectively. The effect of temperature on fermentation medium for hydrogen production is displayed in Fig. 6 for 48h. It was observed that the rate of hydrogen production increased with increasing temperature. The best production was recorded at 37°C. This result is in agreement with the results reported by references [13,24] using other microorganisms. Further increases in temperature resulted in a subsequent reduction of hydrogen production. When comparing this result with previous work on other microorganisms, it was found that the maximum hydrogen production was at 38°C [25], 40.5°C [26], 40°C [21], and 37°C [24]."
11,Conclusion,"This study investigated hydrogen production using CS N1-4 in a batch reactor. It was found that some of the environmental parameters studied affected production, including glucose concentration, initial pH, and temperature. The optimum glucose concentration was investigated, and the highest yield of hydrogen was 3.10mol (mol glucose)−1 when an initial glucose concentration of 10gl−1 was used in TYA medium. Increasing the initial substrate concentration above 10gl−1 decreased the hydrogen production rate. Another set of tests in this study was performed by varying the initial pHs from 4.0±0.2 to 8.0±0.2. The maximum rate of hydrogen production was at the initial pH 6.0±0.2, while the minimum rate of hydrogen production was seen at initial pH 4.0±0.2. The effect of fermentation medium temperature on hydrogen production was also studied, and the best production was measured at 37°C."
