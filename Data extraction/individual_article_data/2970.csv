0,Introduction,"In recent years several dark fermentative processes of hydrogen production from sugars or waste materials have been developed in labscale [1,2]. Different reactor configurations ranging from stirred tanks [3–5] to reactors with artificially immobilized [6–8] and self-immobilized cells [9–11] have been applied to maximize H2 production. Especially high-cell-density processes led to the highest hydrogen-production rates [10–12]. Most of the microorganisms in dark fermentative systems – either in pure or mixed cultures – belong to the genera Clostridium and Enterobacter, and the fermentation patterns are often similar. That is why those processes also often share the same limitations and problems: Clostridia – produce hydrogen from anaerobic conversion of sugars to organic acids, e.g., butyric and acetic acid. Other by-products – depending on the strains, substrates and fermentation conditions – could be other organic acids, lower alcohols or solvents lowering the hydrogen yield [3,13–15]. While dark fermentations are superior compared to other biological ways in terms of hydrogen-production rate they suffer in low hydrogen yield as defined by the amount of hydrogen produced per substrate consumed [16,17]. Several carbon sources can be glycolytically degraded to pyruvate and subsequently to acetyl-CoA. Thereby CO2, reduced ferredoxin, NADH, and ATP are generated. Two molecules of acetyl-CoA yield in butyric acid while consuming NADH and thus regenerating NAD for glycolysis. Molecular hydrogen is mainly produced by oxidation of the reduced ferredoxin with ferredoxin:H+-oxidoreductase (hydrogenase). No reoxidation of NADH to NAD occurs if acetic acid is the only by-product. Therefore the redox state is not in balance. Excess NADH has to be removed by oxidation using NADH:ferredoxin-oxidoreductase. Electrons are transferred to ferredoxin which otherwise gets oxidized by hydrogenase releasing additional molecular hydrogen [18]. But the electron transfer from NADH to ferredoxin is only thermodynamically feasible if the dissolved hydrogen concentration is below a critical level. Angenent et al. [19] stated that, under standard reaction conditions and gas-saturated liquid phase, the hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor headspace must be lower than 60Pa. Then hydrogen formation can occur via the NADH:ferredoxin-oxidoreductase pathway, and it can be lower than 30kPa, so that hydrogen is released via the pyruvate:ferredoxin-oxidoreductase pathway. Higher yields and/or production rates according to the law of Le Chatelier should also be favoured at lower dissolved hydrogen concentrations [4,20–23]. Several researchers found hydrogen supersaturations in the liquid of biogas and biohydrogen fermentations. The degree of gas saturation was higher than expected from offgas analytics: Pauss et al. [24] reported 35–70 times and Frigon and Guiot [25] reported up to 13 times higher hydrogen concentrations in a methane reactor. Kraemer and Bagley [20] still measured 11-fold H2 supersaturations in hydrogen dark fermentations although nitrogen sparging was applied. Hence it is essential to discriminate between dissolved hydrogen concentrations and hydrogen partial pressures in the reactor headspace and to point out that only the dissolved gas concentrations are of importance for the microbial behaviour. Different approaches have been tried in dark fermentations to reduce dissolved hydrogen concentrations, e.g., intensive stirring [26], stripping with inert or recycle gases [4,27–30], headspace pressure reduction [22] and gas removal via silicon hollow fibres in the reactor [31]. Although some of those approaches showed significant increases in hydrogen production, the most successful cases required considerable energy or even gas input into the reactor and led to an increase in production costs or a decrease in product concentrations. None of those studies focussed directly on bubble formation in the liquid as a (or maybe the) crucial step in mass transfer of gases out of the liquid. Pauss and Guiot [32] stated that the only way to increase the mass transfer of hydrogen out of supersaturated liquids is to increase the interphasic specific area. Thus, gas supersaturations can be reduced by nucleation (commonly known as bubble formation) at pre-existing gas cavities or nucleation sites on surfaces. That means if you have supersaturated solutions you can improve bubbling with seeds in the liquid whereas there are several possible mechanisms of nucleation [33]. Monoliths provide very high specific surfaces with its uneven structure and thus can be suitable for that purpose. Despite the fact that those ceramic carriers have been originally used in catalytic reactions only some reports on their application in bioprocesses exist [34–36]. However, there is only one study using monoliths in anaerobic systems available [37]. No applications in biohydrogen production have been reported. Due to their properties monoliths should be ideal to optimize hydrogen mass transfer by enhancing nucleation, even without diluting the product or the necessity of an intensive energy input, making them subject to our study on their effect and potential application in a fermentative biohydrogen process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Strain, medium and culture conditions","2.1 Strain, medium and culture conditions Clostridium butyricum CGS2, isolated from a high-rate anaerobic hydrogen-producing reactor as previously described [38] and characterized by Lo et al. [39], was used for H2 production. To provide a viable culture over a prolonged period cell suspension was transferred monthly in sterile 100mL argon flushed serum vials containing fresh medium with the following components (given in g/L): sucrose (15), (NH4)2SO4 (3), Na2HPO4 (5), KH2PO4 (1), NaCl (2), MgSO4·9H2O (0.1), agar (2), Na2S (0.5), Resazurin (0.001). The transfer ratio was 1:25. The preculture for the experiments was obtained by transferring 1.2mL of the culture into 30mL of a modified agar-free medium as described before, containing 17.81g/L of sucrose being equivalent to a COD of 20g/L. Incubation temperature was 37°C for 48h. For the inoculation of batch and continuous experiments 30mL of the preculture were given into 270mL of anaerobic production medium as described by Wu et al. [11]. Sucrose concentration (as the sole carbon source) varied in COD between 10 and 40g/L in continuous experiments and was set to COD-value of 20g/L for batch experiments. The fermentations were not pH controlled."
3,Reactor setup,"2.2 Reactor setup Two different reactors were used. For batch and continuous experiments a column type reactor system as shown in Fig. 1 consisting of a glass column (22.5cm×4.5cm) with a maximum volume of 360mL without any internals was established. In continuous mode liquid left the reactor via an overflow pipe which accounted for additional 130mL of liquid volume. The gas from the column and the overflow was collected at the top of the reactor and went through a Ritter TG01 gas meter (Bochum, Germany). The volumes were calibrated at 25°C under normal atmospheric pressure. In continuous operation the feed entered the reactor in the middle of the column, while liquid was recycled from the top part of the column into the bottom part. Samples for optical density (OD) measurement were taken out of the recycle loop to prevent errors from cell sedimentation while samples for HPLC were taken from the overflow outlet. In batch mode the overflow, feed and recycle outlets were closed. At the top of the reactor a pH probe (Mettler Toledo, Giessen, Germany) was installed and connected to the Suntex pH-Controller PC3200 (Kunshan, Taiwan). Various numbers of cylindrical-shaped monoliths kindly provided by Rauschert Kloster Veilsdorf GmbH (Veilsdorf, Germany) made of highly porous cordierite with a height of 35mm and a diameter of 25mm were put on each other on a metal support at the bottom center of the column. Each of them accounted for approximately 10mL of loss in liquid working volume. The capillary cells of the monoliths were quadratic with a side length of 1.53mm each and walls of 0.26mm thickness resulting in 200 cells per square inch. A picture of the ceramic fitting is shown in Fig. 2 . Due to the different configurations we distinguish between the standard column reactor (SCR) without monoliths and the monolith column reactor (MCR). For comparable studies a stirred batch reactor consisting of a standard 1L bottle from Schott (Mainz, Germany) was used. Adequate stirring was accomplished with a magnetic stir bar at the bottom (3.0cm×0.6cm) rotating at 750rpm. Both reactors were set into a temperature controlled water bath."
4,Batch experiments,2.3 Batch experiments For column and stirred tank experiments the reactors (including the monoliths if necessary) were autoclaved at 121°C for 20min. Two hundred seventy milliliters of sterile production medium as described above was given into the reactor. The initial pH value of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 using 2.55mL of 5N HCl. Thirty milliliters of inoculum were given into the reactor followed by 5min of argon flushing to ensure anaerobic conditions in the reactor. After that the reactor was put into a temperature controlled water bath at 37°C. The initial batch reaction volume was 300mL. Samples of gas and liquid products were taken over the course of fermentation.
5,Continuous experiments,"2.4 Continuous experiments Continuous studies were performed using the column reactor only. The start-up was accomplished with an initial batch phase as described before. After reaching a pH of 5.5 the continuous feed was set to a dilution rate of 0.1h−1 until reaching steady-state conditions. After that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 4h, while varying the recycle ratio (as defined by the ratio of the recycle flow rate divided by the feed rate) between 3 and 10 and the sucrose concentrations between 10 and 40g COD/L. The pH of the feed was adjusted to 9.3. Samples were taken under steady-state conditions, meaning that gas production was nearly constant. If not noted differently at least four samples in equilibrium were taken until the next experiment was started."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods Gas composition (H2 and CO2) was measured with a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector as described elsewhere [40]. Concentrations of sucrose and organic acids in the filtered supernatant (0.2μm) of the fermentation broth were analyzed using HPLC (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Detailed procedures and equipment are reported in our recent work [39]. Optical density (OD) was measured at 600nm using a Hitachi U-2100 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). Cell suspensions from steady-state continuous cultures of a known OD and volume were centrifuged (3690g, 10min) and washed twice with tab water. The pellet was dried at 105°C for 48h. The cell dry weight (CDW) was calculated and resulted in 0.22g/L per unit OD600."
7,Results and discussion,
8,The effect of monolith on batch H2 production,"3.1 The effect of monolith on batch H2 production Fig. 3 compares the H2-production performance of column batch experiments using various numbers of monoliths with the stirred fermenter. Lag time varied between 12 and 18h until rapid gas production occurred, consisting only of H2 and CO2. The control experiment without any monoliths or stirring shows the lowest hydrogen-production rate and H2 yield. Table 1 summarizes the production parameters estimated by a modified Gompertz regression as described elsewhere [41]. While the stirred experiment still showed the highest hydrogen-production rate and yield, the application of monoliths in the column reactor increased the H2 yield about 50% from 0.55 to 0.82mol per mol hexose consumed, whereas the application of two and three monoliths gained similar results. Sucrose conversion was incomplete, varying from 50.6 to 57.3%. Hence, the H2 yield from total sugar is slightly better in the three-monolith experiment (0.46mol per mol total hexose) compared to the two-monolith experiment. Incomplete sucrose conversion seems to be due to a decreasing pH to values around pH 5 and low contact between substrate and cells or a substrate inhibition, since the medium composition proved to be sufficient for total sugar conversion in various studies before [6,11,39,42]. It is often reported that Clostridia neither grow nor produce hydrogen at pH values around 5 [2,38,43,44]. Generally biomass concentrations were low. None of our experiments showed the formation of granules, only suspended cells were observed. The batch growth curves in Fig. 3 show the highest biomass concentrations during stirred and non-stirred column fermentations whereas the monolith experiments only reach lower values. Subsequently the specific H2-production rates calculated from these numbers show the highest value for the three-monolith experiment, while the two-monolith experiment shows a comparable range as the stirred reactor. Increasing the number of monoliths applied increased the specific hydrogen-production rates. This indicates that the presence of monoliths improves environmental conditions. Most likely the liquid concentrations of hydrogen (and carbon dioxide) were lowered due to the increased bubble formation. Thus enhancing the mass transfer of the gaseous products out of the liquid lowers H2 inhibitions of the enzymatic hydrogen evolving steps in the broth [23,26]. Although a better H2-production performance was achieved in the stirred experiments, the monolith experiments gained remarkable results without any additional energy input. That is why this configuration was chosen for the continuous experiments. Given the fact that no stirring or pH control was applied to the system the monolith experiments led to noteworthy results in terms of specific hydrogen-production rates [38,45]."
9,Soluble metabolites in batch H2 fermentation,"3.2 Soluble metabolites in batch H2 fermentation The final soluble metabolite concentrations of the performed batch experiments are listed in Table 2 . The supernatant only contained lactate, formate, acetate, and butyrate. It can be seen that butyrate was the main by-product followed by formate and lactate in nearly equal amounts. Acetate turned out to be the least produced metabolite. Whereas the production of acetate or butyrate ideally lead to the formation of 4 or 2mol H2 per mol acid formed [46], respectively, other metabolites as lactate and biomass as well consume hydrogen or are unfavourable to H2 production when produced [46,47]. Thus, it is consistent that the experiments with the highest hydrogen yields also show the highest butyrate production. No clear trend can be seen in acetate production since its concentration scatters around 0.82g/L regardless of the numbers of applied monoliths. It is also noted that for the stirred reactor the acetate concentration was considerably higher than for the unstirred ones. Increased hydrogen yields can either be obtained by a higher acetate and butyrate production or a smaller hydrogen consumption through the production of less lactate. It could be seen from our experiments that lactate concentrations also gradually decreased up to 17% when more monoliths were applied in the column. Similar observations were seen for formate with an exception for the two-monolith batch. Increased mass transfer by intensive stirring was found to change the metabolic pattern of Clostridium batch fermentations elsewhere before [26]. Assuming that monoliths increase bubble formation and decrease dissolved gas concentrations in the liquid, our findings of lower lactate concentrations with increasing number of monoliths applied can be interpreted as the result of a lower tendency of C. butyricum CGS2 to regenerate NAD for glycolysis through electron transfer from NADH on pyruvate. In addition, the lower dissolved hydrogen concentrations shift the metabolism to a more butyrate-type fermentation in batch experiments."
10,The effect of monoliths on continuous H2 production,"3.3 The effect of monoliths on continuous H2 production Two separate sets of continuous hydrogen fermentations in the standard column (SCR) and monolith column reactor (MCR) were accomplished at different sucrose feed concentrations. Starting with a COD of 20g/L the feed concentration was stepwise shifted to a COD of 40g/L and then lowered to 10g/L. Each shift was done after the previous experiment has been measured under steady-state conditions. At a COD of 40g/L the recycle ratio in the column was kept at 3 and 10 to further investigate for mass transfer limitations. The hydraulic retention time for all investigations was set to 5.5h. Table 3 summarizes the hydrogen-production characteristics. The steady-state pH and optical density can be found in Table 4 . It turned out that the sugar conversion was incomplete in both investigated reactor configurations although the pH value was ranging well above 5.5 in all experiments. The sucrose conversion degree generally ranged between 43 and 99% and decreased with increasing substrate concentration. Conversely pH rather increased with decreasing sucrose feed concentration. Compared to the corresponding batch experiments the hydrogen-production rates increased about 60 and 45% at a COD of 20g/L without and with monoliths in the continuous fermentations, respectively. Parallel the yields increased about 29 and 13% which is due to the increased levels of the pH in the continuous fermentations. The maximum hydrogen-production rates reached 237mL/L/h at a COD of 30g/L for the SCR and 305mL/L/h at a COD of 20g/L for the MCR. Generally the production rates for hydrogen were in a narrow range for COD of 20–40g/L, but significantly above experiments with a COD of 10g/L only. Since the hydrogen yield and the sucrose conversion reach maximum values at a COD of 20g/L for both reactor configurations, a substrate inhibition above a COD-value of 20g/L is seen to be the reason for the behaviour of C. butyricum CGS2. Similar reports are available for the related strain CGS5 [38]. An insufficient contact between substrate and cells in the column reactor cannot be the reason, since the increase in the recycle ratio of reactor broth from 3 to 10 at a COD of 40g/L only showed a minor impact in the hydrogen-production performance in the SCR. Our investigations show that the MCR increased the hydrogen-production performance compared to the SCR. Hydrogen-production rates at optimum substrate concentration increased about 35% and the hydrogen yield about 30% to 0.92mol hydrogen per mol of hexose consumed. Most interestingly, as can be seen in Fig. 4 , the specific hydrogen-production rate at a COD of 20g/L increased about 60% to 292mL/h/g CDW which is a remarkable value for a non-stirred and non-pH-controlled dark fermentation [45]. However, since the optical density was rather low, the volumetric hydrogen-production rate only increased from 225mL/L/h to 305mL/L/h. The offgas only contained H2 and CO2 whereas the hydrogen concentration varied between 48 and 58%, with similar patterns in both reactor configurations. This implies that the ratio of produced H2 and CO2 was not affected, thus the slightly higher pH values in the MCR fermentations were not due to reactions between the CO2 and the bicarbonate buffer. The enhanced specific hydrogen-production rate in the MCR implies optimized fermentation conditions for C. butyricum CGS2. We believe that the high specific surfaces of the monoliths increased bubble formation in the liquid supersaturated with hydrogen and thus decreased hydrogen inhibitions."
11,Soluble metabolites in continuous H2 fermentation,"3.4 Soluble metabolites in continuous H2 fermentation Since the hydrogen-production characteristics in continuous experiments differed from batch experiments it was likely to detect changes in the concentrations of metabolic products. It can be seen from Table 4 that the predominant soluble products were lactate followed by butyrate. While lactate concentrations nearly quadrupled compared to batch experiments at a COD of 20g/L, butyrate concentrations only increased about 24 and 52% with and without the use of monoliths, respectively. Less formate was detected while the concentration of acetate was in a comparable range as in batch experiments. The MCR showed higher acetate production than the column reactor without monoliths. The strong accumulation of organic acids is seen to be the major reason for the low hydrogen yields. Overall, more soluble metabolites were produced since more sucrose was converted in the continuous runs than in the batchwise reactions corresponding to the enhanced hydrogen-production performance in the continuous system. This could be due to the increased pH value in the reactor. Maybe the higher pH also caused the shift to lactate production. Each set of experiments with COD of 20–40g/L shows comparable metabolic profiles which also correlates to their similar hydrogen-production profiles as reported in Section 3.3. Not only the runs with a COD of 10g/L show much lower concentrations of lactate and butyrate but also a much lower gas production. In general, the continuous MCR shows higher acetate and lactate concentrations while the concentrations of formate were lower compared to the runs without monoliths. Since the lactate and butyrate levels are generally high it is also possible that not a substrate but a product inhibition caused by organic acids contributed for low conversions and hydrogen production [4,48]. Although the batch monolith experiments showed decreasing lactate concentrations with increasing numbers of monoliths, in the continuous system no lactate decrease could be detected. However, the application of monoliths still increased the hydrogen production. Other possible reasons therefore include favourable H2 production due to less biomass growth, higher acetate and lower formate production, and a better contact between cells and substrate. Further investigations are necessary to understand those patterns."
12,Practical and future aspects for using monoliths in dark H2 fermentation,"3.5 Practical and future aspects for using monoliths in dark H2 fermentation Since we believe that the surface of the monoliths is important for enhancing the nucleation of gaseous products in the liquid, biofilm formation on the monoliths would limit this effect. After 3 weeks of continuous fermentation we did not observe any visible biofilms except only a staining of the monoliths due to the presence of Na2S in the medium. This finding has to be confirmed in future long-term studies. The fact that we did not observe any biofilms also underlined that our calculations of the specific hydrogen-production rates based on the suspended cells was appropriate. Although our batch studies using monoliths did not achieve a higher hydrogen-production performance than that of the stirred reactor, we still believe that the application of monoliths in dark fermentations can be of future impact since no additional energy input in the reactor is necessary to gain mass transfer enhancement. This and the fact of not diluting the product gas are the major advantages of our system compared to other methods used to increase hydrogen-production yield like gas stripping or vacuum conditions [4,20,22,27]. Since the stirred batch reactor showed the best performance in this study, a combination of monoliths and stirring might be a promising approach in the future. This study was only preliminary and we expect big potential in optimized reactor designs like stirred monolith reactors or monoliths in the recycle loops of high-density column reactors, which may lead to marked improvement in hydrogen production."
13,Conclusions,"This study was the first reported investigation of using monoliths in dark hydrogen fermentation. Since those ceramics have very high specific surfaces we wanted to see if its tendency of enhancing bubble formation in supersaturated liquids could be a benefit for bacterial hydrogen production in a column reactor without the disadvantages of other mass transfer enhancing strategies. C. butyricum CGS2 was chosen for cultivation on sucrose and showed a mixed acid fermentation pattern. First we studied the effect of monoliths in batchwise column reactions and compared them to a stirred fermentation. Although the stirred reaction showed slightly better H2-producing performance, the application of monoliths stepwise increased the hydrogen production in rate and yield without any additional energy input. Also changes in the metabolic pattern were observed when monoliths were introduced. After that continuous column reactions with and without monoliths were accomplished. This further enhanced hydrogen production. Especially the specific hydrogen-production rate was significantly enhanced through monolith application. Using different sucrose feed concentrations it turned out that the investigated strain is inhibited by sucrose concentrations equivalent to a COD above 20g/L. Our study showed that monoliths are a novel promising approach to enhance hydrogen production in dark fermentations without the drawbacks of energy or gas input and should be further investigated in future studies of this context."
