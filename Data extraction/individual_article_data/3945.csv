0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy has received growing attention as a renewable and environmental friendly fuel due to the aggravating energy crisis and environmental problems [1–3]. Since Honda and Fujishima discovered the photocatalytic water splitting on TiO2 in 1972 [4], several investigations are focused on the application of semiconductors such as oxides, oxynitrides, and metal sulfides in H2 evolution through water splitting with utilization of solar energy [5–12]. However, large bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO could only respond to light in UV range, which contains only about 4% of solar energy, and directly limit their application to a great extent [13–15]. Therefore, it remains a major challenge to develop efficient visible light photocatalysts in the field of phototcatalysts. Recently, metal sulfide semiconductors have received considerable attention for photocatalytic H2 evolution due to their appropriate bandgap and catalytic properties [16–20]. Among them, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has gained intensive interest for its visible light responding band gap, 2.49eV. However, rapid recombination kinetics of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and serious photo-corrosion result in low quantum efficiencies which limit its photocatalytic performance. Constructing ternary metal sulfides such as CdxZn1-xS provides a promising strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS. It has been reported that CdxZn1-xS is a good candidate in H2 production under visible light [20,21]. More importantly, CdxZn1-xS exhibits superior photocatalytic performance than CdS and ZnS. Although the photocatalytic behaviors of CdxZn1-xS have been investigated, serious problem of rapid recombination of electrons and holes still present and should be resolved to further improve its photocatalytic performance. Co-catalysts have been demonstrated to be an efficient way in enhancing the photocatalytic activity and stability of photocatalysts, which mainly arise from their capability in suppressing the charge carrier recombinations. Currently, noble metals have been proven to be a high performance co-catalyst because of their high work functions and low overpotentials for hydrogen evolution [22–27]. However, noble metals are usually rare elements and possess high-cost, which is detrimental for large-scale applications. Therefore, it is highly desired to find an earth-abundant and inexpensive alternative for noble metals. Numerous noble-metal-free materials have been studied as co-catalysts in the past several decades, such as transition metals [28,29], carbon-based materials [30,31], hydroxides [32–34], transition metal oxides [35–37], and sulfides [38,39], etc. Recently, several groups have shown that transition-metal phosphides, such as Ni2P [40], Cu3P [41], CoP [42] and FeP [43], can be used as co-catalyst to effectively increase the catalytic performance of photocatalysts. Compare to other noble-metal-free co-catalysts mentioned above, phosphides exhibit many attractive advantages, including high activity of hydrogen production, reasonable stability, etc. These characteristics of phosphides imply that phosphides could be potentially serve as an efficient noble-metal-free co-catalyst for CdxZn1-xS to enhance its photocatalytic performance in the photocatalytic H2 evolution. In this study, for the first time CoP decorated Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods are synthesized and investigated as a novel photocatalyst for H2 evolution. The CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid photocatalysts are prepared based on a two-step in-situ chemical deposition and low-temperature treatment method. The structural characteristics and optical properties of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite photocatalysts are analyzed. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and stability for CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S under visible light irradiation are also characterized. The possible photocatalytic mechanism for enhanced H2 evolution activity was proposed. The result demonstrates that CoP can act as an effective co-catalyst for Zn0.5Cd0.5S which gives us a revelation that it may be also potentially applied for other semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 evolution."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin), cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O, Aladdin, 98%), ethylenediamine (A.R), thioacetamide (A.R), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2, A.R), cobalt dichloride (CoCl2,Aladdin), NaOH (A.R), poly vinyl alcohol (Aldrich), Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Aladdin), ethyl alcohol (EtOH, A.R.) and lactic acid (A.R) were used as received without additional purification or treatment. Deionized water was used in all experiments."
3,Synthesis of the photocatalysts,"2.2 Synthesis of the photocatalysts The Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was prepared according to a literature method with a slight modification [44]. A total of 5mmol equimolar of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and cadmium chloride were added to 30mL of ethylenediamine followed with another addition of 20mmol thioacetamide. After vigorous stirring for 1h at room temperature, the white solution was transferred to a 50mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180°C for 24h. After that, the product was washed by centrifugation with distilled water and ethanol for several times, respectively. Finally, the final product was obtained via drying the washed solution under vacuum at 60°C overnight. The CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite catalysts were synthesized by a simple two-step in-situ reaction method [45]. At first, 2mmol Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods was dispersed in 100mL water, and a certain amount of CoCl2 was added according to designated molar ratio. After vigorous stirring for half an hour, an excess of 0.5M NaOH was slowly added and stirred for another 4h at room temperature. Then the collected precipitate was washed by centrifugation with water and ethanol for three times and dried under vacuum at 60°C overnight. Secondly, the previously obtained precipitate was placed in a crucible together with NaH2PO2, and the whole crucible was put into a tube furnace at room temperature with an orientation that the precipitate was located at the downstream side. The furnace was first heated from room temperature to 250°C in 30min, and then slowly ramped to 350°C with a rate of 1°C/min, and kept at 350°C for 2h in the atmosphere of Ar (50sccm). Finally, CoP/Cd0.5Zn0.5S composite samples with different molar contents were obtained. The molar percentages of CoP in the prepared composite catalyst were 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 9%, respectively. The deposition of Pt on Zn0.5Cd0.5S was carried out by the following experimental method [23]: 10mM H2PtCl6·3H2O, 0.1M NaBH4 and 1.0wt% poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution were prepared as stock solutions. The as-prepared Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods (0.1g) were dispersed in 50mL distilled water to form homogeneous suspension under continuous stirring. Then the H2PtCl6·3H2O stock solution and an appropriate amount of PVA solution was added (PVA/Pt=1.2, weight ratio). After that, the fresh NaBH4 solution (NaBH4/(Pt)=5, molar ratio) was also added. After stirring for 1h at room temperature, the products were washed by centrifugation with deionized water and ethanol for three times, respectively, then dried under vacuum at 60°C overnight."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα as radiation was applied to investigate the crystallographic texture of all samples with 2θ ranges from 20° to 65°. The morphology of all samples was identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, accelerating voltage 200kV). The UV–vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) of all samples was detected by Shimadzu UV-4100 spectrophotometer, and BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5300 ESCA system) was applied to analyze the element valence state of the composite sample, the signal of carbon at 284.8eV was used as a reference to calibrate the binding energies."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic H2 evolution was carried out in a 300mL quartz reactor (Perfectlight Labsolar IIAG system), connected with a low-temperature thermostat bath to keep the reaction temperature at 4°C during the characterization. A 300W xenon arc lamp with a 420nm cut-off filter (PLS-SXE 300UV) was used to simulate the visible light source. The illumination intensity was adjusted to 11.0mW/cm2. In a typical photocatalytic H2 evolution experiment process, 50mg of catalysts was dispersed in 100mL of mixed aqueous solution containing 90mL water and 10mL sacrificial agent (lactic acid) with constant stirring. Before photocatalytic experiments, the reaction system was evacuated for 30min to create an anaerobic condition. A gas chromatography (Beifen 3420A, TCD) was selected to analyze the products, and high purity Argon was utilized as carrier gas."
6,SPV measurements,"2.5 SPV measurements The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement was carried out on a surface photovoltage spectroscopy (PL-SPS/IPCE1000 Beijing Perfect Light Technology Co, Ltd). The measurement system is composed of a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford research systems, Inc.), a light chopper (SR 540, Stanford research systems, Inc.), and a sample cell, respectively. The entire measurement was operated under ambient condition."

8,Characterization of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples,"3.1 Characterization of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples The phase purity and crystal structure of as-prepared products was first characterized by XRD analysis. The XRD patterns of as-prepared CoP are demonstrated in Fig. 1 (a). Typical diffraction peaks corresponding to CoP (2θ=31.68°, 36.41°, 46.32°, 48.21°, 52.31°, 56.86°) are observed, which are in good agreement with (011), (111), (112), (211), (103) and (301) of orthorhombic CoP in JCPDS No. 29-497 respectively. The representative XRD patterns of CoP/Cd0.5Zn0.5S are shown in Fig. 1(b), data of the standard card of hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S (JCPDS No. 89-2943) are also shown as reference. The main peaks of 2θ at 26.11°, 27.76°, 29.62°, 38.49°, 46.02°, 50.25° and 54.58° can be readily indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) planes of hexagonal Zn0.5Cd0.5S, respectively. It is obvious that deposition of CoP did not affect the crystal structure of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. However, no apparent diffraction peaks of CoP were observed in all composite samples, which may indicates that the CoP depositing content in CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S is low and insensitive for XRD characterization. Nevertheless, the presence of CoP in the composites can be easily proved by TEM and XPS techniques as will be discussed later. TEM was further applied to investigate the microstructures of Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), it can be seen that the pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample has a rod-like morphology with diameter of 80 nm∼ 120nm. After the chemical reduction deposition of CoP on Zn0.5Cd0.5S, CoP was deposited as nanoparticles on the Zn0.5Cd0.5S surface with high dispersion, and there is no obvious change in the microstructure of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods (Fig. 2(c)). Fig. 2(b) and (d–f) present the HRTEM images of the Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample and CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite, different orientations and interplanar spacing was revealed. The identified lattice fringes of 0.32nm corresponds to the (002) lattice plane of Zn0.5Cd0.5S phase. In addition, an interplanar spacing of 0.19nm can be seen which was ascribed to CoP [46]. Fig. 3 displays the elemental distribution maps (Zn, Cd, S, Co and P respectively), the result of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S shows that elements of Zn, Cd, S, Co and P can be clearly observed. It is found that Zn, Cd, S, Co and P elements distribute almost uniformly in the surface of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which further confirmed the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite photocatalysts were prepared successfully. The TEM results indicate that close contacted interfaces are formed between CoP and Zn0.5Cd0.5S components in the composite sample, which could serve as a role for effective improvement of the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons-holes. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of as-prepared Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples were performed to determine their light-absorbing ability. As shown in Fig. 4 , the pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample shows absorption from UV to the visible range with an abrupt decline at ∼500nm, indicating that the visible light absorption is ascribed to the band gap transition [23]. The band gap value of Zn0.5Cd0.5S is about 2.48eV determined by Tauc's plot as shown in Fig. 4 insert, which is consistent with the value reported previously [49]. After introduction of CoP co-catalyst, the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S samples show a similar absorption edge in shape and exhibit remarkably improved light absorption intensity compared with pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S in the visible region. The absorption intensity of the as-prepared samples is strengthened with increasing CoP contents, which agrees with the color of the prepared samples that vary from light yellow to dark gray. However, if excessive CoP co-catalysts are introduced, CoP NPs may cover on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and will compete with Zn0.5Cd0.5S to adsorb the visible light, which can inhibit the light absorption of Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalysts and may have negative effect on the photocatalytic activity [24,50]. The DRS results further confirm that the chemical in-situ deposited CoP has considerable effect for efficient utilization of visible light. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was explored in order to gain deeper insight into the surface deposition of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample. Fig. 5 (f) presents the survey spectrum of the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample, which proves the co-existence of Zn, Cd, S, Co and P elements as expected. In the Zn 2p and Cd 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 5(a) and (b)), the binding energies of Zn 2p (1021.7eV and 1044.8eV) and Cd 3d (405.0eV and 411.7eV) agree well with the values reported in the previous work [24]. The S 2p XPS binding energy can be divided into three peaks located at 161.3eV, 161.6eV and 162. 6eV, which can be assigned to the S2− state [24]. As shown in Fig. 5d, The Co 2p peaks located at 778.3eV and 793.7eV are in accordance with the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 in the CoP. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5e, the peak at 129.7eV which belongs to the P(2p) species in CoP is negatively shifted compared to that of elemental P (130.2eV) [45,46]. The shifts of the binding energies (BE) of Co(2p) and P(2p) regions indicate that Co carries a partial positive charge (δ+) while P has a partial negative charge (δ−). The binding energy at 133.8eV is ascribed to oxidized P species due to the superficial oxidation of CoP upon exposing to air [46]."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity The photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S and comparative samples were shown in Fig. 6 . The control experiment of H2 evolution evaluation over pure CoP sample is also carried out; the result shows that the pure CoP sample shows no H2 evolution activity. The pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample without CoP exhibited a photocatalytic H2 production activity of 37umolh−1. After introducing of CoP, the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production is significantly enhanced. Fig. 7 presents the H2 evolution rate of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples with different CoP contents. After loading 0.5% CoP on Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods, the H2 evolution activity is remarkably increased to 281umolh−1. Along with the increase of CoP amounts, the H2 evolution is further improved. The 5% CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample presents the highest H2 evolution activity with a H2 evolution rate of 734umolh−1, which is 20 times higher than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S and 2 times higher than that shown in Pt decorated Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Meanwhile, the results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the photocatalytic activity of the simple mechanical mixture of CoP particles and Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods is much weaker than that of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, the enhanced photocatalytic performance may be attributed to the intimate interfaces between CoP and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which can effectively promote the separation efficiency of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. However, a further increase of CoP content leads to a decrease in H2 evolution rate. The decrease in the photocatalytic activity may be due to the high loading ratio of black CoP, which can inhibit the incident light absorption of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, leading to decreasing the number of photo generated electrons [47]. Moreover, the DRS results show that the excessive CoP will compete with Zn0.5Cd0.5S to adsorb the visible light. Thus, the competition of light absorption should be another key parameter leading to decrease of H2 evolution rate. Therefore, a suitable amount of CoP is important for optimization of the photocatalytic activity of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite samples. Fig. 8 illustrates the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of ZnxCd1-xS and CoP/ZnxCd1-xS samples. After loading 5% CoP co-catalyst on ZnxCd1-xS nanorods, and all samples show significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The stability of a photocatalyst is highly critical for its practical applications. The catalytic stability of the 5% CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample was further investigated via cycling experiments of photocatalytic H2 evolution. Fig. 9 illustrates the H2 evolution curves in cycling photocatalytic run. The H2 production does not display obvious decrease after irradiated for 16h (4 cycles), which indicates that the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst has sufficient stability for photocatalytic H2 production."
10,Photocatalytic mechanism investigation,"3.3 Photocatalytic mechanism investigation Based on the microstructure characterizations and the visible light photocatalytic performance of CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S, a possible mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution of the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst is proposed. As illustrated in Fig. 10 , Zn0.5Cd0.5S absorbs photons and excites electron-hole pairs under visible-light irradiation. However, without the co-catalyst, the photo-generated electrons and holes are likely to recombine rapidly which results in a low photocatalytic H2 production activity. As the conduction band edge and valance band edge of CoP are determined to be −0.43eV and 1.3eV [45,48] and the conduction band edge and valance band edge of Zn0.5Cd0.5S locate at −1.06eV and 1.42eV [49], respectively. However, the pure CoP NPs act only as cocatalyst and show no photocatalytic H2 evolution activity in this study. After introduce of CoP co-catalyst, the CoP NPs show higher electron-capture capability due to their low Fermi level so that photo-generated electrons can be stimulated to quickly transfer from the conduction band (CB) of Zn0.5Cd0.5S towards CoP surface, leading to efficient separation of the photoexcited hole-electron pairs. It also indicates that CoP NPs can act as electron collector and transporter to prolong the lifetime of the charge carriers, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity [45]. In addition, the CoP and Zn0.5Cd0.5S can closely bound together and form intimate interfaces, which can offer a larger active surface area and maximize the electrons transfer efficiency. The holes in the valence band (VB) of Zn0.5Cd0.5S are captured and consumed by lactic acid sacrificial regents. To further verify the mechanism, surface photovoltage characterization (SPV), a powerful technique for investigating the separation of carriers, is performed. Fig. 11 presents the SPV spectra of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods composites with different molar ratios of CoP. The results indicate that all samples show a strong response at the wavelength region from 300nm to 500nm, which corresponds with the band gap of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. In addition, the 5%CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample shows a much stronger response than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S, indicating that the separation efficiency of charge carriers in composite samples is much higher than that in pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S [23]. However, if excessive CoP is introduced, the light absorption by Zn0.5Cd0.5S is reduced as excess CoP NPs prevent the light absorption from reaching the Zn0.5Cd0.5S surface, which leads to a decrease of the SPV signal in comparison to that of the 5% CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample. The results of SPV spectra and photocatalytic H2 evolution illustrate that the band alignment and tight interface present between CoP and Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods plays an important role in charge carriers separation, which promote the transition of electrons from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to CoP, and in turns enhance the photocatalytic activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, a highly efficient composite and noble-metal-free photocatalysts CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S were prepared based on a two-step in-situ chemical deposition method. The CoP NPs are dispersed uniformly on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods and form intimate contact interfaces. A highest H2 amount as high as 734umolh−1 was obtained in 5%-CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample, which was 20 times than that for pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S and 2 times higher than that for Pt loaded Zn0.5Cd0.5S. In addition, the 5%-CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample exhibited a good stability in time-circle experiments. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of suppressed charge recombination and promoted charge transition at the CoP/Zn0.5Cd0.5S interface is proposed to explain the observed H2 evolution activity enhancement in CoP decorated Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample, which was later confirmed by the surface photovoltage (SPV) technique. Therefore, the results illustrate that CoP is a promising co-catalyst for Zn0.5Cd0.5S, which can be also potentially used in photocatalytic H2 production process for other photocatalysts."
