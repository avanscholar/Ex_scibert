0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass, which generally consists of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is considered to be a promising alternative for nonrenewable fossil resource in high quality fuel and chemical production (Liao et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2013). By comparison with carbohydrate (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin is more recalcitrant because of its complex structure and chemical bonding methods (Li et al., 2015). However, as the most abundant natural aromatic polymer on the globe, lignin is an excellent sustainable raw material for lots of aromatic chemicals and high quality fuel. Additional, this polymer is produced at a very large amount as the by-product from biorefinery and pulping industry. For example, lignosulfonate, a typical lignin resource in black liquor from paper industry, is closed to 50 million tons per year (Hu et al., 2018). It is well known that direct discharging of this material results in a huge resource waste and serious environment pollution, therefore, novel strategies for the high-valued use of renewable lignosulfonate become urgent and crucial. Hydrogenolysis is an efficient approach for lignosulfonate valorization due to the potential to obtain commercial aromatic fine chemicals and low oxygen-contained biofuel, and the efficient char elimination (Wang et al., 2017, 2018). Conventional noble metals (such as Pt, Pd and Ru) and non-noble materials (such as Ni and Fe) are generally used in this issue with good to excellent catalytic activities under high-pressure molecular hydrogen (usually 4.0 MPa) (Li et al., 2015). However, it is well known that, the application of noble metal and high-pressure hydrogen brings lots of difficulties in the industrial process, for example, the intensive concerns on the catalyst cost and equipment safety. Instead, hydrogen transfer is more attractive because of the absence of molecular hydrogen and almost the same hydrogenation performance as that with hydrogen (Galkin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017), so it is regarded to be a promising alternative for the high pressure hydrogenolysis. Emulsion reactor overcomes the solubility and incompatibility problems of polar and non-polar reactants. Thus, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds can dissolve and accumulate at the oil-water interface. And this interface is highly reactive towards the two otherwise incompatible reagents and shows a significant surface intensified effect (Kandasamy and Shaleh, 2018; Walstra, 1993). Previous work demonstrated that more than three times of process efficiency could be obtained in an n-butanol/water emulsion system by contrast of that without emulsion (Cai et al., 2015). However, the phenolic monomer yield and product selectivity should be improved though 89.1% of lignin conversion was shown (Cai et al., 2015). Herein, this n-butanol/water emulsion microreactor with the self-surfactant of lignosulfonate, which generally shows better surfactivity than organosolv lignin (Heitner et al., 2010), was proposed for the enhancement of lignin selective depolymerization and phenolic monomer production via hydrogen transfer. The effects of emulsion reactor composition, catalyst, hydrogen donor and reaction condition parameters were extensively studied. Additionally, different lignin resource was also investigated to examine the feedstock adaptability, because many previous studies demonstrated that lignin resource normally had a remarkable effect on the depolymerization performance (Zakzeski et al., 2010)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials All reagents were of analytical grade. Raney Ni, alkali lignin and dealkaline lignin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Beijing, China) and used as received. The sodium lignosulfonate was provided by Xingzhenghe Chemical Factory Co. Ltd. (Shenyang, China). The organosolv lignin was separated according to the method shown in previous work (Cai et al., 2015). The proximate and elemental analysis results of these lignin resources could be found in the Supplementary data. Dimethyl phthalate was purchased from J&K China Chemical Ltd (Beijing, China). n-Butanol, isopropanol, n-hexane and other reagents were purchased from Guanghua Chemical Factory Co. Ltd. (Shantou, China) and re-purified prior to use."
3,Typical process for lignin depolymerization,"2.2 Typical process for lignin depolymerization The hydrogen transfer reactions were carried out in a 50 mL stainless autoclave. In a typical run, 0.5 g sodium lignosulfonate, along with a certain amount of Raney Ni, and a solvent contained 5.0 mL water, 15 mL isopropanol, 5.0 mL butanol and 0.5 mL hexane, which constructed the emulsion under the self-surfactivity of sodium lignosulfonate, were loaded into the reactor in sequence. After evacuating of air, 1.0 MPa nitrogen was purged into the autoclave. Then, it was heated to the designated temperature (443–483 K) and maintained for a desired time (1.0–2.5 h)."
4,Product separation and characterization,"2.3 Product separation and characterization After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature using flowing water in 30 min. Once the pressure was released, the catalyst was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was layered into two phase after a few minutes. Then, a phase separation was conducted in a separating funnel. The water phase was extracted by n-butanol for three times. The organic phase from the reaction system and that for product extraction were combined together, and then it was diluted into 50 mL using fresh n-butanol. The incompletely reacted lignosulfonate was recovered from the water phase by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, and then it was dried at 383 K overnight for further characterization. The volatile chemicals were identified and quantitatively measured on an Agilent 7890/5977A gas chromatography with both mass spectrometer and flame ionization detectors (GC-MS-FID). Dimethyl phthalate (purity >99%) was used as the internal standard compound. The structural information of original and recovered lignosulfonate were obtained on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer with a KBr pelleting method. The C, H, N and S contents of original and recovered lignosulfonate were measured on a vario EL III element analyzer. The quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra of raw and recovered lignosulfonate were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer. Detailed procedures can be found in the Supplementary Data."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Lignosulfonate depolymerization in emulsion microreactor,"3.1 Lignosulfonate depolymerization in emulsion microreactor Table 1 summarizes the results of catalytic depolymerization performance of sodium lignosulfonate in traditional and emulsion reactors. It can be seen that, in conventional solvent, for example, single solvent of water or the mixture of water and alcohol, 53.4 to 65.4 mg·g−1 of total phenolic monomer yield can be obtained at 473 K for 2.0 h. However, 116.1 mg·g−1 of those chemicals is given when the lignosulfonate is degraded in a mixture of H2O, isopropanol, and n-butanol at the same condition. Of particular, 39.3 mg·g−1 of them is found to be 4-ethyl guaiacol, a key and versatile starting material in polymers, medicines and pesticides (Das and Halgeri, 2000). These yields of phenolic monomers and 4-ethyl guaiacol are almost twice of that from solvent of H2O, H2O/i-PrOH or H2O/n-BuOH. This 4-ethyl guaiacol yield is also higher than that from petrochemical route (Das and Halgeri, 2000), indicating that 4-ethyl guaiacol production from the industry waster of black liquor is feasible and realizable. As shown in the Supplementary Data, further investigation using microscope (OLYMPUS BX53) shows an obvious emulsion at this condition. Therefore, the enhanced lignosulfonate catalytic depolymerization performance should be attributed to the process intensification effect in the emulsion system (Kandasamy and Shaleh, 2018) which greatly increased the phase interface and decreased the interfacial tension, leading to higher reactivity of lignosulfonate. Appropriate ratio of H2O and oil (n-butanol) is beneficial for the stability of emulsion reactor (Walstra, 1993). Thus, with the increase of H2O dosage, both the phenolic monomer and 4-ethyl guaiacol are declined. For example, when the H2O amount increases from 5.0 to 15 mL, the phenolic monomer and 4-ethyl guaiacol yield decrease from 116.1 and 39.3 mg·g−1 to 75.0 and 24.8 mg·g−1 respectively. The same change tendency can be observed from the effect of n-butanol amount, where only 82.7 and 27.2 mg g−1 of phenolic monomer and 4-ethyl guaiacol yields are shown at the n-butanol dosage of 15 mL. Isopropanol is the hydrogen donor in this catalytic system, so the absence of isopropanol caused insufficient hydrogen generation, which hinders the hydrogen transfer reaction of lignosulfonate afterwards. Instead, at higher isopropanol amount, higher lignosulfonate catalytic depolymerization performance is exhibited. In addition, in comparison with traditional lignin depolymerization process, a remarkable advantage of this emulsion microreactor is the handy product separation. After the hydrogen transfer reaction and the cleavage of characteristic chemical bonds, the self-surfactivity of lignosulfonate is decreased, which leads to an automatic demulsification. As a result, a distinct phase separation is shown, in which, phenolic monomers are enriched in the oil phase (n-butanol soluble fraction) and the incompletely decomposed lignosulfonate are remained in the water soluble fraction."
7,Investigation of transfer hydrogenolysis conditions,"3.2 Investigation of transfer hydrogenolysis conditions The catalytic depolymerization performances of lignosulfonate over various catalysts are first investigated. The results listed in Fig. 1 a demonstrate that only 14.8 mg g−1 of phenolic monomer yield can be obtained in the absence of catalyst. The metallic nickel supported on basic or acidic carrier facilitates the cleavage of the chemical linkages of the lignin molecule (Li et al., 2015), so a promoted performance is shown. For example, the 4-ethyl guaiacol and total phenolic monomer yields increase from 8.8 and 14.8 mg g−1 to 12.1 and 34.6 mg g−1 respectively when 15% Ni/zirconium phosphate (Ni/ZrP) is employed. Raney Ni usually shows better catalytic hydrogenation activity than supported Ni-base material at mild condition (Li et al., 2015), thus it leads to a significant increase of 4-ethyl guaiacol and phenolic monomer yields (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b illustrates that catalyst dosage has a crucial influence on the lignosulfonate depolymerization and 4-ethyl guaiacol production. When the catalyst dosage increases from 0.5 to 2.0 g, the yields of 4-ethyl guaiacol and phenolic monomers are gradually increased from 2.3 and 29.5 mg g−1 to 39.3 and 116.1 mg g−1 respectively. And then, they are slightly decreased with the continuous increase of catalyst amount (Fig. 1b). GC–MS analysis result listed in the Supplementary Data demonstrates that this lignosulfonate depolymerization process is very complex on the volatile products distribution. Besides traditional phenolic monomers, aliphatic components such as alcohols and methyl cyclohexane are also detected. These aliphatic compounds are generally originated from the hydrogenation of phenolic monomer (Li et al., 2015). Normally, Raney Ni acts as catalyst for three consecutive processes in this lignosulfonate transfer hydrogenolysis, including hydrogen production from isopropanol, lignosulfonate hydrogenolysis, and hydrogenation of phenolic monomers. Therefore, the increase of catalyst dosage enhances the hydrogen production and lignosulfonate hydrogenolysis at the amount below 2.0 g, which results in the improvement of 4-ethyl guaiacol and phenolic monomer yields. However, over excess catalyst dosage, the following phenolic monomer hydrogenation is promoted. Therefore, the reduction of phenolic monomers occurs with the increase of aliphatic compounds, which are 28.0 and 48.9 mg g−1 respectively at the Raney Ni dosage of 2.0 and 2.5 g. The effects of reaction temperature and time had also been investigated. It is well known that, lignin is the predominantly stable component in biomass due to its complex molecular structure and high chemical bond energies (C–C: 384 kJ mol−1 and C–O: 314 kJ mol−1) (Li et al., 2015). Therefore, when reaction temperature is below 463 K, the yields of 4-ethyl guaiacol and phenolic monomers are slightly changed with the increase of temperature. However, when the temperature is elevated to 473 K, the yield of phenolic monomers sharply increases to 116.1 mg g−1 because of the promoted C–O cleavage at elevated temperature (Fig. 1c). It then decreases to 101.7 mg g−1 when the temperature reaches to 483 K (Fig. 1c). This decrease can be attributed to the condensation of phenolic oligomer which occurs along with the lignosulfonate depolymerization (Long et al., 2015). Meanwhile, the results listed in Fig. 1c demonstrate that the yield of 4-ethyl guaiacol lineally increases from 35.5 to 39.3 mg g−1 when the reaction temperature elevates from 443 to 473 K. After that, it slight decreases to 37.6% at 483 K because of the over-hydrogenation (Li et al., 2015). Comparatively, the effect of reaction time is relatively unremarkable though a same change tendency is exhibited (Fig. 1d). At the optimized reaction time of 2.0 h, a peaked catalytic depolymerization performance is achieved, and then it gradually decreases at the prolonged retention time of 2.5 h (Fig. 1d). This yield decrease after 2.0 h can also be attributed to the condensation of lignosulfonate depolymerization products, which reduces the yield of volatile product (Fig. 1d). Certainly, the hydrogenation of phenolic monomer also makes a contribution on this phenolic monomer decline. Furthermore, the effect of hydrogen donor is investigated on the lignosulfonate depolymerization. Fig. 1e depicts that all investigated alcohols show good hydrogen donating ability, yielding 29.2 to 45.5 mg g−1 of 4-ethyl guaiacol. Meanwhile, the total phenolic monomer yield suffers an increase with the prolonged of carbon chain when it is less than three, which can be attributed to the increasing hydrogen donating ability (van der Waal et al., 1998). After that, it decreases from 116.1 to 64.4 and 80.3 mg g−1 in the presence of 2-butanol and 3-pentanol respectively. Moreover, the transfer hydrogenolysis of various lignin materials is further studied under the optimized condition of 473 K for 2.0 h. The results show that lignin resource has a remarkable effect on the microreactor efficiency (Fig. 1f). It can be partly ascribed to the structural difference of lignin, which finally affects its self-surfactivity and depolymerization performance (Li et al., 2015)."
8,Comparative characterization of raw and recovered lignosulfonate,"3.3 Comparative characterization of raw and recovered lignosulfonate In general, lignin contains three main structural units: hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S), and these structural units showed different depolymerization performances in the hydrogenolysis (Li et al., 2015). GC–MS result illustrates that guaiacol and its derivate are the main components (62.16%) in the volatile product, whereas, the content of syringol is very low (0.4%). Quantitative 13C NMR analysis, further demonstrates that the ratio of S and G (S/G) increases from 0.73 to 0.82 after depolymerization (Supplementary Data). Therefore, it is believed that G-lignin is more flexible than S-lignin to be converted in this catalytic system. FT-IR is thereby applied to obtain more understanding on the lignin structural evolution during this process. It shows that the raw lignosulfonate demonstrates a typical lignin structure. The characteristic functional groups of Ar-OH (3412 cm−1), CO (1718 cm−1) and benzene ring (1605, 1461, 1426, 1263 and 842 cm−1) are clearly exhibited (detailed assignments of the FT-IR absorption bands can be found in the Supplementary Data) (Mayo et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2013). Noticeably, the FT-IR spectra of the recovered lignosulfonate from various reaction temperatures have no obvious difference in comparison with that of raw lignosulfonate, where a characteristic FT-IR absorption of benzene ring can be observed as well. It suggests the insignificant change of the “core structure” of lignosulfonate. However, FT-IR spectra also illustrate that the absorption band at 1718 m−1 is weakened in the recovered lignosulfonate. This FT-IR absorption band is designated as the unconjugated CO stretching of lignosulfonate (Mayo et al., 2004). It implies the stripping of carbonyl group, giving carbonyl-contained compounds in the volatile products. In addition, an obvious decrease of peak strength at 1512 and 1263 cm−1 is exhibited at the FT-IR spectra of recovered lignosulfonate in comparison with that of raw material, suggesting the effective depolymerization of G-lignin. This phenomenon accords well with the GC–MS result, where most of volatile products are composed of 4-ethyl guaiacol and its derivate. Elemental analysis is further used to comparatively characterize the original and recovered lignosulfonate from various reaction temperatures. The results listed in Supplementary data show that the recovered lignosulfonate has almost similar elemental components as the raw material, further verifies the insignificant structure change of lignosulfonate in this process. However, due to the efficient transfer hydrogenolysis, the molar ratio of H and C (H/C) of the lignosulfonate has a dramatic increase. For example, when it is treated at 473 K, the H/C increases from 1.434 to 1.680. Supplementary data also demonstrates a slight increase of carbon content (39.62%) and decrease of H/C (1.523) when the lignosulfonate depolymerization is carried out at 483 K, which should be attributed to the repolymerization of phenolic oligomer from the lignosulfonate degradation, resulting in lower volatile products yield as well (Fig. 1c)."
9,Conclusion,"An emulsion microreactor is constructed using industrial Raney Ni as catalyst and isopropanol as hydrogen donor, which shows a substantial process intensified effect on the lignosulfonate transfer hydrogenolysis. At mild condition of 473 K, 116.1 mg g−1 of volatile product can be obtained. Especially, 39.3 mg g−1 of these compounds is 4-ethyl guaiacol, a versatile bulk petrochemical, indicating that fine chemical production from renewable lignin is feasible and realizable. Therefore, the present work has a great potential in future lignin selective utilization due to its high efficiency, mild reaction condition, cheap catalyst, and the absence of molecular hydrogen."
