0,Introduction,"Catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions are commonly used in the chemical industry, and such reactions involving oxygenated compounds are particularly important in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals [1–3]. Many of these reactions are conducted in the liquid phase, with or without a solvent, typically under constant H2 [2]. The hydrogenation of furfural occupies a unique position among organic compounds capable of yielding a variety of products by catalytic hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of furfural is of important industrial significance since its product furfuryl alcohol, is widely used producing various synthetic fibers, rubbers, resins and farm chemicals [4,5]. Furfuryl alcohol is also used as a non reactive diluent for epoxy resins, modifiers for phenolic and urea resins, oil-well sand consolidation, solvent, production of tetra hydro furfuryl alcohol and other chemical synthesis. Various Cu-based catalysts are studied for the vapor phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol [6–11]. With the development of amorphous and nanometer materials, some ultra-fine amorphous powders such as Ni–P, Ni–B, Ni–P–B, Co–B and Ni–Fe–B amorphous alloy powders have been used for the liquid phase selective hydrogenation of furfural [12–15]. Recently few works concerning the hydrogenation of furfural over heterogeneous catalysts have been published. Some of these are carbon-supported copper, Raney Ni, Nickel amorphous alloy mixed copper zinc oxides with Al, Mn and Fe [4,9,13,16–18]. Homogeneous complexes of Ru, Rh and Pt are also reported as active catalysts for the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol [19]. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol gives cyclohexanone, i.e., a significant product used in the synthesis of raw material for the manufacture of nylon-6,6 and nylon-6 [20,21]. Copper based catalysts viz., Cu–MgO, Cu–ZnO, Cu–Al2O3, Cu on carbon-covered alumina and CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 are also reported extensively for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol either in liquid or vapor phase [22,23]. We have reported high yields of FFA, Cyone dehydrogenation over Cu–MgO and simultaneous hydrogenation & dehydrogenation reaction using Cu/MgO & Cr promoted Cu/MgO catalyst by coprecipitation at atmospheric pressure [24–26]. The furfural hydrogenation processes mentioned above require either to be operated under pressure or use large amounts of hydrogen along with furfural. Cyclohexanol dehydrogenation being endothermic is an energy intensive process. Our recent US patent disclosed the advantage of combining both these hydrogenation–dehydrogenation reactions over Cu–MgO catalysts to over come the equilibrium limitations in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol and utilization of the hydrogen produced in this process to carry out hydrogenation of furfural there by avoiding the external pumping of hydrogen [27]. The present process, which applies in-situ generation and application of H2 in the reaction i.e., without using an external H2 source, can be seen as a novel and an economically viable process. Although there are certain reports on this type of coupling reactions, which involve catalytic hydrogen, transfer [7,28–35]. The present report is the first attempt in combining two industrially important reactions viz., an exothermal furfural hydrogenation and endothermic equilibrium constrained cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. Furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation processes employ mostly Cu-based catalysts, there are no reports on the combined reaction of these two processes over a single catalyst system. While environmentally friendly Cu–MgO catalysts using different promoters viz., cobalt, zinc, iron, chromia, palladium and nickel catalysts are reported in the present work. By using these promoters the selectivity to desired products enhanced and in simultaneous reaction the conversion of both furfural and cyclohexanol also increased compared to unpromoted Cu–MgO catalyst."
1,Experimental method,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The catalytic hydrogenation of furfural and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol both individually and in combination were carried out on different promoters viz., cobalt, zinc, iron, chromia, palladium and nickel promoted Cu–MgO catalysts designated as CM, CM-Co, CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Cr, CM-Pd and CM-Ni. All the chemicals used for the preparation of catalysts were of LOBA chemie make. The Cu–MgO i.e., CM catalyst was prepared in the percentage weight ratio of 22:78 of Cu:MgO by simultaneous precipitating of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (M/S. Loba Chemie Ltd., India), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (M/S. Loba Chemie Ltd., India) using an aqueous solution containing 1 M K2CO3·3H2O (M/S. Loba Chemie Ltd., India) at a pH of 9 under continuous stirring. The precipitate was then washed until pH of 7 to get CM gel. The gel was filtered and dried in an oven for 12 h at 383 K. The dried sample was then subjected to calcination in air at 723 K for 4 h to get CM catalyst for reaction. The reason for selecting the ratio Cu:MgO as 22:78 is that our earlier study on the furfural hydrogenation activity of the Cu/MgO catalysts revealed this composition to be the optimum one in fetching higher yields of the desired product [24]. In a similar manner the different promoters were incorporated on Cu–MgO dried catalyst with percentage weight ratio of Cu:MgO promoter as 22:77:1 and designated as CM-Co, CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Cr, CM-Pd and CM-Ni respectively. The promoted catalysts have been prepared by wet-impregnation method by taking requisite amounts of aqueous solutions of metal prcursors (corresponding nitrates over the dried Cu/MgO catalyst, dried and calciend at 723 K for 4 h in air."
3,Characterization of catalysts,"2.2 Characterization of catalysts The XRD patterns of the catalysts in calcined and reduced forms were recorded on a M/S. Rigaku’s Miniflex diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kα as a radiation source and at a 2θ scan speed of 2o/min. The crystallite size of Cu was calculated by XLB method on the same instrument. All the catalysts were characterized for specific surface area by N2 adsorption at 77 K by BET method using a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2700 instrument. Before measurements, the samples were oven dried at 393 K for 12 h and flushed in-situ with He gas for 2 h. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies of the catalyst were performed on a home-made micro reactor with 6% H2–Ar as reducing and carrier gas. The temperature has been increased linearly at a ramp of 5 kmin−1 from room temperature to 973 K where the isothermal conditions were maintained for 30 min. The change in the H2 concentration was monitored by micro TCD and recorded on GC- workstation. M/S. Kratos Axis 165 XPS spectrometer, with Mg-Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) was used for obtaining XPS data. XPS analysis was used to study the chemical composition and oxidation states of the element on the catalyst surface. In the XPS study, C 1s line binding energy value of 285 eV (accuracy with in ±0.2 eV) as a reference level and the relative atomic sensitivity factors of 4.871 and 0.168 for Cu2p3/2 and Mg 2p, respectively were chosen for determining Cu/Mg surface composition. Prior to the XPS studies, all the catalysts have been reduced in 6% H2 balance He flow at 523 K for 4 h. During the data acquisition the background pressure was kept low at 10−10 bar."
4,Activity measurements,"2.3 Activity measurements Both the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone were carried out separately in vapor phase, in a fixed bed quartz reactor (200 mm long and 8 mm i.d). About 1 g of catalyst packed at the center of reactor between two plugs of quartz wool was reduced in a flow of 6% H2 in He mixture at 523 K for 4 h followed by lowering the temperature of the reactor to 453 K and replacing the H2/He mixture with ultra pure H2 (99.9% H2 which is further purified by passing through de-oxo and molecular sieve traps in a series to remove oxygen and moisture, respectively). Hydrogenation of furfural reaction was carried out by injecting furfural at a flow rate of 1 ml/h with the help of a syringe pump (Secura FT, M/S. B. Braun, Germany) with H2/furfural molar ratio = 2.5 and at a reaction temperature of 453 K. For dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol the reaction temperature of 523 K was maintained. For both the reactions the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was maintained at 0.05 mol h−1 g cat−1. In the combination reaction, cyclohexanol:furfural ratio is maintained at 5:1. The product mixture was collected every hour in an ice-cold trap and analyzed by a GC–MS (QP-5050, M/S. Shimadzu instruments, Japan) using a DB-5MS capillary column of 0.32 mm dia. and 25 m length (M/S. J & W Scientific Instruments, USA)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,BET-surface area and XRD results,"3.1 BET-surface area and XRD results The physical characteristics viz., BET-surface area, crystalline phases determined by XRD analysis and the crystallite size calculated from the X-ray line broadening analysis (XLB) of the various promoted Cu–MgO catalysts studied are presented in Table 1 . The crystallite size of Cu0 has been calculated by X-ray line broadening technique using Debye–Scherrer equation, D = kλ/βCosθ where k = 0.9 and D corresponds to Cu-Crystallite size. Though there is no significant variation observed in the surface areas of the promoted Cu–MgO catalysts from the unpromoted one which is found to have a BET-surface area of 42 m2 g−1, the crystallite size of Cu on the promoted catalysts however reduced considerably from 69 nm (on the unpromoted Cu–MgO) to ∼40–50 nm. The predominant phases observed in the XRD analysis of calcined catalysts (figure not shown) are CuO (diffraction lines with d values of 2.52x, 2.32x and 2.535; ICDD file No.5-661) and MgO (d values of 2.11x, 1.495 and 1.221; ICDD file No. 4-829). Cu2O phase (d values at 2.47x, 2.144 and 1.513; ICDD file No. 5-667) is observed as a minor one in all the catalysts. No d-lines of promoters corresponding to the oxides of Co, Zn, Fe, Cr, Pd and Ni are observed in any of the catalysts which may be due to the low amounts of the promoters (1 wt.%) taken suggesting that these promoters were present either in X-ray amorphous form or as the particles below X-ray detection levels. The XRD results of Cu–MgO reduced catalysts (Fig. 1 ) viz., CM, CM-Co, CM-Cr, CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Pd and CM-Ni have shown the formation of Cu0 phase (d values of 2.09x, 1.815 and 1.282; ICDD file No. 4-836) along with MgO phase and Cu2O as a minor one."
7,TPR results,"3.2 TPR results Fig. 2 represents the TPR profiles of unpromoted Cu–MgO and promoted Cu–MgO catalysts. A two-stage reduction of copper species has been observed in all the samples. The first peak observed with T max in the range of 523–563 K can be attributed either to a partial reduction of CuO → Cu2O or to the reduction of highly dispersed copper oxide species include isolated copper ions [36]. The second peak at ∼673–713 K may be ascribed either to the complete reduction of Cu2O → Cu0 or to the reduction of bulk like CuO phases that include large clusters and bulk CuO. Isolated copper ions are reported to react easily with other components of the sample and form various surface copper components of different reducibility [37]. This may be the reason for the shift in the T max in the promoted catalysts as compared to the unpromoted one. A low temperature shift in the T max of the first peak in CM-Co, CM-Cr and CM-Fe along with CM clearly indicate the higher dispersion of copper oxide species responsible for their easier reduction. This seems to be reason behind the slightly higher activity observed with these catalysts in all the individual hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and coupling reactions."
8,XPS results,"3.3 XPS results The catalysts have been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to obtain more information about the Cu oxidation state and the chemical compositions in the samples. Cu2p XPS spectra of Cu–MgO (CM) and Cu–MgO incorporated with different promoters viz., Co, Zn, Fe, Cr, Pd and Ni reduced catalysts with Cu contents are shown in Fig. 3 . All the catalysts show the presence of Cu2p3/2 peak in the range of 933–934 eV. A clear separation of peaks corresponding to Cu0 and CuO is not observed in the XPS spectra. However, Carley et al. have ascribed a peak corresponding to smaller particles of Cu0 with a surface coverage of 6 × 103 atom cm−3 [38]. The binding energy values Cu2p3/2, Mg2p, O1s, C1s and M2p3/2 along with the Cu/Mg atomic ratios, Cus/Cup (intensity ratios of the Cu2p satellite peak and Cu2p parent peak) are presented in Table 2 . C1s (285.0 eV) is taken as the reference in calibrating the binding energies of the all the other elements viz., Cu, Mg and O. The presence of another minor band of C1s at 289 eV in some of the samples indicates carbon contamination due to CO3 2- species with the exposure of the samples to air. The higher Cus/Cup observed in case of CM samples probably indicate the presence of more Cu2+ or CuO species compared to CM-Co and CM-Cr, but other catalysts did not show any shake up peaks. The satellite peaks observed in case of Cu+2 compounds are due to the shake up transitions by ligand → metal 3d charge transfer [38]. These satellite peaks are not seen in Cu+ compounds or in metallic Cu because of completely filled 3d shells. The Cu/Mg ratios of the samples clearly demonstrate higher concentration of Cu on the surface in CM, CM-Co, CM-Cr and CM-Fe samples as compared to others. Though CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Pd and CM-Ni samples do not show any satellite peaks because of unclear resolution of CuO and Cu0 peaks, presence of CuO species cannot be ruled out on the surface as XRD patterns of all reduced samples did not show any CuO peaks yet CM, CM-Co and CM-Cr have shown the presence of these satellite peaks. However, the O 1s spectra of CM, CM-Co and CM-Cr samples also showed the presence of two peaks corresponding to CuO and MgO at ∼530 eV and 532 eV respectively. The O1s spectra of all the remaining samples which did not show the presence of any satellite peaks of Cu2p displayed only one peak ∼532 eV which seem to be that of only MgO. The M2p3/2 peak in the samples CM-Co, CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Cr and CM-Ni clearly indicated the presence of their corresponding metal oxides viz., Co2O3, ZnO, Fe2O3, Cr2O3 and Ni2O3 respectively. But, the presence of both metallic Pd and palladium oxide could be seen in the XPS pattern of Pd3d5/2 of CM-Pd sample indicating a partial reduction of palladium precursor (PdCl2) possible in the hydrogen atmosphere [39]. The Mg2p binding energy values are almost the same in the range of 49–51 eV in all the samples indicating the presence of MgO."
9,Activity studies,"3.4 Activity studies The independent hydrogenation reaction is carried out at 453–523 K and independent dehydrogenation reaction is carried out at 453–573 K. The combination of furfural hydrogenation and cyclohexanol dehydrogenation has been carried out in vapor phase atmospheric pressure and the reaction temperature at 473 K. The steady state conversion values at a reaction runtime of 6 h have been taken for the sake of comparison in these reactions. 3.4.1 Furfural hydrogenation Fig. 4 A and B show the hydrogenation activity data ie., hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA) in the temperature range of 453–523 K Fig. 4A clearly shows a steady increase in the conversion levels of furfural over all the catalysts with temperature. The selectivity towards the FFA reduced with increase in the reaction temperature especially in CM-Cr, CM-Zn, CM-Fe, CM-Pd and CM-Ni catalysts on account of formation of the other side-products as shown in Fig. 4B. The formation of side-products may be expected with the ring hydrogenation (CC hydrogenation) taking place at these temperatures [40]. But in CM-Co catalysts both the conversion and selectivity of FFA are stable upto 6 h at all temperatures. This may due to the higher surface area and lesser crystallite size on the surface of the support. Our previous results on the hydrogenation of furfural over Cu–MgO catalysts showed a similar trend [24]. At 473 K the conversion and selectivity to FFA are optimum upto 6 h in CM-Co catalyst. Thus, 473 K seems to be an optimum temperature yielding higher amount of FFA over all the catalysts in the present study. Among all these catalysts, CM-Co showed higher ability in yielding the desired product, furfuryl alcohol. The presence of more Cu0 species has been attributed to the presence of defect sites of MgO which are reported to be more reactive and that the adsorption properties for metal species can be qualitatively different from those of regular surface sites [41–45] However in the present study we observed the presence of Cu+2 species along with Cu0 species in Cu–MgO catalyst at the surface as well as in the bulk. 3.4.2 Cyclohexanol dehydrogenation The dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol (CyOH) is known to be an equilibrium-controlled reaction [46]. Fig. 5 A and B show an increase in cyclohexanol dehydrogenation with rise in temperature over all the catalysts except CM catalysts. At 523 K over the CM catalyst the conversion is 64.3% and at 548 K onwards the conversion drastically decreased due to formation of coking or sintering of the catalyst. The selectivity of cyclohexanone (Cyone) on CM catalyst is 100% at all temperatures [25]. All the promoted Cu–MgO catalysts exhibited high yields of cyclohexanone >60% at 523 K. However the selectivities on these catalysts as shown in Fig. 5B decreased with rise in temperature, because of formation of other products viz., cyclohexene, phenol etc., through the side-reactions such as dehydration taking place at the elevated temperatures. Thus, the incorporation of promoters seems to stabilize the activity but at the cost of selectivity to desired product. 3.4.3 Combination reaction Fig. 6 shows the activities of the six different catalysts studied. All these catalysts are studied at the optimum reaction temperature of 473 K. The results displayed in the table clearly indicate the advantageous role played by chromia in showing high activity towards furfuryl alcohol formation with 71.56% of furfural conversion and 28.37% of cyclohexanone formation. The activity of the catalysts are found to be in the order CM-Cr > CM-Pd > CM-Fe > CM-Ni > CM-Co > CM-Zn in terms of conversion of CyOH and in the order: CM-Cr > CM-Zn > CM-Fe > CM-Pd > CM-Ni > CM-Co in terms of conversion of FAL. The selectivities of both FFA and Cyone on all the catalysts are found to be 100%. The chromia promoted Cu–MgO catalyst has shown higher activity compared to the unprompted Cu–MgO (not shown in Fig) and other Cu–MgO promoted catalysts. The reason may be attributed to the stabilization of surface Cu0 or Cu+ species by chromia as observed from the XPS results and to the presence of easier reduction of Cu species from TPR analysis. Finally the combination of cyclohexanol and furfural as Eq. (1) gives a better thermal balance through hydrogen transfer between the two reactants. Various reports reveal the selective nature of Cu-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO bond in the side group leaving CC bonds intact in the furan ring [40,47–49]. Rao et al. made an extensive study and proposed a surface mechanism explaining the hydrogenation of furfural over copper chromite catalyst by a Langmuir–Hinshelwood model with a competitive adsorption between furfural and hydrogen either on one type of site or two different sites with each reactant on one site [16]. They opine that Cu+ species are involved in the catalytic process and the presence of Cu0 sites is also required for activation of H2. Medvedeva et al. have reported the presence of only Cu0 as the active sites in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol [50,51]. However, in the kinetic studies reported by Fridman et al. they suggested two different mechanisms viz., one on Cu+ species over Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 catalysts and the other over Cu0 species over Cu–MgO catalysts [52]. They suggested that cyclohexanol adsorption on zero valent copper sites is dissociative and proceeds by the rupture of the O–H bond. The formation of adsorbed species of cyclohexanol alcoholate which acts, as an intermediate for the formation of cyclohexanone by the abstraction of the nonhydroxylic hydrogen is further found by them to be the rate determining step. We opine that in this coupling reaction a dissociative adsorption of cyclohexanol on metallic copper forms an alcoholate and hydrogen followed by the abstraction of α-hydrogen takes place. FAL either in gas phase or in adsorbed form on yet another active site (Cu0 or Cu+) interacts with the dissociated hydrogen (from the first step) in two steps forming FFA. Finally the advantages of this combination reaction is mainly the elimination of external hydrogenation source as in-situ generation of hydrogen from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol is utilized and thus seems to be an economical route in the synthesis of furfuryl alcohol from furfural. The foremost of all advantages is the achievement of enhanced yields of furfuryl alcohol and considerably good yields of cyclohexanone by employing the combination reaction. All the promoters though have shown good activity towards both individual and coupling reactions of hydrogenation of FAL and dehydrogenation of CyOH, chromia promoted catalyst showed higher activity over the unpromoted catalysts. The other unpromoted catalysts though showed equivalent activity with the unpromoted and chromia promoted Cu–MgO towards the individual reactions, failed to show the same in the coupling reaction. The easy reducibility, higher dispersion of Cu, higher enrichment of active species on the surface and all these factors that are responsible for a higher synergism between Cu and MgO in presence of chromia that may probably be responsible in stabilizing the active species of copper (either Cu0 or Cu+) might be the reason behind the higher activity observed over chromia promoted Cu–MgO catalyst."
10,Conclusion,"Incorporation of various promoters viz., Cr, Co, Zn, Fe, Pd and Ni in Cu–MgO by impregnation method resulted in good activity towards the individual hydrogenation (of FAL) and dehydrogenation (of CyOH) reactions. However, except for chromia other promoters fail to show higher activity than either CM or CM-Cr towards the coupling reaction of FAL hydrogenation and CyOH dehydrogenation. CM-Cr is found to the best in achieving higher yields in the coupling reaction of FAL and CyOH. The combination of FAL and CyOH reactions is found to be advantageous in mainly eliminating the external pumping of H2 thus making it an economical route in the synthesis of both FFA and Cyone. Coupling this reaction with the hydrogenation of furfural can also compensate the thermodynamic equilibrium constraints in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanone. The promotional effect of Cr in enhancing the activity of Cu–MgO may be due to the stabilization of active species, Cu0/Cu+ by Cr which also seem to increase the synergism between Cu and MgO as observed from the higher dispersion and easier reducibility of copper oxide over the Cr promoted catalyst."
