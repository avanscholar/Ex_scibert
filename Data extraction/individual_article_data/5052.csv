0,Introduction,"Nowadays, the most commonly found concern when using conventional energy resources, such as coal, fossil fuel, and natural gas, is environmental issue because a large amount of CO2 is released to atmosphere, causing global warming [1,2]. A possible effective solution is to use alternative energy resources, such as solar energy, wind energy, tide power, and geothermal energy. Several research attempts have been focused on renewable H2 production for the future need because H2 can directly serve as a fuel (e.g. for transportation and for electricity generation in fuel cells) without producing any harmful pollutants upon its combustion [3–5]. The photocatalytic water splitting using a suitable semiconductor photocatalyst is a promising process since it is an ideal process for producing renewable H2 energy. This is principally because it is produced from two major renewable sources by using water as a feedstock and solar light as an energy source [6–21]. A number of researchers have extensively investigated the photocatalytic water splitting for H2 production by using various oxide semiconductor powders as the photocatalyst. The oxide semiconductor photocatalyst is usually used in the form of solid phase, which is relatively inexpensive, safe for operation, and resistant to deactivation [22,23]. Apart from the most widely used TiO2 photocatalyst [23–28], perovskite titanates (e.g. MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3) also show high photocatalytic activity because they possess a layered structure, which leads to several advantages, such as enhanced charge separation, excellent thermal stability, and high chemical stability [29–32]. However, it is rather difficult to directly apply these wide band gap energy photocatalysts (band gap energy, Eg > 3.2 eV) for the photocatalytic water splitting since it can only be effective for the H2 production under UV light irradiation (wavelength < 400 nm). As a matter of fact, UV light accounts for only 8% of the incoming solar spectrum as compared to visible light, which occupies the most part of solar spectrum (42%). Therefore, in order to achieve efficient water splitting under abundant visible light irradiation, it is inevitably required to develop new photocatalytic H2 production system. The development of the photocatalytic system capable of using visible light region of the solar spectrum can be achieved by modifying a photocatalyst in many ways, such as anion doping, metal ion doping, noble metal loading, and addition of sensitizer [7,24]. So far, only a few research works have applied the modification of the perovskite titanate photocatalysts to make them able to respond to visible light for the photocatalytic H2 production, e.g. nitrogen doping (anion doping) of SrTiO3/TiO2 composite [33], copper doping (metal ion doping) of CaTiO3 [34], and platinum loading (noble metal loading) of CaTiO3 [35]. The sensitization of photocatalyst (using dyes in most cases) is a promising technique because it captivatingly enables the use of photocatalysts that do not intrinsically absorb visible light. Some dye sensitizers, such as [Ru(dcbpy)2(dpq)]2+ [36] and Ru(bpy)3 2+, or Eosin Y (E.Y.), [18,37,38], have been reported to be able to absorb visible light and generate sufficiently strong electrons as water-reducing agent to produce H2. In order to regenerate the electron-deficient sensitizer in this photocatalytic system, some electron donors, or sacrificial agents, such as diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA), have been used by adding to a reaction solution to sustain the photoreaction cycle [7,39]. However, to our knowledge, the dye sensitization of the perovskite titanate photocatalysts for H2 production from the water splitting reaction has not yet been reported. In our previous works [40,41], the photocatalytic H2 production from the water splitting reaction via the direct photoexcitation of the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 perovskite nanocrystal photocatalysts, without and with metal loadings, in the presence of hole scavengers was systematically investigated under both UV and visible light irradiation. With a continuation of the achievement of the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 perovskite nanocrystal photocatalyst development, the purpose of this present work was, therefore, to investigate the photocatalytic H2 production via the dye sensitization by using various mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate photocatalysts and E.Y. sensitizer under visible light irradiation, for the first time, in the presence of DEA or TEA as an electron donor. The mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate nanocrystal photocatalysts synthesized via a sol-gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant were used for the photocatalytic activity tests, as compared to the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts. The effects of various synthetic conditions of the mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate nanocrystal photocatalysts on their physicochemical properties and photocatalytic H2 production activity, as well as the effects of various reaction conditions, were investigated."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Tetraisopropyl orthotitanate (TIPT, Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, Merck) and alkaline earth nitrates—magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Ajax), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Ajax), and strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2, Merck)—were used as precursors of alkaline earth perovskite titanates (MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3). Acetylacetone (ACA, CH3COCH2COCH3, Rasayan) was applied to inhibit the hydrolysis and condensation processes of the titanium precursor. Ethyl alcohol (EtOH, CH3CH2OH, Carlo Erba) was used as a solvent. Laurylamine hydrochloride (LAHC, CH3(CH2)11NH2·HCl, Merck) was used as a structure-directing surfactant. Hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Aldrich) was used as a precursor of Pt cocatalyst. Diethanolamine (DEA, (HOCH2CH2)2NH, Ajax) and triethanolamine (TEA, (HOCH2CH2)3N, Ajax) were used as electron donors for photocatalytic H2 production. Eosin Y (E.Y., C20H6Br4Na2O5, Aldrich) was used as a dye sensitizer. The commercial SrTiO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and P-25 TiO2 (J.J. Degussa Hüls Co., Ltd.) were used for comparative studies on photocatalytic activity."
3,Photocatalyst synthesis procedure,"2.2 Photocatalyst synthesis procedure The mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate (MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3) nanocrystal photocatalysts were synthesized via a sol-gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant under mild conditions, according to our previous works [40–42]. Firstly, ACA was added into TIPT at an equimolar ratio. Then, the mixed solution was allowed to cool to room temperature (∼25 °C). An LAHC surfactant solution was prepared by dissolving LAHC in EtOH at room temperature. Afterwards, an appropriate amount of the corresponding alkaline earth nitrate dissolved in distilled water was added to the surfactant solution with continuously stirring at room temperature to obtain a clear solution, based on the alkaline earth metal-to-Ti molar ratio of 1:1 and LAHC-to-(alkaline earth metal + Ti) ratio of 0.25:1. The LAHC/alkaline earth nitrate solution was then slowly dropped into the TIPT/ACA solution while stirring continuously at room temperature to obtain transparent yellow sol. The additional Pt loading step via a single-step sol-gel (SSSG) method was performed by introducing an amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O for a desired Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% in the as-prepared SrTiO3 sol, followed by continuously stirring at room temperature for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous solution [40,41,43] (The Pt loading was performed only on the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 nanocrystal photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C because it exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 production activity among the three investigated perovskite titanate nanocrystal photocatalysts, as described later in Section 3.2.1). The sol-containing solution was placed in an oven at 80 °C for 2 d in order to attain complete gel formation. The gel was dried at 80 °C for 2 d to eliminate the solvents, which were mainly EtOH and distilled water used in the preparation of the LAHC/alkaline earth nitrate solution. Finally, the obtained dried gel was calcined at various calcination temperatures (450–700 °C) for 4 h to remove the LAHC surfactant and the chemically bound remaining solvents from the dried gel framework and to accordingly achieve the mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate nanocrystal photocatalysts."
4,Photocatalyst characterizations,"2.3 Photocatalyst characterizations The thermal decomposition behavior of the dried gels and their suitable calcination temperature were investigated by using a thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG–DTA, Perkin Elmer/Pyris Diamond). Each dried gel was heated with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air atmosphere by using α-Al2O3 as the reference. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained by a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer (Quantachrome/Autosorb I). Each photocatalyst sample was first outgassed to remove the humidity and volatile species adsorbed on the surface under vacuum at 150 °C for 2 h prior to the analysis. The Dollimore-Heal (DH) method using desorption data was used for determination of mean pore size and pore size distribution. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (Rigaku/Rint 2200 HV) was used to identify phases present in the samples. The diffractometer was equipped with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.542 Å) and operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. Each photocatalyst sample was scanned up to 2θ of 80° in a continuous mode with the rate of 2°/min. The crystallite size of the photocatalysts was calculated by the Debye-Scherrer formula [44]. A UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) was used to determine light absorption ability of the photocatalysts. The analysis was performed by using BaSO4 as the reference. The sample morphology was observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2000 CX). The TEM was operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV in bright field mode. The elemental analysis of photocatalysts was also investigated by an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer attached to the TEM."
5,Photocatalytic H2 production system,"2.4 Photocatalytic H2 production system Photocatalytic activity testing was performed in a closed-gas Pyrex glass reactor at room temperature. The schematic of photocatalytic H2 production system used in this work is illustrated in Fig. 1 . In a typical run, a specified amount of each of the investigated photocatalysts—the synthesized mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3; the 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3; as well as the commercial SrTiO3 and commercial P-25 TiO2—was suspended in 150 ml of a DEA or TEA aqueous solution containing dissolved E.Y. sensitizer by using a magnetic stirrer. Prior to the reaction, the mixture was purged with Ar gas bubbling for 45 min in a dark environment to establish adsorption equilibrium, as well as to remove the air from the photocatalytic reactor. The reaction was commenced by exposing the mixture to visible light irradiation from a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Type KXL-300/WACOM Electric, light intensity = 2.6 mW/cm2), emitting light with wavelengths longer than 400 nm using a UV cut-off filter (B-48S/ATG). The gaseous sample in the reactor headspace was periodically withdrawn by a gas-tight syringe and analyzed for H2 produced by a gas chromatograph (GC, PerkinElmer/ARNEL) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Photocatalyst characterization results,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization results 3.1.1 TG–DTA results Fig. 2 shows the TG–DTA curves of the dried synthesized MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 gels. The DTA curves showed several exothermic peaks, which can be divided into four regions, and this thermal decomposition behavior was observed for all of the dried synthesized perovskite titanate gels. The details of the regions of exothermic peaks and their corresponding weight losses of all the dried perovskite titanate gels are summarized in Table 1 . The first region can be attributed to the removal of physisorbed water and EtOH. The second region can be attributed to the burnout of the LAHC surfactant. The third region can be attributed to the removal of remnant carbons and strongly chemisorbed water. The fourth region can be attributed to the crystallization process of the photocatalyst and the decomposition of solvents that are tightly bonded in the molecular level with alkaline earth (Mg, Ca, and Sr) and Ti metals in the gel network [40]. However, the temperature ranges of these regions of each perovskite titanate photocatalyst were somewhat different because the interaction of each species in gel network might be different. The TG results reveal that the calcination temperature of approximately 500 °C for the MgTiO3 photocatalyst and 650 °C for the CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 photocatalysts are sufficient for both the LAHC surfactant removal and complete photocatalyst crystallization. However, the calcination temperature in the range of 450–700 °C was used to investigate its effect on crystallinity, surface area, and consequent photocatalytic H2 production activity, since the optimum calcination temperature for each perovskite titanate photocatalyst differently existed in this temperature range, as described later in Section 3.2.1. 3.1.2 N2 adsorption–desorption results The adsorption–desorption isotherms of the synthesized MgTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 500 °C, the synthesized CaTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 550 °C, and the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C (which provided the highest photocatalytic H2 production activity for each investigated perovskite titanate nanocrystal photocatalyst series calcined at different temperatures, as described later in Section 3.2.1) are exemplified in Fig. 3 , in which those of the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts are also included. The isotherms of all the synthesized photocatalysts exhibited typical IUPAC type IV-like pattern with a distinct hysteresis loop, which is the main characteristic of mesoporous materials (mesoporous size between 2 nm and 50 nm) according to the classification of IUPAC [45]. A sharp increase in adsorption volume of N2 could be observed at high relative pressure (P/P0). This sharp increase greatly results from the capillary condensation of N2 inside the mesopores, indicating the fairly small pore size of the samples because the P/P0 position of the inflection point directly relates to the pore dimension. The isotherms of the synthesized 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst also exhibited IUPAC type IV-like pattern with a distinct hysteresis loop (data not shown), showing quite similar adsorption–desorption behavior to the unloaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst. This suggests that the Pt loading by the SSSG method in this present work did not significantly affect the mesoporous structure of the photocatalyst; therefore, its mesoporous structure could be maintained. The isotherms of the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts, however, corresponded to IUPAC type II-like pattern [45]. They possessed non-mesoporous characteristic due to the absence of a distinct hysteresis loop, indicating that no capillary condensation of N2 occurred inside the pores, and their pore structure was mainly a macropore (pore diameter > 50 nm). The insets of Fig. 3 show pore size distributions calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherms by the DH method. All of the synthesized perovskite titanate photocatalysts, except the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts, relatively possessed narrow pore size distributions in the mesoporous region, whereas the pore size distributions of the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts were quite broad and were not mainly present in the mesoporous region. The textural properties obtained from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, i.e. BET surface area, mean mesopore diameter, and total pore volume, of all the investigated photocatalysts are summarized in Table 2 . It is clearly seen that the BET surface areas and total pore volumes of all the synthesized photocatalysts tended to decrease with increasing calcination temperature, whereas the mean mesopore diameter of the synthesized MgTiO3 and CaTiO3 photocatalysts tended to increase; however, the mean mesopore diameter of the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst remained almost invariant with calcination temperature. The synthesized photocatalysts possessed the mean mesopore diameter located in the narrow range of 3–16 nm, identifying the good quality of the samples. The evident loss in the BET surface area can be possibly ascribed to the pore coalescence due to crystallization of wall separating the mesopores [46]. Interestingly, the BET surface area of the 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst was slightly higher than that of the unloaded SrTiO3. This can be possibly explained in that the loaded Pt could stabilize the SrTiO3 framework to a certain degree and consequently increase the BET surface area due to its high dispersion on the SrTiO3 mesoporous surface [41]. Even though the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts showed no main characteristic of the mesoporous structure, their BET surface areas were as high as 35.6 and 65.0 m2/g, respectively, possibly due to their specific commercial production processes. Nevertheless, they exhibited comparatively lower photocatalytic H2 production activity, as described later in Section 3.2.1. 3.1.3 TEM-EDX results Fig. 4 shows the exemplified TEM images of the synthesized MgTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 500 °C, the synthesized CaTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 550 °C, and the synthesized SrTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C, which exhibited the highest photocatalytic H2 production activity for each perovskite titanate series (see Section 3.2.1). The quite uniform nanoparticles with three-dimensionally disordered agglomeration were observed for all of the investigated photocatalysts. The average particle sizes of the synthesized MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 nanoparticles were approximately in the ranges of 5–15 nm, 20–35 nm, and 20–35 nm, respectively. In order to obtain the particle size of the loaded Pt, the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and EDX mapping analyses of the synthesized 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . The Pt nanoparticles could be clearly seen as spherical dark patches due to their high electron density, as confirmed by the EDX mapping. The average particle sizes of the Pt nanoparticles were in the range of 10–15 nm. According to the N2 adsorption–desorption (i.e. IUPAC type IV-like sorption isotherms with a distinct hysteresis loop) and TEM (i.e. nanoparticles with three-dimensionally disordered agglomeration) results, the mesoporous structure of the synthesized perovskite titanate photocatalysts possibly results from the mesopores formed among the photocatalyst nanoparticles due to their assembled agglomeration [40–43,46,47]. 3.1.4 XRD results The XRD patterns of the mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate photocatalysts, i.e. MgTiO3 calcined at 450–650 °C, CaTiO3 calcined at 500–650 °C, and SrTiO3 calcined at 550–700 °C, are shown in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6 a, the dominant peaks of the rhombohedral MgTiO3 structure at 2θ of about 32.9°, 35.5°, 40.6°, 49.2°, 53.6°, 62.1°, 63.7°, and 71.1° represent the indices of (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (124), (300), and (1010) planes [48], respectively. This crystalline phase was clearly observed for the samples calcined between 550 °C and 650 °C; however, at the calcination temperatures of 450 °C and 500 °C, the amorphous phase was dominantly observed. The results suggest that the transition temperature of the MgTiO3 to crystallize to its preferentially formed rhombohedral structure was around 500 °C, which agrees well with the TG–DTA results (Table 1). Therefore, when the calcination temperature was increased from 500 °C to 550 °C, the rhombohedral MgTiO3 structure became the main crystalline phase. From Fig. 6 b, the dominant peaks of the cubic CaTiO3 structure at 2θ of about 33.2°, 47.6°, 59.2°, 69.6°, and 79.1° represent the indices of (110), (200), (211), (220), and (310) planes [48], respectively; and from Fig. 6 c, the dominant peaks of the cubic SrTiO3 structure at 2θ of about 32.4°, 39.9°, 46.4°, 57.8°, 67.8°, and 77.2° represent the indices of (110), (111), (200), (211), (220), and (310) planes [48], respectively. As also included in Fig. 6 c, the cubic SrTiO3 structure was observed for the commercial SrTiO3 photocatalyst with slightly higher crystallinity than the synthesized mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst. The XRD pattern of the synthesized 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst was also quite similar to that of the unloaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst (data not shown). The dominant peak of Pt at 2θ of about 39.7° could not be observed since its peak position is almost the same as a diffraction peak of the cubic SrTiO3 structure. However, the existence of Pt was confirmed by using the TEM-EDX analyses, as explained above (Fig. 5). In addition, the XRD pattern of the commercial P-25 TiO2 photocatalyst is shown in Fig. 6 d. It can be seen that the commercial P-25 TiO2 photocatalyst possesses the combined crystalline structure of the anatase and rutile phases with approximately 26% rutile content [46]. The phase identification and the crystallite size of all the investigated photocatalysts are summarized in Table 3 . The crystallite size of the photocatalysts was calculated from the line broadening of the most preferentially formed diffraction peak of each crystalline phase according to the Debye-Scherrer formula [44], as shown by the following equation: L = k λ β cos ( θ ) where L is the crystallite size, k is the Debye-Scherrer constant usually taken as 0.89, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (0.15418 nm for Cu Kα), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak measured at 2θ, and θ is the diffraction angle. From Table 3, the crystallite sizes of all the perovskite titanate photocatalysts were in the narrow range of about 26–32 nm. The results clearly revealed that with increasing calcination temperature, the larger crystallite size of the photocatalysts was obtained. It is interestingly observed that the crystallite size of the Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 was lower than that of the unloaded SrTiO3. This implies the role of Pt precursor incorporation during the sol-gel process in stabilizing the SrTiO3 gel framework from coalescence upon the calcination, as aforementioned, leading to the obtained higher surface area (Table 2). 3.1.5 UV–visible spectroscopy results UV–visible spectroscopy was used to examine the light absorption ability of the synthesized mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate photocatalysts, as well as Eosin Y (E.Y.) solution used as the sensitizer for the photocatalytic H2 production. Fig. 7 depicts the UV–visible spectra of the mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate photocatalysts, including MgTiO3 calcined at 450–650 °C, CaTiO3 calcined at 500–650 °C, and SrTiO3 calcined at 550–700 °C. The results of onset absorption wavelength and corresponding band gap energy of all the investigated perovskite titanate photocatalysts obtained from the UV–visible spectra are summarized in Table 4 . It is clearly seen that the absorption bands of the mesoporous-assembled perovskite titanate photocatalysts were mainly in the UV light range of 200–400 nm. The band gap energy (Eg , eV) was determined by extrapolating the onset of the rising part to x-axis (λg , nm) of the plots, as shown by a dotted line in Fig. 7, and calculated by the following equation [49]: E g = 1240 λ g where λg is the onset absorption wavelength (nm) of the photocatalyst. The band gap energies of the mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3 calcined at 450–650 °C, CaTiO3 calcined at 500–650 °C, and SrTiO3 calcined at 550–700 °C were approximately 3.35–3.37 eV (λg ∼368–370 nm), 3.55–3.59 eV (λg ∼345–349 nm), and 3.22 eV (λg ∼385 nm), respectively. From the results, it was clearly found that the SrTiO3 photocatalyst possessed the narrowest band gap energy, implying that it could be excited by the lowest energy level. However, it can be noticed from the light absorption ability of all the investigated perovskite titanate photocatalysts that they could absorb only UV light with wavelength shorter than 400 nm. Moreover, from Table 4, the band gap energy of the synthesized 0.5 wt.% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 was approximately 3.12 eV (λg ∼398 nm), which becomes closer to the visible light energy. It also had a higher visible light absorption ability than the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 and the commercial SrTiO3 (without Pt loading), as clearly verified by their onset absorption wavelengths (Table 4). In order to substantiate that the Eosin Y (E.Y.) is a visible light-responding sensitizer, its UV–visible spectrum was also measured, as shown in Fig. 8 . It is clearly seen that the E.Y. sensitizer can mainly absorb the visible light with the maximum absorption centered at 516 nm. This absorption characteristic strongly suggests that the E.Y. sensitizer ought to be excited by visible light for the sensitized photocatalytic H2 production system in this present work [46]."
8,Photocatalytic H2 production results,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 production results 3.2.1 Effect of photocatalyst type For the photocatalytic reaction experiments, 0.2 g of different types of the investigated photocatalysts was suspended in 150 ml of 15 vol% DEA aqueous solution containing dissolved 0.1 mM E.Y. at room temperature, and the mixture was used for the comparative photocatalytic H2 production tests. For the studied system, there was no detected H2 production in the absence of visible light irradiation, indicating the importance of the irradiation of visible light for sensitizing the E.Y. to its excited state and consequently generating electrons transferring from the excited E.Y. to the photocatalyst conduction band for subsequent H2 production reaction. The results of the photocatalytic H2 production rates of the mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 photocatalysts calcined at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the maximum H2 production rates of the mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 photocatalysts were found at calcination temperatures of 500 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C, respectively. Among the investigated photocatalysts calcined at their optimum temperatures, the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst provided the highest H2 production rate (0.068 cm3/h), possibly because it principally possessed the narrowest band gap energy (Table 4), thus allowing to have the highest driving force for the electron transfer from the excited E.Y. to its conduction band. The photocatalytic activity of the MgTiO3 photocatalyst was lower than that of the SrTiO3 photocatalyst possibly because the easily formed defect titanate center within the MgTiO3 sublattice acts as a recombination center [50]. Even though the CaTiO3 photocatalyst could produce hydrogen from the sensitized photocatalytic water splitting, its photocatalytic activity was still lower than that of the SrTiO3 photocatalyst, as also observed by Zieliňska et al. [32]. The possible explanation for these results requires further detailed investigation on the molecular structures and band potential characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticle photocatalysts. Fig. 10 shows the comparison of the H2 production rates of the mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 photocatalysts calcined at their optimum temperatures, as compared to the 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C (the optimum calcination temperature for the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst) as well as the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts. It was found that when the Pt nanoparticles of 0.5 wt% loading, acting as the active sites for H2 production [35,43,46], were deposited on the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst surface, the H2 production rate was enhanced remarkably from 0.068 to 0.33 cm3/h, being the highest photocatalytic activity among all of the investigated photocatalysts. This strongly confirms that the Pt loading can be employed to greatly improve the H2 production rate. In addition, the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C (even without Pt loading) was experimentally found to provide a higher H2 production rate than both the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts, possibly because it predominantly exhibited the mesoporous characteristic with narrow pore size distribution in the mesoporous region, whereas both commercial photocatalysts (even they possessed higher BET surface areas, as shown in Table 2) exhibited mostly the macroporous characteristic with very broad pore size distributions extended into the macroporous region (Fig. 3). This verifies the significance of the mesoporous structure of the photocatalyst for the photocatalytic H2 production activity [40,41,47]. 3.2.2 Effect of electron donor type and concentration In the photosensitized H2 production system, the electron donors (or sacrificial reagents), which were DEA and TEA used in this present work, play a vital role in regenerating the oxidized sensitizer (electron-deficient sensitizer). In order to achieve a higher photosensitized performance in converting the absorbed light to H2 energy, both the fast electron injection and slow backward reaction are required. Thus, the effects of type and concentration of electron donor working as the sensitizer regenerator are necessary to be investigated. As clearly seen from the previous section that the synthesized 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst exhibited the highest performance for the photocatalytic H2 production, it was therefore selected for further investigation of the effects of electron donor type and concentration on the H2 production activity in this section. Fig. 11 shows the H2 production rates of the 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst using either DEA or TEA electron donor at various concentrations. The results show that no H2 production was experimentally observed under visible light irradiation from the E.Y.-containing system without dissolved DEA or TEA (i.e. electron donor concentration of 0 vol.%). Moreover, when either the DEA or TEA concentration increased, the photocatalytic H2 production activity increased until reaching the maximum at 15 vol% and 10 vol.%, respectively, exhibiting the H2 production rate of about 0.33 and 0.28 cm3/h, respectively. The further increase in their concentrations negatively affected the H2 production rate. It was found that at any given concentration, the DEA facilitated the H2 production more than the TEA, as also observed by Jin et al. [39]. This might be attributable to a higher electron-donating ability of N atom in the DEA molecule than that in the TEA molecule, resulting from a less bulky molecular structure of the DEA due to a shorter chain length of its hydrocarbon part. Moreover, when using methanol instead of the DEA or TEA, no H2 production was experimentally observed under visible light irradiation (data not shown). Normally, methanol is an effective electron donor for the photocatalytic water splitting under UV light irradiation, where it directly scavenges the photogenerated holes at the photocatalyst valence band [7,8]. However, in this investigated sensitized system, methanol did not work as the electron donor at all, verifying that the H2 production originated from the water reduction by the electrons transferring from the visible light-excited sensitizer to the photocatalyst conduction band, not from the electrons generated in the photocatalyst by direct light absorption. This is because the photocatalyst did not intrinsically absorb the visible light (as experimentally observed by the UV–visible spectrum), resulting in no possibility of photogenerated hole production in the photocatalyst itself [36,51]. When considering the DEA electron donor, 15 vol% DEA was found to be the optimum concentration for the efficient H2 production. When further increasing DEA concentration beyond the optimum level, the H2 production rate did not increase, but gradually decreased instead. This is possibly because the DEA concentration of 15 vol% was highly sufficient for effectively regenerating the oxidized sensitizer and also for preventing the recombination between electron and oxidized sensitizer. Therefore, excess DEA in this investigated system was not required. Since 15 vol% DEA was experimentally found to be the most suitable electron donor concentration, it was used for further experiments. 3.2.3 Effect of sensitizer concentration The concentration of E.Y. sensitizer plays a significant role in the number of electrons transferring from the excited E.Y. to the conduction band of the perovskite titanate photocatalyst to induce the photocatalytic H2 production. Fig. 12 shows the effect of dissolved E.Y. concentration (varied from 0 mM to 1 mM) on the photocatalytic H2 hydrogen rate over the 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst suspended in the 15 vol.% DEA aqueous solution containing dissolved E.Y. The results show that no H2 production was observed in the absence of E.Y. (i.e. E.Y. concentration of 0 mM), implying its important role in the sensitizing step under visible light irradiation. The H2 production rate significantly increased with increasing E.Y. concentration and reached a maximum at 0.5 mM (with H2 production rate of about 1.01 cm3/h). However, with further increasing E.Y. concentration beyond 0.5 mM, the H2 production rate adversely decreased. To explain this phenomenon, only fraction of the E.Y. sensitizer adsorbed on the SrTiO3 photocatalyst surface must be firstly considered to be photocatalytically active and responsible for the electron injection to the conduction band of the SrTiO3 photocatalyst [36]. Initially, with the increase in the E.Y. concentration, such fraction increases; thus, the H2 production rate significantly increases. If the photocatalytically active sites are entirely adsorbed by the E.Y., there is no further increase in the H2 production rate with further increasing E.Y. concentration, possibly due to a saturation limit of the E.Y. adsorption sites on the photocatalyst surface. In addition, the excess E.Y. dissolved in the reaction solution could be excited, but could not inject the electrons to the photocatalyst conduction band for inducing the photocatalytic reaction. This also led to less light absorption of the E.Y. adsorbed on the photocatalyst surface, resulting in diminishing the photocatalytic H2 production activity at too high E.Y. concentrations. 3.2.4 Effect of photocatalyst dosage Fig. 13 shows the effect of photocatalyst dosage on the H2 production rate over the 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst suspended in the 15 vol% DEA aqueous solution containing 0.5 mM E.Y. The results show that in the absence of photocatalyst (i.e. photocatalyst dosage of 0 g/l), the H2 production could be detected in only very small amount, possibly from the direct reduction of water molecule by the electron from the excited E.Y.; however, this indicates that the photocatalyst is needed to function as electron transfer-mediating pathway for the efficient H2 production. It was also observed that the photocatalyst dosage of 6 g/l provided the maximum H2 production rate of about 1.35 cm3/h. Even if either below or above this photocatalyst dosage was used, a decrease in the H2 production rate was clearly observed. Generally, a higher dosage of the photocatalyst is expected to correspond to a greater possibility of the electron transfer from the excited E.Y. to the photocatalyst conduction band under visible light irradiation, leading to a higher photocatalytic H2 production activity. However, the photocatalytic activity declined when the photocatalyst dosage exceeded the optimum value, indicating that the added amount of the photocatalyst needed to be optimized. The results can be explained in the terms of the active sites availability on the photocatalyst surface and the irradiating light penetration into the aqueous reaction suspension [52]. As the photocatalyst dosage increases, the active sites availability on the photocatalyst surface increases, but the light penetration and the subsequent photoexcited volume of the reaction suspension adversely decrease. Besides, the irradiating light cannot penetrate throughout the photocatalytic reactor due to the shielding effect caused by a large quantity of the photocatalyst in the reaction suspension. Although the possibility of electron transfer from the excited E.Y. present in the outermost region of the reactor increases, the H2 production performance from the innermost region drastically decreases due to the inadequate photoexcitation. Moreover, the deactivation of the active photocatalyst molecules due to the agglomeration and sedimentation of the photocatalyst particles at too high dosages has also been reported as a possible reason for the decrease in the photocatalytic activity [52]. Hence, the optimum amount of the added photocatalyst is required for the investigated photocatalytic system in order to prevent unnecessary excess photocatalyst particles and also to assure total absorption of the irradiating light for the efficient photocatalytic H2 production. 3.2.5 Effect of initial solution pH Another important parameter that greatly affects the photosensitized H2 production is the initial solution pH of an aqueous reaction suspension. The role of initial solution pH on the photocatalytic H2 production was therefore studied in the pH range of 8.4–12.6 using DEA as the electron donor. It must be first noted that the initial pH of the original 15 vol% DEA aqueous solution was approximately 11.6, and insignificant changes in the solution pH were observed after the courses of the photocatalytic reaction in this present work. Fig. 14 shows the effect of initial solution pH on the H2 production rate. The results reveal that the H2 production rate increased with increasing initial solution pH from 8.4 to 11.6, and a further increase in the initial solution pH greater than 11.6 caused a decrease in the H2 production rate. The results indicate that the H2 production of the investigated photocatalytic system was more favorable at nearly strong basic condition, and the optimum initial solution pH was found to be approximately 11.6 (the original initial pH). A possible explanation is that the initial pH of the reaction solution has a strong impact on the reducing capability of the lone-pair electrons at N atom of the DEA electron donor, resulting in altering its electron-donating efficiency. It has also been found by Malinka and Kamalov [53] that the photocatalytic H2 production activity increased as the initial solution pH increased, particularly at pH values greater than 6. This is possibly because the studied amine, i.e. DEA, is more rapidly oxidized—in the other words, it can donate electrons more rapidly—in an alkaline condition because the reducing capability of the DEA is lower in a more acidic condition due to the fact that it is more protonated [54]. As a result, the regeneration rate of the oxidized sensitizer could be enhanced in a more alkaline condition. Thus, the undesired backward reaction of the oxidized sensitizer with electron would be retarded, and the electron-transferring efficiency of the excited sensitizer would be increased, leading to an enhanced H2 production rate. However, when the initial solution pH was increased above the optimum value to become too alkaline, the complicated coulombic repulsions/interactions among various species present in the photocatalytic system, e.g. OH−, DEA, sensitizer, and photocatalyst surface, might exert a negative role in reducing the overall photocatalytic H2 production activity. Further detailed investigation is required to obtain a better understanding about these phenomena caused by the varying initial solution pH."
9,Conclusions,"In this work, the photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation from an aqueous DEA or TEA solution containing dissolved E.Y. sensitizer over various types of the synthesized perovskite photocatalysts (i.e. the synthesized mesoporous-assembled MgTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3 photocatalysts, and the synthesized 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst), as well as the commercial SrTiO3 and P-25 TiO2 photocatalysts, was comparatively investigated. A sol-gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant was employed to synthesize all of the mesoporous-assembled perovskite photocatalysts, whereas the Pt loading on the mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst was achieved by a single-step sol-gel method. The experimental results revealed that among the investigated photocatalysts, the synthesized mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 was the most suitable photocatalyst, particularly when its surface was loaded with the Pt cocatalyst nanoparticles. It was found that the synthesized 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded mesoporous-assembled SrTiO3 photocatalyst calcined at 650 °C provided the highest photocatalytic H2 production performance from the 15 vol% DEA aqueous solution containing dissolved 0.5 mM E.Y. under the optimum operating conditions of a photocatalyst dosage of 6 g/l and an initial solution pH of 11.6."
