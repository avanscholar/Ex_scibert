0,Introduction,"In recent years, development of clean energy and reuse of renewable resources have drawn great attention due to increasing global concerns on energy shortage and environment deterioration (Lloyd and Subbarao, 2009; Canterino et al., 2009). Hydrogen has been identified as one of the major clean energy sources of the future due to its high energy content (122 kJ g−1) and reduced greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil fuels. Ever since the electrochemical photolysis of water on a TiO2 electrode was first discovered by Fujishima and Honda, great progress has been achieved in understanding the microscopic process involved in the photocatalytic systems, and in the modulation of photocatalyst structures for visible light harvesting (Fujishima and Honda, 1972; Walter et al., 2010; Chen and Mao, 2007). Photocatalytic reaction is initiated by excitation of a semiconductor photocatalyst, which results in the promotion of an electron (e−) from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor and creation of a hole (h+) in the VB. The photogenerated electrons and holes that migrate to the surface of the semiconductor without recombination can, respectively, reduce and oxidize the reactants adsorbed by the semiconductor (Chen and Mao, 2007). For the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production, the CB electrons are important as their role is to reduce protons to hydrogen molecules. The CB level should be more negative than the hydrogen evolution level to initiate hydrogen production (Ni et al., 2007). Among the semiconductor materials which fulfill the requirement, TiO2 has attracted the most attention because of its chemical and photochemical stability, biological inertness, and low cost (Chong et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012a; Gupta et al., 2007). For high-rate hydrogen production in a photocatalytic system, an excess amount of electron donors (e.g. organic acids, alcohols, sulfide/sulfite) is normally required to speed up h+ consumption and slow down e−–h+ recombination, which can dramatically enhance hydrogen evolution by several orders of magnitude (Ni et al., 2007; Kim and Choi, 2010). Recently, a series of studies have been achieved in using organic pollution instead as electron donors for H2 production, such as phenolic compounds, dyes, organic acids, urea/urine and so on (Ni et al., 2007; Kim and Choi, 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Daskalaki et al., 2010). Nevertheless, simultaneous hydrogen production and organic pollution removal during wastewater treatment still faces many challenges for practical application, such as (1) the photocatalytic hydrogen production requires anoxic condition which was usually achieved by purging inert gases (e.g. Ar and N2) in photocatalytic reactors prior to irradiation (Kim and Choi, 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Daskalaki et al., 2010). Such an approach is uneconomical in wastewater treatment; and (2) the organic pollutants in wastewater usually cannot be directly utilized as electron donors in photocatalytic hydrogen production process (Pirkanniemi and Sillanpää, 2002). It is hardly to achieve simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater purification only though photocatalysis. Wastewater reclamation from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) has been considered as one of the most important approach for resources reuse (Zhang et al., 2010). It has been extensively employed for various purposes around the world (Zhang et al., 2010). However, reusable wastewater should be free of any toxic pollutants which escape from conventional wastewater treatment. Unfortunately, in most countries, including China, the only standard for determining organic pollution in reclaimed wastewater is the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Micropollutants are ignored, potentially threatening water utility customers during wastewater reuse. Today, what are known as “emerging contaminants” (ECs), found in treated wastewater, are causing particular concern, due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and humans health (Joss et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007; Klamerth et al., 2010). One of the best known detrimental effects of these compounds in environment is the disruption of endocrine systems in wild species, affecting their growth, physiology and reproduction (Seeland et al., 2012). The effects could be measured as a result of estrogenic activity (EA), as has been used in many studies (Wu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012b). Therefore, effective advanced treatments are required to remove these pollutants and ensure the quality of the reused water. Among the advanced treatments capable of degrading ECs, TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation has been one of the most promising technologies (Coleman et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2012b; Gupta and Ali, 2008). Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant largely depends on the oxidative power of VB holes and hydroxyl radicals (Zhang et al., 2012a). In this case, the generated CB electrons are usually scavenged by oxygen molecules. It has been reported in our previous studies that TiO2 photocatalytic treatment of secondary effluent would preferentially degrade large molecular weight (MW) effluent organic compounds (e.g. humic/fulvic acid-like compounds and soluble microbial byproduct-like compounds) into small MW organic compounds, and then mineralize them into CO2 and H2O (Zhang et al., 2012c). The process was accompanied with the removal of emerging contaminants from secondary effluent, especially for the estrogenic chemicals (Zhang et al., 2012c). The generated small MW organic compounds, such as organic acids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds, seem easier to be used as electron donors than their parent compounds. They are self-sustaining energy of wastewater. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation of large MW organic compounds into small MW organic compounds was a dissolved oxygen (DO) consuming process. If the small MW organic compounds generated from aerobic photocatalytic oxidation could be used as electron donors in the following anoxic photocatalytic hydrogen production process, it could be possible to achieve simultaneous advanced wastewater treatment and energy recovery. In order to verify this hypothesis, a dissolved oxygen-controlled solar photocatalytic reactor was developed for simultaneously EA removal and hydrogen production. Surface phosphate and platinized TiO2 (P–TiO2/Pt) microspheres were prepared as photocatalysts because the hybrid modified TiO2 powders (P25) were proven to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities for simultaneous degradation of organic compounds and hydrogen production, wide working pH range (from 3 to 11), and good stability by Choi and co-workers (Kim and Choi, 2010, 2011; Kim et al., 2012). In order to better understand the photocatalytic process, changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effluent organic matter (EfOM) were evaluated. This new idea may offer a promising idea to realize simultaneous water resource reclamation and clean energy production from natural energy."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents Titanium dioxide powder P25 (greater than 99.5% purity, average primary particle size of 21 nm, BET surface area of 50 ± 15 m2/g) used in this study was purchased from Degussa (Germany). Methanol, alcohol, nonanoic, tetra-n-butyl titanate, chloroplatinic acid, 1,5-diphenylcarbohydrazide (DPCI), Benzoquinone (BQ), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All reagents used for chromatographic analyses were of HPLC grade. Analytical standards for chromatography analyses were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water from a Milli-Q purification unit was used in the following experiments."
3,Photocatalysts preparation and characterization,"2.2 Photocatalysts preparation and characterization TiO2 microspheres were prepared by using a sol-gel method. 0.5 mL of nonanoic acid was dropped into 60 mL of absolute alcohol and 0.1 mL of KCl (0.1 mol/L) aqueous solution was added. After stirring for 20 min, 1 mL of tetra-n-butyl titanate was added under violently stirring for 5 min. Then 2 mL of double distilled water and 3 mL ethanol were added dropwise into the mixture under dark condition. A white precursor microspheres suspension was obtained and kept static for 24 h. Then the precursor microspheres were collected by centrifugation and dispersed in an ethanol-aqueous solution. The suspension was sealed within a Teflon-lined autoclave (50 mL) and heated at 160 °C for 16 h. The heated products were collected and washed with ethanol for three times. Afterwards, the precipitate was dried at 40 °C and further calcined at 500 °C for 2.5 h. P–TiO2/Pt microspheres were obtained using chemical surface deposition methods. Pt deposition on the surface of TiO2 microspheres was done using a photodeposition method. A certain amount of TiO2 microspheres were dispersed in aqueous solution containing 15 μmol of chloroplatinic acid and 1 mol of methanol. After 30 min of irradiation (300 W mercury lamp), the precipitate (Pt/TiO2 microspheres) was collected by filtration and washed with distilled water. The Pt loading was estimated to be 0.8 wt% by measuring the remaining chloroplatinic acid after the photodeposition. For the phosphation, 2 g of Pt/TiO2 microspheres were firstly added in the 200 mL of aqueous phosphoric acid solution (30 mmol). After 5 h of stir, the precipitate was collected by filtration. Then it was dried at 100 °C for 1.5 h and heated at 300 °C for 1 h. Finally, the heated product was washed with distilled water for five times to obtain the targeted P–TiO2/Pt photocatalyst. The morphological characters of the photocatalysts were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Model S-4800) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Hongkong Co. Ltd., Tecnai G2). Elemental analyses of photocatalysts were carried out using a JEOLJEM-2100F microscope with Cs-correction at the operating voltage of 200 kV. The crystal phases were determined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; M21X, MAC Science Ltd., Japan) with Cu–Kα radiation. The elemental compositions of photocatalysts were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Perkin-Elmer RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6eV)."
4,Photocatalytic experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic experiments The secondary effluents used in this study were taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Suzhou, China), in which the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process was used as a secondary treatment. All samples were stored in acid-washed amber bottles, and stored in ice for transport to the laboratory, where they were immediately processed for later extraction and analysis. The effluent characteristics are summarized in Table S1. Experiments were conducted using a laboratory scale unit (as shown in Fig. 1 ) consisting of a pre-aeration tank (8 L) and a cylindrical Pyrex photocatalytic reactor (5.65 L). The pre-aeration tank was firstly filled with the secondary effluent. The photocatalysts were added into the 8 L wastewater sample to give a loading of 0.5 g/L. Then the suspension was sealed by using a silicon cap and stirred continuously. DO concentration of the suspension was adjusted by purging external argon and/or oxygen. The initial DO concentration was 6.4 mg/L. A peristaltic pump was used to transfer the suspension to the Pyrex photocatalytic reactor. The Pyrex reactor was sealed and had connections for gas outlet and wastewater sampling. It was subsequently occupied fully by the pumped suspension. The suspension in the photocatalytic reactor was stirred vigorously during the experiments. The total reaction time was 300 min. Photoirradiation was carried out with a solar light-simulating source (Osram XBO 450 W). The rate of photon absorption in the reactor, measured by chemical actinometry, was 4.2 × 10−7 einstein/s (Sun and Bolton, 1996). The initial estrogenic activity of secondary effluent was 52.4 ng-E2 equivalents/L. The solution was sampled for analysis from the reactor cell using a glass syringe at specified time intervals during photocatalytic process. The sampling volume is 500 mL. After each sampling, the same amount of treated wastewater sample from a parallel running photocatalytic reactor was injected in the sealed photocatalytic reactor."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods The amount of total gas produced was determined by water displacement method using sulfuric acid (2%) and NaCl (10%) containing solution. The amount of collected hydrogen was measured by using a gas chromatograph (HP Agilent 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5A column. To determine the EA in secondary effluents, solid phase extraction method was applied to concentrate the compounds from the wastewater sample using Oasis HLB resin cartridges (Waters Corporation, America) previously washed with 10 mL of ethyl acetate, 10 mL methanol, and 15 mL ultrapure water. The estrogenic activity of the concentrated samples was evaluated with a two-hybrid assay based on yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190) containing the rat estrogen receptor ERα and the coactivator TIF2. In this assay, β-galactosidase induced by estrogenic chemicals was used to monitor estrogenic activity. Detailed procedures of estrogenic activity assay can be found in our previous work (Zhang et al., 2012c). Changes of EfOM properties during P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process were examined by using methods of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), and 3-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The molecular weight (MW) distributions and fluorescence spectra of wastewater samples were determined using HPSEC and fluorescence EEM spectroscopy as described in our previous publication (Zhang et al., 2012c). EEM peaks have been associated with humic/fulvic-like, protein-like and soluble microbial by-product-like (SMP-like) organic compounds (Chen et al., 2003). In general, peaks at longer excitation wavelengths (>280 nm) and longer emission wavelengths (>380 nm) are related to humic-like organics (Region V). Peaks at intermediate excitation wavelengths (260–300 nm) and shorter emission wavelength (<380 nm) are related to SMP-like material (Region IV). Peaks at shorter excitation wavelengths (<260 nm) and shorter emission wavelengths (<380 nm) are related to simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine and tryptophan (Regions I and II). In addition, peaks at shorter excitation wavelengths (<260 nm) and longer emission wavelengths (>360 nm) are related to fulvic acid-like materials (Region III) (Chen et al., 2003). Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration was analyzed by Aurora 1030W OI Analytical TOC analyzer (OI Analytical, USA). The absorbance at 254 nm was determined using a Cary 300 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., USA) and a 1 cm quartz cell. The behavior of DO during the photocatalytic process was monitored with electrode for DO sensor (UC-12-SOL, Central Kagaku Co.), which was connected to a computer. The ROS generation in the irradiated suspensions of photocatalysts was monitored by measuring the diphenylcarbonzone (DPCO) resulted from the reactions between ROS and DPCI (Guo et al., 2011). Experiments were carried out according to the procedures of the above-mentioned photocatalytic experiments, in which the secondary effluent samples were replaced by DPCI solutions (1 mmol/L). The DPCO could be extracted by mixed solution of benzene and carbon tetrachloride (volume ratio 1:1) and showed great absorbance at 563 nm wavelength. The quantities and kinds of generated ROS could be evaluated by the quantities of oxidized DPCI and the adding of different quencher (5 mmol/L). BQ and DMSO were used to quench O 2 − and OH, respectively (Guo et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2009). The UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 50, Varian Company, USA) was used to estimate the concentration of DPCO. Aldehydes in the photocatalytic treated secondary effluent were determined using a GC-2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD). The carrier gas was helium operated in constant flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The make-up gas was 5% methane in argon with the flow rate of 27 mL/min. Separations were performed on Rxi-1ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 1.0 μm film thickness). The operating conditions were as following: injector temperature 180 °C; temperature program: 50 °C for 1 min, rising at 4 °C/min to 220 °C and then at 20 °C/min to 250 °C; detector temperature 300 °C. The injection volume was 1 μL. Carboxylic acids in the photocatalytic treated secondary effluent were determined using ICS-3000 ion chromatograph. Carboxylic acids were separated on an IonPac AS 18 column (250 mm × 2 mm ID) with an IonPac AG18 guard column (50 mm × 2 mm ID) using NaOH eluent solution at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The injection volume was 20 μL."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of as-prepared P–TiO2/Pt,"3.1 Characterization of as-prepared P–TiO2/Pt The size and shape of the TiO2 microspheres and P–TiO2/Pt microspheres were examined by FESEM and TEM. It can be seen that both the photocatalyst samples consist of spherical particles with sizes ranging from 500 to 1000 nm (Fig. 2 A and B). The high magnification FESEM image of the TiO2 microspheres (Fig. 2A) shows a highly rough surface with mesoporous structure and indicates that the microspheres are formed by large quantities of small nanoparticles. Pt elemental spots are well scattered over the whole of TiO2 microspheres, whereas Pt elements may exist mainly as nanoparticles with sizes of few nanometers (<10 nm) (Fig. 2B). The elemental distributions of O, P, and Ti within the P–TiO2/Pt microspheres were obtained by FESEM and EDX analysis (Fig. 2C, D, E and F). These results clearly show that both P and Pt species coexist on the surface of TiO2 microspheres. XPS scan spectra over a large energy range was used to identify the elements present in the P–TiO2/Pt microspheres (as shown in Fig. 3 ). The P 2p binding energy was 132.2 eV, which is characteristic of phosphorus in the phosphate ion (Kőrösia et al., 2007). The Pt 4f binding energies were 71.4 eV and 72.6 eV, representing the Pt0 deposited TiO2 microspheres (Kim and Choi, 2011). The results of XPS analysis are in agreement with the observations HRTEM and EDX images. Both XRD spectra of the TiO2 microspheres and P–TiO2/Pt microspheres exhibit clear characteristic diffraction peaks at 25.28°, 37.80°, 48.05°, 55.06°, 62.68°, 68.76°, and 75.03°, which are assigned to the anatase phase and clear characteristic diffraction peaks at 36.09°, 54.32°, and 56.64° which are assigned to the rutile phase (Fig. S1). Moreover, the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalysts show no characteristic diffraction peaks for the Pt dopant because their concentration in the catalysts is lower than that afforded by XRD detection limits."
8,Simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production,"3.2 Simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production Results of simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent through photolysis (simulated solar) and photocatalysis using TiO2 powder (P25), TiO2 microspheres, and P–TiO2/Pt microspheres are shown in Fig. 4 . The estrogenic activity was almost totally removed in 200 min using P–TiO2/Pt microspheres as photocatalysts. Comparatively, only 10%, 58.2% and 49.5% reduction occurred within 200 min through photolysis and photocatalysis using the TiO2 microspheres and TiO2 powder. With P–TiO2/Pt microspheres, the removal of estrogenic activity was accompanied by the marked production of hydrogen, whereas the production of hydrogen was negligible during photolysis and photocatalysis with the other two photocatalysts. The photonic efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production using P–TiO2/Pt microspheres from secondary effluent was 3.38 × 10−3. Compared with those previously reported, which focused on the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from synthetic water spiked with electron donors (e.g. bisphenol A and urea), it is interesting to note that the photocatalytic hydrogen production was marked enhanced in presence of secondary effluent (as shown in Table S2). The result indicates that it is possible to achieve simultaneous EA removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent without additional DO adjustment procedure through solar photocatalysis. The remarkable photocatalytic oxidation and reduction activities of P–TiO2/Pt microspheres were due to the synergic effect of double surface modifications. The Pt deposited on TiO2 retards the electron–hole recombination by serving as electron sink. As for the surface phosphation, phosphates are complexed on the surface of TiO2 by displacing the surface OH groups which are hole-trapping sites. Under this situation, the holes react with mobile scavengers and are carried away as the desorbing hydroxyl radical (Kim et al., 2012; Kim and Choi, 2011). The surface phosphation of TiO2 also retards the electron–hole recombination. Therefore, the holes and electrons are effectively separated to oxidize and reduce the targeted substrates, resulting in outstanding photocatalytic oxidation and reduction activities. The decay of DO in the sealed reactor during P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process is also shown in Fig. 4. The DO was completely consumed in 100 min and it decay process obeyed zero-order reaction kinetics (i.e. the decay rate was constant). It was found that the rate of photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity was decreasing with DO consuming, and protons started to be reduced to hydrogen when DO was almost completed consumed (DO < 0.16 mg/L). This demonstrates that the photocatalytic process on P–TiO2/Pt can be carried out in two steps: (1) the DO consuming phase with estrogenic activity removal (i.e. aerobic phase) and (2) the DO consumed phase with hydrogen production and estrogenic activity removal (i.e. anoxic phase). Such a photocatalytic wastewater treatment process may be similar compared with the biologic wastewater treatment that consists of sequential anaerobic acidification and methane production. The dependences of rates of estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production on initial DO concentrations of secondary effluents during P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process are shown in Fig. 5 . The estrogenic activity removal rate was increasing with initial DO concentration increasing, whereas the hydrogen production rate was decreasing during the same process. It also could be found that photocatalytic hydrogen production was invalided when the initial DO concentration was adjusted to 35.5 mg/L by oxygen aeration. It may be due to the fact that the DO in the sealed photocatalytic reactor cannot be consumed in 5 h. The remained oxygen would trap and remove the generated electrons from TiO2 surface, resulting in the failure of protons reduction. It was also interesting to note that the rate of estrogenic activity removal with 8 mg/L of initial DO concentration was approximately equal to that with 35.5 mg/L. Since oxygen reacts slowly with the electrons compared with the reaction between holes and hydroxyl or water species, the rate of electron transfer from TiO2 to oxygen is usually considered as the rate-controlling process during photocatalysis (Almquist and Biswas, 2001; Lin et al., 2011). When the oxygen is in excess of the photo-generated electrons, the rate of electron transfer to molecular oxygen will be maximized and the photocatalytic rate will only be affected by characteristics of photocatalysts. In this study, it could be deduced that 8 mg/L of DO may be enough for trapping the generated electrons."
9,Evaluation of ROS during the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process,"3.3 Evaluation of ROS during the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process The changes of generated ROS during the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic processes in the sealed reactor were compared by monitoring the time profiles of DPCO generation (as shown in Fig. 6 ). It could be found that ROS were continuously produced during the whole photocatalytic process and the rate of ROS production under aerobic condition is higher than that under anoxic condition. The kind of generated ROS was determined by adding different quencher (e.g. BQ and DMSO). The decreased absorbance of DPCO after the adding of some kind of scavenger was corresponding to quantities of the ROS in the system. By comparing the kinds and quantities of generated ROS in aerobic phase (0–100 min) and anoxic phase (100–300 min), it could be found that O 2 − and OH were the dominant ROS in the aerobic phase, accounting for about 25% and 53% of total ROS, respectively. In contrast, OH was found to be the most abundant ROS (more than 80%) in the anoxic phase. In order to ascertain the generated ROS in the process of photocatalytic removal of estrogenic activity from secondary effluent in the sealed reactor, a series of experiments were conducted by adding some sacrificial agents, such as BQ (5 mmol/L) and DMSO (5 mmol/L) to the photocatalytic system. The results showed that when OH scavengers (i.e. DMSO) was put into the photocatalytic reactor, the removal rate of estrogenic activity was depressed by 50% in the aerobic phase and almost 100% in the anoxic phase (Fig. S2). When O 2 − scavenger (i.e. BQ) was introduced, the removal rate of estrogenic activity was depressed by 24% in the aerobic phase and only 3% in the anoxic phase (Fig. S2). These results indicated that O 2 − and OH were the major ROS in the aerobic phase and OH was almost the only generated oxidation species in the anoxic phase, consistent with the results obtained above. The changes ROS during the photocatalytic process could be explained by the mechanism of P–TiO2/Pt photocatalysis. P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic reactions start with the generation of electron–hole pairs. Under aerobic condition, these electrons and holes would react with the molecular dissolved oxygen and water molecules, respectively, and produce the O 2 − and OH with strong oxidation ability. O 2 − is unstable in aqueous solution and is easily decomposed into OH (Guo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, OH and O 2 − are the dominant ROS in the aerobic phase. With the consuming of DO, the concentration of O 2 − is decreasing and the remaining photogenerated electrons are trapped by the deposited Pt. Under anoxic condition, the holes could still react with scavengers (i.e. hydroxyl and water species) and produce OH, while the trapped electrons in Pt would preferentially react with protons/water for the production of hydrogen (Kim et al., 2012; Kim and Choi, 2011). Therefore, OH is found to be the most abundant ROS in the anoxic phase."
10,Evaluation of EfOM during the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process,"3.4 Evaluation of EfOM during the P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process 3.4.1 DOC, UV254, and SUVA analysis Results of DOC, UV254, and SUVA reduction during P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process are shown in Fig. 7 . The reduction percentages of DOC and UV254 increased sharply in the initial 100 min and then tended to be gently in the following 200 min. It indicated that initially the majority of the EfOM molecules were highly UV absorbing aromatic compounds, which could easily be degraded by the photocatalytic oxidation process. The photocatalytic process transformed the aromatic molecules into organics that were slower to degrade or increasingly resistant to photocatalytic oxidation. At the end of 300 min irradiation, approximately 50% of the original DOC remained, indicating incomplete mineralization. Since the residual DOC had minimal absorbance at 254 nm, it could be inferred that most of the aromatic compounds were removed and aliphatic compounds remained after photocatalytic oxidation. SUVA is defined as the UV absorbance of a given sample at 254 nm divided by the DOC concentration of the sample. The ratio describes the nature of organic matter in wastewater in terms of aromatic, hydrophobic, and MW distribution (Tanju et al., 2002; Howe and Clark, 2002). The reduction of SUVA value for the photocatalytic treated secondary effluent indicated that the aromatic, hydrophobic, and high MW fractions of EfOM were transformed into non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW fractions. 3.4.2 HPSEC analysis The apparent molecular weight (AWM) distributions of wastewater sample before and after P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic oxidation are shown in Fig. 8 . The wavelengths of 210 nm and 254 nm were selected because the absorbance at 210 nm is associated with both carboxylic and carbonylic chromophores, while absorbance at 254 nm is primarily determined by aromatic groups (Korshin et al., 2009). HPSEC profile of secondary effluent measured using absorbance at 254 nm has five major peaks (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) at approximately 30634, 4083, 3544, 1364, and 565 Da, respectively, and a shoulder at 3078 Da (Fig. 8A). Photocatalytic oxidation shifted the AMW distribution of EfOM towards smaller values. Larger molecules of EfOM were photocatalytic degraded preferentially into smaller constituents, especially for the very high AMW portion (AMW > 30 kDa). Afterwards, smaller molecules were removed, resulting in the decrease of UV254 absorbance. The remained EfOM after prolonged illumination implied that a fraction of EfOM (or its photodegraded by-products) was recalcitrant to photocatalytic treatment (Liu et al., 2010). Fig. 8B presents AMW distributions using 210 nm detection of secondary effluent before and after photocatalytic treatment. In these profiles, the intensity of the absorbance associated with the EfOM fraction at 1066 Da decreased rapidly in the initial 100 min, while that having lower molecular weight at 627 Da increased. With increasing of irradiation time, the EfOM fraction at 627 Da was generally shifted to the lower AMW fraction at 526 Da. These results are consistent with the fact that low AMW compounds are photocatalytic generated from cleavage of aromatic ring as ROS reactions with large aromatic structures, such as radical addition or H atom abstraction (Huang et al., 1993; Legrini et al., 1993). The generated low AMW compounds have been identified as molecules enriched with carbonyl and carboxylic functionalities, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetate, and formate, which could exactly serve as precursors for hydrogen (Ni et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012). With the increasing of hydrogen production during anoxic P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process, the low AMW compounds were decreased and finally mineralized in to CO2 and H2O. 3.4.3 Fluorescence analysis The contour maps of EEM of secondary effluent before and after photocatalytic treatment are shown in Fig. S4. The peaks for Exmax/Emmax and their intensities are shown in Table S3. As described from above, the conclusion might be drawn that the EEM spectrum of the secondary effluent sample was dominated by fulvic-like and SMP-like fluorescence, while that of the aromatic proteins and humic-like peaks were more like shoulders (Fig. S4a). As shown in Fig. S4b and c, EEM results revealed that the intensities of all EfOM from secondary effluent were decreased with the increasing irradiation time. The aromatic, fulvic-like, and humic-like compounds in Region II, III and V were preferentially degraded during the photocatalytic process. This result indicates the decomposition of the condensed aromatic structures, and the increment of electron withdrawing groups such as COOH in aromatic compounds. The further intensity reduction of EfOM could be attributed to radical oxidation in the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the photocatalytic process shifted the maximum Ex/Em wavelength of EfOM towards a shorter wavelength. According to previous studies (Coble, 1996; Swietlik and Sikorska, 2004), the blue-shift, i.e. Ex/Em shift towards a shorter wavelength, indicates the decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties to smaller molecules and a reduction in the π-electron system, such as a decrease in the number of aromatic rings or conjugated structures in a chain structure, or the conversion of a linear ring system to a non-linear ring system. 3.4.4 Relationships between EfOM removal and hydrogen production, and EA removal In the DO consuming phase, the aromatic, hydrophobic, and high AMW fractions of EfOM, such as fulvic-like and humic-like compounds, were preferentially photocatalytic decomposed, contributing 41% of DOC reduction and 93.2% of EA removal (as shown in Fig. S3). The 93.2% removal of EA was due to the fact that the phenol moieties in estrogenic chemicals, which play key roles in potent EA, were preferentially decomposed in this phase (Zhao et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004). In the DO consumed phase, the mineralization of EfOM was insignificant and only 9% of DOC was reduced. Most of generated non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW compounds, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetate, and formate, served as precursors for hydrogen. Therefore, the production of hydrogen continued for up to 300 min without showing any sign of deceleration. The removal of estrogenic activity was accompanied by the marked production of hydrogen and even some estrogenic chemicals themselves could serve as hydrogen precursors, such as bisphenol A (Kim and Choi, 2010)."
11,Conclusions,"The results of the present work indicate that it is possible to achieve simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent through solar photocatalysis. This is made possible in a dissolved oxygen-controlled solar photocatalytic reactor using P–TiO2/Pt microspheres as photocatalysts. The P–TiO2/Pt photocatalysts can be easily prepared by surface platinization and phosphation on TiO2 microspheres by using phosphoric acid as phosphate source and chloroplatinic acid as platinum source. P–TiO2/Pt showed a significantly higher activity than bare TiO2 microsphere and TiO2 powder (P25) for simultaneous estrogenic activity removal and hydrogen production from secondary effluent. The hydrogen production rate was increasing with decreased DO concentration in secondary effluent. The P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process was carried out in two steps (i.e. aerobic phase and anoxic phase). O 2 − and OH were the dominant ROS in the aerobic phase, while OH was the most abundant ROS in the anoxic phase. Moreover, the results of multiple analyses (e.g. SUVA, HPSEC, and EEM fluorescence) of EfOM changes during P–TiO2/Pt photocatalytic process indicated that the aromatic, hydrophobic, and high MW fractions of EfOM (e.g. aromatic proteins and fulvic-/humic-like compounds) were preferentially transformed into non-humic, hydrophilic, and low MW fractions (e.g. aldehydes and carboxylic acids). Then these compounds were continuously utilized as electron donors in the following anoxic photocatalytic hydrogen production process. The study offers a promising idea to realize simultaneous water resource reclamation and clean energy production from natural energy. Further studies should attempt to evaluate the effect of wastewater composition (e.g. inorganic ions, EfOM fractions and suspended solids) on the photocatalytic process."
