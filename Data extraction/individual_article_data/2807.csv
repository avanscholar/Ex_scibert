0,Introduction,"Clean water is vital to human survival and social development, due to population growth, industrialization, and climate change, the global demand for clean water has increased sharply [1–3]. However, in the coming decades, the earth's capacity to supply humans with clean water will be limited. In order to obtain more clean water resources to meet human demands [4], technologies such as thermal distillation, reverse osmosis, and membrane filtration have been developed, but solutions that require too much energy or sacrifice the environment are not feasible [5]. Solar energy, as a clean, resource-rich renewable energy, can meet many global energy needs [6,7]. Traditional solar steam production technology directly uses solar energy to heat water, but water's poor solar absorption capacity and heat loss lead to low photothermal conversion efficiency and limit its practical applications [8]. Therefore, ways of making full use of the sun’s energy are needed. Based on the emergence and development of a direct solar steam generation system (DSSG) [4], especially the development of solar-thermal conversion materials(STCM) and the concept of interfacial evaporation [5,8], the efficiency of system evaporation has been greatly improved. Generally, high-performance solar steam generators generally require the following characteristics [9–11]: (1) excellent light absorption capacity [7]; (2) continuous and stable water supply capacity [12]; (3) good thermal management capacity [13]; (4) a porous network of steam channels [14]. Up to now, significant progress has been achieved in these areas. For instance, Yang et al. reported that the bilayer SWNT/AuNR Janus film has a solar absorption efficiency of 98.0% in the spectrum of 300–2500 nm [15]. By sequential polymerization of multilayer polypyrrole nanocrystals on paper substrates, Wang et al. formed a surface structure in the shape of folds and ridges, which significantly enhanced the absorption efficiency of sunlight. Thus reaching a solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 95.33% [16]. Guo et al. prepared sponge-like hydrogels using in-situ gels of titanium oxide and polyvinyl alcohol. The vaporized water in the polymeric network can be rapidly replenished by a three-dimensional interconnected porous structure, which can achieve a high evaporation rate of 3.6 kg m−2 h−1 [12]. Due to its unique 3D gradient vertical micro-channel and nitrogen doping, 3D nitrogen-doped RGO aerogel prepared by Meng et al. has a good thermal insulation effect and numerous water vapor channels, leading to a high evaporation rate of 2.53 kg m−2 h−1 [17]. Depending on some research, solar-thermal conversion materials also developed additional advantages. For instance, Kim et al. prepared a self-floating, salt-resistant flexible solar steam generator composed of graphite carbon and polyimide film by emulsification, freeze-drying and laser treatment. The energy conversion efficiency was approximately 84%, and the salt removal rate can up to 99.9% [18]. The Pt3Ni-S nanowires synthesized by Ma et al. indicated that the relative evaporation rate of strong acid solution was 0.93 kg m−2 h−1 under one solar light, and that of strong alkali solution was 1.04 kg m−2 h−1, and within the pH value range of 1.2 ~ 12, the relative evaporation rate of Pt3Ni-S film did not decrease significantly after 10 cycles, showing excellent durability [19]. As an indispensable part of the solar energy evaporation system, photothermal conversion materials have a great influence on the evaporation efficiency of the system. The existing solar thermal conversion materials can be generally divided into metal materials [20–22], semiconductor materials [23], carbon-based materials [24], and polymer materials [25]. Noteworthy, carbon-based materials such as graphene [26], carbon black [27], carbon cloth [28], and carbon nanotubes [29] have been widely used due to their broad solar absorption performance, high photothermal conversion efficiency, good stability, and low cost. The related mechanism is that under solar irradiation, the energy level transition is generated by absorbing a certain amount of solar energy, and the excited electrons relax through the electron-phonon coupling, which then causes the lattice vibration [5,30], and the energy is transferred from the excited electrons to the entire atomic lattice, thus leading to the macroscopic rise of material temperature. In recent years, an efficient and simple method to generate steam by using solar thermal conversion materials (STCM) floating in the water vapor interface has been developed [31]. By locating the heat in the upper region, the heat loss to the bulk water can be greatly reduced, and the photothermal conversion efficiency can be improved. For instance, the evaporation rate of the porous composite prepared by Wang et al. using porous carbon and polyaniline under a solar light achieved 1.496 kg·m−2·h−1, and photothermal conversion efficiency reached 87.3% [31]. Therefore, it is very promising to develop a high-efficiency self-floating solar evaporator for seawater desalination. In this study, a simple sol-gel method and freeze-drying process were utilized to prepare MWCNTs-COOH/PVA (Carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube/ polyvinyl alcohol) porous composite as an evaporator for seawater desalination and wastewater purification. In the choice of materials, owing to the optical transition of the π-band, CNT possesses excellent light absorption capacity [28]. PVA is characterized by low thermal conductivity, easy processing, good chemical resistance, and high transparency, which will contribute to heat accumulation [32]. Therefore, CNT was selected as the photothermal composite filler and PVA as the polymer matrix to form the composite material. The porous composite prepared has a porous structure, which facilitates the transport of water and provides a guarantee for the continuous evaporation of water at the interface. In addition, due to the high light absorption rate of carbon nanotubes and the low thermal conductivity of polyvinyl alcohol, sunlight can be absorbed to the maximum extent, reducing the energy loss to the environment. The combination of the two will greatly increase the utilization rate of sunlight. Considering that the accumulation of salt on the surface of the material during seawater desalination will affect the water evaporation, a layer of PDMS is applied on the upper surface of the composite, the anisotropic wetting properties of hydrophobic PDMS and hydrophilic PVA porous composite effectively prevent salt accumulation on the PDMS surface and the salt rejection rate of the seawater can reach over 99.86% [18]. Also, the porous structure of the composite will facilitate the transfer of water, decrease the reflection of sunlight, and improves the absorption capacity of sunlight [7,33]. And the unique feature of the hydrophobic upper layer/hydrophilic lower layer enables the porous composite to self-float on the water surface and rapidly pump water from the bulk to the surface [18,34]. Moreover, this structural design in which the photothermal material floating at the water-air interface can greatly reduce the heat loss to the water and improve the photothermal conversion efficiency by positioning the heat in the upper area [31]. Besides, the actual application performance of the evaporator is verified by outdoor experiments and all these characteristics lay the foundation for the preparation of the evaporator, which is a potential solar thermal conversion material."

Then, the PVA solution was stored at room temperature for future use. 10 mL of PVA aqueous solution (0.1 g mL−1) and 10 mL of dispersed MWCNTs-COOH and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate aqueous solutions of different concentrations were mixed uniformly by an ultrasonic bath (solution A). Next, 1 mL of glutaraldehyde solution was added to solution A, and two drops of hydrochloric acid were added dropwise, stirred, and poured into the template, control the temperature at 50–55 °C for 12 h to form a hydrogel. Then, the obtained gel is immersed in deionized water to remove excess crosslinking agents and impurities, and a composite hydrogel is obtained."
4,Preparation of CNT/PVA porous evaporator,"2.3 Preparation of CNT/PVA porous evaporator The composite hydrogel was pre-cooled in a refrigerator at 4 °C overnight to avoid cracks or even cracks during the freezing process, and then frozen at −18 °C for 12 h, freeze-dried in a lyophilizer (FD-1F-50, Shanghai Bilang Instrument Manufacturing Co, LTD.) at −50 °C for 36 h to acquire the 3D CNT/PVA porous evaporator. In this study, CNT/PVA (PVA concentration was maintained at 50 mg mL−1) was used as raw material to prepare a porous evaporator of 1:5, 1:2, and 1:1, and the obtained composites were denoted as CNT/PVA1, CNT/PVA2, CNT/PVA3, respectively. Then, pure PVA aerogel was also prepared in a similar way as a control."

After mixing 1 g of PDMS with 0.2 g of curing agent, 10 g of dichloromethane was added to dissolve to form solution C. Dip the lower surface of the CNT/PVA composites in solution C for a short time to make it hydrophobic, and then dry it after taking it out. The Janus CNT/PVA porous composites material with asymmetric composition/wettability were prepared and called J-CNT/PVAs (Fig. 1 )."
6,Water evaporation experiments,"2.5 Water evaporation experiments In this study, the room temperature was 29 °C, and the ambient humidity was about 64%. The water evaporation performance was measured by a solar simulator (ZQ-GHX-XE-300, AM 1.5 G). Float the evaporator (d: ~4.2 cm, h: ~5 mm) on the water surface of the beaker with a diameter of 45.0 mm, to ensure that the effective evaporation area of the evaporator was basically consistent with the area at the bottom of the beaker. The device was placed on the precision electronic balance. Once the light was on, the electronic balance can monitor the water quality change every 5 min in real-time, and use the infrared camera to monitor the surface temperature."
7,Characterization,"2.6 Characterization The reflectance and transmittance of the porous evaporator were measured using an Ultraviolet-Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600plus). And the absorption (A%) was calculated by the formula A%=1-T%-R%, in which R% and T% were the reflection and transmission. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) was utilized to capture images of the surface morphology of the samples, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi) was used to determine its chemical composition. The date physics TUB 90E goniometer was used to measure the water contact angle (CA) to estimate the wettability of the composite. Using infrared thermal imaging camera (FLIR ONE, USA) to record real-time infrared images to monitor the temperatures of the evaporator, and the mass change was monitored by an electronic analytical scale (MP 1002). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Netzsch-209F1) was used to identify the thermal stability of the porous composite. The temperature rise rate was 20 °C/min and the temperature rise range was 50–600 °C under the N2 atmosphere. The solar simulator (ZQ-GHX-XE-300) was used to simulate sunlight, and use the full-spectrum strong light power meter (TM-207) to record the light concentration. The ion concentrations were measured with a plasma emission spectrometer (ICP, Prodigy, USA). Finally, the organic contaminants were characterized by the total organic carbon analyzer (TOC, multi N/3100, Analytik Jena, Germany)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the J-CNT/PVAs,"3.1 Characterization of the J-CNT/PVAs The digital image of J-CNT/PVA is shown in Fig. S1. The optical (Fig. 2 a, d) and microscopic (Fig. 2b, c, e, f) images of PVA and MWCNTs-COOH/PVA porous composite (CNT/PVA) were obtained by camera and SEM. SEM images of PVA porous composite as showed in Fig. 2b, c, PVA exhibited an interconnected hierarchical cellular architecture and numerous pores (sizes of 60–80 μm). Through microscopic images of the CNT/PVA image (Fig. 2e, f) we can find that it has also had a porous structure, detailed observations reveal that PVA and CNT interpenetrate and join to form a composite network in the porous complex. In addition, the hydroxyl groups (O-H) of PVA can interact with hydroxyl (O-H), carbonyl (C = O), and carboxyl (–COOH) groups on the MWCNTs surface to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore the PVA chains can effectively connect the adjacent carbon nanotubes together and thus form a closely arranged layered network with fine pores [35,36]. Besides, with the driving force of ice crystals inside the porous composite, the random lap joint of CNTs will produce an ideal honeycomb structure [37]. And the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3 ) of J-CNT/PVA was used to identify the basic elemental composition. As we can see from the XPS spectra (Fig. 3a), the peaks of O1s, C1s, and S2p were detected, especially the S2p singlet with a binding energy of 168.24 eV was shown in Fig. 3d and the O1s (Fig. 3c) with the binding energy 531.94 demonstrated the existence of SDBS. Besides, we know that there are no C = O bonds in PVA, so the appearance of the C = O bonds was due to the addition of the MWCNTs-COOH (Fig. 3b). The light-absorbing capacity of the porous composite is measured by an Ultraviolet-Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600plus), As displayed in Fig. 4 a, J-CNT/PVA (weighted by AM 1.5G solar spectrum) has an average ultra-high light absorption capacity of 93.48% in the light wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. Besides, the hydrophilicity of the solar evaporator was also of great significance in the process of water evaporation as the vapor generation usually needs a continuous water supply [14]. Note that the CNT/PVA porous evaporator possesses good hydrophilicity as displayed in Fig. S2a because of the introduced PVA with lots of hydrophilic functional groups (–OH). Therefore, water can easily and quickly pass through the interconnected pores of porous composites. In addition, due to hydrophobic finishing on the upper surface of the porous composite, in contrast to Fig. S2a, the contact angle of the upper surface was increased obviously (Fig. S2b), giving it the ability to self-float above the water. Moreover, in order to compare the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of PVA, CNT/PVA, and J-CNT/PVA, we have taken a video to record the process of droplets falling on the surface of the material. The pictures of the different states of the droplets at different times were also taken and added to the supporting materials (Fig. S3). It can be seen that, compared with PVA and CNT/PVA, the contact angle of the upper surface of the composite is significantly increased after hydrophobic finishing. Especially for CNT/PVA, the droplets penetrated into the composite within 3 s from the beginning of dropping. While after the hydrophobic finishing becomes J-CNT/PVA, the contact angle of the upper surface can be stabilized at about 117°, which has an obvious hydrophobic finishing effect. At the same time, the effect diagram of seawater desalination before and after hydrophobic treatment of porous composite is illustrated in Fig. S4. It can be seen that the accumulation of salt on the surface of J-CNT/PVA after hydrophobic treatment is much less than that before treatment. This is due to the hydrophobic nature of the upper surface, the salt produced by evaporation of water will be dissolved in the water inside the complex again, and will not accumulate on the surface and without blockage of pores. Thus, the Janus structure can ensure an efficient water supply from the bottom water to the top regions during the vapor generation. To analyze the thermal stability of the porous evaporator with different mass ratios of CNT/PVA, TGA was used in the N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C/min from 50 °C to 600 °C. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the three curves shown a similar trend of weightlessness decomposition at 50–600 °C, the first decomposition reaction of CNT/PVA porous composites occurred in the range of 330–380 °C, the second thermal decomposition reaction of CNT/PVAs was after 410 °C, which were mainly due to the PVA decomposes in two steps. Besides, before 300 °C, there will be a small amount of weight loss due to evaporation of water previously adsorbed from the ambient environment. In summary, the evaporator has outstanding thermal stability and can reach the requirements of outdoor photothermal conversion material."
10,Photothermal performance of the J-CNT/PVAs,"3.2 Photothermal performance of the J-CNT/PVAs In order to characterize part of the performance of the evaporator, we used an electronic balance to evaluate the weight loss of water under sunlight (Fig. 5 a) and used an infrared thermal imaging camera to record the temperature change of the evaporation interface. Moreover, as showed in Fig. 5b, the physical picture of the solar energy evaporator, it can be clearly seen that the water evaporates from the surface of the evaporator into the air. In Fig. 5f, the CNT/PVA with different mass ratios including 0.2:1, 0.5:1, and 1:1 (PVA concentration was maintained at 50 mg mL−1) was measured under 1 sun illumination (1000 W m−2). Evaporation rates were 1.08 kg m−2h−1, 1.14 kg m−2h−1 and 1.17 kg m−2h−1, respectively. However, it was found that after several evaporation cycles the porous composite would not sink to the bottom but also would not completely float above the surface of the water (Fig. S5a). This will affect the evaporation rates and the evaporation stability of the evaporator, so we consider coating the upper surface of the composite with a layer of PDMS to give it certain hydrophobicity so that it can float on the water surface stably, as shown in Fig. S5b. Interestingly, we found that the evaporation rates of complexes with different CNT/PVA mass ratios did not differ much, but there were significant differences in overall appearance (Fig. S6). By comparison, it is found that CNT/PVA is prone to distortion at a lower mass ratio (Fig. S6a), while at a higher mass ratio, it is too rigid and prone to cracking (Fig. S6c). Therefore, the complex had better mechanical stability when the mass ratio of CNT/PVA was 1:2 (Fig. S6b). In addition, we find that the evaporation rate of the evaporator has been improved to some extent after hydrophobic finishing on the upper surface, which is speculated to be caused by the increase of effective evaporation area after the upper surface floats on the water surface. It was also found that the evaporation rate of the composite after hydrophobic treatment was significantly increased. As showed in Fig. 5g, the evaporation rates under one solar light are 1.34 kg m−2 h−1, 1.14 kg m−2 h−1 and 0.48 kg m−2 h−1. Besides we measured the surface temperature changes of the pure water and the J-CNT/PVA during the photothermal conversion process under 1 sun solar radiation by an infrared thermal imaging camera (Fig. 5e). The results show that in the first 20 min, the temperature change of the J-CNT/PVA was more obvious, and the temperature change was also faster. And we can see from Fig. 5c, d that the surface temperature of the J-CNT/PVA can be raised from nearly 29 °C to 44.4 °C after 20 min under 1 sun illumination. The interfacial water evaporation rate (v, kg m−2 h−1) was calculated using the following formula [43]: v = Δ m / ( s × Δ t ) Where Δ m (g) means the mass of evaporated water, and s means the surface area of the porous composites, Δ t is the time. And energy conversion efficiency ( η , % ) was calculated by the following formula [44]: η = Δ v × ( L V + Q ) / Q i Where Δ v is the rate of evaporation obtained by subtracting the evaporation rate in the dark, L V (J kg−1) represents the total enthalpy of sensible heat (294 kJ kg−1, from 30 to 100 °C with a specific heat of 4.2 J g−1 K−1) and phase transition of water from liquid to gas (2257 kJ kg−1), Q (J g−1) is the sensible heat of water of unit mass (4.2 J g−1 K−1 × Δ T ), where Δ T (K) is the temperature of water evaporation by minus the initial temperature of the water, and Q i is the power density of the input of solar light source (1 KW/m2). Thence, the evaporation rate and the photothermal conversion efficiency of the pure water, the CNT/PVA, and the J-CNT/PVA were shown in Fig. 5h, the evaporation rate of the J-CNT/PVA was almost 2.8 times that of water due to the proper design of the interface evaporation system to reduce the heat lost to the water body, and the high light absorption and conversion ability of carbon nanotubes to increase the energy obtained from sunlight [5]. And the photothermal conversion efficiency is 23.04%, 71.02%, 85.71%, respectively. For comparison, Table 1 lists the performance indicators of some photothermal materials reported in recent years. It can be clearly seen that the evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency of CNT/PVA are comparable and superior to most of the previous reports. In addition, the cyclic evaporation performance test of porous evaporators is shown in Fig. 5i, Fig. S9(a, b). After 10 cycles of testing, the J-CNT/PVAs maintained a relatively stable evaporation rate in pure water or seawater. However, the evaporation rate of CNT/PVA decreased significantly after four evaporation cycles, And then, it has dropped to almost the same level as the evaporation rate of pure water. The main reason is that after the internal pores are filled with water, they cannot continue to float on the water surface, and the evaporation rate drops quickly. In sum, the J-CNT/PVA has a stable freshwater production capacity and good commercial application prospects."
11,Seawater desalination and wastewater purification,"3.3 Seawater desalination and wastewater purification To further evaluate the application performance of the porous evaporator in seawater desalination and wastewater purification, the evaporator was utilized to desalinate seawater (taken from the Yellow Sea, Qingdao, China), desalinate lake water (taken from the Mirror moon Lake, Donghua University, Fig. S7) and purify wastewater containing heavy metal ions [45] (Wastewater containing Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr6+, and Zn2+ ions was prepared in the laboratory). Through the ion concentration test, we found Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ concentrations in initial seawater are 1925.74 mg/L, 272.91 mg/L, 537.96 mg/L and 265.8 mg/L, respectively. And the concentrations of that in initial lake water are 2717.37 mg/L, 716.45 mg/L, 805.62 mg/L, and 2513.51 mg/L, respectively. In Fig. 6 a, the evaporation rate of seawater and the J-CNT/PVA were measured under 1 sun illumination was 0.45 kg m−2 h−1,1.37 kg m−2 h−1, and the photothermal efficiency was 22.13% and 87.29% (Fig. 6b). And the evaporation rate of lake water and the porous composite under 1sun irradiance were 0.45 kg m−2 h−1, 1.27 kg m−2 h−1, and photothermal efficiency was 22.61% and 80.67% (Fig. S8a, b). At the same time, the porous evaporator has been tested at least 10 times, and the evaporation rate remained stable, indicating that the J-CNT/PVAs have excellent reusability in a real usage scenario (Fig. S9a). Besides, to calculate the ion rejection rate before and after desalination, the ICP technology was used to measure the concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ appear in seawater (Fig. 6c), lake water (Fig. S10) before and after desalination. As seen, in both desalinated seawater and lake water, the four main ions of Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ reduced drastically with every ion removal rate is above 99.86% and the Na+ ion concentration was much lower than the standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the drinking water standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [46]. Moreover, when the seawater desalination experiment was conducted under 1 sunlight, there was little salt deposition on the surface of the porous evaporator (Fig. S4b) indicating that the salt ions diffusion rate was faster than advection and the evaporator has certain practical application capabilities. In addition, the heavy metal ions wastewater containing Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr6+ , and Zn2+ ions, which initial concentrations are 6.47 mg/L, 6.9 mg/L, 7.28 mg/L, and 7.97 mg/L, respectively. After purification, the concentration of heavy metal ions in the water is considerably reduced, and the ion removal rate reached more than 96.81%. Especially for Cr6+, the ion concentration after purification is lower than 0.01 mg/L, and the ion removal rate exceeds 99.86% (Fig. 6). In addition, in order to assess the ability to purify lake water with a large amount of organic matter, a TOC test was also conducted. The results showed that the TOC of the lake water decreased from 82.25 mg/L to 4.64 mg/L (Fig. S11), and the removal rate of the carbon-containing organic matter reached 93.14%, which met the drinking water quality standard (GB 5749-2006). Therefore, these results suggest that the solar evaporator has practical application capabilities."
12,Outdoor evaporation experiment,"3.4 Outdoor evaporation experiment In order to study the outdoor evaporation performance of J-CNT/PVAs under outdoor natural light, a set of outdoor evaporation equipment was designed. The image of the outdoor evaporation equipment is shown in Fig. 7 b, c, and the manufactured evaporation device was placed in a position that can be exposed to sunlight. For this device, steam was first condensed on the transparent spherical glass cover to form water droplets and then collected and flowed into the bottom collecting basin. And during the experiment, the beaker and the water and solar evaporator inside the beaker were weighed and measured by an electronic scale everyone hour to calculate the evaporation rate of the water. Meanwhile, Fig. 7a records the outdoor evaporation experiment of campus from 09:00 am to 16:00. The device achieved efficient freshwater production of 5.16 kg m−2 within the 7 h. The above results showed that under natural sunlight conditions, it has strong sunlight absorption capacity and good light-to-heat conversion capacity, and can produce fresh water. Whereas, unsurprisingly, since the outdoor light intensity will inevitably be affected by numerous factors, the average evaporation rate measured outdoors was lower than that indoors [47]."
13,Conclusions,"Finally, we successfully prepared a Janus porous evaporator (J-CNT/PVA) with anisotropic wettability through a simple direct freeze forming strategy combined with single-side PDMS decoration. The evaporation rate of J-CNT/PVA was 1.34 kg m−2 h−1 and the photothermal conversion efficiency was as high as 85.71% under 1 sun illumination (1 KW m−2). After the purification, the total organic content of the lake water has been significantly reduced, the removal rate of several major ion concentrations in the seawater has reached more than 99%, and the metal ion content after the purification of heavy metal wastewater has also been dramatically reduced. Further, the repeatability test and outdoor evaporation experiment indicated that the solar-driven water evaporator has practically clean water production capacity. Therefore, we believe that the high-efficiency evaporate rate and the simple preparation process will make the solar-driven water evaporator potentially useful in practical seawater desalination and wastewater purification."
