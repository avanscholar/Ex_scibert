0,Introduction,"Increasing demand for new and alternative energy sources due to the pollution and limited availability fossil fuels. Solid and liquid waste produced by various processes may easily affect the environment and cause damage to the eco system. These wastes can be processed to reduce the pollution, as well converting into alternate energy sources. In wastewater biorefinery, renewable products such as chemicals, minerals and energy can be obtained as a part of waste management (Morgan-Sagastume et al., 2014). Wastewater can be used as a probable feedstock to produce bioenergy apart from the remediation process. Recovering and reprocessing of valuable materials from waste or wastewater have been recognized as main concern in environmental sustainability and pollution control. In recent days, bio electrochemical system (BES) gained more attention in wastewater treatment. BES is a promising way to recover valuable chemicals, fuels and electricity generation with concurrent waste treatment (Roy and Pandit, 2018). Petrol derived plastic creates a major problem in environment as its degradation is slow (Akaraonye et al., 2010). Because of their complex structure, they may remain as it is for many years in land and water bodies. When it incinerated, it generates toxic products and consumes more time for recycling. Thus to reduce the environmental impacts of plastics is to replace the conventional polymers with biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polysaccharides, polylactide and aliphatic polyesters (Castilho et al., 2009). PHAs are more promising due to their characteristic biodegradability, sustainability and environment-friendly properties. Reddy et al., (2019) reported that PHA have been extensively used as an alternative to petroleum-derived plastics for use in medical products, agriculture products, and packaging materials. These biopolymers are recovered from wastewater through microbial actions (Mannina et al., 2019). Biopolymer production from renewable sources like wastewater and mixed culture are gaining importance (Reddy and Mohan, 2012). Recent studies on BES of biopolymer production have created a new interest (Pant et al., 2010; Srikanth et al., 2012; Ray and Ghangrekar, 2015). BES has advantages of organic removal with power generation which also produce some useable products such as biopolymers, chemicals and H2 gas. Ray and Ghangrekar, 2015 reported about chitosan, a natural biopolymer which recovered along with the power production. This review aims to provide a detailed over view of bio electrochemical systems and production of biopolymers in BES."
1,BES – bio electrochemical system,"BES is an appropriate alternative method when compared with other conventional wastewater treatment and bioenergy conversion or production methods. Recent decades, BES gets more attraction due to the energy harvest from waste or wastewater by metabolism of microbes. This system may act as probable method for clean energy generation combined with better bioremediation. BES has been investigated for its potential applications in various areas, especially wastewater treatment with simultaneous production of bioenergy and biopolymers (Li and Chen, 2018). In BES, microorganisms play a vital role because of their ability to oxidize the organic matter through the metabolic activities. The advantage of BES is both the oxidation and reduction can take place through microbes. Generally in MFC, oxidation reaction takes place on anode while the generation of biofuel or valuable products on cathode through reduction reaction (Wang and Ren, 2013). BES involves several mechanisms such as (i) anaerobic oxidation and reduction reactions takes place in anode (ii) anaerobic oxidation and reduction reactions takes place in cathode (iii) adsorption or absorption on electrodes and (iv) combined of above mentioned mechanisms which depends on the type of BES. BES can be classified depending upon the mode of operations: microbial fuel cell (MFC), microbial electro synthesis (MES), microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), microbial desalination cell (MDC) and microbial solar cell (MSC). Most commonly in all BES, electro active biofilm present in anode oxidizes the organic matter to generate power. But in cathode different outcomes/product such as hydrogen production and valuable chemicals can be achieved depending upon the type of BES (Roy and Pandit, 2018). Reactor configurations, type of inoculum used, functional microbial consortia, physical and chemical conditions, type of substrate and production of energy products or chemical recovery are the factors which influence the BES. Many recent studies investigate about the possibility of recovering valuable products such as chemicals, biopolymers and nutrients, also heavy metals recovery from waste and wastewater by BES. BES has an advantage of using diverse range of substrate including waste and wastewater, due to its sustainability, economical and ease adaptableness to environment (Kim et al., 2015). BES has a vital advantage when compared to other remediation process such as physical, chemical and biological methods. Since they either need huge amount of energy or need of adding chemicals. However BES acquires more attention due to the low cost operation and considered as a better remediation in recent years. Fig. 1 shows the various types of bioelectrochemical systems."
2,Microbial fuel cell (MFC),"2.1 Microbial fuel cell (MFC) Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is used to recover energy from waste or wastewater treatment. In MFC, chemical energy produced during treatment is converted into electrical energy by catalytic and microbial reactions of microbes (Jayashree et al., 2014). Generally, MFC is made up of two chamber; anode and cathode chamber where in anode chamber, anode is present whereas cathode is present in cathode chamber. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) is present in system which separates anode and cathode chamber. An anode considerably influence the biofilm generation and the transfer of electrons between the electron acceptor and microbes. (Bajracharya et al., 2016). MFC current generation directly depends on the electroactive metabolic reactions of biofilm which developed on the anode, in which electrons are transferred to anode surface through two ways: direct electron transfer and intermediated electron transfer. If there any conflicts in metabolic pathway could lead to deviation in power production. Microbes get attached on anode will form in turn an electroactive microbial film, which act as electro catalytic unit and assist the substrate get oxidized. The electrons produced during the oxidation will be transferred to cathode through an external circuit. Exoelectrogens present in anodic biofilm are capable of transferring the produced electrons from substrate to anode, which is responsible for the power production in MFC (Logan and Regan, 2006). Protons produced in anode are able to migrate to cathode chamber through proton exchange membrane. In Oxidation, MFC needs varied population of electricity producing microbes. Compared to pure cultures, maximum and steady power production in MFC is obtained in mixed cultures. Generally, MFC can be configured as: two chambered MFC and single chambered MFC. High electrode surface area affords a larger surface for microbial adhesion and electron transfer between microbes and electrode, improves the current density in MFC. Carbon felt, graphite brush and carbon nanotubes are most preferable materials used as anode due to their porous structure. Two chambered MFC is difficult for scaling up due to complex design whereas single chamber is simple in design. Due to that, single chamber MFC gets more attraction in which anode and cathode is present in same chamber without any PEM (Karuppiah et al., 2018). MFC design, configuration and construction would influence the internal resistance, which governs the performance of MFC. Several researchers studied about the organic removal in treating various wastewater such as retting wastewater (Jayashree et al., 2014; Jayashree et al., 2015), sea food processing wastewater (Jayashree et al., 2016), surgical cotton industry wastewater (Tamilarasan et al., 2017), dye (Karuppiah et al., 2018), chocolate industry wastewater (Subha et al., 2019) beside with the simultaneous benefits of electricity production. Recent advancement in MFC as biosensor has a potential of quick and real time monitoring of water quality gets more attraction. MFC enhanced with electrochemically active microbes has been used as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and toxicity detection biosensor (Chandrasekhar et al., 2018). Moreover, Chandrasekhar et al. (2015) stated that MFC could be used for tracing food wastage. In this, the power production was identified to increase when contaminate level increases. This can be helpful for quick detection and details of microbes in food products."
3,Microbial electro synthesis (MES),"2.2 Microbial electro synthesis (MES) Microbial electro synthesis (MES) is also known as bioelectrosynthesis in which both microbial and electro synthesis process takes place. In electrochemical system, CO2 reduction takes place along with organic oxidation or reduction using microbes (biocatalysts) (Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). MES process involves redox reaction on biocatalyst, electron acceptor accompanied by electrochemically active redox mediators. This is a novel BES which exploits the power produced by oxidation which takes place in anode to produce valuable products in cathode. Mohanakrishna et al. (2015) stated that cathode with biofilm might reduce the terminal electron acceptor to produce valuable products. Nevin et al. (2010) stated that microbial catalytic reaction of carbon dioxide reduction through the current on cathode. Biocathodes plays a vital role in MES, where the oxidizing microbes involved in production of valuable by-products such as biopolymers, ethanol, acetate and butyrate. Desloover et al. (2012) clearly described about the operational and technical considerations of MES and are more significant that at a maximum level of recovery of produced electrons into a valuable products. Moreover choosing the culture either pure or mixed as biocatalyst might lead to the optimization the process. Mixed culture is highly suitable for MES but the end-product toxicity and opposing reactions can reduce the process efficiency. Rabaey et al. (2011) described the metabolic consideration about the MES. Commonly described routes in MES are fermentation outcomes or reduction of organic matter. Main challenge in MES includes providing the substrate to the microorganisms, ensuring sufficient specificity of the production pathway relative to existing conversions, and minimizing cell growth."
4,Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC),"2.3 Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), a promising method that will get attracted as biorefinery for waste to product conversion. MEC utilizes exoelectrogenic microorganisms which present in anode to convert organic matter present in the wastewater into electrical current by releasing protons and electrons. The produced electrons are then transported to the cathode to diminish the protons for H2 generation. A small voltage is applied between two electrodes so as to produce hydrogen on cathode (Kadier et al., 2015). Zhang and Angelidaki (2014) stated that using MEC, along with hydrogen production, other organic/inorganic valuable products such as polymers, H2O2, methane and formic acid are also produced. Based on the biocathode, MEC might be classified as: (i) Half biological two-chambered biocathode MEC; (ii) Full biological two-chambered biocathode MEC; (iii) Full biological single-chambered biocathode MEC (Jafary et al., 2015). The authors stated that high COD yield (60%–100%) were achieved in MEC systems compared to other H2 production methods. Guo et al. (2017) stated in a dual chamber tubular MEC achieved 7.1 L L− 1 d− 1 hydrogen production rate with the voltage production of 1 V. Moreno et al. (2016) reported about the methane production along with domestic wastewater in MEC. The authors also stated that homoacetogenic activity was improved by promoting hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. High hydraulic retention time was favourable for methane production in MEC and cost effective."
5,Microbial solar cell (MSC),"2.4 Microbial solar cell (MSC) In MSC, photoautotrophic microorganisms capture the photons from solar and further utilized by electroactive microbes to implement electrode-driven reactions. This kind of reactions produces current or substances such as H2, CH4, H2O2 and ethanol along with valuable products like biopolymer. Predominantly photosynthesis precedes the generation of organic compounds, consequently fed into the anode section where they are oxidized through electroactive microorganisms to produce electrons. The produced electrons are migrated towards cathode section where O2 reduction takes place and form H2O. Synechocystis, chlorophyte and some other electroactive species present on the phototrophic biofilms which is developed on the anode surface. Wang et al. (2015) reported about MSC where treatment of algae biomass Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris was fed as a substrate in MFC along with lake water, for simultaneous current production and water treatment. After the treatment in anaerobic digester, algal biomass from photo- bioreactor was fed into the fuel cell. Using chlorella at anode in MSC, the experiment achieved a conversion of 0.04%, which results under a power density of 14 mW m− 2. Advantage of MSC is direct conversion of light to current and simultaneous CO2 sequestration."
6,Microbial desalination cell (MDC),"2.5 Microbial desalination cell (MDC) Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) exploit the electric potential difference which established across the anode and the cathode by MFC process to function in situ desalination. Cao et al., 2009 reported the first desalination system in arrangement with MFC process. MDC contains an additional middle section in between the anode and cathode sections, for desalination. The middle section is separated by an anion exchange membrane (AEM) headed to anode and a cation exchange membrane (CEM) towards the cathode. Microbes present in anode oxidize the organic substances and generate electrons and protons. The produced electrons are moved outwardly to cathode while the anions in desalination section moved to anode to maintain charge neutrally, thus desalination takes place in the middle section. The transportation of ions from middle section towards anode and cathode upsurges the anolyte and catholyte conductivity. This improves the current generation because of its mass transfer and high conductivity in MDC. Organic and salt removal along with current generation or combined with reverse osmosis (RO), MDC can be operated. Jacobson et al., 2011 compared a RO system with MDC, in which 2.2 kWh energy used to purify 1 m3 of saline water by RO while same volume of saline water could be treated with the power production of 1.8 kWh. Luo et al., 2011 reported that H2 produced in cathode when MDC is operated as electrolysis mode along with desalination occurs."
7,Biopolymers,"Biopolymers such as PHA can be produced while treating municipal and industrial waste through biological process (Morgan-Sagastume et al., 2014). PHA and its copolymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhydroxypropionate (PHP), and polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) are a kind of biopolyesters mainly composed of hydroxyalkanoates monomers. These biopolymers which have properties of mechanical, physical and thermoplastic properties are alike with polypropylene, petroleum derived plastics. PHAs are bio compatible, recyclable and produce zero toxic waste, since they are biodegradable into carbon dioxide and water by bacterial attack (Martins et al., 2014). Moreover Morgan-Sagastume et al. (2014) also reported that PHAs are the probable by-products of bio refinery from wastewater, those flexible applicability make them vital components to biodegradable plastics. Table 1 reported about the biopolymer production by treating various waste or wastewater. Hazer et al., (2012) stated that these kinds of polymers have high degree of polymerization and crystalline, optically active, isotactic, and insoluble in water. High production cost may be the disadvantage of PHA, when compared with other polymer production. Chen et al. (2013) stated that CO2 was utilized as carbon, produced alcohols, carboxylic acid and biopolymer when cathodic reduction potential was inferred by external power in PHA synthesis pathway through cathodic biofilm of BES. Srikanth et al. (2012) reported about the enriched electro genesis and gathering of produced PHA in the cathodic chamber of MFC using aerobic microbe groups as biocatalyst. Fig. 2 shows the PHA formation in BES. Generally, biopolymer biosynthetic pathways are linked with microbial metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, β-oxidation and Calvin Cycle. Acetyl-CoA is most commonly intermediate shared between biopolymer biosynthetic and microbial metabolic pathways (Tan et al., 2014). Using waste carbon source, PHA and PHB can be synthesized. Kumar et al. (2019) reviewed about the conversion of volatile fatty acids from dark fermentative effluents in biohydrogen reactor to PHA. Moreover they stated that PHA production using mixed cultures is more energy efficient than pure cultures. Keshavarz and Roy (2010) reported that over 300 species of bacteria and archaea are known for the production of PHA. Valentino et al. (2017) reported that biopolymer and other valuable compounds can be obtained by recovering carbon as sources from waste and wastewater. PHAs are produced into short chain length (scl, 3–5C), medium chain length (mcl, 6–14C), and long chain length (lcl, >14C) monomers, while scl-PHAs having properties similar to conventional plastics and mcl-PHAs performing alike elastomers. Three step conversion of acetyl-coA to PHB is quite simplest and most common pathway, and b-oxidation of fatty acids coupled to PHA synthase is used to produce mcl-PHAs. Brigham et al. (2011) stated that the recombinant microbes efficiently convert sugars into PHA. Bioplastics obtained from biopolymers are similar to polypropylene and polyethylene (petroleum derived polymers) by physical and chemical methods. They are biodegradable which can be synthesized from renewable carbon sources (Laycock et al., 2012). Bioplastics are eco-friendly, used in the applications of packing material in food processing, construction, medical usage and agriculture (Ivanov et al., 2015). Bioplastics produced from PHA have numerous applications such as in drug delivery, tissue engineering and as packing material because of its easily biodegradable properties (Bhatia et al., 2018)."
8,Biopolymers production in various BES,"BES technology is used to produce many high-value chemicals or products from inexpensive substrates (Logan and Rabaey, 2012). Srikanth et al. (2012) noted the PHAs production under microaerophilic microenvironment at biocathode of BES. In BES at biocathode, low level dissolved oxygen (DO) started PHA production as an alternate pathway to re-oxidize the Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (Kalathil et al., 2013). Pham et al. (2009) reported about electrochemically active biofilm formed on the anode act as bioanode, which can produce PHB and other chemicals such as amino acids and lactic acids from organic substrates. Pant et al. (2010) stated that microbes in anode oxidize the organic matter and produce the biopolymers. A dense layer of biopolymers attached on the surface as a biofilm (microbes) are encased and glued as matrix of biopolymers. Composition of biopolymers and presence of numerous various microbes are the main factors which affects the electron transfer efficiency in BES (Prakasam et al., 2017). Behera et al. (2010) reported that power production decreases as the biofilm thickness increases. By emergent developments in BES, it was identified that biocathode has been used to enhance electrogenesis activity with PHA related production in cathode (P. Kumar et al., 2018; M. Kumar et al., 2018). Srikanth et al. (2012) investigated about the BES performance by treating synthetic wastewater and achieved the power generation of 512 mV and PHA accumulation about 19% of dry cell weight through electrogenic activity. Moreover, enriched culture from activated sludge and anaerobic digester were used in cathode and anode chamber respectively in BES. PHB synthesis could be identified as a form of biomass synthesis in BES (Zhang et al., 2018). The fraction of electrons used for PHB synthesis in BES ranges from 3% to more than 50%. PHB accumulation could be induced through the low dissolved oxygen concentration or electron donor (Reddy and Mohan, 2012). PHA accruing microbes may act as electron acceptor in cathode under microaerophilic conditions. This type of strategy in BES has the advantages of generating power, treating waste and producing biopolymers in single fermentation reaction. Biopolymer production in various BES was tabulated in Table 2 ."
9,Biopolymer production in MFC,"4.1 Biopolymer production in MFC Gurav et al. (2019) reported about a novel approach for one-pot hydrolysis of refractory chitin biomass into N-acetylglucosamine by simultaneously producing power and PHA in MFC. The authors analysed the microbial cell biomass from MFC and found that PHA main components such as 3-polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and 3-polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) were produced as 1.020 g/L and 0.198 g/L, respectively. Higher anode potential led to the formation of thicker biofilm which consist of more microbes. Stronger extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and nanowires matrix are present in anode at lower potentials (Hasany et al., 2016). The consumption of intracellular biopolymers was described as the main reason for the observed coulombic efficiency. Wu et al. (2019) described about MFC in which presence of polyphosphate granules could be identified as polyphosphate accumulating microbes. Besides, microbial accumulation of PHA also identified with the phosphate accumulation in reactor. The identification of PHA and polyphosphate showed that, the active metabolism of polyphosphate accumulating microbes in reactor. Furthermore, it could suggest that the polyphosphate accumulating microbes removed phosphate and stored as polyphosphate and probably it was used as energy source for PHA synthesis. Fig. 3 illustrates the polyhydroxybutyrate production in microbial fuel cell."
10,Biopolymers production in MES,"4.2 Biopolymers production in MES Nishio et al. (2013) reported about PHB production using Ralstonia eutropha was accelerated by extracellular electron transfer (EET) using a biocompatible mediator. PHB production rate was enhanced by 60% when compared to without the EET process. From microbial electrosynthesis, self-distilling anodic O2 and biocathodic methane could be delivered to PHA-producing methanotrophs. Alternatively, acetate and O2 from an electroacetogenic microbial system may be used as substrates for PHA production by a second microbiome, or as a feedstock for other chemical production (Marshall et al., 2013). Rengasamy et al. (2017) reported about PHB production in MES with the cathodes coated with Prussian blue (PB). In this experiment, immobilized PB can be used to increase the electron uptake by TIE-1 and improves the PHB generation. The authors identified that the PHB production would be 1.4 times more when electrodes are coated with PB. C. necator microbes has the ability to mount up a huge amounts of biopolymer specially PHB (Debabov, 2017). Grousseau et al. (2014) performed a modification in C. necator to enable isopropanol synthesize, an additive for fuel. During this modification, there might be an interruption of acetyl-CoA–PHB pathway and consequent conversion of this compound into acetoacetate and acetone, followed by acetone reduced into isopropanol. Alkotaini et al. (2018) reported about PHB production in bioelectrosynthesis process. The authors achieved a yield of 1.6 mg using a modified electrode. Ranaivoarisoa et al. (2019) reported about the PHB production about 18.8 ± 0.5 g/L in MES with a Prussian blue (iron based redox mediator) immobilized cathode in fresh water medium using Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 microbes. Zhang et al. (2018) described about continuous flow biocathode based MES for the removal of selenate. In cathode, selenite was reduced into selenium nano particles. The authors achieved that PHA accumulation could be identified as form of biomass synthesis. Therefore in this experimental setup, biomass synthesis of 16% and 61% of obtained in anodic and cathodic chamber respectively. This states that high PHB accumulation in cathode than in anode showed that less availability of electrons in cathode than anode where more electrons are utilized for PHB accumulation. Fig. 4 illustrates the PHB production in microbial electro synthesis. Rowaihi et al. (2018) experimented about an integrated one-pot electromicrobial setup as MES setup. In this experiment, CO2 is electrochemically reduced into formate, then available Cupriavidus necator H16 strains were under microbial conversion of formate into PHB."
11,Biopolymer production in MEC,"4.3 Biopolymer production in MEC PHB accumulates as a granule in the cytoplasm of microbes to store carbon and energy. Freguia et al. (2007) reported that anode respiring microbes (ARM) can produce power by the oxidation of intracellular biopolymers (e.g., PHB) gathered in an MEC fed with acetate. This power from PHB consumption could account for 57% of the total power produced in the acetate-fed MEC. DiPippo et al. (2009) stated that PHB accumulation in biofilm anode resulted when acetate produced in propionate fermentation. Moreover the authors stated that biopolymer gathering microbes that might lead extracellular electron transfer which would break down biopolymers into acetate and then oxidize the acetate to power production. Instead, biopolymer-accumulating microbes break biopolymers into acetate, and ARM consume the acetate for power production through syntrophic interactions between biopolymer-accumulating microbes and ARM (Dhar et al., 2013). Yet, biopolymer deposit in anodic biofilm indicates that biopolymers would offer extra electrons for ARM, and observed coulombic efficiency could be over 100% constantly. Biopolymer accumulation in microbial electrolysis cell was shown in Fig. 5 ."
12,Biopolymers production in MSC,"4.4 Biopolymers production in MSC In MSC, solar energy is used to reduce carbon content and convert into a sustainable product. Solar to fuel and solar to chemical are the two forms of this system. This approach might be developed to convert the essential substrate into valuable fuels and chemicals. Torella et al. (2015) experimented about solar cell to achieve a higher conversion of fuel. In this system, O2 produced at anode is due to the electrolysis happens by microbial culture where as H2 and formate generated at cathode. By producing fuel alcohols, H2 oxidizing autotroph microbes may grow on the developed H2 or formate. While R. eutropha quickly produce PHB as product by converting acetyl-CoA under nutrient limited growth conditions. Fig. 6 displays the biopolymer production in microbial solar cell. In another study, Liu et al. (2016) reported about the synthesis of PHB take place in H16 strain as an internal carbon storage pathway, when R. eutropha confronts nutrient restraints tied with carbon. PHB synthesis was not in clear till nitrogen became restraining in system. PHB synthesis pathway could modify to evacuate the fusel alcohols like 3-methyl-1-butanol, isobutanol and isopropanol. Woo (2017) reported about a hybrid method of solar to fuels and chemicals has been produced various biopolymers and alcohol from CO2 and H2 in a one pot reactor. In this hybrid microbial catalyst method, metabolically-engineered chemolitho autotrophs such as Ralstonia eutropha have been used to produce several valuable products. Moreover acetate as widely used feedstock in this BES that produced PHB and fusel alcohol such as isoprenoid and n-butanol using E. coli. This BES obtained above 10% of CO2 reduction energy efficiency with the production of PHB and fuel alcohols."
13,Biopolymer applications,"Due to its biocompatible and biodegradable nature, it can be used to improve the performances of other biologically active molecules in a product. The section discusses some of the applications of biopolymer. Biopolymer gets more attention in biomedical applications as medicine carrier, making in medical device, tissue engineering. Gelatin is a biopolymer widely used in medical applications due to its biodegradable, nontoxic, nonirritant characteristics (Chanchal, 2014). It is used in dressing wounds as an adhesive. Porous gelatin scaffolds and layers were produced with the help of solvents or which enable the support to hold medicine or which supplied to the wound for healing. Bio polymeric materials prepared from proteins, polysaccharides, and synthetic biopolymers are selected but lack of properties and stability in aqueous environments necessary for medical applications. Recently, researchers have focussed on synthesizing environmental friendly nanoparticles. Nanomaterials made up of metals have their unique properties because of their quantum size effects. Yet, most of their synthesis practise executes a major threat to the environment. Biopolymers have been widely used as casing and reducing agent for various nanoparticles synthesis. Biopolymers like chitosan, PHA, soluble starch, gelatin, and cellulose can be used to substitute various toxic regents in synthesizing different nanoparticles. Chitosan, a biopolymer widely used in water treatment. It act as flocculants in treatment process and get biodegraded (Ray and Ghangrekar, 2015). Chitosan also removes metals from water by developing chelates. Many other flocculants are available but they form a residual effect, compared to chitosan. PHA is more attractive type of biodegradable material widely used as biodegradable polyester in packing (Othman, 2014). Other plastic materials are not an attractive usage for packing especially in food processing. But the processing of bioplastic is more difficult and cost expensive as the reason behind getting no attention in common usage."
14,Conclusion,"BES system gets attractive due to the energy production along with valuable product recovery. This review highlighted about the process involved in BES and also explained the production of biopolymers in BES. In this review, many literatures were reviewed that states the biopolymer production in BES with the production of electricity and other valuable products. Recent improvements regarding different BES strategies and biopolymer production offer new opportunities to make biopolymer production more feasible. Besides, incorporating BES with other biodegradation process may lead to effective application in developing waste bio refinery models for sustainable bio economy."
