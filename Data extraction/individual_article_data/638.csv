0,Introduction,"The promotion of hydrogen for energy applications expects to replace the massive use of fossil fuels in the near-middle future, thus reducing the current high levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and other emissions, responsible for global warming and health problems in humans [1,2]. Among other alternatives, hydrogen could be obtained from a wide variety of feedstock and technologies, providing a tremendous competitive advantage for a progressive transition from traditional to renewable energy sources in both concentrated or decentralized centers [3,4]. Particularly, mature thermochemical routes such as steam reforming, pyrolysis, or gasification are mainly fed by fossil fuels in industry. However, all of them can be easily adapted for working with renewable, i.e. bio-ethanol, bio-gas or, in general, biomass [5–7], and residual feedstock, i.e. agricultural, industrial or municipal wastes [8,9]. In this context, a combination of thermochemical and biological processes, i.e. steam reforming of gaseous product streams from algae liquefaction, has been proposed as an interesting alternative [10,11]. In practice, most of these studies optimize both catalyst design and operating conditions for some model compounds that simulate fairly well the behavior of real complex mixtures containing multiple molecules [12]. This is the particular case of acetic acid (AA), usually considered as an excellent model compound to prepare a synthetic aqueous fraction coming from bio-oil production [12–15]. However, even though steam reforming of light hydrocarbons has been widely investigated [16–19], particular conditions for using acetic acid or related aqueous phases containing this compound are still under investigation. One of the first references appeared in 2004 when Takanabe et al. published the use of acetic acid as a model oxygenate for steam reforming of bio-oil with Pt/ZrO2 catalysts [20]. They evidenced an almost complete acetic acid conversion and hydrogen yield close to thermodynamic equilibrium but noted a significant catalyst deactivation by forming of oligomers, which blocked active sites. Basagiannis and Verykios adopted a similar strategy with acetic acid as a model compound of a synthetic bio-oil to study its reaction network under steam reforming with a Ni-based catalyst [21]. They found that decomposition and ketonization became relevant together with the main steam reforming reactions, especially at intermediate temperatures. Moreover, despite the presence of Ni, the catalyst promoted steam reforming reactions while shifting its activity towards lower temperatures and retarding the coke deposition rate onto the catalyst surface. However, significant deactivation was observed at particularly low temperatures. Iwasa et al. compared the catalytic activity for these reactions in mesoporous materials containing various metals as active-phase, establishing a decreasing AA conversion for the series Pt > Pt/Ni > Ni, although maintaining comparable H2 production levels for all the catalysts [22]. Thaicharoensutcharittham et al. analyzed in detail the catalytic activity of diverse Ni-based materials as a function of the metal loading, concluding a strong relationship between both factors [23]. An et al. performed a similar study at T = 600 °C, P = 1 atm, H2O/AA = 4, and WHSV = 5.01 gAA gcatalyst −1 h−1, evidencing again the above-mentioned influence of Ni loading on both catalytic activity and carbon formation [24]. Particularly, the amount of deposited carbidic-like carbon decreased, and graphitic-like carbon increased with Ni loading from 9 to 15 wt%, thus selecting an intermediate content (12 wt%) as best conditions for the catalyst performance. Other works also evaluated the hydrogen production by acid acetic steam reforming (AASR) at mild-temperatures in the presence of a wide variety of catalysts containing Ni as active metal but over diverse substrates, especially attending critical aspects such as conversion, hydrogen yield, and deactivation by coke formation [25–31]. In this context, Chen et al. aimed to gather together the results reached with different catalysts and published a critical review on the main catalysts used for AASR, including fabrication strategies, mechanic understanding, and most frequent catalyst deactivation processes [32]. Besides both AASR operating conditions and metal loading in catalysts, the intrinsic effect of the metal precursors on the final behavior of catalysts was also suggested [33]. Moreover, the addition of other metals as co-active phases in Ni-based catalysts shown a clear impact on both reaction performance and formation of reaction intermediates [34–37]. The research group headed by Calles has also published diverse works addressing the synthesis of multiple Ni-based catalysts supported over SBA-15 and their application for hydrogen production via steam reforming from ethanol [38,39], glycerol [40,41], or acetic acid [11,42,43]. All the above-mentioned studies were carried out in traditional packed-bed reactors, where a certain amount of catalyst was placed in the lumen, and produced hydrogen must be later purified in independent equipment [5,44,45]. The combination of both stages in a single membrane reactor, until our best knowledge, very scarce up to now. This fact contrasts other processes in which ultra-pure hydrogen is generated and separated in-situ in a new reactor configuration by selective permeation through the reactor wall acting as a membrane, usually made of pure palladium or Pd-based alloys [46,47]. Basile et al. studied the effect of the catalytic bed pattern in AASR in a membrane reactor by using two different commercial catalysts based on Ni and Ru as active metals from Engelhard and Johnson Matthey, respectively, and an unsupported thick Pd77Ag23 membrane with around 50 μm, demonstrating its experimental viability [48]. Iulianelli et al. expanded this preliminary study focusing on the influence of the different flow configurations inside the membrane reactor, as well as the sweep factor and the reaction itself[49]. They recently reported these results and most of the available literature about previous studies for AASR in traditional reactors instead of those carried out in membrane reactors [50]. However, it should be noted that noticeably advances in the development of new Pd-supported membranes are produced during the last years [51,52], mainly aimed to reduce their metal thickness and to increase both H2 permeation and stability, thus being highly recommended their test in membrane reactor applications. Among others, Electroless Pore-Plated (ELP-PP) membranes have evidenced an excellent performance for a wide variety of experimental conditions during permeation tests with metal thicknesses in the range 10–20 μm, also including contrary directions for the permeate flux, which could cause tensile stress and possible delamination of other traditional palladium top coatings and intermediate layers [53]. However, their evaluation should be completed with more complex gas mixtures, typical of common industrial applications, as well as in real membrane reactor conditions. In this context, the behavior of ELP-PP membranes has been recently evaluated in both fixed and fluidized bed membrane reactors for a relatively simple H2 production process via water gas shift reaction (WGS), in which carbon monoxide reacts with steam water to be completely oxidized into carbon dioxide while generating additional hydrogen. This reaction, carried out at mild conditions (T = 300–450 °C and simple gas mixtures), typically appears after any reformer to adjust the composition of the syngas for each particular application. From the above-mentioned experiments, the mechanical stability of ELP-PP membranes was ensured in real conditions [54]. However, two important issues should be considered at this point. First, the analyzed membranes in the above-mentioned study lack any ceramic intermediate layer and, as a consequence, they were thicker than the most recent ones, all of them prepared onto modified porous stainless steel (PSS) supports with CeO2 intermediate layers but still not tested into real membrane reactor devices [55,56]. Second, it should also be taken into account that the most interesting thermochemical reactions for hydrogen production, i.e. gasification or steam reforming, usually involve complex reaction schemes in which appear multiple compounds, not only H2, CO, or CO2 as occurring in the WGS. Therefore, combining these recent ELP-PP membranes with the above-mentioned processes could attract great interest for both researchers and industrial stakeholders. Under these premises, the present study analyzes for the first time the combination of a heterogeneous Ni/SBA-15 catalyst with ELP-PP composite Pd-membranes prepared onto CeO2/PSS supports in a tubular packed-bed membrane reactor for H2 production via acetic acid steam reforming. First, the available characterization of this type of membranes is completed after scaling-up their length around four times, including their behavior against CO2-rich gas mixtures. All main operating conditions for AASR (temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity) are evaluated in both traditional and membrane reactor configurations, also considering catalysts deactivation by coke formation and their regeneration."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,Membrane preparation,"2.1 Membrane preparation The composite Pd-based membranes applied for this study have been prepared using modified tubular AISI 316L porous stainless-steel (PSS) supports, purchased from Mott Metallurgical Corporation with 0.1 μm media grade pore size and symmetric structure. The supports were modified by adding an outer coat of dense CeO2 particles as an intermediate layer and following by incorporating a top palladium film by Electroless Pore-Plating (ELP-PP). The original PSS supports were first cut into pieces of 70 mm in length, welding two dense stainless-steel tubes of 20 mm in length on each extreme (total length of tubes 110 mm) and cleaning the surface by successive immersions in sodium hydroxide (0.1 M, 5 min), hydrochloric acid (0.1 M, 5 min) and ethanol (96 vol%, 15 min) at 60 °C under ultrasonic stirring. After completely drying the supports (110 °C for at least 8 h), the composite membranes were prepared by following the general procedure described elsewhere [55,56], adapted to the new length of supports, around four times larger than previous ones. Briefly, the supports were calcined at 600 °C for 12 h in air atmosphere to generate a first thin top layer of Fe/Cr oxides [57] and then further modified with the incorporation of dense CeO2 particles (average particle diameter of around 100 nm, Alfa-Caesar) by Vacuum-Assisted Dip-Coating (VA-DC) and calcination at 500 °C for 5 h [55]. These CeO2 particles, doped with fine Pd-nuclei before to be incorporated onto the porous support, expect to reduce both pore mouth size and average external surface roughness before the palladium plating while preventing any possible metal interdiffusion between support and palladium [56]. Finally, the Pd topcoat was deposited by ELP-PP following the detailed procedure published elsewhere [53,55,56]. The Pd precursor, PdCl2 from Sigma-Aldrich (99 w.% purity, with 60% palladium content), is complexed with NH4OH (Scharlau, 32 vol%) and a certain amount of Na2EDTA (Scharlau) as stabilizer, reacting with N2H4 (Scharlau, 99 w.% purity diluted up to 0.2 M) in a controlled autocatalytic chemical reaction to reduce Pd2+ ions into Pd0. It should be noted that both metal precursor and reducing solutions were added from opposite sides of the modified porous substrate to prevail the reaction just inside the pores or vicinities."
3,Membrane characterization: morphological analysis and permeation tests,"2.2 Membrane characterization: morphological analysis and permeation tests The morphology of composite membranes included in this study was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-2100N, equipped with an energy dispersive analytical system for microprobe analysis) and optical profilometry (Zeta-20 Optical Profiler). Gravimetric analyses from a Kern electronic balance type ABS 220-4 (accuracy of ±0.001 g) were also used to obtain the weight gain of the membrane after each preparation step. The reproducibility of the process and the estimated Pd-thickness by considering homogeneous incorporation around the external surface of supports were determined from these data. For this purpose, good reproducibility was assumed for similar membrane weight gains after calcination and incorporation of CeO2 particles and Pd-film. Moreover, a series of permeation tests were also carried out to evaluate the particular behavior of these membranes. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup used for these tests, which was also employed to perform the reaction tests described later. The apparatus is formed by a cylindrical 316L stainless steel cell where a tubular Pd-based membrane can be placed between two graphite O-rings to separate both retentate and permeate zones. This cell is housed inside an electric furnace with three independent heating resistances that accurately control the working temperature during experiments along the axial direction. The feed stream can be properly adjusted by several Bronkhorst Hi-Tech mass-flow controllers mounted in H2, N2, and CO2 inlet lines. Permeate or retentate flow-rates were measured by using a drum-type gas flow-meter Ritter TG 05/5 with an accuracy of ±0.5% (minimum detection limit of around 17 mL min−1). In case of reaching very low fluxes for any retentate of permeate streams, this equipment was replaced by a Ritter Mili-GasCounter able to detecting volumetric flow-rates from 1.67·10−2 mL min−1. On the other hand, the operating pressure is controlled by a Bronkhorst Hi-Tech EL-PRESS back-pressure regulator (0–10 bar), whereas the permeate stream is always maintained at atmospheric conditions. Finally, the equipment is also equipped with a gas chromatograph (GC) Varian CP-4900 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two analytical Molsieve 5 Å and PoraPLOT-Q columns. The standard procedure followed in permeation tests includes some preliminary bubble leak tests to ensure the absence of defects in the composite membranes before being placed inside the permeation cell. For that, each membrane is first sealed with appropriate O-rings and immersed into ethanol, where helium is fed to the lumen side up to reach at least 3 bar while maintaining the retentate stream completely closed. In this manner, helium molecules only can pass through eventual defects on the palladium film. Only membranes in which no bubbles are detected during this preliminary test and the selected pressure is maintained for at least 30 min are mounted in the previously described permeation setup for testing at higher temperatures. After that, a series of single gas permeation experiments with both pure nitrogen and hydrogen were carried out at different temperatures in the range 350–450 °C and pressure differences between retentate and permeate sides up to 2.0 bar. From these experimental data, both permeance and ideal hydrogen separation factor (αH2/N2) can be determined. Additionally, it should be noted that five thermal cycles were also performed with the aim to ensure both mechanical and thermal resistance of the membrane against temperature cyclic variations and stability of permeate measurements. Moreover, a stabilization period of at least 2 h for each membrane was considered when hydrogen was fed for the first time. Later, binary mixtures containing 80 vol% of hydrogen balanced with nitrogen or carbon dioxide were also studied at a constant temperature (400 °C) to evaluate possible concentration-polarization or inhibition effects. In this way, the potential contribution of the concentration-polarization effect was evaluated when working with binary mixtures containing certainly inert species such as nitrogen, being possible to determine a general Concentration Polarization Coefficient (CPC) accordingly to the previous publication of Bellini et al. [58] and described here as Eq. (1). The combined contribution of both concentration-polarization and inhibition effects can be evaluated by permeation tests conducted with any other binary mixture containing species with a certain inhibition contribution. From these tests, the overall Permeation Reduction Coefficient (PRC) can be calculated by Eq. (2). Then, it could be possible to evaluate the Inhibition Coefficient (IC) caused by any molecule from its definition based on previous CPC and PRC coefficients, shown in Eq. (3), as previously also suggested by Bellini et al. [58]. At this point, it should be mentioned that the present study has been focused on the specific contribution of carbon dioxide on the above-mentioned parameters, with a great influence on the permeation capacity of other previously published ELP-PP membranes, most of them with a thicker Pd-film and diverse materials as an intermediate layer.

4,Reaction tests,"2.3 Reaction tests As previously addressed, both membrane permeation and reaction tests were performed by using the same experimental setup described in the previous section (Fig. 1). However, it is necessary to add some additional descriptions in this section to complete the given information. Beside the inlet gas-flow settled by the previously indicated Bronkhorst mass-flow controllers, also a liquid feed can be introduced into the system by a Gilson 307 HPLC pump. The liquid is pumped to a simple electrical furnace, where it is evaporated and mixed with other gases introduced to the setup. Particularly, this system was used to feed a mixture of reagents for the reaction tests performed in the present study, steam reforming, consisting of acetic acid (AA, Scharlau, ≥99.7%) diluted in distilled water (n H2O /n AA = 4) that simulates a simplified synthetic stream coming from micro-algae liquefaction [10,11,42,43]. The evaporated liquid was always mixed with small amounts of nitrogen to facilitate the composition analysis of outlet streams and to ensure an accurate calculation of the mass-balance. Moreover, the experimental setup also contains a cold-trap on the outer retentate stream intending to condensate any possible excess of the acetic acid solution in water and certain possible liquid sub-products such as alcohols or acetone. The composition of the condensate fraction collected in the cold-trap was later analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (Varian CP-3900 chromatograph equipped with a CP-WAX 52 CB column and flame ionization detector). For all these tests, around 1.0 g of a home-made Ni/SBA-15 catalyst containing 13.5 wt% of nickel was introduced into the lumen of the reactor. Complete details about its general synthesis procedure and performance in powder for different steam reforming reactions can be found in previous publications [11,43]. However, its total BET surface and pore volume of around 521 m2 and 0.77 m3 g−1, respectively, as well as average pore diameters in the range 8.3–10.6 nm, can be here emphasized as main physical properties. In this work, the catalyst was pelletized into small cylinders of around 2 × 5 mm containing a 70 wt% of Ni/SBA-15 material and 30 w.% clays, being mixed with quartz spheres in order to fill in the entire lumen space available into the reactor (around 5.5 cm3). Two types of reaction experiments were performed, distinguishing those carried out in a conventional packed-bed reactor (PBR) with the catalyst inside a dense 316 L SS tube from tests in which the SS tube is replaced by the ELP-PP Pd-based membrane, thus working with a membrane reactor configuration (PBMR) as illustrating in Fig. 2 . For the second option, in which a PBMR configuration is adopted, it should be noted that direct contact between palladium film and catalyst pellets is always avoided due to the presence of both wall of the PSS support and CeO2 intermediate layer. Moreover, a possible contribution of the Pd-film to the overall catalytic activity of chemical reactions has been dismissed due to the negligible conversion reached in blank tests carried out in the absence of the catalyst. Anyway, a similar procedure was adopted in both cases to study the influence of some important operating conditions such as temperature (T = 400–450 °C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = 2500–4500 h−1), or feed pressure (P = 1–4 bar). First, heating-up and cooling-down steps were always performed in nitrogen atmosphere to avoid any possible oxidation of the catalyst or the membrane (in case of working as PBMR). However, it should be noted that fresh catalyst was always treated by flowing hydrogen (QH2 = 50 NmL min−1) at 450 °C for 2 h before to initiate any set of reactions to ensure a complete reduction of the nickel particles dispersed on the bulk SBA-15. Later, each operating condition was properly adjusted into the desired values, and the reaction test was extended for 60 min with continuous monitoring of gas composition in outlet streams to ensure reaching a steady-state. During this period, diverse samples were taken from both gas and liquid outer streams and analyzed by chromatography. Here, it is important to highlight that not only fresh catalyst was used for all the above-mentioned experiments, and also its regeneration was considered. If assuming a possible catalyst deactivation and system blockage by coke formation, H2 decrease in the product stream and a non-controlled pressure increase in the lumen side should be observed during experiments. For those cases, 100 NmL min−1 of compressed air were flushed for at least 1 h into the reactor at 450 °C to enhance the coke gasification and the consequent recovery of catalytic activity. This fact has been noted in the present study by marking the catalyst as “fresh” or “regenerated”. An identical procedure was followed to work as PBMR, but using 200 NmL min−1 of nitrogen as sweep gas in the permeate stream to improve the overall pressure driving force for H2 permeation through the membrane. In both cases, PBR and PBMR, the progress of the acetic acid steam reforming was monitored by calculation of acetic acid conversion(x AA ), hydrogen yield (Y H2) and product selectivity (S i ) as follows: (4) x AA = n AA , in − n AA , out n AA , in (5) Y H 2 = n H 2 4 ∙ n AA , in (6) S i = n i ∑ j = 1 n n j where n AA, in and n AA, out show the acetic acid molar flow-rate fed into the system or collected in the cold-trap, respectively, and n H2 the hydrogen produced during the reaction. Subscripts i and j represent each generic product obtained throughout the experiment taking into account all species identified by chromatography analyses except reagents (acetic acid and water). In the case of analyzing the results obtained in PBMR configuration, two additional parameters were also considered to determine the hydrogen recovered from the total produced in the reactor (Recovery Factor, RF) and the recovered one from the maximum amount that theoretically is possible to produce accordingly to the stoichiometry of chemical reaction (Recovery Yield, RY). Both parameters are defined by expressions given in Eqs. (7) and (8) as follows: (7) RF = n H 2 , p n H 2 , TOT = n H 2 , p n H 2 , ret + n H 2 , p (8) RY = n H 2 , p n H 2 theory = n H 2 , p 4 ∙ n AA , in In addition to all these experimental and calculated data, theoretical values about the thermodynamic chemical equilibrium were also determined by the minimization of the Gibbs free-energy with the help of ASPEN-HYSYS software. The property method used for the simulation was Redlich-Kwong-Soave (SRK), which provide suitable solutions for most gas mixtures, where the polarity of compounds is not noticeably strong."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Membrane morphology,"3.1 Membrane morphology Fig. 3 shows the external morphology of one typical membrane reached after scaling-up the synthesis procedure published elsewhere [56], in which the palladium film was coated by ELP-PP onto a larger tubular PSS support (total length of 110 mm) modified with an intermediate layer formed by CeO2 particles previously doped with Pd nuclei. The characteristic morphology of other ELP-PP membranes was reached despite the larger dimension of the supports. In fact, a continuous Pd top film with a certain cavernous structure can be observed in the SEM image (Fig. 3a), not detecting significant differences in the axial direction. The average thickness for this Pd-film has been estimated into around 15 μm from gravimetric analyses, slightly thicker than the reached one for similar membranes prepared onto shorter supports up to 3 cm in length (8–12 μm) [56]. The average external roughness obtained from an optical profiler (Fig. 3b) also increased by around 15% respect to the previously published membrane, reaching a value of Ra = 3.451 ± 0.47 μm. Nevertheless, this value is still noticeably smaller than the provided one by the raw PSS support, with a starting external roughness around Ra = 5.082 ± 0.40 μm."
7,Permeation behavior with pure gases,"3.2 Permeation behavior with pure gases As previously indicated in the experimental section, preliminary bubble-leak tests with helium in ethanol at room temperature were performed to guarantee the absence of defects in the Pd-film of the membranes collected in this work. After ensuring this fact, a series of single gas permeation experiments with both pure nitrogen and hydrogen was carried out at temperatures in the range 350–450 °C and pressure driving forces up to 2.0 bar, always avoiding the use of any sweep gas for collecting the permeate stream. First, it is important to highlight that the analyzed ELP-PP membrane was completely impermeable to nitrogen for the entire set of experiments, since no nitrogen flux was detected in the permeate side at any operating condition of temperature and pressure. Therefore, the initial quality of the Pd film was maintained at higher temperatures and an eventually complete ideal separation factor to hydrogen (αH2/N2) could be assumed for all the analyzed conditions. Particular data reached for the entire set of permeation experiments carried out with pure H2 are collected in Fig. 4 , where the permeate flux (J p ) for each pressure driving force (P r 0.5 -P p 0.5 ) is represented at diverse temperatures in the range 350–450 °C. As can be seen, a higher permeate flux is reached for increasing values of pressure and temperature, as usually predicts the available literature [58–60]. A clear linear trend reasonably fitting into the origin between permeate fluxes and pressure driving forces for each series of experimental data was also observed for the entire range of temperatures, as predicted by the well-known Sieverts' law for H2 permeation through Pd-based membranes [61,62]. This fact implies H2 permeances in the range of 4.49–5.67·10−4 mol m−2 s−1 Pa-0.5 and activation energy of 8.59 kJ mol−1, which agree with typical performances of other composite Pd-based membranes found in the literature [53,63]. These values and trends are consistent with the solution-diffusion model of permeation through a Pd-membrane when the rate-determining step is the H2 diffusion throughout a dense and defect-free metallic film. However, it should be noted that the particular permeation behavior previously reported for many other ELP-PP membranes and widely discussed in previous works [53,56,64], in which the Sieverts' linear fit does not intercept in the origin, does not appear for this time. Although some experimental data taken at lower pressures slightly deviate for the general trend, the linearity maintains a really high correlation factor (R ≥ 0.999), so the above-mentioned effect can be considered negligible. This fact could be explained by the larger axial dimension of the membrane respect to most of the previously reported ones [55–57,64], which requires a slight modification of the synthesis conditions in terms of volume ratio between Pd source and reducing agent solutions. This fact could affect the Pd penetration inside the pores of the supports, responsible for the above-mentioned deviation in shorter membranes. All these previous results also suggest a good mechanical stability of the membrane after being tested at different pressures and temperatures, especially considering the used permeation mode in which the highest pressure always remains in the lumen and the lowest one on the shell side. It forces the permeation direction from the inner to the outer side of the tubular membrane, where the Pd film is placed, thus generating tensile stresses that could derive into delamination or cracks generation. However, five additional thermal cycles from room temperature up to 400 °C were also performed in order to reinforce this term about the stability of both membrane integrity and permeation measurements. It can be emphasized that only a slight variation below 2% in the permeate fluxes reached for each thermal cycle was obtained, thus demonstrating the good anchoring between support and palladium film and no generation of cracks or pinholes."
8,Permeation behavior with binary gas mixtures,"3.3 Permeation behavior with binary gas mixtures It is well-known that working with gas mixtures in Pd-based membranes usually produces a noticeable decay in the hydrogen permeation capacity of these systems. Particularly, the presence of several molecules containing carbon atoms in the gas mixture, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or light hydrocarbons, significantly decreases the permeate flux, as it is widely reported in the literature [58,65,66]. Despite a typical higher inhibition effect of carbon monoxide for most of the studies [67–70], ELP-PP membranes exhibited a peculiar behavior, mostly affected by carbon dioxide [63,71]. Due to this fact and the significant improvement on the quality of ELP-PP membranes during last years, especially taking into account those prepared onto modified PSS supports with CeO2 intermediate layers [55,56], this section has been focused on the particular behavior of these membranes in the presence of mixtures containing nitrogen or carbon dioxide. First, it should be noted that the quality of the tested membrane in terms of H2 selectivity was maintained for the entire set of experiments collected in this section since neither nitrogen nor carbon dioxide was found in permeate streams through GC analyses. Thus, all permeate fluxes reached in the present section are composed only by pure hydrogen. Moreover, additional experiments with pure gases were also performed after operating with the gas mixtures, maintaining the good properties of the membrane addressed in the last section, especially those related to the almost complete H2 selectivity up to the available detection limit of the equipment. Fig. 5 collects the results about the permeation behavior of the membrane with binary mixtures containing 20 vol% of nitrogen or carbon dioxide balanced in hydrogen. All experiments were carried out at 400 °C and pressure differences between retentate and permeate sides in the range 0.4–2.0 bar. Permeate fluxes reached at each particular condition are shown in Fig. 5a, obtaining a clear decrease of H2 permeate flux in comparison to previous tests performed with pure H2 at similar conditions, as well as a marked deviation from the linear relationship between permeate and pressure driving forces. Moreover, a more pronounced decrease was obtained for the permeate flux in case of feeding a mixture containing carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen. A certain dilution effect is always present when working with gas mixtures, thus decreasing the total pressure driving force for the permeation process with greater intensity as the hydrogen concentration in the feed stream decrease and, hence, the permeate flux through the membrane. This unavoidable fact has been taken into account in the calculation of the pressure driving force by considering hydrogen partial pressures for both retentate and permeate sides, so the observed permeate flux decay should be caused by other different reasons. In this context, other authors explain similar behaviors by competitive adsorption between hydrogen and other molecules present in the feed mixture to reach the palladium surface (concentration-polarization effect) or deactivation of the membrane due to inhibition processes caused by particular compounds [58]. Fig. 5b tries to elucidate the particular contribution of these effects for experiments carried out in the present study by calculating and depicting separately CPC, PRC, and IC coefficients, previously described in the experimental section, at each particular pressure driving force. First, the concentration-polarization effect (CPC) caused by any totally inert molecule with no inhibition effect has been evaluated using experiments in which a binary mixture H2-N2 is fed to the membrane. As can be seen, CPC progressively increases in the range of 0.39–0.65 for pressure driving forces higher than 65 Pa0.5. In fact, the higher the pressure, the higher the permeating flux and, hence, the lower the hydrogen concentration in the retentate outlet. Moreover, the diffusivity of molecules in the gas phase decreases for increasing pressure values. These issues clearly turn the external mass transfer of hydrogen molecules to the palladium surface more difficult, thus increasing the value of the CPC [72,73]. However, a noticeably lower CPC value of only around 0.08 was obtained for P H2,r 0.5 - P H2,p 0.5 = 21.6 Pa0.5. This fact suggests that the above-mentioned increase of the concentration-polarization effect is greater for relatively low pressure values, while a progressive stabilization around a certain value seems to reach at higher pressures. By replacing nitrogen by carbon dioxide in the feed mixture, it is possible to determine the overall permeation reduction coefficient, PRC, which involves both possible concentration-polarization and inhibition effects. Even though carbon dioxide is considered as a very inert molecule, the results evidence a certain inhibition effect because of PRC values, ranged from 0.52 to 0.73, always exceed the previously calculated CPC ones. Anyway, a similar global trend is observed for both CPC and PRC, increasing their values as the pressure does, but predicting a certain stabilization for the highest pressures. From these values, it is possible to quantify the inhibition effect of carbon dioxide for permeation through an ELP-PP membrane, reaching values for IC from 0.08 to 0.44. It should be noted that the inhibition coefficient follows a different trend to coefficients previously addressed, CPC and PRC, thus decreasing its contribution for higher pressures. In this manner, almost the total decay of H2 permeability for the analyzed ELP-PP membrane at pressure driving forces below P H2,r 0.5 - P H2,p 0.5 = 50 Pa0.5 is caused by a marked inhibition effect of carbon dioxide, instead of the typical concentration-polarization effect reported for working with gas mixtures containing inert membranes. This insight is very useful for designin permeation devices that include ELP-PP membranes and selecting the best operating conditions to maximize their performance. At this point, it is necessary to remember the great influence of this compound for H2 permeation through ELP-PP membranes described in our previous study [71]. It is provoked by the particular distribution of palladium between the external surface of the membrane and inside the pores of the support, thus generating a certain tortuosity that affects the mass transfer differently for diverse gas molecules. On the contrary, a decrease in H2 permeation reached at higher pressures is mainly governed by the concentration-polarization effect."
9,Reaction tests: acetic acid steam reforming,"3.4 Reaction tests: acetic acid steam reforming An ELP-PP membrane containing an external Pd film with an estimated thickness around 15 μm, previously analyzed in terms of permeability, was also used to perform some reaction tests in a packed-bed membrane reactor to evaluate its resistance and potential benefits for the steam reforming of acetic acid. The feed used for the reaction consists of a mixture of acetic acid in water (n H2O /n AA = 4), thus simulating a simplified synthetic stream coming from micro-algae liquefaction [10,11,42,43]. Even though steam reforming of light hydrocarbons such as methane or alcohols in both conventional packed-bed or membrane reactors has been widely investigated by many authors in last years [16–19], literature addressing the use of acetic acid or the aqueous phase coming from bio-oil production techniques is still under investigation, as discussed in the introduction section. However, it is widely accepted in all cases that the overall equilibrium for any steam reforming (SR) results from combining multiple reactions between all compounds involved in the process. Therefore, together with the main SR reaction, many other reactions, such as water gas shift (WGS), methanation (MTN), or thermal decomposition of compounds (TD), may also take place. Moreover, especially in case of using supported catalysts, ketonization reactions to form coke precursors (i.e. acetone) or directly coke by Bouduard reaction or reverse carbon gasification (RCG) would also be possible. In this context, Table 1 collects important information about all these possible chemical reactions involved in the steam reforming of acetic acid considered for the present study to facilitate the interpretation of the experimental results. This information includes a description of each chemical reaction, its enthalpy (ΔH, kJ mol−1), and the variation in moles between products and reactants (Δn). 3.4.1 Influence of temperature First, the temperature effect on AASR in a conventional PBR working with a fresh catalyst at P = 1.0 bar and GHSV = 4500 h−1 was analyzed for the range 400–450 °C. Both experimental and calculated thermodynamic equilibrium data by ASPEN-HYSYS for the conversion of acetic acid, hydrogen yield and product selectivity are collected in Fig. 6 . According to the thermodynamic predictions, AASR is entirely feasible from a thermodynamic point of view, and a complete conversion for acetic acid can be reached at the entire range of evaluated temperatures (Fig. 6a). However, a limited experimental conversion below the predicted data was obtained due to kinetic effects. Both conversion values, experimental and predicted ones, becomes progressively closer at higher temperatures because of the increasing kinetics constants by an Arrhenius-type dependence. Similar behavior can be found in Fig. 6b while analyzing the hydrogen yield. Among the wide number of reactions involved into the process, as previously discussed in Table 1, Steam Reforming and Thermal Decomposition are probably affected in a greater grade by temperature due to their endothermic character and higher enthalpy, thus playing an important role for controlling both acetic acid conversion and hydrogen yield inside the reactor. Additionally, the selectivity to diverse products was also addressed in the present study, collecting the reached experimental data in Fig. 6c. In this context, it should be mentioned that thermodynamic equilibrium calculations from ASPEN-HYSYS software only reflect hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as products. However, the analysis of condensates during real experiments evidenced an incomplete conversion of acetic acid, and the formation of various by-products such as acetone and coke. Due to the above-mentioned discrepancy and the interest in analyzing the real behavior inside a reactor containing a heterogeneous catalyst, thus affected by both thermodynamics and kinetics, only experimental data are collected in Fig. 6c. As can be seen, on the contrary of previous parameters, selectivity towards hydrogen remains almost constant within the entire range of temperatures under evaluation, being possible to explain by the synergy between AASR and WGS reactions. Higher temperatures increase H2 production by AASR but affect WGS and vice-versa, thus maintaining a certainly stable amount of hydrogen in the outlet stream. At lower temperatures, carbon monoxide production is mainly controlled by WGS, as confirmed by the marked drop in its selectivity. However, CO production could also be favored by Thermal Decomposition (strongly endothermic) and Dehydration to form ketene and its further Steam Reforming. Selectivity to acetone does not appear to be significant even at higher temperatures, where the ketonization reaction (slightly endothermic) could become relevant. However, coke formation seems to play a decisive role in the reaction pathway. In fact, Boudouard and reverse carbon gasification, along with acetone polymerization, prevailed at lower temperatures, leading to a vast quantity of coke in terms of selectivity (around 14% at T = 400 °C). Furthermore, in compliance with exothermic Methanation reactions, a reasonable selectivity towards methane (nearly 7% at T = 400 °C) was found at these conditions of relatively low temperatures. To minimize the formation of methane and particularly coke during further experiments, thus retarding a possible catalyst deactivation, membrane fouling, and blockage of the system, the highest temperature of 450 °C was selected to continue the present study. 3.4.2 Influence of space velocity Later, similar analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) between 2500 and 4500 h−1 on the system, showing the main reached results in Fig. 7 . These experiments were also carried out in a conventional PBR working at fixed T = 450 °C and P = 1.0 bar but including for the first time in this study the use of fresh and regenerated catalysts. As expected, a slight decrease in both experimental acetic acid conversion (Fig. 7a) and hydrogen yield (Fig. 7b) were obtained for increasing values of the gas hourly space velocity due to the shorter contact time between reactants and catalyst. This behavior is not obtained for simulated data because they only come from calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium. Attending to the products selectivity shown in Fig. 7c, the negative effect of increasing GHSV on hydrogen production is evident, even in a greater grade, being explained by a lower contribution to the WGS on the overall process, thus obtaining a considerable increasing amount of CO, also coming from reverse Methanation. In all these cases, better reaction performances were achieved for all tests carried out using a fresh catalyst instead of a regenerated one, although with differences below 10% for the entire set of experiments. In general, lower acetic acid conversion, hydrogen yield, and hydrogen selectivity can be found using a regenerated catalyst, while coke formation starts being slightly higher. The opposite trend between hydrogen and carbon monoxide appears to be fairly noticeable, especially when a new catalyst is employed. At this point, it is also necessary to note that the overall performance reached by the regenerated catalyst seems to be closer to the data collected with a fresh catalyst for increasing values of GHSV. For this reason, a GHSV = 4500 h−1 has been selected to proceed with the study and evaluate the pressure effect in both PBR and PBMR configurations, where a continuous replacement of the catalyst by a fresh one for each new experiments becomes unpractical for any potential industrial application. 3.4.3 Influence of pressure Fig. 8 compares all results for reactions reached at constant operating conditions of T = 450 °C and GHSV = 4500 h−1 by using a different catalyst status (fresh or regenerated) and pressures in the range 1.0–3.0 bar for the two different reactor setups: PBR and PBMR containing the ELP-PP Pd-composite membrane. A quite evident decrease in the reaction extent occurs as the reaction pressure increases in PBR configuration, without any H2 separation, since lower acetic acid conversion and hydrogen yield were found, as depicted in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. In fact, Steam Reforming and Thermal Decomposition reactions are the most affected ones by the pressure due to the biggest increase in moles between products and reactants (∆n = + 3). Comparing the results reached in both PBR and PBMR configurations, it is clear the equilibrium displacement reached by the in-situ permeation of hydrogen through the membrane with an increase up to 15% in the acetic acid conversion (Fig. 8a). In fact, it is well-known that the direct reaction rate could be promoted by selectively removing a product from the reaction system, thus reducing, as a consequence, the reaction rate of the reverse reaction at the same operating conditions [47,74]. This is one of the main advantages of working with membrane reactors together with the extraction of hydrogen with an ultra-high purity in a unique operation [14,46,75]. Thus, a higher conversion might be reached while maintaining a constant operating temperature, just as occurring in the present case. However, the permeation effect could not totally overcome the thermodynamic restrictions in the experimental conditions used. In this manner, their negative impact over the thermodynamic of the overall AASR process, as previously addressed in PBR experiments, prevails against the membrane effect despite higher pressures clearly promote increasing hydrogen permeation flow-rates. The membrane shift effect over the process is also evidenced in Fig. 8b, where a significant improvement on the hydrogen yield can be observed replacing the conventional PBR configuration by the PBMR, even overcoming the predicted values by the equilibrium for some particular conditions. This fact suggests that marked differences in product selectivity are generated when a continuous extraction of hydrogen through a highly-selective membrane is combined with a catalyst in a PBMR, as later will be discussed. Once again, it is important to emphasize that slightly lower performances were always reached when employing a regenerated catalyst. However, this difference is not so clear in the case of operating in PBMR. A more detailed analysis is required to explain the results reached in product selectivity for both PBR and PBMR systems when operating with fresh and regenerated catalysts at diverse pressures. These experimental data are shown from Fig. 8c to f. In this context, a marked selectivity towards hydrogen was reached for all cases, although appreciable amounts of coke were also detected. In fact, hydrogen was the main product of chemical reactions involved in catalytic AASR in terms of selectivity, with values ranged from 35 to 45%, being followed by carbon dioxide. The impact of reaction pressure over coke formation becomes clear in good agreement with Bouduard reaction and reverse carbon gasification. Thus, this effect becomes fairly evident as increasing the pressure on the reaction side. In fact, excluding the presence of a solid phase due to the coke formation, both chemical reactions involve a reduction in the total number of moles, and then higher pressures push the thermodynamic equilibrium forward. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that, besides Boudouard and RCG reactions, coke formation is the result of a complicated network of side-reactions involved in the general AASR scheme. Acetic acid is particularly favorable towards self- and intra-molecular ketonization. In general, catalytic supports with marked acidity might be harmful to the steam reforming reaction, since acidic sites would prone certain dehydration process, throughout acetone could be formed. This compound usually acts as a coke precursor via ketonization instead of being converted into hydrogen via steam reforming, causing additional catalyst deactivation [32]. However, some recent studies [76] have demonstrated that materials with marked basicity, just as occurring with supported catalyst onto SBA-15, could also favor ketonization processes. In this manner, AA ketonization to form acetone may initiate a series of transformations that would cause the formation of oligomers and, eventually, coke. This route can only be minimized by working at temperatures above 600 °C, where the reforming reactions are dominant, although the use of these operating conditions in a PBMR could negatively affect the integrity of the Pd-based membrane [51]. However, despite the above-mentioned trend, experiments carried out in PBR with regenerated catalysts (Fig. 8d) exhibit strange behavior, obtaining an unusual presence of acetone for the highest pressure conditions. The minimum amount of methane reached during these experiments could be caused by the mitigation of both methanation, expected up to 600 °C, and decarboxylation processes. On the other hand, it is well-known that interactions between nickel (employed as active metal into the catalyst used in the present study) and its support (in this case, SBA-15) could limit methanation reactions while increasing the selectivity towards hydrogen [76], thus justifying the observed general behavior of the entire set of experiments. Analyzing in-depth the results reached in a PBMR, a certainly similar behavior to the above-mentioned ones reached for PBR working with fresh catalysts is observed, as it can be noticed by comparing Fig. 8c and e. However, in case of considering the use of a regenerated catalyst (Fig. 8d and f), a higher selectivity towards coke was obtained for PBMR configuration, which leads to around 30% for the most elevated pressure under investigation. In this context, the presence of acetone, generated via AA ketonization, and its equilibrium with incoming oligomerization and further polymerization, plays an important role in developing the reaction with a progressively stronger impact at higher pressures. Thus, the clear decrease in selectivity towards both hydrogen and carbon dioxide, which can be appreciably seen at high pressures, might thereby suggest the strong action of competitive ketonization at the expense of acetic acid steam reforming and thermal decomposition. Finally, Recovery Factor (RF) and Recovery Yield (RY) for the membrane used in all the above-mentioned PBMR-AASR experiments are shown in Fig. 9 as a function of reaction pressure and catalyst status. A pronounced decrease of RF from 0.25 to 0.09 was reached for increasing pressures in case of using a fresh catalyst (Fig. 9a), while quite similar results but decreasing in the range 0.06–0.01 were also reached in case of evaluating RY at identical conditions (Fig. 9b). This trend seems to be contrary to conventional membrane performances, in which higher pressures usually provoke an increase of the permeate flow-rate. However, here it should also be taken into account all the previous results of this study, where the higher the pressure, the lower the hydrogen yield and, thus, the available hydrogen amount to be permeated through the membrane. Therefore, the kinetic effect appears to be predominant against the thermodynamic equilibrium displacement potentially reached by the membrane shift effect at evaluated conditions."
10,Conclusions,"New composite Pd-membranes onto PSS, including an intermediate layer of CeO2 particles doped with Pd nuclei, were successfully obtained after scaling-up the total length of tubular supports up to 110 mm. No marked differences along the axial direction were found on the top Pd film, with an estimated thickness of around 15 μm and average roughness of 3.451 ± 0.47 μm. H2 permeances in the range of 4.49–5.67·10−4 mol m−2 s−1 Pa-0.5 with an activation energy of 8.59 kJ mol−1 were reached in permeation experiments with pure H2 at temperatures between 350 and 450 °C. The use of gas binary mixtures with N2 or CO2 in these tests revealed a noticeable decrease of permeate flux, mainly caused by concentration-polarization at higher pressure driving forces. However, a significant contribution of inhibition caused by CO2 has also been found for pressure driving forces below 50 Pa0.5. These membranes were subsequently combined with pelletized Ni/SBA-15 catalysts in a membrane reactor to produce hydrogen by acetic acid steam reforming. This particular feedstock was selected as a model component of a synthetic aqueous fraction generated in most hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae to produce bio-oil. Temperature and GHSV were evaluated in a traditional PBR with both fresh and regenerated catalysts, to select the most appropriate conditions for the operation with the membrane. Later, a comparison between the theoretical equilibrium and the experimental data reached at PBR/MR configurations was established for multiple tests carried out with both fresh and regenerated catalysts, but pressures ranged from 1 to 3 bar. In all cases, both overall conversion of acetic acid and hydrogen yield were increased in a similar grade due to the shift effect on equilibrium reactions caused by hydrogen permeation through the membrane contained in the MR in comparison to the PBR configuration. A very similar product distribution was obtained for each case when working with fresh catalysts, but marked deviations were found in case of regenerating the catalysts. At these conditions, higher selectivity towards coke was obtained for PBMR configuration, which leads to around 30% for the most elevated pressure under investigation. Here, it should be emphasized that the mechanical integrity of the ELP-PP membrane resisted in a good grade during all the experiments, thus demonstrating its strength to be used in real MR applications. Finally, additional experiments are suggested to complete the present study and to optimize the MR operating conditions to reach higher RF and RY."
