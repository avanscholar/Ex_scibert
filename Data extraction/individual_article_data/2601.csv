0,Introduction,"Lignin is one of the critical components of lignocellulosic biomass. Unfortunately, it is severely wasted as the by-product in the beginning of the commercial operation of alkaline pulp technology (Chakar and Ragauskas, 2004). However, as a result of the unique three-dimensional amorphous polymerization structure of aromatic rings, the depolymerization of lignin into value-added aromatics has become a hotspot gradually in the current studies (Gosselink et al., 2004). The technologies of sub- or supercritical fluid have been commonly applied in catalyzed depolymerization of lignin (Nguyen et al., 2014; Warner et al., 2014). The difference of the hydrogen supplying ability makes the alcohol system more favorable than water for the promotion of lignin fragmentation and inhabitation of residues (Azadi et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014). Narani et al. (2015) reported that kraft lignin could be transformed into alkylphenolics in supercritical methanol. Ma et al. (2014) proposed the complete ethanolysis of kraft lignin into high-value small-molecular chemicals. Wang and Rinaldi (2012a,b) described that isopropanol could be used as an H-transfer initiator to obtain the aromatics. However, the realistic problem is that the aromatic product composition is complex by supercritical alcohol treatments. Typically, the hydrogenation cyclics are usually obtained from the aromatic rings over the common noble metal-based catalysts (Bengoecheaa et al., 2015; Wildschut et al., 2009). In addition, less aromatic alcohols appear together with more phenols when aromatic rings are not hydrogenated over mixed metal oxides catalyst (Huang et al., 2015; Schimming et al., 2015a). Aromatic alcohols are an important intermediates in the synthesis of drugs and fragrances, but studies on the improvement of its yield and selectivity obtained from lignin depolymerization are fairly rare. The other problem is that an excess H2 supply (35–300bar) is usually required because H2 originating from alcohol system is still not enough for the hydrodeoxygenation of liquid oil (Saidi et al., 2014). In the other words, the increasing content of hydrogen in the gas products helps to reduce or counteract the H2 supply. Not only that, more generated H2-rich gas can be used as a clean energy source (Chhiti et al., 2011; Marquevich et al., 1999). However, a great effort has been devoted to the study of liquid products for many years, and gas products are shelved, no in-depth exploration. In order to solve these problems, the multi-functional La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2-supported Rh catalyst was synthesized. The support with oxygen vacancies was conducive to the activation of the CO bonds in organic oxygenates so as to achieve the purpose of hydrodeoxygenation (Schimming et al., 2015a, 2015b; Shetty et al., 2015; Prasomsri et al., 2013). More than that, CeO2–ZrO2 modified by small amounts of La2O3 had an excellent stability (Lemonidou et al., 2013) and resistance for coking in reforming reaction (Deng et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2016). These advantages were the reasons for choosing this kind of modified support. The loading of noble metal Rh was a nice choice for hydrodeoxygenation of lignin depolymerization (Yang et al., 2016). In addition, Lemonidou et al. (2013) also figured that the introduction of Rh facilitated decrease of the temperature of producing H2. As a consequence, this versatile supported catalyst Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 was applied to catalyze the degradation of lignin in supercritical system. Firstly, it catalyzed lignin completely liquefied to more aromatic monomers with less char formation. Secondly, the removal of phenolic hydroxyl group was promoted and high selectivity to aromatic alcohols was realized, in which there was no aromatic ring hydrogenation. Lastly, more H2 was produced during the catalytic process, which made the in-situ hydrogenation of liquid oil takes place and reduced the excess hydrogen supply. High-yield and high-selectivity of aromatic alcohols and H2 were realized simultaneously. The stability of the catalyst was investigated firstly in supercritical system by the recycling test of the catalyst and the interaction relationship among catalyst deactivation, liquid and gaseous product distribution was proposed. In addition, the catalytic activity was checked in other common supercritical solvents."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The kraft lignin used in this work was provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The samples were dried overnight at 100°C before use. AR reagent grade solvents and chemicals including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dichloromethane, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-cresol, n-dodecane, ethyl hexanoate and hexyl alcohol were also purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate, zirconyl (IV) oxynitrate hydrate, Lanthanum (III) nitrate hydrate, Rhodium (III) chloride and ammonium hydroxide (28–30% NH3 content) were purchased from Aladdin. Standard gases were purchased from Maotoogas equipments (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. All reagents were used as received."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The catalyst preparation was based on the investigation of the literatures, but a large number of improvements were made in order to obtain a better catalytic performance. All supports were prepared by coprecipitation of the precursors (Schimming et al., 2015b). Cerium nitrate hexahydrate and zirconyl oxynitrate hydrate were dissolved in deionized water and 0.1M solution was dropped slowly into an aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution while stirring continuously. The solvent was adjusted to pH 10 in the whole process. The final precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried in the oven overnight at 120°C. Obtained solids were calcined at 800°C for 4h. The calcined material with a composition CeO2/ZrO2 =15/85 (wt) was used as the support. The wet impregnation method was applied for the addition of metal (Lemonidou et al., 2013). The support was modified by impregnating in an aqueous solution of La(NO3)3 followed by the removal of water in rotary evaporation. The material was dried overnight at 120°C and then calcined in air at 400°C for 2h. The modified support was impregnated with the aqueous solution of RhCl3 following the procedure described for La(NO3)3. The final material contained 3wt% La and 2wt% Rh. Before the lignin depolymerization experiments, the catalyst was reduced at 750°C for 1h in 25vol% H2/N2 flow."
4,Catalyst characterization,2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation from 10 to 90° with a scan speed 60° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Philips XL 30 microscope operating at 30kV. Transmitting electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL 2100F instrument operating at 30kV. Inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements were performed on the Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300 instrument.
5,Catalytic depolymerization of kraft lignin,"2.4 Catalytic depolymerization of kraft lignin Lignin hydrocracking was performed in a high-pressure and corrosion-resistant autoclave with 30ml volume. The reactor equipped with a temperature controller and a pressure sensor. In the typical run, kraft lignin, catalyst and solvent were loaded into the reactor. Then, the sealed autoclave was heated to the specified temperatures and kept for the desired residence time. After the heating, the reactor was immersed into a cold water bath for about 5min to quench the reaction and then the reactor was opened and the gas was collected for the compositional analysis. The reaction mixture was extracted several times with 100ml dichloromethane. The extraction was next filtrated and the filtrate was rotary evaporated at a reduced pressure (35°C and 1bar for at least 30min) to remove the dichloromethane and the unreacted solvents. Liquid products were obtained and weighted. The brown colored semi-liquid product was defined as bio-oil. The filtrate residue (char) was weighted after dried overnight in 120°C. Due to the volatility of some light ends, the bio-oil yields somewhat decreased during the solvent vaporization process. The lignin conversion (X) was determined by the amount of the char that was filtrate residue without catalyst (Eq. (1)). The bio-oil/char yield (Y) was measured as the mass of remaining oil/char divided by the weight of kraft lignin loaded into the reactor (Eq. (2)/(3)). To evaluate the catalyst performance, the selectivity to a product gas (Sx) was determined by Eq. (4). (1) X lignin ( wt% ) = 100 - weight of residues - weight of the catalyst weight of the parent lignin ∗ 100 (2) Y bio - oil ( wt% ) = weight of semi liquid weight of the parent lignin ∗ 100 (3) Y char ( wt% ) = weight of char weight of the parent lignin ∗ 100 (4) S X = volume of gas x in gaseous product stream Total volumes of all gases in the gaseous product stream ∗ 100 Considering the uncertainties of the experimental data, all tests were repeated at least three times. Recorded results were the mean values of the independent trials."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Liquid products dissolved in dichloromethane were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with an Agilent 5975C GC–MS system with the HP-5 MS capillary column (30m*0.25mm*0.25μm) for the compound identification. The oven temperature program was set from an initial temperature of 45°C–280°C at 8°C/min and maintain the final temperature for 3min. The solvent delay was set as 3min and the total runtime was about 33min. Identification of the compounds was achieved by comparing the mass spectra obtained with the system’s mass spectral library (NIST II). In addition, the identified compounds were quantitated on the basis of the p-cresol as an internal standard. Gas phase products were analyzed with a Techcomp 7900 gas chromatograph equipped with TCD. To separate gaseous products, H2 was used for carrier gas to analyzed CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and higher hydrocarbons, and He was used for the other carrier gas to analyzed H2. The molar percentage composition of the gas phase was calculated using peak normalization method. The compositions of C, H, N in raw material (Kraft lignin) and liquid products were measured by an elemental analyzer. Oxygen content was calculated by difference. The higher heating value (HHV) of oil was calculated by the Dulong’s formula: Heating value ( MJ / kg ) = 0.335 ∗ [ C ] + 1.423 ∗ [ H ] - 0.154 ∗ [ O ] - 0.145 ∗ [ N ] . where C, H, N was the wt% composition of each element. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were conducted by using Malvern apparatus and a RI detector. The bio-oil (∼5mg) was dissolved with 1mL THF. Analyses were performed at 35°C using THF as eluent with a flow rate of 1mlmin−1. All the samples were filtered using 0.45μm filter membrane prior to injection. 1H–13C heteronuclear signal quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrometry was recorded using a Bruker 500MHz spectrometer. Approximately 50mg of bio-oil was dissolved in 0.6mL dimethylsulfoxide-d 6 (DMSO). Spectra was acquired using a standard pulse sequence HSQC program with a spectral width of 240ppm, 16 scans, and 256 increments. Data processing was carried out using the MestReNova software."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst performance in ethanol system,"3.1 Catalyst performance in ethanol system 3.1.1 Effect of catalysts on the liquid products distribution The versatile supported catalyst Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 was applied to catalyze the degradation of lignin in supercritical ethanol. The qualitative liquid products distribution based on the peak area from GC–MS was showed in Fig. 1 and the corresponding GC–MS chromatograms were displayed in Fig. S1. All the reactions were conducted at 350°C for 4h and the catalyst concentration was 40wt% based on the dry kraft lignin. The reaction condition was selected in view of the previous studies (Yang et al., 2016). According to qualitative analysis of the compounds, the major products fell into two groups: aliphatic compounds (C10 aliphatic hydrocarbon, C5–6 aliphatic alcohol, C8–10 aliphatic acid/ester and C18 9-octadeceneamide) and C7–10 aromatic compounds (guaiacolics/catechols, alkylphenolics, aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic alcohols). All aliphatic components except aliphatic hydrocarbon declined more or less with the introduction of Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2. Meanwhile, the alternative to this was the increase of aromatic compounds. Fig. 1 showed that the content of guaiacolics/catechols and alkylphenolics reached 17% and 2% from non-catalysts products respectively, and the polymers reached as high as 9%. Furthermore, it was surprising that the content of phenols decreased after the use of Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 and barely appeared in the liquid product (1%). This result reflected that the catalyst gave a better catalytic selectivity on cleave phenolic hydroxyl group and methoxyl. What came with this decrease was a steep increase in the content of aromatic alcohols (20% vs. 57%) and aromatic hydrocarbons (0 vs.7%). Compared with the studies on the degradation of lignin, the yield of aromatic alcohols had been improved by four times dramatically (Ma et al., 2014; Torr et al., 2011). In conclusion, the catalytic system represented a highly efficient and selective method for the production of aromatic alcohols (no phenols doped) from lignin, which was rarely reported in the literatures. Notably, different from the general noble metal catalysts, this kind of catalyst would not cause a decrease in the aromatic compounds as result of the aromatic ring hydrogenation. It could also be proved by the liquid products without hydrogenation cyclics. Beyond that, polymers that appeared in the larger retention time disappeared completely (Fig. S1) when Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 was used, which suggested that the lignin depolymerization conducted pretty thoroughly and no repolymerization took place in ethanol system. Based on the change of bio-oil component, Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 was responsible for simplification of the component of aromatic products. To verify the reliability of qualitative analysis, the most significant 16 species of the liquid products was quantitatively analyzed by the use of an internal standard. The absolute peak area and actual yields of every specific compound were listed in Table S1. There was an error in component content, but the actual product distribution was roughly the same with the results of qualitative analyses. The overall yield of these reached 149%. The heating value of liquid product could be improved by Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 (Fig. 1). The HHV of the liquid product was estimated with the Dulong formula to be as high as 35.791MJ/kg, as compared to 31.430MJ/kg for oil without catalyst. The observed decrease in the O/C value from 0.227 (without catalyst) to 0.162 and a marked increase in the H/C value of 1.307 (without catalyst) to 1.505 reflected that this catalyst promoted hydrodeoxygenation satisfactorily. The yield of liquid product was also examined and detailed results were listed in Table S2. At 350°C, almost no coke produced and the lignin conversion reached the maximum (99%) over Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2. It indicated that the catalyst was contributed to reduce the extent of recondensation reactions and/or enhances the rate of kraft lignin depolymerization reactions. The total liquid yield was higher than 100%, which demonstrated that ethanol reacted with lignin through alkylation reaction as a reactant. 3.1.2 1H–13C HSQC NMR of liquid product over Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 1H–13C heteronuclear signal quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrometry was applied to shed light on the structural characteristics of liquid products obtained over Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2. The spectrum was displayed in Fig. S2. Signals corresponding to the aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohol/ester were clearly observed between δ 0.5–2.5ppm (1H) and δ 10–40ppm (13C). Alkane replaced by phenyl (aromatic hydrocarbon) could be observed in higher chemical shift (δ H 2.5–3ppm and δ C 20–40ppm). In addition, it could be concluded that there were unsaturated olefins in bio-oil from the spectrum (δ H 5.5–6ppm and δ C 120–130ppm). Signals that appeared between δ H 6.5–7.5ppm and δ C 120–130ppm represented the existence of aromatic alcohols. Different from the NMR spectrum of bio-oil over Rh/C studied in the previous work (Yang et al., 2016), the signals belonging to the guaiacolics and phenolics in the δ 6.5–7ppm (1H) and δ 110–120ppm (13C) regions were absent. It indicated the successful crack of the phenolic hydroxyl group and methoxyl of lignin subunits during the depolymerization process. In the other words, lignin could be selectively converted into aromatic alcohols without phenols over Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 in ethanol system. No signals appeared belonging to the hydrogenated cyclics with oxygen containing substituents in the δ 3–4.5ppm (1H) and δ 70–80ppm (13C) regions, which indicated that no aromatic rings hydrogenation was detected. No cross-peaks assigned to methylene bridge isomers (δ H 3.5–4.0ppm and δ C 29–40ppm) appeared in the spectrum, which confirmed the absence of phenol oligomerization. All results consisted with the analysis of GC–MS. 3.1.3 Effect of catalysts on the gaseous products distribution Both gas and liquid products were equally important in lignin conversion (Al-Rahbi et al., 2016), and H2-rich gas produced was helpful for the hydrodeoxygenation of liquid oil and prevent the formation of polymers (Wang and Wang, 2016). The gas composition was listed in Table 1 . Non-catalyzed experiments were conducted as blank experiments. A conclusion could be drawn that the catalyst greatly promoted the formation of gases, whether H2 or CO, CH4, CO2 and C2H4. Notably, the selectivity to the H2 increased from 42% to 82% which was much higher than the literatures published using steam reforming method (30%–65%) (Sharma et al., 2016; Remón et al., 2016). To further understand the possible sources of H2, ethanol was separately tested to evaluate the catalyst performance on gas distribution. 15.50mmol H2 was obtained, which was equal to half of the existence of lignin. Based on the contrast test, half of the H2 was derived from the decomposition of ethanol and the other half came from kraft lignin. Compared with ethanol steam reforming and supercritical water gasification literatures, selectivity to CO2 was less than a quarter of reports (Sharma et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2016). That could be attribute to the absence of water and the existence of pure ethanol in system (Carvalho et al., 2016; Anjaneyulu et al., 2016). On the one hand, the absence of water inhibited the produce of CO2 originating from reactions between reactants/intermediates (C2H5OH, CO, CH4, CH3CHO) and H2O. On the other, CO2 produced would be absorbed by remanding ethanol (Silva et al., 2011)."
9,Reusability of the catalyst in ethanol system,"3.2 Reusability of the catalyst in ethanol system To estimate the reusability of the catalyst in supercritical ethanol system, Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 was cyclically used in lignin depolymerization without any treatment. 3.2.1 Effect of reused catalysts on the products distribution For liquid products: The qualitative analysis for liquid products composition were summarized in Fig. 2 . With the increase of recycling times, the amount of various aliphatic compounds gradually rose to the values of non-catalyst experiment. In the whole cycle process, 9-octadeceneamide didn’t appear. Meanwhile, aromatic compounds (aromatic hydrocarbons/alcohols) showed a downward trend. It was gratifying to note that phenols had never been detected in the liquid products until the catalyst was used for five times. Nevertheless, it was a pity that aromatic rings hydrogenation (5% cyclohexane derivatives) and repolymerization of phenolic monomers (2% polymers) were detected in the third and fourth usage, respectively. In addition, the catalytic performance of hydrogenation and deoxygenation showed a linear downward trend with the cycle of catalyst, which could be seen from the content of C, H and O in bio-oil (Fig. 2). Gel permeation chromatograms (GPC) analysis of the liquid products also revealed that the distribution of Mw gradually broadened and moved away from small molecular weight (Fig. S3), which was consistent with the reduced catalytic activity. For gaseous products: The selectivity to H2 emerged a reducing trend (Fig. 3 ) with the repeated use of catalyst. In the third cycle, the generated H2 (5.93mmol) was lower than the alone ethanol liquefaction system (Table S3). One reasonable explanation was that H2 production was less than its consumption by the hydrogenation of liquid oil. In the fourth and fifth cycle, the downward trend was more obvious. There was a close interaction relationship among catalyst deactivation, liquid (hydrogenated cyclics, polymers) and gas products (H2) distribution. The reduced catalytic activity resulted in a decrease in the inhibition ability of the aromatic rings hydrogenation, which further increased the H2 consumption. The deactivation of the catalyst also caused an obvious decrease in the total amount of gas, especially H2, by affecting the decomposition of alcohols and lignin. Reduced H2 content triggered HHV drop by the inhibition on the hydrodeoxygenation of liquid products. It was consistent with the decreasing H and increasing O content in the liquid oil. At the same time, H2-poor gas also resulted in incomplete degradation of lignin so that polymers and char were formed, which would cause further deactivation of the catalyst. 3.2.2 Deactivation of the catalyst Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 exhibited an excellent catalytic selectivity in the ethanolysis of kraft lignin, but its activity showed a downward trend as the repeated use. To explore the possible reasons for the deactivation of catalyst, the phase structure, morphology, microstructure and noble metal content of catalyst (fresh and used) were investigated. The XRD of the fresh catalyst showed well resolved peaks corresponding to the support structure in the range 10–90° (Fig. S4-a). No La-containing crystalline phase was detected, which suggested that the additive was well dispersed. Diffraction peaks of Rh were also not observed due to the low loadings (2wt%). The SEM and TEM images of the fresh catalyst were shown in Fig. S4-b and S4-c, respectively. The former indicated the uniform morphology of support, and the latter showed the state of Rh dispersed on the support surface. After fifth cycle, XRD, SEM and TEM images of catalyst were measured and showed in Fig. S4-a’–c’, respectively. Four prominent diffraction peaks associated with the supports had virtually unchanged. However, diffraction peaks belonged to the ceria-based materials were smaller than the fresh catalyst in the 65–85° range (Schimming et al., 2015b). More than that, there were three small diffraction peaks of the crystalline phase of Ce(CO3)(OH) (cerium carbonate hydroxide) at the 31°, 45° and 56° (Yu et al., 2016), which showed CeO2 was unstable and easily transformed into Ce(CO3)(OH) in supercritical ethanol system along with the repeated use of the catalyst. This might be a major reason of aromatic rings hydrogenation and H2 reduction. In addition, the support had a certain degree of agglomeration by comparing Fig. S4-b’ with Fig. S4-b. From TEM images of used catalysts, the Rh particle still cannot be distinguished as that on fresh catalyst, which indicated that no significant change of the Rh cluster size. According to the weight ratio of noble metal Rh detected by ICP, the loading of Rh gradually decreased from 1.8 to 1.3 with cycle of the catalyst, which was considered as the other reason of reduced catalytic activity. Beyond that, the char yield rose from 1% to 7% dramatically with the increase of recycling times (Table S2). Carbon deposition that caused the deactivation of catalyst was also an aspect that should not be ignored. All of these reasons described above had a great positive effect on the development of this kind of catalyst in the supercritical system."
10,Catalyst performance in the different solvents,"3.3 Catalyst performance in the different solvents Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 exhibited efficient catalytic capabilities for converting lignin into high yield of liquid oil rich in aromatic alcohols and H2-rich mixture gas in ethanol system. However, the product yield and distribution strongly depended on the solvent used. Therefore, whether or not the catalyst showed high selectivity in other common solvents (water/formic acid, methanol, isopropanol) were checked. Liquid products distribution based on the peak area of GC–MS were listed in Fig. 4 . Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 contributed to improve the yield of alkylphenolics by 12% in water (10mL)/formic acid (200μL) system. Alkylphenolics predominated and accounted for 71% of the products. It was slightly 5% lower than the literature published (Narani et al., 2015), but almost no multi-oxygen phenols (guaiacolics and catechols) produced was the greatest advantages over Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2. However, there were some obstacles to use the supercritical water system for lignin depolymerization, such as high reaction temperature (373°C), low bio-oil yield (30%) and high char/tar formation (32%) (Table S2). More than that, nearly 13% polymers rich in oxygen were produced in this system. It was considered as the major reason for the low HHV of the liquid products. In methanol system, Rh/La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 also could not show the satisfactory hydrodeoxygenation effect in view of the low HHV of liquid products. Ideally, no aromatic rings hydrogenation was observed in both solvents mentioned above. Isopropanol was different from either of them, and the hydrogenated cyclics accounted for 47% of the total of liquid products. The HHV of bio-oil was also higher than formers. From the GPC analysis of the liquid products, apparent Mw values of bio-oil was sorted in descending order as follows: methanol, water, isopropanol and ethanol (Fig. S5). The effect of catalyst on the gas products distribution were systematically studied in different solvents and results were listed in Table S4. Similar to ethanol system, the produce of H2 was promoted in water/formic acid and methanol system compared with the absence of lignin. This indicated that H2 produced from lignin was more than the consumption of liquid oil hydrogenation. However, the selectivity to H2 was lower than the ethanol system. Different from the three solvents mentioned above, the catalytic selectivity to H2 was up to 98% in the pure isopropanol system, which was slightly higher than the literature report (96%) (Karakuş et al., 2013). But, H2 produced by solvent was extensively consumed (from 50.40 to 15.75mmol) by hydrogenation of phenolic ring, which was contrary to the aim for the high yield aromatic compounds. However, it was an important reminder that the aromatic rings hydrogenation might only be detected once the selectivity of H2 up to a higher value. Above all, ethanol was considered as the only effective solvent for the depolymerization of lignin in terms of the yield and selectivity of aromatic alcohols and H2."
11,Conclusion,"Efficient catalytic ethanolysis and gasification of kraft lignin were achieved in supercritical ethanol over a La2O3/CeO2–ZrO2 supported Rh catalyst. Low char yield (<1%) and high lignin conversion rate (∼99%) was achieved. Aromatic alcohols predominated and accounted for 88% of the total aromatic compounds. Notably, almost no phenols and hydrogenated cyclics were detected in the liquid products. The catalytic selectivity to H2 reached as high as 82%, which made the whole reaction out of H2 supply. Nevertheless, there were a 15% and 11% selectivity decline for aromatic alcohols and H2 due to the deactivation of catalyst."
