0,Introduction,"Cyclopentanone (CPO) is a value-added chemical, which serves as the feedstock for the synthesis of drugs, spices, pesticides and perfume additives [1, 2]. Pyrolysis of adipic acid and oxidation of cyclopentene are the traditional method for the production of CPO, which, however, is environmentally unfriendly with high energy consumption [3, 4]. In contrast, it is a green and sustainable way to produce CPO from furfural [5], a platform chemical from hydrolysis of renewable biomass [6]. The process of conversion of furfural to CPO involves a series of consecutive reactions including the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FA), the dehydration of the hydroxyl group and the subsequent ring rearrangement to the intermediate of 4‑hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone, the further dehydration and the hydrogenation reactions to form CPO [7-9], as shown in Scheme 1 . Since furfural and the reaction intermediates has multiple functionalities, there are multiple routes for their further conversion, which diminishes the selectivity for the conversion of furfural to CPO [8]. Among many side reactions for the conversion of furfural or FA to CPO, the full hydrogenation of the furan ring to form tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is a major challenge for the selective production of CPO from furfural [10]. The formation of THFA prevented the conversion of furfural or FA to CPO. However, the hydrogenation of the C = O in furfural to form FA and the hydrogenation of the C = C bonds in the furan ring are catalyzed by the same type of hydrogenation sites [7]. Thus, the development of the catalyst that could selectively catalyze the hydrogenation of C = O bonds while avoid the hydrogenation of the C = C bonds in the furan ring of furfural or FA is the key for achieving the selective conversion of furfural to CPO. Up to now, there have been a number of catalysts reported for the hydrogenation of furfural to CPO, many of which are the noble metal-based catalysts, such as Ru-based [11, 12], Pd-based [13], Pt-based [14] and Au-based [15] catalysts. Hronec et al. [7-9, 13] firstly described the aqueous phase conversion of furfural to CPO using precious metal catalysts, achieving the CPO yield of 76.5% over Pt/C and 92% over Pd–Cu/C. Fang et al. [16] also developed the noble metal-based catalyst of embedded Ru nanoparticles into MOF for direct conversion of furfural to CPO. Although the noble metal-based catalysts have good activity and selectivity, their large-scale application is limited due to their high cost and limited reserve [17-19]. In contrast, the non-precious metals have attracted wide attention of the researchers due to their lower cost and the high availability [20, 21]. The nickel-based and copper-based catalysts have been used to study the conversion of furfural to CPO, and show acceptable catalytic activity and selectivity [3, 4, 22-24]. The typical work for the hydrogenation of furfural to cyclopentanone was shown in Scheme 2 . However, both nickel and copper-based catalysts have some intrinsic issues in the catalysis of the conversion of furfural to CPO. As indicated above, the key to enhance the selectivity of CPO from furfural is to selectively hydrogenate the carbonyl functionality in furfural while to avoid the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural or FA. However, nickel species are active for hydrogenation of both C = O and C = C in furfural [25], and thus over nickel-based catalyst the deep hydrogenation of furan ring in furfural to form THFA was the main side reactions that diminish the formation of FA and inhibits the subsequent formation of CPO from FA. For Cu-based catalysts, they generally show the low selectivity to hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural [26]. However, sintering of metallic copper species especially in aqueous medium is a major obstacle for its industrial application [27]. Nickel catalyst generally was more resistant towards sintering than copper catalyst [28], but its activity for excessive hydrogenation of the furan ring has to be tackled. Considering that carbonyl functionality is one single unsaturated functionality and its hydrogenation may only require single contact with the hydrogenation sites. In comparison, the C = C bonds in furan ring are conjugated and their hydrogenation may require multiple contact with the hydrogenation sites. Limiting the presence of nickel sites might be one potential solution to suppress the deep hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural for enhancing the selectivity to CPO. Based on above consideration, in this study, a series of Ni/SiO2 catalysts with low nickel loading (from 0.1 to 5 wt% to SiO2) were prepared, aiming to reduce the presence of metallic nickel sites on surface of catalyst for suppressing the formation of THFA in the conversion of furfural to CPO in aqueous medium in the temperature region from 140 to 180 °C. The results showed that the abundance of metallic nickel sites was closely related to the formation of FA, THFA and CPO. The lower abundance of nickel sites suppressed the deep hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural, producing FA as the main reaction intermediates and creating the chance for its further conversion to CPO with the selectivity as high as 98.2%. The excessive presence of nickel on surface of the catalyst, however, facilitated the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural or FA, significantly reducing the production of CPO."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The SiO2 support used was B-type silica gel, which is rich in mesoporous, purchased from Qingdao Ocean Chemical Co., Ltd. Ni(NO3)2 and ethanol were purchased from the National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Furfural, FA, THFA, CPO and cyclopentanol (CPL) were bought from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used without any treatment."
3,Preparation of the catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of the catalysts The Ni/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by using an incipient wetness impregnation method with Ni(NO3)2 as the precursor of nickel [32]. The loading of nickel to the SiO2 was 0.1%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1%, 2% and 5%, respectively. Firstly, the aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2 with a certain concentration was prepared. After that, the dried SiO2 were added to the solution. After the impregnation, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and then the dried precursor was calcined in air atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h. Finally, before the use in the hydrogenation experiments, the calcined catalysts were reduced under a H2/Ar gas flow (H2 flow rate = 40 mL/min, Ar flow rate = 40 mL/min) at 500 °C for 2 h."
4,Catalytic experiments,"2.3 Catalytic experiments Evaluation of the catalytic performance of the catalysts was carried out in an autoclave reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and the volume of the reactor is 10 mL. Typically, 4 g of reaction substrate-solvent mixture (furfural = 0.4 mmol, deionized water = 3.96 g) and 50 mg of the catalyst were put into the reactor vessel, and then the reactor was then sealed. After that, the reactor was purged with nitrogen for three times and then hydrogen was fed in for another three times to remove the residual nitrogen. Following that, hydrogen was slowly fed in until the pressure of the reactor was 3 to 5 MPa. The stirring speed of the magnetic agitator was set at 600 rpm in order to eliminate the mass transfer limitation under the conditions employed. The reactor vessel was heated to the pre-set temperature in 30 min and hold at the temperature for 2 − 3 h. After the experiment, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. 4 g of acetone was added and mixed with the reaction residual in order to ensure the full recovery of CPO, due to its low solubility in water. The catalysts and the liquid products were then separated and collected separately for further analysis."
5,Catalysts characterizations,"2.4 Catalysts characterizations The BUILDER SSA-6000 aperture specific surface area analyzer was used to analyze the specific surface area and porous structures of the sample. Before the test, the samples were pretreated in vacuum for 2 h at 150 °C. The samples were then tested with N2 adsorption and desorption methods at absorption temperature of 77 K. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method were used to calculate the pore size distribution and specific surface area of the materials. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the phase composition of the catalysts with Rigaku Ultima IV equipped with a Cu target (K α-radiation source, λ = 1.5406 Å). The range of the diffraction angle is from 10.0 to 80.0° (scanning speed: 10°/min). The particle size of nickel in the catalysts was calculated with the equation of Debye-Scherrer. In order to analyze the changes in the chemical state of the catalyst during the reduction with hydrogen, the reduction behavior of the calcined catalysts was characterized through Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) by using a Vodo VDSorb-91i chemical adsorption analyzer. Typically, 10 mg of the calcined catalyst was loaded into the reaction tube, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 850 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. An external standard method by establishing the correlation of the peak area with the amount of NiO reduced was developed for calculation of the reduction degree of NiO on the catalysts. The dispersion of nickel in the catalysts were determined by H2-Temperature Programmed Desorption (H2-TPD) with Vodo VDSorb 91i instrument. Typically, the mass of the sample used was 100 mg. The sample was firstly pretreated at 150 °C for 1 h in an argon flow. After that, the sample was flushed in a H2 flow (flow rate: 30 mL/min) for 60 min at room temperature to adsorb hydrogen, and then was purged with argon (flow rate: 30 mL/min) to remove the physically adsorbed hydrogen for another 30 min. Finally, the sample was heated to 850 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min for H2 desorption and the signal for hydrogen desorption was recorded by TCD. In order to investigate the distribution of the acidic sites of the catalysts, NH3-temperature programming desorption (NH3-TPD) were also performed in the Vodo VDSorb-91i instrument. The procedure was similar to that in the H2-TPD characterization, and only difference was the use of NH3 instead of H2 as the probing gas. Other details for above characterizations could also be found in our previous work [29, 30]."
6,Analytical methods of liquid products,"2.5 Analytical methods of liquid products After the reaction, the liquid products were analysed by GC–MS apparatus (Shimadzu, GCMS-QP2020) equipped with a capillary column. The liquid product was diluted to below 1000 ppm with acetone as a solvent. The temperature for the injection port was 250 °C. The column was hold at 50 °C for 3 min and then increased to 250 °C with a 10 °C/min of ramping rate. Different organics in the samples were separated according to their varied boiling point and polarity. Helium was chosen as the carrier gas (flow rate: 4.0 mL/min). The identification of the organics was achieved by matching their mass spectrum with the standard spectra library in NIST 2014. Other details for above characterizations could also be found in our previous work. [31] The conversion of the reactant was calculated according to the equation as follows: Conversion of reactant ( % ) = Mole of reactant consumed Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % The yield of target product was calculated according to the following equation: Yield of target product ( % ) = Mole of target product produced Mole of reactant loaded × 100 % The selectivity of target product was calculated according to the equation as follows: Selectivity of target product ( % ) = Mole of target product produced Mole of reactant converted × 100 %"

8,Physicochemical properties of the catalysts,"3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalysts 3.1.1 BET analysis Fig. 1 showed the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of the different catalysts. The pore radius distribution of the catalysts ranged from 10 to 50 Å, which belonged to the mesoporous material. In addition, the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of all catalysts conformed to type IV isotherms with H1 type hysteresis loop, which further illustrated the mesoporous properties of the catalysts [32]. It should be noted that there was no significant difference in N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms among the different catalysts, indicating that the impregnation of nickel did not change the structure of the catalysts. The TEM images of different catalysts also illustrated this point, as shown in Figure S1. With the increase of nickel loading, more metal particles were observed in the TEM images of the catalysts, but the structure of the catalysts did not change and still showed a porous structure. The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore radius of different catalysts were shown in Table 1 . The impregnation of nickel metal reduced the specific surface area and pore volume of support. The specific area of the catalysts decreased monotonously with the increasing content of nickel on surface of the catalyst. The presence of nickel could block the pores on the surface of SiO2, and as the higher loading of nickel could inevitably block more pores, resulting in the monotonous decrease of specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts. Compared with the support, the average pore radius of the catalyst increased slightly, which might be due to the accumulation of nickel particles on the surface of the catalyst. Different nickel loading not only affected the porous structure of the catalyst, but also affected the crystalline state of nickel in the catalyst. The crystal structure of the catalyst was characterized by XRD. 3.1.2 XRD analysis Fig. 2 showed the XRD characterization results of the calcined and reduced catalysts with different Ni loading. As shown in Fig. 1, all the catalysts showed a wide diffraction peak with the 2θ degree ranging from 15° to 30°, which were attributed to the SiO2 support. The diffraction peaks in the calcined catalyst at 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.9° and 75.2° belonged to NiO (PDF#75–0197), while the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 71.5° in the reduced catalyst belonged to metallic Ni (PDF#01–1258). When the loading of active metal Ni was low (i.e. at 0.1%), nickel could not be detected because of the high dispersion and small crystal phase. With the increase of Ni loading to 0.6%, the diffraction peak of Ni appeared in the XRD pattern, and the diffraction peak intensity of metal Ni increased with the increase of Ni loading. The TEM images of the catalyst (Figure S1) showed the similar phenomenon. When the nickel loading was low, fewer metal particles were observed in the TEM image. With the increase of nickel loading, the nickel metal particles in the catalyst increase significantly. The EDS spectrum (Figure S2) also illustrate this point. In addition, the diffraction peaks of nickel were relatively wide and weak, which indicated that the grain size of nickel was small and the nickel species were dispersed on the surface of SiO2. The grain size of metallic Ni was calculated by using Scherrer formula and the results were shown in Table 2 . After calcination, the particle size of NiO was small, ranging from 12.5 to 14.1 nm, which was closely related to the larger specific surface area of SiO2. The larger specific surface area facilitated the dispersion of metal species on its surface. In addition, with the increase of nickel loading, the grain size of NiO increased to a small extent. Comparing with the catalyst with the low loading of nickel, the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the relatively higher nickel loading resulted in to the higher extent of sintering on surface of the catalyst. After the reduction, the Ni particle size in the catalyst generally decreased. On the one hand, the oxygen atoms in NiO species were removed during the reduction process, resulting in smaller metal particle size. On the other hand, the H2-TPR of the catalyst showed that the interaction between nickel and support was strong, which could inhibit the movement and growth of nickel particles during the reduction process. In order to investigate the change of the reduction behavior of NiO on the surface of catalysts with different Ni loading, the catalysts were further characterized by H2-TPR. 3.1.3 H2-TPR analysis The H2-TPR characterization results of the catalyst were shown in Fig. 3. The reducibility of nickel oxide on the surface of the support depends on the interaction between the nickel oxide and the support. The stronger the interaction between metal oxide and support, the higher the reduction temperature [33]. It could be seen from Fig. 3 that the reduction peak of the NiO mainly located in two regions. The reduction peak between 150 and 300 °C was attributed to the reduction of NiO with small particle size and with the weak interaction between with the support, which could be reduced at a lower temperature. The reduction peak between 300 and 600 °C indicated the stronger interaction between NiO and the support [34]. When the metal loading was 0.6%, the reduction peak was weak, and there was a long tail peak. With the increasing of Ni loading, the reduction peak moved to the high temperature region, and multiple peaks were overlapped. With the lower metal loading, NiO was dispersed more evenly on surface of the support, and the particle size was similar (Table 1). Therefore, the 0.6%Ni/SiO2 catalyst had only one primary reduction peak between 300 and 600 °C. The existence of long tail peak might be related to the NiO particles dispersed in the deep pores of the support, resulting in the mass transfer limitation of hydrogen and the higher reduction temperature. With the increase of the nickel loading, nickel species accumulated to form the particles of large-size. This led to the slow diffusion of hydrogen into the nickel oxide phase during the reduction process, resulting in the increase of reduction temperature. The reduction degree of different catalysts was calculated and the results were shown in Table 2. The reduction degree of nickel oxide decreased with the increase of metal loading. The relatively large nickel oxide grains in the catalyst with high nickel loading were not conducive to its reduction. The distribution of nickel species on the surface of SiO2 was further characterized with H2-TPD. 3.1.4 H2-TPD The dispersion of metallic nickel species on different catalysts was characterized with H2-TPD, and the results were shown in Fig. 4. Generally, hydrogen desorption temperature is directly related to the degree of interaction between hydrogen and metal sites on the catalyst surface[31]. The low desorption temperature (< 300 °C) was due to the weak interaction between hydrogen and the metal sites, while the high temperature (> 650 °C) was related to the desorption of the spilled hydrogen [35, 36]. The desorption peaks of all catalysts were concentrated in the range of 300–600 °C, which was related to the strong interaction between hydrogen and nickel species [37]. The dispersion of nickel is shown in Table 2. With the increase of nickel loading, the dispersion of nickel decreased, which showed a negative relationship with the grain size of active nickel. The agglomeration of nickel particles led to the decrease of the nickel dispersion. In addition, the active sites on the catalyst surface were calculated and the results showed that the number of active sites on the catalyst surface increased with the increase of nickel particle loading. The conversion of furfural to CPO required not only the action of hydrogenation site, but also the acidic site [38]. The distribution of the acidic sites on the catalyst surface were further characterized with NH3-TPD. 3.1.5 NH3-TPD The NH3-TPD characterization results of the catalysts were shown in Fig. 5. Generally, the peaks between 50 and 300 °C are associated with the weak acidic centers, while the peaks between 300 and 600 °C are associated with the acidic centers of moderate strength. The peaks value above 600 °C belongs to the strong acidic centers [29]. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the acid sites on the catalyst surface mainly concentrated at 100–300 °C, which belonged to the weak acid sites. The NH3-TPD profiles of the different catalysts showed limited difference, indicating that the acid sites mainly came from the surface of the support. It should be noted that when the loading of nickel increased to 2% or 5%, a small desorption peak appeared at 350 °C, which corresponding to the acid sites with medium strength, and it was the acidic sites introduced by the loading of NiO. In addition, the total amount of acid sites on the catalyst surface (Table 2) increased with the increase of metal loading, which was attributed to the appearance of moderate desorption peak at a higher nickel loading. In order to investigate the specific characteristics of the catalyst with the varied nickel loading on the catalytic performances, the hydrogenation of furfural was subsequently carried out."
9,Catalytic results,"3.2 Catalytic results The product distribution in the hydrogenation of furfural in aqueous medium at different reaction temperatures was summarized in Table 3 . At 140 °C, the conversion of furfural increased with the increasing nickel loading (Entry 1 to 6). When the nickel loading was below 1.0%, there was no enough metallic sites for the effective hydrogenation of furfural. However, CPO was produced as the main product with a high selectivity despite the conversion of furfural was low. With the increase of nickel loading, the abundance of metallic nickel sites increased, which led to the increased selectivity for the production of THFA, especially over the 5.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The formation of THFA diminished the opportunity for the conversion of FA to CPO, leading to the low yield of CPO. With the increase of reaction temperature, the reaction rate for the conversion of furfural was accelerated, leading to the improved conversion of furfural and the yield of CPO to some extent. Similar trends for the production of CPO and THFA were observed at 160 and 180 °C (Entry 7 to 12; Entry 13 to 18). Over the catalysts with the lower nickel loading (0.6%Ni/SiO2, 0.8%Ni/SiO2, 1.0%Ni/SiO2), CPO could be selectively produced, with the selectivity around of 90% (Entry 8–10; Entry 14–16). This was due to the suppressed production of THFA and the FA produced was thus further converted to CPO. In addition, the enhanced reaction temperature also promoted the further hydrogenation of CPO to CPL, as the activity of the catalysts for hydrogenation was enhanced with the increasing reaction temperature. In addition to reaction temperature, other parameters of the hydrogenation experiments such as the hydrogen pressure and reaction time also affected the capability of catalyst for hydrogenation of the reactant and reaction intermediate. The results for the effects of hydrogen pressure and reaction time on the conversion of furfural to CPO were shown in Table 4 and 5 , respectively. The pressure of hydrogen affected the catalytic behaviors of the Ni/SiO2 catalysts via the distinct ways. For the catalyst with the low nickel loading (0.6%Ni/SiO2, 0.8%Ni/SiO2, 1.0%Ni/SiO2), the increase of hydrogen pressure could improve the conversion of furfural and the yield of cyclopentanone. The higher abundance of hydrogen facilitated the hydrogenation of furfural to FA and the reaction intermediates, while did not promote the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural or FA to THFA, as number of the metallic nickel sites were not high enough to facilitate such reactions. In this sense, the hydrogen pressure and the low nickel loading showed the synergistic effects for the conversion of furfural to CPO. However, for the 2.0%Ni/SiO2 and 5.0%Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the selectivity of THFA increased with the increasing of hydrogen pressure, as the higher hydrogen pressure promoted the hydrogenation reaction, while there were enough metallic nickel sites for catalyzing the further conversion of FA to THFA via hydrogenation of the furan ring. When the reaction time was prolonged to 3 h (Table 6 ), more furfural could be converted and the yield of the product was further improved over some of the catalysts, while the effect was not as significant as the increasing hydrogen pressure. In addition, the stability of the catalyst in the cycle experiment was also investigated by recycle of the 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst for five times. The results in Fig. 6 indicated that the conversion of furfural and the yield of CPO over the catalyst remained stable, even though a small portion of the catalyst was inevitably lost in the process of catalyst recovery via centrifugation, filtering and washing. The catalyst showed the reasonable catalytic stability. XRD analysis was carried out for the 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst after the recycling experiment, and the results were shown in Figure S3a. The XRD patterns of the fresh and used catalysts were basically consistent, and there was no obvious change in diffraction of the main crystal phase. Comparing with the fresh 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst, the growth of Ni particles in the used 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst was insignificant (14.1 nm in the used catalyst and 12.8 nm in the fresh catalyst). In addition, the fresh and used 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalysts were also characterized by TG (Figure S3b), the mass increase at 250 °C in the TG curves attributed to the oxidation of nickel in the catalyst in air. The weight loss of the used catalyst is only 1.4% higher than that of the fresh catalyst, which indicated that there was no obvious polymerization of furfural or the reaction intermediates during the experiments. The typical results of this work were compared with the typical results in the literature and the results was shown in Table 6. Most noble metal catalysts showed high activity [7, 12, 16]. Among the non-noble metal catalysts, the 2.0%Ni/SiO2 catalyst in this work has good activity and CPO selectivity. Although the CuZn/CNT [3] and Cu−Ni−Al [1] catalysts produced high CPO yields, their reaction times were 10 h and 8 h, respectively, and the Cu−Ni−Al catalysts used high metal loadings (87 wt%), while the metal loading herein was only 2 wt%. Other catalysts, such as CuZnAl-500 [4], Raney Ni [23] and NiCu-50/SBA-15 [24], had relatively low CPO yields despite the use of higher metal loading. The above results indicated that the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the low loading of nickel showed the superior catalytic activity to catalyze the selective conversion of furfural to CPO when considered the low nickel loading, mechanism of which was further discussed in the following sections."
10,Discussion,"The reaction pathways from the conversion of furfural to CPO were shown in Scheme 1. In the overall process, hydrogenation was involved in several steps and played essential roles in determining the selectivity of the products. Specifically, the initial step for the hydrogenation was the conversion of furfural to FA. The dehydration of the hydroxyl group of FA with the catalysis of acidic sites on surface of catalyst and the further ring opening rearrangement formed the intermediate, 4‑hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone. The dehydration of 4‑hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone and the further hydrogenation produces CPO, while CPO could be further hydrogenated to form CPL. In this overall process, inhibiting the deep hydrogenation of the furan ring in FA to THFA was the key to achieve the high selectivity of CPO. The strategy that could avoid the deep hydrogenation was to decrease the catalytic activity by reducing the nickel sites or modifying the experimental conditions to suppress the deep hydrogenation reactions. The results in Table 4 indicated the modification of the reaction conditions by the change of hydrogen pressure was not that effective than that of decreasing the abundance of nickel sites on surface of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The results in Table 3 indicated that, comparing with the hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality in furfural, the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural or FA was more sensitive to the abundance of the hydrogenation sites on surface of the catalyst. The selectivity of the major products versus the abundance or dispersion of the exposed metallic nickel sites was shown in Fig. 7. The increased nickel loading led to the aggregation of nickel species, which reduced the dispersion of metallic nickel. However, the higher nickel loading resulted in the formation of more exposed nickel species on surface of the catalyst. The more nickel species in the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the high loading of nickel led to the deep hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural to form THFA, and consequently the formation of CPO was suppressed. In comparison, the carbonyl species in furfural could be hydrogenated over the Ni/SiO2 catalysts with either the low or the high loading of nickel. The varied sensibility of the carbonyl and the furan ring functionalities in furfural was likely related to their distinct absorption and hydrogenation pathways on surface of the catalysts, as shown in Scheme 3 . For the hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality, two hydrogen radicals are required, which was equivalent to two metallic nickel sites if it was assumed that one metallic nickel site adsorbed one hydrogen radical. In comparison, the furan ring contains two C = C bonds and they are conjugated. The full hydrogenation of the furan ring would require the coordination with four metallic nickel sites that adsorbed hydrogen radicals. This would not be problem if the catalyst had a high nickel loading with big nickel particles that contained multiple metallic nickel sites. This was the case for the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural or FA over the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the higher loading of nickel (Table 3). However, over the catalyst with the low nickel loading, the metallic nickel species were highly dispersed (Table 2). The high dispersion of nickel would make it more difficult to have four metallic nickel sites working together for hydrogenation of the furan ring coordinatively. This explains the varied activity of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the distinct loading of nickel on hydrogenation of the carbonyl and the furan ring in furfural as well as eventually the different selectivity to CPO."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the conversion of furfural over the Ni/SiO2 catalysts with the varied abundance of metallic nickel sites was investigated. The results showed that the selectivity of the products could be flexibly regulated via tailoring the presence of nickel sites on surface of the catalysts. Although the increase of nickel loading decreased the dispersion of metallic nickel sites on surface of the catalyst, the overall number of metallic nickel sites increased. This not only enhanced the conversion of furfural via hydrogenation, but also catalyzed the further hydrogenation of the furan ring in FA to form THFA. The formation of THFA and CPO was in parallel, and thus the predominance of the production of THFA over the catalysts with the higher abundance of nickel sites prohibited the formation of CPO. In comparison, over the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with the low nickel loading the further hydrogenation of FA to THFA was not promoted, and, as a result, FA could be further selectively converted to CPO. Furthermore, increasing hydrogen pressure could further enhance the hydrogenation of furfural to FA and then to CPO over the catalyst with the low nickel loading. The higher hydrogenation pressure did not catalyze the hydrogenation of FA to THFA, if the abundance of metallic nickel sites was not high enough on surface of the catalyst. The carbonyl and the furan ring functionalities in furfural showed the distinct sensibility to the abundance of nickel sites on surface of the catalyst. It was easier to hydrogenate the carbonyl functionality with the lower abundance of nickel sites, while the hydrogenation of the furan ring in furfural was more demanding on the number of nickel sites on surface of catalysts. This was because the hydrogenation of the furan ring with two conjugated C = C bonds need the involvement of the coordination of more nickel sites, while the hydrogenation of the C = O functionality requires much less nickel sites. The results herein demonstrated that the abundance of nickel sites could effectively tailor the selectivity of the products from the hydrogenation of furfural. Such effects in other reaction system may also deserve further attention."
