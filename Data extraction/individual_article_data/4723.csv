0,Introduction,"As a type of energy carrier with high efficiency and environmental protection, hydrogen has attracted increasing attention. It is regarded as a promising fuel for the future hydrogen economy, so the development of hydrogen production technology is of considerable significance. Because of hydrogen’s transportation and storage problems, small-scale (distributed) hydrogen production technologies need to be developed [1]. To date, plasma technology has been proposed for small-scale hydrogen production, including various forms of discharge, such as corona discharge [2,3], microwave discharge [4–7], glow discharge [8], spark discharge [9,10], dielectric barrier discharge [11,12], arc discharge [13,14], and other forms of discharge [15–17]. Gaseous materials such as methane, natural gas, and other gaseous hydrocarbons, which are hydrogen carriers, have been widely used in the production of hydrogen (or syngas) for plasma reforming. Liquid raw materials such as methanol, ethanol, or evaporated gasoline have also been used for testing. In particular, ethanol, as an ideal raw material for hydrogen production, can be produced by fermentation of biomass or renewable raw materials, including energy plants, agricultural and forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. Meanwhile, ethanol has low toxicity and volatility and is easy to store, process, and transport. At present, the mechanism research on plasma reforming alcohols is mainly to establish a plasma kinetic model based on various theories. Due to different reactor types, carrier gas, and feed, there is no recognized kinetic mechanism. The plasma dynamics of ethanol/water/air mixtures and kinetic mechanism of non-equilibrium plasma chemical transformation in the gas-liquid system have been studied and explained [18]. The results of experiments and calculations show that this mechanism can fully describe the concentration of the main components (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C2H2). The reforming reaction of ethanol by microwave vortex flow plasma under atmospheric pressure has been studied [6,19]. A theoretical model of the decomposition of ethanol was established considering the thermal equilibrium of gas and chemical kinetics. An integral reaction method of the decomposition of ethanol in an argon environment with and without water vapor was given successively. It was concluded that ethanol decomposition is carried out through two parallel channels with the same probability. The pathway to produce hydrogen by steam reforming of ethanol under low temperature plasma using density functional theory were studied. The only thermodynamic barrier to the formation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and acetaldehyde is the decomposition of ethanol and vapor molecules, which can be easily overcome under low-temperature plasma conditions. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide form through a multistep pathway of methyl radical transformation and formaldehyde decomposition, while H recombination produces additional hydrogen [20,21]. The chemical composition and temperature of the microwave (915 MHz) plasma source (MPS) outlet were studied via numerical simulation [7]. The concentration of the compound and the contribution of the primary reaction during the decomposition and formation of H2, C2H4, C2H2, CH4, and CO during the plasma reform process were analyzed. Regarding ethanol, hydrogen is mainly produced by the reaction of ethylene and ethane (C2H4 + H→C2H3 + H2 and C2H6 + H→C2H5 + H2) and is consumed by the reaction with the hydroxyl group. However, these research areas focused on discharging in gas; in contrast, microwave discharge in liquid does not need to carry gases, and plasma can be produced directly in the liquid. Therefore, in-liquid plasma has a more significant spatial distribution and plasma density and is expected to have better hydrogen production. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies on hydrogen production by discharging in liquids (including mechanism research). Microwave discharge in liquids can produce an over-dense plasma was confirmed using simulation [22]; the researchers believed that the method has significant application prospects for liquid hydrocarbon fuel reform. Reference [23] studied microwave discharge in n-heptane and found that under the conditions considered, the thermal process determined the decomposition kinetics of n-heptane, and the electron impact was low. References [24,25] confirmed via experiments that microwave discharge in n-dodecane could produce fuel gases such as methane and ethylene and studied the relevant hydrogen production parameters. Other types of discharge in liquids were reported in hydrogen production research [9,10,15,26]. Discharge in liquids has been studied for the hydrogen production of reformed hydrocarbons for more than a decade. However, due to the complex mechanism of plasma generation in liquids [27,28], research on the mechanism of hydrogen production is more complicated. There are few reports in this area, which is in the initial exploration stage. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively analyze the spectral data of intermediates and the mass spectral data of gas-phase products. By analyzing the thermodynamic reaction energy between free radicals, the most likely reaction path was found and confirmed by combining experimental data (linear correlation between free radicals and products). The possible reaction paths of ethanol and water molecules were demonstrated. This study provides a reference for further improving the mechanism of hydrogen production by discharge in liquids."
1,Experimental design and methods,"A schematic diagram of the experimental device is shown in Fig. 1 . The microwave power supply was 200–2000W with a frequency of 2.45 GHz (IBF). The microwaves were transmitted through a standard R26 rectangular waveguide system that consisted of a circulator with a water load, a directional coupler, a three-stub tuner, and a moveable plunger. A quartz reactor was inserted vertically into a resonant cavity located in the wide wall of a waveguide. A pure tungsten electrode was placed inside the reactor. The position of the electrode tip was adjustable up and down, and plasma was generated in the liquid at the tip of the electrode. Related research on the morphology of the plasma was described in a previous report [29]. Before the plasma was excited, approximately 400 mL of aqueous ethanol solution was maintained in the reactor, and a dry vacuum pump was turned on to reduce the reactor’s internal pressure and the raw material tank to 10 kPa. After the plasma was generated, the raw material was continuously injected into the reactor to maintain plasma generation. During the discharge process, the temperature of the liquid inside the reactor was always maintained at a stable saturation temperature. The pressure inside the reactor was relatively stable and fluctuated slightly with the change in the ethanol volume fraction. When the plasma was stable and the liquid temperature in the reactor reached the saturation temperature, the moveable plunger and the three-stub tuner were fine-tuned to reduce the reflected power to less than 5% of the incident power. The optical emission spectrometry of the plasma radiation was measured using a spectrometer (PMA-11, Hamamatsu Photonics). The exposure time was set to 30 ms, and every experimental spectrum was set to an automatic average of 50 spectra. The exhaust gas generated by the discharge was cooled and then detected using a mass spectrometer (HALO201, Hiden). The different ethanol volume fractions used in this experiment were prepared by blending anhydrous ethanol (purity ≥ 99.5%, Kemiou) with pure water. The operation was repeated three times, and the error mainly came from the robust gas-liquid conversion process around the plasma, which disturbed the plasma with continuous bubbles."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Characteristics of active species,"3.1 Characteristics of active species This section analyzes the active species that were generated during discharge. The microwave power was controlled at 700 W, and the emission spectrum of the discharge in different ethanol volume fractions (30, 50, 70, and 99.5%) was assessed (Fig. 2 a–d). The primary molecular and atomic radiation signatures identified in the spectra are summarized in Table 1 [30,31]. According to the analysis in Fig. 2a–d and Table 1, the primary active species generated by the discharge were OH, C2, CH2, CH, C, and H. C2, CH, and C indicated that the ethanol molecules were effectively decomposed. On the other hand, as the volume fraction of the ethanol increased, the relative intensity of the OH radical decreased; conversely, C2 and H increased significantly, as shown in Fig. 3 . This was primarily due to the change in the relative amount of water molecules and ethanol molecules. The OH radicals were mainly derived from the decomposition of the water molecules, and their yields decreased as the amount of water decreased. C2 was derived from the decomposition of ethanol molecules and increased as the amount of ethanol increased. The decomposition of the water molecules and ethanol molecules produced H atoms, and its increase with the ethanol fraction demonstrates that ethanol H-abstraction was the primary source of the H atoms. When discharged in pure ethanol, the spectral baseline showed an apparent upward trend after 350 nm, which was mainly caused by the thermal radiation of the electrodes [32], indicating that the thermic effect of the discharge in the pure ethanol was higher than with water doping."
4,Gas-phase product analysis,"3.2 Gas-phase product analysis The microwave power was controlled at 1500 W, and the mass spectrum of rich gas generated by discharging in the ethanol solution (volume fraction of 30%) is shown in Fig. 4 . By comparing with the standard mass spectrum [33], we found that the characteristic peaks in the mass spectrum were M/z = 2 (H2), 16 (CH4), 18 (H2O), 26 (C2H2), 28 (CO, C2H4, and N2), 31 (CH2OH), 32 (O2), and 44 (CO2). Therefore, the main gas-phase products produced by the discharge were H2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and CO2. The ethanol and water signals were detected, which was primarily caused by the evaporation of the ethanol solution, indicating that the solution temperature reached the saturation temperature during the discharge process, and part of the water was produced by the discharge. The O2 and N2 signals came from the gap at the pipeline link during the pressure reduction process, which caused some trace air to flow into the mass spectrometer. After the plasma was generated, the exhaust gas diluted the air and rapidly decreased the N2 and O2 response values. Possibility of O2 and N2 participating in the reaction was low, because there were no significant lines from the excited states of the O and N atoms and their molecular bands in Fig. 2. This demonstrates that the amount of O2 and N2 dissolved in the liquid was very low and did not constitute the plasma component, which is also a significant difference between the liquid phase discharge and gas-phase discharge. The signal to background ratio for each substance as a function of the volume fraction of ethanol is shown in Fig. 5 . H2, C2H2, and C2H4 increased significantly as the ethanol volume fraction increased, while the CO2 showed an opposite trend, and the CH4 demonstrated an inflection point when the volume fraction of ethanol was 70%. In contrast, the change in the CO was not apparent. This implies that changes in the relative amount of ethanol and water significantly affected the path of each substance and thus the change in its yield. In addition, the change in the ethanol volume fraction caused a change in gas production, which in turn affected the partial pressure above the liquid level inside the reactor. During the experiment, within the range of the ethanol volume fraction change, the pressure fluctuation ranges in the reactor increased and decreased by 4 kPa. To confirm the influence of the pressure change in the reactor on the reaction path, we further reduced the initial pressure inside the reactor from 10 kPa to 3 kPa. The results showed no significant change in hydrogen selectivity except that plasma was more likely to be produced, which seems to imply that the pressure above the liquid had little effect on the gas production path. However, the increase in the microwave power was conducive to improving the selectivity of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 6 , the percentage amount of hydrogen increased from 54.4% to 58.1%, demonstrating that a change in power affected the gas generation path, but the impact did not seem to be significant."
5,Reaction path analysis,"3.3 Reaction path analysis 3.3.1 Decomposition of raw material molecules There are four chemical bonds in the molecular structure of ethanol and water, C–C, C–O, C–H, and O–H, and their bond energies are 97.15, 101.99, 99.25, and 107.57 kcal/mol, respectively. Generally, the electron energy level in cold plasma is between 23.05 and 230.5 kcal/mol. Therefore, it is possible that the ethanol and water molecules break bonds at each bond, that is, Eqs. (1)–(5) can occur. Besides, ethanol may be broken down in other ways [21], such as Eqs. (6) and (7). Since Eqs. (6) and (7) have an intermediate transition state, and the activation energy (59.82 and 72.84 kcal/mol) is relatively lower than the decomposition energy of Eqs. (1)–(5), so the occurrence probability is relatively high [20]. Among them, the energy required by Eq. (6) is the lowest [34]. Combined with the previously described equations, we speculate that the particles and gas products produced by the initial decomposition of ethanol and water molecules were CH3CHOH, H, CH3CH2O, CH3, CH2OH, C2H5, OH, CH4, CH2O, CH3CHO, and H2. The radicals with the heavy molecular weight (CH3CHOH, CH3CH2O, CH3, CH2OH, C2H5, CH2O, and CH3CHO) further decomposed under the continuous action of electrons and free radicals to produce small molecular weight free radicals (CH2, CH, C2, C, H, and OH). The interactions between these low molecular weight radicals eventually formed stable gas-phase products (H2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and CO2) and possible liquid phase products. (1) C2H5OH + e∗ → CH3CHOH + H + e (2) C2H5OH + e∗ → CH3CH2O + H + e (3) C2H5OH + e∗ → CH3 + CH2OH + e (4) C2H5OH + e∗→C2H5 + OH + e (5) H2O + e∗ → OH + H + e (6) C2H5OH + e∗ → CH4 + CH2O + e (7) C2H5OH + e∗ → CH3CHO + H2 + e 3.3.2 Formation of gas-phase products 3.3.2.1 Formation of H2 The possible reactions between free radicals and the associated reaction energy (300 K) produced by the decomposition of ethanol are summarized in Table 2 [18,19,35,36]. Judging from the action energy in Table 2, most of the free radical reactions induced by plasma were exothermic reactions and thermodynamically favored. Among producing H2, Eqs. 8-28, the reaction energies of Eqs. 8 and 9–11 (−133.0 and −104.2 kcal/mol) were relatively significant and more thermodynamically favored, that is, Eqs. 8 and 9–11 (CH2 + CH2 → H2 + C2H2 and H + H (+M) → H2 (+M), H + H + H2→ H2 + H2, H + H + H2O → H2 + H2O) were the most likely pathway for H2 production. In fact, the experimental results, as we expected, also showed that there was a linear relationship between CH2 or H and H2 (Fig. 7 a), where X-axis is the relative intensity of the OES of the active species (CH2 and H), and the Y-axis is the relative intensity of MS of H2. However, the H atom reacted with O2 (Eq. 56) to produce the inactive HO2 radicals, which resulted in the chain termination of the active radicals [18]. Later, HO2 reacted with active free radicals (H, OH, and O) in Eqs. 57–63, and these reactions further reduced the concentration of H, OH, and O. 3.3.2.2 Formation of CO Among the many reactions for CO (Eqs. 12, 16, 24 and 29–42), Eqs. 29 and 30 (O + CH → H + CO, OH + C → H + CO, −176.6 and, −155 kcal/mol) have relatively high reaction energy and both are exothermic reactions, which are the most likely thermodynamic paths for CO. Experiments that demonstrated both CH or C and CO had a good linear relationship (Fig. 7b). The reaction energies of Eqs. 31, 32, 33, and 12 are too high and all are related to HCO radicals. Therefore, we believe that HCO is also an important radical for producing CO and H2 although HCO was not detected in the spectrum to quantify. 3.3.2.3 Formation of CH4 CH4 may be produced by two main ways. The first is the direct decomposition of ethanol molecules (Eq. (6), which has a relatively high probability of occurring because it requires the lowest energy among Eqs. (1)–(7). Another way is proposed by Eq. 43 (H + CH3 (+M) → CH4 (+M) at −105.1 kcal/mol), which is more thermodynamically favored because it has a relatively high reaction energy compared with the other equations (Eqs. 32, 33, 38, 39, and 44–46) for generating CH4. CH4 is produced at the same time as CH2O in Eq. (6). Further direct decomposition of CH2O is also a primary way to generate H2 and CO because the energy required for the decomposition is relatively low [20]. Therefore, this reaction pathway cannot be ignored. 3.3.2.4 Formation of C2H2 and C2H4 The C2H2 and C2H4 production paths were mainly derived from Eqs.8, 47, and 49 respectively (CH2 + CH2→ H2 + C2H2, CH + CH2 → H + C2H2, CH2(S) + CH3 → H + C2H4, -133.0, −129.9 and −73.2 kcal/mol). The linear correlation between the related free radicals and the products was confirmed (Fig. 7c) and (Fig. 7d). Also, the higher reaction energy made it impossible to ignore the contribution of Eq. 48 to C2H2(C + CH3 → H + C2H2 and -99.8 kcal/mol). In contrast, judging from the reaction energy, C2H2 is more thermodynamically favored than C2H4. 3.3.2.5 Formation of CO2 The CO2 production mainly came from Eq. 52 (OH + CO → H + CO2 and -24.9 kcal/mol). When the amount of water molecules in the system was relatively high, the probability of water molecules being decomposed increased, so a relatively large amount of OH radicals was generated, which caused the OH to react with C atoms to generate CO (Eq. 30) and the CO was further oxidized by OH to generate CO2 (Eq. 52). When the volume fraction of water in the system was low, the amount of OH radicals produced by the decomposition of water molecules decreased correspondingly, resulting in a lower probability of further oxidation of CO by OH to produce CO2. This also explained why the response value of CO2, a product of deep oxidation, decreased gradually when there was a higher volume fraction of ethanol (Fig. 5). 3.3.2.6 Formation of C2 The C2 generation pathway may come from Eq. 54 (C + C + M → C2 + M) based on the finding that there was a significant linear correlation between C and C2 (Fig. 7e). The analysis of each product’s production path was mainly based on the assumption that the temperature was 300 K because we assumed that the gas phase products formed easily in the gas-liquid boundary region where the electron energy was relatively low. The temperature in this region tended to be to the saturation temperature of the liquid, which was close to 300 K. In fact, there was a considerable temperature difference between the plasma region and the liquid. Although this assumption may be quite different from reality, the free radical reaction energy used in the thermodynamic analysis generally had a certain synchronism with the temperature changes, so the error in the reaction temperature did not cause significant misdirection. 3.3.3 Reaction path analysis Based on the analysis, the possible reaction path caused by microwave discharge in ethanol solution was provided (Fig. 8 ). H and CH2 are important free radicals for the production of H2, while CH, C, and CH3 are essential sources for the production of CO, CH4, and C2H4. Therefore, promoting the formation of H and CH2 and inhibiting the formation of CH, C, and CH3 are conducive to increasing the unit yield of H2 and reducing the production of by-products."
6,Conclusion,"In this study, we examined the active species and gas-phase products produced by microwave discharge in an ethanol solution. We quantitatively analyzed the correlation between the active species’ spectral signals and the gas phase products’ mass spectrometry signals. From the perspective of thermodynamics, the most likely path of gas-phase production was verified by experiments. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The intermediate active species generated by the discharge primarily included OH, C2, CH2, CH, C, and H; the gas phase products primarily included H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H2, and CO2. (2) There were significant linear relationships between H or CH2 and H2, between CH or C and CO, between CH or CH2 and C2H2, between CH2 and C2H4, and between C and C2, respectively. (3) In terms of the production pathway of H2, reaction H + H (+M) → H2 (+M), H + H + H2 → H2 + H2, H + H + H2O → H2 + H2O, and CH2 + CH2 → H2 + C2H2 were the most likely to occur. For the CO generation pathway, O + CH → H + CO and OH + C → H + CO were the most likely to occur. Regarding the production of C2H2 and C2H4, CH + CH2 → H + C2H2, CH2 + CH2 → H2 + C2H2, and CH2(S) + CH3 → H + C2H4 were most likely to occur. In theory, promoting the production of H and CH2 is conducive to increasing the yield of H2, and inhibiting the formation of CH, CH3, and C is conducive to reducing the production of by-products (CO, CH4, and C2H4)."
