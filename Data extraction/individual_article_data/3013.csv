0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been considered as a potential energy carrier, however 95% of all hydrogen production currently relies on fossil fuel feedstocks via the thermo-catalytic processes and gasification of methane, napthas, and coal [1]. Concerns over carbon emissions and depletion of fossil fuel reserves have led many researchers to investigate carbon neutral renewable biomass feedstocks for hydrogen production [2–4]. A recent review comparing the economic feasibility of several hydrogen production strategies found hydrogen production from the thermochemical processing of biomass to have a lower cost of hydrogen per kilogram than current wind, solar, or nuclear technologies [5]. Traditional gasification technologies require several additional steps not necessary in the supercritical water gasification scheme presented here. For example, the energy intensive grinding and drying of biomass prior to gasification is not required with sub- or supercritical water (SCW) technologies, and the amount of tarry material is greatly reduced, owing to SCW’s ability to solubilize nonpolar tar precursor compounds [6]. Further, hydrogen is obtained directly at high pressure, eliminating the need for compression of the gas before storage. In this work we use a feedstock of aqueous oxygenated hydrocarbons termed biocrude, where switchgrass was partially solubilized in sub-critical water. In the sub-critical region water has an increased ionic character and the preferred reaction pathway includes the formation of phenols and furfurals [7]. Details of the biocrude production have been published by Kumar and Gupta [8]. In the gasification of biocrude the maximum theoretical hydrogen yield would be attained by suppressing methanation and having the water–gas shift go to near completion, giving approximately 2 mol H2/mol C. Examples of the desired reactions are shown in Equations (1)–(3) for glucose, furfural, and catechol, respectively: (1) C6H12O6 + 6 H2O → 12 H2 + 6 CO2 Yield: 2 H2/C (2) C5H4O2 + 8 H2O → 10 H2 + 5 CO2 Yield: 2 H2/C (3) C6H6O2 + 10 H2O → 13 H2 + 6 CO2 Yield: 2.17 H2/C This approach of using solubilized biomass instead of whole biomass has received some attention in the literature. Matsumura et al. liquefied cellulose and cabbage at 150 °C under autogeneous pressure and gasified the aqueous product with partial oxidation at 400 °C and 25 MPa in a batch system over a commercial Ni catalyst and several mixed oxides from the lanthanide series. The oxides did not effectively catalyze gasification or oxidation of tars, whereas the nickel catalyst gave a 68% gasification efficiency and was active in both the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction and methanation [13]. Elliott et al. have taken a similar approach, liquefying several biomass feedstocks then gasifying them at 350 °C and 20 MPa over Ru/C catalyst, obtaining a product gas composed mostly of methane and carbon dioxide. They studied continuous systems, both on the bench scale as well as a scaled up mobile reactor system. They encountered problems with reactor plugging, as well as catalyst deactivation from trace elements present in the biomass feed [14]. Recently another approach has been taken by studying the aqueous phase reforming of hydrolyzed wheat straw in a batch reactor and the results showed Raney nickel to be more active than supported noble metal catalysts [15]. Osada et al. have previously found Ru/TiO2 catalysts to be active and stable in the gasification of lignin in a batch reactor at 400 °C and 371 bar. They achieved complete gasification in 120 min, obtaining a gas rich in CO2 and CH4. Both Ru/C and Ru/γ-Al2O3 were seen to lose surface area due to gasification or phase transformations of the support, respectively [9]. Yu and Savage reported that after 100 h in supercritical water oxidation service at 380 °C and 250 atm a mixed rutile/anatase support had completely transformed to rutile [10]. Elliott et al. found that commercial titania tablets lost their mechanical strength after water exposure at 350 °C and 200 bar and also report all anatase titania being transformed to the rutile form, while monoclinic zirconia was reported to be stable [11,12]. The formation of tar and char materials from biomass components and model compounds has been investigated by several researchers. For example, Sato et al. studied the noncatalyzed alkylation of phenol by alcohols and aldehydes in SCW [16–18]. Saisu et al. later expanded on this work to include the repolymerization of lignin decomposition products by cross-linking with formaldehyde, as well as between the decomposition products themselves [19]. Chuntanapum and Matsumura have recently clarified the role of 5-HMF in tarry materials formation, finding polyaromatic char formation occurring only in the sub-critical condition, resulting from polymerization of 5-HMF and it aromatic degradation products [20,21]. In our previous work we have gasified model and biomass derived compounds [22–24]. Here we will extend the field of knowledge on the catalytic gasification of real liquefied biomass for hydrogen production, studying nickel, cobalt, and ruthenium catalysts on titania, zirconia, and magnesium aluminum spinel supports. A focus of this work is to understand the activity of the catalyst and stability of the support materials in supercritical water."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation TiO2 and ZrO2 supports were supplied by St. Gobain Norpro as pellets. MgAl2O4 was prepared by coprecipitation from aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (98%, Sigma Aldrich) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (99%, Sigma Aldrich) following the method of Bocanegra et al. [25]. All supports were crushed and sieved to particle sizes between 150 and 600 μm. Metals were loaded onto the supports by an incipient wetness technique. Precursor materials for metals were nickel nitrate hexahydrate (98%, Alfa Aesar), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (98%, Alfa Aesar), and ruthenium (III) nitrosyl nitrate (1.5% Ru, Strem Chemicals). Following impregnation, catalyst samples were dried at 110 °C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 4 h. Prior to each experiment, a fresh 4 g portion of catalyst was reduced in situ at 500 °C for 2 h in a stream of 5% H2 in helium flowing at 0.2 Nl/min. All nickel and cobalt catalysts were prepared to have 10 wt% metals loading, while the ruthenium catalysts had a 1.5 wt% metals loading. A smaller metal loading was used with ruthenium catalysts due to concern over the high cost of ruthenium."
3,Feedstock preparation,"2.2 Feedstock preparation Switchgrass was treated in sub-critical water at 300 °C and 100 bar for 30 min with no additional catalyst in a batch reactor to give an aqueous solution of oxygenated hydrocarbons termed biocrude. Biocrude is not extremely stable and some carbon precipitated during refrigerated storage, as has been noted by other researchers [21]. Precipitated particles were removed from the biocrude prior to a run by vacuum filtration through a 2.5 μm filter paper. Depending on the age of the biocrude it contained 1.0–1.3 wt% carbon, and an approximate composition is given in Table 1 . For details of the experimental procedure and characterization of solid and liquid products, see Kumar and Gupta [8]."
4,Experimental procedure,"2.3 Experimental procedure A schematic of the experimental apparatus used for hydrogen production is shown in Fig. 1 . After the catalyst reduction period, the reactor and apparatus were pressurized with water while the temperature of the furnace was raised such that a thermocouple at the midpoint of the 6.4 mm OD × 3.2 mm ID × 50 cm Inconel 600 reactor read 600 °C. After 1 h, the water feed to the reactor was replaced with biocrude fed directly to the reactor with no preheating at 0.6 ml/min, resulting in a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 9 h−1. Thirty minutes were allowed to elapse between the introduction of the biocrude feed and the start of product sampling. The reactor effluent was quenched by a double pipe heat exchanger with water on the shell side. Pressure control in the system was accomplished by two back pressure regulators in series, the first set at 250 bar and the second at 100 bar. This arrangement reduced pressure fluctuations in the reactor caused by two phase flow through the back pressure regulator. Product gases were separated from the liquid effluent in a glass phase separator before online sampling by a GC equipped with TCD (SRI 8610C). The carbon content of the liquid effluent was measured by a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCSN), and gas flow was measured by an inverted beaker type flowmeter. Gas composition and flow were measured at least five times over the course of a run. Error in the gas yields is reported as the standard deviation of the measured gas flow, all other experimentally measured quantities having very low variability. X-ray spectra were collected on a Rigaku diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα1 radiation source, graphite monochromator, and miniflex goniometer. The diffractometer was run at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current, and scanned at 5°/min with 0.05° step size. Specific surface areas and pore volume data were determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K after outgassing for 3 h at 300 °C on a Quantachrome NOVA 2200e. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Zeiss EVO 50. The samples were scattered onto two sided adhesive carbon tape on an aluminum stub, followed by a sputter coat of gold using an Electron Microscopy Services EMS 550× sputterer. Thermogravimetric data was collected on a TA Instruments TGA Q5000 under air flow of 120 ml/min."
5,Results,"The major product gases formed were hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of carbon monoxide, ethane, and ethylene. Gas yields for titania and zirconia supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 , while gasification efficiency, carbon remaining in the aqueous effluent and closure of the carbon balance are given in Table 2 . Gas yields are reported as moles of gas formed per mole of carbon reacted, as measured by the difference between the total organic carbon content of the biocrude feed and reactor effluent. The gasification efficiency (GE) is defined as moles of carbon in the product gases divided by the moles of carbon in the feed. Residual aqueous carbon is defined as carbon concentration of the liquid effluent divided by the feed carbon concentration. The carbon balance is defined as the carbon exiting the system in the aqueous and gaseous phases divided by the input carbon flowrate. Over the course of a typical 2 h run, the pressure drop across the reactor for zirconia supported catalysts was seen to steadily increase from approximately 5 bar at the start of the run to 100 bar when the experiment would be aborted. This large increase in pressure drop was not an issue for titania supported catalysts in the timeframe of experiments conducted. No results are presented for gas yields from MgAl2O4 supported catalysts, as these each plugged and overpressurized the reactor before any measurements could be taken, typically within 20 min of operation. To ensure that the plugging of the reactor was not related to sintering during the initial water pressurization, this period was extended to 3 h. Again no increase in pressure drop was seen until biocrude feed was introduced. Based on these results we find MgAl2O4 to be an inappropriate support for gasification of biocrude. However, the stability of MgAl2O4 in SCW has received no attention in the literature and will be discussed herein. Ruthenium catalysts gave greatly differing results depending on the support. The second highest hydrogen yield was seen from Ru/TiO2, however with Ru/ZrO2 the product gas contains very little hydrogen, consisting almost entirely of methane and carbon dioxide. The poor closure of the carbon balance along with the lack of carbon in the liquid effluent stream point to extensive char formation over this catalyst formulation. Incomplete conversion of carbon in the liquid phase was seen for all of the titania supported catalysts, as can be seen from comparing the residual aqueous carbon in Table 2. Zirconia itself is known to have catalytic activity in the gasification of biomass [26,27], and as such does not simply act as an inert support. The highest observed hydrogen yield of 0.98 mol H2/mol C was obtained with Ni/ZrO2, as was the lowest methane yield. A lower hydrogen yield of 0.67 was obtained with Ni/TiO2, however the yield of methane was only slightly higher. Small amounts of ethane and ethylene were also detected in the product gas over the Ni/TiO2 catalyst. The third highest hydrogen yield of 0.68 was achieved with the Co/ZrO2 catalyst. Co/TiO2 was the only catalyst to give a significant yield of carbon monoxide, not surprising since cobalt has a low activity for the water–gas shift reaction [28]. Over Co/ZrO2, however, little CO was detected. The increased activity of the water–gas shift may be due to strong metal support interactions between cobalt and zirconia, as has been observed for gold on zirconia [29]. Yields of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ethane were higher for Co/ZrO2 than Co/TiO2, as was the overall gasification efficiency."
6,Crystalline structure,"3.1 Crystalline structure The stability of the crystalline structure of the catalyst supports was studied by XRD before and after exposure to SCW. Fig. 3 shows X-ray spectra for zirconia supported catalysts. The diffraction patterns show that the monoclinic crystal structure of the zirconia was unchanged in the hydrothermal conditions, although in each case the peaks are more intense and have a smaller full width at half maximum after exposure to SCW, indicating a more uniform crystallinity after SCW exposure. After calcination a diffraction peak at 43.4° for NiO is present in the Ni/ZrO2 sample, while the used catalyst instead shows a peak for Ni at 44.8°. No diffraction peaks are visible for cobalt, ruthenium, or their oxides. The X-ray spectra of titania supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . The anatase structure is still the dominant phase after being on stream; however another unidentified pattern not corresponding to rutile or brookite is apparent after SCW exposure for Ni/TiO2 and Co/TiO2. NiO is seen in the calcined Ni/TiO2 sample, while no peaks corresponding to Ni or NiO are seen in the used sample. Fig. 5 shows X-ray spectra of the freshly calcined and used catalysts supported on MgAl2O4. Reflections from the MgAl2O4 structure dominate all the spectra both before and after SCW exposure with the peaks becoming narrower and more intense after SCW exposure, indicating a greater degree of crystallinity. Each MgAl2O4 supported catalyst also shows an additional phase of α-Al2O3 after SCW exposure, characterized by the peak at about 43.3°. Additional unidentified peaks at 2θ = 12.1°, 28.5°, 35.7°, and 54.8° are seen in the calcined Ru/MgAl2O4 sample after which are not present after exposure to supercritical water. These may be some artifact from the preparation method."
7,Surface area,"3.2 Surface area Surface area, average pore radius, and pore volume were measured for the supports before impregnation, after new catalyst calcination, and of used catalyst from near the entrance and exit of the reactor. These results are given in Table 3 . The surface area of each catalyst was decreased after metals impregnation and calcination. The ruthenium catalysts, which had a 1.5 wt% metals loading, showed a smaller loss of surface area than the nickel or cobalt catalysts, both of which had a 10 wt% metals loading. A similar trend is seen in the pore volume, where each ruthenium catalyst had a small decrease in pore volume and a larger decrease for the nickel and cobalt catalysts. This indicates that metals blocked access to some of the smallest pores, decreasing the total accessible volume and correspondingly the available surface area. Surface area of the used catalysts varied whether the catalyst sample is taken from near the entrance or the exit of the reactor. Samples taken from the reactor entrance show a marked increase in surface area, while those from near the exit show a large decrease. As the biocrude is heated in the entrance zone of the reactor it forms char particles on the catalyst surface. These carbon deposits are responsible for the apparent increase in surface area of the used catalyst. At the downstream end of the reactor the temperature is higher than the entrance zone. Little charring takes place in this zone and the surface area decrease is due to sintering in the hydrothermal environment. The pore radius data for the three supports suggests this. Smaller pore sizes are seen at the entrance as they become plugged, while the collapse of small pores at the downstream end results in larger average pore sizes."
8,Particle size and morphology,"3.3 Particle size and morphology Representative SEM images of Ni/ZrO2 taken from the entrance and exit of the catalytic bed are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. The surface of the catalyst sample taken from the entrance of the reactor is covered and obstructed by char materials. The sample taken from the end of the reactor lacks much of this additional material and is charred to a lesser degree. A similar situation occurs with samples taken from the entrance and exit of the Ni/TiO2 bed, shown in Figs. 8 and 9 , respectively. The surface of the Ni/TiO2 catalyst from the entrance has a uniform covering of char particles. Larger agglomerates are seen at the downstream end, although the covering is not as thorough."
9,Thermo-gravimetric analysis,"3.4 Thermo-gravimetric analysis Used nickel catalysts were selected for further analysis by TGA. Samples of the catalyst were taken from the entrance and exit of the catalytic bed and heated at 10 °C/min to 600 °C in an air atmosphere. Differing weight losses were seen from catalyst samples at the entrance and exit of the reactor for each support, and are given in Table 4 . Weight loss associated with the burning of carbon deposits occurred over the range 200–400 °C for Ni/TiO2 and Ni/MgAl2O4, with the maximum rate of weight loss at 300 °C. Ni/ZrO2 lost weight over the range 300–500 °C with the maximum rate of weight loss at 440 °C. The large weight loss from MgAl2O4 after only 20 min on stream indicates the strong tendency for charring over this support, although no quantifiable amount was observed from the sample taken from the downstream end of the reactor. After a 2 h period on stream, Ni/ZrO2 was seen to have over twice the amount of carbon as Ni/TiO2. A small amount of weight loss was detected from the end of the bed of Ni/TiO2, whereas none was observed from Ni/ZrO2."
10,Discussion,"To understand the charring behavior of the complex biocrude feedstock we examine the literature on model biomass compounds. In the supercritical water gasification of glucose, a fast heating rate is known to increase gasification efficiency [30] as well as enhance hydrogen yield [31]. Obviously with a slow heating rate the reactants will spend more time in a sub-critical water environment before the critical temperature is reached. In the sub-critical region furfurals and phenolic compounds can react to form higher molecular weight compounds, while direct gasification is preferred above the critical point [7]. The intermediate compound 5-hydroxymethylfurfural has been observed to form high molecular weight char in sub-critical water at 25 MPa and 350 °C, but is completely gasified in supercritical water at 450 °C. In our system carbon deposition in the catalyst bed occurred mainly near the entrance of the reactor in each instance. This was suggested by the decrease in pore size seen in catalyst samples taken from the reactor entrance and confirmed by weight loss from TGA. The biocrude was fed to the reactor at room temperature without preheating, and it follows that the carbon deposition occurred while the reactants were being heated. It was not expected that MgAl2O4 supported catalysts would char and plug as quickly as they did. It is generally thought that surfaces with higher acidity tend to coke more quickly in steam reforming reactions. Accordingly, basic MgO is often added to Al2O3 catalyst supports. The reason for the rapid charring of the MgAl2O4 supported catalysts is at this point unclear, but perhaps this points to the need for the study of the surfaces of metal oxides in the presence of supercritical water. Crystallographically, the monoclinic zirconia support was stable in supercritical water, although BET analysis of a portion of each catalyst taken from the downstream end of the reactor lost approximately half of its surface area through sintering. As discussed above, there are varying reports on the stability of the tetragonal phase of titania in the high temperature and pressure hydrothermal environment in the literature. In this work the structure of the commercial anatase titania used was found to be stable at 250 bar and 600 °C. We note that in previous studies, titania supports containing a mix of anatase and rutile transform to exclusively to rutile after exposure to hot compressed water, while pure anatase is stable under the hydrothermal conditions examined. In the case of the mixed phase titania supports it is likely that the presence of the rutile phase acts as a seed allowing anatase to transform at a lower temperature. The MgAl2O4 supported catalysts also sintered in the hydrothermal environment, each losing approximately half of their surface area after a short exposure to SCW. An α-Al2O3 phase was seen to appear after exposure to SCW, however the origin of this phase is unclear from X-ray analysis. The alumina could have originated from the MgAl2O4 itself, however it is also possible that some amorphous alumina, which is not detectable by XRD, existed following the preparation of the support and crystallized during the exposure to supercritical water."
11,Conclusions,"Liquefied switchgrass was gasified over nickel, cobalt, and ruthenium catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, and MgAl2O4 at 600 °C and 250 bar with a WHSV of 9 h−1. Catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 charred immediately and were found to be an inappropriate support for biocrude reforming. A given metal supported on ZrO2 gave a higher conversion of biocrude than those supported on TiO2, although charring at the face of the catalyst bed led to reactor plugging within a few hours for ZrO2 supported catalysts. Char formation occurred to the smallest degree over TiO2 supports. The highest hydrogen yield was obtained with Ni/ZrO2, while the lowest was with Ru/ZrO2, which gave a product gas composed of mostly methane and CO2. The lowest gasification efficiency was seen with Ru/ZrO2 due to extensive char formation. Co/TiO2 was the only catalyst to give a significant CO yield. The anatase titania and monoclinic zirconia were crystallographically stable, but both lost significant amounts of surface area through hydrothermal sintering. Following SCW exposure MgAl2O4 also sintered and was found to partially transform to α-Al2O3."
