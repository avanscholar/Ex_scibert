0,Introduction,"For its unique chemical and physical properties, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) has been widely used in fiber, biomaterial and so on [1–4]. The existence of a large number of hydroxyl groups in PVA make them distinct from other polymers, because the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups plays an important role in generating these properties such as the crystallinity, water solubility and formation of the site for chemical reaction or complexation reaction [5–8]. A representative and important application of PVA is the polarizer [9–11], which is mainly produced by stretching PVA in the aqueous solution with boric acid and potassium iodide to form the 1D aligned PVA-I complex based on the interaction with hydroxyl groups [12–14]. During the practical production process [15–19], the processing parameters (temperature, draw ratio, the concentration of boric acid and potassium iodide), which will tune the microstructure and the content of PVA crystal and dichroic substance, are the determinants of the dichromatic performance of PVA polarizer. So far, several works have been conducted on the structural evolution of PVA in KI/I2 solution during stretching [20–22]. By means of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), Miyazaki et al. carried out an in-situ experiment on the structural evolution of PVA stretched in water and observed the transformation from lamellae to nanofibrils. They also found that the iodine absorbed into amorphous of PVA works as junction points between the microfibers during stretching PVA films in KI/I2 solution, however, these SAXS and WAXS experiments were conducted on the stretched samples after dried in the oven because of the strong absorption of KI/I2 solution. In our previous papers, the structural evolution of PVA by stretching the film in water at different temperatures and concentrations of potassium iodide has also been investigated by in-situ synchrotron radiation SAXS and WAXS. It is found that before strain hardening stretch induces the melting of PVA crystal and the nanofibrils emerge at the onset of stress plateau, which proceeds via a melting-reconstruction process. The rise of temperature leads to a more ideal packing of nanofibrils and a larger inter-fibrillar spacing, which may benefit the production of the polarizer with better dichroism properties [23]. Furthermore, the stretch-induced fibrillation and complexation reaction between PVA and iodine are determined by the synergistic effect of stretching and the concentration of iodine [24]. Apart from the KI/I2, in the practical production process, boric acid is one of the additives which can accelerate the formation of the PVA-I complex and interrupt the PVA crystallization during stretching according to previous reports [17–19,25–27]. In Yang Hun Lee's work, by comparing the difference of the film iodinated at solution state before casting (BIBC film) and the film iodinated after casting (BIAC film), they found that the crystal structure of BIAC was not affected by boric acid, while in the BIBC film, the intra-molecular cross-links of boric acid accelerated the PVA-I complex and interrupted the crystallization. Kumiko Ohishi et al. was trying to reveal the role of boric acid in the formation of PVA-I complex in undrawn films, they found that boric acid could suppress the re-crystallization of PVA and promote the formation of PVA-I complex especially in the surficial areas of crystallites. However, the above researches are carried out under a complex circumstance which contains not only boric acid but also iodine. It is hard to find the influence of boric acids on PVA as it may be blocked by the iodine. The structural evolution of PVA during uniaxial stretch in the aqueous solution with boric acid has not fully explored yet, especially for in-situ study. Miyazaki and coworkers [28,29] found that boric acid can accelerate the orientation of the molecular chain in amorphous and hinder strain-induced crystallization which contributes to increase the content of oriented amorphous. This work indicates that the addition of boric acid not only benefits the mechanical properties but also the optical properties. However, they didn't explicitly address the relationship between the mechanical behaviors of PVA and the microstructure evolution induced by stretch and boric acid, which determines the process parameters and predicts the optical properties, since the polarizing properties stem from the strain induced fibrillation and PVA-I complexation reaction. In this work, in order to establish the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties, in-situ synchrotron radiation SAXS and WAXS have been employed to investigate the structural evolution of PVA film stretched in the aqueous solution with the different concentrations of boric acid. According to the mechanical behaviors and WAXD and SAXS results, the mechanical and structural evolution during stretching PVA at different concentrations of boric acid and the formation of nanofibrils accelerated by boric acid are discussed."
1,Experimental section,
2,Material and preparation,"2.1 Material and preparation The boric acid was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification. The PVA films are a commercial product with a thickness of 80 ationd kindly supplied by Wanwei Updated High-Tech Material Industry Co., Ltd. The number-average and weight-average molecular weight (Mn and Mw) are 60 and 120 kg/mol, respectively. The saponification degree is larger than 99 mol%. The triad tacticity (mm = 0.20, mr = 0.51, rr = 0.29) is determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy in the solution state [30,31]. The films are soaked in the aqueous solution with the concentrations of boric acid at 0.3 wt%, 1 wt% and 3 wt% for 20 h to reach an absorption equilibrium before stretching. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, eight layers of the film are stacked with a thickness of 0.64 mm."
3,Extension experiment and X-ray measurement,"2.2 Extension experiment and X-ray measurement A home-made extension rheometer [23] with a water bath is employed to impose extensional flow, which has been described in details in our previous papers. The samples are clamped by clamps and stretched at the deformation rate of 0.2 mm/s in the aqueous solution with the concentrations of boric acid at 0.3 wt%, 1 wt%, and 3 wt%. The force is collected by a load cell during the stretching. The structural evolution is monitored by in-situ synchrotron radiation SAXS and WAXS at the beamline BL16B of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with Pilatus 300K. The sample-to-detector distances for SAXS and WAXS are calibrated to be 1750 and 73.3 mm, respectively. The X-ray wavelength was set at 0.103 nm to reduce the absorption of water. The time resolution of 20 s is employed for both the SAXS and WAXS measurements. Fit2D software from European synchrotron radiation facility was used to analyze the SAXS and WAXS data, which are firstly corrected by subtracting the background scattering of air and aqueous solution."

5,Mechanical behavior of PVA films,"3.1 Mechanical behavior of PVA films The engineering stress-strain curve (3) and its derivative curve (dσ/dε-ε) of the PVA films stretched in the aqueous solution at the boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt% are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Similar to the s stretched in ich are firstly corrected by le-to-detector distances for SAXS and WAX increases linearly at first and then enters an ephemeral platform and eventually reaches the strain-hardening zone. For the dσ/dε-ε curve, the dσ/dε keeps decreasing until the strain reaches 1, denoting the end of the ephemeral plateau in σol curve, and then after that the decreasing trend of d concentration of 0.3 wt% are increase, indicating that a structural transition may occur at this strain. Fig. 1 (b) shows the strain-stress curves of the films in the aqueous solution with different concentrations of boric acid. It should be noted that the mechanical transition appears at the strain of 0.8 and 0.4 at the boric acid concentrations of 1 and 3 wt%, respectively. The method to determine the mechanical transition point is the same with that employed for the sample at the boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt%. The films are not broken during stretching due to the limited space of the stretching machine. Fig. 2 depicts the representative 2D SAXS and 2D WAXS patterns of the PVA films collected in-situ during stretching in the aqueous solution with different boric acid concentrations (0.3 wt%, 1 wt%, 3 wt%). The red dash line indicates the structural transition point by mechanical curves. The stretching direction is horizontal, as indicated with the red double-head arrow. At the beginning of stretching, the 2D SAXS patterns show the isotropic scattering maxima at low concentration, indicating a random orientation of the lamellar crystals of PVA. While at high concentration, it shows that scattering maxima tend to concentrate in meridian, which means the low orientation of lamellar crystals. This indicates that the PVA films become more sensitive to the strain with the increase of boric acid concentration. Before strain reaching the transition point, the SAXS intensity in the equator direction decreases quickly, while in the meridian direction the intensity shows the inverse trend. Further increasing strain over the transition point, two equatorial scattering streaks will appear gradually. The scattering streaks are considered as the signal of lamellae transforming into nanofibrils rather than the generation of voids according to previous studies [21]. Corresponding to the SAXS patterns, the 2D WAXS patterns show that the crystalline diffraction concentrates in the equator direction with the increase of strain, which matches well with the formation of nanofibrils. Interestingly, with increasing concentration of boric acid, nanofibrils emerge at a lower strain, indicating that the addition of boric acid will contribute to the structural evolution."
6,In-situ WAXS measurements,"3.2 In-situ WAXS measurements To obtain the evolution of crystallinity during stretching, 2D WAXS patterns are integrated into 1D diffraction curves. Fig. 3 a is an example of multi-peak fitting of 1D WAXS curves at 0.3 wt%, which can be decomposed into two crystalline peaks (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) and 200) and an amorphous halo [32]. Through peak-fitting, the bulk crystallinity in WAXS is calculated by the following formula [33]: (1) χ C = ∑ A c ∑ A c + ∑ A a where Ac and Aa are the integrated area of crystallinity and amorphous peak, respectively. The crystallinity calculated with equation (1) is summarized in Fig. 3b, which show that the crystallinity barely changes before the strain reaches around 0.5, and then follows a monotonic decrease from 20.4% to 14.7%. To highlight and enhance the signal intensity in equator direction, the integration only covers a small area as shown in Fig. 4 a. The 1D WAXS curves integrated from Fig. 4a are plotted in Fig. 4b for the sample at 0.3 wt% boric acid concentration. With the red arrow guidance, it is distinct that the diffraction angle (2θ) of (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) ) doesn't change monotonically in the whole stretching process. According to the Bragg's Law, the lattice spacing of (101) crystal plane (d 101 ) is quantitatively calculated and shown in Fig. 4c with the increase of strain. As shown in Fig. 4c, the evolution of d 101 can be divided into 3 parts, in which the strains of 0.5 and 1.0 denote the two transition points, respectively. Before the strain reaches 0.5, the d 101 keeps decreasing with the increase of strain, and then enters a platform. However, when the strain comes to 1.0, the d-spacing begin to rise with increasing the strain, which also denotes the onset of the third part. As the 2D WAXS patterns shown, stretching induced the crystalline diffraction peaks gathered in equator direction indicates the formation of highly oriented lamellae crystal perpendicular to the stretching direction. To quantitatively track stretching induced orientation of the crystal [5,23,29,34], the azimuthal intensity distribution of (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) ) diffraction at different strain is shown in Fig. 5 (a) for the sample of 0.3 wt%, where the 180° represents the meridian direction. Before strain enters into the 1, the azimuthal intensity distribution of (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) ) diffraction shows a broad peak located at 270° (equator direction). As the strain increases, the azimuthal intensity distribution of (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) ) in equator direction can be regarded as a superposition of two peaks. Indeed, Fig. 5b shows that the azimuthal intensity distribution of the (101/10 1 ( _ _ ) ) diffraction at the strain of 1.97 can be fitted with two Gaussian peaks, implying that orientation of crystal is not homogeneous. The narrow peak which appears at high strain represents the OC. Thus, the relative content of OC is calculated by the ratio of the peak area of OC and other crystals. Fig. 5c presents the relative content of OC during stretching PVA film in the aqueous solution with a boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt%. Before strain enters into 1.0, the sole broad peak located at 270° indicates that OC doesn't appear. Further increasing strain, OC emerges and increases nearly linearly with strain."
7,In-situ SAXS measurements,"3.3 In-situ SAXS measurements For a better view of the SAXS peaks in different azimuthal direction, two integration manners are adopted, which only covers a small range of azimuthal angle in the meridian and equator direction, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 a. Considering the disk shape of lamellae, Lorentz correction [35] is introduced on the scattering intensity by multiply q 2. Fig. 6b shows the contour map of 1D integrated SAXS curves in meridian during stretching PVA film in the aqueous solution with a boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt%. As indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 6b, the scattering maximum which originates from the periodically packed lamellae crystals firstly shifts to low q and then reverses to large q direction, indicating that the long period of lamellar crystals in meridian increases first and then decreases during the stretching process. The evolution of the long period of lamellar crystals in meridian direction (LM) is plotted with strain and shown in Fig. 7 a. As mentioned above, the OC or nanofibrils are formed in the equator direction during stretching. Considering that the form factor is different between lamellae and nanofibrils, Lorentz correction is introduced on the SAXS intensity by multiplying q 2 and q for lamellae and nanofibrils, respectively [35]. The contour map of Iq2-q and Iq-q at different strain in equator during stretching PVA film at boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt% are plotted in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, the scattering intensity stops to decrease at strain 1.0, which corresponds with the emergence of streak signal in 2D SAXS in Fig. 2 as well as the emergence of OC in Fig. 5 indicating the formation of nanofibrils [21,23,24]. Quantitatively, the evolutions of long period of lamellar crystals (LE) and nanofibrils (LF) in equator calculated from the Bragg law and Iq2-q, Iq-q peak positions are plotted in Fig. 7b. It must be noticed that though part of the signals of SAXS are blocked by the black gap in the detector, the peak position can be found by peak fitting of the rest signal. Based on the above results, stretch-induced evolution of the long period of lamellae shows different feature in each strain zone as well as azimuthal direction. Before strain reaches 1, LM in the meridian increases rapidly with strain and reaches a maximum value of about 22.4 nm and then follows a slight reduction trend in the rest of the whole part. However, LE in the equator decreases with strain and disappears at the strain of 1.0. Meanwhile, the inter-fibrillar spacing of periodic packing nanofibrils decreases drastically from 14.0 to 12.1 nm."
8,Effect of chemical crosslinking agent induced by boric acid,"3.4 Effect of chemical crosslinking agent induced by boric acid To better understand the role of the boric acid during stretching, the structural evolution of PVA was studied in the aqueous solution with boric acid concentrations of 0.3, 1, 3 wt%, and the results are summarized in Fig. 8 (a) - (f). The method of data processing is the same with that employed for the sample at the boric acid concentration of 0.3 wt%. Fig. 8a presents the evolutions of crystallinity [26,40] during stretching at these three concentrations. At the beginning of the stretch, the films are tensile elastically so that the crystallinity shows an ephemeral platform because of the existence of stable crystal. The platform ends in a lower strain with the concentration of boric acid increase. Further increasing strain, the crystallinities show a linearly decreasing. What's more, increasing the addition of boric acid leads to a lower crystallinity. The lattice spacing of (101) crystal plane shown in Fig. 8b provides further insight into the microstructure, which decreases sharply at low strain, then gets into a platform and finally shows an increase trend after the formation of nanofibrils in the aqueous solutions with low (0.3 wt%) and moderate (1.0 wt%) concentrations. However, it keeps decreasing at high concentration (3.0 wt%) of boric with strain. Fig. 8c shows the evolutions of the long period of lamellae in meridian direction with the increase of strain for samples at boric acid concentrations of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 wt%. At low and moderate boric acid concentrations, the evolution of long period shows a nearly same trend that LM increases rapidly with strain and reaches a maximum value around the strain of nanofibrils formation, and then decline slowly. The crystallinity shows a constant decreasing rate so that re-crystallization induced long period evolution can be excluded. So this phenomenon can be explained by the deformation of amorphous reign and then the slippage between the lamellae. However, when it comes to 3.0 wt%, the LM follows a monotonic increasing trend in the whole strain. Considering the crystallinity decrease after the formation of nanofibrils in Fig. 8a, the connections between lamellae gradually break up at low and moderate boric acid concentration for lack of physical and chemical crosslink agents. However, adequate chemical crosslink agents introduced by high concentration of boric acid displace the physical crosslink agents which will maintain the connection between the lamellae. The content of OC which is calculated by the relative content of OC multiplying by the crystallinity at these three concentrations are plotted in Fig. 8d. The OC appear at strain of 1, 0.8 and 0.4 with the concentrations of boric acid of 0.3, 1, 3 wt%, respectively, which correspond well with the strain of emergence of nanofibrils in SAXS patterns indicating that the OC belong to nanofibrils. Though the OC or the nanofibrils appear at lower strain with the concentration of boric acid increase, the increasing rate of the content is slower and the final content is less. It indicates that the formation of nanofibrils has an approximate process of the formation of crystal which has to cross the energy barrier before the crystallization. The addition of boric acid reduces the entropy in the system [36]. According to Gibbs free energy theory, the reducing of entropy leads to a lower energy barrier which makes it easier to form nanofibrils. Nevertheless, the boric acid works as the crosslinking agent which limits the mobility of the molecular chain to form more nanofibrils [37–39]. As mentioned above, the long period evolution in equator direction calculated from 1D SAXS can be divided into two parts which are plotted in Fig. 8e and f. Before the emergence of nanofibrils, the long period of lamellae decreases monotonously in the whole region, and disappear at a lower strain with the concentration of boric acid increase. The inter-fibrillar spacing of periodic packing nanofibrils shows a decreasing trend since it emerges, which can result from the Poisson effect."
9,Discussion,"Current work investigates the structural evolution of PVA during stretching in aqueous solutions with different boric acid concentrations, which is aimed at revealing the role of mechanical stress and boric acid. Combining the structural information from in-situ synchrotron radiation SAXS and WAXS, several interesting results and conclusions can be drawn. (i) The nanofibrils emerge earlier with the increase of boric acid content, however, the final content of nanofibrils is less. (ii) The decreasing trend of crystallinity results from coupling effect of the uniaxial stretch and the addition of boric acid. The crystal almost disappears in the high strain at the boric acid concentration of 3.0 wt%. (iii) Various content of chemical crosslink agents introduced by different concentrations of boric acid protect the crystal network from breaking up in vary degrees. Imposing stretch on PVA results in different mechanical and structural response due to different concentrations of boric acid and the stretch process can be roughly divided in three stages. To illustrate the different nonlinear deformation mechanisms of PVA during stretching clearly, Fig. 9 presents a schematic on the structural evolution of PVA film during stretching at different boric acid concentrations. In the first stage, the films are elastically stretched, the crystallinity keeps constant in all three concentrations of boric acid and the increasing of the long period of lamellae in Meridian is due to the extension of the amorphous region. The evolution of d 101 reveals the lattice spacing contract is in a small scale, the unoriented crystal bears shear effect before entering the second stage, which makes it keep decreasing. Further increasing strain before the formation of nanofibrils, the stretch enters the second stage. The long period of the lamellae in meridian direction remains monotonic increase and the crystallinity show a reverse trend [40–43], however the lattice spacing of (101) plane shows a platform at low and moderate concentrations of boric acid. Perhaps it can be attributed to that the crystals are broken up and transformed into the amorphous so that the shear force applied on the unit cells are gradually reduced. However, d 101 keeps decreasing when it comes to high concentration of boric acid. The results indicate that the boric acid plays a role of linking agent so that the force can be delivered to the unit cell though part of crystals have been broken up. When it comes to the final stage, the effect of boric acid addition reflects in a larger scale. At a low or moderate concentration of boric acid, the long period of lamellae in meridian stops increasing with the crystallinity decrease [2,44–46], which indicates that the evolution of long period can not be attributed to the re-crystallization. The d 101 shows a reverse trend compared to the first stage. The entangled amorphous network becomes the single load-bearing structure [47,48]. However, at high concentration of boric acid, high-density crosslinking agent of boric acid fix the molecular chains of PVA and make the system to be a series model. More specifically, lamellae in meridian direction share the same strain which results in monotone increasing in long period. Last but not least, the formation of nanofibrils can be considered as a stretch-induced nucleation and growth process, the high content of boric acid will reduce the entropy in the system, which will help the polymer cross the energy barrier easier according to Gibbs free energy theory. On the other hand, the molecular chains of PVA are fixed by the crosslinking agent of boric acid, which will reduce the mobility of the molecular chain. Namely, the addition of boric acid will make the formation of nanofibrils easier though the growth of nanofibrils is inhibited. Thus, the growth rate and the final content of nanofibrils at high boric acid concentration is lower than that at low boric acid concentration, though the emergence of nanofibrils is earlier at high boric acid concentration."
10,Conclusion,"In-situ measurements of SAXS and WAXS combined with the extension rheometer are employed to investigate the structural evolution of PVA film during uniaxial stretching in the aqueous solution with concentrations of boric acid at 0.3 wt%, 1 wt%, and 3 wt%. The whole stretch can be defined into three stages with the end of the crystallinity platform and the emergence of nanofibrils as the stage boundaries. Interestingly, increasing the concentration of boric acid can promote the emergence of nanofibrils as well as decrease the content of crystal. The addition of adequate boric acid can maintain the connection between the crystals and benefit the force transmission. In other words, the crystal, as well as the amorphous regions, can be fully stretched rather than slip between each other. Our results demonstrate that the addition of adequate boric acid can lead to a lower crystallinity and a higher orientation in amorphous and crystal regions, which can benefit the performance of polarizer. During the practical production, the addition of boric acid should be coordinated to ensure the orientation of amorphous and crystal regions as well as the draw ratio of PVA films."
