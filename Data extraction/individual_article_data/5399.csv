0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of the global economy, the demand for energy is increasing; this has led to continuously increasing consumption of non-renewable energy sources (e.g., oil, natural gas, and coal). Therefore, there is an urgent global need for the development of new renewable energy sources [1-3]. Hydrogen is well suited to replace fossil fuels as a renewable energy source because it is clean, light weight, easy to transport, and has a high calorific value among other significant characteristics. Thus, it could potentially be used in frontier fields such as aerospace power and renewable-energy-based vehicles, as these fields mandate hydrogen production research and development to guide the research direction for new energy types [4-6]. Among the many methods of hydrogen production, when considering environmental protection, the cheapest and most effective way to convert solar energy to hydrogen is to install a semiconductor photocatalyst in a water solution exposed to direct sunlight [7-10]. Over the past several decades, this method has become the focus for photocatalytic hydrogen production research [11-21]. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) nanoscale materials began receiving much attention as a new type of functional material; this is because it has extremely high electron mobility, a broader optical absorption wavelength, a larger specific surface area, and more catalytic activity compared to its block form [22-28]. Thus, they are widely used in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production. For example, transition metal molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a new type of 2D material. Regarding its structure, the special 2D scale affords the layered MoS2 with excellent electron mobility [29, 30]. Regarding the energy band, the block form of MoS2 has an indirect bandgap of 1.2 eV, whereas the bandgap of MoS2 nanosheets is a direct bandgap of 1.8 eV; this difference affords MoS2 nanosheets with enhances its visible light absorption capability [31-33]. These interesting enhancements have also shown that MoS2 nanosheets have potential applications in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production [34-36]. In 2013, Rao’s research group found that a 2D layered structure could be fabricated by peeling off the block form of MoS2 materials; the resulting 2D structure had particularly good optical absorption. In particular, the optical response and catalytic activity of MoS2 nanosheets are excellent in the near infrared region [37]. Zhang Hua and Ye Jinhua research project’s group respectively used theoretical calculations and experimentation to verify that MoS2 has an atomic layer thickness that would make it a good substitute for the precious metal Pt in the production of hydrogen via a photocatalytic water splitting process; this allows photocatalysts to be used without the precious metal Pt. Furthermore, the addition of MoS2 nanosheets was shown to increase the photo-induced carrier migration rate, thus significantly increasing the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production [38-40]. Although MoS2 nanosheets have a good visible light response, and the atomic layer thickness of MoS2 facilitates hydrogen production during the photocatalytic process, it is difficult to mass produce 2D MoS2 nanosheets [41]. In recent years, numerous research groups have attempted to MoS2 peeling [42, 43]. Our research group recently explored and developed a novel method of large-scale 2D nanosheet fabrication [44]; it was subsequently applied for photocatalytic hydrogen production [45]. Consequently, the novel method solved the large-scale preparation problem for MoS2 nanosheets and provided ample raw materials for the next step of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Recently, red or black phosphorus has been proven to also act as a photocatalyst [46]. In a previous study, polycrystalline black phosphorus was synthesized through the use of a simple hydrothermal method; this phosphorus demonstrated good catalytic visible light effects [47]. Then, Kim mentioned that this work fills the gap between graphene and 2D sulfide in the field of energy and catalysis [48]. Although the aforementioned discovery about polycrystalline black phosphorus proved to be very significant, their method requires the addition of a precious metal (Pt) and sacrificial agent (methanol) during photocatalytic hydrogen production; this restricts its application in the field of photocatalysis. In our early research, we always placed the photocatalyst scatter in an aqueous solution; this increased the contact area between the catalyst and aqueous solution, and thus strengthened the effects of the catalyst. This strategy was very reasonable, but it does not take into account a frequently encountered problem, i.e., that many photocatalysts contain transition metal elements (e.g., CdS and Bi2WO6) that can heavily contaminate water environments. Additionally, photocatalysts typically require the addition of a sacrificial agent to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production; if a sacrificial agent is not added the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen production process would be low. The abuse of a sacrificial agent considerably limits the effectiveness of photocatalyst research and development. Therefore, we decided to explore novel methods. We prepared a new self-water-absorption type photocatalyst and enabled photocatalytic hydrogen production under the condition of no water dispersion. The developed photocatalyst does not mandate the addition of a sacrificial agent or precious metals. This means that the developed photocatalyst can effectively produce hydrogen without the use of a sacrificial agent or precious metal. This novel design idea for photocatalysts was demonstrated to contribute to the improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen production, especially in the case of outer space exploration. In this work, a P/MoS2 composite photocatalyst with self-water-absorption performance was prepared by compositing MoS2 nanosheets and polycrystalline black phosphorus nanosheets [44, 47]. This composite photocatalyst does not require the addition of any precious metals during photocatalytic hydrogen production because it contains MoS2 nanosheets. During the photocatalytic overall water splitting experiment, the composite photocatalyst was found to have excellent water absorption ability and a strong photocatalytic effect in the absence of a sacrificial agent. Thus, this composite photocatalyst minimizes the negative impact on water environments and does not require the binding of a sacrificial agent. An in-depth investigation into the water absorption capability and hydrogen production mechanism of the proposed composite photocatalyst revealed that it can provide a new theoretical and practical basis for the research and development of a new type of photocatalyst; moreover, this method can be used as a reference for large-scale and efficient photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen production in natural environments. Furthermore, the proposed photocatalyst demonstrated good water absorption capability and overall water splitting performance under simulated Mars conditions (i.e., Mars temperature and pressure) [49, 50]."
1,Experimental Section,
2,Results and discussion,"Figure 1 provides a brief description of the preparation process for P/MoS2 composite material. Uniform MoS2 nanosheets were prepared from a microscale MoS2 block under the conditions of a temperature of 35 °C and 12 h of rotating ultrasonic processing. Additionally, phosphorus nanosheets were obtained from red phosphorus microspheres under the conditions of a temperature of 180 °C, and a 24 h hydrothermal reaction. Finally, the 2D P/MoS2 composite photocatalyst was obtained by ball-milling the MoS2 and phosphorus nanosheets in a N2 atmosphere for 6 h. The morphology of the MoS2 nanosheets was observed by applying SEM (Figure 2 a). It can be clearly seen that the MoS2 block transformed into a flaky structure after the rotating ultrasound method was applied; consequently, uniform MoS2 nanosheets with a size range of approximately 400–900 nm was prepared. The sheet structure below the MoS2 can be clearly seen through the MoS2 slice in Figure 2b, indicating that the prepared MoS2 slice was very thin following application of the rotating ultrasound method. Figure 2c shows the TEM image of the MoS2 nanosheets. There was a distinct difference from the corresponding SEM image. In response to high energy electron beams, the sheets exhibited a curling phenomenon because it was very thin. An HRTEM image is shown in Figure 2d; the crystal plane spacing of 0.95 nm corresponds to the MoS2 (002) plane. The crystal stripe was relatively clear, indicating that the crystalline quality of the MoS2 nanosheets was exceptionally high. Fig. S1a shows the electron diffraction pattern results for the MoS2 nanosheets. The characteristic six-fold symmetry proved that the MoS2 nanosheets had a hexagonal structure. The Raman spectrum of the MoS2 raw materials and nanosheets are shown in Fig. S1b: the MoS2 nanosheets were 1T@2H-MoS2 nanosheets. Figure 2e presents a comparison of the XRD analysis images of the MoS2 block and MoS2 nanosheets. There were more miscellaneous peaks in the MoS2 block curve in Figure 2e; specifically, there were significantly fewer miscellaneous peaks in the curve corresponding to the MoS2 nanosheets, and the (002) peak strength was significantly higher because of the 2D structure of the MoS2 nanosheets. A UV-vis diffuse reflectance test was used to investigate the light absorption properties of the MoS2 block and MoS2 sheets (Figure 2f). The absorption peak for the MoS2 nanosheets shifted toward the shortwave direction; additionally, the nanosheet curve had an obvious blue shift that was not observed for the MoS2 block; a similar observation has been previously reported [44]. Figure 3 a shows an SEM image of the phosphorus nanosheets. It can be seen that, following the hydrothermal reaction, the red phosphorus microspheres formed a relatively uniform nano-flake structure. A high-resolution SEM image of the phosphorus nanosheets is shown in Figure 3b; the phosphorus sheets clearly appear as a folded film. The morphology, mapping, and EDS results for the layered structure are presented in Figs. S3a–c; these results prove that the nanometer sheet was a phosphorus sheet. Figure 3c presents the TEM image of the phosphorus nanosheets; the structure and morphology of the layered structure can be clearly seen in this image. Additionally, an HRTEM image with a crystal plane spacing of 0.55 nm is shown in Figure 3d; it corresponds to the (020) surface of the black phosphorus. The crystal stripe was relatively clear, and it changed from the amorphous red phosphorus to the polycrystalline black phosphorus. Figure 3e presents a comparison of the XRD images of the red phosphorus and black phosphorus nanosheets; it was found that the peak value of the black phosphorus nanosheets differed from that of the red phosphorus, and that the (020) surface of the black phosphorus was associated with a very obvious peak. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry for the red and black phosphorus nanosheets are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the phosphorus nanosheets shifted toward the shortwave direction; this is associated with the blue shift phenomenon. The extrapolated value for the photon at A = 0 (i.e., the line on the x axis) corresponds to the absorption edge energy for the polycrystalline black phosphorus, i.e., Eg = 1.9 eV; this value was higher than that for the red phosphorus (i.e., 1.6 eV, Figure 3f). Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the polycrystalline black phosphorus nanometer sheets may be higher than that of their red phosphorus counterpart [47]. A post-ball milling SEM image of the 10% P/MoS2 composite structure is shown in Figure 4 a. To begin, the MoS2 and phosphorus nanosheets were placed into the ball mill as separate materials. However, the ball-milling process caused the two types of nanosheets to form a structure that resembles a thin film. Figure 4b shows an SEM image of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst at a higher magnification; the merging of the nanometer sheets can be seen more clearly. Figure 4c shows the EDS and mapping results for a certain area in Figure 4b; the individual Mo, P, and S elements were observed in the post-ball milled image, indicating that it was a P/MoS2 composite material. XRD images of the pure phosphorus nanosheets, pure MoS2 nanosheets, and P/MoS2 composites (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% MoS2) are shown in Figure 5 a. Because they were doped with different proportions of MoS2, the graph lines of the nanosheets were slightly different. When the MoS2 ratio was 10%, the number of miscellaneous peaks for MoS2 was relatively lower; however, when the P/MoS2 composite had larger proportions of MoS2, the miscellaneous peaks associated with MoS2 became noticeable again. This may mean that the ratio of phosphorus nanosheets to 10% MoS2 nanosheets was more homogeneous than those for the other mixing proportions. Figure 5b shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry for all samples. The amount of light absorbed by the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was significantly larger than those for the other proportions, indicating that it had the widest absorption spectrum, and that it could most effectively absorb light, and the band-gap energy was about 1.7 eV. Besides, specific surface area and pore diameter of P/MoS2, MoS2 and P show this catalyst have a large specific surface area and uniform porous structure in Fig. S4. The hydrogen production results for different MoS2 contents (i.e., 0, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) are shown in Figure 6 a. It can be seen that the hydrogen evolution rate of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was 815.77 μmol/hg was found to be much higher than those for the other proportions. Specifically, the hydrogen evolution rate of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was approximately five times that of the pure phosphorus nanosheets, two times that of the 5% and 10% P/MoS2 catalyst, and 3.5 times that of the 20% P/MoS2 catalyst. Figure 6b illustrates the hydrogen production capability of the red phosphorus, phosphorus nanosheets, MoS2 nanosheets, and 10% P/MoS2 catalyst over a period of 7 h; the conditions were as follows: immersion in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing methanol (20 vol%) as a sacrificial electron donor, incorporation of 50 mg of a catalyst, and exposure to a 300 W Xe lamp with an optical cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). The 7-h-duration hydrogen production results were as follows: approximately 5710 μmol/g for the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst, approximately 100 μmol/g for the pure red phosphorus, approximately 249 μmol/g for the pure MoS2 nanosheets, and approximately 1192 μmol/g for the pure phosphorus nanosheets. Figure 6c shows the photocurrent responses of the phosphorus nanosheets, MoS2 nanosheets, and P/MoS2 composite materials. Under the condition of illumination, the photocurrent increased. However, after the light was switched off, the photocurrent immediately returned to a level associated with the state of dark current. Analysis of the 280 min intermittent irradiation results revealed that the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst had the best photocurrent response, and that the MoS2 nanosheets had the worst photocurrent response. Additionally, the photocurrent response of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was very stable relatively reliable. Thus, based on the results shown in Figures 5b and 6c, the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst had the best light absorption and light response. It was also able to most effectively produce hydrogen (Figure 6a and b). The water-splitting performance of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was investigated under the conditions of exposure to all light, and no sacrificial agent (Figure 6d). The most gratifying discovery was that it respectively produced 1113.79 μmol/g and 474.33 μmol/g of hydrogen and oxygen in 7 h. Additionally, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates for the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst were respectively 159.11 μmol/hg and 67.76 μmol/hg (Fig. S5). The H2 and O2 evolution cycling curves for the 10% P/MoS2 photocatalyst are shown in Figure 6e; H2 and O2 production was very stable throughout the 70 h cycle test. Figure 6f (ion chromatography) shows how the concentrations of the phosphate ions (i.e., PO4 3- and HPO4 2-), which were decomposed products of the P/MoS2 photocatalyst, varied during the process of light irradiation. According to the results, the PO4 3- and HPO4 2- concentrations gradually increased during the first 36 h, and tended to stabilize at approximately 48 h (at values of approximately 11 ppm and 24 ppm, respectively), indicating that the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was very stable under all light irradiation. The results of the water-splitting experiment revealed that the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst had good water absorption performance; thus, we designed an experiment to analyze its water absorption capability before water-splitting. The experimental environment was designed to simulate daytime conditions on Mars (pressure: approximately -0.1 MPa, temperature: approximately 303 K) [49, 50]. First, the catalyst was added to the beaker (dry) and put into the light reaction apparatus with 10 mL of water. Then, the water absorption of the catalyst was evaluated under the following conditions: -0.1 MPa, 303 K, and no light. During the period of 0–14 h, water absorption continuously increased. After 14 h, water absorption reached a state of equilibrium. At 24 h, 0.41 mg of water had been absorbed, and the catalyst had a viscous appearance (inset of Figure 7 a). Then, the water-splitting capability of this “sticky” catalyst was evaluated by exposing it to a 300 W Xe lamp. As shown in Figure 7b, in this case, the catalyst could also effectively perform water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Every 7 h, 123.75 μmol/g and 53.30 μmol/g of H2 and O2 were respectively produced. After cycling for 70 h, no significant decrease in hydrogen or oxygen production was observed. Additionally, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates for the 10% P/MoS2 in this system were respectively 17.68 μmol/hg and 7.61 μmol/hg (Figure 7c). A P-O bond was observed by applying XPS to the 10% P/MoS2 sample following the water absorption reaction (Figure 7d and Fig. S6). Besides, IR results of P/MoS2 before and after the reaction have been added in Fig. S7. The results indicate that the water absorption capacity of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst was attributable to the presence of P-O bonds. Figure 8 illustrates the self-water absorption and water-splitting mechanisms of the 10% P/MoS2 catalyst under the simulated Mars conditions. The yellow point represents the phosphorus sheets on the MoS2 layers; the phosphorus sheets absorbed moisture from the air (Figure 7a) and formed P-O bonds (Figure 7d). Then, in response to sun exposure, the catalyst caused the water to split (i.e., decompose) into hydrogen and oxygen (Figure 7b and c). These results suggest that this self-water absorption and water-splitting photocatalyst can be used in other moist places, including on planets with atmospheric water. Thus, this mechanism, and the photocatalyst, show promise for future applications."
3,Conclusion,"A P/MoS2 composite photocatalyst with self-water-absorption performance was successfully synthesized for the first time by compositing MoS2 nanosheets and polycrystalline black phosphorus nanosheets. This composite photocatalyst was demonstrated to effectively produce hydrogen without the addition of any precious metals. It also demonstrated photocatalytic overall water splitting ability in the absence of a sacrificial agent or precious metal. More significantly, the proposed photocatalyst effectively absorbed water and performed water splitting under simulated Mars conditions; the 70 h averaged hydrogen and oxygen production rates were 17.68 μmol h-1 g-1 and 7.61 μmol h-1 g-1, respectively. In addition, this in-depth study, which focused on water absorption and hydrogen production capability, provides new theoretical and practical insight that can contribute to the development of a new type of photocatalyst for energy and outer space exploration."
