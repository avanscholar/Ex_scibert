0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2), as a clean and renewable energy source with the highest gravimetric calorific value among all possible fuels, is an ideal energy carrier to resolve the future energy and environmental crises [1]. Water splitting by electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction offers a promising route to product high purity H2 in a sustainable manner [2–5]. However, to date, HER electrocatalysts which can satisfy all three basic requirements, i.e., low price, high efficiency and good reliability are still rare. In recent decades, varieties of hopeful electrocatalysts that based on earth abundant elements, such as transition metal chalcogenides [6–9], phosphides [10–12], nitrides [13,14] and carbides [15], have been investigated, and some of which have shown its potential ability to replace the effective but costly Pt based materials. Especially, MoS2, as a typical 2-D material with high chemical stability and near-zero hydrogen binding energy at undercoordinated Mo-S sites along layered edges, has been placed great expectation [4,16–20]. However, the achieved experimental HER performances are usually far from theoretical prediction due to the low active sites density and its intrinsic semiconductor nature [18,21]. To resolve those two issues, synthesis of MoS2 with large proportions of exposed edges on conductive skeletons seems to be an effective idea. However, thermodynamically, surface with exposed edges are unfavorable for 2-D materials due to its inherent high surface energy property [22,23]. Most MoS2 nanomaterials usually tend to take the shapes of close-compacted or curled structures exposed mainly by inert basal planes. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to tackle this challenge to synthesize edge-enriched MoS2. Edge-terminated MoS2 synthesized by hydrothermal method, chemical vapor deposition and direct sulfuring of Mo based substrate have been reported in many works [24–28]. Indeed, most of the reported approaches are actually based on nanosizing methods to reduce the size of MoS2 crystals and subsequently expose more edges (Fig. S1a). Unfortunately, the nanosized MoS2 crystals, generally in form of nanosheets, prefer to form aggregated structures to minimize the surface energy in the process of synthesis or electrocatalytic reaction, which will greatly reduce the edge sites density and pose instability problems. Some further researches report the stabilization of nanosized MoS2 by hybridizing or anchoring the MoS2 nanostructures with/on graphene or other functionalized skeletons (Fig. S1b) [29–32]. However, those methods usually involve in embedding problems leaving fewer effective edge sites to participate in the electrochemical reaction. The direct sulfuring methods proposed by Cui et al. can yield vertical aligned multilayered MoS2 films with uniform edge-terminated surface on planer Mo substrate or Mo based fibers (Fig. S1c) [26,33], the effective edge sites density is limited by its 2-D planar structural feature where only the edges on outer planar surface can participate in the electrochemical reaction. To date, the large-scale fabrication of the MoS2 with essentially increased effective edge sites density meanwhile with long-term stability is still an open challenge. Generally, HER electrode is constructed by an electrocatalyst layer on the surface of an electrode substrate. The electrocatalyst serves as active electrocatalytic material to lower the energy barrier for H2 production, and the electrode substrate serves as support for the active materials and as current collectors. Commonly, substrates with properties of good conductivity, large surface area, and high chemical stability are required to accelerate electron transfer, increase the loaded amount of electrocatalysts and resist corrosion against strong acidic or alkaline electrolyte during electrochemical reaction, respectively. Stainless steel performs high conductivity, good chemical stability and also high mechanical strength [34]. These excellent properties assure it a potential candidate as electrode substrate for HER process. In this work, commercial available 316L SSF, which was originally used as filters in automobile industry and chemical industries [35,36], was applied as electrode substrate for MoS2 electrocatalyst. Ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets with a large proportion of exposed edges were vertically grown on the SSF substrate via a convenient one-step hydrothermal process. Notably, the synthesized MoS2 nanosheet demonstrates a pine tree-like structure featured by the maximally exposed active edges toward both side surfaces. Abundant gaps between the MoS2 nanosheets together with impressive super hydrophilic property assures the effective edge sites that accessible to electrochemical reaction and the rapid desorption of H2 products, and subsequently leading to high intrinsic HER activity. In addition to these electrochemically desired properties, the tight contact of the MoS2 sheet on the SSF substrate and the low price, porosity, high conductivity and high chemical corrosion resistance properties of the SSF substrate guarantee the MoS2/SSF electrode an efficient and durable HER electrode in both strong acidic and alkaline medium for potential commercial applications."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemical reagents,"2.1 Chemical reagents All chemicals that used in this work, including thioacetamide (C2H5NS, 99%), sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4•2H2O, 99%), muriatic acid (HCl, 36–38%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%) and deionized water are of analytical grade and are used without further purification."
3,Sample synthetization,"2.2 Sample synthetization The growth of MoS2 nanosheets on SSF was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 22.5 mg Na2MoO4•2H2O and 45 mg C2H5NS were dissolved in 15 mL deionized water under stirring to form a transparent mixed solution. The SSF substrate (10 mm × 30 mm) was soaked in 3 M HCl solution for 5 min to remove oxidation layer on surface, and ultrasonic cleaned with acetone and absolute ethyl alcohol for 10 min in sequence. Then the mixed solution with SSF was placed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After reaction at 200 °C for 20 h, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. After being washed for three times with deionized water and ethanol, the sample was dried at 60 °C in oven for 12 h and black sample of MoS2 nanosheets on SSF can be obtained. For comparison, Ni3S2@MoS2/NF (Nickel foam) was synthesized with the same reactant and procedure on NF substrate."
4,Materials characterizations,"2.3 Materials characterizations The phase compositions of the synthesized samples were examined by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were performed on a Hitachi S4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and a JEOL JEM-2100Plus transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at 200 kV, respectively. TEM samples were prepared by scrape the MoS2 nanosheets from SSF substrate by a razor blade. Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba HR800 spectrometer under excitation of a 633 nm laser. The chemical binding states of the sample were investigated by a Thermo Scientic K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). Before the XPS test, the samples were cleaned by Ar+ bombarding for 15 s to remove surface adsorbed impurities. All the binding energies were corrected by C1s at 284.60 eV."
5,Electrochemical properties,"2.4 Electrochemical properties Electrochemical HER properties of the samples were characterized in a typical three-electrode system at room temperature on an Autolab PGSTAT 128N station in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and 1.0 M KOH solution respectively. Before testing, the as-synthesized samples were sealed with 704 silica gel to expose an area of 1 cm × 1 cm and were used as working electrodes. A graphite rod was utilized as the counter, and Ag/AgCl and standard Hg/HgO were used as reference electrode in alkaline medium and acid medium, respectively. For comparison, bare NF, bare SSF, Ni3S2@MoS2/NF and Pt/C loaded on the SSF with the same amount were also tested. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was collected with the scan rate of 5 mV/s and the results were IR-corrected. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 Hz with amplitude of 10 mV. Electric double-layer capacitance was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement at non-faradaic potential with sweep rates of 20, 40, 60, 100, 120 and 140 mV/s to estimate the effective electrode surface area. The stability of the electrodes were tested by continuous chronoamperometry for 12 h in alkaline and acidic medium at constant overpotentials to gain an initial current density of about 20 mA cm−2."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Overall properties of SSF substrate and the synthetization of MoS2/SSF,"3.1 Overall properties of SSF substrate and the synthetization of MoS2/SSF The morphology of the 316 L SSF substrate used in this work is shown in Fig. 1a. The SSF has a porous structure with fiber diameters in the range from 5 to 10 µm and pore sizes in the range from 10 to 50 µm. The high aspect 3-D porous architecture provides a large surface area for the loading of catalysts and also provides sufficient channels for the diffusion and transportation of protons and bubbles inside the electrode. As shown in Fig. S2, after immersing the SSF substrate in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 20 h, no obvious corrosion and weight change can be detected indicating good chemical stability in a strong acid environment. The SSF substrate also presents a low resistivity of 1.3 × 10−5 Ω m measured by four probes method which is comparable to that of Ni foam (1.1 × 10−5 Ω m) and five orders of magnitudes lower than carbon fiber (~1 ×10 Ω m). The low price, porous structure, good chemical stability and high conductivity assure the SSF as a competitive HER electrode substrate for commercial applications. As shown in Fig. 1b, for a typical procedure to load MoS2 catalyst on the SSF substrate, washed SSF substrate with mixed reagent solution (Na2MoO4•2H2O and C2H5NS) were simply put into a autoclave and heated at 200 ℃ for 20 h. Subsequently, sample of MoS2 nanosheets uniformly covered SSF were obtained (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 1c and d, uniformly distributed cross-linked ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets are vertically grown on the SSF. Each nanosheet is about 10–15 nm thick and 200–300 nm long. Notably, abundant gaps exist between the MoS2 sheets, which can provide sufficient transport channels for electrolyte and H2 bubbles. Moreover, the adhesion between the MoS2 sheets and substrate was examined by ultrasonic vibration in deionized water. After two hours ultrasonic vibration, little macroscopic change or sediment in water can be observed indicating the tight adhesion of MoS2 nanosheets on the SSF substrate (Fig. S4). The tight adhesion favors the smooth electron transfer from the SSF substrate to MoS2 catalyst and also contributes to improve the electrochemical stability."
8,Structural characterization and growth mechanism of MoS2 on SSF,"3.2 Structural characterization and growth mechanism of MoS2 on SSF Fig. 2a presents the XRD pattern of the MoS2/SSF sample. The diffraction peaks at around 43.6° and 50.8° are attributing to the (111) and (200) planes from the SSF substrate (JCPDS 33-0945) [37]. The broad diffraction peaks centered at 14.2° and 33° are assigned to (002) and (004) planes of MoS2 (JCPDS 73-1508) [38]. Raman spectrum shown in Fig. 2b presents two characteristic peaks located at 375 and 410 cm−1 attributing to the in-plane E1 2g and the out-of plane A1 g Mo-S phonon modes, respectively [33]. As known, the out-of plane A1 g mode is usually excited from edge-terminated MoS2 due to the polarization dependence; while the out-of plane E1 2g mode is preferentially excited from terrace-terminated MoS2 (Fig. 2b insert) [33,39,40]. Then, the relative intensities between those two integrated Raman modes can be used to trace the information of edge density. The relative integrated intensity of E1 2g peak is about 35% of that of the A1 g peak indicating the edge-rich structural feature of the MoS2 sheets. As a versatile and sensitive surface analysis technique, XPS was applied to investigate surface chemical states of the MoS2/SSF sample. S and Mo elements are clearly identified in the survey spectra (Fig. S5). The HR-XPS spectrum of S 2p shown in Fig. 2c presents four distinct peaks centered at binding energies of 162, 163.2, 164.2 and 169.4 eV respectively. Peaks at 162 and 163.2 eV are assigned to S2- corresponding to in-plane S2- ligands from MoS2 [41]. The peaks at 164.2 and 169.4 eV are attributing to two kinds of bridging disulfide on MoS2 edge. The peak at 164.2 eV is assigned to bridging disulfide S2 2- ligands on MoS2 edge which has been widely accepted as unsaturated sulfur edge, and the small peak at binding energy of 169.4 eV is attributing to S6+ species from SO4 2- residues [41,42]. The Mo 3d XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 2d displays four major peaks located at 227.4, 229.3, 232.5 and 236.5 eV respectively. The peaks at 227.4 and 236.5 eV are attributing to S 2 s and Mo6+ from residual molybdate on surface respectively, and peaks at 229.3, 232.5 eV are assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 binding states respectively. Furtherly, the Mo 3d peak can be deconvoluted into two doublet peaks located at 228.2, 232.4, and 230.2, 233.2 eV respectively. The doublet peaks at 230.2 and 233.2 eV are well indexed to the standard peak position of Mo4+ from bulk 2H-MoS2 in basal planes [43,44]. In consistent with S 2p spectrum, Mo 3d peaks at 228.2 and 232.4 eV can be assigned to nonstoichiometric bonded Mo atoms on edge originated from a large number of dangling bonds on edges since that unsaturated atoms usually lead to chemical shift towards lower binding energies. The integrated area that originated from edge sites is about 55% of the total area of Mo 3d peak. Accordingly, corroborating the Raman result, the XPS result provides further evidence for the edge-rich structural feature. The microstructure of the MoS2 nanosheet was characterized by TEM. Fig. 3a and b show the TEM images of the MoS2 nanosheet viewing along the direction perpendicular to the sheet. Interestingly, the nanosheet shows a pine tree-like structure with many branches. HR-TEM observations confirm that the branches and the main trunk are indeed well stacked MoS2 multilayers with edges terminated at the side surface of the sheet. The interlayer spacing is measured to about 6.3 Å (Fig. 3b) which is relatively larger than its bulk form owing to the intercalation of NH4 + ions between the layers consisting with other researches by using ammoniate precursors (Fig. S5) [45,46]. Notably, carful observation of the pine tree-like structure certifies that the branches are actually formed by the splitting of MoS2 layers on the main trunk. The MoS2 layers gradually split from the root to top regions lead to the thinning of the main trunk and branches, which should be related to the weak van der Waals interlayer interaction between stacked layers. Exposed surface with a large proportion of edge sites is thermodynamically unfavorable owing to its inherent high surface energy nature. Then, the growth mechanism for the edge-rich MoS2 is more likely to be governed by a kinetics manner, which can be partially understood based on previous studies on edge-terminated MoS2 film that synthesized by kinetic controlled sulfurization of Mo or MoO3 substrates in vapor phase [26,33,47]. A kinetically controlled hydrothermal growth mechanism for the pine tree-like edge-terminated MoS2 nanosheet was proposed as shown in Fig. 3c–e. In the initial growth step, small MoS2 nanocrystals nucleate on the SSF substrate. The edges of the MoS2 nucleuses prefer to contact with SSF substrate because of its polarity nature to form fairly strong chemisorption binding with the SSF substrate (Fig. 3c). As known, for a hydrothermal process, the reactant concentration gradient plays a key role in growth kinetics. Generally, crystal growth along the direction with higher supersaturation is preferred. With the growth process, reactants nearby the MoS2 nanocrystal nucleuses are constantly consumed leading to the lowered reactant concentrations especially in the gaps between the nanocrystals due to the accelerated consumption by neighboring nanocrystals. Moreover, the nanosized gaps between the nanocrystals can inhibit the convection and diffusion of reactants because of the nanosized space. Accordingly, this will lead to higher reactant concentration along the direction vertical to substrate compared with that along lateral directions (Fig. 3c). Therefore, growth along vertical direction is preferred and thus resulting in a vertically heightened form rather than a lateral thickened form (Fig. 3d). This speculation is supported by experimental evidence in samples with different growth time in the initial stage (Fig. S6). After 0.5 h reaction, MoS2 nanosheets nucleus with sheet thickness about 10–15 nm can be found (Fig. S6a). The nanosheets are increasingly heightened with the increase of reaction time (Fig. S6b and c), while the sheet thickness remains unchanged. As the growth progress, cleavage of the stacked planes of the MoS2 multilayers tends to happen because of the loose van der Waals binding between the layers accelerated by the tendency to lower surface energy. Since the main trunk of the MoS2 nanosheet is strongly adhered onto the SSF fiber, cleavage of MoS2 multilayers is more likely to occur at top regions of the trunk because of confinement from the strongly anchored roots. With the growth proceed, further cleavages may occur at higher regions, and cleavages may also occur in some thick branches. Subsequently, a pine tree-like edge-terminated structural architecture can be formed (Fig. 3d). It should be noted that, for the kinetically controlled growth mechanism proposed here, the strong adhesion of the nanosheet and the reactant concentration should play important roles. Weak binding force may lead to timely coordination of the growth direction toward energetically favored in-plane direction, i.e., the thermodynamically controlled manner, which is responsible for the usually formed free-standing MoS2 nanosheets or nanosheets on chemically insert substrates like graphene and carbon fibers with edges terminated at the direction paralleling to the sheet (Fig. S7) [48,49]. High-resolution SEM image of the MoS2/SSF sample that synthesized with doubled reactant concentrations is shown in Fig. S8. The size and density of the gaps between nanosheets decrease significantly and the growth direction of the sheets seems disordered compared to the sample with lower reactant concentration (Fig. 1c and d), because of the reduced reactant gradient induced by the fast complement of the consumed reactant in the highly concentrated solution."
9,Role of edge-terminated feature on hydrophilicity,"3.3 Role of edge-terminated feature on hydrophilicity Compared to the direct vapor sulfuring resulted uniform 2-D MoS2 films with edges on planar surface [33], the density of edge sites on the MoS2 nanosheets presented in this work should be much higher because of the 3-D morphological feature. Moreover, the density should be also higher than those mostly reported edge-terminated MoS2 nanosheets or aggregated nanoflowers [28,38] on which the edges are terminated at lateral planes of the nanosheets (Fig. S7). For an effective HER electrode, good hydrophilicity is desired to increase the available active sites that participating the catalytic reaction and also to accelerate desorption of H2 bubbles. Samples of Ni3S2/MoS2 on NF, bare SSF and bare NF were used as references to evaluate the hydrophilicity properties and also to evaluate the electrochemical properties later. The porous morphology of the bare NF used is shown in Fig. S9a. The sample of Ni3S2/MoS2 on NF which is synthesized by the same procedure with the MoS2/SSF sample exhibits a one-dimensional morphology with a high specific surface area (Fig. S9b). Notably, distinguishing from the MoS2/SSF sample, the MoS2 shell on Ni3S2 skeleton core shows a terrace stacked structure with layers mainly paralleling to the axial direction of Ni3S2 nanowire core (Fig. S9c and d), and thus fewer edges sites are exposed to electrolyte, offering a meaningful reference to the understanding of the effect of exposed edges and also the effect of electrode substrate on HER properties. Considering the fact that the basal planes of the 2H type MoS2 are inert and generally process hydrophobic property, while the edge sites are hydrophilic because of its high active dangling bonds which give a high surface energy, the edge-terminated structural feature of the MoS2/SSF would be beneficial to improve the hydrophilicity. The results from wettability tests strongly support this inference. As shown in Fig. 4a, the MoS2/SSF sample shows a super-hydrophilicity with a zero contact angle with infiltration time less than 1/60 s (Video S1). While, the bare NF and bare SSF show obvious hydrophobic property with contact angles larger than 120° even after 10 min infiltration (Fig. S10a and b). The Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample shows better hydrophilicity over the bare NF and bare SSF, but it is still much sluggisher than the MoS2/SSF sample by which the time last by up to ten minutes to decrease the contact angle to zero (Fig. S10c). The most desired properties, i.e., the large proportion of exposed layer edges, the abundant gaps between the MoS2 nanosheets together with the super-hydrophilic property, assure the maximized effective edge sites that accessible to electrochemical reaction, and thus high intrinsic electrochemical activity (Fig. 4b).

10,Electrocatalytic HER performance in acidic and alkaline medium,"3.4 Electrocatalytic HER performance in acidic and alkaline medium The HER activity of the as-prepared samples was evaluated in a standard three-electrode system within 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Fig. 5a shows the LSV curves of those samples. The Pt/C sample displays an onset potential of 9 mV (vs. the RHE) and a Tafel slope of 28.8 mV dec−1 which are in good agreement with reported results. The bare NF exhibits the poorest activity. Comparatively, the bare SSF is more active than the NF because of the abundant electrochemically active elements such as Ni, Fe, Cr and Mo. As compared with the overpotential of Ni3S2@MoS2/NF to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (229 mV), the overpotential of MoS2/SSF is reduced by 34% (151 mV). To drive a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential required for MoS2/SSF is 213 mV, while for the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample is much higher (311 mV). The corresponding Tafel slopes are shown in Fig. 5b. The MoS2/SSF sample shows a Tafel slope of 55.7 mV dec−1 which is lower than that of the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample (78.8 mV dec−1) indicating faster HER kinetics. The EIS measurements were conducted to evaluate the charge transfer kinetics of the samples. As shown in Fig. 5c, all tested samples show low series resistance element (Rs) values in the range from 1 to 1.15 Ω implying the reliable electrical contacts between catalysts and electrode substrate. This measurement further corroborate the superior interfacial charge-transfer kinetic and the higher activity of the MoS2/SSF sample, where the Nyquist plot shows the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct) (with an extremely low Rct of 0.4 Ω) among the tested electrodes. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of the electrodes can be evaluated by electrochemical double-layer capacity (Cdl) because of their linearly proportional relationship. As shown in Fig. 5d (the CV curves of the MoS2/SSF is shown in Fig. S11a), the Cdl values of the bare NF, bare SSF, Ni3S2@MoS2/NF and MoS2/SSF are 0.14, 4.85, 46.34 and 54.37 mF cm−2 respectively, indicating the largest density of active sites of the MoS2/SSF sample. The specific activity of the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF and MoS2/SSF was further calculated by normalizing the polarization curves by ECSA to estimate their intrinsic activity [39,50,51]. As shown in Fig. S12a, the MoS2/SSF still shows a much higher HER specific activity compared with the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF, which confirms the high intrinsic activity nature of the MoS2/SSF given by the large proportion of exposed active edge sites. In addition, the MoS2/SSF electrode also exhibits high activity in alkaline condition. As presented in Fig. 6a, the MoS2/SSF sample shows the highest activity among all samples. The results show overpotentials of 182, 230, 258 and 362 mV for the samples of MoS2/SSF, Ni3S2@MoS2/NF, bare SSF and bare NF to drive a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. To drive a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential required for the MoS2/SSF is 283 mV being lower than that of the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample (315 mV). Fig. 6b presents the corresponding Tafel plots of the samples. Tafel slopes of 83.6 and 90.8 mV dec−1 are indicated for the samples of MoS2/SSF and the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF, respectively, implying faster HER kinetics of the MoS2/SSF. The extremely low Rs (1.2 Ω) and Rct (0.35 Ω) values of the MoS2/SSF further solidifies the reliable contact, fast electron exchange and the high activity (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6d presents Cdl values of 0.42, 4.86, 39.45 and 48.5 mF cm−2 for samples of bare NF, bare SSF and Ni3S2@MoS2/NF and MoS2/SSF, respectively (Figs. 6d, S11b). The relatively large Cdl value implies the large density of surface sites that active to alkaline medium. In contrast to the Cdl values in acidic medium, the Cdl value of the MoS2/SSF is smaller than the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample. The difference can be attributed to the different formation mechanisms for the electrical double-layer in the different electrolyte environments. In acidic medium, small protons are easily intercalated into the expanded MoS2 layers to form electrochemical double-layer with enlarged area [52]. While in alkaline medium, there are less free protons, and thus relatively larger cations like K+ or H3O+ can hardly intercalated into the layers, and resulting in a smaller Cdl value. In otherwise, the property of the MoS2/SSF sample with comparatively smaller Cdl value but higher activity gives direct evidence to the higher specific catalytic activity of the edge-terminated structural feature (Fig. S12b). According to the electrochemical analysis above, the high HER catalytic activity of the MoS2/SSF sample in both strong acidic and alkaline medium is confirmed. In fact, the activity of the MoS2/SSF sample is also ranked the best MoS2 based catalysts in both acidic and alkaline medium reported in literatures, especially the presented activity is superior to most of the previously reported single-component MoS2 catalysts affirming the edge-terminated structural superiority (as shown in Table. S1) [24,53–55]. To check the catalytic durability, chronoamperometry studies were performed for 12 h in both alkaline and acidic medium. As shown in Fig. 7, the MoS2/SSF sample shows a stable current density during the potentiostatic measurement in both alkaline and acidic solution. In contrast, the current densities of the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample show obvious degradation especially in acidic medium, where degradation of about 40% (from 20 to 12 mA cm−2) is detected indicating comparatively deteriorated stability. After the stability tests, no visible appearance change of the MoS2/SSF is observed in both acidic and alkaline medium (Fig. S13). The little weight losses of the MoS2/SSF sample after stability tests in both acidic and alkaline medium further solidify the high stability (Table. S2). On contrary, obvious weight losses of the Ni3S2@MoS2/NF sample are detected indicating the deteriorated stability. This should be related to the substantial dissolution of the Ni foam substrate, since peeling off of the Ni3S2@MoS2 nanostructures are found indicated by the black precipitates at the bottom of the electrolytic pool. Further stability tests were carried out by CV cycling for 1000 cycles in both acidic and alkaline medium respectively. The results show little change of current density (Fig. S14) and morphology (Fig. S15) after continuous HER test for 1000 cycles. The chemical bonding states of the samples after the stability tests further confirms the good stability of MoS2. As shown in Fig. S16, Mo and S are detected in the XPS spectrums, no other impurities are formed. The Mo 3d located at about 230 and 233 eV are well indexed to 2H phase MoS2 indicating no phase changes after stability tests."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, by using a simple one-step hydrothermal method, ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheets with a large proportion of exposed active edges terminated at side surfaces were successfully synthesized on SSF substrate. Maximized effective edge sites are ensured by the pine tree-like 3-D structural feature, abundant gaps and super-hydrophilic property. As a result of the large density of effective active edge sites together with the cost-efficiency, porosity, conductive and high chemical corrosion resistance properties of the SSF substrate, the MoS2/SSF electrode presents high specific activity and excellent durability in both strong acidic and alkaline medium. The presented kinetically controlled hydrothermal process would help to pave the way for the large-scale synthesis of edge-terminated MoS2, and the presented novel 3-D structural feature may also benefit many other applications, e.g., gas sensors, energy storage, catalysts for N2 reduction, CO2 reduction, hydrodesulfurization, and so on, where the maximally exposed edges are urgently desired."
