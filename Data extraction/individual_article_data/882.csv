0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of alcohols has fascinated noteworthy research interests in chemical industries, due to the important role of aldehydes and carboxylic acids for the synthesis of numerous chemicals as intermediates for pharmaceutical and fragrance industries [1]. The different catalytic systems and reagents for improving the chemical conversion of alcohols to aldehydes in terms of economic and environmental reasons are frequently discussed. The oxidation of alcohols is traditionally performed by using stoichiometric amounts of either organic or inorganic oxidants such as dimethyl sulfoxide and chromate, etc. Unfortunately, this method not only uses toxic and corrosive reagents, but also causes economic and environmental problems due to the production of large amounts of toxic byproducts [2]. Therefore, a green and environmentally friendly catalytic system for the oxidation reaction of alcohols is urgently needed. H2O2 is a cheap, safe, readily available and most desirable oxidant, which can be used as an environmentally benign replacement for stoichiometric oxygen donors [3]. Nano materials based on noble metals have been extensively studied in chemistry and materials science for their distinguished properties, such as quantum size effect, high ratio of surface area to volume and their natural ability to catalyze organic transformations [4,5]. Among the noble metals, palladium nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their applications as highly efficient catalysts for many organic reactions such as reduction [6], alcohol oxidation[7] and cross-coupling reaction [8]. In spite of the broad utilization of palladium nanoparticles in different processes, due to fast catalyst deactivation resulting from the aggregation of particles or the leaching of the metals during chemical reactions, finding efficient methods to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd-based catalysts has been a hot research topic in recent years. Consequently, novel strategies are emerging and are applied to immobilization of nanoparticles as active species on different solid supports to avoid agglomeration of nanoparticles, which leads to maintain their stability and reusability potential in catalytic reactions [9-11]. Up to now, various organic and inorganic materials have been used as the support material, for instance hydroxyapatite [12], porous silica [13], carbon [14], graphene [15], MWCNT [16], Al2O3 [17], MgO [18] and ZnO [19], to stabilize the palladium nanoparticles on their surface. Among the organic and inorganic supports, metal oxides have attracted increasing attention due to some particular advantages over the other supports. These supports show the importance of charge transfer between metal and oxide in the oxidation reaction in addition to preventing the agglomeration of the metallic nanoparticles [20]. The metal oxides that are in contact with the surface of metal-oxide/noble metal catalysts extraordinary impeding certain noble metal active sites, thus, incidentally, improve the function of catalysts. Undoubtedly, the oxide/noble metal interface plays a critical role, by providing more active centers and improving the catalytic activity thanks to the modulation of the superficial electron state of the noble metals by the oxides or other compounds [21-23]. Among metal oxides as supports, CuO has been utilized in numerous diverse designs and systems which can be attributed to its low cost, good chemical stability, low toxicity and good charge/electron transfer properties [24]. It is found that the dispersion of nanoparticles and also the interaction between nanoparticles and supports which are closely corresponded to catalytic activity, are strongly influenced by the morphologies and structures of solid supports [9]. Therefore, one of the ideal candidates as the support material is the hollow nano-microstructures of inorganic materials with different pore size and flakes on the surface. Such structures have proved their beneficial performance in various applications as catalysis [25,26,27,28,29,30,31], light filter, waste removal, energy storage, microvessels for drug delivery, encapsulation, fillers, photonic crystals, and coatings. It is worth mentioning that the size of these structures, along with the fine structure of spherical shells strongly affects their efficiency and applications [32,33]. According to the literature, hollow spheres can be fabricated by three typical strategies, including the template method (may be classified as hard and soft template methods), self-template and template-free method. Among the mentioned methods, the template method is the efficient strategy due to controlling shapes and sizes of hollow spheres. Previous studies have been indicated that hard templating is interested and developed because features like having simplicity of procedure, repeatability, neat of production and appropriateness for a large number of materials [32,33]. In continuation of our investigation on the synthesis and development of heterogeneous catalysts in organic reactions [34,35,36,37,38,39], herein, we have studied the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde using Pd.PdO.CuO and MxOy.CuO (M= Zn, La, Mn) hollow structures as catalyst in presence of H2O2 as oxidant. The results indicated that the best production yield of benzaldehyde was obtained using Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure. The influence of different experimental factors such as solvent type, reaction temperature, amount of oxidant and catalyst mole percentage forms the basis of discussion reported in this manuscript. The synthesis of hollow structures was carried out by a hydrothermal method. Diverse techniques were used to characterize and study the structural characteristics of synthesized hollow structures."
1,Results and discussion,"Scheme 1 shows the steps involved in the preparation of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structures. The carbon microspheres were synthesized at first via the hydrothermal procedure by carbonization of the sucrose. The surfaces of the produced carbon spheres are hydrophilic and are functionalized with -OH and C=O groups, which are formed from non- or partially dehydrated carbohydrates. These functional groups provide the available reactive sites with a high capacity for metal ion adsorption. In the second step, carbon microspheres containing palladium nanoparticles (Pd-CMS) were obtained by dispersing carbon in aqueous palladium solution and then adding sodium format solution at ambient temperature. In following, the copper was loaded onto the surface of the carbon containing palladium nanoparticles by hydrothermal method to achieve carbon microspheres containing palladium nanoparticles and copper (Cu-Pd-CMS). Thus, by heating a mixture of metal ions solution and carbon spheres at 180°C, metal ions are accumulated near the hydrophilic shell during the hydrothermal treatment. Finally, by calcination of the carbon microspheres containing palladium nanoparticles and copper at 550°C in air to remove the carbon sphere template, Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structures were obtained. In order to find the best morphology of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structures, the effect of duration of the hydrothermal processing in the range of 8, 16, 24, and 32 hours were examined. As shown in Fig. 1 a, when the reaction mixture is heated for 8 hours under a hydrothermal process at 180°C and then a spherical carbon template is removed during the calcination process at 550°C, nanoparticles were formed with a size of about 100 nm and the expected spherical structures are not observed. In the hydrothermal processing time of 16 h, spheres with approximately 1µm in diameter, and the empty space in this structure that results from the removal of carbon as a template are clearly visible (Fig. 1b). However, in these structures, it seems that the nanoparticles do not regularly cover the carbon template and a regular and uniform shell of Pd.PdO.CuO is not formed and the structure does not have high strength. In another approach to synthesis of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow sphere, once the hydrothermal processing time is increased to 24 h, uniform spheres with a diameter of about 1µm, dense shell and rough surface were formed. In addition, SEM image with a higher magnification shows the fractures in the structure shells as a result of carbon dioxide removing from the pores during calcination. Finally, in the reaction time of 32 h, the nanoparticles have agglomerated and formed an integrated structure of Pd.PdO.CuO, and the hollow structures cannot be detected. Therefore, 24 hour treatment was chosen as the best hydrothermal duration for synthesis of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow sphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles was confirmed through ICP and EDS analysis. The palladium amount of the synthesized hollow structure was determined by means of ICP analysis as 0.027 mmol.g−1. In order to further study the morphology and structure of the synthesized sample, TEM and HRTEM images of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the as-prepared sample is spherical in shape with a diameter about 1 µm. The contrast between the pale intervals and dark edges confirms the hollow interior structure. Also, in the TEM image, it seems that the Pd nanoparticles are attached to the CuO shell and distributed in the interior void of the hollow spheres. It is worth mentioning that the HRTEM images also clearly show the lattice spacing 0.26, 0.11 and 0.22 nm which corresponded to planes of (002) of PdO, (311) and (111) of Pd, confirming the existence of PdO and Pd nanoparticles. Moreover, the fringes with lattice spacing of 0.24 nm and 0.19 nm can be attributed to (002) and (111) of CuO, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 3 a, the XRD pattern show peaks at 2θ values 32.60, 35.61, 38.82, 48.90, 53.68, 58.38, 61.70, 66.50, 68.20, 72.70 and 75.28 attributed to (110), (002), (111), (222), (112), (202), (020), (202), (311), (220), and (311) planes that related to high crystalline structure of CuO (PDF data JCPDS #00-045-0937). Also, the XRD pattern of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure present the peaks at 2θ values of 40.15 (111), 46.75 (200), 82.45 (311) and 86.70 (222) indicating the presence of Pd (PDF data JCPDS # 01-087-0639). In addition, the peaks identified at 2θ value 34.90 and 54.7 which corresponded to (002) and (110) plane can be attributed to PdO (PDF data JCPDS # 01-085-0713). As clearly seen in Fig. 3b, the peak intensity of Pd.PdO.CuO is lower compared to pattern of CuO. It seems that the entrapment of Pd into CuO structure results in a decrease of the peak intensity. The porosity of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure was studied by using the nitrogen sorption isotherm at 77 K. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the N2 adsorption–desorption curve of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure displayed a typical type IV isotherm with hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P0 ) range of 0.3–1.0. The clear hysteresis loop at high relative pressure is attributed to the extensive mesoporous structure of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas, total pore volume and mean pore diameter of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure were measured as 67.56 and 0.58 cm3 g−1 and 34.41 nm, respectively. The corresponding pore-size distribution of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure was determined about 46.13 nm by using the BJH method from the desorption branch of the isotherm (Fig. 4b). In the following, a series of mixed metal oxides, (MxOy: M= Zn, La, Mn)-CuO hollow structures, were prepared through hydrothermal pathway (Scheme 2 ). Crystalline structures and the morphology of the synthesized samples were also investigated utilizing XRD, FESEM and elemental mapping analysis. The phase characteristics of MnO2-CuO, La2O3-CuO and ZnO-CuO hollow structure were investigated from the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 5 . The characteristic peaks of CuO specie are evident in diffractograms of all tree synthesized samples, according to JCPDS#01-072-0629. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ= 12.8, 27.8, 48.9, 65.8 in diffractogram of mixed MnO2-CuO sample according to JCPDS#00-001-0799 can be attributed to MnO2 specie (Fig. 6 a). The characteristic peaks observed for La2O3 in the mixed La2O3-CuO sample are in good agreement with JCPDS#01-074-1144 (Fig. 6b). The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 31.8, 34.5, 36.3, 47.6, 56.6 and 62.9 are attributed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110) and (103) plans of ZnO in the mixed ZnO-CuO sample according to JCPDS# 01-007-2551 (Fig. 6c). The morphology and size of the prepared ZnO-CuO, La2O3-CuO and MnO2-CuO structures were investigated mainly through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fig. 6a shows the morphology of the ZnO-CuO hollow microspheres as a spherical shape with an average size of about 1µm. Also, high magnification SEM image of this structure exhibits that the shell wall is composed of nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 10 nm. In addition, the hollow structure can be clearly identified from the broken spheres. The SEM image in Fig. 6b confirms that the as-synthesized uniform La2O3-CuO hollow microspheres possess spherical and cavity structures with diameter about 2µm. The magnified image of La2O3-CuO hollow microspheres exhibits many pores on the shells, showing the formation of microporous shell. It is remarkable that many pores on the shell can be clearly observed in magnified image of La2O3-CuO hollow microspheres, implying an open pore structure on the surface. Also, the structure of the as synthesized MnO2-CuO was investigated by FESEM image as shown in Fig. 6c. It can be observed that the main product is MnO2-CuO nanoparticles with diameter of about 100 nm, instead of expected hollow structure and the reason for this needs further investigation in the future. In addition, the elemental mapping results of the synthesized samples show that Cu, Zn, La, Mn and O were distributed homogeneously throughout the structures (Fig. 6(d-l)). After the successful preparation and characterization of the synthesized structures, catalytic performance of these nanocatalysts were explored in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (200 mM) as model reaction in the presence of H2O2 (500 mM) as the oxidant at reaction temperature of 373 K for 3h using 0.07 g of as mentioned catalysts. The obtained results in Table 1 represent the best production yield of benzaldehyde was achieved using Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure. The Pd.PdO.CuO catalyst showed the yield of about 98%, while the production yield of other catalyst including CuO, CuO.ZnO, La2O3-CuO and MnO2-CuO were 63, 70, 87 and 83 %, respectively. The best synthesized sample (Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure) was applied for further investigation. The time-dependent UV–Vis spectral changes were used to monitor the progress of the reaction. The BzOH solution displays the original absorption peak at 210 nm. In the presence of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure, the peak intensity of benzyl alcohol at 210 nm significantly declines as the reaction proceeds and a new absorption peak at 250 nm observed, due to the formation of benzaldehyde, as shown in Fig. 7 . Initially, the reaction order by using Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure catalyst was determined by considering eq1. (1) R = − d [ benzyl alcohol ] / dt = k obs [ Catalyst ] 1 [ benzyl alcohol ] α [ H 2 O 2 ] β The α value was determined by changing the benzyl alcohol concentration between 50 and 200 mM at a fixed H2O2 concentration (500 mM). Similarly, reaction order β was obtained by changing the concentration of H2O2 between 200 and 500mM while keeping the benzyl alcohol concentration at 200 mM. In Figure 8 , the achieved r values using the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure catalyst are represented in logarithmic plots as a function of concentration benzaldehyde and H2O2. Reaction orders α and β were determined graphically from Figure 8b and 8d to be 1.16 with a satisfactory correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99 and 0.98 with a satisfactory correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99, respectively. In the following, to optimize the reaction conditions for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding benzaldehyde, different reaction condition including solvent type, reaction temperature, amount of oxidant and catalyst mole percentage were investigated. First, in order to distinguish the best solvent and temperature, diverse solvents such as water, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate and n-hexane were studied at 298, 323 and 353 K during the reaction time. As displayed in Fig. 9 , for all solvents the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde increases with increasing reaction temperature to 353 K. The highest conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in water and acetonitrile was obtained, while the other solvents n-hexane and ethyl acetate revealed lower conversion at 353 K, respectively. So as to survey further, using the experimental data, the apparent reaction rate constants were calculated and tabulated in Table 2 . As indicated in this table, the reaction rate constant of water as solvent is significantly higher than the reaction rate constant of other solvents in all temperatures. Also, according to the calculated reaction rate constants (k) at each reaction temperature in the range of 298-353 K, the activation energy may be measured using the Arrhenius equation: (2) k = k 0 exp ( − E A R T ) where EA is the activation energy and k0 is the frequency factor. The activation energies of different reaction media are indicated in Table 2. The activation energy of reaction in water has the lowest quantity, which is in good agreement with its significantly higher reaction rate and production yield. The effect of concentration of hydrogen peroxide (200 mM, 300 mM and 500 mM) on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol was surveyed. The conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde increases upon increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations. As shown in Fig. 10 a, the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde increases from 48% without oxidant to 57% and 98% using 100mM and 300mM hydrogen peroxide concentration at 180 min, respectively. After 150 min the oxidation of benzyl alcohol reached completion at 500mM hydrogen peroxide concentration. Also, the kobs for benzyl alcohol oxidation increases from 0.0052 h−1 at 200 mM H2O2 to 0.00834 h−1 and 0.0181 h−1 at 300 and 500 mM H2O2, respectively (Fig. 10b). As shown in Fig. 8d, a linear relationship between H2O2 concentration and kobs (R2 = 0.99) was observed. These results obviously show that 500 mM hydrogen peroxide concentrations is optimal for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol catalyzed with Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure. In the next step, the effect of catalyst amount on the conversion and rate oxidation of benzyl alcohol was studied. According to Fig. 11 a, in the absence of the catalyst no product was detected from oxidation of the benzyl alcohol. .The conversion is increased from about 44% to 98% by increasing the catalyst amount from 0.005 to 0.05 g, but further increasing the catalyst amount up to 0.07 g does not show important development in the reaction conversion. As shown in Fig. 11b, the kobs for oxidation of benzyl alcohol increases from 0.0020 h−1 at 0.005 g catalyst to 0.0181 h−1 at 0.05 g catalyst. Due to the small difference in kobs for 0.05 and 0.07 g of catalyst, based on these results the optimal amount of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure is 0.05 g. To assess the efficiency of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure catalytic system for the oxidation of the alcohols, various alcohols possessing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents in the aromatic ring were studied. Benzyl alcohols bearing electron-donating substituents such as OCH3 and CH3 were successfully converted to the corresponding benzaldehyde with excellent yield (Table 3 , entries 2, 3). Also, the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohols containing withdrawing substituents such as –Cl and –NO2 were also transformed in high yields to the desired benzaldehyde product (Table 3, entries 4-7). According to steric effect that has been observed, the existence of donating/withdrawing groups, ortho or meta increased the reaction time than at the para position. Note that Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure also shows a high activity for the oxidation of secondary alcohols; for example, 1-phenylethan-1-ol and 1-phenylpropan-1-ol were oxidized to corresponding ketones in 95 and 97% yield, respectively (Table 3, entries 8, 9). Therefore, these investigation demonstrated Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure catalyst system was also effective for the oxidation of alcohols with high yields and short reaction times in water. To confirm the stability and heterogeneity of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure during the catalytic process, the reaction was performed under the optimized conditions and the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure catalyst was separated in hot from the reaction mixture at 67% creating benzaldehyde after 60 min. Then, the reaction was permitted to continue 360 min further without catalyst. It was found that no advance was achieved after removal of the catalyst from the reaction mixture. Therefore, it can be concluded that the examined oxidation reaction over the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure was performing through the heterogeneous route. Also, the reusability of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure for oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol were examined to investigate the stability of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure. The catalyst was investigated in six successive reaction oxidation of benzyl alcohol. After completion each reaction the catalyst was separated via filtration and washed with ethanol and distilled water for tree times. Then, the catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven and applied in the next synthesis run for six times without any significant change in catalytic conversion and selectivity. The results are displayed in Figure 12 . To confirm the crystal structure of the synthesized Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure, the XRD analysis of 6th recovered Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure was investigated. As can be seen in Fig. 13 , no significant changes in the crystal structure of the catalyst occurred even after six recycling runs. The palladium amount of catalyst after 6 recycling runs was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as 0.021 mmol.g−1. Finally, in order to estimate the suitability of Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure, the catalytic activity of the Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure was compared with those of some related reported methods in the literature for oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol (as shown in Table 4 ). As it is evident from Table 4, the selective formation of benzaldehyde in excellent yield, short reaction time, milder reaction conditions and employing any hazardous solvents are salient features of the present work. Therefore, Pd.PdO.CuO hollow structure can be considered as efficient catalyst in oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol."
