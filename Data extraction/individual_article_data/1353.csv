0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels have caused environmental, economic, and diplomatic problems due to their pollutant emissions, regional maldistribution, and limited existence [1,2]. In searching for a new alternative energy source, worldwide interest in H 2 energy is accelerating because it produces only water when combusted, generating a 2.75-fold higher energy yield (122kJ/g) than hydrocarbon fuels. In addition, H 2 can be directly used to produce electricity through fuel cells [1,3,4]. Over 90% of H 2 is made by steam reforming gas which is a relatively mature technology. This technology is shunned by the public and experts because it requires high energy input, usually supplied from fossil fuels and produces CO 2 and H 2 S . However, biological H 2 production is recognized as an environmentally friendly and cost effective method. Biological H 2 production methods are divided into photosynthetic and fermentative processes [5,6]. Although the photosynthetic process is an ultimate energy production method requiring only water and light, there are many technical obstacles such as high activation energy and low light conversion efficiency. The fermentative process has advantages such as a fast production rate, technical simplicity, waste reduction, and no requirement of additional light [6–8]. The main concept of fermentative H 2 production is to block H 2 consumption by methanogens which is produced by anaerobic acidogenesis. Eqs. (i) and (ii) simply describe the reactions involved in fermentative hydrogen production from organic substances [7,8]. (i) Glucose + 2 H 2 O → 2 Acetate + 2 CO 2 + 4 H 2 , Δ G = - 184.2 kJ , (ii) Glucose → Butyrate + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 , Δ G = - 257.1 kJ . Pure cultures known to produce H 2 , from carbohydrates include species of Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium. However, most studies have focused on Clostridium spp. because they have the highest H 2 yield ( 1.61 – 2.36 mol H 2 / mol glucose ) and they are abundant in natural environments [8]. Clostridium spp., which are obligate anaerobic bacteria, form spores when the environment is unsuitable. Thus, mixed cultures of H 2 -producing bacteria (HPB) are prepared by heat or chemical shock of anaerobic digester sludge, activated sludge, soil, compost, and manure [8–13]. Additionally, H 2 fermentation reactors should be operated at short hydraulic retention time (HRT; 8–12h) and low pH (5–6) to limit methanogenic activity [8,14]. The revival of H 2 -consuming methanogenic activity is sometimes reported in continuous operations using pretreated sludge as the inoculum [15]. A decrease in H 2 production accompanying H 2 -consuming propionate production has also been reported [16]. These results indicate the potential growth of H 2 -consuming microorganisms, whose abundance is reduced by pretreatment but not completely exterminated. To avoid the above problems, injection of nitrate, operation at pH 4.5, and N 2 sparging were applied during continuous operations [15,16]. However, these behaviors have not been fully demonstrated in the start-up period, although this period is important in determining the microbial population in the following long-term operation. In usual start-ups, the continuous H 2 fermentation process is followed by batch operation to activate HPB in pretreated seeding sludge. The continuous operation starts when the H 2 yield (HY) reaches 0.5 mol H 2 / mol hexose added or after 48h in batch mode [17,18]. However, researchers have not examined reactor performance during the start-up period. Therefore, we propose a start-up strategy to achieve reliable, continuous H 2 production. H 2 , metabolites, and microbial populations during the start-up period were monitored."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge,"2.1 Seed sludge The seed sludge was taken from an anaerobic digester in a local wastewater treatment plant. The pH, alkalinity, and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the sludge were 7.6, 2.83 g CaCO 3 / L , and 5.3 g / L , respectively. The sludge was heat-treated at 90 ∘ C for 15min to inactivate hydrogen consumers and to harvest spore-forming anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium spp. [18]."
3,Substrate,"2.2 Substrate Sucrose (25g chemical oxygen demand [COD]/L) was used as a substrate. Concentrations of NH 4 Cl , KH 2 PO 4 , and FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O were added to create a COD:N:P:Fe ratio of 100:5:1:0.33. The feed also contained the following nutrients (in mg/L): NaHCO 3 , 1000; MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 100; CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 75; Na 2 MoO 4 · 4 H 2 O , 0.01; H 3 BO 3 , 0.05; MnCl 2 · 4 H 2 O , 0.5; ZnCl 2 , 0.05; CuCl 2 , 0.03; NiCl 2 · 6 H 2 O , 0.05; CoCl 2 · 2 H 2 O , 0.5; Na 2 SeO 3 , 0.05 [19]."
4,Reactor operation,"2.3 Reactor operation In this study, a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) was used with a working volume of 5.0L (325mm high by 140mm inner diameter [ID]). The COD loading rate was maintained at 50g/Ld during the whole operation, which corresponded to 12h of HRT. The reactors were mixed by mechanical stirring at 100rpm. The pH was kept at 5.3 ± 0.1 using a pH sensor, pH controller, and 3M potassium hydroxide. Gas production was monitored by the water displacement method and was corrected to standard temperature ( 0 ∘ C ) and pressure (760mmHg; STP). All experiments were conducted in a constant temperature room at 35 ± 1 ∘ C . After seeding with the heat-treated sludge, the reactor was purged with N 2 gas for 10min to provide anaerobic conditions. Continuous operation started when the HY reached 0.5 and 0.2 mol H 2 / mol hexose added in the batch mode for the first and second trials, respectively. We used HY as a signal for switchover because it has been commonly used and compared as an indicator of H 2 production, and it is more practical to monitor than other parameters such as specific and volumetric H 2 production rates (HPR) [8,14,17,19]."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen content in the biogas was determined by gas chromatography (GC; Gow Mac series 580) using a thermal conductivity detector and a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with a molecular sieve (5A) and with N 2 as a carrier gas. The CH 4 , N 2 , and CO 2 contents were measured using the same model GC with a 1.8 m × 3.2 mm stainless-steel column packed with porapak Q (80/100 mesh) and using helium as a carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector, detector, and column were kept at 80, 90, and 50 ∘ C , respectively. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, C 2 – C 6 ) and lactate were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Finnigan Spectra SYSTEM LC, Thermo Electron Co.) with an ultraviolet (210nm) detector (UV1000, Thermo Electron) and a 100 × 7.8 - mm Fast Acid Analysis column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using 0.005M H 2 SO 4 as the mobile phase. Aliphatic alcohol was determined using another HPLC (DX-600, Dionex) with an electrochemical detector (ED50A, Dionex) and a 250 × 9 - mm IonPac ICE-AS1 column (Dionex) using 50mM HClO 4 as the mobile phase. The liquid samples were pretreated with a 0.45 - μ m membrane filter before injection. COD and VSS were measured according to standard methods [20]. Glucose concentration was determined by the colorimetric method of Dubois et al. [21]."
6,Microbial analysis,"2.5 Microbial analysis To analyze the microbial communities, DNA in the sludge was sampled at each start-up and extracted using an Ultraclean Soil DNA Kit (Cat # 12800-50; Mo Bio Laboratory Inc., USA). The 16S rDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The region corresponding to positions 357–518 in the 16S rDNA of Escherichia coli was PCR-amplified using the forward primer EUB357f ( 5 ′ -CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG- 3 ′ ) with a GC clamp ( 5 ′ -CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGGCCCGCCGCCCCCGCC CC- 3 ′ ) at the 5 ′ end to stabilize the melting behavior of the DNA fragments and the reverse primer UNIV518r ( 5 ′ -ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG- 3 ′ ). PCR amplification was conducted in an automated thermal cycler (MWG-Bio TECH, Germany) using the following protocol; initial denaturation for 4min at 94 ∘ C , annealing for 40s at 55 ∘ C , and extension for 1min at 72 ∘ C , followed by a final extension for 8min at 72 ∘ C . PCR mixtures had a final volume of 50 μ L , consisting of 10 × PCR buffer, 0.8mM MgSO 4 , 0.5mM of each primer, 0.1mM dNTP, 25pg template, and 1U polymerase. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% (w/v) agarose gel in 1 × TAE for 30min at 50V, and then stained with ethidium bromide to confirm amplification. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was carried out using the Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (BioRad, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1 × TAE buffer for 480min at 70V and 60 ∘ C on polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) containing a linear gradient ranging from 40% to 60% denaturant. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was stained with ethidium bromide for 30min and then visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator. Most bands were excised from the DGGE polyacrylamide gel for 16S rDNA sequencing. DNA was eluted from the excised bands by immersing them in 20 μ L of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 1 day. They were then PCR-amplified with the forward primer EUB357f without a GC clamp and the reverse primer UNIV518r. After PCR amplification, PCR products were purified with using a Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold (MILLIPORE com., USA). All strands of the purified PCR products were sequenced with the primer EUB357f using an ABIPRISM Big Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A search of GenBank was conducted using the BLAST program."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Reactor performance in the unsuccessful start-up,"3.1 Reactor performance in the unsuccessful start-up Fig. 1 shows the HPR and HY of the first trial. A drastic decrease in HPR was observed after the switchover from batch to continuous operation. Net H 2 consumption was detected at 18–60h. Although H 2 production increased to 0.5 mol H 2 / mol hexose added on day 4, it decreased again during further operation No CH 4 was detected during the whole fermentation period. The fermentation of organics to generate H 2 always accompanies the production of VFAs and solvents. Butyrate production is related to H 2 production when using mixed cultures [17,19]. Fig. 2 depicts the fluctuation of VFA concentration in the first trial. The butyrate concentration increased to 4000mgCOD/L in the batch operation and increased to 11,000mgCOD/L by 12h, with high H 2 production. However, it then decreased until 72h, with low H 2 production, while the propionate concentration increased to 5000mgCOD/L. Propionate is produced by H 2 consumption and lactate degradation as shown in Eqs. (iii) and (iv) [16,22]. Although Clostridium spp., which are H 2 -producing and spore-forming bacteria, have the ability to produce propionate, Selenomonas spp., and Propionicbacteria, which are non-spore-forming bacteria are the major propionic acid bacteria (PAB) in indigenous mixed anaerobic microbial communities. Some PAB inhibit other microorganisms by secreting bacteriocin [23]. (iii) Glucose + 2 H 2 → 2 Propionate + 2 H 2 O , (iv) 3 Lactate → Acetate + 2 Propionate . As the propionate concentration was insignificant after batch operation, it appears that PAB were inhibited by heat-treatment of the anaerobic digester sludge. However, the increase in propionate production during continuous operation indicates the PAB recovered to a normal state and multiplied during continuous operation. Thus, the drastic H 2 production decrease in the start-up period might result from competitive and inhibitory effects of PAB on HPB. The sludge collection location and start-up strategy used in this study were the same as those used by Kim et al. [17], who successfully achieved continuous H 2 production. However, Kim et al. [17] obtained sludge more than 2 years prior to this study. A difference in digester conditions due to the time gap might have resulted in changes of the microbial population and activity of the sludge. Therefore, we needed a more reliable start-up strategy."
9,Hypothesis for a successful start-up,"3.2 Hypothesis for a successful start-up Since lactate and propionate are not main byproducts of Clostridium spp., a change in the microbial population was suspected to be the main reason for the decreased H 2 production during the start-up period. The microbial consortium in anaerobic digester sludge can be simplified, as shown in Fig. 3 (a): Clostridium spp., methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and PAB. Only Clostridium spp. and some of the spore-forming LAB can survive heat-treatment, and would thus become major microorganisms after batch operation (Fig. 3b and c). Although the amount could be insignificant, non-spore-forming bacteria might survive that were inhibited by heat-shock but not completely killed. SRB and methanogens would be eliminated due to improper pH and HRT, but PAB and LAB could live together with HPB (Fig. 3d). It took about 10h to reach an HY of 0.5 mol H 2 / mol hexose added in the batch mode during the first trial. We assumed that the unsuccessful start-up resulted from providing enough time for the PAB and LAB to propagate. Although a shorter batch duration also could decrease Clostridium spp. abundance, their relative abundance would be higher than with a longer batch duration because LAB and PAB are more inhibited than spore-forming bacteria by heat-shock (Fig. 3 c ′ ). An increased Clostridium portion might be beneficial for stable H 2 production in the continuous operation (Fig. 3 d ′ ). Therefore, we hypothesized that an earlier switchover from batch to continuous operation could minimize the survival of non-spore-forming bacteria, resulting in successful continuous H 2 production."
10,Reactor performance during a successful start-up,"3.3 Reactor performance during a successful start-up The operation mode was changed from batch to continuous after an HY of 0.2 mol H 2 / mol hexose added was obtained during the second trial. Although HPR decreased at first, it increased again after 36h, and stable H 2 production equivalent to 0.8 mol H 2 / mol hexose added was achieved after 10 days (Fig. 4 ). Butyrate production accompanied H 2 production, as in the first trial. However, the propionate concentration was lower than 2000mgCOD/L (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 6 depicts the variation in total VFA and alcohol concentrations during the second trial. The total VFA concentration increased to 10,000mgCOD/L at 12h, but then decreased during days 1–4, whereas the total alcohol concentration increased to 5000mgCOD/L. The VFA and alcohol concentrations were maintained at 10,000 and 4000mgCOD/L, respectively, after day 6. The alcohol mostly consisted of ethanol. It is generally accepted that H 2 production by Clostridium spp. is related to VFA production, and not alcohol production. Alcohols are produced at low pH, high H 2 partial pressure, in the low growth phase, and under VFA accumulation conditions [24,25]. Clostridium spp. gain 3 and 4mol of ATP when they produce butyrate and acetate, respectively, whereas they gain only 2mol of ATP when they produce alcohols from 1mol of glucose. The main reason for alcohol production, despite its low energy yield, is to block the penetration of VFAs into the cell, which is called a “self-detoxification mechanism.” VFA consumption metabolism by combining with glucose and finally converting to alcohol has also been reported [25]. Among the many kinds of VFAs, butyrate has the most toxic effect on microorganisms; the unionized form is more toxic than the dissociated form. The p K a of butyrate (4.81) is relatively higher than that of other VFAs ( p K a of propionate, acetate, and lactate = 4.87 , 4.76, and 3.86, respectively) [26,27]. The alcohol concentration increased during days 1–3, whereas the VFA concentration decreased (Fig. 6). Thus, the H 2 production decrease at the early stage in the successful start-up might have been due to the self-detoxification mechanism of microorganisms in response to VFAs."
11,Performance of the successful and unsuccessful start-ups,"3.4 Performance of the successful and unsuccessful start-ups Average performance parameters in the successful and unsuccessful start-ups are compared in Table 1 . Low propionate production due to the early switchover from batch to continuous operation resulted in a successful start-up. The biomass concentration and substrate removal were lower in the successful start-up due to the shorter batch operation. The biomass concentration was 6500 and 3500mgVSS/L after batch operation in the successful and unsuccessful start-ups, respectively (Fig. 7 ). Whereas the biomass concentration continuously decreased to 2000mgVSS/L in the unsuccessful start-up, it increased to 5000mgVSS/L and then decreased to lower than 1000mgVSS/L in the successful start-up. The biomass concentration and substrate removal can be increased with high H 2 productivity by adopting high-rate configurations such as attached-growth processes or anaerobic sequencing batch reactor in the following continuous operation. Biomass consisting mainly of HPB in this start-up period would prevent the growth of unwanted non-HPB [28,29]."
12,Microbial analysis,"3.5 Microbial analysis Fig. 8 illustrates the DGGE profiles of the 16S rDNA gene fragment amplified from the sludge sampled in the successful and unsuccessful start-ups. The major bands were excised and purified for sequencing. Table 2 shows the results of sequence affiliation, isolated microorganisms, and their main carbohydrate metabolites. In total, nine species were detected. Only three species appeared in the successful start-up, Streptococcus bovis, Clostridium pasteurianum, and Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum, which are LAB, HPB, and acetate-producing bacteria, respectively. In addition to these three species, Streptococcus downi, Selenomonas genomosp, Selenomonas ruminantium, Selenomonas sp., Clostridium acidisoli, and Clostridium butyricum appeared in the unsuccessful start-up. PAB were detected only in the unsuccessful start-up, which agrees with our hypothesis regarding why this start-up failed. Therefore, an early switchover from batch to continuous mode resulted in the successful start-up of continuous fermentative H 2 production by suppressing PAB. As the successful start-up strategy provided a short retention time during batch mode, resulting in wash-out of non-HPB, these results could be related to a short HRT preference in fermentative H 2 production [8,12,29]. In addition, we emphasize that the proposed strategy is just one successful start-up strategy Further decreasing the HRT and more stringent pretreatment of seed sludge are other start-up strategies that require further study."
13,Conclusions,"A successful start-up strategy for continuous H 2 production was proposed following detailed observations of H 2 , metabolites, and the microbial population at an early stage. The principal findings are as follows. (1) Continuous H 2 production failed when the operation mode was changed from batch to continuous mode after an HY of 0.5 mol H 2 / mol hexose added was reached. This failure resulted from the growth of PAB during the batch operation, which had been inhibited by heat-shock but not completely killed. (2) Early switchover (HY of 0.2 mol H 2 / mol hexose added ) from batch to continuous mode produced successful start-up for continuous fermentative H 2 production by suppressing PAB. (3) Early H 2 production fluctuation in the continuous mode might be due to the self-detoxification mechanism of HPB to VFAs, as well as regrowth of PAB."
