0,Introduction,"The industrial hydrogen demand is expected to grow, due for instance on the short term, to substantial additional hydrogen requirements to produce higher quality gasoline from low-grade oil, or to produce liquid fuels from coal [1], or on the long term, to the hydrogen economy. At present, over 95% of the hydrogen produced is derived from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, thus is not sustainable [2]. To be sustainable, hydrogen production has to be based on renewable energy using solar, wind, and biomass sources [3]. For instance, hydrogen can be extracted from carbohydrate-rich substrates (including industrial and municipal organic wastes, agriculture residues, biosolids, even energy crops) using dark anaerobic fermentation processes which would use similar hardware to that used currently in industrial methane fermentation, so bioreactor technologies are readily available [2,4–7]. Yet the H2 yield of carbohydrates’ dark fermentation is barely above 0.5 mol H2/C-mol (compared to a stoichiometric H2 potential of 2 mol/C-mol). Additionally a significant portion of biomass is difficultly and/or slowly biodegradable by microorganisms, due to its refractory and polymeric nature. When the organic residue is relatively dry (e.g. woodchips, bug wood …) or non-biodegradable (bark, plastic, rubber ….), it might be more appropriate to use thermochemical conversion techniques such as gasification, which results in a synthesis gas (syngas) mainly composed of carbon monoxide (CO), CO2 and hydrogen. Syngas can be used directly to power industrial boilers, gas turbines or fuel cells to make electricity. As well syngas can be upgraded into H2 using catalytic water-gas shift reaction. Catalyzed chemical processes are well established. They normally involve high pressure and/or temperature, may be problematic when impurities are present and tend to have low product specificity [8]. To circumvent these disadvantages and use milder treatments with minimal chemical and energy, biologically-mediated water-gas shift (WGS) reaction could be used to convert the carbon monoxide contained in syngas into hydrogen. Biological WGS reaction is catalyzed by an increasing number of carboxydotrophic microorganisms using CO as a preferred electron donor [9] and could become a cost-effective technology for upgrading syngas into hydrogen. Those microbes contain an intricate enzymatic system initiated by the oxidation of CO to CO2 by a CO-dehydrogenase (CODH) [10–12] and closed by the reduction of two protons to form H2 [13]. Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans is one of those CO-oxidizing (carboxydotrophic) bacterial species that have been isolated and are able of forming H2 from CO [12,14–17]. C. hydrogenoformans is an extreme-thermophilic anerobic bacterium that grows fast on CO as the sole carbon and energy source (doubling time 2 h) at optimal temperature of 70 °C. Microbial growth by conversion of CO to H2 and CO2 using C. hydrogenoformans (DSM6008) was first shown by Svetlichny in 1991 [14], then studied in more details by Henstra and Stams [16,17], with different medium compositions as listed in Table 1 . Cultures of C. hydrogenoformans on the medium as formulated by the strain supplier (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, DSMZ) unexpectedly showed after enrichment, based on the ratio of volatile suspended solids (VSS) to the suspended solids (SS) and elemental analysis, a large content in inorganic material, i.e. 93.6 ± 3% of cell dry weight (dr. wt). This was confirmed by the rather elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus contained in the grown biomass. As an excessive production of those minerals may interfere with the growth and catabolism rates as well as clog up biofilm-based reactors, it is desirable to minimize the accumulation during growth, while keeping at maximal levels both the H2 yield and bioactivity rate. Alike any fermentation activity, biohydrogen production requires a medium formulation which could satisfy the elemental requirements for cell growth and catabolite production [2,18–22]. Because of the large number of nutritional components that are potentially essential and the number of interactions to evaluate, it is impractical to choose a design method including all the factors that need to be considered. However, a variety of experimental design methods can be used to investigate optimum parameters for maximum yield and rate; among them is the Taguchi’s method [23–26]. The Taguchi method is based on a fractional factorial design and allows an experiment to be complete with only a fraction of all possible experimental combinations of variable values [27]. The method determines the effect of variables and noise factors by a «signal to noise ratio » which equally considers the effectiveness with which objectives have been attained and the degree of variability that has been experienced. As a result, with the aid of the range and variance analysis, the key factors that have significant effects on a response can be identified and the best factor levels for a given process can be determined from the pre-determined factor levels [24,25,28,29]. While some nutrients at a sub-optimal level may only limit the bioactivity, other nutrients or components in excess to the optimal level may inhibit the bioactivity or stimulate the production of non-desirable co-metabolites or secondary products [28]. It is assumed that it is what occurred actually during the growth of C. hydrogenoformans with the medium used. Considering the literature data referring to the growth defined media composition (Table 1) two anions, PO 4 3 − and HCO 3 − , and two cations, Ca2+, Mg2+, were identified as the potential major factors of minerals’ accumulation during the C. hydrogenoformans growth. NH4Cl and Na2S were only provided as the nitrogen source and the reducing agent, respectively. As well, NiCl2 was added as a cofactor to stimulate the bioactivity rate [30]. Hence the objective of the present study was to determine their optimal concentrations via an experimental design according to the Taguchi’s orthogonal method, using three levels for each factor, and considering the culture calcium and phosphorus (Ca + P) content, the H2 yield and the SHPR as optimization criteria."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Culture,"2.1 Culture C. hydrogenoformans DSM6008 was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH). The strain was cultivated under strictly anaerobic conditions at 70 °C and 100 rpm in basal mineral medium buffered with bicarbonate-phosphate as described by DSMZ. The original medium formulation obtained from DSMZ contained (g/L): NH4Cl (0.33), MgCl2·6H2O (0.52), CaCl2·6H2O (0.33), KCl (0.33), KH2PO4 (0.33), yeast extract (0.5), Na2S·9H2O (0.3). This media was then supplemented with 10 ml/L trace metals solution and 10 ml/L of vitamins solution according to Stams [31]. The initial pH was always maintained between 6.8 and 7.0. The initial biomass was a culture enrichment prepared on the DSM medium and had an inorganic content of 88.5 ± 0.6 and 90 ± 3% dr. wt in the optimization and validation phases of the study, respectively."
3,Specific activity tests,"2.2 Specific activity tests The carboxydotrophic (CO-oxidizing) specific activity tests were performed in triplicate in 120 ml serum bottles. Both substrate (CO) depletion and catabolites (H2, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols) production rates were monitored. The biomass and its mineral content were also quantified at the end of each test. Briefly once inoculated with 60 ml of culture and filled with buffer solutions, bottles were capped, sealed and flushed with 100% CO as sole carbon source, and placed in a rotary shaker (New Brunswick, Edison, NJ) in a dark, thermostatically controlled environment (70 ± 1 °C) and gyrated at 100 rpm. Besides the components tested ( PO 4 3 − , HCO 3 − , Ca2+ and Mg2+), the activity test media also contained: NH4Cl 28 mM, NiCl2 0.002 mM, Na2S·9H2O 0.83 mM, resazurin 0.05 mg/L, yeast extract 0.05 g/L, 10 ml of both trace metals and vitamins solutions prepared according to Stams [31]. All solutions were autoclaved, except the mother CaCl2·6H2O, MgCl2·7H2O and vitamins solutions, which were sterilized with 0.22-μm filters. The tests at neutral pH were pH-controlled by addition of 1 M HCl. The hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) was expressed as a percentage of the H2 gas produced per CO consumed (mol/mol). The specific H2 production rate (SHPR), expressed as mol H2/g VSS·d, was obtained by reporting the rate of H2 produced (mol/d) to the VSS-based biomass as estimated in the bottle."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Measurements of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS) and suspended volatile solid (VSS) were made according to standard methods [32]. COD-based biomass was converted into VSS using a factor of 1.30 g COD/g VSS according to the average elemental formula CH1.86O0.6N0.16 of anaerobic bacteria [33]. The cell’s mineral content was estimated by difference between SS and VSS. Phosphorus was determined colorimetrically [34] and calcium and metals, by inductively coupled plasma [35], both on the centrifuged, rinsed and resuspended culture. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs, i.e. acetic, propionic and butyric acids) were measured on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Wilmington, DE) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) on 0.2 μl samples fortified 1:1 (vol./vol.) using an internal standard of iso-butyric acid in 6% formic acid, directly injected on a glass column of 1 m × 2 mm Carbopack C (60–80 mesh) coated with 0.3% Carbowax 20 M and 0.1% H3PO4. The column was held at 130 °C for 4 min and helium was the carrier gas at a rate of 20 ml/min. The injector and the detector were both maintained at 200 °C. For measurement of solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetone, 2-propanol, tert-butanol, n-propanol, sec-butanol, n-butanol) 100 μl of liquid were transferred in 20 ml headspace vial crimped with Teflon coated septum. The vial was heated at 80 °C for 2 min, then 1000 μl of headspace gas were injected on a DB-ACL2 capillary column of 30 m × 530 mm × 2 μm using a Combipal autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Swizerland). The column was held at 40 °C for 10 min. Helium was the carrier gas at a head pressure of 5 psi. The injector and the detector were maintained at 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The gas composition (H2, CO, CO2) was measured by injecting 300 μl of gas (model 1750 gas-tight syringe, Hamilton, Reno, NV) taken from the bottle headspace after equilibrium at 70 °C into a HP 6890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a 11 m × 3.2 mm 60/80 mesh Chromosorb 102 packed column (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA). The column temperature was held at 60 °C for 7 min and increased to 225 °C at a rate of 60 °C per min. Argon was used as the carrier gas. The injector and detector were maintained at 125 °C and 150 °C respectively."
5,Experimental design and statistical analysis,"2.4 Experimental design and statistical analysis The experiments were designed according to the Taguchi’s orthogonal method [24]. The optimization criterion was primarily the minimum mineral cell content but the maximum hydrogen production yield and the specific hydrogen production rate were also considered. The selected factors included PO 4 3 − , HCO 3 − , Ca2+ and Mg2+ were examined using 3 levels for each factor in 9 experimental runs [orthogonal layout L9(34)]. The four variables and their levels (coded as 1, 2, 3) are given in Table 2 . The values chosen for the each level were based on the concentration range found in the literature. The response of the culture mineral content, the H2 yield and the SHPR to the 9 different combinations of the above four factors were evaluated using the range and variance analysis. Scores (response results) are summed for each factor and each level (k 1, k 2 and k 3, for levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively) as well as averaged (K1, K2 and K3, for levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The range (R) among the score averages is the difference between the highest and the lowest score average (K), i.e. Kmax−Kmin, for each factor. The R value is used to rank the four factors with respect to their impact to the optimization objectives and to evaluate the importance of their contribution to the variation of each objective. The analysis of variance is also used to determine the significance level of factors’ impact and rank them with respect to the variability magnitude [36]. The variance analysis is based on the sum of squares of deviations from the overall mean (SS), the degrees of freedom, dfF and dfError, respectively the degree of freedom of factor (A, B, C, or D) and of error, the mean square (MS) i.e. SS/dfF, and F. The dfF is the number of observations minus one (i.e. 2 in this study, where scores are based on triplicates). The dfError is the total number of observations minus one and minus the freedom degrees of each factor (i.e. dfError = n − 1 − dfA − dfB − dfC − dfD = 18). The F distribution ratio is given by the MS/MSError ratio. The MSError estimates the experimental error. In this study, the minimum MS of the four factors is considered as the experimental error considering that the unbiased estimates of the sum of squares are much smaller than the variance of the other factors. A factor is considered as having an impact which is statistically significant at a probability of 99% and 95% if the F ratio calculated for the factor evaluated is greater than the critical value of the F distribution with 2 and 18 df for a P-value of 0.01 and 0.05, F0.01(2,18) and F0.05(2,18), i.e. 6 and 3.6, respectively."
6,Results and discussion,"As mentioned above, cultures of C. hydrogenoformans grown on the defined medium as formulated by the strain supplier (DSMZ) showed a large content of inorganic material (up to 93.6% dr. wt). This was confirmed by the rather elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus, 39.0 and 19.2% dr. wt, respectively, which corresponded to 42 and 21% of the cell mineral content (ash), respectively. This Ca/P ratio is close to that of a few known calcium phosphates such as hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate [37,38]. Whereas a Serratia species has been shown to form crystals of calcium phosphate, identified as hydroxyapatite [39], such an attribute was never reported for C. hydrogenoformans. Therefore, should this excessive calcium phosphate production be avoided, the medium contents in PO 4 3 − , HCO 3 − , Ca2+ and Mg2+ were considered as potentially the major factors of the mineral accumulation. The results of the L9(34) orthogonal design are analyzed considering as optimization criteria: the cell Ca + P accumulation (to minimize) as well as the H2 yield and the SHPR (both to maximize) (Table 3 ). The parameters k1, k2, k3 and K1, K2, K3 are the summed and average scores (Ca + P %, Y H 2 , SHPR) of levels 1, 2 and 3, respectively, for each factor. The range of the scores (R) of levels 1, 2 and 3 is the maximal difference between the averages of the scores (K)."
7,Optimal medium content for minimum cell content in calcium and phosphorus,"3.1 Optimal medium content for minimum cell content in calcium and phosphorus Within the nine conditions experimented, the Ca + P content of the culture ranged from 4 to 38.9% dr. wt. The lowest experimental Ca + P content of cells (4%) was obtained at the seventh experimental run where: PO 4 3 − = 1.0 mM , HCO 3 − = 20.0 mM , Ca2+ = 0.1 mM, Mg2+ = 1.0 mM. The optimal concentration for each factor for the minimization of the cell Ca + P content is determined by the minimal value of K, which occurred at levels 3 for PO 4 3 − (K 3 = 8.74), 1 for HCO 3 − (K 1 = 14.75), 3 for Ca2+ (K 3 = 16.91) and 1 for Mg 2+ (K 1 = 17.52) (Table 3). Accordingly, the optimal medium composition would be as following (mM): PO 4 3 − 1.0 , HCO 3 − 20.0 , Ca2+ 0.1, Mg2+ 2.5. This is close to the results of the seventh run, and as expected, correspond to the lowest level of the concentration range tested for PO 4 3 − and Ca2+. Based on the magnitude of R, PO 4 3 − (with R = 19.15) appeared as the factor whose variation has the greatest impact on the variation of the Ca + P content of cells. Furthermore based on the variance analysis (Table 4 ), the phosphate effect on the Ca + P content of cells was significant, as indicated by the F test. The F ratio is equal to 7.9, which is higher than the critical value of the F distribution with 2 factors’ degrees of freedom (df), 18 error df, and a probability level (P-value) of 0.01 i.e. F0.01(2, 18) = 6. Therefore phosphate concentration clearly is the most important factor that rules the mineral accumulation by cells, explaining more than 40% of the Ca + P content variation."
8,Optimal medium content for maximum H2 yield,"3.2 Optimal medium content for maximum H2 yield Within the nine conditions experimented, the H2 yield reached a peak (92.7 ± 5.6%) at the sixth experimental run where: PO 4 3 − = 2.5 mM , HCO 3 − = 5.0 mM , Ca2+ = 2.0 mM, Mg2+ = 1.0 mM (Table 3). The lowest H2 yield was observed when the PO 4 3 − and HCO 3 − concentrations increased to 5 mM and 10 mM, respectively. Small amounts of VFAs and alcohols were also observed in the culture liquid at the end of the test. The highest metabolite amount observed in the liquid corresponded to 16% of the substrate consumed, 97% of which was acetate. As above, the optimal medium composition was determined from the K values, as 2.5 mM for PO 4 3 − , 5 .0 mM for HCO 3 − , 0 . 1 mM for Ca2+ and 0.5 mM for Mg2+ (Table 3). Based on the magnitude of R the factors could also be ranked as following: PO 4 3 − (R = 9.64) > HCO 3 − (R = 6.42) ≈ Ca2+ (R = 6.40) > Mg2+ (R = 2.84). Phosphate had the most important effect and explained with bicarbonate 60% of the H2 yield variability. The effect of those two major independent variables on the H2 yield is shown in the response surface plot of Fig. 1 . It is noteworthy that it was the middle phosphate concentration (level 2) which concurrently resulted in the highest H2 yields. The analysis of variance (Table 4) showed that the PO 4 3 − factor had the highest significant impact on the H2 yield at a 99% confidence level (P-value of 0.01) whereas HCO 3 − and Ca2 + had a significant impact only at a 95% confidence level (P-value of 0.05) and Mg2+ had no influence (F ratio = 1.0)."
9,Optimal medium content for maximum specific hydrogen production rate,"3.3 Optimal medium content for maximum specific hydrogen production rate The SHPR results obtained from the nine experimental runs of the L9(34) orthogonal design ranged between a maximum of 0.84 and a minimum of 0.35 mol H2/g VSS·d. As above, the optimal medium composition was determined from the K values, as following: PO 4 3 − 5.0 mM , HCO 3 − 5.0 mM , Ca2+ 0.1 mM, Mg2+ 0.5 mM (Table 3). Based on the magnitude of R the factors could also be ranked as following: Ca2+ (R = 0.256)> PO 4 3 − (R = 0.167) > Mg2+ (R = 0.153) > HCO 3 − (R = 0.068). Accordingly Ca2+ had greater impact than the other factors, explaining alone more than 40% of the SHPR variability. In addition, the variance analysis (Table 4) indicated a high significance of the role of Ca2+ on SHPR, while the PO 4 3 − and Mg2+ factors, whose F ratios were larger than the critical value of F0.05(2,18), had also a significant effect although at a lesser degree. The effect of the two major independent variables, Ca2+ and PO 4 3 − , on the SHPR is shown in the response surface plot of Fig. 2 . Most favorable Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration values for the SHPR are 0.1 and 0.5 mM, respectively (Table 3), while higher concentration of those cations might repress the H2 production rate, as shown in Fig. 3 ."
10,pH effect on cell mineral content and biological activity,"3.4 pH effect on cell mineral content and biological activity An important pH variation was observed during the tests, as the medium pH increased in some runs up to 8.9. Interestingly, the culture was able to grow and produce H2 at reasonable yield for a broader pH range than previously reported by Svetlichnyi [14]. On the other hand, pH value did affect the SHPR. At a given medium composition (for instance PO 4 3 − = 1.0 mM , HCO 3 − 1 = 5.0 mM , Ca+2 = 0.7 mM, Mg+2 = 2.5 mM as in the 9th experimental run), SHPR staid at 0.57 ± 0.05 mol/g VSS·d when the pH was kept neutral as compared to 0.35 ± 0.03 when pH rose to 7.8 (Table 3). This is consistent with literature, which reported optimal C. hydrogenoformans activity at neutral pH [14], while hydrogen dark fermentation also is often repressed at alkaline pH [6,40–42]. As well pH affected the cell mineral content. In Fig. 4 , the mineral content response surface has been plotted for different pH and PO 4 3 − concentrations, since the latter factor was the most effective on the calcium and phosphorus accumulation, as discussed in Section 3.1. A visual analysis of Fig. 4 reveals that a minimal Ca + P content (4 and 6%) could be obtained at highest PO 4 3 − concentration and at neutral and highest pH values (7.5 and 8.9 respectively). This is consistent with literature which reported that solubility of a Ca- and P-rich chemical, such as hydroxyapatite, increases in presence of carbonate and phosphate with the increase of pH [38,43]. Since biological activity as well as solubility of the mineral content varied with the pH independently of the ions content of the culture medium, this variation interfered with the objective of the present study. In order to analyze the effect of the defined medium composition on mineral content only in biological optimal conditions a second series of tests was carried out at pH controlled in the neutral range (6.8–7.3)."
11,Optimal medium formulation at neutral pH,"3.5 Optimal medium formulation at neutral pH Next experiments were carried out using the same orthogonal layout L9(34) as previously (Table 5 ). The Ca + P content of the culture varied from 21 to 50.5%. A maximum SHPR of 0.84 ± 0.22 mol H2/g VSS·d was observed at third experimental group, which also showed a relatively low Ca + P content (22.5%) and an Y H 2 of 87.5 ± 7% (i.e. not significantly different from the maximal one, 92.7 ± 5.6%). Comparing the observed results in Table 2 and Table 5, both hydrogen production rate and yield were improved (except in 2 cases out of 9 for SHPR) due to the control of pH in the neutral range. The results were analyzed considering the minimization of the Ca + P content of cells as the optimization criterion (Table 5). From variance analysis (not shown), only the F ratios of Ca, 4.2, was larger than the critical value of F0.05(2,18), indicating that only this factor had a significant impact on the mineral content. The magnitude of the variance, expressed in percentage, reflects the significance of the contribution of each factor, hence their ranking, toward this target (Table 6 ). Calcium was definitely the main factor for minimizing the mineral content, explaining 32% of the variance effect on the mineral content, as well as 43% and 28% of the variance effect on H2 yield and SHPR, respectively (not shown). Accordingly, considering that minimum mineral content is the primary target, the optimal defined medium formulation should contain (mM): PO 4 3 − 1 , HCO 3 − 5 , Ca2+ 0.1, Mg2+ 0.5. We presumed that this formulation was also appropriate for satisfactory H2 yield and SHPR levels since the 3rd run performed with the HCO 3 − , Ca2+, Mg2+ levels as in the optimal formulation resulted in highest SHPR and Y H 2 , as above-mentioned, and that the runs performed with 1 mM PO 4 3 − (runs 7, 8 and 9 in Table 5, PO 4 3 − at level 3) as in the optimal formulation, also produced SHPR and Y H 2 values in the upper range."
12,Experimental validation,"3.6 Experimental validation In order to confirm the optimality of the defined medium as formulated in the above work, experiments were repeated under those conditions using different C. hydrogenoformans cultures. Batch fermentation tests were performed with the original DSM pure strain, and results were compared to those obtained with the culture previously enriched on the DSM medium (Fig. 5 ). Generally, no major inconvenient was observed in the conciliation of different optimization objectives. No significant difference was observed for the H2 yield and SHPR parameters with the optimum medium formulation. However, the Ca + P content of the culture drastically decreased from 58.2 to 15.5% after the DSM medium was changed out by the optimized medium. Moreover, mineral content accumulation was further limited to 12.9 ± 4.1% (and to a calcium and phosphorus content 9.51% dr. wt) when original culture was directly grown on the optimized medium. Considering that standard inorganic content of bacterial cells generally varies from 7 to 12% [44], it is clear that the present result are fully satisfactory with respect to the optimization target. At the same time, an acceptable H2 yield of 90.9 ± 1.2% and a reasonable SHPR of 0.85 ± 0.06 mol H2/g VSS·d were also preserved with the optimized medium formulation."
13,Conclusions,"The orthogonal experiment design was employed for process optimization of fermentative hydrogen production using carbon monoxide as substrate. The effect of PO 4 3 − , HCO 3 − , Ca2+, Mg2+ concentrations in culture medium on the calcium and phosphorus content of cells, hydrogen yield and SHPR were investigated in batch test. Experimental results showed that PO 4 3 − , HCO 3 − , Ca2+, Mg2+ factors all had an individual significant influence on H2 yield and activity rate. Considering minimizing the cell mineral content as the primary target, the optimal defined medium formulation should contain (mM): PO 4 3 − 1.0 , HCO 3 − 5.0 , Ca2+ 0.1, Mg2+ 0.5 at a neutral pH. Neither calcium or magnesium at the above low concentration resulted in notable limitations on the H2 yield, or the bioactivity rate of C. hydrogenoformans, except in alkaline conditions for the latter. As well the validation results proved that the orthogonal experimental design was effective in optimizing an important number of factor combinations with a minimal number of experimental runs. As a result of this optimization strategy, the medium formulation was able to keep down the cell mineral content at only 13% dr. wt and the calcium plus phosphorus content at ca. 9% (as compared to ca. 94 and 56%, respectively, with the original medium) while allowing for H2 production yield and rate of ca. 91% (mol/mol) and 0.9 ± 0.1 mol/g VSS·d, respectively. Therefore the optimized medium formulation preserved the culture from mineral accumulation or when cells had a high mineral content at inoculation, allowed for a significant reduction of it. In conclusion the optimization test results can be considered to be reliable for the control of the mineral content in C. hydrogenoformans cultures, without significant interference with their biological activity."
