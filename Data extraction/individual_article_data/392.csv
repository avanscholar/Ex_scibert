0,Introduction,"Selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of great importance because of numerous applications of these alcohols in fine chemical industries, such as the production of chemicals, perfume, fragrances, and pharmaceutical intermediates [1–3]. Among various α, β-unsaturated aldehydes, cinnamaldehyde (CAL) and citral are two vital representatives, and the selective hydrogenation of CAL and citral are good models for investigating catalytic performance. Selective hydrogenation is a complicated reaction network including a few of parallel and successive reductions of different functional groups, i.e., a carbonyl group (CO), and two carbon-carbon double bonds (CC) in a citral molecule. Since the bond energy of carbonyl group is higher than that of CC group, hydrogenation of CC bond thermodynamically occurs more easily [4]. Thus, it is crucial that a high selectivity to CO bond needs to be achieved. During the past decade, a number of bimetallic catalysts have been reported [5–8]. Bimetallic catalysts usually showed a high catalytic activity due to the synergetic effects between two metal elements and a high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols due to electronic and geometric effects, when compared to monometallic catalysts. The synergistic effect is connected to an intimate contact between two metal elements on substrates [9,10], and refers to the electron transfer between these two metal elements, which results in improved activity and selectivity in CO activation. Among them, platinum (Pt)–cobalt (Co) bimetallic catalysts attracted increasing interest, and high unsaturated alcohol yields gained over Pt-Co catalysts in some studies [8,11–13]. Though the interaction between Pt and Co has been widely investigated [8,11,12,14–17], the role of interaction between Pt-Co bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) and substrates on catalytic performance has not been reported. Studies of the synergistic effects of Pt, Co, and substrates on selective hydrogenation reactions are lacking, and the mechanisms as to how they work collectively to improve the activity and selectivity of CO activation are not clear. For these reactions, it is essential that these synergistic effects be systematically investigated in order to further optimize bimetallic catalysts. Our previous report explored the effects of Pt monometallic catalyst support (including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), SiO2, and γ-Al2O3) on hydrogenation of citral [18]. Compared to Pt/SiO2 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Pt/MWCNTs showed a higher selectivity (62%) to that of unsaturated alcohol (UA) [18]. Thus, MWCNTs were chosen as the catalyst support for this work. First, different amounts of Pt and Co were deposited on MWCNTs, via atomic layer deposition (ALD), to obtain various mass ratios of Pt to Co for Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. ALD has been applied in deposition of metal oxide films and metal nanoparticles with precise control of film thickness and uniform particle size [19,20]. The catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts was evaluated for selective hydrogenation of CAL and citral reaction, and, based on the results, the Pt-Co catalysts were optimized. Then, the optimized catalyst was applied in other selective hydrogenation reactions of α, β‐unsaturated aldehydes to verify its universality. Al2O3 ALD was applied for preparation of Pt-Co/Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts to separate Pt-Co and MWCNTs, as schematically shown in Fig. 1 (Path C). Most of Pt-Co NPs were deposited on Al2O3. The synergetic effects between Pt-Co and MWCNTs on the catalytic performance of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts were investigated through a series of CAL hydrogenation reactions. Moreover, in order to study the interaction and synergetic effect between Pt and Co NPs, a mixture of Pt/MWCNTs and Co/MWCNTs monometallic catalysts was used for a CAL hydrogenation reaction, so that the contact between Pt and Co NPs could be avoided. By comparing the CAL hydrogenation reaction results, the role of interaction between Pt and Co NPs was identified. Then, calculations using density functional theory (DFT) confirmed the synergetic effects between Pt-Co and MWCNTs on the Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All catalysts were prepared as schematically presented in Fig. 1. Pt/MWCNTs and Pt-Co/MWCNTs catalysts were obtained via path A, while Co/MWCNTs was prepared through path B. Most of Pt and Pt-Co bimetallic NPs were isolated from MWCNTs via coating five cycles of Al2O3 ALD on MWCNTs (path C), and a mixture of Pt/MWCNTs and Co/MWCNTs catalysts was prepared, as shown in path D. x, y, and z are the numbers of cycles of Pt, Co, and Al2O3 ALD, respectively. The order of x, y, and z represents the order of ALD deposition. The ALD coating process was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor, which has been reported in other literatures [21,22]. The details of Pt ALD, Co ALD, and Al2O3 ALD are described in the Supplementary Information (SI).

3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples were carried out by Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome Instruments Inc.). The surface areas and total pore volumes of catalysts were obtained through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the N2 adsorption amount at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.99, respectively. The size distribution curves of mesopores and micropores were determined from the adsorption-desorption isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method, respectively. The Pt, Co, and Al mass fractions of all catalysts were obtained by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The catalysts were visualized with a FEI Tecnai F20 TEM and a JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) directly. More than 200 metal NPs were measured for each sample to obtain their particle size distribution and average particle size. The reduction properties and Pt dispersion of the MWCNTs-supported catalysts were measured by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CO-chemisorption using Micromeritics Autochem II 2920, respectively. H2-TPR was carried out in a quartz tube and the reduction of the samples was performed in a flow of 10 vol% H2-Ar mixture. The sample temperature increased to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The Pt dispersion of 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts were determined. Typically, the samples were first reduced in a flow of 10 vol% H2-Ar mixture at 350 °C for 30 min and degassed in a flow of He at 350 °C for 90 min. Then the sample temperature decreased to 50 °C and CO adsorption isotherms were obtained with the Pt:CO stoichiometry of 1:1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to verify the bimetallic structure of Pt-Co catalysts. XPS spectra of Pt, Co, and Pt-Co based catalysts were recorded with a Kratos Axis 165 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The survey scan spectra, Pt 4f, and Co 2p core level spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 160 eV, 20 eV, and 20 eV, respectively. All binding energy values were corrected to C 1s signal (284.5 eV)."
4,Hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes,"2.3 Hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes was carried out in a 50 mL stainless steel Parr reactor. In each CAL hydrogenation reaction, 0.5 g CAL and 30 mL 2-propanol were first added into the reactor, and then 25 mg of 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst were added. All catalysts had the same total metal amount (Pt and Co), even though the mass of each catalyst was different due to the different contents of Pt and Co on the MWCNTs (see details in Table S1). All catalysts were used directly without any pretreatment. The reactor was first purged using 10 bar H2 for 10 times to replace the air in the reactor by H2. Then the reactor was pressurized with H2 at 10 bar and the temperature was increased to 80 °C. The gas replacement was done at room temperature, which would not change the state of any Pt, Pt-Co, and Co-based catalysts. The slurry was stirred at a rate of 500 rpm to eliminate the external diffusion limitations based on our previous results [18]. A small volume of the sample (1 mL) was periodically withdrawn and analyzed by using a gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 6890). Toluene was used as an internal standard. After hydrogenation reactions finished, the catalysts were washed with solvent and collected by centrifugation for cycling experiments. The hydrogenation of other unsaturated aldehydes (citral, 2-furfural, and α-amylcinnamaldehyde) was also carried out following the identical procedures but using different reaction temperatures.

5,DFT calculations method,"2.4 DFT calculations method DFT calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [23]. The electron-ion interactions were described by Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials [24]. The PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) was used to approximate the exchange and correlation functional. The electronic wave function was expanded using plane waves with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. A Pt (1 1 1)/Co (1 1 1) interface was created, and then placed on the top of MWCNTs (Fig. 2 ). For the comparative study, two cases were considered. First, the Co structure was removed by leaving the Pt/MWCNT structure. Second, an amorphous Al2O3 layer was inserted between Pt/Co and MWCNT (Fig. S1). These included 174 C atoms, 8 Pt atoms (representing one Pt NP), 8 Co atoms (representing one Co NP), 12 Al atoms, and 18 O atoms depending on the combination. 1 × 1 × 1 of Gamma centered grid was used during the relaxation and 3 × 3 × 3 k point was used during density of state (DOS) calculation.

6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Some physical-chemical properties of the MWCNTs and the prepared Pt, Pt-Co, and Co-based catalysts are showed in Table 1 . After Pt and Co deposition, the BET surface areas and total pore volumes of all catalysts reduced slightly in comparison with those of MWCNTs, but the pore size distribution of all catalysts remained almost the same (Fig. S2). The Co content of yc-Co/xc-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts (based on ICP-AES analysis) increased almost linearly with the increase in the number of Co ALD cycles (Fig. S3), as expected. It was also noted that the increase in total metal loading (Pt and Co) resulted in a reduction in total pore volume for all samples.

After Pt and Co deposition, the BET surface areas and total pore volumes of all catalysts reduced slightly in comparison with those of MWCNTs, but the pore size distribution of all catalysts remained almost the same (Fig. S2). The Co content of yc-Co/xc-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts (based on ICP-AES analysis) increased almost linearly with the increase in the number of Co ALD cycles (Fig. S3), as expected. It was also noted that the increase in total metal loading (Pt and Co) resulted in a reduction in total pore volume for all samples. Pt, Co, and Al loadings in the Al2O3 coated Pt and Pt-Co catalysts are summarized in Table S2. After two cycles of Pt ALD, the Pt loadings in all catalysts were similar (around 5 wt%). It was also noted that, the Co content increased rapidly with the increase in the number of Co ALD cycles after Al2O3 ALD coating, as compared to that of the MWCNTs. Based on previous results, the growth rate of Al2O3 film was 0.10–0.15 nm/cycle via ALD [25]. So the Al2O3 film thickness was around 0.6 nm after 5 cycles of Al2O3 ALD in this study. Although a calculation of a 0.6 nm Al2O3 layer (3.95 g/cm3) on a ∼140 m2/g MWCNTs could lead to 24.9 wt% Al2O3 loading (13.2 wt% Al), the actual Al loading in this study was less than 5 wt%. Thus, only ∼35% of the surface area (4.7%/13.2%) of MWCNTs was covered by Al2O3, and the film was not uniform. This could be due to the fact that Al2O3 only deposited on specific defects instead of forming a uniform film on the MWCNTs via ALD, because there was a lack of hydroxyl groups on the surface of MWCNTs. A similar phenomenon was previously reported [20]. In addition, because of the low Al2O3 ALD reaction temperature (177 °C), the Al2O3 film should be amorphous.

The TEM images of Pt/MWCNTs, Pt-Co/MWCNTs, and Co/MWCNTs catalysts, along with their size distributions are shown in Fig. S4. The NPs were highly dispersed on the MWCNTs in all catalysts. The average particle sizes of the Pt NPs and Co NPs were 1.2 nm and 1.3 nm, respectively (Table 1). Compared with Pt and Co NPs, the sizes of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs increased (1.5–1.7 nm) and their size distribution was broader (Fig. S4). The elemental composition of catalyst 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs was analyzed via STEM/EDS (Figs. S5–S6) and the results indicated that the molar ratio of Pt to Co was around 1:1 for most of the NPs on the MWCNTs (Table S3). This indicates that most particles on the MWCNTs were Pt-Co bimetallic particles, instead of Pt or Co monometallic NPs, even though the Pt to Co ratio was not identical. To further confirm the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs, HRTEM was performed. Some “twinned” NPs were observed in Fig. 3 (red circle). The crystal fringes are clearly observed (inset in Fig. 3) and the d-spacing was measured to be 0.228 nm and 0.205 nm, assigning to the (1 1 1) planes of the face-centered cubic Pt crystals and the (1 1 1) planes of Co crystals, respectively [26,27]. Thus, the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs was verified. They were neither alloy nor core-shell structures.

Thus, the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs was verified. They were neither alloy nor core-shell structures. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. S7, the average particle sizes of Pt and Pt-Co NPs on Al2O3-coated MWCNTs were close to those of Pt and Pt-Co on MWCNTs, respectively. No Al2O3 films were observed in the TEM images, although EDS spectra verified the existence of Al on MWCNTs (Fig. S8), which could have been due to the ultrathin Al2O3 films (<1 nm thick). The BET surface areas of all Al2O3-coated catalysts were around 95 m2/g, which was lower than those of catalysts without Al2O3 ALD coating. This was due to the fact that some pores, especially micropores, were blocked by Al2O3. Based on TEM images, the metal particle sizes did not increase on the Al2O3-coated MWCNTs. In addition, the Pt dispersion of 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs (79.3%) was similar to that of 2c-Pt/MWCNTs (81.4%), which was consistent with TEM analysis. Thus, the change in surface area would not have affected the catalytic performance of catalysts very much.

Thus, the change in surface area would not have affected the catalytic performance of catalysts very much. H2-TPR profiles of the MWCNTs-supported Pt, Pt-Co, and Co catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . A broad and weak peak located between 300 and 600 °C was observed for both 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts, which indicated that few Pt NPs were oxidized, and most of Pt NPs were metallic and did not oxidize in air after the ALD process. This was consistent with a previous report [28]. While the 15c-Co/MWCNTs catalyst presented a large peak of H2 consumption, appearing at 422 °C (Table 2 ), which indicated that Co NPs were partly oxidized in air after Co ALD. The TPR profile of 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs showed a two-stage reduction at 290 °C and 405 °C, which were assigned to the reduction of CoOx that were in contact with Pt and the isolated CoOx, respectively. Silva et al. pointed out that Pt could boost the reduction of Co notably [29]. Influenced by hydrogen spillover, the reduction of CoOx shifted to lower temperatures, since the metallic Pt atoms were able to dissociate hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms, resulting in the improved reduction rate of CoOx [30,31]. This TPR analysis further confirmed the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs, which was consistent with the results of TEM and STEM/EDS analysis. For the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, a two-stage reduction was also presented at 388 °C and 480 °C. Compared with that of 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, the reduction temperature of 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs increased, which indicated that there was a stronger chemical bonding (i.e., interaction) between Co and Al2O3 than that between Co and MWCNTs. In addition, for the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, the amount of H2 consumption was smaller than that for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst (Table 2), although 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs had a higher loading of Co (Table S2). The molar ratios of consumed H2 to Co were 0.10, 0.08 and 0.03 for the 15c-Co/MWCNTs, 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts, respectively. Assuming that only Co0 and CoIIO existed in the catalysts, ∼10% Co was oxidized to Co2+ in the air for the catalysts without Al2O3 coating; in contrast, only ∼3% Co2+ existed in the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, which could be due to the fact that the CoIIO in the catalyst was not reduced totally in the H2-TPR process and this implied that 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs was more difficult to be reduced. In addition, based on the TPR results, some “twinned” Pt-CoOx pairs existed in Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. H2-TPR profiles of the MWCNTs-supported Pt, Pt-Co, and Co catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . A broad and weak peak located between 300 and 600 °C was observed for both 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts, which indicated that few Pt NPs were oxidized, and most of Pt NPs were metallic and did not oxidize in air after the ALD process. This was consistent with a previous report [28].

Silva et al. pointed out that Pt could boost the reduction of Co notably [29]. Influenced by hydrogen spillover, the reduction of CoOx shifted to lower temperatures, since the metallic Pt atoms were able to dissociate hydrogen molecules into hydrogen atoms, resulting in the improved reduction rate of CoOx [30,31]. This TPR analysis further confirmed the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs, which was consistent with the results of TEM and STEM/EDS analysis. For the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, a two-stage reduction was also presented at 388 °C and 480 °C. Compared with that of 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, the reduction temperature of 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs increased, which indicated that there was a stronger chemical bonding (i.e., interaction) between Co and Al2O3 than that between Co and MWCNTs. In addition, for the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, the amount of H2 consumption was smaller than that for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst (Table 2), although 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs had a higher loading of Co (Table S2). The molar ratios of consumed H2 to Co were 0.10, 0.08 and 0.03 for the 15c-Co/MWCNTs, 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts, respectively. Assuming that only Co0 and CoIIO existed in the catalysts, ∼10% Co was oxidized to Co2+ in the air for the catalysts without Al2O3 coating; in contrast, only ∼3% Co2+ existed in the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, which could be due to the fact that the CoIIO in the catalyst was not reduced totally in the H2-TPR process and this implied that 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs was more difficult to be reduced. In addition, based on the TPR results, some “twinned” Pt-CoOx pairs existed in Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. XPS spectra of MWCNTs-supported Pt, Co, and Pt-Co catalysts were presented in Figs. 5, S9, and S10. Fig. 5 showed that the Pt 4f spectra of the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts were fitted by two doublets attributed to the higher Pt 4f energy value of PtIIO and the lower energy value of metallic Pt0. It implies that some Pt NPs were oxidized in the air after Pt ALD process, which was consistent with TPR results. The positions of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 were 71.2 eV (Pt0), 73.3 eV (PtIIO), and 74.5 eV (Pt0), 76.4 eV (PtIIO) for 2c-Pt/MWCNTs, respectively. In contrast, for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, the positions of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 shifted to 71.5 eV (Pt0) and 74.7 eV (Pt0), respectively. It has been reported that the binding energy is closely associated with the adsorption/desorption capability of reactants on the surface of catalyst, and such a tendency implies that the d-band center of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs downshifts in comparison with that of Pt, indicating an electronic transfer from Co to Pt [32]. XPS spectra of MWCNTs-supported Pt, Co, and Pt-Co catalysts were presented in Fig. 5, S9, and S10. Fig. 5 showed that the Pt 4f spectra of the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts were fitted by two doublets attributed to the higher Pt 4f energy value of PtIIO and the lower energy value of metallic Pt0. It implies that some Pt NPs were oxidized in the air after Pt ALD process, which was consistent with TPR results. The positions of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 were 71.2 eV (Pt0), 73.3 eV (PtIIO), and 74.5 eV (Pt0), 76.4 eV (PtIIO) for 2c-Pt/MWCNTs, respectively. In contrast, for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, the positions of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 shifted to 71.5 eV (Pt0) and 74.7 eV (Pt0), respectively. It has been reported that the binding energy is closely associated with the adsorption/desorption capability of reactants on the surface of catalyst, and such a tendency implies that the d-band center of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs downshifts in comparison with that of Pt, indicating an electronic transfer from Co to Pt [32]. As shown in Fig. S10a, the Pt 4f binding energy of the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst positively shifted slightly as well, as compared to that of the 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, indicating the Pt-Co bimetallic structure. Besides, compared to the catalysts without Al2O3 coating, the intensity of Pt 4f peaks for the catalysts with Al2O3 coating were stronger, which was due to the overlap of Al 2p and Pt 4f peaks. Fig. S10b showed the high resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p for the catalysts. The positions of Co 2p3/2 peaks were 779.5 eV, 779.7 eV, and 780.4 eV for 15c-Co/MWCNTs, 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs, respectively. It indicates that both Co and CoOx existed in catalysts, since the standard Co 2p3/2 and CoO 2p3/2 binding energy are 778.2 eV and 780.0 eV, respectively [33,34]. As shown in Fig. S10a, the Pt 4f binding energy of the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst positively shifted slightly as well, as compared to that of the 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, indicating the Pt-Co bimetallic structure.

It indicates that both Co and CoOx existed in catalysts, since the standard Co 2p3/2 and CoO 2p3/2 binding energy are 778.2 eV and 780.0 eV, respectively [33,34]."
8,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance Hydrogenation of CAL is a representative reaction of selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes. The general pathways for the reaction network are shown in Fig. S11. Table 3 displays the results of CAL hydrogenation catalyzed by Pt/MWCNTs, Pt-Co/MWCNTs, and Co/MWCNTs. Among all monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst showed the highest conversion and selectivity to cinnamic alcohol (COL). In addition, the 15c-Co/MWCNTs sample showed the lowest activity of all catalysts, even though it had a higher selectivity to COL than the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst did. This indicated that the activity improvement of Co/Pt/MWCNTs bimetallic catalysts could have been due to the synergistic effect (e.g., electronic effect) of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs, rather than the presence of Co NPs, since the Co monometallic catalyst showed low activity. Thus, the low activity of the 30c-Co/1c-Pt/MWCNTs sample was consistent with the low Pt loading; most NPs formed on the MWCNTs were Co NPs. In addition, a decrease in reaction rate was observed during the reaction (Fig. S12), which was due to the fact that the experiment was performed in a batch reactor. Hydrogenation of CAL is a representative reaction of selective hydrogenation of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes. The general pathways for the reaction network are shown in Fig. S11. Table 3 displays the results of CAL hydrogenation catalyzed by Pt/MWCNTs, Pt-Co/MWCNTs, and Co/MWCNTs.

Thus, the low activity of the 30c-Co/1c-Pt/MWCNTs sample was consistent with the low Pt loading; most NPs formed on the MWCNTs were Co NPs. In addition, a decrease in reaction rate was observed during the reaction (Fig. S12), which was due to the fact that the experiment was performed in a batch reactor. As shown in Table 3, COL was the main product in the reaction of either Pt or Co catalysts; this is consistent with previous reports [35,36]. Based on theoretical calculations by Delbecq and Sautet [37], the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol is associated with the metal d-band width. Generally, flat surfaces, such as Pt(1 1 1) and Co(1 1 1), adsorb the unsaturated aldehyde in a terminal di-σco mode [37]. Therefore, Pt and Co can provide good selectivity to unsaturated alcohol, since they have a relatively large radial expansion of the d orbitals [38]. In contrast, low coordination sites, i.e., defects, prefer to π interactions with CC, which lead to formation of unselective products [8]. The selectivities to the main products (COL, hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), and 3-phenyl-1-propanol (HCOL)) along with reaction time are presented in Fig. S13. For the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts, both COL and HCOL selectivities increased with increasing reaction time. On the contrary, the selectivity to HCAL began to decrease after several hours of reaction. This phenomenon could be due to the fact that CAL molecule was adsorbed on the surface of Pt NPs through both CC and CO groups at the initial reaction state; then the adsorption process occurred through CO groups, mainly after the concentration of HCAL achieved a certain value. With further increases of Co loading in the catalysts, the selectivity to COL reached a plateau and almost remained constant, along with the reaction time, over the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst (Fig. S13c). When the ratio of Pt to Co was small and more monometallic Co NPs existed on the MWCNTs, both the conversion of CAL and the selectivity to COL decreased, especially for the conversion. As shown in Table 3, COL was the main product in the reaction of either Pt or Co catalysts; this is consistent with previous reports [35,36].

For the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalysts, both COL and HCOL selectivities increased with increasing reaction time. On the contrary, the selectivity to HCAL began to decrease after several hours of reaction. This phenomenon could be due to the fact that CAL molecule was adsorbed on the surface of Pt NPs through both CC and CO groups at the initial reaction state; then the adsorption process occurred through CO groups, mainly after the concentration of HCAL achieved a certain value. With further increases of Co loading in the catalysts, the selectivity to COL reached a plateau and almost remained constant, along with the reaction time, over the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst (Fig. S13c). When the ratio of Pt to Co was small and more monometallic Co NPs existed on the MWCNTs, both the conversion of CAL and the selectivity to COL decreased, especially for the conversion. The increase of selectivity to COL could have been due to the fact that the deposition of Co on Pt NPs changed the electronic structure of Pt atoms, and destabilized the adsorption of the CC bond [8]. Thereby, the selectivity for CO activation improved greatly. Fig. 6 a shows the electronic transfer mode for Co/Pt/MWCNTs catalysts. The contact between Pt and Co favored the charge transfer between Co0 and Pt0 [12], which led to a negative charge density of Pt atoms and a positive charge density of Co atoms. The enhanced charge density of the bimetallic NPs could promote the Cδ+-Oδ- to adsorb over a Pt δ--Co δ+ site and hinder the adsorption via the CC bond, so the selectivity to COL was higher over Pt-Co catalysts. Generally, ionic hydrogen species (H+ and H-) prefers CO hydrogenation and dissociated hydrogen species prefers CC hydrogenation. In this study, H2 (gas) was the hydrogen donor molecule and atomic hydrogen came from the dissociation of dissolved molecular hydrogen. Generally, Pt dissociates molecular hydrogen easily and has a much larger concentration of hydrogen atoms on the surface [39]. Thus, it should prefer CC hydrogenation. However, since the charge density enhanced for Pt-Co NPs, the bimetallic catalysts would adsorb CO bond easily and thereby the selectivity to CO bond improved. The charge can be transferred from Co to Pt directly or through MWCNTs. The excellent electrical conductivity of MWCNTs enhanced the electronic transfer and thereby improved the charge density of the bimetallic NPs, which improved the adsorption and desorption rates of CO for Pt δ--Co δ+ sites. Thus, the activity of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts and the conversion of CAL were higher when compared to Pt or Co monometallic catalysts. The proposed hypothesis will be verified and discussed later. Similar phenomena was reported by Bertero et al. for the hydrogenation of citral over Pt-Co/C catalyst [12]. Compared to selective hydrogenation of CAL, the reaction network of citral hydrogenation is more complicated (Fig. S14), since citral contains one more CC group. As shown in Table 4 , 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs still showed the highest selectivity to UA (90.5%) with a conversion of 94.5%. In addition, the trends of citral conversions, along with reaction times for all catalysts (Fig. S15), were similar to that of a CAL conversion. It is also noted that the main byproducts were citronellal and citronellol, and the catalysts produced almost no 3,6-dimethyl-2-octen-1-ol for this reaction (Fig. S16). This implies that the isolated CC was more stable than the CC conjugated to the carbonyl in the reaction. In addition to citral, a 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst was applied to selective hydrogenation of 2-furfural and α-amylcinnamaldehyde as well. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 7 . The selectivity to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols was more than 90% for both reactions. Though high unsaturated alcohols yields (>80%) have been achieved for Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts in some studies, only one model reaction was used in these reports [8,12,13]. In this study, through these four selective hydrogenation reactions, our 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst was proved to be a universally suitable catalyst with high activity and high selectivity in CO activation for different hydrogenation reactions of α, β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols, rather than for a specific one. In addition, CoOx and some other metal oxides could enhance the activation of CO bonds, which has been reported previously [40–43]. Thus, in this study, CoOx could effectively promote the cleavage of CO bond during hydrogenation reaction, and it could accelerate the hydrogenation process and partly improve the selectivity in CO activation. Compared to selective hydrogenation of CAL, the reaction network of citral hydrogenation is more complicated (Fig. S14), since citral contains one more CC group. As shown in Table 4 , 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs still showed the highest selectivity to UA (90.5%) with a conversion of 94.5%.

In addition, CoOx and some other metal oxides could enhance the activation of CO bonds, which has been reported previously [40–43]. Thus, in this study, CoOx could effectively promote the cleavage of CO bond during hydrogenation reaction, and it could accelerate the hydrogenation process and partly improve the selectivity in CO activation. In order to verify the proposed synergistic effect among Pt, Co, and MWCNTs, an ultra-thin Al2O3 film was used to tune the interfaces of the catalysts (Path C, Fig. 1). The Al2O3 coated catalysts were applied for the CAL hydrogenation reactions; results are showed in Table 5 and Figs. S17–S18. Compared to that for the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, the selectivity to COL for the 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst decreased to 57.1%, which was consistent with our previous results [18]. After depositing Co on 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs, both 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs presented a much lower activity than the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst did. The CAL conversion reached 93.3% for 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and this was much higher than those for 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs, although all three catalysts have similar selectivity in CO activation. As schematically demonstrated in Fig. 6b, due to the existence of Al2O3 film, the electronic transfer can only occur from Co to Pt directly, instead of through MWCNTs, in the 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts. The increased charge density on the bimetallic Pt-Co NPs would promote selectivity to COL. Thus, the interaction between Pt and Co NPs played a vital role in the selectivity to CO. In other words, the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs was the dominating factor in the high selectivity to COL in the hydrogenation of the CAL reaction, no matter what support materials were used. In order to verify the proposed synergistic effect among Pt, Co, and MWCNTs, an ultra-thin Al2O3 film was used to tune the interfaces of the catalysts (Path C, Fig. 1). The Al2O3 coated catalysts were applied for the CAL hydrogenation reactions; results are showed in Table 5 and Figs. S17–S18. Compared to that for the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, the selectivity to COL for the 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst decreased to 57.1%, which was consistent with our previous results [18]. After depositing Co on 2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs, both 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs presented a much lower activity than the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst did. The CAL conversion reached 93.3% for 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and this was much higher than those for 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs, although all three catalysts have similar selectivity in CO activation. As schematically demonstrated in Fig. 6b, due to the existence of Al2O3 film, the electronic transfer can only occur from Co to Pt directly, instead of through MWCNTs, in the 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts. The increased charge density on the bimetallic Pt-Co NPs would promote selectivity to COL. Thus, the interaction between Pt and Co NPs played a vital role in the selectivity to CO. In other words, the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic NPs was the dominating factor in the high selectivity to COL in the hydrogenation of the CAL reaction, no matter what support materials were used. However, the synergistic effect among Pt, Co, and MWCNTs greatly affected the activity of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. After an ultra-thin layer of Al2O3 film was used to isolate Pt-Co bimetallic NPs from MWCNTs (Fig. 6b), the conversion of CAL decreased significantly for the 3c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalysts. This indicated that the interaction between Pt-Co bimetallic NPs and MWCNTs had a great influence on the activity of bimetallic catalysts. It helps explain that MWCNTs worked as a “bridge”, connected Pt with Co, and helped electronic transfer between Pt and Co, which improved the charge density of bimetallic NPs, and promoted the adsorption and dissociation rate of CO over Pt δ--Co δ+ sites for CAL hydrogenation reaction. In addition, the surface area of Al2O3-coated catalysts decreased from ∼140 to ∼95 m2/g, and Co was more preferentially deposited on Al2O3 by ALD based on ICP-AES results, and thus had less contact with Pt. Both these two factors also resulted in a low activity of Al2O3-coated Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. To further verify the interaction between Pt and Co NPs, a mixture of Pt and Co NPs was applied in CAL hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Table 5 and Fig. S18e, the CAL conversion and selectivity to COL were 43.4% and 53.1% over a mixture of the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 15c-Co/MWCNTs catalysts, respectively. Both of them were much lower than those for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, although the Pt and Co masses of the mixed catalysts for the reaction were the same as the Pt and Co masses of the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, respectively. As schematically shown in Fig. 6c, there was no electronic transfer between Pt/MWCNTs and Co/MWCNTs monometallic catalysts, and thereby the catalytic performance of the mixed catalysts did not improve, as compared to the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs monometallic catalyst (Table 3). Thus, this proved that the interaction between Pt and Co NPs had worked as a vital role in the activity of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts and the selectivity in CO activation. It was also noted that in all of these hydrogenation reactions, no hydrogen transfers or etherification reactions were observed in the hydrogenation reactions based on GC-FID results; this was consistent with our previous study and others [18,44–46]. To further verify the interaction between Pt and Co NPs, a mixture of Pt and Co NPs was applied in CAL hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Table 5 and Fig. S18e, the CAL conversion and selectivity to COL were 43.4% and 53.1% over a mixture of the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs and 15c-Co/MWCNTs catalysts, respectively. Both of them were much lower than those for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, although the Pt and Co masses of the mixed catalysts for the reaction were the same as the Pt and Co masses of the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, respectively. As schematically shown in Fig. 6c, there was no electronic transfer between Pt/MWCNTs and Co/MWCNTs monometallic catalysts, and thereby the catalytic performance of the mixed catalysts did not improve, as compared to the 2c-Pt/MWCNTs monometallic catalyst (Table 3). Thus, this proved that the interaction between Pt and Co NPs had worked as a vital role in the activity of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts and the selectivity in CO activation. It was also noted that in all of these hydrogenation reactions, no hydrogen transfers or etherification reactions were observed in the hydrogenation reactions based on GC-FID results; this was consistent with our previous study and others [18,44–46]. In order to prove the role of MWCNTs as a “bridge” for electron transfer between Pt and Co, DFT calculations were performed for studying DOS of d-band of Pt atoms in Pt and Pt-Co catalysts with and without Al2O3 coating. In previous studies, d-band downshift (reduction in the d-band center of Pt) proved to be an evidence of higher oxygen-reduction activity [47–49]. The downshifts of the d-band center of Pt-Co alloy was also observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in which the d-band vacancy was significantly increased [48,50]. In this work, we examined the tendency of d-band shift depending on the relative position to MWCNT and Co to examine the impact of MWCNT and Co. Fig. 8 shows d-orbital DOS of Pt atoms. The plots can be categorized into two distinct features: Pt atoms (Pt2, Pt4, Pt5, and Pt7) close to the MWCNT and Pt atoms (Pt1, Pt3, Pt6, and Pt8) far from the MWCNT. As shown, d-band centers of Pt atoms that were close to the MWCNT were shifted to a lower energy level, which is consistent with previous observations. Next, the impact of Al2O3 coating on the layer of MWCNTs was examined. When an Al2O3 layer was inserted (Fig. S1), the d-band center of Pt atoms with Co incorporation was similar to that of Pt atoms without Co incorporation no matter where Pt atoms were, which indicated that the Al2O3 film was not helpful for electronic transfer between Pt atoms and Co atoms (Fig. S19). Compared to that of Pt atoms in Pt (1 1 1)/Co (1 1 1)/MWCNTs, the d-band center of Pt atoms (Pt2, Pt4, Pt5, and Pt7) in Pt (1 1 1)/Co (1 1 1)/Al2O3/MWCNTs shifted up, which implied a reduction of vacancy, and corresponding a low catalytic activity (Fig. S20). This was consistent with our experimental results. Therefore, electron transfer between Pt atoms and Co atoms effectively modified the electron structure of Pt, when MWCNTs worked as a “bridge”, and the catalytic activity improved significantly. In order to prove the role of MWCNTs as a “bridge” for electron transfer between Pt and Co, DFT calculations were performed for studying DOS of d-band of Pt atoms in Pt and Pt-Co catalysts with and without Al2O3 coating. In previous studies, d-band downshift (reduction in the d-band center of Pt) proved to be an evidence of higher oxygen-reduction activity [47–49]. The downshifts of the d-band center of Pt-Co alloy was also observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in which the d-band vacancy was significantly increased [48,50]. In this work, we examined the tendency of d-band shift depending on the relative position to MWCNT and Co to examine the impact of MWCNT and Co. Fig. 8 shows d-orbital DOS of Pt atoms. The plots can be categorized into two distinct features: Pt atoms (Pt2, Pt4, Pt5, and Pt7) close to the MWCNT and Pt atoms (Pt1, Pt3, Pt6, and Pt8) far from the MWCNT. As shown, d-band centers of Pt atoms that were close to the MWCNT were shifted to a lower energy level, which is consistent with previous observations. Next, the impact of Al2O3 coating on the layer of MWCNTs was examined. When an Al2O3 layer was inserted (Fig. S1), the d-band center of Pt atoms with Co incorporation was similar to that of Pt atoms without Co incorporation no matter where Pt atoms were, which indicated that the Al2O3 film was not helpful for electronic transfer between Pt atoms and Co atoms (Fig. S19). Compared to that of Pt atoms in Pt (1 1 1)/Co (1 1 1)/MWCNTs, the d-band center of Pt atoms (Pt2, Pt4, Pt5, and Pt7) in Pt (1 1 1)/Co (1 1 1)/Al2O3/MWCNTs shifted up, which implied a reduction of vacancy, and corresponding a low catalytic activity (Fig. S20). This was consistent with our experimental results. Therefore, electron transfer between Pt atoms and Co atoms effectively modified the electron structure of Pt, when MWCNTs worked as a “bridge”, and the catalytic activity improved significantly. Although Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts have been proved to be suitable catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions of α, β‐unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohol [38], no previous studies have reported the effect of support on hydrogenation reaction for Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts. In this study, we are the first to reveal the mechanism as to how the support worked collectively with Pt-Co NPs to improve activity and selectivity through controlling experiments and DFT calculations. In addition, the limited defect sites and nearly perfect structure of MWCNTs are the key factors that ensure the formation probability of Pt-Co bimetallic nanoparticles during ALD process. Stability, another crucial property of catalysts for practical applications, is particularly vital for noble metal catalysts. The results of the successive experiments of CAL hydrogenation catalyzed by 2c-Pt/MWCNTs, 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs, and 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs are shown in Fig. S21. Three cycling tests were applied for the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst, and a noticeable decrease in the conversion of CAL and selectivity in COL activation was observed when the number of reaction cycles increased (Fig. S21b). In contrast, the conversion and selectivity for 2c-Pt/MWCNTs remained almost the same after three cycling tests (Fig. S21a); this was consistent with our previous results [18,51]. Thus, this study indicated that some Co NPs were leached out during the cycling reactions, which led to the decreases in activity and selectivity of the catalyst. It indicated that the interaction between Co NPs and MWCNTs was not strong enough. A total of five cycling tests were also applied for the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst, with almost no difference in catalytic activity and selectivity, as shown in Fig. S21c. These results implied that the 5c-Co/2c-Pt/5c-Al2O3/MWCNTs catalyst showed a higher stability than the 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst did, and that the interaction between Co and Al2O3 was stronger than that between Co and MWCNTs; this was consistent with the TPR and XPS results. Improvement in the cycling stability of the Pt-Co/MWCNTs catalyst is being addressed by this group.

9,Conclusions,"Highly dispersed Pt-Co bimetallic NPs were deposited on MWCNTs for selective hydrogenation of α, β‐unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. Both HRTEM and STEM/EDS analysis proved the structure of Pt-Co bimetallic particles on MWCNTs. The 10c-Co/2c-Pt/MWCNTs catalyst showed high selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (>90%), with high conversion in various selective hydrogenation reactions due to the synergistic effect between Pt, Co, and MWCNTs. The universality of this catalyst was proved. A series of experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the interaction between Pt and Co NPs improved the selectivity in CO activation of the selective hydrogenation reactions, and the synergistic effect between Pt-Co bimetallic NPs and MWCNTs dramatically enhanced the activity of the catalysts. This research produced the essential foundation knowledge needed to solve the “activity-selectivity” dilemma."
