0,Introduction,"Due to its abundance and renewable character, combined with excellent mechanical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility, cellulose gained in the last decade a high interest, being placed as a key component in preparation of wide range of materials, including hydrogels. Hydrogels are generally defined as polymeric structures which are able to retain large amounts of solvent, without their dissolution [1]. Cellulose-based hydrogels are prepared by using mainly three different strategies: the first one include the cellulose as the sole component, when appropriate complex solvent systems are required, the second one, use the cellulose derivatives, ethers in principal, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, which present good solubility in many solvents, including water, and the third strategy, combine native cellulose with other polymers, either natural or synthetic, through physical or chemical processes (polyelectrolyte complexes or interpenetrating polymer networks, IPNs formation). Poly(vinyl alcohol) is a biodegradable polymer, largely used in the last years for the production of biodegradable hybrid materials, as a substitute of traditional polyethylene or polypropylene polymers [2,3]. These materials have proved beneficial applications in water filtration [4], paper industry [5], mats and films production [6,7] and packaging [8]. However, PVA itself suffer of quite poor mechanical strength, requiring other components able to improve this property. Usually, the reinforcing agents are of inorganic nature, such as silica and silicates [9], carbon nanotubes [10–12] and nanoclay [13–15]. The discovery, followed by the fast development and implementation of new technologies able to produce cellulose at its nanoscale size, so called nanocellulose, lead yet to a quick switch to the cellulose-based fillers for PVA composites [16], due to their undoubtedly advantages: high surface area and stiffness, greener character, low-energy consumption for manufacturing, renewability and biocompatibility [17]. The use of cross-linking agents, as for example glutaraldehyde [18], borax [19] and epichlorhydrin [20] is a key factor which contributes to the fabrication of cellulose-PVA hydrogels with improved Young's modulus and tensile strength, due to the chemical interactions between the two components. Despite of the multitude of reported methods for PVA-cellulose hydrogels fabrications, there are still plenty of obstacles and drawbacks limiting drastically the use of native cellulose for hydrogels production. These limiting factors refer to the use of sophisticated cellulose solvent systems, the presence of cross-linking chemical agents, harsh reagents and reaction conditions, high energy consumption, and so on. In this paper, we propose the use of various amounts of water soluble tricarboxy cellulose, ranging from 0.1% to 25% (wt.) acting as a multifunctional key component: due to its particular structure, bearing three COOH groups per anhydroglucose unit, fulfills the role of a cross-linker agent, but at the same time increasing strengthening and stiffness properties for the preparation of PVA hydrogels. The as resulted hydrogels were fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the self-healing properties of the prepared hydrogels were highlighted by the rheological measurements."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Commercial poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with average molecular weight of 8.9 × 104–9.8 × 104, 99% hydrolyzed, purified cellulose (microcrystalline, Avicel® PH 101), with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 135, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO), sodium periodate, sodium bromide, 9% (wt.) sodium hypochlorite and other chemicals and solvents were of pure grade (Sigma Aldrich), and used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of tricarboxy cellulose (OxC),"2.2 Synthesis of tricarboxy cellulose (OxC) Cellulose (10 g) was introduced in a 3 L flask (protected with aluminum foil to prevent the decomposition of periodate) containing 1200 mL distilled water. A mixture of TEMPO (0.8 g, 5 mmol), sodium periodate (5.4 g, 25 mmol) and NaBr (8 g, 80 mmol) was then added drop wise under vigorous stirring. The 9% NaClO solution (5.94 g, 80 mmol) was subsequently added to the cellulose slurry under continuous stirring, which represent the start of the oxidation reaction. The suspension was then kept under stirring for 6 h. The reaction is carried out with a careful check of the pH, which is strictly maintained at about 10.5 by using 2 M NaOH solution. After 6 h, the reaction was quenched by adding 5 mL of glycerol and the resulted oxidized cellulose is filtered and washed several times with deionized water and 0.5 M HCl solution. The water-soluble collected fraction was precipitated with excess of ethanol (1:10 vol.) and the formed precipitate was separated by centrifugation. After centrifugation, the solid content was re-dissolved in water, the resulted solution being desalted, and oligomers are removed by diafiltration using a Millipore ultrafiltration membrane from polyethersulfone (cut-off: 12,000 g cm−1). The diafiltration was stopped when the filtrate conductivity was lower than 10 μS m−1, the oxidized product (tricarboxy cellulose) was recovered by freeze-drying."
4,Determination of the carboxyl groups content in tricarboxy cellulose (OxC),"2.3 Determination of the carboxyl groups content in tricarboxy cellulose (OxC) The amount of the carboxylic groups introduced after oxidation was determined by using potentiometric titration and is detailed in our previous report [21]. All experiments were performed in triplicate, at 25 °C, under inert atmosphere (argon)."
5,Preparation of tricarboxy cellulose-PVA composite hydrogels,"2.4 Preparation of tricarboxy cellulose-PVA composite hydrogels Tricarboxy cellulose (OxC) has been dissolved in water and stirred for 2 h. PVA aqueous solutions were obtained at 80 °C under magnetic stirring for 2 h. Homogeneous PVA/OxC solutions were obtained by mixing the parental solutions in the following ratios: 99.9/0.1, 99.5/0.5, 99/1, 95/5, 90/10; 85/15; 80/20, and 75/25 (w/w), samples being labeled as POxC0.1, POxC0.5, POxC1, POxC5, POxC10, POxC15, POxC20, and POxC25 respectively. All POxC mixture composites and pure PVA aqueous solution were subjected to 3 freezing thawing cycles in order to obtain physical networks. After each freezing cycle, the samples were kept at 4 °C for a slow thawing which ensure the formation of a porous structure [22]. The resulted hydrogels were investigated by rheological measurements. Other hydrogel samples similarly obtained were dried by lyophilization and investigated by different methods."
6,Characterization techniques,"2.5 Characterization techniques The FTIR spectra were recorded in the attenuated total reflection configuration (ATR) on a Golden Gate accessory (diamond crystal, Specac Ltd.) using a Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The spectra were collected as 128 co-added scans at a 2 cm−1 resolution, in the mid IR range (4000–600 cm−1). Data processing and manipulation were performed with the OPUS 6.5 software. The peaks of interest were spectrally resolved by a curve-fitting procedure, by using the Voigt function. The exact position and the estimated number of the sub-bands were determined with the help of the second derivative spectrum, using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm with a thirteen-point smoothing factor. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained by Bruker-Avance DRX 400 MHz Spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm QNP direct detection probe and z-gradients, from solutions in D2O, using tetramethylsilane TMS (δ = 0.0 ppm) as the internal standard. The morphology of the composite hydrogels was checked using environmental scanning microscopy (ESEM). The ESEM microphotographs were acquired on samples fixed by means of colloidal silver on copper supports. The samples were previously coated by a thin layer of gold. Each coated surface was then examined using an Environmental Scanning 200 instrument, operating at 5 kV with secondary electrons in High Vacuum Mode. For accurate pore size measurements, the hydrogels were previously freeze-dried in a freeze-dryer Cryotec Cosmos 80 device, for 48 h. The cross-sections were prepared by cutting the dry hydrogels with a sharp razor blade, in order to expose the internal structures. The mean diameter of the pores has been determined from SEM images using Image J Software. Crystallinity determination of the cellulose, tricarboxy cellulose, PVA and hydrogel samples has been performed using a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer. All analyses were performed in the 2θ range between 4° to 40°, with a 0.02° s−1 data acquisition, employing the reflection method. The other parameters, including: current and voltage were settled at 25 mA and 36 kV respectively. Pure compounds and obtained mixtures were also tested by applying the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. Thus, a Mettler Toledo DSC1 equipment was used. The DSC curves were recorded in inert atmosphere, with a heating speed of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow of 150 mL min−1. The temperature range of 25–200 °C was scanned, during two stages of heating and one of cooling. The mass of samples encapsulated in aluminum pans having pierced lids to allow the evaporation of the volatile components, was comprised between 3.1 and 4.3 mg. The temperature of glassy transition (Tg) was taken as the inflection point of the specific heat increment on the curve obtained during the second heating cycle."
7,Rheological measurements,"2.6 Rheological measurements The rheological measurements were carried out with a MCR 302 Anton-Paar rheometer equipped with Peltier device for rigorous temperature control and plane-plane geometry (the upper plate having the diameter of 50 mm) with a gap of 500 μm. In order to avoid the water evaporation, an anti-evaporation device was used, creating a saturated atmosphere near the sample. The viscoelastic parameters of the hydrogels were followed at 25 °C by small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments with oscillation frequency ranging from 0.1 rad s−1 up to 100 rad s−1, and strain amplitude (γ) at which linear viscoelasticity is attained (in our study γ = 1% was selected). The storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli, were measured as a function of the oscillation frequency (ω). G′ is correlated with the elasticity or the energy stored in the material during deformation, and G″ gives information about the viscous character or the dissipated energy into the environment."
8,Results and discussions,
9,Preparation and characterization of water soluble tricarboxy cellulose,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of water soluble tricarboxy cellulose The main obstacle for cellulose utilization as homogeneous constituent of bi- or multicomponent mixtures in various applications, reside in its extraordinary recalcitrance towards the common solvents, thus drastically limiting the potential utilization of this valuable renewable resource. Therefore, cellulose-based derivatives with increased solubility are required as alternatives to pure cellulose. Oxidation reaction is one the preferred methods when a convenient and straightforward protocol to functionalize the anhydroglucose unit in cellulose is desired due to its selectivity and simplicity [23–30]. However, attaining the water solubility of the oxidized products is a cumbersome process. In this connection we have combined two of the most selective processes for the OH groups' oxidation, in one step, Fig. 1 [21]. In the proposed protocol, the primary OH group in the cellulose structural unit is converted into carboxylic moiety, via aldehyde stage, due to the TEMPO, sodium hypochlorite and sodium bromide oxidation, whereas, the other two secondary OH groups are initially transformed into aldehydes, but due to the inclusion of sodium periodate as a supplementary reagent, the aldehydes groups are further converted to carboxylic acid, in the presence of the TEMPO-NaClO-NaBr system. In this way, the amount of the carboxylic groups introduced in the cellulose network, reach the value of about 3110 mmol g−1, which correspond to a degree of oxidation of about 0.54. The simultaneous presence of the three carboxylic groups in one anhydroglucose unit is undoubtedly detectable in 13C NMR, the three distinctive carboxyl groups' peaks being assigned at 176.87 ppm, 177.81 ppm, and 178.35 ppm, respectively, Fig. 2 . The abundance of the carboxyl groups in the cellulose structural unit, lead to an easy and fast solubilization of the oxidized sample in the reaction medium."
10,ATR-FTIR fully characterization of hydrogels,"3.2 ATR-FTIR fully characterization of hydrogels Both PVA and oxidized cellulose possess a relative high crystalline content and also a high self-associating ability, expressed by inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The ATR-FTIR survey spectra of the POxC0.1 to POxC25 blends, presented in Fig. 3 in comparison to that of PVA and oxidized cellulose, show that the critical changes are seen mainly in the alcoholic region, and the other parts of the spectra were hardly affected. The emergence of the characteristic asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate units of oxidized cellulose is observed around 1610 cm−1, while the distinctive ν(CO) vibration in PVA microcrystals at 1143 cm−1 presents a small reduction in intensity. Not immediately visible from the infrared spectra, the shift of the OH stretching vibration makes the difference between the blends with low and high amounts of OxC. The maximum of the band is centered on 3292 cm−1 in pure PVA and is characteristic to double hydrogen bonds built in the crystalline domains, when the hydroxyl group acts as both donor and acceptor of protons. This band enhances in intensity and shifts to the red when OxC increases in the blends up to 0.5% OxC (w/w), where it reaches 3280 cm−1 (Fig. 3(a)). This behavior shows the existence of a larger number of interacting segments of PVA. On further increasing the OxC amount, the ν(OH) band slightly decreased in intensity, became broader and with an evident asymmetry on the high wavenumbers side. Its maximum gradually blueshifts up to 3296 cm−1 at 15% OxC (w/w) and finally redshifts for the highest OxC concentrations (Fig. 3). The opposite shift may be a result of the increased contribution of the ν(OH) band of OxC and of a change in the intermolecular interactions, with the increased involvement of OxC. The displacement of ν(OH) to the blue for OxC loadings higher than 1% came into agreement with the redshift of the νas(COO−) of carboxylate groups, which moves from 1613 cm−1 in oxidized cellulose to 1608 cm−1 in POxC25. For the original broad ν(CO) absorption in PVA (1090 cm−1), the fine vibrational structure developed with increasing the OxC content in the blends is a common feature for all the spectra (Fig. 3(b)). The new appeared band at 1018 cm−1 is observed in all specimens, being an enhancement of the respective shoulder in the pure PVA. For the spectra of the specimens containing up to 15% OxC, the shoulder at 1046 cm−1 in the original PVA became stronger in the POxC0.1 – POxC15 series. In the remaining POxC20 and POxC25 samples, this maxima disappeared being replaced by the ν(C5O) and ν(C6O) vibrations of OxC, at 1058 and 1035 cm−1, which have preserved their position from the pure OxC. The sub-band at 1046 cm−1 is specific to trans- [31] or syndiotactic sequences [32], which are more capable to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and can easily align themselves, forming ordered domains. By spectral decomposition of the alcoholic region, the individual ν(CO) vibrations related to the crystalline and amorphous regions of the matrix allows one to evaluate the dependence of the fraction of ordered PVA chains on the PVA/POxCx ratio. The crystalline-sensitive bands at 1143 cm−1 and the syndiotactic sub-band at 1046 cm−1 can be monitored in comparison with those amorphous sensitive at 1090 cm−1 (related to the gauche conformers) or 1123 cm−1 [33]. The normalized area of the 1143, 1046 and 1018 cm−1 peaks represented against the OxC loading in the blends and illustrated in Fig. 4 showing that the oxidized cellulose behaves differently when is incorporated in low or high amounts in a PVA matrix. The apparent increase of crystallinity due to the formation of ordered syndiotactic sequences, expressed by the variation of 1046 cm−1 band (ν(CO)) (Fig. 4(b)), is fast for OxC concentrations up to 1% (w/w). It can be hypothesized that, at very low concentrations, OxC is well dispersed into the amorphous part of the PVA matrix, where it interacts with the PVA macromolecular chains by surface effects and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but in a low extent. Furthermore, the OxC could act as nucleation centers and promote the alignment of the neighboring small PVA syndiotactic domains, which results in creation of zones of microcrystallinity in the amorphous phase of PVA [34]. The degree of cooperative binding between the PVA chains, which leads to their partial folding, increased significantly up to 0.5% OxC (w/w). This behavior is correlated with the displacement of ν(OH) of PVA towards lower frequencies and increase of its intensity, as well as the enhancement of ν(COH⋯) at 1018 cm−1. This would suggest that the PVA matrix reinforced with a low quantity of OxC, which are linked together by a low number of intermolecular H bonds, is a quite dense network, having a large number of small pores. For concentrations of OxC between 1 and 15% (w/w), the ν(OH) band of PVA have a small blueshift, suggesting a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen binding between the chains of the matrix. Instead, the HCOH⋯OHCH hydrogen bonds between the PVA chains are outnumbered by the HCOH⋯−OC(O) bonds between PVA and OxC. The ordering of PVA chains with syndiotactic configuration has virtually stopped somewhere between 1 and 5% OxC (w/w), and the amorphization of PVA induced by OxC began. Formation of intermolecular bonds between the PVA chains is retarded by OxC by limiting their segmental motion. The nucleation effect is gradually lost, partly due to the aggregation of OxC itself. For OxC loadings higher than 15% (w/w), the amorphous content increases very fast."
11,Morphology of hydrogels,"3.3 Morphology of hydrogels Scanning electron microscopy acquired pictures of selected OxC – PVA hydrogels are shown in Fig. 5 . At the first sight, the images reveal a rather homogeneous composition of the hydrogels, with no evidences of crowded or irregular areas, suggesting thus a good compatibility of the two constituents. All composite samples exhibit large porous structures with interconnected pores, the pore size increasing with the increase of the amount of OxC, from 20–30 μm to 70–80 μm, and the morphology of the hydrogels is slightly changed, those displaying a fleecy network with bolder walls. These features are desirable especially for the biomedical applications, when highly porous structures are required along with an interconnected network to allow cells grow and diffuse, so that enzymes or other growth factors can access the inner part of the porous network. Introduction of quite high quantities of OxC in PVA matrix, do not alter the skeleton porous structure of the obtained hydrogel, as Chen et al., reported in the case of unoxidized cellulose – PVA hydrogels [35], suggesting that the OxC, due to its structural features, bearing three COOH groups/anhydroglucose unit, acts as a physical crosslinking agent. These homogeneous network structures combined with intrinsic qualities of the natural polymer, i.e. cellulose, offer great application usefulness."
12,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,"3.4 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis X-ray diffractograms of the native (unoxidized) cellulose (C), tricarboxy cellulose (OxC), tricarboxy cellulose – PVA (POxC25) and PVA samples are comparatively presented in Fig. 6 . The presence of the sharp reflections and diffuse scattering in XRD pattern of pure PVA is a typical feature of crystalline and amorphous regions of semi-crystalline polymers, PVA diffractograms revealing a unique crystalline contribution peak, corresponding to the (1 0 1) semicrystalline plan around 2θ = 19.8°. On the other hands, the C and OxC samples are almost identical, with the two main diffraction regions characteristic for cellulose I: one attributed to the amorphous area, with peaks at 2θ = 14.8° and 16.6°, and another one for the crystalline zone, with the diffraction pattern at 2θ = 22.8°. The introduction of small amounts of OxC in PVA matrix, lead to the apparition in the diffraction patterns of the hybrid samples, of the “cellulose fingerprint” in the form of shoulder peak at 2θ = 22.8°, at the same time, the crystallinity index, calculated from the ratio of integrated area of all crystal peaks to the total integrated area (including the amorphous area) according to the peak in the X-ray diffractograms of the hydrogels, have increased as the content of oxidized cellulose increased, from 48% in the pure PVA hydrogel to 50.2% in the POxC25 hydrogel."
13,DSC analysis,"3.5 DSC analysis The main thermal characteristics resulting from the analysis of DSC curves are presented in Table 1 . The increased level of humidity, as an evidence of OxC presence in the hydrogels, is emphasized by the dehydration heat values. By introducing high amounts of PVA in hydrogels, both Tpeak and the dehydration heat values of the PVA/OxC mixtures are decreased. The vitreous temperature of transition obtained for PVA is consistent with the values reported by other researchers [36–38]. The presented results in Table 1, show higher Tg values concomitant with an increased amount of the OxC in hydrogels, between 15 and 25%."
14,Rheological behavior of hydrogels,"3.6 Rheological behavior of hydrogels The entangled PVA solutions give stable physical gels after they are submitted to successive freezing/thawing/ageing cycles [39] and the rheological measurements allow the investigation of the network formation. In the present study, the frequency sweep measurements for POxC hydrogels were carried out in the linear viscoelastic range and the dynamic behavior was followed for each sample for the oscillation frequency ranging between 0.1 rad s−1 up to 100 rad s−1. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of G′, G″ and tanδ for a three selected hydrogels: PxC25; POxC15; POxC10 as compared with the sample free of cellulose (PVA). All samples show a gel-like behavior, i.e., G′ > G″, tanδ < 1, and the viscoelastic parameters are independent on the oscillation frequency. By adding tricarboxy cellulose into the PVA solutions, some synergistic effects were observed for the composite hydrogels. Thus, the viscoelastic moduli G′ and G″ present maxima for POxC10 and the loss tangent, which shows the degree of viscoelasticity, is minimum for this sample, suggesting the formation of a strong physical network, due to the favorable physical interactions between PVA and OxC. The effect of OxC content on the network elasticity is evidenced in Fig. 8 . The viscoelastic parameters are enhanced up to 20% OxC introduced in the PVA hydrogels when the composite hydrogels present a synergism and the physical network is stronger, the most favorable interactions occurring for POxC10 (G′ = 901 Pa). The sample with higher OxC content (POxC25) shows a deterioration of the network strength and it presents a G′ value of 450 Pa, bellow the pure PVA sample (500 Pa). Fig. 9 shows the dependence of the complex viscosity on the oscillation frequency for the composite hydrogel samples as compared with pure PVA hydrogel. For a small and moderate amount of cellulose derivative introduced into the PVA matrix (up to 20%), the viscosity is higher as compared with pure PVA hydrogel. As for the elastic modulus (Fig. 8), a maximum value of viscosity is observed for POxC10 (Fig. 9(b)) due to the strong interactions between the two polymers at this composition. The introduction of higher amount of cellulose derivative (above 20%) determines a decrease of the resistance to flow due to the higher sample porosity, and the viscosity presents a sensitive decrease, as shown in Fig. 9(a,b). Self-healing behavior of hydrogels have significant practical applications, since this property can prolong the hydrogels lifespan during their applications. Therefore, the rapid self-healing answer of the hydrogels was well evidenced by oscillatory shear measurements. Thus, an alternate step strain sweep test was carried out in order to identify the healing ability of the POxC hydrogels at a constant angular frequency of 1 rad s−1. After each 200 s, the strain was swept from a small value of 1% to a subsequent large strain of 200%. Fig. 10 shows as example the G′, G″ and tanδ behavior of POxC10 sample submitted to successive low and high strain deformations demonstrate the self-healing ability of the composite hydrogel. Damage of the self-healing hydrogel after a high shear strain and fast recovery of its structure after healing at the low strain is due to the existence of the dynamic network stabilized through physical interactions. Thus, the self-healing POxC hydrogels have the capacity to restore the network structures and its functionality after a damage caused by an external force, thus the lifetime is prolonged. This clearly demonstrates that the composite hydrogels present excellent self-healing ability which recommends these materials for tissue engineering applications."
15,Conclusions,"New hydrogels based on PVA and tricarboxy cellulose (OxC) have been prepared by applying repeated freezing/thawing cycles to mixtures of PVA with OxC in aqueous solutions. The use of the fully carboxylated cellulose derivative allow us to avoid the complex and harmful solvent systems often necessary for the cellulose dissolution, the only solvent employed being water. Moreover, the synthesis route do not require the supplemental presence of any reagents, like cross-linking agent, since the tricarboxy cellulose can successfully takes this role. For low OxC content, the PVA network presents improved structural stability and higher viscoelastic moduli as compared with pure PVA hydrogel. The self-healing ability was demonstrated through dynamic rheological tests by the recovery of the viscoelastic parameters after applying successive low and high strains to POxC hydrogels."
