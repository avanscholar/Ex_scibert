0,Introduction,"The application of photocatalytic reactions to water and air remediation has been widely studied. However, photocatalysis is also capable to selectively oxidize or reduce substrates to produce higher value chemicals. In this new role, the photocatalytic technology appears as an alternative to more conventional synthetic pathways to obtain chemicals. Many case studies on different organic substrates have been reported until now, demonstrating the feasibility of this new approach both in liquid solid [1,2] and in gas-solid regimes [3–5]. Titanium dioxide has been the most popular photocatalyst due to its excellent performances in degradation of toxic molecules. It has been largely used because it is generally scarcely selective for oxidation reactions, giving rise to a complete mineralization of the starting substrates. To avoid the complete mineralization with formation of high value products, it is necessary to reduce the oxidant properties of TiO2. Poor crystalline TiO2, for instance, showed to be very selective to obtain with significant yields aromatic aldehydes from the corresponding alcohol [6], although in most cases the reactions have been performed in organic media [7]. It is worth reminding that TiO2 under UV irradiation in aqueous suspension readily forms highly oxidant hydroxyl radicals. The latter can unselectively attack organic species until their mineralization to CO2 and H2O, and consequently preparation and testing of alternative more selective photocatalysts with lower oxidant ability are desirable for synthetic purposes. Another important point in synthetic photocatalysis is the use of solar energy as the radiation source. Indeed, the large band gap energy of traditional semiconductor photocatalysts, as TiO2 which utilizes only a small fraction of solar energy, remains the bottleneck to satisfy the requirements of sustainable applications. In this context, C3N4 is a photocatalytic material with appropriate thermodynamic requirements, which has recently attracted the attention of many researchers to perform selective heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions. Prof. Antonietti’s group proposed this metal-free conjugated polymeric semiconductor in 2006 as catalyst [8] and then, in 2009, as heterogeneous photocatalyst for H2 evolution [9]. Polymeric carbon nitride, often called graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), is a graphene-like layered material composed of C, N and low amount of H (as an impurity). It consists of conjugated two-dimensional C-N networks, which can form graphite-like π-stacking structures. They combine chemical (insoluble in acid, alkali, or organic solvents) and thermal (stable up to 600 °C) robustness. g-C3N4 is easily prepared by thermal polymerization of abundant nitrogen-rich precursors such dicyandiamide, cyanamide, melamine, urea, thiourea or ammonium thiocyanate, giving rise to yellow powders showing specific surface areas (SSA’s) typically in the range 4-7 m2 g−1. It is not a new material; in fact, it is considered one of the oldest reported artificial polymers in the scientific literature. The history of the carbon nitride polymers could be traced back to 1834, when Berzelius and Liebig obtained “melon”, a linear polymer of interconnected tri-s-triazine groups. The polymerization of N-C containing compounds at elevated temperatures results in the formation of polymeric N-bridged tri-s-triazine as reported in Fig. 1 , via melam formation (Pathway A) or melamine-melem composites (Pathway B) [10]. The electronic structure of carbon nitride semiconductor allows its successful application in the field of selective photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds [11], particularly aromatic alcohols in the presence of molecular oxygen [12]. Indeed, the favourable energies of its conduction and valence bands and the absence of hydroxyl groups on the surface, which would favour the direct formation of the unselective OH· radicals, make this material an optimum candidate for selective oxidation of alcohols also in aqueous medium. Two types of structures have been proposed as the building block of C3N4 [11]. Inspired by the structure of graphite, the s-triazine unit (C3N3; Fig. 2 (a)), with a periodic array of single carbon vacancies, acts as the building block of C3N4 [13–15]. Alternatively, as reported in Fig. 2(b), the structural layer could consist of tri-s-triazine units (C6N7) giving rise to larger periodic vacancies, structurally related to the so-called melon polymer and connected through planar tertiary amino groups [16]. In these two structures the N atom presents different electronic environment and the size of the C3N4 pores will lead to different energetic stability. Kroke at al. concluded by using DFT calculations [17] that the tri-s-triazine based structure (Fig. 2(b)) is both more stable and more energetically favoured compared to the triazine-based units [15,18,19]. Consequently, it is accepted that tri-s-triazine units are the building basic blocks of the sheets in C3N4. The typical XRD diffraction patterns of g-C3N4, present peaks at 13.1° and 27.4° corresponding to the (100) and (002) planes. These are the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units and the stacking of conjugated inter-layers, respectively (JCPDS 87-1526) [8,9]. The bonds of carbon and nitrogen in the g-C3N4 studied by means of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed several major bands centered at ca. 3180, 1200–1650, and 806 cm−1. The broad 3180 cm−1 band was assigned to the stretching vibration of N-H groups [20]. All samples showed peaks at 1325 cm−1, 1439 cm−1, 1575 cm−1, 1639 cm−1, which can be assigned to the stretching modes of CN heterocycles [21–23]. A sharp peak at 806 cm−1 was considered to be the characteristic bending modes of the s-triazine units [24,25]. The Raman spectrum of g-C3N4 nanosheets shows peaks at 589, 707, 767, 977, 1115, 1233, 1265, and 1573 cm−1 [26,27]. The most characteristic ones are the peak centred at 707 cm−1, due to the bending modes of the s-triazine ring, and the peaks at 1233 and 1573 cm−1 attributed to stretching modes of CN and CN heterocycles [28,29]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) gives information about compositions and chemical states in g-C3N4. The XPS survey spectra of g-C3N4 usually contain three sharp peaks at ∼286, ∼396, and ∼529 eV, which are assigned to C 1 s, N 1 s, and O 1 s signals, respectively. However, often three distinct carbon species could be present in the C 1 s spectra. The main C 1 s peak at 288 eV corresponds to sp2-hybridized carbon (NCN), which is considered as the major carbon species in the polymeric g-C3N4. A peak at 284 eV is due to sp2 CC and that corresponding to a binding energy of about 286 eV is attributed to CNH2 species [30,31]. As far as N 1 s spectra are concerned, a peak at binding energy about 398 eV is assigned to the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in CNC, assessing the presence of the triazine rings. A peak at about 399 eV corresponds to sp3-hybridized tertiary nitrogen N(C)3, whilst a peak at 401 eV is attributed to amino groups functionalized with hydrogen (CNH), suggesting the existence of defects [32]. Teter et al. described the theoretical existence of seven phases of C3N4 [13], i.e. α-C3N4, β-C3N4, cubic C3N4, pseudo-cubic C3N4, g-h-triazine, g-triazine and g-h-heptazine and they determined the band gap value of the cubic C3N4 phases, considered as indirect semiconductors, equal to 2.90 eV, whilst the calculated band gaps of α-C3N4 and β-C3N4 are 3.85 and 3.25 eV, respectively. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations usually underestimates the experimental band gaps values by 15–20%, hence the actual band gaps of the carbon nitride structures, if they can be synthesized, should be higher. The experimental band-gap values of both g-h-triazine and g-h-heptazine, the layered allotropes, show lower band gaps compared to classic photocatalysts as TiO2. The relatively low values are justified by the presence of the sp2-hybridized carbon and nitrogen atoms, establishing π-conjugated electronic structures [33]. Hence, the band-gap of these structures overlaps the visible light spectrum of the solar irradiation because 2.7–2.8 eV corresponds to ca. 450-460 nm. Using sunlight in heterogeneous photocatalysis is particularly relevant to fulfil innovative and economically consistent synthetic processes and, at the same time, to move towards a sustainable chemistry reducing the environmental impact. It is worth to remind that the fundamental principle in heterogeneous photocatalysis mechanism is the promotion of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) by absorbing photons when the incident visible light energy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the semiconductor. Holes are consequently present in the valence band whose value is responsible for the oxidant ability of the photocatalytic solid. Different semiconductors, in fact, exhibit different band gaps along with valence and conduction band edges position, so the photo-generated hole/electron pairs show different oxidation and reduction potentials. The recombination of hole and electron pairs often occurs lowering the photo-catalytic efficiency. A photocatalytic process can occur depending upon the relative relationships between the VB and CB potentials of the photocatalyst and the redox potentials of the reaction that should occur [34]. The more positive the VB position, the more favoured the oxidation reaction, the more negative the CB position the more favoured the reduction reaction. Fig. 3 shows the band positions for some important semiconductor used in heterogeneous photocatalysis along with the reduction potentials of H2O to O2 and H+ to H2. The use of TiO2 in photocatalytic reactions occurring in water suspension ensures the formation of holes and hence of OH radicals (also O2 − and H2O2) responsible for the oxidation reactions. This insight justifies, as already discussed, the extensive use of TiO2 for the total mineralization of most of the organic pollutants. Formation of OH radicals occurs because the potential of the VB both in TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is more positive than that of the OH radical formation (see Fig. 4 ). Some photocatalysts with more negative CB positions than TiO2, highlighted in red in Fig. 3, could produce photo-generated electrons with strong reduction ability, capable of giving rise to H2 evolution from H2O and/or CO2 reduction. So, by a thermodynamic point of view, C3N4 can be counted among those solids which are theoretically able to photoreduce CO2, to photoproduce H2 from H2O or to give rise to water photosplitting (see Fig. 3). However, C3N4 has been also used for oxidation reactions and, as first reported by Antonietti et al., its VB and CB edges positions reveal a high reducing potential but a low oxidant ability. CB edge, in fact, is located at -1.13 V, whereas the valence band edge at + 1.57 V at pH = 7 vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) [9,35]. As reported in Fig. 4, where the C3N4 band edges are compared with those of TiO2, the electrons promoted into the conduction band of C3N4 are thermodynamically capable to reduce O2 to form the superoxide radical O2 − or H2O2. On the contrary, the potential of the holes generated in the VB is not capable to oxidize OH– forming hydroxyl radicals. These thermodynamic properties justify why C3N4, in principle, could be a suitable photocatalyst for the partial oxidation reactions in aqueous medium, whilst TiO2, which is a less selective material, is suitable mainly for the mineralization of organic molecules to CO2 and H2O. It is important to remind that H2O is regarded as an ideal solvent in organic reactions, although some authors has questioned this statement, due to the difficulty to separate the organic species when the selectivity is lower than 100%. The disadvantage of using TiO2 as photocatalyst in water suspensions, derives from the position of its valence band, which allows to easily oxidize H2O forming OH radicals, thus making the reaction system hardly controllable. By considering the thermodynamic properties of C3N4, some of which are reported in Fig. 4, it can be noticed that this photocatalyst is able to form superoxide radicals (O2 − ) which possesses less oxidant ability than hydroxyl radicals (OH). Notwithstanding its low oxidant ability, C3N4 has been frequently used under visible light irradiation for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, unless they are often only partially oxidized [19]. Another important feature of the C3N4 layers is relative to the presence of different surface nitrogen functional groups, as reported in Fig. 5 . Carbon nitride can be considered as a multifunctional (photo)catalyst because the electronic properties allow its use as catalyst in the Friedel-Crafts, Diels-Alder and trimerization of alkynes reactions, whilst the nucleophilic ones are effective for CO2 activation. Moreover, the ability to form H bonds justifies its use for the trimerization of nitriles [36]. Some photocatalysts with narrow band gap, such as CdS, AgIn(WO4)2 and C3N4, without any modification or doping, possess inherent selectivity for the photocatalytic oxidations, because of the relatively low oxidative ability. In addition, various substrates present different reaction rate and selectivity even in the presence of the same photocatalyst, and type and position of the substituent(s) in the reacting molecules can influence not only the performances but also the distribution of the products. The versatility to obtain C3N4 from the abundant carbon and nitrogen sources makes easy to modify its surface without changing the composition. A different degree of condensation, order and/or packing of the 2-D layers gives rise to different structures with different surface features, and (photo)catalytic performances. Literature reports many papers where efforts are reported to obtain the ideal preparation method of C3N4, and, in particular, the optimal pyrolysis conditions and the best structural composition to enhance the photocatalytic activity in many processes; but a straight correlation between structure, electronic properties and photocatalytic activity has not yet been reported and work is in progress. The photocatalytic activity of this organic conjugated semiconductor has been observed to be limited by its relatively low charge mobility, high recombination rate of charge carriers, low specific surface area, and insufficient absorption of sunlight which is restricted to the blue range of the spectrum. The efficiency of C3N4-photocatalyzed selective oxidation of organic molecules is therefore still unsatisfactory, and the process requires both high pressure and elevated temperature. In other words, practical applications of pristine C3N4 are still hindered by the high recombination rate of charge carriers, the low electrical conductivity and the lack of absorption above 460 nm [37,38]. The recombination processes of photogenerated excitons have been identified as one of the most important drawbacks of the pristine C3N4 material [39]. This problem has been extensively studied by photoluminescence spectroscopy, however even if it can reveal information on recombination, the relaxation course of carrier dynamics remains vague [40]. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements along with EPR resulted appropriate tools to determine the charge carriers course and to investigate the photogenerated charge carriers behaviour, especially the events of photoinduced electrons and holes at the material-reactant interface [39–42]. The results conclude that by using the pristine g-C3N4 fast recombination processes occurred as the main fate of photo-gerenerated charge carriers, and only a small fraction of the charge carriers can survive to the micro- or millisecond range by trapping effects [41]. The relatively long lived charge separation state of hydrogenated C3N4 material, increases the probability of charge carriers to participate in catalytic redox reactions [39–42]. By following this idea several approaches have been explored to improve/modify/optimize the structure of C3N4 both for environmental and energy applications. Chemical modiﬁcations by incorporating speciﬁc substituents and functional groups [43] or by using templates [44–50] could not only increase the specific surface area (SSA), but also modify the band gap value and/or improve the electron-hole separation. In terms of nanostructure design, different morphologies of C3N4 have been obtained by different synthetic routes including soft and hard templating, supramolecular pre-organization and thermal [51–53] or chemical exfoliation [54–56]. The polymeric layer can be also modified by adding doping elements to change the surface at molecular level. Doping is an efficient strategy to tune optical, electronic, luminescent, and other physico-chemical properties of C3N4 [57]. Non-metallic elements as fluorine [58], boron [59], phosphorous [60,61], and metals as iron [62] incorporated into the C3N4 layer, induce superior performances. In addition to its use for environmental purposes and CO2 reduction, hydrogen generation or water photo-splitting, C3N4 can act also as a metal-free visible light photocatalyst to selectively obtain organic molecules. The selective photo-oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes will be reviewed and reported in the following."
1,Photocatalytic selective reactions in the presence of C3N4,
2,Partial oxidation of aromatic alcohols,"2.1 Partial oxidation of aromatic alcohols Oxidation and dehydrogenation are important reactions to obtain a functionality into petroleum or biomass based feedstocks molecules as a first step to prepare high-value fine chemicals. C3N4 irradiated with visible light has been used as a photocatalyst to activate oxygen and carry out oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes/ketones with high selectivity. The oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes is a reaction of fundamental importance in both laboratory and commercial procedures. Traditionally, aldehydes are produced by oxidation of alcohols in halogenated solvents. The protocols typically include oxidizing species as Cr(VI), Mn(VII) or V(V) [63]. New benign routes in the absence of expensive and harmful inorganic oxidants as well as organic solvents are urgently necessary. Green oxidants like O2 or H2O2 and harmless solvents like water are welcome. One of the first attempts to selectively oxidize aromatic alcohols to aldehydes by a heterogeneous process using C3N4 is reported by Su et al. [64]. They used a 100 mL autoclave equipped with a quartz window and pressurized with O2 or air at 8 bar and heated up to 100 °C. 50 mg of mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) and 10 mL of an organic solvent (acetonitrile, toluene, perfluorohexane or trifluorotoluene) with 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol were introduced in the system. The irradiation was carried out with a 300 W Xenon lamp with a cut-off filter (irradiation λ > 420 nm). The remarkable conversions and selectivities obtained, reported in Table 1 , could be just criticized using organic solvents and the pressure and temperature needed for the occurrence of the photocatalytic process. The reaction was hypothesized to proceed according to the scheme reported in Fig. 6 (A), where it is shown that a superoxide species (O2 −∙) formed by the photogenerated electrons on the C3N4 surface is responsible for the deprotonation of the alcohol. The produced alkoxide species could follow the oxidative route by reacting (i) with the hole in the VB with transfer of its electron or (ii) with the superoxide species giving rise to the ketone or the aldehyde and H2O2, as schematized in Fig. 6(B). Authors claim that the ˙OOH species, generated in situ, as seen in Fig. 6(B), could be considered as the oxidant species. Oxygen is the electron acceptor generating the superoxide anion which gives rise to the final oxidant species. The photooxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) has been investigated in various acidic/basic aqueous solutions by Long et al. [65]. In acidic aqueous solutions both the conversion of BA and the selectivity to benzaldehyde are improved. Particularly, the conversion of BA reaches 63% at pH = 0 which is 2.3 times higher than at pH = 7, and the selectivity increases from 51% to 78%. However, the selectivity decreases up to 68% when an excess of HCl (3 times more) is used, although the conversion slightly increases (68%). In the traditional catalytic oxidation, bases promote the formation of the alkoxy intermediate, but Long et al. observed that the photocatalytic activity is depleted in basic solutions. The reaction was extended to other aromatic primary alcohols and the results are summarized in Table 2 . The presence of electron-donating groups (-OCH3 and -CH3) in the BA structure positively affects the conversion, whilst electron-withdrawing groups (-F, -Cl and -NO2) have a scarce effect. This behaviour has been observed before [66] and it is an indication of electron-deficient intermediates involved in the redox process [67]. C3N4 showed higher efficiency for the oxidation of alcohols with strong electron-donating groups, as reported in Table 2. Electron spin resonance experiments suggested the formation of the superoxide radical by electron transfer from C3N4 photoactivated under visible light irradiation, whilst the cationic hole directly dehydrogenates the alcohol (oxidative dehydrogenation) (Table 3 ). The same authors also analyzed H2O2 present in the system and concluded that the reductive potential of the photogenerated electrons is strong enough to reduce O2 to O2 −∙, producing H2O2 by reaction of the superoxide radical with a proton. They claim that H2O2 is the ultimate responsible for the selective oxidation of the aromatic alcohols in water which seems a more convincing mechanism with respect to the direct oxidation of the organic molecule by the photogenerated hole [65]. Moreover, they compared the photocatalytic performance of mesoporous graphitic C3N4 (mpg-C3N4) with other inorganic photocatalysts which are active under visible light, as TiO2-xNx, CdS, TaON, (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox), (Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx), and Ta3N5. Both the conversion of 4-metoxybenzylalcohol and the selectivity to 4-methoxybenzaldehyde by using various photocatalysts are reported in Fig. 7 . TiO2-xNx and CdS displayed a high selectivity, but conversion of the alcohol (33% and 25%, respectively) was unsatisfactory, whilst a good compromise seems to be achieved in the presence of C3N4. Zhang et al. modified C3N4 by treating it with an H2SO4 solution under reflux. They used the resulting solid for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with O2 at 1 bar and 100 °C under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) by using trifluoroethene as the solvent [68]. The yield in benzaldehyde was 23% after 4 h of irradiation which is about 2.5 times higher than that of unmodified C3N4. The acidic treatment of C3N4 increases its surface area, decreases the particles size and produces a band gap enlargement. Lima et al. synthetized C3N4 by thermal condensation of dicyandiamide and the obtained solid was exposed to different thermal, mechanical and chemical post-treatments [69]. The solid was subjected to thermal treatment at 400, 450 and 500 °C, mechanical treatment for 1.5, 3.0 and 8.0 h or stirred in acidic solutions of H2SO4, HCl and HNO3. The obtained materials were used for selective photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in aqueous medium at natural pH (5.6) and upon irradiation at λ = 392 nm by using a LED. All the post-treatments enhanced significantly both conversion and selectivity to the aldehyde. The best performance (66% conversion, 59% yield, and 90% selectivity after 4 h irradiation) was obtained with the thermo exfoliated material at 500 °C (87 m2/g), in agreement with other published research [56]. The benzaldehyde yield was 3.4 times higher using the thermo exfoliated sample than the pristine C3N4. The mechanical post-treatments resulted in the cleavage of bulk C3N4 into smaller particles. Both mechanical and chemical treatments introduced structural and chemical defects. Authors observed a reduced effect of the post-thermal treatment on the band-gap energy of the prepared photocatalysts, contrary to what reported later by others [61]. Mechanical and chemical treatments widened-up the band-gap, which could give rise to a positive effect on the formation of benzaldehyde, along with to an increase of the surface area of the resulting catalysts. The same authors also used C3N4 loaded with noble metals (Au, Ru, Pd, Pt, Ir, Ag and Rh) for the same reaction to increase benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde yield [70]. The efficiency of the process depended on the type of metal, the nanoparticle size and the bandgap value of the final material. Both conversion and selectivity obtained with metals on C3N4 were higher than by using TiO2 as the support. The best results were obtained with Ru/C3N4 (possessing the smallest metal nanoparticles (4.9 nm) and the lowest bandgap (2.66 eV)) at pH 2.0 The best conversion, yield and selectivity were 73, 53 and 72%, respectively. At pH 5.6 (natural pH) both conversion and selectivity slightly decreased. The obtained results are reported in Fig. 8 . Selective oxidation of an aromatic alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline at 60 °C by using benzotrifluoride as the solvent have been carried out also under N2 atmosphere (0.5 MPa). The photocatalyst used was a CdS/C3N4 composite. After 4 h irradiation, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the yield to benzaldehyde were about 48.0% and 44.6%, respectively, and the conversion of nitrobenzene and the yield to aniline were about 49.2% and 26.0%, respectively. The optimum percentage of CdS was 10% wt. Authors claim a synergic effect of C3N4 and CdS. The heterojunction can effectively separate and transfer the photoexcited carriers, as reported in Fig. 9 , enhancing the photocatalytic activity with respect to the bare materials. Notably, no superoxide radical could be formed in this case because O2 was absent in the system. In the proposed mechanism, reported in Fig. 9, oxidation of the alcohol and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline took place through the photoproduced holes and electrons, respectively [71]. Holes in the valence band of the excited CdS migrate to the C3N4, whilst electrons in the conduction band of CdS from C3N4. Consequently, nitrobenzene was reduced on the surface of CdS, and aromatic alcohols were oxidized on the surface of C3N4. Conversion and yield for oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline in the presence of the composite photocatalyst were higher than in the presence of the single photocatalyst. Ding et al. prepared nitrogen vacant C3N4 for the photocatalytic oxidation of various aromatic alcohols to aldehydes [72]. The defective nanosheets were synthesized by thermal condensation of melamine pre-treated with HNO3. The photocatalytic oxidation under simulated sunlight was carried out in the presence of O2 and acetonitrile as the solvent. The introduction of nitrogen vacancies at the uncondensed terminal NHx lattice sites in the framework, contributed to an enhancement of the optical absorption and a slightly increase of the surface area. Authors claim that the vacancies acted as electron or hole traps enhancing the separation efficiency of the photogenerated h+/e− pairs. They observed that the conversion of benzyl alcohol increased first and then decreased when the reaction temperature increased (from 25 °C to 55 °C). This finding was attributed to the slow thermal motion of the substrate molecules at the low temperature and to the thermal decomposition of the oxidant (claimed to be H2O2) at the high temperature. The reaction then was carried out at 35 °C and four solvents (acetonitrile, dimethyl carbonate, tributhyl phosphate, trifluorotoluene) were chosen. Acetonitrile revealed to be the best option, due to its higher polarity and better ability to dissolve O2 with respect to the others. The best material (SSA 23 m2/g) gave rise to ca. 68% conversion of benzyl alcohol and 99% selectivity to benzaldehyde after 9 hours of reaction. In agreement with the literature [66,73], electron-donating groups (-CH3 and particularly -OCH3) in para position to the -CH2OH group, positively influence the conversion of benzyl alcohol. This insight could be due to the formation of electron-deficient intermediates which favour the photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols to the aldehydes. On the contrary, electron-withdrawing groups exhibit slightly reduced conversion. Chen et al. integrated a thiophene motif into the C3N4 network to improve the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols with O2 [74]. Thiophene and its derivatives are strong electron donors which could act as chromophoric centers to harvest photons. According to the authors, the modification extends the absorption of the material to the visible range and create heterostructures in the C3N4 surface able to promote exciton splitting and separation of the photoproduced charges. This behaviour can be justified by the presence of the S-heteroatom with its ability to switch oxidation states and by the modified electronic band structures which are expected to have a strong effect on the activation of O2 and the alcohol to suffer redox reactions. The partial oxidation reaction of some aromatic alcohols was carried out by using trifluorotoluene as the solvent, in O2 (1 bar), at 60° for 3 h and irradiating at λ > 420 nm. The results obtained are reported in Table 4 . The observation of singlet oxygen (1O2) by Chen et al. is an additional insight in this research because 1O2 is an important species in the field of organic photosynthesis. The presence of P in C3N4 improved the aromatic alcohols conversion and selectivity to the aldehyde [61]. The influence of the type (donor group) and position of the substituents in the aromatic ring (meta or para) on conversion and selectivity to aldehyde was remarkable, similarly to what reported before by using TiO2 as the photocatalyst [73]. Table 5 reports conversion and selectivities for oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA), 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and piperonyl alcohol (PA) to the corresponding aldehydes under UV (365 nm) and visible light in aerated water suspension. The photocatalysts used were bare and P doped C3N4 prepared by thermal condensation from melamine, urea or thiourea (labelled as C3N4-M, C3N4-U and C3N4-TU, respectively). A powder prepared in the presence of cyanuric acid (C3N4-M-CyA) and two thermoexfoliated C3N4 materials were also tested (C3N4-TE-2 and C3N4-TE-3). The differences between the last two was the heating speed to 520 °C that was 2 or 3 °C/min, respectively. Finally, the results of experiments carried out in the presence of TiO2 as the photocatalyst are also reported in Table 5 for the sake of comparison. As reported in Table 5, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol was the aromatic alcohol most easily oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde. The presence of P slightly increased the selectivity to the aldehyde, but the conversion decreased. For instance, 78% selectivity to the aldehyde was obtained after 42% conversion in the presence of C3N4-TU, whilst the selectivity was 100% after 35% conversion in the presence of the best P-doped C3N4 (C3N4-TU-P) [61]. The thermo exfoliated undoped samples were more active and the selectivity high, but a drawback for the obtainment of these powders is the very low yield of the process [53]. Both conversion and selectivity by using TiO2 under the same experimental conditions resulted far worse with respect to all the C3N4 samples. It can be concluded that the metal-free organic semiconducting polymers based on C3N4 give rise to good performances, and, in particular, a remarkably high selectivity towards the formation of aldehydes from benzylic alcohols compared to the traditional photocatalysts. The results which were obtained for aromatic molecules give hope that these photocatalytically active polymers could allow the oxidation of other more demanding substrates such as for instance alkanes while maintaining their high selectivity."
3,Partial oxidation of furanic alcohols,"2.2 Partial oxidation of furanic alcohols Among various biomass-derived products, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered one of the most appealing and promising platform compounds. Indeed, this furanic ring contains an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group, so it can be furtherly transformed into high-quality chemicals [75]. For instance, the oxidation of HMF can yield 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde (FDC) or 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), the precursors for biopolymers fabrication. TiO2 has been used for the photocatalytic partial oxidation of this furanic alcohol and for hexatomic aromatic alcohols. It is not surprising that, due to the lower stability of the furanic ring with respect to the aromatic one, the selectivity to the aldehyde is much lower in the case of furane, achieving the highest selectivity (ca. 22%) in the HMF to FDC photocatalytic reaction [76]. Carbon nitride has been used for the partial oxidation of HMF to FCD. Wu et al. used C3N4 obtained by melamine calcination for the selective oxidation of HMF to FDC [77]. They obtain the highest FDC yield (ca. 27%) with a selectivity of 85% in the presence of O2 after 6 h reaction with a conversion of ca. 30%. The effect of the solvent was also investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 10 . The highest photoactivity was achieved using benzotrifluoride (PhCF3) as the solvent, probably due to its low polarity and better ability to solubilize O2. In contrast, polar solvents might cause a decrease in conversion. This behaviour can be ascribed to a competition between the reactant and the solvent for the active catalytic sites. The selectivity to FDC was higher by irradiating the photocatalysts under visible light (λ > 400 nm) than by UV (λ > 360 nm). This finding can be explained by considering the overoxidation of the formed aldehyde to FDCA. Heating of the system gave rise also to FDC overoxidation. Authors claim the role of the superoxide radical as oxidant species in photocatalytic experiments under visible-light (λ > 400 nm), and they propose the reaction scheme reported in Fig. 11 . In this mechanism the photo-generated electron in the conduction band reduces O2 to superoxide radicals (O2 − ) which remains adsorbed on the C3N4 surface. Wu et al. claim that this interaction occurs because of the positive charges on the catalysts surface. The base character of the surface, meanwhile, allows the deprotonation of HMF (A) giving rise to the alkoxyde anion (B), which can react with the photoproduced hole in the valence band to form the radical (C). The recombination of (C) radical with O2 −∙ produces the corresponding aldehyde (D), with the contemporaneous release of H2O2, which eventually can oxidize FDC to FDCA (E). The UV light irradiation could give rise to higher concentration of superoxide species with respect to the irradiation in the visible range, and this can explain the higher HMF conversion and initial reaction rate under UV. On the contrary, lower amount of superoxide radicals on the surface of the photocatalyst explains, according to the authors, the better selectivity to FDC, (B) in Fig. 11, under visible irradiation, implying contemporaneously a lower HMF conversion. Wu et al. studied also the dependence of the O2 concentration in the HMF partial oxidation. By increasing O2 concentration the photoactivity improved remarkably. Authors observed that by increasing the O2 flow rate from 1 to 10 ml/min, the conversion increased from 15 to 31% and the selectivity and yield to FDC from 68 to 85 and 10 to 27, respectively. Interestingly, no difference was observed when pure O2 instead of air was used. When N2 was purged in the system only traces of HMF gave rise to FDC (selectivity 73.9%) probably because O2 from air was previously chemically adsorbed on the surface of g-C3N4. A similar result was observed by Krivstov et al. [53]. Indeed, by previously purging with N2 for 1 h at 80 °C no reaction occurred, further revealing that oxygen is necessary as the oxidant species. The results obtained by Krivstov et al. for the same reaction are in total agreement with Wu et al., however in that case the solvent was water and the experiments were carried out at room conditions [53]. Two samples, graphitic g-C3N4 prepared by thermal condensation of melamine, urea or thiourea (SSA, in the range 4–28 m2 g−1) and a thermally etched C3N4 (ca. 200 m2 g−1) prepared from the former and showing improved physicochemical features, were studied as photocatalysts for the partial oxidation HMF to FDC. The activity of thermally exfoliated C3N4 increased with respect to that observed after just one thermal treatment. The second thermal treatment reduced the C3N4 uncondensed NH2 sites on the surface, which were detrimental for the partial photooxidation of HMF to FDC. Notably, the thermally etched C3N4 showed better activity and selectivity towards FDC formation under real outdoor illumination than by using UV lamps, reaching 50% at 40% of HMF conversion in aqueous medium. In Fig. 12 , the results obtained by using thermally etched C3N4 at 520 °C and 540 °C, labelled as MCN-520 and MCN-540, are reported. Despite the band gap values of MCN-540 and MCN-520 were 2.90 and 2.79 eV, respectively, the latter was not more active even with the NaNO2 filter cutting-off UV irradiation (Fig. 12A). The lower activity of the C3N4 at λ > 400 nm indicated, contrarily to what reported [65,78], that UV-light played an important role in the activation of C3N4. The formation of FDC in the presence of MCN-540 (see Fig. 12(B)), was maximum after about 2 h irradiation and the further concentration decrease was attributed to the decomposition of most of the HMF, which was preferentially photo-oxidized by C3N4. The formation of FDC was higher under solar irradiation compared to experiments performed under UV-lamps irradiation by using MCN-520 and MCN-540, reaching a selectivity of about 50% after 40% conversion (Fig. 12(C)). The use of a UV-filter did not significantly change the selectivity, although it reduced the HMF conversion and the photolysis of substrate and product. This finding indicates that the HMF partial oxidation occurred mainly under UV irradiation, and consequently the reaction data were plotted versus the cumulative energy entering the reactor between 315 and 400 nm. Fig. 12(D) reports the reactivity data in Fig. 12(A) and (B) versus the cumulative energy, E, entering the reactor. The role of the highly efficient dehydrogenating superoxide species (O2 − ) formed by the reaction of the photogenerated e− with the atmospheric O2 was outstanding. This conclusion was reached by the results of some HMF to FDC photocatalytic experiments carried out in the presence of scavengers. Tert-butyl alcohol, sodium formate, cupric ions (Cu(II)) or p-benzoquinone were used as OH radical, hole, electron and superoxide radical (O2 -∙) scavengers, respectively. As seen in Fig. 13 , a minor change of HMF conversion occurred while the selectivity remained unchanged in the presence of t-butyl alcohol. Consequently, the presence of hydroxyl radicals was not determinant for the HMF partial oxidation. By using acetone as the solvent, the conversion rate decreased, but the selectivity increased, due to the absence of unselective ∙OH radicals and H2O2. The presence of sodium formate gave rise to a significant decrease of the HMF conversion, which is in accord with a decomposition via the direct hole interaction. The abatement of conversion and selectivity in the presence of Cu(II) and p-benzoquinone indicated that superoxide radicals were mainly responsible for the partial oxidation of HMF to FDC. The unexpected activity under anaerobic conditions (N2), was explained by considering that terminal functional groups and/or adsorbed surface species on the photocatalyst could induce in some extent electron-hole separation. Therefore, analogously to which occurs for the photooxidation of aromatic alcohols in organic media, superoxide radicals formed via the reduction of molecular oxygen by the photogenerated electrons, are the reactive species mainly responsible for the HMF partial oxidation to FDC in water. A post treatment of the C3N4 obtained from melamine has been carried out sonochemically, hydrothermally and by ball milling in the presence of acidic or basic solutions. The chemical exfoliation did not modify the specific surface area of the initial C3N4, but an increase of the alcohol conversion and selectivity to the corresponding aldehyde was observed in some cases. The best results were obtained in the presence of the thermally exfoliated powder, followed by that prepared under acidic sonochemical conditions [56], in agreement with other investigations, where the acidic treatment resulted the best strategy to improve the performance of the C3N4 [68,69]. Very recently Xu et al. have selectively obtained the furanic dicarboxylic acid, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), by the partial oxidation of HMF [79]. The reaction has been carried out at room conditions in air and by using water as the solvent under simulated sunlight. The photocatalyst used was a cobalt thioporphyrazine (CoPz) supported on C3N4. FDCA yield of 96.1% (HMF conversion of 99.1%) in aqueous solution at pH 9 was achieved, although at pH 4 the main product was the aldehyde FDC. The selectivities in FDCA obtained by Xu et al. open an intriguing possibility to obtain FDCA by photocatalytic sustainable methodologies. It is worth to remind that the previous literature reports FDC as the main reaction product with negligible FDCA production. The outstanding results obtained by Xu et al. are reported in Table 6 . The data obtained by using CoPz/C3N4 under irradiation are the best results reported until now. It is important to note the high powder of the lamp (0.5 W/cm2) along with the presence of a buffer solution of Na2B4O7 in the reacting medium to maintain the pH 9. According to Xu et al., the CoPz-C3N4 material is a better photocatalyst than bare C3N4 for partial oxidations, contrarily to what claimed in literature and above exposed, because it could produce OH radicals, and the thioporphyrazine (CoPz) activates O2 to singlet oxygen (1O2) which in turn oxidizes HMF to FDCA in a more controllable way. Singlet oxygen (1O2), is one of the most important reactive oxygen species (ROS), among O2 −∙, hydroxyl radicals and H2O2. Nevertheless, due to the spin-flip restrictions between triplet (ground state) O2 and its singlet excited state, the conversion process is forbidden under normal conditions, and hence photosensitizers are usually required for effective 1O2 generation [80]. The strong interaction between the CoPz and C3N4 in the CoPz/C3N4 catalyst should hinder the OH radical generation promoting the 1O2 generation on the CoPz sites, significantly enhancing the catalytic performance. The phosphorescence emission results suggest the occurrence of an electron transfer between CoPz and C3N4. This strong electron interaction between C3N4 and CoPz involves the empty d orbital of Co(II) and the free electrons coming from the π-conjugated molecule or the lone-pair of the N atoms in C3N4. The mechanism of the reaction suggested by Xu et al. is reported in Fig. 14 . The good results along with the controversial mechanism reported by Xu et al. exemplify that still many problems are open in this field. The presence of sensitizers as CoPz on the surface of active photocatalysts, in fact, is an intriguing topic, due to their beneficial effect on the photoreactivity. A great deal of attention is needed to control the experimental conditions (pH, temperature, amount of sensitizer, reaction time, and so on) to avoid leaching after long reaction times and degradation of the sensitizer, especially in aqueous environment. It is not easy, finally, to monitor the presence of singlet oxygen in all the experimental conditions tested, although its formation has been reported several times in the literature. Singlet oxygen is usually formed in batch reactions for the synthesis of natural products and drugs. Tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP), rose bengal (RB) or methylene blue (MB) are the most common sensitizers (Sens0) in homogeneous solutions [81]. Irradiation of the sensitizer gives rise to an exited state (Sens*) to efficiently produce singlet oxygen (type II) and trace amounts of oxygen radicals (type I), as reported in Fig. 15 . It is intriguing that the conjugated structure of C3N4 might involve energy transfer between excited triplet excitons and ground-state oxygen molecules to generate 1O2. The poor triplet-exciton yield of g-C3N4 would be responsible for 1O2 generation [80]. However, specific design of modified C3N4 could significantly enhance triplet exciton state and hence single oxygen. A possibility could be, in addition to the use of sensitizers, the incorporation of a thiophene motif in the CN structure [74] as previously mentioned, or carbonyl groups into the g-C3N4 polymer matrix via a simple oxidization treatment. Indeed, Wang. et al. claimed that the presence of high concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups would greatly influence the oxygen activation behaviours of the materials, giving several ROS, including O2 −∙, hydroxyl radicals H2O2 and singlet oxygen. They identify the ROS formed during the molecular oxygen activation process by using four scavengers, i.e. superoxide dismutase (SOD), mannite, catalase, and tryptophan as the scavengers for O2 − , hydroxyl radicals, H2O2 and singlet oxygen. Only tryptophan was found to effectively inhibit the oxidation of the probe molecule (tetramethylbenzidine) supporting the fact that also in this case singlet oxygen was responsible for the oxidation process [82]. Very few recent papers support until now the role of singlet oxygen as the responsible species for photocatalytic oxidation by using C3N4 materials [83,84], hence alternative photocatalytic mechanisms related to photoexcitation processes could play a role in charge-transfer and energy-transfer processes in polymeric semiconductors and they would deserve further studies."
4,Conclusions,"Heterogeneous photocatalysis which has been proposed in the field of oxidation and reduction reactions to mineralize pollutants has been also used for partial oxidation reactions with the aim to obtain valuable products. Some papers where C3N4 based photocatalysts have been chosen for selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes have been reviewed. Polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4), in fact, has been reported to possess suitable surface physico-chemical and thermodynamic features, and the photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols may represent a useful example to try next future to apply this technology from an industrial point of view. Notably, (i) the simple and cheap preparations of bare, sensitized and doped C3N4 samples which are easily handed and recovered, (ii) the possibility of operating under green conditions, (iii) the good results obtained in terms of conversion, selectivity and yield, indicate that this type of reaction and photocatalyst deserves deepening with the purpose of future engineering scale-up."
