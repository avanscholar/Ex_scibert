0,Introduction,"Owing to the continuous social and economic developments across the world, the generation of solid wastes, especially waste tires has significantly increased considerable environmental challenges [1]. Waste tires are non-biodegradable solid wastes, which require serious attention due to the tremendous growth in automotive industries and transportation sectors. About 1.4 billion units of scrap tires are produced annually from different sized vehicles of which nearly 1.5 × 1010 kg are discarded every year [2]. Nearly 313 million and 35 million scrap tires are generated annually in the U.S. and Canada, respectively [3]. Moreover, in Europe, approximately 33 × 108 kg of scrap tires originate each year [4]. Landfilling is not a preferred option for the disposal of waste tires due to their non-biodegradable nature, which can let them linger in the soil for centuries. Moreover, incineration of waste tires can also produce a massive amount of obnoxious emissions containing greenhouse gases (CO, CO2, NO x and SO x ), toxic gases (furans and dioxins), particulate matter, smoke and other hazardous environmental pollutants [5,6]. Scrap tires find applications in cement industries and thermal power plants where they are used as a fuel source followed by material recovery industries [7,8]. Furthermore, waste tires are recycled to produce processed coating materials for several civil engineering applications such as paving roads, flooring on sport fields and roofing materials. In the recent years, the global research interest on the conversion of waste tires to produce hydrocarbon fuels has been gaining momentum. The exploiting consumption of fossil fuels and increasing energy demands due to worldwide industrial and economic growth have directed growing research interest in alternative fuels [9,10]. It is estimated that waste tires have a calorific value of 34,890 kJ/kg [11], which is higher than coal to certain extent (16,050 kJ/kg to 33,355 kJ/kg) [12]. Considering the carbonaceous nature and environmentally benign remediation, waste tires can be potentially diverted for waste-to-energy production, especially to derive gas and liquid hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals [13,14]. It is essential to determine the composition of waste tires for predicting and understanding their behavior during waste-to-energy conversion. Tires are durable and heavy duty synthetic materials made up of rubber, nylon, fabric, steel wires, carbon black and certain chemical additives, most of which are polymeric and high molecular weight carbon compounds [15]. Rubbers like styrene-butadiene, isoprene and polybutadiene are mostly used for the commercial manufacturing of tires [16]. The resistance property towards fracture and abrasion of tires through carbon reinforcement is attributed to the carbon black. To strengthen the tires, the rubber fibers are subjected to vulcanization using cross-linking promoters (mainly sulfur) or accelerators at high temperatures to improve the durability, strength and mechanical properties [5,17]. The degradation of rubber materials is crucial in the disposal process with a motive to convert them into useful products [15,17]. The depolymerization of branched long chain carbon molecules in plastics, rubbers and other polymers usually involves thermochemical and hydrothermal routes. Recently, there have been some notable studies on the thermochemical conversion of waste tires to alternative liquid and gaseous fuels through liquefaction [18], pyrolysis [8,19–23] and gasification [24,25]. A two-stage combination of pyrolysis and gasification was performed at 500 °C and 800 °C, respectively for waste tires along with tire elastomers (i.e. natural rubber, butadiene rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber) in the presence of Ni-Mg-Al catalysts [24]. They reported highest yields of H2 with lowest coke deposition from butadiene rubber. The role of gasifying agent such as air + CO2, air + steam and steam alone was studied during the breakdown of waste tires at high temperatures (720 °C to 820 °C) in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor [26]. The results conveyed that the implementation of steam as a gasifying agent can result in high yields of hydrogen with the heating value of the gas product approaching 15.2 MJ/Nm3. Steam gasification of waste tires was performed to produce high-quality syngas (nearly 86 wt%) at 850 °C to 1000 °C with H2 yield of 1.12 m3/kg [27]. Kandasamy and Gökalp [28] attempted scrap tire as a valuable energy source to generate fuels and energy through thermochemical processes such as combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. They found that scrap tire was completely gasified at 950 °C with H2, CO and CO2 as the major products. Syngas obtained from gasification of waste tires was technically assessed to generate electricity using an internal combustion engine and turbine, which resulted in about 7.67 MJ and 6.06 MJ of electricity, respectively [29]. Hydrothermal gasification in subcritical and supercritical water is a promising technology for H2 production from a wide variety of complex organic compounds and waste biomass due to the use of water as a green solvent and reactant [30–34]. Thermodynamic critical temperature and pressure of water are 374 °C and 22.1 MPa. Subcritical state is determined at temperatures ≤ 374 °C and pressures enough to maintain liquid state i.e. ≤ 22.1 MPa. The operating conditions greater than the thermodynamic critical point of water define the supercritical state of water (temperature > 374 °C and pressure > 22.1 MPa). The remarkable transformation of thermophysical properties of water from liquid state to supercritical state allows it to dissolve the organic matter to permanent gases overcoming the mass transfer limitations during the degradation process [35–37]. The density, viscosity and diffusivity of supercritical water (SCW) approach to that of gas revealing the fluid-like behavior beyond the critical point [38]. Beyond the critical point at low densities, free radicals of water are generated. These free radicals are highly reactive and helps in efficient degradation of organic matter happening through free radical mechanism [30,39,40]. In addition, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) does not demand extra energy to dry the biomass to remove the moisture content unlike other thermochemical processes because the medium of gasification is water [41–43]. Moreover, the non-polar nature of SCW allows the dissolution of non-polar compounds (e.g. plastics, rubber and tires) and could facilitate the free radicals to hydrothermally crack the polymeric compounds. The direct nucleophile attack on to the polymer chain at supercritical conditions could also result in near-complete conversion of scrap tires by inhibiting the formation of tar and char [2]. Hydrothermal gasification could be an environmentally friendly technology for the conversion of waste tires to combustible syngas. However, to the known extent, there is no available report in the literature on the gasification of waste tires in aqueous medium. With this objective, the current work is focused on the catalytic gasification of waste tires in subcritical and supercritical water for hydrogen-rich fuel gas production. The impacts of key operating parameters of hydrothermal gasification such as temperature, reaction time and feed concentration have been thoroughly studied and optimized to maximize gas yields along with conversion efficiencies. This research work explored the opportunity to apply different hydroxide catalysts [e.g. Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2] for the degradation of waste tires at supercritical conditions. Furthermore, the transition metal catalysts (e.g. Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3) were applied in the hydrothermal gasification to promote both decomposition and reforming reactions of waste tires and examined their influence on the gas yields."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Waste tires and catalysts,"2.1 Waste tires and catalysts Scrap tires were collected from a local municipal solid waste material recovery facility in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The waste tires were cleaned properly using a metal brush to remove any traces of earthy particles (e.g. soil, sand or silt) to prevent any contamination during the gasification experiments and sample analyses. The waste tires were chopped into small pieces of 10 cm and ground using a Baldor industrial abrasive bench grinder (Model BAL1021WD, Baldor Electric Company, Oakville, ON, Canada) to produce granular tire particles less than 2 mm. The pulverized tire particles were stored in clean glass jars under ambient conditions for use in gasification and physicochemical characterizations. Both homogeneous [Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2] and heterogeneous (Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3) catalysts for hydrothermal gasification were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Oakville, ON, Canada."
3,Hydrothermal gasification set-up,"2.2 Hydrothermal gasification set-up A stainless steel (SS316) tubular batch reactor was employed for hydrothermal gasification of waste tires. The dimensions of the reactor are 25 cm long with an outer diameter of 1.27 cm and inner diameter of 0.95 cm. The schematics of the gasification reactor and its operating procedures are explained elsewhere [44,45]. Along with the tubular batch reactor, the hydrothermal gasification set-up also consisted of SS316-made pressure relief valves, needle valves, check valves, 2-μm filters, pressure gauges, thermocouples and a gas-liquid separator, all of which were procured from Swagelok Central Ontario, Mississauga, ON, Canada. The inert gas nitrogen was initially purged throughout the reactor assembly before the initiation of batch experiments. Moreover, the initial pressure (5 MPa to 10 MPa) required to attaining subcritical and supercritical conditions after heating was supplied by nitrogen. The tubular reactor was located inside an ATS Series 3210 ceramic-insulated split furnace (Applied Test Systems, Butler, PA, USA) whose temperature was controlled by an ATS temperature control system. Temperature inside the reactor was monitored using an Omega Type-K thermocouple (Spectris Canada, Inc., Laval, QC, Canada). With the heating rate of nearly 15 °C/min, the reactor took nearly 20 min to 40 min to heat up to the set temperatures of 325 °C and 625 °C, respectively. After the attainment of the subcritical and supercritical conditions, the reactants (waste tires and water) were allowed to stay inside the reactor for a pre-defined reaction time. The products obtained after hydrothermal gasification were condensed and separated in a gas-liquid separating cylinder into permanent gases and condensed liquids. The solid hydrochar was recovered from the reactor after cooling down to room temperature. The hydrochar was washed with neither deionized water nor any organic solvent. After recovery, the hydrochar was stored in clean and dry glass jars for further physicochemical characterization. The moisture-free gas products from the gas-liquid separating cylinder was collected in Tedlar gas sampling bags (Environmental Sampling Supply, San Leandro, CA, USA). Moisture was removed from the product gases using a desiccant filter (LabClear, Oakland, CA, USA) before analyzing it using gas chromatography. The excess pressure generated during gasification was recorded using pressure sensor from which the final number of moles were calculated. The individual gas moles were calculated based on the final number of moles and the gas composition analysis. The performance of the hydrothermal treatment of waste tires was evaluated using individual gas yields (Eq. 1), total gas yields (Eq. 2), hydrogen selectivity (Eq. 3) and carbon gasification efficiency (Eq. 4) [46]. (1) Individual gas yield mmol / g = Number of individual gas moles collected Gram of feedstock (2) Total gas yield mmol / g = Number of total moles of gas collected Gram of feedstock (3) Hydrogen s electivity % = Moles of H 2 in product gas Moles of other components in product gas mixture × 100 (4) Carbon gasification efficicency % = Number of moles of carbon in product gas Number of moles of carbon in feed × 100"
4,Parametric studies,"2.3 Parametric studies A pre-defined quantity of waste tires with corresponding water was loaded in the tubular batch reactor. Batch experiments were conducted to spot the thermal degradation behavior of waste tires and the effect of process parameters (temperature, reaction time and feed concentration) and catalysts loading on the gas yields, hydrogen selectivity and carbon gasification efficiency. Variable temperatures (325 °C to 625 °C), reaction times (15 min to 60 min) and feed concentrations (5 wt% to 20 wt%) were investigated for hydrothermal gasification of waste tires. Subcritical water gasification was performed at 325 °C under 21 MPa pressure, whereas supercritical water gasification was conducted at 425, 525 and 625 °C over 23 MPa pressure. With the subsequent optimization of the above-mentioned operating parameters, catalysts with 2 wt% loading were employed to enhance the gas yields. Different homogeneous hydroxide catalysts such as Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 as well as heterogeneous transition metal catalysts, e.g. Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3 were employed in hydrothermal gasification of waste tires. Replicate experiments were conducted for each run and the average values of the product gas yields are reported. The uncertainty in the numerical values of reported yields of gases was found to be less than 4%."
5,Gas analysis,"2.4 Gas analysis The gas samples collected from each hydrothermal gasification experiment were quantified using an Agilent Gas Chromatography model 7820A supplied by Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA. Three packed columns along with a capillary column were fitted to the gas chromatography, which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The column temperature was set to 60 °C. Argon was used as the carrier gas. Heavier gases such as CO2, C2H6 and C2+ were separated with an Ultimetal Hayesep T 80/100 column, whereas lighter gases including H2, CO and CH4 were identified using an Ultimetal HayesepQ T 80/100 column. Gases such as N2 and O2 were assayed using an Ultimetal molsieve13 80/100 mesh column. The separated gases were quantified with the aid of Agilent’s OpenLAB CDS ChemStation software. The gas chromatography (Agilent Gas Chromatography model 7820A) used in this study was calibrated to maintain accuracy of the columns and detectors for gas analysis. The standard gas mixture for the calibration of GC was purchased from Linde Canada Ltd (Concord, ON, Canada)."
6,Waste tires and hydrochar characterization,"2.5 Waste tires and hydrochar characterization The proximate analysis of waste tire granules was performed to determine the contents of moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon and ash using the standard ASTM procedures described elsewhere [47,48]. The chemical composition (e.g. carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen) of waste tires and hydrochars generated at 325 °C to 625 °C was determined through ultimate analysis using an Elementar vario EL III CHNOS analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany). The compositions of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen were also used to theoretically estimate the higher heating value (HHV) of waste tires and hydrochars through the modified Dulong’s formula (Eq. 5) [48,49]. (5) H H V ( M J / k g ) = 33.5 × C ( w t % ) 100 + 142.3 × H ( w t % ) 100 - 15.4 × O ( w t % ) 100 The thermal devolatilization patterns of waste tires and hydrochars were studied through the thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermogravimetric (DTA) analyses. The TGA-DTA measurements were performed using a TGA Q500 instrument (TA Instruments-Waters LLC, New Castle, DE, USA). Approximately 10 mg to 15 mg of sample was heated under inert atmosphere (N2 flow rate: 40 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 700 °C. The pattern of weight loss with respect to time and temperature was measured to calculate the differential weight loss. The spectroscopic analysis of waste tires and hydrochars was conducted using a Bruker Alpha Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker Optics Ltd, Milton, ON, Canada). The FTIR transmittance spectra were generated within the wavenumber ranging between 500 cm–1 and 3500 cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1 with an average of 64 scans. The spectra of the samples helped to qualitatively identify the organic functional groups present in waste tires and hydrochars generated during hydrothermal gasification. The surface morphology of waste tires and hydrochars was elucidated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM imaging was achieved through a FEI Quanta 3D FEG DualBeam microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operated under high vacuum mode at 20 kV voltage setting. Waste tires and the hydrochar particles were coated with gold spray by a Denton Desk V Sputter coater (Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ, USA) to facilitate high-resolution imaging and prevent charging of the carbon particles at high voltage electron beam."
7,Compositional analysis of liquid effluents,"2.6 Compositional analysis of liquid effluents The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the liquid effluents collected from hydrothermal gasification of waste tires at variable temperatures (325 °C to 625 °C) was studied to determine the presence and identity of the main aqueous-soluble organic components. NMR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Milton, ON, Canada) equipped with a 5 mm TXI 1H/13C/15N probe operated at 25 °C and 700.28 MHz frequency. The samples were prepared in 10% D2O with a total volume of 0.6 ml and water suppression was completed using excitation sculpting. The NMR spectra were acquired using standard pulse programs, which were further analyzed using TopSpin™ software (version 3.5.b.91). The preparation of samples, standardization of components are described elsewhere [50]. The diffusion experiment was acquired using the pulse program “stebpgp1s19” from the Bruker pulse program library. This experiment used stimulated echo with bipolar gradient pulse, a spoil gradient and water suppression with WATERGATE (WATER suppression by GrAdient Tailored Excitation) solvent suppression method."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Effect of process parameters and catalysts,"3.1 Effect of process parameters and catalysts The pulverized waste tires were gasified in subcritical and supercritical water to investigate their candidacy to produce hydrogen-rich fuel gas. A systematic study was performed by varying the process parameters such as temperature, reaction time and feed concentration to determine the optimum operating conditions for the attainment of highest fuel gas yields. The experiments were performed to optimize one of the operating parameters each time while keeping the other variables (parameters) constant. Initially, the thermal degradation behavior was examined by altering the gasification temperature from subcritical regime (325 °C) to supercritical regime (425 °C to 625 °C) at a leap of 100 °C at constant reaction time of 30 min and feed concentration of 20 wt%. The temperature yielding the highest gas yield with maximum gasification efficiency was chosen for further experiments. The reaction time was varied from 15 min to 60 min to observe the performance of hydrothermal gasification. Taking the gas yields into account, the reaction time leading to high gas yields was preferred for optimizing the feed concentration (waste tires-to-water ratio). The optimal temperature and optimal reaction time were kept constant to study the effects of feed concentration from 5 wt% to 20 wt%. Finally, all the optimal process parameters were selected to investigate the influence of different catalysts on maximizing H2 yields from waste tires gasification. 3.1.1 Effects of temperature Upon analysis, the product gas mixture revealed the components such as H2, CO, CH4, CO2, C2H6 and C2+ hydrocarbons. Fig. 1 represents the variation of gas yields from the gasification of waste tires with the shift in temperatures (325 °C to 625 °C) from subcritical to supercritical range. The distribution of gas components mainly depends on the operating temperature indicating the efficiency of the process. For all reaction temperatures tested, all the individual components in the product gas mixture increased with the rise in temperatures. The total gas yields demonstrated nearly four-fold increase from 7.3 mmol/g to 27.2 mmol/g with the rise in temperature from 325 °C to 625 °C (Table 1 ). The feeble exothermic water-gas shift reaction also accelerated at higher temperature enhancing both CO2 and H2 yields as shown in Eq. (6) [35]. Water-gas shift reaction: (6) C O + H 2 O → C O 2 + H 2 At subcritical temperature of 325 °C, low yields of H2 (2.1 mmol/g) and CO2 (2.25 mmol/g) were obtained (Fig. 1). In contrast, H2 and CO2 yields increased under supercritical conditions attaining maximum yields of 9.3 mmol/g and 7.29 mmol/g, respectively at 625 °C. Likewise, the selectivity of H2 at supercritical temperatures (44.1% to 52%) was higher compared to that at subcritical temperatures (40.7%) (Table 1). The recent research work by Yan et al. [51] on waste tires gasification reflected the positive influence of temperature on H2 selectivity. The degradation of polymeric compounds happens through different reactions in the fluid and solid phases. The degradation reactions of polymeric material of waste tires are endothermic and usually favored at higher temperature [28,28]. It should be mentioned that the reforming reactions, which are predominant at higher temperatures add to the H2 and CO2 yields [35,52]. In addition to the reforming reactions, direct decomposition of waste tires through hydro-pyrolysis also leads to the formation of CO, CO2, H2, hydrocarbons and hydrochar [20]. The rise in temperature has a positive impact on the gas yields at the cost of liquid and hydrochar yields [53]. The solid hydrochar and gaseous hydrocarbons further undergo cracking in the presence of water due to endothermic nature at the operated subcritical and supercritical temperatures, thereby increasing the H2 and CO2 yields. Some of the primary reactions favored at high temperatures are depolymerization and thermal cracking, which breakdown long chain hydrocarbons to short chain products. The reforming, methanation and hydrogenation reactions significantly compete with the decomposition reactions, thereby improving the yield of C2+ hydrocarbons (i.e. ethane, ethylene and acetylene) along with CH4 at higher temperatures. The yields of C2H6 (ethane) and C2+ hydrocarbons improved up to 1.92 mmol/g and 1.24 mmol/g, respectively at 625 °C. The yields of CH4 increased largely reaching from 1.68 mmol/g (at 325 °C) to 6.41 mmol/g (at 625 °C) due to methanation reaction (Fig. 1). Furthermore, slow and steady increments in CO yields were observed from 0.62 mmol/g to 1.04 mmol/g with the respective transition from subcritical (325 °C) to supercritical temperature (625 °C). Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) also followed the increasing trend with temperature. CGE is directly proportional to temperature as suggested by many authors [54–56]. In the current study, CGE increased linearly from 9.5% (at 325 °C) to 32.8% (at 625 °C) (Table 1). Both decomposition and reforming reactions contributed to the gas yields enhancing the gasification efficiency. 3.1.2 Effects of reaction time Reaction times also play a crucial role in the product gas distribution. The experiments were conducted at optimized SCW temperature of 625 °C with a feed (waste tire) concentration of 20 wt% by varying reaction time from 15 min to 60 min. The total gas yields improved from 24 mmol/g to 33 mmol/g with the persisting of reaction time from 15 min to 60 min (Table 1). Furthermore, CGE also showed a similar increasing trend from 29.5% (at 15 min) to 38.7% (at 60 min). The decomposition of polymeric carbonaceous matter in waste tires with residence time resulted in the enhancement of fuel gas yields. Prolonged reaction times are essential for cracking reactions to generate permanent gases [57–59]. For single reaction system, longer reaction times are preferred for the process to attain the equilibrium yields. Longer residence times increase the gas yields at the expense of the degradation of the resulting liquid intermediates [60]. Fig. 2 represents the variation of individual gas yields with reaction time. The hydrocarbons yields of CO, CH4, C2H6 and C2+ enhanced from 0.81, 5.92, 1.64 and 1.05 mmol/g at 15 min to 1.92, 7.4, 2.23 and 1.62 mmol/g, respectively at 60 min. The secondary reforming reactions after the breakdown of the branched polymer chain in chemical structure of waste tires also promoted H2 and CO2 yields at longer reaction times. In particular, at prolonged reaction times of 60 min, nearly 11.7 mmol/g of H2 and 8.1 mmol/g of CO2 yields were noted. Consequently, H2 selectivity also increased from 49.1% at 15 min to 55% at 60 min (Table 1). Carbon yields in the gas mixture are attributed to the cracking of the intermediates of depolymerized rubber material. All the component gas yields tend to increase with reaction time with the predominance of both cracking and reforming reactions [61,62]. 3.1.3 Effects of feed concentration The optimized gasification temperature (625 °C) and reaction time (60 min) were selected to study the effects of feed concentration (5 wt% to 20 wt%), i.e. the proportion of waste tires and water. The total gas yields slightly decreased from 34 mmol/g to 33 mmol/g with the increment in feed concentration from 5 wt% to 20 wt% (Table 1). Feed concentration has a negative impact on the total gas yields of carbonaceous matter in supercritical water [37,63,64]. Fig. 3 represents the variation of product gas yields by altering feed concentration at the optimized temperature and residence time. The yields of CO, CH4, C2H6 and C2+ tend to increase at higher feed concentrations, whereas the yields of CO2 and H2 declined. In particular, CO, CH4, C2H6 and C2+ yields enhanced from 0.63, 5.9, 0.79 and 0.54 mmol/g to 1.92, 7.4, 2.23 and 1.62 mmol/g, respectively. The increase of CO, CH4, C2H6 and C2+ gases at greater feed concentrations is attributed to the cracking and pyrolytic reactions of the intermediate degradation products of waste tires. Moreover, carbonaceous matter undergoes predominant pyrolytic secondary reactions to boost up the hydrocarbon yields along with CO and CH4 at higher feed concentration [65]. The secondary reforming reactions are restrained due to the decrease in water content, which acts as a reactant [66]. A decrement in H2 yield (from 14.4 mmol/g to 11.7 mmol/g) and CO2 yield (from 11.7 mmol/g to 8.1 mmol/g) was observed with the rise in feed concentration from 5 wt% to 20 wt%. The increase in CH4 yields at the expense of H2 is attributed to hydrogenation and methanation reactions at higher feed concentrations [36,44]. The dominance of secondary cracking reactions such as methanation and hydrogenation over reforming reactions at higher feed concentrations also showed a severe impact on H2 selectivity, which reduced from 73.6% (at 5 wt%) to 55% (at 20 wt%) (Table 1). The CGE exhibited a slight increment at 20 wt% feed concentration (38.7%) as opposed to 5 wt% feed concentration (35%). 3.1.4 Effects of catalysts With a motive to enhance the gas yields, hydroxides of alkaline earth metals like Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 with 2 wt% were tested to maximize the gas yields from SCW gasification of waste tires at the optimized operating parameters (temperature: 625 °C, reaction time: 60 min and feed concentration: 5 wt%). Many research efforts were done using metal hydroxide catalysts to enhance gasification of carbonaceous matter [35,38,41,58]. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts accelerate water-gas shift reaction and cracking reactions to promote syngas yields [67–70]. In comparison with non-catalytic gasification at optimal conditions (i.e. 625 °C with 5 wt% of feed concentration and 60 min), significant increase in H2 yields was noticed in the case of catalysts. The H2 yields from waste tires gasification at optimal conditions varied as: no catalysts (14.4 mmol/g) < Mg(OH)2 (15.4 mmol/g) < Ca(OH)2 (16.7 mmol/g) < Ba(OH)2 (16.9 mmol/g) < Ru/Al2O3 (17.9 mmol/g) < Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (19.7 mmol/g) (Fig. 4 ). The promotion of water-gas shift reaction along with reforming of other intermediates also enhanced the H2 selectivity by Ba(OH)2 (99.7%) followed by Ca(OH)2 (94.8%), Mg(OH)2 (83.4%), Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (83.1%) and Ru/Al2O3 (79.9%) (Table 1). On an average basis, the total gas yield from waste tires was slightly higher in the catalytic SCW gasification (37.1 mnmol/g) compared to non-catalytic SCW gasification (34 mmol/g). However, highest total gas yields were obtained from Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (43.4 mmol/g) while the lowest was measured from Ba(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 (33.8 mmol/g). The homogeneous catalysts [e.g. Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2] used to enhance H2 yields also resulted in the capture of CO2 by lowering its yields. The yield of CO2 in non-catalytic SCW gasification of waste tires at optimal conditions was 11.7 mmol/g. In contrast, the yields of CO2 with the use of 2 wt% of Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 were 8.58, 9.14 and 10.63 mmol/g, respectively (Fig. 4). Although Mg(OH)2 has high affinity towards CO2, its carbonates have low thermal stability at the operating conditions, which results in less sequestration [71,72]. The yields of CO2 decreased with the use of catalysts when compared to the non-catalytic gasification reaction. The yield of CO2 was lower because of precipitation and fixation as carbonates in the hydrochar along with other reforming reactions. Moreover, the in situ capture of CO2 with alkaline metal hydroxides [Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2] promotes reforming reactions resulting in high yields of H2. Another significant reason for the lowering of CO2 yields is methanation reaction promoted by transition metal catalysts (Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 and Ru/Al2O3). Methanation of CO2 and CO results in the formation of CH4 as shown in the following reactions (Eq. 7–8). The decrease in CO2 yields is complemented with the gradual increase in CH4 yields [57]. Maximum CH4 yields were obtained from Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (9.14 mmol/g) followed by Ru/Al2O3 (8.65 mmol/g). Methanation reaction for CO2: (7) C O 2 + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O Methanation reaction for CO: (8) C O + 3 H 2 → C H 4 + H 2 O Hydrogenation reaction: (9) C O + 2 H 2 → C H 4 + 0.5 O 2 Nickel catalyzes methanation and hydrogenation reactions with the consumption of CO and evolution of CH4 [57]. Nevertheless, nickel also promotes H2 production at supercritical conditions [73]. The CO yields were almost negligible compared to other gas yields (0.1 mmol/g to 0.34 mmol/g) (Fig. 4). The reduction in CO yields to 0.05 mmol/g and 0.13 mmol/g in the case of Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/SiO2-Al2O3, respectively, indicates the acceleration of C–O and C–C bond scission to promote hydrocarbon yields and methanation reaction [27,35,38,74]. The ability of nickel to cleave C–C, C–O and O–H bonds results in the enhancement of product gas yields [74–76]. Mg(OH)2 has limited solubility in water, but the alkali catalysts, typically, have strong capability for absorbing CO2. This has directed the researchers to opt for alkali catalysts that can absorb CO2, thereby promoting reforming reactions. The limited studies on Mg(OH)2 as a catalyst might be due to its instability rather than catalytic activity. In some recent reports, Mg has been implemented in SCW gasification of biomass either as a support or as promoter to improve the gas yields [77–79]. Magnesium has many basic sites to promote gasification of organic matter at supercritical conditions [80–82]. Furthermore, coke formation can be reduced to a larger extent by the addition of alkali hydroxides such as Mg(OH)2 [83]. Moreover, the acid components (e.g. carboxylic acids, organic acids, etc.) evolving during hydrothermal gasification of biomass are neutralized with the basic alkali catalyst. A decrement in CGE in the case of hydroxide catalysts (30.4% to 32.9%) was observed compared to non-catalytic SCW gasification (35%), Ni-catalyzed SCW gasification (43.4%) and Ru-catalyzed SCW gasification (40.4%) (Table 1). The research investigations with different catalysts (Ni, Cu, Co and Fe) supported on Al2O3 have confirmed the promotion of catalytic reforming during gasification of waste tires to generate high yields of H2 (18.14 mmol/g from Ni) at 900 °C [84]. The research works on catalytic gasification reveals that Ni and Ru are effective for the degradation of the carbonaceous matter in SCW [85,86]. Nickel is also used in reforming of various carbonaceous matters to produce H2 with a potential to reduce tar formation [87,88]. Due to sintering and low thermal stability of pure nickel catalysts, supports are usually employed during hydrothermal gasification [35,89,90]. Al2O3 is found to be the most stable support at supercritical conditions with an advantage of tar cracking [38,91,92]. Based on the reported observations, both Ru/Al2O3 and Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 at 2 wt% catalyst loading was found to be promising to gasify waste tires in SCW. The selection of catalysts for hydrothermal gasification is important with regards to enhancing the gas yields while lowering the process expenditures and maintenance. Homogeneous alkali catalysts are beneficial over heterogeneous catalysts because of their low cost, enhanced conversion rates and ability for use in continuous operations [93]. On the other hand, the bottlenecks associated with heterogeneous catalysts are high costs and steps involved in recovery and reusability. It is also reported that heterogeneous catalysts may deactivate due to sintering and poising during SCW gasification due to reactions with intermediate degradation products [94]. Alkali salts and hydroxides have a tendency to corrode the reactor material at high SCW temperatures, which is a major challenge in large-scale gasification facilities. The ionic products and density of SCW influence the solubility and dissociation of corrosive salts (i.e. homogeneous catalysts) [95]. Therefore, it is important to design effective catalyst supports that are cost effective, rich with functional/active catalytic sites, prevent sintering, coking and poisoning and demonstrate abilities of recovery and reusability both in batch and continuous operations."
10,Characterization of waste tire-derived hydrochars,"3.2 Characterization of waste tire-derived hydrochars The amount of hydrochar recovered from hydrothermal gasification of waste tires was largely dependent on temperature. As shown in Table 2 , the yield of hydrochar decreased with respect to temperature in the following manner: 325 °C (12.6 wt%) > 425 °C (11.2 wt%) > 525 °C (9.4 wt%) > 625 °C (7.1 wt%). This suggests that gasification at higher temperatures results in improved thermal cracking of organic components leading to greater gas yields and reduced hydrochar yields. The proximate analysis revealed that waste tires contained 1.21 wt% moisture, 65.1 wt% volatile matter, 28.8 wt% fixed carbon and 4.9 wt% ash (Table 2). The proximate composition of waste tires used in this study is in accordance with other authors [96–98]. Cui et al. [96] reported that certain varieties of used tires in China contain 3.3 wt% to 3.5 wt% ash, 63.9 wt% to 64.7 wt% volatile matter and 32 wt% to 32.6 wt% fixed carbon. In another study, Dai et al. [97] showed that waste tires contain 0.8 wt% moisture, 3.3 wt% ash, 68.7 wt% volatile matter and 27.2 wt% fixed carbon. Similar observation was also reported by Zhang et al. [98] where waste tires comprised of 0.75 wt% moisture, 4.2 wt% ash, 65 wt% volatile matter and 30.1 wt% fixed carbon. The volatile matter was found to decrease in the hydrochars produced at elevated temperatures, which indicates their conversion to hydrocarbons and gases during hydrothermal gasification. For instance, the volatiles content in Hydrochar-325 °C (57.4 wt%) was higher than that of Hydrochar-625 °C (22.7 wt%) (Table 2). On the contrary, the content of fixed carbon increased in the hydrochars derived at high temperatures, which suggests thermal stabilization of carbon. Hydrochar-625 °C (70.1 wt%) demonstrated higher fixed carbon than Hydrochar-325 °C (36.4 wt%). The composition of organic elements (C, H, N, S and O) in waste tires and its hydrochars generated at 325 °C to 625 °C in 30 min with 20 wt% feed concentration is presented in Table 2. The ultimate analysis indicated waste tires comprised of 67.9 wt% C, 6.6 wt% H, 1.9 wt% N, 1.28 wt% S and 17.4 wt% O. The C content in the hydrochars increased as the temperature elevated with the highest C content in Hydrochar-625 °C (89 wt%) and the lowest in the case of Hydrochar-325 °C (76.3 wt%). On the other hand, the H content decreased as the temperature increased from subcritical conditions to supercritical conditions, which could be related to its devolatilization and formation of gaseous species (e.g. H2, CH4 and C n H m ). Moreover, the concentration of N showed a declining trend from waste tires (1.9 wt%) and Hydrochar-325 °C (1.0 wt%) through Hydrochar-625 °C (0.26 wt%). Unlike N content, S showed an incremental trend in the hydrochars with the utmost levels found in Hydrochar-625 °C. This indicates that the sulfur present in the waste tires retains in the hydrochar during hydrothermal gasification and does not form gaseous species such as SO x . The release of greenhouse gases such as NO x and SO x is usually not noticed in the product gas mixture from hydrothermal processing of waste tires at high temperature and pressure [20]. Zhang et al. [98] demonstrated that waste tires contain 84 wt% C, 6.8 wt% H, 0.78 wt% N and 0.92 wt% S. In another study, Dai et al. [97] revealed that waste tires comprises of 82.8 wt% C, 7.6 wt% H, 0.5 wt% N, 1.3 wt% S and 4.5 wt% O. Based on the atomic H/C and O/C ratios of waste tires and hydrochars, a van Krevelen diagram was plotted (Fig. 5 ). The van Krevelen diagram is an illustrative pictogram to qualitatively estimate the degree of aromaticity and carbon content in carbonaceous materials. From this figure, hydrochars can be seen to exhibit higher heating values than their precursor i.e. waste tires. This was also confirmed from the calorimetric studies (Table 2), which revealed higher calorific value of Hydrochar-625 °C (33.1 MJ/kg) in contrast to Hydrochar-325 °C (30.3 MJ/kg) and waste tires (29.5 MJ/kg). During pyrolysis or gasification, biomass undergoes several reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation and deamination to produce solid char [48,99–101]. However, one of the reactions that becomes predominant at higher temperatures is aromatization of the char, which means the stabilization of C–C carbon structures [102–105]. The thermal degradation profiles of waste tires and hydrochars generated during hydrothermal gasification over the temperature range of 325 to 625 °C are presented in Fig. 6 . The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) clearly indicates that waste tires started degradation at temperatures around 150 °C (Fig. 6a). A major weight loss of nearly 55% from its initial weight occurred at temperatures between 150 °C and 420 °C. This weight loss was attributed to the degradation of polymeric organics in the rubber components of the waste tires. At temperatures beyond 420 °C, a slow degradation of waste tires was noticed until the test runs of 700 °C, which resulted in approximately 10% weight loss. This phase is characteristic to char formation due to secondary reactions. The differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTA) reveals a broad peak over 150 °C to 450 °C (Fig. 6b). The first shoulder peak appearing at 310 °C is due to decomposition of certain volatile components in tires such as stearic acid, additives, accelerators and oils [106]. This phase is followed by the depolymerization and cracking of natural rubber and styrene butadiene rubber present in tires. The overall devolatilization pattern of waste tires through thermogravimetric analysis was evident in two phases, which are (i) depolymerization of rubber and other polymers resulting in gas evolution, and (ii) aromatic char generation. The pattern of weight loss in waste tires is largely dissimilar from that of lignocellulosic feedstocks (agricultural crop residues and woody biomass), which typically shows several stages of devolatilization. These is attributed to the: (i) loss of moisture and volatile matter, (ii) cracking of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, (iii) gas evolution, and (iv) char formation [33,44,107]. The TGA profile of Hydrochar-325 °C resembled some similarities with that of waste tires. The total weight losses of waste tires and Hydrochar-325 °C were nearly 65 wt% and 55 wt%, respectively at 700 °C (Fig. 6a). However, the devolatilization of hydrochars produced in supercritical temperatures (425 °C–625 °C) was quite different than that of the hydrochar generated at subcritical temperature (325 °C) and the precursor material (waste tires). This can be explained by the final weight losses of Hydrochar-425 °C (85 wt%) as well as Hydrochar-525 °C (90 wt%) and Hydrochar-625 °C (90 wt%) at 700 °C. As the hydrochar showed the removal of O–H, C–H, C–O and C–N bonds with respect to temperature, it also helped to develop C–C and C=C bonds due to char aromatization. The formation of the aromatic carbon structures can also render thermal stability and recalcitrance to the hydrochars generated at higher temperatures [108]. The removal of the components from the char at elevated temperatures also resulted in significant structural deformation and loss of integrity as can be seen in SEM images (Fig. 7 ). The surface of waste tires transitioned from having an intact surface morphology to demonstrating a highly fragmented, wrecked and porous structure in the hydrochars. While the Hydrochar-325 °C retained some aesthetic features from its original precursor (waste tire), the Hydrochar-625 °C exhibited a largely disoriented topography because of hydrothermal treatment at high-temperature and high-pressure. The hydrochar generated from waste tires at subcritical temperatures (Hydrochar-325 °C) revealed the growth of carbon microspheres because of hydrothermal treatment. These carbon microspheres appeared spherical and dispersed. However, these carbon microspheres agglomerated into large macrospheres in Hydrochar-425 °C and gradually started to develop pores. Bai et al. [46] have discussed the mechanisms for the formation of carbon microspheres in the char residues generated from waste plastics during SCW gasification. The low devolatilization of hydrochars generated in SCW gasification could find applications in composites or reuse as carbon black for preparation of new tires creating new opportunities for ecofriendly recycling and conversion of waste tires. The FTIR spectra of waste tires and its hydrochars treated over variable temperatures (325 °C to 625 °C) and variable reaction times (15 min to 60 min) are shown in Fig. 8 . The peaks between 800 cm–1 and 1650 cm–1 (i.e. 1367, 1431, 1539 and 1635 cm–1) are related to the transmittance bands of elastomeric components in tires [106,109]. The peak at 692 cm–1 is due to the presence of sulfur components (–C–S–) in tires. The transmittance peaks appearing at 872 cm–1 (Si–O) and 958 (–C–C–) cm–1 are respectively assigned to SiO2 and carbon black present in tires. The carbon black peak initially appearing in waste tires intensified in the hydrochars generated at higher temperatures of 625 °C (Fig. 8a) and at longer reaction times of 60 min (Fig. 8b). This was due to the aromatization of char generated at higher temperatures and longer reaction times in supercritical conditions. This observation qualitatively complements the ultimate analysis (Table 2), which showed higher carbon content in waste tire-derived hydrochars at 425 °C to 625 °C. The FTIR peaks appearing at 1367 cm–1 and 1431 cm–1 are attributed to methyl (−CH3) as well as vinylic (–RC = CH2) and methylene (−CH2–) groups, respectively [109]. The methylene group at 1431 cm–1 became more intense in the hydrochars appearing as the backbone of waste tires, whereas the methyl groups (1367 cm–1) gradually disappeared in the hydrochar generated at 525 °C to 625 °C (Fig. 8a) and at longer reaction times of 15 min to 60 min (Fig. 8b). Colom et al. [109] reported similar observations in the waste tires and the residues obtained after microwave treatment. The peak at 2353 cm–1 was due to the occurrence of nitriles (C–N). However, the nitrile peak was more pronounced in the hydrochars generated at 525 °C to 625 °C. The alkane (C–H) peaks between 2847 cm–1 and 2947 cm–1 were initially present in the waste tires and low-temperature hydrochars (325 °C and 425 °C) [110], whereas their intensity diminished in high-temperature hydrochars (525 °C and 625 °C) and in longer reaction times. These findings are in agreement with the thermogravimetric analysis of waste tires and its derived hydrochars as previously discussed."
11,Characterization of waste-tire derived liquid effluents,"3.3 Characterization of waste-tire derived liquid effluents The liquid effluents obtained from hydrothermal gasification of waste tires at 325 °C to 625 °C with 20 wt% feed concentration for 30 min of reaction time were characterized through NMR to identify the presence of chemical derivatives, intermediates and hydrocarbons. The NMR spectra were acquired with solvent suppression to reduce the intensity of the water resonance. To identify the main components in each sample, typical 2D experiments such as 1H–1H COSY (COrrelated SpectroscopY), 1H–1H TOCSY (TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY), 1H–13C HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) and 1H–13C HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation) spectroscopy were acquired. In addition, a 1H–13C HSQC-DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer) experiment was acquired to assist with the identification of −CH, −CH2 and −CH3 correlations as shown in Fig. 9 . The spectrum for Effluent-325 °C (liquid effluent obtained at 325 °C with 20 wt% feed concentration in 30 min) shows several intense methylene correlations between 1.5 ppm and 3.2 ppm as well as 22 ppm and 42 ppm in the 1H and 13C domains, respectively (Fig. 9). Dehydrogenation is a key reaction during SCW gasification of organic matter [111]. Rubber materials usually have methyl and methylene groups as identified in the FTIR spectra of waste tires at wavelengths 1367 and 1431 cm–1 in the current study. Free radicals promote the dehydrogenation reaction due to which gas yields are increased at high temperature resulting in the release of methylene structures from tire materials (e.g., rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber etc.). With the assistance of the other NMR experiments, the major components were identified as phenol, ethylene glycol, methylamine, methanol, acetone, cyclopentanone and resonances resembling a caprolactam-like structure. These resonances were identified in the 1D spectrum of Effluent-625 °C as shown in Fig. 10 . Since caprolactam may be monomeric or a polymer in solution, a diffusion experiment was completed to assist in the approximate molecular weight. By comparing the diffusion coefficient to the other identified components in the solution, the caprolactam-like molecule was identified as monomeric. A comparison of the relative amounts of all identified compounds was completed using phenol in Effluent-325 °C as the reference. After accounting for the number of protons representing each resonance, the relative values of the identified chemical components in the waste tire-derived liquid effluents are summarized in Table 3 . The relative amounts for phenol, acetone, methanol, cyclopentanone and caprolactam indicated an increase in the concentration in the progressive order of Effluent-325 °C < Effluent-525 °C < Effluent-625 °C. However, methylamine and ethylene glycol were slightly more concentrated in Effluent-525 °C. Overall, ethylene glycol had the lowest concentration of the molecules identified while the monomeric caprolactam-like molecule had the highest concentration. These chemical derivatives present in the liquid effluents from hydrothermal gasification of waste tires could be recovered for use as base chemical precursors or fine chemicals for industrially relevant commercial applications."
12,Conclusions,"Hydrothermal gasification was implemented as a waste-to-energy approach to transform carbonaceous waste tires into syngas. The current research work targets to convert waste tires into gaseous fuels through hydrothermal gasification in subcritical and supercritical water. The operating parameters such as temperature (325 °C to 625 °C), reaction time (15 min to 60 min) and feed concentration (5 wt% to 20 wt%) were varied to study their impacts on the gasification efficiency of waste tires and resulting gas yields. The parametric optimization results conveyed that high temperature (625 °C) led to maximum H2 (14.4 mmol/g) and total gas yields (34 mmol/g) at lowest feed concentration of 5 wt% and longer reaction time of 60 min. Alkaline earth metal hydroxide catalysts, e.g. Ba(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 promoted H2 yields via water-gas shift reaction. Furthermore, these hydroxide catalysts demonstrated a high potential to absorb the evolved CO2 during hydrothermal gasification. The reforming reactions during catalytic SCW gasification also became predominant, thereby enhancing H2 gas yields and selectivity with Ba(OH)2 revealing up to 99% of H2 selectivity. The trend for H2 yields from waste tires through the application of catalysts was Mg(OH)2 (15.4 mmol/g) < Ca(OH)2 (16.7 mmol/g) < Ba(OH)2 (16.9 mmol/g) < Ru/Al2O3 (17.9 mmol/g) < Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 (19.7 mmol/g). Moreover, Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 also resulted in highest yields of CH4 (9.14 mmol/g) through the enhancement of methanation and hydrogenation reactions. The hydrochars also showed the development of thermally stable aromatic carbon microspheres due to hydrothermal treatment in SCW, which could be used in value-added material applications. The liquid effluents obtained from SCW gasification of waste tires also contained phenols, alcohols, acids, hydrocarbons and other derivatives suggesting their recovery as fine chemicals and solvents. The overall findings suggest that waste tires can be effectively gasified to produce H2 enriched fuel gas and other relevant materials with promising industrial applications."
