0,Introduction,"Global environmental issues caused by increasing fossil fuel consumption have highlighted the need to develop sustainable technologies that are competitive to conventional methods for energy and chemicals (Staffell et al., 2019)(Moogi et al., 2021). Biowastes, such as food wastes, agricultural wastes, and municipal solid wastes, have been recognized as sustainable energy resources to produce energy and chemicals via thermo-chemical conversion processes. Indeed, 1.3 billion tonnes of food waste are generated annually worldwide (Principato et al., 2018), and 624-635million tons of food waste are generated annually in South Korea (Xiong et al., 2020). Landfilling and incineration have generally been used for food waste treatment because these methods are easily applicable. As a result, an enormous amount of CO2 has been released into the atmosphere, which is a severe threat to the environment. Gasification or pyrolysis processes of food waste to energy and chemicals might be a promising way for sustainable energy and chemical production, as well as excellent food waste management. Therefore, the production of hydrogen-rich fuel from food waste could facilitate the bio-based economy of the world (Duman et al., 2018). Although nickel-based catalysts have been studied for the biomass gasification to produce hydrogen, the deactivation of Ni-based catalysts by carbon deposition is still a challenge (Albertazzi et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2019). This issue should be solved to upscale or commercialize the steam gasification process of food waste or other biomass resources. The addition of basic oxides has been studied as a means to reduce coke formation over catalysts. Su et al. (2020) used La2O3 to suppress coke formation during food waste gasification. In another study, the amount of coke formed from Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was larger than that formed from the Pt/CexZr1−xO2/Al2O3 catalyst because a basic metal oxide (CeO2) blocked the Lewis acid sites of Al2O3, which are favorite sites for carbon formation. They concluded that basicity played a crucial role in converting toluene to a hydrogen-rich gas (de Castro et al., 2016). Nickel catalysts supported on La2O3, La2O3/CeO2, and Ca-hexa-aluminates showed stable activity due to enhancement of nickel dispersion by basic oxides. Furthermore, the acid sites of Al2O3 were neutralized by La2O3, CeO2, and CaO and suppressed coke formation (Quitete et al., 2014). Coke formation on cobalt-based steam gasification catalysts was suppressed significantly using the basic oxide supports, such as MgO (Moogi et al., 2020c), MgO–La2O3 (Surendar et al., 2017), and MgO–La2O3SrO(Padmakar et al., 2020). In biomass steam gasification processes, the use of mesoporous Ni/SBA-15 catalysts, which had a higher surface area, is another approach to minimize coke formation. On the other hand, the addition of La2O3 and CeO2 on Ni/SBA-15 showed much better performance to suppress coke formation (Moogi et al., 2020b). In addition, the use of structural catalysts, such as perovskites (Surendar et al., 2016), spinel (Dou et al., 2014), and nickel-phyllosilicate (Moogi et al., 2019), on the steam gasification of biomass (ethanol and glycerol) could be another important strategy to overcome catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition and metal sintering. In addition, some novel synthesis methods, such as sol-gel (Zhu et al., 2020) and triblock copolymer synthesis methods, were also adopted to prepare a stable and efficient steam gasification catalyst (Ashok et al., 2020). On the other hand, these methods include multiple steps and require special structure-directing agents. As a result, these catalysts produced by using the above methods might be expensive. Therefore, nickel-based catalysts prepared by the solvent deficient method have recently been applied to produce hydrogen from furniture waste (Farooq et al., 2021b) and waste plastics (Farooq et al., 2021a). In addition, the co-precipitation method is also simple and inexpensive to prepare catalysts for catalytic steam gasification on a large scale (Li et al., 2011)(Kumagai et al., 2015) (Xie et al., 2018)(Yao et al., 2018). Recently, Valizadeh et al. (2021) applied homo and eggshell type Ni/Al2O3 catalysts to hydrogen production from food waste using steam and air gasification methods. They explained that the high hydrogen yield of the eggshell-type catalyst was caused by the high dispersion of nickel. On the other hand, the low hydrogen yield of the homo-type catalyst was due to the homogeneous distribution of nickel through the bulk structure. Singh et al. (2020) suggested that the highest yield of syngas could be produced from food waste at a reaction temperature of 800 °C and the steam flow rate of 0.5 mL. In another study, the blending of food waste with other biomass resources in a gasification process enhanced the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion and produced quality syngas from coal (Chen et al., 2017). Recently, Hayashi et al. (2000) concluded that CaO enhanced the cracking of tar components, such as carboxylic groups, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and other components, and increased the H2 yield. Moreover, the sorption of CO2 by CaO capture will accelerate the water gas shift reaction and increase the hydrogen yield. CaO could also suppress coke formation (Sikarwar et al., 2016). The addition of CaO to the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst promoted nickel oxide reduction at a lower temperature and suppressed the acid sites of the catalyst significantly (Lanre et al., 2020). Finally, coke formation on nickel catalysts was suppressed (Nichele et al., 2014). CaO is applied widely to the sorption enhanced steam gasification of various biomass feedstock because of its capacity to absorb CO2, which can produce a high-quality hydrogen-rich gas. In addition to CaO, various basic oxides retard the sintering and pore blockage of the gasification catalyst (Wu et al., 2018). Li et al. (2011) suggested that the Ni–MgO–Al2O3 hydrotalcite type catalyst is the best to achieve a good hydrogen yield in the steam gasification of tar because MgO increases the dispersion of Ni and stabilizes the catalyst against coke formation. The promotional effect of basic oxides on the performance of a nickel alumina catalyst in the dry reforming of methane has been studied widely (Al-Fatesh et al., 2020; Aziz et al., 2020; Lanre et al., 2020). On the other hand, there have been no such studies on biomass steam gasification, particularly hydrogen production from food waste. This study examined the effects of basic oxides on the catalytic activity of the metallic Ni supported on alumina in the catalytic steam gasification of food waste. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on utilizing basic metal oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) in nickel-alumina catalysts in the catalytic steam gasification of food waste to generate hydrogen-rich gas. All the nickel-alumina catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)."
1,Experimental,
2,Food waste,"2.1 Food waste The feedstock used for steam gasification was obtained from a regional company which collected food waste from the Incheon city, Korea. Before the steam gasification experiments, the moisture from the food waste was removed by drying in an oven at 110 °C for 12 h. The ultimate and proximate analyses were carried out to determine the composition of food waste. The ultimate results based on dry-ash free showed that the food waste consisting mainly of C (45.9%), H (7.0%), N (4.6%), O (41.9%), and S (0.6%), while the proximate analysis results conveyed that food waste is rich in volatile matter (80.5%), followed by ash (11.9%) and fixed carbon (6.8%) and moisture (0.7%)."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation All the nickel-based catalysts used in the present study were prepared using the co-precipitation method. Briefly, for the preparation of 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, nickel nitrate hexahydrate and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate precursors were dissolved in distilled water and stirred for 1 h. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, strontium nitrate, and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Waterman filter papers and pH papers were also obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The resulting solution was precipitated using a 5 vol% NH4OH solution. During precipitation, the pH of the solution was maintained at 10. Later, the solution was filtrated, and the solid mass obtained was washed with distilled water until the pH of the solution reached 7. Subsequently, the solid mass that existed in the hydroxide form was dried at 110 °C (12 h) and calcined (650 °C, 5 h) in a muffle furnace. Finally, the catalyst was reduced (650 °C, 5 h) under hydrogen gas (flow rate, 100 mL/min). In order to achieve the homogeneous dispersion of nickel particles over the Al2O3 support, reduction of the catalysts was carried at 650 °C. A similar procedure was applied to prepare basic oxide-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts (10 wt% MgO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 10 wt% CaO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 10 wt% SrO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3) by co-precipitating an aqueous solution of the corresponding metal nitrates precursors. Hereafter, the 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 10 wt% MgO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 10 wt% CaO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3, 10 wt% SrO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalysts are denoted as NA, NMA, NCA, and NSA, respectively."
4,Characterization of catalysts,"2.3 Characterization of catalysts Powder XRD (Rigaku) was performed using Cu Kα radiation from 10 to 80° 2θ with a scanning rate of 5°/min. The particle size of the catalysts was calculated from XRD peak (44.4) by using Scherrer equation, D p = 0.94 λ β c o s θ ; where D p is the crystal size, λ is the wavelength of X-ray, θ is the Braggs angle in radians, and β is the full width at half maximum of the peak in radians. H2-TPR and NH3-TPD experiments were performed on an Auto Chem II 2920 (Micrometrics, USA) instrument setup with a TCD detector. Before temperature-programmed reduction, each catalyst was degasified by pre-heating the samples at 200 °C(2 h) under an inert gas flow. The reduction behavior of the catalysts was investigated by increasing the sample temperature from 100 to 800 °C at 10 °C/min using the mixture gas (10% H2 in argon). Finally, the degree of the reduction of the catalysts were calculated as the ratio between the hydrogen consumption (mmol/g) from H2-TPR and theoretical hydrogen consumption multiplied with 100. Before NH3-TPD analysis, each catalyst was degasified at 300 °C (1 h). NH3 adsorption was then performed at 50 °C. Subsequently, the quantity of NH3 ammonia desorbed from the catalyst surface was measured and quantified using a TCD detector. The surface morphology and composition of the catalysts were determined by SEM-EDS."
5,Steam gasification of food waste,"2.4 Steam gasification of food waste Catalytic steam gasification experiments were performed in ex-situ mode using quartz reactors with the configuration shown in Fig. 1 . The experimental apparatus consisted of two reactors: one for biomass gasification (U-shape reactor) and the other for catalytic reaction (straight cylindrical tube). Steam as a gasification agent was injected into the biomass gasification reactor connected to the catalyst reactor. The steam line and catalyst reactors were placed in a fixed type furnace, while the biomass reactor was heated using a movable furnace (F1). The steam line was connected to the water pump and N2, and the catalyst reactor was connected to a condenser. In each experiment, 5 g of perfectly dried food waste was loaded in the U-shape reactor. In catalytic experiments, 0.5 g of catalyst was loaded in the middle between the two quartz wool beds. During heating to the reaction temperatures, only N2 gas (50 mL/min) was injected into this experimental apparatus. The temperature of the catalyst reactor could be maintained at the reaction temperature because the catalyst reactor was placed in the fixed furnace (F2). The furnace F1 was kept away from the biomass reactor to prevent pre-gasification. Once the temperature of the furnaces (F1 and F2) stabilized at 800 °C, furnace F1 was slid carefully over the biomass reactor (U-Shape), and steam injected simultaneously by a micro-syringe was carried into the biomass reactor. Immediately, the gasified products of the food waste and unreacted steam were passed through the catalyst bed placed in the middle of the catalyst reactor. Finally, syngas from this catalytic steam gasifier entered the condenser, in which syngas had been separated into a liquid called a bio-oil and gas. Bio-oil was collected in mass cylinders connected at the bottom condenser. The differential masses before and after experiments in biomass reactor (U-type), catalyst, and condensers were defined as char, coke, bio-oil, respectively. The char, coke, and bio-oil yields were calculated by dividing the initial food waste weight into each weight measured in the experiments. The missing weight fraction was considered as gas product. The gas collected in a Tedlar bag was immediately analyzed by GC (YL 6100) equipped with a TCD and FID. The detailed operating parameters of Gas Chromatographs were provided as the supplementary data (Table S1). The quantitative analysis of gas was conducted using 5 – point linear calibration curves of standard gas analysis using GC-TCD/FID. The composition of the oil was determined by GC/MS, and the detailed analysis procedure can be found elsewhere (Moogi et al., 2020a)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,X-ray diffraction,"3.1 X-ray diffraction Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the freshly reduced catalysts. All the catalysts showed similar XRD patterns, regardless of the basic oxide (MgO, CaO, and SrO) in the Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The XRD peaks obtained at 37.4, 39.7, and 67.3° 2θ (a black dashed line, JCPDS 00-004-0880) were assigned to γ-Al2O3(Hassani Rad et al., 2016). No NiO peaks were observed in the XRD patterns of the catalysts, but XRD peaks for Ni (44.5 and 52.2° 2θ, JCPDS 01-073-1519) were observed in all the catalysts suggesting the reduction of nickel oxide to Ni. On the other hand, XRD of Ni/Al2O3 showed no NiAlxOy phase (Hao et al., 2009) (green dashed line) along with Ni and Al2O3 phases, indicating the incomplete reduction of the nickel aluminate phase (NiAlxOy phase) formed by the strong interaction between NiO and Al2O3. Furthermore, compared to the basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed low-intensity peaks for Ni (44.5 and 52.2° 2θ), substantiating the incomplete reduction of NiAlxOy phase in the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The crystal size of nickel (49.2 nm) in Ni/Al2O3 was dropped to 30.4, 25.5, and 10.9 nm respectively with MgO, CaO, SrO promotion to Ni/Al2O3. On the other hand, Ni was observed in the basic oxide-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts highlighting the enhanced reduction of NiAlxOy phase by the basic oxides. Therefore, the basic oxide promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts showed a low-intensity NiAlxOy peak indicating a smaller interaction between NiO and Al2O3. This can be well understood from the H2-TPR experiments in the subsequent section (Sec. 3.2)."
8,H2 –temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),"3.2 H2 –temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) Fig. 3 presents the H2-TPR profiles of all calcined nickel catalysts. Each catalyst showed very small peaks in the range of 400–600 °C, and a major reduction peak after 600 °C, which are typically assigned to surface nickel oxide (NiO) and non-stoichiometric nickel-aluminate (NiAlxOy), respectively. The basic metal oxides (MgO, CaO, SrO) affected the reduction behavior of nickel-aluminate and shifted its reduction peak maxima to lower temperatures, indicating nickel-aluminate reduction to nickel. This observation is in line with previous studies that confirmed that the basic metal oxides, such as MgO (Koo et al., 2008) and CaO (Choong et al., 2011), could suppress the formation of the NiAlxOy phase. The added basic oxides minimized the nickel oxide interaction with Al2O3. As a result, the NiAlxOy reduction temperature was shifted to a lower temperature. Furthermore, the hydrogen consumptions of the catalysts; NA (0.66 mmol/g), NMA (0.99 mmol/g), NCA (1.25 mmol/g), NSA (1.55 mmol/g) confirmed that the reduction of nickel-aluminate phase was enhanced by the basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO). The increasing order of the degree of the catalyst reduction was as follows: NA (38.9%) < NMA (58.1%) < NCA (73.6%) < NSA (91.3%). Among the basic oxides considered in this study, SrO promoted the reduction of nickel species at relatively lower temperatures."
9,NH3-temperature programmed desorption,"3.3 NH3-temperature programmed desorption As shown in Fig. 4 , each catalyst exhibited two ammonia desorption peaks, whose peak maxima were located at ∼150 °C and ∼450 °C. These peaks represented the desorption of ammonia interacting with the weak and medium acidic sites present in the catalysts. The quantity of ammonia (mmol/g) measured (Table 1 ) suggested that the addition of basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) decreased the number of acid sites. The trend of the catalyst with respect to the total acidity measured in mmol/g is as follows: NA (1.24) > NMA (1.06) > NCA (0.87) > NSA (0.75). This suggests that the basic oxide promoters suppressed both weak and medium acidic sites of the NA catalysts. The general basic behavior of the alkaline earth metal oxides was MgO < CaO < SrO. Therefore, among the catalysts studied, the NSA (10 wt% Ni/10 wt% SrO–Al2O3) catalyst loaded with SrO had the lowest number of acid sites, which appears to be a critical factor in suppressing coke formation during the steam gasification of food waste."
10,Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy,"3.4 Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy The SEM images show that the crystal size of the catalysts decreased significantly with the addition of basic metal oxides (Fig. 5 ). The EDS data in Table 1 showed that the amount of nickel on the surface was increased by the basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO). As SEM-EDS analysis was carried on the reduced catalyst samples, the higher surface nickel on the basic oxide-promoted catalysts was due to the enhanced nickel aluminate reduction to metallic nickel promoted by the basic oxides. A tiny amount of nickel was detected on the surface of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst because the nickel-aluminate phase was reduced incompletely. These results are in good agreement with the H2-TPR and XRD results. The high-temperature reduction profiles (sec 3.2. H2-TPR), sharp NiAlxOy XRD peaks (Sec. 3.1 XRD), larger crystals of (SEM), and low surface nickel (EDS) strongly suggest that most of the nickel oxide was engaged in the formation of bulk nickel-aluminate crystals in the non-promoted 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, during the hydrogen-reduction process, 10 wt% SrO-10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst generated the small nickel crystals (10.9 nm), on the other hand, the 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 generated larger nickel crystals (49.2 nm). Therefore, the average crystal size data from XRD is well confirmed that the basic oxides could decrease the average crystal size of a nickel."
11,Steam gasification results,"3.5 Steam gasification results Fig. 6 shows the mass balance of food waste in the catalytic steam gasifier. Similar char contents were observed in non-catalytic and catalytic experiments because of ex-situ steam catalytic gasification experiments. The syngas generated in the biomass gasification reactor was entered directly into the catalytic gasification reactor. In the catalyst reactor, the syngas from the biomass reactor was further cracked into lower hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. Therefore, the total gas yield increased significantly depending on the gasification efficiencies of the catalysts. The yield of bio-oil (40.5 wt%) in the non-catalytic steam gasification was significantly higher than that in catalytic steam gasification (∼19.9 wt%). The lowest gas yield (45.9 wt%) was obtained in the non-catalytic steam gasification experiment. The gas yield was increased by 17 wt% in the catalytic steam gasification of food waste on the nickel-alumina catalyst. A further increase in the gas yield occurred when the basic oxide-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were used in the steam gasification of food waste. The gas yield of given catalysts was in the following order: NA (57.8 wt%) < NMA (61.7 wt%) < NCA (62.8 wt%)< NSA (66.0 wt%). This order is the exact reverse of the acidity of the catalysts. The highest gas yield was found on the 10 wt% SrO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The increase in gas yield over the basic oxide-promoted nickel alumina catalysts can be attributed to the enhanced tar cracking capacity of the nickel catalyst to a gaseous product. A similar observation was found in the catalytic cracking of kerosene over the Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of a basic oxide promoter, such as BaO and SrO, increased the gas yield because tar components were cracked into a gas (Koo et al., 2008). Furthermore, the increased basicity of MgO, CaO, and SrO suppressed coke deposition during the steam gasification of food waste. Coke formation during catalytic steam gasification showed the following trend: (6.0 wt%) NA > NMA (3.0 wt%) > NCA (0.6 wt%) > NSA (0.3 wt%). In the non-catalytic experiment, the concentration of hydrogen (38.0 vol% equal to 1.57 wt%) was lower than in the other experiments, and the concentration of C2–C4 hydrocarbons (14.8 vol%) was higher than others (Fig. 7 , Fig. S1). That means that more gaseous products (H2, CH4, CO, and CO2) can be generated by catalytic conversion. As expected, the NA catalyst increased the gas yield and hydrogen concentration (45.0 vol% equal to 2.54 wt %) in the gas. The higher concentration of CO2 on NA catalyst indicates that the combustion reaction was favored over steam gasification. On the other hand, NMA decreased the CO2 concentration. The hydrogen concentration by NMA was 3.6% higher than that produced by the NA. Hence, the nickel catalysts promoted with basic metal oxides appear to facilitate a steam gasification reaction instead of a combustion reaction. Over the basic oxide-promoted catalysts, an increase in H2 and a slight decrease in CO concentration were observed. This could be due to the enhanced water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O → H2+CO2). Liu et al. (2012) suggested that basic oxides, such as like MgO, CaO, and SrO, have a higher hydrogen concentration via the water gas shift reaction. The CO2 concentration decreased successively as the strong basic oxide was added to the nickel-alumina catalyst. Moreover, this trend is exactly the opposite of the trend observed for the acidity of catalysts determined by NH3-TPD (Table 1), meaning the sorption of CO2 on basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO). Furthermore, the sorption enhanced steam gasification concept (Delgado et al., 1997; Doranehgard et al., 2017; Jiao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015) also supports the lower CO2 concentration over the basic oxide-promoted nickel-alumina catalysts. The sorption of CO2 by basic oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) increased the hydrogen concentration in the final product. The lowest CO2 concentration (vol%) over the NSA catalyst might be the combined effects of CO2 sorption followed by the hydrogenation of CO2 absorbed on SrO. As a result, a slight increase in the CH4 concentration was observed. The basic oxides also suppressed coke formation on the nickel-alumina catalysts. The least amount of the coke (0.3 wt%) formation was observed on NSA catalyst. This means that SrO provided sufficient basicity to promote tar cracking to hydrogen. As a result, the least coke formation was observed (Pfeifer et al., 2004). Overall, the highest concentration of hydrogen produced on the NSA catalyst can be attributed to the SrO promotion on the NA catalyst. The addition of SrO helped increase the reducibility of the nickel aluminate phase at low temperatures and produced properly dispersed small nickel particles (10.9 nm) on the Al2O3 surface. In addition, SrO suppressed the acidic sites and minimized coke formation. Generally, the oxygenated components, such as phenols and alcohols, derived from biomass undergo dehydration and condensation on the acid sites of the catalysts that lead to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, which is undesirable in the gasification process (Hu et al., 2020). In the present study, MgO, CaO, and SrO neutralized the acid sites of the catalysts and retarded the dehydration and condensation reactions of the oxygenated compounds (e.g., phenols and alcohols), as described by NH3-TPD (Sec 3.3). Hence, the formation of polyaromantic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was suppressed. Thus, the carbon deposition on the basic oxide promoted nickel-alumina was minimized. Among the basic oxides added, SrO is the most basic. Therefore, it neutralized more acid sites on the NSA catalyst, resulting in the lowest amount of carbon deposited on this catalyst."
12,Chemical composition of bio-oils,"3.6 Chemical composition of bio-oils The chemical composition of bio-oils is shown in Fig. S2. BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), aliphatic hydrocarbons of carbons (>C6), alkyl benzenes, phenols, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS; naphthalenes, indenes, and indoles, etc.) are the main chemicals present in bio-oils. Of course, all chemicals are the main components of the bio-tar. However, these components were previously categorized as secondary and tertiary tar components. According to literature (Shen et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2020), condensation, and cross-coupling of primary tar components (phenols) on acid sites are the main reactions for the formation of secondary and tertiary components, as a result, PAHs content in the bio-oil will be raised. In the present study, Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with more acidic sites produced high PAHs (14.7%), and its content successively dropped for the basic oxides promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (14.5–7.18%). Also, aliphatic hydrocarbons (Alp.HCs) content over the basic oxide promoted catalysts was increased (20.87–30.94%). Therefore, it was confirmed that basic oxide not only suppressed tar formation but also improved the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst cracking capacity of tar. Hence, 10 wt% SrO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest aliphatic hydrocarbons and minimum PAHs. These findings are well supporting the highest gas yield and minimum coke formation over the 10 wt% SrO- 10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst."
13,Conclusion,"Food waste was used for the production of hydrogen-rich gas by the catalytic steam gasification process. Among the catalysts prepared, the non-promoted nickel-alumina catalyst showed the highest number of acid sites (1.24 mmol/g) and produced the highest amount of coke (6.0 wt%). Thus, the lowest amount of hydrogen (38.0 vol%) was produced from the catalytic steam gasification food waste. The addition of basic oxides neutralized the acid sites of the catalysts and minimized coke formation: Least amount of carbon (0.3 wt%) was found in 10 wt% SrO-10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, the basic oxides prevented nickel loss owing to the formation of hardly reducible nickel-aluminate and facilitated the reduction of the nickel aluminate phase at relatively lower temperatures. As a result, the dispersion of nickel on the catalyst surface was enhanced. Owing to higher surface nickel concentration and smaller particle sizes, the SrO-promoted nickel-alumina catalyst produced the highest hydrogen concentration (63.8 vol% equal to 6.7 wt%) in the catalytic steam gasification of food waste. Overall, the hydrogen production efficiency of the nickel alumina catalyst can be improved by SrO promotion."
