0,Introduction,"With the increasing concern of global warming caused by fossil fuels, developing renewable alternative fuels has become urgent to decarbonize the economy (Brandon and Kurban, 2017). Hydrogen is one of the most promising alternative fuels to fossil fuels with various attractive features, such as no carbon emission and high energy content (Hassan et al., 2020b). Compared to conventional hydrogen production methods (e.g. reforming and pyrolysis), hydrogen production via dark fermentation is environment-friendly and cost-effective with various organic wastes as substrate, such as wastewater, food wastes, and agricultural residues (Dahiya et al., 2020). Over the past decades, plenty of novel hydrogen production processes, hydrogen-producing microorganisms, and fermentation reactors have been developed to seek for efficient hydrogen production. However, the low hydrogen yield is still one of the key problems restricting the scale-up of fermentative hydrogen production. The incomplete oxidization of substrate results in the formation of various volatile acids and alcohols, some of which consume the reducing power used for hydrogen production (Baeyens et al., 2020; Hallenbeck, 2009). In recent years, adding fermentation additives to promote the hydrogen yield of dark fermentation has been demonstrated an effective method (Li et al., 2020a; Yang and Wang, 2018; Yin and Wang, 2019). The additives are classified into various categories, such as metal additives, immobilization carriers, augmenting microorganisms, reducing agents and enzymes. These additive categories are rapidly expanding and more effective additives are being developed, such as biochar. Biochar, a porous charred solid produced during the thermochemical conversion of biomass in anoxic atmosphere (Do Minh et al., 2020), has been used in various environmental applications due to its attractive features. Yuan et al. (2018) found that biochar could stimulate methanogenesis by promoting direct interspecies electron transfer between methanogens and anaerobic bacteria with its redox-active properties. In a secondary fermentation of syngas fermentation effluent, Ghysels et al. (2021) showed that porous biochar could retain cells and consequently reduced the lag phase and increased the production rate of caproic acid. Biochar showed mild alkalinity and was used as pH buffer in acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation, and the rich mineral nutrients of biochar were shown to facilitate the cell growth (Sun et al., 2019). In hydrogen production applications, studies showed that the addition of biochar in anaerobic digestion enhanced the hydrogen yield and production rate by 31.0% and 32.5%, respectively (Sunyoto et al., 2016). The promoting effect of biochar on fermentative hydrogen production was also reported in other processes (Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). In our previous study, we studied the effect of biochar on the two dominant fermentation types for hydrogen production, the butyrate-type and ethanol-type fermentations, and found that the promoting effect of biochar was universally applicable (Li et al., 2020c). The possible promoting mechanisms were mainly associated with the physicochemical characteristics of biochar, such as the alkalinity and surface characteristics. The alkalinity of biochar slowed down the decrease of the broth pH, benefiting the hydrogenase activity, cell growth and substrate conversion (Li et al., 2020c; Sun et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the porous structure of biochar facilitated cell attachment and biofilm formation, which could help the cells survive in tough environment (Rezaeitavabe et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019). Biochar was found to be capable of affecting the redox potential, which could change the redox balance in hydrogen-producing bacteria; the rich mineral elements of biochar could also facilitate cell growth (Li et al., 2020c). Considering that these physicochemical characteristics of biochar determine the promoting effect of biochar on fermentative hydrogen production, it is necessary to study the factors affecting these characteristics. Previous studies show that feedstock and pyrolysis temperature are two dominant factors affecting the characteristics of biochar and their influences on the function of biochar have been intensively studied (Gai et al., 2014; Hassan et al., 2020a; Jung et al., 2016; Lian and Xing, 2017). Mandal et al. (2018) found that both feedstock and pyrolysis temperature influenced the mitigation function of biochar on NH3 volatilization in the soil. Biochars prepared at low pyrolysis temperature reduced more NH3 volatilization and poultry manure-derived biochar showed the highest reduction effect among three feedstocks. Another study explored the effect of feedstock type of biochar on the characteristics and functions in energy production and solid amendment, and found that lignocellulosic biomass-derived biochars performed better than those from algae and animal wastes on solid fuel production (Tag et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2019) found the pyrolysis temperature mainly affected the specific surface area (SSA), pH, and zeta potential, and the NH4 + adsorption capacity of biochar was influenced by both temperature and feedstock. These studies demonstrated the important roles of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on various functions of biochar. Only a few studies explored the effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature of biochar on hydrogen production. Wang et al. (2018) compared four kinds of feedstocks at three pyrolysis temperatures in anaerobic digestion of food wastes with sewage sludge (producing plenty of volatile fatty acids, VFA), and found that biochars prepared at high pyrolysis temperature enhanced the productions of hydrogen and concluded that pH buffering capacity was the dominant factor of biochar promoting fermentative hydrogen production. In our previous study, biochar dosage was found an important factor affecting the hydrogen production and substrate utilization, especially for VFA-rich fermentations, such as butyrate-type fermentation (Li et al., 2020c). In VFA-rich fermentations, pH decreased rapidly due to the accumulation of VFAs, such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, so more biochar could neutralize more acid and boost the hydrogen production, and thus pH buffering capacity was the dominant factor of biochar. However, in ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production, VFA production is not as high as in mixed acid fermentation, and pH buffer capacity of biochar might play a less important role compared to mixed acid type fermentation (Li et al., 2020c). Ethanol-type fermentation with ethanol, acetate, H2 and CO2 as the products is one of dominant fermentation types for hydrogen production (Ren et al., 2007). A previous study showed that ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production showed less sensitivity to low pH and kept producing hydrogen at pH <3.0 (Mota et al., 2018). Therefore, the key features determining biochar's promoting effect on ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production may be different from other types of fermentation and remains to be studied. For this reason, this study performed ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production, and compared the promoting effects of biochars with five different feedstocks (coffee grounds (CG), corn stalk (CS), Ginkgo biloba leaf (GL), mealworm frass (MF), and sugarcane bagasse (SB)) and three pyrolysis temperatures (300, 500, and 700 °C) to evaluate the effects of biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. The physicochemical characteristics of biochars prepared at different conditions were determined and the promoting effects on hydrogen production and production rate were measured. The relations of physicochemical characteristics and promotion capability were established, and the underlying promotion mechanisms of biochar were proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strains and media,"2.1 Strains and media Ethanol-type fermentation was carried out in this study with the culture of Ethanoligenens harbinense Yuan-3. E. harbinense was the type strain of ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production with ethanol and acetate as the main liquid-phase products. The seed of E. harbinense Yuan-3 was stored at −80 °C in 15% glycerol in Harbin Institute of Technology (Xing et al., 2006). The EH medium was prepared as described previously with modification of the initial concentration of glucose (Li et al., 2020a). In batch fermentations where biochars of different feedstock types were applied, 10 g/L glucose was added as carbon source, while 15 g/L glucose was used when biochars of different pyrolysis temperatures were used (for better observation of the differences between groups). The medium was autoclaved at 121 °C for 0.5 h after purged with pure nitrogen gas for 15–20 min. The seed strain was cultured in 160-mL serum bottles at 37 °C in an incubator."
3,Biomass wastes and biochar production,"2.2 Biomass wastes and biochar production Different kinds of biomass wastes were used to prepare biochar via slow pyrolysis. Spent coffee grounds were collected from a café and sugarcane bagasse from a sugar factory. Corn stalk and Ginkgo biloba leaves were collected from a farm and forest in Harbin, respectively. The mealworm frass was from a farm of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus. All kinds of biomass were dried at 80 °C and then ground into particles (40 mesh). The characteristics of biomass were shown in Table 1 . To study the effect of feedstock type, five biomasses were heated at 500 °C for 4 h at N2 atmosphere with a pyrolysis heating rate of 5 °C/min in a vacuum tube furnace (Shanghai Micro-X furnace Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The furnace was equipped with a quartz tube (diameter: 50 mm; length: 600 mm). Around 5 g biomass was loaded once for pyrolysis. To study the effect of pyrolysis temperature (the highest treatment temperature in this study), the temperatures were set to 300 °C, 500 °C or 700 °C. These processes were all carried out at an oxygen limited atmosphere with an N2 flow rate of 0.8 L/min and a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Before characterization and addition to the fermentation, biochar was ground into 200 mesh powder and stored in a dry place. The biochar of CG, CS, GL, MF, and SB were named as CGBC, CSBC, GLBC, MFBC and SBBC, respectively. SBBCs prepared at 300 °C, 500 °C and 700 °C were named SBBC300, SBBC500 and SBBC700, respectively."
4,Characterization of biomass wastes and biochar,"2.3 Characterization of biomass wastes and biochar Biochar yield was calculated as the weight ratio of the product and feedstock, as shown in Eq. (1): (1) Yield = W biochar / W feedstock × 100 % Biochar pH was measured by mixing biochar thoroughly with deionized water at 1:10 weight ratio (vibration and equilibration for 2 and 15 min, respectively). Elemental compositions of biomass and biochar, including C, N and H, were determined with Dumas combustion method in an Elementar Analysensysteme (GmbH, Germany). Fermentation broth (5–10 mL) with different biochars were used to analyze the mineral contents with Optima 8300 ICP-AES (PerkinElmer, USA) in State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C in Micromeritics (ASAP 2020 V3.00H, USA). Pore characteristics of biochar was analyzed with BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) model. Sample mass of 0.2–0.4 g and equilibration interval of 10 s were used, and the warm free space and cold free space were ~27 cm3 and ~84 cm3, respectively. Surface morphology of biochar was analyzed with Sigma 500 scanning electron microscopy (Sigma, England) by coating the samples with 2–6 nm silver/gold. Magnifications of 1000–2000× were used to take images of samples. Surface functional groups were measured at 400–4000 cm−1 with potassium bromide as a reference in a FT-IR spectrometer. Biochar samples were well mixed with potassium bromide at a weight ratio of ~1:200 and then the generated mixture was pressed into pellets for FT-IR analysis."
5,Batch fermentations,"2.4 Batch fermentations Batch fermentations were performed to study the effects of biochar on hydrogen production and productivity in 160 mL serum bottles, with 3 g/L biochar added to 50 mL medium. After autoclave, exponential phase E. harbinense (cultivated for ~12 h) was inoculated to the media at a size of 5%. The fermentation was carried out at 37 °C without pH control. Gas and liquid samples were collected periodically until no gas was produced. The gas pressure of the headspace of reactors was adjusted to the atmospheric pressure by transferring the headspace gas into a gas bag at each sampling point."
6,Adsorption of products to biochar,"2.5 Adsorption of products to biochar Adsorption of products to biochar was conducted to study the effect of adsorption on product concentrations. To stimulate the fermentation process, 50 mL pure water containing 3.0 g/L ethanol and 2.0 g/L acetate were treated with 0 or 3 g/L SBBC in serum bottles with butyl rubbers. The serum bottles were placed at 37 °C for 72 h. Samples at 72 h were analyzed with a high-performance liquid chromatography. The pH was not adjusted and pH values of the blank and biochar-added samples at 72 h were measured. All experiments were conducted in triplicate."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods Hydrogen concentration was determined with Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, USA). The GC was equipped with a Porapack Q column and a thermal conductivity detector with nitrogen as the carrier gas. Gas volume was determined with water displacement method in an inverted measuring cylinder. Liquid phase products were analyzed with Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-FFAP column and a flame ionization detector. Glucose concentration was measured with dinitrosalicylic acid (Li et al., 2020b). Hydrogen production kinetics was studied with the modified Gompertz equation as described before (Li et al., 2020c). Coefficients of variation were performed to study the heterogeneity of biochar characteristics and the effects caused by feedstock and pyrolysis temperature (Zhao et al., 2013). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0 to study the relationships of various parameters, such as biochar physicochemical properties (pH, C, H, N, and SSA), hydrogen yield and maximum hydrogen production rate R max. Fermentations in each condition were performed in triplicate. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with GraphPad Prism 9.0, and statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 (Table S1–2)."

9,Characterization of biochars from different biomass wastes,"3.1 Characterization of biochars from different biomass wastes Different kinds of biomass wastes were used to study the effects of feedstock on biochar characteristics and promotion capability. The characteristics of the feedstocks and derived biochars were shown in Table 1. The C contents of the biomass wastes ranged from 38.55% (MF) to 48.82% (CG). The H contents were similar (around 5%), while N contents varied between feedstocks. SB showed the lowest N content (0.33%), while MF presented the highest N content of 3.96%. After slow pyrolysis, the biomass feedstock was transformed into pyrolytic gas, oil, biochar and other products. The yields of biochar were mostly ranged from 29% to 32%, except for SBBC (22.91%). All kinds of biochars showed moderate alkalinity, and the pH values changed with feedstocks. The lowest pH value was 8.38 (SBBC), while the highest pH was 9.91 (CGBC). GLBC showed a pH of 9.40 and the other two biochars exhibited similar pH values around 9.7. After slow pyrolysis, the element compositions changed. As shown in Table 1, the contents of C were significantly increased in all kinds of biochars. The largest increases of C content were found in SBBC and CSBC, and their final C contents were also the highest two. For other biomass wastes, higher pyrolysis temperature was needed to increase the degree of carbonization. The proportion of H decreased in all kinds of biochars, caused by the moisture removal and dehydrogenation (Sun et al., 2014). After pyrolysis, the content of N in CG decreased from 2.43% to 0.94%, while that in CS increased from 0.91% to 2.94%. The N contents in GLBC, MFBC and SBBC remained at the same levels with their feedstocks. The high N contents in MFBC and MF were related to the property of manures. Compared to plant biomass, manure contains plenty of organic and inorganic compounds and manure-derived biochars were rich in nutrients, such as N, P and Mg (discussed later) (Domingues et al., 2017; Tsai et al., 2012). The rich nutrient contents made manure and derived biochars common N fertilizers in soil applications (Clough et al., 2013). Generally, C/H and C/N were increased after pyrolysis, indicating the carbonization of biomass. One-way ANOVA showed that all these parameters were significantly affected by feedstock types. Surface characteristics of the biochars were highly dependent on the feedstock type. SEM images showed that significant differences were present between lignocellulosic biomass and mealworm frass (see Supplementary materials). CSBC and SBBC retained some lignocellulosic structures, such as residual vascular bundle, while MFBC were particles of 60–80 μm. During pyrolysis, plenty of pores were formed with the gasification of volatiles, and the SSA was increased accordingly. SSA and pore characteristics varied significantly with the feedstock (Table 1). The SSAs of five tested biochars followed the order: SBBC > MFBC > GLBC > CSBC > CGBC. SBBC showed the largest SSA of 283.87 m2/g, which was 38 times higher than the lowest (CGBC). The SSA was closely related to pore characteristics, and the pore volumes of five biochars were in the same ranking order as the SSA. The total pore volume (TPV) of CGBC was only 0.0027 cm3/g, while that of SBBC was 0.14 cm3/g. The pore volumes of other three biochars were 0.011–0.037 cm3/g. The average pore width (APW) of CGBC was 0.95 nm, the smallest among these five kinds of biochars. The small width of CGBC pores made them easily plugged up or covered up, resulting in the low SSA of CGBC. The largest APW was found in GLBC (6.50 nm), and those in CSBC and MFBC were 2.92 and 2.49 nm, respectively, belonging to the mesopores (2–50 nm). CGBC and SBBC both showed APW smaller than 2 nm, indicating most of the pores were micropores. High porosity and SSA could provide adhesive sites for hydrogen-producing cells (Li et al., 2020c), endowing SBBC with an advantage for promoting fermentative hydrogen production. Surface functional group composition was another important characteristic of biochar, which would affect the function of biochar (Li et al., 2020c; Zhao et al., 2020). Biochars derived from different kinds of biomass wastes showed different features of surface functional groups at the same pyrolysis temperature (Fig. 1 a). Abundant characteristic peaks with high absorbance were shown in SBBC, GLBC, MFBC and CSBC, while the peaks in CGBC were low in number and absorbance. Aromatic CH (around 874 cm−1) could be detected in all kinds of biochars, while the stretching vibration absorption of aliphatic CH (2950–2850 cm−1) was only visible in SBBC and CSBC. Broad and strong peaks at 1550–1700 cm−1 corresponded to CC and CO bending, suggesting the abundance of aromatic carbon, carboxyl groups and ketone in biochar (Lu et al., 2020). Alcohol/phenol OH stretch (3500–3300 cm−1) showed low absorbances in all kinds of biochars. GLBC, SBBC and CSBC exhibited peaks at around 1413 cm−1, which corresponded to OH bending of phenolic groups. The abundance of phenolic groups was related to the lignin content in these lignocellulosic biomass (Qian et al., 2013). In comparison, MFBC and CGBC showed relatively weak peaks of OH bending. MFBC, GLBC, SBBC and CSBC showed broad and strong peaks around 1150 cm−1, which corresponded to C-O/C-O-C bonds. The differences of functional groups among these biochars might affect the electron transfer between biochar and bacteria (Yuan et al., 2017), resulting in different promoting effects on fermentative hydrogen production. Biochar could release mineral nutrients into the fermentation system, which was advantageous for the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria. The main different metal ions in fermentation broth treated with five biochars were shown in Fig. 1b, including Ca, K, Mg and P. Fermentation broth with GLBC contained 199 mg/L Ca, much higher than the other four biochars. K release was dependent on biochar feedstock. Fermentation broth with CGBC addition contained the highest K (921 mg/L). SBBC did not release any K as the K concentration in the SBBC-supplemented broth was almost the same as the negative control without biochar addition (647 mg/L). For Mg, MFBC addition resulted in the highest content in the fermentation broth (77 mg/L), and GLBC also released high amount of Mg. The Mg brought by SBBC was negligible. Mg was proven to be beneficial to cell growth (Christensen et al., 2017), and thus the addition of Mg-rich biochar could facilitate the growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria and the consequent hydrogen production. MFBC released high amount of P (404.8 mg/L in the broth), which was significantly higher than other four kinds of biochars (p < 0.05)."
10,Effects of biochars from different feedstocks on hydrogen production,"3.2 Effects of biochars from different feedstocks on hydrogen production Addition of 3 g/L biochars from different feedstocks showed different promoting effects on hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the maximum hydrogen production was obtained when SBBC was added (84.58 mL). The fermentation supplemented with MFBC produced the second highest hydrogen of 80.18 mL. CSBC also exhibited positive promoting effects. Unexpectedly, the addition of CGBC did not significantly increase the hydrogen production compared to the control (68.42 vs. 70.99 mL). The different effects of these biochars were also reflected on hydrogen production rate. Fig. 2b showed the hydrogen production rates of different sampling intervals during the fermentation. Except for CGBC, the addition of other four biochars significantly increased the hydrogen production rate. During 22–28 h (the third sampling interval), the population of hydrogen-producing bacteria increased and the average hydrogen production rates in different groups all reached to the maximum. In this interval, fermentations with MFBC and GLBCs showed the highest two hydrogen production rates (6.08 and 5.97 mL/h, respectively), which were around two times that of the control group. The addition of SBBC and CSBC also improved the hydrogen production rates in this interval for more than 74%. The increase of hydrogen production rate could be ascribed to the good cell growth that benefited from biochar addition. The mild alkalinity, rich mineral nutrients, and porous structure of biochar improved the growth conditions for cells and consequently accelerated the production rate of end metabolites (Li et al., 2020c). The phenomenon that biochar increased the production rate was observed in various bio-processes, such as fermentative caproic acid production (Ghysels et al., 2021), methane production in anaerobic digestion (Qin et al., 2020), and fermentative butanol production (Wu et al., 2019). Similar to hydrogen production, the addition of CGBC did not show any enhancement in hydrogen production rate. The poor effect of CGBC on fermentative hydrogen production could be explained by its physicochemical characteristics. The CGBC contained plenty of flat tough surfaces while other biochars contained more folds and pores, resulting in the much lower SSA of CGBC than those of other biochars (Table 1). As SSA was a key factor affecting the cell growth and adhesion/colonization (Duan et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2020), the low SSA of CGBC could probably restrict its interaction with hydrogen-producing bacteria, which might be the main reason why CGBC did not promote hydrogen production. Similarly, the highest hydrogen production was obtained in fermentations supplemented with SBBC, of which the SSA was the largest among these five biochars. On the other hand, the low abundance of O-containing function groups might be another reason restricting the function of CGBC. As Fig. 1a showed, the O-containing surface functional groups of CGBC showed weak peaks in FTIR spectra, while the other four biochars showed strong and broad peaks. Many O-containing functional groups, such as phenolic groups, were thought to be capable to donate electrons to bacteria, which might affect the redox reactions and cell growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Klupfel et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2017). In addition, the absence or low abundance of various O-containing functional groups decreased the hydrophilicity of CGBC (Hassan et al., 2020a), which might affect the cell adhesion and electron transfer."
11,Effects of biochars from different feedstocks on liquid metabolites,"3.3 Effects of biochars from different feedstocks on liquid metabolites As discussed in previous studies, the ratio of ethanol/acetate (E/A) was a key index to indicate the hydrogen production levels of ethanol-type fermentation (Li et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2019b). A low E/A value indicated the metabolic flux was less distributed to ethanol synthesis pathway, saving more reducing power for hydrogen generation. Fig. 3 showed the ethanol/acetate concentration ratio in fermentations treated with different kinds of biochars. The control without biochar addition produced 2.72 g/L ethanol and 1.79 g/L acetate with E/A of 1.52. Compared to the control, the E/A values were all decreased when biochars were added. The lowest two E/A values were 1.22 and 1.26 in fermentations with MFBC and SBBC, respectively, which were 19.74% and 17.11% lower than that of the control. As a result, the hydrogen productions of these two groups were the highest two among these 5 groups. Fermentations with CSBC and GLBC showed E/A values of 1.33 and1.36, respectively, which were also lower than that of the control. The E/A ratio in fermentations with CGBC addition was relatively higher, but not significantly different compared to those with CSBC and GLBC (p < 0.05). Adsorption experiments without microorganisms were conducted to investigate the effect of biochar adsorption of liquid-phase products on E/A change. The results (Table S3) showed that the acetate concentration was not significantly changed after SBBC addition (p < 0.05), and the adsorption of ethanol was not substantial (<5%). The consequent E/A change (3.24%) resulted from adsorption of biochar was much less than E/A shift obtained in the fermentation with biochar addition, indicating metabolic shift of hydrogen-producing bacteria was the main reason for E/A change, and biochar affected the metabolism of cells. The limited adsorption of acids and alcohols of biochar was in line with the finding of Ghysels et al. (2021). The pH increased to 3.31 from 3.20 when 3 g/L biochar was added. Considering that acetate concentration did not change in the adsorption experiment, the increased pH value was driven by the alkalis of biochar instead of acid adsorption, which was in line with previous reports (Fidel et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2017). In summary, the redistribution of end-metabolites revealed that the addition of biochars altered the metabolism of hydrogen-producing bacteria, and MFBC and SBBC additions showed the best performance on lowering the E/A ratio, making the fermentation type approach acetate-type fermentation."
12,Effects of pyrolysis temperatures on biochar characteristics,"3.4 Effects of pyrolysis temperatures on biochar characteristics The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the promotion capability of biochar on ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production was studied, with SBBC as an example. Another material GL was used to prepare GLBCs at different pyrolysis temperatures and the data were accessible in the supplementary materials (Table S4, Fig. S3–5). Three pyrolysis temperatures, 300, 500 and 700 °C, were applied to prepare SBBC300, SBBC500 and SBBC700, respectively. As shown in Table 1, three kinds of SB biochars showed distinct physicochemical features. One-way ANOVA showed that all these parameters except N content were significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature. Biochar yields exhibited a negative correlation with the pyrolysis temperature. When the temperature increased from 300 to 700 °C, the yield of SBBC decreased from 57.23% to 18.16%. The decreased yield was caused by the further pyrolysis of biomass: more cellulose and other structural compounds were destructed or decomposed, and more vapor was released, leading to the loss of weight (Jung et al., 2016). This negative correlation of biochar yield with pyrolysis temperature has been widely reported in other kinds of biochars (Jung et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). In contrast to the biochar yield, biochar pH increased consistently with the pyrolysis temperature. The pH value of SBBC700 reached 11.47, significantly higher than that of SBBC300 (7.90). With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, more acidic functional groups disappeared and alkaline elements were released, leading to the increase of pH values. The increase of biochar pH with pyrolysis temperature was found in nearly all kinds of biochars (Li et al., 2019a). Biochars with higher alkalinity could neutralize more organic acids and reduce the inhibition of acids on hydrogen-producing bacteria, but the low dosage of biochar in fermentation broth (e.g. 3 g/L) might not make a significant difference on broth pH value. Therefore, whether the biochar with higher pH exhibited better promoting effect on hydrogen production remained to be examined. The element compositions of biochar were highly affected by pyrolysis temperature. As shown in Table 1, the content of C in SBBC increased from 61.74% to 76.32% when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 500 °C. When the temperature further increased to 700 °C, the C content increased to 79.5%. The increase of C content, a symbol of carbonization, was accompanied by the decrease of other elements, such as H. When the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 °C, the H content decreased from 4.17% to 1.27%. With the temperature increasing, more moisture, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, methane and some other H-containing chemicals were removed, resulting in the decrease of H content (Sun et al., 2014). The content of N of SBBC did not change with the temperature, which was in accordance with some biochars previously reported (Gai et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2013). The C/N atomic ratio increased with the pyrolysis temperature, which was mainly attributed to the increase of C content. C/H could indicate the degree of carbonization and aromaticity. C/H of SBBC increased from 14.83 to 63.06 when the temperature increased from 300 to 700 °C, showing that higher degree of carbonization and aromaticity of biochar was obtained at higher pyrolysis temperature. At different pyrolysis temperatures, biochars presented different surface characteristics. As shown in Table 1, the SSA of SBBC300 was 13.57 m2/g, and when the temperature rose to 500 °C, this value reached 283.87 m2/g. The huge increase of SSA was due to the further decomposition and gasification of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin at higher pyrolysis temperature. The increase of SSA with pyrolysis temperature was in line with previous studies (Li et al., 2019a; Sun et al., 2014). When the temperature further increased to 700 °C, the SSA slightly decreased but remained at the same level (from 283.87 to 270.50 m2/g). The pore volume was in the same trend as SSA. The TPV of SBBC500 was 0.14 cm3/g, 20 times higher that of the SBBC300. The TPV of SBBC700 was comparable to that of SBBC500. The pore width decreased slightly with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, suggesting pyrolysis temperature was not a key factor affecting pore sizes. The APW of three kinds of SBBC indicated that most of the pores belonged to micropores. Micropores were claimed to play an essential role in the pollutant adsorption of biochar (Gong et al., 2019), which might be conducive to the hydrogen production by adsorbing fermentation inhibitors. FTIR spectra showed the changes of surface functional groups of different SB biochars when the pyrolysis temperatures varied from 300 to 700 °C (Fig. 4 ). It demonstrated that pyrolysis temperature had a great impact on the surface functional groups. When the temperature was 300 °C, various functional groups could be identified based on the characteristic peaks, such as aromatic, aliphatic and phenolic groups. When the temperature rose to 500 °C, peak intensities and numbers changed. The alcohol/phenol OH stretch bond (−3400 cm−1) was significantly reduced in absorbance. The stretching vibration absorption of aliphatic CH (3000–2850 cm−1) was also decreased. The decreased absorbance of peaks was also found in CO stretching (1150–1200 cm−1) and phenolic OH (1413 cm−1). Aromatic CH (around 874 cm−1) showed increased absorbance in SBBC500. For SBBC500, peaks at 1550–1800 cm−1 corresponding to CC and CO showed similar or higher absorbances with SBBC300, which was ascribed to the increase of aromaticity at mid-level temperature (Zhao et al., 2018). When the pyrolysis temperature further increased to 700 °C, nearly all the characteristic peaks were negligible. The disappearance or significant loss of surface functional groups at high pyrolysis temperatures was in line with the previous study of SB biochar and other kinds of biochars (Banik et al., 2018; Domingues et al., 2017). The loss of surface functional groups, especially O-containing functions, would probably affect the function of biochar in fermentative hydrogen production."
13,Effects of biochar pyrolysis temperatures on hydrogen production promotion,"3.5 Effects of biochar pyrolysis temperatures on hydrogen production promotion In contrast to the biochar feedstock, pyrolysis temperature exhibited limited impact on the promoting effect of biochar on ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production. Fig. 5 showed the time courses of hydrogen production in fermentations treated with different SBBCs. With 15 g/L glucose as the substrate, fermentations treated with different kinds of SBBCs obtained significantly higher hydrogen productions (p < 0.05) than the control without biochar. The highest hydrogen production was obtained when SBBC300 was supplemented, which was 20.3% higher than that of the control (119.5 vs. 99.3 mL, respectively). Compared to SBBC300, the promoting effects of SBBC500 and SBBC700 were slightly lower but not significantly different (p < 0.05), indicating pyrolysis temperature did not affect the promoting effect of SB biochar on hydrogen production. This was also illustrated by the hydrogen production kinetics shown in Table 2 . The kinetics study showed that the predicted maximum hydrogen productions were 124.8, 120.4 and 123.7 mL for fermentations treated with SBBC300, SBBC500 and SBBC700, respectively. Similarly, the highest hydrogen production rates and lag phases were also very close. Therefore, pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 °C could all be used to prepare SB biochars to enhance ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production, but in view of energy consumption, low pyrolysis temperature would be more economical and practical."
14,Discussion,
15,Comparison of effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature,"4.1 Comparison of effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature The effects of feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature on biochar physicochemical features were intensively studied, but their effects on the functions of biochar differed with the application fields, such as contaminant removal, phosphate adsorption, and reduction of ammonia volatilization, (Hassan et al., 2020a; Jung et al., 2016; Mandal et al., 2018). Therefore, we investigated the effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on the promoting performance of biochar on ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production with five biomass wastes and three temperatures. The results showed that feedstock and pyrolysis temperature exerted different influences on biochar characteristics (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Fig. 4,) and the consequent functions (Fig. 2–3, Fig. 5, and Table 2). Coefficient of variance was employed to study the heterogeneities caused by feedstock (FH) and pyrolysis temperature (TH), and determine the relations between biochar characteristics and factors, and the results were shown in Fig. 6 a. When a characteristic or function was more affected by feedstock, it would appear in the right of the angular bisector (close to Y axis), and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 6a, SSA, TPV, APW, and N content were more dependent on feedstock; the biochar yield, H content and pH were more dependent on pyrolysis temperature. Feedstock and temperature had similar effects on the C content of biochar. Surface functional groups was not shown in Fig. 6a, but the results showed that surface functional groups were significantly affected by both feedstock and temperature (Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). SSA was close to TPV in Fig. 6a, which was in line with the fact that they showed positive correlation in this study and other reports (Cha et al., 2016; Mandal et al., 2018). The release of volatile matters produced plenty of pores, leading to the increase of TPV and SSA. The promoting effect of biochar on hydrogen production was close to SSA, TPV and APW, which might suggest that the function of biochar was related to SSA and pore characteristics. These effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on physicochemical characteristics of biochar were generally in accordance with previous studies (Jung et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). Like the physicochemical characteristics, the effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on the promoting effect of biochar on hydrogen production were also different. The promoting performance in ethanol-type fermentation was highly dependent on feedstock types rather than pyrolysis temperature of biochar. Five tested biochars of different feedstocks exhibited different promotion capabilities, among which the fermentation with SBBC addition obtained the highest hydrogen yield while CGBC obtained the lowest. The addition of SBBC prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures improved hydrogen yields to a similar level without significant difference. These results showed that for ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production, the feedstock was the dominant factor affecting the promotion capability of biochar. This finding was different from that of a previous report with mixed acid fermentative hydrogen production (Wang et al., 2018), which was probably ascribed to the different fermentation types. Wang et al. (2018) compared four kinds of feedstocks at three pyrolysis temperatures in anaerobic digestion of food wastes with sewage sludge as inoculum, and found that biochars prepared at high pyrolysis temperature showed high alkalinity and enhanced the productions of hydrogen, so the author concluded that pH buffering capacity of biochar was the dominant factor of its promoting function on fermentative hydrogen production. A large amount of acid was produced in that study, including acetate, butyrate and propionate, resulting in the fast acidification of broth. Low pH could lead to the inhibition of enzyme activity, substrate utilization and hydrogen production, so the biochar with high alkalinity prepared at high pyrolysis temperature showed significant promotion on hydrogen and VFA productions and substrate utilization. When it came to ethanol-type fermentation or fermentations with low substrate loading, pH buffering capacity was not the dominant feature determining the promoting effect of biochar. As an evidence, in our previous study, 3 g/L rice straw-derived biochar enabled the complete consumption of 10 g/L glucose in ethanol-type fermentation, while 6 g/L was needed for butyrate-type fermentation process (Li et al., 2020c)."
16,Key features and potential mechanisms of the promotion of biochar,"4.2 Key features and potential mechanisms of the promotion of biochar PCA, a multivariate statistical method to reduce the data dimensions, was widely used to analyze the interactive relations of different factors (Ghysels et al., 2020). PCA was conducted with C, H, N, pH, SSA, hydrogen yield, and maximum hydrogen production rate (Rmax) as the variables. Three principal components explaining 92.64% of the total variance were selected to describe the data. As shown in Fig. 6b, the first principal component (PC1) was explained by the variances of SSA, C content, and hydrogen yield, and PC2 was explained by H content, hydrogen yield, Rmax, and pH. In line with the experimental results, pH had a limited correlation with hydrogen yield in this study, which was thought to be ascribed to the unique characteristics of ethanol-type fermentation. The strong correlation of SSA and C content was because higher carbonization degree resulted in more breakages of feedstock structures and higher C content, and the produced volatile materials-created pores and increased SSA, which was in line with Fig. 6a. The carbonization also increased the alkalinity of biochar, which was reflected by the correlation of C content and pH value. Among the biochar properties tested in PCA, SSA showed the strongest correlation with hydrogen yield, which was in accordance with the result of CV in Fig. 6a, indicating that SSA was a key parameter of biochar to promote hydrogen production. This hypothesis might find evidence in the results of the feedstock study above. The hydrogen production-promoting effects of five kinds of biochars were ranked as SBBC > MFBC > GLBC/CSBC > CGBC, and the SSA order was SBBC > MFBC > GLBC > CSBC > CGBC. As previously reported, the promoting effects of biochar might be controlled by multiple factors, which might be related to surface functional groups, cell adhesion, mineral elements and pH buffering (Li et al., 2020c). This study showed the underlying correlation of the promotion capability of biochar and its SSA. Except for SSA and pore characteristics, the abundance and intensity of surface functional groups also showed potential positive correlation with the promoting effect, as shown in the comparison of biochars of five feedstocks (Fig. 1–2). The functional groups had been proven to be involved in electron transfer and some redox reactions, which could affect microbial processes (Saquing et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018), but was not included in CV analysis and PCA of Fig. 6. Therefore, the surface functional group was another possible key property of biochar to enhance hydrogen production. For the study of pyrolysis temperature, the SSA increased with temperature, but the promoting effect did not change, which was probably attributed to the decrease of surface functional groups of biochar at high temperature (shown in the FTIR spectra). Biochar showed redox activity (electron donating capability) related to oxygen-containing functional groups, which was sharply decreased with the decrease/disappear of surface functional groups at high pyrolysis temperature (Yuan et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2017). Based on the results in this study, it was speculated that the biochar promoted hydrogen production mainly via two different ways at low and high pyrolysis temperatures. For biochars prepared at low pyrolysis temperature (e.g. 300–500 °C), the SSA and TPV were very low, and the promotion on hydrogen production was dominated by the surface functional groups. This kind of promoting effect was related to electron donating capability of biochar and thus was named PE. For biochar prepared at high pyrolysis temperature (e.g. 500–700 °C), the functional groups mostly disappeared, and the promotion was dominated by the significantly increased SSA and TPV. The high SSA and TPV might function by cell adhesion and immobilization, which were demonstrated to promote the growth of hydrogen-producing cells (Jamali et al., 2016; Lutpi et al., 2016). In addition, the porous structure of biochar could adsorb some end metabolites and other inhibitors in the fermentation broth, reducing the inhibition on hydrogen-producing cells (Klasson et al., 2013; Luz et al., 2018). This promoting mechanism concerning the cell growth was named PC. PC could also include the promoting effect brought by high alkalinity for biochars prepared at high temperature. The high alkalinity neutralized the volatile acids produced in the dark fermentation and thus reduced the inhibition of high concentration of H+ on cells. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, PE gradually decreased while PC increased, but the overall P (PE + PC) remained at the same level, which explained why the biochars prepared at low-high temperatures exhibited similar promoting effects on hydrogen production of ethanol-type fermentation. This speculated promotion theory could well explain the fermentation results in this study, of which some details, such as the redox activity of surface functional groups, remained to be further studied."
17,Conclusion,"This study investigated the influencing factors of the promoting performance of biochar on ethanol-type fermentative hydrogen production. It was found that various physicochemical characteristics of biochar were affected by feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. The feedstock exhibited a great impact on the promotion function of biochar, while the effect of pyrolysis temperature was negligible, which was different from the previous finding with mixed acid-type fermentative hydrogen production. The study showed the promotion pathways of biochar were complicated and varied with different fermentation types for hydrogen production. Based on the heterogeneity of the physicochemical characteristics caused by feedstock and temperature, a speculated promotion mechanism of biochar was proposed on hydrogen production. This study showed that biochar selection should be based on concrete fermentation types, and provided new insight into the mechanism of the promotion function of biochar on fermentative hydrogen production."
