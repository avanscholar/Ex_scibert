0,Introduction,"The development of a sustainable hydrogen economy, wherein H2 will replace fossil fuels as the principal energy carrier for electricity generation and transportation, demands novel technologies for the sustainable and large scale production of hydrogen [1,2]. Steam methane reforming (SMR) and the water-gas shift reaction are the cornerstones of current hydrogen production, but these processes are not sustainable as they consume a fossil fuel (methane) and release a molar equivalent of CO2 into the atmosphere (overall SMR + WGS: CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H2, with the net carbon footprint being even larger due to the significant energy inputs required to run these high temperature processes) [3–5]. Various alternative technologies for H2 production are now being explored, with photocatalytic water splitting and alcohol photoreforming receiving a lot of attention owing to their simplicity and low capital investment costs [6–15]. Fujishima et al. first demonstrated the potential of a semiconductor photocatalyst (TiO2) to split water and evolve H2 under UV photoexcitation in 1972 [6], motivating numerous subsequent studies aimed at: 1) mechanistic understanding of water splitting on semiconductor surfaces; and 2) the development of more efficient water splitting photocatalysts or photoelectrochemical systems. In spite of intensive investigation over the past five decades, no semiconductor photocatalyst has yet been developed that can split water efficiently at industrially relevant rates under direct sunlight (the solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies for even the best water splitting photocatalysts reported to date are < 2%). This has prompted researchers to use sacrificial agents (hole scavengers) to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production rates, with renewable biofuels such as alcohols being the preferred choice of sacrificial agent for oxide-based semiconductor photocatalyst systems. M/TiO2 photocatalysts, where M represents a high work function metal such as Pd (Φ =5.6 eV), Pt (Φ =5.7 eV) or Au (Φ = 5.3–5.6 eV) [11,12], have been widely studied in relation to alcohol photoreforming under UV excitation [15–44], owing to their high activities and excellent stabilities. These co-catalysts, when dispersed on TiO2 in nanoparticle form, create rectifying Schottky junctions with TiO2. Electrons photoexcited into the conduction band of TiO2 thus migrate onto the supported metal nanoparticles, which then act as cathodic sites for proton or water reduction to H2. The addition of an alcohol sacrificial agent serves to further suppress electron-hole pair recombination in the semiconductor (by directly or indirectly consuming valence band holes), thereby maximizing the H2 production efficiency of M/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV excitation. Commonly used alcohol sacrificial agents are methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol. These sacrificial agents either directly donate electrons into the valence band of TiO2 (e.g. CH3OH + h+(VB) → ⋅CH2OH + H+) or react with hydroxyl radicals generated by water oxidation on TiO2 surfaces (e.g. H2O + h+(VB) → H+ + ⋅OH, with the OH⋅ radicals then reacting with the alcohol to initially form an alpha-hydroxy radical ⋅CH2OH + H2O) [23,25,32,36–38,45,46]. The alpha hydroxy radicals formed may then donate an electron into the conduction band of TiO2, thus enhancing H2 evolution via a process known as current doubling (i.e. 2 conduction band electrons result from the absorption of one UV photon by TiO2). Recent photocatalytic studies using D2O and CH3OH have shown that D2 and some HD are the main products evolved on the metal co-catalyst sites during methanol photoreforming, indicating that majority of the hydrogen evolved originated from H2O [47–51]. The primary role of the alcohol sacrificial agent in alcohol photoreforming is therefore to scavenge ⋅OH radicals or enhance H2 production via the current doubling effect [23,25]. To date, most studies of alcohol photoreforming over M/TiO2 photocatalysts have used a single alcohol and a single alcohol concentration, being mainly concerned with the effects of co-catalyst type, co-catalyst loading or TiO2 polymorph on H2 production rates. Some studies have explored the effect of the alcohol sacrificial agent on H2 production rates (at a fixed alcohol concentration) [21,23–25,34,37,38,43,44,52]. López-Tenllado and co-workers [43,44] studied photocatalytic H2 production over 0.5 % Pt/TiO2 in a range of alcohol-water systems under UV excitation, including C-3 alcohols and ethanol (5 vol.% alcohol). Hydrogen production rates were found to follow the order ethanol ≈ propan-2-ol > propan-1-ol > propane-1,2,3-triol > propane-1,2-diol > propane-1,3-diol, with activity being linked to the extent of alcohol adsorption on TiO2, which was lowest for ethanol and propan-2-ol. These finding are however contradictory to the work of other groups, who observed that hydrogen production rates follow the order 1,2,3-triols > 1,2-diols > monoalcohols [20,23–25,53], suggesting further studies are needed to clarify the effect of alcohol type on H2 production rates during alcohol photoreforming. Very few works to date have examined M/TiO2 photocatalyst performance over a wide range of alcohol concentrations (0−100 vol.%), though typically these works have employed a single alcohol [20,53]. Reports systematically comparing the H2 production performance of several different M/TiO2 photocatalysts as a function of both alcohol type (mono-alcohol, diol and triol) and alcohol concentration are practically non-existent. Recently, Chen et al. reported a detailed comparative study of alcohol photoreforming over Ni/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV [20]. Four different alcohol-water systems were studied (aqueous methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol), at concentrations ranging from 0−100 vol.%. This uniquely comprehensive study identified the optimum alcohol concentration for H2 production in each alcohol-water system (∼50, 80, 20 and 10 vol.%, respectively, with the optimum concentration being largely independent of the metal co-catalyst), whilst also drawing attention to the importance of a low solution viscosity in efficient alcohol photoreforming. Here, we aimed to extend the recent work of Chen et al. [20], by systematically examining the alcohol photoreforming performance of a low cost Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst over a wide range of alcohol-water systems and concentrations (benchmarked against Au/TiO2). Whilst many precious metal co-catalysts, including Pd, Ru, Pt and Au, are effective in promoting H2 evolution during alcohol photoreforming over TiO2-based photocatalysts, the scarcity and high cost of these metals motivate the search for low cost alternative co-catalysts that can deliver comparable performance. In this regard, first row transition metal co-catalysts are highly desirable due to the earth abundance of these elements, with Cu-modified TiO2 systems being particularly promising for alcohol photoreforming (Table S1) [54–78]. Sinatra et al. reported that the photocatalytic H2 production activity of a Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst was 10 times higher than Au/TiO2 photocatalyst in a 5 vol.% ethylene glycol-water mixtures under UV and visible irradiation [54], though the Au co-catalyst loading was non-optimal in that study. Majeed et al. prepared a series of Cu(OH)2-Ni(OH)2/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts (total metal loading =1 wt.%) by the co-deposition-precipitation method and evaluated their performance for photocatalytic H2 production in 20 vol.% ethanol-water and 5 vol.% glycerol-water mixtures [55]. A 0.8 wt.% Cu(OH)2-0.2 wt.% Ni(OH)2/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst afforded the best H2 production rates (10 and 22 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively), with metallic Cu0 and Ni0 formed in-situ during the photoreaction identified as the active co-catalyst species. Yu et al. examined photocatalytic H2 production in 20 vol.% methanol solutions using rod-like CuO/TiO2 catalysts prepared by a microwave-assisted synthesis method [56]. The deposition of CuO was found to significantly improve charge separation in the TiO2 support, photocatalyst stability and performance for hydrogen evolution. However, the working state of the photocatalyst and active copper co-catalyst species were not investigated in detail in that study. Hou et al. found that ternary hybrid Cu/CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts showed good efficiencies for H2 evolution (reporting a hydrogen production rate of 0.851 mmol g−1 h−1) in 25 vol.% methanol solution [57], with the ternary structure of the photocatalyst identified as being beneficial for charge separation following photoexcitation. Liu et al. evaluated the performance of Cu2O/anatase and Cu2O/rutile photocatalysts for H2 production in aqueous methanol solutions [58]. The Cu2O/anatase photocatalyst showed superior photocatalytic activity to the Cu2O/rutile photocatalyst due to the more favorable alignment of band edges at the Cu2O/anatase interface which improved charge transfer and hole-mediated methanol oxidation. Jung et al. reported that metallic Cu was dominant surface species on TiO2 during glycerol photoreforming [59]. Mondal et al. prepared highly dispersed Cu/CuO/TiO2 ternary hybrids using a copper metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) as a precursor [60]. The optimal Cu loading was around 0.5 wt.%, affording a H2 production rate of 286 mmol g−1 h−1 in 15 vol.% alcohol under UV excitation (400 W). This rate, which is remarkably high (and scarcely believable) relative to other reported studies for CuOx/TiO2 systems (Table S1), was attributed to the presence of active Cu0 species and the unique heterojunction formed between CuO and TiO2. Xu et al. reported efficient hydrogen production from 10 vol.% methanol on CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts under visible light irradiation [62]. The optimal CuO loading was around 9.1 mol.%, giving a H2 production rate of 18.5 mmol g−1 h−1. Chen et al. prepared a series of CuO/P25 TiO2 photocatalysts using a complex precipitation method [71], varying the CuO loading from 0.1–15 wt.%. A 1.25 wt.% CuO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst afforded the highest rate of H2 production (20.3 mmol g−1 h−1) in 80:20 ethanol-water mixtures under UV excitation. A Cu(II) species, possibly small 1−2 nm CuO nanoparticles, were tentatively proposed as the active sites for H2 evolution. Kum et al. reported that a simple TiO2/CuO physical mixture (10:1 wt. ratio) afforded a H2 production rate of 8.23 mmol g−1 h−1 in 20 vol.% aqueous methanol under Xe lamp irradiation, with interfacial contact between the semiconductor components deemed to be important for achieving a high activity [78]. The discussion above highlights the pervading uncertainty around the active copper co-catalyst species (CuO, a Cu(II) complex, Cu2O, Cu0 or combinations of these) responsible for promoting H2 production on TiO2 surfaces during alcohol photoreforming under UV. Much of this controversy relates to (1) the fast oxidation of small Cu0 nanoparticles to CuOx nanoparticles in air; (2) the susceptibility of CuOx nanoparticles to reduction under X-ray irradiation (i.e. during XPS characterization) or electron beam irradiation (i.e. during TEM characterization); and (3) the lack of in-situ characterization studies done on Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts under the conditions of alcohol photoreforming (much of the information reported to date about Cu speciation is from ex-situ studies where the photocatalyst has been exposed to air after reaction). All of these points hinder the understanding of the Cu/TiO2 system and identification of the true active copper co-catalyst species. This study aimed to address the critical knowledge gaps relating to alcohol photoreforming over Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts, by systematically comparing the performance a 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst and a 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst for H2 production in a wide range of alcohol-water mixtures (alcohols used were methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, with alcohol concentrations ranging from 0−100 vol.%) at realistic solar UV fluxes (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). Previous studies by our group had identified 1 wt.% as Cu0 (or 1.25 wt.% as CuO) and 2 wt.% Au to be the optimum co-catalyst loading for Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 systems, respectively [42,71]. Hence, these loadings were adopted here. Commercially available Evonik P25 TiO2 (85 wt.% anatase +15 wt.% rutile) was selected as the TiO2 support to allow direct comparison with the prior work of other groups. The objectives of this study were 4-fold: (1) to gain better understanding of the dispersed state of copper on P25 TiO2 during alcohol photoreforming under UV; (2) to gauge the relative merits of the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production in different alcohol-water systems under UV; (3) to systematically examine the effect of alcohol concentration on H2 production rates for the Cu/TiO2 and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts; and (4) to explore relationships between photocatalytic H2 production rates and specific properties of the alcohol (alcohol structure, polarity, standard oxidation potential and solution viscosity). Due to the uniquely comprehensive nature of the study, results were expected to provide a valuable resource for other researchers developing Cu/TiO2 and M/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production via alcohol photoreforming."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper nitrate hemihydrate (98 %), glycerol (≥ 99 %), urea (≥ 99.5 %), sodium hydroxide (≥ 98 %), methanol (≥99.8 %), P25 TiO2, absolute ethanol (≥99.8 %), ethylene glycol (99.8 %), glycerol (≥ 99.5 %) were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared using milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). A reference photocatalyst, 2 wt.% Au/TiO2, was prepared using the deposition-precipitation with urea method described by Zanella et al. [77]. Relevant characterization data for the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst is provided in reference 42."
3,CuO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 CuO/P25 TiO2 photocatalyst preparation A 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared by the complex precipitation method described by Yoong et al. [68]. Briefly, copper nitrate hemihydrate (0.37 g) and glycerol (mole ratio of 1:2) were added to milli Q water (200 mL) to form an aqueous copper(II)-glycerol complex. P25 TiO2 (10 g) was then added to the solution containing the copper(II)-glycerol complex with continuous stirring. The copper-glycerol complex was then precipitated on the TiO2 support by the dropwise addition of 0.5 M NaOH under constant stirring until pH 12 was reached. The resulting suspension was stirred for a further 1 h, then the light blue-green powder produced (presumably Cu(OH)2/TiO2) collected by vacuum filtration. After washing repeatedly with milli-Q water, the Cu(OH)2/TiO2 powder was dried overnight at 70 °C in air. The 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was obtained by calcination of Cu(OH)2/TiO2 at 300 °C for 2 h. During alcohol photoreforming tests, the CuO was reduced to Cu0, thus giving a 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst (see the results and discussion section below)."
4,Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst preparation by hydrogen reduction,"2.3 Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst preparation by hydrogen reduction 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were obtained by heating the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst under a H2/N2 flow (10 vol.% H2, 100 mL min−1) at 200−500 °C for 2 h. This treatment reduced the adsorbed CuO species to metallic form as evidenced by a change in colour of the powders from light blue-green to a very dark blue. Some additional H2 reduction experiments were also performed on CuO/TiO2 samples prepared at higher CuO loadings (5 wt.% and 10 wt.%) to verify Cu° formation by XRD."
5,wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization,"2.4 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization UV–vis absorbance spectra and in-situ UV–vis absorbance spectra were recorded over the range 250−1400 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-240A integrating sphere attachment. Barium sulfate was used as a reflectance standard. UV–vis spectroscopy was also used to monitor the photoreduction of 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 to 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 under conditions of alcohol photoreforming. Briefly, the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was placed in a standard diffuse reflectance sample holder, then moistened with water or different alcohol-water mixtures (10 vol.% alcohol). The holder was sealed with its lid (containing a quartz window), then the sample irradiated under UV (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2) for 1 h through the quartz window. At 10 min intervals during the UV irradiation period, a UV–vis spectrum was collected from the sample to examine the optical properties of the sample. In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectra for the reoxidation of Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were collected on the same spectrometer-integrating sphere system. The 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was reduced in 10 vol.% H2 (in N2) at different temperatures (200−600 ℃) for 2 h in a quartz tube reactor, cooled quickly to room temperature under the H2/N2 flow. Next, the obtained 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst was immediately transferred to the sample holder of the integrating sphere attachment. The cover on the sample holder (containing a quartz window) was applied loosely to allow O2 from the air to be slowly introduced to the sample. The 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts slowly re-oxidized to with exposure to air under ambient conditions, with in-situ UV–vis spectra being collected as a function of time. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were collected on a JEOL 2200FS transmission electron microscope equipped with a Field Emission Gun and a High Resolution (HR) lens system. All images were collected at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For bright field HRTEM imaging, a GATAN UltraScan1000 4 megapixel (2048 × 2048) CCD camera was used, with the maximum achievable point-to-point resolution being 0.1 nm. INCA was also used to process EDS data which was collected in tandem with STEM images. EDS signals were detected using a thermoelectrically cooled OXFORD instruments 80 mm Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) shielded by an ultra-thin polymer window. EPR data were collected on a JEOL (JESFA-200) EPR spectrometer, equipped with a variable temperature controller (ES-DVT4) and operated at 9.427 GHz and 100 kHz field modulation. Acquisition parameters for the collection of EPR data from dry photocatalysts at room temperature under an N2 atmosphere were: 5 × 100 sweep width, time =2 min, 0.35 × 1 modulation width, 5 × 100 amplitude and time constant = 0.1 and power =1 mW. EPR data were also collected at −60 °C under a N2 atmosphere for “wet” photocatalysts that had been subjected to UV irradiation in a 10 vol.% glycerol-Chelex water mixture at room temperature. Acquisition parameters were: 5 × 100 sweep width, time = 2 min, 0.35 × 1 modulation width, 5 × 100 amplitude and time constant = 0.1 and power =1 mW. Chelex water was used to minimise non-resonant losses of electromagnetic waves in the resonance cavity. Powder XRD patterns were taken on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved graphite filter monochromator. XRD data was collected from 2θ = 10−90° (step 0.02°, scan rate 2° min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ =1.5418 Å, 40 mA, 40 kV). Anatase and rutile crystallite sizes (L) were determined from the powder XRD data using the Scherrer equation and line-widths of the anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3° and rutile (110) reflection at 2θ = 27.4°, respectively. The rutile:anatase ratio in the samples was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [79]. % R u t i l e = 1 1 + 0.8 ( I A / I R ) × 100 where IA is the peak intensity for the anatase (101) reflection, and IR is the peak intensity for the rutile (110) reflection. XPS data was collected using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer and an analysis chamber of base pressure ∼1 × 10−9 Torr. Spectra were excited using monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.69 eV), with the X-ray source operating at 150 W. A charge neutralisation system was used to alleviate sample charge building up during analysis. Survey scans were collected at a pass energy of 80 eV over the binding energy range 1200−0 eV, whilst core level scans were collected with a pass energy of 20 eV. The spectra were calibrated against the C 1s signal at 285.0 eV from adventitious hydrocarbons. EXAFS analyses were carried out on beamline BL01B1 at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8). The 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were pressed into thin pellets for the Cu K-edge EXAFS measurements, with a specific pellet thickness and density chosen to achieve an edge jump of ∼0.4. Sample pellets were then transferred into an aluminium cell sealed by Kapton windows and connected to a gas flow reaction system. In-situ quick XAFS (QXAFS) data were collected in transmission mode. Cu K-edge spectra for each sample, were first collected at room temperature. In-situ XAFS analyses on Cu K-edge were carried out on the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst with heating in a H2:He gas flow (1 vol.% H2) to study CuO reduction. Additionally, Cu K-edge data was collected for 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst before and after UV irradiation in 10 vol.% glycerol to study the photoreduction of CuO to Cu0. For the EXAFS analysis, the oscillations were extracted from the EXAFS data by a spline smoothing method, and then normalized by the edge height around 50 eV above the absorption threshold. R-space plots were obtained by performing a Fourier transformation of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillation from k-space to r-space over the range 30−140 nm−1. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195 °C) using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument. Specific surface areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using P/P0 values in the range 0.05−0.2 [80,81]. Samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 1 h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. All samples had similar N2 physisorption isotherms that could be classified as Type II according to the IUPAC convention for adsorption isotherms. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in air at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. A 290 nm cutoff filter was used. Spectra were excited at 310 nm and photoluminescence spectra were recorded over a range of 330−600 nm using a standard photomultiplier."
6,Alcohol photoreforming tests,"2.5 Alcohol photoreforming tests Alcohol photoreforming tests on the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2, 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 (H2-reduced) and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were carried out in a tubular Pyrex reactor (105 mL volume). Photocatalyst (6.5 mg) was placed in the reactor and flushed under a N2 flow for 30 min to remove oxygen. Then, 20 mL of an alcohol-water mixture (0−100 vol.% alcohol) was injected into the reactor through a rubber septum and the resulting photocatalyst dispersion stirred continuously for 1 h in the dark (no UV excitation). The reactor was then exposed to a UV flux, supplied from a Spectraline model SB-100 P/F lamp (100 W, 365 nm) at a distance of 10 cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 6.5 mW cm−2 (the UV flux from the Sun is approximately 5 mW cm−2). Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas head space samples (1 mL) at 20 min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.53 mm, average thickness 30 μm). H2 evolved was quantified against an external calibration curve of peak area versus moles of H2. Photocatalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Preliminary photocatalyst characterization studies,"3.1 Preliminary photocatalyst characterization studies The as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst had a light blue-green coloration, confirming the successful deposition of CuO on the surface of the P25 TiO2 support. High resolution transmission electron microscopy was applied to examine the CuO dispersion on the surface of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show HRTEM images for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst after exposure to the electron beam for 5 min and 30 min, respectively. The HRTEM image obtained immediately after putting the sample into the electron microscope (Fig. 1(a)) had very little surface texture, suggesting the CuO phase was highly dispersed. An anatase particle of size 20−30 nm with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.35 nm, typical for anatase (101) planes, is seen in the image [82,83]. After focussed electron beam exposure for 30 min, small 1−2 nm nanoparticles could be discerned on the anatase particle (Fig. 1(b)). These small nanoparticles are likely Cu0 nanoparticles formed by the electron beam-induced reduction of the highly dispersed CuO species. Fig. 1(c) shows a high resolution TEM image for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst following methanol photoreforming tests (in 10 vol.% methanol under UV). Following the methanol reforming tests, the photocatalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed with deaerated methanol, then dispersed on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid for analysis (all procedures being performed under a N2 atmosphere to avoid copper nanoparticle oxidation). The HRTEM image of the sample in shown in Fig. 1(c), and was identical in most respects to the HRTEM image of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst subjected to prolonged electron beam bombardment (cf. Fig. 1(b)). EDS analysis performed on one of the larger nanoparticles seen in Fig. 1(c) confirmed that the nanoparticle was rich in copper. The EDS analysis could not discriminate Cu0 or CuOx due to the contribution from the TiO2 support. However, other analyses performed on the post alcohol-reforming photocatalysts (discussed below) confirmed the predominance of Cu0. Thus, we thus identify the small nanoparticles seen in Fig. 1(c) as metallic copper nanoparticles (i.e. formed through CuO reduction during alcohol photoreforming). This conclusion was supported by the data in Fig. 1(e) and (f), which show TEM images for 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by hydrogen reduction of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst at 300 ℃ and 500 ℃, respectively. The images collected for the H2-reduced photocatalysts closely resemble that of the post-methanol reforming photocatalyst (Fig. 1(c)), supporting the argument that CuO is reduced to Cu0 under the conditions of methanol photoreforming. In the current work, the alcohol photoreforming activity of different 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts are evaluated against a 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 reference photocatalyst. Fig. S1(c) and (d) show TEM images for the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst. Au nanoparticles of diameter 4−6 nm can be seen dispersed over the P25 TiO2 support, showing a preference for interparticle heterojunctions between TiO2 nanoparticles. Previous studies have reported that Au nanoparticle migration and positioning on anatase-rutile heterojunctions create “hot spots” for photocatalytic H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures under UV, due to synergistic electron transfer phenomena which occur at such sites [42]. Fig. 2 shows a selection of characterization data collected for the as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts. Powder XRD patterns for P25 TiO2, 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2(a). The pattern for each is dominated by contributions from anatase and rutile crystallites in P25 TiO2. The anatase:rutile weight ratios for all samples, estimated from the relative intensities of anatase (101) and rutile (110) reflections at 2θ = 25.3° and 27.4°, respectively, were 6:1 and in good accord with the manufacturers specifications. Mean sizes of the anatase and rutile particles calculated from the FWHM of the same reflections using the Scherrer equation were ∼25 nm and ∼43 nm, respectively (consistent with TEM observations, Fig. S1(a) and (b)). No CuO reflections were seen for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst, which is explained by the low nominal CuO loading and the very high dispersion of the CuO nanoparticles (< 2 nm by TEM) which would cause extreme peak broadening. For the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, some weak metallic Au reflections were seen, the most obvious of which is the Au(200) peak at 2θ = 44.4°. The more intense Au(111) reflection at 2θ = 38.1° is obscured by peaks from the TiO2 support. Fig. 2(b) shows Cu 2p XPS spectra for the as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst and a bulk CuO reference sample. The spectra have been normalized to the same intensity to a facilitate comparison. The Cu 2p XPS spectra for both samples showed peaks at 933.7 and 953.6 eV in a 2:1 area ratio, which can readily be assigned to the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 transitions, respectively, of CuO (reported Cu 2p3/2 binding energies for Cu0, Cu2O, CuO, Cu(OH)2 are 932.6, 932.5. 933.7, 935.1 and 935.5 eV, respectively [84–90]). The presence of the characteristic Cu(II) 3d9 “shake up” satellites about 7 eV above the main Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 signals provides further evidence for CuO on the surface of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst rather than Cu2O or Cu0 (neither of which has “shake up” satellites because of their complete 3d shells). The Au 4f XPS spectrum of the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst showed Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 signals (4:3 area ratio) at 83.6 and 87.3 eV (see ref 42), typical for Au0 nanoparticles supported on P25 TiO2. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is widely used for the characterisation of paramagnetic species, such as Cu2+ ([Ar]3d9). EPR spectra for P25 TiO2, 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and a bulk CuO reference powder in air are shown in Fig. 2(c). The P25 TiO2 support was EPR inactive under the conditions of this experiment. The 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst gave a very sharp Cu2+ EPR signal, whereas the corresponding signal for bulk CuO reference powder was much broader due to long range dipole-dipole interactions between Cu2+ ions in large CuO grains. The EPR data for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts confirmed Cu2+ in the form of an adsorbed complex or very small CuO nanoparticles were present on the P25 TiO2 support. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra collected in air for P25 TiO2, 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 and the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2(d). Following photoexcitation under UV (310 nm), P25 TiO2 produced an intense PL signal due to radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs in anatase and rutile [91,92]. After deposition of CuO or Au nanoparticles, the PL signal was strongly attenuated (by ∼ 50 % for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst and by ∼75 % for the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst). This attenuation is attributed to photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 migrating onto the supported co-catalyst nanoparticles, thereby reducing electron-hole pair recombination and spontaneous emission in the P25 TiO2 support. The transfer of photoexcited electrons from TiO2 to the supported CuO nanoparticles could have been expected to reduce the CuO nanoparticles to Cu0 nanoparticles, though in air this is unlikely to occur due to competing reoxidation processes (discussed below) and superoxide radical formation. UV–vis absorption spectra and Tauc plots for P25 TiO2, the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst and the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst are shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f), respectively. All samples absorbed strongly below 400 nm due to the P25 TiO2 support (Eg ∼3.1 eV). Deposition of CuO and Au onto the P25 TiO2 support resulted in the appearance additional absorption signals at visible wavelengths. The 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst showed a very broad absorption signal from 600−1400 nm, consistent with the blue-green colour of the sample. The feature is assigned to d-d transitions of supported nanocrystalline CuO (Cu2+ is paramagnetic with a 3d9 electron configuration) [93]. For the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, a well-defined and intense feature centred around 580 nm was observed, which can readily be assigned to the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of the supported Au nanoparticles. The Au LSPR feature gave the 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalyst a dark purple coloration. Band gaps estimated from Tauc transformations of the absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 2(f), with the bandgaps for all samples being similar to that of the P25 TiO2 support (Eg ∼ 3.1 eV)."
9,Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments,"3.2 Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments The reducibility of CuO on TiO2 was of particular interest in the current study, as we aimed to pinpoint the active copper co-catalyst species responsible for H2 production during alcohol photoreforming. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption measurements provide valuable insight in this regard. Fig. 3 (a) shows Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) data for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst, and the same photocatalyst after UV irradiation in 10 vol.% methanol or H2 reduction at 500 ℃ for 2 h (Fig. S2 shows the same Cu K-edge spectra over both the XANES and EXAFS regions). The Cu K-edge XANES spectrum for as prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst showed peaks at 8997 eV, which by comparison with the data collected for CuO can readily be assigned to a Cu(II) or CuO-like species on TiO2 [79]. The in-situ spectra obtained after UV irradiation in 10 vol.% glycerol, and after H2 reduction treatment at 500 ℃ for 2 h, both showed a distinct shoulder at ∼8979 eV, which is attributed to the 1 s to 4p transition in metallic copper [94,95]. In fact, the data for the two treated samples closely resembled that collected for the Cu metal reference foil, confirming that both of these treatments cause the reduction of supported CuO to metallic face-centred cubic copper [80]. Corresponding R-space plots are shown in Fig. 3(b). The spectrum for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst showed a first coordination shell feature at 1.46 Å, characteristic for Cu-O bonds in CuO. Following UV irradiation in a 10 vol.% glycerol-water solution or H2 reduction at 500 ℃, the Cu-O feature disappeared and was replaced by an intense peak at 2.18 Å corresponding to first Cu-Cu shell in metallic fcc copper [95]. Some additional structure was also seen in the R-space plots at larger radial distances, which associated with the second, third and fourth copper coordination shells [80, 96]. The Cu K-edge data thus provides conclusive evidence for CuO reduction to Cu0 under the conditions of glycerol photoreforming under UV, and also with heating in a hydrogen atmosphere."
10,In-situ EPR experiment,"3.3 In-situ EPR experiment Since EPR is widely used to study paramagnetic CuO, we also carried out an in-situ EPR experiment on the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst under conditions comparable to those used in the alcohol photoreforming photocatalytic tests. We first collected EPR spectra for P25 TiO2 and the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst under a N2 atmosphere, before and after UV irradiation for 30 min (Fig. 4 (a)). For the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst, the intensity of the Cu2+ signal decreased slightly after the UV treatment, indicating that a small fraction of the CuO may have been reduced to Cu2O or Cu. However, if the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was UV irradiated for 30 min in a 10 vol.% glycerol-Chelex water mixture (Fig. 7(b)), the intensity of the Cu2+ signal decreased by around 75 %. If the UV irradiation had been continued for 1 h, it is anticipated that the Cu2+ signal would have completely disappeared, as was seen by Cu K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 3) and the in–situ UV–vis alcohol photoreforming experiments below (Fig. 5 below). The use here of Chelex water for the EPR experiments likely slowed the CuO to Cu0 reduction kinetics slightly. Results again highlight the key role of the alcohol sacrificial agent in promoting CuO reduction."
11,In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments under conditions of alcohol photoreforming,"3.4 In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments under conditions of alcohol photoreforming During photocatalytic H2 production tests in different alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2), it was noticed that the CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst turned a dark colour suggesting the in-situ reduction of surface CuO to Cu0 (and confirmed by the Cu K-edge XAS data in Fig. 3). This motivated a detailed in-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy study examining the changes in the optical properties of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst in different alcohol-water mixtures under UV excitation (i.e. conditions relevant to alcohol photoreforming studies below). Fig. 5 shows UV–vis absorbance spectra for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst in pure water and various alcohol-water systems, before and after UV irradiation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2) for periods up to 1 h. In pure water (Fig. 5(a)), no reduction of CuO to Cu0 occurred. The only change seen in the absorbance spectra with UV irradiation was the appearance of a weak feature at ∼500 nm due to Ti3+ formation on oxygen vacancies. However, when 10 vol.% alcohol-water systems were used in the experiment (Fig. 5(b)-(e)), very rapid reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 was observed evidenced by the appearance of an intense Cu LSPR peak at 582−594 nm [97,98], even after UV irradiation for periods as short as 10 min. At 10 vol.% alcohol, the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu0 was extremely rapid in aqueous methanol (Fig. 5(b)), aqueous ethylene glycol (Fig. 5(d)) and aqueous glycerol (Fig. 5(e)), but noticeably slower in aqueous ethanol (Fig. 5(c)). Further, the rate of CuO reduction to Cu0 was slower in 2 vol.% glycerol (Fig. 5(f)) than in 10 vol.% glycerol (Fig. 5(e)). Results hint at the key role of the alcohol sacrificial agent in promoting the reduction of supported CuO to Cu0 nanoparticles during alcohol photoreforming. To explain this, and the fact the negligible Cu0 formation occurred when the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was immersed in water and UV irradiated, the redox potentials involved in CuO reduction to Cu0 need to be considered. The CuO/Cu redox couple is located at -0.42 V versus NHE, very close to the conduction band minimum of anatase (-0.5 V). Thus, there is not much of a thermodynamic driving force for electrons photoexcited in TiO2 to migrate onto CuO to facilitate reduction to Cu0. Hence, the kinetics of CuO/TiO2 conversion to Cu0/TiO2 are very slow in water under UV excitation. However, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of an alcohol sacrificial agent. The photo-oxidation of these alcohols proceeds via the initial formation of alpha-hydroxy radical intermediates, which are very powerful electron donors. The formation of these alpha hydroxy intermediates can potentially occur via two main mechanisms in our system, as described by the following equations (using methanol as a representative example) [47,99]. (1) TiO2 + hν → TiO2 (h+ + e−) (photoexcitation of TiO2) (2) CH3OH + h+ → ·CH2OH + H+ (direct alpha-hydroxy radical formation) (3) H2O + h+ → ·OH + H+ (hydroxyl radical formation) (4) ·OH + CH3OH →·CH2OH + H2O (indirect alpha-hydroxy radical formation) The HCHO/·CH2OH redox couple has a potential of around -0.76 V versus NHE [47,100], far more negative than either the CuO/Cu redox couple or the bottom of the TiO2 conduction band (note: the alpha hydroxy radicals formed from ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation are even more potent reductants than the alpha-hydroxy radical obtained from methanol oxidation). Due to alpha-hydroxy radical generation during alcohol photoreforming, and thus the big potential gap (0.34 V) generated between the HCHO/·CH2OH and CuO/Cu redox couples, the supported CuO nanoparticles in the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst will be very rapidly reduced to Cu0 nanoparticles, exactly as was seen in the in-situ UV–vis spectroscopy experiments of Fig. 5 and by Cu K-edge EXAFS in Fig. 3. The reduction of supported CuO can thus be represented as follows: (5) CuO + 2·CH2OH → Cu0 + 2 HCHO + H2O After all the supported CuO has been reduced to Cu0, the alpha-hydroxy radicals subsequently can donate electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, thus creating the potential for current doubling (i.e. absorption of one UV photon by TiO2 creates two conduction band electrons in TiO2, and thus one molecule of H2 out). The key role of alpha-hydroxy radicals in modifying the valence state of supported co-catalysts in semiconductor photocatalysis has received little attention to date, but clearly deserves deep consideration in the context of the nature of the true active sites of copper co-catalysts in alcohol photoreforming. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report in-situ UV–vis data for Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts under conditions approximating practical alcohol photoreforming."
12,In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments examining the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by H2 reduction of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst,"3.5 In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments examining the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by H2 reduction of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst Since H2 reduction treatments were also effective in reducing the titania supported CuO to Cu0 (c.f. Fig. 3), we conducted a detailed UV–vis absorption study of the effect of the H2 reduction temperature on the optical properties of the obtained 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts. Reduction temperature selected for this study range from 200−600 ℃. Following reduction for 2 h at a specified temperature, we immediately characterized the samples by XRD (Fig. S3 and S4), XPS (Fig. S6) and UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. 6 ). Powder XRD patterns for the resulting 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts obtained by H2 reduction at 500 ℃ was not able to definitively confirm the formation of Cu0 (due to the low Cu loading), though Cu0 peaks were seen for 4 wt.% Cu/TiO2 and 8 wt.% Cu/TiO2 prepared in the same manner (Fig. S3 and S4). Cu 2p XPS spectra for the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst prepared by H2 reduction at 500 ℃ are shown in Fig. S5. Three different areas were studied on a pellet of the sample that had been H2 reduced at 500 ℃ for 2 h. In the first few scans over the Cu 2p region, peak due to Cu2+ and Cu0/Cu+ were seen [85]. The Cu2+ species probably formed as a results of sample oxidation through brief air exposure before introduction in the XPS system. As the number of accumulated scans increased at each site on the sample (up to 45 scans were collected), X-ray beam damage caused the reduction of the Cu2+ species to Cu0 or Cu+ (these are almost indistinguishable by Cu 2p XPS, with Cu 2p3/2 binding energies of 932.7 and 932.8 eV, respectively). Results indicate that Cu 2p XPS is not especially useful or reliable for gauging the oxidation state of Cu in Cu/TiO2 systems unless extreme care is taken to avoid X-ray beam damage [57,71,89,90]. UV–vis spectroscopy is therefore a very useful method for studying the speciation of copper on TiO2 photocatalysts, since the Cu LSPR features are quite intense even at low Cu loadings, and electron-beam or X-ray induced sample damage is avoided. Fig. 6(a) shows UV–vis absorbance spectra for the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts obtained by H2 reduction of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst at temperatures between 200−600 °C for 2 h. All the samples showed strong absorption below 400 nm due to P25 TiO2 support. In addition, a new intense feature appeared in the visible/NIR regions, which progressively blue-shifted from 707 nm to 615 nm as the H2 reduction temperature increased from 200 to 600 ℃ (Fig. 4(b), Table 1 ). The appearance of the new feature coincided with a change in the visible colour of the sample from light blue-green (typical for 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2) to very dark blue (for 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 in air, see Fig. 4(b) inset). The new feature can readily be attributed to the Cu0 LSPR absorption of supported Cu0 nanoparticles. The position of Cu LSPR peaks depends on the Cu nanoparticle size, shape, dispersion and surrounding medium [97,98,101–105]. The blue shift and sharpening of the LSPR feature as the H2 reduction temperature increased suggested that larger and more monodisperse Cu0 nanoparticles were being formed at the higher temperatures. Evidence to support this conclusion was seen in Cu0 nanoparticle re-oxidation experiments below. In addition to the Cu0 LSPR feature, H2 reduction treatments resulted in the appearance of another broad feature at ∼500 nm. This is attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the P25 TiO2 support (creating Ti3+ states). A final point to note, the full-width at half maximum of the Cu LSPR features seen for the photocatalysts reduced in H2 (Fig. 6(a), with the spectra being collected collected in air immediately after the H2 reduction treatment) were much broader than the corresponding LSPR feature for supported Cu0 nanoparticles prepared by photoreduction (Fig. 5). This is explained by the effect of the surrounding dielectric medium (alcohol-water mixture) during the acquistion the data of Fig. 5."
13,In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments examining reoxidation of the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts in air,"3.6 In-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy experiments examining reoxidation of the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts in air The reoxidation of titania-supported Cu0 nanoparticles with air exposure complicates the identification of the true active co-catalyst species responsible for H2 evolution during alcohol photoreforming and other reactions. Much of the conjecture in the literature relating to Cu/TiO2 systems originates from post reaction reoxidation of metallic copper nanoparticles formed during the reaction. Little kinetic information is currently available about the oxidation kinetics of Cu0 nanoparticles on TiO2, motivating a detailed investigation here. The 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts obtained by H2 reduction of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst at 200−600 ℃ were placed in the holder of the integrating sphere attachment of our UV–vis spectrometer, and UV–vis spectra recorded as a function of time with sample exposure to air. The spectra obtained Fig. S6(a)-(e). Results show that the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 samples reduced at higher temperatures took longer to completely reoxidize in air, as summarized in Fig. S6(f). This is explained by larger Cu0 nanoparticles forming at the higher reduction temperatures, thus requiring more time for complete re-oxidation to CuO [56]. The UV–vis spectra for the fully reoxidized 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts were almost identical to that of the as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. S7). Table 1 summarizes the physicochemical data for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2, 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 and reoxidized Cu/TiO2 photocatalysts, including BET specific surface areas and relevant optical properties. Some H2 production data is also presented for the samples in 10 vol.% glycerol under UV excitation, and is discussed below."
14,Photocatalytic H2 production via alcohol photoreforming,"3.7 Photocatalytic H2 production via alcohol photoreforming The characterization studies above conclusively demonstrate that during alcohol photoreforming, the as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was fully reduced to a 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst (i.e. Cu0 nanoparticles are the active form of the co-catalyst under reaction conditions). Fig. 7 (a)-(d) show plots of H2 production versus time for the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst (formed in-situ) in methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol and glycerol-water mixtures of different concentration, respectively, under UV excitation (365 nm, 6.5 mW cm−2). In each alcohol-water system, and at each alcohol concentration (0−100 vol.%), the Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst demonstrated very stable activity, evidenced by the linearity of the plots and the small error bars determined from triplicate measurements under the same testing conditions. Longer experiments conducted over a 12 h period in selected alcohol-water mixtures (10 vol.% alcohol) showed the same linear rates (data not shown). H2 production rates extracted from the plots in Fig. 7 are presented in Tables 2–5 and plotted in Fig. 8 . The data shows that H2 production rates in each individual alcohol-water system were strongly dependent on the alcohol concentration, with the optimum rates of 23.2, 19.9, 20.3 and 20.5 mmol g-1 h-1 achieved in aqueous methanol (50 vol.%), aqueous ethanol (80 vol.%), aqueous ethylene glycol (40 vol.%) and aqueous glycerol (20 vol.%), respectively. Results indicate that alcohol structure and also the physical properties of the different alcohol-water systems plays an important role in H2 production (this is explored in detail below). Photocatalytic H2 production rates for the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalyst are summarized and compared in Fig. 9 and Tables 2–5. For the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst, the optimum rates of hydrogen evolution (29.7, 32.4, 26.4 and 32.7 mmol g-1 h-1) were achieved in 40 vol.% methanol, 80 vol.% ethanol 20 vol.% ethylene glycol and 15 vol.% glycerol, respectively. Overall, this trend was very similar to the Cu/TiO2 system. The progressive downward shift of the optimal alcohol concentration for H2 production on going from methanol, to ethylene glycol, to glycerol (all these alcohols have an O/C ratio of 1) is understood by considering the corresponding alcohol reforming reactions (Table S2, where the stoichiometric molar ratios of H2O:alcohol are 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, respectively) and also solution viscosity (Fig. S8), since aqueous solutions of ethylene glycol and glycerol become highly viscous at alcohol concentrations above 20 vol.% [106,107]. If the viscosity of the reaction medium becomes too high, the transport of water to the TiO2 surface or protons to cathodic Cu0 and Au0 sites will be serious impaired, thus reducing H2 evolution rates. Comparing the performance of the 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in the four different alcohol-water systems, a couple of interesting points emerge for discussion. Firstly, the two photocatalysts show the same general behaviour in each-alcohol water system, with similar optimal alcohol concentrations for H2 production (Fig. 9). Thus, the behaviour with alcohol concentration in largely is largely independent of the metal co-catalyst (i.e. both Cu0 and Au0 behave similarly). Secondly, Au0 is a slightly better co-catalyst than Cu0. This is not unexpected, since the MH bond strength for gold is closer to the optimum value for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than that of copper [12,108–111]. It should be noted that the rates of H2 production reported here for the Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst are some of the highest yet reported for a non-precious metal containing photocatalyst system (cf. Table S1), confirming the enormous potential of Cu0 nanoparticles as a low cost co-catalyst for promoting H2 evolution on TiO2 surfaces under UV excitation."
15,Effect of alcohol structure and alcohol physical properties on photocatalytic H2 production rates at low alcohol concentrations,"3.8 Effect of alcohol structure and alcohol physical properties on photocatalytic H2 production rates at low alcohol concentrations By studying H2 production rates at low alcohol concentrations (e.g. 10 vol.% where all four of the alcohol-water systems studied in this work had viscosities of a few centipoise), some useful information can be garnered about the relative merits of the different alcohol sacrificial agents in promoting photocatalytic H2 production). At the fixed alcohol concentration of 10 vol.%, H2 production rates for both the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts decreased in the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol. Respective H2 production rates for Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts were 17.6 mmol g−1 h−1 and 30.3 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% glycerol; 15.5 and 26.4 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% ethylene glycol; 10.7 and 16.9 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% methanol; and 9.6 and 10.3 mmol g−1 h−1 in 10 vol.% ethanol. To explain the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol seen in the H2 production rates, the structural and physical properties of the different alcohols need to be considered. Table S3 summarizes key physical data for the four alcohols used as sacrificial agents in the current study. Following previous studies [20,21,53], we plotted H2 production rates for the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts determined at an alcohol concentration of 10 vol.% against selected physical properties of the alcohols. The resulting plots are shown in Fig. 10 . In all cases, reasonable linear relationships could be established. The justification for these linear relations is as follows. In aqueous solution, alcohol photo-oxidation proceeds via the formation of alpha hydroxyl radicals [46,112], making the presence of alpha hydrogen (α-H) atoms on the alcohol critical to achieving high rates of H2 production (Fig. 10(a)). The number of hydroxyl groups on the alcohol influences the relative ease of alcohol photoreforming to CO2, with alcohols such as methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol (O/C = 1) being easier to fully oxidize than ethanol (O/C = 0.5). This explains the linear relationships seen between H2 production rate and the number of OH groups on the alcohol (Fig. 10 (b)) and alcohol polarity (Fig. 10(c)). The relative ease of oxidation of the different alcohols can be gauged from the standard oxidation potentials for alcohol photoreforming (Tables S2 and S3), explaining the reasonable linear dependencies seen in Fig. 10(d). Similar trends were observed at a fixed molar concentration of alcohol (Table S4, Fig. S9 and S10). The rationale for the plot shown in Fig. 10(d) deserves a bit more explanation. As stated above, the standard oxidation potentials (Eox o) for the reforming of four alcohols were calculated using standard Gibbs free energies of formation (ΔfGo) for each alcohol (Table S2) [113]. Intuitively, glycerol and ethylene glycol afforded the highest H2 production rates in the current study which reflected their lower standard oxidation potentials, thus making them the better sacrificial hole scavengers. According to Marcus theory, the rate constant (k) for simple electron transfer reaction is proportional to exp-(Eacceptor o – Edonor o), where Eacceptor o and Edonor o are the potentials of the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively. Thus, in Fig. 10(d), we plotted the natural logarithm of H2 production rates (normalized against alcohol polarity) against the exp-(EVB(TiO2) o - Eox o), where EVB(TiO2) o is the valence band level of anatase (+2.7 V versus NHE) and Eox o is the standard oxidation potential of the alcohol (electron donor), following the method developed by Al-Azri et al. [21]. Reasonable linear relationships resulted for both the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, suggesting that simple electron transfer reactions were likely rate limiting factor in photocatalytic H2 production in the different alcohol-water systems when viscosity effects were negligible (e.g. 10 vol.%). These electron-transfer reactions were likely mediated by ·OH radicals generated on the surface of TiO2 by the reaction of water with valence band holes. Finally, for many photoreactions the quantum efficiency (QE) provides a useful tool for quantitative comparisons of photocatalyst performance [114,115]. H2 production rates determined for the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts in 10 vol.% alcohol-water mixtures were used to calculate the quantum efficiencies for the photoreforming of each alcohol (see supporting information). For the Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst, QE values of 15.1 %, 13.6 %, 21.9 % and 24.9 % were determined in 10 vol.% methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol, respectively. The corresponding QE values for the Au/TiO2 photocatalyst were 23.9 %, 14.6 %, 36.5 % and 42.9 %, respectively. In both the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 systems, the QEs achieved in this work are quite high, indicating that our photocatalyst testing system and photocatalyst loadings were well-optimized to allowing effective UV photon utilization. These QE calculations neglect current doubling, the process whereby the alpha-hydoxy radicals generated during the initial stages of alcohol photoreforming donate an electron into the conduction band of TiO2, thus “doubling” the number of CB electrons per valence band hole created through photo-oxidation under UV. If current doubling was significant under the conditions of the alcohol photorefroming experiments reported here, the actual quantum efficiencies for H2 production will be lower than those reported in the supporting information."
16,Conclusion,"Alcohol photoreforming over 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 and 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 photocatalysts under UV excitation were systematically studied and compared. In the presence of alcohol sacrificial agents, the supported CuO in an as-prepared 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was very rapidly reduced to 1−2 nm Cu0 nanoparticles, thus giving 1 wt.% Cu/TiO2 as the “real” working photocatalyst. Cu0 nanoparticles were very effective co-catalysts for promoting H2 evolution during alcohol photoreforming in methanol-water, ethanol-water, ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water systems, affording H2 production rates of at least 19 mmol g−1 h−1 in each alcohol water system at the optimal alcohol concentration (the optimum concentration depended on the alcohol). At a fixed alcohol concentration of 10 vol.%, H2 production rates for the Cu/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 photocatalysts followed the order glycerol > ethylene glycol > methanol > ethanol, which was rationalized in terms of the structure and standard oxidation potentials of the different alcohols. Au/TiO2 was a superior photocatalyst to Cu/TiO2 for H2 production via alcohol photoreforming (10–20 % better in most alcohol-water systems tested herein). Nevertheless, results confirm that Cu0 is a very promising alternative co-catalyst to expensive noble metal-based co-catalysts (Pd, Pt, Au) for activating TiO2 for solar H2 production in alcohol-water mixtures."
