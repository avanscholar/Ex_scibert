0,Introduction,"The generation of carbon-free electricity and the production of low-carbon fuels are urgent needs that must be addressed as the global concentration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is rapidly increasing. According to the most recent report published by the International Energy Agency (EIA) in 2018, the global energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 and rose to the historic high value of 33.1 Gt CO2 [1]. Although CO2 emissions from all sectors increased consistently, the power sector alone accounted for two-thirds of emission growth. The amount of CO2 emissions by burning coal for power generation exceeded 10 Gt. Notably, only three countries, China, India, and the U.S.,were responsible for more than 85% of the net emission increases in 2018. For China and India this can be attributed to their constant economic development. For the U.S. however, other than a steady increase in oil consumption and higher economic growth in 2018, other factors such as changes in energy policy and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may play a role in the increase of emissions [2]. Nevertheless, longer term emission studies could reveal the magnitude and importance of the impact that such a change in U.S. policy will have in terms of the nation's CO2 emissions. One method of forecasting the CO2 emissions of various countries is by examining their Human Development Index (HDI) and per capita electricity consumption. The HDI analysis of various countries shows that there is a direct relationship between the energy consumption of a nation and its HDI. As shown in Figure 1 , the countries that have an HDI value of more than 0.9 consume the greatest energy per capita. For example, China and India consume 4,292 and 818 kWh/year-person, respectively, while this number is close to 12,000 kWh/year-person for the U.S. The minimum energy requirement for a country to have an HDI of at least 0.9 is approximately 5,000 kWh/year-person, which is associated with the U.K.; therefore, if all the developed countries in the world with an HDI of 0.9 and above reduce their electricity consumption to 5,000 kWh/year-person and only India and China increase theirs to the same amount, this results in a net annual increase of 2.4 Gt in CO2 emissions. Hence, as long as countries rely on fossil fuels for generating their electricity without implementing carbon capture and sequestration units, the global CO2 emissions are only going to rise in the coming decades. Despite constant improvements in fuel efficiency, development of less carbon intensive biofuels, developments in hybrid and electric vehicles, and more stringent environmental policies, global CO2 emissions from transport sector increased by 2% in 2016 compared to the previous year. Figure 2 -a shows the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions by each sector worldwide and Figure 2-b further breaks down the emissions associated with each mode of the transportation sector for U.S. emissions only due to lack of information on other nations. Although the U.S. had the greatest transport emissions in 2016, the rate of increase of the emissions from this sector are significantly higher in Asia with an alarming rate of 4.5%. Electricity & heat generation, transportation, and industrial sectors together produce more than 80% of the energy-related CO2 emissions. In the transportation sector alone, CO2 emissions increased by an annual global average rate of 2.5% between 2010 and 2015 [5]. In 2016, the transportation sector emitted approximately 8 GtCO2 which accounted for roughly 25% of total global emissions (up from 23% in 2012). This number is 71% larger than the sector's emissions in 1990 (2.8 Gt CO2) and 19% larger than the sector's emissions in 2010 (6.7 Gt CO2). Nearly 74% of the transportation-related emissions are sourced exclusively from road vehicles [3]. As shown in Figure 2, this number is even larger for the U.S. In the U.S. the total CO2 emissions associated with passenger vehicles and heavy trucks is approximately 83% [4]. Without the implementation of significant mitigation policies, CO2 emissions from the transportation sector are projected to reach 9.3-12 GtCO2/yr by 2050 which will be an increase between 16-50% compared to 2016 [6]. The solutions proposed for mitigating climate change effects are deployment of low-carbon fuels and improving the efficiency of current technologies for energy conversion. Hydrogen fuels from low-carbon energy resources are viewed as a promising long-term option for tackling CO2 emissions from distributed sources. The use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the industrial, residential, and transportation sectors can help to achieve these goals. In particular, the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) has the potential to virtually eliminate CO2 emissions from tailpipes. If only 25% of vehicles were replaced by HFCVs, overall emissions from the transportation sector could be reduced by 10% [7] and curtail the emissions of NOx and SOx and particulate matter by 70-80% [8]. Moreover, hydrogen can be used to supply a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to generate electricity, which only produces water as a byproduct [9]. Until the 1960s hydrogen was used in the form of town gas for street lighting and also as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and lighting homes [8]. Today, the same concept can be extended to use on demand renewably generated hydrogen for powering a single family home with near zero emissions and noise-free fuel [10]. According to a recent work by Stern [10], a large 160-cell hydrogen generator can be employed to provide the total required energy for a single family home including power for appliances, lighting, electronics, and electric heat pumps for heating and cooling. A similar generator could be used to support the energy requirements of a small commercial entity such as a bank or pharmacy. Currently, hydrogen is primarily produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas and consequently, CO2 is generated and subsequently released into the atmosphere due to the process. However, sustainable hydrogen production combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology could be a possible strategy for addressing CO2 generated from the transportation sector [11]. For instance, using an alternative technology to SMR with pressure swing adsorption (PSA) for H2 production such as a membrane reactor (MR) has the potential to lead to H2 production on demand with subsequent CO2 storage on the vehicle [12,13]. Over the past 60 years, MR technology for H2 production has advanced significantly. The rapid growth of research in this area can be judged by a significant increase in citations in recent years. As a special field of interest, metallic membranes, specifically Pd and its alloys, have been heavily investigated in the hydrogen separation field due to their peculiar characteristic to allow for only hydrogen permeation making possible to produce a stream up to 99.999+% purity [14–16]. These advantageous characteristics could make metallic membranes and MRs suitable for onsite hydrogen production and separation to satisfy distributed hydrogen demands for mobile and small-scale systems. However, despite several decades of research, most metallic membranes have remained at the pilot scale due to uncertain economic feasibility and competitiveness at a large scale. Although the scientific literature on this topic is exceptionally rich, only few scientific studies have focused on the analysis of the costs, opportunities and challenges associated with industrial feasibility. Therefore, the aim of this review is to assess the potential and feasibility of metallic membranes and MRs toward utilization for hydrogen separation and production at high purity as well as to highlight the challenges that need to be overcome for accelerating widespread hydrogen use. Moreover, a comparison between metallic membranes and alternative hydrogen production and separation technologies is presented and discussed."
1,"Current status of hydrogen production, purification, and usage",
2,Economics and scale,"2.1 Economics and scale According to a recent study by Dou et al., the global hydrogen market was estimated at $80 billion in 2015 and is expected to rise up to $1.6 trillion by 2050. Additionally, the study predicts that the market infrastructure will rise to $300 billion in 2030 and remain stable at this value until 2050 [17]. The primary market driver for the hydrogen economy is expected to come from HFCVs at a market value of $1.0 trillion in 2050, while the market value of stationary hydrogen power generation is expected to rise to $200 billion during the same timeframe. Roughly 60% of the global hydrogen market share will be in North America, Europe, and China by 2050 [17]. Another potential area that could drive the hydrogen market in the near future is the concept of power-to-x (P2X). P2X can be defined as processes for conversion of electricity, specifically electricity that is generated from renewable energy resources such as wind or solar, into various products and/or applications to chemically store the electric energy during the low demand times and either use the products as feedstock for the production of other chemicals or convert them back to electricity during the peak demand periods. The letter “X” in the terminology could refer to gas, chemicals, fuel, methane, methanol, hydrogen, etc [18–20]. Among the P2X technologies, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) process is one of the most attractive ones where renewable or “green” hydrogen can be produced through water electrolysis with renewable electricity. Hence, P2H could be the crucial link which closes the gap between renewable electricity generation and large scale electricity storage [18]. It should be noted that P2H can be considered a low carbon energy concept, only if the electricity used in this process is supplied from non-fossil based and renewable energy resources such as wind or solar. In doing so, P2X can be considered as an approach that incorporates renewable energy into sectors such as transportation and industry. However, it should be noted that although P2H technologies have the potential to lower the carbon emissions, there are other environmental concerns associated with these chains that need to be taken into account. For instance, these technologies require significant amount of materials such as steel, nickel, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) i i It should be noted that PTFE is not required for all electrolysis techniques. for use in electrolysis electrodes. Although not explicitly limited to the P2X technologies, there are other major environmental concerns that require further attention when considering P2X chains. Hence, the implementation of P2X, like any other new technology, should be guided by accurate sustainability assessments taking into account the environmental concerns such as ozone depletion, acidification, and human toxicity [19]. Another challenge associated with the P2H technologies is the difficulty for storage and transport of hydrogen. This challenge could be addressed by producing hydrogen in the proximity of chemical plants where it can be used as a feedstock for production of other chemicals such as ammonia. Currently, the use of hydrogen in the electricity and transportation sectors in the U.S. is still developing. However, the expectations for its evolution and utilization in the short term are evident in the stated objectives of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE). Funding in this area reached a peak of approximately $270 million in 2008, with a low of $109 million in 2014. For the fiscal year 2017, the research budget saw an increase to $122 million [21]. The aim of the program is to fund research and development efforts to assess the viability of widespread implementation of fuel cell technologies and a hydrogen energy infrastructure, ultimately in an effort to reduce the use of fossil fuels, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improve air quality [21]. The global demand for hydrogen is expected to remain constant up to 2025 at the current rate of 3.5% per year [22]. The current annual hydrogen production capacity in U.S. refineries is approximately 15.8 million tonnes. Of this volume, 3.3 million tonnes is captive by-product hydrogen and 2 million tonnes is combusted for heat generation. Hence, the total hydrogen capacity in the U.S. from conventional captive (hydrogen that is produced for internal use on the same site, such as oil refineries) and merchant (hydrogen that is produced by a producer and sold as a commodity and delivered to the consumer by pipeline, bulk tank or cylinder) markets is approximately 11.0 million tonnes per year [23]. Nearly 95% of this amount is produced by the SMR process [24]. Globally, approximately 50 million tonnes of hydrogen is produced each year [25,26]. Roughly 48% comes from SMR, 30% from petroleum reforming, 18% from coal gasification, and 4% from water electrolysis [27]. Hydrogen can be used in industrial processes for ammonia and methanol synthesis, fossil fuel hydrocracking, metal production, or as a fuel for HFCVs and rockets [17,25]. Approximately 55% of global hydrogen production is used in ammonia plants and 35% in petroleum refining industries. The other end-use sectors include the electronics industry, metal/glass industries, the food industry, pharmaceuticals, etc. [28,29]. The breakdown of the hydrogen market end-use is shown in Figure 3 . The chemical manufacturing sector has a market share of approximately 63%. Synthesis of ammonia requires high volumes of hydrogen and this process alone uses more than half of the hydrogen market share. Refineries have the second largest market share. In the last two decades, refineries have become net hydrogen consumers [28,31,32] with typical capacities from 10,000 to 100,000 m3/h [33], accounting for 30% of the total hydrogen market. Hydrogen is required for many operations in petrochemical processing such as hydrotreating (where it is used for hydrodesulphurization, hydroisomerization and hydrogenation of aromatics and olefins) and hydrocracking (where it breaks down large hydrocarbons into smaller, and higher-value molecules) [34]. Until recently, hydrogen was available internally to industrial processes as a co-product from catalytic reforming of aromatics [31,32]. Today there is stricter control of gasoline aromatic composition, and therefore less hydrogen is produced within refineries, limiting its availability [31,33,35]. Ultimately, this has catalyzed the push for refiners to increase the efficiency of their hydrogen production systems. Approximately 64% of hydrogen consumed in the industrial sector is “captive” hydrogen which is produced and consumed on-site. Furthermore, the hydrogen that is produced as a by-product of industrial processes, is also commercialized, and makes up 27% of the hydrogen market [36]. Based on today's method of production, hydrogen does not represent a shift away from fossil fuels, nor does it present itself as a complete solution to climate change [8,25]. In order to address climate change concerns, alternative methods for hydrogen production such as electrolysis and photovoltaic water splitting, with renewable sources of electricity, can be used to produce hydrogen rather than producing hydrogen using fossil fuels such as natural gas. However, some of these methods consume significant amount of electricity, could suffer from toxicity ii ii This could be an issue in photo-reduction technologies, the products that are generated in photo arsenic electrodes.[37] of the generated products, and others such as photovoltaic water splitting, have low efficiency and have a very high production cost compared with the reforming process [37]. Nevertheless, there is ongoing research for alternative methods and devices to produce high-purity hydrogen, such as the new method and device invented by Ham et al., to produce hydrogen in a dry reforming process using available methane and CO2 in biogas [38]. Moreover, a significant infrastructure expansion would be valuable toward supporting its use as a transportation or grid fuel [39,40]. One of the biggest challenges that the hydrogen economy faces is the imbalance between hydrogen supply and demand. The current global production volumes of hydrogen cannot support a smooth transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to HFCVs. More specifically, in order to replace all the gasoline engine vehicles in the U.S. solely by HFCVs, the daily amount of produced hydrogen should be approximately 0.34 million tonnes or 124 million tonnes per year. This value is more than twice the current hydrogen that is consumed on a global scale and more than 10 times the current annual U.S. production [25]. The other significant challenge is hydrogen delivery and transportation. Although hydrogen can “potentially” be transported via pipelines like natural gas, the pipelines used for natural gas transport are not suitable for hydrogen delivery due to serious challenges arising from hydrogen leakage and metal embrittlement under the high-pressure conditions required [25]. Furthermore, 1.2% of hydrogen energy will be used every 150 km to power the compressors which is 4 times the amount of natural gas used for the same purpose, i.e. 0.3% [41]. High costs of pipeline delivery and distribution, material handling losses, increased traffic congestion, and safety issues associated with highly flammable and explosive hydrogen gas are some of the biggest concerns that will need to be addressed thoroughly for successful deployment of hydrogen energy [25,41,42]. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis of hydrogen energy in China indicates the strengths of a hydrogen economy include:[43] • Abundant resources to produce hydrogen from: coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, waste water, wind, hydropower, solar etc. • Great development potential (transportation and communication) • Environmental benefits (as the greatest CO2 emitter, China needs to reform its energy structure toward more renewable and clean resources to address the ever-increasing problem of the air pollution in its major cities) In the same report, the weaknesses of hydrogen energy are listed as following: • High cost • Lack of key technologies (China currently lacks the state-of-the-art technologies and infrastructures to use renewable sources such as wind and solar for hydrogen production) • Lack of the appropriate infrastructure (refueling and transportation infrastructure are missing) Although this SWOT analysis is performed for the Chinese market, many of its elements such as abundance, environmental friendliness, costs, and lack of infrastructure are valid for other countries as well, including the U.S."
3,Current industrial production and separation technologies,"2.2 Current industrial production and separation technologies The SMR is currently the dominant industrial method for hydrogen production where methane and steam react over a catalyst to produce a mixture of H2 and CO2 [12,44–53]. SMR has developed into specifically tailored processes, consisting of a conventional reformer followed by two water-gas shift (WGS) reactors (i.e., high temperature shift (HTS) and low temperature shift (LTS)) and equipment for H2 separation and purification, with PSA being the dominant technique. Figure 4 shows a schematic of the entire process. The reaction between methane and steam takes place in the reformer at harsh operating conditions due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Specifically, the operating temperature and pressure ranges between 800 °C to 1000 °C and 15 to 20 bar, respectively [54]. (1) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O ⇄ C O 2 + 4 H 2 (2) C H 4 + H 2 O ⇄ C O + 3 H 2 The stream exiting the reformer contains a hydrogen-rich gas mixture with substantial CO content (generally higher than 5 vol.%) [55], which may be suppressed by the WGS reaction: (3) C O + H 2 O ⇄ C O 2 + H 2 This reaction takes place in two reactors arranged in series since it is an exothermic reaction promoted at low temperature, but kinetically-limited at temperatures below ca. 200 °C [56]. Therefore, the first reactor (HTS) operates at high temperature between 310-450 °C and uses a high-temperature catalyst such as chromium-promoted iron oxide to favor the kinetics [57]. The second reactor (LTS) operates at low temperature in the range of 190 to 250 °C and uses a low-temperature catalyst of copper-promoted zinc oxide [58]. The outlet stream from the LTS reactor contains 86% H2, 12% CO2, 0.3-1% CO and 1.6% CH4 on a dry basis [59,60]. Therefore, in order to obtain high-grade hydrogen, different separation/purification steps using diverse technology can be used, as shown in Table 1. Each technology is chosen according to the hydrogen purity requirements for any specific process. For instance, cryogenic distillation, which uses the difference in boiling point temperatures of the species is a very energy intensive process [61] due to operating at very low temperatures and therefore does not allow for significant hydrogen purification [62]. However, cryogenic separation processes have better economies of scale compared to the other separation methods and can produce separate hydrocarbon streams rich in C4 +, ethane, propane, etc. [63]. Palladium-based membrane technology allows for high recovery and high purity of hydrogen. The primary challenges associated with Pd-based membranes for H2 production include their low tolerance for H2S and unsaturated hydrocarbons, high cost on a large scale due to the price of Pd, and low mechanical resistance [66]. Today, the most extensively used technology for large-scale production is the PSA process [62]. The PSA technology allows for variation in H2 purity making it tunable for a wide range of industrial applications [54]. Sorbents that are commonly used include activated carbon, silica gel, alumina and zeolite [67–69]. The PSA process operates at approximately 20-25 bar [70,71] and has a hydrogen separation efficiency of 85-90% [72]. Moreover, PSA technology has the ability to process large capacities of feed gas, i.e., on the order of 100,000 m3/h [73] while maintaining a hydrogen purity of 99.999+% [70]. More specifically, a 100,000 m3/h unit would produce 78,000 tonnes of H2 per year, which amounts to approximately 0.2% of annual global H2 production. iii iii Assume the operation is 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. While PSA has many benefits, it has the drawback of relatively low hydrogen recovery (approximately 70%) iv iv Hydrogen recovery is lower compared to other hydrogen separation techniques as a fraction of hydrogen is lost in the purging step.[65] [74]. The savings associated with using a dense Pd membrane and achieving a hydrogen recovery of 99% are worth noting. By using this technology, 36% less natural gas can be used to produce the same amount of hydrogen, resulting in an annual savings of 11,000 tonnes of natural gas and $2 million per PSA unit. Furthermore, more than 31,000 of CO2 emissions could be avoided annually. v v Assumptions: Natural gas is considered pure methane; PSA (90% conversion, 70% recovery); Membrane (99% conversion, 99% recovery); price of natural gas set at 3.268 $/MMBtu; Standard conditions are assumed to be 15.56 °C and 1.01325 bar; carbon emissions associated with burning natural gas are assumed to be 0.0053 tonnes of CO2/therm Recent studies have investigated alternative solutions to the conventional system, such as the adoption of membrane technology applied to the SMR reaction [75–91]. It has been demonstrated that the use of a hydrogen permeability-selective MR such as Pd-based MR [62,92] could allow for working at milder operating conditions and enhancing the performance of the SMR reaction, while additionally collecting high-purity hydrogen [93]. The interest in MR technology has grown due to its potential to provide significant process improvements such as operational simplicity, compatibility between different membrane operations in integrated systems, low energy requirements and environmental compatibility. Membrane technology provides process intensification by combining reaction and separation steps in a single device, while simultaneously achieving higher conversions and efficiencies compared to conventional separation and reaction operations [94]."
4,Hydrogen use and the role of metallic membranes,"2.3 Hydrogen use and the role of metallic membranes Hydrogen's clean combustion and high energy density (hydrogen has the highest mass energy density in all types of fossil fuels, 120 MJ/kg at its lower limit heating value) make it very attractive for sustainable development [17]. As a clean fuel, hydrogen can be used in cogeneration systems for industries and households to mitigate air pollution associated with other combustion fuels [17]. Most of the applications of hydrogen stem from its reactivity rather than its physical properties. One area that has been very attractive and has created significant momentum for research and development projects in the past 20 years [95] is the use of hydrogen in the HFCVs. HFCVs could be attractive to the customers as they combine the benefits of electric vehicles, like quietness and efficiency, with those of theICE vehicles, such as refueling time and driving range. Given the 700 bar on-board hydrogen storage requirement, a HFCV can be refueled within 3-5 minutes, which is enough for driving 400-500 km [96]. The energy conversion efficiency of HFCVs can be as high as 40-60% vi vi Efficiencies are based on higher heating values (HHV). It should be noted that for a power-to-fuel scenario where electricity is transformed into hydrogen, which is then used in a HFCV, the overall efficiency from well to wheel could be as low as 20-30% due to the losses in each conversion step from electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity.[98]In such scenarios, electric vehicles may be a better alternative to the HFCVs if the electricity is provided by renewable sources. while only 10-15% of the gasoline in the conventional ICE is converted to traction energy [97]. Table 2 shows a comparison between energy storage capacity, discharge time, and siting of hydrogen and other forms of energy storage. As can be seen, hydrogen is superior to all other forms of energy storage from both storage capacity and discharge duration. However, the fundamental issues stemming from the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen gas, make the development of HFCVs a challenging task. Hydrogen has a significantly lower volumetric fuel density compared to gasoline and diesel oil, which makes its delivery more difficult and costly. The feasible modes of transportation for hydrogen are via tube trailers, tanker trucks and pipelines. The only delivery method that makes hydrogen emission-free is pipeline transport [99]. One of the most important challenges that keeps HFCVs from being commercially available is the cost associated with onboard storage of hydrogen. A HFCV requires 4-7 kg of hydrogen to drive a distance of 480 km. Currently, a carbon-fiber composite tank pressurized to 700 bar is the best storage material for passenger vehicles which costs approximately $3,000 with today's technology [100]. One technology that may make a significant difference in making the hydrogen economy a reality in the coming decades is SMR combined with MR technology. This, however, requires major breakthroughs in membrane technology development. Industrial interest towards membrane technology has grown over the years. Currently, metallic membranes are already being used on an industrial scale in the semiconductor industry to produce high-purity hydrogen [101]. Commercial polymeric membranes have been effectively employed since 1979 [102] and currently compete with PSA and cryogenic separation on an industrial scale for recovering hydrogen from refineries, ammonia plants, and petrochemical manufacturing [103–105]. Polymeric membranes achieve high hydrogen purity reaching 95%, as reported in Table 1, which is usually adequate [106] for most petroleum refining applications. Nevertheless, for some catalytic processes such as ammonia synthesis and for supplying fuel cells, e.g., PEMFCs, ultra-high purity hydrogen of 99.99+% is required [107]. For these applications, Pd-based membranes could be employed due to their complete selectivity towards hydrogen permeation with respect to other gases. The performance of Pd-based alloy membranes has more recently been enhanced by decreasing the thickness of the metallic layer. The transition from a thick, unsupported membrane to a thin, supported membrane has led to economic benefits and higher purity hydrogen in the permeate. Despite recent improvements, they are still affected by relatively high cost due to membrane production and operation, especially at industrial scales [106], and compared to the polymeric membranes they are expected to be one to three orders of magnitude more expensive per unit surface area [104]. For example, spiral-wound turnkey membrane skids used in natural gas processing plants cost $500/m2 vii vii Polymer membrane cost was converted from 12.5 million dollars (2007 USD) for 25,000 m2. [108] [108], while the cost of one 50 µm-thick Pd membrane, would be ca. $5,500/m2 viii viii Cost of Pd was chosen for the cheapest price in 2010, and 10% of preparation cost is included.[109] [109]. Nevertheless, at the same pressure gradient, Pd-based membranes are characterized by superior selectivity and permeability, which can be ca.1000-10,000 times higher than polymeric membranes [110]. Therefore, the cost of metallic membranes based on the same amount of hydrogen permeating flux would yield a competitive result in comparison to polymeric membranes. One of the obstacles that Pd-based membranes could face at industrial scale is their inability to produce high flow rates of hydrogen compared with PSA technology which currently produces hydrogen flow rates as high as 10,000-100,000 m3/h [33], on a large-scale industrial basis. This problem inherently stems from the challenges associated with scaling up the MR technology. Although the process capacity may be expanded with additional membrane units to increase the hydrogen flow rate, it is not cost-effective for Pd-based membranes. However, Pd-based membranes may be suitable for small applications where the benefits of their performance outweigh the membrane cost [104]. Such applications, some of which are under development, include semiconductor manufacturing [111,112] and hydrogen fuel cells [113]."
5,Metallic membranes and recent progress,
6,Metallic membranes and hydrogen permeation,"3.1 Metallic membranes and hydrogen permeation Membranes used for H2 separation can be divided into four categories based on the materials used in their fabrication: polymeric, metallic, carbon, and ceramic. Polymeric membranes are organic while the other three classifications are considered inorganic membranes [62]. Dense metallic membranes such as Pd and Pt as well as the metallic elements of groups III-V are of special interest due to their capability to produce pure H2 in one single separation step with a low energy penalty [114]. The best candidates are Pd-based metallic membranes for producing high-purity hydrogen due to their “infinite” selectivity towards H2 permeation [115]. Hydrogen permeation through Pd is governed by the solution-diffusion mechanism which takes place in six steps [116,117]. Hydrogen transport through the Pd membrane can be either surface-limited or diffusion-limited. In thick membranes (δ > 100 µm), the rate-limiting step is usually the diffusion of hydrogen atoms through the bulk of Pd [118], while in thin membranes (δ < 1.0 µm) and at high operating pressures the rates of surface reactions dictate the rate of transport [109,118]. However, it is worth mentioning that at low temperatures the associative desorption of hydrogen atoms from the Pd surface become the rate-determining step, while at very low hydrogen partial pressures (<<1.0 bar), the adsorption of hydrogen atoms onto the Pd surface might become the rate-limiting step [119,120]. When the limiting step is hydrogen diffusion, the hydrogen permeating flux through the dense Pd-based membrane can be expressed by Sieverts-Fick's law: (4) J H 2 = P e H 2 ( p H 2 , r e t 0.5 − p H 2 , p e r m 0.5 ) δ where JH2 is the hydrogen permeating flux through the membrane, PeH2 is the permeability of the membrane, pH2,ret and pH2,perm are the partial pressure of hydrogen in the retentate and permeate sides, respectively, and δ is the membrane thickness. Permeability is an intrinsic property of the membrane and is independent of the thickness of the membrane or the partial pressure of hydrogen. In some instances, the “permeance” is used to characterize its performance and is defined as the ratio of permeability over thickness: (5) P H 2 = P e H 2 δ = J H 2 ( p H 2 , r e t 0.5 − p H 2 , p e r m 0.5 ) It is worth noting that permeance is mainly used to characterize a thin metallic film deposited on a porous support, while permeability is generally used for the characterization of unsupported membranes [109]. The membrane permeability is a function of temperature and may be described by an Arrhenius-type relationship [77,121–124]: (6) P e H 2 = P e H 2 0 e x p ( − E a R T ) Where Pe0 H2 is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the apparent activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Combining equations (4) and (6) yields the Richardson's equation [123,124]: (7) J H 2 = P e 0 H 2 exp ( − E a RT ) ( p H 2 , ret 0.5 − p H 2 , perm 0.5 ) δ This relationship highlights the proportionality of the hydrogen permeating flux to the membrane thickness, hydrogen partial pressure, and temperature, which need to be optimized to obtain a high hydrogen permeating flux. Although the Sieverts-Fick's law is fairly simple, there are numerous studies that undermine its validity and use the general empirical form where the hydrogen permeating flux is proportional to the partial pressure of hydrogen to the power of n [93,118,123,125]. (8) J H 2 = P H 2 ( p H 2 , ret n − p H 2 , perm n ) The empirical exponent n in equation (8) is a dependent factor which determines the correlation between the hydrogen permeating flux and the driving force (partial pressure of hydrogen on the retentate and permeate sides). The value of n, varies between 0.5 and 1.0 [87], and is usually evaluated using nonlinear regression technics [126]. Although controversial, the value of n has been used as a benchmark to determine the rate controlling steps. The deviation of n values from 0.5 may be explained by the deviation of the hydrogen solubility from the values proposed by Sieverts’ law, which may results from incorrect assumptions of the rate-determining steps, non-ideality of interstitial hydrogen diffusivity, or crystallographic phase transition [123]. In addition, a deviation from 0.5 indicates that the permeation of hydrogen may be influenced by a combination of other factors such as Pd surface impurities, bulk defects, i.e., organic contaminants from fabrication or pinholes, respectively [105,127]. Equation (8) is usually used to evaluate the permeation characteristics of composite membranes, which consist of a thin Pd-layer deposited on a porous support. Porous supports are typically porous stainless steel (PSS) or ceramic [128]. The benefits in the use of a PSS support are the mechanical and chemical resistance of the support, the thermal expansion of PSS being similar to that of Pd and ease in implementing it within a module. However, they suffer from intermetallic diffusion, rough surface area, and broad pore size distribution, which makes the deposition of a thin dense layer difficult. On the contrary, ceramic supports offer narrow pore size distribution, stability over a wide range of temperatures, and they are chemically inert. Nevertheless, they suffer from differing thermal expansion coefficients, high costs and difficulty in implementing within a module [64,128]. A common characteristic of Pd-based membranes is their ability to be completely hydrogen perm-selective with respect to all the other gases.The parameter commonly used to evaluate this feature is the ideal selectivity (α), which is defined as the ratio between the permeance of hydrogen to the permeance of a secondary gas [121]: (9) I d e a l S e l e c t i v i t y ( α H 2 / i ) = P H 2 / P i The benchmark for the development of hydrogen selective membranes and hydrogen production technologies is set by the U.S. DOE. Performance targets for dense metallic membranes are summarized in Table 3 ."
7,Pd-alloy membranes and costs,"3.2 Pd-alloy membranes and costs Alloy-based membranes have gained increasing interest due to their improved properties compared to pure Pd such as sulfur resistivity, thermal stability, and enhanced hydrogen permeability, as well as their generally lower material cost and decreased embrittlement tendency [109,130,131]. The abundance and cost of various metals that are commonly used to fabricate Pd-based alloy membranes for the purpose of hydrogen production are shown in Figure 5 . Furthermore, the permeability of these Pd alloy membranes at 350 °C and 2.2 MPa are depicted in Figure 6 . From these graphs it can be inferred that, alloying Pd with other metals offers a reasonable compromise between the material cost of the membrane and the permeability of hydrogen through the membrane. One of the most widely used Pd alloy membranes that has shown high permeability and stability is the Pd77%Ag23% membrane [132]. The hydrogen permeabilities of various Pd-based membranes reported in recent literature are shown in Table 4 . Since the permeability depends not only on the type of alloy but also on their composition, fabrication methods, and testing procedures, comparing permeabilities across different studies provides only an approximate trend. The most widely studied Pd-based alloy membranes are Pd-Ag, some of which are applied to MR technology [133–135]. In general, Pd-Ag membranes provide 1.5-2 times higher hydrogen permeability compared to pure Pd due to their increased hydrogen solubility. In addition, Pd-Ag membranes have demonstrated higher resistance against hydrogen embrittlement. Aside from enhancing membrane transport properties, another purpose of alloying is to improve chemical stability against sulfur contamination. The Pd-Cu alloy has achieved higher tolerance against sulfur contamination, with the permeability similar or slightly lower than that of pure Pd. The face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of the Pd-Cu alloy containing 30-60 wt.% Cu has been found to have increased tolerance against sulfur poisoning compared to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, in which hydrogen permeability has been found to remain constant at 1,000 ppm H2S exposure [136]. The extent of sulfur tolerance varies among the various studies reported in the literature. For instance, a concentration of 300 ppm of H2S completely inhibited hydrogen permeation through Pd-Cu membranes while only 100 ppm of H2S inhibited permeation in pure Pd membranes [137]. In addition, 80%, 20% and 1% loss in hydrogen permeation were reported for various Pd-Cu membranes at 50 ppm, 20 ppm and 5 ppm H2S, respectively [138–140]. Since these experimental results are compiled from different studies, the effect of H2S concentration may not appear as a quantitative correlation with the decrease in permeation, but the overall trend qualitatively shows the inhibition effect of H2S. In addition, Pd-Au alloy membranes with low Au compositions (<10 wt%) have also exhibited enhanced sulfur resistance [141]. The hydrogen permeation dropped to 15% of the initial flux at 55 ppm H2S, but soon recovered to 65% with hydrogen purging, whereas the hydrogen permeation through a pure Pd membrane was reduced to 7% under the same H2S concentration without recovery after 20 hours of purging under hydrogen [142]. Another promising alloy exhibiting sulfur resistance is Pd-Pt. However, a content of Pt between 10 and 30 wt% exhibited decreased permeability (i.e., 20-60% of the permeability of pure Pd), while demonstrating improved sulfur tolerance; for instance, 30% permeation loss was reported at 1,000 ppm H2S at 400 °C [143,144]. Without bulk sulfide formation, the permeability of sulfur-tolerant membranes can be partially or fully recovered after flushing with a pure hydrogen stream [138,141,142,145]. In order to achieve higher hydrogen permeability while maintaining sulfur resistance, alloys with more than two elements have also been investigated, including Pd-Ag-Cu [146–148], Pd-Ag-Au [141,149], and Pd-Au-Pt [150]. Permeabilities of these ternary alloys are also listed in Table 4."
8,Non-Pd membranes,"3.3 Non-Pd membranes Non-precious metal alloys for hydrogen separation have been studied as a way to reduce the use of precious metals. A range of hydrogen permeabilities for non-Pd membranes from the literature is listed inTable 5 . The alloy Zr36Ni64 was the first amorphous metal alloy membrane introduced by Hara et al., demonstrating 12 × lower hydrogen flux with 31 × reduced cost than a Pd77Ag23 membrane [158]. Hydrogen permeabilities tend to increase along with a Zr content in amorphous metal alloys [159,160]. Superior hydrogen permeability may also be achieved by using crystalline alloys of early transition metals with the BCC structure, such as the Group 5 metals (e.g., V, Nb, and Ta) [161–163]. It should be noted that the presence of a catalytic Pd layer is often required for such high permeation levels of hydrogen through these metals. Group 5 metals have high surface resistance for hydrogen entry and exit [162], but a thin Pd layer (several hundred nanometers) coated upon the surfaces of those metals allows for rapid hydrogen dissociation and subsequent bulk diffusion. Some Zr-Ni amorphous alloys have reactive surfaces, which allow for hydrogen dissociation thereby eliminating the use of precious metals [158]. The increased permeability of the crystalline and amorphous metal alloys can be largely attributed to their high hydrogen solubility [109]. However, the high solubility is often correlated to the susceptibility of potential hydrogen embrittlement. As the hydrogen concentration rises, the precipitation of new hydride phases occurs, and the stress along phase boundaries potentially increases, leading to defects and cracks in metals [164]. To reduce the embrittlement induced by this dual phase, alloying with less hydrogen-soluble metals, such as Ni, has been reported in the literature [165–169]. It was found that the presence of the less hydrogen-soluble additive metals suppresses the formation of the hydride phases, thereby limiting hydrogen embrittlement. Another important property of membrane material is the thermal stability for high-temperature operation. The thermal stability may be enhanced when a refractory metal (e.g., Nb, Ta, Mo, or W) is contained in alloys [170]. Even though these non-Pd membranes are at a premature stage compared to the Pd-based membranes, more research should continue since the impact of these new membranes on cost reduction could be very significant and more advanced membrane properties (e.g., permeability, chemical and thermal stability) may be achieved."
9,Efficient material screening,"3.4 Efficient material screening Various metallic membrane materials have been used and tested as discussed previously in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Despite the existence of a vast amount of experimental data on membrane fabrication and permeation tests, a direct, quantitative comparison of the properties among various membranes from different studies is often difficult and at times not possible due to differing measurement conditions and different units used among the various studies. It may be useful if studies could apply a standard measure of sulfur tolerance among different membranes; for example, it could be a fraction of permeation loss at a H2S concentration of 500 ppm compared to the original permeance in the absence of H2S. This availability of well-organized standard lab-scale data across various research groups may accelerate further development of the new membranes through efficient communication and accurate comparisons, preventing duplicated experiments on the same or less desirable membrane materials. Finding an optimal alloy and its composition through experiments is challenging since there are a limited number of tests that can be carried out within a reasonable timeframe while using finite resources. In addition to individual experimental tests to inform the design of an optimal membrane, high-throughput material screening has been attempted, in which alloys of multiple compositions are created and characterized on a small scale for efficient analyses [184,185]. Another method for efficient material screening is based on a computational approach, which does not involve collecting experimental data. Membrane properties, such as permeability, phase stability, and sulfur resistance, have been simulated through computational modeling. First-principles calculations combined with statistical mechanics methods have been used to predict hydrogen solubility and diffusivity to determine the permeability of Pd-based [186–188] and amorphous metal-based [189–191] membranes. This computational approach enables searching through a vast range of material compositions to select new membrane materials having enhanced permeability. Hao and Sholl have shown that the predictions often agree with experimentally measured permeabilities to within an order of magnitude; however, considering that the experimental permeability can vary significantly depending on microstructure variations even within the same alloy compositions [93,105,192], this may not always be the case. The accuracy of predictions varies across different metal-hydrogen systems, as do the models used in the simulations. These computational approaches suffer from intrinsic errors associated with the approximate nature of potentials that describe interactions among electrons or atoms, with which we solve equations of motion (Newton's equation for molecular dynamics calculations, or approximations to Schrödinger's equation for electronic structure calculations) pertaining to many-body systems to obtain ground-state energies and optimized geometries [193]. In addition, the errors may result from numerical approximations in solving those equations. Therefore, one should be careful in making comparisons, and it is more appropriate, in general, to compare trends between experimental and theoretical properties of materials rather than between particular experimental data points and the corresponding theoretical predictions."
10,Theoretical studies on metallic membrane materials,"3.5 Theoretical studies on metallic membrane materials Electronic structure calculations have provided mechanistic understanding of hydrogen-metal interactions, which cannot be easily demonstrated experimentally. Theoretical studies have revealed that hydrogen binding in subsurface layers of a metallic lattice results in a very stable state in most transition metals and that overcoming an activation barrier is often required for subsequent diffusion [194]. Hydrogen diffusion in the bulk phase between two interstitial sites, i.e., octahedral and tetrahedral sites, also involves an activation barrier [195] and possibly charge state variations between charged and neutral states [196]. In fact, a high charge density associated with hydrogen in metals may be correlated to strong hydrogen absorption, for instance, in the case of hydrogen in Group 5 metals and their alloys [197]. The phase stability of virtual alloy membrane materials has been evaluated by comparing alloy formation energies, segregation energies, and charge interactions [198,199]. Phase diagrams of Pd-based alloys in the presence of hydrogen or sulfur have been estimated by rigorous thermodynamic modeling combined with first-principles calculations, thereby further assessing the thermodynamic stability of materials under given temperature and pressure conditions [200,201]. The interaction between sulfur and membrane surfaces has been investigated through first-principles calculations that have provided the sulfur adsorption energy, release temperature, and segregation tendency of sulfur compounds [199,202]. Electronic coupling between the sulfur p-orbital and the metal d-band (valence electronic state of transition metals) was found to be the primary mode of interaction correlating directly to the sulfur adsorption strength [202,203]. Therefore, tuning the sulfur affinity through alloying of metals with different d-band centers (along the energy state with respect to Fermi-level) may be possible. A fundamental understanding of the interactions between membrane materials and gases may aid in the design of new materials with optimal properties and further may lead to the discovery of advanced membrane materials."
11,Metallic membrane opportunities for next-generation applications,
12,Small-scale industrial applications,"4.1 Small-scale industrial applications For smaller and emerging hydrogen markets such as the semiconductor and fuel cell industries, the use of Pd-based membranes is appropriate due to the scales and purity requirements. First, these applications are small- to medium-scale with capacities ranging from 5 to 1,000 m3/h [33], more than 100 times smaller than large-scale applications such as refining and ammonia production. The inherent compactness of membrane units would enable on-site production of hydrogen for applications on these scales. Alternatively, distributed small-scale users can source hydrogen from large-scale plants at a reasonable production cost [33], but the high cost of distribution would make this option less attractive. The distribution cost of hydrogen is 15 times higher than that of liquid hydrocarbon fuels on a mass basis primarily due to higher pumping costs [24]. If CCUS is considered, CO2 distribution to sequestration sites would contribute to the cost of small-scale production units. In this case, Sjardin et al. concluded from a techno-economic study that at a hydrogen production scale below 40 MW (ca. 12,300 m3/h ix ix Converted based on the higher heating value of hydrogen as used in Ref. [302] and the molar volume of an ideal gas at 298 K. ), MRs with CCUS ($19/GJ) would become competitive with centralized H2 production ($18/GJ) [204]. On-site hydrogen production would also provide self-sufficient supply and further circumvent delivery delays as well as issues with storage safety. Nevertheless, higher production costs due to smaller production sizes and safety concerns over local production and handling of hydrogen as an explosive gas should be taken into consideration [25]. Secondly, fuel cell and semiconductor applications require hydrogen of very high purities. In semiconductor manufacturing, hydrogen is used as a carrier gas for trace doping elements [16], and hydrogen of near absolute purity (99.999999%) is needed [16,106]. For PEMFCs, CO impurities in the hydrogen feed could strongly adsorb onto the catalyst, leading to catalyst deactivation and cell performance deterioration [15,205,206]. A CO concentration of as low as 2 ppm has been recommended by the U.S. DOE for hydrogen used in onboard vehicle fuel cells [15], which corresponds to a hydrogen purity of 99.999+%. Such high purities are readily available from dense Pd-based membranes, which have a theoretically complete selectivity towards hydrogen [15,204,207]."
13,Power generation and large-scale hydrogen production,"4.2 Power generation and large-scale hydrogen production A foreseeable large-scale application of hydrogen is to be used as a low-carbon energy resource for electricity generation. This would differ from the current use of hydrogen, which is as a coolant for turbo generators [208–212]. When used as a fuel gas, high-pressure hydrogen [213] with a purity of less than 80% [106,214] is favored for conventional gas turbines. This hydrogen purity is necessary for maintaining a moderate flame temperature [108,215] to suppress NOx formation in the combustion chamber [70,108,215], as current NOx reduction technology in gas turbines cannot be used for hydrogen combustion [70]. If pre-combustion CO2 capture is considered for H2/CO2 separation, membrane technology may be employed. In this case, a nitrogen or steam sweep gas can be used to increase the separation driving force by decreasing the permeate-side hydrogen partial pressure [70,213,215] in addition to reducing the required membrane surface area [215]. The sweep gas will also act as a diluent to control the flame temperature and reduce NOx levels [108,215] as previously discussed. Since high purity is not a requirement for power generation, highly selective Pd-based membranes would lose their advantage compared to other membrane materials. For example, it has been estimated that a H2/CO2 selectivity ranging from 20 to 60 and a H2/N2 selectivity from 130 to 870 would be sufficient for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants [213]. The more stringent H2/N2 selectivity is needed to prevent back-diffusion of N2 into the CO2-rich stream to meet the specifications for CO2 pipeline transport and sequestration [213]. These selectivity requirements allow for a wider range of materials to be used, such as ceramic and polymeric membranes [213]. Although the high operating temperature of Pd-based membranes, e.g., 300-600 °C, is compatible with exhaust streams of power plant applications, the high temperature range is not unique to metallic membranes. For example, an operating temperature of 400 °C is accessible to microporous silica hydrogen-selective membranes [62,106] or even some high-temperature polymeric hydrogen-selective membranes. A common disadvantage of the hydrogen-selective membrane technology for turbine applications is that the hydrogen product exits the membrane from the low-pressure permeate side, which makes recompression necessary thereby imposing additional costs [104,105,216,217]. Other separation technologies such as physical absorption, e.g., Selexol, have also been studied for pre-combustion CO2 capture. The high partial pressure of CO2 after the WGS reactor makes physical absorption of CO2 a suitable approach for capturing carbon [70]. Computational modeling studies have shown that Pd-based membranes do not have a distinct advantage over physical absorption in terms of plant efficiency and costs. For example, Chiesa et al. concluded that an IGCC system with a Pd60Cu40 MR is more efficient by nearly 1.7% than a reference IGCC plant using Selexol for carbon capture [215]. Amelio et al. found that a Pd-Ag membrane–based IGCC plant has a slightly lower efficiency than an IGCC plant using a Selexol separation process. The reason for this lower efficiency is due to the fact that the membrane-based IGCC system consumes a larger fraction of its generated power for CO2 compression and for producing steam as a sweep gas for the MR system. However, it is worth noting that the investment cost and the cost of electricity in the membrane-based system are 4% and 1.4% lower than the reference case, respectively [218]. Rezvani et al. found that the overall efficiency of IGCC with CO2 capture using a Pd-Ag membrane is 3.7% higher than using Selexol, and the investment cost of the membrane system is 1.6% lower than the Selexol system. The results of these techno-economic studies are subject to assumptions on separation efficiencies, capital and operating costs, and even regulations on CO2 capture, and therefore should be interpreted and compared with caution. Lab- and pilot-scale experimental studies will be needed to fully understand the potential opportunities and issues of applying Pd-based membranes in electricity generation with pre-combustion carbon capture. In addition to electricity, hydrogen can be co-produced from coal- or natural gas–based processes. For instance, PSA can be integrated with the shift reactor for bulk hydrogen recovery in the range of 70-85% and for high-purity hydrogen production [70,219], and this concept would be similar to the large-scale hydrogen production method conventionally employed. Techno-economic studies have shown that, similar to the case of electricity generation from an IGCC plant, Pd-based membranes may only offer modest efficiency improvements and cost savings compared to PSA or physical absorption. For example, Kreutz et al. assessed hydrogen production from coal gasification with Pd60Cu40 membranes and found that using Selexol for CO2 capture and subsequent PSA for hydrogen purification that the former case offers a less than 1% reduction in capital costs, but that the hydrogen production cost is 2% greater [220]. In theory, these metallic membranes for hydrogen production have a place within large-scale systems. However, experimental testing has yet to reinforce these claims. Until large-scale testing occurs, hydrogen production membranes will remain experimental in scale."
14,Hydrogen transportation and carbon dioxide capture via membrane technology,"4.3 Hydrogen transportation and carbon dioxide capture via membrane technology In the transportation sector, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for either adapted hydrogen ICEsor onboard HFCVs. Even when hydrogen is produced from SMR without CCUS, up to a 40% reduction in GHG emissions can be achieved in transportation due to the higher efficiency of a HFCV over a conventional gasoline-powered ICE vehicle [24]. Although the initial attention on HFCVs has shifted to other low-carbon transportation solutions such as biofuel and electric cars [221], steady research, design, and development (RD&D) progress has been made by leading international car and energy companies [222]. One of the remaining challenges is a lack of hydrogen fuel infrastructure [222]. In the meantime, on-site natural gas reforming at refueling stations could be a viable near- to medium-term solution [100,204], especially when low-cost natural gas is available [100]. Additionally, Pd-based MRs may be considered for distributed hydrogen production for application to the transportation sector. For instance, MRs can be used to produce hydrogen on a small scale (between 2-4 MW) at the refueling stations integrated with the existing natural gas infrastructure [204]. Another option would be onboard hydrogen production for fuel cells. For this application, high-purity hydrogen has to be produced within highly space-compact devices, and traditional purification facilities would not be able to meet this requirement due to their complexity and size [223]. In this case, MRs would be advantageous for onboard applications given their ability to produce high-purity hydrogen within a small volume. In particular, the MR concept may potentially reduce the reactor volume by a factor of 10 to 100 compared to conventional SMR and the subsequent WGS reaction [224]. Another benefit of the MR is its high conversion efficiencies. This onboard technology for transportation would have an MR on the vehicle, which would produce hydrogen for power (fuel cell or ICE) and temporarily store CO2. The CO2 sourced from the high-pressure side of the membrane would be stored outside of the membrane unit, and the compression energy would be provided by the original fuel source, i.e., compressed natural gas. Upon refueling, the temporarily stored CO2 would be removed from the vehicle and subsequently used in a secondary market. In the case of small-scale hydrogen production with CO2 capture, the trade-off between H2 distribution to users and CO2 transport to centralized facilities for usage should be balanced. In 2004, the U.S. DOE investigated funding future research related to onboard fuel reforming and made a no-go decision. The investigation team believed the milestones could be met, but that the milestones could not be met in the timeframe allotted by the administration at that time. The original timeframe of 2030 was pushed up to 2015, thereby overpromising the potential onboard reforming technology at that time. Although the independent panel recommended a no-go decision, they also made a number of specific recommendations that, if implemented, would effectively continue support of onboard fuel processing RD&D [225]."
15,Challenges for Pd membrane applications,
16,Structural and chemicalstability of Pd,"5.1 Structural and chemicalstability of Pd As mentioned briefly in section 3, one of the major challenges associated with the mechanical stability of pure Pd membranes arises from hydrogen embrittlement. The absorption of hydrogen into the Pd structure can induce the α-to-β phase transition at relatively low temperatures [16]. Palladium hydride (Pd-H) can exist as two distinct phases, α and β. The α phase is a solid solution while within the β phase, the H atoms are ordered within octahedral interstitial sites [109]. The distinct feature of the Pd-H phase diagram is that there is a miscibility gap where α and β phases coexist. The highest temperature beyond which the β phase cannot form is referred to as the “critical point”. The critical point is estimated to be approximately 298 °C and 2 MPa [129,226]. The existence of α and β phases depend on the atomic ratio of Pd to H. The α phase appears at concentrations of atomic hydrogen below Pd-H0.02, while only the β phase exists at H concentrations higher than Pd-H0.58. At H concentrations within Pd-H0.02-0.58 both phases coexist [131]. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results reveal that, at room temperature, both the α and β phases of Pd-H alloys are FCC solid solutions and have lattice parameters greater than those of pure Pd [227]. The nucleation of β-hydride from the α phase will cause severe lattice strains which lead to membrane embrittlement after numerous α–β phase transitions [192]. The coexistence of two phases may lead to significant volume expansion and hence membrane failure. Therefore, it is crucial to operate the MR at temperatures above the critical temperature [226]. The effect of hydrogen embrittlement on the integrity of the membrane has been studied extensively [180,181,228,229]. Embrittlement is simply defined as the weakening of the membrane metal structure due to the diffusion and permeation of H atoms in the lattice structure [109]. Kolachev has listed eight main mechanisms responsible for the embrittlement-induced failure of metallic membranes which can be categorized by two types [229]. Embrittlement of the first type is caused by the sources that are initially present in the metal structure and before application of stresses. This type of embrittlement becomes more pronounced as the strain rate in the metal structure increases and is irreversible in nature. The embrittlement of the second type is caused by sources in the metal structure that only appear as the hydrogen concentration increases during the plastic deformation. Plastic deformation is defined as the “permanent distortion that occurs when a material is subjected to tensile, compressive, bending, or torsion stresses that exceed its yield strength and cause it to elongate, compress, buckle, bend, or twist”. [230] The embrittlement of the first type may be caused by the: • Formation of gaseous reaction products between the hydrogen atoms and impurities in the metal structure • The formation and accumulation of molecular hydrogen in the discontinuities of the metal structures such as micro-shrinkage cavities or gas holes • Formation of hydride precipitates • Formation of dissolved hydrogen The embrittlement of the second type can be caused by the: • Decomposition of unstable solid solutions influenced by stresses • Interaction of H atoms with moving dislocations • Directional diffusion of H atoms due to nonuniform external elastic, thermal, and electric fields Although the development of an embrittlement-resistant Pd-based MR is a challenge, this phenomenon and its adverse effects may be diminished by careful and accurate modeling and prediction of the temperature profile inside an MR, cautious selection of operating conditions, avoiding to apply pressure pulses, and optimizing membrane-support interactions [109,231]. Moreover, the embrittlement phenomena can be reduced or avoided by alloying pure Pd with different metals, as reported in section 3."
17,The effect of poisoning on the performance of Pd-based MRs,"5.2 The effect of poisoning on the performance of Pd-based MRs The surface of a Pd membrane is susceptible to contamination by chemical components in the gas stream, such as sulfur and carbon impurities. Hydrogen sulfide, at concentrations as low as 5-10 ppm, readily adsorbs onto the Pd surface leading to the formation of a strong metal-sulfur bond and, as a result, hydrogen dissociation may be substantially inhibited due to the lack of active sites available on the surface [139,232,233]. This surface inhibition may be the dominant mechanism of sulfur poisoning, but severe sulfur exposure may lead to bulk sulfide formation causing irreversible damage to the membrane [234]. This could be a significant drawback in the case of utilizing the syngas from coal gasification or natural gas reforming, which commonly contains concentrations from hundreds of ppm to several percent H2S [235,236]. In order to reduce the sulfur content suitable for Pd-based membrane operation, pre-desulfurization may be required. Sulfur-resistant alloy membrane materials may also alleviate the impact of sulfur, as discussed previously in section 3.2. In addition to the sulfur poisoning, the formation and deposition of carbon in high-temperature catalytic applications such as methane reforming or dehydrogenation may lead to defects thereby shortening the membrane lifetime [31,207]. Other compounds have also been reported that could lead to the poisoning of the Pd-based membrane and MRs and hindering of the hydrogen permeation. Carbon monoxide, steam, hydrocarbons, chlorine and mercury are the compounds/elements reported in the literature which may decrease the hydrogen permeating flux in a Pd-based MR. CO may compromise the permeating flux of hydrogen via two different mechanisms depending on the operating temperatures. At lower temperatures, the main mechanism for reducing hydrogen flux is the adsorption of CO molecules onto the Pd surface where they compete with hydrogen atoms for the active sites [121,237]. At higher temperatures the catalytic decomposition of CO molecules and carbon deposition on the Pd surface is the main mechanism for hampering the hydrogen permeation [237]. Some studies suggest that electronegative atoms such as chlorine and oxygen may act a as “poison” for the adsorption of the electropositive molecules such as hydrogen by “electronically” blocking the surrounding area next to the hydrogen molecules and preventing them from getting access to the active sites [238]. Water vapor molecules can also poison the Pd surface and hinder the permeating flux of hydrogen, however, compared with CO molecules, water vapor has a more adverse effect [121,233]. At low temperatures the adsorption of water on the metal surface occurs due to physisorption of water dipoles on the Pd surface. At higher temperatures, however, dissociative chemisorption of water vapor molecules on the solid surface is the governing mechanism controlling the adsorption. Although the number of adsorbed water molecules decreases with increasing the temperature, the decomposition rate of the adsorbed molecules increases at elevated temperatures. This means that the dissociation of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms and the recombination of these atoms to reform the water molecules could potentially poison the Pd surface with the adsorbed oxygen atoms as explained by Heras et al. [239]"
18,Pd availability,"5.3 Pd availability Although Pd-based membranes may be promising alternatives to PSA and cryogenic distillation for H2 separation on small to medium scales, their success for large industrial scales is still uncertain due to the availability of Pd. Palladium is a precious metal that is finite and should be used sparingly in application. The global supply of Pd in 2012 was 186 tonnes, which still fell short of the demand in the same year of 242 tonnes [240]. Primarily, Pd is used as a catalyst for automobile emission controls, electrical and electronic equipment, dental prostheses, and jewelry. In 2014, approximately 65% of the global Pd was used in the automobile industry and 14% in the electrical and electronic equipment sector [241,242]. The global Pd production in 2017 was around 225 tones. Only five countries account for more than 95% of the global Pd production, i.e., South Africa, Russia, U.S., Canada, and Zimbabwe [243]. The 2019 U.S. Geological Survey mineral commodity summaries report estimates that the total global resources of the platinum-group metals (PGMs) are more than 100,000 tonnes. In particular, more than 75% of all produced Pd comes from two countries, i.e., Russia (38%) and South Africa (39%) [244]. The availability of Pd with regard to large-scale applications such as IGCC power plants has been discussed in detail by Helmi et al. [240]. A key conclusion from their study is that given the scale of membrane material requirements predicted from modeling studies, even a rather optimistic assumption of membrane thickness would result in 1.2 to 9 tonnes of palladium for a single power plant with the electricity production capacity of 1.0 GWe. For example, Galuszka estimated that 1.2 tonnes of Pd would be required to supply hydrogen to a 1,000 ton/day methanol synthesis plant from methane reforming using a 10-μm Pd coating on an Al2O3 supported tubular membrane filled with 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst [31]. Helmi and coworkers estimated that approximately 2 tonnes of Pd would be needed for a 386-MW IGCC plant, given a thickness of 10 μm [240]. Membrane thickness, permeance, and composition, all affect estimated Pd requirements but do not impact the amount required beyond an order of magnitude [240]. To alleviate the concern of diminishing world Pd resources and provide a confident source well into the future [245], Pd may be recycled from a spent MR, similar to the automotive industry's recycling of metals from catalytic converters [246]. The average recycling rate of PGMs in chemical and petrochemical industries is 76%, and a feasible Pd recovery of 60% may be plausible with negligible cost [204]."
19,Technical challenges and uncertainties for Pd membrane scale-up,"5.4 Technical challenges and uncertainties for Pd membrane scale-up In addition to material availability, scale-up potential on the order of 1.5 million m3/day may be another limiting factor preventing wider application of Pd-based membranes. Process-scale analysis from the literature has reported that Pd-based metallic membranes may not satisfy the production rate on a large scale for economic industrial hydrogen production while meeting the purity criteria [213]. Despite the promising progress observed in emerging small-scale membrane units [66], it remains unclear whether thin, defect-free, and stable Pd-based membranes can be economically mass-produced; therefore, much RD&D is still needed in this area [31,70,204,207,215]. Reducing the membrane thickness is a key factor in making Pd-based membranes cost-effective [15,204,207]. For example, it has been predicted that a membrane thickness below 20 μm could make Pd-based MRs competitive with traditional WGS reactors [15], yet today commercially-available membranes are 20-50 μm thick, and thinner membranes of 2-5 μm are only produced on the laboratory scale [204]. In order to support a thin metal layer, a high-quality porous substrate (e.g., a small pore size with a narrow pore size distribution) is required. In fact, this substrate becomes 50 times more expensive than the cost of the thin layer of Pd [247]. Therefore, for the composite membranes to be economically viable on an industrial scale, not only does the cost of the thin metallic layer need to be reduced but also that of the porous support [192]. Enhanced permeability and reduced material cost may be achieved through investigation of new materials such as alloys, Earth-abundant metals, or amorphous metals, as discussed in section 3. Using new membrane materials or substrates combined with suitable fabrication methods could also alleviate instability against chemical impurities and thermal impacts. The high cost of Pd may be avoided by using Earth-abundant Group 5 metals, which cost approximately 1,000 times less than Pd at approximately $15 per kg, compared with that of Pd which is more than $49,000 per kg. In addition to improved performance and lower costs, long-term stability and durability against aggressive chemical environments, high-pressure conditions, and thermal cycling are critical to scale-up and remain to be demonstrated for commercialization purposes [207,215]. The integration of catalysts into the membrane unit would add another layer of vulnerability-depending on how the catalyst is embedded, complete replacement of the module may be necessary if the catalyst fails [248]. It is therefore necessary to develop the ability to repair the membrane during operation for commercial application [31], which is currently done for commercial polymeric membranes [31,207]. Other scale-up challenges that need to be addressed include difficulties in sealing [31,207,249], lack of pilot-scale performance data [249], and the need for material and design optimization to balance the reaction productivity and membrane flux [31]."
20,Cost of Pd membrane scale-up,"5.5 Cost of Pd membrane scale-up Relevant to both the scale and material availability are economic considerations. Membranes are limited when it comes to economies of scale [31,248] and consequently have minor benefits of scale-up due to their modular nature [204]. The capital cost of membrane systems scales less than linearly with increasing plant size [250]. Assuming that Pd membranes have a module cost of $1,500/ft2 ($16,146/m2) [106], based on the membrane surface area estimates by Chiesa and coworkers (~34,000 m2) [215], a capital investment of $548 million would be needed for the membrane unit at a 420-MW IGCC plant. By comparison, the total capital investment for post-combustion amine absorption units in natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants has been estimated to be $0.7-1.0 million/MW [251–253] x x The capital cost in Damen et al., 2007 was converted using the 2007 yearly average exchange rate of 1.370412. The inflation adjusted range will be $0.87-1.24 million/MW in 2019. , and that for physical absorption units (Selexol) for IGCC plants $1.2 (2007) - 2.9 (2006) million/MW [252,254–256]. xi xi The inflation adjusted range will be $1.48-2.90 million/MW in 2019 Whether it is justified to invest in metallic membrane–based carbon capture will depend on the trade-off between cost and required performance [31] and the adoption of a national policy framework on CO2 emissions. Some authors have suggested that the cost of Pd membranes and their production will decrease as cumulative production increases [257]. For example, Iaquaniello and coworkers forecast that the cost of Pd-based membranes will be reduced from ca. $112,432/m2 xii xii Converted using the weighted average exchange rate of 1.392705 for EURUSD in 2011; same for the cost at 10,000,000-m2 of cumulative production. at a cumulative production of 1,000 m2 to ca. $1,253/m2 when cumulative production reaches 10,000,000 m2 worldwide [257]. However, if one assumes a membrane thickness of 10 μm, 10,000,000 m2of production would equate to 1,200 tonnes of Pd, which is more than five times the global mine production of palladium in 2018 [258]. Given the already unstable Pd market [31,240], the effect of this large production on the price of Pd as well as whether the concept of economies associated with “learning by doing” would hold in this case remains uncertain."
21,Technoeconomic Analysis,"Hydrogen producing facilities may be categorized into three different groups based on their hydrogen production capacities: small-scale or distributed (i.e., 100-1,500 kg H2 per day at fueling stations), medium-scale or semi-central (i.e., 1,500-50,000 kg H2 per day on the outskirts of cities), large-scale or central (i.e., > 50,000 kg of H2 per day) [259]. Conventional SMR technology is a well-developed technology and, currently, the energy yield of hydrogen production is estimated at 60 gH2/kWh. This value is equivalent to a cost of $1.72 xiii xiii Assuming the average price of 1 kWh of electricity to be $0.1031 as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration as of April 2019. per kg of H2. The finished cost of producing one kg of hydrogen may vary significantly depending on the geographical location and the method of generating electricity. This energy yield of hydrogen production of 60 gH2/kWh is the target value set by the U.S. DOE as the benchmark for other competitive technologies by 2020 [259]. Although the 2020 target cost to produce one kg H2for various technologies varies from $2.30 to $9.20, the ultimate target cost for all technologies is set at $1.00-2.00 per kg of H2. Depending on the type of electrolyte used for the electrolysis processes, the electrolyzers can be divided into three main categories, i.e., proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, alkaline electrolyzer, and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). PEMs usually require noble catalysts which in turn increases the capital costs required for manufacturing such electrolyzers. However, the solid polymer electrolyte used in these electrolyzers provides them with significant advantages which makes these electrolyzers unique. Compact and leak-free design, high current density, low gas crossover rate, and capacity to operate at pressures as high as 350 bar are among the advantages of PEMs. This last feature, makes it possible to produce hydrogen at significantly higher pressure thereby eliminating the need for compressors before delivering the hydrogen to the consumer. PEMs usually operate at intermediate voltages (1.7-2.0V) and high current densities (more than 1.0 A.cm−2) which lead to higher nominal efficiencies [260]. The alkaline electrolyzer is the most mature and the most common type of electrolyzer which has the lowest capital cost amongst all electrolyzer types. Despite their low capital cost, alkaline electrolyzers are prone to leaking, and have lower current density both of which stem from the fact that unlike PEMs, alkaline electrolyzers use aqueous electrolytes. Alkaline electrolyzers usually operate at high voltages (1.8-2.4V) and low current densities (0.2-0.3A/cm2) which will result in lower system efficiencies [260]. SOECs are newer technology compared to PEMs and alkaline electrolyzers. SOECs usually operate at very high temperatures (900-950 °C) which translates into higher capital costs due to the need for more expensive materials such as ceramics in the manufacturing of the SOEC cells. Furthermore, a heat source is required to provide the thermal energy for SOECs. Unlike alkaline electrolyzers, SOECs do not suffer from leakage and have a more compact design. The single greatest drawback of SOECs is their long-term degradation which is actively being investigated by scientists. SOECs operate at very low voltages (i.e., less than 1.4V) and moderate current densities (0.4-0.8A/cm2) which allows them to have considerably higher electrical efficiency. Significant research is currently being conducted on the SOEC-based power-to-methane (P2M) systems to increase their technological readiness level (TRL) from TRL5 to TRL6 [261]. It is worth noting that the “thermodynamic limit” of the energy yield for SMR may be up to 105 gH2/kWh while for water electrolysis the limit is 25.4 gH2/kWh xiv xiv The theoretical minimum required electric energy to produce 1 kg of hydrogen at 25°C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 39.4 kWh (based on the higher heating value of hydrogen). at 25 °C and ambient pressure. It should be noted that the current commercial electrolyzer systems have significantly high efficiencies (approximately 50 kWh/kgH2) which are very close to the theoretical minimum energy. Nevertheless, when coupled with renewable energy resources such as PV cells, the overall efficiency of the system declines significantly (i.e., efficiencies as low as 20% for PV-SOEC are common) stemming from the very low efficiency of the PV cells (i.e., less than 17%) [260]. Hence, efficiency improvements based on novel technological breakthroughs are very limited for these systems [262]. High temperature electrolysis systems, however, have the potential to improve this limit and lower the cost only if the electrolyzer system is located in the proximity of a low-cost or waste heat source. Therefore, the key to success of the electrolyzer systems relies on the optimization of other key parameters such as capital cost or lifetime rather than focusing on electrical efficiency. As a result, small commercial electrolyzer systems in remote areas, due to their low capital requirements, can be very competitive against the conventional hydrogen plants. Fuel cost is the single largest cost component in production of hydrogen by natural gas reforming, accounting between 45-75% of the production cost of hydrogen. Nevertheless, low prices of natural gas in some geographical regions such as the Middle East and Russia (due to the existence of enormous conventional natural gas resources) and the U.S. (due to the existence of immense unconventional gas resources such as shale gas reserves and the availability of advanced technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling), have made the production cost of hydrogen very inexpensive in these regions. Depending on the region, retrofitting of a CCUS unit to the SMR plant could increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX), and cost of fuel by 50% and 10%, respectively. The operating expenses could be doubled on average, due to the costs associated with CO2 capture, handling, compression, transport and storage. However, there are some promising regions where the cost of producing hydrogen from a SMR with CCUS unit could be as low as $1.40 per kg of hydrogen produced. Despite technological advancements in the development of membranes and MRs, their numerous physical and technological features such as lifetime have not been realized with great certainty [263]. One of the reasons that there is not a general consensus on the lifetime of membranes is the lack of unanimity of the term “long-term test”. In the open literature the experiments ranging from 80-8,640 hours have been considered as “long-term tests” [138,263–265]. The movement of the Pd crystallites/atoms increases at high temperature and for prolonged time periods which increases the possibility of pinhole formation and subsequent membrane failure [266]. This effect is exacerbated as the thickness of the Pd layer decreases. Therefore, the thickness of the Pd layer can be increased to avoid the formation of pinholes. However, as shown previously in equation (4), the hydrogen permeating flux has an inverse relationship with the thickness of the Pd layer and by increasing the membrane thickness the hydrogen flux would decrease, which is not economically attractive [267]. Hence, one of the most important elements in the design of an MR is the selection of an optimized thickness for the Pd layer which will be a compromise between the lifetime and hydrogen permeating flux. The lifetime of the Pd-based membrane is usually assumed to be 5 years [263]. This means that at least four replacements are required for a plant with a lifetime of 25 years [268]. One of the major challenges for accurate economic evaluation for the Pd-based MR technology is the lack of large-scale commercial experience in this area. As a result, the majority of the economic studies reported in the literature are based on theoretical estimates. These studies adopt economic concepts such as net present value (NPV), fixed capital investment (FCI) total capital investment (TCI), and internal rate of return (IRR), to give a reliable fiscal understanding of the Pd-based MR technology [263,267,269–271]. The sources of uncertainties that have been integrated into these studies will result in single-point value approximations rather than statistical economic evaluations, which leads to inaccurate valuation assessments and improper economic decisions. These studies mainly suffer from the principle of “flaw of averages” [263,267,269–272]. In order to overcome the flaw of averages, Castro et al. [263] used Monte Carlo simulation methods to study the effects of lifetime and membrane thickness on the economic performance of multiple Pd and Pd/Au membranes. Uncertainties such as sources of commodity market, and uncertainties associated with regulatory and financing make the integration of Monte Carlo simulations in economic assessments inevitable. In this study it is showed that the lifetime of a pure Pd membrane is inferior to that of the Pd/Au membrane as the gold particles act as a paste that fills and covers the pinholes and defects induced in the surface of the membrane during the permeation tests [273]. Furthermore, the purity of produced hydrogen decreases with time. More interestingly, this decrease in quality is more pronounced in membranes with thinner Pd layers. However, thicker membranes will increase the capital investment significantly. For instance, increasing the Pd layer thickness from 2.7 µm to 4.6 µm and 10.4 µm will increase the membrane lifetime by 16% and 152%, respectively. The TCI also increases as the thickness of the Pd layer increases from 2.7 µm to 4.6 µm and 10.4 µm due to additional amounts of Pd used in membrane fabrication. This study reveals that the thinnest membrane has the best economic performance in terms of lowest FCI, TCI, and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Collodi et. al performed a comprehensive study on the economic performance of various SMR plants. Their work compares and contrasts the performance and various cost indices of a SMR plants with and without CCUS units producing 100,000 Nm3/h H2 operating as a merchant plant [274]. This study evaluates five different alternative scenarios to capture CO2 from a SMR plant and compares them with a modern SMR plant which is equipped with feedstock pretreatment, pre-reforming, HTS, and PSA units. These alternative technologies can capture CO2 from the shifted syngas, PSA tail gas or SMR flue gas using monoethanolamine (MEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), or cryogenic and membrane separation. In this work, the discounted cash flow analysis and LCOH are used to compare various technologies. Furthermore, the CO2 avoidance cost (CAC) is another key index which is used to compare the overall performance of these plants. The CAC maybe calculated as: (10) C A C = L C O H C C S − L C O H R e f e r e n c e C O 2 E m i s s i o n s R e f e r e n c e − C O 2 E m i s s i o n s C C S According to this study, in solvent-based CO2 capture scenarios, the overall consumption of natural gas has increased by more than 200% only to regenerate the solvent. The electricity that is required for CO2 capture, will result in high energy penalties in these cases. In a plant where CO2 is captured from the PSA tail gas using low temperature CO2 separation and membrane technology, the consumption of natural gas is reduced by approximately 7% compared to the base case. Moreover, in order to capture 90% of the CO2 from the SMR plant, the capital cost will increase by 78% compared with the base case. Furthermore, depending on the overall CO2 capture rate, from 53% to 90%, the LCOH may increase by 0.02 to 0.06 $/Nm3, respectively. The CO2 avoided cost is estimated to vary between $51.12 and $77.24 per tonne xv xv Converted using the weighted average exchange rate of 1.106560 for EURUSD in 2016. . The LCOH will increase between 18-45% depending on the CCUS technology implemented at the plant. Other similar studies show that CO2capture (80-85% capture from the concentrated PSA stream) will add approximately 25-30% to the cost of produced hydrogen by the SMR process [13]. The cost of hydrogen production may be reduced if a positive cash flow is generated by selling the captured CO2 for direct usage. It should be noted that, cost of hydrogen produced by SMR is very sensitive to the price of natural gas, its quality and heating value [275]. Furthermore, the capacity and efficiency of hydrogen plants must be considered when calculating the LCOH as the economy of scale plays a crucial role in the industrial processes. For instance, two hydrogen production plants could be identical in all aspects except for their capacities and this can have a significant effect on the LCOH of the plants. These results indicate that the production of hydrogen with CCUS units (either solvent-based or membrane-based) will add significantly to the LCOH, consumes a compelling amount of electricity, which would otherwise be exported to the grid. Therefore, it is crucial for any hydrogen producing facility to consider these economic implications before making a decision about retrofitting their plants with CCUS units. Hydrogen may also be produced by water electrolysis where water is dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Water electrolysis for hydrogen production is accomplished according the following half reactions: (11) C a t h o d e : 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 (12) A n o d e : 2 O H − → 1 2 O 2 + H 2 O + 2 e − The overall chemical reaction for water electrolysis can be written as a combination of the two half-reactions as follows:[275,276] (13) H 2 O + 2 F → H 2 + 1 2 O 2 such that F is the Faraday constant measuring 1.0 mole of electricity (96,485 °C/mol). According to equation (13), the overall cost of water electrolysis is mandated by the price of acquiring water and the cost of electricity. Cost of acquiring water can be reduced to negligible amounts by developing the electrolysis plant in appropriate geographical locations where water is abundant and cheap. In order to improve the conductivity and enhance the overall yield of hydrogen, an electrolyte, usually caustic potash (KOH), is dissolved in water. Despite the advantages of water electrolysis, such as potentially low CO2 emissions xvi xvi It is worth noting that in 2018, 63.5% of the U.S. electricity was generated from fossil fuels. Approximately 35% of electricity was produced from natural gas while roughly 27% of electricity came from coal. Therefore, the source of electricity must be considered to calculate the accurate emission values. Furthermore, some might argue, if the electricity come from the renewable sources, it would be better to decarbonize the grid in the first place rather than spending it for water electrolysis directly. associated with the electrolysis process, there are still challenges that need to be addressed: the amount of electricity consumed in commercial alkaline electrolysis systems for the production of pure hydrogen is very high (approximately 4.5-5 kWh/mn 3 H2) [277], the cathode and anode electrodes are coated with platinum and manganese oxide respectively [275],which makes the process economically unattractive. Furthermore, compression of the produced hydrogen to pressures as high as 880 bar will add further costs [98]. According to recent studies performed by National Academies of Sciences and the U.S. DOE, the current delivered cost of one kg of hydrogen generated by grid-power electrolysis, wind-power electrolysis, and solar-power electrolysis are approximately $6-7, $7-11, and $10-30 respectively. These numbers may be reduced to as low as $3-4 per kg of hydrogen delivered with advancements in the wind turbine and solar panel technologies and with the introduction of “smart grid” in the future [278]. As reported, the major challenges associate with water electrolysis technologies are the significant amount of electricity and large volumes of water required for the process. Producing today's global hydrogen demand from water electrolysis requires more than 3,600 TWh of electricity which is more than the annual electricity generation of the whole European Union. In addition, approximately 9.0 kg of water is required to produce 1.0 kg of hydrogen. Producing today's global energy demand from water electrolysis will require more than 617 million cubic meter of water which is equivalent to 1.3% of water consumed in the global energy sector. Using fresh water for electrolysis could be an environmental and social challenge in areas that are already dealing with water crisis. Direct use of sea water, in coastal areas, would result in corrosive damage to the equipment. Use of desalinated water could be the only short-term solution to the water problem. However, it should be noted that it requires between 3.0-4.0 kWh of electricity to desalinate 1.0 m3 of seawater through reverse osmosis process. As mentioned earlier, the three main electrolyzer technologies that exist today are alkaline electrolyzers, PEMs, and SOECs. Nonetheless, another hydrogen production technology that has received significant attention in recent years is solar-driven electrolysis. Electrolysis fueled by solar energy can be divided into two major categories: photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and photovoltaic electrolysis (PV-E). A PEC system is a fully integrated unit that absorbs sunlight and directly produces hydrogen while the PV-E system consists of independent photovoltaic modules that drive separate electrolyzer units and has more operational flexibility compared with the PEC system [279]. Cost of hydrogen produced by electrolysis depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cost of water, conversion efficiency, CAPEX, and annual operating hours. CAPEX requirements for alkaline electrolysis, PEM electrolysis, and SOEC electrolysis could be in the ranges of $500-1,400/kWe, $1,100-1,800/kWe, and $2,800-5,600/kWe, respectively. According to a recent study by Shaner et al., the LCOH and total CAPEX for a base-case PV-E system are estimated at $12.1 per kg H2 and $260 million, respectively. The LCOH and capital expenditure for the base-case PEC system is reported to be $11.4 per kg H2 and $205 million, respectively [279]. In order for a PV-E system to be competitive with the PEC system, an increase in efficiency or decrease in the capital expenditure is necessary. Solar-driven technologies are limited by low solar power density (less than 1.0 kW/m2), low capacity factor (less than 25%), and low conversion efficiencies (less than 20%). The cost of producing hydrogen (without compression, storage, and dispensing) by SMR can be as low as $1.43 per kg of H2, when the price of natural gas feedstock is assumed to remain constant at $4 per MMBtu [280]. With the current prices of natural gas xvii xvii The average price of natural gas in the U.S. in the year 2018 was approximately $3.15 per MMBtu. , in order for PV-E technologies to be at cost parity with SMR, a minimum carbon tax of $1,200 per tonne of CO2would be required [279]. Considering the challenges associated with the development of electrolysis technology, along with the economic disadvantages compared with processes such as SMR, it is expected that the scale of hydrogen produced by electrolysis will not change in the near future and will be mainly limited to small-scale and unique applications. An additional crucial aspect that one needs to keep in mind is the concept of “locked investment”. The average plant lifetime is approximately 25-30 years and once a plant is built it is expected to be operational for this timeframe. This may even further slow down the transition toward decarbonization in the absence of appropriate legal frameworks. The only scenario in which an increase in the volume of produced hydrogen by electrolysis is plausible, is when stringent national and international climate policies are put in place that help our global society to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Implementation of such policies would make the finished cost of produced hydrogen significantly higher due to either carbon penalties associated with combustion of natural gas or the cost of CO2 capture and sequestration. Therefore, under such policies, water electrolysis could be a competitive alternative. Hydrogen can also be produced from biomass resources. However, one of the major challenges with this approach is the large-scale availability of cheap biomass. For instance, in order to produce the hydrogen demand in the U.S., roughly 100% of the nation's biomass capacity is required while the same goal can be achieved with only 6% of the country's wind power and 1% of its solar power potential. Nevertheless, combining biomass and CCUS for hydrogen production could be a potential “negative emission” technology which will be more attractive in a scenario where climate change mitigation policies place higher penalties on CO2 emissions. In recent years, plasmas have gained interest for application to hydrogen production from both gaseous and liquid fuels. One of the plasma-based techniques for hydrogen production is the plasma arc decomposition technology. This method simply decomposes natural gas into carbon and hydrogen and is claimed to produce no CO2 [281] as indicated in equation (14): (14) C H 4 → C + 2 H 2 In principle, plasma reforming reactions are the same as conventional reforming reactions with the exception that the required energy and free radicals used for the reforming reaction are provided by a plasma that is usually generated by electric or thermal energy [282]. The plasma used for hydrogen production from gaseous fuels are generated by various methods such as electron beam, dielectric-barrier discharge, gliding arc, plasmatron arc, and microwave discharge [259]. Plasma reformers can generate pure hydrogen streams from an array of hydrocarbon fuels (such as gasoline, diesel, oil, natural gas, alcohols, etc.) with conversion efficiencies very close to 100% [283]. Among all the plasma methods, the plasma generated by a plasmatron arc and supported by a catalyst is the most advanced technology that is currently capable of producing hydrogen from methane with an energy yield (225 gH2/kWh) that meets the 2020 DOE target [259]. In addition, the recent developments in the microwave plasma sources (MPSs) with catalysts have shown very promising results and have achieved energy yields as high as 62.8 gH2/kWh [259]. One advantage of using plasma approaches for hydrogen production is its compactness due to the high energy density of the plasma system and very short response time. Furthermore, the heavy particles (such as atoms and molecules) can reach temperatures as high as 2,000-6,000 K while lighter particles (such as electrons) can reach temperatures up to 10,000 K in the plasma environment. In addition, plasma matter contains reactive radicals (i.e., H, OH, and O) and ions which significantly enhance the conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen in the high-temperature medium [259]. Although some plasma reforming methods such as MPS have numerous advantages over the conventional reforming processes such as better response time, the ability to produce hydrogen from heavier hydrocarbons, and hydrogen production from gaseous fuels with an energy yield close to that set by DOE target, the high amount of electricity required in addition to high electrode erosion at elevated pressures represent significant challenges [284,285]. Furthermore, plasma methods face other challenges such as low hydrogen production rates, and high investment and operating costs [259]. Other than the methods discussed earlier, there are some other technologies that show significant potential for hydrogen production and might play a role in future hydrogen economy scenarios. Among these methods are the chemical looping combustion (CLC) and the alcohol reforming processes that show promising capacity for future carbon-free scenarios [286]. In the recent decades a compelling amount of research has been conducted in the area of hydrogen production via alcohol reforming. One of the advantages of alcohol reforming over methane reforming is that unlike steam reforming of methane, in alcohol reforming, the hydrocarbon source is in liquid state which may eliminate the need for gaseous hydrogen storage and distribution for on-board hydrogen production in HFCVs [287]. Other advantages of alcohol reforming over steam reforming include easier handling and transport, lower cost, and alternative modes of synthesis [288,289]. For instance, methanol and ethanol can be effortlessly synthesized from both fossil fuels and biomass-based syngas. The latter method has a great potential to make alcohol reforming an attractive alternative method for conventional SMR in a low carbon intensity economy. More specifically, in a process called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), bioethanol can be produced from the fermentation of biomass, such as corn and sugarcane, while CO2 is captured permanently stored in geological formations. Steam alcohol reforming (SAR) can be carried out in an MR in an identical process to that of SMR as depicted in Figure 7 . Gallucci et al., have conducted numerous experimental studies on the SAR process which reveal that in an MR, methanol conversions could be as high as 100% while in the conventional reactor, the maximum methanol conversion is reported to be only 50% [289]. Many other studies investigated the effect of several parameters on the performance of SAR in MR technology. In particular, Hedayati et al. performed a rigorous exergy analysis for the ethanol steam reforming (ESR) reaction conducted in an MR [291,292]. Their exergy analyses revealed that the performance of the reforming system can be improved by eliminating/minimizing the irreversibilities and losses in the system, and that the optimal operating conditions which give the highest exergy efficiencies for the ESR reaction correspond at highest possible operating pressures and temperatures and lowest possible steam to carbo (S/C) ratios. Nevertheless, further development in MRs performance and more stringent climate policies could make the SAR an attractive alternative to the conventional SMR. Another technology that has gained significant attention for hydrogen production in the last two decades is the CLC process. Unlike a conventional combustion cycle system, a CLC process, employs two fluidized bed reactors, an air reactor (AR) and a fuel reactor (FR) accompanied with a circulating metal oxide (MxOy) which serves as an oxygen carrier for the combustion cycle. The metal oxide particles are reduced in the FR using the hydrocarbon fuel as a reducer according to equation (15). Next, the reduced particles are oxidized in the AR to regenerate the metal oxide as shown in equation (16) [286]. (15) ( 2 n + m ) M x O y + C n H 2 m → ( 2 n + m ) M x O y − 1 + m H 2 O + n C O 2 (16) M x O y − 1 + 1 2 O 2 → M x O y One of the biggest advantages of the CLC process is the separation of fuel from the air using two different reaction chambers. This CLC design will allow for using nearly pure oxygen without nitrogen which significantly eliminates NOx formation [293] and improves the thermal efficiency of the process [294]. In addition, the only combustion products are H2O and CO2 which are not diluted by hydrogen. This will allow for capturing nearly pure CO2 by simply condensing out the water vapor. Some of the common challenges associated with CLC processes are the erosion of the reformer tubes due to high temperature, the need for PSA and WGS reactors for hydrogen separation and purification, and selection of the suitable oxygen carrier with favorable reactive properties and high resistance against carbon deposition. However, the major drawback of the CLC process is the high pressure required for air compression and very high temperatures (more than 1,000 °C) required to keep the conversion rates high in the FR. This can be directly translated into high operating costs associated with production of a unit mass of hydrogen. One way to address these challenges is to combine the CLC system with the MR which is called the membrane assisted chemical looping reforming (MA-CLR) as proposed by Spallina et al. [295]. Their study shows that the MA-CLR can produce between 12-20% more hydrogen compared with the conventional fired tubular reforming (FTR) process while the cost of producing hydrogen drops by more than 30% xviii xviii The average production cost of hydrogen by FTR and MA-CLR technologies is reported to be 0.28 €/Nm3H2 and 0.19 €/Nm3H2respectively in 2016 values.[295]These values can be converted to 2019 inflation adjusted values of $3.72/kgH2 and $2.52/kgH2 respectively. The weighted average exchange rate in 2016 is assumed to be 1.106560 for EURUSD. [295]. A summary of hydrogen production technologies along with their advantages and drawbacks is provided in Table 6. A comparison between the production cost of hydrogen using different technologies is represented in Figure 8 . As it can be seen in this figure, natural gas without CCUS is the least expensive method of producing hydrogen while water electrolysis with the grid electricity is the most expensive method for producing the same amount of hydrogen. Furthermore, this plot shows that, except for coal, the greatest cost component is the fuel cost. Therefore, the future prices of hydrogen will be a strong function of fuel prices. It is also worth mentioning that the hydrogen production cost with electrolysis is not sensitive to the CO2 price while coal without CCUS has the greatest sensitivity to CO2 prices. However, it should be noted that when discussing water electrolysis technologies, it is crucial to include the source of electricity when calculating CO2 emissions. If the electricity for water electrolysis is provided by renewable energies or is coming from nuclear power, then one can assume CO2 intensity of the process as negligible. Otherwise, depending on the source of electricity (natural gas or coal) the water electrolysis could emit significant amounts of CO2. As it is shown in Figure 9 , approximately 40 kg of CO2 is emitted for every kg of hydrogen produced via water electrolysis when the electricity is generated in a coal-fired power plant. As a comparison, the CO2 emission from a natural gas steam reforming plant without CCUS is approximately 9 kgCO2/kgH2. This means that for water electrolysis process to have the same amount of emission as a natural gas reforming without CCUS, the CO2 intensity of the produced electricity should be less than 185 (gCO2/kWh). These differences arise from the fact that significant amount of energy is lost during the conversion of fossil fuels to electricity. Therefore, if the CO2 intensity of the electricity is not reduced to the above-mentioned limits, it would be more environmentally attractive to just burn the natural gas in a reforming reaction to produce hydrogen rather than converting it to electricity and later produce hydrogen via electrolysis. Hence, it is very clear that electrolysis for hydrogen production makes sense from a GHG emissions reduction perspective only if the electricity is generated from non-fossil fuel sources."
22,Conclusions,"Advantages of hydrogen energy in terms of production, conversion, transportation, storage, along with its environmental benignity will make it a very promising solution to address both ever-increasing global energy needs and adverse climate change effects. However, it should be noted that replacing one energy source with another requires technology and infrastructure development. Transition from one dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years historically. The world energy markets are currently observing the transition from oil to natural gas and this transition has occurred at the beginning years of the 21st century with the advancement of technology in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing which made it possible to recover the previously inaccessible resources called “shale gas”. Therefore, despite the significant growth of the renewable energies in the global energy portfolio, it is expected that natural gas will remain a significant component of the energy market in the foreseeable future. Fossil fuels have been the number one source for world hydrogen production (ca.95%) with the current industrial process of SMR combined with PSA leading the hydrogen production market. The price of natural gas plays an important role in the future of hydrogen production by SMR. The cost of hydrogen is largely dependent on the cost of natural gas, the required purity, and the logistics between production and point of use. Increasing prices of natural gas in the coming decades could potentially make coal gasification with CCUS a better economic alternative unless environmental regulations and policies prevent using coal or make its utilization very costly. Currently, the main industrial uses of hydrogen are ammonia synthesis and petroleum refining. However, it is expected that novel economies such as HFCVs will be rapidly expanding as hydrogen technology develops in the coming decades. While not able to meet the high production rates associated with the world's hydrogen demand, metallic membranes have potential in applications requiring high-purity hydrogen of 99.99+% and small niche applications, where membrane costs are less of a concern than performance, such as in fuel cells and semiconductor manufacturing. In a future carbon-constrained world, “clean” hydrogen production should take place with the implementation of CO2 capture units. In such a scenario, using metallic membranes for hydrogen production and purification may become economically feasible, provided that a carbon tax or other incentives are levied. Compact metallic MRs could be suitable for distributed and/or mobile hydrogen production and enable CO2 capture from these sources. Power generation from IGCC using metallic membranes for pre-combustion carbon capture may be competitive with other separation technologies (e.g., polymer membranes and physical absorption) but the large-scale use of metallic membranes will remain a theoretical concept until it is proven by sufficient experimental studies under actual industrial conditions. Although Pd is a limited resource where the majority (ca.75%) of mined supply comes from two countries, Russia and South Africa, Pd-based membrane materials play a major role in metallic membrane research. The demand for Pd has increased in the past several years, mostly from the automobile industry, while the market of mined supply has declined. Therefore, it is reasonable to minimize the use of Pd in metallic membranes. In fact, since pure-Pd membranes have limited use due to sulfur intolerance, thermal instability, and high cost, it has been of interest in the research community to improve such membrane material properties. Alloying of Pd membranes with other metals has provided enhanced sulfur resistance and thermal stability. Membranes based on non-precious metals also have proven enhanced thermal stability while decreasing the material cost. Computational approaches for material screening could provide an efficient way to enhance new membrane developments. The ongoing research to improve metallic membrane materials or develop new materials is fairly new and has yet to be fully explored. Moving to a hydrogen economy may be achieved through various paths such as SMR, coal gasification, geothermal, nuclear, renewable energy resources (e.g., wind and solar), etc. Each of these paths have their own benefits and drawbacks. There are numerous factors that must be investigated thoroughly before choosing the best path toward hydrogen economy. Renewability, cost, efficiency, GHG emissions, multigeneration, size reduction (land footprint), reliability and durability, purity of the produced hydrogen are some key factors that the decision makers need to consider in their selection criteria. In addition, challenges for hydrogen delivery such as high delivery cost, low efficiency, purity, leakage and safety issues need to be addressed. Finally, in hydrogen production with CCUS units, the costs associated with CO2 sequestration, monitoring, and safe handling need to be studied with great precision as they might change the fate of the project. Although SMR is the dominant industrial process for hydrogen production, environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions along with the process intensification and energy optimization are the areas that still can be improved significantly. Metallic MRs have the potential to address both challenges. MRs inherently operate at significantly lower operating pressures and temperatures while achieving similar performance to that of conventional reactors which require higher operating pressures and temperatures. Hence, the capital and operating expenses could be considerably lower compared with the conventional reactors. The benchmark for economic production of hydrogen by the year 2020 has been determined and set in place by the U.S. DOE. The key factors set by the DOE are the energy yield of 60 gH2/kWh which is equivalent to less than $2.00 per kg of produced hydrogen in 2020. While established industrial processes such as SMR can easily meet the set limit by the DOE, it seems that the other processes such as water electrolysis, electron beam radiolysis, and gliding arc technologies do not meet this requirement presently. Among these methods water electrolysis has attracted significant attention due to the low CO2 emissions associated with the electrolysis process. However, it should be noted that electricity is one of the most important components of water electrolysis process and depending on the sources of electricity, hydrogen cost could vary significantly. Therefore, only reporting the CO2 emissions associated with the water electrolysis process itself and not mentioning the emissions associated with the electricity used in the process could be misleading. In order to realize the true emissions associated with the water electrolysis a careful life-cycle-assessment, from cradle to grave, is necessary. Furthermore, it is still a matter of disagreement if it is the best way to use water in remote areas where access to water is challenging and costly. Among the methods that use plasma technology for hydrogen production, plasmatron method could be very efficient in terms of performance, energy yield, and production rate. However, all these methods suffer from the extremely high capital and operating expenditures. Finally, considering the currently low gas prices, and the lenient regulations on GHG emissions, it seems that SMR process will stay the dominant process for hydrogen production in the industry. However, it needs to be emphasized that in the wake of our changing climate and the subsequent existential threats to human civilization, governments and their policy makers will need to respond more proactively by adopting policies that advocate for more sustainable, low-carbon solutions to meeting our global energy needs, which will bridge us toward a future that is less dependent on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, due to their modular characteristics, MRs show great potential to be used for smaller-scale hydrogen production while optimizing the energy consumption associated with the process."
