0,Introduction,"The depletion of fossil resources alongside the deterioration of environment drives powerful momentum to develop green and renewable energy and resources to alleviate our overwhelming dependency on non-renewable fossil resources over the past decades [1]. Of well-known green energies like solar and wind energy, biomass is the only current renewable carbon source to extract liquid fuels, chemicals and polymeric materials produced conventionally from petroleum [2]. In this scenario, biomass holds great promise to afford the fascinating prospect of sustainable future. To this end, biorefinery, which is defined as the production processes that integrate numerous technologies and facilities to convert biomass resources (primarily the inedible parts) into a wide variety of chemicals, materials and energy, has been recently presented [3,4]. Platform chemicals stemmed from lignocellulose, the most abundant biomass resource on the Earth, are important intermediates during biorefinery, which is a bridge between raw biomass and end-products including value-added chemicals, materials and fuels [5]. To date, a large amount of research contributed to the chemical and/or biological transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into platform molecules, which include 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) [6], furfural [7], levulinic acid (LA) [8], γ-valerolactone (GVL) [9], and succinic acid [10], etc. Among these biomass-derived platform molecules, HMF is hailed as a “sleeping giant” thanks to a broad range of potential applications of HMF (as shown in Scheme 1) [6]. It is well-known that HMF can be readily prepared with high yields from hexoses in the presence of acid catalysts in various solvents, especially in ionic liquids [11]. Both oxidation and hydrogenation of HMF offer access to useful monomers for polymers and/or precursors for biofuels. HMF can be oxidized to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), adipic acid, and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan carboxylic acid, which can be used as a new family of polymeric monomers [12,13]. The reduction of HMF gives diols, including 2,5-bishydroxymethyl furan (BHMF), 2,5-bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTF), and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD), which can be served as the building blocks for biobased polyesters [12]. Furthermore, these diols can also be converted to potential biofuel candidates. For instance, the hydrogenolysis of BHMF and BHMTF give 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), which are a new-fashioned liquid biofuel due to their similar properties (such as energy density, boiling point, and water solubility) to commercial gasoline and high octane number [14–16]. 2,5-Bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs) derived from the etherification of BHMF and alcohols have much higher cetane number than that of commercial diesel and are completely miscible with commercial diesel at blend rates below 40vol% [17–19]. HMF also can be applied as the precursor for the production of “drop-in” liquid fuels (C9–C15 alkanes) by aqueous-phase processing [20]. In addition, HMF can be converted into value-added chemicals used in pharmaceuticals, flavors and fragrances, through these above mentioned diols [12]. Van Putten et al. have comprehensively reviewed the general mechanistic aspects of the formation of HMF by the dehydration reaction of carbohydrates as well as the catalytic upgrading of HMF [12]. However, the catalytic valorization of HMF into a wide spectrum of useful products has already become a booming topic of research in biorefinery, and relevant references published are growing exponentially in recent years. The hydrogenation of HMF is of particular interest to provide polymeric monomers. On the other hand, biomass-derived molecules are extensively oxygenated in comparison to petroleum-derived chemicals; therefore, the removal of oxygen from these molecules by hydrogenation is the crucial step for the upgrading of biomass-derived chemicals to produce fuels. At this point, gaining more insights into the chemoseletive hydrogenation of HMF to these diols is of particular importance for the catalytic upgrading of HMF. However, it is challenging to control the degree of the reduction of HMF, since HMF has several highly active moieties containing furan ring, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. In this review, the latest advances in the catalytic conversion of HMF to diols, including BHMF, BHMTF and 1,6-HD, are selectively summarized in terms of the diversity of hydrogen sources and catalysts. We also discuss challenges and opportunities in addressing a number of high volume markets for biofuels and polymeric materials through HMF-derived diols."
1,The chemistry of the hydrogenation of HMF,"As shown in Scheme 2, a large number of products could form by the hydrogenation of HMF. In view of the highly functionalized nature of HMF, it is a great challenge to selectively hydrogenate HMF into desired products with high yields [21]. Multiple reactions could take place during the hydrogenation of HMF, including the hydrogenation of carboxyl group or furan ring, the removal of hydroxyl or carboxyl group, and the ring-opening of furan or tetrahydrofuran (Scheme 2). It is no doubt that the reaction pathway and product distribution for the hydrogenation of HMF are strongly dependent upon reaction conditions and catalysts used. For example, Ru based catalysts favor the hydrogenation of C=O to give BHMF at relatively low temperatures, which would further convert to DMF via hydrogenolysis at relatively high temperatures with 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA), 5-methylfurfural (MF), and 2,5-hexanedione (HD) being detected as intermediate and/or by-products, respectively [22]. However, Pd based catalysts possess the high activity for the hydrogenation of furan ring or the removal of carboxyl group to give BHMTF or furfuryl alcohol respectively, which could further convert into deeply hydrogenated products including 5-methyltetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (MTHFA), DMTHF, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), or 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) [23,24]. On the other hand, the ring-opening of BHMTF would occur to offer 1,6-HD through 1,2,6-hexanetriol (1,2,6-HT) over active metals with the assistance of acid catalysts, with 1,5-HD and 1-hexanol being observed as by-products [25]. In this review, we specifically focused on the selective reduction of HMF into valuable diols, including BHMF, BHMTF and 1,6-HD."
2,Selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF,"BHMF is a versatile diol with a wide range of applications, including the synthesis of fine chemicals and artificial receptors in molecular recognition research [26,27], the preparation of new functionalized polyethers [28], furanic polyamides [29] and polyurethanes [30], and the synthesis of multiheteromacrocycles in pharmaceuticals [31,32]. BHMF forms by the selective hydrogenation of C=O in HMF, which is also regarded as the intermediate for the formation of biofuel DMF (as shown in Scheme 2). As shown in Table 1, we summarize the research progress of BHMF formation in terms of the diversity of hydrogen sources, which include external molecular H2, alcohols, formic acid, and water. Furthermore, the effects of reaction parameters such as catalysts, solvents, and temperature on the products distribution are also discussed."
3,Employing molecular H2 as the hydrogen source,"3.1 Employing molecular H2 as the hydrogen source The reduction of HMF with molecular H2 has been extensively studied, especially over heterogeneous catalysts. Few works concentrated on the selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF catalyzed by homogeneous catalysts. For instance, Mazzoni et al. studied the selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF catalyzed by homogeneous Ru-based Shvo’s catalyst in toluene under mild conditions, and an optimal BHMF of 99% was obtained at 90°C in 1h under an initial H2 pressure of 10bar [33]. However, the resulting BHMF showed an inhibition effect to the HMF reduction under the given conditions, probably due to the interaction between BHMF and the catalyst. More interestingly, Mazzoni et al. provided a simple approach to isolate BHMF from the reaction mixture by cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, which would result in quantitative precipitation of BHMF [33]. Nevertheless, bear in mind that Ru-based Shvo’s catalyst is very expensive with poor performance in recyclability. In this context, heterogeneous catalysts have gained much more attentions thanks to its cost-effective and recoverability. A large number of supported noble metal catalysts were tested and displayed good activity for the conversion of HMF to BHMF. For example, Au/Al2O3 was prepared for the hydrogenation of HMF in water, with the highest BHMF yield of 96% being archived at 120°C in 2h under an initial H2 pressure of 65bar [34]. Recently, supported Ru and Pt catalysts gave a superior activity for the selective reduction of HMF to BHMF in water under mild conditions (35°C, 2h, 8bar H2) [35,36]. Apart from the active metals, supports also considerably affected the hydrogenation of HMF. For instance, a BHMF selectivity of only 69.7% was obtained at a completed HMF conversion at 50°C in 3h under a starting H2 pressure of 60bar over Ir/C, whereas Ir/TiO2 gave the optimal BHMF selectivity of 95.4% at the same conditions [24]. The excellent catalytic activity of Ir/TiO2 was attributed to the promotion of the special defect sites (Ti3+ or oxygen vacancies) formed by the interaction between active metal and reductive support at the Ir-Ti interfacial region, which can coordinate and activate the C=O group during the selective hydrogenation of HMF [24]. The above observations clearly suggest that both active metal species and supports dominate the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the catalysts for the hydrogenation of HMF. Note that the catalyst activity was also strongly associated with the solvents used. Polar protic solvents showed superior performance for the HMF conversion compared to polar aprotic or nonpolar solvents. In the case of Pt/MCM-41 applied as the catalyst, the HMF conversion decreased in the following order: water (100%)>methanol (72.1%)>ethanol (55.6%)>propanol (27.2%)>butanol (24.4%)>acetone (12.0%)>hexane (10.1%) under the same conditions [35]. Diverse solubility of H2 in these solvents as well as the interaction between solvents and catalysts might be responsible for the difference in the catalytic activity of Pt/MCM-41 in these solvents. Additionally, if the hydrogenation of HMF was carried out in mixed solvents such as water/tetrahydrofuran (THF), a small amounts of water (5wt%) would lead to significant decrease in the rate of BHMF formation, owing to the competitive adsorption between H2O and HMF on the active sites [37,38]. The acidity of solution also largely affected the product distribution for the hydrogenation of HMF. As shown in Scheme 3, C6-polyols which include 1,2,6-HT, 1,2,5-hexanetriol (1,2,5-HT), and 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol (1,2,5,6-HT), could form by the acid-catalyzed ring-opening and subsequent hydrogenation of BHMF [39]. It should be pointed out that acidic impurities present in the HMF feed probably originated from the remaining acid catalysts (such as H2SO4) for the HMF production by dehydration of carbohydrates, or from by-products (LA) formed by the degradation of HMF. Given the economy of catalysts, base metals are highly desirable for the selective reduction of HMF to BHMF. However, more severe conditions are probably required for base metal catalysts to achieve BHMF yields similar to those in the case of precious metals, which could bring about deeply hydrogenated products such as DMF. For instance, Cu-ZnO prepared by Zhu et al. demonstrated a temperature-dependent activity for the selective hydrogenation of HMF towards BHMF or DMF, which gave the highest BHMF or DMF yield of 99.1% or 91.8% at 100°C or 220°C, respectively [40]. Cu/SiO2 [18] and copper-doped porous metal oxides (Cu-PMO) [41] also showed the similar catalytic selectivity for the hydrogenation of HMF. One can thus conclude that the hydrogenation of carboxyl group to hydroxyl group could proceed at relatively low temperature, whereas the cleavage of C–O bond could occur at relatively high temperature. Compared to the pure monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts could display extraordinary activity for the selective hydrogenation of HMF. For example, Ni-Fe/CNTs provided BHMF yield up to 96.1% at 110°C over 18h, whereas BHMF yield of only 76.4% and no HMF conversion were achieved over Ni/CNTs or Fe/CNTs under the identical conditions, respectively [42]. DFT calculations suggested that the addition of oxyphilic Fe to form Ni-Fe alloy is beneficial to stabilize the η 2-(C,O) surface species, which promotes the hydrogenation of carboxyl group to hydroxyl group on the bimetallic alloy due to a strong interaction between the carbonyl O and the oxyphilic Fe atoms [43]. Similarly, CuZn alloy gave a comparable BHMF yield under the reaction conditions similar to those in the case of Ni-Fe/CNTs [44]. Bimetallic catalysts containing noble metals could further allow milder conditions for the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF. For instance, Ir-ReO x /SiO2 acted as a highly active and selective catalyst to give BHMF yield up to 99% at 30°C in 6h under an initial H2 pressure of 8bar [45]. Moreover, PtSn/Al2O3 also displayed paralleled catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of HMF at mild conditions (60°C, 5h, 82% BHMF yield) [46]."
4,Employing alcohols as the hydrogen source,"3.2 Employing alcohols as the hydrogen source Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) offers a promising alternative to traditional hydrogenation processes with external molecular H2. In particular, aldehyde or ketones can be exclusively reduced to corresponding alcohols through Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction using other alcohols as the H-donors [47]. Alcohols, such as ethanol and 2-propanol, are more convenient and safe hydrogen sources than molecular H2 to some extent during storage, transportation and use, since alcohols usually exist in its liquid state at ambient conditions. Moreover, additional facilities for the H2 delivery are unnecessary if alcohols are used as the hydrogen source, resulting in a decrease in the number of unit operations for the hydrogenation processing. Numerous base metal catalysts are highly effective for MPV reduction, which could further improve the economy of the hydrogenation of aldehydes or ketones by MPV reduction. In view of the advantages described above, the CTH using alcohols as the H-donors has currently attracted intensive attention in the catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived aldehydes or ketones. For example, the CTH of LA and its esters to GVL, a versatile biomass-derived platform molecule [9], has been developed over numerous heterogeneous catalysts [48–50]. However, there is rarely study on the selective hydrogen of HMF to BHMF by MPV reduction. Recently, Jae et al. presented a CTH process for the upgrading of HMF to biofuel DMF in 2-propanol over Ru/C, which acted as a multifunctional catalyst for both the hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of HMF and the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol [51]. In this process, BHMF was just detected as an intermediate with carbon yield up to 38% at 150°C, indicating that Ru/C is lack of catalytic selectivity towards BHMF. It should be emphasized here that molecular H2 with acetone formed by the decomposition of 2-propanol over Ru/C, rather than by MPV reduction which proceeds by hydride transfer [48]. Besides, Lewis acid zeolites (such as Sn-beta) displayed good activity for the CTH of HMF to BHMF by MPV reduction. The resulting BHMF, however, would further readily convert to 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furan by the etherification with alcohols over acidic zeolites [52,53]. Apparently, the acidity of Lewis acid zeolites should be responsible for the etherification of BHMF. 2,5-Bis(alkoxymethyl)furan containing two ether linkages possesses a rather high miscibility in commercial diesel as well as a high energy density, which makes it a promising biodiesel component [52]. Based on the above discussion, it is still a challenge for the selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF by MPV reduction. Recently, Hao et al. reported that ZrO(OH)2 could effectively catalyze MPV reduction of HMF to give BHMF yield up to 83.7% at 150°C in ethanol over 2.5h [54]. Moreover, acetal and etherification products of HMF and/or BHMF were also detected as the by-products (Compounds 1-5, Scheme 4). Nevertheless, ZrO(OH)2 catalyst almost lost the half of its initial activity after consecutive five times use [54], indicating that ongoing study should be focused on the development of highly selective and stable catalysts for MPV reduction of HMF. The activity of the reducing alcohols used in MPV reduction relies greatly on their reduction potential ( Table 2). The reduction potential (ΔfHº) is defined as the difference of the standard molar enthalpy of formation between the alcohol and the corresponding carbonyl compound, which reflects the ease of hydrogen abstraction [47,55]. As shown in Table 2, the reduction potential of various alcohols increased in the order of: 2-propanol≈2-butanol<1-butanol<ethanol<methanol. The secondary alcohols (2-propanol or 2-butanol) are considered as the best H-donors for MPV reduction because these alcohols have the lowest reduction potential. However, methanol has a much higher reduction potential than other alcohols, resulting in an inferior performance in MPV reduction. Moreover, the steric hindrance of alcohols also should be taken into account. For example, 2-butanol has a ΔfHº similar to 2-propanol, although the latter could give relatively high selectivity towards desired product by MPV reduction [49]. More interestingly, Pasini et al. recently found that methanol could be applied as an effective H-donor for MPV reduction of HMF to BHMF in mild conditions over MgO, with almost 100% yield of BHMF being achieved at 160°C in 3h [56]. In this case, only BHMF was detected in the liquid phase after reaction, with CO, CO2 and CH4 being obtained as the gaseous products. Further study of reaction mechanism by means of experiments and DFT calculations revealed that formaldehyde formed by the dehydrogenation of methanol could react with remaining methanol to yield hemiacetal, which also could be act as the H-donor for MPV reduction of HMF to give dehydrogenated product methylformate. As shown in Scheme 5, methylformate could further decomposed into CO, CO2 and CH4 over MgO under the given conditions, which are easily separated from the reaction mixture [56]. On the other hand, methanol is hailed as a promising hydrogen source by catalytic reforming into H2, CO and/or CO2 over Cu based catalysts [57,58]. However, methanol reforming usually requires a rather harsh conditions (300°C) compared to those applied in the hydrogenation of C=O bond, which would lead to the hydrogenolysis of BHMF to give DMF as the primary product [59]. In addition, renewable diol 1,4-butanediol (BDO) was also successfully employed as the H-donor for the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF by MPV reduction, giving BHMF yield up to 93% at 220°C over Cu/AlO x in a continuous flow reactor; however, increasing the residence time of HMF would result in the formation of DMF via the hydrogenolysis of BHMF [60]. Note that one molecule of BDO could provide two molecules of H2, and then converted to γ-butyrolactone (GBL) by ring-closure reaction, which also is a useful intermediate in the synthesis of fine chemicals [61]."
5,Employing FA as the hydrogen source,"3.3 Employing FA as the hydrogen source FA is also regarded as a promising hydrogen storage material which can provide H2 by catalytic decomposition [62,63]. Especially considering that FA is an important by-product during the acid-catalyzed degradation of carbohydrates to LA, employing FA as hydrogen source for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived compounds thus embodies the principle of atom economy to some extent [64–66]. Various works have been performed to employ FA as the in-situ hydrogen donor for the LA hydrogenation to GVL [9], but only few studies contributed so far to the hydrogenation of HMF using FA as the hydrogen donor. Thananatthanachon et al. found that various homogeneous Ir-based catalysts exhibited outstanding activity for the reduction of HMF to BHMF using FA as the in-situ H-donor [67]. For example, Cp*Ir(TsDPEN) provided BHMF yield up to 99% at very mild conditions in THF (40°C, 2h). These catalysts, however, showed poor tolerance to FA, and lost half of its initial catalytic activity within only several minutes [67]. These homogeneous noble metal catalysts also suffer from high cost and poor recyclability; therefore, highly active and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts are highly desirable. To this end, Pd/C was found to be capable of catalyzing the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF using FA as the hydrogen source, giving BHMF yield up to 94.0% in refluxing THF over 4h [68]. With the assistance of H2SO4, the resulting BHMF could further convert to DMF over Pd/C by the esterification with FA in tandem with deoxygenation."
6,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF,"3.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (EH) is recognized to be a clean process for the reduction of HMF to BHMF, because ubiquitous water can be used as the hydrogen source via EH under ambient conditions. Recently, Kwon et al. studied the EH of HMF on numerous metal electrodes in a neutral Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and the highest BHMF concentration of 13.1mMcm-2 (based on the surface area of metal) was obtained on a Ag electrode at −0.81V with a BHMF selectivity greater than 85% [69]. Pb electrode also gave BHMF selectivity up to 77% from HMF in a phosphate buffer (pH=7) [70]. BHMF formation and selectivity were confirmed to be highly susceptible to the applied potentials and metal electrodes used. More negative potentials largely promoted the evolution of hydrogen and the hydrogenolysis of HMF and/or BHMF at the cost of BHMF formation, especially hydrogenolysis products such as DMF would even become the main product on a Cu electrode [69]. On the other hand, BHMF formation and Faradaic efficiency are significantly influenced by the pH of electrolytes. For example, BHMF formation less than 1.5mMcm-2 was obtained at all electrodes and potentials in acidic solution (0.5M H2SO4), and the hydrogenation of furan ring occurred to give 2,5-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrofuran (DMDHF) and BHMTF as the main products [71]. More interestingly, HMF could be converted to 2,5-hexanedione (HD) by ring-opening and subsequent reduction in a 0.2M sulfate buffer (pH 2.0), with HD selectivity and Faradaic efficiency of 81.6% and 72.4% being measured at −1.2V on a Zn electrode [72]. On the contrary, both the Faradaic efficiency and BHMF selectivity nearing 100% were achieved using a Ag catalytic electrode at −1.3V in a 0.5M borate buffer (pH 9.2); however, the highest BHMF formation of only 0.19mMcm-2 was offered at −1.7V in this alkaline electrolyte [73]. In addition, note that the use for buffers in electrocatalytic systems could bring desalination process for the separation/purification of BHMF. Based on the previous reports, a plausible mechanism for the electrocatalytic reduction of HMF on metal electrodes was presented by Choi and co-workers [73]. As shown in Scheme 6, HMF reduction could proceed through the transfer of H+ and e- on metal electrodes at relatively positive potentials (purple arrows in Scheme 6). On the other hand, H2 evolution could be largely improved at more negative potentials, and resulted in the formation of adsorbed H species (Hads) on the surface of electrode, which also drive the reduction of HMF to BHMF. Water is a highly desirable H-donor by electrocatalytic hydrogenation, as it is ubiquitous compared to other H-donors. However, electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF suffers from low efficiency and complicated minor products as well as dilemma in separation arose from buffers. Clearer mechanism for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF is also needed to be elaborated."
7,Alternative processes for the BHMF production,"3.5 Alternative processes for the BHMF production In addition to the hydrogen sources mentioned above, HMF itself also can be used as the hydrogen source to produce BHMF by Cannizzaro reaction, which is a base-induced disproportionation reaction of an aldehyde lacking a hydrogen atom in the α-position. Recently, Kang et al. proposed a novel approach to produce BHMF from HMF by Cannizzaro reaction in ionic liquid ([EMIm]TFSI) in the presence of NaOH (as shown in Scheme 7) [74,75]. High selectivity towards BHMF was obtained at room temperature, although almost half of initial HMF dehydrogenated to form 5-hydroxymethylfuranoic acid (HMFA) and excessive amounts of base were consumed (5-fold of HMF). Besides, furfuryl alcohol could be effectively converted to BHMF by selective hydroxymethylation with formaldehyde over zeolite catalysts, offering a promising alternative to the BHMF production from the hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulose (as shown in Scheme 7) [76–78]."
8,Selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF,"BHMTF is a green solvent or monomer, as it is degradable, less toxic, and more stable compared to unsaturated furan compounds [79]. BHMTF is also a precursor for the synthesis value-added chemicals and biofuels, such as 8-oxa-3-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane hydrochloride [80], and DMTHF [81]. Selected reports for the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF are collected in Table 3. In comparison to the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMF, more active catalysts are required for the reduction of furan ring in HMF to give BHMTF. In this context, Pd-based catalysts displayed superior activity for the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF. For example, Pd/C allowed a BHMTF yield of 89.3% at mild conditions of 50°C and 3h, whereas BHMF became the main product over Ru/C, Ir/C or Pt/C under the same reaction conditions [24]. However, the resulting BHMTF could further hydrogenated to DMTHF at a higher temperature (120°C) in the presence of Pd/C [82]. In generally, Ru-based catalysts are highly active for both hydrogenation and subsequent hydrogenolysis of HMF to give DMF [22]. Interestingly, the hydrogenolysis of HMF could be largely suppressed and the hydrogenation of C=C in furan ring of HMF could be significantly promoted over Ru-based catalysts in a biphasic solvent system. For example, Ru/CeO x gave BHMTF yield up to 91.0% at 130°C in 12h in a 1-butanol/water biphasic system [39]. A biphasic solvent system composed of water and cyclohexane also enabled a highly selectivity towards BHMTF via HMF hydrogenation over Ru/SiO2 under the conditions similar to those in the case of Ru/CeO x [83]. The catalyst supports also significantly influence the catalytic activity for the selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF. In generally, supports with high surface area favor the dispersion of active metal particles on the surface of supports, which in turn provide more active catalytic sites for the hydrogenation reactions. At this point, Cai et al. found that the catalytic performance of Pd supported on activated carbon (AC), Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and Mg-Al hydrotalcite (HT) showed strongly positive correlation with the surface area of the support, and Pd/AC with the highest surface area of 770.6m2/g gave the highest BHMTF yield [24]. More recently, Chen et al. prepared palladium catalyst supported on amine-functionalized Metal-Organic Frameworks (Pd/MIL-101(Al)-NH2) which gave the highest BHMTF yield of 96% at 30°C in 12h [84]. The free amine moieties in the frameworks of MIL-101(Al)-NH2 were considered to promote the formation of uniform and well-dispersed palladium nanoparticles, which is beneficial to the adsorption and hydrogenation of intermediate BHMF on the support. Non-precious metal catalysts are highly attractive for hydrogenation reactions as its paralleled activity and universal availability compared to noble metals. Nevertheless, more severe reaction conditions are generally required for the hydrogenation of HMF over non-precious metals. For instance, Ni-based catalysts (Raney Ni or Ni/Al2O3) showed tunable activity for the HMF hydrogenation depending on reaction temperature, giving BHMTF yields greater than 96% at 60–100°C and DMF or DMTHF yields greater than 97.5% at 180°C, respectively [25,85–87]. Raney Co also displayed similar catalytic activity to offer BHMTF yield up to 95.8% at 120°C in 4h [88]. Moreover, a Ni-Pd bimetallic catalyst (Ni–Pd/SiO2, Ni/Pd=7) was found to be more active and selective than commercial Raney Ni or Pd/C for the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF, with BHMTF yield up to 96% being achieved at 40°C in 2h in aqueous solution [89]. This highly selective activity of Ni–Pd/SiO2 probably should be attributed to the formation of Ni–Pd alloy which results in synergistic effect for the hydrogenation of C=O and C=C in HMF. Nakagawa et al. also found that Pd-Ir/SiO2 enabled a high BHMTF yield (95%) at very mild conditions (2°C, 4h), and the superior activity of Pd-Ir/SiO2 was ascribed to the promotion of Ir in the adsorption of C=O [90]."
9,"Selective hydrogenation of HMF to 1,6-hexanediol","1,6-Hexanediol (1,6-HD) is a value-added building block with a broad range of applications in polyurethane, coatings, polyesters and adhesives [91–94], which is prepared industrially by cyclohexane oxidation, esterification and hydrogenation in series. For instance, 1,6-HD can be catalytically converted to caprolactam, the monomer for nylon-6 which is a widely used synthetic polymer, by consecutive oxidation, ring-closure and amination [25]. 1,6-HD also can be used as the starting material for the production of 6-hydroxycaproic acid (HCA) and adipic acid, which has broad potential applications in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and even in the polymer industry [95,96]. Recently, several catalytic processes have been successfully developed to produce 1,6-HD from HMF over different solid catalysts (as shown in Scheme 8). Buntara et al. proposed an effective one-pot process for the conversion of BHMTF to 1,6-HD with yield up to 86% at 120°C in 20h in the presence of Rh-Re/SiO2 and solid acid Nafion SAC-13 [25]. Specifically, BHMTF first underwent the ring-opening under a low H2 pressure of 10bar, followed by the hydrogenation to yield 1,2,6-hexanetriol (1,2,6-HT) under a high H2 pressure of 80bar (both the above two reactions took place over Rh-Re/SiO2). The resulting 1,2,6-HT was then subjected to the intramolecular etherification to form six-membered cyclic intermediate tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-ylmethanol (2-THPM) over Nafion SAC-13, which further converted to desired 1,6-HD by consecutive ring-opening and hydrogenation over Rh-Re/SiO2 under the given conditions [25,97]. Only a small amounts of 1,2,6-HT could be converted to 1,6-HD over Rh-Re/SiO2 in the absence of solid acid catalysts, indicating that the direct hydrodeoxygenation of 1,2,6-HT to 1,6-HD has a high energy barrier under the given conditions [98]. The superior performance of Rh-Re/SiO2 in the ring-opening and hydrogenolysis of 2-THPM to 1,6-HD was attributed to the synergistic effect of acidic and active metals sites on the catalyst surface [99,100]. The above report opens up a new opportunity access to traditional synthetic polymer market using biomass-derived HMF as the starting material. However, it is still challenging to afford 1,6-HD directly from HMF, because sequential multistep reactions participated from HMF to 1,6-HD (especially totally different reaction conditions may be required for each step). For instance, only a 1,6-HD yield less than 4% from HMF was achieved in the presence of CuCr catalyst with Pd/C under severe conditions (270°C, 150bar H2, 16h) [25]. Inspired by Buntara’s work, Xiao et al. designed double layered catalysts comprising of Pd/SiO2 (the upper) and Ir–ReO x /SiO2 (the bottom) in a fixed-bed reactor, in which the selective hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF and the following ring-opening and hydrodeoxygenation of BHMTF to 1,6-HD were took place in series to give an improved 1,6-HD yield of 57.8% (100°C, 70bar H2) [101]. In this case, a water/THF mixture solvent was employed for the production of 1,6-HD from HMF, and the presence of water was confirmed to be of central importance to the catalytic ring-opening of BHMTF. No 1,6-HD was detected in the product in the absence of water [101]. However, note that around 20% and 10% of HMF were converted to 1,5-HD and hexane over the double layered catalysts, respectively. In addition, active metals are also capable of varying significantly the product distribution of HMF hydrogenation by tuning the adsorption behavior of the substrate on the active sites [88]. Formic acid can also be employed as the H-donor for the 1,6-HD production from HMF. Pd/ZrP catalyst was prepared and acted as a multifunctional catalyst for the hydrogen production from the formic acid decomposition and the ring-opening/hydrogenation of HMF [102]. The high Brønsted/Lewis acid site ratio on ZrP support was considered to effectively accelerate the cleavage of C–O bond in a furan ring, bringing about 1,6-HD yield up to 43.6% in the presence of formic acid at 140°C in 21h [102]. Differing from the previous reports under high pressure of H2, the direct ring-opening and hydrogenation of HMF was found to be the primary route to give 1,6-HD over Pd/ZrP in the presence of formic acid. This route seems to occur in parallel to the hydrogenation of HMF to BHMTF, because the relatively low H2 pressure stemmed from the formic acid decomposition probably failed to drive the hydrogenolysis of the tetrahydrofuran ring in BHMTF [25]."
10,"Brief discussion on the industrial prospect of HMF, HMF-derived monomers and biofuels","Up until now, there is no one report on the production of HMF-derived diols or biofuels on a large or even bench/pilot scale, primarily because of the limited availability of HMF. Several kilogram-scale attempts for the HMF production from biomass-derived carbohydrates were performed [12], and technoeconomic evaluations conducted by Anex et al. estimated that the selling price of HMF as low as around 1.33 $/L could be viable for a plant based on the fructose input of 300 tons/day [103]. However, there is no such a strong market pull to produce HMF on that large scale, because there is so far no high volume markets for HMF and HMF-derived products. For instance, 1,6-HD coming from HMF is not yet cost-competitive with petroleum-derived 1,6-HD. On the other hand, BHMF, BHMTF, DMF, and BAMFs are new families of polymeric monomers and biofuels, which would take time to find their own place in the market. To date, only few bulk chemicals can be commercially produced from lignocellulosic biomass. For instance, furfural can be prepared from biomass-derived carbohydrates (hemicellulose) with an annual output of about 250,000 tons, mainly because furfural has bulk-scale applications in oil reﬁning, plastics, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries [104]. In this context, it is highly attractive to broaden the application areas of both HMF and its derivatives. At the same time, investigating the physicochemical and/or fuel properties of polymeric materials containing BHMF or BHMTF unit and HMF-derived biofuels including DMF and BAMFs is also of significance to address high volume markets by these biomass-derived products. Additionally, seeking more effective and economical catalytic systems for the valorization of HMF into valuable products such as monomers and biofuels is of crucial importance to cut down production cost, and this topic is the highlight of this review."
11,Conclusions,"HMF-derived diols, including BHMF, BHMTF, and 1,6-HD, are key intermediates for the catalytic valorization of HMF into chemicals, polymeric materials, and liquid fuels. The majority of studies on BHMF formation concentrated so far on using H2 as the reducing agent over numerous heterogeneous noble or base metal catalysts. As shown in Table 1, noble metal catalysts showed outstanding performance on the BHMF production in aqueous solution, whereas non-precious metals only displayed the similar catalytic activity in organic solvents, such as alcohols and 1,4-dioxane. It is highly desirable to develop the catalytic systems for the BHMF formation over base metal catalysts in water, from the perspective of economy. To this end, bimetallic catalysts could be a promising solution to offer robust catalysts that are able to tolerate water environment, benefiting from the synergistic effect of the active metals. In addition, MPV reduction of HMF is an appealing alternative to give exclusive selectivity towards BHMF by using alcohols and non-noble metals as the H-donor and catalysts, respectively. Especially BHMF could be further transferred in-situ into biofuel components BAMFs by the etherification with H-donors (namely, alcohols) [52,53]. However, effective and stable catalysts containing tunable Lewis/Brønsted acidic sites for MPV reduction of HMF to BHMF and/or the subsequent etherification to BAMFs are still mostly uncharted territory. The conversion of HMF to BHMTF requires highly active bifunctional catalysts for the hydrogenation of both C=O and C=C bonds in HMF, but these catalysts should be inert for the hydrogenolysis of hydroxyl group in BHMTF under the applied conditions. At this point, Pd based catalysts showed superior performance on BHMTF formation, and further investigation on the interaction between active metals and moieties is still needed for the preparation of catalysts that have high selectivity towards BHMTF. In addition, the study on the conversion of HMF to 1,6-HD by consecutive ring-opening and hydrodeoxygenation is still in its infancy. There is ambiguous mechanism for the ring-opening of furan ring by the scission of C–O bond in furan ring. Therefore, an in-depth study on the scission of C–O bond and the preparation of multifunctional catalysts for the 1,6-HD formation from HMF are of particular significance."
