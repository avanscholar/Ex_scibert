0,Introduction,"Increasing interest in carbohydrates as a source of chemicals and energy has recently arisen due to the limited fossil fuel resources and the demand for new clean chemical processes [1]. Furfural is one of the key derivatives which can be obtained from renewable biomass for the production of different important non-petroleum-based chemicals. Furfural can be produced by dehydration of pentosans like xylose in the presence of acidic catalysts [1,2]. There are many reports in literature devoted to the dehydration of xylose to furfural over heterogeneous catalysts. It was shown that Brönsted acidity plays a key role in the selective dehydration of xylose to furfural [3]. Zeolites such as mordenite and faujasite give a high selectivity (80–95%) at a conversion of up to 50% at a reaction temperature of 170°C [4]. Catalysts on the bases of sulfonic acid groups, like industrial Amberlyst-15 or sulfonic acid anchored MCM-41, have shown to be effective catalysts for the dehydration of xylose to furfural with a selectivity higher than 70% at full conversion of xylose [5]. All these reactions were conducted in biphasic systems using water and organic solvents like methyl isobutyl ketone, butanol or toluene. It was shown by the group of Dumesic that the addition of an organic solvent leads to a suppression of consecutive furfural transformations resulting in a significant increase of the selectivity of the process [6]. Hydrogenation of furfural is one of the most interesting ways to transform it into more valuable products such as furfuryl alcohol [7,8], tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol [9], 2-methylfuran [10] or cyclopentanone [11]. The most popular catalysts for these reactions are Pt, Pd, Ru and Cu supported on carbon, alumina or silica [7–11]. The hydrogenation is usually conducted in the liquid phase in a solvent. The reaction conditions required for the furfural hydrogenation (T =120−170°C, p =1–5MPa) are similar those for the xylose dehydration. The xylose dehydration in the aqueous phase can therefore be combined with the furfural hydrogenation in an organic phase in one vessel, thus reducing production costs and improving selectivity. Possible problems are the unwanted xylose hydrogenation into xylitol, which decreases the selectivity of the process [12], and the interaction of metallic catalyst particles with acid sites, which might lead to leaching of the metal [13]. In this paper we present a new strategy that solves these problems. This strategy is based on the application of a biphasic reactor with localization of the hydrophobic Ru/C hydrogenation catalyst in the organic phase and the hydrophilic Amberlyst-15 dehydration catalyst in the aqueous phase. Ru was chosen because of its high selectivity in the hydrogenation of biomass derived products [14,15]. Amberlyst-15 is an active heterogeneous acidic catalyst for the xylose dehydration [5]. The combination of Ru/C and ion exchange resin Amberlyst was already reported earlier for the glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-propanediol in an aqueous phase [16,17]. In our process, dehydration of xylose into furfural in the aqueous phase is followed by furfural extraction to the organic phase with a subsequent hydrogenation over Ru/C for the production of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is an important compound widely used for different applications. It has been shown that modified Re and Mo oxide catalysts are very active in the chemoselective hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol to 1,5-pentanediol, which can be used as a renewable monomer for the production of polyesters and polyurethanes [18–20]. Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol can also be also applied as a green solvent [21], in the synthesis of plasticizers [22] and pyridine [23]. The objectives in our study were to determine the influence of organic solvents like 1-butanol, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and cyclohexane in a biphasic system on the activity and selectivity of Ru/C in furfural hydrogenation. We will compare this combined biphasic process of xylose dehydration with furfural hydrogenation with single phase processing in aqueous or organic solvent."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The powdered ruthenium on carbon catalyst (Ru/C) with 5wt.% Ru was purchased from Janssen Chimica. Amberlyst-15 in hydrogen form with 50% water was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) (99%), cyclohexane (99.5%), and 1-butanol (99%) were used as solvents and were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Furfural (98%) was purchased from Merck. Xylose (99%), furfuryl alcohol (98%), 1,3-cyclopentanediol (95%), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (99%), 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone (99%) were purchased from Sigma−Aldrich."
3,Characterization,2.2 Characterization The solubility of xylose in organic solvents was studied by the addition of 0.5g xylose to 50ml of solvent. The partition ratio of furfural and products of furfural hydrogenation between the organic solvent and water (R=Corg/Caq) was studied by the addition of 5mmol into a mixture of 50ml solvent and 50ml of water. The mixtures were stirred for 0.5h at 25°C. The dissolved compounds were determined chromatographically. The stability of Amberlyst-15 was checked by titration of the catalyst before and after stirring for 6h in an autoclave at 165°C in water.
4,Catalysis,"2.3 Catalysis Experiments were carried out in a 2-l stirred autoclave working in a batch mode and equipped with two valves for sampling the liquid from the aqueous and organic phases. The procedure for testing catalysts in the reaction of furfural or furfuryl alcohol hydrogenation was as follows: furfural (5g) or furfuryl alcohol (5g), catalyst Ru/C (0.4g) and water (300ml) and/or organic solvent (300ml, in the case of experiments with solvent) were poured into the autoclave. In some hydrogenation experiments, Amberlyst-15 (10g) was added to the furfural or furfuryl alcohol solutions to study its possible effect on the hydrogenation. The procedure for testing catalysts in the xylose dehydration combined with hydrogenation was as follows: xylose (10g), Ru/C catalyst (0.4 or 0.8g), Amberlyst-15 catalyst (10 or 5g), water (300ml) and organic solvent (10,300 or 600ml, in the case of experiments with solvent) were poured into the autoclave. The autoclave was purged with hydrogen, the temperature was increased to 165 or 135°C and thereafter the catalytic experiment was started. The initial pressure of hydrogen was kept at 2.5 or 4MPa. The agitation speed was 300rpm. This speed provided adequate mixing in each phase without a transfer of catalyst between the phases. Periodically liquid samples were taken from the autoclave. The amount of xylose and xylitol in the samples was analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu) equipped with a refractive index and UV–Vis detectors with a BIO-RAD Aminex HPX-87H column. Furfural and the products of its hydrogenation were analyzed by GC (Varian CP-3800) in a non-polar capillary column VF-1ms with linear heating from 50 to 250°C during analysis. The quantitative determination of the reaction products was made by using an external standard methanol for aqueous phase and pentane for organic solvents. Products were identified by GC–MS (Shimadzu 2010 Plus) and by the use of pure compounds. Reactant conversion (mol%) and product selectivity (mol%) was deﬁned as follows: Conversion (mol%)=(moles of xylose or furfural of furfuryl alcohol reacted)/(moles of initial xylose or furfural or furfuryl alcohol)×100 Selectivity (mol%)=(moles of product produced)/(moles of xylose or furfural of furfuryl alcohol reacted)×100."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Furfural hydrogenation,"3.1 Furfural hydrogenation The conversion of furfural versus time during the furfural hydrogenation in water, organic solvents and biphasic water-organic solvent systems is shown in Fig. 1 . The initial rates of the hydrogenation of furfural over Ru/C are high for aqueous phase (80mmol/gh), 1-butanol (72mmol/gh) and 1-butanol–water system (47mmol/gh) (Table 1). The lower rates of hydrogenation Ru/C demonstrates in MTHF (25mmol/gh), MTHF-water (25mmol/gh) and cyclohexane–water (20mmol/gh). In all cases furfural is almost fully converted after 5h of reaction. The selectivities of furfural conversion to the different products are shown in Table 1. The main detected products of furfural hydrogenation in the reaction system were 2-methylfuran (MF), furfuryl alcohol (FA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), levulinic acid, γ-valerolactone (GVL), cyclopentanol (COL), cyclopentanone (CON), 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone, 1,4-pentanedione, 1,4-pentanediol and 1,2-pentanediol. Furfural hydrogenation in water proceeds with the formation of FA in the initial stage of the reaction (Figs. 2 and 3) . Besides the initial FA product, furfural is also initially transformed into 1,4-pentanedione (Fig. 2). This product might be formed by the hydration of furfural with ring opening and removal of primary hydroxyl group. During the reaction, the selectivities to FA and 1,4-pentanedione decrease until they are fully converted (Fig. 2). Secondary products of furfural hydrogenation in water are CON, 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone, THFA and 1,4-pentanediol (Figs. 2 and 3). 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone was produced in a similar amount to CON. The appearance of 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone can be explained by the hydrogenation of 1,4-pentanedione, which is further hydrogenated to 1,4-pentanediol once full conversion of furfural is reached (Fig. 2). This sequence of transformations was confirmed by hydrogenation experiments with pure compounds (not shown). Formation of pentanediols during furfural hydrogenation was shown earlier in literature [24,25]. The main products of furfural hydrogenation with or without organic solvent at high temperatures usually are 1,2- and 1,5-pentanediols [24,25]. Our results show that the hydrogenation of furfural in the aqueous phase leads to a different pathway of pentanediols formation. The selectivity to THFA slowly increases during the reaction to 5%. Formation of CON and COL during hydrogenation of furfural in water was shown earlier over Pt/C, Pd/C and Ru/C by Hronec [11,26]. This reaction was explained by ring opening of furfural in the presence of water. The selectivity of furfural to CON increases to 30% with an increase of the furfural conversion to 90% (Fig. 2). After complete conversion of furfural, CON is hydrogenated further, producing COL (Fig. 2). The equilibrium ratio of COL/CON (9/1) published in literature at similar conditions [11] was not attained. This fact can be explained by adsorption of intermediates or by-products over the metal surface [11]. Indeed, even the presence of furfural in the system leads to a suppression of the hydrogenation activity of Ru/C. Disappearance of furfural leads to a deeper hydrogenation of products (Fig. 2). CON and COL might be formed by a rearrangement with hydrogenation and dehydration of FA or THFA. In order to check the possible ways of CON formation, hydrogenation experiments of FA and THFA were performed in an aqueous phase in the presence of Ru/C. THFA was stable and was not converted at the studied reaction conditions (not shown). Contrarily, FA was fully converted during the first 0.5h (Fig. 4). The main products of FA hydrogenation were THFA, COL, CON, 1,4- and 1,2-pentanediols (Fig. 4). The selectivity to THFA (23%) was much higher for the FA hydrogenation in comparison with the hydrogenation of furfural (6.8%) due to the lower rate of ring opening for FA. 1-Hydroxy-4-pentanone and 1,4-pentanedione were not observed in the reaction products during FA hydrogenation. This indicates a fast direct hydrogenation of FA into pentanediols (Fig. 3). Analysis of the products of FA hydrogenation shows rapid formation of 1,3-cyclopentanediol, 1,2-cyclopentanediol and 1,2,3-cyclopentanetriol, which might be intermediates formed during the FA transformation into CON and COL. Hronec [26] also observed formation of CON from FA and explained it by scission of the CO bond in FA with stabilization of the carbocation on the surface of the metal by interaction with co-adsorbed water and a subsequent rearrangement to CON. 3-hydroxy-4-cyclopentenone was proposed as the intermediate compound [26]. A hydrogenation experiment of 1,3-cyclopentanediol in the aqueous phase showed that it transforms into a CON and COL mixture (not shown). Cyclopentanediols and cyclopentanetriol were also observed during furfural hydrogenation but in the smaller amounts. The possible reaction scheme might involve the hydration of furfural at the initial stage of the reaction, ring opening with subsequent condensation, dehydration and hydrogenation (Fig. 5). This route shows the role of water in the reaction of CON and COL formation. Furfural hydrogenation in organic solvent does not lead to the formation of CON and COL [11]. Rehydration of furfural into levulinic acid with subsequent cyclization into GVL (Fig. 3) almost does not take place during furfural hydrogenation due to the need of strong acidity for the FA transformation into levulinic acid [27]. Thus, the main distribution of products during furfural hydrogenation in water is determined by two main pathways: ring opening with the formation of 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone, pentanediols, CON, COL and hydrogenation of furfural through FA to THFA (Fig. 3). Hydrogenation of furfural in organic solvents like 1-butanol and MTHF over Ru/C takes place with different activities and other product distributions compared to the reaction in water (Table 1). Furfural hydrogenation in organic solvents leads to additional formation of MF. 2-Methytetrahydrofuran was observed during hydrogenation in 1-butanol only in a minor amount. MF is produced in significant amounts during hydrogenation in organic phases by hydrogenation of FA, which is not stable in aqueous phase [28] (Fig. 4). Hydrogenation of furfural in 1-butanol is accompanied by the formation of ethers of the 1-butanol solvent and furfural and the products of its hydrogenation. This results in an almost full conversion of furfural with only 37% selectivity to FA, THFA and MF (Table 1). At the same time, using MTHF as solvent at a 91% conversion most of the furfural is transformed into FA (42.4%), THFA (11.2%) and MF (18.9%). Lower reaction rates, especially at high conversions of furfural, in organic solvents compared to in aqueous phase might be explained by significant adsorption of products like FA and MF on the surface of Ru inhibiting furfural hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of furfural in a biphasic system is attractive due to the fact that the Ru/C hydrogenation catalyst is hydrophobic and will primarily reside in the organic phase. Cyclohexane, 1-butanol and MTHF were chosen as organic solvents due to the high stability of these solvents at hydrogenation conditions. Fig. 6 demonstrates the localization of Ru/C in the organic phase in the biphasic systems butanol–water, MTHF-water and cyclohexane–water before and after the hydrogenation of furfural. A similar picture was observed during the dehydration of xylose combined with the hydrogenation of furfural. The pictures were taken after slow agitation to imitate the reaction conditions. The low interfacial tension between water and 1-butanol leads to easy formation of an emulsion and a broader distribution of Ru/C over this mixture (Fig. 6). The hydrogenation of furfural in a biphasic system can proceed in two different ways: hydrogenation in the organic phase and hydrogenation at the interface between the aqueous and organic phase. These paths of furfural hydrogenation should lead to different activities and selectivities due to a different partition ratio of furfural and solubility of polar xylose in the organic solvents (Table 2). The dielectric constant of the solvents increases in the row: cyclohexane< MTHF<1-butanol, which corresponds to the increase of the polarity of the solvents and the solubility of xylose and water in this order (Table 2). Thus, in the case of furfural hydrogenation in only the organic phase one would observe a high activity for Ru/C in furfural hydrogenation in 1-butanol and MTHF and a low activity in the presence of cyclohexane (Table 2). However, the furfural hydrogenation results in the biphasic systems show (Fig. 1) that the activity is high for all systems although it increases in the order: cyclohexane<MTHF<butanol-1. A high amount of CON or COL formed during hydrogenation in biphasic systems (Table 1) indicates the presence of water during hydrogenation. This might be due to the presence of dissolved water in polar organic solvents like 1-butanol and MTHF. A higher amount of water in 1-butanol phase explains the higher activity of Ru/C in the presence of 1-butanol in comparison with MTHF due to the high rate of furfural hydrogenation in the aqueous phase (Table 1). At the same time, hydrogenation in the cyclohexane–water system should proceed at the interfacial area. The equilibrium distribution of furfural and the intermediate products of its hydrogenation between the aqueous and organic phases from the beginning of the reactions indicates that there is intensive mixing and an absence of the mass transfer limitation during hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of furfural in a butanol–water mixture leads to products similar to that shown in the aqueous phase (Table 1). However, the selectivity to COL is lower with a higher contribution of THFA. This fact might be explained by the extraction of furfural and FA in 1-butanol (Table 2). It protects furfural and FA from further transformations and results in a higher concentration of THFA. The presence of water in butanol–water suppresses the formation of ethers compared to hydrogenation in pure 1-butanol (Table 2). Hydrogenation of furfural in the presence of MTHF leads to a significant formation of COL (47.2%), a low amount of 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone and formation of pentanediols (Table 1). These results might be explained by extraction of the main components of the reaction mixture by MTHF (Table 2) with deep hydrogenation over Ru/C. Deep hydrogenation activity of Ru/C in MTHF might be explained by a competitive adsorption between MTHF and furfural over Ru with a decrease of the effect of furfural on the catalytic activity. This results in hydrogenation of CON into COL and ring opening of furfural into pentanediols (Table 1). At the same time, competitive adsorption explains the lower activity of Ru/C in the MTHF-water in comparison with the hydrogenation in the butanol–water system. The results of the furfural hydrogenation in the cyclohexane–water system are very similar to those of furfural hydrogenation in water. Extraction of the furfural hydrogenation products, with the exception of CON (Table 2), is very low in cyclohexane and this should lead to preferential hydrogenation of furfural at the interfacial area with the lowest activity (Table 1). To conclude, furfural hydrogenation in biphasic water-organic systems over Ru/C proceeds both at the interface, in case of apolar solvent (cyclohexane), and in the organic phase, in the case of polar solvents (1-butanol, MTHF). In both cases, water determines the product distribution with a significant influence of the solvent due to preferential extraction of furfural and products of furfural hydrogenation."
7,Dehydration of xylose in biphasic system with simultaneous hydrogenation,"3.2 Dehydration of xylose in biphasic system with simultaneous hydrogenation Fig. 7 shows the xylose conversion and selectivity to furfural as a function of time during the xylose dehydration in an aqueous solution over Amberlyst-15. It is known that Amberlyst-15 has a maximum operating temperature of 120°C and it should decompose at 165°C. However, this process is slow and decomposition tests showed that during 6h the amount of leached acid sites is only 6% of the total amount of sulfonic acid groups. Therefore, we considered the decomposition during our catalytic tests insignificant, although it will be problematic for a continuously operated industrial process, for which a more temperature stable catalyst would be required. In the aqueous phase, the conversion of xylose linearly increases with time to 70% conversion after 7h of reaction (Fig. 7). The selectivity of furfural decreases from almost 70% at the beginning of the reaction to 20% at the end. This fact might be explained by secondary furfural condensation into humins [3]. A biphasic system with organic solvent is used for xylose dehydration in order to preserve furfural from further condensation reactions by extraction [29]. Addition of the Ru/C hydrogenation catalyst during xylose dehydration in the aqueous phase leads to full conversion of xylose already in 2h (Fig. 8). Analysis of the products shows a fast hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol with initial rate of 5.2mmol/gh with a selectivity for xylitol formation of nearly 90% (Table 3). This indicates that the xylose hydrogenation is fast in comparison with the dehydration. The hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol over Ru catalysts at similar conditions was shown earlier in literature [30]. The rate of xylose transformation in the presence of a solvent is comparable for the MTHF-water (1.3mmol/gh) and cyclohexane–water systems (0.9mmol/gh) (Fig. 8, Table 3). However, the rate is lower in the presence of 1-butanol. A more even distribution of Ru/C over the phases in a butanol–water system compared with other solvents (Fig. 6) might lead to an interaction of acid sites of Amberlyst-15 with Ru particles with a partial loss of activity of Amberlyst-15 [31]. Solvent addition leads to a decrease of the rate of xylose transformation into xylitol in the order: 1-butanol>MTHF>cyclohexane (Table 3). This order corresponds to the increase of the hydrophobicity of the solvent (Table 2). Thus, in the presence of 1-butanol the selectivity of xylose transformation into xylitol is 55% at a conversion of 40% xylose (Table 3). On the other hand, in the presence of MTHF and cyclohexane the selectivity to xylitol near 40% of xylose conversion is only 20.4 and 1.2%, respectively. This fact can be explained by a suppression of xylose hydrogenation to xylitol due to the fact that the hydrophobic Ru/C catalyst resides in the organic solvent and that the xylose solubility decreases from 1-butanol to cyclohexane (Table 2). This implies that hydrogenation of xylose, even at the interfacial area, should be accompanied by a partial solubility of the compound in the solvent like cyclohexane. Simultaneous dehydration and hydrogenation in a single reactor using a butanol–water system leads in addition to the formation of xylitol to only 13.9% of THFA and 4.6% of furfural selectivity (Table 3).The absence of CON and COL in the products of all xylose dehydration–hydrogenation reactions with addition of Amberlyst-15 might be explained by the effect of acid sites of Amberlyst-15 on the formation of intermediate products. Indeed, the addition of Amberlyst-15 during FA hydrogenation in the presence of Ru/C does not lead to the formation of cyclopentanediols and 1,2,3-cyclopentanetriol (not shown). The suppression of the formation of CON and COL with increase of the selectivity to THFA was also observed earlier during furfural hydrogenation over Pt/C and Pd/C in the presence of acids [26]. Acid sites might catalyze the dehydration of hydrated furfural compounds with the suppression of FA transformation into CON and COL. As a result, the main products of furfural hydrogenation in the presence of Amberlyst-15 were levulinic acid (15.4%) and THFA (2.5%) (Table 1). A low amount of detected products (19%) during furfural hydrogenation in the presence of Amberlyst-15 might be explained by an intensive parallel condensation of furfural in the presence of Amberlyst-15 to form humins. The main products in the MTHF-water biphasic system at a conversion of xylose of 38% are furfural (17.9%), THFA (23.1%), pentanediols (33.0%) and GVL (1.0%). At a higher conversion (72%) the contribution of furfural in the products decreases to 4.1% with similar selectivities to other products (Table 3). In comparison with the xylose dehydration and hydrogenation in the butanol–water system the selectivities to THFA, pentanediols and GVL are higher due to the partial suppression of xylose hydrogenation into xylitol. The high selectivity to pentanediols produced originates from the high activity of Ru/C for pentanediols formation during furfural hydrogenation (Table 1). 1-Hydroxy-4-pentanone and 1,4-pentanedione were not observed in the products of xylose transformation in contrast to the case of furfural hydrogenation (Table 1). This fact might be explained by a deeper hydrogenation of furfural over Ru/C at low concentrations of furfural in the solutions. Addition of cyclohexane as organic solvent leads to the highest selectivity to THFA (29%) (Table 3). At the same time, high selectivities to pentanediols (8.2%), levulinic acid (15.3%), GVL (2.8%) and unreacted furfural (10.4%) were observed. The high amount of unreacted furfural in the presence of cyclohexane indicates a lower rate of furfural hydrogenation over Ru/C at the interface in comparison with solvents with higher partition ratios (Table 2). Indeed, the rate of furfural hydrogenation in cyclohexane–water was the lowest among all the biphasic systems (Fig. 1; Table 1). The main difference of xylose dehydration combined with hydrogenation over cyclohexane–water in comparison with other biphasic systems is the formation of a high amount of levulinic acid (15.3%). This is the result of the FA presence in the water phase in compared to other organic solvents (Table 1). Fig. 9 shows the selectivity to the main products during the xylose dehydration and hydrogenation in the cyclohexane–water system versus the conversion of xylose. It is interesting to note that at low xylose conversion the main product is furfural. The fraction of furfural in the products at higher conversion decreases with the increased production of THFA and levulinic acid. The selectivity to 1,2-pentanediol and GVL does not change significantly during the reaction. Application of a biphasic reactor with the phase-separated catalysts provides the opportunity of easy catalyst recycling. In this case, the catalysts do not interact with each other during reaction and might be easily separated by filtration of the different phases. Testing of the Ru/C and Amberlyst-15 after filtration in the second catalytic cycle in the cyclohexane–water system shows a small decrease in the activity of Amberlyst-15 from 0.9 to 0.7mmol/gh (Fig. 8) due to a partial decomposition of the catalyst and a selectivity similar to that of the fresh catalytic system (Table 3). This result shows the advantage of this catalytic system with respect to catalyst separation and reuse."
8,Variation of conditions,"3.3 Variation of conditions The most important conditions which might significantly affect the hydrogenation efficiency in a biphasic reactor are the amounts of the catalysts, solvent, the temperature and the pressure. The influence of these conditions was studied for the xylose dehydration combined with furfural hydrogenation in the cyclohexane–water system. This system was selected because of the combined furfural hydrogenation and suppression of xylose hydrogenation in this system. Table 4 shows the influence of the reaction conditions on the product distribution after reaction. Doubling the amount of solvent to 600ml (entry 2) leads to results similar to those at 300ml of cyclohexane with even smaller selectivities to hydrogenated products like THFA (25%), levulinic acids (7.4%) and pentanediols (5.8%). This supports the hypothesis that the hydrogenation of furfural occurs at the interface in the case of cyclohexane. A higher amount of cyclohexane might lead to a lower amount of Ru/C at the interface and a lower efficiency in furfural hydrogenation. The addition of a very small amount of cyclohexane (entry 3) might be enough to make sure that the Ru/C catalyst resides in the organic phase resulting in a suppression of the xylose hydrogenation. An experiment with only 10ml of cyclohexane shows a significant decrease in the rate of the reaction (Table 4) with a high selectivity to xylitol and a low amount of produced THFA like in the case of xylose dehydration and hydrogenation in the aqueous phase (Table 3). Indeed, analysis of the mixture after the experiment shows a transfer of Ru/C from the organic phase to the aqueous phase. The intensive contact between carbon and aqueous phase in this case might lead to the formation of hydrophilic groups on the surface of Ru/C with its transfer to an aqueous phase. The low activity of Amberlyst-15 in xylose dehydration (Table 4) might be caused by the interaction of the Amberlyst-15 acid sites with Ru particles causing a partial loss of Ru and Amberlyst-15 activity [31]. Therefore, there should be a minimal amount of organic solvent which stabilizes the hydrogenation catalyst Ru/C in the organic layer. Increasing the pressure of hydrogen to 4MPa (entry 4) might result in a higher selectivity to THFA due to the faster hydrogenation of FA into THFA. Experimentally, an increase of the pressure leads to a higher consumption of furfural and a lower selectivity to levulinic acid with similar selectivities to other products (Table 4). Deeper hydrogenation can also be attained by the addition of a higher amount of hydrogenation catalyst (entry 5). Doubling the amount of Ru/C has an effect similar to increasing the pressure of hydrogen. A higher consumption of furfural was observed with a higher selectivity to xylitol, GVL and pentanediols and a decrease of the selectivity to levulinic acid. This indicates that the rate of furfural hydrogenation to THFA is low and proceeds through the formation of reactive FA. Increasing the hydrogenation function by a higher amount of catalyst or increasing pressure leads to a deeper hydrogenation of furfural with formation of other products. A decrease of the temperature from 165 to 135°C (entry 7), which from a practical point of view is attractive since this significantly improves the Amberlyst stability, leads to a significant decrease of the Amberlyst-15 activity in the dehydration of xylose (Table 4). The initial rate of xylose transformation decreases from 0.9 to 0.4mmol/gh. At the same time, this temperature decrease leads to a significant increase of the selectivity towards THFA (49.9%), GVL (9.8%) and pentanediols (17.4%) compared to the reaction at 165°C at a similar conversion (Table 4). The sum of the hydrogenated products in this case is 92% in comparison with 68% at 165°C. This might be explained by a decrease of side reactions for furfural condensation over Amberlyst-15 and hydrogenation over Ru/C as the temperature decreases. Decreasing the amount of Amberlyst-15 at high temperature (entry 6) was another option to decrease the activity of Amberlyst-15 in the formation of by-products. Halving the amount of Amberlyst-15 (5g) results in a similar initial rate of xylose dehydration (Table 4). At low conversion of xylose (33%) the product distribution is similar for the high and low amount of Amberlyst-15. At the same time, at higher conversion (62%) a decrease of the selectivity to levulinic acid and an increase of the selectivity to THFA (37.6%) and pentanediols (15.0%) was observed, similar to the low temperature test (Table 4). This indicates that there is an increase in the rates of side reactions with an increase of the conversion of xylose and the amount of furfural in the system with a high amount of Amberlyst-15 present. Finally, it is worth to note that the localization of hydrophobic hydrogenation catalyst in the organic phase and the hydrophilic dehydration catalyst in the aqueous phase for the dehydration of xylose combined with furfural hydrogenation is possible. The maximum attained THFA yield from xylose in this work is only 20–25%. An alternative way to produce THFA is a two-step method including xylose dehydration to furfural and furfural hydrogenation. This two-step approach was demonstrated earlier by dehydration of xylose to furfural over SO4 2−/ZrO2 −TiO2 in the presence of 1-butanol as organic solvent with a subsequent separation of the organic phase and furfural hydrogenation into MF [32]. The first stage of this process over sulfonic materials in the presence of organic solvents proceeds with a furfural yield of 70–76% and without addition of organic solvents this results in a furfural yield of 20–25% [5]. Taking into account that a separate hydrogenation of purified furfural might be conducted almost selectively [33], a single-reactor process is still worse than a two-stage process with extraction of furfural and comparable with single phase xylose dehydration. A single-reactor process, however, has advantages because of the one-stage synthesis of the final product and the absence of an intermediate purification of the solvent or separation of the product for the hydrogenation step. In this case, the extraction solvent plays an important role in the suppression of side reactions of the hydrogenation catalyst transforming reactive furfural into the stable hydrogenated product. This strategy also gives comprehensive options in combination of other processes in a single reactor."
9,Conclusions,"The investigation of furfural hydrogenation over Ru/C in biphasic systems with 1-butanol, MTHF and cyclohexane as organic solvents shows that the furfural hydrogenation proceeds both at the interface and in the organic phase. The main reaction pathways in water and biphasic systems involve hydrogenation of furfural to FA, THFA, cyclopentanone, and reactions with ring opening resulting in the formation of 1-hydroxy-4-pentanone and pentanediols. The addition of an organic phase during xylose dehydration over Amberlyst-15 in the presence of a hydrophobic hydrogenation catalyst Ru/C leads to the suppression of the rate of xylose hydrogenation into xylitol. The hydrophobic Ru/C catalyst is located in the organic phase and Amberlyst-15 in the aqueous phase. The hydrogenation rate of xylose decreases with an increase in hydrophobicity of the organic phase according to 1-butanol<MTHF<cyclohexane due to a decrease of the xylose solubility in this order. In comparison with the hydrogenation of furfural, the main products of xylose dehydration with hydrogenation of furfural in a biphasic reactor are THFA, GVL, levulinic acid and pentanediols. The highest selectivity of xylose transformation into THFA (50%) at xylose conversion of 32% was attained by decreasing the temperature of the process to 135°C."
