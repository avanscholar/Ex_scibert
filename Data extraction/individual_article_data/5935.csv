0,Introduction,"Fuel cells have recently attracted much attention as a potential device for energy transformation. Hydrogen is a most promising fuel for fuel cell, and steam reforming of natural gas, methanol, and gasoline can produce it. One method of great interest in recent years is hydrogen production from methanol via steam reforming over palladium [1–3] or copper-based catalysts [4–6]. The advantage of using methanol for H2 production is its high hydrogen/carbon ratio. This makes the steam reforming of methanol (SRM) energetically favorable and has the advantage of reducing the soot formation due to the absence of carbon–carbon bonds, which otherwise may lead to catalyst deactivation [7,8]. Copper-based catalysts have received considerable attention for H2 production via SRM [4–7]. Another interesting reaction is the oxidative steam reforming (OSR), this reaction combine the steam reforming and partial oxidation reactions. This process can be adiabatic by using the energy produced from partial oxidation to supply the endothermic steam reforming reaction [9]. Oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM) studies, indicate low carbon monoxide yield and high hydrogen concentration in the products [10–15]. Mainly studies on Ni–Cu-base catalysts in the steam reforming for H2 production used ethanol [16–20], however, a significant amount of by-products were obtained. In WGS reaction, it has been observed that the addition of Cu into Ni catalyst causes an increase in the catalyst activity. A similar result was reported for the OSRM reaction and this positive effect was ascribed to the amount and formation of the bimetallic Ni–Cu species [12,21]. The goal of this work was to study the effect of the metal addition to ZrO2 by impregnation method in the oxidative steam reforming of methanol to produce H2-rich gas. Catalysts were characterized by DSC/TGA, BET (N2 adsorption–desorption), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), XRD (X-ray Diffraction), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), Simulation method and TPR (Temperature-Programmed Reduction)."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of the ZrO2 and catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of the ZrO2 and catalysts ZrO2 was prepared by the sol–gel method, initially a sol was prepared by mixing Zirconium (IV) propoxide (Fluka) (as precursor) with n-propanol (Aldrich) and a basic catalyst (NH4OH) (Fluka) under constant stirring. The resulting sol was processed at reflux temperature (85 °C) and water was added drop wise to it. The reflux temperature was kept constant during 1 h and the resulting gel was cooled down to room temperature (r.t.) and aged for 24 h. The residual liquid was removed by decanting. The molar ratio used for the synthesis was: Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4/C3H8O/H2O/NH4OH = 1:4:4:0.33. Finally the sample was dried at 100 °C 24 h. The xerogel was heated at 100 °C for 1 h and then heated at 450 °C for 6 h under an air stream. The prepared zirconia was then impregnated with an aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2•H2O (Merck) or NiNO3•6H2O at an appropriate concentration to obtain 3 wt.% of copper or nickel respectively onto the monometallic catalysts. The excess of water was then evaporated at 80 °C under constant stirring and the resulting solids were dried at 110 °C overnight. The catalysts were calcined at a rate of 5 °C/min up to 400 °C under static air and holding this temperature for 2 h, then slowly cooling down to r.t. Three bimetallic samples were prepared at 80%Cu and 20%Ni respectively to obtain 3 wt.% of total metallic phase. For the first sample, ZrO2 was successively impregnated with an aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2•H2O (Merck), after that, the excess of water was removed at 80 °C under constant stirring and the catalyst was dried at 110 °C and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h followed by cooling down to r.t. Then, an aqueous solution of NiNO3•6H2O was added and the resulting solid was calcined at the same temperature and time. The as prepared catalysts will be referred as Ni/Cu/ZrO2. For the second catalyst, the synthesis procedure was changed to the above sample mentioned. The labeling of this catalyst will be referred as Cu/Ni/ZrO2. The third sample (Cu–Ni/ZrO2) was prepared by using a simultaneous impregnation (also called co-impregnation): an aqueous solution of Cu(CH3COO)2 and NiNO3•6H2O were added to ZrO2 and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. All the samples were reduced at 450 °C using a mixture of H2 (5%)/Ar (50 mL/min) stream for 1.5 h before characterization, except for TPR technique in which the sample was calcined."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The DSC/TGA analysis of xerogel was carried out in Calorimeter SDT Q600 (TA Instruments-Waters) under N2 atmosphere in the range of 20–1000 °C for TGA analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The details of catalysts characterization have been reported in our earlier reports [3,10–13,22–24]. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption of the samples was measured at −196 °C on a Belsorp-max Bel Japan equipment. Prior to the measurements the samples were degassed at 150 °C for 1 h. The surface area and pore size distribution were determined using the BET and BJH methods respectively. HRTEM and local chemical analysis of the bimetallic nanoparticles were carried out in a JEM 2200FS microscope with a resolution of 0.19 nm and fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (NORAN) and a JEM 2010-HT with a point resolution of 0.19 nm fitted with an EDX microprobe Thermo-scientific. JEOL-2010 microscope with a point resolution of 0.19 nm fitted with an NORAN microprobe Thermo-scientific. The samples were dispersed in isopropanol and a drop of such a solution was placed onto copper and gold 300 mesh grids. Oxidative steam reforming of methanol was carried out at an atmospheric pressure by placing the fixed bed flow reactor (8 mm i.d.) in an electric furnace consisting of two heating zones equipped with omega temperature controllers, using a commercial flow system RIG-100-ISRI. Prior to OSRM reaction, 0.1 g of catalyst was reduced in-situ, using a stream of H2 (5%)/Ar (50 mL/min) increasing temperature from room to 450 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and holding this temperature for 1.5 h. A thermocouple in contact with the catalytic bed was utilized in order to monitor and control the temperature inside the catalyst. For the reaction, O2 (5%)/He mixture was passed through stainless steel saturator containing methanol and water mixture (we use a hot line in the saturator in order to maintain constant the temperature ∼ 20 °C). This gas was added by means of a mass flow controller (RIG-100). The total flow rate was kept at 40 mL/min (GHSV = 24,000 h−1 based on the total flow). Reaction products were analyzed by Gow-Mac 580 Gas chromatograph with thermal conductivity detector equipped with two columns system (molecular sieve 5 Å and Porapack Q columns), double injector controlled by Clarity software V.2.6.04.402 and TCD. The first column was used to separate the gaseous products such as H2, O2, CH4 and CO. The second column was used to separate water, methanol, methyl formate (MF) and CO2. All the reported data were collected after a run time of 7 h. The following equations were used to determine the methanol conversion and selectivity: X ( % ) = C in − C out C in ∗ 100 H 2 production = μmol H 2 produced μmol CH 3 OH feed S CO 2 ( % ) = n CO 2 − out n CO 2 − out + n CO out ∗ 100 The subscripts in and out indicate the inlet and the outlet concentrations of the reactants or products."
4,Simulation method,"2.3 Simulation method The bimetallic models were building up with Cu (80%) and Ni (20%) in order to obtain the Cu0.80Ni0.20 system using the program Cerius2, which required applied molecular dynamics algorithms [25–27]. The geometry optimization calculations were performed at each structure through a process in which coordinates of the atoms are adjusted to achieve a system as close to a real physical system in equilibrium, and determined the minimum energy structures, the procedure was carried out with the algorithm Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS). The models were: Cu–Ni, where the calculation of molecular dynamics is performed by adding simultaneously copper and nickel atoms, then a simulated heating process to 500 °C was applied. Ni/Cu, which is computed first with Cu atoms and a theoretical heating to 500 °C was applied, then Ni atoms were added followed with a simulated heating process to 500 °C was performed again. Cu/Ni structure where the molecular dynamics calculation is performed first with Ni and then added with Cu atoms, notice that the addition of the metallic atoms was changed but the simulated heating process was as the above mentioned. Also a Cu(core)–Ni(shell) and Cu(shell)–Ni(core) structures were built. After bimetallic and monometallic models were obtained, they were deposited on a surface of ZrO2 and molecular properties were performed. The frontier orbitals like HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) were calculated by Dmol3 code [28]. This code is based in the density functional theory which uses the Local Density approximation and generalized gradient approximation to achieve molecular properties."
5,Results and discussion,
6,"Thermal analysis, textural and structural properties of the catalysts","3.1 Thermal analysis, textural and structural properties of the catalysts ZrO2 Xerogel was studied by means of TGA in order to select an appropriate calcination temperature leading to total decomposition of carbonaceous products from the synthesis toward the corresponding oxide. The obtained TGA-DSC curves for the xerogel (Figure not included) showed 22% of the weight loss and it was attributed to the elimination of the physically adsorbed water, physical and chemical adsorbed alcohol and residual organic material coming from the synthesis. The observed exothermic peak at 433 °C on the zirconia xerogel was ascribed to a change of phase from an amorphous material to crystalline tetragonal zirconia [25,29,30]. The specific surface area of bare ZrO2 was 42 m2/g. After metallic phase impregnation and thermal treatments (calcination and reduction), the surface area of the catalysts diminished and was lower than bare support. Among them, the Cu/ZrO2 and Cu–Ni/ZrO2 catalysts had the lowest surface area, as well as, the total pore volume (Table 1 ). Fig. 1 showed a representative zone of the SEM image of the Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. It is important to mention that the bare ZrO2 and the other catalysts had the same morphology, so, particles with spherical tendency. This is understandable because we used the ZrO2 previously stabilized at 450 °C to obtain the catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after catalytic reaction in the range of 20–90° 2θ. An expanded scale was used in order to illustrate the peaks of pure Cu and Ni phases or Cu/Ni alloys present on the ZrO2. XRD patterns of the samples before the catalytic test evidenced diffraction peaks of the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of the ZrO2. In addition, diffraction peaks of the metallic Cu and Ni phases were identified on the Cu/ZrO2 and Ni/ZrO2 catalysts respectively. The bimetallic catalysts did not exhibit diffraction peaks related to metallic Cu, Ni or bimetallic Cu–Ni alloys. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out for the presence of crystallites with small particle size, which is beyond the detection capacity of the XRD technique. After catalytic test, some changes were observed in the XRD patterns of the Ni/ZrO2 and the bimetallic Cu–Ni/ZrO2 catalysts (the later prepared by simultaneous impregnation). On the former catalyst, NiO phase was identified and on the bimetallic sample, a peak of the metallic copper appears. This finding evidences that the active phase is not stable on these catalysts and it was modified by the stream of the reaction."
7,Temperature-programmed reduction,"3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction In order to study the reducibility of the active phase in the fresh and spent catalysts, TPR analysis was performed and the results are showed in Fig. 3 . Peaks corresponding to the reduction of bare ZrO2 did not appear in the whole range of studied temperature. Calcined Cu/ZrO2 samples displayed a broad multipeak reduction profile within two temperature range, one of 150–250 °C and the second from 350 to 400 °C. This suggests the presence of the mixture of CuOx species, and it corresponds to copper species highly disperse in the low temperature range and Cu with strong interaction with the support at high temperature range. In contrast, only a reduction peak can be distinguished in the TPR profile of the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst in the temperature range of 315–375 °C. It has been reported that large NiO particles with lower interaction with the ZrO2 on the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst could be reduced at low temperature [12,31–33]. NiO particles strongly bonded with the ZrO2 were observed close to 350 °C [13]. The reduction peak observed in both, Ni/ZrO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts was shifted at low temperature when Ni and Cu are together. Clearly, the bimetallic system not only promoted the dispersion of the active phase on the catalysts as previously discussed within the XRD results, but also improved the reducibility of CuO and NiO by modifying the interaction of the active phase with the support. TPR profiles of the bimetallic Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalysts synthesized by successive impregnation had the most intense reduction peak at a lower temperature compared to the Cu–Ni/ZrO2 sample. However, the reduction temperature in these bimetallic catalysts was lower than on the monometallic samples. Vizcaíno et al. [34] reported, on the bimetallic Cu–Ni/SiO2 catalyst, that the reduction peaks appeared between 200 and 260 °C. The peak at the lowest temperature was assigned to CuO reduction and the other was attributed to NiO reduction. In a previous study [12] on Cu–Ni/ZrO2 system, it has been reported that Cu causes spillover of hydrogen onto Ni. This induces a simultaneous reduction of both, copper oxide and NiO, and causes a shift in the reduction of the active phase at low temperatures, as was reported for the Pt–Ni/SiO2 system [35]. In addition, it has been suggested that the first reduction peak observed in the TPR profile of the bimetallic catalyst, corresponded to the reduction of adjacent Cu and Ni atoms, which could be forming a bimetallic phase. The second reduction peak was assigned to the remaining Ni atoms forming Ni-rich nanoparticles. That proposal was supported with HRTEM technique results [12]. In our case, a similar behavior could be occurring. This is because a bimetallic particle on Cu–Ni/ZrO2 sample was identified (Fig. 4 a). The measured interplanar distance in the nanoparticle was 1.81 Å, which corresponds to the (200) plane, associated with the cubic phase of the bimetallic Cu3.8Ni system, as was confirmed by EDX analysis (inset EDX spectrum in Fig. 4a). Another possibility to explain the shift of the reduction peaks at lower temperature on the bimetallic system; could be related to the particle size of the active phase. On these samples, diffraction peaks of the active phase were not observed by XRD technique, suggesting a high dispersion of it. Fig. 4b showed the TEM image of the Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. It showed two core–shell nanoparticles of around 40 nm in diameter, the Cu-core had an average diameter of ∼34 nm and the thickness of the shell was around 5.69 nm. This kind of structures could be a consequence of the synthesis method, EDX analysis (inset EDX spectrum in Fig. 4b) demonstrated the presence of the Ni (8.78%), Cu (38.16%), Zr and O elements; the metal Ni/Cu (1:4) ratio was coincident with the molar Ni(1)/Cu(4) ratio used for the synthesis. This kind of particles could be also responsible of the shift of the reduction peaks at lower temperature on the bimetallic system, as observed on Fig. 3. Breen and Ross [36] observed that if the catalysts are reduced at lower temperatures, higher reactivity on the methanol steam reforming reaction is obtained. The peaks position and the percentage of the metal oxide reduction given by the H2/MO ratio are summarized in Table 1. The H2 consumption during the TPR analysis on the fresh Cu/Ni-base catalysts was low; this indicates incomplete reduction of the active phase. Among all the catalysts studied, the bimetallic samples prepared by successive impregnation showed the highest H2/MO ratio, indicating further reduction of the active phase. TPR profiles of the samples after catalytic reaction showed lower H2 consumption, indicating that under OSRM conditions the active phase is present for both oxidized and reduced states, but the metallic state prevails as was confirmed by XRD analysis of the spent samples. After OSRM reaction, by EPR technique was found that in Cu/CeO2 samples, the ion Cu2+ is forming a nano-sized two-dimensional structure [10,37,38]. Oguchi et al. [39] observed a reduction peak on the CuO/ZrO2 sample post-reaction. They concluded that the Cu2O catalyst was stabilized during the SRM reaction. Turco et al. [40] suggested that there was a zone within the catalytic bed where the catalyst is oxidized, and another zone where it was reduced. This phenomena could be occurred on our samples, because, generally in oxidative steam reforming process, evidence suggest that the front of the catalyst bed is partially oxidized and the downstream of the catalyst bed remains in the reduced state."
8,Simulation method,"3.3 Simulation method Fig. 5 shows the theoretical calculations of the monometallic and bimetallic models over ZrO2. After the geometry optimization of the theoretical models, the total energy and the energy gap had the following values: Ni(shell)/Cu(core)/ZrO2 (−3193.49, 0.0027) eV, Cu(shell)/Ni(core)/ZrO2 (−3429.43, 0.0159) eV, Ni/Cu/ZrO2 (−3419.37, 0.0185) eV, Cu/Ni/ZrO2 (−3488.39, 0.021) eV, Cu–Ni/ZrO2 (−3655.28, 0.108) eV, Cu/ZrO2 (−3810.23, 0.385) eV and Ni/ZrO2 (−3832.18, 0.565) eV respectively. The HOMO-LUMO gap of the systems along with the total energy calculated, allows to evaluate the reactivity behavior of the system. According to Fukui's theory [41] a low reactivity will be expected in a system having a large energy gap combined with a low total energy. While, if the gap of the system is low and the total energy is large, high reactivity will be expected. From this theory, it is understood then that the reactivity is reflected in the ability to facilitate the adsorption or desorption of a molecule for a specific reaction in these systems. This suggests that as the band gap of the bimetallic models decreases, an electron transfer mechanism is favored at the interface between the bimetallic structures and the support. This facilitates the redox properties of the catalysts, giving a higher OSRM activity. Theoretical results obtained after the simulation of the successive impregnation process, based on core–shell structures, show higher reactivity than in the co-impregnation (Cu–Ni/ZrO2) and monometallic simulated process. The reactivity of these systems followed the next order: Ni(shell)/Cu(core)/ZrO2 ≅ CushellNicore/ZrO2 > Ni/Cu/ZrO2 > Cu/Ni/ZrO2 > Cu–Ni/ZrO2, > Cu/ZrO2 > Ni/ZrO2. In addition, the energy adsorption between methanol and the surface of these catalytic models were calculated (inset table in Fig. 5). The energy adsorption was calculated according with reference [42]. The results obtained confirm also, that the models prepared by successive impregnation process had the low energy adsorption, so, the ability to facilitate the adsorption or desorption of a methanol for this reaction. Mainly in the literature, the theoretical studies reported are on unsupported core–shell particles and their alloys like Cu–Au particles, on this systems the studies have concentrated on the structural behavior of the clusters [43,44], but no correlation with the catalytic activity was associated."
9,Oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction over Cu/Ni-base catalysts,"3.4 Oxidative steam reforming of methanol reaction over Cu/Ni-base catalysts Oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of methanol reaction was carried out in the Cu/Ni/ZrO2 samples. Fig. 6 shows the catalytic activity of the copper–nickel-base catalysts supported on ZrO2 as a function of the reaction temperature. It was possible to observe that the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst was better than Ni/ZrO2 sample in the temperatures range studied in this work. This indicates that methanol conversion occurs preferentially on monometallic copper than on nickel one. It is important to mention that the H2 chemisorption process did not occur in these samples, for this reason the metal dispersion was not estimated and as a consequence the TOF could not be determined for each catalyst, having a real comparison in the methanol conversion. When Ni was supported on ZrO2-monoclinic [12], the catalytic activity was similar to the obtained in this work up to 300 °C. On the other hand, it is clear that the preparation method of the catalyst has a significant influence on the OSRM reaction. The addition of 0.2 wt.% of Ni to Cu/ZrO2 catalyst leads to a considerable improvement in the methanol conversion, compared with the Ni/ZrO2 sample. The Cu–Ni/ZrO2 sample had a similar behavior to the Cu/ZrO2 catalyst until 300 °C. After this temperature the Cu–Ni/ZrO2 sample exhibited the same catalytic activity than the other bimetallic samples. In addition, was observed that the active phase of the Cu–Ni/ZrO2 catalyst was not stable, because, it was sinterized after catalytic reaction (Fig. 2). This effect could be explained the lower catalytic activity observed on this sample than on the other bimetallic samples prepared by successive impregnation. Among bimetallic samples, those prepared by the successive impregnation method showed high reactivity than the sample synthesized by simultaneous co-impregnation. Although experimentally the catalyst surface is different in the samples prepared by successive impregnation method, the theoretical reactivity predictions determined from the energy gap is similar in both bimetallic models, as seen in the Fig. 5. This may explain the catalytic behavior between the two catalytic species. Shu et al. [45] observed that the impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni on γ-Al2O3 does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene. By EXAFS studies revealed the formation of Pt–Ni bonds in both catalysts. They suggested that the surfaces of both samples are Pt-terminated, from the segregation of Pt to the surface during hydrogen reduction. In recently paper Strasser et al. [46] concluded that the platinum-rich shell on Pt–Cu nanoparticles, exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. These activity–strain relationships were consistent with computational predictions that compressive strain enhances oxygen–reduction reaction. In our case we observed that the catalytic activity is strongly related with the crystallinity and morphology of the active phase, the above mention was corroborated by means of XRD and TEM. The TEM analysis of the bimetallic particle with core–shell morphology; showed that there is no crystalline arrangement point to point or even line to line, which can be observable in the shell of the particle (Fig. 5b). The crystalline anisotropy plays an important role in the methanol conversion in this research, because in the case of the core–shell Ni/Cu structure, the catalytic property increases in both cases, so the activity is not restricted by any preferred crystallographic direction. In the case of the Cu/ZrO2 system having a crystalline arrangement in the (111) crystal direction, as seen in the XRD pattern of Fig. 2, indicates that there are more particles with this type of crystalline plane which favors the catalytic activity but not as in the case of bimetallic core–shell particles; while in the case of Ni-base catalyst was observed that it has a poor crystallinity as observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 2) with the (111) crystalline direction. This showed that there are few planes in the (111) crystalline direction influencing the catalytic anisotropic response. This means that even if there is a poorly crystalline monometallic active phase, the response in the catalytic activity does not resemble bimetallic systems with core–shell morphology, as well as, when the active phase is a metallic alloy (Cu–Ni). This finding suggests that the OSRM reaction may be structure–sensitive. Yu-Hua et al. [47] studied the methanol decomposition on Ni(1 1 1) and Ni(1 0 0) surfaces using DFT-GGA (density functional theory-generalized gradient approximation). The different behavior observed in the methanol interaction with Ni(1 1 1) or Ni(1 0 0), suggests that the methanol decomposition might be a structure–sensitive reaction, as it has been observed in our samples. Mariño et al. [19,20] found that the conversion of ethanol on the SRE reaction was improved when nickel content increased on the bimetallic Cu–Ni system. This behavior was attributed to the addition of Ni, which favors the segregation of Cu2+ ions in the catalytic surface that causes an increase in the catalytic activity. Thus the enhancement on the catalytic activity could be attributed to the bimetallic Cu–Ni species as was previously reported [12,19–21], and core–shell nanoparticles identified with TEM technique on the Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. As well as, the reactivity of these systems calculated by theoretical calculations. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out for the presence of crystallites with small particle size, which is beyond the detection capacity of the XRD technique. It is worth notice, that the BET surface area of the Cu/ZrO2 sample is two times lower than Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 samples. Thus, the catalytic activity observed on the Cu/ZrO2 could be attributed to the presence of highly dispersed Cu species rather than Cu bulk as reported for Cu/CeO2 catalysts [10]. During the OSRM reaction with copper–nickel-base catalysts supported on ZrO2, the main products observed were H2, CO, CO2 and H2O. However, a small quantity of methyl formate was also present at temperatures below 275 °C in almost all samples. Above this temperature, the methyl formate was unstable and was not detected. On copper-ZrO2 systems [48], the production of (CH3)2O and CH2O during the OSRM was observed and it was suggested that they were produced on the support. Fig. 7 a shows the hydrogen yield as a function of reaction temperature during the catalytic tests of the copper–nickel-base catalysts on the OSRM reaction. Hydrogen production was negligible up to 225 °C and increase when the temperature was raised. Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by successive impregnation had the same H2 yield after 250 °C and it was higher than all samples. At the maximum reaction temperature, the H2 yield is about 2.0 μmol for the Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, this is close to the theoretical value (2.5) if a total reagents conversion is assumed. At this temperature the methanol conversion was nearly 100%. On the other three samples the H2 production was close to 1.5 μmol. The CO2 selectivity (Fig. 7b) is important at the beginning of the reaction and diminished as temperature was increased. This drop in the CO2 selectivity was pronounced on the samples where the catalytic activity was nearly 100%. In the case of the CO selectivity, this was produce after 275 °C. The CO production at 350 °C was 10% for the monometallic samples and close to 40% for the bimetallic catalysts. The decrease in the CO2 selectivity and the formation of CO is probably due to the reverse water-gas shift (WGS) reaction that occurred on the bimetallic samples. Taking in account the results from methanol conversion and selectivity, it is considered that CH3OH form CH3OCHO and H2 on the surface of the catalysts as the first step of the OSRM reaction. Then, CH3OH is oxygenated to CH3OCHO, and then decomposed to H2 and CO. CH3OH was hydrated in order to form CO2, H2O and H2 respectively as reported previously [12]. Considering the catalytic activity of the catalysts, we analyzed the stability of the Cu/Ni/ZrO2 catalyst in the OSRM reaction over 2500 min on stream operation at 300 °C and the results are displayed in Fig. 8 . As showed in Fig. 8, the methanol conversion close to 85% was obtained, while H2 selectivity of around 43%, CO2 of about 55% and CO close to 2%. It is clear that the catalyst showed excellent catalytic stability without apparent deactivation during the testing. This suggests that the active bimetallic phase is strongly interacted with ZrO2 and did not suffer agglomeration; thus, the main structure of this catalyst can be maintained as was demonstrated by XRD."
10,Conclusion,"In the present study, Cu/ZrO2, Ni/ZrO2 and three bimetallic copper-nickel catalysts supported on ZrO2 were prepared by the impregnation method. The bimetallic Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalysts showed higher catalytic activity than bimetallic sample prepared by simultaneous impregnation and the monometallic catalysts on the OSRM reaction. Molecular simulation HOMO and LUMO properties of the bimetallic system prepared by successive impregnation with core–shell particles, confirm that these systems had more reactivity than bimetallic system obtained by simultaneous impregnation. This suggests that as the band gap of the bimetallic models decreases, an electron transfer mechanism is favored at the interface between the bimetallic structures and the support, facilitating the redox properties of the catalysts, giving a higher OSRM activity. In addition, the H2 selectivity was higher on these bimetallic Cu/Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. The former catalyst exhibited excellent stability in OSRM reaction and has great potential in fuel cell applications. These results could be associated to the presence of the bimetallic Cu–Ni and core–shell Ni/Cu nanoparticles present on the catalysts, as was evidenced by HREM-TEM–EDX and to the crystalline anisotropy of the active phase that plays an important role in the methanol conversion and selectivity. This finding suggests that the OSRM reaction may be a structure–sensitive reaction."
