0,Introduction,"Biomass-derived phenolic oils, obtained from pyrolysis or hydrolysis of lignin, are becoming a promising feedstock to replace fossil resources for the production of fuels and chemicals via catalytic upgrading [1–6]. Liquid-phase bifunctional hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) offers a feasible scheme for such upgrading into cycloalkanes via a cascade of steps including hydrogenation (on metal) and dehydration (on acid) under relatively mild conditions [7–10]. In addition to oxygen removal, acid-catalyzed CC bond coupling can and must also take place in the bifunctional HDO process, producing alkylated phenols in the desirable carbon-number range of fuels by reactions with small alcohols [11,12] (generated by hydrogenation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and ketones) or with hydrogenated/hydrodeoxygenated intermediates of phenolics (cyclic alcohols or cycloalkenes) [13]. Investigations of the catalytic chemistry of upgrading of lignin-derived bio-oil compounds have been focused on platform molecules that are obtained via fast pyrolysis of lignin. This feedstock consists mostly of monomeric aromatic oxygenates such as phenol, anisole, guaiacol, cresol, catechol, etc. [5,8,10–23] Among these aromatic oxygenates, phenol is the simplest and has been extensively studied as a model compound for lignin-derived bio-oil [5,8,13–19]. The hydroxyl group of phenol strongly activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution at the ortho- and para- positions (C-alkylations). Moreover, nucleophilic attack of the phenolic −OH on the alkylating agent (e.g., carbocation) can lead to the formation of ethers (O-alkylation) [14,16–22]. Previous studies on the alkylation of phenol used straight-chain or branched alcohols, or alkenes, as the alkylating agent over solid catalysts in vapor- or liquid-phase [24–26]. Although the alkylation of phenol with intermediate products derived from itself during bifunctional HDO, i.e., cyclohexanol (hydrogenation of phenol) and cyclohexene (dehydration of cyclohexanol), is also attractive, this possibility has not been sufficiently examined in the liquid phase. We previously reported (hydro)alkylation of phenol and substituted phenols with cyclohexanol using solid acid catalysts in liquid phase [13–15]. In the aqueous phase, only large-pore zeolites (e.g., HBEA) showed promising alkylation activity, while other solid acids, such as Amberlyst®15, Nafion/SiO2, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 and H2SO4-ZrO2, only catalyzed alcohol dehydration [13]. The inactivity in alkylation on these non-zeolitic solid acids was attributed to the limited adsorption of phenol and cyclohexanol in the presence of water, though now it must be recognized that the catalytic activity of hydronium ions is greatly promoted by the steric confinement [27]. More recently, we delineated how alkylating reactants and solvents significantly alter the reaction pathways of zeolite-catalyzed phenol alkylation in water and apolar hydrocarbons [14]. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of zeolite-catalyzed alkylation of phenol and its derivatives including catechol, guaiacol, cresol and anisole, with cyclohexanol and substituted cyclohexanols as co-reactants, in an apolar liquid hydrocarbon, decalin. We demonstrate that the concentration, strength, and nature of the acid sites, as well as the pore topology/size of zeolites, can dramatically alter the catalytic activity and the distribution of products from phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation. On the two best-performing zeolites, HBEA-150 and HY-80, we examine the effects of reactant concentrations on the alkylation reactivity and selectivity and analyze the reaction pathways of alkylation between the mixed aromatic oxygenates and cyclohexanols. The kinetic information is used to suggest a potential mode of practical operation and identify key process parameters for the alkylation of phenols and alcohols from an applied standpoint."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were obtained from commercial suppliers: phenol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5 % (GC)), catechol (Sigma-Aldrich, BioReagent, ≥99 %), guaiacol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99 % (FG)), o-cresol (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, ≥ 99 %), anisole (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.9 % (GC)), cyclohexanol (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, 99 %), cyclohexene (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus®, 99 %), decalin (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99 %, anhydrous mixture of cis + trans), 2-cyclohexen-1-one (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 98.0 % (GC)), ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, > 99.9 % HPLC assay), hydrogen (Westfalen AG, 99.999 vol%)."
3,Catalysts,"2.2 Catalysts HBEA-150 (Clariant, Si/Al = 75), HBEA-38 (Zeolyst, Si/Al = 19), HY-80 (Zeolyst, Si/Al = 40), HY-30 (Zeolyst, Si/Al = 15), HZSM-5-90 (Clariant, Si/Al = 45), Al-MCM-41 (Sigma-Aldrich), SAC-13 (13 wt. % Nafion on SiO2, Sigma-Aldrich), γ-Al2O3 (Evonik). All zeolite catalysts were obtained in H-form and activated at 500 °C in air for 6 h before use. γ-Al2O3 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h prior to use. SAC-13 was dried at 180 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere before being used in the reaction."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The BET specific surface areas and the pore volume were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms measured at −196 °C using a PMI automatic Sorptometer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was recorded on a JEOL 500 SEM-microscopy (accelerating voltage 25 kV). The crystal structures of the zeolites were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X’Pert Pro System (Cu Kα, 0.1540 nm) at 45 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 0.017°/s in the range of 5–70° (2θ). The infrared (IR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm–1. For zeolites and γ-Al2O3, the sample was loaded as a self-supporting wafer and activated in vacuum (p = 10–6 mbar) at 450 °C for 1 h (heating rate =10 K min–1). After cooling to 150 °C, the sample was equilibrated with 0.1 mbar of pyridine for 30 min followed by outgassing for 1 h, after which a spectrum with the chemisorbed pyridine was recorded. Finally, a desorption program (up to 450 °C with 10 °C min–1 and 0.5 h at 450 °C) was employed and the spectra were recorded until adsorption equilibrium was achieved. For SAC-13, the sample was activated at 180 °C for 2 h, without performing a high temperature (≥ 180 °C) desorption step, due to the low thermal stability of the sulfonate groups. The concentrations of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated from the integral intensities of the peaks at 1540 and 1450 cm−1, respectively, in the IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. The amount of pyridine molecules retained after evacuation at 150 and 450 °C were used to determine the concentrations of total and strong acid sites, respectively. For quantification, molar integral extinction coefficients of 0.73 and 0.96 cm μmol–1 were used for Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. The extinction coefficients were determined from a standard sample for which the acid concentrations are known (HZSM–5, Si/Al = 45 from Clariant). Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 was performed under flow conditions. The solid catalysts were activated in helium at 500 °C for 1 h. NH3 was adsorbed at 100 °C with a partial pressure of 1 mbar. Physisorbed NH3 was removed subsequently with 30 ml min−1 He for 2 h. For the TPD measurements, the samples were heated up in flowing He from 100 to 760 °C with a temperature increment of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed NH3 (channel m/z = 16) was monitored by mass spectrometry (Balzers QME 200). The same standard sample used in IR calibration was used to quantify the acid concentrations of measured solid acids."
5,Catalytic reactions on various solid acids,"2.4 Catalytic reactions on various solid acids All experiments were conducted in a stirred batch reactor (Parr reactor, Series 4843, 300 ml). Four main sets of alkylation reactions were performed with the following combinations of reactants: (1) phenol-cyclohexanol or phenol-cyclohexene; (2) mixed aromatic oxygenates (phenol, guaiacol, catechol, o-cresol and anisole in equimolar amounts)-cyclohexanol; (3) phenol-mixed cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, 2-methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanol, 2-ethylcyclohexanol and 4-ethylcyclohexanol in equimolar amounts); (4) mixed aromatic oxygenates-mixed cyclic alcohols. Typically, reactants and the catalysts were mixed with 100 ml of decalin and charged into the autoclave. After loading the mixture, the reactor was first flushed with 3 MPa H2 three times, charged with 5 MPa H2, and then heated up to 160 °C. The use of H2 was out of an initial incentive to perform HDO and hydroalkylation reactions with the same atmosphere. H2 and its pressure had little effect on the alkylation reactions and was found to be totally replaceable with N2 at the same pressure, except for an observation of a faster heating profile under H2. The time at which the temperature reached the set point was taken as time zero. The stirring speed was kept at 700 rpm from the beginning of the heat-up period. In some cases, there were appreciable extents of reaction during heat-up. Detailed descriptions of reaction conditions are given in the figure captions and table footnotes. Samples were taken at fixed time intervals and aliquots were analyzed on a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 2010) with a HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 250 μm) and flame ionization detector (FID). In addition, a gas chromatograph combined with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP 2010S) was used to identify the organic compounds. The calculation of conversion and yield was on a carbon mole basis. Conversion = (weight of converted reactant/weight of the starting reactant) × 100 %. Selectivity to a given liquid product (C %) = (C atoms in the specific product/C atoms in all liquid products) × 100 %. The carbon balance for all experiments was better than 90 % in this work."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Acidic properties,"3.1 Acidic properties The acid site concentrations of the studied solid acids were characterized by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Fig. S1, Supporting Information (SI)) and TPD of NH3. The quantitative results are compiled in Table 1 . Other properties of these solid acids, including pore volume and particle size, are shown in the SI (Table S1, Figs. S1–S3). In general, acidities determined by NH3-TPD are in good agreement with the total acid concentrations measured by IR using pyridine as a probe molecule. Most of the BAS in HBEA and HZSM-5 zeolites qualify as strong sites that are defined as those able to retain pyridine even after evacuation at 450 °C (see Experimental). In comparison, Y-type zeolites, especially HY-30 (entry 4, Table 1), exhibit a notably lower fraction of strong BAS. The majority of LAS in all the five zeolites were found to be strong. Although this work focuses on the examination of large-pore zeolites, two additional solid acids, silica-supported Nafion (SAC-13) and γ-Al2O3, were studied to allow comparison. SAC-13 was chosen here as a material containing only BAS (entry 7, Table 1) with the intrinsic acid strength similar to 100 % H2SO4 [28], which is appreciably stronger than zeolites [29]. The BAS concentration of SAC-13 was determined to be 0.12 mmol g−1, in good agreement with previous reports [30,31]. γ-Al2O3 contained only LAS (0.09 mmol g−1), two thirds of which are classified as relatively weak sites (i.e., unable to retain pyridine at 450 °C)."
8,General aspects of phenol alkylation with cyclohexanol/cyclohexene on different solid acids,"3.2 General aspects of phenol alkylation with cyclohexanol/cyclohexene on different solid acids For selected zeolites, Fig. 1 shows the carbon-based concentration-time profiles of the reactants and main products for phenol alkylation with cyclohexanol and cyclohexene, respectively. CHE, 2-CHP, 4-CHP, 2,4-DCHP, 2,6-DCHP, 1-CC and CHPE are the abbreviations of cyclohexene, 2-cyclohexylphenol, 4-cyclohexylphenol, 2,4-dicyclohexylphenol, 2,6-dicyclohexylphenol, 1-cyclohexylcyclohexene and cyclohexyl phenyl ether, respectively. The results for other catalysts are shown in the SI (Section S2). For phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation on HBEA and HY zeolites (Fig. 1a and b), dehydration of cyclohexanol was the dominant reaction in the initial stage, forming cyclohexene and dicyclohexyl ether (dicyclohexyl ether reached its maximum concentration, ∼1.4 C%, in less than 40 min, but quickly disappeared afterwards [14]). The concentrations of C-alkylation products increased markedly only after most cyclohexanol was dehydrated. In contrast, the O-alkylation product, CHPE, reached maxima and then decreased in concentration with reaction time. This is primarily attributed to the reversibility of O-alkylation, leading to an inevitable decrease of CHPE concentration as the concentrations of both reactants decrease [14,33]. De-alkylation or cracking of C-alkylated products was not observed during the whole reaction course, in line with the quasi-irreversible nature of C-alkylation under the experimental conditions used [14,34]. Alkylation of phenol with cyclohexanol was faster on HBEA-38 than on HBEA-150 in the first 40 min but became slower on HBEA-38 than on HBEA-150 afterwards (cf. Figs. 1a and S4a). The more pronounced activity decline with the progress of alkylation was due to a greater extent of deactivation for HBEA-38. For the two HBEA zeolites with different crystallite sizes (Fig. S2) and acid concentrations, the very close turnover frequencies (TOFs) for cyclohexanol dehydration (∼0.4 s−1; normalized to the total BAS) and phenol consumption (∼0.18 s−1; calculations based on phenol conversion after the onset of acceleration, i.e., 40−90 min Fig. in Fig.1a and 20−40 min in Fig. S4a), evidenced the absence of internal diffusion limitations imposed by the reactants/products. Unlike HBEA, the two HY zeolites (Si/Al = 40 and 15) exhibited comparable product evolution patterns with time (cf. Figs. 1b and S4b). We tentatively attribute the different impacts of the Si/Al ratio on catalyst deactivation to the different distributions of strength of acid sites on HBEA and HY zeolites (Table 1). Specifically, all types of acid sites are present at much higher concentrations in HBEA-38 than in HBEA-150, while the two HY zeolites contain comparable concentrations of strong BAS, 0.10‒0.13 mmol g−1. Thus, we hypothesize that catalyst deactivation occurs mainly at these strong BAS. Compared to zeolite catalysts, SAC-13 showed a much higher initial activity (TOF of ∼1.8 s−1 vs. ∼0.4 s−1 on zeolites HBEA and HY) for cyclohexanol dehydration (Fig. S5), but was deactivated by water and remained much less active for the alkylation of phenol with cyclohexanol. When cyclohexene was used to alkylate phenol, alkylation started instantaneously (Figs. 1c, d and S6). The alkylation rates were much faster than when using cyclohexanol as the co-reactant; the kinetic data are shown later (Table 3 in Section 3.3). Because of the significant quantities of di-alkylation products, cyclohexene was almost completely converted, leaving phenol in stoichiometric excess and causing the reaction to cease after 50 min. The selectivity pattern appeared largely similar to those for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation, except for significantly higher selectivities towards di-alkylation and lower selectivities to O-alkylation (CHPE). The ratio between 2- and 4-CHP remained essentially constant during alkylation, and was independent of the alkylating agent (alcohol or olefin). The alkylation of phenol with cyclohexene was also studied over γ-Al2O3, which contained only LAS (∼ 0.09 mmol g−1). γ-Al2O3 did not detectably catalyze reactions at 160 °C and showed a low activity even at 200 °C for both dehydration and alkylation (Fig. S7). These results allow us to conclude that similar LAS on zeolite catalysts are also inactive for CC bond formation at 160 °C. Interestingly, Al2O3-catalyzed alkylation at 200 °C gave a 2-CHP selectivity of ∼80 % and a very high ratio of ortho/para substitution (∼110, see Table 2 ), characteristically different from BAS-catalyzed alkylation. Based on a detailed infrared study of a series of methylated phenols chemisorbed on γ-Al2O3, Taylor and Ludlum proposed that phenol forms a phenolate species which has its aromatic ring titled upward such that the para position is farther away from the oxide surface than the ortho position [35]. This would be in agreement with the exceptionally high selectivity to ortho-substitution on γ-Al2O3 (see Table 2). In contrast to its poor performance in phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation, SAC-13 showed a high activity and ortho-selectivity for phenol-cyclohexene alkylation (Fig. 1d). Therefore, water produced from dehydration of cyclohexanol is proposed to deactivate acid sites on SAC-13 by competitive adsorption (reducing the coverage of reactive intermediates), hydration (reducing the acid strength) and/or swelling. In line with this hypothesis, initially co-added water (∼1.0 g, corresponding to the amount produced from the dehydration of 5.0 g cyclohexanol) led to much lower activities for cyclohexanol dehydration (Fig. S8) and phenol-cyclohexene alkylation on SAC-13 (Table S2). In comparison, the effect of water on HBEA-150 had a much less pronounced effect on alkylation. Considering that SAC-13 needs anhydrous environment to deliver efficient and stable alkylation catalysis, HBEA-150 and HY-80 are considered to be more suitable catalyst candidates in practical operations where the presence of water is unavoidable for biomass-derived feedstocks. A reaction network for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation, consistent with all the experimental observations described above, is shown as Scheme 1 . Summarizing the key observations, phenol alkylation hardly occurs before a majority of cyclohexanol is converted via dehydration. Cyclohexene, or, effectively, the carbenium ion generated from its adsorption at BAS, is a more potent alkylating agent (electrophile) than cyclohexanol or protonated cyclohexanol. The cyclohexylphenols react with cyclohexene to form three-ring or even larger C- and O-alkylation products. We only consider BAS-catalyzed pathways hereafter, as typical Al3+-LAS are demonstrated to be much less active under the applied conditions."
9,Product distribution in phenol alkylation on zeolites,"3.3 Product distribution in phenol alkylation on zeolites Table 2 compiles the selectivities to six main CC and CO coupling products on different solid catalysts at the reaction time of 4 h, after which only slight changes in the composition of the reaction mixture were observed. For the alkylation of phenol with cyclohexanol, zeolite HBEA with Si/Al = 75 afforded the highest yield of C12 products. HBEA-150 showed much higher selectivities to CC coupling compared to HBEA-38, with total C12-selectivities being ∼75 % and ∼62 %, respectively (cf. entries 1a and 3 in Table 2). A significant fraction of cyclohexene remained unconverted after 4 h of reaction on HBEA-38 (entry 3, Table 2). In comparison, HY zeolites with Si/Al ratios of 40 and 15 yielded similar quantities of alkylation products and CHE at the end of the reaction (see entries 2 and 4 in Table 2). On HBEA (pore opening of ∼0.66 nm), the ratio of 2- and 4-CHP was somewhat larger than 1 but less than 2. On the two HY zeolites, this ratio was ca. 3, larger than the statistical value (2:1). Thus, the more spatially demanding ortho-substitution product was formed with a higher selectivity inside larger pores (i.e., HY with pore opening of ∼0.74 nm). The preference for ortho and para substitutions on Brønsted acidic catalysts is consistent with previous reports [26,34]. Meta-substitution, e.g., 3-CHP, was not detected on any of the studied catalysts. Di-alkylation was observed on HBEA and HY zeolites, preferably producing 2,4-DCHP. On HY, 2,6-DCHP was produced at much higher selectivities than on HBEA, apparently also for steric reasons. In contrast to the high alkylation activities of large-pore zeolites, only 3.8 % of phenol was alkylated in 4 h on the medium-pore zeolite, HZSM-5, with cyclohexanol as the starting alkylating agent (entry 5, Table 2). CHPE formed from O-alkylation was the major alkylation product on HZSM-5, while 2- and 4-CHPs were formed with identical selectivities. Three-ring products were not detectable. The conversion of phenol was also much lower (11.2 %) on SAC-13 (with pure Brønsted acidity and without micropores) than large-pore zeolites, forming only CHPE, 2- and 4-CHP. For all catalysts studied, cyclohexene formed from cyclohexanol dehydration (∼100 % conversion) was not fully consumed in alkylation at the end of the reaction, especially for HZSM-5 (entry 5, Table 2) and SAC-13 (entry 6, Table 2). On HBEA and HY, the remaining CHE and CHPE after 4 h reactions appear to be caused by catalyst deactivation. Adding more catalysts led to a higher conversion of phenol, dramatically decreased selectivities to CHE and CHPE, as well as higher C12 and C18 selectivities after 4 h of reaction (e.g., on 0.4 g HBEA-150, see entry 1b in Table 2). When cyclohexene was the co-reactant, higher conversions of reactants and selectivities to alkylation products were observed on large-pore zeolites (HBEA and HY) and SAC-13 (see entries 7–10 and 12 in Table 2) than observed in phenol-cyclohexanol reactions. Despite the higher acid concentrations, HBEA and HY with higher concentrations of BAS (entries 9 and 10 in Table 2) showed lower selectivities to di-alkylation products (i.e., secondary reactions) than the more siliceous zeolites (entries 7 and 8 in Table 2), probably due to deactivation. The formation of two-ring products was favored on HBEA zeolites (see entries 7 and 9 in Table 2), while HY showed enhanced formation of three-ring products (see entries 8 and 10 in Table 2). Moreover, the formation of more sterically hindered products was enhanced on HY zeolites, as shown from the larger ratios of 2-CHP/4-CHP and 2,6-DCHP/2,4-DCHP. The conversions of phenol and cyclohexene were much lower on the medium-pore zeolite HZSM-5 (entry 11, Table 2). The major product was CHPE from O-alkylation, while C-alkylation remained low (∼2.3 C% of C-alkylation and ∼5 C% O-alkylation after 4 h of reaction) and limited to mono-alkylation, producing 2- and 4-CHP in an equimolar ratio. The low alkylation activity on HZSM-5 was attributed to the small confining space, which limited the formation of rather bulky transition states and/or the diffusion of the products, rather than the inaccessibility of the reactant to acidic OH groups. This is also in line with our previous study performed in aqueous phase, showing that HZSM-5 only favored the dehydration of cyclohexanol but not alkylation [13]. Notably, the selectivities to alkylation products on SAC-13 were drastically higher in phenol-cyclohexene alkylation, as compared to phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation (cf. entries 6 and 12 in Table 2). The selectivities to two- and three-ring products were ∼52 % and ∼39 % over SAC-13 (entry 12, Table 2). In contrast to the absence of di-alkylation for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation on SAC-13, 2,4- and 2,6-DCHP were formed at significant concentrations. CHPE, a major product in phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation on HBEA, HY and SAC-13, was observed initially when cyclohexene was the co-reactant, but was quickly consumed afterwards."
10,Enhancing the catalytic activity of BAS for alkylation by the zeolite confinement,"3.4 Enhancing the catalytic activity of BAS for alkylation by the zeolite confinement Brønsted acid sites are the primary active sites for the alkylation of phenol in decalin under the studied conditions. For phenol alkylation with cyclohexanol, HBEA-150 and HY-80 followed similar concentration-time profiles, wherein the alkylation reaction dramatically accelerated after most cyclohexanol was dehydrated. We previously demonstrated that, using cyclohexanol as a co-reactant, alkylation was very slow at the initial phase because cyclohexanol adsorbed at BAS in zeolite pores was present predominantly as alcohol dimers, which were unable to generate the carbenium ion electrophile to alkylate phenol [14]. Only the adsorption and protonation of cyclohexene (from the dehydration of cyclohexanol) produces carbenium ions for alkylating phenol under such conditions. Thus, the faster alkylation over both HBEA-150 and HY-80 within 40−90 min primarily reflects the alkylation of phenol with cyclohexene (Fig. S9a). The apparent BAS-site-normalized alkylation rates in this time interval follow the order HBEA-150 (0.22 s−1) > HY-80 (0.11 s−1) > SAC-13 (0.041 s−1), as shown in Table 3. Because SAC-13 quickly deactivated in phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation due to the formation of water, the effect of pore confinement was more reliably probed by comparing the initial rates only of phenol-cyclohexene alkylation on HBEA-150, HY-80 and SAC-13 (Table 3 and Fig. S9). Additionally, a lower temperature, 140 °C, was applied in order to minimize the impact of catalyst deactivation caused by the olefin oligomerization. Although the acid strength is higher for SAC-13, initial TOFs of phenol conversion followed the sequence: HBEA-150 (0.72 s−1) > HY-80 (0.48 s−1) > SAC-13 (0.18 s−1). Al-MCM-41, which contains similarly strong BAS in mesoporous voids according to Wang and Iglesia [36], was also tested for the phenol-cyclohexene alkylation (Fig. S9c), and the initial TOF of phenol conversion was found to be 0.03 s−1 at the same conditions (BAS counts = 0.145 mmol g-1 as reported earlier [36]). This clearly shows a drastic effect of spatial constraints (the rate was > 20 times higher on HBEA than on Al-MCM-41) on the alkylation reactions. As analyzed previously [27], this rate enhancement is mainly attributed to the unique adsorption properties, leading to higher concentrations of reactants in zeolite pores and to a higher intrinsic rate constant, i.e., a lower free energy of the transition state for alkylation in tight steric constraints of HBEA-150 pores than that of SAC-13 without steric constraints. The six-fold higher TOF of SAC-13 than that of Al-MCM-41 (0.18 vs. 0.03 s-1) is consistent with the greater acid strength of BAS on SAC-13 than on Al-MCM-41."
11,Effect of reactant concentrations on product selectivities,"3.5 Effect of reactant concentrations on product selectivities In order to optimize the process conditions on the best performing catalyst, HBEA-150, we varied the concentrations of the reactants. For phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation, it was established earlier that decreasing the concentration of cyclohexanol led to increased initial alkylation rates on HBEA-150. This was attributed to a shift in the dimer-monomer equilibrium to favor the surface alcohol monomer intermediate that is able to generate the carbenium ion electrophile via an E1 elimination pathway [14]. For phenol alkylation with cyclohexene on HBEA-150, both the catalytic activity and the product distribution were significantly altered by the concentrations of phenol and cyclohexene. For both C- and O-alkylation products, the measured reaction orders in phenol and cyclohexene were ∼ 1.0 and ∼ 0.4, respectively (Fig. S10). The first order indicates a low abundance of phenol in the pore and also at the BAS, while the fractional order in cyclohexene proves that cyclohexene reacts in an adsorbed state. With increasing mass ratio of phenol/cyclohexene (from 1 to 4), the selectivity to mono-alkylated products (2 and 4-CHP) increased gradually on HBEA-150 and SAC-13, while di-alkylation (2,4- and 2,6-DCHP) decreased drastically (Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, the ratio of S2-CHP/S4-CHP was independent of the phenol/cyclohexene ratio on HBEA-150 (S2-CHP/S4-CHP ≈ 1.5), while this value decreased from 3.6 to 3.0 with increasing phenol/cyclohexene ratio on SAC-13. In the absence of pore constraints, the continuous alkylation of 2-CHP to 2,4- and 2,6-DCHP was more pronounced at lower phenol/cyclohexene ratios on SAC-13, leading to higher than statistical ratios of S2-CHP/S4-CHP that change with the extent of alkylation reactions (note that 2,4-DCHP could be formed from 2- and 4-CHP, while 2,6-DCHP was formed solely from 2-CHP). For the phenol/cyclohexene ratio of 0.5 (5 g of phenol, 10 g of cyclohexene, Fig. 2), the HBEA-150 catalyst suffered from severe deactivation, as indicated by the dark color of the spent catalyst. Based on these observations, a phenol/cyclohexene ratio greater than 1 is recommended to avoid severe catalyst deactivation, and a phenol/cyclohexene ratio greater than 2 would be preferable when mono-alkylation products are targets."
12,Alkylation of lignin-derived phenol and its derivatives with cyclohexanols,"3.6 Alkylation of lignin-derived phenol and its derivatives with cyclohexanols Among the studied solid catalysts, zeolites HBEA-150 and HY-80 showed certain practical potential, especially regarding their alkylation activity, selectivity to desired products, water tolerance, as well as the less pronounced deactivation compared to their congeners with higher BAS concentrations. To realistically mimic the upgrading process of lignin-derived bio-oil, we next study the alkylation of five mixed aromatic oxygenates representing the lignin-derived phenolic monomers (catechol, guaiacol, o-cresol, phenol and anisole) by five mixed cyclic alcohols (cyclohexanol, 2-methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanol, 2-ethylcyclohexanol and 4-ethylcyclohexanol). The temporal evolutions of concentrations of categorized compounds during the alkylation of monomeric aromatic oxygenates and alcohols over zeolites HBEA-150 and HY-80 are given in Figs. 3 and S11, respectively. The reactant and product evolution patterns of the alkylation between selected aromatic oxygenates and alcohols are similar to those for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation over both zeolites. Mixed cyclic alcohols first dehydrated to mixed olefins and then the alkylation of phenol or the mixed aromatic oxygenates accelerated at about 70 % conversion of the alcohol. As for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation, the negligible reactivity in phenol/aromatic oxygenates alkylation with cyclohexanol/alcohols at the initial reaction stage is mainly caused by the limited intra-zeolite concentration of electrophiles, not by the lack of phenol/aromatic oxygenates [14]. HY-80 showed higher conversions of aromatic oxygenates and olefins, and much higher yields of di-alkylates, whereas HBEA-150 showed a distinct preference to mono-alkylates. On both HBEA-150 and HY-80, the consumption rate of phenol was nearly identical when alkylating with mixed alcohols (HBEA: 0.11 mol g−1 h−1, 20−40 min in Fig. 3 b; HY: 0.06 mol g−1 h−1, 30−50 min in Fig. S11b) and with cyclohexanol (HBEA: 0.12 mol g−1 h−1, 40−90 min in Fig. 1a; HY: 0.06 mol g−1 h−1, 40−90 min in Fig. 1b). On both zeolites, the deactivation appears to have occurred to a greater extent when using mixed aromatic oxygenates and alcohols as reactants, indicated by the slight changes in the composition of the reaction mixture after 120 min of reaction (Figs. 3c and S11c). The selectivities to mono- and di-alkylated products over HBEA-150 and HY-80 at the reaction time of 240 min (at which point alkylation reached a plateau) are compiled in Table 4 . For the alkylation of mixed aromatic oxygenates with cyclohexanol, HY-80 showed the highest selectivity in di-alkylates (48.2 %), and interestingly, a comparable selectivity in mono-alkylates (48.6 %) was observed. In this case (entry 4), the reactant conversions were the highest among all six scenarios listed in Table 4. When phenol was alkylated by mixed alcohols, HBEA-150 afforded the highest selectivity to mono-alkylates (71.6 %) and a high mono/di ratio of ∼ 8. When alkylation was carried out using mixed aromatic oxygenates and mixed alcohols, HY-80 showed a significantly higher phenol conversion (70.8 % on HY-80 vs 51.5 % on HBEA-150), while a comparable mono-alkylation selectivity (66.1 % on HY-80 vs. 65.1 % on HBEA-150) was observed on both catalysts. Some notably different kinetic behaviors are captured for the alkylation of mixed aromatic oxygenates with cyclohexanol(s) on HBEA-150, as compared with the alkylation between phenol and cyclohexanol. First, within the first 10 min of reaction where only dehydration occurred and detectable alkylation had not taken place, the dehydration rate was significantly higher, when a mixture of cyclic alcohols was used as the starting alkylating agent (the lumped dehydration rate of 0.51 mol g−1 h−1; Fig. 3b), instead of cyclohexanol only (the dehydration rate of ∼0.2 mol g−1 h−1 in the presence of phenol or mixed aromatic oxygenates; Figs. 1a and 3 a). This is mainly ascribed to the higher reactivity of some cyclic alcohols (i.e., 2-methyl- and 2-ethylcyclohexanols) [37]. Second, a slower rate (0.06 mol g−1 h−1, 30−60 min in Fig. 3a) and a much lower conversion at 240 min (45.9 % vs. 74.9 %, cf. Entry 1 in Table 4 and Entry 1b in Table 2) were obtained when the mixed aromatic oxygenates reacted with cyclohexanol. The lower reaction rate of the phenolics mixture is tentatively attributed to the lower (compared to phenol) intrinsic reactivity of some aromatic oxygenates toward electrophilic attack. Fig. 4 a depicts the temporal evolution of the conversions of individual aromatic oxygenates in the alkylation of their equimolar mixture with cyclohexanol over HBEA-150. The conversions of aromatic oxygenates at all reaction times followed the order: catechol > phenol > guaiacol ≈ o-cresol > anisole, which was also observed with HY-80 (Fig. S12a). The same order was observed for the alkylation of aromatic oxygenates with mixed alcohols on both zeolites (Fig. S13). The electron-donating groups of the substituted phenols favor electrophilic substitution on an aromatic ring in the order of −OH > −OCH3 > −CH3; thus, the alkylation reactivity of the studied aromatic oxygenates are expected to follow an order: catechol > guaiacol > o-cresol > phenol > anisole. The conversion rate of aromatic oxygenates is affected, however, not only by the intrinsic reactivity of the aromatic ring, but also by their local concentrations/activities inside zeolite pores and the fact that fewer ortho (relative to −OH) positions are available for the alkylation of 2-substituted phenols. In the presence of pore constraints, the lower alkylation reactivity of guaiacol and o-cresol than phenol in HBEA (Fig. 4a) may in part be due to the formation of bulkier alkylation transition states that do not favorably fit into the pores of HBEA. This is suggested by the fact that HY-80 with a more spacious pore environment showed similar conversions of phenol, guaiacol and o-cresol with the progress of reaction (Fig. S12a). In the case where a mixture of five alcohols (equimolar cyclohexanol, 2- and 4-methyl- and ethyl-substituted cyclohexanols) was used to alkylate phenol on HBEA-150, the corresponding concentration-time profiles of the olefins are shown in Fig. 4b. With the starting alcohol mixture, the theoretical maximum concentrations of cyclohexene, methylcyclohexenes, and ethylcyclohexenes are 8.7 C%, 20.3 C% and 23.2 C%, respectively. The actual maximum concentrations of these olefins were 7.0 C%, 15.8 C% and 22.0 C% at 20 min of reaction, indicating that 20–22 % of cyclohexene and methylcyclohexenes had been involved in alkylation while only 4% of ethylcyclohexenes had been converted by that time point. The reactivity of ethylcyclohexenes toward alkylation was significantly lower than those of cyclohexene and methylcyclohexenes, attributed to an increased steric hindrance (Fig. 4b). Similar phenomena were observed on HY-80 but methyl- and ethylcyclohexenes were consumed at higher rates because of enhanced di-alkylation (Fig. S12b). A close inspection shows that 4-alkylcyclohexenes are more reactive than 1-alkylcyclohexenes for the alkylation of phenol on both zeolites (Fig. S14). This appears to reflect the more reactive nature of secondary carbenium ions formed from the protonation of 4-alkylcyclohexenes than tertiary carbenium ions formed from 1-alkylcyclohexenes. As mentioned earlier, the lumped dehydration rate of a mixture of cyclic alcohols was faster than that of cyclohexanol alone (at the same total concentration of alcohol molecules), in the presence of phenol only or mixed aromatic oxygenates (Figs. 3b and S11). Dehydration of 2-alkylcyclohexanols occurs through the formation of more stable tertiary carbocations, leading to lower activation free energies to form the kinetically relevant transition states and higher formation rates of 1-alkylcyclohexenes on both zeolites (Fig. S14). Illustrated in Scheme 2 are plausible pathways for the dehydration of cyclohexanol and substituted cyclohexanols to produce alkylating agents, and the production of mono-alkylates via alkylation of phenol and its derivatives with electrophiles over the studied zeolites, proposed on the basis of our experimental observations."
13,Remarks on the practical operation of phenols-alcohols alkylation,"3.7 Remarks on the practical operation of phenols-alcohols alkylation Our previous studies have demonstrated that it is hardly possible for the dimeric, alcohol-derived intermediate in the pores of HBEA to generate carbocations (electrophiles) and that carbenium ions are produced at a sizable concentration primarily via the (re-)adsorption and protonation of cyclohexene at the BAS. At alcohol concentrations of 0.5 M (i.e., ∼5 wt%) and higher, alcohol-alcohol homo- and heterodimers (e.g., A-A, A–B, etc., when mixed alcohols are used) are the dominant surface intermediates, which are not displaced from the BAS even in the presence of co-adsorbed aromatic oxygenates in the pore. Alcohols also compete for protons more efficiently than olefins and phenolics, leading to an inhibition of the electrophile formation from olefin adsorption and protonation. As a result, alkylation of phenolics was negligibly slow at the initial stage of reactions between aromatic oxygenates and cyclic alcohols, yet accelerating after a majority of alcohols was converted (Figs. 1,3,4, S11 and S12). Another source of carbenium ion comes from the elimination of alcohol monomers, a pathway effectively available only at low alcohol concentrations. The generation of carbocations from this pathway, however, is energetically more demanding than that from the adsorption and protonation of olefins on zeolite HBEA [14]. Because of the essentially unreactive nature of alcohol dimers along the pathway of electrophile formation, low local concentrations of alcohols are recommended for the alkylation of phenol in apolar solvent. An implication for practical operations is that two tandem batch reactors would be preferred when alcohols and phenols are fed together, with the first one coping with alcohol dehydration and the second one running alkylation of phenol with the olefins produced (together with unconverted alcohols) from the first reactor. This operational concept is illustrated in Scheme 3 . Because alcohol reactants impede the adsorption of olefins and lead to an unproductive period of operation, it is best to keep the concentration of cyclohexanol at a low level by running the dehydration in the first reactor at high to complete conversions. The distribution of alkylated products is controlled by varying reaction conditions, such as the phenol/cyclohexene ratio (Fig. 2), temperature and/or the residence time in the second reactor. Similar considerations should apply to the case of alkylation of aromatic oxygenates by mixed cyclic alcohols in apolar media."
14,Conclusions,"The present results provide a step towards a comprehensive understanding of the alkylation of lignin-derived aromatic oxygenates with their hydrogenated/hydrodeoxygenated intermediates, i.e., cyclic alcohols and cycloalkenes, which is important in the conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks (such as bio-oil) into fuels and chemicals. In decalin, phenol alkylation with cyclohexanol and cyclohexene is catalyzed primarily by BAS of the solid acid. Among the investigated solid acids, large-pore zeolites, i.e., HBEA and HY explored in this work, are the most effective for phenol-cyclohexanol alkylation. Zeolite nano-pores not only exert a decent degree of selectivity control, but also enhance the catalytic activity of BAS in phenol alkylation compared to solid acids with an open structure, including SAC-13 that has an even greater acid strength. Si-rich HBEA and HY zeolites also hold promise for the alkylation of mixed aromatic oxygenates with cyclic alcohols. Specifically, HBEA-150 shows a high selectivity to mono-alkylation products whereas HY-80 is more active for the conversion of aromatic oxygenates and significantly more selective to di-alkylation products. Deactivation on HBEA-150 and HY-80 is less pronounced than on their counterparts having a higher concentration of Al in the lattice and, hence, Brønsted acid sites. The observed reactivity ranking of these aromatic oxygenates in zeolites is determined collectively by the adsorption propensity, confinement effects on the transition state energetics, as well as the statistical probability and intrinsic reactivity toward electrophilic attack. Some observations in this work serve as hints for the optimization of the alkylation process where phenols and cyclic alcohols are co-fed over an HBEA or HY catalyst. On both zeolites, phenol and its derivatives are very slowly alkylated with cyclic alcohols in the initial phase; the alkylation rate becomes significantly higher only after a majority of alcohols is converted to olefins. The alkylation rate increases with the concentration of phenols but decreases with the concentration of alcohols. To avoid unproductive periods of operation for phenols-alcohols alkylation, we recommend a tandem mode of operation, where the first reactor runs alcohol dehydration to a high conversion and the second one deals with the alkylation of phenols with the olefins produced (together with unconverted alcohols) from the first reactor. Besides temperature and residence time, low concentrations of alcohols and relatively high molar ratios of phenols to olefins (phenols/olefins > 1 to ensure less deactivation and preferably > 2 when targeting mono-alkylates) in the second reactor are considered as key to the alkylation productivity and product yields on large-pore zeolite catalysts."
