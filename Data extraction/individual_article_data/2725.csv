0,Introduction,"With increasing concern for the use of renewable resources and in particular for finding ways to use solar energy, solar light-activated photocatalysis is becoming an attractive tool. About 95% of the present hydrogen needs are covered by steam reforming of methane, a non-renewable source. Sustainable hydrogen production systems are of great importance for the future. Photocatalysis, with its potential to use sunlight for generating hydrogen, represents one of the promising technologies for clean and environmentally friendly hydrogen production and provides a way to use sunlight for generating hydrogen as a renewable green fuel. Photocatalysis, as opposed to other renewable energy production technologies, such as bio-fuel reforming, operates at ambient conditions without complex processing requirements. Since the discovery of photocatalytic water splitting on semi-conductor catalysts by Fujishima and Honda [1], efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production, especially by direct water splitting is considered as a dream process because it enables pure hydrogen production from renewable sources without the application of an external potential. In the last years much effort has been put in the development of photocatalysts that are able to harvest solar energy and to convert it into chemical energy. More recently, several works have reported new photocatalysts with improved efficiency toward water splitting under solar light exclusively [2–6]. However, highly efficient hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting is still far from practical application and is closely linked to the development and improvement of nanomaterials. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be increased or decreased by the presence of a noble metal co-catalyst deposited on its surface, depending on many factors such as the metal content and the nature of the reactant as well as the way of preparing the catalyst. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity has been attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the metal/semi-conductor interface, which leads to electron trapping and efficient charge separation [7]. Several metals have been tested and reported in numerous publications [8–13], emphasizing the best properties of the Pt/TiO2 systems. Some works performed in the last decades have shown that it was possible to increase the hydrogen production reaction rate for water splitting using water–alcohol mixtures, particularly water–methanol systems [13–17]. In these cases, the rate of hydrogen production was found to be much higher, compared to that obtained from photocatalytic cleavage of pure water. This increase has been attributed to the effect of the alcohol acting as a sacrificial agent (electron donor and holes and/or oxygen scavenger), by decreasing both electron–hole recombination and O2/H2 back reaction rates [18,19]. In most of these studies, the relative ratio of methanol to water was relatively high. Although this process is of interest in terms of environmental purposes and reduction in the use of fossil fuels, it still relies on a fossil-derived fuel, methanol or more generally on alcohols. A more sustainable route should involve either pure water splitting or water splitting assisted by lower amounts of methanol. Trying to lower and optimize the relative content of methanol while keeping high efficiency for water splitting is one of the goals of our study. This work presents the results obtained for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production on TiO2 anatase/rutile-supported Pt and Au photocatalysts, including the search for optimized low ratio of methanol. The influence of both metals, on the one hand, and of the TiO2 anatase/rutile-based support properties (anatase/rutile ratio, specific surface area, porosity, etc.), on the other hand, will be studied in detail and is correlated to complementary characterization methods. High rate of hydrogen production could be sustained over days without deactivation of the system on 0.3wt.% Au/TiO2 anatase–rutile photocatalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Material synthesis,"2.1 Material synthesis The TiO2 photocatalysts were based on the TiO2–P25 standard from Degussa (now Evonik) with an anatase/rutile ratio of about 80/20 and a specific surface area of about 50 m2/g, and sol–gel nanosized anatase/rutile template-promoted materials. Nanosized sol–gel TiO2-template-promoted photocatalysts were synthesized following a liquid phase low temperature dissolution–reprecipitation process using a sol–gel procedure in which the titanium isopropoxide was first hydrolyzed by the addition of a 2M HCl aqueous solution, followed by a 48-h aging of the obtained hydrosol [20]. Even at room temperature aging, the thermodynamically stable rutile phase with fine particle size could be obtained [21]. The porogen template, polyoxyethylene(10)cetyl ether (Brij 56), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), or hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was then added after the aging step and the reactant mixture was first dried at room temperature and then further dried at 110°C before the final treatment in air at 400°C for 2h. Table 1 summarizes the different porosity promoters added during the sol synthesis and their main characteristics. The resulting samples are denoted TiO2–Brij56, TiO2–PEG, TiO2–PVA, and TiO2–CTAB, respectively. More generally, TiO2-porogen-promoted samples will be denoted TiO2-P. The platinum deposition was performed by wet impregnation using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6. After drying at 110°C for 1h in air, and oxidation at 350°C for 2h, the material was finally reduced in flowing hydrogen at 350°C for 1h. Amongst many reported deposition methods [22], gold nanoparticle deposition was performed here following the Direct Anionic Exchange (DAE) method developed by Ivanova et al., which consists in hydroxyl surface groups exchange with gold complexes [23]. The TiO2 support was immerged into an aqueous chloroauric acid solution (HAuCl4) and was further heated at 70°C for 1h. The solution was subsequently washed with ammonia (35vol.%) for 20min, filtered, and the resulting material was further dried at 120°C and calcined at 300°C for 4h in air (heating rate of 5°C/min). In this deposition process, the pH range strongly influences the gold complex nature from AuCl 4 - to Au ( OH ) 4 - and the ammonia washing leads to gold complex grafting on the support surface by exchange with hydroxyl groups. The final calcination reduces the gold complexes to metallic gold nanoparticles."
3,Characterization techniques,"2.2 Characterization techniques Structural characterization was done by powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements, carried out on a D8-Advance diffractometer equipped with a Vantec detector, in a θ/2θ mode using the Kα1 radiation of Cu at 1.5406 Å. The rutile and anatase contents were derived from the intensity of the most intense diffraction peaks, the rutile (110) and anatase (101) peaks at 27.6° and 25.4°, respectively, according to the JCPDS files 21–1276 and 21–1275. The surface area measurements were performed on an ASAP2010 Micromeritics porosimeter using N2 as an adsorbent at liquid N2 temperature. Prior to N2 adsorption, the material was outgassed at 200°C for 1h in order to desorb impurities or moisture from its surface. The surface areas were calculated by applying the B.E.T. and t-plot methods. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a Jeol JSM-6700F working at 3kV voltage, equipped with a CCD camera. The sample was previously coated with gold and then deposited on a standard aluminum holder for observation. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Topcon 002B microscope working with a voltage of 200kV and a point-to-point resolution of 0.17nm. The sample was sonically dispersed in an ethanol solution for 5min and a drop of the solution was deposited onto a copper grid covered by a holey carbon membrane for observation. The XPS measurements were performed on a MULTILAB 2000 (TERMO) spectrometer equipped with MgKα anode (hν =1456eV). Charging effects were corrected using the C1s peak at 284.6eV as a reference for the graphitic carbon. All the spectra were decomposed assuming several contributions, each of them having a Doniach–Sunjic shape and a Shirley background subtraction. Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA) was performed using a SETARAM thermo-analyser. Each sample was placed in a platinum crucible and heated from room temperature to 900°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min, using a 20/80 (v/v) O2/N2 mixture at 50 cm3/min flow stream. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the materials were recorded on a Cary 100 Scan UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Varian)."
4,Experimental device and procedure,"2.3 Experimental device and procedure The liquid-phase hydrogen production was carried out in a Pyrex reactor, equipped with a plunging quartz tube containing a 150W metal halide lamp (solar light simulation) located vertically, under 500mL/min nitrogen flow (Fig. 1 ). This lamp was simulating the solar illumination, with a very low UV-A content and a large part in the visible light range. The measured irradiance was 30mW/cm2. All the experiments were performed in the same irradiance conditions. This tube was surrounded by a water circulation in a cylindrical Quartz jacket, in order to avoid heating of the aqueous media. The reaction was performed under a 500rpm mechanical stirring. Prior to any experiment, oxygen was removed by nitrogen flushing. The reaction products were analyzed on-line every 2min by thermal conductivity detectors on a micro-gas chromatography (Model Agilent P200 Series) allowing detection and quantification of hydrogen, oxygen, CO, CO2, and organics on 5A molecular sieve, OV1, PlotQ, and Stabilwax columns. The photocatalytic tests were performed using pure water as a hydrogen source, and methanol as a sacrificial additive agent for enhancing hydrogen production. Different methanol/water ratios have been tested, varying in the 0–25vol.% range. For a better comparison, all the photocatalytic tests were carried out with 1g of catalyst and 1L of total liquid."
5,"Results on Pt/sol–gel TiO2 (anatase/rutile)-porogen modified, Pt/TiO2-P",
6,Characterization results of the sol–gel TiO2-P supports,"3.1 Characterization results of the sol–gel TiO2-P supports The compared Thermal Gravimetry Analysis (TGA) performed on TiO2–Brij56, TiO2–PEG, TiO2–PVA, and TiO2–CTAB samples after drying at 110°C and calcination at 400°C revealed that whatever the templates or porosity promoters used, they were completely eliminated after calcination (graphs not shown, see in [24] in the case of the TiO2–PEG material). The exothermic heat evolution obtained on the dried samples indicated the combustion of the porogen below 400°C, whereas this exothermic peak did not appear anymore on the samples calcined at 400°C, confirming the removal of the porogen during the calcination step. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves provided information related to the porous texture of the different porogen-modified samples, taking PEG, PVA, and Brij56 as examples (Fig. 2 ). All the TiO2-P materials revealed type-IV isotherms, characteristic of mesoporous solids with a uniform pores distribution (even in the case of CTAB, not represented here). Fig. 2 represents the nitrogen adsorption/desorption curves of non-modified sol–gel TiO2, exhibiting also type-IV behavior. It has already been shown, using this low temperature dissolution–reprecipitation sol–gel process, that the thermodynamically stable rutile phase with a fine particle size appeared after 300min of aging, even at room temperature [25]. Table 2 summarizes BET and XRD characterizations of the different TiO2-P and unmodified samples, compared to the commercially available TiO2–P25 reference. One could note that for a same aging duration, the nature of the template had a huge influence on the anatase/rutile ratio. More precisely, the addition of PEG porogen yielded the formation of a large ratio of the rutile phase (95%), whereas this proportion decreased in the order PVA (70%), CTAB (60%), and Brij56 (50%). Without the addition of a template, pure rutile phase was obtained, but with higher surface area than for usual rutile phase obtained by heating anatase phase at high temperature (30 m2/g against 8 m2/g), pointing out the interest of these low temperature sol–gel syntheses. The addition of template also delayed the anatase–rutile phase transition. It is also worth mentioning that crystallites obtained by this low temperature sol–gel synthesis exhibited a much lower size than in the case of the reference TiO2–P25. Adding a template during the low temperature dissolution–reprecipitation synthesis enhanced the specific surface areas, confirming that the templates acted as porogens or porosity promoters; this positive effect is induced by the template decomposition during the post-synthesis thermal treatment. The fingerprint, after decomposition of the porogen or template will, of course be specific, depending on both size and chemical nature. The corresponding measured specific surface areas ranged from 70 m2/g (TiO2–CTAB) to 190 m2/g (TiO2–PEG). The mean pore diameter values, in the 4–10nm range confirmed the presence of mesopores and the influence of the nature of the porogen/template on the resulting pore sizes. UV–Vis absorption spectra recorded for these sol–gel TiO2-P-based samples were clearly shifted toward the visible light part of the spectrum (also called red-shift), compared to the reference TiO2–P25 (Fig. 3 ). Whatever the template or porogen used, the absorption was extended up to 550nm but is stronger in the 400–450nm range. The graphical determination of the cut-off wavelengths was performed for estimating the band gap energy values, both summarized in Table 3 . The calculated band gap energies were all close to 2.98±0.04eV. The higher the rutile content, the lower the apparent band gap energy (and the higher the cut-off wavelength), as expected. Although the effect of carbon doping on the visible light absorption is currently discussed in the literature, it appeared in our case very unlikely, whatever the porogen promoter used. Indeed, according to the TGA/TDA analyses, there was no carbon elimination (as CO2) up to 900°C. Consequently, one could assume that the shift in the visible light domain observed on the TiO2-P samples was certainly due to the formation of the rutile phase, whose content was higher than that for TiO2–P25. Furthermore, the addition of Pt (0.3wt.% or 2wt.%) to the sol–gel TiO2-P samples did not change the UV–Vis absorption characteristics (not shown in Fig. 3). SEM images showed particle aggregations to form uniformly sized 100–200nm nanoclusters (Fig. 4 , TiO2–Brij56 given as an example), similar to that observed for the TiO2–P25. According to XRD measurements, particle size ranged from 7 to 11nm, depending on the templating agent. It should also be reminded that the porosity, measured previously in BET analyses, corresponds to open voids between particles within these aggregates. High crystallinity of the particles, for both anatase and rutile phases, was confirmed by TEM analyses, showing nice and sharp fringes (Fig. 5 ); the measured 0.35 and 0.45nm interplane distances corresponded to the anatase (101) and rutile (110) crystallographic planes, respectively [26]. To summarize, the above-described synthesis and characterizations of TiO2 using a low temperature sol–gel method modified with different kinds of templates led to anatase–rutile composite semi-conductors and mesoporous materials showing high crystallinity and varying ratios of anatase/rutile phases. Depending on the nature of the template added after the aging step during the sol–gel synthesis, both surface area (from 70 to 190 m2/g) and anatase/rutile ratio (from 5/95 to 70/30) could be tuned. The last parameter also had an influence on the band gap narrowing of TiO2. The role of the different organic polymers acting as pore regulating agents has already been reported in the literature [27], pointing out the influence of their functional groups during the hydrolysis step of the synthesis. A more pronounced polarity could lead to stronger interactions with the surface of titania-based complexes and with the gel in solution. Hydrogen bond formation between templating agents and the growing titania particles in formation into the sol–gel have also been detected using IR spectroscopy. The different templating (amphiphilic, ionic, etc.) molecules with varying sizes and functional groups yielded self-assembly-like mesophases. Each template yields a specific mesophase, depending mostly on its size. During the drying step, these mesophases, trapped inside the TiO2 network, were used as imprints. Finally, their elimination or decomposition during the calcination step led to the formation of potentially well-ordered mesoporous TiO2, as reported in the literature [28]."
7,Photocatalytic water splitting results,"3.2 Photocatalytic water splitting results Preliminary tests did not show any evidence of H2 production from water without photocatalysts, neither in the dark, nor under illumination. Very negligible direct water splitting over bare TiO2–P25 or TiO2-P samples (<0.2μmol/min) was recorded over a few minutes under illumination in pure water. Finally, it has been verified that methanol did not undergo photochemical decomposition, even for wavelengths lower than 300nm, as already mentioned in the literature [29]. The different TiO2-P supports were first compared at a given 25/75 methanol/water ratio to the reference TiO2–P25 material. Fig. 6 summarizes the results obtained on the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2-P and 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–P25 samples, tested under the same conditions, keeping in mind that the only difference between the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2-P samples is the template used for enhancing the porosity. The results are nevertheless very different from one another. Amongst these samples, the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–Brij56 exhibits the best efficiency (32μmol/min or 1920μmol/h), followed by the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–PEG catalyst (20μmol/min or 1200μmol/h), both exhibiting higher activity than the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–P25 reference sample (18μmol/min or 1080μmol/h). The 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–PVA (16μmol/min or 960μmol/h) and 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–CTAB (8μmol/min or 480μmol/h) samples showed the worst activities for hydrogen production. It must also be mentioned that the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2 rutile (100%) (obtained from calcined P25 at 800°C) yielded very poor activity, certainly due to its low specific surface area (Table 2). Increasing the Pt content to 2wt.% on the most efficient Pt/TiO2–Brij56 sample, led to a decrease in photocatalytic H2 production to very poor values. The same tendency could also be underlined on the TiO2–P25 reference, confirming previous observations that the optimum Pt loading lies in the 0.1–1wt.% range [8,12,30–32]. This optimum in Pt content is often explained as the result of a competition between, (i) a decrease of electron/hole recombination at the TiO2 surface in intimate contact with Pt (due to the electron trapping effect on Pt clusters) and (ii) electron/hole recombination on Pt. In addition, above a certain metal loading, the particles begin to touch and overlap, thus decreasing the metal–TiO2 interface and the efficiency of charge transfers. The steady-state regime of H2 evolution is reported in Table 4 as a function of the methanol/water ratio, ranging from 0.01 to 25vol.%, over the most active 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–Brij56 catalyst. It has already been illustrated in Fig. 6 that steady-state regime was reached for 25vol.% of methanol after about 40min under flow and illumination. No deactivation was observed over more than 43h of continuous reaction. The stabilized H2 evolution rate was clearly enhanced by increasing the ratio of methanol sacrificial reagent. The increase in photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution over the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–Brij56 photocatalyst could be explained putting forward different possibilities: (i) a higher Pt dispersion due to the higher porosity of TiO2 after the removal of the template, resulting in better electronic interactions between the Pt co-catalyst and the support [33]; and (ii) the higher surface area, the higher the accessibility of the reactants to the actives sites; (iii) coupling both anatase and rutile particles enhances charge separation and takes advantage of the activation of the rutile in the visible region of the spectrum. In addition, as the evolution of H2 and O2 is expected to occur on different sites, on Pt/ anatase and rutile particles, respectively, it should limit the thermodynamically favored reverse reaction between O2 and H2, as already mentioned by other authors [34]. This could contribute to a certain extend to the higher activity of the TiO2–Brij56 sample. Nevertheless, surface area and pore volume or distribution are obviously not the only factors affecting the photocatalytic activity but the anatase/rutile ratio also has to be considered. For example, TiO2–PEG and TiO2–PVA have the two largest surface areas (and TiO2–PEG the highest pore volume) and also the highest rutile content with 95% and 70%, respectively. Consequently, a large rutile content, even though it absorbs a larger part of visible light, is detrimental to a high photocatalytic activity. As a result, anatase/rutile coupling and intimate contact in an optimal ratio allows (i) the absorption of a part of the visible light spectra via the rutile phase, by the so-called “antenna effect” in photocatalysis [35,36], (ii) the spatially separate evolution of H2 and O2, and (iii) the coupling, via hetero-junction formation, of two semi-conductors, anatase and rutile TiO2, leading to a better separation of photogenerated charges through interparticle charge transfer [37–40]. The anatase–rutile semi-conductor coupling under solar light irradiation (UV-A+visible radiations) underlines the importance of the relative position of the valence and conduction bands of both semi-conductors. Anatase particles can only be activated by the small UV-A fraction of the solar irradiation, whereas rutile particles on the other hand can absorb the UV-A illumination but, in addition, are also able to absorb visible light up to 420nm. When these two TiO2 phases are in contact and simultaneously illuminated with solar light, both anatase and rutile semi-conductors can be activated at the same time, resulting in a vectorial photogenerated charge transfer and thus in a better charge separation. The more intimate the contact between anatase and rutile nanoparticles, the more efficient the electon/hole interparticle transfer phenomenon. But considering that anatase sites, or more precisely Pt/anatase sites, are the active sites for hydrogen evolution, a too high rutile content is therefore detrimental to hydrogen evolution. This assumption may explain the existence of an optimum anatase/rutile ratio."
8,Results on Au/TiO2-P samples,"Two kinds of supports have been evaluated for gold deposition and photocatalytic water splitting experiments, the above-mentioned TiO2–Brij56, that showed the best results with platinum promotion, and the reference TiO2–P25."
9,Characterization results,"4.1 Characterization results In addition to the previous characterizations of the TiO2 supports (Section 3.1) in terms of TGA, BET, UV–Vis absorption, XRD, and SEM and TEM analyses, additional analyses have been further performed after gold deposition (UV–Vis absorption, BET measurements, and XRD and XPS analyses), for metal loadings varying between 0.3 and 2wt.%. Fig. 7 represents TEM images of 0.3wt.% Au/TiO2–P25, 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25, and 2wt.% Au/TiO2–Brij56 photocatalysts at different magnifications. First, increasing the gold amount from 0.3 to 2wt.% on TiO2–P25 led to an increase in the mean particle size from 3 to 8nm (Fig. 7a–d), however maintaining a high dispersion of the metallic nanoclusters. The same tendency is observed on TiO2–Brij56, showing mean gold particle size of about 8nm at 2wt.% Au loading (Fig. 7e and f). It could be pointed out that although the surface area of the TiO2–Brij56 support was two times larger, the metallic mean particle size was very similar at 2wt.% content on both TiO2–Brij56 and TiO2–P25 supports, in spite of the higher dispersion expected on the former support. UV–Vis light absorption spectra, after gold deposition, showed a modification of the absorption properties of TiO2–P25 and TiO2–Brij56 supports (Fig. 8 ). Unlike platinum, gold deposition mainly yielded an additional absorption band around 550nm. Qualitatively, directly after gold deposition the sample had a much darker color (dark violet to almost black). Obviously, this colored material necessarily absorbs visible light, confirmed by the presence of a broad absorption peak centered around 550nm. This absorption has already been reported in the literature and is attributed to a plasmon resonance phenomenon [41,42] due to collective oscillations of the conduction electrons located on the 6s orbital of gold and induced by the incident electromagnetic wave. This phenomenon is frequently observed for particle sizes between 5 and 50nm, the absorption band width theoretically depending on the particle size. In addition to this plasmon absorption, deposition of gold also shifted the absorption spectrum deeper into the visible light range, in the 380–450nm region. Consequently, the estimated band gap value was decreased (Table 5 ). The band gap narrowing could be as large as 0.33eV or even 0.67eV on TiO2–Brij56 and TiO2–P25 supports, respectively. Thus, regarding only that visible light absorption shift, without consideration of the plasmon resonance phenomenon, the addition of 1.4wt.% of gold seemed to be the optimum ratio and led to the best absorption properties, whatever the TiO2 support be. For both TiO2 supports and any gold content (between 0.3 and 2wt.%), XRD characterizations did not show any diffraction peak characteristic of gold, certainly due to the low gold content, below detection limit. Furthermore, the results of BET and pore distribution analyses before and after gold deposition are not significantly different, meaning that such low gold concentrations do not affect the specific surface area, nor the pore size or distribution by filling or blocking them. XPS characterizations have been performed on both TiO2–P25 and TiO2–Brij56 supports before and after gold deposition. For all these samples, Ti 2p (Fig. 9 a), O 1s (Fig. 9b and c), and Au 4f (Fig. 9d) spectra have been recorded, deconvoluted, and analyzed. The Ti 2p XPS spectra reported in Fig. 9a showed a signal that could be fitted with only two components, related to the Ti 2p spin–orbit components of Ti(IV) surface species. A first comparison between the two kinds of supports revealed a consistent binding energy shift of 0.7eV. The Ti 2p3/2–Ti 2p1/2 spin–orbit components appeared at 458.0–463.7 and 458.7–464.2eV for TiO2–P25 and TiO2–Brij56, respectively. This shift to higher binding energies observed on the sol–gel–Brij56-promoted support results from a different chemical environment of Ti(IV), compared to TiO2–P25 and more precisely from an increase in effective positive charges around Ti(IV). No contributions corresponding to Ti lower oxidation states have been detected. It can also be supposed from Fig. 9a that for both supports, the addition or grafting of gold by anionic exchange did not modify the Ti(IV) binding energies, evidencing that there is no direct interaction between gold and titanium atoms on the surface; indeed, no shift is detected for Ti 2p on 1.4wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 and 2wt.% Au/TiO2–Brij56. The very slight binding energy shift (about 0.2–0.3eV) on 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 is not significant, compared to the experimental error to conclude an interaction or bonding between Ti and Au atoms. The O 1s region of the XPS spectra (Fig. 9b and c) exhibited a broad signal that has been deconvoluted into two contributions, a dominant peak at lower binding energy, corresponding to oxygen bonded to titanium atoms [43], and a weaker contribution, assigned to –OH surface hydroxyl groups at higher energy. The binding energy of the oxygen bonded to titanium contribution is located at 529.1 and 529.6eV on TiO2 P25 and TiO2–Brij56, respectively (Fig. 9b). This difference in binding energy between the two supports is increased to 1eV in the case of the –OH surface group contribution, identified at 530 and 531eV, respectively. Gold deposition increased strongly this –OH surface contribution binding energy on TiO2–P25 sample, showing a shift from 530 to 531.7eV (Fig. 9c). In contrast, the addition of gold did not modify the position of the –OH contribution for the TiO2–Brij56 sample. Furthermore, gold deposition also decreased the relative contribution of surface –OH groups, this effect being stronger on TiO2–P25 than on TiO2–Brij56. The –OH contribution on TiO2–P25 decreased from 38% on the bare support to 19% and 12% after deposition of 1.4 and 2wt.% of gold, respectively, whereas it was only reduced from 30% to 27% on the TiO2–Brij56 support after the deposition of 2wt.% of gold. It must be underlined that gold deposition did not induce any shift in the position of the first contribution (i.e. oxygen bonded to titanium atoms). The strong intensity decrease and the large shift in binding energy of the second peak, on TiO2–P25, suggest a direct coordination of gold atoms with the –OH surface groups. Indeed, during the ammonia washing step of DAE, gold complexes in solution are transformed into [ Au ( OH ) 4 ] - and the complexed hydroxyls are then exchanged with surface –OH groups. The same interaction on TiO2–Brij56 may not occur, or not be so strong, explaining the much lower decrease of the –OH signal. The presence of metallic gold was confirmed on both kinds of support by the XPS spectra of Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 for 2wt.% loading (Fig. 9d). Nevertheless, a 0.4eV shift was observed between the two kinds of support, exhibiting binding energies of 82.9 and 83.3eV, for TiO2–P25 and TiO2–Brij56, respectively. This shift clearly evidences different chemical environments and interactions with surface gold atoms. Based on the previous observation that, after gold deposition, mostly the –OH surface contribution of the TiO2–P25 support was affected, it could be assumed that a specific Au–OH interaction or bonding occurs with this support. This is apparently not the case with the TiO–Brij56-promoted support. Fig. 9d also shows that the photocatalytic test does not affect the oxidation state of gold on the 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 catalyst."
10,Photocatalytic water splitting results,"4.2 Photocatalytic water splitting results Firstly, without the addition of methanol as a sacrificial reagent the pure water splitting efficiency of different Au/TiO2 photocatalysts, previously characterized, was compared (Fig. 10 ). In contrast to Pt co-catalyst, only the TiO2–P25 support led to H2 production. However, on this TiO2–P25 support, the hydrogen production rate was very low, whatever the samples tested (less than 0.25μmol/min), and dropped to zero after relatively short periods. Besides, this decrease in H2 production is faster on Pt-containing catalyst, compared to the equivalent gold catalyst. This faster deactivation is probably due to a more rapid poisoning of the active sites which may result from oxygen species strongly adsorbed on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles. Consequently, competitive side reactions are becoming predominant with time on stream: oxygen reduction by photogenerated electrons to form O 2 - and O 2 - oxidation by photogenerated holes [44]. Nevertheless, comparing the results obtained in Fig. 10 on Au/TiO2–P25 with different gold contents (0.3, 1.4, and 2wt.%), the optimal gold loading seems to be at 2wt.%. It led both to the highest H2 evolution rate and to the lowest deactivation, even if the H2 production efficiency still remained very low, around 0.23μmol/min. We could also notice that hydrogen production was close to zero on the 1.4wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 sample. On the 0.3wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 photocatalyst, despite the less important deactivation, the initial H2 production efficiency was lower (Fig. 10). According to these preliminary tests, the 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 photocatalyst has been chosen for further photocatalytic tests, investigating the influence of methanol as a sacrificial reagent. Fig. 11 summarizes the effect of the relative ratio of methanol sacrificial reagent on the 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 photocatalyst, compared to the 0.3wt.% Pt/TiO2–Brij56 sample, previously identified as the most efficient Pt-containing photocatalyst for H2 production. Comparing these two series of Au- and Pt-containing photocatalysts, the results clearly indicate that the addition of methanol has a more beneficial effect for H2 production on 2wt.% Au/TiO2–P25 catalyst. The addition of 1vol.% (10mL in 1L) of methanol enhanced H2 evolution by several orders of magnitude (from 0.23μmol/min to 7200μmol/h). Taking the last photocatalyst, for example, a long lasting experiment yielded, after 10days of continuous reaction on stream, 38.7L (1.728mol) of H2 production without deactivation. Of course, it is well known that under anaerobic conditions, methanol can also undergo photocatalytic reforming to produce hydrogen, according to Eq. (1) [12,45,46]. This means that the origin of the produced H2 is therefore uncertain and may not be issued exclusively from photocatalytic water splitting. After 10days of photocatalytic reaction with 10mL of methanol (corresponding to 0.248mol), the total detected amount of H2 was 1.728 mol. Nevertheless, methanol reforming could have produced at best 0.744mol of H2. Thus, the total amount of the produced H2 over 10days exceeded the total amount that methanol reforming alone could provide (by a factor 2.3), evidencing that a large part of H2 was undeniably produced by photocatalytic water splitting. (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 Consequently, the major part of methanol acts as an effective sacrificial reagent by scavenging either O2 or holes, limiting the reverse H2 +1/2 O2 →H2O reaction, and increasing charge separation [47], respectively. In the former case, one may thus consider the photo-oxidation reaction of methanol, as expressed in Eq. (2). (2) CH 3 OH + 3 / 2 O 2 → CO 2 + 2 H 2 O Assuming that methanol scavenges all the O2 molecules produced through Eq. (3), i.e. 0.864mol, the required quantity of methanol, according to Eq. (2) is 0.576mol, which is about 2 times as much as the volume of the added methanol (0.248mol). (3) H 2 O → H 2 + 1 / 2 O 2 As the initial amount of methanol was only 0.248mol, two explanations can be put forward: (i) H2 production observed is not exclusively the result of water splitting but a part of it comes from methanol reforming and/or (ii) only a part of methanol is used to react with the O2 produced through water splitting, the other part acting as hole scavengers. Table 6 summarizes the products continuously detected under steady-state conditions. The rates of O2 and CO2 evolution are constant and non-negligible. From the presence of O2 in the outlet gas, the second hypothesis assuming that methanol photocatalytic oxidation does not consume all the O2 produced can be confirmed. It also proves that H2 and O2 are efficiently separated on Pt/anatase and rutile, respectively. It must be reminded that O2 is produced by water oxidation by holes (Eq. (4)). Its presence in the exhaust gas also confirms that methanol does not scavenge all the photogenerated holes. (4) H 2 O + 2 h + → 2 H + + O 2 Methanol is consumed by two reactions: (i) methanol reforming, which consumes holes and produces H2 and CO2 and (ii) O2 scavenging leading to H2O and CO2. Nevertheless, the detection of O2 proves that under illumination, more holes and O2 molecules are produced than methanol (at this concentration) can scavenge. It must also be mentioned that in the case of methanol reforming, metal sites poisoning by CO is also to be expected, since it is known that CO strongly adsorbs on noble metals. Nevertheless, CO should also easily be oxidized and released as CO2 under illumination in the presence of O2."
11,Discussion,"From these experiments it is possible to draw a few conclusions regarding the role of the metallic co-catalyst and the peculiar behavior of gold nanoparticles supported on TiO2 anatase–rutile support, either commercially available or synthesized by porogen-assisted sol–gel method. It has been clearly evidenced that the highest H2 production activity was obtained with Au as a co-catalyst deposited on TiO2–P25. Pt-based photocatalysts are less active, whatever the support be. There are two possible and non-exclusive explanations: (i) Pt is very active (more than gold) toward the reverse reaction H2 +½O2 →H2O even at room temperature, thus decreasing the efficiency of H2 production. Indeed, it has already been reported by Iwase and colleagues that on NaTaO3:La, the reverse reaction between O2 and H2 was 1500 times less important with gold nanoparticles as a co-catalyst compared to platinum [47], (ii) the importance of the contact or interaction of the TiO2 semi-conductor with the precious metal, this contact depending on the nature of the metallic nanoparticles. Platinum is known to introduce ohmic contact facilitating a quick transfer of electrons to the electrolyte [48]. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles undergo charging and exhibit ability to store and transport electrons at the interfacial semi-conductor (TiO2)–metal composite interface. This charge distribution at the interface results in Fermi level equilibration of the composite. As already reported by Chen and colleagues [49], as gold nanoparticles possess the particular property to undergo quantitized charging, they are unique candidate to achieve Fermi level equilibration. The mediating role of Au nanoparticles for electron storing and shuttling at the TiO2–Au interface, inducing a negative shift in the Fermi level of TiO2, has already been evidenced by Kamat and colleagues [50]. Under illumination, when TiO2 and Au nanoparticles are in contact, the photogenerated electrons are distributed between both kinds of particles, leading to electron transfer from the excited TiO2 to Au, until the two systems attain equilibration [49,51]. The electron accumulation on the Au particles increases its Fermi level to more negative potentials, also leading to a shift in the Fermi level of the composite closer to the conduction band of the composite. As the Fermi level shifts to more negative potential, the charge separation and reductive power of the Au–TiO2 composite increases, which is of course beneficial to the photocatalytic reduction of H2O into H2. It should also not be forgotten that gold and platinum electrodes are usually reported to display different electrochemical properties in the generation of H2 [52,53]. The influence of the gold nanoparticle size on the H2 production efficiency has also been evidenced in our case. As the loading increased from 0.3 to 2wt.%, the mean particle size increased from 3 to 8nm, accompanied by an enhancement in the H2 evolution rate. This tendency is contrary to what is generally observed about the size dependence of catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles deposited on titania [54]. Furthermore, since the energy levels in gold nanoparticles are discrete, a greater shift in energy is expected for smaller size nanoparticles than for the larger ones. The smaller gold particles thus should have induced a greater shift in the apparent Fermi level of the Au–TiO2 composite [51]. This clearly means that in our case, other factors should also be considered, in addition to the intimate contact or interaction between the metallic and the semi-conductor nanoparticles. The compared UV–Vis characterizations of TiO2-supported gold and platinum photocatalysts showed that gold deposition shifted the absorption edge of the photocatalyst, whereas the deposition of Pt did not affect significantly the absorption spectrum. However, this better light absorption in the visible region of the spectrum cannot explain alone the better results obtained with gold-based catalysts; the nature of the TiO2 support is also of great importance, especially if we consider the poor results obtained on Au/TiO2–Brij56 compared to the results obtained on Au/TiO2–P25. Indeed, as from the results reported in part 3.2, Pt/TiO2–Brij 56 seemed to be the best combination for Pt-based catalysts, one would have expected the same for Au-based photocatalysts. Despite a lower specific surface area, leading theoretically to a poorer distribution of gold and also to lower accessibility of gold particles on the support, Au/TiO2–P25 showed the best activity, among gold-based catalysts. This is certainly due to the presence and the nature of surface –OH groups of the TiO2 support, as we know that the anionic exchange used for gold deposition requires a lot of hydroxyl groups for an efficient anchoring of gold complexes. XPS studies of the bare TiO2–P25 supports revealed that both the relative amount of surface –OH groups and their chemical environment (or interaction with the surrounding atoms) are different on both kinds of support. Furthermore, the important decrease in the proportion of surface–OH groups after gold deposition on TiO2–P25, but only on this support, evidenced the formation of strong gold complex–surface interactions, required for an efficient gold deposition. As on the TiO2–Brij56 support, the proportion of surface hydroxyl groups was less affected by gold deposition, a less efficient deposition and anchoring of gold complexes can be supposed. Other points derived from the suspension of particles in a liquid medium should also be considered: the surface chemistry, the agglomeration, the sedimentation, and the dispersion of the nanomaterials in the methanol/water solution and, as a result, a possible effect on optical properties. Indeed, as the photocatalytic properties in the liquid phase are sensitive to the state of dispersion of TiO2-based catalysts because of optical property considerations [55], complementary in situ characterization should be performed. One of the key factors may also be related to the anatase/rutile ratio. Since the anatase phase has a higher density of surface hydroxyl groups, the anatase/rutile ratio (80/20 and 50/50 for TiO2–P25 and TiO2–Brij56, respectively) may play an important role. Furthermore, as already mentioned in the literature [56], it should also be reminded that the photogenerated active oxygen species are different for rutile and anatase phases in aqueous solutions containing alcohols as scavenger of holes. But another factor that we consider determinant is the isoelectric point (IEP), together with the deposition conditions. Indeed, gold complexes in solution are negatively charged ( [Au ( OH ) x Cl 1 - x ] - , with 0< x <4). From an electronic interaction point of view, the support has thus to be positively charged for the deposition to be efficient. It can be observed from Fig. 12 that the isoelectric point of the tested supports decreases in the order TiO2–P25 (6.7)>TiO2–Brij56 (2.4)>TiO2–PEG (1.8). The IEP is closely linked to the density of surface hydroxyl groups. Since anatase has a higher density of surface hydroxyl groups than rutile, this decrease in the IEP value with increasing rutile content is not a surprise. Consequently, the low IEP of the sol–gel TiO2–Brj56 and TiO2–PEG supports requires very low pHs, lower than 2.4 and 1.8, respectively, for an efficient anchoring of gold particles. Furthermore, at pH<2.4, gold complexes in solution have a high chloride content ( AuCl 4 - ), the direct anionic exchange is not efficient and the deposited gold particles are prone to sintering. We can also suppose that the lower activity observed on the TiO2–Brij56 support mainly results from the deposition method of gold complexes and not from the support itself. Changing the deposition method or using a support with higher anatase/rutile ratio without modifying the large surface area would thus probably lead to higher activities. We have also put forward the very important role of methanol. Methanol acts as an effective sacrificial reagent by scavenging either O2 or holes, limiting the reverse H2 +1/2 O2 →H2O reaction, and increasing charge separation. Even if a part of H2 is produced by photocatalytic methanol reforming, it has been demonstrated that most of it is issued from direct photocatalytic water splitting."
12,Conclusion,"Efficient H2 production (up to 120μmol/min) from water splitting using optimal and very small (1vol.%) amount of methanol has been achieved on low content (0.3wt.%) Au/TiO2 anatase–rutile photocatalysts. The addition of methanol is required to reach high evolution rates but keeping this ratio as low as 1vol.% seems to be a good balance between sustainable high efficiency and limiting the use of fuel-derived and non-renewable resources. The efficiency can be tuned, the main factors affecting H2 evolution rates are the nature and concentration of the noble metal co-catalyst, the anatase/rutile ratio of the support, its specific area and porosity. In optimized conditions, interesting H2 production efficiency can be maintained over days without deactivation and without the addition of extra methanol."
