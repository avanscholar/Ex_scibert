0,Introduction,"Developing dynamic, choosy and energy proficient heterogeneous catalytic processes are extremely indispensable to an inexhaustible future because heterogeneous catalysis is at the central part of the chemicals and pharmaceutical industries. The fabrication and execution of selective heterogeneous catalytic processes could have a marvelous encouraging impact on the globe as it may perform the catalytic reaction at a lower temperature, pressure and/or in less time thus wealth can be saved in up-scale reactions. Contrast to this, catalyst deactivation is the subject of considerable seriousness [1], which is the major impediment to research, design and advancing stable catalysts. That's why it is necessary to be acquainted with the reason and remedy for catalytic deactivation. Research on the catalyst deactivation has been spreading gradually across-the-board, since last three decades [2–15]. Deactivation broadly classifieds into three type viz. chemical, mechanical and thermal which includes metal poisoning, foiling, thermal degradation, leaching, solid-solid interactions and mainly support [16–18]. However, it can be lessened by vigilant control of process conditions and by a cautious choice of support materials. According to archaic aphorism “prevention is better than cure”, we have to be more careful in choosing the support. In this days and age of rising, heaps of supports are available but most of them are inept due to deactivation [17,18]. With the determination to overcome this ineptness, the pursuit of the heterogeneous acid catalyst has resulted in the consideration of carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) [19,20]. Interestingly, this era was lessened with graphite as the eye-catching scientific significance of graphene as a catalyst and catalytic support in heterogeneous catalysis has grown very impressively over the past several years [21]. Characteristically, graphene has a two-dimensional crystal structure, sp 2 bonded carbon atoms densely packed in a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped lattice and plenty of functional groups on its basal plane and edges. During the recent time, chemically modified graphene (CMG) as graphene oxide (GO) based research has gained a stupendous strength owing to their latent outstanding quality especially in the field of catalysis [22,23]. Unique properties like high surface area [24] of ~2630 m2/g, promising high thermal stability, elevated tensile strength [25], promotes mass transfer and superior resistivity towards degradation in acidic and basic media, etc. are outstanding features of GO which increases its marvelous features. GO surface is decorated by hydroxyl and epoxy groups on its basal plane and carboxyl groups on its edges. All these functional groups smooth the progress of functionalization by covalent linkage of a choice of organic moieties. This modified material is lasting and can effectively bind a metal. Transition metal ion is well known for its catalytic properties due to the fascinating electron-transfer properties [26]. Minimal surface migration up to 700 °C [27] and a change in coordination environment around the transition metal ion plays an important role in modulating its catalytic properties. However, the ligands having a number of donor sites which tune the properties of the complexes for oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions as well [28–30]. Metal alone as a catalyst may suffer from redispersion and/or sintering snags, so it is worthwhile to support the metal particles on the solid support. As opposed to the remote past, the contemporary remarkable applications of covalent grafting of transition metal complexes onto the GO nanosheets [31–33] are a proficient move towards the remedy of shortcomings of homogeneous catalysis. It is a very challenging task to identify the key intermediates and platform chemicals with the greatest potential for use as value-added chemicals [34,35]. Kinds of literature related to production and transformation of these intermediate chemicals were seen to be significantly increased for widespread reactions, for instance, reduction, dehydration and especially oxidation of alcohols plays a vital role in their development [36]. On the other hand, selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, ketones and/or carboxylic acids with strict control is a vital function of these most important transformations in organic synthesis [37]. Particularly, aldehydes and ketones are valuable organic intermediates/products in dyes, perfumeries and agro-chemicals industries [38]. Over the years, the use of hazardous oxidants and heavy metals has been done for the conventional oxidation of alcohols, however, these oxidants and heavy metals are carcinogenic and adverse to the environment also. As a remedy of this unwelcomed situation, this era went ahead with aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an enormously eye-catching oxidant due to a gentle, inexpensive and environmentally kind and pleasant reagent having active oxygen up to a great extent and simply water as the by-product. Conventionally, BzH is yielded by hydrolysis of benzal chloride which contaminates the product with chlorine and by oxidation of toluene which requires environmentally adverse organic solvents [35]. To acquire pure BzH, catalytic liquid phase selective oxidation of BzA has broadly been adopted. Herein, we report the modification of one of the functional groups presented on the surface of GO, especially hydroxyl groups by amino groups and investigates the catalytic aspects of these composite catalysts over the selective oxidation of BzA supported by the computational investigation. Centre of attention in this article is the study of corroboration of functionalization of hydroxyl groups alone along with the factors affecting the catalytic activity and also to explain the correlation with the computational investigation."

3,Physico-chemical techniques,"2.2 Physico-chemical techniques Various physicochemical techniques have been employed to characterize the structure of ML-f-GO. The quantitative analysis of transition metal ions of ML-f-GO was carried out by ICP-OES using model ARCOS, Simultaneous ICP Spectrometer from SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Germany. Electronic spectra were recorded on UV-2450 spectrophotometer from Shimadzu using a quartz cell of 1 cm3 optical path.

5,Preparation of amino-functionalized graphene oxide (A-f-GO),"2.4 Preparation of amino-functionalized graphene oxide (A-f-GO) APTMS was used to functionalize GO and as a result of this functionalization amino (NH2) groups were served in place of hydroxyl groups presented on the surface of GO. 1200 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed in 150 ml of toluene using ultrasonic treatment for 45 min. Then, 3.6 ml of APTMS was added and the suspension was allowed to reflux at boiling temperature for 24 h under N2 atmosphere. The resulting mixture was filtered and washed with toluene several times to remove unreacted APTMS."

After completion of the reaction, the resulting mixture was filtered and washed with methanol several times to remove unreacted metal salts and then dried in an oven to get black solid of the final catalyst."
8,Results and discussion,"Various physicochemical techniques being evident for preparation of GO, successful functionalization of the amino-based moiety; Schiff base ligand and immobilization of metal ions are described here. Fig. 1 reveals the UV–visible absorption spectrum of the suspended GO nanosheet. The characteristic peak in electronic spectra of GO was observed in the range of 200–300 nm, which was in accordance with literature data [40]. The main absorption peak at about 230 nm is attributed to the π → π* transition of an aromatic CC bond, and the shoulder at about 300 nm was thought to be caused by conjugated aromatic n → π* transition of CO bond [41]. This result is in good agreement with FTIR result on the existence of oxygen functional groups in GO nanosheets as discussed below. However, the intensity of the shoulder increases gradually with functionalization, indicating the decrease of π-electrons and structural arrangement resulted from the formation of sp3 carbon by covalent attachment of organic moiety [42]. However, in the electronic spectrum of A-f-GO, the band at 230 nm in GO was shifted to 215 nm. This blue shift of ~15 nm attributes to the increase of π-electrons concentration which resulted in the development of more sp2 carbon confirming the covalent bonding between amino groups of APTMS and GO nanosheet. After the functionalization with Schiff base ligand and the metal ion, the peak at 230 nm in GO was further shifted to blue region and the peak at 300 nm in GO exhibits red shift might be due to increasing concentration of CO. This red shift confirms the successful attachment of Schiff base ligand and the metal ion to the GO. Evidence of successful oxidation of graphite into GO and further transformation of oxygen functionalities, hydroxyl groups for the most part, by amino groups of APTMS, has been evidenced by FTIR spectra (Fig. 2 ) of GO, A-f-GO, L-f-GO (L = Schiff base ligand), and ML-f-GO (M = VO4+, Co2+, Cu2+). In the FTIR spectra of GO, stretching vibrations of OH at 3389 cm−1, CO at 1722 cm−1, un-oxidized graphitic region skeletal vibrations at 1623 cm−1 and COC at 1057 cm−1 were observed [43,44]. However, the characteristic peak associated to OH stretching was virtually drop downed and new peaks arise at around 3219 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1 was associated to NH stretching vibrations [45] in the FTIR spectra of A-f-GO suggests the introduction of amino silane chain. This suggests that virtually most of the hydroxyl groups were functionalized by amino groups and the OH groups are only the site of attachment for the amino groups of APTMS. Stretching vibrations for SiOSi and SiOC at 1115 cm−1 and 1037 cm−1 also established demonstrating potent absorption of SiO bonds that are formed through the silylation reaction between the silanol groups of APTMS and OH groups of GO [45,46]. Furthermore, new peaks observed at 2929 cm−1 and 2860 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of CH bonds [47]. In the FTIR spectra of the L-f-GO, due to insertion of ligand, a strong band observed at 1622 cm−1 was attributed to the CN group. On coordination, due to possible drift of the lone pair density towards the metal ion, this CN band was shifted to lower frequency region and was observed at 1613, 1614 and 1596 cm−1 in CuL-f-GO, CoL-f-GO and VOL-f-GO, respectively, indicates the coordination of the azomethine nitrogen to the metal ion [48]. However, peaks of carboxyl and epoxy groups are clearly visible in all the spectra of functionalized GO. All these indisputably facts are in agreement with the successful functionalization of OH groups with APTMS moiety. Furthermore, the chemical and compositional alteration along with its thermal stability in the as-prepared materials is also reflected in the TGA/DSC analysis of GO, A-f-GO, and CuL-f-GO (Fig. 3a and b). In the TGA curve of GO, it degrades into three stages. The first stage of degradation starts within the temperature range of 40–110 °C by giving 12.09% of weight loss due to loss of water molecules. This is further supported by an endothermic peak at 90.7 °C in DSC of GO. This early degradation starts at lower temperature shows the high defect density in GO. This mass loss becomes extremely swift as the temperature lifted up. The second stage of thermal reduction starts within the temperature range of 110–320 °C with an observed weight loss of 34.59%, attributed to pyrolysis of oxidative functional groups to CO, CO2, and H2O. A Peak at 199 °C in DSC, owing to an obliteration of oxidative functionalities, was further in accordance with this mass loss in TGA. The third stage, which occurs in the temperature range of 320–700 °C giving 51.56% of weight loss owing to decomposition of the remaining carbonaceous component of the graphene sheet. In accordance with this, a considerably huge exothermic peak at around 470 °C observed in DSC of GO was believed to be due to combustion of carbon skeleton in GO. In the thermogravimetric spectrum of A-f-GO, weight loss in the first stage lessened to 9.92% due to the removal of water of crystallization during silylation reaction. In the second stage, the temperature range reduced to 280 °C for the weight loss of 19.18%. This thermal reduction of ~40 °C compared to GO was because of replacement of OH groups by amino groups of APTMS. However, the third stage of degradation with 70.90% weight loss was an elongated contrast to GO due to the introduction of several additional organic moieties by the reaction with amino-silane moiety. This is further supported by DSC curve of A-f-GO, in which, due to the removal of hydroxyl groups, the first small exothermic peak was seen to be at a shifted position around 218 °C and a large peak was found to be at around 482 °C with reduced intensity. For the CuL-f-GO, these degradation steps lessened to two stages. First stage weight loss of 8.65% was attributed to the further loss of water molecules. Second degradation stage observed from 180 °C to 650 °C shows very slow decomposition of the Schiff base ligand along with graphene sheet with the weight loss of 82.35%. This process is accompanied by DSC plot of CuL-f-GO which shows that the intensity of an exothermic peak was further abated due to more destruction on insertion of Schiff base metal complex onto the surface of GO. At this point, still, ~9% of the quantity remains without degradation that might be CuO. Based on this result, we can state that probable hydroxyl groups only, of the GO surface, get transformed. Raman spectroscopy is the constructive tool used to characterize carbon nanomaterials to get aware of chemical and structural modification. For any graphitic material especially, D and G bands and their overtone are the chief characteristics of Raman spectroscopy. GO (Fig. 4 ) possess these two bands at 1334 and 1578 cm−1 which are attributed to the out of plane vibrations due to the breathing mode of aromatic ring owing to the presence of defects and in-plane vibrations due to bond stretching of sp 2 carbons in rings and chains [49], respectively. The intensity ratio of D/G band is a measure of the defects present on the graphene structure. Furthermore, two additional peaks also observed at 2680 and 2949 cm−1 were attributed to 2D peak creation of two phonons having opposite momentum resulting from double resonance transition and defect activated D + G peak [50,51]. Here, the ID/IG ratio for GO is 0.84 while it increases to 1.01 for A-f-GO, 1.04 for CuL-f-GO and CoL-f-GO, however it is 0.9 for VOL-f-GO, respectively. This increment was might be due to an increase in disorder owing to the attachment of APTMS moiety and the metal ion [52]. In the Raman spectra of A-f-GO, CuL-f-GO, CoL-f-GO and VOL-f-GO G band was shifted to red shift after silylation and functionalization with Schiff base transition metal complexes. This up-shift probably due to the effective charge transfer [53] from GO to amino-silane and the metal ion which causes strain because of covalent annexation [54]. XRD analysis is an imperative tool to investigate the crystallinity of the fabricated composites. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of GO, A-f-GO, CuL-f-GO, VOL-f-GO and CoL-f-GO. In the XRD pattern of GO, a strong diffraction peak (100) of the crystal plane was observed at 2θ = 10.9° being an evidence for the highly oxidized GO [55]. It is well known that pristine graphite shows a peak at 2θ = 26.5° and with this 2θ value, pristine graphite shows an interlayer distance of 3.36 Å. After oxidation of pristine graphite, this spacing was increased to 8.1 Å (calculated using Bragg's equation) in GO due to insertion of oxidative functional groups on the edges on each layer [54]. Another commonly observed peak in graphitic materials at 2θ = 42.2° might be due to the defects caused by the presence of residual trace MnO2, formed during synthesis, in the un-exfoliated GO sheets. In the XRD pattern of A-f-GO, peak at 2θ = 10.9° also recorded but the intensity was decreased significantly, confirming that the graphene sheet was get rid of hydroxyl groups and transformed productively into amino groups showing rest of the oxidative functional groups remains intact, in accordance with FTIR and XPS spectra. XRD pattern of A-f-GO exhibits characteristic peaks analogous to GO, adeptly allotted to the crystallographic plane of hexagonal GO indicating that incorporation of amino groups do not alter the crystallinity of the material. However, in the spectra of ML-f-GO (M = VO4+, Co2+, Cu2+), the broad peak centered at 2θ = 26.5° might be due to non-well-organized layers of graphene nanosheets [56]. On the other hand, it is likely to calculate the estimated nanocrystallite size from XRD data [57] using Debye˗Scherrer equation. We have calculated the size of as-prepared CuL-f-GO catalyst assuming the spherical shape of the crystallite. The approximate size calculated was 6.2 nm which is very close to the TEM result (7–13 nm). Furthermore XPS analysis was performed to have information about the elemental composition and bonding environment of the as-prepared catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the XPS analysis of GO, A-f-GO, and CuL-f-GO. Fig. 6a reveals that GO consisting of C and O element only showing signals at 286.1 eV and 533.3 eV, respectively, whereas after in situ silylation with APTMS and treatment with copper ion solutions, the presence of N and Cu elements are also identified at 400.2 and 933.54 eV, respectively. However, high-resolution C1S spectra (Fig. 6b) shows the bonding constitution of GO as CC, CO, COC, and CO observed at 286.1, 285.8, 287.7 and 288.6 eV, respectively; indicating successful oxidation of graphite by modified Hummer's method. From the survey spectra of A-f-GO, silylation of APTMS and hydroxyl groups of GO was confirmed by a peak observed at 101.4 eV emerges in the form of Si 2p spectrum [57]. However, high-resolution C1s spectra of A-f-GO (Fig. S1) showed a lessen peak at 286.4 eV suggesting that N covalently attached to the graphene nanosheets [58, 59]. It was also corroborated by high-resolution N 1S spectra (Fig. 6c) which shows four peaks at 400.2, 400.9, 402.03 and 403.37 eV attributed to NH+, NH, NH2, and Ar-NH2, respectively. After the thermal reaction between Schiff base ligand and the metal ion, NH bond converted to NC due to the donor-acceptor interaction between N and central metal (Cu) ion. Fig. 6d reflects the bonding energy of Cu observed at 934.5 eV and 953.6 eV, while the satellite peak of Cu 2p3/2 observed at 942.5 eV was being an evidence for the interaction between ligand and metal center. All these data of XPS, confirms the successful immobilization of APTMS and metal ion onto the GO surface. By bearing in mind the extent of XPS, we executed SEM and TEM analysis to be acquainted with the surface morphology of the catalyst. Fig. 7a–c represents the SEM images of GO, A-f-GO, and CuL-f-GO, respectively and Fig. 8 represents the TEM image of CuL-f-GO. Fig. 7(a) indicates a two-dimensional sheet-like structure of GO with manifold lamellar layered structure stacked one on other. In the formation of stacked layered structure, GO sheets aggregate mainly by the edges as the oxygenated functional groups, for the most part, have a tendency to combine together by dangling bonds and hence the thickness of GO sheet at the edges is more. However, after functionalization with APTMS and the metal ion, the roughness of the surface was found to be increased might be due to loss of hydrophilicity of GO [60]. From Fig. 7(c), evenly distributed metal particles onto the GO surface can clearly be seen. Multilayered lamellar structure of GO and metal functionalized GO is also substantiated by TEM analysis (Fig. 8a and b). However, the thickness of individual GO nanosheets was analyzed to be 5–7 nm (Fig. S1) larger than the thickness of single-layer graphene nanosheet. The reason for this high thickness was believed to be due to the insertion of oxidative functional groups [51]. BET analysis makes obvious that as-prepared GO possess 94.23 m2/g of surface area, while after the functionalization with APTMS surface area was reduced to 40.70 m2/g which was further reduced to 33.37 m2/g after the immobilization of Schiff base metal complex. From the ICPOES results, the metal content in as-prepared catalysts has been estimated as 146.7, 36.82 and 23.01 ppm for Cu, Co and V, respectively. From these data, metal loading per gram in the catalysts was calculated to be 11.73 for CuL-f-GO, 2.94 for CoL-f-GO and 1.84 mg/g for VOL-f-GO, respectively."
9,DFT study,"3.1 DFT study In present work, we first optimized 42 atoms hydrogen terminated graphene sheet, each of two functional groups i.e. COOH, COC, OH and NH2 on the graphene sheet. To find the best attachment site for carboxyl group on GO sheet, we calculated binding energy between carboxyl, epoxy (epoxide), hydroxyl, amine groups and graphene sheet by placing the carboxyl group at several sites of the graphene sheet. Our calculated binding energy values for different sites show that the carboxyl groups prefer to bind at the edges (Fig. S5 (b)) instead of the basal plane which is consistent with the previous works [61,62]. However, the epoxy or epoxide group tends to locate at the top site of the graphene nanosheet (Fig. S5 (c)) and changes the hybridization of carbon from sp2 to sp3 with a binding energy of 2.078 eV listed in Table 1 . The hydroxyl and amino groups have a propensity to aggregate on graphene sheet in zig-zag or arm chair direction of carbon atoms. This leads to the conclusion that all functional groups except carboxyl group which binds at edges bind to graphene sheet on its basal planes. Further, the binding energy calculation shows that the binding energy of the amino group is 0.58 eV higher than the hydroxyl group i.e. 0.55 eV and lesser than epoxy and carboxyl groups (Table 1), respectively. However, the reactivity of carboxyl and epoxy functional groups is higher than that of hydroxyl and amino groups leading a perseverance of their position on the graphene sheet. It means the probability of replacement of carboxyl and epoxy groups by amino groups is negligible. However, due to low binding energy, hydroxyl groups show positive response towards the replacement with amino groups. Here, reactivity of the amino group is almost the same as the hydroxyl group and therefore the probability of replacement of hydroxyl groups is higher compared to other functional groups. The optimized Cu and Co based catalysts on the graphene sheet are shown in Fig. S6. Furthermore, the electronic nature of materials plays a vital role to understand the various chemical properties of materials such as interaction, chemical stability and/or reactivity. We have calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 9 ) to find the reactivity, recyclability and chemical stability of catalysts which has been studied theoretically previously [63]. The magnitude of HOMO can be attributed as ionization potentials and high value of ionization potentials leads to high stability and chemical inertness. These two properties are very essential for any catalyst to prove their potency. From these results (Table 2 ), it is evidently examined that Cu based catalyst will be advantageous and superior for its catalytic aptitude. We have also calculated energy gap, global hardness and softness of considered transition metal-based catalysts using Koopman's theorem. Energy gap, global hardness and softness of Cu and Co-based catalysts were also calculated using Koopman's theorem. According to maximum hardness principal, materials having high value of hardness leads to the resistance towards the deformation under a small perturbation of chemical reaction. Not much difference seen in the values of global hardness and softness of both transition metal-based catalysts, even though Cu immobilized catalyst is proven to be a better candidate for this chemical transformation. As a result of this computational investigation, evidence and detailed examination of the elements by DFT it can be inferred that CuL-f-GO will prove to be a better catalyst in terms of reactivity and stability (reusability). These results are in good accordance with our experimental results."
10,Catalytic activity,"As the functionalized catalysts have been successfully synthesized, the catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by the selective oxidation of BzAusing 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as environmentally benign oxidant with the assistance of ethylene glycol as product selective solvent. It is extremely intricate to control this oxidation reaction in the intermediary step of formation of BzH and for this rationale, various parameters have been optimized, for instance, mole ratio, temperature, amount of catalyst, solvent effect, solvent amount, oxidant and grade of raw material etc. To acquire this, first, all the catalysts like pristine graphite, graphene oxide, A-f-GO, L-f-GO and ML-f-GO were employed for this selective oxidation reaction."
11,Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol,"4.1 Selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol In a typical reaction condition, first, a catalyst was dispersed in a solvent and stirred for 10 min. and reactant was added in this mixture and stirred again for 10 min. for complete activation of the substrate. After activating the substrate oxidant was added slowly for successful oxidation into the reaction mixture and the final mixture was stirred for experimentally pre-decided time to get higher conversion and yield. For this reaction, BzA(40 mmol), 30% H2O2 (40 mmol), ethylene glycol as a solvent (5 ml) and 50 mg of catalyst was feed to 50 ml three-neck round bottom flask and equilibrated at 90 °C for 3 h. The reaction was followed by taking the aliquot at the stated time interval and analyzed by GC. Fig. 10 shows the comparison of heterogeneous catalysts driven catalytic production of BzH. As compared to pristine graphite, graphene oxide and all the Schiff base metal complex immobilized GO (ML-f-GO; M = VO4+, Co2+, Cu2+), highest catalytic production of BzH was achieved with CuL-f-GO catalyst and reaches a maximum conversion of 99.5% BzA and 99.67% selectivity of BzH with TOF 103.5 h−1. However, TOF values calculated for other catalysts were found feeble that is 42.95 and 31.43 h−1 for VOL-f-GO and CoL-f-GO, respectively. From this data, CuL-f-GO was preferred as the representative catalyst for further investigation of the impact of other experimental variables."
12,Impact of mole ratio,"4.2 Impact of mole ratio To determine the impact of varying mole ratios of a substrate to the oxidant, four different mole ratios (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5) were taken with keeping all other parameters fixed. As shown in Fig. 11 , it was noticed that H2O2 had played a crucial role in the degradation of benzyl alcohol; low concentration of H2O2 to the substrate gave a rather similar conversion of BzA. Further increase in the concentration of H2O2 (1:2) results in an increase in the conversion of BzA and a higher concentration of H2O2 (1:2.5) extends the conversion to 100% but the selectivity to BzH, however, decreased with increasing mole ratio. The explanation for this decreasing selectivity with increasing mole ratio of BzA to 30% hydrogen peroxide was a probably higher amount of oxidant which might further oxidize the aldehyde to acid and ester up to some extent. Here, conversion increases with mole ratio were not so high but the selectivity decreased considerably. So as to attain higher yield with a higher rate of conversion we have taken the mole ratio 1:1 to investigate the impact of other parameters."
13,Impact of an amount of catalyst,"4.3 Impact of an amount of catalyst Catalyst amount is very crucial for any heterogenized catalytic reaction. Here in this selective oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol, we employed diverse catalyst amounts like 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg (Fig. 12 ) and observed the conversion of almost 100% in 10 mg of catalyst. Further increasing the amount of catalyst to 50 mg, no significant change in conversion was observed, however, the selectivity was affected extensively. Maximum 99.51% selectivity of BzH was observed with 50 mg of catalyst. Selectivity is mainly concerned with the reaction mechanism and the active sites involved in terms of metal loading. There is inherent mechanism between substrates, catalyst and products and hence in order to control the selectivity, we need to improve stabilization of the intermediary for desired reaction route and to set up the equilibrium between catalyst-intermediary, catalyst-product and catalyst-by-product interactions. Consequently, by increasing the amount of catalyst, the metal concentration was also increased and attains the adequate for the powerful interaction between the catalyst-substrate and catalyst-intermediary. As a result, in an attempt to achieve higher conversion of BzA and higher selectivity of BzH, we have taken 50 mg catalyst for further investigation. Reaction condition: BzA(40 mmol), 30% H2O2 (40 mmol), 90 °C, ethylene glycol (5 ml), 20 min."
14,Impact of reaction time,"4.4 Impact of reaction time For this typical selective oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol, it is very important to stop this reaction at the correct time to succeed in attaining desired yield as well as higher selectivity of BzH. For this intent, we carried out this reaction at different time intervals, viz. 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 60 and 180 min (Fig. 13 ). It was observed that the conversion and selectivity both increased with time and attained a maximum at 20 min. However, the reaction continues up to 180 min, no significant change in the conversion of BzA with a drastic decrease in selectivity of BzH was observed, which might be due to further oxidation of this intermediary product to the acid. However, benzoic acid formed during the reaction reacts instantaneously with BzA, forming benzyl benzoate, hence the certain moles of BzA consumed and therefore reduction in the conversion of BzA was observed. For this reason, we decided to set the time for 20 min. For further exploration."
15,Impact of solvent,"4.5 Impact of solvent The rate of reaction, selectivity, stability of the desired yield, catalytic activity and almost entire process of the reaction would be influenced by the choice of solvent [65]. However, as we know, there is no ubiquitous archetypal for prognostication of the solvent effect on the reactions. For that, a researcher has to spend sufficient amount of time by employing various solvents to optimize a reaction. This work also intended to evaluate the viability of solvent effect on the selectivity of BzH and hence it was scheduled to study the outcome of different solvents like methanol, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, toluene, and ethylene glycol. As shown in Fig. 14 , except ethylene glycol, all the solvents were proved to be inferior for the desired conversion and selectivity of BzA and BzH, respectively. With the enormous effort, ethylene glycol was found to be choice of solvent with BzA conversion of 99.53% and BzH selectivity of 99.67%. We might get the more conversion with other solvents by increasing the time but still the selectivity of BzH was very fewer because they favour the oxidation reaction of the intermediary product, however, ethylene glycol forms cyclic acetal (Fig. S7) with BzH which refuses further oxidation. Consequently, ethylene glycol was taken as the preferred solvent for this transformation."
16,Impact of the amount of solvent,"4.6 Impact of the amount of solvent Good results of all these reactions became a driving force for the optimization of another parameter. We performed the reaction by varying the amount of solvent (viz. 2, 5, and 10 ml) to acquire the understanding of solvent amount on this transformation. As shown in Fig. 15 , increase in the amount of ethylene glycol from 2 to 5 ml, conversion of BzA remains identical but the selectivity of BzH was increased appreciably from 89.96 to 99.87%. A further increased in the amount of ethylene glycol causes a slight decrease in BzA conversion and selectivity of BzH. The reason for this reduction we express in terms of the concentration of the reaction mixture, which might be diluted than the required concentration for the desired outcomes and so it lessens the conversion and selectivity [62]. As a result, we have chosen 5 ml of solvent for further optimization of reaction."
17,Impact of oxidants,"4.7 Impact of oxidants The effect of different oxidants such as 70% TBHP and 30% H2O2 on the oxidation of BzA was investigated by choosing an arbitrary reaction parameter as shown in Fig. 16 . The data demonstrate that use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant gives a higher conversion of BzA (99.57%) and higher selectivity of BzH (99.87%) than TBHP (17.83% conversion and 27.43% selectivity). Moreover, H2O2 is a strong oxidant, often more effective, fairly inexpensive, easy to handle and yield water as the by-product. Consequently, H2O2 was taken as an oxidant throughout for further the catalytic study. This catalyst was recycled six times (Fig. 17 ) without significant loss of activity."
18,Impact of the source of raw material,"4.8 Impact of the source of raw material With all these explorations, we thought to check one more important aspect i.e. mesh size of graphite flakes grade of the raw material of these as-prepared catalysts. To check and confirm the impact of less mesh size of raw material, we purchased graphite of 60 mesh size and we fabricated GO, A-f-GO, and CuL-f-GO and analyzed by various physicochemical techniques like FTIR, BET, RAMAN and XRD followed by comparing it with GO, A-f-GO and CuL-f-GO prepared from high-grade (325 mesh size). FTIR spectrum of the GO, A-f-GO, and CuL-f-GO (prepared from the low-grade graphite) is shown in Fig. S8. We can confirm the low degree of oxidation and the peak intensity of all the oxidative groups is diminished. Apparently, it is estimated that if the initial oxidation is inadequate then the final catalyst would not be as good as of high-grade. This was also substantiated from the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. S9. The peak observed at 10.9° in high grade GO was shifted to 12.6°. The interlayer distance for this GO was calculated 7.01 Å which is less than in high grade GO indicating less amount of oxygenated functionalities inserted between the layers of graphite which is caused by the low degree of oxidation [54]. From Fig. S9, it is seen that an intensity of the peak at 26.3° was a slight increase during the formation of final the catalyst which shows that lower grade GO might be reduced up to some extent. However, peak observed at 42.2° attributed to the defects caused by the presence of residual trace MnO2 was also lessened in the XRD of lower grade GO, which further supports the low degree of oxidation. In the Raman spectra (Fig. S10), ID/IG ratio for GO is 0.84 which is comparable to high-grade graphite products. However, for metal immobilized GO ID/IG ratio is 0.94 which is very lower than high-grade graphite formation; this reflects less degree of oxidation as the defects build upon the surface of GO was very less. BET results are also varying from the higher grade graphite. BET surface area for this low-grade graphite was observed 41.6 m2/g and in the final catalyst, was just remaining 0.5 m2/g with a pore volume of 0.004 cm3/g. This surface area was very less for catalytic transformation and the increased pore diameter may also affect desorption of the final products which might be reflected in catalytic results too. For the selective transformation of BzA to BzH, we observed very poor results with this low-grade catalyst. Maximum conversion of BzA was achieved i.e. 49% with this low-grade catalyst and selectivity was also very less."
19,Computational details,"4.9 Computational details The full geometry optimization of 42 atoms hydrogen terminated pristine graphene sheet, different functional groups and graphene sheet with functional groups has been carried out using Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr hybrid exchange–correlation three-parameter functional (B3LYP) [66] with the 6–31G basis set under the frame work of density functional theory (DFT) based Gaussian 09 suite program [67] For these optimization conditions, all structures were fully relaxed in the absence of external fields and the binding energy is calculated using following expression. E B = E graphene + functional group − E graphene + n E functional group ; where n is the number of functional groups attached to the graphene sheet and E B , E (graphene+functional group), E (graphene) and E (functional group) are the binding energy of functionalized graphene, a total energy of functionalized graphene, graphene and functional group, respectively."
20,Conclusions,"In concluding remarks, catalysts are the vitally important remedy for selective transformation which favours one precise reaction over another, thus again making the process much more economical. The present work executed the functionalization on the surface hydroxyl groups of GO in assistance with DFT and investigated the catalytic aspects of the composite catalysts. Successful fabrication of GO, A-f-GO and ML-f-GO catalysts has been confirmed by various physicochemical techniques, for instance, FTIR, Raman, TGA, UV–vis., XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS. We have performed DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of replacement of hydroxyl groups on GO by amino groups through the calculations of binding energy. In this systematic study, we found that the carboxyl and epoxy groups preferred to bind at edges and top sites, respectively, while the amino and hydroxyl groups tend to positioned at a basal plane of the GO. We envisaged from the binding energy trend (COOH > COC > NH2 > OH) that amino groups replace only hydroxyl groups corroborating the experimental findings. In addition to this, we have calculated energy gap, global hardness and softness to know the chemical reactivity, stability and recyclability of the catalysts. Among them, CuL-f-GO catalyst was best suited for this selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. CuL-f-GO catalyst was proved to be highly effective and recycled six times for selective oxidation of BzA and this excellent performance was due to the GO support and vigorous immobilization tactic. The influences of distinct parameters like temperature, time, catalyst amount, solvents, amount of solvent and catalytic support have also been studied and observed that support, raw material and especially solvent plays an imperative role in this catalytic transformation. Here, GO presents its unique state of being superior and latent qualities in supporting the homogeneous metal complexes for practical approaches. However, it is still a great challenge to produce nanoparticles in sub-nano scale at low cost and in a facile way."
