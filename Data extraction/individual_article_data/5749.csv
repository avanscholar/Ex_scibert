0,Introduction,"With the increase of global energy consumption, the shortage of fossil fuels, and adverse impacts of environmental quality and climate changes, the public is urgent to explore and develop some environmentally friendly energy sources (Ebaid et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019a, 2019b). Biomass, as a kind of renewable and sustainable energy, has aroused wide concerned. Lignin is the second most abundant biomass component after cellulose on Earth (Huber et al., 2006.; Liao et al., 2014.; Zakzeski et al., 2010), which is a three-dimensional, highly cross-linked macromolecule generated by oxidative coupling of three phenyl propane monomers: p-coumaryl alcohol (p-CMA), coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol (Asatryan et al., 2019). Lignin is abundant and versatile, but it has not been effectively utilized (Chan et al., 2016; Forchheim et al., 2014) owing to its inherent heterogeneity and recalcitrance (Vardon et al., 2015). In order to improve the utilization efficiency of lignin and acquire higher economic benefits, people have attempted to decompose lignin into low-molecular-weight value-added compounds through thermal or chemical pathways (Cheng et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2017; Jiang and Hu, 2016), especially the pyrolysis reaction of lignin (Kawamoto, 2017; Kawamoto et al., 2007). However, these processes have produced a huge of phenolic compounds, such as guaiacol, catechol and p-CMA, whose oxidation in the atmosphere have posed an adverse effect on ambient air quality (Coeur-Tourneur et al., 2009) and a health risk to human health (Lomnicki et al., 2008; Payton et al., 2011). Recently, the atmospheric behaviors of phenolic compounds originated from lignin pyrolysis (Amen-Chen et al., 2001; Kibet et al., 2012) have already drawn the attention from the academia. During atmospheric transport, the possible degradation pathways of these organic compounds mainly include dry and wet deposition, direct photolysis or chemical reactions with oxidants, especially with hydroxyl radicals (OH·), nitrate radicals (NO3·), chlorine atoms (Cl) and ozone molecules (O3). To date, a lot of valuable scientific studies have been devoted to the atmospheric behaviors of phenolic compounds. The atmospheric reactivity of guaiacol and syringol initiated by OH radicals has been determined at 294 ± 2 K (Coeur-Tourneur et al., 2010; Lauraguais et al., 2012, 2014). Rate constant of the two compounds with OH radical was in the order of magnitude of 10−19 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, and the estimated atmospheric life was about 2 h. The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production has been monitored using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer. They revealed that the aerosol yield has been shown to be affected by the initial compound concentration, which results in aerosol yields ranging from 0.10–0.36 for syringol and 0.003 to 0.87 for guaiacol, respectively. The gas-phase reaction processes of nitrate radicals with guaiacol, creosol and syringol have been investigated (Yang et al., 2016). By combining experimental and theoretical methods, they determined that 4-nitroguaiacol, 6-nitroguaiacol and 4,6-dinitroguaiacol are the main degradation products for guaiacol, meanwhile 6-nitrocreosol and 3-nitrosyringol are primary products for creosol and syringol, respectively. The possible formation mechanisms of the main products have been proposed and the relationship between nitro-products and SOA was established. Ofner et al. reported that ozonolysis of catechol and guaiacol could efficiently give rise to SOA formation in the presence and absence of simulated sunlight and humidity (Ofner et al., 2011). At 298 K and 1 atm, the reaction constants for ozonolysis of 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol were calculated to be 7.89 × 10−17 and 1.11 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively, with corresponding atmospheric lifetimes of 5.03 and 35.75 h (Sun et al., 2019). These fruitful works summarized the reaction rules of phenolic compounds. It is of great significance to investigate the removal pathways of methoxyphenol in the atmosphere and better understanding of its effect on SOA formation. In addition to methoxyphenols, it’s worthwhile to note that p-CMA is the lowest functionalized monomer in the lignin macromolecule (Constant et al., 2016; Ponnusamy et al., 2019) and structural model of the end-group of lignin with a propanoid side chain and phenolic hydroxyl group, which was determined in wood smoke and the atmosphere (Nolte et al., 2001). Therefore, assessing the atmospheric behaviors of p-CMA can shed a light into the further investigation of the larger lignin combustion products and their derivatives in the environment, especially for the aromatic compounds with the same functional groups, such as sinapyl alcohols, methyl (E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acrylate, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4- (hydroxymethyl) phenol and so on (Zakzeski et al., 2010) (Fig. S1 of Supplementary material). Nowadays, the majority of publications of p-CMA emphasized on the biological and chemical implications, such as oxidizing peroxidases (Koutaniemi et al., 2005) and pyrolysis process (Xu et al., 2016), while the migration and transformation of p-CMA have not been well explored in the environment. Ozone is a promising oxidant of lignin, which has the additive activity to aromatic and unsaturated compounds. Moreover, the ozonolysis mechanisms of p-CMA are still unavailable. In this paper, the reaction mechanisms and kinetic parameters of ozone with p-CMA were investigated by using quantum chemistry calculations. It provides theoretical basis for the determination of free radical intermediates, the monitoring of reaction pathways and the elucidation of final products, which has been widely used in the field of atmospheric environment (Bao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2019a,). The free energy barriers ΔG ≠ (kcal/mol) and the reaction free energies ΔGr (kcal/mol) were calculated to predict the favorable energy path and dominant products in thermodynamics. The rate constants of the primary reaction were obtained at typical atmospheric pressure and temperature (198–338 K). The purpose of this study is to assess and track the transport process and final fate of p-CMA in the atmosphere."
1,Computational method,
2,Electronic structure calculations,"2.1 Electronic structure calculations All of the electronic structure calculations were carried out by employing the Gaussian 09 program. The geometries of all the reactants (R), transition states (TS), intermediates (IM) and products (P) were optimized at the M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p) level. Previous studies (Sun et al., 2019; Zhao and Truhlar, 2007) revealed that the M06–2X functional has reliable performance for the thermochemical and kinetic studies involving main-group elements. Single-point energies were performed at the same functional theory combined with a larger basis set 6-311 + G (3df, 2p). To determine the nature of the stationary points, the vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level. All transition states only have one imaginary frequency, whereas the intermediates are characterized with no imaginary vibrational frequency. Meanwhile, each transition state actually connects the corresponding reactant and product, which is identified by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC). The T1 diagnostics of the key transition states and intermediates were calculated in CCSD/6-311 + G (d,p) level to examine the multi-reference character of the delocalized aromatic systems in this study. Olivella et al. have found that the RCCSD(T) and CASPT2 results agreed reasonably when T1 diagnostics were less than 0.044 in their study on benzene oxidation (Olivella et al., 2009). For p-CMA with O3, the computed values of T1 diagnostic are in the range of 0.014–0.022 (Table S1 of Supplementary material), indicating a negligible multi-reference effects of the wave functions and reliable results of our calculations."
3,Rate constant calculations,"2.2 Rate constant calculations The rate coefficients of the preliminary reactions (Path1-Path7) were carried out by using the kinetic and statistical thermodynamic program (KiSThelP) (Canneaux et al., 2014), which is based on the transition state theory (TST) coupled with Wigner tunneling correction. k TST ( T ) = σ k b T h ( R T P 0 ) Δ n e - Δ G 0 , ‡ ( T ) k b T In the formula, σ, k b , h and T represent reaction path degeneracy, Boltzmann constant, Planck’s constant and temperature, successively. ΔG 0,‡(T) is the standard Gibbs free energy of activation. For unimolecular or bimolecular reactions, Δn is 0 or 1. RT/P 0 has the units of inverse concentration. To include quantum effects on reaction coordinate motion, the one-dimensional Wigner tunneling correction needs to be taken into account. The Wigner correction can be applied only based on the imaginary frequency of the transition state and is a decreasing function of temperature, which has been successfully applied to many high molecular mass reaction systems (An et al., 2019; Dang et al., 2019; Lei et al., 2019; ,b)."
4,Results and discussion,"The reliability of the theoretical calculations was confirmed. Due to the absence of experimental information on the thermochemical parameters for p-CMA, it is difficult to make a direct comparison of the calculated results with experimental data. Thus, we optimized the geometries and calculated vibrational frequencies of phenol, HCHO and H2O at the M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p) level. As shown in Table S2, the results show reasonable accordance with the available experimental values, and the relative deviation remains within 1.0% for the geometrical parameters and 8.0% for the vibrational frequencies (CCCBDB). Moreover, this method has been successfully employed to research the atmospheric oxidation reactions of 2,4,5-trimethylphenol, 1-chloronaphthalene and acetylacetone (Aazaad et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2018)."
5,Molecular structures of p-CMA,"3.1 Molecular structures of p-CMA Firstly, the possible molecular structures of p-CMA were investigated and discussed. Basin Hopping Monte Carlo (BHMC) conformational sampling and simulated annealing optimization were employed to produce all possible chemical geometries of p-CMA. After comparing and selecting, thirty-four potential conformations of p-CMA were obtained at the M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p) level. All the optimized geometries with their free energy barriers are displayed in Fig. S2. Based on the potential surface, the most stable configuration with the lowest free energy is R10 (Structure I). Its conformation is exhibited in Fig. 1 . The molecular structures of p-CMA have been optimized in previous study (Asatryan et al., 2019). Structure II (Fig. S3) is the most stable configuration they provided at ωB97XD/Def2TZVP level. In order to compare Structure II with Structure I, we have re-optimized p-CMA at M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p) level and obtained Structure III, based on the structural information of Structure II given by them. The comparison for Structure I and Structure III are plotted in Fig. S3. It is worth noting that Structure I and Structure III are almost the same, and the relative error of their thermodynamic data is less than 1.32 × 10−5%. Consequently, Structure I was selected in this study to explore the subsequent reactions."
6,The initial O3 addition reactions,"3.2 The initial O3 addition reactions The orientation of OH groups and propanoid side chain leads to the structural asymmetry of p-CMA, which has seven unique CC double bonds. Therefore, seven potential addition reaction pathways were considered. All the free energy barriers and reaction free energies are also displayed in Fig. 2 . Generally, ozonolysis of p-CMA occurs when two terminal O atoms of ozone are simultaneously added to two adjacent C atoms. Hence, the primary ozonides (POZs) with a five-membered ring are generated via corresponding transition states. Each transition state has two configurations due to the central O atom of ozone pointing to (endo-TS) or deviating from (exo-TS) the benzene ring. Previous literature (Barnum et al., 2012; , b) has proved that endo-TS presents more stable than exo-TS owing to the lower energy. Thus, the endo-TS was designated as the transition state of the O3-initial reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, the first step is ozone attacks to the CC double bond of the side chain forming a primary ozonide IM1 via transition state TS1, which is 56.96 kcal/mol lower in energy than the total energy of the original reactants (p-CMA + O3). And this process merely needs to conquer the barrier of 8.51 kcal/mol. Thermodynamic calculation shows that Path1 is likely to occur. Due to the orientation of center O atom of ozone and the positive and negative sides of benzene ring, the optimized geometries with respective thermodynamic parameters of four transition states (TS1, TS1a, TS1b, TS1c) and POZs (IM1, IM1a, IM1b, IM1c) involved in Path1 have been found and exhibited in Fig. S4. Calculation indicates that the structures of TS1 and IM1 are used to represent Path1 and proceed for subsequent calculations. As exhibited in Fig. 2(a), the bond lengths of C7–O3 and C8–O5 in TS1 are 2.377 and 2.291 Å, which are longer by 65.99% and 61.34% than that in IM1 (1.432 and 1.420 Å), respectively. Ozone could directly react with the benzene ring of p-CMA to generate POZs (IM2-IM7), as provided in Fig. 2. The structures of these transition states (TS2-TS7) are displayed in Fig. S5. IRC calculation confirmed that in these primary addition pathways, each transition state actually connects the corresponding reactants and POZ. The free energy barriers of Path2-Path7 are 19.37, 21.93, 21.03, 22.29, 21.45 and 21.04 kcal/mol, respectively. All the addition reactions of ozone with p-CMA are highly exothermic. The released heat successively are 25.01, 22.38, 20.74, 17.98, 24.12 and 23.05 kcal/mol. Obviously, Path1 is the most favorable channel, which implies a dominant reactivity of the propenoid side chain during the ozonolysis of p-CMA. Additionally, for the six addition pathways in benzene ring, Path2 is more advantageous than others (Path3-Path7), which can be well interpreted as the formation of the shortest intramolecular hydrogen bonds (2.597 Å) in this process. Another possible explanation is the function of the electron-donating substituents, such as OH group. It enhances the density of the electron cloud at C1, promoting them easier to be attacked by ozone. Therefore, C1 is more prone to react with ozone, compared with the other five carbon atoms (C2–C6). However, the five-membered ring with two O–O bonds of different lengths tends to undergo ring-cleavage process. Each POZ (IM1-IM7) has a greater inclination to bifurcate into two different and excited Criegee intermediates. For instance, the Criegee intermediates IM8 and IM9 are generated by the ring-cleavage of IM1, and TS8 and TS9 are corresponding transition states confirmed by IRC. As described in Fig. 2, the free energy barriers of forming IM8 and IM9 are 25.94 and 23.22 kcal/mol, and the corresponding exothermic energies are 14.51 and 21.91 kcal/mol, respectively. From the above analysis, IM9 is more favorable than IM8 due to the lower barrier and higher exothermic value. Hence, Criegee intermediate IM9 is the most principal in decomposition of all POZs. Fig. 3 intuitively exhibits potential energy surfaces for primary addition reaction pathways of p-CMA with ozone."
7,Further reactions of Criegee intermediate IM9,"3.3 Further reactions of Criegee intermediate IM9 In the atmosphere, these excited Criegee intermediates may undergo bimolecular reactions with NOx, COx and some typical free radicals, or experience unimolecular reactions, such as isomerization. Based on the above conclusion, the Criegee intermediate IM9 was selected as representative to discuss the subsequent reactions. The reaction mechanisms of ozone with IM8, IM10-IM21 are similar to that of IM9. The detailed description with respect to the further reactions of IM9 will be provided as follows. 3.3.1 Reactions of IM9 with NOx As an energy-wise Criegee intermediate, IM9 is expected to preferentially react with NOx to form more stable products. Fig. 4 exhibits two typical reaction patterns: O atom abstraction and NOx addition. The first two pathways are O-abstraction. The O3 atom of IM9 is extracted by the NO and NO2 molecules respectively, resulting in the formation of common product, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1). NO2 and NO3 molecules represent the respective product. The first pathway has a potential barrier of 24.37 kcal/mol and releases 64.28 kcal/mol of energy, whereas the free energy barrier and reaction free energy are 20.47 and −37.93 kcal/mol, respectively in the second pathway. The remaining four reaction pathways are NOx addition. In the third pathway, the N atom of NO is connected to the C7 atom with single electron to form a new intermediate IM9-3, with the free energy barrier of 17.53 kcal/mol and absorbing heat of 5.98 kcal/mol. Then, IM9-3 will undergo two kinds of cyclization to produce P2 and IM9-3b, respectively. IM9-3b can add water accompanied with the elimination of hydroxyl group to generate P3. These subsequent pathways are endothermic with moderate energy barriers, which are not easy to occur. In addition, the fourth and fifth pathways are the addition of one O or N atom of NO2 to C7 atom respectively, and proceed a cascade of follow-up pathways: cyclization and dehydroxylation reaction. The last reaction pathway is that one O and N atoms of NO2 are concurrently added to C7 and O3 atoms of IM9, realizing the ring-closure process with a barrier of 24.47 kcal/mol. In the end, the process of eliminating hydroxyl group from IM9-6 to produce P6 needs to conquer the free energy barrier of 52.15 kcal/mol and absorb the large heat of 41.91 kcal/mol. From Fig. 4, we can see that the primary reactions of Criegee intermediate IM9 with NOx are relatively easy, whereas the subsequent routes are difficult. 3.3.2 Reactions of IM9 with other small molecules O3-adduct (IM9) could react with other small molecules, such as COx, SO2 and O2 in the atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 5 . Firstly, the C atom of the CO molecule attacks IM9 triggering the cleavage of O2–O3 bond, which involves the generation of P1 with the lower barrier (22.23 kcal/mol) and strong exothermicity (120.43 kcal/mol). Secondly, the C7 and O3 atoms in the IM9 are respectively connected to one O and C atoms of CO2 for generating 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-one (P7). The ring-closure process has the free energy barrier of 16.94 kcal/mol and releases 13.93 kcal/mol of heat. Similarly, the O and S atoms of SO2 also are expected to add at IM9. PTS9-9, as a pre-reactive complex, lies at 16.89 kcal/mol lower than the total energy of reactants. The formation channel of IM9-9a releases 16.91 kcal/mol with the lower barrier of 1.44 kcal/mol. Then IM9-9a could decompose into P1 and SO3, which has a 28.06 kcal/mol free energy of activation and is exothermic (55.44 kcal/mol). These reaction pathways are likely to occur. Additionally, the surrounding O2 molecules could also associate two atoms (C7 and O3) in IM9, leading to generate IM9-10. This pathway is barrierless with the exothermicity of 29.80 kcal/mol. Hence, it has sufficient energy to generate P1 and O3 through subsequent fracture process. Moreover, the C7 and O3 atoms of IM9 stimulated the CO double bond of P1 to break and connected the O and C atoms of P1 respectively, which is consequence of the formation of 4,4’-(1,2,4-trioxolane-3,5-diyl) diphenol (P8). The occurrence of this pathway requires 8.66 kcal/mol of barrier and releases 35.41 kcal/mol of heat. This reaction is easy to take place. Besides, two pathways of reacting with aldehydes (HCHO, CH2OHCHO) created two products, P9 and P10. The free energy barrier for the formation of P9 is 13.07 kcal/mol, and this pathway is intensely exothermic with an enthalpy of 26.83 kcal/mol. In the reaction process of IM9 with CH2OHCHO, PTS9-13 lies at 14.23 kcal/mol lower the energy of total reactants. For P10, the free energy of activation is 8.31 kcal/mol, releasing an enthalpy of 32.18 kcal/mol. The last pathway is one H atom of H2O molecule to touch with the O3 atom of IM9, meanwhile the residual OH group of H2O connects to C7 atom. It releases 27.30 kcal/mol of heat with a barrier of 15.87 kcal/mol, which is likely to carry out. IM9-14 is unstable which tends to proceed the further reactions, including the elimination of H2O and CO2. However the follow-up steps are hard to occur under usual atmospheric conditions because of the high barrier (52.64 and 61.52 kcal/mol). 3.3.3 Reactions of IM9 with some typical free radicals In the atmosphere, peroxy radical intermediates potentially react with some typical free radicals, such as hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2·), chlorine atoms (Cl) and hydroxyl radicals (OH·), as plotted in Fig. 6 . The reaction pathway of IM9 with HO2· involves in the generation of a pre-reactive complex, PTS9-15. It lies 5.50 kcal/mol below the original reactants. And it can release O2 and OH group to produce P1. The occurrence of this pathway needs to overcome 4.48 kcal/mol of energy and release 12.86 kcal/mol of heat. Moreover, IM9-15b is generated passing through the transition state TS9-15b, followed by one-step reaction containing both HO2-addition and O2-elimination. The first step has an activation barrier height of 13.64 kcal/mol and exothermic of 24.27 kcal/mol. Then, the calculated free energy barrier and reaction free energy of following step are 37.84 and 33.27 kcal/mol, respectively. Similar to the reaction mechanism of IM9 with HO2·, the reaction free energies and free energies of activation of IM9 with amino molecules (NH2), peroxy radical (CH3OO·), methoxy (CH3O·), chlorine atoms (Cl) and hydroxyl radicals (OH·) were calculated. There are no pre-reactive complexes in the first three paths, while the pre-reactive complexes in the last two paths, PTS9-19 and PTS9-20, lie 9.29 and 1.58 kcal/mol below corresponding reactants, respectively. These five addition processes have the lower barriers of 4.23–13.37 kcal/mol and larger exothermicity of 28.21–58.61 kcal/mol. The reaction pathways of adding to HO2 group and eliminating O2 are endothermic by 30.92–33.67 kcal/mol with the higher energy barriers of 35.53–39.27 kcal/mol. These processes are not easy to reach the reaction conditions under general atmospheric conditions. 3.3.4 Isomerization reactions of IM9 Isomerization reactions of IM9 are exhibited in Fig. 7 . Owing to the existence of an unpaired electron on C7 and O3 atoms, IM9 could proceed ring-closure pathway to form IM9-21 with a three-membered ring composed of C7–O2, C7–O3 and O2–O3 bonds. This process needs to surpass 18.03 kcal/mol free energy of activation and release 22.28 kcal/mol of heat. However, IM9-21 is unstable, which can experience further reactions, including rearrangement, self-decomposition and the reaction with NO molecule. The main products of these subsequent processes are phenol, 4-hydroxyphenyl formate (P17), benzoquinone (P18), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1), but except for the formation channel of P1, the remaining reaction pathways are difficult to occur under normal atmospheric conditions owing to the high energy barriers. Additionally, the H atom has a tendency from C7 atom at IM9 transferring the peroxy radical to form OOH group, resulting in the formation of IM9-22. The free energy barrier and endothermic energy of this channel are 30.51 and 9.79 kcal/mol. IM9-22 is easily attacked by O2 for the diradical to form IM9-22a, which is a barrierless reaction and releases a larger heat of 62.29 kcal/mol. The following pathway is to render the ring-closure reaction of IM9-22a for obtaining P19, which releases 24.30 kcal/mol with the free energy barrier of 10.56 kcal/mol. These processes are likely to carry out."
8,Subsequent ozonolysis mechanism of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1),"3.4 Subsequent ozonolysis mechanism of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1) After the above analysis and discussion, P1 is the most dominant product in the further reactions of Criegee intermediate IM9. However, ozone and P1 can continue to react because the six different and unsaturated CC double bonds of P1. Therefore, six diverse addition routes and specific thermodynamic data are displayed in Fig. S6. For the addition reactions of P1 with ozone, the activation energies are calculated to be in the range of 21.33–24.41 kcal/mol, and the released reaction enthalpy is 14.78–23.02 kcal/mol. In particular, the formation channel of IMP6 is more favorable than others (IMP1-IMP5) for the function of OH group, which is in agreement with p-CMA. In contrast, the formation channel of IMP3 is the hardest to occur, which may be owing to an electron withdrawing group, CHO group. For decomposition routes of all POZs (IMP1-IMP6), the reaction channel of passing through transition state TSP1a is most optimal, which merely needs to surpass the lowest barrier of 20.15 kcal/mol and release larger heat of 26.15 kcal/mol. Hence, Criegee intermediate IMP1a is the most dominant. What’s more, referencing the thermodynamical data of the further reactions of IM9, four typical reaction pathways were designated to explore the process of stabilization of IMP1a. (2Z, 4E)-4-formyl-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoic acid (IMP7) is predicted to be the most favorable product for ozonation processes of P1, as demonstrated in Fig. S7."
9,Kinetic calculations,"3.5 Kinetic calculations 3.5.1 Rate constants Recently, KiSThelP software package has been widely used in the dynamic calculation of atmospheric environment (An et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019a,; Dang et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2017). Therefore, the overall and individual rate constants of ozone with p-CMA were calculated by using the KiSThelP program. Specifically, we defined k i (i = 1 … 7) as the individual rate constant of seven pathways for ozone initiated reactions of p-CMA. For instance, the rate coefficient of Path1 is denoted k 1 and so on. k tot is the total rate constant, where k tot = Ʃk i (i = 1 … 7). The specific kinetic parameters and correction coefficients of Path1-Path7 are tabulated in Tables S3–S10. The total and individual rate constants between 198 and 338 K and 1 atm are plotted in Fig. 8 . Go in detail, k 1 is significantly greater than that of others (k 2 -k 7 ), and extremely close to the total rate coefficient, k tot . Path1 is the fastest in good agreement with the thermodynamic calculation results. Besides, k 2 -k 7 have the positive temperature dependence between 198 and 338 K and atmospheric pressure. As illustrated in Fig. 8, k tot is 3.37 × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 298 K and 1 atm. However, the rate coefficients of p-CMA with ozone have not been introduced in previous studies. It’s remarkable that styrene and indene are similar to p-CMA in structure, and their reaction constants of ozonolysis have been measured. The rate coefficients for ozonolysis of styrene approximately at 298 K and atmospheric pressure are (1.71 ± 0.18) × 10−17, 7.9 × 10−17, (1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively (Tuazon et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1994; Le Person et al., 2008). Additionally, the rate constant of ozone with indene is (1.7 ± 0.5) × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 (Kwok et al., 1997). Hence, our calculated rate coefficients of p-CMA with O3 are reasonable. 3.5.2 Atmospheric implications To assess the implications of ozone on phenolic compounds generated by lignin pyrolysis, the atmospheric lifetime of p-CMA can be concluded from the total rate constant and the concentrations of ozone. The formula of atmospheric lifetime is provided as follows: τ O 3 = 1 k t o t [ O 3 ] where k tot represents the total rate constant of p-CMA with O3, [O3] is the typical atmospheric ozone concentration of 7 × 1011 molecules cm−3. Combining with above parameters and kinetics data, the corresponding lifetime of p-CMA is 1.18 h at 298 K and 1 atm. Likewise, the atmospheric implications of p-CMA are also insufficient. However, the lifetime of coniferyl alcohol with OH radicals can be used for a reference (Liu et al., 2020). Under different temperature and RH conditions, the OH-determined lifetime of coniferyl alcohol was calculated to be 13.5 ± 0.4 h to 22.9 ± 1.4 h when the 24 h average OH radical concentration is 1.5 × 106 molecules cm−3. The lifetime of p-CMA with ozone is obviously shorter than that of coniferyl alcohol initiated by OH. This signifies that atmospheric implications of ozone molecules on p-CMA may be no less than that of OH radicals and ozonolysis of p-CMA cannot be neglected."
10,Conclusion,"p-CMA is one of the three major monomers of lignin and a representative phenolic compound. The gas-phase reaction mechanisms of p-CMA with ozone were performed at the M06–2X/6-311 + G (3df, 2p)//M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p) level and the rate coefficients of primary reaction pathways were calculated by KiSThelP program. Several important conclusions are as follows: (1) Seven primary addition reaction pathways for ozonolysis of p-CMA were summarized due to the addition of O3 to the unsaturated CC double bond. To begin with, POZs (IM1-IM7) are produced by the cycloaddition reaction of p-CMA with ozone, and then each POZ undergoes ring-cleavage route to generate two different Criegee intermediates. In particular, the formation channel of IM1 is most favorable with the lowest activation barrier height and the highest exothermicity. And the formation of IM9 is expected to be more preferred than others (IM8, IM10-IM21) in the decomposition routes of POZs. (2) Criegee intermediate IM9 was selected as representative to explore the subsequent degradation pathways. Twenty-two potential reaction pathways were considered. These processes mainly included reacting with some small molecules, such as NOx, COx and some typical free radicals, its own isomerization, rearrangement and decomposition. p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1) is the most predominant product. Other main predicted products are 4,4’-(1,2,4-trioxolane-3,5-diyl) diphenol (P8), 4-(1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl) phenol (P9) and 4-(5-(hydroxymethyl)-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl) phenol (P10) etc from calculations. (3) The reaction pathways of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (P1) with ozone are similar to ozonation mechanisms of p-CMA. For ozonolysis of P1, the channel via transition state TSP1 is more favorable than others (TSP2-TSP6) and IMP1 is most dominant. During all the ring-cleavages reactions, the formation of IMP1a is most advantageous. It can be inferred from the further reaction processes of IM9 that (2Z, 4E)-4-formyl-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoic acid (IMP7) is the thermodynamically most superior product in the subsequent reaction of IMP1a. (4) The overall and individual reaction constants over the range of 198–338 K and 1 atm were obtained, in which the total rate coefficient of O3 with p-CMA at 298 K is calculated to be 3.37 × 10–16 cm3 molecule-1 s-1. Comparing with the measured results of styrene and indene with ozone, the rate constants we determined are reliable. In addition, Path1 dominates the total reaction, which is in marked agreement with the findings of thermodynamic calculation. Moreover, the atmospheric lifetime of p-CMA is 1.18 h according to the above kinetic data. This implies that atmospheric implications of ozone on p-CMA cannot be neglected. These conclusions presented in this paper may provide a model for future research work. It is important to study the ozone degradation pathway of p-CMA in the atmosphere to remove these compounds and to better understand the formation of secondary organic aerosols."
