0,Introduction,"Recently, concerns regarding carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and their impact on the Earth’s climate have been growing, not only among the scientific community but also in the general population. As a consequence, the Kyoto protocol and other international agreements have been signed to secure an international commitment to reduce the global CO2 emissions [1]. Therefore, efforts for reducing these emissions has led to an increase in research for new technologies, not only for new ways of converting fossil fuels that would allow for CO2 capture and storage but also for the generation of alternative fuels to replace traditional fuels in thermal engines and boilers, for instance, with lower contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the increasing interest in replacing fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, such as alternative and non-traditional fuels, are subjects of great interest around the world, although their use is still a challenge in both practical and modeled combustion systems. Renewable energy sources include materials that supply energy without depleting their supply and are considered environmentally friendly when used in thermochemical conversion technologies [2]. Currently, there is great interest in the use of hydrogen as a fuel, especially in high-efficiency systems such as fuel cells, and its application in the transportation sector. With pure hydrogen, a fuel cell vehicle is a true “zero emission” vehicle, producing only water as a by-product. Moreover, hydrogen has the benefit of improving the security of fuel supplies because it can be produced from diverse primary energy sources, such as hydrocarbons, biomass, water, or solar energy [3]. Hydrogen appears, therefore, to be a panacea for the global energy crisis and many environmental problems. H2 is, however, an energy carrier, not an energy source. Although it is found naturally in hydrogen-rich compounds, it cannot be extracted in the same way as natural gas or oil; it needs to be recovered by applying energy. Conventional industrial hydrogen production methods, such as the steam reforming of methane and partial oxidation of fossil fuels, are energy intensive and require high temperatures (>850°C), resulting in the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants as by-products [4]. Under these circumstances, biological hydrogen production from a renewable substrate appears to be a promising way to replace traditional methods, as it can produce hydrogen cheaply under ambient conditions without adding pollution to the environment [5,6]. Consequently, in the last few years, biohydrogen has become a hot topic, which is impressively demonstrated by the large number of investigations published to address this issue. Current industrial practices have led to the generation of an enormous amount of crude fatty materials as waste, and these materials are difficult to treat and valorize [7]. One such material is tallow from slaughterhouses, food industry and meat industry waste. Like vegetable oils, tallow is a triglyceride (Fig. 1 ). A triglyceride consists of a three-carbon glycerol head groups (shown in blue) conjugated to three fatty acid chains [8]. All triglycerides have the same basic structure, and the differences in properties and use of commercial triglycerides depends entirely on the length, degree of unsaturation and other chemical modifications to the fatty acid chains [8]. The main constituents of tallow are fatty acids, including saturated (sum of palmitic, C16:0, and stearic, C18:0, acid) and unsaturated (sum of oleic, C18:1, linoleic, C18:2, and linolenic, C18:3, acid) acids, and triglycerides [9,10]. C18:0 represents a fatty acid with 18 carbons and no double bonds. C18:1 has 18 carbon atoms and one double bond. These distributions are important because they define the applications for which the oils and fats are most suitable [8]. In the last years considerable attention has been paid to steam and dry reforming studies on synthesis gas production from vegetable oil. Marquevich et al. [11] studied hydrogen production via steam reforming of sunflower oil over Ni/Al catalysts from hydrotalcite materials and compared it with two commercial catalysts for hydrocarbons steam reforming. They concluded that nickel-based catalysts prepared from hydrotalcite precursors are promising catalysts for steam reforming of vegetable oils and may be interesting for producing hydrogen from other biomass-derived feedstocks like fast-pyrolysis oils or ethanol. Dupont et al. [12] investigated a novel process of hydrogen production called unmixed steam reforming (USR) using methane and sunflower oil fuels. They showed that USR process relies on two mass transfer materials which operate on a two-step cycle: an oxygen transfer material (OTM) which provides the heat necessary for the steam reforming reaction, and a CO2 sorbent which shifts the water gas reaction yielding a hydrogen-rich reformate gas. According to them, the thermal decomposition of the fuel played a significant role in the early hydrogen production concurrent with coking conditions, by causing the OTM to initially reduce. Further investigation of hydrogen production via vegetable oil reforming was reported by Yenumala al. [13]. The authors conducted a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of steam reforming and autothermal steam reforming of vegetable oils to synthesis gas. The effects of various parameters of reforming reactions on hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane was studied. Many researchers have reported the use of animal fats, such us beef tallow (BT), as a substrate for the production of biodiesel and glycerin via the transesterification process [14–17]. Biodiesel fuels produced from tallow and vegetable oils have comparable compositions [18]. However, there are some differences; the main one is that the tallow-based biodiesel (TBD) contains more saturated fatty esters [18]. Tallow as a biodiesel feedstock has some advantages and disadvantages. TBD has a higher cetane number than plant oil biodiesel, which means that TBD is cleaner and burns more efficiently in diesel engines [8]. However, tallow biodiesel has a higher cloud point because of the high levels of saturated fatty acids. Its higher cloud point means that tallow biodiesel tends to crystallize out at low temperatures, creating problems in engines. Used pure (100%) tallow biodiesel would not meet the European standards. However, when blended at 5% into conventional diesel, the mixture meets the relevant fuel quality standards [19]. With increased production of cattle, especially in India and China, an excess of tallow is expected to appear on the world market. The total world production of cattle carcasses is annually estimated at 57 million tons and contains 10% fat [20,21]. Therefore, it is essential to find useful applications for renewable and cheap tallow. We believe that tallow is a promising feedstock for producing hydrogen because the oxygen content is low and the potential yield of hydrogen is high. Moreover, tallow is a promising alternative for renewable hydrogen production due to the highly centralized generation in slaughter processing facilities and historically low prices; this may have energy, environmental, and economic advantages that could be exploited. Hydrogen obtained from tallow has been proposed to be a low-risk end use for tallow from livestock that are removed from the food chain [22,23]. However, the thermodynamic equilibrium investigation of tallow has not been considered in the past because of its complex chemical structure and the unavailability of physical and chemical properties. Thermodynamic equilibrium investigation is an important tool to obtain equilibrium products composition and identify thermodynamically favorable operating conditions of the process. It is an aid in reactor modeling, in examining kinetic schemes or reaction mechanisms, and in identifying rate-controlling processes [24]. This paper intends to identify thermodynamically favorable operating conditions at which beef tallow may be converted to hydrogen via the steam reforming (SR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) processes. The synthesis gas composition was determined by simulations to minimize the Gibbs free energy using the Aspen Plus™ 10.2 software (Aspen Technology, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA)."
1,Modeling and simulation methodology,
2,Beef tallow characterization,"2.1 Beef tallow characterization Table 1 gives the typical fatty acid composition of the beef tallow considered in this work. For simplicity of analysis, the beef tallow is considered as a mixture of triglycerides with the same three fatty acid groups in their backbone. Moreover, trimyristin, tripalmitin, tristearin, tripalmitoleic, trioleate, trilinolein and trilinolenic are not included in the Aspen Plus™ databank; they needed to be added before the simulation could be started. This operation required various data, such as the chemical structure, normal boiling point, molecular weight, temperature-dependent vapor pressures and heat capacity, standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of these compounds, to be inserted into the Aspen Plus™ dialog box [26]. Considering the low level of some triglycerides and the difficulty to achieve all required regression data, the study presented here ignores compounds having a composition less than 5%. The beef tallow is assumed to be, in weight percent, 30% tripalmitin, 20% tristearin and 50% trioleate. Main components and average molecular composition of beef tallow are depicted in Table 2 . All required data for regression of property method were obtained from different literature sources [13,27,28] and were given in Table 3 ."
3,Minimization of the Gibbs free energy,"2.2 Minimization of the Gibbs free energy Equilibrium compositions were calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy within the environment of Aspen Plus™. The R-Gibbs reactor [26] has been selected for the calculations using the UNIF-LBY equation of state. Gibbs free energy is the most commonly used function to identify the equilibrium state. For a system with multiple species and phases, equilibrium calculations can be performed through the Gibbs-energy minimization method. The total Gibbs free energy (Gt ) of a system is given by Eq. (1) (1) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i ¯ = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i 0 + R T ∑ i = 1 N n i ln f i f i 0 where G i ¯ is the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species i, Gi 0 is the standard Gibbs free energy, μi is the chemical potential, R is the molar gas constant, T is the temperature of system, P is the pressure of system, fi is the fugacity in system, fi 0 is the standard-state fugacity and ni is the moles of species i. For reaction equilibrium in the gas phase f i = y i φ i ¯ P , f i 0 = P 0 and G i 0 = Δ G f i 0 The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed by Eqs. (2) and (3) respectively, with the Lagrange’s undetermined multiplier method. (2) Δ G f i 0 + R T ln y i φ i ¯ P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (3) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln y i φ i ¯ P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 where P 0 is the standard-state pressure of 101.3kPa, ΔGfi 0 is the standard Gibbs function of formation of species i, yi is the gas phase mole fraction, φ i ¯ is the fugacity coefficient of species i, aik is the number of atoms of the kth element present in each molecule of species i, λk is the Lagrange multiplier and Ak is the total mass of kth element in the feed. With the constraint of the element balance equation: (4) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = 0 When solid carbon (graphite) is involved in the system, exploitation of the vapor–solid phase equilibrium is applied to the Gibbs-energy of carbon as shown in Eq. (5). Substituting Eq. (1) by Eq. (2) for gaseous species and by Eq. (5) for solid species gives the minimization function of Gibbs-energy as shown in Eq. (6): (5) G ¯ C ( g ) = G ¯ C ( s ) = G C ( s ) ≅ Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 (6) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln y i φ i ¯ P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) + ( n c Δ G f C ( s ) 0 ) = 0 where G ¯ C ( s ) , G ¯ C ( g ) , G C ( s ) , Δ G f C ( s ) 0 and nc are the partial molar Gibbs free energy of solid carbon, the partial molar Gibbs free energy of gaseous carbon, the molar Gibbs free energy of solid carbon, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of solid carbon, and moles of carbon, respectively. The primary species involved in BT reforming are CO2, H2O, CO, H2, CH4, C(graphite), tripalmitin (C51H98O6), tristearin (C57H110O6), trioleate (C57H104O6), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propylene (C3H6), propane (C3H8), n-butane (C4H10), isobutane (C4H10), 1-butene (C4H8), 2-cis-butene (C4H8), 2-trans-butene (C4H8), isobutylene (C4H8), methanol (CH4O),formaldehyde (CH2O), ethanol (C2H6O), methanol (CH4O), formaldehyde (CH2O), acetaldehyde (C2H4O), acetic acid (C2H4O2), acetone (C3H6O), glycerol (C3H8O3), acrolein (C3H4O), n-butanol (C4H10O), methyl ethyl ketone, and allyl alcohol (C3H6O)."
4,Hydrogen production by beef tallow reforming,
5,Steam reforming (SR),"3.1 Steam reforming (SR) SR is an endothermic reaction in which the substrate is treated with steam in the presence of a catalyst to produce synthesis gas (SG). The steam reforming of an oxygenated hydrocarbon, such BT, involves a complex reaction system, with undesired reaction paths [29]. The key reactions concerned in the reforming process are as follows. (7) C 55.08 H 103.24 O 6 + 49.08 H 2 O ↔ 55.08 CO + 100.7 H 2 Δ H 298 K ° = 10.07 MJ / mol Water gas shift (WGS): (8) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 Δ H 298 K ° = − 41.17 kJ / mol Methanation: (9) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K ° = − 206.11 kJ / mol (10) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K ° = − 164 . 94 kJ / mol Methane CO2 reforming: (11) CO 2 + CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + 2 CO Δ H 298 K ° = 247.28 kJ / mol Carbon formation: (12) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C Δ H 298 K ° = − 172.43 kJ / mol (13) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + C Δ H 298 K ° = 74.85 kJ / mol (14) CO + H 2 ↔ C + H 2 O Δ H 298 K ° = − 131.26 kJ / mol (15) C 55.08 H 103.24 O 6 + 104.16 H 2 O ↔ 55.08 CO 2 + 155.78 H 2 Δ H 298 K ° = 7.80 MJ / mol This overall reaction (Eq. (15)) is endothermic and requires a large amount of external heat. The equilibrium composition of the SG depends on the reformer temperature (T) and pressure (P), as well as the initial composition of the BT steam mixture expressed by the steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C). The S/C ratio is given by Eq. (16) [13]. (16) Steam - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of steam moles of BT ) / ( moles of steam moles of BT ) stoichiometric = ( moles of steam ) 104.16 × ( moles of BT ) This investigation was performed at atmospheric pressure because previous investigations of SR of oxygenated hydrocarbons have already shown that higher pressures are thermodynamically unfavorable [30,31]. The increase in pressure shifts the equilibrium towards the reactants in the overall hydrogen forming reactions (Eq. (15)). Carbon monoxide methanation increases with an increase in pressure, which results in increased methane selectivity and negatively affects the hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields [32]."
6,Autothermal reforming (ATR),"3.2 Autothermal reforming (ATR) Autothermal reforming has been suggested to ameliorate the difficulties of steam reforming. Specifically, autothermal reformation overcomes the steam reformation limitations of high temperature operations and fast dynamic responses. Additionally, an autothermal reformer can reduce the size, weight, start-up, shut-down, and other dynamic response times [33,34]. Autothermal reforming combines POX and SR in a single process. The POX reaction is exothermic (i.e., it produces heat), while a SR reaction is endothermic, and heat must be generated externally for the reforming process. Typically, ATR reactions are considered to be thermally self-sustaining and consequently do not produce or consume external thermal energy. The main chemical reaction for POX of BT is given by Eq. (17). (17) C 55.08 H 103.24 O 6 + 24.54 O 2 ↔ 55.08 CO + 51.62 H 2 Δ H 298 K ° = − 3.95 MJ / mol The overall reaction of ATR can be expressed as Eq. (18), a combination of SR and POX. (18) C 55.08 H 103.24 O 6 + a O 2 + b H 2 O ↔ c CO + d CO 2 + e H 2 + f CH 4 + g C The stoichiometric coefficients (a–g) depend on the reformer temperature (T), pressure (P), (S/C) ratio and the oxygen to carbon molar ratio (O/C). The O/C ratio is given by Eq. (19) [13]. (19) Oxygen - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of oxygen moles of BT ) / ( moles of oxygen moles of BT ) stoichiometric = ( moles of oxygen ) 24.54 × ( moles of BT ) The oxygen source can be either pure oxygen or air. In the present work, pure oxygen was considered for thermodynamic equilibrium investigation since using air as oxygen-carrier increases the nitrogen-content in the reformer effluent strongly. However it would an interesting issue to determine whether using air instead of pure oxygen could improve hydrogen production. It is well known that pure oxygen increases significantly production costs."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Beef tallow: thermodynamically possible products,"4.1 Beef tallow: thermodynamically possible products BT reforming involves a complex reaction system with undesired reaction paths. Main reforming products are H2, CH4, CO2, CO and H2O. Depending on the catalyst employed and the completeness of conversion, the product distributions in the synthesis gas may be different than described above. In this paper, equilibrium compositions were calculated by the minimization of the Gibbs free energy with the aid of the Aspen Plus™ software. This code requires identification of the possible products that might be generated as intermediates or products from side reactions [26]. Therefore, the standard product set was expanded to include these possible products. The expanded product set is given in Table 4 . Table 4 shows that triglycerides are fully converted and the concentrations of ethane, ethylene, acetylene and other oxygenated compounds in the product stream can be considered as thermodynamically unstable products and are therefore negligible. These compounds are formed by thermal cracking and are also converted through SR reaction. However, their possible occurrence in experimental work is because the reforming reactions are in practice under kinetic control [29]. Therefore, the component list for further thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is restricted to CO, CO2, H2, CH4, H2O and C(graphite)."
9,Coke formation,"4.2 Coke formation Coke formation during the catalytic steam reforming could lead to the deactivation of catalysts, resulting in low durability and activity [35,36]. Operating the reforming system (SR and ATR) under the coke-free regions could avoid coke formation. Coke formation was, consequently, investigated to determine the coke-formed and coke-free regions. Fig. 2 illustrates the coke formation (kg C/kg BT) as a function of reforming temperature for different S/C operating conditions. There is a great potential for coke formation for an S/C ratio of 0.25, for all reforming temperatures investigated. At a given temperature, an increase in the S/C lowered the amount of coke formed; for S/C ratios higher than 1, no coke can be formed at temperatures above 300°C. Otherwise, at low S/C ratios, coke formation plot does not show a monotone behavior but two regions with strong coke formation. This can be explained by the competition between the different coke formation reactions (Eqs. (12)–(14)). In fact, these reactions are in equilibrium and the formation of coke via exothermic reactions (Eqs. (12)–(14)) becomes less favored as the temperature increases whereas coke formation via endothermic reaction (Eq. (13)) becomes increasingly important at higher temperature. Therefore, the peak of coking formation (at about 550°C), shown in Fig. 2, is a result of the competition between carbon deposition and carbon elimination in the whole temperature range. For a given S/C ratio, the temperature at which the first disappearance of carbon solid (T CD) was achieved, was considered to be the carbon boundary. The regions above and below the boundary are the coke-free and coke-formed regions, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the coke formation is avoided by increasing the reactor temperature and/or the S/C ratio. The competition between the different coke formation reactions, described above, causes the peak of coking formation (at about 550°C) and makes the coke-formed region wide at temperature around 550°C (Fig. 3). The coke formation behavior in the case of ATR has been evaluated. Fig. 4 shows the temperature of the coke formation boundary for different S/C ratios over different O/C ratios. For a given temperature, coke formation is suppressed by the increase of the O/C ratio and/or the increase of the S/C ratio. Moreover, high temperatures and a high S/C ratio inhibit coke formation. As an example, avoidance of coke formation is possible for S/C ratios higher than 1 and with temperatures above 300°C."
10,Beef tallow steam reforming,"4.3 Beef tallow steam reforming The influences of the S/C ratio and the reforming temperature on the equilibrium products of steam reforming of BT are shown in Fig. 5a–d. Fig. 5a shows the amount of hydrogen produced (moles H2/kg BT) as a function of the S/C ratio and temperature. The amount of hydrogen produced at temperatures below 500°C is relatively low compared to that at 700°C. The hydrogen yield increases with increasing temperature, reaches a maximum, and then decreases slightly. This behavior is the result of inhibition of the exothermic WGS and methanation reactions. Thus, the SR (Eq. (15)) reaction is endothermic and the equilibrium shifts towards the product side with increasing temperature, resulting in increased hydrogen yield. The WGS (Eq. (8)) and methanation (Eqs. (9) and (10)) reactions are exothermic, and the equilibrium shifts towards the reactant side (consumption of hydrogen) with increasing temperature. Fig. 5b and c show that at low temperatures, methane and carbon dioxide are the most prevalent products with almost no carbon monoxide. At higher temperatures (T >800°C), the carbon monoxide content strongly increases, which can be attributed to the thermodynamics of the WGS (Eq. (8)) reaction, whereas the methane content is lower. Aiming, simultaneously, for a high H2 content and a low CO content is a contradiction because the reforming temperature has to be high enough to obtain a reasonable H2 concentration, whereas the reforming temperature has to be as low as possible to minimize the CO content. Taking into account all of the aforementioned considerations, reforming temperatures ranging from 800°C to 900°C appear to be reasonable for preeminent BT steam reforming. The H2 productivity increases as the S/C ratio increases from 1 to 15 (Fig. 5a). This behavior is consistent with Le Chatelier’s Principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the operating conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts to counteract the change. With an increase in S/C, the number of moles of water on the reactant side of Eqs. (7) and (8) increases, and hence the equilibrium of SR and water gas shift reaction (WGS) shifts towards the products side, resulting in increased hydrogen yield. The gain in hydrogen productivity is not significant for values of the S/C ratio above 5, whereas the reaction system consumes excessive amounts of water. As observed from the Fig. 5b, the CO content decreases slightly with an increasing S/C ratio because of an increase in the WGS reaction with S/C. For hydrogen production, it is apparent that CH4 is not a desirable product because the formation of CH4 competes with H2 production. Fortunately, at a given temperature, the methane content decreases as the S/C ratio increases. This effect is mostly appreciable at low temperatures due to the endothermic aspect of methane reforming reaction, which is favored by increasing S/C ratios. In conclusion, for steam reforming of BT, favorable operating conditions can be ensured by the proper combination of reactor temperature and S/C ratio. The synthesis gas composition that maximizes hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and without forming coke can be achieved at reforming temperatures between 700°C and 900°C and an S/C ratio of approximately 5. Table 5 gives the synthesis gas composition at the optimum conditions for a BT steam reforming reactor. Under thermodynamic optimum conditions, a hydrogen yield of 170moles/kg beef tallow can be obtained without coke formation, which appears to be an attractive value for stimulating experimental research. For S/C =5, about 10.9kg of steam is required to achieve the reforming reaction of 1kg of BT. In an entire beef tallow-to-hydrogen plant with heater, steam generators, etc, the overall energy balance could be very endothermic. Therefore, the energy balance should be established to compute the energy consumption and then the energetic performance of such process."
11,Beef tallow autothermal reforming,"4.4 Beef tallow autothermal reforming The results of BT autothermal reforming are depicted in Figs. 6–8 . The interpretations of the results of the ATR system are, in great part, similar to those of the SR system. In general, as illustrated in Fig. 6, the capacity of hydrogen production is improved at low O/C ratios, especially at high temperatures and S/C ratios. This observation is in good agreement with the ATR of methane [37,38], propane [39,40], ethanol [41,42], glycerol [43,44] and vegetable oil [13]. At a given temperature, an increase in the O/C ratio decreases hydrogen productivity. In fact, the additional oxygen shifts the incomplete oxidation of the synthesis gas to a combustion reaction, resulting in decreased hydrogen yield. Moreover, the increase of the S/C improves the hydrogen production. The gain in hydrogen productivity is not significant for S/C ratios above 5. As observed in Fig. 7, at low temperatures, the CO content is quite low and increases with increasing temperature. This is because the low temperature favors the exothermic WGS and methanation reactions, leading to a low CO content. As mentioned in the SR system, obtaining a high hydrogen content and a low carbon monoxide content is a contradiction. However, because the amount of hydrogen production can be reduced at low temperatures, moderately high temperatures are preferred, even though a small amount of CO will be produced. At a given temperature, when the amount of oxygen in the feed is increased, the CO produced at low S/C values becomes more important than the CO produced at higher S/C values. The increase in the water content in the feed favors the WGS reaction (Eq. (8)). It is clear from Fig. 8 that the methane yield decreases precipitously as the temperature increases. However, at a fixed temperature and S/C ratio, the methane yield continues to decrease as the O/C ratio increases. In conclusion, high hydrogen yield (green part in Fig. 6), moderate carbon monoxide yield (yellow part in Fig. 7), trace amounts of methane (purple part in Fig. 8) and no coke formation can be achieved simultaneously. Hydrogen production via ATR of BT can be optimized at temperatures of 600–800°C, S/C ratios of 3–5, and O/C ratios of 0.0–0.45. (For interpretation of the color in these figures the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) ATR is an excellent method because of its ability to achieve a thermoneutral or slightly exothermic reaction by adjusting the feed ratios, which can reduce the need to heat the reactor [44]. Further optimum conditions for hydrogen production will be discussed in the thermoneutral condition discussion."
12,Thermoneutral conditions,"4.5 Thermoneutral conditions In an autothermal steam reforming process, oxygen supplies the necessary heat via the oxidation reaction for endothermic steam reforming; therefore, increasing the O/C ratio decreases the external heat requirement. The operating temperature at which the external heat flow is equal to zero is also known as an adiabatic temperature. As a result, it is possible to operate the reformer with no external energy for cooling or heating, which makes it valuable from an energy consumption point of view [45]. The thermoneutral investigation is performed by considering BT, steam and oxygen as feeds entered into the reactor at the temperature of reactor. Fig. 9 shows the variation in the heat duty with O/C ratios at different S/C ratios and temperatures. The O/C ratio has a very strong effect on the heat of reaction. The increase in O/C ratio can even transform the overall reaction from endothermic to exothermic. At 600°C, O/C ratios of 0.419–0.427 are feasible to obtain thermoneutral conditions with the S/C values between 3 and 5, whereas at 900°C, the O/C is 0.384–0.402. For all configurations considered, the thermoneutrality was obtained with an O/C ratio of 0.384–0.427. The recommended conditions, which maximize hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and without forming coke at thermoneutral conditions, are S/C =5, T =600°C and O/C =0.422. Table 6 gives the synthesis gas composition at the optimum conditions of BT ATR reactor."
13,Conclusion,"Thermodynamic equilibrium of BT steam and autothermal reforming was studied under atmospheric pressure via Gibbs free energy minimization, accounting for the possibility of coke formation. BT was considered as a mixture of triglycerides consisting of the three same fatty acid groups in their structure. The equilibrium compositions were calculated with the aid of the Aspen Plus™ software. Before the simulation could be started, triglycerides, main components of BT and non-databank compounds of Aspen Plus™, were added. The study started with an expanded product set, approximately 30 by-products, to evaluate the thermodynamically possible products. Based on the thermodynamic calculation, the following conclusions can be drawn. - Thermodynamically, CH4 and C (graphite) are important products that coexist with H2O, CO2, CO and H2, while the formation of by-products such as alkanes containing two or more carbon atoms, alkenes, acids and various alcohols are negligible. - For SR system, the competition between carbon deposition and carbon elimination reactions makes the coke formation plot with non-monotone behavior. At a given temperature, an increase in the S/C lowered the amount of coke formed and for S/C ratios higher than 1, no coke can be formed at temperatures above 300°C. - The coke formation behavior in the case of ATR shows, for a given temperature, that coke formation is suppressed by the increase of the O/C ratio and/or the increase of the S/C ratio. Avoidance of coke formation is possible for S/C ratios higher than 1 and with temperatures above 300°C. - The optimum conditions for the SR of BT, determined for maximizing hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and coke formation, can be achieved at reforming temperatures between 700°C and 900°C and an S/C ratio of approximately 5. The optimal operation conditions for the SR of BT are proposed as T =700°C and an S/C ratio=5. With these conditions, a hydrogen yield of 170moles/kg BT and a CO concentration in the synthesis gas of 4.77%, with trace content of CH4 (0.01%), can be obtained without the danger of carbon deposits. - The most favorable conditions for hydrogen production from the ATR system are achieved with the temperatures, S/C ratios and O/C ratios of 600–800°C, 3–5 and 0.0–0.45, respectively. Thermoneutral conditions under these conditions can be achieved with an O/C ratio of 0.384–0.427. The recommended conditions, which maximize hydrogen production while minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and without forming coke at thermoneutral conditions, are S/C =5, T =600 °C and O/C =0.422. Under these conditions, 150moles H2/kg BT can be produced with only 2.92% CO and 0.07% CH4 in the synthesis gas. Finally, creating an energetic application for tallow avoids its tendency to be utilized as a food additive, with the associated risks to human health. Moreover, because tallow is derived from animal by-products, which have little to no value, it avoids some of the food vs. fuel debate. Hydrogen production via tallow reforming is thermodynamically feasible, and further investigation through experimental work would be greatly beneficial for understanding this process. This work provides a full thermodynamic investigation that is useful to guide the study for the high purity hydrogen production via beef tallow reforming for fuel cell application."
