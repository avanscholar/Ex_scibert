0,Introduction,"Fuel/food shortage, problem of environmental pollutants, climate change and global warming are some challenging issues of the present century. To resolve these energy-related/environmental problems, a straightforward route is the widespread use of solar energy and development of photon-based technologies [1,2]. Using photon-to-electron conversion strategy and synthesis of low-price, nanostructured, narrow-bandgap solar energy materials, we could cost-effectively fabricate a wide range of solar cells and design a variety of advanced photochemical (electrochemical) reactors to produce electricity or store the solar energy as hydrogen-based solar fuels [2–4]. Although hydrogen is universally considered as the cleanest fuel, its storage as diatomic molecules is dangerous and associated with a risk of explosion [5]. Concerning this problem, a solution is the conversion of hydrogen to ammonia, which has been recently proposed as an alternative clean as well as safe fuel for application in fuel cells [5–7]. Besides its importance as a modern/green fuel, ammonia synthesis is crucial for chemical industries, particularly for fertilizer manufacturing companies [8,9]. From biological standpoint, this strategic material indeed supplies the nitrogen requirement of living organisms [10] −which is utilized through a complex metabolic pathway, in the synthesis of N-containing biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, nucleotides, and proteins [11,12]. Although the main source of nitrogen is atmospheric N2 gas (78 percent), nitrogen molecules cannot be directly utilized by green plants or animals; the noble nature of N2 is due to the strong triple bond which exists between the nitrogen atoms (N ≡ N) [13]. So, N2 conversion to ammonia is of paramount importance for living organisms, justifying why two Nobel Prizes were awarded in this area, one to Fritz Haber and the other to Carl Bosch [14]. During Haber-Bosch process, ammonia is synthesized under high temperature and pressure conditions ( T ≥ 400 ° C ; P ∼ 200 − 300 atm [13]), through a gas-phase reaction between N2 and H2 molecules over a Fe-based catalyst [8]. Owing to the high temperature and pressure conditions, the process is highly energy-consuming and produces several million metric tons of CO2 by-product per year [15]. Besides this, the hydrogen feed is conventionally generated through a vapor-phase H-X bond cleavage process of a hydrocarbon feedstock, the so-called steam reforming [7,16,17]. Inside the main reactor, H2 molecules are chemisorbed on the Haber-Bosch catalyst surface and are converted to hydrogen atoms [18]. Similarly, nitrogen atoms are catalytically generated at high-T condition of the reactor, through a dissociative pathway. Since both atoms are very reactive, they can easily recombine and are eventually converted to ammonia. Besides this dissociative route (the prevailing mechanism for the Haber-Bosch process), ammonia could also be synthesized through an alternative/associative pathway, via a consecutive attachment of H-atoms to N2 molecules at the catalyst surface [19,20]. In contrast to Haber-Bosch process, the latter strategy (associative route) has been adopted by the nature for the enzymatic synthesis of ammonia [19,20]; because under ambient conditions (biological temperature), the atomization of N2 molecules seems impossible. Since H atoms play a crucial role in the synthesis of ammonia, instead of doing this conventional “ h y d r o c a r b o n → H 2 → H ” energy-inefficient as well as environmental polluting process (CO2 is the by-product), hydrogen atoms could be directly generated via a shortcut, green route. In this new plan, by using sunlight and a water photosplitting setup [21], we could transiently generate H-atoms [22], through a proton photoreduction reaction ( H + + e C B − → H ) on a semiconductor material. This novel (photon-based/green) strategy to generate H-atoms is the essence of present study for solar conversion of N2 molecules to ammonia fuel. Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia was first reported in 1977 by Schrauzer and Guth [23]. These researchers produced ammonia using a batch UV-illuminated reactor filled by N2 gas and a humidified-TiO2 (water-chemisorbed) powder. They also showed that the photocatalyst performance could be enhanced in the presence of Fe dopant. Ten years later, Khader et al. [24] reported that they could produce ammonia upon a catalyst mixture of iron oxides. The catalyst mixture was prepared via a complicated high-temperature, partial-reduction procedure in a humid H2 atmosphere. Contemporaneously, in another complex work, without clarifying the mechanistic details or pronouncing the advantage of nanotechnology, Tennakone et al. reported that they were able to photochemically reduce nitrogen molecules in a basic suspension of Fe3+ cations [25]. The authors also highlighted the ability of iron to chemisorb N2 molecules. Regarding iron importance in the synthesis of ammonia, it is worth declaring that this element is abundant in the Earth’s crust [26], it exhibits a good interaction with N2 molecules [25,27] and absorbs H atoms [28]. Iron is naturally utilized by living organisms and plays a vital role in the functioning of nitrogenase enzyme [10]. It is also worth noting that iron oxide (Fe2O3) is a narrow-bandgap semiconductor material [29]. These characteristic properties are the reasons why we focused on this solar energy material and decided to investigate the ability of iron oxide as an efficient/non-toxic/low-price photocatalyst for artificial photosynthesis of ammonia at ambient conditions. Moreover, we should mention that for such a heterogeneous semiconductor material, a more photocatalytic activity is attainable if a suitable nanoscale synthesis approach becomes applied [21]. Using a facile precipitation-calcination method, we here synthesize iron (III) oxide nanoparticles and apply them in a water-photosplitting reactor to produce ammonia. We chose Fe2O3 (hematite), because iron (II) oxide is thermodynamically unstable, and magnetite (Fe3O4) in comparison of hematite exhibits a less photocatalytic activity [30,31]. The superiority of this energy material is verified by comparison with some conventional TiO2-based materials. Finally, the N2-photofixation phenomenon is scrutinized from a physicochemical viewpoint and a reaction scheme is proposed for the synthesis of ammonia and hydrazine by-product."
1,Experimental,
2,Photocatalyst preparation,"2.1 Photocatalyst preparation The photocatalysts under study, viz. Fe2O3, Fe2O3-TiO2, and Pd/Fe2O3-TiO2 were synthesized according to the literature [32,33]; briefly, to prepare iron (III) oxide nanoparticles, a 0.1M aqueous solution of iron (III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; Sigma-Aldrich; 99.99%) was prepared and heated up to 353K. At this temperature, with adjusting pH in the range of 8–9 (using 0.1M sodium carbonate, Merck KGAa), a dark reddish brown suspension was obtained. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was thereafter washed several times with warm de-ionized water and dried at 383K for 12h. The product was finally calcined at 673K in air atmosphere for 4h. In the case of binary photocatalyst (Fe2O3-TiO2), the same precursor was applied and the 1:1 molar ratio nanocomposite material was synthesized through a modified impregnation method [32,34]; namely, 0.4g of commercial titania nanoparticles (Aeroxide® P25, Evonik-Degussa GmbH; composed of 78% anatase, 14% rutile and 8% amorphous [35]) was added to 100mL 0.1M iron (III) nitrate solution and stirred 30min. The resulting slurry was then dried at 383K overnight and calcined in the same manner as mentioned for Fe2O3. To prepare the palladium loaded photocatalyst (Pd 0.2wt% [33]), an appropriate quantity of palladium (II) acetate (Sigma-Aldrich; 47%) was dissolved in a minimum amount of acetic acid (pH=3) and the solution was diluted to 50mL using deionized water. The binary photocatalyst (synthesized formerly) was dispersed in this solution and the mixture was thereafter illuminated by xenon light source as described elsewhere [2]. After photo-deposition of elemental palladium, the suspended ternary photocatalyst (Pd/Fe2O3-TiO2) was filtered and washed several times with de-ionized water. The filtrate was transferred into a vacuum desiccator and finally dried for a day at room temperature."
3,Photocatalyst characterization,"2.2 Photocatalyst characterization Crystallographic structure of the synthesized photocatalysts was determined using a Philips X’Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer (λ=1.54Å; Cu-Kα beam). The optical absorbance spectra of the photocatalysts were measured in the diffuse reflectance mode via a Varian Cary 5 UV–vis-NIR spectrometer (BaSO4 was used as blank). N2 adsorption-desorption (BET isotherm) and porosimetry experiments of the photocatalysts powder were conducted at 77K on a BELSORB-max (BEL, Japan) instrument. The field emission scanning electron micrographs (FE-SEM) were taken using a ZEISS SIGMA VP electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS/EDX). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using an 8025-BesTec (Germany) spectrometer with monochromatic Al-Kα beam as excitation source (1486.6eV). The binding energies were corrected using the standard C1s peak at 284.8eV [36]."
4,Photocatalytic conversion of N2 to ammonia and product analysis,"2.3 Photocatalytic conversion of N2 to ammonia and product analysis Nitrogen photo-fixation/reduction reactions were carried out at 298K using a homemade water-splitting photoreactor, comprised of a 500W power-tunable Xe-lamp (Ushio Xenon Short Arc Lamp) and a cylindrical double-walled glassy chamber (capacity: 50mL, irradiated area: 25cm2) equipped with a temperature-controlling bath circulator (WCR-P6). We utilized xenon light source because its spectrum is close to that of Sun, and the source is often applied in commercial solar simulators [4]. The intensity of light striking the reaction vessel was set at 100mW/cm2, similar to that coming directly from the sun to the earth’s surface under non-cloudy (standard) conditions [4,37]. The reaction mixture was 50mL distilled water containing 0.025g suspended photocatalyst nanoparticles [38], 789mgL−1 ethanol (hole scavenger) [39], and dissolved nitrogen molecules. During the tests, the mixture was magnetically stirred and a pure N2 gas (99.99%) was slowly bubbled (flow rate: 62mL/min) through the reaction medium. For quantitative analysis of the reaction products, a Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3100 UV–visible spectrometer was utilized. The concentration of ammonia was spectrophotometrically determined at 425nm (detection limit: 2.22μmol/L), after its conversion to “ammonobasic mercuric iodide” using Nessler’s reagent (Merck Millipore) [40]. The quantity of hydrazine was also measured at 458nm (detection limit: 0.44μmol/L), after a condensation reaction and the formation of p-dimethylaminobenzalazine chromophore [41]. The experiments were repeated at least three times, the mean values were reported as final data, and the error bars were plotted using the standard deviation of these independent measurements [42]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the photocatalysts under study are depicted in Fig. 1 . The pattern shown for Fe2O3 is the same as that reported for α- ferric oxide (hematite; JCPDS cards no. 84-0306), having a rhombohedrally centered hexagonal structure [43,44]; no impurity peak, due to other γ or β phases, was observed. In the case of Fe2O3-TiO2, besides the peaks of Fe2O3 (marked by filled circles), the remaining peaks match well with those of TiO2 (anatase and rutile phases; P25 [35]) with JCPDS cards no. 21-1272 and 76-0321. In the presence of Pd, no characteristic peak was observed. This is because of low quantity of Pd atoms in the photocatalyst matrix, which is not detectable through conventional XRD studies [43]. The presence of Pd will be later proved through EDS and XPS analyses. The peak broadening observed in Fig. 1, roughly indicates a nanoparticulate nature of the photocatalyst materials synthesized here [21]; according to Scherrer relation, the width of peaks (FWHM) is inversely proportional to the size of nanocrystallites. The nanostructure of the photocatalysts will be also proved later using FE-SEM images and N2 physisorption isotherms. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the photocatalysts under consideration are plotted in Fig. 2 . TiO2 diagram exhibits a strong absorption below 400nm. In the presence of Fe2O3, however, the absorption edge of the photocatalyst is extended to the visible region (the lower energy values). With photodeposition of Pd on Fe2O3-TiO2 nanocomposite, the absorption of light is enhanced at wavelengths longer than 600nm, as compared with that of the binary photocatalyst (Fe2O3-TiO2). This photon absorption enhancement could be rationalized to the surface Plasmon resonance effect of Pd cocatalyst, as witnessed elsewhere [45]. In the visible region of the spectrum, Fig. 2 also indicates that the greatest light absorption is due to Fe2O3 energy-material. The optical bandgap ( E g ) of the photocatalysts was determined through Kubelka-Munk approach as explained in our previous report [21]; briefly, using the relation F ( R ) = ( 1 − R ) 2 / 2 R (R is reflectance), the values of F2(R) were calculated and plotted against the energy of incident photons. The intersection of the tangent with the energy axis determines the bandgap (see Supporting information). Applying this method, the values of E g were obtained 3.2 and 2.06eV for TiO2 and Fe2O3, respectively. These data are in good agreement with the literature [46,47]. In the case of composite semiconductor materials, two values of E g were expected, one for TiO2 (the greater value) and the other for Fe2O3 component. For Fe2O3-TiO2 and Pd/Fe2O3-TiO2 composite materials, the values of (2.7, 2.06) and (2.9, 2.02) eV were estimated respectively. Such a shift in bandgap, owing to the creation of extra energy levels in the band structure of the resulting composite photocatalyst, was also reported elsewhere [48]. The nanosized structure inferred from XRD peak broadening was confirmed by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. The observation of hysteresis loops in Fig. 3 indicates that the photocatalyst materials synthesized here are all mesoporous [4], having pore diameters in the range of 2–50nm; see Table 1 . As compared with that of TiO2 (P25), Table 1 reveals that the surface area of Fe2O3 is less. This observation justifies why the surface area of the binary nanocomposite (Fe2O3-TiO2) cannot be greater than that of pure TiO2. By photo-deposition of Pd cocatalyst, however, the number of active sites and hence the BET surface area increase significantly. FE-SEM images (Fig. 4 ) show that all the photocatalyst materials synthesized here consist of relatively uniform nanoparticles, which could serve as a suitable medium for N2 trapping during the photoconversion process. The presence of Pd and other elements in the photocatalyst materials was confirmed through EDX analyses (Table 2 ). To identify the oxidation state of the constituting elements, we also performed some X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (see Supporting information). The results are summarized in Table 3 . By comparing the binding energy values obtained here with those reported in the XPS database of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [50], we can definitely conclude that Pd is in its zero-valence and Fe in +3 oxidation state. This finding was already expected because for the synthesis of the photocatalyst, we consciously used iron (III) nitrate precursor and the deposition of palladium atoms was also carried out through the photoreduction process ( P d 2 + + 2 e C B − → P d ), similar to that witnessed for Ag photodeposition on a nanocomposite semiconductor material [2]."
7,Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia in aqueous media using nitrogen molecules under ambient conditions,"3.2 Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia in aqueous media using nitrogen molecules under ambient conditions Nitrogen photofixation experiments were carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. The extent of ammonia (and hydrazine by-product) was determined after two hours operation of the photoreactor. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the greatest amount of ammonia is produced on the Fe2O3 photocatalyst, which can be interpreted in terms of the superiority of Fe2O3 to absorb more photons in the visible region (see Fig. 2) and the potency of iron to chemisorb nitrogen molecules [51,25]. For the remaining (titania-based) photocatalysts, we also justifiably observed that the rate of ammonia production ( R ¯ ; the average value) increases as follows: (1) R ¯ NH 3 TiO 2 < R ¯ NH 3 Fe 2 O 3 − TiO 2 < R ¯ NH 3 Pd / Fe 2 O 3 − TiO 2 Here, the greater ability of hematite to harvest photons in the visible region (see Fig. 2) justifies why Fe2O3-TiO2, in comparison with titania, has a better performance. The superiority of Pd/Fe2O3-TiO2 is also interpretable in terms of (a) better charge separation due to the formation of a metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier −which facilitates the transport of photogenerated electrons to the metal sink [52], (b) the ability of Pd to store H atoms [22,53] and (c) the greater surface area of the photocatalyst to adsorb more nitrogen molecules. Since the maximum performance was obtained for Fe2O3, we also did a kinetic study on this photocatalyst material. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6 . This figure shows that unlike ammonia, the concentration of hydrazine by-product, as time goes by, reaches a steady state and remains almost unchanged. Under this situation, the rate of hydrazine formation is equal to the rate of its consumption and conversion to ammonia. Moreover, the sigmoid behavior observed in Fig. 6 for photocatalytic production of ammonia indicates that at the initial stage of the process (so-called induction period [54]), the quantity of ammonia is low. By the photo-production of hydrazine intermediate [55], however, the rate of ammonia photosynthesis becomes accelerated and the maximum velocity is attained during the second 60-min of the reaction progress ( 60 ≤ t / m i n ≤ 120 ). Thereafter, the rate of ammonia photosynthesis declines. This is due to the reverse process [53,56], i.e. ammonia photo-degradation, which could be significant by increasing the amount of product or consumption of the hole-scavenger additive."
8,A reaction scheme and mechanistic arguments,"3.3 A reaction scheme and mechanistic arguments As indicated in the Introduction, for ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions, the generation of H-atoms is crucial. During the enzymatic fixation of nitrogen, H atoms ( H + / e − ) are biologically produced and temporarily stored as NADPH [57]; here, the energy need is biochemically provided through the ATP-to-ADP conversion process [58]. In the semiconductor-assisted/photonic synthesis of ammonia, however, the energy is abiotically supplied by the incident photons ( h v ), and H atoms are transiently produced through the water/proton reduction process on the semiconductor (SC) surface [21,22]: (2) S C + h v ⇝ h V B + + e C B − (3) { H 2 O + e C B − → · H + O H − H + + O H − ⇌ H 2 O − − − − − − − − − − − H + + e C B − → · H Since hydrogen is the smallest atom in the universe [21], its direct observation via conventional methods seems impossible. Concerning this issue, using a quantum electrochemical approach, we recently showed that during a proton reduction reaction, not only H-atoms are transiently generated on a cathode surface but they can also be atomistically stored in the Pd lattice [22]. Because H-atoms are reactive, they naturally recombine together ( H + H → H 2 ) and evolve as H2 diatomic gas. In the presence of N2, however, the scenario is different. Hydrogen atoms could consecutively attach to the adsorbed nitrogen molecules and produce some transient radical as well as stable intermediate species [59]; the result is the synthesis of ammonia through the following pathway: (4) N ≡ N + · H → · N = NH (5) · N = NH + · H → · NH − NH · (6) · NH − NH · + · H → NH 2 − NH · (7) NH 2 − NH · + · H → NH 2 − NH 2 (8) NH 2 − NH 2 + · H → NH 3 + NH 2 · (9) NH 2 · + · H → NH 3 The radical species mentioned above, have also been hypothesized elsewhere, and proved by DFT studies [39,60]. Moreover, we should note that the present reaction pathway is able to predict the production of hydrazine by-product, which was already verified (see Fig. 5). During the photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia, to satisfy the charge neutrality ( e C B − + h V B + = 0 ), along with the proton reduction reaction (Eq. (3)), the photogenerated holes must also be consumed via an oxidative process. In the absence of hole scavengers (also known as sacrificial agents), hydroxide ions are usually oxidized and converted to hydroxyl radicals ( O H − + h V B + → · OH ) [61]. Similar to H atoms, OH radicals are very reactive; they can recombine with H atoms or oxidize the ammonia product [53,62]. This fact explains why in the absence of ethanol, the amount of ammonia is relatively low (about half, we observed here; see Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supporting information), but acceptable compared to the literature [38]. By adding ethanol, however, the product yield increases significantly. This is because of the consumption (annihilation) of OH radicals at the photocatalyst surface, via reaction with ethanol and partial oxidation/conversion of the sacrificial agent to other oxygenate compounds/fuels, particularly acetaldehyde and diethyl ether [39,63]. During this oxidation process, OH radicals act as a hydrogen abstracting (oxidizing) agent [64], and they become deactivated by conversion into H2O molecules (see Scheme 1 ). We should finally remark that for the photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia, because of the reasons discussed below, the main (not the sole) source of hydrogen atoms seems to be water molecules: • As witnessed elsewhere [38] and confirmed by us, ammonia can be appreciably synthesized in the absence of any hole-scavenger additive. By adding ethanol to the reaction medium, however, the extent of product increases significantly through the annihilation of OH radicals at the photocatalyst surface (see Scheme 1). • In competition with water, ethanol is less deprotonated ( p K a = 16 ) and hence could not serve as a major source for the photogeneration of hydrogen atoms ( H + + e C B − → H ). Moreover, we must bear in mind that the concentration of ethanol (0.02M) is negligible compared to that of water (55.5M)."
9,Conclusions,"By illumination of semiconductor nanoparticles in aqueous media, we can transiently generate H atoms and hydrogenate N2 molecules at the interface (nanoparticles/solution) region. Concerning this semiconductor-assisted photoconversion strategy, hematite nanoparticles could be prepared through a facile precipitation/calcination method, and employed as efficient, eco-friendly, low-price energy materials to photosynthesize ammonia under ambient conditions. For the present N2 photo-fixation reaction in aqueous media, a reaction pathway was proposed based on “transient generation of H-atoms and successive atomistic hydrogenation of N ≡ N molecules”, and the phenomenon was discussed in detail from physicochemical viewpoint. The process was also investigated from kinetic standpoint and hydrazine was recognized as the by-product of the N2 photo-fixation reaction."
