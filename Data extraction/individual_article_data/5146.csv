0,Introduction,"p-Hydroxycinnamic acids (p-HCAs) are widely used for their biological properties such as antioxidant [1–4], anti-UV [5–7], anti-inflammatory [8,9] and antimicrobial activities [10–13]. As a result, they are considered as high value molecules and precursors of other molecules of interest for cosmetic [14], pharmaceutical and food industries. Moreover, recent developments in polymers present p-HCAs as building blocks of interest for the plastics industry [15–18]. p-HCAs are plant and fungi secondary metabolites. They can be produced by chemical synthesis such as Knoevenagel-Doebner condensation from p-hydroxybenzaldehydes [19] or extracted directly from plants using aqueous solution of ethanol, methanol and acetone as extractants [20–23]. Nevertheless, those techniques present many drawbacks such as the reagents cost, the availability of natural raw materials at low cost and large quantities, the low content of such molecules in the biomass, the use of hazardous solvents and the production of organic waste. On the other hand, synthetic biology and fermentation technologies showed promising results in producing p-HCAs using different simple carbon substrate such as glucose. Hence, there is an upsurge interest for the biotechnological production of p-HCAs using microorganisms [24,25]. The viability of biotechnological p-HCAs production depends not only on the fermentation step, but also on the development of a clean and efficient downstream process, on its technical feasibility and its economic viability. In this paper, we are interested in the production of p-coumaric acid (p-hydroxycinnamic acid, p-CA), the precursor of other p-HCAs (e.g., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid) and of various valuable secondary metabolites, using a modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), ABG010 (details in section 2.4.1). Microbial p-HCAs production still faces several challenges. First, p-CA and other p-HCAs are slightly soluble in water (0.78 g.L-1 for ferulic acid and 0.98 g.L-1 for caffeic acid, at 25 °C) [26]. As no water solubility value has yet been published for p-CA, we determined it experimentally and found 0.838 ± 0.003 g.L-1 at 30 °C. Their hydrophilic-lipophilic features can be deduced from the partition coefficient, usually measured between octanol and water (Ko/w) [27]. Databases or estimation software can be used to find or predict Ko/w in order to get an idea about the solute nature. For p-CA, Log(Ko/w) is 1.59 when estimated using KOWWINTM v 1.68, indicating its lipophilicity. As the fermentation medium is an aqueous-based solution, the hydrophobicity of p-CA is a production limiting factor. Secondly, as stated above, p-HCAs such as p-CA have anti-microbial properties that could harshly limit their production by microorganisms. Baranowski et al., 1980, studied the inhibition of a S. cerevisiae strain by p-HCAs, and observed an increase of the growth lag phase with only 100 mg.L-1 p-CA in the culture medium, and a total inhibition at 1 g.L-1 of p-CA in the culture medium [10]. Herald and Davidson, 1983, studied p-HCAs antibacterial activity as well but on different strains: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). They found that p-CA caused more than 99.9% inhibition of E. coli at 1 g.L-1 (at pH 5.0 and after 48 h), S. aureus at 500 mg.L-1 (at pH 5.0 and after 48 h), and B. cereus at 500 mg.L-1 (at pH 7.0 and after 9 h) [11]. Continuous removal of a fermentation product using an in situ or in stream product recovery (ISPR, also called extractive bioconversion) process allows avoiding product retro-inhibition as well as antimicrobial effect of the product if applicable, as demonstrated for several molecules produced by fermentation [28] such as alcohols (ethanol [29], butanol [30,31]) and organic acids [32] (3-hydroxypropionic acid [33,34], lactic acid [35]). In the case of biotechnological production of p-HCAs, continuous product removal is expected to detoxify the fermentation medium, remove the solubility limitation and enhance the productivity. For hydrophobic molecules such as p-HCAs, produced by fermentation and thus in an aqueous medium, liquid–liquid extraction using a water-immiscible solvent seems to be a promising extraction technique [36]. The keystone of a liquid–liquid extraction process is the choice of solvent. It is necessary to establish beforehand the properties that the solvent must have for the process implementation. Some solvent selection strategies for extractive fermentations have been published, using theoretical or experimental data. First, Kollerup and Daugulis, 1985, and then Bruce and Daugulis, 1991, presented the first systematic and comprehensive screening strategy based on predicted solvent properties [37,38]. They, among other things, developed a computer program allowing to screen a large quantity of solvent prior to experimental assessment. Dafoe and Daugulis, 2014, presented a review on extractant selection for direct removal of target molecules from the bioreactor over the last five years, and a part of this work reviews liquid–liquid extraction system using organic solvents and their selection [28]. In this paper, an original and simple score enabling solvent selection is proposed for an indirect removal of bioconversion product. The developed methodology is based on different criteria weighted according to their significance for the process with experimental demonstrations and assessments. This method is adaptable and applicable under process specifications and requires a pre-selection based on literature in order not to assess unreasonable solvents. For example, the first part of Grundtvig et al., 2018, selection proposition, regarding tabulated properties, could be used as so and would allow to narrow the list of pre-selected solvents [39]. Some of the criteria are essential for an extractive fermentation using liquid–liquid extraction. The first criterion is solvent biocompatibility towards the microorganism. Two toxicity mechanisms must be taken into account when using solvent to extract a fermentation product: (i) the contact toxicity, related to the direct contact of the microorganism with the solvent, and (ii) the molecular toxicity caused by solvent saturation of the aqueous fermentation medium (i.e. solvent maximal water solubility) [40]. Several technologies, such as membrane contactors for a membrane-based solvent extraction or two-phase partitioning bioreactor with immobilized cells, allow limiting direct contact between the solvent and the fermentation medium. However, such an approach cannot prevent molecular toxicity. Therefore, the present work will focus only on the molecular toxicity of the tested solvents. This toxicity depends on several characteristics of the solvent, such as its nature, hydrosolubility, polarity and molecular weight. Laane et al., 1985, [41], implied that Log(Ko/w) is a meaningful parameter reflecting solvent polarity that can be used to predict biocompatibility. According to the authors, solvents with a Log(Ko/w) > 4 are more likely to be biocompatible. A low hydrosolubility, a low polarity and a high molecular weight tend to favor a good biocompatibility but solvent chemical nature is also a crucial factor [42]. Moreover, as microorganisms have different solvent tolerances, it is therefore necessary to experimentally assess the solvent biocompatibility with the strain of interest. The second, but equally important criterion, is the solvent capacity to extract selectively the molecule of interest. For the present application, a water-immiscible solvent is needed. Research on microporous membrane/solvent microextraction (MPMSME), a novel analytical method used for p-HCAs, gives a good indication of which water-immiscible solvents could be a good extractant for p-CA. Two research teams screened solvents and obtained the best results with long chain alcohols such as 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol [43,44]. Other authors found hexyl acetate as the best p-HCAs extractant [45]. A good p-HCAs extractant will be a polar solvent, protic or aprotic. It can be explained by the presence of the carboxyl group on p-HCAs, which confers polarity to these apolar molecules and thus a capacity to form hydrogen bonds. In order to experimentally measure the solvent’s capacity to extract selectively the molecule of interest, the partition coefficient also called distribution coefficient (Log(KD)) is a suitable parameter. As p-CA is a phenolic acid that possesses two pKa values, pH of the aqueous phase is an important factor for the extraction success. pKa of p-CA carboxylic acid function is 4.65 and that of the phenol is 9.92 [46], therefore at pH < 4.65, p-CA will be mostly in its undissociated form and less soluble in water, thus the extraction with an organic solvent would be more efficient. On the other hand, fermentation process allows a small window of working pH, depending on the microorganism, in consequence a trade-off should be made between fermentation and extraction processes and must be studied in detail. For example, S. cerevisiae, the strain used in this work, is an acidophilic microorganism, with optimal growth at pH 4.5–5 [47]. For these reasons, p-CA Log(KD) will be measured between solvents and water at four initial different pH (before the addition of p-CA): pH 1 in order to show the best case scenario for the extraction (99% of p-CA is in its undissociated form [48]), pH 3 to further assess the effect of more acidic pH than p-CA pKa, pH 7 as the reference and pH 11.55, conversely, to show the effect of a pH higher than p-CA pKa on the extraction (water at pH 11.55 with addition of 400 mg.L-1 p-CA equate to a pH of 7.09, more information in section 2.2). Assessments at these pHs will show the beginning of the inflection point of the sigmoid function of extraction as function of pH due to deprotonation of p-CA carboxylic acid moiety. The last equally essential criterion is material compatibility. The solvent must be harmless to process equipment. Besides those three criteria, in order to rank solvents, other criteria such as safety, sourcing and price were chosen. These criteria are important but non-essential for the process implementation. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been published on p-HCAs separation from an engineered strain of S. cerevisiae fermentation. This paper presents an original strategy to select solvents for an ISPR process to recover p-CA produced by an engineered microorganism, considering the aforementioned criterion. The results presented here are potentially relevant to work on other p-HCAs due to their similarity in structure and pKas, and this strategy is applicable with adjustments for other extractive bioconversions."
1,Materials & methods,
2,Solvent selection score,"2.1 Solvent selection score Beforehand, literature search was made in order to get indications of which solvents are good candidates for p-CA extraction so as to reduce the initial solvents number to be considered for the study (around fifty articles-books were studied). Based on this literature (presented partially in section 1), 10 solvents were thus selected: 9 good potential candidates, namely 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (99% form Alfa Aesar), ethyl acetate (>99.7% from Sigma-Aldrich), hexyl acetate (99% from Sigma-Aldrich), n-butyl acetate (>99% from Alfa Aesar), 1-heptanol (98% from Acros organics), 1-octanol (99% from Acros Organics), 1-decanol (>98% from Alfa Aesar), 1-dodecanol (>99% from TCI) and oleyl alcohol (80–85% from Alfa Aesar). The last solvent, selected as a negative control for the extraction capacity, was n-hexane (>99% from Merck KGaA) as it is an apolar solvent. The first step was an exclusion step. Essential criteria, namely extraction performance, biocompatibility and material compatibility were assessed in this step. For each essential criterion, the solvent is graded between 0 and 1. For biocompatibility and material compatibility, solvents get 0 or 1: 0 if the solvent does not meet the expectation and 1 if it does. A grade equal to zero forces the solvent to be removed from the candidates list. In consequence, it will not be studied further. Biocompatibility was determined experimentally (cf. section 2.3) and for material compatibility, information was obtained from suppliers. For this work, the process equipment consisted in a membrane contactor pilot plant manufactured by Seprosys (La Rochelle, France) with 3 M™ Liqui-Cel™ EXF-2.5x8 membrane contactor. The pilot plant materials are stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene. For the extraction performance, grades are between 0 and 1 as a result of experimental distribution coefficient determination (cf. section 2.2). Solvents are compared based on results obtained at pHexp 3.66 and the score 1 is given to the best solvent on extraction performance. Then, the other solvents grades are expressed as ratio of their Log(KD) to the best one. As for the first two criteria, a grade equal to zero forces the solvent to be withdrawn from the list of candidates. The next step consists in the weighting of extraction performance score and not essential criteria depending on their importance for the present application, particularly on process and production requirements. Table 1 presents this second step with the non-essential criteria and the defined weighting, with a maximum total score equal to 50. For implementation of extraction performances, the results are experimental ones: solvents are compared on p-CA distribution results with yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB). As for extraction performances, the best score, here 20, is given to the solvent having the best distribution coefficient. Then, for the other solvents, rates are expressed as percentage regarding the best one. For the non-essential criteria, scores are set based on scientific literature. For measuring solvent safety, Globally Harmonized System of classification and labelling of chemicals (GHS) was used [49]. More details on the method of calculation are presented in supplementary information."
3,Extraction performance: p-CA distribution coefficient determination in water and in real fermentation medium,"2.2 Extraction performance: p-CA distribution coefficient determination in water and in real fermentation medium The distribution coefficient measurement method used in this work is based on shake-flask method [27]. p-CA was purchased from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry, purity: ≥ 98.0%). For distribution coefficient determination, initial pH of water was first adjusted to 1.03, 3.01, 7.01 and 11.56 with solutions of HCl 1 M and KOH 1 M. Solvents were pre-saturated with water and water was also pre-saturated with the respective solvent at the initial pH (pHi) and 30 °C. It is noteworthy to mention that, for ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and hexyl acetate, experimental results for initial pH of 11.56 could not be accurately obtained due to saponification reaction during the pre-saturation, therefore data are not presented. The pre-saturation step was performed in order to avoid volume bias and for this purpose initial pH was used. This means that initial pH do not correspond to those of water with p-CA solubilized inside. Instead, corresponding pH with 400 mg.L-1 of p-CA solubilized are : 1.01 (for pHi 1.03), 2.98 (for pHi 3.01), 3.66 (for pHi 7.01) and 7.09 (for pHi 11.56) and thereafter, those pH will be used as they are more representative of the process and referred to as pHexp. The use of buffer was rejected as it could affect the distribution of p-CA by a salting-out effect. All experiments, for each pHexp and each solvent were made in triplicate. 2.00 ± 0.03 mg of p-CA were added in a Pyrex falcon tube with 5 mL of saturated water at pHexp and 30 °C (to reach an initial concentration of p-CA of 400 mg.L-1). Then, 5 mL of solvent was added. The mixture was manually shaken for 2 min and then let to settle for a minimum of 3 h at 30 °C and atmospheric pressure to reach equilibrium. For oleic alcohol experiments, a centrifugation was carried out at 4000 rpm and 30 °C for 10 min in order to perfectly separate both phases. For the determination of distribution coefficient in real fermentation media (section 3.4), the method was the same but instead of water, sterilized fermentation media were used. YEPD was made of 20 g.L-1 of yeast extract, 10 g.L-1 of peptone, 20 g.L-1 of D-glucose and yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For YEPD, pHi was 6.81 and pHexp was 6.50. For YNB, pHi was 5.40 and pHexp was 4.05. The organic phase was discarded and the resulting p-CA concentration in the aqueous phase was measured (see section 2.5). Then, Log(KD) was calculated as follows (equation (1)): (1) Log K D = L o g ( [ p C A ] aq i - [ p C A ] aq eq [ p C A ] aq eq ) where [ p C A ] aq i is the initial concentration of p-CA in the aqueous phase and [ p C A ] aq eq is the p-CA concentration in the aqueous phase at equilibrium. Concentrations were measured according to the analytical method presented in section 2.5."
4,Statistical analysis for distribution coefficients,"2.3 Statistical analysis for distribution coefficients An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for distribution coefficient results for each solvent. The achievement of the one-way ANOVA requirements, the normal distribution of the residuals and the homogeneity of variance, were tested by the Shapiro–Wilk’s and the Bartlett’s tests, respectively. In the cases where statistical significance differences were identified, the dependent variables were compared using Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) test (p < 0.05)."
5,Biocompatibility experiments with an engineered S. Cerevisiae strain (ABG10),"2.4 Biocompatibility experiments with an engineered S. Cerevisiae strain (ABG10) 2.4.1 ABG010: Engineered S. Cerevisiae relevant characteristics Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C [50], uracil, tryptophan and leucine auxotrophic was used. This yeast model strain was engineered in order to produce p-CA with optimized performances. Towards this ultimate objective, ARO10 (YDR380W) and Thi3(YDL080C) genes are deleted. ARO4 (NP_009808) and ARO7 (NP_015385) were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae and mutated to resist to feedback inhibition (FBR: Feed Back Resistance) [51]. TAL, PAL, C4H and Cpr1 were optimized for yeast codon usage bias then synthesized by DC Biosciences, Dundee, UK. Characteristics of the final strain ABG010 are: MATα, ura3-52, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, GAL2+, LEU2+, aro10Δ0, thi3Δ0, FAT3 ~ MTR2::(ARO4fbr-ARO7fbr-RgTAL)::URA3, NCA3 ~ ASF1::(AtPAL-AtC4H-CrCPR1)::TRP1. ABG010 was engineered and provided by Abolis, France. 2.4.2 Biocompatibility assessment method The studied strain, ABG010, producing p-CA was maintained at −80 °C in 30% glycerol-YEPD medium. ABG10 was inoculated in a 250 mL baffled flask containing 20 mL of YEPD medium (20 g.L-1 yeast extract, 10 g.L-1 peptone, 20 g.L-1 D-glucose), and cultivated overnight in a Thermo MaxQ 4000 shaker set at 30 °C and 220 rpm. This culture was used to inoculate two new 250 mL baffled flasks to an initial OD620 nm of 0.1: one containing 20 mL of YEPD (the control) and one with 20 mL of solvent saturated YEPD. The flasks were grown in the same conditions as described above. Four samples were taken for each flask over time. For each sample, membrane cells integrity and esterasic activity were analysed by flow cytometry using a double cell staining with propidium iodide (PI) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). This method uses the particularity of PI to fix to DNA after penetrating damaged cell membranes. On the opposite, unaffected cells will not integrate PI and will not display any PI related fluorescence. On the other hand, CFDA-SE penetrates viable cells and becomes fluorescent when cleaved by esterase activity. Esterases are ubiquitous enzymes that are used here as a marker of cells viability. Yeasts suspension was diluted to approximately 106 cells.mL−1 in pH 4 McIlvaine buffer. One millilitre of the cell suspension was stained by adding 10 µL of 1 mg.mL−1 commercial PI solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 µL CFDA-SE (Chemchrom V8, Biomérieux) diluted ten times in acetone. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the stained suspension was analysed with a Sysmex CyFlow® Space flow cytometer (Partec, France) equipped with an argon 488 nm laser and four filters: a forward-angle light scatter (FSC), a side-angle light scatter (SSC), both combined with a diode collector, a 536 nm band-pass filter (526 to 546 nm) to collect the green fluorescence of carboxyfluorescein (FL1 channel) and a 670 nm band-pass filter to collect the red fluorescence of PI (FL2 channel) with photomultiplier tubes. Data acquisition, instrument control and data analysis were controlled and performed with FloMax® software (version 2.9, Partec, France). In addition, optical density at 620 nm was measured for each sample and for the last sample, (at 24 h) p-CA production was measured (see section 2.5)."
6,Analytical methods,"2.5 Analytical methods p-CA concentrations in aqueous phase were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Thermo scientific, Ultimate 3000) coupled with a diode array detector (DAD) using an accucore aQ C18 column (100x3 mm, Thermo scientific). The injection volume was 2.5 μL, the oven temperature was 48 °C and the flow rate was 0.8 mL.min−1. The elution method was a 10 min gradient with acetonitrile (A) and formic acid 0.1% (B) as mobile phases: 0 min: 2% of A – 98% of B, 3 min: 10% of A – 90% of B, 8 min: 30% A – 70% of B and 9 min: 2% of A – 98% of B. The retention time of p-CA was 4.73 min. A p-CA calibration curve with 5 points was made using commercial p-coumaric acid (≥98% from TCI). Samples were diluted (1:1) in acetonitrile and filtered using regenerated cellulose 0.2 µm filters."
7,Results and discussion,Extraction performance and biocompatibility of ten solvents were experimentally assessed. Results are presented in Table 2 and discussed below.
8,Solvent extraction performances,"3.1 Solvent extraction performances Distribution coefficients of p-CA in five alcohols are presented in Fig. 1 and in Table 2. Alcohols are protic solvents, p-CA experimental distribution coefficients (Log(KD)) for pHexp lower than p-CA pKa (i.e. 4.64) obtained were strictly above 1, which confirms that they are good candidates for the extraction. As expected, acidic pHexp led to higher distribution coefficients due to protonation of p-CA carboxylic acid moiety. It must be emphasized that there were no statistically significant differences between pHexp 1.01 and pHexp 2.98 overall and that p-CA Log(KD) at pHexp 3.66 while statistically lower, was still above 1. For pHexp 7.09, p-CA Log(KD) were negatives, meaning that p-CA distribution is predominant in the aqueous phase, that can be explained by the large proportion of dissociated p-CA at this pH. Broadly, p-CA distribution coefficients decreased when pH increased due to the proportion of undissociated p-CA, but the trend is relatively weak at pH lower than p-CA pKa. It seems that alcohols with longer carbon chains have lower Log(KD) and the effect of pH on the extraction yield is smoothed (e.g. no significant differences between pHexp 1.01, 2.98 and 3.66 Log(KD) for 1-decanol). The reduced capacity of solvents to extract p-CA with the increase of the carbon chain length may be explained by the difficulty to form the solvation shell around p-CA due to steric hindrance. The smoothing of the pH effect could be a result of the solvent hydrosolubility diminution. This hypothesis is discussed further below in this section. pH is a parameter influencing not only the extraction performance but also the fermentation process. Thus, it must be considered and discussed. At pH 1.01, S. cerevisiae will not grow and at pH 2.98 its growth will be affected as its optimal growth pH is 4.5–5 [47]. As shown in Fig. 1, for pHexp lower than p-CA pKa, pH does not seem limiting for the extraction performance with protic solvents; whereas for pHexp higher than p-CA pKa, a liquid–liquid extraction may not be suitable as an ISPR. If a pH higher than p-CA pKa is desired for the fermentation process, a reactive liquid–liquid extraction using tertiary amine may be a good alternative [63,64]. Here, as S. cerevisiae can tolerate pH lower than 4.64 (p-CA pKa), pH would be chosen as a compromise between extraction and fermentation needs, for example the process could be conducted at pH 4.5. Aprotic and polar solvents were tested as extractants, among them three esters (ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, hexyl acetate) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF). Obtained p-CA distribution coefficients are presented in Fig. 2 and in Table 2. As for the tested alcohols, p-CA Log(KD) of the tested esters, for pHexp more acidic than p-CA pKa, are all strictly above 1 and decrease broadly as the pH increases. Solvents such as esters, aprotic and polar, are good candidates for p-CA extraction and these results are consistent with the work of Saraji and Mousavi, 2010 [45] presented in section 1. In this case, the length of carbon chain is not associated with smoothing of pH effect since with ethyl acetate, the ester with the shortest carbon chain tested, there is no statistically significant differences between pHexp 1.01 and pHexp 2.98 Log(KD). Results for esters at pHexp 7.09 could not be obtained due to saponification reaction. This could limit their use, depending on the process. The last aprotic and polar solvent tested was 2-MeTHF. Experimental results (see Fig. 2 and Table 2) showed that this solvent is the best p-CA extractant at pHexp 1.01 but on the contrary, the worst at pHexp 3.66 compared to the other tested aprotic solvents. For this solvent, pH has an important effect on p-CA distribution, the hydrosolubility of 2-MeTHF may be the reason. The solubility of 2-MeTHF in water at 20 °C is 140 g.L-1 (see Table 2), the highest hydrosolubility among the tested solvents. This could increase p-CA affinity with the aqueous phase. The differences between the different pH values could be due to different 2-MeTHF hydrosolubility with each tested pH. A high hydrosolubility suggests also a high solvent loss, which could impact the economic viability of the process. These results are consistent with those obtained for long carbon chain alcohols, for which the impact of pH might be limited by the low hydrosolubility of the solvent. Similarly to alcohols, for pHexp higher than p-CA pKa, p-CA distribution is predominant in the aqueous phase due to the proportion of undissociated p-CA To conclude on aprotic and polar solvent, as discussed for protic solvents, fermentation must be taken into consideration at this step. As observed for alcohols, in the case of esters, for pHexp lower than p-CA pKa, pH does not seem to be a limiting factor for the extraction, but for more alkaline pHexp, esters are not good candidates as saponification reaction can occur and this implies a solvent loss and a more problematic implementation of the process. For 2-MeTHF, although there is a high pH effect, at a pHexp of 3.66: the Log(KD) still higher than 0 and so its score will be higher than 0 (see Table 3 ). For a process for which acidic pH is not a limit, 2-MeTHF can be a good candidate. As expected, the last tested solvent, n-hexane, was not suitable for p-CA extraction due to its apolarity. The determination of Log(KD) was not feasible due to p-CA crystallisation at the water/hexane interface. This phenomenon may be explained by p-CA carboxylic acid moiety that imparts a localised polarity to this phenolic and apolar molecule. Indeed p-CA needs an organic solvent with a certain polarity to be extracted. n-Hexane and water have each an affinity for a part of the molecule (hexane: aromatic ring, water: carboxylic acid moiety) and this could explain the appearance of this interfacial phenomenon. As a result, p-CA accumulates at the interface and when p-CA saturation is reached, the accumulation leads to crystallisation of the molecule. Even though this phenomenon is interesting, it raises the question of the implementation of an ISPR using hexane as the extractant phase for the recovery of p-CA. The extraction performance scores are based on p-CA Log(KD) at pHexp 3.66, used as the reference pH and corresponding to a pHi of 7.01. The Table 3 presents the solvent score for this criterion, taking as a reference 1-heptanol, the solvent with the highest p-CA Log(KD) at pH 3.66. Alcohols with a low molecular weight have the best scores, followed by esters and high molecular weight alcohols having similar score, then 2-MeTHF and n-hexane with a score of 0. Accordingly, n-hexane is the only solvent that will be excluded from the ranking for the first selection step due to its very poor extraction performance results. The distribution of glucose, substrate of the fermentation process, was assessed with each solvent. It was not extracted by any of them (data not shown)."
9,Solvent biocompatibility:,"3.2 Solvent biocompatibility: In order to determine whether solvents are biocompatible or not toward the strain of interest, the growth behavior of S. cerevisiae ABG10 in each solvent saturated cultivation medium was compared to the one obtained in the control medium (without solvent saturation). Strain growth with or without solvent saturation were compared according to four parameters measured after medium inoculation: (1) density of cells (measured by flow cytometry and correlated with optical density at 620 nm), (2) the produced p-CA concentration in the supernatant, (3) the percentage of PI labelled cells (membrane damaged cells), and (4) the percentage of CFDA-SE labelled cells (viable, enzymatically active cells). Fig. 3 presents an example of growth parameters comparison between the oleyl alcohol saturated aqueous medium and the control medium. In this example, the strain growth as well as the cell viability are similar, which leads to the conclusion that oleyl alcohol is biocompatible towards S. cerevisiae ABG10. On the opposite, growth parameters presented on Fig. 4 show that no growth occurs in 2-MeTHF saturated medium (cells density remains stable over 24 h) compared to the control. There is a high proportion of PI-labelled cells in the presence of 2-MeTHF directly after inoculation, which reveals the high toxicity of this solvent to the strain in this cultivation configuration. These kinetics have been performed for each solvent and, for the sake of clarity and concision, the 24 h results of each solvent are presented and compared in four bar charts in Fig. 5 . In those charts, the differences towards the related control are reported. Each chart presents one of the four compared parameters: (a) p-CA production, (b) cell density, (c) percentage of viable cells, and (d) percentage of non-viable cells. Roughly, bars close to 0 indicate non-significant difference with the control and reflect the biocompatibility of the solvent. The results obtained are consistent with a toxicity towards the strain of interest. Indeed, the conditions leading to low biomass production were also the ones exhibiting lower p-CA production in comparison with the control fermentation, as well as higher PI labelled cells (non-viable). As for the CFDA labelling, toxicity is not as obvious as for PI labelling if only chart C from Fig. 5 is considered. This can be explained by the nature of results format, labelling are presented as percentage of cells population and so CFDA-SE labelling has to be compared with cell density and PI labelling. The percentage of viable cells will attest of the biocompatibility of a solvent solely if the density of cells and the percentage of PI labelled cells are similar to the control. Among the ten assessed, four solvents were found biocompatible with the strain of interest: n-hexane, oleyl alcohol, butyl acetate and hexyl acetate. Contrary to the results obtained in this work, Minier and Goma, 1982 [65], found dodecanol as a biocompatible solvent in an extractive fermentation with S. cerevisiae UG5, however S. cerevisiae ABG10 seems highly sensitive to this solvent. Likewise, in this work, n-Hexane was found biocompatible whereas Kollerup and Daugulis, 1985 [37], found it toxic toward S. cerevisiae NCYC716. In contrast, oleyl alcohol is a well-known and widely used biocompatible solvent for different strains [66–68], which is in accordance with this study. These results highlight that solvent biocompatibility is strain dependent and must be assessed experimentally. As stated in section 1, it can be observed that there is broadly a trend towards biocompatibility increasing with solvent Log(Ko/w) (see in Table 2) but Log(Ko/w) has limits as a biocompatibility indicator. 1-Decanol and 1-dodecanol have a Log(Ko/w) close to 4 but in Fig. 5 it can be seen that they have a significant negative impact on both the strain development and production. The solvent chemical nature seems to have an important role in the solvent toxicity. Butyl acetate and hexyl acetate esters Log(Ko/w) are 1.85, 2.83, respectively, lower than those of 1-decanol and 1-dodecanol, though the strain production is not impacted when growing in a saturated media with these solvents. Furthermore, the effect on the growth and viability of the cells seems negligible. Organic solvents tend to increase microorganism membrane fluidity. The amount of solvent solubilised in the fermentation medium is a key factor, and as demonstrated by Osborne et al., 1990 [69], it may be the solvent volume in the membrane that is critical, and when it is reached, it leads to loss of bioactivity. Solvents with high hydrosolubility reach more easily the critical threshold leading to complete loss of activity. Furthermore, it is dependent on solvent chemical nature, and its distribution between the membrane and the fermentation medium. This can explain the differences observed between the different class of solvent and between strains. Therefore, at this step, only four solvents get a score of 1 for biocompatibility criterion, namely hexane, oleyl alcohol, butyl acetate and hexyl acetate."
10,Outcome for the exclusion step for the solvent selection,"3.3 Outcome for the exclusion step for the solvent selection Table 4 presents solvents ranking for the first step of the selection strategy. After this step of exclusion, only three solvents among the ten initially studied are still in the candidates list (see in Table 4 the ones with a total score strictly higher than 2, in bold text)."
11,Assessment of the extraction performances in fermentation media,"3.4 Assessment of the extraction performances in fermentation media p-CA distribution coefficient was measured between the three previously selected solvents and two fermentation media in order to go further in the assessment and process implementation. One complex medium (YEPD) and one defined synthetic medium (YNB) were assessed. Fig. 6 presents the p-CA distribution coefficients obtained. These results are used in the second part of the strategy to rank the selected solvents in the next section. The p-CA Log(KD) obtained are consistent with the observation made in section 3.1 regarding the pH: p-CA distribution is higher at acidic pH and especially at pH lower than p-CA pKa (4.64) due to the proportion of undissociated acid. YEPD is a strongly buffered medium as pHi (6.81) and pHexp (6.50) illustrate, whereas YNB has a lower buffering capacity. This characteristic of YNB can explain partially the good capacity of extraction of solvents with this medium, even if pHi were not the same at first. The assessment of p-CA distribution between oleyl alcohol and YEPD was very arduous due to a strong emulsion and showed the limits of a complex medium for the process implementation. As assumed by Zhang et Greasham, 1999 [70], these data indicate that the less complex the fermentation medium is, the easier the product recovery, this would be the case of p-CA recovery. In biotechnological production there is always a compromise to make between the fermentation process and the downstream process to achieve the highest production and working on the definition of an optimized and better-defined medium is one of the potential strategies. Medium complexity serves the interests of the fermentation, by providing biosynthetic precursors to the strain while allowing energy savings. Those media are inexpensive, and this explains their large industrial use. Nevertheless, with the increase of research in fermentation biotechnology, there is a growing interest in defined medium, allowing replication and simpler product recovery."
12,Final scores,"3.5 Final scores The final scoring step for the solvent selection is presented in Table 5 . For the implementation of extraction performance criteria, a score of 20 was given to hexyl acetate, having the highest distribution coefficient for p-CA extraction when using YNB medium (Fig. 6). The score of the two other solvents were obtained as a function of the hexyl acetate score and their corresponding distribution coefficient (cf. section 2.1). Safety and sourcing scores were given using the following information: oleyl alcohol is considered as the safest of the three solvent candidates [49] and is produced from animal and vegetable fats and oils. Butyl acetate can be bio-sourced from n-butanol and acetic acid, two chemicals that can be produced by fermentation. Hexyl acetate is produced from acetic acid and 1-hexanol. Nevertheless, 1-hexanol is synthesized generally from ethylene, which is mostly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons, then petro-sourced. Price score was given following suppliers information. According to the total score (Table 5), the most suitable solvent for an ISPR process to continuously extract p-CA from a fermentation medium having the YNB characteristics, is the oleyl alcohol followed by butyl acetate and then hexyl acetate."
13,Conclusion,"The reported strategy allows a quick, simple and adaptable selection of solvents for an ISPR coupled with a fermentation process limited by end-product accumulation. Methodologies to assess the solvent capacity of recovery and its compatibility with microorganisms are described and can easily be implemented for a similar process. If the molecule chemical nature is different than that of p-CA, adjustment must be made and the pre-selected list of solvent should be adapted. As for the strain, the implementation of biocompatible assessment has to be adjusted to strain properties (i.e. temperature, medium, pH). Towards the ISPR of p-CA produced by an engineered strain of S. cerevisiae using liquid–liquid extraction, three solvents can be used when working with an acidic aqueous phase, by preference order: oleyl alcohol, butyl acetate and hexyl acetate. In order to achieve the set-up of an effective downstream process, it has been highlighted that a trade-off between liquid–liquid extraction and fermentation regarding the pH must be made and definition and optimization of fermentation medium can be necessary."
