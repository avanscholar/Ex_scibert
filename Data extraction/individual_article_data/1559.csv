0,Introduction,"Recently, various metal sulfides have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties for converting solar energy to chemical energy by photocatalytic hydrogen production from water [1,2]. Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a layered metal sulfide structure, which can provide high surface area, narrow bandgap (1.2 eV (bulk) –1.8 eV (single layer)), and high electrical conductivity for the applications in lithium-ion batteries, photodetectors, transistors, solar cells, and photocatalysts [3–6]. For photocatalysts, MoS2 nanostructures cannot only provide a suitable bandgap to absorb visible light but also supply high surface areas for improving their photocatalytic activity [7,8]. However, there are some disadvantages in inhibiting their photocatalytic activity, such as the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and a limited quantity of active edge sites [8]. Recently, MoS2 nanostructures decorated with metal oxide nanostructures (such as TiO2, CuO, or ZnO) were used to improve these disadvantages [9–12]. Tin dioxide (SnO2) is a crucial n-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap (3.6 eV), which displays many unusual electronic, optical, and other physicochemical properties [13–15]. Also, SnO2 has excellent potential in a versatile range of applications, such as chemical sensors, lithium-ion batteries, cathode material, transparent conductive films, photocatalysts, and light-emitting diodes [16–18]. Recently, MoS2/SnO2 nanocomposites have been demonstrated to be good candidates for the applications of the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery and humidity sensing [19,20]. Besides, MoS2 nanostructures decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles can also use to enhance photodegradation activity under the visible-light irradiation. The enhanced photodegradation activity can be attributed to the photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation by the combination of MoS2 nanostructures and SnO2 nanoparticles [21–23]. To the best of our knowledge, MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres have not been reported as photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production and photodegradation of rhodamine B solution under the visible-light irradiation. In this study, we constructed a heterostructure photocatalysis by integrating MoS2 sub-microspheres with SnO2 nanoparticles to form a core-shell sub-microspheres using two-step hydrothermal methods. MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres have exhibited higher photocatalytic performance than that of MoS2 sub-microspheres under the visible-light irradiation."
1,Experimental,"Firstly, MoS2 sub-microspheres were successfully prepared via a hydrothermal method. In a typical route, the 20 mL aqueous solution with 0.036 g sodium molybdate dihydrate and 0.023 g thioacetamide stirred for a few minutes. The reaction solution was transferred to 50 mL Teflon-line autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. When cooled down to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, washed with water, and dried at 70 °C. Secondly, 0.45 g Tin(IV) chloride, 0.4 g sodium hydroxide, and the different weights (0.04, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 g) of citric acid were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water. 0.03 g of as-prepared MoS2 sub-microspheres was dispersed in 10 mL ethanol by ultrasonic treatment and then added into the above solution. After 20 min stirring, the reaction solution was transferred to 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. When cooled down to room temperature, the product was centrifuged, washed with deionized water, and dried at 70 °C. The surface morphology, crystal structure, photocatalytic water splitting and degradation of as-prepared samples have characterized via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6500 F), X-ray diffraction (Bruker D2 phaser), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, JEOL 2010 F), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 VersaProbe II system), gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014), and UV–vis spectroscopy (Hitachi U-2900)."

3,Evaluation of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere,"3.1 Evaluation of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere The surface morphology and nanostructure of as-synthesized MoS2 sub-microspheres and SnO2 nanoparticles were respectively examined via FESEM and FETEM. The as-obtained MoS2 sub-microspheres were. 0.5−2 μm in width (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1b presents the FETEM image of a MoS2 sub-microsphere revealed, which was composed of high quality of irregular MoS2 nanosheets. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1c) clearly shows the MoS2 layers well stacked with an interlayer distance of 0.615 nm corresponding to the (002) lattice plane of the hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 24-0513). The XRD pattern of MoS2 sub-microspheres is shown in Fig. S1a. All the diffraction peaks in the pattern of MoS2 sub-microspheres can be indexed as the hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 24-0513), which is consistent with the above result. The as-obtained SnO2 nanoparticles were grown at the weight of citric acid of 0.10 g with 5−20 nm in width (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1e presents the FETEM image depicting the SnO2 nanoparticles with short rod-like structures. Fig. 1f shows the HRTEM image of SnO2 nanoparticles with the interlayer spacing of 0.237 nm and 0.176 nm corresponded to the (200) and (211) lattice planes of the tetragonal SnO2 phase (JCPDS No. 88-0287), respectively. The XRD pattern of SnO2 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. S1b. All the diffraction peaks in the pattern of SnO2 nanoparticles can be indexed as the tetragonal SnO2 phase (JCPDS No. 88-0287), which is also consistent with the above result. Fig. 2 displays the FESEM images described the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres synthesized at the different weights (0.04, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 g) of citric acid via a hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 24 h. As the weight of the citric acid increased from 0.04 to 0.1 g, the MoS2 sub-microspheres can uniformly decorate with SnO2 nanoparticles. When the weight of citric acid was more than 0.1 g, the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres appeared to aggregate with each other. In previous work, citric acid has proven to be an excellent complexing or capping agent to prevent the formation of aggregation for the growth of nanostructures [24,25]. Besides, citric acid can also be used to reduce the sizes of SnO2 particles from micrometer to nanometer [26]. The coordination with high solubility of Sn4+ species and citric acid could slow down the nucleation rate of SnO2 particles leading to growing the small sizes of SnO2 nanoparticles. In the present work, the appropriate weight of citric acid can be beneficial to grow MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres with better stability against aggregation. The FETEM image shows that the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere composed of the number of nanosheets and nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3 a. The SAED pattern (Fig. 3b) of the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere revealed the polycrystalline diffraction rings. The concentric rings (from inside to outside) indexed to the tetragonal SnO2 phase (JCPDS No. 88-0287) and hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 24-0513), respectively. The high magnification of the TEM image of nanosheets composed of a few layers of MoS2, as shown in Fig. 3c. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3d) detected interplanar crystal spacing of 0.237 nm and 0.176 nm were corresponding to (200) and (211) lattice planes of the tetragonal SnO2 phase, respectively. Also, few lattice fringes of 0.615 nm can assign to the (002) lattice plane of the hexagonal MoS2 phase. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis shows that the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere was composed of Mo, S, Sn, and O, as shown in Fig. 3e. The XRD pattern (Fig. 3f) was MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid). The diffraction peaks at 33.5° and 39.5° could be ascribed to the (101) and (103) planes of the hexagonal MoS2 phase. The diffraction peaks at 26.6°, 33.9°, 38.0°, 51.8°, 54.8°, 57.8°, 62.6°, 64.7°, 66.0°, and 78.7° could be ascribed to the (110), (101), (200), (211), (220), (002), (221), (112), (301), and (321) planes of the tetragonal SnO2 phase. XPS analysis could use to certify the surface composition of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid), as shown in Fig. 4 . The XPS survey spectrum of the as-prepared MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) was shown in Fig. 4a. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the Mo 3d region of the as-prepared sample was shown in Fig. 4b. The XPS signals of Mo 3d were observed at binding energies at around 228.6 eV (Mo 3d5/2) and 231.6 eV (Mo 3d3/2), which are in good agreement with the previous work [27,28]. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the S 2p region of the as-prepared sample was shown in Fig. 4c. The XPS signals of S 2p were observed at binding energies at around 161.6 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.6 eV (S 2p1/2), which are in good agreement with the previous work [28]. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the Sn 3d region of the as-prepared sample was shown in Fig. 4d. The XPS signals of Sn 3d were observed at binding energies at around 458.8 eV (Sn 3d5/2) and 492.2 eV (Sn 3d3/2), which are in good agreement with the previous work [29]. The XPS signals of O 1s (Fig. 4e) were observed at binding energies at around 529.6 eV (O2− species in the lattice (OL)), 530.6 eV (oxygen vacancies or defect (OV)), and 531.4 eV (chemisorbed or dissociated (OC) oxygen species), which are in good agreement with the previous work [30,31]. In addition, the XPS survey spectra of the MoS2 microspheres and SnO2 nanoparticles can also clearly obtain the different composition, as shown in Fig. S2. The FTIR spectrum of the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) was shown in Fig. S3. The peaks at 3324, 2974, 1635, and 1419 cm−1 are assigned to stretching vibrations of OH, CH2, CO, and COH, respectively [32,33]. These peaks can confirm that citric acid exist on the surface of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres"
4,The photocatalytic performance of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere,"3.2 The photocatalytic performance of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microsphere Photocatalytic hydrogen production of the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres evaluated under visible-light (400 W Xe lamp, λ > 420 nm) irradiation using mixed 100 mL 0.1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) aqueous solution as a scavenger. Fig. 5 a displays the hydrogen evolution over MoS2 sub-microspheres and MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres with different weights of citric acid at pH 6. The average amount of hydrogen evolution was 53.3 (MoS2 sub-microspheres), 22.6 (SnO2 nanoparticles with 0.1 g citric acid), 80.0 (0.04 g citric acid), 99.6 (0.08 g citric acid), 112.2 (0.1 g citric acid), and 85.4 μmol h−1 g−1L−1 (0.2 g citric acid), respectively. When the weight of citric acid exceeded 0.1 g, the hydrogen evolution rate decreased. This phenomenon shall be attributed to the bound together of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres for reducing their specific surface areas. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated by using nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement (Fig. S4). The specific surface areas of MoS2 sub-microspheres, SnO2 nanoparticles, and MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres with different weights of citric acid were measured to be 8.8 (MoS2 sub-microspheres), 20.2 (SnO2 nanoparticles with 0.1 g citric acid), 76.7 (0.04 g citric acid), 112.5 (0.08 g citric acid), 117.2 (0.1 g citric acid), and 38.1 m2 g−1 (0.2 g citric acid), respectively. Compared to that of other different weights of citric acid, MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) with the higher specific surface area can contribute more absorbing active sites and improve the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 5b presents the recycling photocatalytic hydrogen evolution to test the stability of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) under the visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres was respectively 115.7, 113.1, 113.6, 116.9, and 109.3 μmol h−1 g−1L−1 for the five cycles. To further examine the stability of the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) was investigated by XRD analysis before (Fig. 3f) and after (Fig. S5) photocatalytic reactions. The position and intensity of the XRD peaks were almost similar to the fresh photocatalysts. This result indicates that the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres exhibited high stability and reusability during the long time of photocatalytic processes. The photodegradation of as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated through rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible-light irradiation (100 W blue light LED lamp, λmax =465 nm), and the degradation curves were shown in Fig. 6 a. The photocatalytic efficiency of blank (without photocatalysts), as-prepared photocatalysts (MoS2 sub-microspheres and MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres with different weights of citric acid), and commercial p25 TiO2 nanopowders were 12.8 (blank), 66.4 (MoS2 sub-microspheres), 79.3 (0.04 g citric acid), 93.4 (0.08 g citric acid), 98.9 (0.1 g citric acid), 88.6 (0.2 g citric acid), and 19.1 % (TiO2 nanopowders), respectively. The photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) exhibited superior compared with MoS2 sub-microspheres and MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres with other weight of citric acid. The reaction rate constant (k) calculated by using the following first-order reaction model [34,35]: −ln(C/C0 ) = kt where C0 and C were the concentrations of RhB before and after visible-light irradiation, respectively. The corresponding kinetic plots were present in Fig. 6b. The reaction constants were calculated to be 0.00067 (blank), 0.0061 (MoS2 sub-microspheres), 0.0091 (0.04 g citric acid), 0.0149 (0.08 g citric acid), 0.0358 (0.1 g citric acid), 0.0121 (0.2 g citric acid), and 0.00089 (TiO2 nanopowders) min−1, respectively. MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) revealed almost 5.9 and 40.2 times higher than that of MoS2 sub-microspheres and TiO2 nanopowders, respectively. These results further confirmed that the present MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) were high-performance visible-light-driven photocatalysts in the degradation of RhB solution. Fig. 6c shows the recycling photodegradation of the RhB solution to test the stability of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) under the visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) was respectively 98.9, 92.5, 92.8, 92.5, and 90.6 % for the five cycles. After the recyclability tests, the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres revealed an insignificant decrease (∼8.4 %). The results prove that the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres were very stable during the long time of photocatalytic processes. In order to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism in the photodegradation process of the RhB solution, there were three kinds of radical scavengers added into photocatalytic reaction. In the present work, triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and l-ascorbic acid (AA) were used as radical scavengers to quench holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (·OH), and superoxide radical anions (·O2–), respectively [36–38]. The decrease in the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) can use to evaluate the importance of radical scavengers. Fig. 7 a shows the variation of photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres (0.1 g citric acid) was accompanied by the addition of three kinds of radical scavengers. It is evident that with no radical scavengers, the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres was 93.6 %. When the reaction solution added radical scavengers of TEOA, IPA, and AA, the photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres decreased to 61.3, 70.9, and 64.9, respectively. The possible mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting and degradation of RhB solution on the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres under visible-light irradiation is shown in Fig. 7b. The bandgap values of MoS2 (1.58 eV) and SnO2 (3.49 eV) could be estimated by plotting Tauc’s equation (Fig. S6), which are in good agreement with the previous work [35,39,40]. The valence band and conduction band of MoS2 were 1.095 eV and –0.485 eV (vs. vacuum), respectively [39]. The valence band and conduction band of SnO2 were 3.35 eV and –0.14 eV (vs. vacuum), respectively [35,40]. For MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres, when the MoS2 sub-microspheres harvested visible light, the photogenerated electrons of MoS2 would transfer to the conduction band of SnO2. Therefore, the electrons located in the conduction band of SnO2 could react with dissolved oxygen molecules (O2) to form superoxide radicals (·O2–). Also, the photogenerated holes of MoS2 could react with the hydroxide ion (OH–) derived from water (H2O) to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Superoxide radicals (·O2–) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were active substances, which could contribute to the degradation of the RhB solution. The other factor responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance was the higher specific surface areas of the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres. Therefore, highly active visible-light photocatalyst could be achieved by SnO2 modified MoS2."
5,Conclusion,"This paper presents a simple two-step hydrothermal processes for the growth of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres. The weight of citric acid can not only increase the specific surface area of MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres but also improve their photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. Furthermore, the MoS2@SnO2 core-shell sub-microspheres also revealed excellent photocatalytic recyclability and stability for prolonged photocatalytic reactions. It is believed that this work can open up a cost-effective and facile way for fabricating high-performance visible-light-driven photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production and photodegradation."
