0,Introduction,"The excessive dependence on fossil fuels and development in the world leads to the serious worldwide shortage of fossil energy. Therefore, renewable energy, such as solar power, wind power, biomass and hydrogen fuel cells ... etc. will replace fossil energy. In which, hydrogen fuel combustion does not produce greenhouse gases and can release large amounts of heat, it is even considered as the most forward-looking of alternative fuels [1]. The substrate used in anaerobic fermentation for hydrogen production is mostly glucose, starch and sucrose [2,3]. Because the expensive cost of applying raw materials for biological hydrogen production is not cost-effective, molasses fermentation waste is used in this study as the non-food material source for anaerobic hydrogen production by concentrated molasses fermentation waste to greatly reduce the raw materials cost of hydrogen production and can reach wastewater treatment. However, for anaerobic hydrogen production, although many papers [4–6] pointed out that high-rate anaerobic fermentation hydrogen production can be achieved by the use of high-rate hydrogen production reactor, the equipment costs are very expensive, and the reactor system for internal control system have no in-depth study even though hydrogen-environment factors of high-rate hydrogen production reactor and operating conditions are known. Thus, a number of bio-hydrogen production systems are mentioned in the past literature [7], proposed a UASB (up-& flow anaerobic sludge blanket, UASB) continuous hydrogen production system, but the system does not contain pH value control [8]. Proposed a continuously stirred anaerobic bioreactor, CSABR. Although the biological hydrogen production still has 5%–10% range of subtle changes in a stable state of the environment, such changes will result in power system output changes and cause voltage fluctuations at rated power range. Therefore, this paper will apply fuzzy control theory to aim at the past biomass hydrogen production model plant system for the best optimize of environmental factors pH value and temperature control at the same time and establish the bio-hydrogen production real-time fuzzy control system to greatly reduce equipment costs. Furthermore, fuzzy controller is now currently successfully applied in various fields. In literature of the past [9], linked a fuzzy controller with neural network application to hydrogen fuel generator system [10], proposed the link of Active Suspension System of fuzzy controller and detection of the robot application [11] ... and so on. Fuzzy control technology which can have effective and accurate control is quite advanced. It can reach the optimization of system control easily and reduce the difficulty of hardware devices designed to the equipment. Therefore, this article will demonstrate through experiments. By the comparison of the proposed system and the system proposed in the past, we design the system which can immediately record all data for two environmental factors of pH value and temperature in response tank for dynamic specialty measurement and real-time optimization of parameters monitoring to achieve the best growing environment and hydrogen production rate control as well as enhance hydrogen production. Section 3 introduces the application of fuzzy control theory. Section 4 includes experiment frameworks of biomass fermentation real-time control system and Section 5 presents the conclusions."
1,Characteristics of biomass hydrogen production,"The main hydrogen production currently in life can be divided into three categories, namely thermochemistry, biomass and electrochemical. In which, biomass hydrogen production, whose theory is to transform biomass, waste and organic substances in wastewater into hydrogen by microbial decomposition of organic materials is the novel technology in the last few years. However, the wide variety of hydrogen production and process includes photosynthesis that contains direct photolysis and indirect photolysis and fermentation that contains light and dark fermentation. Photosynthesis and light fermentation require solar energy or light source to produce hydrogen with limitation of light intensity and wavelength that affect the chemical reactions. However, dark fermentation is not restricted by the problem of O2, and it's able to apply a variety of carbon sources as a substrate, such as: starch, xylems, sugar ... etc. with the advantage that hydrogen production can be carried out day and night without light source restrictions. So biomass hydrogen production by dark fermentation would be adopted in this paper. Dark fermentation hydrogen production generally mostly exist in microbial sludge, hot springs, cattle stomach and swamps and other places to transform the following organic material into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and other metabolites in the anaerobic environment. Theoretically, the 1 mol decomposed glucose can produce 4 mol hydrogen as formula [1]: (1) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOH + 4 H 2 + 2 CO 2 ( Δ G 0 = − 49.3 kJ ) Theoretically, when butyric acid turns out to be the end product, the 1 mol decomposed glucose can produce 2 mol hydrogen as formula [2]: (2) C 6 H 12 O 6 → CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 + 2 CO 2 ( Δ G 0 = − 60.9 kJ ) The following would present individual description of calculation of dark fermentation hydrogen production microbial environmental factor and hydrogen production."
2,"The environmental factors, pH value and temperature","2.1 The environmental factors, pH value and temperature All microbial growth has its suitable habitat. They can achieve the maximum growth rate when they are in the best conditions in the environment, but vice versa when they are not conducive to microbial growth. In which, the growth environment factors affecting anaerobic dark fermentation are external physical conditions such as pH value, temperature, and ... etc. pH value has a great impact on the growth of micro-organisms, thus each species has its specific range of growth, as well as the most suitable growth range. Regardless of habitat changes in pH value, the extent of most of the microorganism is still close to neutral pH values. If there is violent change in the pH value in the microbial growth environment, microbial growth rate will definitely be affected. Therefore, pH value can determine micro-organisms' multiplication and the growth rate in the environment. In the operating temperature of anaerobic digestion hydrogen production, the process of microbial metabolism is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction including substrate utilization and self-degradation of biochemical reactions that are influenced by ambient temperature. By the temperature range of beneficial micro-organisms growth, they can be divided into psychrophilic (0–20 °C), mesophilic (20–45 °C) and thermophilic (47–70 °C). The temperature range (20–45 °C) of clostridium group of which can have a more stable operation and better buffering capacity toward a sudden rise or drop in temperature at the same time."
3,The calculation of substrate utilization and hydrogen production,"2.2 The calculation of substrate utilization and hydrogen production Substrate calculation of bio-hydrogen production reactor is called total sugar conversion that shows the better Substrate conversion rate in the reactor by the higher utilization and the determination of the current hydrogen production operation quality. The consumption of every 1 g of moles of hydrogen transformed from each Substrate will be defined as the yield of hydrogen. Substrate utilization is calculated as follows [3]: (3) substrate utilization ( total COD conversion , % ) = feed substrate concentration ( g COD / L ) - output substrate concentration ( g COD / L ) feed substrate concentration ( g COD / L ) × 100 % Hydrogen production is calculated as follows [4]: (4) Hydrogen proguction ( H 2 Yield , mole H 2 / g COD Subtrate ) = Hydrogen moles substrate consumption = ( hydrogen productionrate ( h / d ) 24 ( h / d ) × 24 . 5 ( L / mole ) ) substrate concentration ( g COD / L ) ×HRT ( L / h ) ×substrate utilization% In ambient temperature and pressure (NTP), 1 mol gas volume is 24.5 l; HRT is the hydraulic retention time. In anaerobic fermentation hydrogen production process, hydrogen bacteria will decompose the organic matter of molecules to produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide and other small organic molecules (such as volatile acids and alcohols, etc.). Since methane bacteria are removed in part of the methanation, a big amount of product accumulation will be caused due to the absence of solid methane bacteria to break down organic molecules continuously. However, when there is excessive product accumulation in the reactor bucket, product inhibition phenomenon will be resulted in. Furthermore, different species have different needs toward the growth environment to achieve the best growth rate and maximum biological yield only under the most suitable environmental conditions. Under normal circumstances, we can not precisely control the two environmental factors of pH value and temperature, which will lead to microbial growth environment restrictions and the possible decline of hydrogen production rate. Nevertheless, even with high-efficiency hydrogen production facilities, there are still a total of 5%–10% hydrogen production subtle changes that will also cause the upgrading cost of equipments. For these reasons, we will add fuzzy control technology in to maintain optimum hydrogen production with the best pH value and temperature control. The following will be the setting introduction of fuzzy control theory."
4,Fuzzy control theory,"Fuzzy control is constructed based on intelligent control method of expert rules with the advantages of great flexibility, replication of arbitrary complex nonlinear functions, inclusion of expertise, abilities to combine traditional control techniques, base on natural language and close to human thinking compared to other control methods. The method of fuzzy controller is to first define the different range and control through operational analysis, rather than setting an input value with an output one. Therefore, this study will adopt fuzzy control theory to have different substrate with different strains and different reactions in bio-hydrogen production reactor system. By adopting fuzzy controller in fermentation control system of model plant, the time required to set the parameters in order to improve the stability and reliability of fermentation control system at operating mode field would be saved. The following will be the introduction of the planned fuzzy controller module design flow of the real-time control system. (1) Definition input: First, we must define the pH value and temperature as input variables with the first input variable name of fuzzy control as pH, the input range as 0–6.5, and the characteristic pattern divided into four ranges: too acid, acid, slightly acid and optimization. Then, define the name of the second input variable as temperature (°C), the input range of 0–50, and feature type divided into four ranges: too cold, cold, optimization and hot. If the best internal growth environment in the reactor is desired, the input membership functions range of pH should be from 5.5 to 6.5 and the input membership function range of the temperature should be 30–40 (°C). The established membership functions of input variables (pH, temperature) are shown in Fig. 1 . (2) Output variables: After the completion of the input variables setting, we will define the output variable with the purpose to achieve the best control of environmental factors. The first output variable is RPM with the output range from 0 to 100 and the characteristic pattern is divided into four ranges: optimization, low, medium and high. The second output variable is the on and off state of the heater with the output range of 0–1 and characteristic patterns divided into two ranges: on and off. The established the membership function of output variables (running speed of a feeding pump and the heater) is shown in Fig. 2 . (3) The establishment of fuzzy rule database: The fuzzy rule database is built for the control system, as shown in Fig. 3 . To enable the system's normal operation, fuzzy rule database, which is corresponding to an individual output for the two inputs, is designed specially for the feeding pump and heater respectively to ensure system stability. (4) Simulations of fuzzy inference: It is to decide the output characteristic patterns by computing the two input characteristic function membership degree. Fig. 4 simulated the fuzzy inference for the feeding pump operating speed, and Fig. 5 simulated the fuzzy inference for the on and off of the heater."
5,The fuzzy control module in a biomass hydrogen production control system,"Fig. 6 presents the architecture diagram of a real-time fuzzy control biomass fermentation hydrogen production experiment system in this work. There are two 1 L reactors, which are one reactor joined the fuzzy control system but not the other one, set in the experiment with a continuous record of six days of the hydrogen production status. We had planned two inputs, which are real-time control of pH and temperature and outputs which are feeding pump and heater accordingly by adopting a fuzzy controller for planning individual input and output character type membership degree and solving fuzzy set by functions of fuzzy operations and inference functions to control the feeding pump and heater for output, and thus achieve the design requirements of desired environmental factor control and the ideal reaction conditions. By capturing pH and temperature signals in the reactor to the computer for the completion of detection and reading process to allow fuzzy controller module to carry out function computing and then control the status of the feed pump and heater. The experimental equipment operation conditions of biological hydrogen production model plant in this study are shown in Fig. 7 with system performing steps as the following: Step 1: Design data acquisition program with real-time measurements of pH and temperature in the reactor. Step 2: Set pH value as the first fuzzy input variables. Step 3: Set temperature as the second fuzzy input variables. Step 4: Input the two input variables to the fuzzy controller to produce the fuzzy output variables of the feeding pump speed and on and off status of the heater. Step 5: Add the function of data storage and read for real-time monitoring and recording of system operation. Step 6: Continue the input and output fuzzy control to maintain the ideal environmental condition in the reactor. Once the monitoring system begin to control, the feed pump and heater will start running and working to produce hydrogen in the reaction tank, if pH value and temperature not achieved the desired value as shown in Fig. 8 .When the monitoring system stops to control, the pH value and temperature acquisition would be done as usual to display the wave pattern changes and immediate value in the set time, the feeding pump and the heater will stop working, and the right stop light would be on. When monitoring system control starts, the feed pump and heater will start operation if the pH value and temperature have not yet reached the ideal value to display the output waveform changes and immediate value within the set time and the current operation condition of the feeding pump and heater. If the pH value or temperature has achieved the desired value, the feeding pump and heater will stop the operation respectively. Furthermore, all information would be stored for future reading and analysis. During the system implementation, all real-time data and the performance of the feeding pump and heater would be monitored. The system data record is as shown in Fig. 9 ."
6,Results and discussion,"The results show that, pH value range is set as 5.5 in the input variables. However, the actual pH value in the reaction tank is mostly between 5.49 and 5.495 with variable range of ±0.04 or less. Temperature range is set at 35 (°C) with variable range of ±0.4 (°C) or less. Compared to the pH value, the temperature variation cycle in reaction tank is shorter but acid and alkali value variable period is longer. Therefore, a long-time observation is needed to identify pH changes in the reaction tank. For the operation conditions of the controlled instruments, the operating speed variables of the feeding pump is about 5.5 rpm–0 rpm. The operating speed of the feeding pump is about 5.5 rpm until the pH value reaches 5.5 in the reaction tank to stop the feeding pump. The operating speed would be 0. For on and off variables of the heater, it means the heater is heating the reaction tank when the value is 1, but stops the heating when it shows 0. It leads the success of maintaining the environment factors in the best condition. In the fermentation reaction tank of the experiments, hydrogen production record is as shown in Fig. 10 that gas produced in the reactor is multiplied by the percentage of hydrogen. The generated gas through dark fermentation in the reaction tank is not pure hydrogen but contains with gas elements such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The proportion of hydrogen would be known after analyzing the gases produced in the reaction tank by the gas analyzer. Fig. 10 shows that the highest hydrogen production rate in the reactor with the control system is 13.44 L/D on the sixth day, while the maximum hydrogen production rate in the reactor without the control system appeared 3.12 L/D on the third day. Fig. 11 shows that, hydrogen production in the reactor with fuzzy control system is 22.95 L totally, and hydrogen production rate in the reactor in the past system is 5.59 L totally."
7,Conclusion,"In order to improve the existing biomass hydrogen production system, this study uses fuzzy control technology added to fermentation plant model and design a real-time control system with automatic data logging and operation control. The experiment results presents that the 6-day total hydrogen production is 5.59 L in the reactor without fuzzy control and 22.95 L in the reactor with fuzzy control. With the above results, pH value are successfully remained at a satisfactory rate of 5.5 ± 0.04 and temperature range is maintained in the ideal value of 35 °C ± 0.4° in the system to accurately and effectively control the feeding pump and heater. It can be learned that molasses fermentation waste hydrogen production can be significantly enhanced by the environmental factors, pH and temperature effectively controlling in the ideal range. The improvement of total hydrogen production rate has been confirmed that the control system has the capability to enhance hydrogen production and effectively reduce the cost of hydrogen production."
