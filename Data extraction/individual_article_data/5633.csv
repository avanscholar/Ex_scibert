0,Introduction,"Biofuels are an attractive solution to the energy crisis and global warming because they are renewable and carbon neutral [1–3]. Unlike first-generation biofuels that are produced from food crops, second-generation processes produce liquid biofuels from lignocellulose to prevent competition with food [4]. Lignocellulose can be converted into liquid fuels using three major platforms: thermochemical platform (gasify biomass to syngas, which is catalytically transformed into fuels), sugar platform (enzymes convert biomass into simple sugars, which are fermented to ethanol), and the carboxylate platform (an open culture transforms biomass to carboxylate salts, which can be chemically converted to fuels). The carboxylate platform has the highest product yields in the literature [5]. Anaerobic digestion of lignocellulose by the carboxylate platform usually has four stages: hydrolysis (hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars), acidogenesis (ferment sugars into carboxylic acids, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), acetogenesis (ferment the higher acids into acetic acid), and methanogenesis (ferment acetic and the higher acids into methane) [6]. In fermentation systems, compared to ethanol and other alcohols, carboxylic acids are thermodynamically favored when methane production is inhibited. Furthermore, sterile conditions are not required. Also, an open culture utilizes all biodegradable biomass components (e.g., lignocellulose, starch, protein, and pectin), which increases yield. The ability to utilize varied biomass components under non-sterile conditions – and still achieve high product yields – makes the carboxylate platform economically attractive. The MixAlco™ process is an example of the carboxylate platform [6]. In the MixAlco process, biomass is anaerobically fermented to produce many different products, such as salts of acetic, propionic, butyric, and caproic acids. The acids or the salts can be purified and sold individually, or used as precursors to industrial chemicals or biofuels. The carboxylate mixture is typically dilute, which may require large amounts of energy in downstream processes that concentrate the product, and hence significantly increases the cost of desired products [7]. Furthermore, acetic acid is the primary component of the produced carboxylic acids, which has low energy content compared to medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) (In this paper, short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs): C2–C3; MCCAs: C4–C6). Many factors (e.g., pH, temperature, type of feed, organic load, batch or continuous mode of operation) affect the product distribution and concentration, and therefore should be investigated. The composition of headspace gas is one such factor that can affect fermentation pathways, and hence the product concentration and distribution. The literature indicates that headspace hydrogen and carbon dioxide concentrations can energetically suppress or favor certain pathways and alter product concentrations to favor particular products. Some previous studies reported the effect of headspace gas on anaerobic fermentation, but mainly focused on producing biohydrogen [8,9]. Arslan et al. [7] supplied hydrogen and carbon dioxide, or mixtures thereof, to the headspace during open-culture fermentation and investigated their effect on the concentration and distribution of the carboxylate products. The substrates used in their study were organic waste streams (vegetables, meat, and oil), which contained little cellulose or hemicellulose [7,10], the main components of lignocellulosic biomass. The previous study indicated that the product type and concentrations were not only determined by either the effect of hydrogen and carbon dioxide added to the headspace or the effect of substrates, but also by the combined effect of the two factors [7]. To the best of our knowledge, using lignocellulosic biomass as a substrate, the effect of headspace gas composition on carboxylate formation has not previously been reported in the literature. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of hydrogen and carbon dioxide compositions in the headspace of open-culture fermentation of raw corn stover (80%, dry-weight basis) and chicken manure (20%, dry-weight basis). The aim is to improve carboxylate yields and direct the open-culture fermentation toward MCCAs, which have higher energy content."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Substrates,"2.1 Substrates Raw corn stover was harvested in 2010 and provided by AgriLife, the agricultural college at Texas A&M University. The freshly harvested corn stover had a moisture content of 30% (wet basis). It was then air dried in the laboratory to a moisture content of 10% (wet basis). The air-dried raw corn stover was used in the fermentations without pretreatment. Chicken manure supplied the trace nutrients and minerals source in all the fermentations. Wet chicken manure was supplied by Feather Crest Farms, Inc. It was air dried in the laboratory to a moisture content less than 10% (wet basis)."
3,Inoculum preparation fermentation,"2.2 Inoculum preparation fermentation The original inoculum was an open culture of marine microorganisms obtained from beach sediment in Galveston Island, TX. A 1-m-deep hole was dug at the waterline on the beach. Sediment was removed from the bottom of the hole and immediately placed in an airtight plastic bottle filled with deoxygenated water, 0.275 g L−1 cysteine hydrochloride, and 0.275 g L−1 sodium sulfide to minimize microbial oxygen exposure, and then frozen at −20 °C. Before use, the samples were thawed, shaken, and settled by gravity. The supernatant was taken for inoculum preparation fermentation, which was performed to allow the bacteria to adapt to the substrate and the conditions. The reaction conditions (listed in Table 1 ) of inoculum preparation fermentation were almost the same as the headspace gas experiments (Section 2.4). After 15 days of incubation, the fermentation broth from this inoculum preparation fermentation was used as adapted inoculum for the headspace gas experiments. Use of adapted inoculum to particular substrates ensured uniform results every time."
4,Stainless steel fermentors,"2.3 Stainless steel fermentors Stainless steel fermentors are used in the headspace gas experiments because they are suitably impermeable, which retains hydrogen gas. In this experiment, the 1-L stainless steel fermentors (Fig. 1 ) were made from a 15.24-cm length of 10.16-cm SCH 10 pipe with 0.32-cm thick stainless steel plate welded to either end. The top plate of the fermentor has a 5.08-cm hole where a quick-connect fitting is welded. A 5.08-cm gasket and cap are placed onto the fitting and held in place by a tightened clamp."
5,Open-culture batch fermentations (headspace gas experiments),"2.4 Open-culture batch fermentations (headspace gas experiments) Batch fermentations were performed with four different gas compositions in the headspace at 2.05 × 105 Pa (abs) in duplicates. The different gas compositions used in the headspace were pure hydrogen, pure carbon dioxide, hydrogen:carbon dioxide (1:1), and pure nitrogen. Table 1 shows the experimental set-up for batch fermentations. The total fermentation broth volume was 400 cm3 in the 1-L stainless steel fermentors. The substrate loading in each fermentor was 100 g L−1 slurry with 80% raw corn stover and 20% chicken manure. To inhibit methanogens, 50 mm³ of iodoform solution (20 g L−1 95% ethanol (volume basis)) was added to each fermentor. Deoxygenated water was added to bring the volume to 400 cm3 in each fermentor and incubated at 40 °C for 35 days in a rotary incubator at 0.21 rad s−1. For the first two weeks, each fermentor was vented daily because of the high initial digestion rate; thereafter, each fermentor was vented every two days [11]. Liquid samples were taken to be analyzed for carboxylic acid concentrations using the gas chromatograph (GC). Also, MgCO3 was added as a solid powder every day for the first seven days and every two days thereafter to control the pH of the fermentations near neutrality (7.00–7.10). Iodoform solution (50 mm3) was only added if there was a methane peak observed in the GC of the headspace gas sample after the first day. The respective headspace gases were filled again to 2.05 × 105 Pa (abs) before returning them to the incubator. The schematic diagram of the whole process is shown in Fig. 2 ."
6,Fermentation headspace gas analysis,"2.5 Fermentation headspace gas analysis Gas (e.g., hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane) is produced as fermentations proceed and must be removed from the fermentors to relieve pressure buildup and prevent fermentor rupture. Gas composition was measured and methane was monitored by manually injecting a 5-cm3 gas sample into an Agilent 7890A Series GC system with a thermal conductivity detector."
7,Carboxylic acids analysis,"2.6 Carboxylic acids analysis For the first three days, fermentation liquid samples (1 cm3) were collected every day; thereafter, samples were collected every other day for all experiments. Centrifuged (1361 rad s−1, 10 min) fermentation liquid was mixed with equal parts of internal standard (1.162 g L−1 4-methyl-n-valeric acid) and 3 mol L−1 phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and then ultra-centrifuged again (1361 rad s−1, 10 min). The H3PO4 ensures that the carboxylate salts are converted into carboxylic acids prior to analysis. The carboxylic acid concentration was measured using a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Agilent 7683 automatic liquid sampler. A 30-m fused-silica capillary column (J&W Scientific Model # 123–3232) was used. The column head pressure was maintained at 2.05 × 105 Pa (abs). After each sample injection, the GC temperature program raised the temperature from 40 to 200 °C at 20 °C·min−1. The temperature was subsequently held at 200 °C for 2 min. The total run time per sample was 16 min. Helium was the carrier gas."
8,Calculations,"2.7 Calculations The performance of each batch fermentation was evaluated using the total carboxylic acid concentration, yield, conversion, and selectivity parameters, which are defined as follows: (1) Y i e l d = t o t a l c a r b o x y l i c a c i d s p r o d u c e d ( g ) v o l a t i l e s o l i d s f e d ( g ) (2) C o n v e r s i o n = v o l a t i l e s o l i d s d i g e s t e d ( g ) v o l a t i l e s o l i d s f e d ( g ) (3) S e l e c t i v i t y = t o t a l c a r b o x y l i c a c i d s p r o d u c e d ( g ) v o l a t i l e s o l i d s d i g e s t e d ( g ) To compare the energy content of the acids produced under different headspace gas compositions, the obtained acid concentrations were converted to acetic acid equivalents (Aceq). The Aceq unit is based on the reducing power of the produced acids. Converting total acid concentrations to Aceq expresses each acid on a common basis according to energy content, and therefore compares the energy content of the produced mixed acids under different headspace gas compositions [12]. On a mole basis, acetic acid equivalent (α) is calculated from the mixed acid concentrations as described by Fu and Holtzapple [12]: (4) α ( m o l · L − 1 ) = 1.0 ( a c e t i c ) + 1.75 ( p r o p i o n i c ) + 2.5 ( b u t y r i c ) + 3.25 ( v a l e r i c ) + 4.0 ( c a p r o i c ) + 4.75 ( h e p t a n o i c ) On a mass basis, the acetic acid equivalent (Aceq) can be expressed as (5) A c e q ( g · L − 1 ) = 60.05 ( g · m o l − 1 ) × α ( m o l · L − 1 )"
9,Results and discussion,"The fermentations were performed for 35 days, which is sufficiently long for the fermentation to be “complete.” Fig. 3 shows total acid concentrations as a function of time under different headspace gas conditions. Compared to the nitrogen control, adding hydrogen (pure or mixed) in the headspace, higher total acid concentrations were shown after Day 13, which is consistent with Arslan et al. [7] who used organic wastes as substrates. In contrast, adding pure carbon dioxide in the headspace, lower total acid concentrations were shown after Day 5, which is inconsistent with Arslan et al. [7] who showed that adding pure carbon dioxide (2 × 105 Pa) enhanced the total acid concentrations compared to the nitrogen control. Fig. 4 shows the 35-day acid concentrations in the fermentations with different gas compositions. The fermentor with nitrogen in the headspace had an Aceq of 28.6 g L−1. Adding pure hydrogen slightly enhanced Aceq (32.4 g L−1). In contrast, adding pure carbon dioxide slightly reduced Aceq (27.4 g L−1). Adding hydrogen + carbon dioxide had the highest Aceq (36.8 g L−1), which is 29% more than the nitrogen fermentor. Compared to the nitrogen control, adding hydrogen (pure or mixed) increased the acetic acid concentration. In contrast, adding pure carbon dioxide reduced the acetic acid concentration. In all fermentors, the propionic acid concentrations are similar. The fermentors with added gases are slightly enriched in butyric acid. Compared to the nitrogen control, adding carbon dioxide (pure or mixed) enhanced the caproic acid concentration whereas adding pure hydrogen had no impact. Table 2 shows the percent change of individual carboxylic acids (acetic, propionic, butyric, caproic) and Aceq in the hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen + carbon dioxide fermentors as compared to the nitrogen fermentor. Adding pure hydrogen in the headspace increased the Aceq production by 13%, but did not change the product spectrum considerably. The pure carbon dioxide fermentor showed a modest decrease (4%) in the Aceq, but had 20% higher butyric acid (C4) and 99% higher caproic acid (C6) production. Thus, adding pure carbon dioxide in the headspace shifted the carboxylic acid spectrum towards MCCAs. Previous studies [7,8] reported that the activity of acetogens, which produce acetate from butyrate, were inhibited when the carbon dioxide partial pressure was high (e.g., 7 × 104 Pa). In this study, the headspace pressure of carbon dioxide was 2.05 × 105 Pa, so the inhibition effect of carbon dioxide on acetogens must be very high, which might explain why the produced carboxylic acid spectrum was shifted. Because carbon dioxide is inexpensive and readily available, it can be used to direct the fermentation toward MCCAs. Besides the highest Aceq production, the fermentor with hydrogen + carbon dioxide showed the highest acetate production, which might be due to homoacetogens that produce acetate from hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the headspace (2 CO2 + 4H2 → acetate− + H+ + 2H2O [7]). Furthermore, it had 1.6 g L−1 of caproic (C6) acid, which is 187% higher than the nitrogen fermentor. Table 3 summarizes the total carboxylic acid concentration, yield, conversion, and selectivity with different headspace gas compositions. Compared with the nitrogen control, adding pure hydrogen enhanced yield (12%), had no impact on conversion, and enhanced selectivity (12%). This is because the reducing power of hydrogen allows naturally produced carbon dioxide to be converted to acids without affecting biomass digestion. Compared to the nitrogen control, adding pure carbon dioxide suppressed conversion (24%) and yield (3%) while increasing selectivity (27%). This is because carbon dioxide suppresses the fermentation so less biomass is digested; however, a greater portion of that which is digested in converted to acids. Presumably, the added carbon dioxide reacts with naturally produced hydrogen to make acids. Compared with the nitrogen control, adding a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide enhanced yield (45%), conversion (21%), and selectivity (20%). By adding reducing power (hydrogen) and a carbon source (carbon dioxide), it is not surprising that the yield and selectivity both increased. However, it is surprising that the conversion increased as well. This is because this gas mixture enhances the ability of the microorganisms to digest biomass."
10,Conclusions,"Adding hydrogen in the headspace increased the Aceq production by 13%, but did not change the product spectrum considerably. Adding carbon dioxide in the fermentor headspace reduced the Aceq by 4%, but shifted the acid spectrum towards MCCAs. The price of bulk gaseous carbon dioxide can be as low as $3 per metric tonne [13]; therefore, carbon dioxide can be used for this purpose without significant additional costs. Adding hydrogen:carbon dioxide (1:1) in the fermentor headspace increased Aceq production by 29%."
