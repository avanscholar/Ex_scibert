0,Introduction,"Plastics are used in a wide variety of applications in daily life and industrial sectors. It has been reported that approximately 335 million tons of plastic products were produced worldwide in 2016, while over 20 wt% (77 million tons) were produced in China alone [1,2]. Among these plastic products, many have a short life and become part of the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream, where most may be incinerated or disposed to landfills [3], with only 9% being recycled [4]. There are diverse types of waste plastics found in MSW. Polyolefin plastics account for the highest fraction, comprising 20 wt% polypropylene (PP), 17.4 wt% high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and 20.6 wt% low-density polyethylene (LDPE) [5]. In addition, high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) and general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) are also commonly found in MSW [5,6]. These waste plastics have caused serious wastage of resources and environmental problems. The effective transformation and utilisation of waste plastics has aroused extensive attention [7]. There is an increasing interest in the thermal conversion of waste plastics into high-value products [8], and pyrolysis–catalysis is considered to be a promising technology for waste plastic utilisation [9–12]. Different tests have been reported in the literature that converted various types of plastics into high-value-added products, such as synthesis gas [13–15], liquid chemicals [16–18], or carbon nanomaterials [19–21]. Saad et al. [22] focused on syngas products, and they found that PS exhibited better yields during the pyrolytic-catalytic reforming of various types of waste plastics. Similar results were obtained from Yao et al. [23]. Compared with PP or HDPE, the highest syngas yield was obtained from PS after reforming reactions. In contrast, Escola et al. [24] gathered more gasoline and light diesel from PP rather than LDPE or HDPE in the presence of a Ni/H-beta catalyst. However, Marcilla et al. [25] collected more aromatics from HDPE than LDPE. In addition, carbon nanomaterials recycled from plastic waste are also attracting attention. For example, Aboul-Enein et al. [26] revealed that fewer carbon nanotubes with high quality were obtained from PP rather than from other plastics. In addition, the distribution and quality of the products from plastic pyrolysis–catalysis are also highly dependent on the selective catalysts. Nickel-based catalysts are typically used for syngas production. Wu et al. [15] and Yao et al. [27] achieved important syngas yields with a high volume fraction of hydrogen from PP plastics in the presence of nickel-based catalysts. Molecular sieves are used for producing liquid products, especially monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). For example, Park et al. [28] produced over 26 wt% monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis–catalysis of PS. More recently, activated carbon catalysts were found to be suitable for jet fuel production [17,29]. In addition, iron-based catalysts exhibit better results accounting for carbon deposition, which is due to the favourable carbon solubility and higher carbon diffusion rate of iron nanoparticles as well as the appropriate strength of metal-support interactions [30,31]. Recently, researchers have invested a significant amount of resources to explore the process or mechanism of pyrolysis–catalysis plastic waste, and great progress has been made in this regard [32]. In some cases, molecular sieves are believed to be responsible for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons [33] because of the existence of acidic sites, which exacerbate the condensation polymerisation of small molecular hydrocarbons or mononuclear aromatics [34]. However, the mechanism of dissociation–diffusion–precipitation is generally accepted in cases of metal presence [35–37]. The small molecular hydrocarbons from plastic pyrolysis are first dissociated by metal nanoparticles, and the carbon produced by the dissociation reaction subsequently dissolves into metal particles [38]. Once supersaturated, carbon precipitates from the nanoparticles to form CNTs. At the same time, hydrogen atoms from the dissociation reaction are mainly released in the form of hydrogen. However, some different results were obtained. For instance, Aboul-Enein et al. [39] believed that PS was not suitable for producing CNTs owing to its low yield and quality, which was related to the aromatic hydrocarbon released during the thermal degradation of PS. However, Teblum et al. [40] concluded that one-ring compounds such as styrene from PS positively affected CNT growth. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the correlation mechanism between plastic structure and products, and the competitive mechanism among products remains unclear. To realise the high value utilisation of waste plastics, it is vital to understand the relationship between the structure of raw materials plastics and the composition of products. Therefore, to further identify the thermal conversion process and possible reaction mechanism of different types of waste plastics, five typical waste plastics (PP, LDPE, HDPE, HIPS, and GPPS) were used as raw materials in the presence of an Fe-based catalyst. The yield and composition of the gaseous and liquid products and the morphological structure and quality of the obtained carbon nanomaterials were investigated in depth. Finally, the possible reaction mechanisms for the catalytic conversion process of different types of plastics were proposed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The plastic samples were PP, HDPE, LDPE, HIPS, and GPPS, obtained from Mingjin Plastic Ltd., China, and included processed plastic wrapping, drink cups, and lunch boxes. The corresponding proximate and ultimate analysis results of the plastics are presented in Table 1 . As can be seen, waste plastics contained very high volatile matter content (over 99.5 wt%) and limited fixed carbon and ash. In addition, higher carbon and hydrogen contents were detected for different plastic wastes. To be exact, PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed higher H content (~14 wt%) but lower carbon content (~81 wt%). HIPS and GPPS showed higher carbon content (over 91 wt% C), but less H (~7 wt%). The catalyst preparation used iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)39H2O, ≥98.50%) and nano-aluminium oxide (Al2O3, ≥99.99%) with a particle size of 10 nm were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (China). Absolute ethyl alcohol (≥99.7%) and acetone (≥99.50%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The Fe-based catalyst was used for the pyrolysis–catalysis experiments due to its favourable catalytic activity, and was prepared using an impregnation method according to our previous work [41]. Briefly, 0.72 g of FeNO3 9H2O was dissolved in 30 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol with continuous stirring until it was completely dissolved, and 0.9 g of nano-Al2O3 was introduced into the iron salt solution to ensure an Fe loading content of 10 wt% was achieved. The solution mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at a temperature of 50 °C until the solution became a slurry. Then, the slurry was dried in an oven for 12 h at a temperature of 105 °C to remove the absolute ethyl alcohol. The obtained dry solid was ground into small particles between 0.08 and 0.16 mm, followed by calcination at a final temperature of 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere in a muffle furnace. After natural cooling to room temperature (~25 °C), the produced Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was collected. Notably, the catalyst was reduced in situ rather than prior to its utilisation."
3,Pyrolysis–catalysis experimental system,"2.2 Pyrolysis–catalysis experimental system Fig. 1 shows the experimental system of pyrolysis–catalysis of plastic waste, which includes gas supply, fixed bed quartz reactor (height of 660 mm and inner diameter of 45 mm), liquid condensation, and gas collection systems. The quartz reactor was heated by two separate electrical furnaces, each separately monitored and controlled to provide separate heated pyrolysis and catalysis zones. The pyrolytic temperature and catalytic temperature were set as 500 °C and 800 °C, respectively, due to relative low decomposition temperature of plastics [42,43] and good catalytic activity of catalysts [44], respectively. For each experiment, 0.5 g of Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was distributed evenly in the quartz crucible in the catalyst stage, which was preheated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Once the target temperature of the catalytic stage was reached, 1.0 g of the plastic sample was introduced into the pyrolysis stage. The pyrolytic stage was heated to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept isothermal for 10 min. Throughout the experiments, nitrogen was used as the purge gas with a gas flow velocity of 100 mL min−1. The reaction time for each pyrolysis–catalysis experiment was 30 min. To collect liquid oil products and gaseous products effectively, they were collected separately from repeated experiments. For the collection of gas products, an ice-water condensing system (~0 °C) was used to condense macromolecules, followed by a gas sample bag to collect gas products. Specifically, a gas sample bag was linked to the end of the condensing system as soon as the temperature in the pyrolysis stage reached 300 °C. After 30 min, the sample bag was removed and detected by gas chromatography. The exact yield was determined from the gas density and gas volume fraction after eliminating the nitrogen purge gas [45]. For liquid products, a liquid nitrogen trap (−196 °C) was used for volatile condensation. The liquid product yield was calculated from the difference between the initial and final weights of the condensate bottle in the liquid nitrogen condenser. Solid carbonaceous material deposited on the catalyst was collected for further analysis. The carbon deposition yield was determined from the weight difference of the quartz crucible holding the catalyst before and after the reaction. Each sample was tested at least three times to ensure the accuracy of the experiment, and the final results were taken from the average data of three sets with a relative error of less than 5%."
4,Characterisation of catalyst and pyrolysis–catalysis products,"2.3 Characterisation of catalyst and pyrolysis–catalysis products The freshly prepared Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was characterised in relation to its physical and chemical properties using several techniques. The surface morphology of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Gemini Sigma 300 (Carl Zeiss AG Corporation, Germany), and the test voltage was set to 2.00 kV. The crystalline structure and active metal species particle size was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips X’Pert PRO, Japan), and the scanning range and scanning speed were 10–80° 2θ and 7° min−1, respectively. The porosity properties, including the specific surface areas, total pore volumes, and pore size distributions as analysed with a nitrogen adsorption measurement system (Quantachrome IQ, China) at −196 °C using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The composition of gaseous products was determined using gas chromatography (GC) (Panna A91, China) with two different detectors: a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionisation detector (FID). Gases like H2 were detected after separation using a Porapak Q column and a 5 Å zeolite molecular sieve column with He as the carrier gas. After accounting for nitrogen, the normalised concentrations of the remaining gaseous compounds were calculated. The lower heating value (LHV) of the gaseous products was calculated using Eq. (1). (1) LHV(MJ/N m 3 ) = 0.126 × C O + 0.108 × H 2 + 0.358 × C H 4 + 0.665 × C n H m The components in the liquid product were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS, HP7890 series GC with an HP5975MS detector and an HP-5MD capillary column, Agilent, America). Helium (He) was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate for the column was set at 1 mL/min. For each test, 1 μL liquid sample was injected with a split ratio of 20:1. The initial temperature of the GC oven was 40 °C, and it was heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Subsequently, the oven temperature was maintained at 300 °C for 10 min. The concentrations of organic components were quantitatively determined using the mass spectral libraries (NIST14.L). For the characterisation of the carbon deposition on the catalyst, the surface morphology and size of the carbon nanomaterial deposits were analysed with a field-emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the reacted catalyst was performed on a Diamond TG/DTA (PerkinElmer Instruments, China) under an air atmosphere to determine the oxidation profile of the deposited carbons in relation to the TGA temperature. The crystal structure of the carbon deposition was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the size of the carbon deposition and iron particles (DC and DFe) were calculated using the Scherrer equation (Eq. (2)), based on the (002) and (110) peaks, respectively. The interlayer spacing (d002) of the carbon deposits was calculated using Bragg’s equation (Eq. (3)). Furthermore, the graphitisation degree parameter (gd) and the number of carbon layers (N) were evaluated by the interlayer spacing. In addition, the degree of graphitisation of the carbon deposits was also examined using Raman spectroscopy with Raman spectra from 800 cm−1 to 3200 cm−1 on a LabRAM HR 800 Evolution Raman instrument (Horiba JobinYvon, France) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.

5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterisation of Fe/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.1 Characterisation of Fe/Al2O3 catalysts The physical structure of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst is presented in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). As shown in Fig. 2(a), the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited type II isotherms, suggesting the widespread presence of mesopores and macropores. Notably, the rapid increase in the adsorbing capacity in high relative pressure regions was related to macroporous material [46]. Furthermore, typical H3 hysteresis loops were observed at relative pressures in the range of 0.7–0.9. H3 hysteresis loops are often observed in mesoporous materials, and they correspond to a characteristic of slit-shaped pores formed by the accumulation of flake particles [47]. The pore size distribution shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a) also reveals the existence of numerous mesopores, which is good for the catalytic reforming process [23]. In addition, the specific surface areas, total pore volumes, and average diameters of the catalyst metal particles were obtained from the nitrogen adsorption/desorption tests; they were 96.78 m2 g−1, 0.62 cm3 g−1, and 25.78 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of the fresh catalyst is shown in Fig. 2(b). The peak at 2θ = 32.8° corresponding to the (420) plane, confirmed the presence of Fe2O3 (Reference code: 00-016-0653). Several other peaks, identified at 2θ, 31.2°, 36.5°, 44.7°, 47.1°, 60.0°, and 67.3° were related to the aluminium oxide support. In addition, the average crystallite size of Fe2O3 was 26.24 nm, calculated from the peak at around 2θ, 32.8° according to the Scherrer equation. This indicates good dispersion of the active Fe species and a correct preparation through impregnation."
7,Product yield and composition analysis,"3.2 Product yield and composition analysis 3.2.1 Yield of pyrolysis–catalysis products The product yields from the pyrolysis–catalysis of variant plastic samples are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the distribution of products varied with the type of plastic. The yield of gas products obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of PP, HDPE, LDPE, HIPS, and GPPS wastes was 41.7, 43.4, 41.5, 18.5, and 17.2 wt%, respectively. Compared with PS, more gaseous products were obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of PP and PE wastes. This could be ascribed to the presence of a long chain structure, which promotes decomposition to form lower molecular weight hydrocarbons such as ethylene and propylene [39]. In contrast, substantial carbon deposition was produced by the pyrolysis–catalysis of HIPS and GPPS waste. To be exact, for HIPS and GPPS, the yield of gathered carbon deposition was 49.4 and 48.7 wt%, respectively, which was over 10 wt% more than that obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of polyolefin waste in this work as well as other reports [39]. This might be related to the many small molecular fragments produced during pyrolysis, especially styrene, which has a benzene ring, and is the basic unit structure of the deposited carbon [11]. Components such as styrene with one benzene ring favoured CNT growth, while other hydrocarbons composed of several aromatic rings hindered CNT growth and converted to amorphous graphite through an oligomerisation reaction in the presence of a catalyst [40]. Compared with PP, PE-structured plastics resulted in higher carbon deposits, reaching 36.9 wt% and 35.9 wt% for HDPE and LDPE, respectively. This should be related to the cracked components. To be exact, more C2H4 and C3H6 were obtained from PE and PP, respectively [48]. The difference and PE and PP might be due to the quadrupolar moment property of products; it is easier for ethylene to absorb to the surface of the catalyst, which is favourable for the subsequent bond breaking and carbon deposition process [49,50]. In addition, approximately 20 wt% of liquid product was obtained from different types of plastic, and the largest one was observed from GPPS (~26.1 wt%). The liquid oil yield in this work was much lower than that obtained from direct pyrolysis [42], further confirming the vital importance of the catalyst during the reforming process. The possible transformation process will be discussed according to the product composition and the corresponding physicochemical properties. 3.2.2 Releasing property of gaseous products Fig. 4 . shows the volume fractions of the gaseous components for pyrolysis–catalysis of different types of waste plastics. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the gaseous products from the pyrolysis–catalysis of plastic waste were mainly H2 and CH4. Simultaneously, some C2 + hydrocarbons were also detected. PP mainly contained H2 (58.7 vol%), CH4 (32.4 vol%) with limited CO (4.2 vol%), C2H4 (3.7 vol%), trace C2H6, and other gases (e.g. C3H6). HDPE and LDPE produced slightly lower hydrogen but more hydrocarbons (around 5 vol%) than that from PP. However, compared to the other plastic samples, a much higher hydrogen content in the gaseous products was observed for HIPS and GPPS, reaching 74.1 vol% for HIPS. This was much higher than that obtained from the pyrolysis of plastics directly [48], approximately 15 vol% higher than that gathered from the catalytic pyrolysis of PS [23] or waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) [51] with the presence of nickel-based catalysts. The LHV of the gases produced from PP and PE was approximately 20 MJ m−3, which is slightly higher than that from HIPS and GPPS (~15 MJ m−3), indicating that the gaseous products could be directly used as industrial fuel gas [52]. In addition, the high abundance of hydrogen in gaseous products makes it suitable for further high-value applications after purification or refinement, such as multi-bed pressure swing adsorption [53]. 3.2.3 Composition of liquid products The relative percentages of peak areas for the different components in the liquid products are presented in Fig. 5 . The liquid product components are grouped according to their carbon number, and the concentrations are expressed based on the percentage areas of the corresponding compounds. The carbon number distribution of the liquid products varied from 6 to 22. As can be seen, the carbon numbers of the main components for PP and PE oil are all over 9. To be exact, PP produced a significantly higher proportion of naphthalene (C10) at 27.2%, followed by pyrene (C16) at 15.7%, anthracene (C14) at 15.3%, and biphenyl (C12) at 12.7%. When it came to PE, a higher yield of naphthalene (~30%) and pyrene (~18%) were obtained. HDPE and LDPE showed similar compositions and contents in liquid oil, which could be related to their similar molecular structures. Random scission of the polymer chains dominated the thermal degradation of PP and PE, leading to the formation of several micromolecule hydrocarbon species, such as alkenes or alkanes [54]. In the presence of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, catalytic reforming reactions of the micro-molecule hydrocarbons occurred, leading to the widespread formation of larger molecules. When it came to PS, it appeared that the liquid product contained more types of compounds in the range of C6–C8 compared with liquid products derived from PP or PE, which could be related to the large quantity of decomposed benzene and the corresponding derivatives stemming from the intrinsic structure. Compared with the direct pyrolysis of PS, the styrene content was remarkably low after the catalytic process, which might be related to the high catalytic temperature and reforming reaction [28,55]. Notably, the yield of naphthalene from PS was hardly half of that from PP or PE, which also reflected the difference in the formation process. Specifically, for PS-type plastics (HIPS and GPPS), due to the high stability of benzene and its derivatives produced from the thermal degradation of PS, which limited further cracking, further catalytic deposition process might be restrained [28]. Only the branches in the aromatic hydrocarbons were removed, which could be further degraded into C and H atoms in the presence of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. The remaining aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, might be oligomerised to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, the widespread formation of aromatic hydrocarbons is also an important source of carbon deposition, especially amorphous carbon [56]. The constituents in the product liquid oil in the C8–C16 range were grouped together, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The components with carbon number range from 8 to 16 was classified as they were in the range of jet fuel. The constituents in the C8–C16 range accounted for over 80% of the total composition in the liquid products obtained from PP and PE, which was about 20% higher than that of HIPS and GPPS. Obviously, there were plenty of PAHs in the liquid oil so that it is difficult for the direct utilization. However, it is possible for the liquid products working as additives to jet fuel after further chemical refinement [17]. Moreover, further research will be done on accurate quantification of different components to better evaluate and utilize the liquid products in the future. In addition, there was an interesting phenomenon where the proportion of compositions with an even number of carbon atoms was more than that of neighbouring ones with an odd number of carbon atoms. This might be explained as follows: the compositions with an even number of carbon atoms are mainly composed of benzene rings without branch chains, which are more stable than those with branch chains (mainly these with odd numbered carbon). In the presence of the Fe-based catalyst, more branch chains were removed, leading to a relatively high content of compositions with an even number of carbon atoms. 3.2.4 Characterisation of carbon deposition Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the reacted catalysts from the pyrolysis–catalysis of the different types of waste plastics. The images confirmed that the solid carbon deposition on the surface of the used catalyst contained CNTs. The outer diameter of the produced CNTs ranged from a few nanometres to tens of nanometres, and at lower magnifications, the length of CNTs could be up to even several micrometres. The black nanoparticles encapsulated within the CNTs were related to the reduced iron (Fig. 6(a) inset), and the nanoparticles were mainly concentrated in the middle of the CNTs. The lamellar material associated with the particles corresponded to graphite carbon layers (Fig. 6(b) and (c) inset). Furthermore, for the carbon deposition on the catalysts produced from PP shown in Fig. 6(a), there were more intertwined CNTs. This might be attributed to the higher ash content (Table 1), which might partly poison the metal catalyst particles, and it is unfavourable for normal CNT growth; hence, the CNTs were more closely entangled with each other [57]. The carbon deposits obtained from HDPE and LDPE, which are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c), had better dispersion and cleaner CNTs could be observed, compared with those obtained from PP. This might be related to the smaller molecules of pyrolysis products from PE, especially ethylene [58]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6(d) and (e), together with the CNTs, amorphous carbon was observed from the reacted catalysts of HIPS and GPPS. This might be related to the intrinsic structure of the PS. When HIPS and GPPS are heated to the decomposition temperature, the large polymer molecules break up into small aromatic molecules such as styrene and styrene oligomers [59]. With the influence of the catalyst, the ethenyl branch in styrene is removed, leaving the benzene rings, which are more stable and sterically hindered [11]. The left benzene rings could be the basis for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and even amorphous carbon. Simultaneously, the C–C and C–H bonds in the ethenyl molecule were further broken. The carbon atoms were dissolved and recombined with the melting iron, releasing CNTs once the concentration of carbon atoms inside was saturated [38]. The remaining hydrogen atoms were mainly released in the H2 form. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6, there are many metal particles in the middle or top of the CNTs, which means that the tip growth mode dominates the formation of CNTs for plastic waste [60]. However, this is quite different from the carbon deposition process of methane on similar Fe-based catalysts, where the bottom growth mode occurred more frequently [61]. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), when the temperature was lower than 450 °C, no obvious weight loss was observed. With an increasing temperature (450–650 °C), there was a decrease in the mass, especially for the deposited carbons from HIPS and GPPS related to the oxidisation of the more unstable carbon amorphous carbon [62]. However, the mass reduction in the carbon deposits obtained from the polyolefin plastics (PP and PE) lagged slightly, which could be attributed to the large number of stable graphite carbon materials (mainly CNTs) formed during pyrolysis–catalysis. With further increases in temperature (>650 °C), the weight loss corresponded to graphite oxidisation [62]. The maximum weight loss of the different samples was consistent with the solid yield in the product distribution (shown in Fig. 3). The remaining red solid powder was a mixture of iron oxide and alumina support. As shown in Fig. 7(b), PP, LDPE, and HDPE produced a higher proportion of graphite (over 75%). Simultaneously, approximately 20% of amorphous carbon was also detected. Graphitic carbon is mainly related to CNTs, and the amorphous carbon might originate from the oligomerisation reaction of lower molecular weight polycyclic aromatic compounds [63]. For HIPS and GPPS, almost half of the deposited carbon was amorphous carbon, with 48.0% and 47.4% for HIPS and GPPS, respectively. The existence of a large amount of amorphous carbon further confirmed the TEM results, as shown in Fig. 7. The widespread amorphous carbon might be ascribed to the aromatic hydrocarbons produced during PS pyrolysis, which participated in the formation of CNTs with difficulty because of the more stable structure compared with lower molecular weight hydrocarbons (eg. C2H4 and C3H6). The results also showed that PE or PP might be more appropriate raw materials for CNT production, compared with HIPS and GPPS. XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the reacted catalysts obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of the different types of waste plastics are presented in Fig. 8 . All the peaks could be divided into three groups, corresponding to C, Fe, and Al2O3 (Fig. 8(a)). The peaks at 2θ = 26° and 43° are associated with the (002) lattice plane of graphite and the (100) lattice plane of Fe reduced from Fe2O3 in a reductive pyrolysis atmosphere. The related physical and chemical parameters were calculated from Scherrer–Formula and Bragg’s law (shown in Table 2 ). The DFe of iron in the catalysts changed from 10.978 to 11.492 nm while the size of the iron particles remained constant, which might suggest that changes in the reducing gases have little effect on iron oxide reduction and the corresponding particle size of iron. For the graphite peak, shown in Table 2, d002 changed from 0.340 to 0.344 nm, which revealed a certain deviation from the theoretical value of 0.335 nm [64]. This might be attributed to the structural defects present in the CNTs. In addition, the degree of graphitisation (gd) and the carbon layer number (N) of the carbon deposits were also calculated. The results showed that carbon deposits produced from the pyrolysis–catalysis of polyolefin plastics presented a higher degree of graphitisation, especially for carbon deposition from PP pyrolysis, showing the highest value of gd, that is, 0.364. The relative lower degree of graphitisation was obtained from PS-deposited carbon. Similar results were also obtained by Li et al. [65] and Brenner et al. [66]. This might be related to aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly unbranched aromatic hydrocarbons, which have a negative effect on CNT growth due to their high chemical and thermal stability [40]. In addition, the lower degree of graphitisation might also be attributed to the formation of more amorphous carbon from the oligomerisation of benzene and its derivatives [63,67]. Nevertheless, the graphitisation degree of carbon obtained from waste plastics is still much higher than that of biocarbon [68,69], which might be suitable for a variety of fields, especially in electrochemistry [70,71]. Furthermore, Raman spectrometry characterisation was also performed to further measure the properties of the carbon deposits. Notably, the ID/IG (the intensity ratio of D and G bands) was used to estimate the number of disordered and defective sites in the carbon structure, and IG’/IG (the intensity ratio of G’ and G bands) was used to describe the purity of the produced CNTs [71]. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the carbon deposits produced with PP exhibited a lower ratio of ID/IG (0.52) and a higher ratio of IG’/IG (0.64), indicating a higher degree of graphitisation of the carbon deposits produced from the pyrolysis–catalysis of PP. This was consistent with the results of the XRD analysis of the employed catalysts (Table2). The deposited carbon produced from HIPS and GPPS exhibited a relatively higher ratio of ID/IG and a lower ratio of IG’/IG, which indicates the presence of amorphous carbon and the lower purity of CNTs produced."
8,Possible reaction mechanisms for the catalytic conversion process,"3.3 Possible reaction mechanisms for the catalytic conversion process As discussed above, gaseous, liquid, and solid products were obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of waste plastics in the presence of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. Based on the yield distribution and chemical compositions of the products, possible reaction pathways for the thermal conversion process of different types of plastics are proposed in Fig. 9 . For polyolefin, PP and PE are mainly cracked into the corresponding oligomers through random scission at C–C bonds at 500 °C, further cracking into micromolecules like methane, ethylene, and propylene through beta scission [72]. Then, the volatile was transferred into the catalytic stage (800 °C). On the one hand, more light components were generated from the enhanced thermal cracking by high temperature [35,48]. On the other, much more macromolecules were degraded to lighter ones with the presence of catalyst. C–C and C–H bonds in these lighter volatile components were cleaved by Fe nanoparticles, and the isolated carbon atoms were dissolved into Fe nanoparticles [73]. The diffusion of carbon atoms inside the metal particles makes the particle melting point significantly lower than the actual metal property, leading to a liquid-like state with changing shapes, and simultaneously, forming some Fe3C [74]. Once the concentration of carbon atoms inside was saturated, they dissolved out and formed CNTs. According to Shen et al. [75], the balance between the carbon dissolution rate and education rate needs to be achieved to maintain continuous CNT growth. It can therefore be concluded, here in this work, that the Fe-based catalyst successfully balanced these two rates for the activation of decomposing carbon precursors and the continuous formation of CNTs according to the observation of tubular carbon materials. Compared with propylene, smaller molecules, such as ethylene, cracked from HDPE or LDPE, might be more actively involved in the catalytic deposition process, leading to a higher yield of solid carbon deposition and the eventual formation of carbon deposits or CNTs [58]. The remaining H atoms are mainly released in the form of H2 [76]. Simultaneously, some light olefins are converted to monocyclic aromatic compounds by cyclisation or the Diels–Alder reaction and dehydrogenation [28]. Monocyclic aromatic compounds could be further transformed into polycyclic aromatic compounds through the oligomerisation reaction, and the produced aromatic hydrocarbons dominate the liquid product. When dealing with PS, aromatic hydrocarbons (mainly styrene) are the main products of polymer degradation by random scission and chain-end scission [28]. A small fraction of aromatics might go through the cracking of the branched chains, and the branched molecules could react in the previously proposed pathway. However, more aromatic hydrocarbons might transform into polycyclic aromatics through oligomerisation reactions, which are important components of the liquid products and even the precursors of coke [56], ultimately leading to the formation of amorphous carbon. Notably, the different results obtained from HIPS and GPPS might be attributed to the existence of polybutadiene in HIPS, which leads to closer carbon deposit properties with polyolefin."
9,Conclusions,"The production of high-value hydrogen, liquid fuels, and CNTs via pyrolysis–catalysis of various types of waste plastics (PP, HDPE, LDPE, HIPS, and GPPS) was investigated in the presence of an Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. A high yield of gaseous products was obtained from the pyrolysis–catalysis of PP and PE waste; however, a much higher H2 content (over 70 vol%) was obtained for PS. Simultaneously, compared with PP or PE, aromatic hydrocarbons derived from PS contained a wide distribution of carbon numbers. With respect to carbon deposition, higher carbon deposition with more amorphous carbon was gathered from GPPS and HIPS, which was 10 wt% higher than from polyolefin waste. In contrast, graphite carbon accounted for over 75% of the carbon deposition from PP and PE. This indicates that PE or PP might be more appropriate for the production of CNTs compared with HIPS and GPPS. Overall, many small-molecule alkenes were released from random scission and beta scission of polyolefins, which participated in the subsequent catalytic deposition process. In contrast, polystyrene was degraded to more aromatic compounds from the chain-end scission. Except for some of the branched chains that went through the transformation path like polyolefins, the aromatic hydrocarbon was mainly detected in the form of liquid products or transformed into amorphous carbon. In fact, the detailed catalytic deposit reaction of plastic is still not very clear. In order to further explore the mechanism, more experimental and testing methods like atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (APPI-MS) will be introduced in future investigation."
