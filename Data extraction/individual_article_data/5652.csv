0,Introduction,"Since Honda and Fujishima discovered photoelectrochemical splitting of H2O on titanium dioxide electrodes for H2 production in 1972 [1], research interest in semiconductor-based photocatalyst has grown significantly owing to its potential applications in environmental purification and solar energy. To attain high photon to H2 molecule conversion efficiency in the photocatalytic reaction, highly active and stable photocatalysts are of paramount importance [2,3]. The H2 molecule conversion efficiency is strongly dependent on the solar light harvesting properties of the photocatalyst including (i) charge separation, (ii) migration, and (iii) reduction ability of the photoinduced electrons. However, numerous active photocatalyst materials, such as TiO2 and ZnO, have a large band gap energy (3.20 eV) which only allows the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [4,5]. The fractions of visible and near-infrared light in the entire solar spectrum is about ∼43 % and ∼46 %, respectively, whereas UV light only amounts to ∼5 % [6]. For better use of solar energy, much effort has been devoted to extending the absorption of UV-active catalyst to the visible or near-infrared regions by adjusting the band gap via metal/nonmetal doping, noble metal deposition, combining with upconversion material, and so on [7,8]. Some other hybrid component of semiconductor heterojunctions are active under visible light irradiation but exhibit poor chemical stability in presence of gaseous medium and low photocatalytic activities. Examples of such bi-component materials are BiOI microplates with CdS QDs [9], CdS-FeSe nanorods [10], CdS-Cu9S5 [11], CdS@MoS2 [12], CdS/TiO2 [13], and CuS Nanosheets Decorated with CoS2 [14]. Among the reported novel photocatalysts, various metal oxide and sulfide semiconductors, such as AgVO3, BiVO3, and CdS, have been studied for water splitting applications, because oxide and sulfide catalysts have shown excellent stability compared to that of nitrides [15,16] and phosphides [17,18]. CdS is one of the well-studied and also a good alternative for visible active catalysts owing to its appropriate band gap and conduction band edge [19]. Furthermore, the conduction band (CB) edge potential of CdS is more negative than the reduction potential of the H+/H2 redox couple and the valence band (VB) edge potential is more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O; consequently, CdS favorably reduces protons (H+) to H2 gas. Nevertheless, CdS is unstable and exhibits low H2 production performance under irradiation because sulfides seriously suffer from photocorrosion and easy recombination of excited electrons and holes [20]. To overcome these problems, a variety of strategies have been employed to enhance the visible light photocatalytic reaction via either doping [21] or semiconductor coupling [22]. However, these modifications also have the catalysts to become unstable during photocatalytic reactions. Thus, coupling CdS with Ag/AgVO3 and BiVO4 to produce new heterostructure is an effective way to separate photogenerated charges [23]. In nations where sufficient amount of solar light is available, photocatalysis involving sunlight will be preferable and economical. Consequently, there is an essential for effective catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production under sunlight or visible light irradiation. In this regard, the photocatalytic properties of quite a few metal oxides other than TiO2, WO3, and ZnO have been explored, and vanadates have been shown to exhibit good photo activity in the visible range [24–26]. Todate, vanadium oxides and their combinations have been widely investigated because of their broad applications in catalysis and materials science [27,28]. The band gap energies of vanadates are lower than that of other photocatalysts such as TiO2 or WO3. Introducing of noble metals including Ag, Au, Pd and Pt on metal oxide or semiconductor composite were favorable to hydrogen production by reason of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect [29–31]. When noble metallic nanoparticle exposed by light, a strong oscillation of the conduction electrons excited and created localized SPR effect [32]. Among these, Ag is most promising candidate for coupling with other materials [33,34]. AgVO3 as a new capable material for photocatalytic applications, have attracted considerable scientific attention for H2 evolution from photocatalytic water splitting [35]. The diffuse reflectance spectral analysis of silver vanadate shows a low band gap of about 2.4 eV, indicating that silver vanadate is a suitable candidate for visible light-driven photocatalysts [36]. However the conduction band position of AgVO3 is positive than the redox H2 potential and it can absorb a photon to generate an electron and a hole. Monoclinic bismuth vanadate, with a band gap of 2.3 eV, is an effective catalyst for photodegradation and water splitting under visible light irradiation that has recently attracted increasing attention [37–39]. Unlike other metal oxides, the valence band (VB) edge of monoclinic BiVO4 possesses both O 2p and Bi 6 s orbitals that can increase the VB edge up to ∼2.4 eV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode while maintaining the conduction band (CB) edge near the H2 reduction potential [40]. The present study investigates the photocatalytic efficiency of the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure in which different percentages of Ag/AgVO3 were coupled with CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure. To the best of our knowledge, the photocatalytic performance of Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures have not been reported. Hence, the object of this investigation is to elucidate the photocatalytic efficiency of new Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure catalyst with an expectation to obtain a favorable visible-light responded material. The semiconductor heterostructure was successfully prepared by a combination of homogeneous precipitation, solvothermal, ultra-sonication and photo-deposition methods. The synthesized photocatalysts were investigated by series of characterization techniques. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated via photocatalytic H2 production under artificial solar light illumination in the presence of lactic acid as a hole-scavenger agent under optimized conditions. The 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure catalyzes a high rate of H2 evolution (105,541 μmol/g); this is achieved by the Ag/AgVO3 and CdS nanorods were presented on the surface of BiVO4 and the enhanced surface shuttling properties owing to the enlarged number of active sites. Indeed, heterostructures of Ag/AgVO3 on CdS/BiVO4 semiconductors with suitable oxidation - reduction energy levels could improve charge separation by forming a heterojunction and engineering a broad spectral response by extending light absorption to the visible range."

2,Results & discussion,
3,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The X-ray diffractograms of the prepared CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The main 2θ values of BiVO4 at 18.3˚, 18.9˚, 24.3˚, 28.9˚, 30.6˚, 32.7˚, 34.6˚, 35.3˚, 39.6˚, 44 0.0˚, 46.8˚, 48.4˚, 50.1˚, and 53.4˚ correspond to the (110), (011), (021), (130), (121), (040), (200), (002), (211), (051), (231), (240), (202), and (161) diffraction planes of the monoclinic phase of BiVO4, respectively [41]. CdS, CdS/BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 peaks were detected at 2θ values of 24.9˚, 26.7˚, 28.4˚, 43.8˚, 47.9˚, and 52.0˚, which are ascribed to the (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), and (112) diffraction planes of hexagonal CdS [42,43]. When the BiVO4 content was added to CdS, no diffraction peaks could be assigned to BiVO4 because of its small amount, high dispersity, and low crystallinity. Lower amounts of Ag/AgVO3 (up to 2 wt%), have not observed the Ag/AgVO3 peak positions in the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 material. However, the XRD pattern of 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4, the diffraction peaks of metallic silver, AgVO3, and CdS are detected, and the position of the CdS peaks are unaffected. The XRD peak at 2θ = 38.11˚ observed for the 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 catalysts were attributed to metallic silver (Ag0) (JCPDS 87-0597) [44]. Then 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 shows a small XRD peaks located at 2θ = 29.8˚ and 32.1˚, corresponding to AgVO3 (JCPDS 29–1154) [45]. These results confirm that the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure was successfully synthesized. In the XRD spectra, the peaks of Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 are sharper than that of CdS, CdS/BiVO4 and BiVO4; therefore, Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 is more crystalline than CdS, BiVO4 and CdS@BiVO4. The higher degree of crystallization of the catalyst reduced the number of grain boundaries, which act as recombination centers for the photoinduced electrons and holes [46]. Therefore, a decrement in the number of grain boundaries results an enhance in the photocatalytic activity. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectra and mapping results indicate the presence of O, S, V, Ag, Cd, and Bi in the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure with distribution and atomic percentages 24.57 %, 35.07 %, 1.12 %, 4.49 %, 33.98 %, and 0.77 %, respectively (Fig. S1). The obtained results confirm the successful formation of Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures."
4,Structural analysis by SEM and HRTEM,"3.2 Structural analysis by SEM and HRTEM Fig. S1 shows the typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of monoclinic BiVO4, CdS nanorods, 0.5Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4, 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4, 2Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 and 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4. BiVO4 possesses a well-developed, square, sheet-like morphology with a length of 3−4 mm and thickness 2−3 mm, which is associated with the monoclinic phase (Fig. S1(A)). The grain distribution is uniform, and the surface is smooth. The two facets (040) and (110) play a significant role in determining the mobility of the charge carriers. In Fig. S1(B), a well-defined nanorods structure can be clearly perceived, and the diameter of these CdS nanorods are 5 nm with an average length of 50 nm. In the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures (Fig. S1(C)), the CdS nanorods and Ag/AgVO3 clusters were originated to be well dispersed on the surface of the monoclinic BiVO4 crystal facets. Prior to photo deposition, the top, bottom, and side surfaces of the (040) and (110) facets of BiVO4 were covered with CdS nanorods. Many small particles (∼1 nm) and few relatively large particles (3−8 nm) with diameter of 6 nm of Ag/AgVO3 nanoparticles (Fig. S1) are present on the surface of both CdS and BiVO4. Moreover, compared to the BiVO4 crystals and CdS nanorods, the surface of the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures were rough, which increased the surface area (Table 1 ) and resulted in the superior photocatalytic activity. For a detailed characterization of the morphology of monoclinic BiVO4 crystals, CdS nanorods and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure, TEM images are provided in Fig. 2 . As in the SEM results, the surface of the CdS nanorods and monoclinic BiVO4 were smooth, but in the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures, CdS nanorods and Ag/AgVO3 were present on the BiVO4 surface. The TEM image of the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure confirms that the Ag and AgVO3 clusters are decorated with silver nitrate (Fig. 2). Such compact silver metal particles anchored on silver vanadate nanoclusters via ion exchange synthesis [47,48]. During the photoreduction process, silver nitrate plays dual roles in the formation of Ag/AgVO3 nanoclusters in the reaction. In addition, metallic Ag nanoparticles are formed by the photoreduction of AgNO3 in the solution, resulting in the formation of Ag/AgVO3 nanocomposites. The molar concentration of AgNO3 act as key role in the self-reduction reaction of AgNO3 to form Ag/AgVO3 nanoparticles supported on the surface of CdS/BiVO4. It is supposed that the formation of Ag/AgVO3 nanocomposites are due to the mutual affinity of Ag and AgVO3. Literature reports reveal that Ag+ ions in the AgVO3 lattice serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of AgVO3 clusters [49]. The HRTEM images of monoclinic BiVO4, CdS nanorods, and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 2. The lattice fringes with spacings of 0.26 nm and 0.33 nm can be ascribed to the (121) and (002) planes of monoclinic BiVO4 and hexagonal CdS, respectively [50,51]. The interface between CdS nanorods and BiVO4 could be observed through the HRTEM image in the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterojunction, the lattice spacing of 0.33 nm can be detected, which is confirmed with the d spacing of the (002) plane of hexagonal CdS. While BiVO4 has an interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (121) plane of monoclinic BiVO4. In the AgVO3 crystals, the 0.268 nm lattice fringe spacing attributed to the (501) plane. The determined interplanar distance of 0.20 nm confirmed well with the lattice spacing of the (200) plane of metallic silver clusters. Fig. 2 shows the elemental analysis results for the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure material, which designates the existence of elements, i.e., Cd, S, Bi, V, Ag, and O. The above results further indicate that the close lattice contact between these three semiconductors are conductive to the efficient transfer of photo-induced charge carriers across the interface between the three semiconductors and the subsequent decrease in recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers."
5,UV-DRS absorption spectroscopy,"3.3 UV-DRS absorption spectroscopy To explore the absorption properties of the as-prepared CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 photocatalysts, UV-DRS was conducted, and the spectra as shown in Fig. 3 . All the catalysts show robust absorption within the visible region, and the steep peaks suggest that the UV or visible light absorption can be ascribed to the intrinsic transition between the valence (VB) and conduction bands (CB) rather than to the transition from the impurity to the conduction band [52]. The construction of heterojunction composites with aligned energy band structures are one of the most effective approaches [53]. The monoclinic phase of BiVO4 has an absorption edge at 506 nm, while the absorption edges of bare CdS nanorods and CdS/BiVO4 are located at 512 and 519 nm. The absorption band of BiVO4 is attributed to the shift of electrons from the 6 s valence band of Bi3+ to the empty 3d conduction band of V5+ [54]. Compared to CdS and CdS/BiVO4 absorption bands, the visible absorption threshold of the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures are increased due to the surface plasmon behavior and an effective interactions of Ag/AgVO3 and CdS with BiVO4. The Ag 4d and O 2p orbitals are included in the formation of the VB, ensuing in the reduction of the band gap because of a metal-to-metal charger transfer (MMCT) between the d10 electronic configuration of Ag+ and the d0 electronic configuration of V5+ [55]. In contrast, Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 exhibits an absorption band around 683 nm, ascribed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Ag particles (Fig. 3A). Compared to 0.5Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4, the SPR absorption band of 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 exhibits a slightly higher wavelength shift, which is ascribed to the higher amount of in-situ photo reduced metallic silver particles (inset of Fig. 3A). The SPR effect of metallic Ag causes electron transfer in the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures by (i) red shifting the absorption wavelength region; (ii) increasing the roughness of the CdS nanorods and BiVO4 surfaces with Ag0 and/or AgVO3, which in turn increases the light scattering effect; and (iii) transferring the plasmon energy from the metal to the semiconductor, which can help induce the photogeneration of electrons and holes. Plasmonic sensitization considerably enhances the photocatalytic efficiency owing to the separation of the photo-excited electrons and holes and the suppression of recombination [56]. The band gaps of the BiVO4 crystals, CdS nanorods, CdS/BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures calculated with the Kubelka-Munk equation are in the 2.45-2.22 eV range (inset of Fig. 3B) [57]. A significant reduction of the band energies from 2.28 to 2.22 eV occurs with increasing Ag/AgVO3 content up to 3 % (Table 1). The noticeable Bandgap narrowing not only proposes a promising structural morphology effect of the heterostructures but also indicates the electronic interactions between the individual components of BiVO4 and CdS nanorods after decoration with Ag/AgVO3. These results confirm that the heterostructures have an advanced capacity to utilize solar radiation, resulting a better photocatalytic activity than that of monoclinic BiVO4 and CdS nanorods."
6,Raman & Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"3.4 Raman & Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Raman spectroscopy is a suitable approach to investigating the local structure because the bonding states in the co-ordination polyhedra of a catalyst can be directly deduced from the vibrational Raman spectrum [58]. The Raman spectra of the CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures were recorded in the range of 100−1000 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 4 . The bare BiVO4 exhibits Raman shifts at 126.8, 214.3, 336, 364, 710, and 824.7 cm−1, corresponding to the external modes (translation/rotation), asymmetric (Bg) bending mode of the vanadate anion (VO4 3-), and the symmetric (Ag) bending mode of the vanadate anion (VO4 3-). The two stretching modes of the VO bonds correspond to the bands centered at 710 and 824.7 cm−1 [59,60]. The characteristic peaks at 303.4 and 597.7 cm−1 correspond to the vibrational modes of hexagonal CdS [61]. The CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 materials show main Raman bands at 303.0 and 597.3 cm-1 ascribed to the vibrational modes of hexagonal CdS. No BiVO4 bands were observed due to its low content in the CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures. As for 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 sample, the small peaks at 886.1 cm−1 is ascribed to either bridging OVO or VOA g vibrations. The Raman peak at 808 cm−1 is attributed to the AgOAg bridges stretching vibrations. The bridging VOV asymmetric stretching bonds in the polymeric metavanadate chains are imitated at 731 cm−1 band. Furthermore, compared to CdS Raman bands, the main band intensities of CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 materials decreased and the peaks are broadened and slightly shifted toward lower wave numbers, which is attributed to the loading of Ag/AgVO3 and also interaction between the CdS nanorods, BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3. The heterostructure of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 increases the effective area of interaction, leading to the transfer of photoinduced electrons from CB of BiVO4 to VB of CdS via electron mediator and plasmonic silver to the CdS nanorods. Thus, the Raman study suggests that the strong interaction of Ag/AgVO3 and CdS nanorods with BiVO4 enhance the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 catalyst photocatalytic activity. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectra of the CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 samples. The major bands at 660 cm−1 and 801 cm−1 are linked with the anti to symmetric stretching of (VO4)3-. The peak located at 650 cm−1 was attributed to the Bi-O group bending vibration [62]. An extra band at 1600 cm−1 is attributed to the OH vibration of water. The FTIR spectra of the CdS nanorods, CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures as shown and the band at 3365.4 cm−1 is ascribed to the OH vibration of water adsorbed on the CdS surface [63], and the bands at 631.3, 883.8, and 1113.4 cm−1 are due to the stretching of the Cd-S bond [64]. Compared with the vibrational bands of CdS and CdS/BiVO4, the characteristic peaks of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 are slightly shifted to 3366, 632.1, 884, and 1113.9 cm−1, representing the chemical bands between BiVO4, Ag/AgVO3, and CdS. The main peaks in the FTIR spectrum of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 are similar to those of the CdS nanorods and CdS/BiVO4, indicating that the addition of Ag/AgVO3 did not alteration the structure of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4. However, no obvious FTIR peaks of Ag/AgVO3 and BiVO4 are observed owing to the low percentage of Ag/AgVO3 and BiVO4 in the heterostructure."
7,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),"3.5 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS survey spectrum of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 shows the presence of O, S, V, Ag, Cd, and Bi in the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 material (Fig. 6 a). Fig. 6 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s, S 2p, V 2p, Ag 3d, Cd 3d, and Bi 4f, respectively. The XPS signals of O 1s at 529.7 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen, while the signal at 532.4 eV can be ascribed to adsorbed H2O and OH on the surface of the heterostructure (Fig. 6b) [65]. The peaks around 162.5 eV and 163.9 eV were ascribed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 6c) [66]. The V 2p spectrum shows the peaks at 517.3 eV for V 2p3/2 and 532.4 eV for V 2p1/2 (Fig. 6d) [67]. The Ag 3d spectrum exhibits two bands at 368.6 eV and 374.7 eV, which are attributed to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 orbitals of Ag+ in the AgVO3, respectively, while those at 367.4 eV and 373.7 eV could be ascribed to Ag0 (Fig. 6e) [68–70]. The presence and formation of metallic silver is also confirmed by XRD, HRTEM, and UV-DRS analysis. The two well-resolved binding energies at 406.1 eV and 412.8 eV were attributed to Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, confirming that the Cd species exist in the +2 oxidation state (Fig. 6f) [71]. The binding energies at 159.7 eV and 164.5 eV are ascribed to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 orbitals, respectively (Fig. 6g) [72]. These results further demonstrate that the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure was successfully synthesized, which is consistent with the XRD, UVDRS, and HRTEM analysis."
8,PL & photocurrent spectroscopy,"3.6 PL & photocurrent spectroscopy To understand the transfer, migration, and recombination process of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs in the CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 semiconductor heterostructures, the photoluminescence (PL) emission was analyzed and as shown in Fig. 7 A [73,74]. With an excitation wavelength of 450 nm, the main emission peaks of BiVO4, CdS and CdS/BiVO4 were centered at 519.9, 538.9 and 539 nm, which were attributed to the recombination of the charge carriers. The BiVO4 crystals and CdS nanorods possess a relatively high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers owing to the lower in the presence of Ag/AgVO3 in 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure. After the photodeposition of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4, the PL intensities of the emission bands became weaker, suggesting a fast photogenerated electron transfer process in the heterostructure [75]. Moreover, the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure had a lower PL intensity than BiVO4, CdS and CdS/BiVO4 which is attributed to the more efficient charge separation. This increased efficiency can be caused by the excess of Ag/AgVO3 clusters on the surface of the BiVO4 crystals and CdS nanorods, as shown in the TEM image of used 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 material (Fig. S2). Under solar light irradiation, part of the incident light is absorbed by the excess Ag/AgVO3 clusters instead of the BiVO4 and CdS components of the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure. Hence, the weaker PL emission observed for 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 is attributed to two factors: (i) smaller number of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in bare BiVO4 crystals and CdS nanorods because the Ag/AgVO3 clusters intercept the incident light and (ii) suppressed electron-hole recombination due to electron transfer from BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3 to CdS. Therefore, most surface sites were passivated, and electrons were accessible for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Photocurrent measurements were also performed to estimate the separation capacity of the photoinduced carriers, and the results are presented in Fig. 7B. The transient photocurrent responses of BiVO4, CdS, CdS/BiVO4 and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 with respect to time were measured with 30 s on/off cycles of simulated solar light irradiation. The photocurrent response of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 is higher than that of BiVO4, CdS and CdS/BiVO4 [76,77]. The high 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 photocurrent reveals the significant synergetic interaction of Ag/AgVO3 and CdS with BiVO4 suggests a higher separation efficiency of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs [78]. The photocurrent responses were extremely reproducible and remained stable for several on-off cycles, indicating that the Ag/AgVO3, CdS nanorods and BiVO4 can effectively resist photocorrosion. The results also indicate that Ag/AgVO3 improve the photocatalytic activity of the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures."
9,Photocatalytic activity,"Fig. 8 A displays the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution measured under artificial solar light irradiation for CdS nanorods, BiVO4 crystals, CdS/BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures with lactic acid and water mixtures. The as-synthesized photocatalysts showed different hydrogen yields, with 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 > 2Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 > 0.5Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 > 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 > CdS/BiVO4 < CdS > BiVO4. Owing to the fast recombination of the photogenerated charges and the absence of BiVO4 and Ag/AgVO3, the CdS nanorods show a low hydrogen production yield of 901 μmol/g. Notably, BiVO4 could active to visible light, but the photocatalytic hydrogen production (88 μmol/g) was low, due to the low separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Nevertheless, further addition of BiVO4 led to a reduction in the H2 evolution rate, even though it remained much higher than that of the monoclinic BiVO4 and CdS nanorods. The decrease in the H2 evolution rate was ascribed to the obstruction of the incident light and thus lowered rate of production of electron-hole pairs. Loading of Ag/AgVO3 on CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure caused in a considerable improvement in the hydrogen evolution. After the addition of 1Ag/AgVO3 content, the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure displays the best photocatalytic activity (105,541 μmol/g) (comparative study of different photocatalysts were presented in Table S1) and high quantum yield (Table 1), which is 117 times greater than that of the CdS nanorods, implying an optimum synergistic interaction between the tri-component semiconductors and the surface plasmon resonance of metallic silver [79]. During the reaction, the metallic silver particles play significant role in the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure. As confirmed from the UV-DRS absorption results, the photoreduction of Ag+ particles were increased with increasing the irradiation time. When the Ag/AgVO3 addition improved above 1 wt%, the photocatalytic activity is reduced gradually. At higher Ag/AgVO3 addition more CdS/BiVO4 surface is covered that would hinder the contact between CdS/BiVO4 and scavenger, resulting an increase in diffuse distance there by rate of H2 would be decreased. Therefore 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 showed spectral line in the visible region that is confirmed by UV-DRS wherein a reduction in band gap is observed in Fig. 3B. The 3Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 demonstrated ca. 21,654 μmol/g hydrogen is produced under artificial solar light over catalyst. Photocatalytic reactions were conducted to study the production of hydrogen with different amounts (2.5−20 mg) of catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 8B, when the amount of catalyst increased from 2.5–10 mg, the corresponding hydrogen production yields increased from 26,542 to 105,541 μmol/g. However, when large amounts (10−20 mg) of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 catalyst was added into the reaction mixture, the resulting hydrogen yields were significantly reduced. On the one hand, higher amounts of catalyst could generate more active sites in the photocatalytic procedure; the catalyst could accumulate, increase the turbidity of the solution, and reduce the amount of light penetration through the catalyst solution. In the present study, 10 mg of catalyst produced the best H2 yield under artificial solar light irradiation. Catalyst stability is an important as activity for the practical application of semiconductor-based photocatalytic materials. We then investigated the effects of the concentration of the scavenger (lactic acid) in the reaction solution on the surface properties of the catalysts and the solution. Thus, different concentrations (5−20 vol%) of lactic acid were used, and the results are observed in Fig. 9 A. H2 generation increased with the lactic acid concentration, and the highest H2 generation activity was about 105,541 μmol/g for concentrations of 10 vol%. At higher lactic acid concentrations, H2 production was decreased. However, the maximum activity at the optimal concentration is ascribed to the effective adsorption of lactic acid on the catalyst surface and indicates an effective surface photocatalytic reaction. At low lactic acid concentrations, only some of the active sites adsorbed by lactic acid on the catalyst were utilized for H2 production. Above the optimum level, the reaction medium becomes less polar, and the reactive species are saturated owing to the high adsorption of lactic acid and its intermediates that inhibit the photocatalytic performance. To estimate the photostability of the heterostructures, recycling tests were performed on the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure, and the results are presented in Fig. 9B. After 12 cycles, the H2 evolution activity of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 has decreased (97,323 μmol/g), displaying a significant decrease in photoactivity. In contrast, the H2 evolution remained relatively stable for 12 reaction cycles in the artificial light irradiation. Consequently, the minor photoactivity decrease of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 after 12 cycles might be ascribed to the loss of the photocatalyst during each round of collection and rinsing, which is ascribed to the oxidation of lactic acid in the reaction solution. This led to a decrease in lactic acid concentration and the formation of an oxidation intermediate in the reaction solution, which might be adsorbed on the surface of the 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 photocatalyst. The optical response of CdS, BiVO4, and 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 (fresh and used) are reported in Fig. S2A. The used 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure demonstrated an absorption band at 717 nm which is quite different from fresh sample and is red shifted. The fresh and used 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure displayed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands approximately at 683 and 717 nm, respectively (Fig. S2A). It is observed that the intensity of SPR of used 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure is altered with irradiation time. The intensity and band shift of SPR of the used sample is increased with light irradiated time due to the reduction of metal oxide to metal over a period of illumination. The surface plasmon resonance bands of silver particles are depended by many factors such as particle size, shape, size distribution, surface charge density. Furthermore, the increase in size distribution also led to broadening of the SPR peak. The results confirm that during the photoirradiation process the generation of metallic silver particles increased, which depicts that the Ag0 particles have great influence on the photocatalytic hydrogen production. The composition and microstructure of 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure after the photocatalytic reaction is further explored by EDX and HRTEM. The used 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure HRTEM image displays that the lattice fringe of 0.26 nm is reliable with (121) plane of BiVO4, while the lattice fringe of 0.33 nm is attributed to the (002) plane of CdS, and the lattice fringes of 0.268 and 0.20 nm belong to the (501) and (200) plane of AgVO3 and Ag0 as shown in Fig. S2B. The surface particles are composed of Ag/AgVO3, while the inner catalyst consists of Cd, Bi, S, V, and O, as evidenced by EDX. The estimated amount of metallic Ag in the post-reaction (used) catalyst is about 5.09 %, much greater than that in the fresh catalyst (4.49 %). To study the effect of different sacrificial agents, hydrogen production experiments were conducted under artificial solar light irradiation with 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 material over glycerol, methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and lactic acid water mixtures in Fig. 9C. In the presence of water with ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, and glycerol mixtures, the hydrogen yields were lower, while lactic acid water mixtures were found to have greater hydrogen yields. Generally, the H2 yield depends on the polarity of the substrate; thus, the H2 production amplified with the rise in the polarity of the alcohols. Therefore, the scavengers highly depended the activity in the following order: methanol < ethanol < glycerol < ethylene glycol < lactic acid."
10,Mechanism,"Based on the experimental analysis, we propose a plausible mechanism for photocatalytic hydrogen production with the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure, as shown in Scheme 2 . In this Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure, the photocatalytic process is initiated by the photons absorption with energy equal to or higher than the band gap, which leads to the generation of electron-hole pairs from the photoexcited components of the semiconductor and plasmon-excited metallic Ag nanoparticles. When the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure was irradiated with solar light, plasmon-induced electrons were generated in the Ag nanoparticles under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, photoexcited electron transfer from VB to CB of CdS under visible irradiation. Due to the photoexcited electrons in the CB of Ag can transfer to the CB of CdS and self-excited electrons of CdS material, photoexcited electron clouds are formed at CB of CdS and these excessive electrons are reacted with H+ in water to produce H2 molecules. This phenomena is more obvious due to more positive CB band position of CdS material, which is more consistent with the reported literatures [80]. Besides, the photoinduced holes received from VB of BiVO4 to AgVO3, which can react with the adsorbed water/lactic acid on the surface of the AgVO3 heterostructure catalyst to generate carbon dioxide and pyruvic acid. Under visible light irradiation, both AgVO3 and BiVO4 can be excited and generate electrons and holes in the CB and VB, indicating that BiVO4 has suitable optical absorption in visible light, with an obvious absorption band at around 506 nm [81,82]. Overall, the spectrum of the Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure show a small shift in the absorption band under illuminated conditions; the reduction potential of CdS is increased and the band electrons can transfer from CB of AgVO3 to the CB of BiVO4. As the CB of AgVO3 (0.25 eV) is more negative than that of BiVO4 (0.35 eV) and the VB of BiVO4 (2.80 eV) is more positive than that of AgVO3 (2.50 eV), the photoinduced electrons in the CB of AgVO3 can transfer to the CB of BiVO4, and the holes will transfer from the VB of BiVO4 to the VB of AgVO3 [83,84]. Moreover, the photoinduced electrons in the CB of BiVO4 can recombine with the VB holes of CdS via an electron mediator [40]. Meanwhile a number of Ag+ ions will undergo reduction to plasmonic metallic silver, which is clearly evidenced by the UV–vis DR spectra. The XPS shows peaks of Ag+ at higher binding energy than that of Ag0, which designates that the surface of the Ag metal particles have more electrons during the photoreaction, probably owing to the surface plasmon resonance effect and the stronger interactions between the silver particles and the semiconductor heterojunctions. Furthermore, the simultaneously occurring electron and hole transfer decreases the possibility of charge carrier recombination and increases the H2 production and lifetime of the photocatalyst. In conclusion, the overall high photocatalytic activity of the 1Ag/AgV@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructure in solar H2 production can be attributed to synergistic effects and SPR excitation."
11,Conclusions,"Novel Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures with different Ag/AgVO3 loaded weight percentages have been successfully prepared by the photodeposition method. The physical and chemical properties of the prepared heterostructures were analyzed with several characterization techniques. XRD results revealed the remarkably crystalline nature of CdS and the absence of Ag/AgVO3 and BiVO4 peaks in the optimized 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 photocatalyst. The Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures exhibited photo absorption band at around 683 nm due to SPR of metallic Ag particles. The Ag0 at the surface of the tri-component semiconductors causes increased visible absorption wavelengths, improved morphology, strong interactions, and efficient charge carrier separations, confirmed by UVDRS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman, FTIR, photocurrent and photoluminescence analyses. SEM and TEM confirm that some Ag/AgVO3 nanoparticles are grown and closely attached on the CdS and BiVO4 surfaces. The weight percentages of the interacting Ag/AgVO3 on CdS/BiVO4 in the highly stable Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 heterostructures were found to affect the production of H2 under artificial solar light irradiation. The 1Ag/AgVO3@CdS/BiVO4 sample demonstrated the highest hydrogen production rate, which was 117 times greater than that of pure CdS nanorods. The superior photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the synergistic interaction between the effective the photogenerated electrons and holes separation by the tri-component photocatalyst and the surface plasmon resonance of metallic silver particles. The proposed photocatalytic mechanism highlights that the in-situ formed metallic Ag can serve as charge transmission bridges and electron traps for H2 production. This study provides a facile route using common and inexpensive reagents and equipment for the large-scale synthesis of highly active, visible-light driven photocatalysts."
