0,Introduction,"The ever-increasing energy demands as well as the extensive concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels have attracted considerable research attention to the exploration of renewable energy resources [1–5]. Among various bio-renewable feedstock, microalgae is deemed to be one of the most promising alternative resources which has been used for manufacturing commodity chemicals, such as fatty alcohols, owing to their high lipid content and short planting cycle [6]. Fatty alcohols and their derivatives are important intermediates which are commonly used as detergents, pharmaceuticals and additives [7]. Recent years, the sustained development of fatty alcohol industry has witnessed and the worldwide production of fatty alcohol was about 3.1 million tons in 2015 and steadily grew by 3.2% per year [8,9]. Generally, industrial production of fatty alcohols adopts a two-step technique (Scheme 1 ), that is, methyl esterification of triglycerides or fatty acids, and further hydrogenolysis using CuCr Adkins catalysts under harsh reaction conditions (200–400 °C, 20–40 MPa) [10–14]. However, Cr-containing catalysts are toxic and involve environmental and health hazards. Therefore attempts should be taken to develop highly efficient and environmental-friendly catalysts for fatty alcohol synthesis to meet the idea of green chemistry. Owing to the low electrophilicity of its carbonyl carbon, hydrogenation of carboxylic acid still remains an enormously challenging [15,16]. Recently, Ru, Re or Co-complex homogeneous catalysts have been developed for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids [17–20]. Despite impressive achievements have been realized, homogeneous catalysts are still far from industrial demands, such as products separation and catalysts recycling. From the standpoint of sustainable chemistry and large-scale production, heterogeneous catalysts that could be readily recycled are more promising. In recent decades, researches mainly concentrated on noble metal or their derived bimetallic catalysts [21–28]. For example, Pt/TiO2 [21] was effective for carboxylic acids hydrogenation, and enhanced hydrogenation activity could be achieved after modified catalyst with Re without the alcohol selectivity loss. Although noble metal catalysts showed high performance for carboxylic acids conversion, seeking earth-abundant cheap alternatives to replace the scarce noble metal would be more appropriate when considering the cost and sustainability. Unfortunately, up to now, few transition metals have been successfully employed in the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids owing to the corrosion by carboxylic acids during reaction, not even for the noble gold which has been reported [29,30]. A new route to convert fatty acid into fatty alcohol under hydrothermal conditions with Zn over Ni catalyst was also presented [31]. Despite its superior efficiency, the stoichiometric production of hydrogen by Zn extremely restricted their practical application. Accordingly, developing new route for catalytic hydrogenation of fatty acid into fatty alcohol with stable, low-cost and recyclable catalysts is urgently required. Supported nickel-based catalysts have been extensively employed in many catalytic processes such as fatty acid hydrogenation because of their high activity and low costs [32–35]. However, CC bond cracking and decarboxylation occurred in most cases when monometallic Ni catalysts were used for catalyzing conversion of fatty acids into hydrocarbons. Strategies, such as doping Ni catalysts with other ‘inert’ metals can improve the catalytic performance, and avoid the shortening of the carbon chain to some extent. For example, Ni and Cu doped by In2O3 were reported to significantly suppress side reactions such as decarbonylation and decarboxylation. And the selectivity towards alcohol could reach approximately 80% [36–38]. On the other hand, it was reported that FeOx could catalyze the reduction of acetic acid to acetaldehyde [39]. The strength of the metal-oxygen bond was regarded as a key factor in determining the binding ability of acids on oxides surface. Iron oxide had an optimal metal-oxygen bond strength which was strong enough to bind carboxylates and at the same time, it was weak enough for the bound oxygen to react. Similarly, Yuan et al. revealed that the introduction of Fe to Ru-based catalysts could promote both activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of fatty acid. And it was believed that the Fe species were crucial to stabilize RuFe bimetallic nanoparticles and activate acid molecules [40,41]. Furthermore, supported FeNi bimetallic catalyst has been declared to be highly active in various reforming reactions [42–46], such as the methanation of CO2 [47], selective hydrogenation of 5-HMF [48] and dry reforming of methane [49], owing to the synergetic effect between Ni and Fe. Inspired by the unique chemical properties of metal Fe and Ni, FeNi bimetal may be an ideal hydrogenation catalyst for carboxylic acid. Herein, an in-situ carbonization and reduction strategy was designed to prepare the carbon coating FeNi bimetallic catalysts, which showed high performance and stability in the hydrogenation of carboxylic acid to the corresponding alcohol. Under the optimal conditions, stearic acid could be entirely converted, yielding 98% stearic alcohol. Structural characterization showed that the formation of Ni3Fe intermetallic compound between Fe and Ni was responsible for the excellent performance and the carbon coating layer reduced the leaching of the active component. DFT calculations confirmed that dehydroxylation was the rate-determining step over Ni3Fe (1 1 1). The remarkable catalytic activity, long-term stability and easy separation made this carbon coated NiFe catalyst a promising alternative for the production of fatty alcohols."

All chemicals above were analytical grade and used directly without further purification."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation The preparation for NixFey catalysts with different Fe/Ni mole ratio were basically the same method which was previously reported by our group [50]. Briefly, 2.52 g (0.0200 mol) of C2H2O4·2H2O and 1.26 g (0.0100 mol) melamine were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water. The mixture was refluxed at 70 °C for 6 h under stirring. Then, required amount of NiCl2·6H2O and (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water to form a clear solution which was subsequently added into the melamine-oxalic acid mixture solution, stirring at room temperature for 12 h. After filtration, the insoluble precipitate was washed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C. Subsequently, the precursor was calcined at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in N2 flow. Detailed amounts of Fe and Ni could be seen in Table S1 (Supplementary information). Ni3Fe1/SiO2 was prepared by wet-impregnation method. 1.5 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.8 g NiCl2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water, and then 5.9 g SiO2 powder was added into the mixed solution, followed by stirring at room temperature. Then the mixture was dried under 70 °C, and further dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, catalyst was calcined in air at 650 °C for 2 h (10 °C/min). Prior to use, the calcined catalyst was reduced at 650 °C for 3 h (10 °C/min) in hydrogen (50 mL/min)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi SU-70 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 25.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were presented on a Hitachi HT-7700 microscope at 80.0 kV. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained on an ASAP 2020 V 3.00 H surface area and porosity analyzer. On the basis of the isotherms, specific surface area was calculated via a multipoint method from the adsorption data, and the pore size distribution was analyzed by the DFT method from the desorption data. Element contents were provided on a Vario EI elemental analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was employed to determine the Ni, Fe contents in the catalysts, which were dissolved in 70 wt% nitric acid. The distributions of various elements in the catalysts were exhibited by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCALAB 250Xi spherical analyzer. The XRD data was collected on a D/tex-Ultima TV wide-angle X-ray Diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted in FINESORB-3010 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Before a TPR test, catalysts were pretreated in Ar atmosphere at 423 K for 1 h. TPR was performed in 10% H2/Ar mixture gas (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1."
5,Catalyst activity test,"2.4 Catalyst activity test Typical experiment was carried out in the batch stainless steel autoclave equipped with a glass magnet. Stearic acid (300 mg), 1,4-dioxane (30 mL), and catalyst (25 mg) were loaded into the batch autoclave. Then the autoclave was purged with H2 to the required pressure, and heated to the desired temperature with a stirring speed of 700 rpm for 5 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. The used catalyst was separated by a permanent magnet. The resulting solution was analyzed by GC-FID and the products were identified by GC–MS. Internal standard (i.e., dodecane) was used for quantitative analysis."
6,Recycling procedures,"2.5 Recycling procedures Each time, the used Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst was recycled and separated by a permanent magnet (Fig. S16) and washed several times with 1,4-dioxane. After that, without drying, the wet catalyst was directly used for the next run. The conversion of STA was maintained at around 90% and reaction time was fixed at 2 h."
7,DFT calculations,"2.6 DFT calculations Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [51]. The spin-polarized projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the Revised PBE electron exchange-correlation functional with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were applied in our calculations [52]. The kinetic energy cutoff for the wave function expanded in the plane-wave basis was set as 400 eV. The propionic acid was modeled as a simplified stearic acid. A p (2 × 2) supercell containing a four-layer slab with 64 atoms for Ni3Fe (1 1 1) was modeled. A 4 × 4 supercell was used to construct a four-layer Fe (1 1 0) slab and a 5 × 5 supercell was used to construct a four-layer Ni (1 1 1) slab. The periodic condition was employed along the x and y directions. The vacuum space along the z direction was set to be 15 Å to eliminate the interaction between neighboring slabs. The upper two-layer atoms for all models in the cell were allowed to relax during the structure optimization and the bottom two-layer atoms were fixed. The Brillouin-zone integration was performed along with a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for all the slabs. The relaxation was stopped when the force residue on the atom was smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1. The transition states were calculated by using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [53]. The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated as follows: E ads = E total - E surface - E adsorbate , where Etotal was the calculated total energy of the adsorption system, Esurface was the energy of the clean catalyst and Eadsorbate represented the energy of the gas-phase molecule. The energy barrier was defined as: E a = E TS - E IS , where ETS and EIS were the total energy of the transition state and the initial state, respectively."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Catalysts characterization,"3.1 Catalysts characterization In this study, a series of NixFey hybrid catalysts were synthesized by an one-pot in-situ reduction and carbonization method of the FeNi-melamine-oxalic acid complex compounds [54]. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were firstly carried out to shed light on the morphology of various NixFey samples. As shown in SEM (Fig. S1, Fig. 1 a and b), these samples were composed of aggregated nanorod structure. Meanwhile, the rod-like structure was assembled by nanoparticles around 60 nm in diameter. Besides, TEM images in Fig. 1d show that these nanoparticles were closely interconnected vesicles with size around 20–80 nm in diameter. Specifically, the average particle size from the corresponding TEM images was 38 ± 13.4 nm (Fig. S5). Those piled nanorods and the hollow structure may lead to rich mesoporous channels in these materials. The N2 sorption isotherm of the Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample (Fig. 1c) showed an typical IV curve, which indicated a mesoporous characteristic.[55] And the average pore size was about 12.2 nm (insert curve in Fig. 1c). The calculated total pore volume and the BET surface area of Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst were identified to be 0.24 cm3·g−1 and 67 m2·g−1, respectively. Detailed textual properties were listed in Table S2 and the particle size distributions of the as-prepared NixFey samples were presented in Figs. S2–S6. These results indicated that well-developed mesoporous structures were formed during catalyst preparing procedure, and all samples shared the similar mesoporous structure. Those mesoporous channels made catalyst suitable for mass transfer of large molecules such as stearic acid. XRD patterns of the catalysts with different Ni/Fe ratios were showed in Figs. 2 and S7. The Ni1.8 catalyst showed reflections of the metallic Ni at 2θ of 44.5°, 51.7° and 76.3°, which were attributed to (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes, respectively (PDF# 04-0850). As for monometallic Fe1.5 sample, two diffraction peaks were located at 2θ of 44.7° and 65.0°, corresponding to the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) reflections of metal Fe, respectively (PDF#06-0696). Besides, three isolated diffraction peaks were also observed for the Fe2O3 (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (4 4 1) planes at 2θ of 30.2°, 35.6° and 64.0° (PDF#39-1346). In the XRD patterns of the bimetallic NixFey catalysts, when Fe was introduced into Ni, diffraction peaks of the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes gradually shifted to smaller angles upon increasing the Fe/Ni ratio. Similar phenomenon was also reported in FeNi/Al2O3, FeNi/SiO2 and FeNi/MgAlOx catalysts [44–46,56–58], indicating that after Fe was added into Ni, the lattice parameter of the Ni crystal space was slightly enlarged, thus leading to the formation of nickel-rich NiFe solid solution alloy (Ni1.8Fe1.0 and Ni1.8Fe0.6). When falling into the Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample, three sharp symmetrical peaks appeared at 2θ of 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.8°, which were typically assigned to (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes of the cubic Ni3Fe, respectively (PDF#88-1715) [47]. Since the disordered Ni3Fe solid solution alloy belonging to the Fm-3m space group showed the similar peak positions, XRDstructuralrefinement was further conducted. The lattice parameter of Ni1.8Fe1.5 was calculated to be 3.546 Å, which was in accordance with the Pm-3m space group of the ordered Ni3Fe intermetallic compound (standard lattice parameter: 3.545 Å) [59], rather than the disordered Ni3Fe solid solution alloy with the standard lattice parameter of 3.5556 Å [60]. The refined XRD pattern of Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst was typically in line with that of the pure phase Ni3Fe in the literature (Fig. S8) [61]. Moreover, the lack of FeFe bonds and the existence of Ni3Fe revealed by the Mossbauer spectrum indicated that metallic Fe was uniformly dispersed and no Fe domains existed in Ni3Fe (Table S3 and Fig. S9) [62–70]. More detailed analysis of the Mossbauer spectrum can be seen in the supporting information. According to the EDX analysis of the particles, the Ni/Fe mole ratio in the NixFey was in the range of 2.5 ∼ 10 (Figs. S3–S6). Besides, the compositions of metallic particles could be calculated from the Vegard's rule [44,46]. The Ni/Fe atomic ratio was calculated to be 2.8 in Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample (Table S4), which was pretty close to the Ni3Fe form, thus the Ni3Fe was verified to be an intermetallic form in the Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample. Further increasing the loading of Fe, the iron-rich NiFe alloy was formed in Ni1.8Fe3.0. The Ni3Fe nanoparticles in Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample were analyzed using HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 3 a and b. The orderly lattice fringes were observed in Ni1.8Fe1.5 and the measured lattice distance was 0.204 nm, corresponding to (1 1 1) plane of cubic Ni3Fe intermetallic. It indicated that Ni and Fe were mixed at the atomic level [47]. The yellow parallel lines shown in Fig. 3a demonstrated that the Ni3Fe was partially coated by carbon layers with thickness of 3–5 nm, which helped protect metal from leaching [71–73]. Besides, it clearly displayed that some borderline in the nanoparticle or even some nanoparticles were coated with less than 1 nm thickness of carbon layers, as the red dashed line shown. Hollow carbon sphere was also observed, which was highlighted by dashed blue circular lines and coordinated with the hollow spheres presented in Fig. 3a. These nanoparticles held an average particle size of about 40 nm and were encapsulated in carbon layers, agreeing well with the statistical average particle size (38 nm) in Fig. S5. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 3c) and the corresponding EDX mapping further confirmed the uniform distribution of Ni and Fe elements in the nanoparticles for sample Ni1.8Fe1.5 (Figs. S10 and S11). In addition, the linear scanning pattern also revealed that Ni and Fe were perfect mixed, verifying the formation of Ni3Fe intermetallic compound (Fig. 3d). The stable formation of Ni3Fe in the catalyst might be attributed to the protection of the coated carbon layers [74]. To uncover the electronic state as well as the surface composition of the NiFe particles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed (Fig. 4 ). Peak fitting results of the Ni 2p and Fe 2p spectra were summarized in Table S5. For Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample, the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum exhibited two divided peaks, locating at 854.0 and 855.7 eV, which could be assigned to Ni0 and Ni2+, respectively [75–77]. The Fe 2p3/2 spectrum peaks [78,79] at 707.0 eV, 710.2 eV and 712.4 eV belonged to 2p3/2 of Fe0, Fe2+ and Fe3+. Peak deconvolution results suggested that the proportion of Fe0 was approximately 28.6%, slightly higher than that in Ni1.8Fe0.6 (24.9%) and Ni1.8Fe1.0 (26.8%), but lower than that in Ni1.8Fe3.0 (30%). The result implied that Ni could promote the reduction of Fe. H2-TPR profiles of synthesized NixFey samples also supported this deduction (Fig. S12). The reduction peaks in H2-TPR profiles shifted for both Ni and Fe indicated that the interaction was formed between Ni and Fe species in the NixFey samples and the reduction of Fe could be promoted by addition of Ni [80], which consisted well with the XPS analysis."
10,Catalytic performance: Screening of stearic acid hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performance: Screening of stearic acid hydrogenation The catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts for the hydrogenation of stearic acid (STA) was evaluated at 250 °C and 5 MPa H2, as shown in Table 1 . The monometallic Fe1.5 catalyst was identified to be inert with a conversion below 1% (Table 1, Entry 7). The Ni1.8 catalyst was better than the Fe1.5 catalyst, giving a 12% conversion of STA but the products were mainly C36 compounds such as octadecyl stearate and stearone, while the selectivity of stearic alcohol was only 25% (Table 1, Entry 6). Octadecyl stearate was produced by the esterification of stearic acid with stearyl alcohol and stearone was formed via ketonization of stearic acid (scheme 2 ). Once NiFe bimetallic catalysts were employed, highly conversion and selectivity were achieved (Table 1, Entry 1–4). STA conversion was 14% over Ni1.8Fe0.6 and 60% on Ni1.8Fe1.0 catalysts. However, the higher iron content did not always mean a better result. Over the highest Fe containing catalyst Ni1.8Fe3.0, STA conversion only increased to 70% and Ni1.8Fe1.5 presented the best performance among all the investigated NixFey catalysts. After 5 h of reaction, the conversion of STA and selectivity of stearic alcohol over Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst could reach 99% and 98% (Table 1, Entry 2), respectively. Interestingly, the selectivity towards stearic alcohol had no relationship to the varied Fe/Ni molar ratios, maintaining at around 98%. In Fig. S13, the initial hydrogenation activity calculated from the early stage showed remarkable increase when Fe was added, The TOF of Ni1.8Fe1.5 was calculated to be 110 h−1, 52 fold higher than that of Ni1.5. These results suggested that the formation of the NiFe intermetallic compound was beneficial to the hydrogenation of the carboxyl group, yielding alcohol as the major product. According to the above XRD (Fig. 2) and TEM (Fig. 3) characterization, Ni3Fe intermetallic compound was confirmed as the main component in the as-synthesized NixFey, though minor metal oxide existed. To reveal the effect of the metal oxide during the catalyst preparation, the catalytic hydrogenation of NiFeOx as well as activated carbon supported NiO and Fe2O3 were also studied for reference. Under the same conditions, even reacted for 20 h, neither NiO/AC nor Fe2O3/AC was effective for STA conversion (Table 1, Entry 8–9). And only 15% selectivity of stearic alcohol with 75% conversion was achieved when NiFeOx was used for the hydrogenation of stearic acid (Table 1, Entry 10). After Ni1.8Fe1.5 was treated with 2 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 8 h, most of FeNi metal was removed, accompanied by activity loss (Table 1, Entry 11), indicating that the pure carbon layer was not responsible for the hydrogenation of STA. Moreover, only 26% conversion was achieved over Ni3Fe1/SiO2 catalyst prepared by wet-impregnation method (Table 1, Entry 12). The distinct catalytic performance revealed the advantage of the catalyst prepared by facile in-situ carbonization and reduction method in the hydrogenation of stearic acid to an alcohol. In addition, a physical mixture of Ni1.8 and Fe1.5 was also employed in the catalytic reaction. The conversion and product distribution were similar to those of mono Ni1.8 (Table 1, Entry 5), which indicated that the synergistic effect between the Ni and Fe species occurred only when the iron-nickel atoms were close together. Therefore, here came to the conclusion that the enhanced catalytic activity of those NixFey catalysts was mainly due to the formation of Ni3Fe intermetallic compound. It was generally recognized that the catalytic reaction was reacted on the catalyst surface. Considering that XPS reflected the area where the surface depth was less than 10 nm, herein a parameter was defined and attempted to associate the catalytic activity with the surface active species. If the calculated Ni/Fe < 3 (obtained from ICP), it meant that Fe was overmuch, then Surface Ni3Fe contents = (surface Ni contents obtained from XPS × Ni contents confirmed by ICP)/3 Whereas, when the calculated Ni/Fe > 3 (confirmed by ICP), it meant that Ni was overmuch, then Surface Ni3Fe contents = (Fe contents obtained from XPS × Fe contents confirmed by ICP) The relationship between the surface Ni3Fe contents and STA conversion was presented in Fig. 5 . Diverse activity among those NixFey catalysts can be normalized to the difference in the surface Ni3Fe content, and the conversion of STA showed a positive correlation with the surface Ni3Fe content. Surface Ni3Fe content on Ni1.8Fe1.5 surface was calculated to be 0.31% with the highest activity (Table 1, Entry 2). In contrast, surface Ni3Fe intermetallic compound content on Ni1.8Fe3.0, Ni1.8Fe1.0, and Ni1.8Fe0.6 decreased to 0.18%, 0.14% and 0.12%, respectively. Combining with those data, we considered that Ni3Fe intermetallic compound content was the real key active species in the Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample and the difference in catalytic activity may derive from the Ni3Fe content in varied catalysts. According to the structural formula in Ni3Fe, Ni3Fe1/SiO2 was prepared by wet-impregnation method, and then was reduced by H2. The reduced Ni3Fe1/SiO2 was also effective for STA converting, resulting in a 26% conversion of STA with a high selectivity to stearic alcohol (97%). The XRD pattern of the reduced Ni3Fe1/SiO2 catalyst was assigned to cubic Ni3Fe (Fig. S14). These results also verified that Ni3Fe was the active species in this reaction."
11,DFT calculation,"3.3 DFT calculation According to XRD data (Fig. 2) and the control experiments (Table 1), Ni3Fe was speculated to be the active components. Thus, we established the Ni3Fe (1 1 1) model containing a 4-layer slab with 64 atoms. For comparison, slabs of pure Ni (1 1 1) and Fe (1 1 0) were also modeled. Due to the huge molecular structure of stearic acid, propionic acid was applied as a simplified model of stearic acid to study the reason for improved performance of the NixFey. Typically, the adsorption of the substrates plays an important role in the performance of heterogeneous catalysts. We firstly investigated the adsorption configuration and energy of the propionic acid and H on the surface of Ni3Fe (1 1 1), Fe (1 1 0) and Ni (1 1 1). The optimized adsorption structures of the propionic acid in three models were shown in Fig. 6 and the corresponding adsorption energies (E ads) of the upright configuration were −0.31 eV, −0.26 eV and −0.15 eV, respectively. Obviously, the adsorption energy of the propionic acid on Ni3Fe surface was two folds than that on Ni surface and was close to the corresponding energy on the Fe surface. Thereby we inferred that the addition of Fe can promote the adsorption of the propionic acid, which was quite similar with the case of furfural adsorption over the NiFe [57] and acetic acid adsorption on Fe-modified Ru surface [40,41]. Then we tested the adsorption of hydrogen (another substrate) on three surfaces. Adsorption structures of H on the Ni3Fe (1 1 1), Fe (1 1 0) and Ni (1 1 1) surfaces were shown in Fig. S15 and the corresponding adsorption energies were calculated to be 0.45 eV, 0.53 eV and 0.40 eV, respectively. Herein, EA/EH defined as the adsorption energy ratio between propionic acid and hydrogen was used to evaluate the competitive adsorption strength on the catalyst surface (Table 2 ). When the ratio of EA/EH was close to 1, it meant that both propionic acid and hydrogen were able to adequately adsorb on the surface, favoring the further hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. Evidently, the EA/EH ratio on the three surfaces decreased progressively in the order: Ni3Fe (1 1 1) > Fe (1 1 0) > Ni (1 1 1). The strong adsorption of H on the pure Fe and Ni surface can lead to unfavorable adsorption of propionic acid, and thus inhibited the hydrogenation reaction. While on the Ni3Fe surface, the favorable adsorption of propionic acid made it easy to be fixed on the metal surface and the suitable adsorption of H was beneficial to the further hydrogenation procedures, which can explain the good catalytic performance of Ni3Fe intermetallic compound. This conclusion fitted well with the experimental results obtained in Fe1.5, Ni1.8 and Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst system. Completely conversion of stearic acid can be obtained over the Ni3Fe intermetallic compound catalyst. However, negligible less than 1% and 12% conversion were achieved on pure Fe and Ni based catalysts, respectively. Kinetic analysis was then used to explore the competitive adsorption of the two reactants (Fig. 7 ). First of all, the effect of the catalyst size on the hydrogenation activity was studied. The internal diffusion could be eliminated when the catalyst was sifted by 300 meshes (Fig. 7A). Fig. 7Bshowed the evolution of the conversion with time at different stirring rates. Once the stirring rate exceeded 700 rpm, the hydrogenation activity showed no activity rise with the increasing stirring rate, thus the external diffusion was eliminated. The effect of hydrogen pressure on the reaction activity was investigated. TOF value was used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of Ni1.8Fe1.5 and Ni1.8 catalyst with keeping the conversion of STA lower than 20%. A linear relationship between ln (TOF) and ln (P) could be obtained, and the slope represented the reaction order with respect to hydrogen (Fig. 7C and D). The reaction order to hydrogen over Ni1.8 catalyst was calculated to be 0.6, while this value increased to 1.6 over Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst. The enhanced hydrogen reaction order on Ni1.8Fe1.5 indicated the less accessibility of hydrogen and the promotional adsorption of STA with doping Fe, which consisted well with the EA/EH derived by DFT calculation. In addition to the hydrogenation activity of propionic acid, the selectivity of alcohol was also an important factor in evaluating the catalyst performance. The conversion of STA on Ni1.8Fe1.5 sample can realize a high selectivity of 98% towards octadecyl alcohol, while only 25% selectivity acquired over pure Ni catalysts. Therefore, we calculated the reaction path of the propionic acid hydrogenation on the Ni3Fe surface (Fig. 8 ). First of all, the propionic acid adsorbed on the surface in an upright form may undergo two different processes to form the CH3CH2CO* intermediate, i.e., dehydrogenation (TS1) followed by deoxygenation (TS2) or the direct dehydroxylation route. The activation energies for deoxygenation and dehydroxylation were 2.09 and 1.50 eV, respectively, which suggested that the direct dehydroxylation route was more energy feasible. Subsequently, the CH3CH2CO* intermediate may experience the decarbonylation process (red line) to produce CH3CH2* intermediate, or the deoxygenation route (green line) to generate CH3CH2C* intermediate, or the hydrogenation path (blue line, TS3) to form CH3CH2CHO* intermediate. The calculated activation energies of these three routes were 1.05, 0.86 and 0.75 eV, respectively. Therefore, it was more inclined to generate CH3CH2CHO* species. Subsequently, the CH3CH2CHO* intermediate underwent further hydrogenation to produce propanol, which corresponded to the target product stearic alcohol. Based on the experimental and computational results presented herein, a reasonable reaction mechanism of STA hydrogenation over the Ni3Fe intermetallic compound was proposed. Fatty acid was absorbed on Fe sites to form the C16H33CH2CO* intermediate. H2 was activated and anchored on Ni sites and then the absorbed H spilt over to Fe sites. In the following, the C16H33CH2CO* intermediate reacted with the activated H, forming the C16H33CH2CHO* intermediate. Subsequently, C16H33CH2CHO* intermediate was rapidly hydrogenated to stearic alcohols."
12,Temperature effect,"3.4 Temperature effect The effect of reaction temperature was examined over the Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst system, and results showed that the reaction temperature notably affected the catalyst activity and product distribution (Fig. 9 ). Stearic acid conversion was very low at 190 °C (5.5%), yielding approximately 4% stearic alcohol, and other side-products were mainly C36 compounds. Remarkably, both the conversion of STA and selectivity to stearic alcohol immensely increased when the reaction temperature was raised to 230 °C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 250 °C or even to 270 °C led to a conversion up to almost 100%, while the selectivity to stearic alcohol remained unchanged (98%). It should be noted that even when reaction time was prolonged to 20 h, no decrease in selectivity was observed. The calculated equilibrium constant for the hydrogenation of stearic acid to stearic alcohol at 260 °C was approximately 57, which might explain why the aldehyde was undetectable under the reaction conditions [32]."
13,Reusability of Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst,"3.5 Reusability of Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst Robust reusability was a vital evaluating indicator for heterogeneous catalyst to evaluate its potential industrial application, thus the recycling test was conducted over Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst (Fig. 10 A). In order to make accurate assessment on the recycling ability, the conversion of STA was constrained at around 90%, and the reaction time was determined to be 2 h. Afterthereaction, the used Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst was handily separated by a permanent magnet (Fig. S16). It was found that there was a slight loss in catalytic activity (conversion decreases from 93% to 89%) while selectivity towards stearic alcohol remained about 98% even after the fifth recycling test. The XPS spectra of the used catalyst revealed that the percentage of Ni0 and Fe0 was barely changed compared with the origin state (Fig. 4) or even with the in-situ XPS of the Ni1.8Fe1.5 (Fig. S17). Besides, three peaks in XRD pattern belonged to Ni3Fe intermetallic compound (Fig. 10B) showed no obvious changes compared with the fresh catalyst, which also demonstrated the excellent stability of the Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, we developed a low-cost, effective and environmentally benign carbon coating bimetallic NiFe catalyst for selective hydrogenation of fatty acid. The catalyst with an appropriate Ni/Fe atomic ratio showed an excellent selectivity to fatty alcohol. Under the optimized conditions, high stearic acid conversion (>99%) and remarkable selectivity (≈98%) toward fatty alcohol could be achieved on the Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst. The combined characterization verified that a high fraction of Ni and Fe formed as Ni3Fe intermetallic compound in the Ni1.8Fe1.5 catalyst. The synergistic effect between the closely contacted Ni and Fe species was necessary for the high selectivity. DFT calculations suggested that the high selectivity for alcohol in the FeNi catalyst originated from the superior affinity of Fe with carboxyl groups and proper hydrogen dissociation ability of Ni. In addition, the catalyst was recyclable and could be conveniently separated with a magnet. More importantly, even Ni1.8Fe1.5 was exposed in the air for six months, excellent catalytic activity still remained, indicating its fairlyhighstability. This work demonstrated a new approach for earth-abundant inexpensive FeNi to produce fatty alcohol from the direct catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acid with high activity and stability."
