0,Introduction,"The overexploitation of fossil fuels has now brought humankind to a dead end from both an environmental and energy resource standpoint. It is undeniably true that fossil fuel reserves are not endless [16]. A pressing need has thus emerged to identify and exploit alternative energy sources; i.e., energy sources that will be both renewable and environmental friendly. Biohydrogen, i.e., hydrogen produced from renewable sources, has the highest specific energy and generates zero CO2 emissions when burned for energy recovery [14,13,16]. Dark fermentation is an attractive treatment strategy for hydrogen production (HP) from waste [12,24,26,27,9] as well as for reducing the problem of disposal. HP from IMSW, which is ultimately converted into Hs and CO2, includes three steps [24–28] and is performed by microbial consortia comprising Eubacteria (hydrolytic-acidogenic bacteria and acetogenic bacteria). In the first step (hydrolysis), complex organic polymers are hydrolysed into simpler soluble organic compounds by hydrolytic-acidogenic bacteria. Large quantities of H2 are produced in this step, particularly in dry anaerobic digestion (AD). In the second step (acidogenesis), hydrolytic-acidogenic bacteria produce volatile fatty acids (VFA), alcohols, H2 and CO2. In the third step (acetogenesis), acid acetic, H2 and CO2 are produced by acetogens, organisms that consume fermentation products such as propionate, butyrate, lactate and ethanol. These bacteria (acetogens) require very low H2 partial pressure to promote the thermodynamics of the reactions. Therefore, the acetogens in a H2-producing reactor are inactive [2,7,23,19,11,27]. Previous studies on dark fermentation of IMSW have shown that destabilization of HP in continuously stirred tank reactors without recycling of biomass occurs due to wash-out of the bacteria and not because of over-loading [26,27]. Hence, the interesting option of co-digestion of readily biodegradable organic substances, such as glycerol, could increase the load of biodegradable organic matter and lead to a higher biogas yield [3,8], without having to wash out the microorganisms. Although [8], published a study on the effect of adding 1% v/v glycerol to the AD of the synthetic organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) (40% fruit, 25% potatoes, 25% vegetables, 8% bread and 2% paper), no prior studies have been published on the effect of glycerol addition to dark fermentation of real IMSW. The effect of this addition on the microbial groups involved in the digestion process, which have varying sensitivities to environmental changes [24–28], has not been investigated either. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 1% supplementations of glycerol on the dark fermentation of IMSW, a waste that is a well-known substrate for HP [24,26,28]. Anaerobic batch reactors were used for this purpose. The following parameters were considered in this study: HP, SHP, soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODD), VFA, total volatile solid (TVS), hydrolysis yield, acidification yield and microbial activity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), employing different oligonucleotide probes, was used to determine the main groups involved in the anaerobic process (Eubacteria and Archaea)."
1,Material and methods,
2,Inoculum and substrate,"2.1 Inoculum and substrate Anaerobic digester effluent from a thermophilic-dry dark reactor was used as inoculum. In previous studies, the thermophilic inoculum was found to be suitable for anaerobic digestion of solid waste [24,27]. Its main characteristics were: TVS=37±2g TVS/l, CODD =42±5g O2/l, VFA=7.4±1.2g acetic/l and pH=5.6±0.3. The IMSW and glycerol used to feed the reactors came from an industrial trommel (30mm) at Las Calandrias MSW treatment plant (composting plant), located in Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz-Spain, and Abengoa Bioenergy biofuel company, based in San Roque, Cádiz-Spain, respectively. The IMSW was stored in 25kg drums at 4°C to avoid anaerobic degradation by the microorganisms found in the solid waste itself. Characterization of the substrates used in the assay is shown in Tables 1 and 2 ."
3,Experimental reactors,"2.2 Experimental reactors The assays were carried out in eight batch discontinuous reactors, three for each condition (0% and 1%) +2 blanks (inoculum without waste), with a total volume of 2.0l and a useful volume of 1.7l. Each reactor had an independent agitation system capable of maintaining a uniform moisture content and of redistributing soluble substrate and microorganisms at a rate of 23rpm, in addition to electrical temperature control. The biogas was collected in 5l capacity Tedlar (a polyvinyl fluoride plastic polymer) bags. The digesters (except for the blanks) were initially loaded with a mixture of inoculum (700g) and substrate (351g IMSW in 1l tap water), resulting in a final concentration of 40% v/v inoculum, which is considered optimum for biogas production and substrate acclimatization [15]. Glycerol was then added to the reactors to provide glycerol percentages in the 0% v/v (Test 1) and 1% v/v (Test 2) range. Blanks were loaded with inoculum (700g) to determine background gas production. All the results presented in this paper were corrected by subtracting the HP obtained from the blanks. The reactors were monitored until reaching a plateau of HP; this represented a monitoring period of at least 12days."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The analytical determinations performed in this study can be grouped into two categories: physicochemical analysis and microbiological analysis. 2.3.1 Physicochemical analysis For process monitoring and control of the reactors, the following analytical determinations were performed: biogas, CODD, pH, TVS and VFA. All analyses were carried out in duplicate according to APHA [1] and Zahedi et al. [24–28]. The TVS, VFA and CODD of the digester liquor were measured on days 0, 3, 7 and 12. VFA were determined by gas chromatography, using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column filled with Nukol. The digesters were monitored daily for biogas (production and composition) and pH. The gas volume produced in the reactor was directly measured using a high-precision flow gas meter: TG-01-Series (Wet-Type) Ritter drum-type gas meter. The composition of the biogas was determined by gas chromatography separation (SHIMADZU GC-2010). H2, CH4, CO2, O2 and N2 were analyzed by means of a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot column. Samples were taken using a 1ml Dynatech Gastight gas syringe under the following operating conditions: split=100; constant pressure in the injection port (70kPa); 2min at 40°C; ramped at 40°C/min until 200°C; 1.5min at 200°C; detector temperature: 250°C; and injector temperature: 200°C. Helium was used as carrier gas (266.2ml/min). Commercial mixtures of H2, CH4, CO2, O2, N2 and H2S (Abelló Linde S.A.) were used to calibrate the system. 2.3.2 Microbiological analysis Microbiological analyses were performed by FISH. Two specific probes (EUB338 and ARC915) were used to determine the cellular concentration and relative percentages of Eubacteria and Archaea. The overall population was calculated as the sum of the relative amounts of Eubacteria and Archaea, estimated as 100% [29]. Prior to incubation and once the digestion period had ended, samples were collected in each condition from each reactor in sterile universal bottles. Absolute ethanol was added to the bottles at a volume ratio of 1 sample:1 ethanol. Samples were stored at −20°C until they were fixed (within one month). The samples were pre-treated prior to FISH analysis. The pre-treatment applied for the microbiological count of high solid content samples comprised the addition of Tween 80 followed by 120s of shaking [24–28]. The main steps of FISH for whole cells using 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes are cell fixation, subsequent permeabilization and hybridization with the desired probe(s). The 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide, incubated temperature and hybridization time (isotonic moisture chamber) probes employed in this study are given in Table 3 . All probes were labelled with 6-FAM at the 50 terminal. The samples were examined visually and the cells were counted using an Axio Imager Upright epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with a 100W mercury lamp and an x100 oil objective."
5,"Efficiency parameters: hydrolysis yield, acidification yield and microbial activity","2.4 Efficiency parameters: hydrolysis yield, acidification yield and microbial activity The parameters chosen to evaluate the HP process were hydrolysis yield, acidification yield and microbial activity. The hydrolysis yield was defined as liquefaction or solubilization of organic matter and was calculated according to the following equation [6,5]: (1) Hydrolysis yield = Ss Si ∗ 100 where Si is the initial total substrate concentration (total chemical oxygen demand) and Ss is the soluble output CODD. Acidification yield was calculated via soluble COD by means of the following equation [5]: (2) Acidification yield = S TVFA Ss ∗ 100 where S TVFA is the concentration of total VFA generated, expressed as mg COD/l using the theoretical COD equivalents for each VFA. The microbial activity parameter was used to evaluate biochemical activity. This parameter was calculated as the ratio of H2 volume generated and the number of microorganisms inside the reactor [26]."
6,Results,"In this section, a comparison between the additions (1% v/v) or not of crude glycerol to the HP steps in thermophilic-dry dark fermentation of IMSW in batch mode is studied. The results are shown in Table 4 . All conditions were run in triplicate reactors and the presented data comprises averaged values."
7,"pH, CODD and VFA","3.1 pH, CODD and VFA Fig. 1 a shows the evolution of pH for each condition. NaOH (10M) was added at the beginning (no later than five working days) to adjust the pH of the reactors when the pH of the effluent was below 5.5 in order to facilitate dark-fermentation [27]. The systems were subsequently capable of self-regulating for enhanced microbial activity [22,5,24,26,27]. Note that, although increases in pH were high for enhanced methanogen activity, no methanogenic activity was observed (the biogas was methane free). This is due to the high VFA and HP values inside the reactors [10,17]. The final values of VFA and CODD in each test are shown in Table 4. As can be seen, this study showed the typical evolution of CODD and VFA (Fig. 1b and c). Initially, prior to incubation, low values were observed, subsequently increasing until day 7 due to acidogenic activity [24,27]. This was in keeping with the increase in HP. The predominant fermentation product was butyric acid for 0% glycerol and 1% glycerol (Fig 2 ). In both tests, the ratio of butyrate to acetate (B/A ratio) was higher than 1. This ratio was similar to those obtained by Ueno et al. [21] and Shin et al. [20]. In neither test did the amount of propionic acid and/or caproic acid generated during the assay produce an inhibitory effect [18,26]."
8,Biogas production and yields of the process,"3.2 Biogas production and yields of the process Hydrolysis and acidogenic yield values are shown in Table 4. As can be seen, the hydrolysis yield was higher in Test 2, while the acidogenic yield was higher in Test 1. This indicates that hydrolysis activity became more active when glycerol was added, though this was not the case for acidogenic activity. This is because the CODD values observed in Test 2 were higher than those in Test 1 and no major differences were observed in the VFA values thus generated. The average hydrolysis yields obtained for Test 2 were in the 71–79% range. These are significantly higher than those obtained by De la Rubia et al. [5] (between 21% and 30%) for hydrolysis of sunflower oil cake waste under mesophilic conditions and those obtained by D’Addario et al. [4] (11% solubilization yield) and Zahedi et al. [27] (lower than 70%) during acidogenic fermentation of municipal solid waste. As to the acidification yield, the highest average values (52–56%) were in line with those obtained by Zahedi et al. [27] (lower than 60%). As regards HP, Fig. 3 shows the evolution over time of the biogas produced in each condition (minus the inoculum production effect). As can be seen, the concentration of glycerol conditioned HP. The main biogas production in both Test 1 and Test 2 was detected in the period of 3–7d, in keeping with the increase in VFA and CODD (Fig. 1b and c). As observed in Fig. 3 and Table 4, the highest net accumulated hydrogen (2.32±0.21l CH4/l) was reported for Test 2 when 1% v/v glycerol was added to the AD batch processing of IMSW. The results were in keeping with the high values of hydrolysis yield (75±4%) and SHP (51±4l H2/kg TVS) (Table 4)."
9,Microbial population dynamics,"3.3 Microbial population dynamics The concentrations of microorganisms in the effluent at the end of the different tests were studied. The amounts and relative percentages of the main microbial groups are shown in Table 4. Microbial populations in the reactors logically consisted of Eubacteria and Archaea, with higher proportions of Eubacteria in all cases, as anaerobic reactors contain a much larger Eubacteria population than that of Archaea [24,25,27,28]. The final values of Eubacteria were in the 79–88% range. These results are similar to previous studies on dark fermentation [27]. The Archaea content in the reactors was not significant, the biogas produced being methane-free in all reactors. The presence of these microorganisms is due to their contribution in the substrate and inoculum, although they are inhibited by the medium conditions in the reactor, which are not suitable for them. The dark anaerobic digestion resulted in an increase in the microbial community, especially in Test 2, where higher values of HP, SHP, CODD and similar values of VFA were obtained. To evaluate the effect of microorganisms onto HP, it has been considered microbial activity parameter (Table 4). The results clearly show that maximum activity was achieved in Test 2, coinciding with maximum HP and SHP. In summary, when 1% v/v glycerol was added to the dark fermentation of IMSW (Test 2), the maximum values of HP (2.32±0.21l H2/l), SHP (51±4l H2/kg TVS) and microbial activity (7.3∗10−12 ±0.9∗10−12 l H2/cell) were recorded. These results were in keeping with the high values of hydrolysis yield (75±4%), CODD (57±4g O2/l) and VFA (19±1g acetic/l), with average values of the Eubacteria:Archaea ratio at the end of the assay of 85:5. This paper provides useful information leading to more in-depth knowledge on HP from dark fermentation of IMSW with added glycerol. Future studies on the addition of glycerol to AD of IMSW in continuous or semi-continuous mode without recycling of the biomass are needed to provide further information"
10,Conclusion,"Bearing in mind the results obtained, dark fermentation of IMSW in batch mode can be significantly enhanced by the addition of glycerol. Specifically, by adding 1% v/v crude glycerol to IMSW, HP and SHP increased from 1.25±0.29l H2/l to 2.32±0.21l H2/l and from 25±4l H2/kg TVS to 51±4l H2/kg TVS, respectively. This was in keeping with the increase in the final hydrolysis yield (from 65±2 to 75±4) and microbial activity (from 3.9∗10−12 ±0.7∗10−12 l H2/cell to 7.3∗10−12 ±0.9∗10−12 l H2/cell)."
