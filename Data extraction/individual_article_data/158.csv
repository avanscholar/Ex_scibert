0,Introduction,"The need to replace fossil fuels with a cleaner source of energy has driven researchers to explore a wide variety of renewables. Recently, hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs) have gained much attention in the energy sector. HFCs generate electricity with only water and heat as the products of reaction, sans the greenhouse gases (CO2, NOx, etc.), rendering them eco-friendly. HFCs may be used to power electric vehicles and to provide heat and electricity to buildings. Hydrogen (H2), as a fuel, is considered a promising energy carrier. Its high energy yield and low heating value make H2 a more efficient fuel than the hydrocarbon-based fossil fuels [1]. As such, hydrogen has been pegged as the “fuel of the future” [2] for both stationary and transport applications [3]. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that H2 is produced from a wide range of sources, about 95% of which are derived from fossil-based fuel such oil, natural gas, and coal [4]. A large part of the industrial H2 is obtained from steam-methane reforming (SMR), while oil and coal gasification (CG) follow closely behind. These methods of producing H2 also generate greenhouse gases, which are considered drivers of climate change [4,5]. Only a small fraction, about 4%, of the global H2 supply is produced via electrolysis [4]. Although electrolysis appears to be a clean method of generating hydrogen, it requires a massive amount of energy. If the energy used to split the water atoms into H2 and oxygen (O2) atoms is derived from fossil-based energy, then the process is still far from being carbon-neutral. To be sustainable, H2 must be produced from renewables. H2 obtained from biological processes (via microbial routes) is called biohydrogen. Compared to the conventional methods of H2 production, biohydrogen offers a more environment-friendly and less energy-intensive alternative. The present review 1) describes the different methods of biohydrogen production; 2) details the challenges and limitations of biohydrogen production; and 3) discusses future directions and opportunities."
1,Biohydrogen production,"Numerous studies have investigated H2 production via (direct and indirect) biophotolysis, (dark and photo-) fermentation, and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Fig. 1 shows the different methods of producing biohydrogen that may be used to fuel HFCs."
2,Biophotolysis,"2.1 Biophotolysis Select microorganisms have the ability to use light energy to split water molecules and produce H2. This light-driven process is called biophotolysis and can be further classified as either direct biophotolysis or indirect biophotolysis. Both green algae and cyanobacteria play important roles in biophotolysis. 2.1.1 Direct biophotolysis In direct biophotolysis, microalgae such as green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) or cyanobacteria (Synechocystis) convert water (substrate) into H2 and oxygen (O2) in the presence of light and carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis [6]. The microalgae have simple nutrient requirements and are easily cultivated. They are also good fixers of CO2. Corrêa et al. [7] used exhaust gases from diesel engines to cultivate Acutodesmus obliquus and reported a significant reduction in the CO2 and NOx content of the exhaust gases. In addition, microalgae proliferates just as well in salt- or wastewater as in freshwater [8]. All these indicate that direct biophotolysis has great potential for biohydrogen production. However, direct biophotolysis has several limitations, which include high O2 sensitivity, light requirement, and production of the explosive H2–O2 mixture resulting from the process. Section 3 discusses how these limitations, and those of other biohydrogen production methods, might be overcome. Sathyaprakasan and Kannan proposed economic models for biohydrogen production. They estimated the cost of producing H2 from direct photolysis that generates 1.68 mmol H2 per liter per hour to be AED 4930.1/kg H2 [9]. Their study and other similar studies that report the generation cost using different biohydrogen production methods are summarized in Table 4. 2.1.2 Indirect biophotolysis Indirect biophotolysis differs from direct photolysis in that O2 evolution occurs in a separate stage from H2 production [10]. The first stage involves photosynthesis of cyanobacteria, where CO2 and H2O are converted to organic substances and O2. This is followed by a light-independent reaction where the organic materials from the first stage are further broken down by the cyanobacteria into H2, CO2, and other soluble metabolites [11]. The separation of the O2-evolution phase from the H2-production phase eliminates two of the challenges associated with direct photolysis, which are O2 inhibition and the formation of the H2–O2 mixture [12]. Despite this, H2 production by indirect biophotolysis is still quite low. This may be attributed to the consumption of H2 by the hydrogenase enzyme [13]. Furthermore, this two-stage process requires a complex system that often leads to high investment and operational costs [11]. Sathyaprakasan and Kannan estimated the cost of H2 production from indirect photolysis that generates 0.36 mmol H2 per liter per hour to be AED 7.2/kg H2 [9]."
3,Fermentative biohydrogen production,"2.2 Fermentative biohydrogen production Fermentation is a biochemical process where microorganisms produce alcohols, acetone, H2, and CO2 from organic substrates (starch, lignin, cellulose, etc.) either in the presence or in the absence of O2 (anaerobic). In photofermentation, purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodobacter, Rhodobium, Rhodopseudomonas, and Rhodospirillum strains) capture light energy and convert organic acids generated during anaerobic fermentation to H2 and CO2 in a nitrogen-deficient environment (Fig. 2 a) [11,13,14]. These photosynthetic microorganisms exist in the natural environment and are able to process a wide range of substrates over a broad spectrum of light [15]. But unlike biophotolysis, this photofermentation does not produce O2 that inhibits H2 production. Photofermenters either capture light energy from the sun or use artificial light. Although the sun is a cheap source of energy, it limits the biohydrogen production to daytime only. On the other hand, the use of artificial light, such as tungsten lamps, to provide the light energy allows the production to proceed through the night. However, this will require additional investment (photofermenter), and operating costs (energy requirement) as well [11], similar to biophotolysis. H2 yield for this light-driven process depends on several factors including light intensity, design of the photofermenter, type of microorganism and medium, and organic substrate, among others [14]. Its yield is comparable to that of biophotolysis [16]. In contrast, dark fermentation (DF) does not require light to produce H2 (Fig. 2b). This process is carried out by either obligate or facultative anaerobic fermentative bacteria such as Clostridia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Alcaligenes, and Bacillus strains [17]. The theoretical yield of H2 from DF may be estimated based on the metabolic pathway of the microorganism used and on the sugar concentration of the fermentation medium. H2 production via DF may be produced via the acetic acid pathway or the butyric acid (CH3CH2CH2COOH) pathway. When acetic acid is formed as a by-product the theoretical H2 yield is 4 mol of H2 per mole of glucose, in contrast to only 2 mol of H2 produced per mole of glucose when butyric acid is the end-product [18]. One important factor that affects the H2 yield of these fermentative processes is the choice of substrate (or the carbon source). The use of easily fermented sugars such as glucose and sucrose have been widely investigated in biohydrogen production via fermentation [19–25]. However, the widely available and naturally occurring organic substrates from agricultural residues, food wastes, livestock wastes, sewage sludge and wastewater have gained much attention due to bioremediation and to their cost-effectiveness—two crucial factors in the production of biohydrogen on an industrial scale [16]. Many studies have focused on the use of these substrates in an effort to both clean up the environment and produce clean energy with as little cost as possible [26–35]. 2.2.1 Substrate pre-treatment methods The organic wastes are composed of complex, long polymer chains. As such, fermentation of organic substrates usually takes longer and often results in low H2 yield. To increase the rate of reaction and amount of H2 produced, pre-treatment of organic wastes is necessary. The primary objective of pre-treatment methods is to break down the complex structure of organic wastes into a form that is easily fermentable. Pre-treatment methods can be broadly classified as physical (milling and grinding, thermal, microwave, and ultrasound irradiation), chemical (ionic substances, acids, alkalis, ozonolysis), physicochemical (steam explosion and ammonia fiber expansion), and biological (fungi and enzymes) [36]. 2.2.2 Inoculum pre-treatment methods The microorganisms used in the fermentation process can be grown as a pure culture, a co-culture, or a mixed culture. Microorganisms used in co-cultures are carefully chosen based on the compatibility of their functions. For instance, a co-culture of cellulolytic and hydrogen-producing bacteria promotes faster conversion of cellulose into simpler sugars by the cellulolytic microorganisms. The simple sugars, in turn, are then consumed by the fermentative bacteria to produce H2 [37]. Mixed cultures are usually composed of three or more different microbial strains. They can be procured from sludge wastes, animal manure, and wastewater, among others. Mixed cultures have several advantages over pure strains, such as microbial diversity, versatile use of substrates, and having no sterilization requirements [33]. Consequently, mixed consortia are well suited for the dynamic and complex environment of wastewater treatment [15]. On the other hand, the presence of H2-consuming bacteria in the mixed consortium reduces the H2 yield. Hence, mixed cultures need to be treated to inhibit the activity of microorganisms that either consume hydrogen or alter the biochemical reactions that favor H2 synthesis, while allowing the H2-producing microorganisms to survive [17]. Inoculum pre-treatment methods include physical treatment (heat-shock treatment freezing and thawing; microwave and ultrasound irradiation; electric current; aeration; ultraviolet, infrared, and gamma irradiation) and chemical treatment (acid, alkali, load-shock treatment, methanogen inhibitors, and CO2 sparging, among others) [36]. Researchers have reported that application of these (substrate and inoculum) pre-treatment methods increased biohydrogen yield [25,28,30–33,35]. Table 1 lists some of the studies investigating biohydrogen production using fermentation processes. Fermentative biohydrogen production may be applied to a wide variety of substrates, using a broad selection of fermentative bacteria. This process combines bioremediation and by-product recovery, while simultaneously producing clean energy. Although these processes have been greatly investigated, there is still much to improve for these processes to be commercially feasible. Sathyaprakasan and Kannan estimated that H2 will cost AED 68.7/kg if produced from DF, while it will cost AED 13.6/kg if produced from fermentation. The estimates were based on a hydrogen production rate of 121 and 153 mmol H2 per liter per hour for DF and photofermentation, respectively [9]."
4,The microbial electrolysis cell,"2.3 The microbial electrolysis cell Lastly, biohydrogen may be generated by MECs. This relatively new technology is also known as electrofermentation or biocatalyzed electrolysis cells [39] or as microbial electrohydrogenesis cells [15]. This technology combines microbial metabolism with electrochemistry. An MEC is composed of two electrodes: an anode and a cathode. In an MEC, exoelectrogenic bacteria (also known as electrochemically active bacteria or EAB) convert organic matter to CO2, electrons (e–), and protons (H+). The e– are transferred to the anode, while the protons are released to the electrolyte solution. The e– then flow from the anode to the cathode through an external electric circuit and combine with free H+ to produce H2 in the O2-free cathode. To drive the flow of electrons, an external voltage must be applied to the MEC under biologically assisted conditions; nevertheless, the required voltage for MECs is much lower than that for electrolysis [40–43]. The inoculum used in MECs can be either a pure strain or a mixed consortium. A mixed culture is often preferred for the same reasons listed in the previous section. The inocula can be cultured from activated sludge, wastewater, sewage sludge, or fermentation effluent. The substrates used for this process vary from simple sugars such as glucose, to products of DF such as acetate and fermentation effluent, to wastewater. This suggests that the MEC is as capable of bioremediation and clean energy production as the fermentative processes of biohydrogen production. Several studies used acetate (a common by-product of fermentation) as a substrate for MECs [44–49]. Initially, the MEC design was composed of two electrodes separated by an ion-exchange membrane in a two-chamber system. The most common membrane used was the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) [41]. This design allowed the separate entrapment of CO2 at the anode from the H2 capture in the cathode [50]. It also prevented the consumption of H2 by the anodic bacteria [41]. Furthermore, the dual-chamber system enabled the collection of H2 with higher purity, as well as the prevention of fouling of the cathode by the anodic bacteria [50]. However, this led to significant energy losses and pH changes that inhibited H2 production [51], thus triggering the shift to single-chambered MECs (Fig. 3 ). Consequently, membrane-less chambers require smaller capital costs than dual-chambered MECs [51]. Moreover, the lack of a membrane reduces internal resistance; hence, the rate of hydrogen production is faster in a membrane-less MEC [39]. Nonetheless, one of the major drawbacks of a single-chambered MEC is the low hydrogen yield that is attributed to the activity of methanogens. Aiken et al. estimated the financial feasibility of MECs using various scenarios for domestic wastewater treatment. The researchers pegged the cost of producing 15 L of H2 per cubic meter of influent per day at £5.09 [52]. Table 2 presents a comparison of the different biohydrogen production methods (see Table 2). In general, the production of biohydrogen can be operated at ambient temperature and pressure with lower energy requirements than those of fossil-based H2 production. It can also be operated alongside bioremediation. As such, biohydrogen is a more environment-friendly option compared to fossil-derived H2."
5,Challenges in Biohydrogen Production,"The previous section discussed the various methods of generating biohydrogen. While it has been established that biohydrogen is a cleaner alternative to fossil-derived H2, a lot of work needs to be done to scale up these processes and improve hydrogen yield to completely replace fossil-based fuels. This section attempts to discuss the various challenges that need to be overcome for biohydrogen production to be commercially feasible and sustainable."
6,Biophotolysis,"3.1 Biophotolysis Hydrogen production through biophotolysis is characterized by low H2 yield, mainly attributed to the process sensitivity to O2 and low light conversion efficiency. The O2 evolved in the photosynthesis may be controlled by using O2-binding proteins and by inhibiting the production of O2. Sparging the headspace in the reactor with an inert gas can also bring down O2 levels. However, this requires additional operating costs. Several studies also suggest that the absence of certain nutrients such as sulfur and nitrogen from the medium used for the green algae can lead to nutrient deprivation, resulting in decreased O2 evolution and improving H2 yield. Another way to increase H2 yield is to metabolically engineer the cyanobacteria to prevent the consumption of H2 by hydrogenases [53]. Initial studies on genetically modified green algae and cyanobacteria reported an increase in the light conversion efficiency [54,55]. On top of these, direct biophotolysis also raises safety concerns, as H2 and O2 can be an explosive combination. Moreover, this light-driven process can only produce H2 when the microalgae are exposed to light. While the sun is a cheap source of light energy, closed systems will require artificial illumination, leading to more expensive bioreactors and adding to energy costs [15]. Other factors that affect biohydrogen yield include light-capturing efficiency and CO2 fixation efficiency of the microalgae [56], among others. Several approaches to improve H2 production via biophotolysis are under study. These include improvement of light utilization efficiencies [57] and bioreactor design, bioprospecting [58], microalgae metabolic and genetic engineering [59], and optimization of culture and process parameters [60]."
7,Fermentative biohydrogen production,"3.2 Fermentative biohydrogen production Substrates used for fermentative biohydrogen production can be quite costly. However, switching from simple sugars to agricultural, food, and livestock wastes can bring down operational costs. Using sewage sludge and wastewater as substrates can also address both bioremediation and energy production. Hydrogen yields can be improved by employing pre-treatment methods on 1) substrates and 2) inocula. Complex substrates need to be pre-treated to reduce the complex sugars into simpler sugars that can easily be fermented. On the other hand, selection of the appropriate microorganism is also critical in the design of the fermentative process, as it can affect the H2 yield. In addition, the biogas produced from these fermentative processes is a mixture of H2 and CO2. Consequently, there is a need to separate H2 from the mixture in a purification step. Apart from this, CO2 needs to be captured and sequestered to prevent CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, rendering the process carbon neutral. While the DF process is faster than either photofermentation or biophotolysis, its primary disadvantage lies in its low H2 yield caused by the various by-products formed in the reaction [39]. Aside from H2 and CO2, this process also generates metabolyte by-products such as butyric acid (C4H8O2), lactic acid (C3H6O3), and acetic acid (CH3COOH). Methanol (CH3OH), butanol (C4H10O), or acetone (C3H6O) may also be formed in the reaction. The biogas produced may also contain methane (CH4), and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as well, depending on the type of microorganism and substrate used [18]. Although these by-products are potential substrates for other methods of H2 production such as in a hybrid H2 production system, their formation causes the H2 yield to decrease by 1–2.5 mol of H2 per mole of glucose [16]. The H2 yield and rate of production for fermentative processes may be enhanced with the selection of appropriate microorganisms, pre-treatment technologies, and optimization of process and reactor parameters."
8,Microbial electrolysis cell,"3.3 Microbial electrolysis cell MEC architecture, electrode materials, type of inocula, nature of the substrate, applied potential, CH4 production, and the cost of materials and operation determine the performance of the MECs. The MEC is a novel technology for bioremediation and energy generation. However, there are a few hurdles that must be overcome prior to upscaling and commercialization. First, there is a need to optimize EAB as biocatalysts. To date, the exact mechanisms for electron transfer between a microorganism and the electrode is not yet fully understood. Second, the methanogenic activity contributes to the low H2 yield. Methanogens are organisms that transform organic matter to CH4. Methanogens in the anode and cathode not only compete with the EAB for the organic material in substrates but also consume H2. Thus, there is a need to further investigate strategies that can inhibit the activity of these methanogens before considering the commercial production of hydrogen via MECs [41]. Chemical inhibitors have been successful in suppressing the methanogens but added to the operational costs [42]. More research on methanogen suppression to improve H2 production needs to be undertaken. Finally, there is a need to explore other materials for electrodes. Materials with low cost and high electric conductivity are much desirable for upscale purposes. Another challenge that must be overcome by the MEC technology is the high capital cost of the cathode material and its catalyst, which contributes about 47–85% of the total costs [61]. Conventionally, platinum (Pt), the preferred catalyst for hydrogen production, is applied at the MEC cathode. Pt is a precious metal and is quite expensive; ergo, the search for a cheaper and more environment-friendly cathode has gained much attention [40,62–64]. In contrast, microbial cathodes, also known as biocathodes, are usually made from cheaper materials (such as carbon and graphite) in the presence of self-generating microbial populations that are able to use the electrons to produce H2 [65]. An MEC design that can integrate both high H2 yields and low costs is very much desirable for upscale purposes."
9,Future directions,"At the moment, the biohydrogen technologies previously discussed are still developing. More research must be directed to searching for cheaper substrates and cost-effective materials in reactor design. Integrating the biohydrogen production with wastewater treatment can also eliminate some costs. A deeper understanding of the hydrogen-producing microorganisms and the reactions that drive the H2 production can be applied to genetically engineer said microorganisms to increase H2 yield. So far, the production costs and the H2 yield from these technologies are still no match for the technology used to produce H2 from crude oil, coal, and natural gas. The most cost-effective method of producing hydrogen is carried out by CG and steam reforming of natural gas. Other methods also include biomass gasification and electrolysis. In their paper, Franchi et al. reported that the cost of producing hydrogen from steam reforming ranges from $1.33 to $2.30/kg of H2, compared to $2.50 to $5.30/kg of H2 from electrolysis and about $3.5/kg H2 from biomass gasification [66]. Similarly, in an economic survey conducted by Bartels et al., the group compared hydrogen production from various energy sources, and their findings are summarized in Table 3 . Their results show that H2 produced from coal gave the highest H2 yield per day at the lowest selling price, closely followed by H2 from natural gas. The high yield and low production costs make H2 from these fossil fuels commercially competitive with gasoline. Their study also reveals that H2 from electrolysis using solar, wind, and nuclear power are not as cost-effective as CG and SMR. It is also worth noting that their survey was based on data collected in 2007. It is most likely that these costs and yield may have improved over the years with the current advances and development in renewable energy technologies. Several studies have computed the cost of H2 generation from biophotolysis, fermentation, and MECs; these are summarized in Table 4 . In a similar vein, the data provided by Sathyaprakasan and Kannan and Aiken et al. were extracted to compare the various production technologies and their production rates and generation costs, as shown in Fig. 4 . Production rates were converted to mmol/L/h, while all generation costs were converted to US dollars. Fig. 4 illustrates the difference in H2 generation rates and costs between biohydrogen and H2 from fossil fuels. It can be observed that CG and SMR are found in the upper leftmost region, with both processes characterized by high production rates at low generation costs. In contrast, biohydrogen technologies are found near the bottom and farther to the right, indicating low yields at high generation costs. The figure emphasizes that cost-effective H2 production requires high yield and low generation costs, found on the upper left region of the figure. Hence, these biohydrogen technologies are yet to be considered financially viable, inviting more efforts to investigate optimization of the processes involved, thereby improving their cost-effectiveness. The above discussion establishes the need to bring down the cost of H2 production and improve H2 yield at the same time. Meanwhile, the previous section (Section 3: Challenges in Biohydrogen Production) outlines the various weaknesses of each of the biohydrogen production technologies. Table 2 highlights some of the concerns before upscaling of the processes. In general, H2 yield and production costs may be significantly improved by 1) metabolic and genetic engineering, 2) improved bioreactor design, and 3) integrating two or more biohydrogen production technologies. Herein lies the direction for future work and studies. All the biohydrogen production processes involve microorganisms that facilitate the production of H2. A deeper knowledge and understanding of these H2-producing organisms and the mechanisms used for H2 production make genetic and metabolic engineering plausible directions for future work. For instance, both biophotolyis and photofermentation processes involve uptake hydrogenases that lead to low hydrogen yield. Meanwhile, DF processes produce several by-products apart from H2, and biohydrogen production from MEC is also affected by methanogenic activity. These suggest that metabolic ang genetic engineering may be engaged to improve hydrogen yield by impairing the uptake hydrogenases, inhibiting specific metabolic pathways that compete with hydrogen production while restricting reactions that consume hydrogen. Bioreactor design is also an important factor in H2 production. A good design should be able to increase the production efficiency without raising production costs. For instance, for light-dependent reactions such as biophotolysis and photofermentation, an efficient bioreactor design would allow increased light penetration to increase H2 yield. Moreover, in DF and MEC, where CO2 is produced alongside H2, a good bioreactor design may involve a gas separation technology that can capture CO2 while simultaneously increasing the purity of the H2 produced. Finally, hybrid hydrogen production systems that integrate two or more technologies may improve H2 yield and reduce production costs as well. Several integrated systems are presented in the following section."
10,Hybrid hydrogen production systems,"4.1 Hybrid hydrogen production systems One hybrid hydrogen production system combines biophotolysis and photofermentation to produce H2. Both processes employ organisms that produce H2 in light-driven reactions. Melis and Melnicki proposed a system that involves the co-culture of green algae and photosynthetic strains that use different regions of the light spectrum to improve H2 yield. In their system, the green algae, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, use the visible region of the light spectrum, while the photosynthetic bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, use the near-infrared region of the spectrum to produce H2 [72]. This hybrid system makes use of the broad spectrum of light to produce H2. Another integrated system involves both DF and photofermentation. In this two-stage system, light-independent bacteria convert the organic substrates to VFAs and H2. Subsequently, the DF effluent containing the VFAs is further processed by photosynthetic bacteria to maximize H2 yield. Numerous studies have reported improved substrate utilization and increased H2 yields for this type of integrated system [73–82]. Fermentative methods of H2 production generate CO2 along with H2 and other gaseous products. Thus, another hybrid system integrates both fermentative processes (DF and photofermentation) with a microalgal culture that allows the capture of CO2 produced in the early stages of H2 production. Lo et al. exploited this kind of hybrid system where carbon-rich substrates were processed by Clostridium butyricum CGS5 to produce H2, CO2, and VFAs. The DF effluent then enters the photofermenter, where Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 converts VFAs to H2 and CO2. In the final stage of H2 production, the CO2 produced from the first two stages is fed to the bioreactor, where the microalgal culture (Chlorella vulgaris C–C) captures the CO2 [76]. A system that integrates DF with the MEC is yet another promising hybrid alternative. Low H2 yield from DF processes can be improved by integrating the process with MEC technology. The VFA-rich effluent from DF can be fed to the MEC as a substrate to further increase H2 production [83]. In their study, Marone et al. reported a 13-fold increase in hydrogen production when DF was coupled with MEC compared to hydrogen production from DF alone [47]. In a similar study, Nguyen et al. observed increased hydrogen production as well from a DF connected in series to an MEC when compared to the hydrogen yield from a dark fermenter or MEC alone. Their results showed that hydrogen produced from the two-stage DF-MEC system was 7.5 times higher than that from the conventional DF system and twice as high as that from MEC alone [84]. Some studies on integrated biohydrogen production are summarized in Table 5 ."
11,Future outlook,"The rapidly depleting supply of fossil fuels, deterioration of air quality, and global warming are greatly affecting the world's energy security and natural environment. These have driven several nations to explore renewable sources of energy that are also environment friendly. More and more national governments are now leaning towards hydrogen as a promising energy carrier, with fuel cells taking center stage. For many years, Japan has been promoting a society fully driven by hydrogen, a hydrogen society. Among Japan's multiple initiatives to support a hydrogen society are the following: The recently completed Harumi Flag showcases a town that is completely powered by hydrogen. Toyota's Mirai and Honda's Clarity Fuel Cell electric vehicles use HFCs [88]. Moreover, Japan's Fuel Cell Valley features a power-to-gas facility that harnesses solar power for electrolysis [89]. In the United States, California has been promoting fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) since 2015 and was the first state to launch FCEVs in the country. The Californian government offers incentives and fuel credits to attract buyers and lessees. This move has propelled other states to follow suit. Not to be left behind, South Korea has developed a Hydrogen Economy Roadmap that outlines specific plans to integrate FCEVs in their transportation sector. The South Korean government is aggressively promoting FCEVs by subsidizing the purchase of H2 vehicles. Moreover, South Korea is set to establish three demonstration cities by 2022 whose electricity, transportation, heating, and cooling are all powered by H2 [90]. It is also noteworthy that Hyundai's Nexo, an FCEV, is among the three active FCEVs in the market, alongside Toyota's Mirai and Hyundai's Clarity Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle. China has also recently released their Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap, which highlights the important role of FCEVs in decarbonizing their transport sector. The same document also pushes for more research and development in fuel cell technology. An increasing number of FCEVs and refueling stations are expected in the next few years [91,92]. Moreover, China has partnered with Norway in promoting their alkaline electrolysers [93]. Europe, on the other hand, is pushing for more research and development that can improve their capability to compete in the arena of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. European countries are also looking into promoting hydrogen production from renewables. Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Norway have invested in large-scale hydrogen production from electrolysis [93,94]. To date, the most popular method of producing clean hydrogen is via electrolysis. However, this method requires a great input of energy to break apart the water molecule into H2 and O2 molecules in an electrolyser, where 75% of the cost to generate H2 is attributed to electricity alone. Nonetheless, H2 production costs may improve when renewables such as wind and solar energy are used to power the electrolysers [95]. IRENA reports that the costs of electrolysers and electricity from renewables continue to drop as the technology improves, paving the way for H2 from these renewables to become the cheapest source of clean H2 in the near future [93]. With these policies in place, the demand for hydrogen in the next five to ten years is expected to increase drastically. Biohydrogen, although still in its developmental stage, offers a promising alternative for clean H2 supply."
12,Conclusion,"The world's increasing interest in hydrogen as a clean energy carrier is very real. Although electrolysis using renewables appears to be the main source of clean H2 at the moment, biohydrogen offers a promising alternative. The challenge lies in improving the current biohydrogen technologies, rendering them economically feasible for large-scale production. However, the current biohydrogen technologies are not yet at par with the conventional ways of producing H2 in terms of cost and yield. More research endeavors need to be undertaken to improve and optimize the present production technologies, aimed at increasing H2 yield and at the same time driving down costs. A more intensive search for cheaper substrates and cost-effective materials, the application of genetic engineering to improve the hydrogen-producing characteristics of microorganisms, efficient bioreactor design, and the combination of two or more biohydrogen processes in hybrid systems will go a long way towards improving these technologies."
