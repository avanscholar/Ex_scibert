0,Introduction,"Olefin polymerization is a commercially used process worldwide. It is used for the production of polyethylene and polypropylene among others, the annual production being of about 15 million tons [1]. Industrial-scale reactions such as hydroformylation, methanol carbonylation or the above-mentioned olefin polymerization processes are carried out using catalysts based on transition metal coordination compounds [2,3]. Chromium(III) compounds used as catalysts in various polymer synthesis have been studied and initiated by Hogan and Banks [4]. They found that silica doped with CrO3 chromium oxide have the catalytic activity for polyethylene polymerization. The activation of these catalysts is possible by the reaction of the complex compound with MAO (methylaluminoxane) or its derivative - MMAO (modified methylaluminoxane 7% aluminum in toluene). The discovery of methylaluminoxane by Sinna and Kamiński in the mid-1970s opened new possibilities for the study of homogeneous metallocene catalysts [5,6]. Catalysts based e.g. on amino-substituted cyclopentadienyl chromium(III) complexes have the high catalytic activity, while they were not stable at higher temperatures of industrial polymerization reactions [7]. Recent years have brought major advances in the use of catalytic reactions to understand their detailed mechanisms. This allowed to increase the efficiency and selectivity of the carried out processes. Modification of the coordination sphere of metals and the proper selection of ligands extend the possibilities of conducting reactions and their application. The selection of a ligand is very important because it affects steric hindrance and electron density, which allows to obtain catalysts with strictly defined properties [8,9]. The use of chromium(III) complexes with N - heterocyclic ligands such as 2,6 - pyridinedicarboxylate anion as catalysts make it possible to carry out reactions such as the beta-olefin polymerization at room temperature, with high yields of products [10–12]. The chromium(III) complexes with dipicolinate anion: [Cr(dipic)2][Cr(bipy)(dipic)(H2O)] ⋅ 2 H2O (where dipic = dipicolinate, bipy = 2,2′–bipyridine) and [Cr(dipic)2]Hdmbipy ⋅ 2.5 H2O (dmbipy = 4,4′-dimethoxy-2,2′-bipyridine) have the catalytic activities 2609.86 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1 and 2254.57 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1, respectively [10]. These values show that the newly obtained coordination compounds have a large potential as the oligomerization catalysts [10]. The Cr(dipic)(en)Cl, Cr(dipic)(bipy)Cl and Cr(dipic)(phen)Cl complexes where en denotes ethylenediamine and phen = 1,10-phenantroline exhibit the catalytic activity for oxidation of olefins [13]. The chromium(III) complexes with pyridine derivatives eg. [2,6-(1-alkylimidazol-2-ylidene)pyridine]CrCl3 after the reaction with methylaluminoxane exhibit the catalytic activity for the oligomerization of ethylene equal 40 000 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ bar−1 ⋅ h−1 [14]. Moreover, (benzyl)chromium(III) complexes are known as catalysts for the homogeneous ethylene polymerization [15]. The catalytic properties of these complexes are dependent on the solvent used in the polymerization. The highest yield of the ethylene polymerization reaction is 556 mg when using CH2Cl2 as the solvent, while the yield is 143 mg when toluene is used to the polymerization [15]. In this report we describe a new chromium(III) complex [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O and its physicochemical properties and the catalytic activity for the oligomerization reaction of 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol alcohol. In the first step, the titled complex has been characterized by several methods: X-Ray measurements, potentiometric and conductometric titrations, the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and the infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Due to the fact that the chromium(III) complexes are known for their antioxidant properties [16], the antioxidant activity of the titled complex against superoxide anion radicals has been studied by the nitro blue tetrazolium test (NBT). In the next step the catalytic activity of the Cr(III) complex has been check toward the oligomerization reaction of 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol alcohol. The oligomerization products have been thoroughly investigated and characterized."

8,Potentiometric titrations (PT),"2.7 Potentiometric titrations (PT) The microtitration system purchased from Cerko Lab with the measuring cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a pH combined electrode Schott–Blue Line 16 pH type and a 5-mL Hamilton’s syringe was used to perform PT. The calibration of the syringe was performed using a weight method. The electrode was calibrated according to IUPAC recommendations [23–25]. The measurements were conducted at 298.15 ± 0.10 K (the Lauda E100 circulation thermostat). The titrated solutions contained: (1) H2dipic (2 mM); (2) H2dipic (2 mM) + Cr3+ (2 mM). The standardized solution of NaOH at the 50 mM concentration was used in all experiments as the titrant. The titrant was added in increments of 0.002 mL every 60 s. The values of the equilibrium constants of all titrated systems have been determined using the Hyperquad 2008 (ver. 5.2.19) program [26,27]."

10,Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test,"2.9 Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test The antioxidants properties of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O against the superoxide anion radical have been examined by the NBT test. The procedure when using the NBT test was just like in the literature [28–31]. The reaction of the formazan formation has been monitored spectrophotometrically at 560 nm (the Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 UV–VIS spectrophotometer). L-ascorbic acid was applied in the NBT test as the standard substance. The obtained test results were presented as the percentage scavenging of the superoxide radical S(%): (A.1) S % = A 0 - A s / A 0 · 100 % where A0 is the value of the absorbance of the sample without the complex solution, As denotes the absorbance of the sample containing the antioxidant i.e. [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O. Moreover, in order to compare the antioxidant properties of the titled complex and other compounds with the antioxidant activity described in the literature, the L-ascorbic acid equivalent (EA) was calculated based on the formula: (A.2) EA = IC 50 ( c ) / IC 50 ( s ) where IC50(c) is the concentration of the [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O complex that causes 50% of scavenging of the superoxide anion radical, IC50(s) denotes the concentration of the L-ascorbic acid (the standard substance) that causes 50% of scavenging of the superoxide anion radical."
11,The oligomerization process,"2.10 The oligomerization process The entire oligomerization process was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere and at atmospheric pressure. The complex of chromium(III), [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O, was used as the catalyst. At the beginning, the complex (3 µmol, 1.03 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of toluene. The solution was placed in a glass tube sealed with a stopper and was constantly mixed (a magnetic stirrer). In the second step, 3 mL of MMAO-12 was added to the glass tube. In the last stage, 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol was slowly added dropwise and the solution was left to form a gel. After one hour, yellowish gel was obtained. The obtained product was dried and weighed in order to determine the efficiency of the process."
12,Results and discussion,
13,The structure of the new complex,"3.1 The structure of the new complex The crystal structure of the novel chromium(III) complex, [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O, has been studied by the X-ray diffraction method. The molecular structure of the new complex has been shown in Fig. 1 . The crystallographic data for [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O have been collected in Table 1. The geometric parameters (bond lengths and angles) characterizing [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]+ ion are typical for this unit (Fig. 1, Tables 2 and 3 ). In the crystal structure of the title compound cations are linked through OH⋯O hydrogen bonds to form tapes along the [1 0 1] direction, whereas Cl− anions interact with one water molecule via OH⋯Cl hydrogen bonds to produce the hybrid dihalide–dihydrate clusters of [Cl2(H2O)2]2− (Fig. 2 ) [32,33]. Such structure was also observed in Cu(II)-hydrogenpyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate complexes. The similar clusters are created through hydrogen bonds in these Cu(II) complexes. In addition, there exist also interconnected clusters of [Cl2(H2O)4]2− by forming hydrogen bonds [32,33]. X-ray analysis showed that the chromium complex(III) described in this work is characterized by a monoclinic crystallographic system and belongs to the spatial group P21/n. The dimensions of the elementary cell that creates the three-dimensional spatial structure of the studied complex are as follows: a = 11.3855(10) Å, b = 6.7259(6) Å, c = 17.1605(12) Å. The volume of the unit cell is 1299.47(18) Å3. The neighbouring tapes of cations are linked with the hybrid dichlorlide–dihydrate clusters by OH⋯O and OH⋯Cl hydrogen bonds forming a three-dimensional framework structure (Fig. 2)."
14,The stability of the titled compound in aqueous solutions (PT and CT),"3.2 The stability of the titled compound in aqueous solutions (PT and CT) The thermodynamic stability of the new chromium(III) complex in aqueous solutions has been investigated using the potentiometric titrations. For the needs of the Hyperquad2008 computer program, the model has been assumed in such a way that to receive the best fit of experimental data to the theoretical model. The following equation has been applied in the Hyperquad2008 program for the definition of the equilibrium constants: (A.3) pM + qL + rH = M p L q H r where M denotes Cr3+, L = dipicolinate anion, H = the proton, p, q, r = the stoichiometric coefficients for the reaction. The composition and logarithms of the stability constants (logβ pqr) have been collected in Table 4 . Based on the logβ pqr value analysis, it can be stated that complex ML2 is twice as stable in aqueous solutions as the ML complex. ML2 and MLH exhibit the similar stability in aqueous solutions. Among the individuals included in the mathematical model, in order to get the best fit of the experimental data to the theoretical calculations, the most stable is the complex ML2H. Additionally, the behavior of the [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O complex in aqueous solutions has been characterized by the conductometric titration (Fig. 3 ). The conductometric titration curve of 2,6 - pyridinedicarboxylic acid with the sodium base has been recorded. The formation of three chemical entities was confirmed: H2dipic, Hdipic− and dipic2−. The H2dipic form can be assigned with a conductivity of approximately 460 μS. The Hdipic− was formed at the nNaOH/nH2dipic ratio equal to 1 and a decrease in the conductivity of the solution was observed below 200 μS. An individual with the formula dipic2− was observed at nNaOH/nH2dipic equal to 2. In the attached graph (Fig. 3) it can be observed that the conductivity of the solution at this stage of the titration increases, which is due to the binding of hydronium ions. The [Cr(dipic)(H2O)2(OH)] complex is formed when the molar ratio nNaOH/nH2dipic equals 2. In this respect, a decrease in the conductivity was observed from about 800 µS/cm to just over 400 µS/cm. The initial reduction of the conductivity occurs due to the binding of a small amount of hydroxide ions derived from the weakly dissociated acid. In the point when the ratio of the number of moles of the titrant to H2dipic is 3.7, the formation of the [Cr(dipic)(OH)3]2− chemical entity was observed. At this point in the titration curve a slightly higher conductivity due to the addition of OH− ions was observed."
15,The antioxidant properties of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O,"3.3 The antioxidant properties of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O The antioxidant properties of the [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O complex compound have been determined based on the NBT test. L-ascorbic acid was used as the reference substance. The value of the equivalent of L - ascorbic acid for the chromium(III) complex equals 0.86. The IC50 value for L - ascorbic acid equals 0.22 while the value of this parameter for the tested complex equals 0.19. Based on the graph (Fig. 4 ) and comparing the IC50 values of the standard substance with the examined coordination compound, it was found that the concentration of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O needed for 50% inhibition of the superoxide anion radical is 1.15 times lower in the comparison with the known antioxidant i.e. L – ascorbic acid."
16,The catalytic activity of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O,"3.4 The catalytic activity of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O The new chromium(III) complex has been applied as the catalyst for the oligomerization reaction. The complex is active in one oligomerization cycle. The yield of the reaction is 21%. The dipicolinate complex of chromium(III) is selective catalyst. The catalytic activity of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl · 2H2O has been checked towards other monomers such as 3-buten-2-ol, 2,3-dibromo-2-propen-1-ol and hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) but no reaction symptoms were observed. The oligomerization products were subjected to the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, NMR and IR spectroscopy. The results of MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 5 ) show that the molecular peak corresponds with the oligomer consisting of 7 mers (665.1 m/z). Moreover, in the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum the peaks build of 9, 11, 13, 15 and 19 mers are present. The NMR spectroscopy confirms the composition of the oligomer. Fig. 6 A shows one doublet and five singlet peaks, however, in the B panel of Fig. 6 one multiplex peak and three singlet peaks are observed. The signals at 5.55–5.41 ppm present in the 1H NMR spectrum confirm an occurrence of hydrogen atoms linked with the carbon atom located in the immediate vicinity of the hydroxyl group. The peak at 2.29 ppm corresponds to hydrogen atoms associated with the carbon atom near the chloride atom. The peak at 1.68 ppm confirms the presence of the hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl group (Fig. 6A). The analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum show that the peak at 66.00 ppm confirms the presence of the carbon atom linked with the hydroxyl group. The presence of peaks in the range 74.30–73.82 ppm reveals the presence of the carbon atom connected by chemical bond with CH2 OH in the oligomer chain. The peak at 140.84 ppm may be assigned to the carbon atom linked with the CH3 group in toluene (Fig. 6B). The IR spectrum of the oligomerization products confirms the structure of the oligomer: the 3404.12 cm−1 tensile band with the medium intensity corresponding to OH in the oligomer chain involved in hydrogen bonds; the 2927.69–2868.64 cm−1 range of the CH stretch vibrations of the oligomer chain; 648.82–1638.48 cm−1 CC stretching tensions in the toluene ring; the 1451.09–1421.15 cm−1 range of bending vibrations of CH2 in the oligomer chain; the 1235.34–1166.65 cm−1 range of CO stretching vibrations; 716.92–480.89 cm−1 CCl bending vibrations in the oligomer chain. The catalytic activity of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O was calculated based on the following formula: (A.4) catalytic activity = m p n Cr · t where mp denotes the weight of the sample of oligomers [g], nCr means the values of Cr3+ moles [mmol] and t is the time of the process of oligomerization [h]. [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O has the catalytic activity 632.5 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1. This fact causes that a new chromium(III) complex can be classified as a highly active catalyst in accordance with the standards adopted in the literature [34]. The compound can be treated as a highly active catalyst if the value of the catalytic activity is in the range from 100 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1 to 1000 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1 [34]. Furthermore, if the catalytic activity of the studied compound is above 1000 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1 the catalyst can be treated, according to chemical literature, as very highly active [34]. Other chromium complexes (III) such as bis(imino)pyridine-chromium(III) chloride complexes exhibit catalytic activity in the oligomerization of ethylene [35]. The catalytic activity of such complexes is in the range 1.25 ⋅ 105–4.14 ⋅ 107 g (1 mol of Cr)−1 ⋅ bar−1 ⋅ h−1 at 70 °C [35]."
17,Conclusions,"A novel complex of chromium(III) - [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O has been synthesized and multi-analytically investigated to confirm the structure of new compound. The stability of new dipicolinate complex of Cr3+ has been studied by the potentiometric and conductometric titrations. The antioxidant properties of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O have been confirmed against the superoxide anion radical. The most important part of the study described in this report were, however, the studies on the catalytic properties of the new chromium(III) complex. It has been found that [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O is a highly active catalyst for the 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol oligomerization. The catalytic activity of [Cr(dipic)(H2O)3]Cl ⋅ 2 H2O equals 632.5 g ⋅ mmol−1 ⋅ h−1. Furthermore, the composition of the obtained oligomer chain has been confirmed by following techniques: NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS and IR. Moreover, analyzing the literature data and the results of our research, we have found that the more dipicolinate anions in the coordination sphere of chromium(III) the higher catalytic activity of a Cr(III) complex. It is worth noting that this oligomerization process after application of new non-metallocene Cr(III) complex as the catalyst undergoes very easily at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. Thus the results described in the following report can help in the planning of syntheses and the search for new complexes with potential catalytic properties."
