0,Introduction,"The demand for hydrogen has increased rapidly in recent years because of steady depletion of fossil fuel reserves and greenhouse effects caused by the combustion of these fuels. Hydrogen is important raw material for chemical industries and it is an alternative clean energy source to replace fossil fuels. Production of hydrogen from gasification has achieved increasing importance in recent years. However, the production of hydrogen and the other desirable gases from separate steps of gasification and gas separation are limited by the inherent thermodynamic equilibrium established at the given conditions. For several reversible reactions in gasification, preferential removal of one or more of the products during reaction will cause a shift in equilibrium, thereby overcoming possible thermodynamic limitation and pushing the reaction in the desired direction. High temperature membrane can bring about such selective removal of species during reaction, and therefore, reactor incorporating such membrane can be used to increase the reaction yields of desirable products. It is claimed that reactors incorporating such membranes to perform in situ separation would offer several advantages over conventional fixed bed reactors without built-in membranes in the areas of higher energy efficiency, lower capital and operating costs, compact modular construction, low maintenance cost and ease of scale up."
1,Literature review,"Combining the chemical reaction and separation steps in a single processing vessel has been investigated in several studies. Examples include the dehydrogenation of ethane [1], cyclohexane [2] and ethylbenzene [3]; the hydrogenation of acetylene [4]. Uemiya et al. [5] studied the water-gas shift reaction using a palladium membrane reactor in which the product hydrogen permeated the membrane to provide CO conversions in excess of those associated with the “normal” equilibrium conversion. H2S decomposition studies were conducted in a porous-glass membrane reactor by Kamayema et al. [6,7] who succeeded in selective separation of H2 from the reacting mixture and reported conversions twice as high as possible from thermodynamic equilibrium. The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane in reactors using platinum impregnated vycor [8], palladium (tube) [9] and porous glass [10] membranes resulted in conversions 2.5–5 times higher than equilibrium conversion. The dehydrogenation of methanol and n-butane was studied by Zaspalis et al. [11] in alumina membrane reactors and about 50% increase in conversions were obtained in the membrane mode of operation as compared to the fixed-bed mode of operation without the membrane. Membrane-based separation processes are today finding widespread and ever increasing use in the petrochemical, food and pharmaceutical industries, in biotechnology, and in a variety of environmental applications, including the treatment of contaminated air and water streams [12]. The most direct advantage of a membrane separation process, over more conventional separation counterparts such as adsorption, absorption, distillation, etc., results in energy saving, and in the reduction of the required initial capital investment. Membrane technology plays a very important role in hydrogen separation. Since the introduction of polysulfone fiber membranes, used in applications like the recovery of H2 from ammonia purge gas and extraction of H2 from petroleum cracking streams [13], there exists a considerable interest in the development of high-performance membranes for hydrogen-separation. Such membranes have the potential for profound improvements in efficiency for separation and purification of hydrogen in applications ranging from gasification to fuels refining. For example, substantial advantages can be gained in operating the water-gas shift reaction at very high temperatures provided that the low equilibrium conversion of carbon monoxide can be enhanced by removing a hydrogen permeate stream through use of a membrane reactor [9,14,15]. However, one particularly significant technical challenge is the development of hydrogen-separation membranes that can withstand severe operating conditions of temperatures up to 1300°F, and hydrogen containing gas pressures up to 300psi. These conditions are typical of catalytic steam gasification process. For economic production of high purity hydrogen from gasification, an appropriate inorganic membrane should be capable for in situ use in separation of hydrogen at elevated temperature without reducing the feed stream temperature. The key factor is the availability of a membrane with adequate hydrogen selectivity and good thermal and mechanical stability. Pd-based composite membranes are expected to possess high thermal and mechanical stability and have sufficient hydrogen permeability and 100% hydrogen selectivity due to the unique property of hydrogen solubility in palladium and the solution–diffusion mechanism for hydrogen permeation through palladium [16]. Consequently, palladium-based membranes have received considerable attention for high temperature reaction and separation applications. The hydrogen permeability of palladium membranes is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness while the hydrogen selectivity is highly dependent on obtaining a dense structure in a thin palladium film. Therefore, a viable palladium membrane for high temperature reaction and separation should be a thin, defect-free, composite membrane. Palladium is an attractive membrane material due to its ability to readily dissociate molecular hydrogen at its surface. Although some other metals, such as zirconium, niobium, tantalum and vanadium, exhibit significantly higher bulk hydrogen permeability, these metals form oxide layers by surface reaction limiting the hydrogen flux. Hydrogen embrittlement of these metals is also a reason for their less use for hydrogen separation. As a result, the direct replacement of palladium by cheaper refractory metals is sought for [17]. Since palladium is a precious metal, its efficient economic use for industrial applications makes it necessary to reduce the material costs by decreasing the thickness of palladium films. Meanwhile, the reduced thickness would result in higher hydrogen flux without compromising selectivity for hydrogen over other gases. The most significant improvement would be the development of new multilayer membranes consisting of at least two layers. An ultra thin palladium layer combined with a porous ceramic, where the microporous base provides the necessary mechanical support to the thin metallic layer. Dense inorganic membranes consist of solid layers of metals, such as Pd, Pt, Pd/Ag alloys or solid oxides (such as ionic conductors). In order to increase the permeability by reducing the critical membrane thickness, the membranes are applied in the form of multi-layers. The thin dense inorganic membranes usually consist of dense top layers supported on porous ceramic base material. The multi-layer membranes generally have different morphologies with a gradual variation in the pore size of each layer so that good continuity and adhesion between layered can be achieved. The pore size of these membranes depends on the particle size and the methods by which they are prepared. Ceramic membranes are asymmetric layers structures composed of a separation layer, which fulfills the actual membrane function, and a ceramic support structure comprising of one to five layers [1,18]. The support structure which serves as a substrate is needed for general mechanical stability and must have larger pores than the separation layer to reduce the resistance to the desired species flux."
2,Preparation of palladium-based membranes,"Membranes or metallic thin films may be prepared by a variety of methods, the choice of which depends on such factors as the nature of metal itself, the manufacturing facilities available on site, required thickness, surface area, geometrical form, purity, cleanliness, etc. Shu et al. [19] have provided a good review of the candidate methods such as alloy casting and rolling, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electroplating and electro less plating. From their review, they concluded that the preparation of the membrane to be applied in a particular application must be considered as an original problem of material design, and may therefore benefit from the wealth of original ideas and techniques developed currently in this field. Laser induced surface improvement (LISI) is a process where a thin layer at the surface and/or subsurface region of a metal is melted by a laser beam with the simultaneous addition of precursor consisting of water soluble binder/vehicle and powder material of desired elements(s). The electro-magnetic radiation of laser beam is absorbed within first few atomic layers for opaque materials, such as metals and ceramics. Typical surface alteration process using lasers traditionally include (i) transformation hardening, (ii) surface melting, (iii) surface cladding, (iv) surface alloying and (v) other techniques (surface smoothening, texturing, coating removal and micromachining) [20]. In surface modification techniques, the interaction time between the laser and the substrate is of fundamental importance in determining which of the above mentioned processes will occur. The major independent process variables for the laser modification are laser traverse speed, power, beam shape and size, thermo-physical properties (decomposition temperature, thermal conductivity, etc.), thickness and type of pre-coated precursor. By controlling these parameters, depth, width, solute content and microstructure of the laser-modified zone can be altered. However, the most important factors among these are power, traverse speed and the diameter of the laser beam. At the Center for Laser Applications (CLA) at UTSI, extensive work has been done in the area of laser surface modification. Surface modification has been performed by alloying, depositing thin layers of borides [21] and carbides [22] on metal like aluminum, aluminum alloys, iron, iron alloys, etc. Ceramic coatings [23] have been applied to aluminum alloy substrate, which showed enhanced surface properties such as hardness and wear resistance. Surface processing of alumina grinding wheel materials was carried out [24,25] using laser beam of power ranging from 500 to 1000W. In light of above background, it was decided to synthesize composite membranes by depositing a layer of palladium over alumina substrate employing a laser-based process to prepare composite membranes. Such composite membrane can be used for separating hydrogen from gasifier product gas."
3,Experimental procedures,
4,Materials,"4.1 Materials The porous α-alumina substrate (38% porosity, 0.5μm average pore diameter) was procured from Coorstek. One side of each disk was successively polished with sand papers #320, #500 and #800, and then examined visually as well as by optical microscope for possible defects before coating. The substrates were flushed with nitrogen to remove any dust particle. To prepare the γ-alumina surface on α-alumina substrate through sol–gel technique, 1M boehmite sol was prepared using 100ml of deionized water heated to 80–90°C, followed by addition of 26ml of aluminum secondary butoxide (Alfa) and vigorous mixing. The solution was then allowed to stand at 70–90°C for 1h to homogenize. Next, 7ml of 1M nitric acid was added to the solution and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 10h at 90–100°C. For preparing solution for dip coating of α-alumina support, 20ml of 1M boehmite sol was mixed with 13ml of 3wt.% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. PVA acts as a binder to prevent crack formation during the drying process as well as helps to adjust the sol viscosity. The α-alumina substrate was dipped in mixture of boehmite and PVA solution, for 8–10s twice in an interval of 2min and third time for 3s. The resulting sample was dried in an oven at 40°C for 2 days in 50% humid air, and then calcined under controlled temperature condition [26]. This resulted in formation of γ-alumina on α-alumina substrate that was further used for deposition of Pd coating using laser-based technique."
5,Laser synthesis,"4.2 Laser synthesis A 3000-W Hobart HLP 300 continuous wave Nd-YAG (1.06μm) laser equipped with fiber optic beam delivery system was employed for laser heating of samples. The fiber optic beam delivery provided efficient (with only 4–5% loss) laser energy input to a work piece. The lenses within the output-coupling module of fiber optic were configured to provide a beam of 3.5mm wide in spatial distribution onto the sample surface. Such a line beam provides the energy distribution within the beam suitable to maintain minimum or no overlap between the successive laser passes as required to achieve larger surface coverage in the processed region. The laser beam was focused at 0.5mm above the surface of the substrate. PdCl2 solution was uniformly sprayed on γ-alumina coated α-alumina substrate and allowed to dry completely to leave the metal salt (PdCl2) residue behind as a coating precursor. These substrates were subjected to laser surface treatment in air (at atmospheric pressure) at a power level of 200W with a laser beam traverse speed of 4000mm/min. Due to the intense laser fluence, PdCl2 residue is expected to dissociate into metallic Pd and chlorine gas that will escape into the atmosphere leaving behind the Pd coating. The laser beam was traced in straight, overlapping stripes so that entire surface of the sample was covered. An overlapping index of 1mm and a working distance of 123mm were maintained in the processing of all the samples."
6,Hydrogen permeation,"4.3 Hydrogen permeation Hydrogen permeation measurements were carried out in a bench scale high-pressure and high-temperature reactor system. A schematic of the hydrogen permeation measurement system is shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was placed inside a split tube furnace (Mellen™ SV-12) and its temperature was maintained at desired level. Pure gases used were hydrogen and nitrogen with purity over 99.5%. Mixed gases contained 10vol.% CO, 35vol.% CH4 and rest was CO2. The gas flow rates in the retentate and permeate side were measured using volume flowmeter and soap bubble flowmeter. The pressure fluctuation in the feed stream and in the reactor was monitored using in-line pressure gauges. For compositional analysis of permeate stream, a gas chromatograph (GC) with molecular sieve column and silica gel column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used. The analysis was carried out by first identifying the peaks of pure gases, followed by the analyses of the permeate samples. For accurate and reproducible results, readings were only recorded when flow on both the retentate and permeate side had stabilized."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Membrane characterization,"5.1 Membrane characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of Pd membrane on γ-coated α-alumina substrate was carried out in which 2θ angle was changed from 20 to 100° using Philips Norelco diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.56Å) at 20kV, 2mA setting and 0.02°min−1 scan speed. The XRD spectra of Pd membrane on γ-alumina coated α-alumina substrate, γ-alumina coated α-alumina substrate and as-received α-alumina substrate are presented in Fig. 2 . The XRD spectrum of the top layer of Pd on γ-alumina coated α-alumina substrate (Fig. 2a) revealed existence of face-centered cubic Pd. Peaks of α-alumina and SiO2 were also identified in this spectrum because the X-rays penetrate the samples to the depth greater than the thickness of the Pd metal film. In Fig. 2a and b peaks corresponding to γ-alumina are not present possibly due to transition of γ-alumina to α-alumina during calcinations treatment. In Fig. 2c apart from the major peaks of α-alumina, SiO2 peaks were also present possibly due to impurity present in the α-alumina substrate. The surface morphologies of the as-received α-alumina substrate and the modified surface after being coated with γ-alumina and palladium are shown in Fig. 3 . Although it is not distinctly clear from the micrograph (Fig. 3a) it was observed that in general, as-received α-alumina substrate was more porous compared to γ-alumina coated α-alumina substrate (Fig. 3b). The porosity in α-alumina substrate was covered with γ-alumina layer, which is indicated by the presence of small island-like structures (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the laser surface treatment for deposition of Pd membrane material on γ-alumina coated α-alumina produced macro-scale ripple marks and uniform and smooth surface morphology in localized region within these ripples at micro-scale (Fig. 3c) It can be seen that the grain structure of the α-alumina surface appears rougher (has more voids) than the surface morphology after coating with γ-alumina (see Fig. 3a and b). The surface of γ-alumina layer was also found to be more reflective than that of α-alumina implying a smoother surface. Fig. 3c shows surface of the Pd membrane supported on above-mentioned composite ceramic support. It shows that the surface morphology of the Pd coating was uniform and smooth. From further analysis, it was also found that the coated Pd film adhered very well to the alumina support."
9,Hydrogen permeation and separation,"5.2 Hydrogen permeation and separation The hydrogen permeation mechanism through a palladium membrane has been studied extensively [16,17,27]. Hydrogen permeates through metals by a multistep process, which involves the following steps: (1) reversible dissociative chemisorption of molecular hydrogen on the membrane surface, (2) reversible dissolution of surface atomic hydrogen in the bulk layers of the metal, and (3) diffusion of atomic hydrogen through the bulk metal. Steps 1 and 2 of reversible chemisorption and reversible dissolution take place on both entering (feed side) and exiting (permeate side) surfaces of the Pd membrane. Generally, the hydrogen permeability is expressed by the following equation [27]: J H 2 = k ( P H 2 , ret n − P H 2 , perm n ) X m where J H 2 is hydrogen permeation flux (mol/m2 s); k the permeability constant (mol/mPan); X m the thickness of membrane; P H 2 , ret and P H 2 , perm are the hydrogen partial pressures on retentate and permeate side, respectively and n represents the exponent for pressure dependence. Permeability constant is defined as: k = 1 2 D M K S where D M is the diffusion coefficient and K S is the Sievert's/solubility constant. The permeability constant ‘k’ is dependent on the temperature and can be expressed in the form of Arrhenius equation as: k = k 0 ⋅ exp − E a R T where k 0 is pre-exponential factor, E a the apparent activation energy for hydrogen permeation, R the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. In the hydrogen permeation experiments, when the membrane is not gas tight some of the gas constituents from the feed side would leak through the pores/pin holes. Because of this leakage of gases due to bulk transport, the real flux of hydrogen due to diffusion through the palladium film had to be calculated using a subtraction method. For such a correction the following approach was used. If the total hydrogen flux and the hydrogen transport through only the pinholes are known or can be estimated, then the net hydrogen diffusion through the dense metal part can be calculated as: J H 2 ( metal ) = J H 2 ( total ) − J H 2 ( pinhole ) Now palladium is permeable only to hydrogen. So on the permeate side, if apart from hydrogen, other gases are also present, then these gases present on the permeate side of the membrane must have crossed through the pinholes in the membrane. The ratio of mole fraction of hydrogen to methane, on the feed side (e.g. y H 2 , feed / y C H 4 , feed ) was used to calculate the corrected mole fraction of hydrogen ( y H 2 , metal). The corrected mole fraction of hydrogen on the permeate side of the membrane was then given by: y H 2 , metal = y H 2 , total − y C H 4 , total × y H 2 , feed y C H 4 , feed Since GC provides the analytical results in terms of volume or mole fractions, it was advantageous to use this correction in terms of mole fractions rather than in terms of mass fractions and mass flow rates. The partial pressure exponent ‘n’ was then calculated by fitting a power curve through the estimated hydrogen flux values and the difference in the hydrogen partial pressures. In our experiments, since all hydrogen was continuously swept away from the permeate side of the membrane by nitrogen used as the sweep gas, the hydrogen partial pressure term on the permeate side was essentially zero, and therefore, the driving force was considered to be equal to the hydrogen partial pressure on the feed side. The estimated values of hydrogen flux through the palladium film as a function of temperature and feed side hydrogen partial pressure are given in Fig. 4 . Using regression analysis, the pressure exponent ‘n’ was estimated to be 0.5978, 0.6024 and 0.6188 at 900, 1100 and 1300°F, respectively. The average value of the coefficient of regression (R 2) for the fitted curves was 0.9460. The value of the pressure exponent was found to be in the range of the values reported in literature. Li et al. [28] reported a value of 0.65 for 10μm Pd/Al2O3 membranes prepared by electroless plating with osmosis. Collins and Way [29] reported a value of 0.57 for 17μm thick membrane. Next, the average value of 0.61 was used as pressure exponent to correlate the hydrogen flux data with P H 2 0.61 at different temperatures. Straight lines were fitted to the data and the slope of the line gave the hydrogen permeance (=X m/k) at different temperatures. These linear plots are shown in Fig. 5 . From Fig. 5, the values of permeability constants ‘k’ were estimated to be 1.876×10−09, 2.037×10−09 and 2.275×10−09 mol/msPa0.61 at 900, 1100 and 1300°F respectively. These values of permeability constant ‘k’ were found to be in agreement with the Collins’ and Way's [29] value of 6.82×10−09 mol/msPa0.57 at 823K. Similarly, Morreale et al. [30] reported a value of 3.21×10−08 mol/msPa0.62 in the 623–1173K temperature range for 1mm thick palladium membranes. As described earlier, the membrane permeability constant ‘k’ is proportional to the product of the Sieverts’ solubility constant (K S) and diffusivity (D M) of the hydrogen/palladium system. So, any variation in either of these values due to differences in the operating conditions or non-ideality of Pd–H system would result in the change in the value of pressure exponent, n. Detailed discussion of this issue has been provided by Morreale et al. [30]. The increase in ‘n’ could also result when the permeation rate is influenced by the leakage of the hydrogen through defects/pinholes in the Pd layer, transport resistance of the alumina support, and possible poisoning of the palladium surface. The rate of the hydrogen permeation through the Pd/Al2O3 composite membrane could thus be dependent not only on the bulk phase hydrogen diffusion but also on more complex transport mechanism involving the surface processes of hydrogen chemisorption, dissolution and diffusion. Next, the calculated values of hydrogen permeance (=X m/k) were correlated with temperature in an Arrhenius equation form. This is shown in Fig. 6 . From the slope of the fitted line, the activation energy was estimated to be about 5.39kJ/mol. This value is slightly lower than the range of 11.92–20.50kJ/mol reported by Morreale et al. [30] for thicker palladium membranes. However, this value is in the range of 2.2–23kJ/mol reported for the Pd–Ag membranes [31]. There is a relatively large spread in the activation energy values reported for various membranes. This large variation can probably be explained by the fact that the rate limiting process could vary in different temperature regimes, and with the varying surface composition for different type of membranes. The apparent activation energy includes the energy barriers for dissolution, diffusion of hydrogen in the Pd layer and for hydrogen permeation in the porous alumina support. Therefore, the activation energies for these membranes with different thicknesses of palladium layers and different supports might be different. This is evident in Table 1 where hydrogen permeation fluxes through ceramic supported Pd membranes prepared by different methods are reported. Based on this comparison, the values obtained in our work can be considered consistent with the literature results."
10,Major conclusions,"Palladium ceramic membrane was prepared using UTSI-developed laser-based metal deposition technique and setup. The method was found to be faster, less laborious and less time consuming. A study of hydrogen separation from a simulated syngas environment was also carried out using this ceramic–palladium composite membrane. The hydrogen permeation measurements were carried out in a bench-scale high-pressure, high-temperature reactor system. Experiments carried out at temperature of 1300°F and hydrogen partial pressure difference of 55psi showed that such a composite palladium–ceramic membrane is capable of operating at typical exit conditions of a catalytic steam gasifier and other applications requiring similar high temperature and high-pressure conditions."
