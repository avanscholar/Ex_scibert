0,Introduction,"The use of hydrogen as an environmentally friendly energy carrier has been massively encouraged over the last years. It relies mostly on the emission of little or no pollutants when hydrogen is used in fuel cells for power generation. In addition, such a carbon-free carrier may be produced from biomass, especially from the wide variety of oxygenated hydrocarbons available, allowing a thorough exploitation of the environmental benefits of its use. Alcohols, such as methanol [1,2] and ethanol [3,4] and polyols, particularly ethylene glycol [5,6], glycerol [7–9] and sorbitol [7], are amongst the most studied organic molecules so far. Glycerol, in particular, has drawn much attention due to its ever growing availability as a consequence of the increase in biodiesel production worldwide. Moreover, it is non-volatile and thus suitable for the production of hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming (APR), avoiding any extra energy demand for its vaporization [10]. Some detailed studies have dealt with distinct issues related to hydrogen production through APR of oxygenated hydrocarbons, including reaction kinetics [11] and catalyst design [5–9]. Catalytic systems based on group VIII metals, particularly Pt, Pd and Ni, have been shown to be effective [6] due to their ability to break C–C bonds and also to promote the water–gas shift reaction (CO+H2O↔CO2 +H2), which increases the hydrogen production [10]. Concerning the support related effects, various supported platinum catalysts were evaluated in the production of hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol [5]. The catalysts behaved differently according to the support used and alumina, zirconia and titania provided the more active as well as the more selective systems. Nevertheless, the role played by the support and the features that might be decisive in determining catalytic performance are not clear yet and further studies are needed concerning the molecular structure of different oxygenated hydrocarbons. Hence this contribution reports on the support effects on the activity and hydrogen production from glycerol aqueous-phase reforming on Pt-based catalysts."
1,Material and methods,"The heterogeneous catalysts were supported on aluminum, cerium, zirconium and magnesium oxides. Apart from the commercial available alumina, the supports were prepared by precipitation. The aqueous solution of the corresponding precursor salts ((NH4)2Ce(NO3)6, Zr(C2H3O2)1.4(OH)2.6, Mg(C2H3O2)) was slowly added to a 0.5molL−1 NH4OH solution under vigorous stirring. The precipitate was kept at pH=9 under reflux for 96h. Next, the gel was centrifuged and thoroughly washed with distilled water until constant pH. It was then dried overnight at 100°C and finally calcined at 500°C for 12h following a heating rate of 1°Cmin−1. All catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 so as to obtain a platinum content of 1.5wt.%. The samples were calcined under a 30mLmin−1 air flow for 4h at 500°C (10°Cmin−1). After calcination, the catalysts were reduced with a 30mLmin−1 hydrogen flow at 350°C for 1h. The catalysts actual chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence analyses, which were carried out in a Shimadzu EDX-700 spectrometer. The textural properties of all samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption. The adsorption isotherms were determined at −196°C in an ASAP 2020 Micromeritics apparatus. Prior to analyses, the samples were degassed at 150°C. The specific surface areas were determined by BET method while the pore size distribution and the average pore size were obtained using the BJH formalism. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed in a Rigaku Miniflex diffractrometer with CuKα radiation, operating at 30kV and 40mV. The measurements were carried out with 2θ ranging from 10 to 80°, with a scanning rate of 0.01°/s. Basic surface sites were probed by temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (TPD-CO2). Firstly, the samples were treated at 500°C under air stream for 1h to ensure the surface cleanness and then cooled down to room temperature. Afterwards, they were contacted with a flow of pure CO2 for 30min and finally purged with nitrogen. The desorption analyses were performed in a TA Instruments SDT Q600 thermobalance using nitrogen flow (50mLmin−1). The temperature was increased linearly at a rate of 20°Cmin−1 up to 500°C. Eventual weak surface acid sites were determined by adsorption of n-butylamine [12]. The samples were treated at 500°C under a 30mLmin−1 nitrogen flow for 1h and then cooled down to 150°C, temperature at which the alkylamine was admitted to the catalysts. Adsorption was allowed to occur for 30min in order to complete saturate the surface sites. The reactor was then purged at the same temperature with nitrogen to remove the physisorbed alkylamine. Quantification was carried out by monitoring the mass loss during desorption in a TA Instruments SDT Q600 thermobalance. The analyses were conducted following a heating rate of 20°Cmin−1 up to 600°C under nitrogen (50mLmin−1). The reaction rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation was used to determine the apparent metallic dispersion of the catalysts following the procedure described in the literature [13,14]. The catalysts were reduced at 350°C for 1h under pure hydrogen, following a linear heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. After that, the catalyst bed was cooled to 250°C and a mixture of cyclohexane in hydrogen (molar ratio H2/C6H12 =13.2) was introduced in the reactor, which was operated under differential conditions in order to calculate the dehydrogenation rates. The reaction was monitored by on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with an FID. The metal dispersion was estimated by a correlation between the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation and platinum dispersion measured by transmission electron microscopy established for a reference Pt/TiO2 catalyst. This methodology has been successfully used before [14]. The glycerol aqueous-phase reforming was carried out in a PARR batch reactor at 225°C and autogenous pressure with stirring speed of 600rpm. The catalyst (100mg) was mixed with 100mL of a 1% (wt/wt) glycerol aqueous solution. The gas composition was determined by a HP 6890A gas chromatograph with a TCD, while the concentration of unreacted glycerol in the liquid phase was analyzed by a Shimadzu HPLC with an Aminex HPX 87H column, using 0.01molL−1 H2SO4 as eluent at 1.0mLmin−1 and refractive index detector. Other organic liquid compounds were identified by an Agilent GC–MS with headspace accessory. Both gas and liquid phases were analyzed after 3-h reaction time."
2,Results and discussion,"The textural properties of all synthesized and commercial supports are collected in Table 1 . All oxides revealed to be mesoporous materials with rather high surface area, which may be attributed to synthesis methodology. The values obtained for the magnesia support are particularly remarkable when compared to the values reported for other ordinary methods [15,16]. The structure of these samples was analyzed by XRD and the patterns are depicted in Fig. 1 . The commercial alumina was identified as a γ transition phase. As for the synthesized materials, they revealed to be poorly crystallized and zirconia, particularly, showed to be amorphous. Ceria exhibited peaks at 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5° and 56.5° Bragg angles corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of its fluorite phase whereas the magnesia pattern showed peaks at 37.0°, 43.0°, 62.4°, 74.8° and 78.7° related to a periclase phase. The surface chemistry of all supports was assessed by using both CO2 and n-butylamine as probe molecules. TPD of adsorbed CO2 was performed and the profiles are displayed in Fig. 2 . Apart from MgO sample, the patterns are qualitatively similar to each other with a single low-temperature peak between 100 and 200°C. The release of CO2 at such temperature range is usually related to the occurrence of weak basic surface sites [17–20]. For the MgO support, the CO2 desorption is recorded up to around 400°C, clearly evidencing a distinct distribution of surface centers with the presence of much stronger basic sites. The total amount of the basic sites and their density were calculated from the TPD profiles and the data are collected in Table 2 . As expected, magnesia exhibited the highest concentration of such sites due to the more pronounced electron donating character of its metallic element. On the other hand, only slight differences were estimated for the other supports. Even though the existence of basic centers on the surface of the studied oxides is clear and they are indeed expected due to their chemical nature, it should be recalled that the acid–base properties of oxidic systems also depend on the occurrence of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) at the surface, which may be positively and negatively charged [21,22]. The positively charged CUS (cations) behave as weak Lewis surface acid centers. The formation of such sites is a consequence of the index of exposed faces and of the degree of structural order in the solids, which leads to the generation of edges, corners and structural defects [21]. The population of these positively charged CUS on the surface of the supports was investigated by thermogravimetry after n-butylamine adsorption. It is considered that this base molecule titrates all acidic sites on the material surface and the total number of these centers may then be calculated from the amount of molecules needed to saturate the surface [12]. It is assumed that 1mol of chemisorbed n-butylamine corresponds to 1mol of acidic sites [23,24]. Based on preliminary thermal analyses performed with the treated samples before amine adsorption, it is reasonable to assume that the mass loss is solely associated with the alkylamine desorption. The calculated data are summarized in Table 3 . The density of such sites was estimated by normalizing the total amount by BET surface area of each sample. The results evidence the expected low density of weak acid sites created by the CUS of most of the supports. It is important to note that despite the slight difference in density found among these supports they follow the same trend established by the electropositive character of the metal atom in the oxide lattice: the more electropositive the metal atom the lower the density of acidic surface sites. The catalysts chemical compositions are indicated in Table 4 and it is seen that there is a difference in the actual metal content for all samples but they are within an acceptable range considering the nominal composition. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation was used to estimate platinum dispersion. This reaction is acknowledged as structure-insensitive and thus has been successfully used to determine the apparent dispersion of metal supported catalysts [13,14,25]. It is generally considered that the higher the metal dispersion, and consequently the higher the metallic surface area, the higher the dehydrogenation rate. The reaction rates of cyclohexane dehydrogenation at 250°C and their corresponding metal dispersion are also summarized in Table 4. It can be seen that the Pt/Al2O3 presents the higher dispersion whereas the values obtained for the other samples lay within 25–30%. An aqueous solution with 1wt.% glycerol was used to evaluate the performance of the catalysts as the hydrogen yields have been shown to be insensitive to the concentration of the feed solution [7]. All reactions were performed at autogenous pressure, which were registered to be constant at 23 bar during the whole experiment irrespective of the catalyst used and the final glycerol concentration in the liquid phase. Taking into account the difference in Pt loading, the catalytic activity was evaluated based on the reaction rate as expressed by mols of glycerol per hour per gram of metal (Table 4). In order to avoid any misleading conclusion due to the difference in metal dispersion, Table 4 also collects the reaction rates calculated per square meter of metallic Pt. It can be noted that the catalysts presented distinct performances. Pt/ZrO2 revealed to be the most active system, with a much higher reaction rate and a conversion level twice as high as that accomplished by Pt/CeO2 catalyst, in good accordance with the literature [5]. The performance of Pt/MgO sample also stands out, presenting a good potential activity. It is also important to note that such trend is roughly the same if the activity is examined by the glycerol conversion or if the metallic area is considered (Table 4). The reaction data presented in Table 5 shows that glycerol aqueous-phase reforming over all studied catalysts indeed leads to a hydrogen-rich gas phase with a quite low CO concentration. Methane was the main hydrocarbon detected and the traces of other higher hydrocarbons produced were grouped as C1+, which consists mostly of ethane and ethene. Significant differences can be seen in the molar distribution of the products in the gas phase. Even though the production of hydrogen is quite high over all catalysts, the performance of both Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/MgO stands out due to their high activity (Table 4) and the timid production of undesired hydrocarbons. This behavior is consistent with the literature as it has been shown that the use of basic oxides as additives inhibits the formation of methane [26]. Moreover, it has been reported that the use of these oxides can also favor the water–gas shift reaction [16], decreasing thus the concentration of CO and promoting a secondary production of hydrogen. As a matter of fact, it has been reported [10,27] that for dilute concentrations as those used in this work, the gas bubbles formed within the liquid phase contain water vapor at a pressure equal to its saturation pressure at the reactor temperature, favoring the water–gas shift reaction and leading, consequently, to low CO concentration. The composition of the liquid phase after reaction was also determined and the results are presented in Table 6 . It was found that some organic by-products are formed but at quite low concentrations. It should also be mentioned that apart from propanone and ethanol, traces (<10ppm) of some other compounds were also identified, particularly propanal and butanol. Among the primary conditions to generate hydrogen from glycerol, one can readily claim the need of breaking all C–C, C–H and O–H bonds of the molecule. These bond breakings indeed happen on the surface of group VIII metals and thus the attempts to rationalize the mechanism of aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons presented so far in the literature rely almost exclusively on the metallic centers [6,10]. Nevertheless, a possible role played by the support should not be ruled out completely as already previously suggested by Shabaker et al. in their studies performed on ethylene glycol [5]. In a quite good agreement, the reaction data collected in Tables 4 and 5 evidence that the nature of the support influences the glycerol reforming as well. The higher amount of hydrogen was accomplished over the catalyst supported on MgO, the oxide with the higher electron donating character. Moreover, a minor contribution of the coordinatively unsaturated sites on support surface in determining the products formed upon glycerol reforming might also be considered as the results presented in Tables 3–5 suggest that they favor the production of hydrocarbons. It seems clear that a closer examination of the role played by the acid/basic surface sites of the support, particularly their nature and strength, in aqueous-phase reforming must be carried out in order to better understand the reaction mechanism of hydrogen production from oxygenated hydrocarbons."
3,Conclusion,"Glycerol aqueous-phase reforming on Pt-based supported catalysts leads to a hydrogen-rich gas phase. Amongst all supports used, the catalyst prepared on MgO and ZrO2 presented good potential activity with high production of hydrogen and low concentration of undesired hydrocarbons. It was showed that the nature of the support influences the catalytic performance on glycerol reforming."
