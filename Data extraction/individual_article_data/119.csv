0,Introduction,"Interest in the development of green processes that use sustainable and environmentally friendly feedstocks to produce renewable sources of energy and chemicals has increased because of concerns about global warming and the lack of crude oil reserves. The construction of biorefineries which are capable of utilizing lignocellulose seems an attractive way to build a sustainable society because lignocellulose is one of the most abundant renewable organic resources in the world, and its use would not be competitive with food consumption (Huber et al., 2006; Werpy et al., 2004). Lignocellulose has a complex macromolecular structure mainly composed of cellulose (25–50%), hemicellulose (15–40%) and lignin (10–30%) (Ruiz et al., 2013). When lignocellulose is treated using a hydrothermal process with dilute acids such as mineral acids, xylan which is the main component of hemicellulose is easily hydrolyzed to xylose, followed by dehydration to furfural, leaving most of the cellulose and lignin in the solid phase (Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007; Takata et al., 2013; Guerra-Rodríguez et al., 2012; Boussarsar et al., 2009; Gámez et al., 2006). Xylose and furfural are important biorefinery building blocks because they have potential applications in the chemical, food and pharmaceutical industries (Werpy et al., 2004; Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007). The dilute acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose to produce xylose or furfural has been studied for many years and has been recently reviewed (Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007). For commercial use, xylose and furfural are generally produced from agricultural wastes such as sugar cane bagasse and wheat straw via sulfuric acid hydrolysis and subsequently purification using neutralization, filtration, evaporation, and chromatography (Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007). Sulfuric acid is often used as a catalyst for this process because it is inexpensive however it is very corrosive to metallic reactors and must be separated from the product at the end of the process resulting in the generation of a large amount of waste gained from the neutralization of the acid. Therefore, milder acids such as phosphoric acid have been investigated as an alternative since phosphoric acid is environmentally friendly and the phosphate salts are beneficial (Orozco et al., 2011; Gámez et al., 2006; Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007). Xylitol, a hydrogenated compound of xylose, is one of the top twelve platform molecules according to the US Department of Energy (Werpy et al., 2004). The production of xylitol has increased since it was recognized for its interesting properties including its anti-carcinogenic activities, its potential as a sugar substitute, its lower caloric content, and that as a chemical precursor (Werpy et al., 2004; Mishra et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013). The production of xylitol is conventionally carried out by hydrogenating commercial or purified xylose in the presence of a metal catalyst such as nickel, ruthenium, or palladium (Mishra et al., 2013; Mikkola et al., 2001). There are few reports on the catalytic production of xylitol using hemicellulose hydrolysate from lignocellulose as a raw material (Baudel et al., 2005; Parajó et al., 1998). Furfural can be converted into a variety of useful products like furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and cyclopentanone by catalytic hydrogenation (Hoydonckx et al., 2007; Biradar et al., 2014; Sitthisa and Resasco, 2011; Hronec and Fulajtarová, 2012; Pace et al., 2012). Furfuryl alcohol has been commercially produced from furfural (Hoydonckx et al., 2007). Recently THFA have garnered attention because it is an environmentally friendly solvent due to its biodegradable nature and is a starting material for the production of some chemicals such as 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran and 1,5-pentanediol (Biradar et al., 2014; Ordomsky et al., 2013; Hoydonckx et al., 2007; Nakagawa and Tomishige, 2012). THFA can be conventionally produced by the two-step catalytic hydrogenation of furfural via the intermediate production of furfuryl alcohol over Cu–Cr and metal catalysts separately (Hoydonckx et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2013). Although direct conversion of furfural into THFA has been recently investigated, there are few reports on technologies which provide appreciable selectivity for THFA because of the difficulty in controlling the selectivity of the furfural conversion (Biradar et al., 2014). No reports on the catalytic production of THFA using hemicellulose hydrolysate as a material have been published. The objectives of this study were to develop a process for the two-step production of xylitol and THFA via the production of the corresponding intermediate, xylose or furfural, from lignocellulose by a hydrothermal process with dilute acid followed by a catalytic aqueous phase hydrogenation. Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) was used as a raw material because it is the promising feedstock that has attractive characteristics, including that it is a perennial grass with wintering ability, and it has a high level of dry matter productivity (Lewandowski et al., 2003; Somerville et al., 2010). The selective production of xylose or furfural from napier grass without dissolving cellulose and lignin by an acid hydrothermal process was optimized. The acids used in the current study were the phosphorus oxoacids, phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and phosphorous acid (H3PO3). Xylitol and THFA were produced at high yields from the corresponding compounds in the acid hydrolysate by hydrogenation with palladium supported on carbon (Pd/C)."
1,Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Napier grass was provided by Professor Ishii of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Miyazaki. Extractive-free napier grass meals used in all of the experiments were prepared as described previously (Takata et al., 2013). Briefly the air-dried napier grass was milled, fractionated into sizes of 150–300μm, and then extracted with a mixture of ethanol–benzene (1:2 – v/v) at 90°C for 6h. Phosphorous acid (97.5%) was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Furfural (99%) and THFA (99%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co. (Saint Louis, USA). Palladium supported on activated carbon catalyst (5.0wt% Pd/C, wetted with ca. 55% water) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All of the other chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd."
3,Hydrothermal process with diluted acids,"2.2 Hydrothermal process with diluted acids The treatments using the hydrothermal process were conducted in a batch type reactor which was made of a corrosion-resistant alloy with an inner volume of 20mL produced by Toyokoatsu Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan). The extractive-free napier grass (1.0g) and the reaction solvent (10mL) were first mixed in the reactor. The solvents used were dilute phosphoric acid (0.5–3.0wt%) and phosphorous acid (3.0wt%). The reactor was immersed in a salt bath that had been preheated to the desired temperature (160–200°C). After the prescribed reaction times (3–60min), the reactor was quenched immediately in a water bath to stop the reaction. The reaction products were separated into the solid phase and the aqueous phase by centrifugation at 2150g for 15min. The solid phase was washed by water (ca. 10mL), and the rinsing water was combined with the aqueous phase. After the solid phase was additionally washed with water until the pH of the washing water was above 4.5, the resulting solid phase was lyophilized and weighed for chemical composition analysis. The aqueous phase was filtered sequentially through 1.0 and 0.20μm membrane filters and stored at 4°C for further analysis."
4,Aqueous phase hydrogenation process,"2.3 Aqueous phase hydrogenation process The hydrogenation processes were carried out in a 100mL hastelloy alloy autoclave equipped with a stirring bar (Taiatsu Techno Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The model experiments for investigating the reaction conditions for the hydrogenation of xylose or furfural were carried out as follows: xylose (0.10–1.0g), 5.0wt% Pd/C catalyst (0.10–2.0g), and 0–3.0wt% phosphorous acid aqueous solution (10mL) were placed into the autoclave. For testing the hydrogenation of furfural, furfural (0.10–1.0g), 5.0wt% Pd/C catalyst (0.10–1.0g) and 0–3.0wt% phosphoric acid solution (10mL) were poured into the reactor. After sealing, the reactor was sequentially degassed by flushing with helium, purged with low-pressure hydrogen, and then heated to the desired temperature (120–200°C). The stirring speed was fixed at 800rpm. Upon reaching the reaction temperature, the gas phase was pressurized up to 5MPa of hydrogen and thereafter the reaction was started. After the prescribed reaction times (1 or 2h) the autoclave was air-cooled. The catalysts were separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation at 2150g for 15min. The procedure for investigating the hydrogenation of the hydrolysate containing xylose or furfural obtained by the hydrothermal treatment of the napier grass was as follows: the aqueous phase solution after the treatment (5.0mL, 3.0wt% phosphorous acid at 160°C for 15min or 3.0wt% phosphoric acid at 180°C for 30min) and 5.0wt% Pd/C catalyst (0.03–1.40g) were placed into the autoclave. The subsequent protocol was as mentioned above."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods 2.4.1 Analyses of the reaction products in the aqueous phase The reaction products in the aqueous phase were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as follows. Xylose and glucose were quantified by post-column fluorescence derivatization following their reaction with arginine. A Shimadzu LC-10A HPLC system (Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Asahipak NH2P-50 4E column (4.6×250mm, Showa Denko Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a CRB-6A chemical reaction bath, and Shimadzu RF-20A fluorescence detector was used to analyze the products. A Shimadzu LC-10A system equipped with a Shimadzu RID-10A differential refractive index detector and a Shimadzu SPD-20A UV–VIS detector fitted with an ULTRON PS-80H column (8.0×300mm, Shinwa Kako Inc., Kyoto, Japan) were used to analyze furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), xylitol, 1,4-anhydroxylitol, and THFA. 2.4.2 Determination of the structural carbohydrates and lignin in the napier grass The chemical composition of the treated and untreated napier grass were determined according to a modified NREL-LAP (the Laboratory Analytical Procedure of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) (Sluiter et al., 2008) as follows. The sample (300mg, the extractive-free napier grass or the freeze-dried solid phase material obtained after the hydrothermal processes) and 72wt% sulfuric acid (3.0mL) were incubated for 1h at 30°C with occasional stirring by a glass rod. The mixture was diluted to 4wt% sulfuric acid and then heated at 121°C for 1h in an autoclave. Acid insoluble lignin was calculated using the acid insoluble residue with a correction for the acid insoluble ash determined by the following combustion of the acid insoluble residue at 600°C. Acid soluble lignin in the hydrolysate was determined by a spectrophotometric method (Sluiter et al., 2008). Structural carbohydrates, glucan (glucose) and xylan (xylose) were quantitatively determined from the hydrolysate by HPLC as described above in Section 2.4.1. Ash in the treated or untreated napier grass was determined by combustion at 600°C."

7,Selective production of xylose and furfural from napier grass by a hydrothermal process with phosphorus oxoacids,"3.1 Selective production of xylose and furfural from napier grass by a hydrothermal process with phosphorus oxoacids The extractive-free napier grass was composed of 30.4wt% glucan, 15.8wt% xylan, 11.0wt% acid insoluble lignin, 5.9wt% acid soluble lignin, and 13.6wt% ash. Firstly the conditions for the selective production of xylose and furfural from napier grass by a hydrothermal process with phosphorus oxoacids, phosphoric acid and phosphorous acid, were investigated. In order to examine the effects of the acid concentration, the hydrolysis reactions of the napier grass were conducted in 0.5, 3.0, and 5.0wt% phosphoric acid aqueous solution at 200°C for 3–60min (Fig. 1 ). In the treatments with the acid concentration over 3.0wt%, yields of over 40% of each target compound were obtained in the aqueous phase. At 3.0wt% and 5.0wt% acid, the yields of each xylose and furfural were unchanged, while the total yields of glucose and HMF formed from cellulose in 5.0wt% acid were a little higher than those in 3.0wt% acid. Thus, a lower acid concentration was desirable in order to suppress the degradation of cellulose and lignin. In terms of selective separation of xylan from napier grass, an acid concentration of 3.0wt% was more favorable than 5.0wt%. The hydrothermal process was investigated in 3.0wt% phosphoric acid and phosphorous acid solution at 160–200°C for 5–60min in order to determine the optimal conditions for the selective production of both xylose and furfural from napier grass, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2 . It was clear that temperatures over 180°C were not suitable for the production of xylose, but effective for that of furfural. The process with phosphorous acid at 160°C for 15min gave the highest yield of xylose, corresponding to 77.3% of the xylan in the napier grass. The use of phosphoric acid gave a slightly higher yield of furfural than phosphorous acid and provided lower levels of cellulose degradation as observed in the total yields of glucose and HMF. The highest yield of furfural was about 60% of the xylan in the napier grass at 180°C for 30 and 60min and at 200°C for 15min. In the solid phase, treatment with 3.0wt% phosphorous acid at 160°C for 15min, 94.6% of the glucan and 72.1% of the lignin were retained as shown in Table 1 . Thus, this condition was a superior process to produce xylose selectively from napier grass. On the other hand, retention in the solids after the treatment with 3.0wt% phosphoric acid at 180°C for 30min or at 200°C for 15min which gave the high yields of furfural were about over 75% of the glucan and about over 93% of the lignin. In the solid treated with more severe condition, 180°C for 30min or at 200°C for 15min, the retention of acid insoluble lignin was increased. Previous studies showed that a portion of the lignin was solubilized, and was subsequently condensed and reconstituted with a lignin residue during dilute acid treatment of lignocellulose (Wang et al., 2012). This may explain why the retention of acid insoluble lignin in the solid phase exceeded 100% at temperatures over 180°C. In the process using dilute acid, xylan is hydrolyzed into xylose, and then formed xylose is dehydrated to furfural. Previous studies have reported that xylose was produced by hydrothermal processes below 170°C, whereas furfural was dominantly formed in treatments above 160°C, and the results obtained in the current study were consistent with both these reports (Boussarsar et al., 2009; Gámez et al., 2006; Yemis and Mazza, 2012; Montané et al., 2002). In this study, although an 80% yield of xylose was obtained, the yield of furfural did not exceed 60% for all examined conditions. According to the literature, during the production of furfural from lignocellulose with acid treatment, not all of the xylose is converted to furfural, and the yields of furfural never exceed 55% of the theoretical maximum because a substantial amount of product and substrate are lost to side reactions (Hoydonckx et al., 2007). The results of this study were generally consistent with these observations, thus, the occurrence of any side reactions must be minimized or prevented to effectively obtain furfural. Phosphoric acid has also been investigated for use in the formation of xylose and furfural (Orozco et al., 2011; Gámez et al., 2006; Mäki-Arvela et al., 2011; Hoydonckx et al., 2007). However, few reports exist on the process using phosphorous acid. Based on the results of the current study, phosphorous acid was preferable for the production of xylose, whereas phosphoric acid was favorable for furfural production. These results indicated that the suitable acids for the production of xylose or furfural were different. Phosphorus oxoacids are considered to be more sustainable than sulfuric acid that is generally used for the production of xylose and furfural as follows: phosphorus oxoacids are environmentally friendly and less harmful than sulfuric acid, and a process using sulfuric acid causes the generation of a large amount of waste, sulfuric salts, whereas phosphate salts are themselves environmentally friendly and beneficial since they could be utilized as fertilizers, buffers in fermentation processes, and nutrients for microorganisms (Orozco et al., 2011; Lenihan et al., 2010). Also a development of the technologies for the recovery and recycle of phosphorus oxoacids at the end of the process seems to be important for more sustainable process. To our knowledge, the recovery of phosphoric acid from etching waste of semiconductor industry has been investigated (Kim et al., 2012), and the recovery of it from hydrolysate of rice straw was also studied by Yanagida et al. (2010). According to these literatures, diffusion dialysis using anion exchange membranes seems to be a potent technology for acid recovery from the industrially generated waste and hydrolysate of lignocellulose."
8,Production of xylitol and THFA from the napier grass hydrolysate by aqueous phase hydrogenation with Pd/C,"3.2 Production of xylitol and THFA from the napier grass hydrolysate by aqueous phase hydrogenation with Pd/C Previous studies regarding the hydrogenation of xylose or furfural in an acid aqueous solution with Pd/C have not been reported. Therefore, the conditions for the efficient hydrogenation of xylose into xylitol and furfural into THFA with 5.0wt% Pd/C in acid solution were first investigated using a commercial substrate. 3.2.1 Production of xylitol by acid aqueous phase hydrogenation using commercial xylose The hydrogenation of xylose was conducted with 1.0–10.0w/v% commercial xylose and a 0.05–1.00 ratio of substrate/catalyst (S/C) in 0 and 3.0wt% phosphorous acid solution at 5.0MPa H2 and 120–150°C for 2h, and the results are shown in Table 2 . Xylose in 3.0wt% phosphorous acid solution was converted into xylitol, although the yield of xylitol was 10% lower compared with the reaction in water (Table 2, entry 1, 3). A maximum yield of 62.6% xylitol was obtained with 10.0w/v% xylose and a S/C ratio of 1.0 at 135°C for 2h in a 3.0wt% acid solution. The use of higher temperatures led to a decrease in the yield of xylitol (Table 2, entries 3–4), whereas the yield of 1,4-anhydroxylitol which is a dehydrated form of xylitol was increased (data not shown). Also the use of a lower concentration of xylose resulted in a decrease in the xylose conversion (Table 2, entries 3, 5). When the hydrogenation processes with 1.0w/v% xylose solution were conducted, more addition of catalyst in the system caused an increase in the xylose conversion, and 56.2% yield of xylitol was obtained from a S/C ratio of 0.10 (Table 2, entries 5–7). The reaction conditions required for the xylose hydrogenation (120–150°C for 2h) are similar to those in the presence of acid for the xylose dehydration into furfural (Vázquez et al., 2007), therefore the occurrence of unwanted side reactions which decrease the yield of xylitol was considered in the current study. However, the use of 3.0wt% phosphorous acid did not result in a drastic increase in side reactions because the yield of xylitol in the acid was only 10% lower than that in water. In contrast, the concentration of xylose (Table 2, entries 3, 5) and the ratio of S/C (Table 2, entries 5–7) in the solution had a significant effect on the hydrogenation. At the lower concentration of xylose (1.0w/v% xylose, S/C=1.0), the conversion of xylose was very low (Table 2, entry 5). When the hydrogenation was conducted with the lower concentration of xylose, the increase of Pd/C (S/C=0.1) promoted the formation of xylitol (Table 2, entry 6). Taken together, these results suggest that the higher concentration of xylose is important for effective hydrogenation and for a low dose of catalyst. 3.2.2 Production of THFA by acid aqueous phase hydrogenation using commercial furfural The hydrogenation processes of furfural were carried out with 1.0–10.0w/v% commercial furfural and a 1.00 ratio of S/C in 0 and 3.0wt% phosphoric acid solution at 5.0MPa H2 and 150–200°C for 1h (Table 3 ). It should be noted that the treatments in the acid solution with Pd/C led to the direct production of THFA from furfural, and a maximum yield of 73.3% THFA was obtained when the reaction was conducted with 1.0w/v% furfural solution at 150°C for 1h (Table 3, entry 4). The presence of 3.0wt% acid in the solution only minimally affected the hydrogenation of furfural, similar to the case of xylose hydrogenation. The most important factor for the production of THFA was the concentration of furfural. The lower 1.0w/v% furfural concentration led to the formation of THFA at higher yield while hydrogenation with 10.0w/v% furfural resulted in almost no THFA (Table 3, entries 4 and 6). According to previous studies, treatments of furfural with acid solutions at higher temperature for longer residence times gave rise to side reactions such as cross-polymerization with other intermediates resulting in the formation of humins (Hoydonckx et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2013). In the current study, the concentration of furfural is the most important factor for THFA production. In the reactions with higher concentrations of furfural, THFA and other reaction products were only minimally detected, although the conversion of furfural was 100% (Table 3, entries 2, 6 and 8). This may be ascribed to a condensation reaction. Interestingly, a 1.0w/v% concentration of furfural promoted hydrogenation and effective production of THFA whereas 1.0w/v% of xylose was only minimally converted into xylitol. These results showed that the properties and mechanisms of theses hydrogenation reaction with Pd/C were largely different. THFA is conventionally produced by a two-step catalytic hydrogenation of furfural via furfuryl alcohol over Cu−Cr and noble metal catalysts separately (Hoydonckx et al., 2007). Although direct catalytic production from furfural used to be attempted as the demand for THFA increased in recent years, there have been few reports on the direct conversion of furfural to THFA at high yield. Recently, Biradar et al. (2014) proposed that the use of 3% Pd/MFI gave the high yields, 62–95% of THFA from the direct hydrogenation of furfural in a single reactor. In the current study, the use of commercial Pd/C for the direct hydrogenation of furfural gave high yield of THFA. 3.2.3 Production of xylitol and THFA from the napier grass hydrolysate by acid aqueous phase hydrogenation Based on the model experiments in Section 3.2.1, hydrogenation of xylose in the hydrolysate was carried out at a 0.05–1.00 ratio of S/C and 135°C for 2h (Table 4 , entries 1–3). The hydrolysate was obtained by treatment at 160°C for 15min from napier grass containing 1.4w/v% xylose in 3.0wt% phosphorous acid. Because the concentration of xylose in the hydrolysate was relatively low, the hydrogenation using a 0.05 ratio of S/C was conducted so as to increase the hydrogenation efficiency of xylose. The yield of xylitol increased up to 66.8%, which corresponded to 51.6% based on the xylan in the napier grass. The hydrolysate containing xylose from napier grass included a variety of other compounds. Although it was concerned that these contaminating compounds would compete with xylose over Pd/C during the hydrogenation process and result in a decrease in the xylitol yield, this could be overcome by using a low S/C ratio. It is clear that the simplified two-step process for xylitol production in high yield from napier grass was accomplished using 3.0wt% phosphorous acid hydrolysis and hydrogenation with Pd/C. Subsequently, hydrogenation of the hydrolysate containing 0.66w/v% furfural was conducted at a 0.10–1.00 ratio of S/C and 150°C for 1h (Table 4, entries 4–6). The hydrolysate was recovered after the hydrothermal process with 3.0wt% phosphoric acid at 180°C for 30min from napier grass and directly subjected to hydrogenation. The model experiments in Section 3.2.2 predicted that a 1.0 ratio of S/C might give a high yield of THFA since the concentration of furfural in the hydrolysate was low and was close to the optimal condition in Table 3. When the 0.10 ratio of S/C was applied to the hydrogenation of furfural, the yield of THFA was significantly increased up to 71.4%, which corresponded to 41.4% based on the xylan in the napier grass. For the 1.0 ratio of S/C, the yield of THFA was much lower than those of the model experiments using commercial furfural, although the conversion of furfural was still high. In this case, a large amount of contaminating compounds in the hydrolysate may be competing with furfural over Pd/C, and unhydrogenated furfural may suffer extensive side reactions, such as polymerization and degradation. The increase in Pd/C loading assists in the effective production of THFA and suppression of side reactions. Since a large amount of organic compounds and inorganic compounds as well as xylose and furfural are contained in the hydrolysate of napier grass, an activity of Pd/C is expected to be decreased gradually. A reason of the deactivation will be considered to be an adhesion of organic compounds onto Pd/C, and the catalysts suffered from this type of deactivation, so called a primary poisoning, can be regenerated by a steam activation or a supercritical fluid extraction (Dabek et al., 2005, 2007). The recyclability and the regeneration of Pd/C are needed for a sustainable process and it will be centerpiece in future study. So far, there are no reports on the production of THFA using a hydrolysate from lignocellulose and a few papers on the production of xylitol. This study proposed a simplified process for direct acquisition at high yields of xylitol and THFA from napier grass."
9,Conclusions,"In the current study, effective production of xylitol and THFA from napier grass was achieved by a simple two-step process via the corresponding intermediate production, xylose or furfural, including a hydrothermal reaction with phosphorus oxoacids and direct hydrogenation of the hydrolysate with Pd/C. The yields of xylitol and THFA obtained by hydrogenation using the each napier grass hydrolysate were almost the same as those of hydrogenation using each commercial material. This study also revealed that the concentration of the substrates in hydrolysate was important for the effective hydrogenation to produce xylitol and THFA."
