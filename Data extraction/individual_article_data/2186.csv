0,Introduction,"Hydrogen energy is known as the next generation of secondary clean energy, but the efficient preparation, safe storage and transportation of hydrogen have been the bottlenecks to the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Because methanol can be safely transported, hydrogen may be stored in liquid methanol for the safe transportation. When needed, hydrogen is produced in situ by methanol steam reforming at a relatively low temperature to release hydrogen stored in methanol. It is considered as a feasible way to utilize hydrogen energy, low energy consumption, easy integration with on-board or fixed polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [1,2]. Moreover, with the successful development of the highly active catalytic system, the concept of hydrogen storage in methanol and reforming release when needed may be applied in practice, which will be a significant breakthrough in the storage and transport system of hydrogen energy [1–3]. From the stoichiometry of the overall reaction for methanol steam reforming (MSR), as shown in Eq. (1), no carbon monoxide and methane are produced in H2 rich stream. However, methanol steam reforming is frequently accompanied with side reactions, such as Eqs. (2)–(6). Methanol decomposition Eq. (2) and water-gas shift reaction Eq. (3), will result in the formation of CO as by-product in H2 rich stream, which would be controlled as small as possible in order to avoid poisoning of the Pt anode of the fuel cell. The limitation of CO concentration for PEMFC application is in the range of 10 ppm–50 ppm. From side reactions Eqs. (4)–(6), by-product CH4 also appears probably in H2 rich stream. (1) C H 3 OH ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) ⇄ C O 2 +3 H 2 Δ H 298K Θ = − 50KJ/mol (2) C H 3 OH ( g ) ⇄ CO+2 H 2 Δ H 298K Θ = 91KJ/mol (3) CO+ H 2 O ( g ) ⇄ C O 2 + H 2 Δ H 298K Θ = -41KJ/mol (4) 2CO ⇄ C + C O 2 (5) C + 2 H 2 ⇄ C H 4 (6) CO+3 H 2 ⇄ C H 4 + H 2 O A large number of research works can be found in the literature regarding the preparation of high-effect catalysts for methanol steam reforming [4]. It is expected that catalysts have a high methanol conversion with high hydrogen yield and low concentration of CO as the undesired byproduct at a relative lower temperature. According to the published works, catalysts are divided mainly in three groups: copper-based catalysts [5–8], palladium-based catalysts [9–11] and nickel-based catalysts [12–14]. Copper-based catalysts are the most active ones, and the most common catalysts for methanol steam reforming. Both palladium-based catalysts and nickel-based catalysts present better results in terms of thermal stability and long-term stability, but the preparation cost and the reforming temperatures are relatively higher. Some authors tried to synthesize catalysts based on different alloy species, such as nickel and studied the effect of Zn addition on bimetallic catalysts to overcome these difficulties. To improve the methanol conversion for H2 production at a relatively low temperature, a few researchers tried to develop the process intensification of sorption-enhanced methanol steam reforming for hydrogen production in order to obtain high-purity H2 with low CO2 and CO contents [15,16]. Their research works were focused on the thermodynamic analysis, and the experimental researches were scarce. Similar research works, sorption-enhanced water gas shift reaction for high-purity hydrogen production, have attracted the attention of many scholars [17–20], and there were also many reports on the development of high temperature CO2 sorbents and their application for hydrogen production by sorption enhanced methane steam reforming, sorption enhanced ethanol steam reforming et al. [21–25]. In the sorption-enhanced reaction, the preparation of the high temperature CO2 sorbents is very important. Usually, hydrotalcite and K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite have good CO2 adsorption capacities at high temperature, easy regeneration and low preparation cost, which is suitable for sorption enhanced hydrocarbon steam reforming for hydrogen production [26–33]. When the steam reforming is at a relatively low temperature, such as water gas shift reaction in range of 423 K–573 K, 13X zeolite and Na-Mg double salt-based sorbent have been also recommended as CO2 sorbents [18,20]. The uniform packing of catalyst and sorbent mixture is also very important for sorption enhanced reaction, several kinds of packing configurations have been investigated for sorption-enhanced water gas shift reaction [18–20], including the mixture packing with catalyst-only pellets and sorbent-only pellets, catalyst-sorbent pellets packing and multilayer-pattern packing. In this work, we shall investigate experimentally the configuration between CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite packed in reactor for sorption-enhanced methanol steam reforming."
1,Experimental details,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Copper-based catalysts for methanol steam reforming were purchased from Alfa Aesar Company, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts with the mass ratio of 50%/30%/20%. Catalysts were crushed into 2 mm particle size for experiments. The key microstructure parameters of catalysts are BET surface area 76.31 m2/g, micropore volume 0.209 cm3/g, micropore average diameter 10.95 nm. Fig. 1 a showed CuO and ZnO crystalline phases in copper-based catalysts by XRD characterization. Hydrotalcites (HTlcs) were used to adsorb CO2 gas, which were purchased from SIFGMA-ALDRICH Company. The main compositions of hydrotalcite were MgO (58.89%, mass fraction) and Al2O3 (39.43%, mass fraction). The key microstructure parameters of hydrotalcite were BET surface area 22.01 m2/g, micropore volume 0.098 cm3/g, micropore average diameter 16.17 nm. Fig. 1b showed the hydrotalcite crystalline phase by XRD characterization. Methanol and K2CO3 were analytical-reagent grade, supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. CO2 and N2 used in experiments were supplied by Jiajie Gas company (Shanghai, China) with purity of CO2 >99.99%, N2 >99.995%. Helium was from Air Liquide company (China) with purity of He >99.999%."
3,Preparation of K-hydrotalcite and composite sorbent-catalyst pellets,"2.2 Preparation of K-hydrotalcite and composite sorbent-catalyst pellets To improve CO2 adsorption amount on hydrotalcite, the commercial hydrotalcite powders were modified with K2CO3 impregnation. The fresh hydrotalcite powders underwent calcination at 673 K for four hours to remove volatile impurities. And then, K2CO3 solution was used to leach the calcinated HTlc powders at 303 K,where K2CO3 amount was added as 20% of hydrotalcite weight. After the ultrasonic dispersion of samples, K2CO3 impregnation continued for 4 h to keep alkali metal into the interlayer space of hydrotalcite. The impregnated slurries were extruded with a syringe, dried at 473 K, and crushed as cylinder shape (diameter 2 mm, length 2 mm). Hydrotalcite after K2CO3 modification was marked as K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite (K-hydrotalcite) for CO2 adsorption. Composite sorbent-catalyst pellets were prepared with the uniform mixture of K-hydrotalcite powders and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst powders. The commercial copper-based catalyst particles were crushed into powders, and mixed with the prepared K-hydrotalcite powders. And then, the mixed slurries were extruded with a syringe, dried at 473 K, and crushed as cylinder shape (diameter 2 mm, length 2 mm) for experiments."
4,Experiments for sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming in the fixed bed reactor,"2.3 Experiments for sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming in the fixed bed reactor The experiments of sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming were carried out in a fixed bed reactor, as shown in Fig. 2 , where a quartz tube with 16 mm inner diameter was packed with the mixture of K-hydrotalcites and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. Here, two packed modes were adopted, one packed mode (called as Case 1) was that the column was packed with the mixture of K-hydrotalcite particles and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 particles, and the other packed mode (called as Case 2) was the column packed with the composite sorbent-catalyst pellets. The total packed amount was 58 g with 4.8:1 of sorbent/catalyst ratio for both Case 1 and Case 2, which means two modes with the same sorbent packed amount and the same catalyst packed amount in the fixed bed reactor. Fresh catalysts in the fixed bed needed to activate under the ambience of 10% H2 and 90% N2 at 573 K for 2 h with 150 mL/min flowrate, and the heating rate was controlled as 2 K/min. After activation, Cu active ingredient was formed on the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 3 . Fresh K-hydrotalcites packed in the quartz tube also needed activation through nitrogen purge at 673 K for 4 h before used to adsorb CO2. The activation of composite adsorbent-catalyst pellets included the above mentioned nitrogen purge step for K-hydrotalcites regeneration and H2 reduction step for copper-based catalyst activation. After activation, copper-based catalysts, K-hydrotalcites and composite adsorbent-catalyst particles packed in the fixed bed reactor were used repeatedly for experiments of sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming. For the experiments of sorption enhanced reaction, the feedstock with methanol and water was pre-mixed at a given water/methanol mole ratio and stored in a bottle. When performing experiments, the water/methanol mixture was pumped into a vaporizer at a given flow rate by a syringe pump, while helium as the carrier gas was also fed into the vaporizer at a set flow rate. Three subsequent steps were involved during experiments. In the first step, helium carrier gas passed through the packed column, in the same time, the packed column was heated to a given reaction temperature, stabilizing temperature for 30 min. The reaction temperature was controlled by a temperature controller and was measured by a thermocouple placed in the center of the reactor. In the second step, methanol solution with a given water alcohol ratio was input from the top of the packed column through the controlled volume pump. When methanol and steam passed through the packed column, methanol steam reforming occurred on copper-based catalysts, in the same time, by product CO2 was adsorbed by K-hydrotalcites, sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming being in progress. From the outlet of the packed column, the compositions of gases were analyzed online by mass spectrometer (HPR20 QIC, Hiden Analytical Ltd) after condensation of unreacted methanol and steam. When K-hydrotalcites in the packed column reached the maximum allowable CO2 adsorption amount, the sorption enhanced reaction became insignificant. The reaction was stopped and sorbents in the packed column were regenerated for reuse. In the third step, K-hydrotalcites saturated with CO2 adsorption in the packed column were regenerated with nitrogen purge at 673 K for 5 h to desorb CO2 for repeated use. After sorbents regeneration in the reactor, next experiment was carried out by repeating the above mentioned three steps."
5,Characterization of materials and thermogravimetric analysis,"2.4 Characterization of materials and thermogravimetric analysis The micropore structure information of sorbents and catalysts were obtained by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K using ASAP2020HD88 Micrometrics Instrument (USA). According to the measured data, the specific surface area (SBET) was calculated using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The calculation of the mesopore size and total volume was carried out by applying the BJH model to desorption branch of the isotherm. The micropore volume was obtained by t-plot method, and median pore width and pore size distribution were determined using HK method. The surface morphologies of sorbents and catalysts were collected by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a NOVA Nano SEM450 (FEI Ltd., USA). The crystalline structures of sorbents and catalysts were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D8 Advance X-Ray Polycrystaline Diffractometer (Bruker AXS, GER) and operating in a 2θ range of 5–90° at a scanning rate of 0.02°/s. A thermogravimetry (TG) - differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instrument Q600 SDT (TA Instrument, USA) was used to characterize the decomposition behavior of hydrotalcite samples. During the thermogravimetric analysis, the sample of hydrotalcites (about 10 mg) in Pt crucibles was heated at a heating rate of 5 K/min from 298 K to 873 K under N2 atmosphere at a flow rate of 150 mL/min."
6,Results and discussion,"During the sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming process, the performance of sorbent is very important, which must have a higher CO2 adsorption capacity, east regeneration and good synergistic relationship with copper-based catalyst. In this work, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was selected for methanol steam reforming, the suitably reforming temperature was in the range of 473 K–573 K. As a potential candidate of CO2 sorbent, the CO2 adsorption and desorption behaviors on K-hydrotalcites (K-HTlcs) were studied in order to provide the basic information for the design of adsorptive reactor."
7,CO2 adsorption and desorption behaviors on the prepared K-hydrotalcites,"3.1 CO2 adsorption and desorption behaviors on the prepared K-hydrotalcites Figs. 4 a and b showed the decomposition profiles of original hydrotalcite and K-hydrotalcite measured by thermogravimetric analysis. According to the inflection points or peaks of the DSC profiles, four decomposition reactions were deduced. The first inflection point was at about 430 K for the loss of the locked water in the interlayer of hydrotalcite, the peaks at 450 K and 580 K corresponded to the loss of the OH− groups bonded to Al3+ and to Mg2+, respectively, and decarbonation was observed at inflection point (about 680 K) which would favor the regeneration of hydrotalcite after CO2 adsorption. CO2 adsorption amounts on K-hydrotalcites were measured by Thermogravimetric instrument at the range of 473 K–673 K with 20%, 50% and 80% CO2 in N2 mixture at 1 bar, respectively. The CO2 adsorption amount was calculated with 1.5 h adsorption time in TGA test, which was close to the adsorption equilibrium stage. From Fig. 5 a, it was found that the hydrotacite had a lower CO2 adsorption capacity, after K2CO3 impregnation, the CO2 adsorption capacity on K-hydrotacite was improved about 30%, for example, at 673 K with 0.8 mmol CO2/g sorbent. In Table 1 , CO2 adsorption amounts on K-hydrotalcites obtained in this work were compared with that from literatures [26–33], and the good CO2 adsorption performance was found for the prepared K-hydrotacite. Fig. 5b showed the CO2 adsorption equilibrium isotherms at different temperature, and the Sips model was used to fit the experimental data with the relative error R 2 = 0.9302 . (7) Sips model = q m ( k 0 × e x p ( − H / 8.3145 / T ) × p ) × ( 1 / n ) 1 + ( k 0 × e x p ( − H / 8.3145 / T ) × p ) × ( 1 / n ) Where the fitting parameters were q m = 1 .052 mol/kg , K 0 = 1 .795 × 1 0 8 1/kPa , H = 9 .77 × 1 0 4 J/mol and n = 3 .718 . For a potential CO2 sorbent, it has not only a higher CO2 adsorption capacity, but also it needs to regenerate easily after CO2 adsorption. According to the TG–DTG curves of K-hydrotalcites in Fig. 4b, decarbonation was observed at inflection point (about 680 K) which maybe favor the regeneration of K-hydrotalcites after CO2 adsorption. The regeneration of K-hydrotalcites was tested at 673 K with nitrogen purge, and compared with that at 473 K. As shown in Fig. 6 , it was found that K-hydrotalcites almost could not be regenerated at 473 K with nitrogen purge. When the regeneration temperature increased to 673 K, K-hydrotalcites after CO2 adsorption were regenerated very well by nitrogen purge due to decarbonation. Therefore, in the following experiments of sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming, K-hydrotalcites packed in the reactor were regenerated with nitrogen purge at 673 K at each experiment for multiuse."
8,Sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming,"3.2 Sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming The fixed bed reactor was packed with the mixture of K-hydrotalcites and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, total packed amount was 58 gram with 4.8:1 mass ratio of sorbent/catalyst. Two kinds of packed modes were tested for the sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming, Case 1 with the mixing packed mode of K-hydrotalcite particles and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst particles, and Case 2 packed with the composite sorbent-catalyst particles. For comparison of process intensification between Case1 and Case 2, the operation conditions for the methanol steam reforming were set the same for both packed modes, experimental results were demonstrated in Figs. 7–13 , respectively. 3.2.1 Fixed bed reactor packed with the mixture of sorbent particles and catalyst particles Figs. 7–9 showed the experimental results of methanol steam reforming obtained with Case 1 packed mode in the adsorptive reactor. The effluent profiles of H2, CO2, CO, CO, CH4 gaseous compositions from the reactor were demonstrated in Fig. 7 for methanol steam reforming at 533 K, steam/methanol (S/C) molar ratio 3, 1.24 bar. The space velocity of methanol was 9.5 × 10 3 h - 1 , defined as the volumetric flow rate of methanol divided by the packed volume of sorbents and catalysts in the column. When the feedstock of methanol and steam was input into the reactor, methanol would react with steam to produce mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide on copper-based catalysts, in the same time, by product CO2 was adsorbed by K-hydrotalcites packed in the column. From the outlet of the column, a high-purity H2 stream with trace amount of CO2, CO and CH4 impurities was obtained at the initial ten minutes of reaction, which attributed to the remarkable CO2 sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming. After ten minutes, K-hydrotalcites packed in the column had the slow adsorption rate due to the intraparticle diffusion resistance for CO2 adsorption. Although the sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming still went on, the enhancement efficiency became not obvious. After one hour, CO2 adsorption on K-hydrotalcites reached almost the saturation state, the sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming changed into the convectional methanol steam reforming by catalysts. As known, if used for fuel gas in fuel cells, the H2 rich stream obtained from the adsorptive reactor would contain no or trace amount of CO impurity. For the clear view, we scaled up H2, CO2, CO and CH4 effluent curves in Fig.7, and showed them again in Fig. 8a–d, respectively. From Fig. 8c, it was found CO content in the H2 rich stream less than 0.1% at 533 K, and the methanol conversion reached 90%, as shown in Fig. 8e. Here, the methanol conversion was calculated based on H2 production. Figs. 8a–e also showed the experimental results for sorption enhanced methanol reforming at a lower temperature, for example 473 K. To decrease the reaction temperature, the methanol conversion was reduced from 90% at 533 K to 60% at 473 K. According to Eq. (2), CO formation was due to the methanol decomposition, so the lower reforming temperature could inhibit the undesirable CO formation. But from the experimental results in Fig. 8c, it was found that CO content was increased to 0.9% at 473 K, which was almost ten times of that at 533 K. Moreover, we also found a little amount of CH4 formation in Fig. 8d. The experimental data demonstrated the lower reforming temperature could not reduce the CO content in H2 rich stream in the adsorptive reactor. The recommended reforming temperature in the adsorptive reactor was about 533 K when using K-hydrotalcites as CO2 sorbents and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. For methanol steam reforming, the steam/methanol molar ratio was also an important operation condition. According to Eq. (1), the stoichiometric S/C molar ratio was 1, and overuse of steam would be a waste of energy. Figs. 9a–e showed the effect of S/C ratio on sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming in a reactor with Case 1 packed mode. Here, the steam/methanol molar ratio was set a different value by adjusting the steam molar flow rate at constant methanol flow rate, that is the space velocity of methanol still as 9.5 × 10 3 h - 1 for three S/C ratios. As expected, the higher S/C ratio promoted the methanol conversion because of excess availability of steam for reaction. The methanol conversion was promoted insignificantly when S/C ratio increased from 3 to 6. But when S/C ratio decreased from 3 to 1.5, the methanol conversion was reduced from 90% to 40%. And then, we checked the CO content in H2 rich stream at the different S/C ratio, it seemed the best one with S/C = 3. During the initial stage of sorption enhanced reaction, it was found that CO formation was not inhibited in the complex adsorption and reaction system, where the methanol steam reforming was accompanied with side reactions. 3.2.2 Fixed bed packed with composite sorbent-catalyst particles Fig. 10 showed the effluent profiles of H2, CO2, CO, CH4 gaseous compositions from a fixed bed reactor for methanol steam reforming with the composite sorbent-catalyst particles packed mode (Case 2). For comparison of enhancement performance between Case 1 and Case 2, the columns were packed with the same amount of sorbent and the same amount of catalyst, and the operation conditions for the methanol steam reforming were also same as Fig. 7. For Case 2 packed mode, there also existed the sorption enhanced the methanol steam reforming phenomena, a rolling up of methanol conversion was formatted in Fig.11e, where a high-purity hydrogen with trace amount of CO2 and CO impurities was obtained at the initial ten minutes of reaction. At the same operation conditions as Case 1, the conventional methanol conversion with CO2 adsorption saturation was reduced to 40% in Case 2 packed mode, while the conventional methanol conversion in Case 1 packed mode reached above 90%. The reduction of the conventional methanol conversion means the loss of catalytic activities under the alkaline atmosphere of K-hydrotalcites. And then, we checked the CO content in the H2 rich stream by scale up the effluent profiles of CO, CO2, CH4, and H2 in Fig. 10 into Fig. 11a–d, respectively. CO content was increased to 2.0% in Case 2 packed mode, which was twenty times of that in Case 1 packed mode. We also found a little amount of CH4 impurity in the H2 rich stream. When the reforming temperature was reduced to 473 K, as shown in Fig. 11, CO2 sorption enhancement of the methanol steam reforming was more obvious at the initial reaction time. After enhancement, the conventional methanol conversion at CO2 adsorption saturation was decreased to less than 10%. Moreover, CO and CH4 were formed, CO content up to 8%, CH4 content up to 4%. Due to the decrease of methanol conversion, the effect of the methanol/steam molar ratio on effluent concentrations of H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and methanol conversion became insignificant, as shown in Fig. 12. 3.2.3 Effect of packed mode on methanol conversion and sorbent/catalyst stability In order to investigate the synergistic interaction between CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcites in the reactor, we tested two packing modes. In above-mentioned discussion, we compared the experimental results between Case 1 and Case 2 packed modes at 533 K and 473 K. Fig. 13a and b showed experimental results obtained at the other temperatures, including 423 K, 453 K, 493 K, 513 K and 553 K with both packed modes. For these temperatures, there were the obvious phenomena of sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming at the initial reaction stage for two packed modes. Based on the experimental results in Fig.13a and b, we calculated the enhanced methanol conversion taken at the maximum H2 production point and the conventional methanol conversion taken at CO2 adsorption saturation point, and represented in Fig. 14 a. In addition, we also compared the H2 production at the sorption enhanced reaction stage with that without enhancement, as shown in Fig. 14b. The enhancement in Case 2 was more obvious than that in Case 1, but the conventional methanol conversion in Case 2 was reduced due to the loss of catalytic activities under the alkaline atmosphere of K-hydrotalcites. Wu’s group [15] reported high-purity hydrogen production by sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming in the fixed bed reactor with Case 1 packed mode. Their experimental results showed the enhanced methanol conversion as 74.18% and the conventional methanol convention as 52.67% at 453 K, S/M = 2, catalyst/sorbent = 5 g/20 g. Our experimental results were the enhanced methanol conversion as 75.19% and the conventional methanol conversion as 58.50% at 453 K, S/M = 3, catalyst/sorbent = 10 g/48 g. Both experimental results were consistent with each other. After experiments at different temperature, sorbent samples and catalyst samples were taken out from the reactor, and the morphologies of these samples were characterized through SEM images and ASAP2020HD88 Micrometrics Instrument, as shown in Fig. 15 and Table 2 . SEM images showed the microstructures of K-hydrotalcites and copper-based catalysts were stable after multi-cyclic adsorption, desorption and reaction. BET surface area, micropore volume, micropore average diameter for both K-hydrotalcites and copper-based catalysts slightly decreased. These characterization results showed that CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcites had good stabilities during sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming. It should be mentioned that the catalyst screening is very important. Here, we use the commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst as case to investigate experimentally the configuration between CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite. For sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst works well at temperature between 423 K and 573 K, as shown in Fig. 13a. Based on the experimental data of CO2 adsorption equilibrium isotherms in Fig. 5b, it is found that K-HTlc has a lower CO2 adsorption capacity, especially at 423 K to 523 K. From Fig. 7 to Fig. 13 for sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming, CO2 adsorption front broke quickly in the packed column due to the lower CO2 adsorption capacity on K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcite, which would reduce the high purity H2 productivity with low CO and CO2 content. Recently, Rodrigues group [20] and Lee group [18] reported 13X zeolite and Na-Mg double salt-based sorbent had good CO2 adsorption capacities in the range of 423 K to 523 K. With the high efficient sorbent development, sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming will be improved further."
9,Conclusion,"CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst has a good catalytic performance for methanol steam reforming at 473 K–573 K. K2CO3 promoted hydrotalcites (K-hydrotalcites) is a potential candidate of CO2 sorbent in the range of 473 K–573 K, and easy regeneration with nitrogen purge at 673 K. When the reactor is packed with the mixture of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst particles and K-hydrotalcite particles, H2 rich stream with low CO content (less than 0.1%) can be obtained through sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming at 533 K, methanol/steam molar ratio 3, the space velocity of methanol 9.5 × 10 3 h - 1 . However, when the reactor is packed with the composite sorbent-catalyst particles, there exists obvious sorption enhanced methanol steam reforming, but the methanol conversion is reduced due to the loss of catalytic activities under the alkaline atmosphere of K-hydrotalcites. Therefore, in the future, attention must be paid on the synergic relationship between catalysts and sorbents to improve the intensification for methanol steam reforming through CO2 adsorption separation."
