0,Introduction,"Higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) from coal or natural gas via syngas has the potential for production of gasoline octane booster and primary materials of chemical industries. The catalytic HAS from syngas was first reported in the 1920's [1]. Up to now, HAS from syngas is still an interesting subject for both industrial application and fundamental research. Several types of catalysts, including (I) the modified methanol catalysts (Zn–Cr and Cu–Zn based catalysts) [2–5], (II) the modified Fisher–Tropsch (F–T) catalysts (Cu–Co based catalysts) [6–11], (III) the Mo-based catalysts [12–18] and (IV) the supported noble metal catalysts (supported Ru, Rh and Pd catalysts) [19–22], were developed for the conversion of syngas to alcohols. Among these catalyst systems available for HAS from syngas, Cu–Co based catalyst was considered as one of the most promising catalysts [10,11]. However, the poor stabilization in long-term run and the low total alcohol selectivity from the practical point of view restricted its progress [23]. Using other F–T element such as Fe or Ni to replace Co as active component in the reaction was also studied [24–27]. These catalysts are usually prepared by co-precipitation method, but the reproducible preparation of a suitable catalyst, by this method, is difficult and all the steps (precipitation temperature, pH value, aging time and temperature, drying and calcination methods, etc.) of preparation of the catalysts should be carefully controlled [28]. In our laboratory, a simple high temperature fusion method to prepare the Fe–Cu based catalyst was developed [29–31]. The fused Fe–Cu based catalyst via this method showed good results, e.g. 67% C2+OH selectivity at 37% CO conversion obtained over fused Fe1.3Cu1.0V0.04K0.05Mn0.15 catalyst [30], 59% C2+OH selectivity with the space–time yield of higher alcohols of 0.62gmL−1 h−1 over fused Fe1.3Cu1.0Zn0.2K0.05Al0.02 catalyst [31]. In order to find the active species of the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst in HAS from syngas and design catalyst with superior properties, we studied the fused Fe–Cu–Zn–K–Al catalyst in the present work by various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analyses, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption and hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD). At the same time, DRIFTS was applied for the investigation of temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of CO and H2."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of the fused Fe–Cu based catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of the fused Fe–Cu based catalysts The purified magnetite, CuO, ZnO, KNO3 and Al2O3 were ground to 300mesh, respectively, and then they were mixed thoroughly according to the molar ratio of Fe:Cu:Zn:K:Al=1.3:1.0:0.2:0.05:0.02. After the mixture was fused in an electric furnace at about 1800K, the products were cooled, crushed and screened to obtain the fused Fe–Cu based samples. The reduced catalyst was prepared via the reduction of the fused catalyst by syngas (1.0MPa) containing trace of CH4 with n(H2):n(CO):n(CO2)=2.3:1.0:0.2. The temperature for reduction was increased from ambient temperature to 653K within 6h and maintained at 653K for 3h. For comparison, a mechanically mixed metal oxide having the same composition with the fused catalyst was also prepared."
3,Characterization of the fused Fe–Cu based catalysts and DRIFTS investigation of TPSR,"2.2 Characterization of the fused Fe–Cu based catalysts and DRIFTS investigation of TPSR XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-3B diffractometer fitted with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5404Å). Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were carried out under hydrogen atmosphere, using a Rigaku TG–DTA–DSC analyzer in the temperature range of 298–773K with a hydrogen flow rate of 40mLmin−1. The sample weight was 10mg, and the heating rate was 5Kmin−1. H2-TPD was done on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2910 AutoChem instrument. The catalysts were pre-reduced in flowing 10vol.% H2–He at 653K for 2h, cooled to ambient temperature, and flushed with He until the baseline was steady. Hydrogen was desorbed by heating the samples at a rate of 5Kmin−1 to 773K in flowing He. DRIFTS of CO adsorption was performed on a Bruker Equinox 55 FT–IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4cm−1. A high pressure/high temperature chamber fitted with ZnSe windows (P/N0030-102, Spectra-Tech. Inc., USA) was utilized as the sample cell. The catalyst placed in the chamber was firstly outgassed under high vacuum (10−3 Pa) at 533K for 1h, and then cooled down to ambient temperature. The reduction of the catalyst by H2 (0.1MPa) was performed at elevated temperature from ambient temperature to 653K, and then the temperature was maintained at 653K for 1h. Subsequently, the catalyst was flushed with Ar and cooled down to ambient temperature again, and then the background spectrum was collected. After slowly introduction of CO (1.3MPa) flow, the spectrum was obtained until it was unchanged with time. Then the temperature of chamber was increased to the next desired temperature for detection. DRIFTS investigation of TPSR was also performed on Bruker Equinox 55 FT–IR spectrometer. Besides 67vol.% H2/33vol.% CO (4.0MPa) flow instead of CO flow and the background spectrum was collected after the introduction of H2/CO at ambient temperature, the other procedures and conditions were same with DRIFTS of CO adsorption experiment."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Crystalline phase of the fused Fe–Cu based samples,"3.1 Crystalline phase of the fused Fe–Cu based samples The XRD patterns of the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst before and after reduction are given in Fig. 1 . For comparison, the XRD pattern of the mechanically mixed sample is also shown. For the three samples, the diffraction peaks ascribed to Zn, K and Al species are too weak to be identified. Only the diffraction peaks attributed to Cu and Fe species are observed. The mechanically mixed sample exhibits the diffraction peaks of the starting materials of CuO and Fe3O4. Different from the mechanically mixed sample, the typical diffraction peaks of CuO disappear in the XRD pattern of the fused catalyst, but new diffraction peaks attributed to Cu2O appear. This suggests that CuO decomposes to Cu2O during the fusion at high temperature (1800K). In addition, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the anti-spinel Fe3O4 decreases drastically, and some new peaks ascribed to CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 appear. The formation of CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 indicates that CuO and Fe3O4 interplay strongly during the fusion at high temperature. After reduction by syngas, the XRD pattern shows the reflection of metallic Cu and Fe, and some weak reflection lines of minor CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 oxides (Fig. 1c). This is accordant with the following observations of TG and H2-TPD. For Fe based catalyst reduced by syngas, Yamada et al. observed the presence of iron carbide species [32]. However, these species are not detected by XRD and the following DRIFTS investigation for Fe–Cu based catalyst. The reason is probably that Cu oxides are easily reduced to metallic Cu that catalyzes the reduction of Fe oxides at lower temperature and thus the formation of iron carbide is restrained."
6,Thermal analyses of the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst,"3.2 Thermal analyses of the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst TG–DTA curves of the fused catalyst and the mechanically mixed sample are shown in Fig. 2 . Because the thermal analyses of the samples were performed under hydrogen atmosphere, the results of TG–DTA represent the reduction process of the samples. For the mechanically mixed sample, the weight loss is brought by the reduction of CuO and Fe3O4. It can be clearly observed that two peaks at 497K and 602K present on the DTA curve of the mechanically mixed sample, which corresponds to the reduction of CuO and Fe3O4, respectively. For the fused catalyst, only one apparent reduction peak appears in the DTA curve. This peak centered at 467K can be ascribed to the reduction of Cu2O. The reduction peaks related to CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 species are not apparent, which means that the reduction of CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 species is difficult [33]. Furthermore, the total weight loss of the fused catalyst is less than that of the mechanically mixed sample, which is because of the lower oxygen content of Cu2O than CuO and the partial reduction of CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4."
7,DRIFTS of CO adsorption and H2-TPD,"3.3 DRIFTS of CO adsorption and H2-TPD The catalytic performance of a catalyst in HAS from syngas to some extent depends on its ability to adsorption and activation for CO and H2. Therefore, we investigated CO adsorption by DRIFTS and H2 adsorption by H2-TPD on the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst. The DRIFTS of CO adsorption on the fused Fe–Cu based catalysts is shown in Fig. 3 . The spectrum is mainly composed of two absorption bands at 2000–2250cm−1 and 2300–2400cm−1, corresponding to the vibration of CO and CO2, respectively [34,35]. The peaks and the corresponding adsorbed species are listed in Table 1 . It is clear that there are various active sites, including metallic Fe [36], Cu [35] and Fe2+, Fe3+ [32], Cu+ [37,38] sites, for CO adsorption over the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst. For the adsorption of CO on the metallic Fe and Cu sites, the wavenumber is always lower than that of the gaseous CO (2143cm−1), indicating that the C≡O bond is weakened. According to the model of CO adsorption over the metal surfaces by Blyholder [39], the carbon monoxide–metal bond is formed by a charge transfer from the HOMO of CO into an empty d orbital of the metal and an electron back-donation from metal into the unoccupied 2π* anti-bond orbital of CO. This back-donation to the CO anti-bond orbital weakens the C≡O bond and thus the absorption wavenumber of CO red-shifts. For the adsorption of CO on the oxides of Fe and Cu, the vibration frequency of C≡O bond depends on the coordination and electron status of the adsorption centers [40,41]. The absorption peak of CO2 appears at 473K, and strengthens rapidly as the temperature elevates, which suggests part CO is converted to CO2 over the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst. In the propagation of the carbon chain of alcohol and hydrocarbon products, the dissociation of CO to C* and O* is a crucial step. On the catalyst surface, the formed O* species oxidize CO to CO2 and C* species convert to CH2 with activated hydrogen, which accounts for the chain growth [42]. In addition, O* species can also oxidize metal, which is another pathway to form the metal ions–CO species on the reduced Fe–Cu based catalyst. The dissociation of CO is strongly dependent on the temperature, so the amount of CO2 increases rapidly when the temperature is increased. Similar phenomena are also observed on the Co–Cu based catalyst in the synthesis of alcohols from syngas [43]. Usually, it is known that the copper and iron compounds are active towards water–gas shift (WGS) reaction that is considered as the major path way for the formation of CO2 [44]. However, the DRIFTS results of CO adsorption reveal that the oxidation of CO* by O* species generated from the dissociation of CO* is another path way for the formation of CO2. Fig. 4 displays H2-TPD profile of the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst reduced at 653K. For comparison, samples without Fe or Cu component are also studied. H2-TPD profile of Cu based sample without Fe shows a desorption peak at 370K which corresponds to hydrogen desorption from Cu sites, while that of Fe based sample without Cu presents a broad peak in the region of 300–700K attributed to the hydrogen desorption from Fe sites. The H2-TPD profile of the Fe–Cu based catalyst displays two peaks at around 430K and 715K, which is ascribed to hydrogen desorption from the Cu sites and Fe sites, respectively. Obviously, the temperature of hydrogen desorption from the Fe–Cu based catalyst is higher than from the corresponding Cu or Fe based sample, indicating that the ability of Fe–Cu based catalyst for activation of H2 is higher and the stronger metal–hydrogen bonds are formed. For the Fe–Cu based sample, the Fe and Cu components are separated from each other and disperse better than the pure Fe- or Cu-based sample, so more unsaturated coordination metal centers are present and form strong bonds with H2 [45]. The higher ability for activation of H2 is helpful for promoting the catalytic activity. At the same time, the chain growth of C–C and the formation of longer chain products are restricted. In addition, the area of the two peaks at 430K and 715K is greatly lower than that of hydrogen desorption from Cu based and Fe based catalyst, respectively. In the Fe–Cu based catalyst, some new species, such as CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4, are difficult to be reduced and thus the amounts of the metallic Cu and Fe sites for hydrogen adsorption reduce."
8,DRIFTS investigation of TPSR,"3.4 DRIFTS investigation of TPSR In order to obtain the direct information on the reactions and better understand the reaction mechanism, DRIFTS investigation under 4.0MPa CO+H2 atmosphere was performed. Fig. 5 shows DRIFT spectra of TPSR from 323K to 673K, and the results of DRIFTS of CO+H2-TPSR are summarized in Table 2 . The weak bands at 1541, 1557, 1637, 1650, 1684 and 1698cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of M–H (M=Fe or Cu) species due to the dissociative activation of H2 [46,47], which are observed above 553K. The absorption bands at 2000–2250cm−1 corresponding to the vibration of CO and CO2 (not shown) are similar with those in DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption. The bands of CO and CO2 appear at 373K and 473K, respectively. It can be seen that the dissociative activation of H2 occurs at higher temperature than CO over the Fe–Cu based catalyst. The bands at 1487, 1508 and 1519cm−1 are assigned to bending vibration of double bond in M=CH2 species [47,48]. Meanwhile, the band at 3015cm−1 attributed to the anti-symmetric stretching vibration of CH2 in M=CH2 is also observed [47]. Moreover, the pretence of −CH3 and −CH2− is confirmed by the bands in the regions of 3100–2700cm−1 and 1600–1300cm−1. The species of hydrocarbon fragment are mainly generated on the metallic Fe centers due to their strong ability of activating CO dissociatively. Yamada et al. also observed the species of hydrocarbon fragment on the surface of Fe [39]. The weak band at 1339cm−1 is related to the species of M–CHO (v s CHO) [49–51]. The anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carbon–oxygen bands (v as OCO 1362, 1377cm−1 and v s OCO 1394, 1419cm−1) derive from the HCOO‾ adsorbed on the catalyst surface [47,52], which is generated via the hydrogenation of the adsorbed CO2. The bands at 1717, 1732, 1750 and 1767cm−1 are the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group connecting with different groups [53]. The bands at the region of 3550–3750cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of −OH of alcohol, intermediate species and catalyst surface [35,38]. The alcohol species is mainly formed on the metallic Cu centers because of their very low ability for CO dissociation [54,55]. It can also be seen from Fig. 5 that the bands according to intermediates including =CH2, −CHO, −OOCH, −OH and −C(=O)–R become apparent when the temperature is above 563K, which implies HAS reaction only occurs after the dissociative activation of H2 over the Fe–Cu based catalyst surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that the dissociative activation of H2 is the crucial step in HAS over the Fe–Cu based catalyst. The DRIFTS results of CO+H2-TPSR also reveal that HAS over Fe–Cu based catalyst is very complicated, where various intermediates exist."
9,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst is composed of Cu2O, CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 species. After reduction by syngas, the metallic Fe and Cu are the main components, but minor CuFeO2 and CuFe2O4 species are also present. Over the fused Fe–Cu based catalyst, the dissociative activation of H2 takes place on both Fe and Cu sites. However, the activation of CO occurs not only on the metal sites but also on the metal ion sites. During the activation of CO, the dissociation of CO to C* and O* species and the formation of CO2 are observed. In addition, the dissociative activation of H2 is more difficult than CO, and HAS reaction only occurs after the dissociative activation of H2. Therefore, it is very important to improve the ability of H2 activation of the catalyst, which is currently under investigation by the addition of noble metals, such as Pd, Ru, Rh and/or metallic carbides to the Fe–Cu based catalyst. Finally, The DRIFTS results of CO+H2-TPSR reveal that HAS over the Fe–Cu based catalyst is very complicated, where various intermediates including =CH2, −CHO, −OOCH, −OH and −C(=O)–R exist."
