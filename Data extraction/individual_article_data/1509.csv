0,Introduction,"An effective synthetic strategy in construction of CN and CC bonds, one of the most important tasks in organic synthesis, is to react N and C containing reagents with alkylating agents [1,2]. As compared with traditional alkylating agents like alkyl halides, alkyl tosylates, alkyl triflates and alkyl sulfonates etc., which contains easily leaving groups [3], the use of nontoxic and bulk available alcohols as alkylating agents is more attractive since such a reaction has high atom efficiency and produces water as the only byproduct, yet it is more challenging [4]. Ever since the pioneering work by Watanabe and Grigg reported the use of alcohols for the N-alkylation of amines [5,6], extensive research interest has been devoted to the direct use of alcohols in the alkylating reactions in the past two decades. A variety of homogeneous catalysts, mostly noble metal based complexes, as well as some metal nanoparticle doped heterogeneous catalysts, have been developed for alcohols-involved alkylating reactions [7–10]. Usually the homogeneous systems suffer from limited reusability and the indispensable use of the co-catalysts, while most of the heterogeneous systems are carried out in elevated temperature, in which over-alkylation sometimes occurs. The development of efficient heterogeneous catalytic systems for alcohols-involved alkylation reactions under mild conditions is highly desirable. Based on previous studies, transition metal catalyzed alcohols-involved alkylation reactions follows a hydrogen auto-transfer mechanism containing three consecutive catalytic steps: dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes, condensation between aldehydes and nucleophilic reagents (amines or ketones, etc.) to form corresponding intermediates, followed by hydrogenation of the intermediates to form the targeted alkylated products [11–13]. Multifunctional catalysts containing different catalytically active sites for these consecutive steps respectively can realize an efficient alkylation reaction in one pot. Currently, with an aim of developing renewable energy based processes, researchers are paying particular interest to light induced organic syntheses [14–18]. As a result, a variety of multifunctional MNPs/photocatalyst (MNPs = metal nanoparticles) nanocomposites, including MNPs/TiO2 (M = Pd, Au, Cu-Mo alloy) and M@MIL-100(Fe) (M = Pd and AuPd), have been applied for N-alkylation reactions by successful coupling of photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols to form aldehydes with the MNPs-based hydrogenation [19–24]. Hexagonal ZnIn2S4 is a stable semiconductor chalcogenide with a band gap corresponding to the visible light absorption [25]. Endowed with suitable band position, ZnIn2S4 has been extensively studied for photocatalytic H2 evolution, degradation of organic dyes as well as organic transformations [25–31]. In particular, since the top of the valance band of ZnIn2S4 locates at 1.37 eV vs NHE, the moderate oxidation potential of the holes prevents the synthesized organic compounds from being oxidized in an uncontrollable manner, which makes ZnIn2S4 to be promising photocatalyst for organic transformations. Actually, the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and amines over ZnIn2S4 have already been reported [32,33]. It is therefore anticipated that the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols to form aldehydes over ZnIn2S4 can be coupled with Pd-based hydrogenation to realize the tandem alkylation reactions between alcohols and nucleophilic agents. For this purpose, Pd nanoparticles with small size should be deposited on the surface of ZnIn2S4 since it is generally accepted that smaller Pd nanoparticles usually contain more active unsaturated Pd atoms. In the alkylation reactions, these active Pd sites abstract hydrogen from the alcohols to form Pd-H, which acts as the active species for the hydrogenation reaction [19]. Herein we reported the deposition of small sized Pd nanoparticles (ca. 6 nm) on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via a photoreduction process and the resultant Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites were used for light induced alkylation of amines and α-H of ketone. It was found that Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites are active for the alkylation reaction under visible light via a successful coupling of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols over ZnIn2S4 with Pd-based hydrogenation, with an optimum performance observed over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites. This work demonstrates an efficient way to realize the alkylation of amines and α-H of ketones and also highlights the great potential of construction of multifunctional catalysts for light induced organic syntheses."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparations,"2.1 Preparations All the reagents were commercial available and used without further purifications. Bis(acetonitrile)dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2) was prepared by refluxing PdCl2 in CH3CN according to literature [34]. ZnIn2S4 were synthesized from ZnCl2·6H2O and InCl3·4.5H2O in a mixed solvent of N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethylene glycol (EG) via a solvothermal process according to our previous report [25]. Pd nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via a photoreduction process and were denoted as x wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4, in which x was referred to the amount of Pd in the nanocomposites (x = 0.3, 0.5, 1.0). Take 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 for example, a mixture of ZnIn2S4 (200 mg) and Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 (1.63 mg) was dispersed in a mixed solution containing 0.5 ml TEOA and 3.5 ml acetonitrile (CH3CN). After degassed, the suspension was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 2 h. The resultant product was washed with ethanol and dried overnight at 60 °C in oven. For comparison, a chemical reduction process using NaBH4 as the reducing agent was also used in the preparation of 0.5 wt% Pd dispersed on ZnIn2S4 (denoted as 0.5 wt% Pd/ZnIn2S4)."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-obtained products were carried out on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD patterns were scanned over the angular range of 10-70° (2θ) with a step size of 0.02°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS system (PHI, USA) with a monochromatic Al K a source and a charge neutralizer. All the binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were measured by JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) of the powders were obtained with the BaSO4 used as a reflectance standard in the UV–visible diffuse reflectance experiment."
4,Catalytic reactions,"2.3 Catalytic reactions The light induced alkylation reactions were carried out in a sealed reaction tube with a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Beijing Perfect light, PLS-SXE300c). For the N-alkylation reactions, the catalyst (10 mg) and amines (0.2 mmol) were suspended in a solvent containing excess benzyl alcohol (2 mL). Before the reaction, the suspension was degassed and saturated with N2 to remove any dissolved O2. The reaction was performed under irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV-cut filter to remove all irradiation with wavelengths less than 420 nm and an IR-cut filter to remove all irradiation with wavelengths greater than 800 nm. After the reaction, the resultant suspension was filtered through a porous membrane (20 μm in diameter) and the filtrate was analyzed by GC–MS and GC-FID (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with an HP-5 capillary column. For the α-H alkylation of ketones, the catalyst (10 mg), acetophenone (0.2 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (0.1 mmol) were suspended in a solvent containing excess benzyl alcohol (2 mL)."
5,Results and discussion,"Hexagonal ZnIn2S4 was obtained solvothermally from ZnCl2 and InCl3 in a mixed solution of DMF and EG following the previously reported method [25]. Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites with different amount of Pd were prepared from the as-obtained ZnIn2S4 and Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 via a photoreduction process in the presence of TEOA. It was found that the color of the suspension changed gradually from the original yellow to deep brown during the light irradiation. The XRD patterns of the as-obtained product not only shows similar diffraction patterns, but also comparable intensity and full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the characteristic diffraction peaks, as that of bare ZnIn2S4, indicating that the integrity and crystallinity of ZnIn2S4 was maintained during the photoreduction process (Fig. 1 ). Although no characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Pd were observed, probably due to the low loading amount and their homogeneous dispersion in the sample, the XPS spectra of 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites confirms the presence of metallic Pd by showing two peaks at binding energy of 335.0 and 340.2 eV, assignable to Pd° 3d5/2 and Pd° 3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 2 ) [35]. The successful deposition of small-sized Pd nanoparticles is also evidenced from the TEM images of Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites (Fig. 3 ). The TEM image of 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites shows that it consists of flower-like microspheres with an average size of 6.0 μm, similar to that of bare ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 3a). An enlarged TEM image shows that each microsphere is comprised of large numbers of interwoven ultrathin nanosheets, with small nanoparticles in a size of ca. 6.0 nm evenly deposited on the surface of these ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 3b). In addition to lattice fringes of 0.322 nm, which belongs to (102) crystal plane of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 [36], the HRTEM image also shows clear lattice fringes of 0.224 nm, matches that of the (111) plane of face-centered cubic Pd (Fig. 3c) [23]. All these characterizations demonstrate that robust Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites with small-sized Pd nanoparticles deposited on ZnIn2S4 microspheres has been successfully obtained via the photoreduction process. It is proposed that the first step in the deposition of Pd nanoparticles on ZnIn2S4 is the adsorption of the positive Pd precursor [Pd(CH3CN)2]2+ on the negative charged S planes of ZnIn2S4 [37], as evidenced from a quick darken of yellow ZnIn2S4 when Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 was added into the suspension of ZnIn2S4. Since the bottom of the conduction band of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (-1.1 V vs NHE) is negative than the reduction potential of Pd(CH3CN)2 2+/Pd (0.24 V vs NHE, Supporting information Fig. S1), the photogenerated electrons on hexagonal ZnIn2S4 can reduce the surface adsorbed [Pd(CH3CN)2]2+ to form Pd nanoparticles, while the photogenerated holes left on the valence band can react with TEOA, the sacrificial agent to complete the photocatalytic cycle (Scheme 1 a). The adsorption of [Pd(CH3CN)2]2+ on the surface of ZnIn2S4 is the prerequisite for the formation of Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites with strong interaction between Pd nanoparticles and hexagonal ZnIn2S4, while the photoreduction can ensure a moderate reaction condition to produce the evenly deposited Pd with small size. As compared with bare ZnIn2S4, the UV–vis DRS spectrum of 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites shows slightly enhanced absorption in the 200–600 nm region, due to the introduction of Pd nanoparticles (Fig. 4 ). To study the catalytic performance of the as-prepared Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites for alkylation reactions with alcohols under visible light irradiation, the reaction between benzyl alcohol (1a) and aniline (2a) was first chosen as a model reaction. The reaction was initially carried out in excess benzyl alcohol as solvent over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites. It was found that 47% of aniline was converted after irradiated for 18 h, with a selectivity of 31% to the desired alkylation product N-benzylaniline (3a). N-benzylideneaniline (3b) and benzaldehyde as the intermediates are the main byproducts, but no over-alkylated tertiary amine was detected (Table 1 , entry 1). Only 9% of aniline was converted over bare ZnIn2S4 under similar condition, with the main product obtained to be 3b (7%) (Table 1, entry 2), indicating that Pd is essential for the transformation of the intermediate 3b to the desired alkylating product 3a. Almost negligible aniline was converted either in absence of 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 or without visible light (Table 1, entries 3–4). The filtrate reaction revealed that no further reaction occurred after 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 was removed from the reaction system after reacting for 18 h (Table 1, entry 5). These results demonstrated that the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol is truly induced by visible light induced catalysis over Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites. To study the effect of the solvents on the catalytic performance, a mixed solvent containing CH3CN, DMF, H2O and toluene respectively, in 1:1 vol ratio to benzyl alcohol, were used for the N-alkylation of aniline (Table 1, entries 6–9). Among all the four solvents investigated, CH3CN was found to be the best solvent by showing a slightly enhanced conversion of aniline at 57%, but a relatively lower yield of 24% to the desired 3a after irradiated for 18 h. This indicates that the introduction of CH3CN improves the aniline conversion, yet it is disadvantage for the transformation of 3b to the desired alkylating product 3a. The decrease of the ratio of CH3CN to benzyl alcohol in the mixed solvent led to an improved aniline conversion as well as enhanced yield to the desired 3a (Table 1, entries 10–11). An optimum aniline conversion of 82% and a yield of 73% to the desired 3a can be achieved after being irradiated for 18 h in a mixed medium with CH3CN and benzyl alcohol in a volume ratio of 1: 9. A prolonged reaction time to 24 h in this system led to an almost quantitative transformation of aniline (99%) with an superior yield of 93% to 3a (Table 1, entry12). In addition, Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites showed high stability for the light induced N-alkylation of aniline reaction. No obvious loss of the activity was observed after three cycling tests and the catalyst after three runs showed similar XRD patterns (Fig. 5 and Supporting Fig. S2a). No re-construction of Pd nanoparticles occurs during the reaction since Pd nanoparticles after the reaction show almost unchanged morphology as evidenced from the TEM image (Supporting information Fig. S2b). The time-dependent conversion of aniline and the formation of the products over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 in a mixed solvent of CH3CN: benzyl alcohol (1:9) was shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that the amount of the desired alkylating product 3a and benzaldehyde increased with the irradiation time. However, the amount of 3b increased first, but decreased after 3 h, suggesting the transformation of 3b to 3a during the reaction process. This result confirms that the reaction between aniline and benzyl alcohol to produce 3a over irradiated Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites also proceeds through 3b as an intermediate, in consistent with our previous studies on the N-alkylation of amine over Pd@MIL-100(Fe) [23]. The mechanism for the light induced N-alkylation of aniline by benzyl alcohol over Pd-ZnIn2S4 can therefore be proposed (Scheme 1b). ZnIn2S4 can be excited by visible light to generated electrons and holes. The photogenerated electrons are transferred from ZnIn2S4 to Pd nanoparticles to form electron-rich Pd species (step 1) [38], while the surface adsorbed benzyl alcohol reacts with the photogenerated holes, leading to the formation of an alkoxide intermediate (step 2). The further cleavage of the CH bond in the alkoxide intermediate leads to the formation of benzaldehyde, with the hydrogen transferred to the electron-rich Pd to generate Pd hydride (step 3). Similar light induced oxidant-free production of benzaldehyde from the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol has been documented previously [39,40]. The condensation between the in-situ generated benzaldehyde and the aniline can be promoted by the Lewis acidic sites in Pd-ZnIn2S4 to produce 3b as the intermediate (step 4). Finally a further hydrogenation of 3b catalyzed by the active Pd hydride generates N-alkylating product 3a (step 5). An efficient N-alkylation of aniline can be realized by synchronizing the rates of the above tandem/cascade steps. In the N-alkylation of aniline reaction, the rate for photocatalytic dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol depends on ZnIn2S4 based photocatalysis, which can be influenced by the deposited Pd nanoparticles since Pd nanoparticles are good electron traps and can help to promote the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers in ZnIn2S4. In addition, the cleavage of CH bond in alkoxide intermediate promoted by Pd nanoparticles is important for the formation of benzaldehyde [19]. Moreover, the hydrogenation of the intermediate 3b, which formed via the condensation between benzaldehyde and aniline, is catalyzed by the active Pd hydride. Therefore, by varying the amount of deposited Pd and modifying its existing state, it is possible to tune the reaction rates of different steps to optimize the whole N-alkylation reaction. Actually, it was found that although the conversion of aniline remains almost unchanged (84%) when the amount of Pd was decreased to 0.3 wt%, the yield to the desired alkylating product 3a decreased from 73% to 51%, implying a lower of the rate for the hydrogenation of 3b to produce 3a (Table 1, entry 13). However, when the amount of Pd was increased to 1.0 wt%, both the conversion of aniline (69%) and the production of benzaldehyde (74 μmol) decreased slightly as compared with those in 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 (82% and 93 μmol respectively), probably due to a shading effect since the deposited Pd nanoparticles would cover the active site of ZnIn2S4 (Table 1, entry 14). In addition, 0.5 wt% Pd/ZnIn2S4 obtained via a chemical reduction process using NaBH4 as reducing agent was also used for N-alkylation of aniline reaction. The TEM and HRTEM images of 0.5 wt% Pd/ZnIn2S4 show larger Pd nanoparticles of ca. 8.0 nm are deposited on ZnIn2S4 microspheres (Supporting information Fig. S3). Although chemical reduced 0.5 wt%Pd-ZnIn2S4 show a comparable conversion of aniline (78%), the yield to the desired alkylating product 3a is lower (55%) as compared with that over photo-reduced 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 (Table 1 entry 15). The higher selectivity to the desired N-alkylation product 3a over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 may be ascribed to the smaller Pd nanoparticles, which contain more active unsaturated Pd atoms than those obtained via NaBH4 reduction. The N-alkylation of amines with alcohols to generate N-alkylated amines over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites can also be applied to a wide substrate scopes (Table 2 ). Different functional group substituted anilines can be transformed to the corresponding N-alkyl anilines, but with different yields. As compare with bare aniline, anilines with electron-withdrawing groups such as p–Cl exhibited obviously increased yield to targeted N-alkyl amine (99%), while aniline with electron-donating substituents, such as p−OCH3 or p−CH3, showed decreased yields to N-alky amines (20–71%) (Table 2, entries 1–3), suggesting the existence of an electronic effect. Similarly, the reactions between benzyl alcohols with different substituents and aniline proceeded with medium to high conversion ratios of aniline (45–82%) and reasonable yields of N-alkyl amines (26–81%) after irradiation for 18 h over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites (Table 2, entries 5–7). The scope of the substrates can also be expanded to a wide range of amines as well as aliphatic alcohols, although lower performance is observed over the later (Table 2, entries 8–13). Since the alkylation of α-H of ketones with alcohols also proceeds via a similar hydrogen auto-transfer mechanism [41–44], Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites were also applied for the alkylation of α-H of ketone. The reaction between the benzyl alcohol and acetophenone (7a) was chosen as a model reaction. It was found that the α-H alkylated product 3-phenylpropiophenone (8a) was obtained with intermediates chalcone (8b) and benzaldehyde as the main byproducts. Both bases and the reaction medium influenced the catalytic performance. Especially, since base can promote the dehydrogenation of ketones' α-H to form enolate, the base influences significantly the conversion of the ketone and the yield to the targeted alkylated product (Table 3 , entries 1–9). An optimum performance with a conversion of acetophenone at 81% and a yield of 71% to 8a was obtained when the reaction was carried out in a mixed solvent containing benzyl alcohol and ethanol in a volume ratio of 4:1 with the presence of Cs2CO3 (Table 3, entry 6). This reaction can also be expanded to aliphatic alcohols, like furfuralcohol and phenylethanol, although with a low conversion (Table 3, entries 10–11)."
6,Conclusion,"In summary, Pd-ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites with small Pd nanoparticles of an average size of 6.0 nm were successfully obtained via photoreduction of Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 over ZnIn2S4 and were used for visible light induced alkylation of amines and α-H of ketones with alcohols to construct CN and CC bonds. By synchronization of the rates of different reaction steps in the tandem alkylation reaction, an optimum performance was realized over 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4. Ascribable to the small sized Pd nanoparticles to provide more unsaturated active unsaturated Pd atoms, 0.5 wt% Pd-ZnIn2S4 show superior performance as compared to 0.5 wt% Pd/ZnIn2S4 obtained via a chemical reduction using NaBH4. This study provides an efficient way to realize a highly efficient and stable alkylation of amines and α-H of ketones via a successful coupling of the visible light semiconductor-based photocatalysis and Pd NPs-based hydrogenation. This study also highlights the great potential of construction of multifunctional photocatalysts for light induced organic syntheses."
