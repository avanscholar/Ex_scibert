0,Introduction,"In the 20th century, the increasing world population and industrialization have caused a great rise in fossil-fuel consumption. New technology, tools and equipment developed with industrialization provided many benefits for vital activities. However, increasing fossil-fuel consumption to meet the energy needs of these technological tools causes some economic and environmental problems. Fossil fuels based on petroleum (such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas) are not sustainable. It is thought to have limited reserves. In addition, emissions to the atmosphere during production and use of these fuels cause environmental problems such as acid rain, air pollution and greenhouse-gas. Moreover, the economies of countries that are dependent on foreign sources of fossil fuel are adversely affected due to increasing energy consumption. For decreasing dependency to oil, avoiding an oil crisis with a minimum drawback for future and harmful effects for environment, researching alternative fuels and usable of these fuels in internal-combustion engines have become a mandatory. For this reason, studies that have been carried out in order to get requested power in the internal-combustion engines under different structural and operating conditions with the most economical and least harm to the environment have accelerated. Alcohols, liquefied petroleum gas, biodiesel and natural gas are alternative fuels that can be used in internal-combustion engines in certain proportions. Efficient use of existing energy resources is of great importance in terms of reducing dependence on oil and contributing to the maintenance of ecological balance. In order for alternative fuels to be preferred, unit prices should be cheap, they should be produced from domestic sources, they should be used with minimum changes in existing fuel equipment in vehicles, and they should not have a significant decrease in engine performance, and their emissions should be low [1]. Alcohols used as alternative fuel in the SI engines are methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. It is possible to list advantages of the alcohols which are alternative-fuel types as follows: • Alcohols can replace fuels from crude oil, • Countries without crude oil reserves can meet their energy needs without being dependent on oil, • Alcohol production (especially ethanol) can be a good source of income for farmers in countries with broad agricultural opportunities, • Alcohols have a high-octane number, which increases knock resistance of the fuel. In this case, engine performance can be increased by increasing the compression ratios in engines [2]. The aims of this literature review study are to determine the experimental studies on the changes in performance, emission and combustion characteristics in the case of using alcohol fuel in spark ignition engines, examine these studies in detail and determine optimum alcohol fuels used in these studies by tables and charts. In this study, usage of alcohols as alternative fuels in the SI engines was investigated in the literature. It is aimed to present changes in engine parameters such as performance (brake thermal efficiency, torque, brake power, volumetric efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption), emission (HC, CO, CO 2 and NO x ) and combustion (in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and exhaust gas temperature) of these alternative fuels. In addition, the differences in the results summarized by tables and figures are discussed in terms of experimental variables and methods, fuel type, etc."
1,Alcohol fuels,"1.1 Alcohol fuels The chemical formulas of alcohols are C n H 2n+2 O . Alcohols are used in food, cleaning, cosmetic and paint industries and used directly in internal combustion engines or mixed into engine fuels in certain proportions [3]. Although alcohol and gasoline are of different chemical classes, they are quite similar. Gasoline is a type of fuel that contains many hydrocarbon compounds. Hydrocarbon is the general name for chemical compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms. There are many hydrocarbon compounds such as aliphatic, aromatic and alicyclic. Alcohols can be referred to as HC where one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by a “hydroxyl group” consisting of a hydrogen atom attached to an oxygen atom [4]. Today, common alcohol fuels used in the internal combustion engines are methanol ( C H 3 OH ), ethanol ( C 2 H 5 OH), propanol ( C 3 H 7 OH) and butanol ( C 4 H 9 OH). Table 1 lists the physiochemical properties of gasoline and these alcohols. Alcohol fuels can be used in SI engines in pure form or mixed with gasoline. It is necessary to make some changes in the engine and fuel system in order to use pure and high ratio of alcohol. However, a low ratio of alcohol / gasoline mixture can be used without any modification of the engine [6]. Alcohols can be used as fuel in engines with different systems and techniques: • Mixing engine fuels into certain proportions: In this method, alcohols are used by mixing volumetric or mass into engine fuels. While there is no need to change the engine for use of low ratio mixture, some modification must be made in high ratio mixture. The addition of high ratio of alcohol to engine fuels causes phase separation. It is observed that other chemicals are added in certain ratios to prevent phase separation. It is also seen that addition of different amounts of heavy alcohols into engine fuels increases the thermodynamic activation of fuels [3]. • Use by spraying or vaporizing the intake manifold: This is addition of alcohol in form of vapor or spray in addition to the engine fuel to intake manifold, such as by using alcohol directly from intake manifold. The high latent heat of vaporization values of alcohols reduces the density of air by absorbing heat around it while evaporating in intake manifold. This causes more air to enter intake manifold and increases volumetric efficiency. In this method, the spraying of alcohols and vaporization according to the increasing cycle also constitutes a hardware and cost. Again, because the high-water retention of alcohols causes corrosion, intake manifolds must be made of non-corroded materials [3]. • Alcohol and engine fuels are mixed in a mixer and sent to the engine in certain proportions: In this type of use there are two different tanks of engines for alcohol and engine fuels. Alcohol and engine fuels from these two tanks are sent to the engine by mixing in certain proportions with the help of a mixer. In such systems, it is difficult to adjust the fuels according to increasing engine speed and to measure specific fuel consumption. Sudden mixing of alcohols with engine fuels also causes the mixture not to mix completely. It is a high cost system [3]. • Use of a separate injection system for each fuel: In such systems, a separate injection system is created for alcohol and engine fuels, and both fuels are sprayed into cylinder. The need for a drastic change in such systems increases the cost. In addition, the complexity of system increases and the control becomes more difficult in the engines equipped with simple equipment [3]. 1.1.1 Methanol Chemical formula of methanol is C H 3 OH . It is a colorless, organic liquid at room temperature and pressure. Methanol can be obtained by heat distillation of fossil fuels, such as wood and coal, containing methyl alcohol, by applying some distillation processes to natural gas, or as a result of synthesis of CO and hydrogen in catalytic media [7]. When methanol is used as a fuel, necessary precautions should be taken. Because of its high volatility, methanol can easily burn in the air. Methanol vapor can also be explosive in some environments. Being a toxic chemical can cause permanent blindness and even death in humans. Methanol can form a flammable solution which can be mixed with water in any ratio [8]. Today, methanol fuel is considered a valid green fuel for internal combustion engines thanks to its low emissions and its ability to produce C O 2 -neutrally. When methanol is used as fuel, the compression ratio of the engine geometry can be significantly increased. This is because a higher-octane number allows a significant increase in the compression ratio and higher latent heat of vaporization increases the volumetric efficiency [9]. If a 3%−15% methanol blends are used, materials of the fuel system (plastics) that are in direct contact with methanol must be adapted. Pure methanol was initially unsuitable for use in the vehicles as low vapor pressure caused cold start problems. Therefore, 10–15% by volume of gasoline was added to methanol. In order to use the fuel characteristics of the M85 optimally, changes to the existing engine structure are required [10]. 1.1.2 Ethanol It is the second simplest alcohol with the chemical formula C 2 H 5 OH and a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid. Ethanol produced from biomass can be completely biodegradable and renewable. The large-scale biomass-ethanol industry mostly uses sugar cane or sugar beet juice, corn or wheat. Ethanol is also produced commercially in the pulp and paper industry as a by-product. Lignocellulosic biomass is envisaged to provide a significant proportion of raw materials for bio-ethanol production in the medium and long term due to its low cost and high availability [11]. A sample flow chart of fermentation technology used for bioethanol production from biomass is given in Fig. 1 . 5% Ethanol- 95% Gasoline mixture (E5) and 10% Ethanol- 90% Gasoline mixture (E10) are on market all over world and are generally compatible with existing SI engines. The observed problems are related to old vehicles. These problems are mainly related to corrosion in the fuel lines, swelling and cracking of rubber or plastic parts in the fuel line, and cold starting of the engine [13]. 1.1.3 Propanol Due to concerns about depletion of fossil reserves, several sustainable ways to produce this alcohol have been developed. Propanol can be produced from raw materials such as biomass or municipal solid waste. These raw materials are gasified to the synthesis gas (CO, H 2 , CO 2 ). In addition, microbial propanol production from Clostridium species, threonine catabolism or beer fermentation from yeast was produced in very small amounts of less than 70 mg/L. Naturally, there are no microorganisms capable of producing propanol from large amounts of glucose. Thus, researchers have turned to biosynthetic pathways to produce industrially relevant amounts of propanol from Escherichia coli, a microorganism that can be easily manipulated relative to conventional complex Clostridium species [14]. Alcohols with the same closed formula and different open-chain formula are called isomeric alcohols. The isomer of propanol is iso-propanol and its chemical formula is shown in Fig. 2 . 1.1.4 Butanol Butanol is a colorless and flammable alcohol with four carbon straight chains. It can be mixed with butanol, ethanol, ether and other organic solvent. Butanol can be used as a chemical intermediate in cosmetic, hydraulic fluids, detergent formulations, drugs, antibiotics, hormones and vitamins, butyl acrylate and methacrylate, and additionally as an additional solvent in pharmaceutical production. Butanol has a 4-carbon structure and the carbon atoms can form a straight-chain or branched structure having different properties. There are different isomers (n-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol, tert-butanol) depending on the position of OH and carbon chain structure. Although properties of butanol isomers differ in their octane number, boiling point, viscosity, etc., the main applications are similar in some aspects, such as being used as solvents, industrial cleaners or gasoline additives. All these butanol isomers can be produced by different methods by fossil fuels [15].The isomer of butanol is iso-butanol and its chemical formula is shown in Fig. 3 . The production of n-butanol is lower than ethanol and the price of n-butanol is higher than that of ethanol. In recent years, however, efficient and economical bio-butanol production techniques have been developed. Thus, as n-butanol production increases, cost is expected to become more competitive. Butanol can be produced from biomass and mixed with gasoline or used on its own for use in SI engines [16]."
2,Effects of alcohols on engine parameters,"In this section, performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics of SI engines using ethanol, methanol, iso-butanol and propanol as alternative fuels are examined. Some studies using these alcohols as pure or mixture have been examined in the literature. Some results of engine parameters are summarized in tables and figures, and discussed. It is seen that alcohols are used in different mixing ratios in literature. Therefore, it was preferred to evaluate the effects of alcohols on engine parameters under three different groups with a low mixture ratio, a high mixture ratio and pure. In this study, while the mixture up to 30% alcohol in the mixture was named as the low mixture ratio, those between 31% and 99% were considered as the high mixture ratio."
3,Performance parameters,"2.1 Performance parameters In the literature, there are many studies on the investigation of different types of alcohol as fuel in SI engines. In these studies, the effects of alcohols on motor performance in different test conditions were determined. The engine performance results obtained from some studies in the literature are summarized in Table 2 . 2.1.1 Brake thermal efficiency As it is seen from the literature summaries given in Table 2, alcohol fuels are used in SI engines by creating pure or mixture. Percentage changes of BTE obtained from experiments performed under different test conditions compared to gasoline are presented. The effects of using different types of alcohol at low mixture ratios on BTE in literature are examined as follows. In an experimental study by Li et al., it was found that BTE increased by 4.3% compared to gasoline with the use of iPBE30, which is mixed with 30 vol% (iso-propanol + n-butanol + ethanol) to that gasoline. This increase was achieved at equivalence ratio of 0.83 and engine load of 500 MPa. The reason of this situation is increasing isentropic efficiency as a result of decreasing heat loss. In addition, increased combustion temperatures at high engine loads was reported to increase BTE [32]. In another study, low rates of methanol + iso-butanol mixtures were used in an SI engine as fuel by blending with gasoline. The tests were carried out on a four-cylinder engine with a 1600 cc cylinder volume. In experiments with four different alcohol mixtures determined as M5, M5B5, M5B10 and M5B15 (which is 5% methanol + 15% iso-butanol + 80% gasoline), BTE increased at all engine speeds compared to gasoline. This increase was realized in average, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.5% for all engine speeds with M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15, respectively [25]. Deng et al. conducted experiments at different engine speeds in an SI engine fueled by pure gasoline (G) and gasoline blends with 10 vol% and 20 vol% hydrous ethanol containing 5 vol% water (E10W and E20W). In general, it was found that BTE increased with the addition of a low proportion of alcohol for all engine speeds. The increases in BTE value by using E10W and E20W were 1% and 3%, respectively, compared to gasoline [17]. Yusoff et al. tested pure gasoline, E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5, E10iB10 (e.g.: 10% ethanol + 10% iso-butanol + 80% gasoline) fuel blends in a four-cylinder SI engine. It is found that ethanol-containing fuels showed higher BTE values than iso-butanol-containing fuels. It is stated that the increase in combustion efficiency due to the oxygen content of ethanol causes an increase in BTE. In addition, ethanol-containing fuels have taller BTE values compared to iso-butanol-containing fuels, because latent heat of vaporization of ethanol is higher than that of iso-butanol. When all load conditions are taken into consideration, an increments of BTE values for E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 fuels are 8.01%, 13.61%, 5.54%, 6.45%, 7.97% and 8.35%, respectively, compared to gasoline [18]. Gupta et al. found that the pressure and temperature inside the cylinder raised with the increasing engine load in the use of E5 fuel. This situation is shown as the main reason for the rise in BTE. BTE value increased 0.14% on average, compared to gasoline by using E5 fuel [20]. Li et al. used ethanol, methanol and iso-butanol alcohols as fuel by blending with different proportions in an SI engine having port fuel injection. Each type of alcohol was blended with gasoline at the ratio of 10, 20 and 30%. When M10, M30, E10, E30, iB10 and iB30 were used, BTE values decreased by 1.95%, 1.76%, 2.09%, 1.35%, 2.16% and 1.8%,respectively, compared to gasoline [22]. In a study by Akansu et al, it added volumetric 20% ethanol (E20) to gasoline, and was used as fuel in a large-volume SI engine having a common rail fuel system. In experiments carried out at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm, it was found that BTE obtained with the use of E20 at 50% and 100% engine load decreased by 1.94% and 5.16%, respectively, compared to gasoline. It was stated that this decrease was caused by the decline of the energy density of the fuel together with ethanol added to the gasoline [23]. Sayin and Balki added 10%, 20 and 30% (iB10, iB20 and iB30) iso-butanol in gasoline, and this mixture used as fuel in an SI engine. In experiments conducted at different compression ratios (CR), it was stated that BTE increased by the addition of iso-butanol into gasoline for all CRs. Compared to gasoline, the maximum increased in BTE value by using iB10, iB20 and iB30 were 0.8%, 1.9%, and 3.5%, respectively [39]. In another study, E0 and E15 are used as fuel, and is found that E15 is provided a higher BTE than gasoline. Since the oxygen content of ethanol improves combustion, it has been stated to increase thermal efficiency. Considering all speed conditions, average BTE value of E15 increased by 0.68% compared to that of gasoline [40]. Agarwal et al. added 10 and 20% methanol in gasoline (M10 and M20), and investigated the effects of these mixtures on engine performance. It is stated that BTE value obtained with M10 and M20 fuels is higher compared to gasoline. As a reason of this situation, it was emphasized that laminar flame speed of methanol was higher than that of gasoline. Thus, rapid and complete combustion occurred in cylinder by reducing heat loss from cylinder walls, as well as oxygen content of methanol allowed for a better combustion process. BTE values, at 2500 rpm and all load conditions, increased by 3% and 6% respectively, on average, compared to gasoline using M10 and M20 [44]. In another study, the use of alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, propanol and butanol alcohol as fuel in an SI engine were investigated. These alcohols were mixed in gasoline by 20%, and each mixture is named as E20, M20, P20 and B20. It is stated that BTE increases because the oxygen content of alcohol fuels improves combustion. It also causes more air to be drawn in by mass, as fuels containing alcohol absorb heat from the cylinder for evaporation as a result of higher latent evaporation heat. This situation leads to an increase in BTE since it increases the compression pressure. Mean BTE values increased by 2.15%, 3.6%, 0.7% and 1.86%, respectively, compared to gasoline, using E20, M20, P20 and B20 blends [46]. Farkade and Pathre tested pure gasoline, 10%, 20% and 30% methanol, ethanol and butanol-gasoline blend in a single-cylinder SI engine. Each mixture is named as M10, M20, M30, E10, E20, E30, B10, B20 and B30. According to the results obtained, the highest BTE value of M10 fuel is higher than that of gasoline. However, BTE values of these fuels were lower than those of gasoline due to lower heating value although M20 and M30 fuels had oxygen content. In addition, BTE value of E10 fuel was higher than M10 due to higher heating value of ethanol. Despite lower oxygen content of butanol, higher heating values than methanol and ethanol led to higher BTE values by these blended fuels. It increased by 0.5%, 2.8% and 4% using M10, E10 and B20, compared to gasoline while BTE value decreased by 1.5%, 1.7%, 2.8%, 8.5% and 4% with M20, M30, E20, E30 and B30 compared to gasoline, respectively [49]. Eyidogan et al. carried out experiments using pure gasoline, E5, E10, M5 and M10 fuels in a four-cylinder, multi-point injection SI engine. BTE value of all fuels increased due to the decreasing of BSFC. At an engine speed of 80 km/h, M5, M10 and E10 fuels showed higher BTE values than E5. This was because alcohols had higher oxygen content, so this factor provided better combustion. Furthermore, increasing latent heat of vaporization value by increasing alcohol content in the mixture showed that evaporation continued at compression phase and that heat was absorbed from the cylinders, which reduced loss of work required to compress air–fuel mixture. By using M5, M10 and E10 at 80 km/h engine speed, average BTE values increased by 2.2%, 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively, compared to gasoline, but this value decreased by 0.8% when E5 was used. When M5, M10, E5 and E10 were used at 100 km/h engine speed, BTE values increased by 1.8%, 4.7%, 1.9% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [54]. In another study, M3, M5, M10 and M15 mixture fuels were used. The average BTE values of M3, M5, M10 and M15 increased by 8%, 22.72%, 28.57% and 42.1%, respectively, compared to M0 [58]. In another experimental study, it was used M5, M10, M15 and M20 fuels. As the methanol content increased, BTE value increased due to increase of combustion efficiency as a result of oxygen content in the methanol. Furthermore, it was stated that BTE value decreased due to anti-knock value of gasoline. In addition, it was determined that BTE raised with increasing CR due to the high-octane number of methanol. BTE values obtained from M5, M10, M15 and M20 fuels were, respectively, increased by 1.5%, 2.5%, 3.4% and 3.9% compared to gasoline [59]. Thomas et al. stated that BTE and BP increased the use of B20 fuel at a high CR. The increase in BTE value compared to gasoline by using B20 blend was calculated to be about 4% [63]. In a study carried out on a multi-injection, single-cylinder SI engine using iP0, iP10, iP20 and iP30 fuels, as iso-propanol content increased in fuel blend, BTE value increased as a result of oxygen content in iso-propanol. It was also stated that the heat requirement about two times more than gasoline to vaporize iP fuel caused it to absorb more heat from the cylinder. As a result, it was stated that heat loss decreased and BTE value increased when iP content in the fuel increased. BTE values obtained from iP10, iP20 and iP30 at 1400 rpm increased by 10.3%, 21.01% and 29.95% compared to gasoline while BTE value at 2800 rpm raised 8.05%, 14.5% and 19.65%, separately [65]. In the literature, alcohols have also been investigated with high mixing ratio and purity. Li et al used each of ethanol, methanol and iso-butanol by mixing 60% in gasoline separately. It was stated that increasing the alcohol content in the mixture increased the loss of work in the compression phase due to the prolongation of the combustion phase. As a result, BTE value decreased. When M60, E60 and iB60 were used, average BTE values decreased by 0.93%, 2.5% and 0.76%, respectively, compared to gasoline [22]. Renzi et al. found that when the E0, E50 and E80 mixing fuels are used in an SI engine, E50 fuel has higher BTE value than other fuels. It was stated that the air / fuel ratio being close to the stoichiometric ratio caused this situation. It is observed that BTE decreases with the use of E80. The reason for this was the reduction of effective power as a result of poor combustion [28]. Balki and Sayin used pure ethanol and methanol as fuel in an air-cooled SI engine. According to experimental results, it was stated that BTE increased slightly compared to gasoline. When pure ethanol and methanol were used, average BTE values increased by 0.49% and 0.74%, respectively, compared to gasoline [45]. Çelik et al found that the BTE value for M100 fuel is higher than gasoline in a single cylinder SI engine fueled by M0 and M100 fuels. It is also stated that methanol has a high latent evaporation temperature and absorbs more heat from the cylinder during evaporation during the compression process. According to the experimental results performed at different CRs, it was determined that the BTE value obtained from the M100 increased by 2.9, 8.1 and 11.1%, respectively, in CRs of 6: 1, 8: 1 and 10: 1 [50]. In an experimental study using E22 and E100W fuels on a four cylinder and injection SI engine, it was observed that pure ethanol fuel (E100W) containing water produced a higher BTE value than E22 fuel. When the E100W is used, the burning time is shortened, and the ignition is shorter, as a result of which the flame front is formed in a shorter time. Thus, it causes the BTE to increase because of the heat loss in the cylinder walls decreases. By using E100W, BTE value increased by 14.1% compared to E22 [53]. In some studies in the literature, the percentage changes of BTE values obtained from different fuel types relative to gasoline are shown in Fig. 4 . When the graph is analyzed, it is observed that BTE increases with alcohol/gasoline mixtures in general. It was determined that the increase rate in BTE is concentrated between 0.5% and 8%. In general, researchers cited the oxygen content, high latent evaporation temperature and high-octane number of alcohols as the reason for the increase in BTE. When Table 2 and Fig. 4 are examined together, it is seen that BTE decreases in some studies against the general upward trend in BTE. It was determined that the highest reduction was realized with E60 fuel at the rate of 2.5% [22]. The difference of these studies, which are seen to decrease, is that the experiment is carried out with chassis dynamometer [54], different air/fuel ratios [22], differences in the fuel system, and experiments depending on the load [49]. In addition, the limited reduction in BTE is thought to be due to measurement uncertainty, cylinder volume of the engine, type of cooling system. The BTE value obtained from some studies [58,65] seems to be excessive compared to other studies, as in Fig. 4. This is thought to be due to air / fuel ratio as a possible cause. Furthermore, measurement uncertainties may have been influential in this excessive rise. 2.1.2 Torque The torque changes obtained from alcohol-containing fuels under different test conditions from some studies in the literature are shown in Table 2. If the results of the torque are examined according to the alcohol content in the fuel, the researches with low mixture rates are as follows. Elfasakhany tested two types of ternary fuel blends, namely n-butanol + bio-ethanol + gasoline (nBE) and iso-butanol + bio-methanol + gasoline (iBM), in an SI engine, with different types of alcohol added to the gasoline at 3, 7 and 10%. The energy content of mixture fuels is lower compared to gasoline. In addition, the higher latent evaporation heat of the fuel mixes has a reducing effect on the T value. However, it can significantly increase the T value since the higher oxygen content improves combustion, Accordingly, since the effect of reducing the T value is more dominant, it is stated that the overall T value decreases in all engine speeds compared to gasoline. T values decreased by 0.5% and 2%, respectively, by using iBM and nBE mixtures compared to pure gasoline [19]. Yusoff et al. tested pure gasoline, E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5, E10iB10 fuel blends in a four-cylinder SI engine. The value of VE increased due to high latent heat of vaporization of fuels containing ethanol and butanol. In addition, oxygen content of alcohol fuels positively affected combustion quality. Due to these reasons, T values showed an upward trend. Considering all load conditions, T values for E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 decreased by 2.33%, 3.88%, 2.56%, 3.06%, 1.06% and 3.77%, respectively, compared to gasoline [68]. Deng et al. stated that E10W and E20W fuels produce higher T values than gasoline. After adding hydrous ethanol to the gasoline, the latent heat of vaporization of the mixture fuel becomes much higher. In this case, it can absorb more heat through the cylinders and lower the intake air temperature. As a result, it was stated that the T value increased due to the rise in volumetric efficiency. The maximum T values obtained by using E0, E10W and E20W are 125 Nm, 131 Nm and 128 Nm, respectively [17]. Doğan et al. used E0, E10, E20 and E30 fuels in a single point injection four-cylinder SI engine. According to the experimental results, it was shown that T value decreased by increasing ethanol content in the blend. The average T values of E10, E20 and E30 were 2%, 3% and 5% less than that of E0, respectively [24]. Elfasakhany investigated that effect of using dual alcohols (iso-butanol and n-butanol) blended into gasoline fuel on an SI engine performance and exhaust emissions. Dual alcohol mixtures in the ratios of 3, 7 and 10% were added to the gasoline by volume. There are equal amounts of n-butanol and iso-butanol in the mixture. For example; 3.5% n-butanol + 3.5% iso-butanol + 93% gasoline mixture was named as niB7. It was determined that T value obtained from experiments with niB3, niB7 and niB10 mixture fuels was lower than gasoline. The reason for this is that the thermal value of iso-butanol is 23% lower than that of gasoline. Considering all speed conditions, by using niB3, niB7, niB10 blends, mean T values decreased by 3.6%, 4% and 2.1%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [29]. In another study, n-butanol – methanol – gasoline mixtures were used as fuel in an SI engine. Test fuels were obtained by adding a volume of 3, 7 and 10% n-butanol + methanol, which was prepared equally, into the gasoline by volume. These fuels are named as nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10. At all engine speeds, it was observed that T value obtained from mixture fuels remained low compared to gasoline. In addition, as the alcohol content in the mixture fuel increased, the T value increased compared to the low ratio mixture. When nBM3, iBM7 and iBM10 blend were used, T values decreased by 3.83%, 3.19% and 2.55%, respectively, compared to gasoline [34]. Elfasakhany compared three different fuel mixtures consisting of ethanol + methanol + gasoline (EM), n-utanol + iso-butanol + gasoline (niB) and iso-butanol + ethanol + gasoline (iBE) in terms of engine performance. The total alcohol content in each mixture fuel was taken as 3, 5 and 7%, and nine different test fuels were used in the experiments. In general, it is determined that, while the value of T increases with the use of EM at all engine speeds compared to gasoline, it decreases with niB and iBE. EM mixture fuel has higher latent evaporation heat and oxygen ratio compared to other fuels. It was stated that this was the reason for the increase in T value [35]. Masum et al reported that the use of blended fuel with 15% ethanol (E15) increased T value compared to gasoline. The octane number of the fuel in the addition of ethanol increases the latent evaporation temperature and oxygen ratio. It was stated that this situation was effective in the increase in T value. Maximum T values for all fuels are obtained at 4000 rpm engine speed. By using E15, T value was increased by approximately 2.73% compared to gasoline [40]. Masum et al blended 20% of ethanol (E20), methanol (M20), propanal (P20) and butanol (B20) into gasoline. Four different mixing fuels prepared were used as fuel in SI engine. It is declared that T value obtained from all alcohol mixtures is higher than gasoline. The first reason to be obtained this result was that improvement of VE due to high latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuels. Another reason was that more efficient combustion occurred, because alcohol fuels had oxygen content. In addition, a high-octane number of alcohol fuels resulted in ignition delay, thus the amount of heat transfer occurring in the cylinders reduced. The average T values of M20, E20, P20 and B20 increased by 5.02%, 3.39%, 10% and 9.2%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [46]. In another study using mixed fuel containing 5, 10, 15 and 20% ethanol (E5, E10, E15 and E20), it was found that T value increased compared to gasoline. It was stated that the reason for this was that combustion was more efficient as a result of increasing the air–fuel ratio with addition of ethanol. In addition, ethanol’s anti-knock feature due to its high-octane number increased the ignition timing, thereby the maximum post-combustion pressure and T value increased. The average T values of E5, E10, 15 and E20 increased by 1.96%, 1.47%, 1.27% and 2.94%, respectively, compared to gasoline [56]. Hsieh et al. used 5%, 10, 20 and 30% ethanol mixtures (E0, E5, E10, E20 and E30) in gasoline in an SI engine. In experiments carried out in the stoichiometric air–fuel ratio, it was determined that T value obtained from E10, E20 and E30 raised the compared to gasoline. Considering all speed conditions, using E5, E10, E20 and E30 blends, average T values were increased by 1.5%, 2.4%, 3% and 4%, respectively, compared to gasoline [62]. Considering some studies in the literature where alcohols are used in a high mixing ratio and pure, Costa and Sodré used the gasoline/ethanol blend (E22) and hydrous pure ethanol (E100W) in a four-cylinder engine. It was determined that T value obtained from E22 at low engine speeds was higher than E100W, but decreased after 4000 rpm. The reason for high T value of E100W fuel at high engine speeds was attributed to high combustion speed of fuel and increase in combustion timing. At high engine speeds, there was a short time to complete combustion in an engine cycle, and a high combustion speed was required. Increasing combustion timing increased the combustion chamber pressure and thus increased the combustion speed. At high engine speed, average T value of E100W increased by 3.7% compared to E22 [53]. Koç et al. carried out experiments by gasoline, E50 and E85 fuel blends. Although ethanol had lower heating value than gasoline, T value increased by increasing ethanol content in the blend. The researchers attributed this to several factors. Firstly, it was stated that oxygen content of ethanol probably improved combustion quality. Furthermore, it was declared that as more fuel injected into the cylinder under the same volume conditions, higher ethanol contents increased T value. In addition, VE increased as ethanol decreased temperature of the intake manifold as a result of higher latent heat of vaporization of ethanol. At 10:1 of compression ratio, the average T values of E50 and E85 were about 2% and 2.2% higher than E0. At 11:1 compression ratio the average T values of E50 and E85 were also about 2.3% and 2.8% higher than E0, respectively [57]. Percentage change of T value obtained from some alcohol-fueled studies compared to gasoline is shown in Fig. 5 . When the figure is examined, it is seen that the use of alcoholic fuel generally increases the T value. It was observed that the percentage change in the increase was in the range of 2–5% on average. However, it is seen in some studies [46,50] that the rate of an increase has reached 10%. When these studies were examined, it was observed in Ref. [50] that the engine had a low cylinder volume and was air cooled. Moreover, it is seen that experiments have been carried out at high CR. In addition, methanol was used as pure in this research. The cylinder body of air-cooled engines remains warmer than compared to water-cooled engines. The excessive increase in T value is thought to be due to the use of pure alcohol at a high compression ratio and the engine being air cooled. In Ref. [46], a multi-cylinder engine with an electronically controlled fuel system was used. In addition, tests have been found to keep the air / fuel ratio constant for each fuel. In addition, stoichiometric fuel / air mixtures of alcohols are considerably lower than gasoline. When used without any changes in the engine, it is necessary to use approximately 2–3 times more fuel to reach the same equivalent ratio. In this case, the thermal value of the mixture may cause it to be higher than gasoline. This situation is thought to be effective in the increase in engine torque. These situations are estimated to be effective in the increase. In Fig. 5, it was observed that T value decreased in some studies. The decrease was observed to be around 3% on average. It was determined that the most decrease was at Ref.[24]. In the tests, it was understood that the air/fuel ratio was not kept constant. Therefore, if ethanol is used, fuel system designed for gasoline will create different air / fuel ratios in alcohol fuels in speed tests. This situation is thought to be effective in decreasing T value. In studies with a decrease in T value, it has been stated that the low thermal value of alcohols is effective. Furthermore, the presence of measurement uncertainties should not be overlooked in experimental studies in terms of percentage changes. 2.1.3 Brake power Table 2 indicated that brake power (BP) obtained by using alcohol fuels in experiments differences compared to gasoline. When studies with low mixing ratios are examined, it is seen that Sharudin et al. use pure gasoline, M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 fuels. The BP value obtained from the use of mixed fuels created by two different types of alcohol increased compared to gasoline. The reason for this was high combustion efficiency of the blended fuels in the cylinder. Furthermore, due to high density of methanol fuel, the injection of more fuel mass during the injection period had a significant effect on the increase of BP. When M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 were used, mean BP values increased by about 3.9%, 4.5%, 9% and 10.1%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [25]. As a result of Elfasakhany's experiment using pure gasoline, iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10, BP values showed a downward trend with the use of n-butanol. It is stated that this is due to the low-energy content of n-butanol and the increased absorption of heat from the cylinders caused by high latent heat of vaporization of the blended fuel. They also stated that the reason that iBM10 fuel produced the second highest BP value. After pure gasoline was that the combustion process occurred faster by using iBM10 and thus average cylinder pressure increased. Considering all engines speeds conditions, BP values of iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 were decreased by 3.5%, 2.8%, 1.7%, 7.89%, 7.23% and 6.57%, respectively, compared to that of gasoline [19]. Deng et al. tested 10% and 20% hydrous ethanol / gasoline mixture (E10W and E20W) as fuel. It was seen that E10W and E20W fuels produced higher BP values than gasoline. Since the latent heat of vaporization of alcohol-containing fuels is higher than gasoline, the temperature of the mixture for an intake period decreased. Thus, VE and BMEP increased. In addition, improvement in combustion performance due to oxygen content of alcohol fuels was another factor in increasing BP value. The increase in BP value by using of E10W and E20W was about 3.57% and 1.78%, respectively, compared to gasoline [17]. In another study, 5, 10 and 15% ethanol/gasoline mixture (E5, E10 and E15) was used. In addition, three different test fuels were obtained by adding 0.5% oxygenated cycloheptanol into each mixture fuel. In experiments carried out with six different fuels, it was observed that the BP value obtained from the mixture fuels at all engine speeds was higher compared to gasoline. It was emphasized that increase in VE by using alcohol fuel was one of the factors for increasing BP. The maximum BP values for all blended fuels were obtained at 8000 rpm engine speed. BP values obtained by using E5, E10 and E15 in this engine speed increased by 9% compared to gasoline [21]. Doğan et al., used E0, E10, E20 and E30 fuels in a single point injection four-cylinder SI engine. The lower heating value of gasoline was higher than ethanol. For this reason, BP value decreased with increasing ethanol amount in the mixture. The average BP values of E10, E20 and E30 decreased by 3%, 4.5% and 5.3%, respectively, compared to E0 [24]. BP values obtained from another study using iBE3, iBE7 and iBE10 decreased 6.4%, 5.5% and 3.8% compared to gasoline, respectively [27]. Elfasakhany used pure gasoline, niB3, niB7 and niB10. Since heating values of n-butanol/iso-butanol was lesser by about 23% than that of gasoline, lower BP values were generally obtained by blended fuels than gasoline. However, since niB10 mixture has higher VE and cylinder pressure than the other blended fuels, maximum BP value was obtained. Considering all speed conditions, average BP values decreased by 5.9%, 7.2% and 4.6%, respectively, by using niB3, niB7 and niB10 [29]. Balki et al. found that the use of pure ethanol and methanol increased BP compared to gasoline. It is stated that this is due to the low boiling point of the alcohols and the formation of a more homogeneous mixture in the combustion chamber. This factor improved combustion and VE, and BP value increased. Compared with gasoline, the maximum increase in BP values for M100 and E100 fuels was calculated as 12.25% and 7.5%, respectively [33]. Elfasakhany and Mahrous reported that the BP value obtained with the use of a low alcohol mixture decreased compared to gasoline, especially at high engine speeds. The reason of this was thought to be the reduction of the heat energy released in the combustion process due to lower heating values of these alcohols. The high latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuels was also considered to be another reason for the lower BP values. Considering all engines speeds conditions, when nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 were used, mean BP values decreased by approximately 6.57%, 5.92% and 5.26%, respectively, compared to gasoline [34]. Elfasakhany tested 3, 5, 7 and n-butanol / gasoline mixture (nB3, nB7 and nB10) at different engine speeds. Due to the higher latent evaporation heat of n-butanol fuels, they can absorb more heat from the cylinders in the evaporation and combustion process. Therefore, BP values of n-butanol containing fuels were partially lower than gasoline. In addition, n-butanol-containing fuels showed a lower BP value than gasoline due to their lower heating value. When all test conditions are taken into consideration, BP values by using nB3, nB7 and nB10 decreased by 2.06%, 4.13% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to nB0 [43]. In another study using mixed fuel prepared with combinations of different alcohol types, it was found that BP increased in methanol-containing mixed fuels in general compared to other fuel types. On the other hand, n-butanol + iso-butanol-gasoline and iso-butanol + ethanol + gasoline fuel blends showed a lower BP value than gasoline, as they had lower energy content. In addition, more fuel was evaporated than expected due to lower saturation pressure in n-butanol + gasoline blends. Thus, VE and BP values decreased. When ethanol + methanol blends was used, average BP value increased by 1.3% compared to pure gasoline at 2600 rpm, whereas when iso-butanol + ethanol and n-butanol + gasoline blends were used, BP values decreased by 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [35]. Najafi et al. found that the BP value obtained with the use of E5, E10, E15 and E20 mixed fuel is higher than gasoline. Average BP values by using E5, E10, E15 and E20 increased by 0.48%, 0.97%, 1.46% and 1.95% respectively, compared to gasoline [56]. BP differences obtained by alcohol fuels compared to gasoline are indicated in Fig. 6 . When the Fig. was examined, it was found that BP value increased in some studies while it decreased in others. In engines, BP is a function of engine speed and torque. Therefore, preferred engine speeds in the tests affect the BP value. This is the reason for the differences in the percentage changes of BP provided with alcoholic fuels compared to gasoline. According to the figure, the highest BP value was obtained by using M100 fuel with 12.25% increase compared to gasoline. In another study increased by 10.1% with M5B15 [49,14]. However, in some studies, some fuel blends reduced BP values compared to gasoline. According to the figure, BP value decreased by 7.89% and 7.23%, respectively, by nBE3 and nBE7 fuel blends [19].In addition, the effects of different engine variables such as CR, ignition timing, etc. are investigated in the research. The properties of alcohols such as the high-octane number, low boiling temperatures, low lower heat value affects BP value depending on the test parameters. In addition, the type of alcohol and its ratio in the mixture is an important factor that determines the percentage changes. 2.1.4 Volumetric efficiency In studies evaluating different types of alcohol as fuel, the changes of volumetric efficiency (VE) obtained from different engine variables according to gasoline are given in Table 2. Elfasakhany used pure gasoline, iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, iBE3, iBE7 and iBE10 as test fuel in SI engine. As a result, the higher VE value was obtained from iso-buthanol + methanol (iBM) fuels. High latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuels improved VE compared to gasoline. On the other hand, since the saturation pressure of iso-butanol (iB) was much lower than that of gasoline, VE values of the blended fuels diminished. Low vapor pressure was seen as the dominant factor and VE decreased as the alcohol content increased in the blend. Considering all speed conditions, the average VE values were reduced by 2.5% compared to pure gasoline, using iBM and nBE blends [19]. Elfasakhany used mixture fuels with low rates of n-butanol and iso-butanol in an SI engine. Dual alcohol was added to 3, 7 and 10% (niB3, niB7 and niB10) gasoline equally. The high latent heat of vaporization value of n-butanol / iso-butanol blend decreased inlet temperature of air taken into the cylinders and thus VE increased. The saturation pressure of butanol is as low as about 1/10 of the saturation pressure of gasoline and evaporation temperature. As butanol content in mixture reduced VE value tended to decrease.Because the effect of saturation pressure on VE was more dominant than the effect of evaporation temperature. Considering all speed conditions, average VE values by using niB3, niB7 and niB10 blend decreased by approximately 2.9%, 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [29]. In another study by Elfasakhany, 3, 7 and 10% n-butanol / methanol blending fuel (nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10) was used. It is stated that the VE value provided from the mixture fuels remains low at all engine speeds compared to gasoline [34]. Renzi et al., in their experimental study using E0, E50 and E80, it was observed that VE increased as the ethanol content in the fuel increased. The latent heat of vaporization of ethanol is higher than gasoline. This feature caused to decrease temperature and increased density of the blend, and thus VE increased. The mean VE values of E50 and E80 were found to be approximately 10% and 20% higher than gasoline, respectively [28]. Fig. 7 shows the percentage difference of VE data of alcohol blends used in the experiments compared to gasoline. When Fig. 7 is examined, it can be seen that the increase in volumetric efficiency is generally obtained from the use of ethanol and methanol. Latent heat of vaporization of ethanol and methanol is higher than other alcohols, as seen in Table 1. This is a fuel characteristic that affects the increase in VE. Methanol has the highest latent heat of vaporization with 1100 kJ/kg. It was found that he used methanol at the highest increase in VE. The highest VE increase was obtained by using M3, M7 and M10 fuels by 30% compared to gasoline. Another remarkable increase was seen by EM3, EM7 and EM10 fuels by 27% [43,57]. However, in some studies, by some fuel blends VE values reduced compared to gasoline. According to the figure, it is seen that VE value decreased by 2.8% by B (nB) and iB containing fuel blends [19]. When studies increasing the VE value more than 15% are examined, the common point is that the tests are carried out with an air-cooled and carburetor engine. When fuel and air are mixed in the intake manifold, it allows more air to be taken into the cylinders due to the high latent heat of vaporization of the alcohols. This situation is thought to be a factor in excessive increase in VE value. In addition, the type of alcohol used and its ratio in the mixture determine the role of this effect. 2.1.5 Brake specific fuel consumption Table 2 presents the percentage changes of the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) obtained from alcohol-fueled studies compared to gasoline. Some studies on the use of alcohols as a low mixture are summarized as follows. Li et al., reported that when it used gasoline and iPBE30 in the experiment, air/fuel ratio decreased, value of BTE increased, and hence BSFC values decreased by alcohol fuel. In addition, BSFC value increased because of lower heating value of iPBE was higher than that of gasoline. BSFC value increased by 7.1% compared to that of gasoline [32]. Sharudin et al. conducted an experimental research with pure gasoline, M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 fuels. Since alcohol fuels have lower energy content than gasoline, more fuel was consumed to obtain the same power from the engine. When M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 were used, the average BSFC values increased by 0.5%, 0.73%, 1.16% and 1.42%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [25]. Yusoff et al. used pure gasoline, E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 fuels in tests. BSFC value decreased at high engine torques. Under all load conditions, BSFC values of E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 decreased by 4%, 4.83%, 3.19%, 3.17%, 3.48% and 5.77%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [68]. Deng et al. used in E0, E10W and E20W fuel blends in the SI engine. It was observed that BSFC values of ethanol/gasoline blended fuels increased. By E10W and E20W, a BSFC value increased by 3.7% compared to gasoline [17]. Sayin et al. was reported that when iso-butanol ratio in the blend increased, more iso-butanol was needed to acquire the same equivalence ratio, and thus increased BSFC value. Compared to gasoline, BSFC values by iB10, iB20 and iB30 fuel blend increased by 2.64%, 3.96%, and 4.84%, respectively, compared to gasoline [39]. Agarwal et al. stated that BSFC raised with the increase in the methanol ratio in the blend. Even though oxygen content of methanol positively affected the combustion performance, BSFC value increased because heating value of methanol was much lower than gasoline. At all load conditions, BSFC values increased by 3% and 14% on average, respectively, compared to gasoline by using M10 and M20 [44]. Mallikarjun and Mamilla, tested M0, M3, M5, M10 and M15 fuels in SI engine. It reported that complete combustion conditions occurred due to oxygen content of methanol. Accordingly, BSFC tended to decrease with the increase in the methanol ratio in the blend. The mean BSFC values of M3, M5, M10 and M15 decreased by 4%, 6%, 23% and 37%, respectively, compared to M0 [58]. Doğan et al., average BSFC values of E10, E20 and E30 used in their studies were found to be 2.67%, 3.57% and 5.8% higher than gasoline, respectively [42]. Masum et al., as a result of their experiments, average BSFC value increased by 6.7% compared to pure gasoline by using E15 blends [56]. The reason for the increase in BSFC in all these experiments is that lower heating value of gasoline is 1.6 times higher than that of ethanol [24]. Eyidogan et al. carried out an experiment using pure gasoline, E5, E10, M5 and M10 fuels in a four-cylinder, multi-point injection SI engine. Since lower heating values of methanol and ethanol-containing fuels were lesser than those of gasoline, BSFC values of blend fuels were higher than that of gasoline. Although the lower heating value of methanol was lower than that of ethanol, BSFC value of M5 was lower than that of E5. BSFC value of M10 was also lesser than that of E10. This was due to the fact that methanol had higher oxygen content than ethanol. When E5, E10, M5 and M10 were used, the average BSFC values increased by approximately 0.2%, 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [54]. Farkade and Pathre tested fuels prepared by mixing 10%, 20 and 30% methanol, ethanol and butanol with gasoline separately in a single cylinder SI engine. According to this study, because lower heating values of alcohols were lower than that of gasoline, BSFC values of alcohol fuels were higher than that of gasoline. By using M10, M20, M30, B10 and B30, BSFC values increased by 4%, 10%, 22%, 3.4%, 20% compared to gasoline. BSFC values with using E10, E20 and E30 decreased by 1.6%, 3.2% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to gasoline [49]. Masum et al. used pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20 fuels in SI engine. Lower heating values of all alcohol fuels (methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol) were lower than those of gasoline. Therefore, it was reported that when blending fuels were used, BSFC values were increased due to the increase in the amount of fuel to obtain the same engine power. The average BSFC values increased by 7.58%, 5.17%, 4.43% and 1.95%, respectively, using M20, E20, P20 and B20 blends [46]. BSFC changes from some studies related to the use of alcohol with a high mixing ratio or purity are summarized below. Costa et al. reported that BSFC value increased by 54% compared to E22 by using E100W fuel [69]. Koç et al. stated that when E50 and E85 fuel blends was used at 10:1 of CR, BSFC values increased by 20.3% and 45.6%, respectively. At 11:1 of CR, BSFC values also increased by 16.1% and 36.4%, separately, compared to pure gasoline [73]. Li et al., tested mixture fuels prepared separately with three different alcohols in different ratios in an SI engine. It was observed that BSFC values increased by increasing alcohol content in the blend because the lower heating values of methanol, ethanol and butanol were lower than those of gasoline. When M10, M30, M60, E10, E30, E60, B10, B30 and B60 are used, average BSFC values increased by 8.28%, 22.87%, 51.75%, 6.51%, 15.36%, 34.39%, 4.96%, 10.29% and 18.32%, respectively, compared to gasoline [22]. Balki et al. used pure gasoline, M100 and E100 fuels and indicated that there was a significant increase in BSFC values by using methanol and ethanol. Because the lower heating value of alcohol fuels is lower compared to gasoline, approximately two-time pure methanol and ethanol fuel were used to obtain the same heat energy. When E100 and M100 were used, BSFC values increased by 56.25% and 103.12%, respectively, compared to gasoline [33]. Balki and Sayin observed that BSFC obtained from using pure methanol are increased compared to gasoline. This is because lower heating value of methanol is lesser than that of gasoline. In addition, it was stated that the higher stoichiometric fuel/air ratios caused more fuel to be used for the same output and thus BSFC increased. By using M100, BSFC value increased by 80% compared to gasoline [36]. In another study carried out by Çelik et al., pure methanol was used in an SI engine at different CRs. BSFC obtained from pure methanol increased by 90% compared to gasoline at 6:1 of CR [50]. Gu et al. used B0, B10, B30, B40 and B100 fuel blends in an SI engine. It was observed that as n-butanol content in the blend increased, BSFC value increased by the effect of lower heating value. Under full load conditions, using B10, B30 and B60 fuel blends, average BSFC values increased by 7.69%, 34.61%, 23.07% and 46.15%, respectively, compared to gasoline [66]. Fig. 8 was indicated as a percentage difference of the average BSFC values of alcohol fuels compared with that gasoline. BSFC represents the amount of fuel spent per unit of power. According to the figure, the highest BSFC values were obtained by using methanol and ethanol fuels. When the graphic is analyzed, it is observed that BSFC generally increases with alcohol. The optimization of parameters such as compression ratio, air / fuel ratio and ignition advance can limit the increase in BSFC due to increased BP value. In addition, when studies with high increase in BSFC are analyzed, it is seen that methanol is used pure in general. In the use of alcohol with a low mixture rate, the increase in BSFC was generally found at levels of 0–10%, except for one study. The greatest BSFC value was obtained by using E20 fuels by 130% increase compared to gasoline. Another increase is seen in M100 fuels by 103.12% [33,67]. When Ref. [67] is examined, it is stated that the tests take place in stoichiometric conditions for all fuels. In addition, the test engine is low power and air cooled. Since ethanol has a low thermal value, more fuel must be sent to maintain the stoichiometric ratio when there is no change in the suction line of the engine. Overheating of the engine body in experiments with different CRs can cause early ignition. This can cause a drop-in engine power. It is also important how the stoichiometric ratio is achieved and measured in the tests. The slightest mistake can cause an excessive increase in BSFC. These factors may be the possible causes of this excessive increase in Ref.[67]. In contrast to many studies, a reduction of 37% in BSFC was determined in Ref. [58]. When this study is examined, it is seen that the methanol / gasoline mixture is prepared with a set screw in methanol and gasoline placed in two fuel tanks in a carburetor. Experimental error rate can be increased with this method. Also, it is understood in the experiments that the air / fuel ratio is not done under stoichiometric conditions. Probably, in studies using alcohol fuel, the tests may have been carried out under poor mixing conditions. This situation may cause a decrease effect in BSFC. When the results are considered statistically, it can be thought that the reductions in BSFC are at a level that does not affect the overall result."
4,Emissions,"2.2 Emissions In the literature, the average percentage changes of exhaust emission values obtained from experiments with different types of alcohol compared to gasoline are summarized in Table 3 . 2.2.1 Hydrocarbon emission In Table 3, differences of hydrocarbon emission (HC) obtained by using alcohol fuels in the experiments compared to gasoline were indicated. When studies using alcohol with a low mixture rate are examined, Li et al. used gasoline and 30% isopropanol/n-butanol/ethanol blends (iPBE30) fuels in a SI engine. In the tests conducted, HC decreased due to oxygen content of iPBE30 fuel. The reduction in HC content was calculated as 17.7% using iPBE30 blend [32]. Sharudin et al. used different ratios of methanol and iso-butanol with gasoline (M5, M5B5, M5B10 and M5B15) in an SI engine. It is stated that combustion, which improves due to the oxygen content of alcohol-containing fuels, reduces HC emission compared to gasoline. Using M5, M5B5, M5B10 and M5B15, average HC emissions reduced by about 0.5%, 1.5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [25]. In another study, it was said that molecular structure of iso-butanol contains 21.6% more oxygen than gasoline. Considering all test conditions, HC values decreased by 30%, 32%, 34%, 15%, 17% and 19% compared to iB0 by using iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 [19]. Yusoff et al. preferred to use different ratios of ethanol and iso-butanol in the tests. Gasoline, E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5, E10iB10 was determined as test fuel. At high engine speeds, HC emissions obtained from ethanol and iso-butanol blends are reported to be lower than gasoline. The reason for this was that the increase in average temperature values in the cylinders because of the fact that air–fuel mixture was more homogenized as a result of an increase of combustion efficiency by addition of alcohol. In addition, an amount of HC emissions tended to increase as more fuel was injected into the cylinders per cycle by increasing engine torque. Considering all load conditions, HC values decreased by 21.31%, 44.39%, 25.24%, 34.87%, 55.06% and 31.49%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline using E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 [68]. Deng et al. tested E0, E10W and E20W blend. As oxygen content of E10W and E20W blends was higher than E0 fuel, full combustion occurred. As a result, HC emissions reduced. HC emissions obtained from E10W and E20W, reduced by 17.0% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to gasoline [17]. Gupta et al. carried out their study using E0 and E5. As a result of this study, the amount of HC decreased because ethanol had higher oxygen content and low air/fuel ratio than gasoline. By using E5 fuel, the reduction in HC was by 23.2%, on average [20]. Li et al. tested alcohol / gasoline fuels prepared separately with methanol, ethanol and iso-butanol in 10, 30 and 60% ratios (M10, M30, M60, E10, E30, E60, B10, B30 and B60) in an SI engine. In the tests, it was observed that the HC emission measured from fuels containing ethanol and iso-butanol decreased compared to gasoline, while it increased in fuels containing methanol. Methanol had a lower air/fuel ratio than other alcohol fuels. As a result, in the test engine with injection fuel system, more fuel injected into the cylinders by using methanol and HC amount increased. Using M10, M30 and M60, average HC emissions increased by 22.4%, 2.31% and 13.01%, respectively, compared to gasoline. By using E10, E30, E60, B10, B30 and B60, average HC emissions decreased by 10.98%, 16.47%, 50.03%, 1.45%, 13.29% and 8.67%, respectively, compared to gasoline [22]. Akansu et al. stated that the HC emissions decreased as a result of increasing BTE by using E20 fuel. By using E20, the decrease in HC amount was calculated as 9.8%, on average, compared to gasoline [23]. In experiments carried out by Doğan et al. at different engine speeds, gasoline, E10, E20 and E30 were used as fuel. It was determined that HC emissions decreased by increasing engine speed for all fuels, because turbulence in the cylinder increased by increasing engine speed. Thus, HC emissions tended to decrease as a result of a more homogeneous mixture. Due to low evaporation temperature of ethanol compared to gasoline, average temperature in the cylinders decreased by increasing amount of ethanol in the blend, and HC emissions increased [24]. Elfasakhany tested pure gasoline, E3, E7, E10, M3, M7, M10, nB3, nB7, nB10, iB3, iB7 and iB10 at a single-cylinder SI engine at 2600 and 3400 rpm. Alcohol reduced the amount of HC as the presence of oxygen in the fuels improved combustion performance. Furthermore, alcohol fuels contained less C and H atoms than molecular gasoline. Therefore, even in poor mixtures where oxygen was limited, full combustion conditions occurred and the amount of HC decreased. Moreover, since the evaporation temperatures of alcohol fuels were lower than gasoline, formation of the first flame front in the cylinders took place in a shorter period. By using ethanol, methanol, n-butanol and iso-butanol fuel blends, average HC emissions were reduced by 7.8%, 13.4%, 15.1% and 18.8%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [26]. Renzi et al., used E0, E50 and E80 as a fuel in an SI engine. The average HC emissions by using E50 and E80 decreased by 26.2% and 27.4% respectively, compared to E0 [28]. In the research was conducted by Elfasakhany using pure gasoline, iB0, iB3, iB7, iB10, nB0, nB3, nB7, nB10 fuels, it was stated that faster combustion occurred with n-butanol and iso-butanol. As these alcohols contained oxygen in their chemical structures, combustion efficiency increased, and more fuel burned. Alcohol fuels provided optimum combustion conditions even under very poorly mixed working conditions due to low air–fuel ratios. HC decreased with increasing n-butanol and iso-butanol content in the blend. Considering all test conditions, using niB3, niB7 and niB10 fuel blends, average HC values decreased by 8.2%, 12% and 15%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [29]. In another study by Elfasakhany, it was highlighted that when ethanol + methanol, iso-butanol + ethanol, and n-butanol / gasoline blend were used, HC emissions were reduced by 13.32%, 7.83% and 6.33%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [35]. Najafi et al., stated that HC emissions decreased as increase ethanol content in the blend as a result of the increase in air/fuel ratio and complete combustion due to oxygen content in ethanol. The lowest HC emission values by E5, E7.5, E10, E12.5 and E15 fuels were measured by 193, 152, 148, 147 and 143 ppm, respectively, at 3000 rpm [37]. Masum et al. tested E0 and E15 fuels in four cylinders SI engine. Oxygen content of ethanol improved combustion efficiency. For this reason, E15 had a reducing effect on HC emissions compared to gasoline. In addition, combustion performance improved as laminar flame speed of ethanol was higher than that of gasoline, which provided complete combustion of alcohol-gasoline blends. Due to these two factors, HC emissions decreased with increasing amount of ethanol. In addition, as engine speed increased, the amount of HC decreased for all blended fuels. This was due to the increased homogenization of the mixture with the increase of cylinder temperature at high speeds, resulting in increased combustion efficiency. Considering all engine speeds, average HC value by E15 decreased by 4.5% compared to pure gasoline [40]. Elfasakhany used M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10 fuels at 2600 and 3400 rpm in a single-cylinder SI engine. It is emphasized that the oxygen content of ethanol and methanol improves combustion, while the low boiling point allows to evaporate of fuel easily. As a result, the amount of HC emissions decreased. By using M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10, HC emissions decreased by 3.42%, 14.86%, 2.44%, 22.11%, 17.46%, 27.32%, 13.26%, 18.49% and 14.12%, respectively, compared to gasoline [41]. Agarwal et al. carried out their experiments using M0, M10 and M20 fuels in a four-cylinder SI engine. In these experiments, HC release increased due to very poor mixture and low flame speed at low engine speeds. At high engine speeds, there was not enough oxygen in the combustion chamber as the mixture was rich. As a result, HC emissions increased as combustion could not be completed. Because latent heat of vaporization of methanol was higher than gasoline, at low engine speeds the average temperature in combustion chamber decreased, flame extinction zones occurred within cylinder walls and this, generally increased HC emissions. HC emissions at 1500 rpm and at all load conditions increased by 1.2% and 7.9% on average, respectively, compared to gasoline using M10 and M20. Due to increasing temperatures at high engine speeds, different trends were observed in HC emission change. For all load conditions at 2500 rpm, HC emission values increased by 1.2% on average using M10 compared to gasoline and decreased by 8.6% by M20 [44]. Najafi et al. used gasoline, E5, E10, E15 and E20 fuels in the engine tests. It has been stated that the low-carbon content and high oxygen content of ethanol affects reducing HC emission after combustion. In addition, HC emissions decreased as a result the complete combustion conditions due to the reduction of an air/fuel ratio by ethanol addition. The average HC values of E5, E10, E15 and E20 decreased by 16.94%, 24.04%, 25.14% and 31.69%, respectively, compared to gasoline [56]. Mallikarjun and Mamilla observed that HC emissions decreased by using gasoline, M3, M5, M10 and M15 fuels. The average HC values of M3, M5, M10 and M15 decreased by 14.32%, 15.19%, 15.98% and 1.67%, respectively, compared to gasoline [58]. Canakci et al. used M5, M10, E5 and E10 blended fuels in a SI engine. Due to oxygen content of methanol and ethanol, HC emissions decreased as a result of increased combustion efficiency. When E5, E10 M5 and M10 were used, average HC emissions decreased by 27%, 32%, 35% and 30%, respectively, compared to gasoline [64]. Sivasubramanian et al. conducted an experimental study using iP10, iP20 and iP30 fuels used in a multi-injection, single cylinder and SI engine. As the propanol content in the fuel increased, oxygen content increased and HC emission decreased due to full combustion conditions. Furthermore, due to lower ignition temperature of propanol compared to gasoline, fuel could be almost completely burned in the combustion chamber as a result of mixture evaporated easily at low temperatures. Thus, no partial combustion occurred, and HC emissions decreased. The average HC values of iP10, iP20 and iP30 were less by 4.16%, 6.25% and 10.41%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [65]. Masum et al. tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. In full combustion conditions, the amount of HC emissions decreased due to the fact that air/fuel ratio of alcohol fuels was lower than gasoline. Furthermore, at higher engine speeds, the average cylinder temperature increased due to the more homogeneous air–fuel mixture. Average HC values decreased by 14.9%, 10.7%, 5.4% and 2.0%, respectively, by using E20, M20, P20 and B20 blend [46]. The changes in HC emissions from some studies where alcohol is used in a high mixture rate or pure are as follows. Feng et al. used B0 and B35 fuels in a single cylinder SI engine. It was indicated that HC emissions decreased by using butanol-containing fuel. This was since butanol had lower carbon and hydrogen content than gasoline, providing complete combustion conditions at lesser air–fuel ratios. The reduction in HC emission by using B35 was calculated as 16.65% [47]. Balki et al. conducted experiments using pure gasoline, M100 and E100 fuels in a single-cylinder SI engine. It was stated that combustion performance improved as a result of low carbon/hydrogen ratios and high laminar combustion rates of methanol and ethanol fuels. Thus, HC emission reduced with M100 and E100 fuels. Using M100 and E100, average HC emissions decreased by 27.12% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to gasoline [42]. In another study conducted by Balki and Sayin at different CRs, it was determined that HC emissions decreased due to oxygen content of methanol and ethanol, in general. However, at 9.5:1 CR, amount of HC emissions increased due to the increased in a surface/volume ratio in the combustion chamber. Using pure ethanol and methanol, average HC values decreased by 22.79% and 28.82%, respectively, compared to gasoline [45]. Çelik et al. carried out their work using M0 and M100 fuels in a single cylinder SI engine. Because latent heat of vaporization of pure methanol was about three times higher than that of gasoline, the average cylinder temperature decreased. This resulted in partial combustion in areas close to cylinder walls, thereby HC emissions increased. Using M100 fuel, HC emissions increased by 12% for CR of 6:1 and 50% at 10:1 of CR [50]. Balki and Sayin used gasoline and M100 fuels and determined the amount of HC emissions. It was stated that higher oxygen content and lower boiling point of methanol compared to gasoline caused to decrease HC emission. In addition, it was emphasized that HC emission decreased due to higher laminar combustion speed of methanol and an improvement of VE by using methanol. Higher latent heat of vaporization of methanol caused the temperature in the combustion chamber to decrease, and thus HC emissions increased. Therefore, it was stated that the reduction in HC emissions remained limited. Decrease in the amount of HC calculated as 20.37%, 40.12%, 14.81% and 2.47% by using M100 for CR of 8:1, 8.5:1, 9:1 and 9.5:1[36]. In Fig. 9 , HC differences obtained by alcohol fuels compared to gasoline are indicated. As seen in the figure, HC emission has decreased in many studies. However, as mentioned above, HC emission may increase slightly when using pure or high mixture alcohol at high compression rates. There are many parameters affecting this type of emission due to combustion. These are combustion chamber shape, compression ratio, ignition system, spark plug position, engine cooling type, fuel / air mixture condition, fuel carbon / hydrogen ratio, etc. For example, the ignition system does not ignite in a few cycles during the experiments, creating an effect on increasing HC emissions. Cold walls in the combustion chamber, engine speed, extremely poor mixture and rich mixture are some of the parameters that increase HC emission. Some properties such as oxygen content of fuel, low boiling point, high stoichiometric laminar burning rate, low carbon/hydrogen ratio of fuel are parameters that reduce HC emission. In addition, the operating regime of the engine affects the formation of HC emissions. For example, cold engine may increase HC emission in the first run. The differences observed in the drop rates in Fig. 9 are due to the variability of these parameters. 2.2.2 Carbon monoxide emission The CO emission changes given in Table 3 are seen. Some of the studies in which alcohols are used in low mixing ratios are summarized as follows. Sharudin et al., used gasoline, M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 in an SI engine. It was stated that the maximum cylinder temperature increased since the alcohol fuels created a more homogeneous mixture with air. This led to a reduction in CO emissions. On the other hand, the fact that methanol and iso-butanol had a higher laminar flame speed than gasoline was also stated as another reason for the decrease in CO emissions. When M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 were used, average CO emissions reduced by approximately 1.93%, 3.93%, 5.59% and 7.34%, respectively, compared to gasoline [25]. In another study, alcohol mixtures with fuel iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 were tested in an SI engine. The oxygen content in molecular structure of alcohol fuels is about 34.8% for ethanol, about 21.6% for butanol. It was emphasized that this situation has a reducing effect in CO emissions due to the improvement of combustion. CO emission decreased by increasing alcohol content in the blend. Considering all speed conditions, CO values decreased by 29%, 31%, 33%, 16%, 18% and 21%, respectively, compared to gasoline with using iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 [19]. Deng et al. tested E0, E10W and E20W in a four-cylinder SI engine. In the study, it was stated that the oxygen content of ethanol improves combustion. In addition, it was emphasized that the high stoichiometric laminar combustion rate of ethanol accelerates the oxidation of carbon atoms in the fuel. These factors have reduced CO emissions. Using E10W and E20W CO emissions reduced by 23% and 33.3%, respectively, compared to gasoline [17]. Gupta et al. carried out an experimental study with a mixture fuel containing 5% ethanol (E5). As E5 fuel had higher oxygen content than gasoline and more efficient combustion occurred, CO emissions reduced. CO emission reduced by E5 fuel by 1.23% compared to gasoline [20]. Akansu et al., determined that CO emissions obtained from E20 increased due to full combustion at low engine loads compared to gasoline. By using E20, CO emission increased by 5% on average compared to gasoline. At higher engine loads, CO emissions also reduced by using of ethanol-containing fuel due to high BTE [23]. Doğan et al. found that CO emission decreased with increasing ethanol ratio in blend fuel. It has been stated that the oxygen content and boiling point of ethanol are effective in this decrease. The average CO emissions by using E10, E20 and E30 decreased by 5%, 3% and 2% respectively, compared to gasoline [24]. Elfasakhany tested pure gasoline, E3, E7, E10, M3, M7, M10, nB3, nB7, nB10, iB3, iB7 and iB10. In general, as alcohol content in the blend increased, CO emissions decreased due to complete combustion. At 2600 rpm, when fuels containing alcohol were used, CO emissions decreased by 7%, 17%, 33% and 32% with E, M, nB and iB separately, compared to gasoline. At 3400 rpm, CO emissions reduced by 31% and 51% by using E and M fuels, whereas CO emissions increased by 10% and 5% respectively by using nB and iB fuels [26]. In another study, a reduction in CO emissions was detected by the addition of butanol in tests using niB0, niB3, niB7 and niB10 fuels. The first factor of this result is that combustion occurs faster because butanol creates a homogeneous mixture. The second was increased of combustion efficiency by oxygen content in butanol structure. Considering all speed conditions, when niB3, niB7 and niB10 blend were used, CO emissions decreased by 2.9%, 4.3% and 5.7%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [29]. In another study by Elfasakhany, three types of blended fuels were prepared as ethanol + methanol (EM), iso-butanol + ethanol (iBE), n-butanol + iso-butanol (niB) in 3, 7 and 10 ratios. Alcohols in the mixture were kept in equal amounts. It was determined that CO emission decreased because EM had more oxygen content and low boiling point compared to another alcohol fuel and gasoline. In addition, the amount of air in the combustion chamber increased considerably due to high latent heat of vaporization of EM fuel. As a result, CO emission decreased due to complete combustion. When EM, iBE and niB fuel blends were used, average CO emissions reduced by 21%, 14% and 5%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [35]. Najafi et al. tested E7.5; E10; E12.5 and E15 fuels. It was stated that the presence of oxygen in the structure of ethanol and high latent heat of vaporization increased VE value. As the increase in the temperatures in the combustion chamber, CO emissions decreased due to the maximum oxidation between C and O 2 . By using E7.5, E10, E12.5 and E15 fuels, CO emissions reduced by 5%, 4.8%, 3.8%, 3.3% and 3%, respectively, compared to gasoline [37]. Sayin and Balki stated that when iB10, iB20 and iB30 were used as fuel, CO emission decreased as a result of the increase in combustion performance due to oxygen content of iso-butanol. It is stated that close to stoichiometric value in air / fuel ratio and ideal ignition timing is effective in this decrease. In addition, high combustion chamber temperature at high CRs also had the effect of reducing CO emissions. By using iB10, iB20 and iB30 blend CO emissions decreased by 1.78%, 6.25% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to gasoline [39]. Masum et al. emphasized that the time required for full combustion cycle at high engine speeds was limited. However, in this study using E15, the high laminar burning rate of ethanol eliminates this negative effect. Therefore, a reduction in CO emissions compared to gasoline has been observed. Considering all speed conditions, by E15 blend, the average CO value decreased by 4.46% compared to pure gasoline [40]. Najafi et al. conducted an experimental study using E0, E5, E10, E15 and E20 fuels. Due to the presence of oxygen in structure of ethanol, oxygen/fuel ratio increased. Furthermore, because ethanol contained a lower number of carbon and hydrogen than gasoline, it provided complete combustion conditions, even at very low air–fuel ratios. As a result of these factors, CO emission decreased as the amount of ethanol in the blend increased. By using E5, E10, E15 and E20 blends, CO emissions reduced by 13.7%, 24.31%, 27.93% and 45.42% compared to gasoline [56]. Mallikarjun and Mamilla tested M0, M3, M5, M10 and M15 fuels. It was stated that oxygen content of methanol, better combustion occurred. Thus, CO emissions decreased. By using M3, M5, M10 and M15, CO emissions decreased by 0.2%, 1.4%, 2% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to gasoline [58]. Thomas et al. used B20 as fuel in engine tests. CO emissions decreased due to higher oxidation at higher CRs. In addition, it was reported that CO emissions reduced due to the increase in oxygen/fuel ratio when B20 fuel was used. By using B20 fuel, CO emission reduced about 1%, compared to gasoline [63]. Canakci et al. used pure gasoline, M5, M10, E5 and E10 fuels in a vehicle. It is stated that the improvement of combustion of fuels containing methanol and ethanol causes a decrease in CO emission. At the 80 km/h vehicle speed, it was stated that CO emission for E5, E10, M5 and M10 decreased about 18%, 17%, 14% and 11%, on average, compared to gasoline [64]. Sivasubramanian et al. used iP0, iP10, iP20 and iP30 as fuel in a multi-injection single cylinder SI engine. It is stated that CO emission is decreased compared to gasoline due to the high oxygen content of iso-propanol. By using iP10, iP20 and iP30, the average CO emissions decreased by 5.56%, 11.77% and 16.66%, respectively, compared to gasoline [65]. Agarwal et al., in the experimental study using M0, M10 and M20 fuels, determined that CO emission decreased by increasing engine load. The average temperature values in the combustion chamber increased as blend increased by increasing load. The increase in temperature increased the rate of chemical reaction between C and O 2 molecules, and reduced CO emission. On the other hand, the lack of oxygen in the combustion chamber in working conditions at high loads increased CO emissions. At low engine speeds, CO emissions tended to decrease as there was more time for the homogeneous mixing of air and fuel in the suction process. At low engine speeds, the higher the methanol content in the blend, the higher oxygen content actively involved in the combustion reactions, and consequently decreased CO content. At 1500 rpm and full load conditions, CO content increased by 7.5% by M10, and decreased by 50% by M20, compared to gasoline [44]. Masum et al., tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. In these tests, CO emission decreased as a result of oxygen content of alcohol fuels. The time required for full combustion was limited. However, the high flame speed of alcohol fuels had tolerated this negativity. Thus, CO emissions decreased. Mean CO emissions reduced by 16.6%, 13.9%, 9.6% and 5.6%, respectively, using M20, E20, P20 and B20 fuel blends [46]. In another experimental study conducted by Elfasakhany using M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10 fuels, it was stated that fuels containing ethanol and methanol had oxygen content and low boiling point. As these properties improve combustion, it causes CO emission reduction. In addition, and CO amount decreased with the increase of VE because more air was taken into the cylinder. When M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10 were used, CO emissions reduced by 17.7%, 51.1%, 55.5%, 15.5%, 31%, 42%, 17.5, 35.5% and 46.6%, respectively, compared to gasoline [41]. Some studies that use alcohol types at a high mixing ratio or pure are as follows. Li et al. tested fuels prepared separately with methanol, ethanol and iso-butanol in 10, 30 and 60 ratios (M10, M30, M60, E10, E30, E60, B10 and B60) in an SI engine at varied equivalence ratios. It was reported that CO emission obtained from M10, M60, E10, E30, E60, B10 and B60 at 3 bar engine loads raised by 52%, 22%, 48%, 34%, 88%, 12% and 20%, respectively. It also decreased by 8% with B30. It has been stated that this is caused by conditions such as rich fuel / air mixture, insufficient oxidizer and low combustion temperature. It was also stated that CO emission was increased at stoichiometric air/fuel ratio while decreased at rich condition. Furthermore, in all load conditions, the CO emission with the B30 was generally higher than gasoline, M30 and E30 at different equivalence ratios [22]. Renzi et al. used gasoline, E50 and E80 as fuels. It was emphasized that when E50 and E80 were used, an equal air–fuel ratio did not occur at all points in the combustion chamber and therefore the combustion temperature decreased. This situation had an effect of increasing CO emissions. CO emissions with using E50 and E80 increased by 1% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [28]. Balki and Sayin tested pure gasoline, methanol (M100) and ethanol (E100) in an SI engine. It has been reported that properties such as low carbon content and high laminar flame rate of alcohols have a reducing effect on CO emissions. When M100 and E100 were used, average CO emissions decreased by 29.07% and 31.34%, respectively, compared to gasoline [42]. In another study by Balki et al. at different compression ratios, use pure ethanol and methanol as fuel. It was stated that CO emissions reduced as a result of better combustion formation due to oxygen content of methanol and ethanol. However, as a result of the increase of heat transfer due to the increase of a surface-volume ratio in combustion chamber at 9.5:1 of CR, CO emission amount partially increased. When ethanol and methanol were used, average CO values decreased by 29.37% and 14.49%, respectively, on average, compared to gasoline [45]. Feng et al. conducted their research by using B0 and B35. In this study, it was indicated that due to B35, fuel had high air/fuel ratio and low carbon content, combustion speed increased and combustion efficiency improved. As a result, CO emissions decreased. CO emissions decreased by 12.8% compared to gasoline by using B35 blend [47]. Kyriakides et al. tested E0 and E40 fuel blends in a four-cylinder SI engine. In their experimental study conducted under 0.88, 0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96 and 0.98 of equivalence ratio, partial a reduction of CO emissions with using E40 fuel occurred due to the lower molar C/H ratio of ethanol compared to gasoline. By using E40 blend CO emission decreased by 0.3%, compared to gasoline [69]. Çelik et al. tested gasoline and M100 fuels in a single cylinder SI engine. It was reported that CO emissions decreased due to increased turbulence in combustion chamber and formation of more homogeneous mixture at high engine speeds. The presence of oxygen in the structure of methanol reduced CO emissions. By using M100 fuel, the amount of CO emission reduction was calculated as 1.33%, 1.25% and 1.23% at compression ratios 6:1, 8:1 and 10:1, respectively, compared to gasoline [50]. Gu et al. conducted an experimental study using gasoline, B10, B30, B40 and B100. When the onset of ignition was delayed, CO emission increased. In addition, CO emissions decreased due to improved combustion efficiency with butanol addition. CO emissions with using B100were raised due to the reduction of post-combustion oxidation and engine power output compared to gasoline. Under all load conditions, by using B10, B30 and B40 blends, CO emissions reduced by 13.04%, 17.4% and 26.08% respectively, while CO emission increased by B100 blend by 30.43% [66]. Fig. 10 shows the percentage differences of CO data of alcohol blend used in the experiments compared to gasoline. When the figure is examined, it is seen that CO emission is generally reduced with alcohol use. In these studies, in general, the oxygen content of alcohols, low boiling temperature, volumetric efficiency increasing effect and high laminar burning rate are stated as factors that decrease CO emission. The figure shows reductions in CO up to 30–50%. In these studies, it was determined that methanol is generally used. Methanol has the lowest stoichiometric air / fuel ratio and boiling point compared to other alcohols. This may be the reason why it produces the lowest CO emissions when using methanol. In addition, variables such as engine speed, load, mixing ratio, the way fuel is sent to the cylinders, engine characteristics play an important role in the change in CO emissions. The highest increase in CO emissions in Ref. [66] was seen with a rate of 30.41% for B100 fuel. Specific exhaust emission values are presented in experiments performed at different load and ignition timing. For this reason, in the study, there is an excessive increase in CO emission due to the decrease in engine power obtained with B100. It is stated in Ref.[22] that the increase in CO emission is caused by the inhomogeneity of the mixture in the combustion chamber, low combustion temperature and insufficient oxidation. In this research, experiments were carried out at different equivalence ratios and loads. However, the ignition timing is optimized for gasoline only. In this case, it causes not to benefit from the high laminar speed of alcohols. A local deterioration can be observed in the air / fuel mixture at the time of combustion with ignition. This factor may be effective in the increase of CO emissions. In addition, measurement uncertainties should not be ignored in evaluating the results. 2.2.3 Carbon dioxide emission Table 3 shows the percentage changes in CO2 emissions. Some studies dealing with the low mixture ratio of alcohol use is summarized as follows. The effect of low mixing ratio on CO2 is as follows in some studies. Sharudin et al. stated that CO2 emissions obtained from M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 fuels increased by increasing full combustion speed as a result of more air–fuel mixture entering the combustion chamber. In addition, by using alcohol fuels containing more oxygen than gasoline improved combustion efficiency and CO2 emissions increased. When M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 were used, average CO2 emissions increased by 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.8% and 1%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [25]. In the study of Elfasakhany, pure gasoline, iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 test fuels were used. Although the percentage of oxidation was higher by using alcohol fuel, as methanol and iso-butanol contained less carbon and hydrogen than gasoline, the amount of CO2 decreased by alcohol fuel. When all speed conditions are taken into consideration, by using iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10, CO2 emissions decreased by 21.9%, 18.5%, 16.7%, 29.9%, 26.5% and 24.7%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [19]. Yusoff et al., observed that when E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 fuels used, CO2 emission increased due to oxygen content of ethanol and iso-butanol. By this feature full combustion conditions occurred. Considering all load conditions CO2 emissions increased by 4.25%, 8.41%, 6.96%, 7.27%, 3.44% and 10.67%, respectively, compared to gasoline by using E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 [68]. Gupta et al. carried out an experiment by using E0 and E5 fuels. As engine load increased, CO2 emissions decreased due to lack of full combustion conditions and low air/fuel ratio. In addition, optimum combustion has been achieved due to the fact that E5 has higher oxygen content and higher air / fuel ratio than E0 for all loads. Therefore, CO2 obtained from E5 was found to be relatively higher than that of gasoline. By using E5 fuel, the increase in CO 2 was on average 0.52% compared to gasoline [20]. Doğan et al. stated that CO2 emission decreased with E10, E20 and E30 fuels at all engine speeds. The average CO2 decline by using E10, E20 and E30 were 1.3%, 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively, compared to E0 [24]. Elfasakhany tested pure gasoline, E3, E7, E10, M3, M7, M10, nB3, nB7, nB10, iB3, iB7 and iB10 in an SI engine. By using ethanol and methanol contained fuels, CO2 emissions increased due to the reduction in CO and HC emissions. Because CO and HC values with using butanol tended to increase, CO2 emissions decreased. When E3, E7, E10, M3, M7 and M10 were used, CO2 emissions increased by 2.5%, 4%, 9%, 3.9%, 10% and 12%, respectively, compared to gasoline. Also CO2 emissions obtained from nB3, nB7, nB10, iB3, iB7 and iB10 were decreased by 35%, 33.5%, 31%, 34.5%, 34.5% and 36% at 2600 rpm, respectively, compared to gasoline [26]. In another study by Elfasakhany, iB0, iB3, iB7 and iB10 were used as test fuel. It was determined that CO2 emissions decreased by using n-butanol/iso-butanol. This was due to the amount of carbon in n-butanol/iso-butanol and gasoline content. The n-butanol/iso-butanol contains four carbon atoms, while pure gasoline contains eight carbon atoms. As the amount of C in the blend decreased, the amount of CO2 decreased. niB10 fuel has a relatively high oxygen content and provides high combustion efficiency under poor blend conditions. Considering all speed conditions, CO2 emissions reduced by 42%, 41% and 39%, respectively, by using niB3, niB7 and niB10 [29]. Elfasakhany and Mahrous performed tests with pure gasoline, nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 in a single cylinder SI engine. At all load conditions, by using nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 fuel blends, CO2 emissions reduced by 1.5%, 1.2% and 1%, respectively, compared to gasoline [34]. In another study by Elfasakhany, it was tested 3, 7 and 10% and equal percentages of EM, iBE, niB blends in a single-cylinder SI engine. When EM fuel having high oxygen content is used, CO2 emission increases in parallel with the improvement of combustion. When EM blends were used, the average CO2 emission increased0 by 6% compared to pure gasoline. Also, CO2 emissions obtained from iBE and niB blends were average decreased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [35]. Najafi et al. emphasized that CO2 emissions increased as ethanol content increased in the blend used. Compared to E5, CO2 emissions increased by 0.5%, 0.9%, 0.95% and 1.45%, respectively, by using E7.5, E10, E12.5 and E15 fuels [37]. Sayin and Balki used iB0, iB10, iB20 and iB30 fuels in a SI engine. With the increase of CR, the pressure and temperature at the end of the compression period raised. In addition, the fact that iso-butanol fuel has higher air / fuel ratio compared to gasoline increases the combustion efficiency. This means that oxidation between C and O2 molecules had been fully occurred and, thus CO2 emissions increased with using iso-butanol containing fuels. By iB10, iB20 and iB30 fuels, CO2 emissions increased by 2.43%, 7.3% and 12.2% respectively, compared to gasoline [39]. In another experimental study conducted by Elfasakhany, it was used gasoline, M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10 fuel in SI engine. It was stated that full combustion occurred by using alcohol fuels which had low boiling point. As a result of high latent heat of vaporization of these fuels, the suction temperature decreased. Thus, by increasing VE, CO2 emissions increased due to more air intake into cylinder. By M3, M7, M10, E3, E7, E10, EM3, EM7 and EM10 fuels, CO2 emissions increased by 3.9%, 8%, 9.2%, 1%, 1.7%, 4%, 3%, 5.1% and 7.1%, respectively, compared to gasoline [41]. Farkade and Pathre tested pure gasoline, 10, 20 and 30% methanol, ethanol and butanol/gasoline blends. It was observed that CO2 emissions increased due to the increase in the percentage of oxygen by using alcohol blends. Considering all speed conditions, by using M10, M20, M30, E10, E20, E30, B10, B20 and B30 fuel blends, CO2 emissions increased by 1.5%, 1.8%, 2%, 1%, 3.6%, 4.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [49]. Najafi et al. carried out an experimental study using E0, E5, E10, E15 and E20 fuels. By using E5, E10, E15 and E20, the average CO2 emissions increased by 3.87%, 6.06%, 6.76% and 10.14%, respectively, compared to gasoline [56]. Canakci et al. emphasized that C/H ratio and C content of methanol and ethanol were lower than that of gasoline. It was stated that ethanol and ethanol-containing fuels caused a reduction for CO2 emissions compared to gasoline. When M5, M10, E5 and E10 were used, average CO2 emissions decreased by an average of 11.3%, 3%, 9.5% and 8%, respectively, compared to gasoline [64].In another experimental study, it was determined that CO2 emissions tended to increase by increasing engine speed and butanol content in the blend. The reason for this was that full combustion conditions occurred by obtaining stoichiometric air/fuel ratio by butanol addition. Nevertheless, considering all speed conditions, CO2 emissions decreased by 4.4%, 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively, by nB3, nB7 and nB10 compared to nB0 [43]. Masum et al. tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. As a result of the tests, it was emphasized that more alcohol-gasoline blends should have been consumed compared to gasoline in order to obtain a certain level of engine power. When the blended fuels were used, oxygen content and combustion efficiency increased compared to gasoline. By using M20, E20, P20 and B20 blends, average CO2 emissions increased by 15%, 12%, 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively, compared to gasoline [46]. Some studies on the use of alcohols at high mixing rates or purely are as follows. Galloni et al., used in B0, B20 and B40 fuels in an SI engine at varied air/fuel ratio. As a result, it was found that as the amount of butanol in the blend increased, the amount of CO2 increased. By using B20 and B40, CO2 emissions increased by 4% and 7.2%, respectively, compared to gasoline [30]. Balki and Sayin carried out experiments using M0 and M100 fuels. In the studies with methanol fuel, it had been observed that CO2 emission decreased slightly compared to gasoline. The relatively low carbon content of methanol in the fuel–air mixture compared to gasoline was thought to result in lower CO2 emissions. In addition, there was a reduction in CO2 emissions as a result of irregular combustion by using both fuel types at 9.5:1 CR. In the meantime, it had been determined that CO2 emission of methanol, which had better knock resistance, was higher than gasoline. By using M100 CO2 emission reduced by 5.84% and 2.92% for 8:1 and 9.5:1 of CRs while it increased by 0.73% and 2.19% for 8.5:1 and 9.0:1 of CRs, respectively, compared to gasoline at 8.5:1 of CR [36]. Balki et al., in their tests using pure gasoline, M100 and E100 fuels, combustion efficiency increased by using methanol and ethanol which had oxygen content, and CO 2 emissions tended to increase compared to gasoline. When M100 and E100 were used, average CO2 emissions increased by 1% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [42]. Feng et al. tested B0 and B35 fuel blends. By improvement of combustion performance, CO2 formation increased, and CO emission decreased. Owing to oxygen content of butanol, the combustion efficiency and the amount of CO2 increased accordingly. Furthermore, high air/fuel ratio of butanol and oxygen content increased formation of oxidation. The highest values of CO2 were obtained at 6500 rpm which maximum temperature values were obtained in the combustion process. When all these factors were taken into consideration, CO2 emissions increased by using butanol compared to gasoline. The increase in CO2 emission by B35 blend was 6.5% [47]. Kyriakides et al., in their experimental study using E0 and E40 fuel blends, there was a partial reduction in CO2 emission due to low C/H ratio of ethanol-containing fuels compared to gasoline. By E40, CO2 emission reduced by 0.1%, compared to gasoline [69]. Çelik et al. conducted an experimental study by using M0 and M100 fuels in a single cylinder SI engine. At 6:1 of CR, by M100 fuel, CO2 emissions decreased by 37%, compared to gasoline [50]. Costa and Sodré, used E22 and E100W fuels in tests. It was stated that more CO2 emissions were produced by using E100W because of high oxygen content of ethanol compared to E22. Using E100W, the average CO2 value increased by 1.6% compared to E22 [53].Fig. 11 shows the CO emission changes from some studies. When the graph is examined, it is observed that the CO2 emission increased in general except for the studies using n-butanol and iso-butanol. In most studies showing an increase in CO2 emissions, it is seen that the tests take place around stoichiometric fuel / air ratios for each fuel. Under these test conditions, the alcohol mass taken into the cylinders increases. Therefore, combustion efficiency improves with increasing oxygen content. In particular, the use of methanol and ethanol at low mixing ratios further increased CO2 emissions. The highest CO2 emissions increased by 15% using M20, compared to gasoline, in Fig. 11 [46]. CO2 emissions reached the lowest values in general with mixtures of n-butanol and iso-butanol. According to the figure, the lowest CO2 emissions was obtained by using iB3, iB7 and iB10 fuels by 42%, 41% and 39% decrease, compared to gasoline [29]. It has been determined that most of the studies with excessive decrease were performed by the same author. The common feature of these studies is the use of different butanol types at low mixing ratios (3, 7 and 10%). Also, there were no changes in the test engine. In this case, in the use of mixture fuel, it is stated that the alcohol added to the gasoline brings the fuel / air ratio of the mixture closer to the poor mixture region. This emission has been reported to decrease due to the worsening of combustion. In these studies conducted by the same author, it is thought that CO2 emission is reduced depending on the methods used in the tests. It is considered to be a result that does not express statistically overall. In some studies using butanol it was determined that CO emission increased. Moreover, there are many external factors affecting the result in exhaust emission measurement. These include the position and shape of the emission measuring probe, the characteristics of the measuring device, the device calibration, the time required to read the results, etc. These factors directly affect the results obtained in all emission measurements. In some studies, it is thought that the differences seen according to the literature may be affected by this situation. 2.2.4 Nitrogen oxide emissions Percentage changes of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from different types of alcohol compared to gasoline are given in Table 3. When researches using alcohols at low mixing ratios are examined, Sharudin et al. used M5, M5iB5, M5iB10 and M5iB15 fuels in an SI engine. It was stated that BTE and BSFC values were increased by the effect of extra oxygen in combustion process by alcohol containing fuels. Thus, maximum combustion temperature increased. These factors increased NOx emissions compared to gasoline. When M5, M5B5, M5B10 and M5B15 were used, NOx emissions increased by approximately 10%, 20.7%, 34% and 42%, at 2000 rpm respectively, compared to pure gasoline [25]. Yusoff et al., in their experimental study using pure gasoline, E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 fuels, showed that NOx emissions by blended fuels was lower than that of gasoline at low engine speeds. By using ethanol which had higher latent heat of vaporization than gasoline, the temperature of the mixture in suction process and accordingly NOx emissions reduced. At high engine speeds, NOx emissions increased due to the increase of fuel evaporation speed and cylinder temperature which would provide maximum combustion potential by ethanol and iso-butanol which had oxygen in their chemical structures. At all load conditions, NOx emissions obtained from E10, E20, iB10, iB20, E5iB5 and E10iB10 increased by 19.56%, 34.56%, 19.04%, 20.30%, 22.07% and 16.37% respectively, compared to pure gasoline [68]. Deng et al. tested gasoline, E10W and E20W in a four-cylinder SI engine. In this study, it was observed that flame speed increased by using of ethanol which had oxygen content. Thus, in the tests using ethanol, NOx emissions tended to increase due to the increase in pressure and temperature in cylinders. NOx emissions with using E10W and E20W fuels increased by 65.5% and 100%, respectively, compared to gasoline [17]. Gupta et al. carried out an experimental study by using gasoline, E5 and pure ethanol fuels. It was stated that NOx emissions increase due to higher temperatures at high engine loads. In addition, higher oxygen content of E5 fuel compared to gasoline increased NOx formation. Using E5, NOx emissions increased by 25% compared to gasoline [20]. Najafi et al. used E5, E7.5, E10, E12.5 and E15 fuels in an SI engine. It was emphasized that the maximum temperatures occurring in the cylinders depending on the exact combustion conditions were the reason for the increase in NOx emission. In addition, it was stated that by the addition of ethanol in the blend, the ignition delay was prolonged as pre-combustion period occurred in shorter period. Thus, temperatures in the cylinders increased due to improvement in combustion performance and consequently NOx emissions increased [37]. Masum et al. observed that NOx emissions increased by using E15 fuel blend which had higher oxygen content. Considering all speed conditions, the average NO x emissions with using E15 increased by 36.9%, compared to gasoline [40]. Akansu et al. reported that NOx emission decreased with increasing ethanol rate in the mixture due to the lower heating value of ethanol. By using E20, NOx emissions decreased by 10% compared to gasoline [23]. Masum et al., tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. Due to the high oxygen content of alcohol-gasoline blends, it produced higher NOx emissions than gasoline. When all fuel blends were compared, the highest cylinder temperature was measured by using E20, and it was found that it produced the highest NOx emissions, accordingly. In addition, it was observed that cylinder temperature increased as a result of the increase in fuel consumption by increasing engine speed. The increase in cylinder temperature increased NOx emissions. The average NOx emissions increased by 20%, 32%, 14.5% and 11%, respectively, by using M20, E20, P20 and B20 blends compared to gasoline [46]. Mallikarjun and Mamilla tested M0, M3, M5, M10 and M15 fuels in an SI engine. Due to presence of oxygen in chemical structure of methanol, combustion efficiency improved, and raised the pressure and temperature of the air in the cylinders. Therefore, NOx emission increased as methanol content increased in the blend. As a result, the average NOx emissions obtained from M3, M5, M10 and M15 increased by 1.25%, 3.12%, 12.5% and 18.75%, respectively, compared to gasoline [58]. Canakci et al. stated that when M5, M10, E5 and E10 fuels used, NO x emissions decreased. The reason for this decline was due to the decrease in combustion temperatures with methanol and ethanol which have high latent heat of vaporization. When M5, M10, E5 and E10 were used, average NOx emissions decreased by 7%, 1%, 10.7% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [64]. Sivasubramanian et al. carried out an experimental study with a multi-injection, single cylinder SI engine using iP0, iP10, iP20 and iP30 fuels. It reported that NOx formation increased as more fuel was taken by increasing engine speed. At the same time, full combustion conditions have occurred as the iso-propanol content in the blend increases the amount of oxygen in the fuel–air blend. As a result, it was stated that NOx formation was increased. In addition, due to high octane number of iso-propanol, shorter combustion process occurred and thereby NOx emissions increased. At 2800 rpm, by using iP10, iP20 and iP30 fuels NOx emissions increased by 8.88%, 16.3% and 21.7%, respectively, compared to gasoline [65]. Hasan et al., in their experimental study using E0, E10 and E20 fuels, it was emphasized that maximum temperature values in the cylinder decreased because ethanol had low adiabatic flame temperature and high latent heat of vaporization. Thus, NOx emissions reduced by using E10 and E20 fuels due to the reduction of heat loss caused by heat transfer from cylinder walls. NOx emission obtained from E10 and E20 fuels reduced by 34.6% at 10:1 of CR, respectively [67]. Doğan et al. stated that as ethanol had a high latent heat of vaporization, temperature of the blends decreased. Furthermore, it was indicated that ethanol required less air for combustion. As a result of these factors, NOx emission decreased by increasing ethanol content in the blend. The average NOx emissions of E10, E20 and E30 decreased by 12.2%, 23.1% and 30.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [24]. The changes in NOx emissions obtained from the use of alcohols with high mixing ratio or pure are as follows. Li et al. conducted tests in a SI engine using 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 50% methanol, ethanol and iso-butanol-gasoline blends. High combustion temperature and oxygen concentration at peak temperature zone are advantageous factors for NOx formation. The alcohol content in the fuel reduced NOx emission. Furthermore, when methanol, ethanol and butanol were blended with gasoline in the same proportions, the lowest oxygen content was in methanol-gasoline blends. Therefore, NOx emissions by using methanol-gasoline blends were less than other fuels. NOx emissions obtained from M10, M30, M60, E10, E30, E60, B30 and B60 decreased by 16.47%, 6.99%, 18.56%, 3.14%, 4.9%, 12.09%, 6.67% and 1.76%, respectively while it increased by 1.96% with using B10 compared to gasoline [22]. Balki et al., tested pure methanol, ethanol and gasoline in an SI engine. It stated that the combustion temperature decreased as latent heat of vaporization of alcohol fuels were higher than gasoline. Thus, NOx obtained from methanol and ethanol fuels decreased compared to gasoline. By using M100 and E100, average NOx emissions reduced by 13% and 14%, respectively, compared to gasoline [42]. In another study carried out by Balki et al., it was reported that methanol and ethanol had lower adiabatic flame temperatures and higher latent heat of vaporization than gasoline. This causes a decrease in the maximum cylinder temperature, thereby reducing NOx emission. When ethanol and methanol were used, average NOx emissions decreased by 26% and 32%, respectively, compared to gasoline [45]. Feng et al. used B0 and B35 in an SI engine. Butanol-gasoline blends have high combustion speed and combustion temperature compared to gasoline. Furthermore, B35 blend has a higher oxygen content and lower air/fuel ratio than gasoline. Therefore, NOx emissions occurred by using B35 fuel were higher than those of gasoline. At all engine loads, NOx emissions increased by 15% by using B35 blend, compared to gasoline [47]. Çelik et al. used M0 and M100 fuels in a single cylinder SI engine. Due to higher latent heat of vaporization of methanol compared to gasoline, temperature of the mixture in suction process reduced, and thus average cylinder temperature during combustion decreased. At 6:1 of CR, NOx emissions with using M100 reduced by 35%, compared to gasoline [50]. Pourkhesalian et al. tested pure gasoline, methanol and ethanol. Due to lower heating value of methanol and ethanol, NOx emissions tended to decrease by using M100 and E100. In addition, combustion temperatures reduced by using methanol and ethanol fuels due to higher latent heat of vaporization temperatures. It was mentioned that this was a factor reducing NOx emission. As the flame speed of methanol was higher than ethanol, the beginning of the ignition occurred later. Thus, by using M100, combustion temperatures decreased compared to E100. As a result, minimum NOx emissions were obtained. In all load conditions, NOx emissions decreased by 53% and 42% on average, respectively, compared to gasoline by using M100 and E100 [55]. Koç et al. stated that NOx emissions varied depending on temperature, time and oxygen content. It was reported that latent heat of vaporization of ethanol was higher compared to gasoline, and therefore combustion temperature decreased. This creates a NO emission reduction effect. Due to ethanol had oxygen content in its chemical structure, NOx emissions decreased by increasing ethanol content in blend. At 10:1 of CR, NOx emission obtained from E50 and E85 decreased by 5% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to gasoline. Also, , NOx emission at 11:1 of CR decreased by 14.5% and 31.44%, respectively, compared to E0 by using those fuels [57]. Gu et al. conducted tests using nB0, nB10, nB30, nB40 and nB100 fuels. As n-butanol's thermal value and adiabatic temperature were lower than gasoline, by increasing the amount of n-butanol in the blend, NOx emissions increased. NOx emissions tended to decrease by increasing amount of exhaust gas recycling. This was due to the reduced temperature in the suction process and reduction of temperature at the end of combustion in the cylinders by adversely affecting the blend formation. When ignition start became earlier, by B10 blend NOx emission increased by 0.47% compared to gasoline, while by using B30, B40 and B100 blends NOx emissions decreased by 14.3%, 9.52% and 40%, respectively, compared to gasoline. In cases where exhaust gas recycling was increased, by using B10, B30, B40 and B100 fuels, NOx emissions decreased by 25%, 15%, 37% and 75%, respectively, compared to gasoline [66]. In Fig. 12 , NOx emission differences obtained by alcohol fuels compared to gasoline are indicated. When the figure is analyzed, it is seen that is not one-way effect on the positive and negative changes in NOx emissions. The main source of these differences in research consists of the type of alcohol, properties of the test engine, mixing ratio, test variables (such as compression ratio, ignition timing etc.), test method etc. NOx emission varies depending on the temperature reached during combustion. In any way, if the temperature after the combustion reaches high levels, NOx emission increases. The most effective parameters on the end of combustion temperature are the oxygen ratio of the fuel, adiabatic flame temperature, compression ratio, laminar burning rate, ignition advance, air / fuel ratio etc. Also, if the test engine is air-cooled, there may be a higher cylinder temperature. Moreover, the method of sending alcohols into cylinders is a parameter that changes emissions. For example, if it is delivered with a carburetor fuel system, alcohol fuels can lower the internal temperature due to high latent heat of vaporization. This creates an effect of reducing NOx emissions. This is the main factor that reduces NOx emissions, especially in high mixture ratio or pure. At low mixing ratios, NOx emission may be reduced due to the poor mixture when used without any change in the engine. In some cases, it may also increase in parallel with the improvement of combustion. According to the figure, the lowest NOx emissions was obtained by using M100 and E100 fuels by 53% and 42% decrease, compared to gasoline [55]. However, the highest NOx emissions were obtained by using E10W and E20W by 65% and 100% increase compared to gasoline [17]. In this research, the water content in the fuel increased the drop in the temperature inside the cylinder. It is considered that the excessive decrease in NOx emissions is due to this situation."
5,Combustion characteristics,"2.3 Combustion characteristics Table 4 summarizes the combustion characteristic results obtained with the use of different types of alcohol in the literature. In this section, in-cylinder pressure (ICP), heat release rate (HRR) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) values are investigated as combustion characteristics. 2.3.1 In-cylinder pressure Percentage changes of ICP obtained from studies using different fuels with alcohol content compared to gasoline are shown in Table 4. Some studies using alcohol with a low mixture rate are summarized as follows. Elfasakhany used pure gasoline, iBM3, iBM7, iBM10, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 in an SI engine. It is stated that when iBM10 is used, the maximum ICP value is reached. As iBM10 blend had higher oxygen content than other blended fuels, faster combustion process occurred, and combustion consisted in lower air/fuel ratio. When all test conditions were taken into consideration, ICP values of iBM3, iBM7, nBE3, nBE7 and nBE10 decreased by 7%, 6.12%, 14.3%, 6.12% and 8.16%, respectively while ICP value of iBM10 fuel increased by 4% compared to gasoline [19]. Akansu et al. conducted their experimental study using E0 and E20 fuels. It was observed that ICP value decreased due to decrease in BTE by adding ethanol to gasoline. ICP value decreased by 27% by using E20 compared to gasoline [23]. In another study by Elfasakhany, pure gasoline, iBE3, iBE7, iBE10 fuels were used. ICP values of iBE3, iBE7, iBE10 fuels are reported to be lower than gasoline. The reason for this is stated as the decrease in the temperature in the cylinder when using blended fuel. Furthermore, iBE10 fuel showed a higher ICP value than iBE3 and iBE7. The reason was that it had a higher combustion speed, more oxygen content, and a lower air/fuel ratio. By using iBE3, iBE7 and iBE10 fuels, ICP values decreased by 10.7%, 9.5% and 7.4%, respectively, compared to gasoline [27]. Elfasakhany conducted experiments using iB0, iB3, iB7 and iB10 fuels. As a result of the research, it was found that ICP values of pure gasoline were higher than that of the blended fuels. This is because of maximum engine power was occurred by using pure gasoline. It was also emphasized that ICP value of niB10 fuel was higher than that of niB7 and niB3. The reasons of this situation were that niB10 fuel had more oxygen content, and its VE and flame speed were higher than the other blended fuels. Considering all speed conditions, the average ICP values were reduced by 12.5%, 16.5% and 4%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline using iB3, iB7 and iB10 [29]. Agarwal et al., in their study using M0, M10 and M20 fuels, it was seen that ICP value increased as engine speed increased. It was stated that the reason for this was the increase in amount of fuel injections. In addition, as methanol content in the blend increased, ICP value increased due to its oxygen content [44]. Masum et al. tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. ICP values of alcohol fuels were higher than gasoline because of the increased ignition timing, higher latent heat of vaporization and higher oxygen content. In addition, P20 fuel produced higher ICP value than other blended fuels. This was because P20 blends had higher octane number than other blended fuels and accordingly heat release began earlier. The average ICP values increased by 3.5%, 7%, 8.7% and 7%, respectively, compared to gasoline by using M20, E20, P20 and B20 blend [46]. Eyidogan et al. carried out an experiment using pure gasoline, E5, E10, M5 and M10 fuels in four-cylinder multi-point injection SI engine. It was stated that ICP values obtained by using gasoline at 10 kW, 15 kW and 20 kW loads were higher than the other alcohol containing fuels. This was because combustion process of gasoline was longer than that of alcohol fuels. When E5, E10, M5 and M10 were used, ICP values decreased by approximately 15%, 19%, 11.5% and 23%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [54]. Elfasakhany and Mahrous conducted experiments using pure gasoline, nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 fuels in a single-cylinder SI engine. It was concluded that nBM3 showed the lowest ICP value. This was occurred because of lower thermal values of methanol and n-butanol were lower than those of gasoline. In addition, nBM7 and nBM10 fuels showed the highest ICP values after pure gasoline because they had high VE and high oxygen content. By using nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 blend, for under all load conditions, ICP values decreased by 8.5%, 6.12% and 4%, respectively compared to pure gasoline [34]. When the ICP changes in some studies using pure alcohol are examined, it was observed that ICP values of M100 were higher than that of gasoline due to lower adiabatic flame temperature of methanol. By using M100, the increases in ICP values compared to gasoline were 23%, 16%, 12% and 10%, respectively, at 8:1, 8.5:1, 9:1 and 9.5:1 of CRs [36]. In another study, it was showed that ICP value decreased by using each blended fuel with increasing engine speeds due to the shorter time required for combustion and ignition at high engine speeds. On the other hand, the combustion time was shorter since ethanol and methanol had a higher laminar flame speed and octane number than that of gasoline. When methanol and ethanol were used, this factor causes an increase in ICP. The highest ICP value was obtained by using M100 at 2400 rpm engine speed [42]. Balki et al. found that when methanol and ethanol were used, VE value increased compared to gasoline. In addition, it was stated that due to high oxygen content of these alcohol fuels, combustion speed increased compared to gasoline. Therefore, ICP value was obtained by using methanol and ethanol was higher than that of gasoline. When ethanol and methanol were used, ICP values increased by 12% and 24%, respectively, compared to gasoline [45]. In Fig. 13 , percentage changes of ICP obtained from different alcohol-containing fuels compared to gasoline are given. In internal combustion engines, the ICP value changes according to the combustion rate of the fuel / air mixture in the cylinders and the amount of mass air intake. Since the high laminar burning rates of alcohols will affect the burning rate positively, ICP can increase by optimizing the ignition timing. In addition, high latent heat of vaporization may increase the amount of air taken into the cylinders. So, it causes an increase in ICP. However, alcohol properties such as lower heating value and stoichiometric air / fuel ratio adversely affect the temperature and pressure at the end of combustion. In addition, the difference of air / fuel ratio compared to stoichiometric ratio in the tests is an effective factor in ICP value. If engine tests such as in Ref.[45] are performed at the stoichiometric fuel / air ratio, the ICP may increase as the thermal value of the mixture will increase compared to gasoline. According to the figure, the highest ICP values were obtained by using iB50, iB30 and M100 fuels by 34.4%, 20.72% and 24% increase, compared to gasoline [39,45]. The lowest ICP values were obtained by 27% and 19% with using E20 and M10 compared to gasoline [23,54]. Alcohols are generally latent heat of vaporization higher than gasoline. However, this value of n-butanol is quite low compared to other alcohols. This situation has a decreasing effect on VE compared to other alcohols. Low VE value reduces the post-compression pressure. The decrease in ICP value obtained from n-butanol is considered to be due to this situation. 2.3.2 Heat release rate Table 4 summarizes the variation of HRR from some experiments in the literature performed under different test conditions. When studies that use alcohol with low mixture rate are examined, Agarwal et al. used M0, M10 and M20 fuels in an SI engine. It was stated that HRR values increased as engine load increased. Maximum HRR values were obtained at 3500 rpm and 60 Nm load. HRR value obtained from M10 and M20 increased by 4.3% and 28.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [44]. Sivasubramanian et al. stated that HRR values increased as iP content in blend increased. It was reported the factor affecting this situation was high oxygen content in chemical structure of propanol. In addition, it was emphasized that VE increased by using iso-propanol, which had a higher self-ignition temperature and latent heat of vaporization than gasoline. As a result, full combustion occurred and HRR value increased as more air was taken into the cylinder. Besides, it was stated that combustion process was shortened due to higher laminar flame speed value of iso-propanol than that of gasoline, and this was another important factor in increasing HRR. HRR values by using iP10, iP20 and iP30 increased by 2%, 6% and 12.3%, respectively, compared to gasoline [65]. Schifter et al. used E0, E10, E15 and E20 fuels in a single-cylinder SI engine. It was observed that HRR values raised with the increase in the ethanol ratio in the mixture due to high combustion speed, presence of oxygen in the chemical structure. By using E10, E15 and E20 fuels, HRR values increased by 1.66%, 11.6% and 25%, respectively, compared to gasoline [71]. Balki et al. tested pure methanol, ethanol and gasoline in an SI engine. When ethanol and methanol were used, the average HRR values reduced by 7% and 12%, respectively, compared to gasoline at 9:1 of CR [45]. Fig. 14 shows the percentage differences of HRR data of alcohol blends used in the experiments compared to gasoline. HRR is calculated as a function of ICP value. Therefore, factors affecting the value of ICP directly cause a change in HRR value. The position of the crank angle, which corresponds to the maximum of this value, affects the formation of heat transfer and exhaust emissions. If we look at the figure, the highest HRR values occurred by M20 and E20 fuels by 28.5% and 25% increase, compared to gasoline [44,71]. The lowest HRR values were obtained by using E30 by 32.35% decrease compared to gasoline [24]. 2.3.3 Exhaust gas temperature The change of EGT value obtained with the use of fuel with different alcohol content under different test conditions according to gasoline is presented in Table 4. Elfasakhany stated that EGT values decreased with the increase in the n-butanol/iso-butanol ratio in the blend. It was emphasized that higher temperature decreased in the cylinder due to higher latent heat of vaporization value of n-butanol/iso-butanol compared to gasoline. This was the primary factor in decline. In addition, due to increase in VE of niB10 fuel, it showed higher EGT compared to niB3 and niB7 fuels. Considering all speed conditions, average EGT values with using niB3, niB7 and niB10 decreased by 3.8%, 4% and 3.5%, respectively, compared to gasoline [29]. In another study, it was conducted tests using pure gasoline, nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 in a single cylinder SI engine. It was reported that nBM3, nBM7, nBM10 show lower EGT values than that of gasoline. The reason for this was higher latent heat of vaporization value of methanol and n-butanol than that of pure gasoline. The reduction in EGT values by using nBM3, nBM7 and nBM10 blends at all load conditions was 2.85%, 2.68% and 2.18%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [34]. Masum et al., in their study using E0 and E15 fuels, it was found that E15 produced lower EGT value than gasoline due to lower heating value of ethanol. In addition, as ethanol has higher octane number than gasoline, combustion in cylinder started earlier. So, EGT value decreased compared to gasoline. In addition, at higher engine speed, higher EGT values were obtained by using both fuels. Considering all speed conditions, by using E15 blend, EGT value decreased by 2.2% compared to pure gasoline [40]. Agarwal et al. observed that EGT values decreased as methanol ratio increased in all speed and load conditions. The reason for this was that methanol had higher latent heat of vaporization value than gasoline. This means that the temperature drop in the suction process will decrease the high temperature in the compression process. Thus, EGT value decreased after combustion process was completed. By using M10 and M20 at 3500 rpm, EGT values decreased by 1.23% and 23.5% on average, respectively, compared to gasoline [44]. Masum et al. tested pure gasoline, E20, M20, P20 and B20. Since M20, P20 and B20 fuels had lower combustion temperatures due to lower heating values than pure gasoline. However, E20 showed higher EGT value compared to other alcohol-containing fuels because of ignition delay. Average EGT values obtained from M20, E20, P20 and B20 were reduced by 5%, 4.23%, 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [46]. Ozsezen and Canakci tested pure gasoline, M5, M10, E5, E10 in a four-stroke multi-point injection SI engine. As a result of the studies, it was stated that minimum cylinder temperatures were obtained as a result of higher evaporation due to latent heat of vaporization value of M10. As a result, it was emphasized that EGT values of M10 fuel were lower than those of other fuels. While the average EGT values of M5, M10, E5 decreased by 1.36%, 2% and 0.68%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline while it was increased by 1.36% with using E10 [51]. Eyidogan et al. used pure gasoline, E5, E10, M5 and M10 fuels in four-cylinder multi-point injection SI engine. It was explained that EGT values obtained from alcohol blend were decreased because latent heat of vaporization value of methanol and ethanol was higher than gasoline. By using E5, E10, M5 and M10, the average EGT values decreased by 0.25%, 0.75%, 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to pure gasoline [54]. Costa and Sodré tested E22 and E100 fuels in four-cylinder SI engine. By using E100, EGT value decreased by 7.5% compared to E22 [52]. Renzi et al. carried out their experiments by using E0, E50 and E80 fuel blends. It was stated that EGT values decreased with the increase of ethanol ratio in the mixture. EGT decreased by using E50 and E80 by 4.6% and 10.3%, respectively, when compared to gasoline [28]. In Fig. 15 , EGT differences obtained by alcohol fuels compared to gasoline are indicated. When the figure is examined, it is observed that the EGT value generally decreases compared to gasoline. The fact that the high latent heat of vaporization of alcohols has a cooling effect has been stated by the authors as the main factor of this decrease. When the fuel / air mixture sent to the cylinder does not burn completely at the end of the compression time, subsequent burns may occur during the exhaust time. This may partially increase the EGT value. Due to the high laminar burning rate and oxygen content of alcohols, it allows the fuel / air mixture to burn completely. Thus, it will not cause an increase in EGT since there will not be any burning in the exhaust time. The low value in EGT from alcohol-fueled studies is thought to be effective in this case. According to the figure, the lowest EGT values obtained from E40 and E80 decreased by 10% and 10.3% compared to gasoline [28,69]."
6,Conclusions,"The studies on the effects of using alcohol fuels on performance, emissions and combustion parameters in SI engines with different power capacity had been examined in detail and following results had been obtained: • It can be stated that by using alcohol fuels in SI engines, BTE increases. The following reasons may cause to this result; firstly, alcohols have higher flame speed compared to gasoline, which reduces combustion time and thus less heat loss from cylinders occurs and combustion efficiency increases. The second reason is that alcohols have oxygen content, so this provides better combustion performance. The third reason; alcohols have three times higher latent heat of vaporization values compared to gasoline, which absorbs more heat from the cylinder during a compression phase, thereby the amount of energy required to compress air–fuel mixture reduces. Thus, BTE values of alcohol fuels increase. The fourth and last reason; thanks to higher octane number of alcohols, engine can be run at higher CRs without increasing knock and combustion performance can increase. • It is seen that by using alcohol fuel, T value also increases compared to gasoline. The reasons to reach this type of result are; higher latent heat of vaporization values of alcohols, higher VE by reducing temperature of mixture, and higher ICP values. Another reason; alcohol fuels have oxygen content which makes more efficient combustion. Moreover, as higher-octane number of alcohols allows anti-knock feature, ignition advance increases. Increasing ignition advance also increases post-combustion pressure and T value compared to gasoline. • When considering the reviewed studies, BP value increases compared to gasoline by using the alcohols except butanol and iso-butanol, due to the fact that the latent heat of vaporization value which is higher compared to gasoline, temperature of mixture at the suction phase decreases, VE increases, and combustion is more efficient due to oxygen content in their chemical structures. In addition, those alcohols contain less carbon and hydrogen than gasoline and provide full combustion conditions in almost all operating conditions. However, as heating values of n-butanol and iso-butanol are lower than that of gasoline, the amount of heat release in combustion process also reduces. Furthermore, VE decreases due to the lower saturation pressure compared to gasoline and BP value decreases compared to gasoline. • Methanol and ethanol cause to increase in VE value compared to gasoline since latent heat of vaporizations of these fuels are higher than that of gasoline. Thus, lower temperature occurs and concentration of the blend increases. However, lower VE values are obtained for butanol and iso-butanol fuels because of the lower heating values of butanol and iso-butanol fuels which are lower than that of gasoline. • It can be stated that alcohol use increases BSFC compared to gasoline. If the investigations are examined, it can be stated that since alcohols have lower heating values than gasoline, more fuel is consumed by the engine to obtain same output power, thus BSFC increases compared to gasoline. Studies on the effects of using alcohol fuels on emission parameters have been investigated and following results have been obtained: • By using alcohol fuels in the SI engines, it can be said that HC emissions are reduced if compared to gasoline. There are several reasons why using alcohol fuel can reduce HC emissions. Firstly, alcohol fuels improve combustion process due to oxygen content in chemical structure. Furthermore, alcohols obtain optimum combustion conditions even under very poorly mixed operating conditions due to their low air–fuel ratios based on their lower carbon and hydrogen content than gasoline. In addition, alcohols increase VE due to higher latent heat of vaporization, thereby more air to introduce into the cylinder. Besides, alcohols improve VE by improving combustion performance as a result of the first flame front being formed in cylinders in a very short time based on evaporation temperatures lower than gasoline. Another factor in reducing HC emissions is occurring complete combustion by using alcohol-gasoline blends due to increase in VE value by alcohols and the higher laminar combustion speed than gasoline. • According to the studies conducted, it can be concluded that alcohol fuels produce lower CO emissions compared to gasoline. The reasons are; firstly, full combustion conditions occur by using alcohol fuels containing oxygen. As a result of this, CO 2 emissions increased with formation of high combustion efficiency and CO emissions decreased due to incomplete combustion. Secondly; the higher latent heat of vaporization value of alcohols, the lower the temperature of blend, and the higher VE, more oxygen is taken into cylinders. The third reason is that an improvement of combustion efficiency due to high flame speed of alcohols. Fourthly; alcohols contain lower number of carbon and hydrogen compared to gasoline, thus complete combustion conditions has been provided, even at very low air–fuel ratios. Fifth and finally; since the lower heating values of alcohols compared to gasoline, more fuel is consumed to obtain same power. • If the studies are evaluated, it can be stated that, in some alcohol cases, when the carbon content in fuel–air mixture is relatively low compared to gasoline, CO 2 emissions reduce. However, by using some alcohols CO 2 emissions increase. The first reason of the increase is; they improve combustion efficiency due to presence of oxygen content in their chemical structure. The second reason; high air/fuel ratio to provide complete combustion conditions and thus complete oxidation of C and O 2 molecules occurs. The third and last reason; due to low boiling points and higher latent heat of vaporization values of alcohol fuels, complete combustion occurs, thus suction temperature reduces and VE increase to take more air into the cylinder. • When the studies related to the changes in NO x emissions are examined, it is seen that when pure methanol and ethanol were used NO x emission reduced compared to gasoline. However, in low blend ratios, NO x emissions increased remarkably. The first reason of why alcohol fuels have NO x emission reduction effect is; due to the lower adiabatic flame temperature and higher latent heat of vaporization values of alcohols, temperature of the mixture in suction phase and cylinder reduce, thereby heat loss through heat transfer from cylinder walls reduces. Another reason; due to lower heating value of alcohols, lower average cylinder temperatures occur. On the other hand, the first factor that increases NO x emission by alcohol fuels; flame speed increases due to oxygen content in chemical structure and thus pressure and temperature in the cylinder increase. Another reason; the pre-combustion period occurs in a short time and thus the cylinder temperature increases due to the improved combustion performance. The last reason; higher octane number of alcohols makes it possible to run engines at higher CRs. Combustion temperatures increase by increasing CR. In terms of combustion characteristics of SI engines, the literature based on the effects of alcohol fuels is examined and following results are obtained: • If the studies based on the changes in ICP value by using alcohol fuels in SI engines are compiled, it is seen that ICP value increased in some alcohol uses, while ICP value decreased with another alcohol uses. The first reasons of using alcohol increases ICP value are that alcohols contain oxygen in chemical structure, have higher octane number and higher laminar combustion speed compared to those of gasoline, which means that combustion process is shorter than gasoline and thus it allows heat loss from cylinder walls. Another reason; VE and BTE values of alcohols is higher due to latent heat of vaporization values of alcohols. The reason for the decrease in ICP value compared to gasoline by using alcohol is that due to lower heating value of alcohols compared to that of gasoline, heat energy and consequently BTE reduces. • HRR value increases in some cases using alcohol while, in some other cases using alcohol, HRR value decreases. There are several reasons why alcohol use increases HRR compared to gasoline. First; alcohols have a high combustion speed due to oxygen content in chemical structure, thus combustion process shortens and complete combustion process occurs. Secondly; higher VE value due to higher latent heat vaporization value of alcohols than that of gasoline, full combustion conditions are occurred by taking more air into the cylinder. Thirdly is that formation of rich blending conditions as a result of taking more fuel into cylinders for the same output power by using alcohol fuel. The reason why alcohol use reduces HRR compared to gasoline is; alcohols have cooling properties and lower boiling points compared to that of gasoline. • The experimental studies show that EGT value decreases in general when alcohol fuels are used. The first factor of reducing EGT value by using alcohols; it is a high decrease in temperature in suction process due to the higher latent heat of vaporization value of alcohols and thus temperature decreases at the end of compression process. The second and last factors; due to lower heating value of alcohols compared to that of gasoline, lower combustion temperature occurring in the cylinder."
