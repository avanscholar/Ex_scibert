0,Introduction,"Catalysts with two or more active sites at juxtapositions trigger the reactants to obtain the target product in organic synthesis through a tandem process. These multisite catalysts carry out successive reactions in one pot by evading the work up and isolation of intermediates, exhibit high atom economy, reduce reaction time and energy consumption [1,2]. The design of catalyst for a tandem process involves careful choice of catalytic active sites required for the entire sequence of the multistep organic transformation. Furthermore, the active sites of the catalyst must be close enough to carry out the transformation and at the same time they should be spatially separated in order to avoid unnecessary interactions [3–5]. Normally, those functional groups of multisite catalysts are embedded in the well-structured porous matrix for tandem synthetic organic transformations. Porous silica materials grafted with multifunctional sites have been widely studied in tandem reactions. However, the instability in extremely acidic or basic solutions and limited functional sites on the surface of these materials restrict their application in tandem catalysis [6–9]. Besides, porous inorganic-organic hybrid materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been commonly applied as multisite catalysts but the chemical and water instability limit their performance in tandem processes [10–12]. In recent years, porous organic polymers (POPs) have also been utilized as a platform to afford multisite heterogeneous catalysts owing to their high surface area, robust framework and easy functionalization [13–18]. Mostly, POPs are amorphous and have non uniform pores that are not well defined, making it difficult to understand their behavior in catalysis [19]. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop multisite catalysts with enhanced stability and performance in tandem reactions for imperative industrial processes. Recently, nanostructured materials have been widely used for various applications. The nanostructures offer advantages of high surface area, synergistic interactions, and multiple functionalities towards biosensing, environmental gas sensing, water remediation, photocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis [20–24]. Covalent Triazine Polymers (CTPs), a class of porous organic polymers, have been drawing much attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their intriguing features including large surface area, adjustable porous properties, easy tailorable chemistry, and excellent stability. Unfortunately, the previous works using CTP-based catalysts for organic transformations are focused only on studying single-step reactions and multistep tandem reactions are not reported [25–28]. To implement CTP as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for tandem reactions, a possible way is to introduce two different catalytic functional sites like sulfonic acid groups and noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) into the framework. The sulfonic acid (–SO3H) groups can be grafted into the porous triazine framework as a pendant group by the post-synthetic covalent modification to produce a solid acid catalyst (CTP-SO3H) [29,30]. Such solid acid catalysts are superior to the conventional mineral acid catalysts which are homogeneous and thus associated with problems in separation and purification [31]. Furthermore, the nitrogen functionality in CTPs could be effectively used for anchoring catalytically active metal centers. CTPs anchored with palladium, rhodium, silver, copper and ruthenium nanoparticles have been used for catalytic reactions such as reduction of nitroarenes [32], hydrogenation of benzene [33], oxidative esterification of alcohols [34], ipso-hydroxylation [35] and oxidation of HMF [36], respectively. Therefore, these features prompted us to study the utility of CTP as a bifunctional catalyst by introducing both acid and metal active sites via post-synthetic modification methods. Hydrogenation and esterification are two important and essential reactions in various fields of chemistry for the production of fine chemicals. Typical hydrogenation reaction is carried out using metal catalysts such as nickel, palladium, or platinum [37,38], while esterification reaction is performed using conventional mineral acids or solid acid catalysts [39,40]. Recent literature shows that increasing interest have been attached in developing metal-acid bifunctional catalysts for hydrogenation-esterification in one pot. For instance, Chen et al. developed a nanoreactor based on PtNi@ Metal organic framework composites loading polyoxometalates for OHE to prepare anesthetics [41]. Zhang et al. prepared palladium NPs supported on sulfonic acid functionalized metal organic framework for the conversion of biomass to an important and expensive pharmaceutical intermediate through OHE [42]. Metal-acid bifunctional systems such as Pt/HZSM-5 [43], Pt/SBA15-PrSO3H [44], Cu-ZSM-5 [45] and Pd/Al-SBA-15 [46] have been reported for catalytic upgrading of bio-oil through OHE reaction. Despite all the studies, developing new tailor-made heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity for OHE reaction is still desirable. In the present work, we report a new kind of bifunctional catalyst with noble metal particles anchored on CTP framework functionalized with acid sites (CTP-SO3H/Pd) (Scheme 1 ) specifically for one pot hydrogenation esterification reaction (Scheme 2) . In this catalyst system, the Pd NPs acting as hydrogenation sites are surrounded by SO3H esterification sites of CTP framework, which assures that the hydrogenated product can be instantly esterified without any transfer restriction. A model reaction was carried out using CTP-SO3H/Pd as a catalyst and 4-nitrobenzoic acid as a substrate. As expected, the OHE reaction produced benzocaine with almost 95% conversion and selectivity. The target product benzocaine is a very important amino-ester-type anesthetic and medical intermediate synthesized by a multistep process in traditional industry [47,48]."

3,Synthesis of CTP,"2.2 Synthesis of CTP The covalent triazine polymer (CTP) was prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction of cyanuric chloride (1.47 ​g, 8 ​mmol) with para-terphenyl (2.3 ​g, 11.2 ​mmol) in dichloromethane (100 ​ml) under reflux and in the presence of anhydrous AlCl3 (3.00 ​g, 24.2 ​mmol) as a catalyst for 12 ​h. After thoroughly washing the obtained precipitate with DCM, methanol, and water (3–4 times) to completely remove the unreacted starting precursors and impurities, the solid was collected by filtration and vacuum dried for 4 ​h."
4,Sulfonation of CTP,"2.3 Sulfonation of CTP The functionalization with acid groups, of the CTP was carried out by simple treatment with chlorosulfonic acid in DCM, yielding CTP-SO3H. For this, solution of chlorosulfonic acid (0.2 ​ml) in DCM (2.0 ​ml) was added dropwise to a dispersion of CTP (0.15 ​g) in DCM (5.0 ​ml) at 0 ​°C. Then the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for two days, and then the reaction mixture was quenched with 250 ​mL of ice cold water. The resulting product was washed repeatedly with DCM, methanol and water to get rid of unreacted chlorosulfonic acid, filtered and dried at 120 ​°C."
5,Pd immobilization,"2.4 Pd immobilization CTP-SO3H (0.05 ​g) was well dispersed in DCM (40 ​mL) followed by the addition of 0.1 ​M Pd(OAc)2 solution (1.0 ​mL) and stirred at room temperature for 30 ​min, then 0.1 ​M NaBH4 solution (2.0 ​mL) added dropwise under constant stirring for another 2 ​h to reduce Pd2+ to Pd0. Then, the obtained solid is filtered, washed repeatedly with methanol, acetone and water. The black solid (CTP-SO3H/Pd) thus obtained was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 ​°C for 3 ​h."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization CTP-SO3H/Pd catalyst was characterized using PXRD, N2 sorption studies, elemental analysis, XPS and HR-TEM. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns are obtained with a Shimadzu XD-D1 diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ= 0.15406 ​nm) radiation at 0.2° min−1 scan rate and 4–60° 2θ scan range. The polymer catalysts surface area and pore volumes were calculated from N2 sorption isotherms at 77 ​K using a BELSORP-max, Japan. Before sorption measurements, the samples were degassed under vacuum overnight at 150 ​°C. HR-TEM measurements were performed with a JEOL JEM-3010 instrument (JEOL, Japan) high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The chemical states of elements were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the CTP-SO3H/Pd sample operated on Kratos AXIS-SUPRA spectrometer (Kratos, U.K.) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer. The catalytic reaction conversions were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 7890A, U.S.A.) fitted with an HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector."
7,General procedure for the one pot tandem reaction,"2.6 General procedure for the one pot tandem reaction One pot hydrogenation-esterification reaction was conducted using CTP-SO3H/Pd as a bifunctional catalyst. For this a 50 ​ml high pressure reactor was loaded with 1.2 ​mmol of 4-nitro benzoic acid, 40 ​mg of catalyst, 0.1 ​MPa H2, 5 ​mL of ethanol. The reactor was heated at 80 ​°C under the stirring condition to complete the hydrogenation and esterification process. After the reaction was halted, cooled to 5 ​°C, and the remaining H2 was evacuated slowly. The conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid in the reactions was monitored by taking aliquots from the reactions mixture with filter syringe and analyzing them with GC fitted with an HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector."
8,Titration method for quantification of total acid concentration,"2.7 Titration method for quantification of total acid concentration To quantify the acid sites in catalyst, all the sulfonic acid-functionalized covalent triazine polymers were back titrated in a non aqueous acetonitrile (ACN) solvent, following a previously reported protocol [49]. In a typical titration experiment, a mixture of the polymer catalyst (~25 ​mg) and a [base ​+ ​indicator] solution (20 ​mL) in ACN (25 ​mM pyridine +0.02 ​mM p-naphtholbenzein) was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 4 ​h. The resulting mixture was then filtered through a 0.2 ​μm PTFE syringe filter. Three aliquots (3 ​× ​5 ​mL) of the filtrate were back-titrated using a 0.1 ​M solution of perchloric acid in acetic acid."
9,Results and discussion,"X-ray diffraction was carried out to identify the patterns of the sample phases as shown in (Fig. 1 ). The synthesized CTP exhibited a broad diffraction peak from 6° to 38°, indicating a structure with partial crystallinity and shows a certain degree of ordering of CTP. This diffraction peak can be also observed in CTP-SO3H and CTP-SO3H/Pd, evidencing the retention of CTP structure against post-synthetic modification. Meanwhile, the diffraction pattern of CTP-SO3H/Pd shows a peak at 40.1° for the Pd nanoparticles corresponding to (111) plane, indicating the high dispersion of Pd NPs on the triazine framework. The decrease of the reflection intensity of CTP-SO3H and CTP-SO3H/Pd with respect to the parent CTP is a consequence of the inclusion of guest molecules in the framework. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was used to predict the dispersion of palladium nanoparticles in the CTP-SO3H/Pd catalyst. It is clear from the TEM images that the Pd particles are of nanoscale and the particle size distribution calculations predict the size of 3.0 ​nm (Fig. 2 ). Moreover, CTP has served as an effective platform for the dispersion of the nanoparticles and thereby preventing the agglomeration or precipitation of Pd from solvent. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and physiochemical, surface properties of synthesized covalent triazine polymers are summarized in Table 1 . All the three samples (CTP, CTP-SO3H and CTP-SO3H/Pd) exhibited same type I isotherms with strong adsorption in the low pressure region, suggesting the microporous nature of the materials. Moreover, desorption shows hysteresis due to reversible and/or irreversible gas uptake in the pores. The BET surface area and pore volume of the samples were calculated to be 901 ​m2/g, 487 ​m2/g, 223 ​m2/g and 0.489 ​cm3/g, 0.245 ​cm3/g, 0.167 ​cm3/g for CTP, CTP-SO3H, CTP-SO3H/Pd respectively. The considerable decrease in surface area and pore volume of CTP-SO3H and CTP-SO3H/Pd is due to the stepwise functionalization on CTP framework. Pore size distribution (PSD) estimated by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) of the CTP and derived materials is shown in Fig. 3 (b). These PSD patterns exhibited pore diameters ranging from 0.6 ​nm to 5.5 ​nm for CTP and derived materials. A peak pore diameter of 0.6 ​nm suggested that the materials are microporous along with small mesoporosity [50]. Further investigation of the surface properties of developed polymers is also implied by elemental analysis (EA) and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). CTP-SO3H contains 4.97 ​mmol/g of nitrogen and 3.14 ​mmol/g of sulfur, CTP-SO3H/Pd revealed an amount of 4.65 ​mmol/g of nitrogen and 2.99 ​mmol/g of sulfur as determined by elemental analysis. The Pd loading amount on CTP-SO3H/Pd is determined to be 0.518 ​mmol/g by ICP-OES. The chemical bondings and electronic state of metal in CTP-SO3H/Pd was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 4 . N 1s of CTP-SO3H/Pd (Fig. 4(a)) exhibited a binding energy peak at 397.7 ​eV that can be attributed to triazinic nitrogen similar to pyridinic nitrogen (C-N=C). S 2p fitting XPS spectrum (Fig. 4(b)) shows two binding energy peaks at 166.2 ​eV and 165.1 corresponding to sulfur bonding environment with a spin-split doublet, S 2P1/2 and S 2P3/2. This confirms the successful grafting of sulfonic acid groups onto the polymer [51]. Pd 3d spectra of the Pd NPs on CTP (Fig. 4 (c)) is resolved into two spin-orbit pairs with 3d3/2 binding energies of 340.1 ​eV and 338.2 ​eV, and with 3d5/2 binding energies of 335.2 ​eV and 333.1 ​eV, respectively. This suggests that employed loading conditions favor complete reduction of Pd2+ and metallic Pd (0) is bound to the nitrogens of CTP [52,53]."
10,Catalytic results of CTP-SO3H/Pd,"The characterization results suggest that the bifunctional CTP-SO3H/Pd consisting of metal/acid active sites is successfully constructed through Friedel-Crafts reaction followed by stepwise functionalization. It is apparent that this polymer made of metal/acid bifunctional sites can perform as a bifunctional catalyst in one pot hydrogenation esterification reaction in which the metal nanoparticles serve as hydrogenation sites and sulfonic acid groups act as esterification sites. To investigate the catalytic activity of the developed catalyst, the conversion of p-nitrobenzoic acid to benzocaine was chosen as a model reaction. For this, the reaction was carried out under optimized conditions with 1.2 ​mmol of 4-nitro benzoic acid, 40 ​mg of catalyst, 0.1 ​MPa H2, 5 ​mL of ethanol, and at 80 ​°C for 8h. Under these conditions, catalyst screening tests were also carried out to explore the role of two active sites. The reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst or in the presence of CTP, CTP/Pd, CTP-SO3H and CTP-SO3H/Pd. The catalytic results of all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . In the absence of catalyst, no reaction occurred. The reaction was carried out using bare CTP without any functionally active sites and as expected, there was no reaction. Only the hydrogenated product 4-aminobenzoic acid (Pb) was obtained when CTP/Pd was used as catalyst. The CTP grafted with sulfonic acid groups (CTP-SO3H) yielded the esterified product 4-nitrobenzoate (Pc) with 98% selectivity. To our delight, when both Pd NPs and sulfonic acid groups are embedded into CTP (CTP-SO3H/Pd), the target product ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (Pd) is obtained with 98% selectivity. This demonstrates that for the OHE reaction the Pd NPs and sulfonic acid groups should be adjacent to each other. Thus, sulfonated CTPs form the basis for multisite catalysts, containing both basic coordination sites for metal nanoparticles and surface acidity within one sole system. The triazine rings in CTP framework not only stabilize the loading of metal nanoparticles but also restrict metal agglomeration and subsequent deactivation [54]. The effect of reaction parameters such as amount of catalyst and temperature were studied for the OHE reaction to optimize the reaction conditions. For this 1.2 ​mmol of 4-nitro benzoic acid in 5 ​mL of ethanol was taken and the OHE reaction was carried out for 8 ​h under 0.1 ​MPa H2 at different temperatures and by varying the catalyst amount. The results of effect of amount of catalyst on % yield and conversion of OHE using CTP-SO3H/Pd is shown in Fig. 6 . The yield and conversion were low when minimum amount of the catalyst was used. When the amount of catalyst was gradually increased, the yield and conversion were also increased due to increase in the number of catalytically active sites. A maximum yield and conversion of 94% and 95% were achieved when the amount of catalyst added was 40 ​mg. No change in the yield and conversion were observed when the amount of catalyst was increased to 50 ​mg. The effect of temperature on OHE reaction was investigated under the same reaction conditions with 40 ​mg of catalyst (Fig. 7 ). The reaction temperature was gradually increased from room temperature to 80 ​°C. From the results, it is evident that low temperature does not have any significant effect on the OHE reaction. When the temperature was increased to 80 ​°C, maximum yield and conversion of 96% and 97% were achieved. The above studies show that the hydrogenation is faster compared to esterification and the latter is the rate determining step. Increase in the amount of catalyst and temperature favors the esterification step. The conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to benzocaine can occur through two routes as follows (i) hydrogenation followed by esterification in which p-aminobenzoic acid is the intermediate; (ii) esterification followed by hydrogenation in which ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate is the intermediate . With the objective of knowing the actual catalytic mechanism of this conversion using CTP-SO3H/Pd, the yield–time curves of products were obtained (Fig. 8 ). The yield of esterified product Pc was found to be lower than the hydrogenated product Pb throughout the catalytic reaction (i.e.) hydrogenation is kinetically faster and esterification is slower and rate determining step. The reaction produced 19%, 9% and 4% of Pb, Pc and Pd respectively with a total conversion of 35% at 1 ​h. The yields of intermediates Pb & Pc first gradually increased and then decreased with time. When the reaction was continued, the yield of target product Pd and total conversion continuously increased with time. Maximum yield of target product Pd and total conversion of 95% and 94% were obtained at 8 ​h of reaction time. Thus the optimum reaction conditions for the OHE reaction are 4-nitro benzoic (1.2 ​mmol), ethanol (5 ​ml), and CTP-SO3H/Pd catalyst (40 ​mg) at 80 ​°C for 8 ​h under 0.1 ​MPa H2. The product yield –time curves also show that the yields of intermediates Pb & Pc are low throughout the reaction which prove that hydrogenated or esterified intermediate immediately undergoes subsequent reaction by adjacent catalytically active sites to give the target product Pd. To test the generality of the present reaction, 2-nitrobenzoic acid and 3-nitrobenzoic acid were subjected to OHE under optimized conditions. These molecules produced the corresponding 2-aminoethylbenzoate and 3-aminoethylbenzoate with 94% and 97% GC yield owing to the remarkable catalytic activity of CTP-SO3H/Pd. It is worth mentioning that irrespective of the position of the reaction sites, the bifunctional catalyst smoothly transformed the substrates to the corresponding target product in high yields. A plausible reaction mechanism for one pot hydrogenation-esterification of para nitrobenzoic acid to benzocaine is proposed keeping in mind the previously reported literature [55–58]. As illustrated in Scheme 3 , a two step mechanism is proposed in which the first step is hydrogenation followed by esterification. The first step hydrogenation begins with the adsorption of H2 on the surface of Pd as H+ and H−. These are subsequently added to electron rich oxygen and electron deficient nitrogen respectively resulting in the formation of para nitrosobenzoic acid with the elimination of water molecule. Successive addition of the adsorbed H2 on the surface of Pd to nitrosobenzoic acid leads to the formation of para aminobenzoic acid. The second step esterification is catalyzed by the sulfonic acid groups of CTP, in which initially a proton from sulfonic acid group is taken up by the carbonyl oxygen making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Then ethanol is added to the reaction mixture which attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. Elimination of water molecule from the intermediate followed by abstraction of a proton by SO3 − ion leads to the formation of the final product benzocaine and the catalyst is regenerated. The reusability of CTP-SO3H/Pd catalyst for OHE reaction was also examined under optimized reaction conditions as shown in Fig. 9 . It was found that the catalyst could be reused atleast for five runs with only a minor loss of activity. In the first run, the yield was 95%, and for consecutive runs the yield decreased gradually owing to Pd agglomeration/leaching. Moreover, the catalyst was easily separable by simple centrifugation. This shows that the catalyst is stable enough for reuse and storage."
11,Conclusion,"A heterogeneous, bifunctional CTP-SO3H/Pd catalyst was prepared by simple Friedel-Crafts reaction followed by post-synthetic introduction of sulfonic acid groups and palladium nanoparticles. The characterization of the developed catalyst using XRD, TEM, elemental analysis, N2 adsorption desorption studies and XPS revealed that the material was porous and successfully incorporated with functionally active sites. CTP-SO3H/Pd exhibited good catalytic activity with 94% yield and 95% conversion to the target product in the tandem OHE reaction. The cooperative effect of functional acidic and metal sites at juxtapositions on the heterogeneous support achieved the activation of hydrogenation-esterification reactions. The catalyst was stable, reusable and easily separable by simple centrifugation. Extending the scope of application, this bifunctional catalyst is expected to open new opportunities and broad range of utility in tandem OHE reactions."
