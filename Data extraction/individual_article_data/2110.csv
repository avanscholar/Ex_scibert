0,Introduction,"Amines are important chemicals that are widely used as agrochemicals, dyes, polymers, pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. One-pot alcohol amination is considered to be an efficient and straightforward method for sustainable production of secondary and tertiary amines [1]. Starting from an alcohol, first its catalytic dehydrogenation occurs to form a more reactive carbonyl compound followed by its interaction with an amine resulting in imine formation. Finally, hydrogen subtracted from the alcohol during the first step is consumed to give the final amine. Biomass-based alcohols such as terpenoids posses a great potential as a starting material in production of efficacious chemicals needed for human disease prevention and therapy [2–5]. At the same time utilization of terpenoids can cause side reactions due to their high reactivity [6–16]. One-pot alcohol amination have been actively studied in the presence of various heterogeneous catalysts [1] including Ru [17], Pd [18], Ag [19,20] and Au [21–23], with predominant utilization of benzyl alcohol and aniline as starting substrates. Benzyl alcohol substitution by unsaturated monoterpenoid allows synthesis of more perspective compounds in terms of their biological activity, but leads to competitive hydrogenation of the reactive CC and CN bonds. In the current work Au/ZrO2 catalyst was used for monoterpenoid myrtenol amination with aniline, which have previously been shown to promote the amination pathway rather than side reactions such as reduction of the reactive CC group of myrtenol by hydrogen formed in the first step (Fig. 1 ) [24–26]. The amine with the preserved CC bond was mainly considered to be the desired product of controlled hydrogenation, despite the interest to the synthesis of both saturated and unsaturated amines starting from the same initial biomass-derived myrtenol. Thus, well-known low hydrogen-delivery rates of Au catalysts compared to other noble metals seem to be an advantage in the case of terpenoids amination. Latter can allow selectivity control in the case of substrates possessing several functional groups which can provoke competitive hydrogenation. Herein the study was focused on the improvement of the hydrogen transfer to produce the desired amine, since the imine accumulation was detected in the case of myrtenol amination due to competitive CC bond hydrogenation and/or insufficient hydrogen formation on the surface of gold particles as a result of non-specific myrtenol dehydrogenation involving both support active sites and gold nanoparticles [24,27,28]. In our previous work it was demonstrated that introduction of additional external molecular hydrogen in the presence of Au/ZrO2 catalyst permitted a more effective hydrogen transfer with enhanced yield of the target amines [29]. Hydrogenation of either CN bond or both CN and CC bonds in the presence of Au/ZrO2 catalyst occurred depending on timing of external hydrogen introduction or reaction temperature [29]. However, application of molecular hydrogen as an external H-donor undermines the apparent advantage of one-pot alcohol amination to perform the reaction in the absence of external molecular hydrogen. As a continuation of our previous study on hydrogen introduction [29], application of more safe and often more readily available in fine chemicals industry hydrogen sources such as alcohols or formic acid aiming at an increase of the process efficiency is considered to be of great interest. Indeed, it was shown that gold catalysts can provide efficient catalytic performance in different transformations utilizing transfer hydrogenating agents [30–32]. Therefore, in the current study the effect of alcohols and formic acid as external hydrogen sources on one-pot myrtenol amination with gold catalysts was explored for the first time."
1,Experimental/methodology,
2,Catalysts preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalysts preparation and characterization The same samples of Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3 catalysts described in detail in our previous work were used [24]. Commercial monoclinic ZrO2 and Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar) with surface area 110 and 136m2/g, pore volume 1.21 and 0.21cm3/g and pore diameter 6.6 and 5.4nm, respectively, were selected as supports. These supports in the powder form with the particle size below 40 μm to eliminate intraparticle mass transfer limitations were used for the catalysts preparation. Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3 catalysts (3wt.% according to ICP) were synthesized by deposition-precipitation technique using HAuCl4 (Alfa-Aesar) as a gold precursor and urea as a precipitating agent similar to the procedure described elsewhere [33]. In order to remove the excess of chloride after gold deposition, the samples were washed with a solution of NH4OH (pH ca. 10), as in [34,35]. Thereafter the catalysts were washed thoroughly with deionized water, filtered and dried at room temperature for 24h. Before the catalytic tests, the samples were oxidized in air flow increasing temperature to 350°C with a ramp rate of 20°C/min. The prepared Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3 catalysts were analyzed with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Varian Liberty 110 ICP Emission Spectrometer. Specific surface area and porosity of the samples were determined with BET method by physisorption of nitrogen in Tristar II 3020 Micromeritics equipment. Prior to the measurements, the samples were treated in vacuum (0.05mbar) at 350°C for 12h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL 2010 microscope. Before TEM measurements the samples were dispersed in isopropanol and dropped on a copper grid coated with a carbon film. To estimate the value of a mean diameter of Au nanoparticles more than 250 particles were counted. The mean diameter (d m) of particles was calculated using the following equation: d m = ∑ i ( x i d i ) ∑ i x i , where xi is the number of particles with diameter di . The electronic state of gold species was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Kratos AXIS 165 photoelectron spectrometer using monochromatic AlKα radiation (hv=1486.58eV) and fixed analyzer pass energy of 20eV. All measured binding energies (BE) were referred to the C1s line of adventitious carbon at 284.8eV. The spectra fitting were done using Shirley background estimation over the energy range of the fit."
3,Catalytic experiments,"2.2 Catalytic experiments Liquid-phase (−)-myrtenol amination was performed in a stainless steel reactor, equipped with an electromagnetic stirrer (1100rpm) and the sampling system. A mixture of (−)-myrtenol (1mmol), aniline (1mmol) and the catalyst (92mg) in toluene (10ml) was typically used. Different amounts of methanol, 2-propanol and formic acid were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was performed at 180°C under N2 atmosphere (9bar). Dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-yl(methyl)aniline (imine (1)) synthesized as described in [24] was hydrogenated using 1mmol of the substrate, 1mmol of 2-propanol and 92mg of Au/ZrO2 catalyst in 10ml of toluene at 180°C under N2 pressure (9bar). The measurements of catalytic activity were performed in the kinetic regime. The impact of internal diffusion was determined through estimation of the Weisz-Prater criterion [25]. The impact of external diffusion or in other words mass transfer limitation through the liquid-solid interface was evaluated by the corresponding criterion calculation [36,37]."
4,Product analysis,"2.3 Product analysis Aliquots were withdrawn from the reactor at appropriate time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography using a SLB–5ms column (length 30m, inner diameter 0.25mm and film thickness 0.25μm, gas carrier He, 40ml/min) and a flame ionization detector operating at 300°C. Additionally the products structure was confirmed by analysis with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Agilent 7000 GC/MS Triple Quad, HP-5MS column) as well as 1H and 13C NMR. 1H- and 13C NMR spectra: Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer (500.13MHz (1H) and 125.76MHz (13C)) in CDCl3 solutions of the substances; chemical shifts δ in ppm rel. to residual chloroform [δ(H) 7.24, δ(C) 76.90ppm], J in Hz. The structure of compounds 1 and 4 (Fig. 1) was established in our previous work by 1H and 13C NMR [24]. Amine (2) was earlier described in [38]. Trans- and cis-isomers of amine (4) were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR. NMR and HR–MS data of compounds (trans-(4) and cis-(4)) were presented in [27]. The selectivity to a certain product was calculated by dividing the yield of this product with the total yield of all products. Maximum yield of amine (2) obtained during the reaction was determined as a maximum in the amine yield dependence on the reaction time."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Alcohols as external hydrogen sources,"3.1 Alcohols as external hydrogen sources Different external hydrogen sources, including methanol, 2-propanol and formic acid, were used to promote CN bond hydrogenation within one-pot myrtenol amination over supported gold catalyst and, thus, to increase the yield of the target amine. Alcohols, such as methanol and 2-propanol, were selected based on the article of some of the present authors [39]. According to the scheme presented in Fig. 1, depending on the reaction conditions CC hydrogenation may result in myrtanol, myrtanal, imine (3) and amine (4) formation along with the target transfer of hydrogen to CN bond leading to amine (2). The same Au (3 wt. %)/ZrO2 catalyst with gold particle size 2.5nm, selected previously as an optimal one [24,26], was used at the first step in the current study. Detailed Au/ZrO2 catalyst characterization was presented earlier in [24]. The catalytic activity (Fig. 2 ) and selectivity to the reaction products obtained using different external hydrogen sources were compared. Typically, the reaction was carried out using the equimolar amounts of myrtenol (1mmol) and aniline (1mmol) under nitrogen pressure. Alcohols excess in the case of both methanol (25mmol) and 2-propanol (13mmol) resulted in at least two fold decrease of myrtenol conversion (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile the product formation was different. Methanol addition increased an impact of initial myrtenol hydrogenation to myrtanol along with formation of both amines (2) and (4) in a slightly higher yield (Table 1 ). In principle formaldehyde formed during methanol dehydrogenation can also react with aniline, but these products were not detected by GC-MS in the reaction mixture. Note, that amine (2) with the preserved CC bond was considered to be the target product of controlled hydrogenation, despite the interest to the synthesis of both amines (2) and (4) starting from the same initial biomass-derived myrtenol. At the same time, equimolar addition of methanol did not influence both myrtenol conversion and selectivity apart from an initial increase of CN bond hydrogenation. In the case of 2-propanol its excess profoundly affected the dependence of selectivity to amine (2) on myrtenol conversion (Fig. 2b). Under the reaction conditions over Au/ZrO2 catalyst, 2-propanol was converted to acetone followed by isopropylaniline formation observed in the reaction mixture by GC-MS. During myrtenol conversion selectivity to amine (2) decreased due to CC bond hydrogenation leading to amine (4), myrtanol (Table 1) as well as formation of the side product of acetone interactions with aniline, such as isopropylaniline, with the yield of about 26%. Amine (4) was mainly produced during the experiment with the ratio between trans- and cis-isomers being about 1.6 (diastereomeric excess 22%). A decrease of 2-propanol amount in the reaction mixture up to molar ratios of 2-propanol/myrtenol=0.5–1.5 was more efficient in terms of amine (2) production while maintaining a similar catalytic activity (Fig. 2a, b). During the reaction, selectivity to amine (2) generally increased along with a low impact of CC bond hydrogenation and formation of a side product − isopropylaniline. At the same time, variations of selectivity to amine (2) with myrtenol conversion were shown to depend on 2-propanol amount (Fig. 2b, Table 1). For molar ratios of 2-propanol/myrtenol=1.0–1.5 the CC bond hydrogenation was more noticeable at myrtenol conversion higher than 85% leading to the selectivity decrease (Fig. 2b). When a larger amount of 2-propanol was added to the reaction mixture, a faster decline of selectivity to amine (2) was observed. This can be explained by excessive hydrogen formation leading to consecutive hydrogenation of the CC bond in the amine (2) structure. The highest yield of amine (2), achieved during the reaction in the presence of 1mmol of 2-propanol, was 62% which is 10% higher compared to the previously obtained one, whereas only 55% was maximally obtained at the molar ratio of 2-propanol/myrtenol=1.5 (Table 1) [24]. At the same time in the presence of 0.5mmol of 2-propanol the selectivity to amine (2) increased along with conversion and as a result the yield of amine (2) reached 68%. Note that in the case of the molar ratio of 2-propanol/myrtenol=1.0 and 1.5 a maximum yield of amine (2) was achieved at myrtenol conversion being 95 and 84%, respectively, because of the side CC bond hydrogenation (Table 1). For 0.5mmol of 2-propanol the highest yield was obtained at complete myrtenol conversion (Table 1). To explore regularities of imine (1) hydrogenation by the hydrogen donor the reduction of imine (1) was studied using 2-propanol in an equimolar amount (1mmol). It was unexpectedly found that imine (1) hydrogenation over Au/ZrO2 in the presence of 2-propanol did not proceed most likely due to the fast catalyst deactivation. Indeed, recently imine oligomerization/polymerization was demonstrated to result in the catalyst deactivation [25], while molecular hydrogen addition inhibited this process [27,40]. Imine (1) hydrogenation at 180°C using molecular hydrogen (1bar partial pressure) over Au/ZrO2 catalyst was earlier shown to occur via consecutive hydrogenation of the CN bond followed by CC bond saturation reaching the complete conversion in about 3h, confirming the role of hydrogen in preventing the catalyst deactivation [29]."
7,Formic acid as external hydrogen source,"3.2 Formic acid as external hydrogen source In addition to alcohols, formic acid was also used as a hydrogen donor. Hydrogen production from formic acid has been actively studied [41,42], even in the presence of the same Au catalysts [43,44]. Note, that catalytic formic acid decomposition gives either hydrogen and CO2 or water and CO. At the same time, hydrogen and CO2 were also reported to be converted to water and CO via the reverse water-gas shift reaction at elevated temperatures [43]. Zacharska et al. showed that the catalytic activity of gold catalysts is sensitive to the support nature suggesting that Lewis acid sites are important for formic acid activation [43]. Interestingly, that volcano-type relationship of catalytic activity on electronegativity of the metal ion in the support was observed indicating a dependence of the catalytic activity on the acid-base properties of the support. Au/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity and almost CO-free hydrogen production in formic acid decomposition compared to other metal oxides such as ZrO2, CeO2, La2O3, MgO [43]. In case of one-pot alcohol amination to the target amine (2) the best catalytic performance was obtained in the presence of Au/ZrO2 catalyst [24]. Based on a plausible reaction mechanism zirconia was proposed to allow a more efficient alcohol activation on the basic sites along with an adequate aniline adsorption [24]. Focusing on one-pot alcohol amination as the main reaction, Au/ZrO2 was first selected and tested in the reaction despite mediocre catalytic activity in formic acid decomposition per se. Presence of formic acid in equimolar amounts led to a significant decrease in the catalytic activity (Fig. 2a) most likely due to a strong adsorption of formic acid and/or the decomposition products (CO and CO2) on the support basic sites which are required for initial alcohol activation [24,43]. Selectivity to the target amine (2) slightly increased at myrtenol conversion up to 40%, thereafter the reaction led to predominantly amine (4) formation with the saturated C-C bond. A gradual decrease of formic acid amount to 0.74mmol restored the catalytic activity, influencing selectivity to amine (2) to a minor extent due to CC bond hydrogenation resulting in amine (4) as well as myrtanol formation (Fig. 2c, Table 1). Utilization of lower formic acid amount (0.5mmol) led to the decrease of the initial reaction rate (1.3 fold) compared to the experiment without any additive. Selectivity to the target amine (2) increased along with conversion (Fig. 2c), whereas a more prominent influence of the product with the C-C bond was detected at a nearly complete myrtenol conversion. Compared to 2-propanol slightly lower yield of amine (2) was achieved using formic acid with the maximum value being ca. 64% because of faster consecutive CC bond hydrogenation (Table 1). To diminish the impact of the CC bond hydrogenation 0.25mmol of formic acid was used, leading to only a minor increase in the yield of amine (2) to 65% (Table 1). It is worth to note that the pattern of selectivity to amine (2) as a function of myrtenol conversion was different for 2-propanol (0.5mmol) and formic acid (0.5mmol) being most likely determined by kinetics of their decomposition/dehydrogenation over Au/ZrO2 catalyst. This will influence the target reaction for example in terms of competitive adsorption of the substrates. In general a slower CN and CC bonds hydrogenation occurred in the case of 2-propanol allowing the control of the desired amine formation. As mentioned above, Au/Al2O3 was found by Zacharska at el. to exhibit the highest activity in formic acid decomposition among other gold catalysts supported on metal oxides [43]. At the same time Au/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a slightly lower activity and selectivity compared to Au/ZrO2 in one-pot myrtenol amination [24]. In the current study, the same sample of Au (3wt. %)/Al2O3 catalyst with gold particle size 2.6nm was tested in myrtenol amination using 0.5mmol of formic acid to compare the catalytic performance of both Au/ZrO2 and Au/Al2O3 catalysts. Interestingly, in this case formic acid addition resulted in significantly lower catalytic activity in one-pot myrtenol amination compared to Au/ZrO2 catalyst. After 7h only 30% of myrtenol was converted compared to 89% in the absence of formic acid reported in [24]. Selectivity to amine (2) did not exceed 44% in the presence of formic acid. Prominent formic acid decomposition and blocking of basic sites by strongly adsorbed species seems to suppress the desired reaction. Zirconia supported gold catalyst being relatively less active in formic acid decomposition was more effective for one-pot myrtenol amination using the hydrogen donor. Compared to the tested here hydrogen donors, molecular hydrogen on the one hand led to selective amine (2) formation with preserving CC bond only in the case when molecular hydrogen was introduced after complete myrtenol consumption at a lower temperature of 100°C, giving a maximum yield of amine ca. 68% [29] similar to 2-propanol. Molecular hydrogen addition at the beginning of reaction at 180°C led to fast selective formation of amine (4) with the saturated CC bond [29]. Based on that, utilization of 2-propanol or formic acid as a hydrogen donors seems to be more efficient and safe for predominant CN bond hydrogenation over Au/ZrO2 catalyst during myrtenol amination. At the same time, different approaches might be required depending on the substrates structure."
8,Conclusions,"The promoting effect of different hydrogen donors and their amount on the regularities of one-pot myrtenol amination was studied with the aim to improve the hydrogen transfer within the process and to increase the yield of the desired amine. It was demonstrated, that application of 2-propanol allowed an increase of selectivity to the target amine (2) during the reaction preserving CC bond in the initial myrtenol structure, with maximum yield of 68% being reached at the molar ratio of 2-propanol/myrtenol=0.5 compared to 52% in the absence of any additive. A further increase of 2-propanol amount led to a more noticeable CC bond hydrogenation as a result lowering the yield of amine (2). Application of methanol was in general not efficient in terms of the desired amine yield independent on the additive amount, with the reaction rate decreasing ca. five fold in the case of methanol excess. Contrary to alcohols as hydrogen donors, formic acid in equimolar amounts resulted in a significant activity decrease of Au/ZrO2 catalyst due to strong adsorption of formic acid as well as of decomposition products on the support basic sites, required for the initial alcohol activation. A decrease of the formic acid amount to 0.25-0.74mmol improved catalytic activity compared to an equimolar case, whereas the selectivity to amine (2) increased only at the molar ratio of formic acid/myrtenol=0.25 and 0.5 due to less profound CC bond hydrogenation at lower formic acid amount. Introduction of formic acid (molar ratio of formic acid/myrtenol=0.25–0.5) elevated the target amine (2) yield, with the maximum of ca. 64–65% reached at a nearly complete myrtenol conversion. Thus, introduction of the hydrogen donors, such as 2-propanol and formic acid, in appropriate amounts during one-pot alcohol amination is an efficient approach to enhance the yield of amine by generating additional hydrogen required for CN bond hydrogenation. Generally, hydrogen formed during 2-propanol dehydrogenation and formic acid decomposition over gold catalyst allowed controlled hydrogenation of CN preserving the CC bond without addition of external molecular hydrogen. In the case of 2-propanol slower hydrogenation resulted in less products with the saturated C-C bond at the expense of the containing unsaturated CC bond amine."
