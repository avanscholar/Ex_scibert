0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is one of the most important gases in the chemical industry. It is not only essential in the refining industry and organic synthesis, but also in the production of methanol and ammonia [1]. Nowadays, hydrogen is mainly produced by steam reforming of methane, partial oxidation processes or coal gasification [2]. The vast reserves of hydrogen are present in sea water, but an enormous amount of energy would be required to set free hydrogen from the water molecules. In recent years, several hydrogen production methods have been explored and developed. They include dry reforming reaction, or thermo catalytic decomposition of methane or other organic compounds, namely VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Along with VOCs (that contain a considerable amount of CH4), industries also produce large amounts of CO2 which is a well-known greenhouse gas and its emission is steadily increasing every year. Both harmful gases i.e. CH4 and CO2 could be utilized and hence abated simultaneously, thanks to dry reforming reaction. This is the reason why dry reforming reaction has been intensively studied focusing on the utilization of CO2 and its conversion into useful products, such as syngas which is a gas mixture of CO and H2 [3–5]. In past years, growing interest in the use of supported nickel catalyst for the dry reforming reaction was observed. In this regard, one of the most popular supports is alumina, which is also commercially used as a support for industrial catalysts for steam reforming of methane [3]. Commercial Ni/Al2O3 has the disadvantage of low fouling resistance, due to the absence of steam, which when dosed in stoichiometric excess, can suppress the formation of carbon deposits in steam reforming [6]. Besides Ni/Al2O3, bimetallic (NiCo) catalysts deposited on silicon carbide [7], or natural material such as Olivine [8] or Dolomite [9] were also used. Dry reforming of methane is strongly endothermic reaction, which in fact consists of more than twenty intermediate reactions steps [10], but for easy understanding it could be described by three intermediate stages (Eq. 2–4): (1) C H 4 + C O 2 → 2 C O + 2 H 2 , Δ H 298 = + 247 k J ∙ m o l - 1 (2) C H 4 → C ∗ + 2 H 2 (3) C O 2 → C O + O ∗ (4) C ∗ + O ∗ → C O The major problem related with dry reforming of methane is the quick deactivation of catalyst due to carbon deposition caused by the active carbon species(C*). The active carbon species are created during decomposition or dissociation of methane or hydrocarbons and are necessary for CO production. However, when these species do not take part in the decomposition of CO2 molecules to produce CO, they stay on the surface of metal catalyst and produce coke. The formation of carbon deposit can be limited using higher reaction temperature (above 900 °C), but such high temperature may result in sintering of metal particles on the catalysts surface. Also, conducting the reaction at such conditions is energy inefficient [11,12]. In addition to increase in reaction temperature, another way of inhibiting carbon deposit is modification of Ni catalyst by a suitable promoter. One of the most popular promoters for reforming catalysts is Ceria. Ceria has redox property thanks to the highly mobile oxygen vacancies in its structure that in this case provide oxygen which reduces the degree of carbon deposit [13]. Besides dry reforming of methane, hydrogen can also be produced by upgrading of organic vapours obtained from biomass pyrolysis [14]. Pyrolysis of biomass results in the formation of different products such as solid residue, liquids, and gaseous compounds. The gaseous fraction mainly consists of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of carbon and steam [15]. These gaseous compounds can be subjected to secondary reactions as follows: (5) C x H y + x C O 2 → y 2 H 2 + 2 x C O (6) C H 4 + 2 H 2 O → C O 2 + 4 H 2 (7) C O 2 + H 2 → C O + H 2 O (8) 2 C O → C + C O 2 It corresponds to steam reforming, reverse water–gas shift and Boudouard reaction. The carbonaceous material as carbon structure of biomass may also undergo a water gas reaction, thereby reducing the amount of solid residue and further amount of the hydrogen is produced: (9) C + H 2 O → C O + H 2 The contribution of each of these reactions in the reaction mechanism strongly depends on the reaction conditions and the type of used catalysts [16]. Despite the relatively high temperature of the process, thermal conversion of biomass and further upgrading of volatile products is an interesting possibility of producing bio hydrogen in the future. Recent works have shown a new way of developing coke-resistant catalysts which can be achieved by the application of carbonaceous support. The carbonaceous supports can be produced by controlled formation of carbon e.g. Carbon Black, Carbon Nanotubes [1]. The advantages of carbonaceous support are low cost, high temperature resistance, tolerance to sulphur and other poisoning compounds and of course decrease of overall CO2 emissions from the process of preparation [17]. Fildago et al. [18] prepared catalyst for dry reforming by depositing metallic Ni on commercial activated carbon. Metallic Nickel is usually prepared by the reduction of nickel oxide, which is created by applying wet impregnation of aqueous solution of nickel compounds (nitrate, acetate) [5]. This route involves an extra step for the reduction of nickel oxide to metallic nickel using hydrogen. Zhang et al. [19] came up with the idea of using the carbonaceous surface of biomass to reduce metal oxides during pyrolysis. Here the main role in reducing nickel oxide to metallic from is played by the high amount of hydrogen, which is produced during microwave pyrolysis, as reported in our previous work [14]. The presence of nickel doped carbonaceous material in microwave pyrolysis process leads to more than twice the amount of hydrogen produced than without Ni. In this regard, the aim of the present work is to develop an efficient and versatile Ni/carbonaceous catalyst for the potential application in high temperature hydrogen production processes. A further aim is to test the synthesized catalyst for dry reforming of methane as well as for upgrading of organic vapours derived from thermal pyrolysis of biomass."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For the catalyst preparation, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) with a purity of 99.99% was used as Ni precursor. As a precursor for carbonaceous support material, raw spruce sawdust with a size fraction 0.63 – 1.25 mm was utilized. In addition, biochar previously obtained from pyrolysis of the same spruce sawdust was employed as radiation absorbent during microwave pyrolysis."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation In a first step, raw spruce sawdust was dried at 110 °C for 24 h. The dry sawdust was then mixed with different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 mol l−1) of aqueous solution of nickel nitrate hexahydrate, stirred for 12 h and filtered. The wet impregnated sawdust samples thus obtained were then mixed with biochar, in the ratio of 1/20. The final mixture was then placed in a flask and inserted into a microwave reactor for pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere. The microwave pyrolysis was performed for 20 min, during which the power of the microwave oven was kept at 440 W for the first 5 min and then increased to 950 W for the next 15 min. During this process, the sawdust was pyrolyzed to produce carbonaceous materials whereas; nickel nitrate was decomposed to nickel oxide which was then reduced in situ to Ni0 using hydrogen that was produced during the pyrolysis of sawdust used. In situ reduction of Ni is possible due to the presence of hydrogen produced by the pyrolysis of sawdust [14]. About 10 wt% of biochar remained in Ni/carbonaceous since it was not possible to separate the microwave absorbent from it. Catalyst samples were marked from Ni-C1 to Ni-C5 thus from the lowest concentration of nickel nitrate to a higher concentration."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The Ni content in the synthesized catalysts was determined through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, performed on SPECTRO XEPOS (Spectro Analytical) using powder method. The samples were analysed by using one-off cuvette and 1 g of sample was used for each experiment. For the elemental analysis of the samples, ultimate analysis was performed on LECO CHSN628 analyser. Phase composition of synthesized catalysts was determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis conducted on Rigaku Smart-Lab diffractometer equipped with D/teX Ultra 250 detector. The source of irradiation was a cobalt lamp (CoKα, 0.15418 nm) operated at 40 mA and 40 kV. To determine the textural properties of biochar and synthesized catalysts, physisorption of nitrogen was performed. For this purpose, a Micrometrics 3Flex analyser was used. The specific surface area (SBET ) was calculated using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory [20]. The mesopore surface area (Smeso ) and the micropore volume (Vmicro ) were also evaluated based on the t-plot method using the Carbon Black STSA standard isotherm. The net pore volume (Vnet ) was determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm. The scanning electron microscopy technique was applied for the study and analysis of the samples surface. For this purpose, a Quanta 450 FEG electron microscope was used. The imaging was performed in secondary and backscattered electron mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 keV."
5,Catalytic activity measurement,"2.4 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic activity measurements of the synthesized Ni/carbonaceous catalysts were performed using two test reactions, namely dry reforming of methane and upgrading of vapours from thermal pyrolysis of biomass. For this purpose, two lab-scale catalyst test rigs were used. The details of the test rigs and the measurement methods are given in detail in the following sections. 2.4.1 Dry reforming of methane The catalytic dry reforming of methane was performed in a lab-scale fixed bed reactor setup for which a quartz glass tube with an internal diameter of 4 mm was used as reactor. The catalyst particles with an average diameter of 0.388 mm were packed in the tube to give a bed length of 20 mm. The catalyst particle size was chosen to ensure the plug flow conditions. For each experiment, 0.1 g of catalyst was packed in the quartz reactor tube. The tube was pre heated to reach the desired temperature using a LAC LT 50/300/13 oven. During the pre-heating step the reactor was kept under constant nitrogen flow with a flow rate of 24 cm3 min−1. Once the desired temperature had reached, nitrogen flow was turned off and the flow of gaseous mixture, CH4:CO2 (1:1) for dry reforming reaction was started. The flow rate of each gas was regulated by using Aalborg GF17 mass flow controllers. The pressure at the reactor inlet was monitored by a manometer and the gas volume at the reactor outlet was measure by a rotameter. The gases at the reactor outlet were collected every 30 min using Tedlar® gas sampling bags and the GC analysis was performed immediately after the sampling. The schematic diagram of the setup is given in Fig. 1 . The temperatures before and after the catalyst bed were measured to determine the true reactor temperature for dry reforming reaction. The decrease in temperature (10 to 20 °C) after the catalyst bed indicated the occurrence of reforming (strongly endothermic) reaction. 2.4.1.1 Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapours The most active catalyst in dry reforming reaction was further tested in catalytic upgrading of vapours produced during pyrolysis of biomass. Here, the experiments were performed in a lab-scale test rig as shown schematically in Fig. 2 . The rig comprised of two reactors connected in series. In the first reactor (diameter – 10 mm, length – 200 mm, power – 1500 W, heating rate about 100 °C/min), biomass (spruce sawdust or cellulose) was thermally pyrolyzed at 500 °C. The pyrolysis vapours produced in the first reactor were then led to the second reactor (diameter – 10 mm, length – 150 mm, power – 700 W, heating rate about 100 °C/min) that contained the catalyst and were heated to 700 °C, where upgrading of pyrolysis intermediates occurred. During each experiment, argon with a flow rate of 15 cm3 min-1 was used as carrier gas. For each experiment, 0.4 g of the feedstock and 0.1 g of catalyst were employed. The gases at the outlet of the second reactor were collected in a gas capture syringe for the GC analysis."
6,Analysis of gaseous products,"2.5 Analysis of gaseous products 2.5.0.1 Dry reforming of methane The analysis of the gaseous products from dry reforming experiments, collected in gas sampling bags, was performed using an Agilent 7890A GC. The GC was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a flame ionization detector (FID) and a micropacked column of the dimensions of 2 m × 0.53 mm. During the analysis, the amounts of CH4, CO, CO2 and H2 were determined. 2.5.0.2 Catalytic upgrading of vapours from biomass pyrolysis The gaseous products formed in pyrolysis as well as in catalytic upgrading of biomass decomposition vapours were collected in scaled metal syringe for the GC analysis. The GC analysis was performed using an Agilent 7820A GC, equipped with a TCD and a packed column of the type Agilent 6Ft 1/8 2 mm Molsieve 5A 60/80 SS. The amounts of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were determined."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Ni/Carbonaceous materials,"3.1 Ni/Carbonaceous materials The results from XRF and elemental analysis are summarized in Table 1 . It was observed that increasing concentration of the Ni precursor resulted in higher amount of Ni that was introduced into carbonaceous materials. Consequently, the content of carbon and other elements decreased. It was noted that the carbonaceous support contained not only carbon but also small amount of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Here, oxygen content for individual samples was calculated to 100 wt%. The XRD spectra of Ni/carbonaceous materials are shown in Fig. 3 . The main phases detected included metallic nickel (Ni0) at 52° and 60.9° and carbon as graphite (C0) at 30.2°. In addition, small refluxes of NiO were also observed. The small peaks at 47° and 55° were Kβ from metallic nickel. Furthermore, magnesium calcite (Mg0.03Ca0.97CO3), which is a common component of biomass ash, was also detected. The Ni crystallite size was estimated using Scherrer equation and the results are given in Table 2 . It was noted that Ni crystallite size in Ni/carbonaceous materials synthesized in the present work is bigger than those reported in literature [21–23]. The XRD results confirmed the observations from XRF analysis. In Fig. 3, it is evident that the intensity of metallic nickel peak increased with increasing nickel content in the carbonaceous support. At the same time, the intensity of graphite decreased. From the peak intensities as depicted in Fig. 3, it is also clear that Ni was present mostly as Ni0 phase, as the peaks corresponding to NiO showed very small intensities. From these observations, it seems that most NiO produced from the decomposition of nickel nitrate was reduced using the hydrogen generated during microwave pyrolysis. This is very interesting for the catalytic application of Ni/Carbonaceous materials in dry reforming or steam reforming reactions, as in these reactions Ni0 plays the role of catalytically active material. For determining the textural properties, the Ni/Carbonaceous and biochar samples were analysed using nitrogen physisorption. The results as shown in Table 3 demonstrate that the fresh biochar (parent carbonaceous material - CM) had large SBET i.e., around 300 m2 g−1. However, this value was considerably decreased after wet impregnation with nickel nitrate and subsequent microwave pyrolysis. Also, a trend of decrease in surface area with increasing Ni content was observed. Furthermore, a decrease in the Smeso was also noted. Nevertheless, it was not as strong as in the case of SBET . The presence of mesopores in catalytic materials is very important for certain applications, as they promote mass transfer around the catalyst surface and allow the penetration of large molecules to active sites on the surface [24]. Also, in Table 3, a decrease in micropore volume with increasing Ni content can be observed. A possible explanation for this effect could be the increased loading of nickel on the surface of carbonaceous material that can lead to pore blocking resulting in decrease of the overall pore volume of the carbonaceous materials. The amount of Ni is relevant for the catalytic applications, but even more important is a uniform distribution of nickel particles on the support surface. Therefore, the synthesized catalysts were analysed using SEM and EDX to determinate the surface distribution of Ni particles. The results obtained for Ni-C2 sample are shown in Fig. 4 . From the figure, it can be seen that Ni particles were well distributed on the surface. However, few large white spots were also visible, indicating the presence of some Ni clusters. Furthermore, the presence of C and O on the surface was observed, which corresponds to the results of elemental analysis as shown in Table 1. The carbonaceous support in Ni/carbonaceous catalyst system showed a very interesting structure and morphology. In Fig. 5 , SEM image of a catalyst particle from the sample Ni-C2 is shown. A highly porous monolithic or honeycomb-like structure can be seen. During the microwave pyrolysis, the removal of volatile organic matter from the saw dust particles led to a porous structure with straight channels. As discussed above, catalytic materials with such a porous structure are good candidates for the reactions which involve large molecules and/or suffer from high mass transfer limitations. On the other side, higher nickel content (Ni-C5) covered the honeycomb-like structure of the carbonaceous catalyst (see Fig. A1 ) that led to lower conversion as compared to the sample Ni-C2."
9,Dry reforming reaction,"3.2 Dry reforming reaction All samples of synthesized catalysts were tested in dry reforming of methane. The experiments were performed at 800 °C, which is considered to be an appropriate temperature for dry reforming [2]. As at this temperature, the side reactions, such as reverse water–gas shift reactions, are thermodynamically suppressed. Each experiment was carried out for 6 h of time-on-stream and average values of methane and carbon dioxide conversions thus obtained are listed in Table 4 . Based on these results, among five samples, the Ni-C2 (with approx. 13 wt% of Ni) was identified as the most active catalyst which allowed for the highest CH4 and CO2 conversion in comparison with others. The composition of the gaseous mixture (CH4, CO2, H2 and CO) as a function of time-on-stream for dry reforming using Ni-C2 is given in Fig. 6 . The results show that during first 60 min, considering the CH4 conversion, a lower H2 content was obtained. On the other hand, increase in CO content was according to the decrease in CO2. This can be attributed to the reduction of remaining NiO on the catalyst surface that used some of the hydrogen produced during this time period. It is worth noting that for the next approximately 3 h, the contents of H2 and CO remained almost constant, thus indicating very little or no deactivation of the catalyst. Only during the last 60 min, a slight decrease in methane and carbon dioxide conversions was observed. Also, from 240 to 300 min, the amount of CO decreased but H2 content remained stable. This indicates that during this period of time, hydrogen produced could leave the catalyst surface; however, the carbon atom remained on the catalyst surface and did not take part in the reaction for CO production. According to the literature [25], this fact is related with the formation of carbon deposits on Nickel surface. Furthermore, in Table 4 it can be seen the conversion of both CH4, and CO2 decreased as the Ni content exceeded 14 wt%. This is probably due to a lower global surface of Ni content due to the formation of larger clusters. This is also clear in the case of Ni-C1 with lower Ni content (hence higher surface area due to less Ni clusters) gives higher conversion i.e. 56% of CH4 and 78% of CO2. However, this was only for a short period of time of approximately 1 h. After that the conversion was dropped dramatically almost to zero. This may be ascribed to the fact that the higher initial methane conversion produced high amount of active carbon species (Eq. (2)) that did not to react with CO2 (Eq. 3–4) and deposited on the catalyst surface, thus clogging the active centres and leading to a rapid deactivation of the catalyst. The influence of the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of Ni-C2 was also studied. For this purpose, catalytic test at 700, 800 and 900 °C were carried out and the results obtained are presented in Fig. 7 . From the results it seems that the highest conversions of CH4 (50%) and CO2 (66%) were achieved at 900 °C. However, increasing the conversion of 7% over a temperature increase of 100 °C is not very energetic. On the opposite, the dry reforming reaction did not occur at 700 °C, they were probably suppressed by the water gas-shift reaction or other reaction. The higher reaction temperature e.g. 1000 °C was not used, because the high energy intensity (at such high temperatures) brings only a small increase in conversion. Li et al. [26] performed dry reforming on Fe rich biomass derived char and conversion at 800 °C was around 90%, but only for 120 min., after that the conversion was drastically decreased. But these high conversions were probably connected with 10 times lower gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) in the reactor as compared to the present studies. Fidalgo et al. [18] used a carbon-supported nickel catalysts and conversion was a little higher as compared to the present study, but again in this case the GHSV significantly lower. Izhab et al. [27] studied dry reforming at low temperatures around 650–750 °C, their conversion was a little higher (approximately 11–17%) at the half of GHSV as compared to the present study. Based on these comparisons with the literature studies that used carbonaceous support, Ni-C2 catalysts seems to be quite competitive. During all experiments, the CO2 conversion was higher than that of CH4. This fact has been reported by other authors too [28,29]. It is mainly explained on the basis of basic centres present on the catalyst surface, where adsorption of CO2 takes place faster than that of CH4. Excess CO2 at active sites could participate in reactions such as the reverse-Boudouard and reverse-water gas shift, consequently higher CO2 conversion is achieved, and higher amount of CO is produced. Please note that the conversions of CH4 and CO2 in the present study are smaller as compared to the ones on Ni-based catalysts reported in literatures [10,30–33]. This is may be attributed to bigger Ni crystallite size on the support surface (approximately from 30 to 90 nm) compared to the literature studies (approximately from 8 to 30 nm)[29]. However, the main advantage of the Ni/carbonaceous catalyst system presented in the present study is its enhanced stability towards deactivation. Furthermore, it benefits from naturally occurring material for its synthesis. To synthesized Ni/carbonaceous catalyst with smaller Ni particle and high Ni content, additional work will be performed in the future."
10,Catalytic upgrading of vapours from biomass pyrolysis,"3.3 Catalytic upgrading of vapours from biomass pyrolysis The composition of gaseous products formed in non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of biomass (spruce sawdust) and cellulose is presented in Table 5 . The efficiency of thermal conversion of both types of the feedstock was low and allowed for production of similar amounts of hydrogen (1.3 and 1.2 mmol g−1 in the case of cellulose and spruce sawdust, respectively). However, the application of Ni-C2 catalyst (which was the most active in dry reforming reaction) resulted in considerable (more than 10 times) increase in H2 content in comparison to non-catalytic process (17.1 and 14.1 mmol g−1 in the case of cellulose and spruce sawdust, respectively). Simultaneously, carbon dioxide and carbon oxide yields increased 2–3 times, while CH4 content remained on the same level. The obtained results indicate that the presence of Ni allows for the production of higher amount of gaseous compounds, which is connected with facilitation of the cleavage of C–C and C-O bonds present in the liquid products of lignocellulosic feedstock decomposition by pyrolysis (i.e. alcohols, phenols, creosols, organic acids). The molecules of hydrocarbons with oxygen derivatives can be easier converted into permanent gas such as H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 [34]. An increase in the hydrogen yield in the case of catalytic process results also from contribution of both steam reforming and water–gas shift reaction, which can proceed in the presence of water molecules formed in the first step of thermal decomposition of biomass [35]. It is worth to mention that an application of Ni/carbonaceous material catalyst allowed to obtain higher hydrogen yield than that observed in the case of the use of Ni supported on a commercial silica, alumina, ceria, Ni/CaAlOx or even bimetallic Ni-Co/SBA-15 [36–38]."
11,Summary and conclusion,"Supported Ni based catalysts were synthesized by using naturally occurring material (raw spruce sawdust) used as precursor for carbonaceous support. Wet impregnation of sawdust with nickel nitrate followed by microwave pyrolysis resulted in Ni/carbonaceous materials that were used as catalyst. During microwave pyrolysis the removal of organic vapours from sawdust led to a honeycomb-like structure of carbonaceous support material in Ni/carbonaceous catalyst system. Thus, adding an advantageous feature to the catalyst that can improve its performance in applications that involve large molecules and/or suffer from mass transfer limitation. The synthesized catalysts were employed in dry reforming of methane as well as in catalytic upgrading of vapours from pyrolysis of biomass. It was demonstrated that the catalyst sample with 13.4 wt% Ni showed good catalytic activity in dry reforming of CH4, giving average conversions of 43 and 58% for CH4 and CO2, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibited good resistance towards deactivation by showing only a slight decrease in conversion after 6 h of time-on-stream. It was shown that the use of catalyst in upgrading of vapours derived from biomass pyrolysis allowed for considerable increase in H2 content in the mixture of gaseous products in comparison to non-catalytic process."
