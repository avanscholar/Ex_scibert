0,Introduction,"CO2 is one of the greatest contributors for greenhouse effect and in the same time it could be considered as a cheap and non-toxic stepping-stone for carbon source synthetic fuels [1–3]. The utilization of CO2 is one of the hotspots no matter in industry or in academy, such as “Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Core Program” in USA, European programs “CCU (carbon dioxide capture and utilization) program”, “ADEME” “2020 Climate and Energy Plan”, “2050 Low Carbon Economy” and numbers of academic studies on CO2 methanation [4,5], CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [6–10], higher alcohols [11,12], gasoline [13], DME [14], liquid fuels [15,16] and so on. Among all investigated metal-based catalysts for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation, Cu-ZnO based catalysts have drawn the highest attention [17–19]. It is generally recognized that Cu° provides active sites for H2 dissociation and ZnO possesses the sites for CO2 adsorption and activation [20]. The presence of Zn is beneficial for the methanol synthesis from CO2-containing sources according to Behrens et al. [21]. The role of physical spacer and the favorable effect on the control of copper sintering behavior has also been demonstrated [22]. The strong metal support interaction (SMSI) between Cu and ZnO is reported to play a crucial role in methanol synthesis. Metastable “graphite-like” ZnO layers was observed during the reductive activation process on Cs corrected transmission electron microscopy [23]. Zn was also pointed out to exist in ZnxO form instead of ZnO during working condition based on the DFT calculation, microcalorimetric experiments and FTIR results [24–26]. To verify the importance of Cu-ZnO interface, Le Valant et al. prepared the nano-core-shell structure of Cu@ZnOx/ZnO with the methanol selectivity of 100 % [27]. In addition, Martin et al. found that the surface enrichment of zinc results in high catalytic activity attributing to enhanced Cu-ZnO interactions, the inhibition of the RWGS reaction and the electronic stabilization of Cu sites against reoxidation by CO2 or H2O [28]. It is well known that CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 is the most frequently used industrial methanol synthesis catalyst using CO/H2 as reactant gas, which attracts a lot of research attention both on the methanol productivity capacity and on the mechanism investigations. While when using CO2 as the carbon source, a large amount of water will accumulate in the reaction system. CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst is not as good catalyst for CO2/H2 as reactant gas due to the strong hydrophilicity and the deficient basic sites of Al2O3. In this work, CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 (CZZ) was chosen as the methanol synthesis catalyst from CO2/H2 feed due to the weak hydrophilicity of ZrO2 in comparison to Al2O3 [6,7,29,30]. Apart from this, the introduction of ZrO2 was also recognized to increase the surface basicity for improving the CO2 adsorption [31]. Even though CZZ itself is already an optimal catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation reaction there exist two crucial factors for a good and stable catalytic performance, such as the copper dispersion over the catalyst surface and the stabilization of copper particles. Considering the generally low specific surface area of ZrO2, another dispersing agent, Al-TUD-1, a sponge-like mesoporous aluminosilicate material, with specific amount of Al could be introduced as a support in order to improve the dispersion and the stabilization of copper active sites. Al-TUD-1 owns large specific surface areas and tunable properties as pore size and acidity [32]. Its derivatives have been used in synthesis of 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane and the reaction of benzaldehyde with n-butanol owing to the acidic property [33]. Due to the good performance as an acid catalyst, the large specific surface area, the low cost and mild preparation technology, in this work Al-TUD-1 is considered as a promising active support for CZZ catalyst for the first time. One important attempt of copper particles stabilization was reported by de Jong et al [34], who employed Stober silica as a support which displayed weak resistance against deactivation. After the silica support was functionalized by aminopropyl, copper dispersion increased and also Ostwald ripening retarded. Considering the Al-TUD-1 acidic nature its large use as a support may be compromised and the catalytic materials containing both Cu-based catalyst and Al-TUD-1 may be recognized as bi-functional. Bi-functional catalysts are not seldomly used in chemistry since dozens of reaction systems and require more than one active site due to the complexity of chemical reactions. Nowadays more and more chemical products are obtained from one-step synthesis rather than multi-steps in the traditional chemical process considering the expenses and the thermodynamic limitations. For example, instead of the traditional methanol dehydration to olefins reaction, Bao et al [35] prepared a bi-functional catalyst ZnCrOx/MSAPO for Fisher-Tropsch synthesis from syngas, with ZnCrOx catalyst to activate CO and H2 and acid sites of MSAPO to perform the CC coupling, resulting in the C2-C4 olefins selectivity up to 80 %. Aromatic compounds with 74 % selectivity were obtained over ZnCrOx/ZSM-5 catalyst from CO/H2 [36]. Wang et al. used Zr-Zn/SAPO-34 hybrid catalyst to obtain C2-C4 olefins (selectivity 70 %) [37]. The mutual interaction of different components in heterogeneous catalyst determines the catalytic performance. Different preparation method of the capsuled catalyst Co/SiO2-M-Z6ET was investigated to achieve low CH4 selectivity and high gasoline (C5-C11) selectivity (72 %) [38]. Apart from the Fisher-Tropsch synthesis reaction, the direct DME synthesis reaction from CO2/H2 is also a classical reaction suitable for the application of bi-functional catalysts. The direct DME synthesis from CO2 is thermodynamically favorable and economically saving compared to the traditional two-step process. The conventional DME synthesis includes 1st step - methanol synthesis reaction on copper-based catalyst (Eq. (1)) and 2nd step - methanol dehydration to DME over solid acid catalyst (Eq. (3)). The reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) is inevitable under the reaction conditions (Eq. (2)), as CO is formed it can also participate to some extent in the formation of methanol (Eq. (4)). (1) CO2 + 3 H2 = CH3OH + H2O (2) CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O (3) 2 CH3OH = CH3OCH3 + H2O (4) CO + 2H2 = CH3OH Herein, a series of hybrid catalysts based on CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 dispersed over Al-TUD-1 support were synthesized using co-precipitation-deposition (cpd) route with changing Si/Al ratio in the support to adjust the acid properties. Additionally, one hybrid material containing both CZZ and Al-TUD-1 was prepared by physical mixing (CZZ&Si/Al-25) for comparison. Different characterization methods were employed, N2O chemisorption, XRD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-IR, XAS, STEM-HAADF and others, to analyze the structural and physico-chemical properties for the prepared materials. To understand the interactions between CZZ and Al-TUD-1 support, DFT calculations were employed together with characterization technics. All the prepared copper based materials were studied in CO2 hydrogenation reaction producing methanol and DME."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Al-TUD-1 Al-TUD-1 materials were synthesized employing a surfactant free technique with one-pot method [32,39]. In a typical synthesis, Al-TUD-1 (Si/Al-25) was synthesized through adding 10.26 g (0.0483 mol) tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98 %, ACROS) to 0.40 g (0.0019 mol) aluminum isopropoxide (98 %, Aldrich) ethanol solution. After stirring around 20 min, mixed 7.42 g (0.0482 mol) triethanolamine (TEA, 97 %, ACROS) and 5.58 g (0.3095 mol) distilled water were added dropwise, followed by addition of 10.59 g (0.0144 mol) tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 20 % wt in water, ACROS). Afterwards, mixture solution was stirred at room temperature (RT) till clear gel obtained. Then the gel was left to dry under 100 °C for 24 h for volatilization of H2O and ethanol, and was placed in autoclave for the following hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 3 h with ramp of 5 °C min−1. The material obtained was calcined at 600 °C for 8 h with ramp of 2 °C min−1. The sample after calcination is abbreviated as S25. Other samples with Si/Al ratios equal to 50, 75 and 100 (respectively S50, S75 and S100) were prepared using the same procedures. 2.1.2 CZZ Co-precipitation method was used to synthesize CZZ with weight ratio of CuO: ZnO: ZrO2 = 37.5: 41: 21.5. In the beginning 4.66 g (0.0189 mol) Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (98 %, Alfa Aesar), 5.97 g (0.0202 mol) Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99 %, Aldrich) and 1.87 g (0.0070 mol) ZrO(NO3)2·6H2O (99.9 %, Alfa Aesar) were dissolved to get 1.0 M metal salts water solution. Apart 8.52 g (0.0800 mol) Na2CO3 was added into the distilled water to prepare 1.6 M solution which is used as precipitating agent. The co-precipitation process was conducted at 60 °C–65 °C and pH 6.0–6.5 (measured by pH HANNA instrument HI-207) under continuous stirring. After the total dropwise addition of the precipitating agent solution, the precipitate was left to age 3 h under stirring, then filtrated and washed with 1.5 L water, then dried under 100 °C for 5 days till complete evaporation of water. After that the sample was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h with ramp of 2 °C min−1. 2.1.3 CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts A series of hybrid catalysts using Al-TUD-1 (with different Si/Al ratio) as support were synthesized by cpd method. The ratio of mCZZ and mAl-TUD-1 was kept equal to 2.3 in all the materials [40,41]. Typically, 48.1 mL of metal salts solution (1.0 M) and 48.1 mL of 1.6 M Na2CO3 solution were prepared beforehand. In the beginning 1.82 g of the previously prepared S25 (particles size in the range of 100−200 μm) was added to 100 mL of distilled water and stirred following by pH adjustment at 6.0–6.5 (HNO3 and Na2CO3 solutions were used for this purpose). The co-precipitation-deposition was conducted as described in the case of pure CZZ. With the particles of the Al-TUD-1 in the initial buffer the formation of the precipitate is firstly happening in the solution with the dropwise addition of the metal nitrates solution and of the precipitating agent and then precipitates are deposited on support. After the total addition of the solutions, the system was left for 3 h aging still under continuous stirring. After that it was filtered and washed with distilled water until conductivity of the filtrate water was close to that one of the distilled water, around 18 μS cm−1 (measured by conductimeter VWR CO 3100 L). Then the sample was dried during 5 days at 100 °C till the complete evaporation of water following by the calcination step at 400 °C for 4 h with the ramp of 2 °C min−1. The obtained hybrid catalyst is abbreviated as CS25. Other prepared hybrid catalysts were abbreviated as CS50, CS75 and CS100. 2.1.4 CZZ&Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts Another hybrid catalyst was synthesized by physical mixing of as-prepared CZZ and S25 together with the weight ratio of 1:1. The final catalyst was denoted as CS25 M."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted on Bruker D-8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in 2 Theta 10-100° with the scan step of 0.02°, step time 0.1 s. Temperature programmed reduction experiments (TPR) were performed on Micromeritics Auto-Chem II 2920. 50 mg material was heated from RT to 500 °C with ramp of 10 °C min−1 under 50 mL min−1 10 % H2 /Ar. Metallic copper surface area was estimated by N2O surface reaction on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus [6]. Prior to the analysis 400 mg of the material is reduced under 10 % H2/Ar flow (50 mL min−1) at 280 °C for 12 h with heating rate of 1 °C min−1 followed by cooling step to 50 °C in Ar flow (50 mL min−1) and 30 min hold for temperature stabilization. Then the sample was treated with 2% N2O/Ar flow (50 mL min−1) for 15 min. As a light oxidant the N2O reacts with the surface metallic copper forming Cu2O and nitrogen. The chemical equation is described as following: 2 C u + N 2 O = C u 2 O + N 2 The effluent gas is analyzed by TCD detector. The amount of N2 formed was calculated according to the integrated peak area of N2. The Cu° surface area was determined based on the produced N2 amount by assuming 1.47 × 1019 Cu atoms per square meter by following equation (where n N 2 is number of moles of released N2, 6.02 * 10 23 is Avogadro number, mcat – masse of loaded catalyst in grams): S C u 0 = 2 * n N 2 * 6.02 * 10 23 1.47 * 10 19 * m c a t Structural properties of the materials were investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption experiments at −196 °C. Firstly, catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 250 °C overnight to desorb contaminants and adsorbed moisture. Specific surface area was determined by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method. Pore volume and pore distribution were estimated using the desorption branch by Barrett- Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Acidity of the prepared materials was characterized by NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Al-TUD-1 materials were heated from RT to 400 °C to purge the surface by He. Afterwards, the temperature decreased to 100 °C and 50 mL min−1 5% NH3/He was introduced for adsorption 8 h. Then it was purged by He for 4 h. The desorption was heated from 100 °C to 750 °C with the ramp of 5 °C min−1. Pyridine-IR study was carried out on a home-made setup and with the record by a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR instrument. Firstly, the tableted sample (20 mg) was heated at 450 °C for supports and 350 °C for hybrid catalysts for 30 min with the ramp of 10 °C min−1 in inert gas flow. During this treatment water and any adsorbed substances are removed. Then the sample was cooled down to RT and the IR spectrum was recorded (A). Afterwards, pyridine vapor was introduced to the sample cell for 5 min. The sample was heated to 150 °C for 30 min with the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to remove the physically adsorbed pyridine. The IR spectrum (B) was recorded at 150 °C. After that the sample was heated to 350 °C (removal of weakly adsorbed pyridine) and 450 °C (observation of strongly adsorbed pyridine) for 30 min and the spectrum after cooling to room temperature was recorded as C and D respectively. The differential spectra (B/A, C/A, D/A) are presented. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope equipped with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) detectors under 200 k eV. The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of Cu K-edge and Zn K-edge of copper based materials were measured on BL14W1 XAFS beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China. The output beam was selected by Si(111) monochromator."
4,Catalyst activity evaluation,"2.3 Catalyst activity evaluation The CO2 thermal hydrogenation reactions were performed in a fixed bed stainless steel reactor at temperatures ranging from 240 °C to 300 °C under 20 bar constant GHSV =10,000 h−1 STP, H2/CO2 = 3/1). Addition of 3.8 vol.% of N2 in the reactants’ mixture acts as internal standard substance for calculations of the activity parameters. Prior to each test, the catalytic material is reduced under pure H2 atmosphere (9.47 mL min−1) at 280 °C with the ramp of 1 °C min−1 at 20 bar for 12 h. Then it was cooled to 100 °C in pure H2 keeping the pressure at 20 bar. Afterwards, H2 in the reaction system was replaced by reactant gases mixture (the initial composition or blank test is studied at this temperature). After the complete stabilization of the mixture gas flow, the temperature was raised to the reaction temperature with the ramp of 1 °C min−1. The gas stream out of the reaction system was analyzed by an online micro-GC (SRA instruments) equipped with two columns (5 Å micro-sieve column to separate H2, N2 and CO; plot U column to separate N2, CO, CO2, methanol and DME) each connected with an individual thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Liquid phase (methanol and water) was collected after 48 h reaction at each of chosen temperatures and analyzed by offline GC (6890 N, Agilent Technologies) equipped with the SolGel-WAX column and FID-detector, an external liquid standard was added (n-PrOH) for the determination of the methanol quantity. For the activity data analysis, the amount of reactants and products were integrated over the entire reaction period at given temperature. For liquid products, the amount of the substance was calculated using n i = m i M i , where n i is the amount of substance, m i is the masse of the product, M i is the molar masse of the product. In the gas phase, the molar flow rate of a substance i was calculated based on the internal standard N2 considering that N2 did not participate in the reactions. For example, the molar flow rate of N2 is F N 2 , the flow rate of substance i can be calculated as following, F i = F N 2 * A i * R i A N 2 * R N 2 in which A i and A N 2 represent the peak area of substance i and internal standard N2; R i and R N 2 represent the response factor of substance i and N2, respectively. The amount of substance n i was calculated by integrating the molar flow rate F i over the duration t R of the experiment, n i = ∫ 0 t R F i d t The CO2 and H2 conversions ( x i ) and products selectivities ( S C H 3 O H , S D M E and S C O ) were determined basing on the total carbon balance of gas and liquid phases as following, x C O 2 = n C i n p r o d u c t s n C O 2 o u t l e t + n C i n p r o d u c t s * 100 % x H 2 = n H i n p r o d u c t s n H o u t l e t + n H i n p r o d u c t s * 100 % S C H 3 O H = n C H 3 O H ( g a s ) + n C H 3 O H ( l i q u i d ) n C i n p r o d u c t s * 100 % S D M E = 2 * n D M E n C i n p r o d u c t s * 100 % S C O = n C O n C i n p r o d u c t s * 100 % The methanol and DME productivities ( P C H 3 O H and P D M E ) were calculated in different units, such as g kgcat −1 h−1 and g gcopper −1 h−1. The methanol and DME productivity in the unit of g kgcat −1 h−1 was calculated as following, P C H 3 O H = n C H 3 O H ( g a s ) + n C H 3 O H ( l i q u i d ) m c a t * t * M C H 3 O H P D M E = n D M E m c a t * t * M D M E The methanol and DME productivity in the unit of g gcopper −1 h−1 was calculated as following, in which ω represents the weight ratio of copper, mcat mass of the catalyst and t represents the total reaction time (around 48 h). P C H 3 O H = n C H 3 O H ( g a s ) + n C H 3 O H ( l i q u i d ) ω * m c a t * t * M C H 3 O H P D M E = n D M E ω * m c a t * t * M D M E"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Physico-chemical properties,"3.1 Physico-chemical properties The structural properties of Al-TUD-1 materials were studied by N2 adsorption-desorption experiment. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms are typical IV isotherms with H1 type hysteresis loop (Fig. 1 a) [32,42,43]. It indicates that Al-TUD-1 materials are mesoporous with a “cylindrical” pore shape, possessing narrow pore distribution varying from 3 to 7 nm (Fig. 1b). The prepared mesoporous materials show relatively high SBET ranging from 610 to 804 m2 g−1 with pore volume in the range of 0.99–1.12 cm3 g−1 (Table 1 ). Only one large peak appearing at 10-30° belonging to amorphous SiO2 was observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) [44]. No diffraction peaks related to Al2O3 phase in any samples was evidenced, even when the Si/Al atomic ratio is equal to 25, suggesting that Al was well dispersed in the network of SiO2. It revealed that all these Al-TUD-1 materials are present in amorphous phase. TEM image of S25 (Fig. S1) confirmed the presence of unordered worm-like pores exhibiting amorphous morphology without any agglomerated Al2O3 particles observed. This result is consistent with the XRD results and previous literature on Al-TUD-1 studies [42,45]. This kind of materials may be considered as a potential support for different metallic catalysts as they show not only very high specific surface area for anchoring the active sites but also a spread system of meso-sized channels for reactants and products transportation in a catalytic system without diffusion limitations. These materials are different from the zeolites or other traditional supports, such as γ-Al2O3, HY, HZSM-5, mordenites, SAPO, MCM [42,46–48], owning the ordered pore structure and presents very clear crystallite diffraction peaks. Al-TUD-1 differs, firstly, by the inexpensive method of synthesis, and secondly, by the easy control of the acidic properties. Acidic properties of Al-TUD-1 were studied by NH3-TPD and pyridine-IR. NH3-TPD profiles of Al-TUD-1 with different Si/Al atomic ratio are displayed in Fig. 1d. The samples show broad NH3 desorption mostly below 400 °C. This indicates that most part of acid sites is with weak or medium acid strength. The total amount of acid sites derived from the integration of NH3-TPD profiles are also shown in Fig. 1d with the unit of mmolNH3 g−1. The quantity of acid sites increases with Al content. The differential spectra obtained in pyridine-IR are shown Fig. 1e and 1f. The bands located at 1545 and 1455 cm−1 are attributed to pyridine molecules adsorbed at Brønsted acid sites (B) and Lewis acid sites (L), respectively [32]. Both S25 and S100 show bands at 1545 and 1455 cm−1 after heated at 150 ℃, which means that they own the both acid sites. After desorbed at 350 ℃, the band at 1545 cm−1 disappeared meaning that both S25 and S100 only own weak Brønsted acid sites. Weak, moderate and strong Lewis acid sites are all present on S25 and S100. The ratio of weak, moderate and strong strength of L and B acid sites, B/L acid sites ratio and the amount of B and L acid sites are shown in Table S2. The strong Lewis acid sites increased from 31 % to 45 % with increasing the Si/Al ratio from 25 to 100, which is consistent with the results from U. Hanefeld et al., where it was shown that the strength of the acid sites is increased with increasing Si/Al ratio [32]. The amount of Brønsted acid sites are 0.085 mmolNH3 g−1 and 0.295 mmolNH3 g−1 for S100 and S25, respectively. The schematic illustration of the incremental Brønsted acid sites on the Al-TUD-1 materials with Al contents increase is shown in Fig. 1g. The pure CZZ catalyst was prepared and fully characterized for the comparison before the fabrication of CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts. The XRD patterns of the pure CZZ and the hybrid catalysts are listed in Fig. 2 a. It can be noticed that CZZ presents crystallite phases with the CuO characteristic diffraction peaks located at 35.7°, 38.8° and the ZnO peaks at 31.8°, 34.6° and 36.3°. The absence of ZrO2 crystalline peaks is most likely due to that ZrO2 is usually present in the amorphous form [49,50]. For hybrid catalysts CZZ@Al-TUD-1, the characteristic diffraction peaks of CuO and ZnO were substituted by one large diffraction peak in the range of 30°– 40° due to the poor crystallinity of CuO and ZnO phases dispersed over the surface of Al-TUD-1 (Si/Al-25). The intensity of this large peak is obviously weakened due to the interaction between metal oxides and the support leading to the better dispersion of CuO and ZnO [51,52]. Considering the textural properties of the pure CZZ material, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms show the H3 type hysteresis loop (Fig. S2), which has been reported in regard to “slit” shape pores [43]. A wide range of pore distribution varying from 10 to 100 nm was observed (Fig. S2), which may probably due to a very fine inter-grain structure [41]. After the coprecipitation-deposition of the CZZ over the Al-TUD-1, two types of pores were observed on the pore distribution graphs for the hybrid CZZ@Al-TUD-1 materials (Fig. 2c). The pore sizes could be attributed to the intrinsic pore structure of Al-TUD-1 centered at 6 nm and the structure of the CZZ material centered at 50 nm [53]. The results reveal that the copper species have not been completely incorporated into the siliceous framework, but deposited on its surface [54]. The surface area of the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts varies from 161 to 203 m2 g−1 (Table 1). H2-TPR profiles of the pure CZZ and the hybrid materials are shown in Fig. 3 a. A main reduction peak emerged at 219 °C accompanied by a small shoulder peak (200 °C) for CZZ. The presence of shoulders indicates the heterogeneous distribution of CuO, such as CuO with different particle sizes [55] or different interactions between copper and a support [30,56]. The reduction behavior of the hybrid catalysts differs in terms of the reduction temperatures of different species compared with the pure CZZ [57]. In general, the hybrid catalysts CZZ@Al-TUD-1 show higher reduction temperature than CZZ. It can be devoted to the fact that small and independent CuO particles are more facile to be reduced than bulk CuO or CuO in strong interaction with the support [50]. It is reported that the incorporation of a promoter and the interaction between CuO and a support play an important part in the reduction behavior [58]. In our catalysts, the interactions between CuO/ZnO, CuO/ZrO2 and CuO/Al-TUD-1 act a part in retarding CuO reduction. Among all the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts, CS25 presents lower reduction temperature 262 °C [58]. Other three CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts show similar reduction temperatures around 300−310 °C. For better comparison of the reduction behavior, the reducibility of prepared materials was calculated assuming that the only reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0) is possible. The reducibility for different copper-based catalysts are presented in Table 2 . The reducibility of the pure CZZ is slightly higher than 100 %, probably caused by additional reduction of ZnO and formation of Cu-Zn metallic alloy in a small quantity. The reduction of the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts is uncompleted; their reducibility is less than 100 %. The incomplete reduction of copper in the hybrid catalysts is probably due to the formation of copper species that are in a very strong interaction with the Al-TUD-1 support to the state that copper could be partly incorporated in the siliceous bulk structure of the support and thus become unavailable for reduction. Assumingly these species difficult to reduce could be in a form of copper silicate formed by the incorporation of Cu into the Al-TUD-1 structure during the synthesis. So this part of CuO is embedded and deeply anchored in the support and thus could not be active for the catalysis. It can be deemed that the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 catalysts possess a better copper distribution and much stronger metal-support interaction than the pure CZZ material. Cu0 characteristic crystalline peaks were observed on the XRD diffractograms of the reduced CZZ and hybrid catalysts (Fig. S3) and the Cu0 crystallite sizes estimated by Scherrer equation are presented in Table 2. The crystallite size of the metallic copper in the pure CZZ material (around 9 nm) is much bigger than that for the hybrid materials (around 5 nm). This confirms the better copper distribution and stronger metal-support interaction for the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts meaning that Al-TUD-1 surely benefiting to the anchoring and dispersing the copper particles. The TGA results for the pure CZZ and the hybrid catalysts combined with the temperature programmed decomposition of the calcined CS25 and the XRD results of the CS25 calcined at different temperatures demonstrated the existence of the high temperature carbonates in the hybrid catalysts and the absence of the high temperature carbonates in the pure CZZ (Figs. S4–S6) which may explain the poor crystallinity of CuO and ZnO in the hybrid catalysts. The lack of ZnO peaks suggests ZnO is well dispersed on the support, which could also be ascribed to the strong interaction between Zn and Cu species and the support preventing the formation of individual ZnO crystallites [51,52,58]. HR-TEM for reduced CS25 with the corresponding FFT is shown in Fig. 3b. Only diffraction points attributed to different planes of Cu° observed in FFT, lattice spacing of 2.09 Å for (111) facet, 1.82 Å for (200) facet, 1.29 Å for (220) facet and 1.10 Å for (311) facet. It is consistent with the XRD results for the reduced samples with the presence of only Cu° characteristic peaks. The enlarged high resolution TEM image for the embedded particle 1 displays the lattice spacing of 2.09 Å attributed to the (111) facet of face-centered cubic phase of metallic copper. In addition, the particle size for several Cu° particles labeled in Fig. 3b are in accordance with the crystallite size calculated from the XRD results. In contrast, the FFT for reduced pure CZZ material presents both diffraction points for Cu° and ZnO (Fig. S7) with the observation of Cu° particles of 14.5 nm and ZnO particles of 8.5 nm and 11.0 nm. These results demonstrate once again the better dispersion of Cu° and ZnO for the hybrid CZZ@Al-TUD-1 materials rather than for the pure CZZ catalyst. Cu° surface is considered as an active site for H2 dissociation, which is a very important factor for predicting the CO2 hydrogenation performance. The measured metallic copper surface area for the pure CZZ and the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts are displayed in Table 2. The value is 11.6 m2 gcat −1 for CZZ, 10.3 m2gcat −1 for CS25 and 5.8 m2gcat −1 for CS50, respectively. The metallic surface area of CS75 and CS100 materials was found under the limit of the developed analysis by frontal N2O chromatography and thus not reliable to precise here (less than 4 m2 gcat −1). The Cu° surface area of CS25 is a little smaller than the one of CZZ owing to the smaller overall copper content in the hybrid catalyst (21 vs 30 wt%, Table 1). So to bring the samples to simpler comparison the copper surface area was computed in the unit of m2 per gram of copper: 38.7 m2 gcopper −1 for CZZ and 49.0 m2 gcopper −1 for CS25, respectively. Thus it confirms once again that copper is better dispersed for CS25 than CZZ. Schumann et al. have already investigated the promotion effect of Al in the support for Cu/ZnO catalysts for methanol synthesis [59]. They have demonstrated that the incorporation of Al increases the defect level of ZnO thus resulting in the improved catalytic performance. Herein the investigation and the explanation of similar Al promoting effect was pushed further considering that the additional presence of ZrO2 may affect the state and the dispersion of copper active sites and not only the defect level of ZnO. In our work Cu° dispersion is 9.2 % for the hybrid CS25material is higher than 5.3 % for the pure CZZ catalyst. This is surely due to the promotion effect of Al in the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalyst that benefits for copper dispersion. HAADF-STEM images were recorded with elemental mapping for the reduced CS25 hybrid material and for the reduced pure CZZ material. Cu and Zn show the same spatial distribution obtained from the elemental mapping of the reduced CZZ material meaning the good dispersed Cu and ZnO species (Fig. S8). HAADF-STEM image with the corresponding elemental mapping and EDS spectra for reduced CS25 are presented in Fig. 4 displaying the coexistence of Cu, Zn, Zr, Si, O and Al. It can be observed that Cu, Zn, Zr and Si are all homogenously distributed in the reduced CS25 sample, this may be caused by the good control of the preparation method conditions that lead to a homogeneous sample and also by the strong interactions between Cu, Zn, Zr and the support (S25) in the final material, thus leading to the better dispersion of Cu and ZnO."
7,Structural origins of Cu species over CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts,"3.2 Structural origins of Cu species over CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts Fig. 5 a shows the Cu K-edge XANES spectra of the calcined CZZ and CS25 materials in comparison with the reference compound CuO, Cu foil and Cu(OH)2. The spectrum of CuO presents the pre-edge absorption peak at 8978.3 eV, which is attributed to a dipole forbidden transition from 1 s to 3d orbital of Cu2+ [60,61].Both CZZ and CS25 presents the pre-edge absorption peak meaning the Cu2+ exists in these samples. Apart from the pre-edge peak, the shakedown like feature at 8986.1 eV attributes to 1s to 4pz features of CuO. The pure CZZ shows the similar XANES spectrum with recognizable CuO revealing that copper species in CZZ are mostly in the state of CuO. While the obvious weakened shakedown like feature for hybrid CS25 material might due to the fact that a part of Cu exists in the form of Cu(OH)2CO3; the similar weakened pre-edge peak in Cu(OH)2 has been reported by Yang et al. [62]. Coordination numbers and bond distances were determined from fitting the magnitude and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform (Table S1). The EXAFS of the CuO, CZZ, CS25 and Cu(OH)2 consist of two shells: the first Cu-O shell and the second Cu-Cu shell [63]. EXAFS Fourier transform results show that these three compounds share the similar Cu-O length. The distinct weakness of intensity of Cu-Cu in the hybrid CS25 material, comparing to CuO, CZZ and Cu(OH)2, might be due to a relative smaller particle size. From the experimental results it may be seen that the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts prepared by coprecipitation-deposition method are superior than the pure CZZ material from several points of view: bigger specific surface area, smaller metallic copper particles size, better dispersion of the copper-based part, higher metallic copper dispersion. Also the reduction of copper is retarded and incomplete after the deposition of the CZZ part which was attributed to a deep incorporation of Cu in the Al-TUD-1 support structure and thus causing more intense metal-support interactions. To have a deeper understanding of Al doping effect on the interactions between copper-based CZZ part and Al-TUD-1 support in the hybrid materials on the molecular level the Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed. In this work, Cu° was predigested as a copper atom [64] for efficiency calculations (Fig. S9). Pure silica was modeled as α-SiO2 [65] saturated by hydroxyl groups on (1 0 0) surface based on Zhuravlev model [66]. 10 Å vacuum height was constructed to avert interactions between slabs. Al-TUD-1 was modeled as Al doped silica, scilicet some tetravalent Si were substituted by trivalent Al [67]. In the calculations, the open source package GPAW was used for the modeling. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and was used with a plane-waves cutoff of 1000 eV. The wave functions are described with the finite-difference approximation (fd) and atom-centered basis-functions (lcao). Different adsorption sites were viewed during calculations: top site, bridge site and hollow site, they are shown in Fig. S10. The adsorption energies (Eads) are calculated as following: E a d s = E S i O 2 + E c o p p e r - E c o p p e r - S i O 2 or E a d s = E A l - S i O 2 + E c o p p e r - E c o p p e r - A l - S i O 2 The adsorption energies of copper with SiO2 and Al-doped SiO2 on the bridge site and hollow site were positive meaning that they are not stable adsorption configurations. The adsorption energies for Cu-SiO2 and Cu-Al-SiO2 of the top site are listed in Table 3 . The distance between Cu and O for the most stable adsorption configuration of Cu-SiO2 and Cu-Al-SiO2 is 2.20 and 1.85 Å. Besides, this distance of 1.85 Å is approaching the Cu-O covalent bond distances estimated of 1.80 Å [68]. The adsorption energy of Cu-Al-SiO2 is around 10 times bigger than Cu-SiO2 revealing that copper shows stronger interaction with Al-doped SiO2 than with the pure SiO2. The DFT results demonstrated that Al in the support introduces copper anchoring sites and promotes the incorporation of copper in the support structure thus increasing the metal-support interaction. From one hand, it explains the reason why the Cu0 surface area increases with the increase of Al content from the molecular view-point. From the other hand, the strong interaction between Cu and the O atom connected with Al will result in coverage of acid sites in the support because the ratio of Cu/Al is much higher than 1 (Table 1) for all hybrid catalysts. This coverage will suppress totally the acidic function of the Al-TUD-1 materials and thus prevent the dehydration of methanol into DME during CO2 hydrogenation reaction, so Al-TUD-1 plays a role of a support for a good dispersion and stabilization of copper-based catalyst. The kinetic diameter of H2, CO2, N2, methanol, water and DME is 2.9, 3.3, 3.7, 3.6, 2.6, 3.6 and 4.3 Å, respectively [69,70]. They are much smaller than the pore size of our CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts whose pore distribution is mainly around 6 and 50 nm. It was supposed that there is no reactants and products diffusion limitations. Furthermore, the cross linked sponge-like pores provide abundant 3D transportation channels for all reactants and products. The XRD results of the calcined hybrid catalysts point out their amorphous phase attributed to the better CuO and ZnO dispersion caused by the intense interaction between CZZ and the support. The better copper dispersion also can be confirmed by the Cu° crystallite size estimated from Scherrer equation for the reduced samples, 11 nm for the pure CZZ catalyst and around 5 nm for the hybrid catalysts. The Cu° nano-domains of CS25 with the lattice spacing of 2.0 Å presented in Fig. 3b is around 5 nm, in accordance with the XRD results of the reduced CS25 (6 nm). DFT calculation results demonstrated that the presence of Al in the Al-TUD-1 support introduces the anchoring sites for copper-based catalyst thus leading to the enhancement of Cu° surface area with the increase of Al content."
8,CO2 hydrogenation,"3.3 CO2 hydrogenation 3.3.1 The influence of Si/Al ratio Three hybrid catalysts were tested in CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The side reaction of the process is RWGS that affects the methanol selectivity (eq.2). The CO2 hydrogenation catalytic results are presented in Fig. 6 . No hydrocarbons and carbon deposit are observed under the chosen experimental conditions. It can be found that CO2 conversion in Fig. 6a for all the catalysts under all the investigated temperatures is lower than the thermodynamic simulation value (Fig. S12), meaning that all the reaction systems work under a prevailing kinetic regime [57]. CO2 conversion and CO selectivity increase with temperature as it is usually expected. The CO2 conversion over CS25 is the highest among the three hybrid catalysts tested. It is probably due to the fact that the CS25 possesses higher Cu° surface area and thus more active sites (Table 2). The CO2 conversion is similar for other two hybrid catalysts. Al weight content for S75 and S100 is 1.3 wt% and 1.0 wt%, respectively. It was supposed that they share the similar metallic copper surface area. More methanol is produced over CS25 with the productivity of 180 g kgcat −1 h−1 (280 °C). The value is the same of 120 g kgcat −1 h−1 for CS75 (280 °C) and CS100 (300 °C). The higher methanol productivity for CS25 is probably due to the higher exposed metallic Cu° surface area (10.3 m2 gcat −1), which is responsible for the efficient methanol productivity via CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Due to the presence of Al and acidic character of the support the dimethyl ether (DME) was also expected in the products. DME may be produced by successive methanol dehydration reaction (eq. 3). Unexpectedly, the selectivity of DME was quite low (<1%) for all the tested hybrid catalysts. From one hand, it pointed out that water have the competitive adsorption on Lewis acid sites with methanol in the methanol dehydration reaction on acid catalyst. In our reaction system, water comes from CO2 hydrogenation to methanol (Eq. (1)), RWGS (Eq. (2)) and methanol dehydration to DME (Eq. (3)) reactions. So water produced affects the DME formation by occupying acid sites for methanol dehydration reaction. From another hand, the unexpectedly low DME selectivity could be explained by the catalyst structural properties studied by numerous characterization technics and by theoretical DFT calculations. Copper is strongly anchored on Al doped SiO2 with adsorption energy of −2.60 eV. The Cu/Al ratio for CS25 is 17 (copper is in large excess comparing to aluminum) implying that copper may block all the acid sites. Though the CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts have low DME selectivity, quite high methanol productivity at low pressure 180 gMeOH kgcat −1 h−1 was obtained at 280 °C and 20 bars for CS25. CO2 hydrogenation at higher pressure (50 bar) were conducted to compare the catalytic performance of hybrid catalyst CS25 and pure CZZ without alumino-silicate support, the results are shown in Table 4 . The CO2 and H2 conversions at 50 bar are higher for CZZ probably due to the higher copper content. The selectivity of CO and methanol is approximately the same for the pure CZZ and the hybrid catalysts indicating the tolerant influence of the Al-TUD-1 support with no DME formation. This result demonstrated that the acid sites for CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalyst are catalytically inactive, blocked by metallic copper or inactivated by the formed water. The productivity in methanol of the hybrid catalyst was found superior to the pure CZZ catalyst in terms of the copper metal present in the material: 1.82 vs 1.37 gMeOH gCu −1 h−1, respectively. This 33 % rise in the intrinsic activity of the active sites is due to the better copper dispersion, smaller metallic copper size and greater metallic copper surface area for the hybrid catalyst, that were obtained by depositing the CZZ over the alumino-silicate support by coprecipitation-deposition method. The absence of DME in the products was supposed due to the altering of the support acidity. In order to investigate the acid properties of the hybrid catalysts, the pyridine-IR for CS25, which owns the highest Al content among the hybrid catalyst, was performed, the result is shown in Fig. 7 . No pyridine adsorption peaks observed clearly demonstrating that all the acid sites were blocked, so Al functions in the support are acting simply as copper anchoring sites but not as acid active sites. In order to understand the microstructure and the chemical state evolution of the hybrid catalyst during reaction, the additional XRD, HRTEM and EELS analyses for the spent CS25 were conducted. The comparison of the XRD patterns for the reduced CS25 and the spent CS25 is shown in Fig. S13. Only the characteristic diffraction peaks for the Cu0 are present for both the reduced CS25 and spent CS25 meaning that the bulk phase of copper still exist in metallic phase after CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Additionally, there is no big change for the crystalline size of Cu0 with the value of 4.6 nm for reduced CS25 and 4.3 nm for spent CS25 meaning that no severe agglomeration for Cu0 particles occurred during reaction and the anchoring over the Al functions in the support is beneficial for improving the stability of such copper-based catalysts. The high resolution TEM images for the spent CS25 with the corresponding FFT are shown in Fig. 8 a. Only diffraction points attributed to different planes of metallic copper are present at FFT, so the crystallized particles in the HRTEM are all metallic copper particles. The shape of the particles is irregular instead of the round metal particles probably indicating the strong interaction between Cu° with ZnO, ZrO2 and additionally with Al-TUD-1 [71]. The particle size is similar with that one for the reduced sample, which is consistent with the XRD results. The IFFT for the particle 1 is shown with the lattice spacing of 2.09 Å ascribed to the (111) facet of metallic copper. To know the chemical state evolution of the catalyst during the reaction, the EELS spectra were recorded. Both the reduced and spent samples display the peaks for Cu L2,3 and Zn L2,3 in the energy loss range of 850 and 1350 eV (Fig. 8b, c). More information for the Cu L-edge for the reduced and the spent samples are shown in Fig. 8d and the Cu L-edge spectra of standard substance Cu, Cu2O and CuO are present in Fig. 8e. Comparing the peak shape of the sample with the standard substance, it can be concluded that the reduced CS25 is in metallic state, while it was partially oxidized during CO2 hydrogenation reaction probably by the reactant CO2. 3.3.2 The influence of hybrid catalysts preparation In order to demonstrate that the hybrid materials based on CZZ and Al-TUD-1 could be promising bi-functional catalysts for the direct CO2 hydrogenation into DME, the composite catalyst containing both CZZ and Al-TUD-1 were synthesized by physical mixing method with mass ratio of 1:1 between CZZ and S25, it was given the code name CS25 M. The catalytic performance of this composite material was studied in the same conditions as before. The catalytic results, namely CO2 conversion, methanol, CO and DME selectivities as well as methanol and DME productivities are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be observed in Fig. 9d that DME was present in the products with the productivity of 41 g kgcat −1 h−1 over CS25 M (260 °C, 20 bar). DME selectivity is 9.2 %, which is much higher than the DME selectivity of the hybrid catalyst CS25 synthesized by coprecipitation-deposition method. The CS25 M hybrid catalyst presents higher CO2 conversion at all the temperatures investigated than the CS25 hybrid catalyst with the same weight ratio between CZZ and S25 (Fig. 9a). Comparing the CO selectivity in Table 4 and Fig. 9b, it can be observed that both catalysts share the similar CO selectivity. So the higher CO2 conversion of CS25 M is probably due to the methanol consumed in methanol dehydration reaction which drives the right shift of CO2 hydrogenation reaction equilibrium. It clearly confirms the blockage of acid sites in the CS25 hybrid catalyst due to the coprecipitation-deposition preparation procedure while they stayed available in the CS25 M prepared simply by physical mixing of two functions. Based on the characterization and the catalytic results, the schematic illustration of CO2 hydrogenation over CZZ&Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts prepared by physical mixing method and CZZ@Al-TUD-1 hybrid catalysts synthesized by coprecipitation-deposition method is proposed in Scheme 1 . For physically mixed hybrid catalyst, exposed acid sites on Al-TUD-1 can dehydrate methanol to DME, methanol is formed on Cu0/ZnO-ZrO2 (CZZ), thus both methanol and DME were obtained as products. While for other one, the acid sites of Al-TUD-1 were totally covered by the deposited CZZ. Only methanol and CO as products in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction can be obtained, no DME was observed. From the DFT calculations it was proved that the acid sites are acting as the metallic Cu anchoring sites."
9,Conclusions,"The amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicate, Al-TUD-1, were synthesized with different Si/Al ratio by facile one-pot synthesis method. The amount of acid sites increases with the decrease of Si/Al ratio. They possess weak, moderate and strong Lewis acid sites and weak Brønsted acid sites. Al-TUD-1 materials were employed in the preparation of the hybrid catalysts CZZ@Al-TUD-1. They were manufactured by co-precipitation-deposition method and physical mixing method and used as catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The influence of the interaction between the copper-based CZZ catalyst and the Al-TUD-1 support on the products selectivity was studied. For the hybrid catalytic materials prepared by co-precipitation-deposition method, Al-TUD-1 is a good copper dispersing support with the formation of small copper crystallite size and controllable metallic copper surface area by adjusting Si/Al ratio. It was evidenced by DFT calculations and pyridine-IR study that the Brønsted acid sites are the copper anchors thus they were occupied by Cu leading mainly to methanol as the CO2 hydrogenation product without dimethyl ether production. Methanol productivity increases with the increase of Al content in the support. For comparison, the bi-functional composite catalyst CZZ&Al-TUD-1 prepared by physical mixing method is catalytically active in the formation of both methanol and dimethyl ether."
