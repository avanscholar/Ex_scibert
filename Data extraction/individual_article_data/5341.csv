0,Introduction,"Long-chain aliphatic alcohols, such as cetyl, lauryl, and stearyl alcohols, are important intermediates for surfactants or plasticizers, which are commercially produced by the hydrogenation of methyl esters or fatty acids [1]. The selective hydrogenation of esters to corresponding alcohols, which generates no waste, is attractive environmentally and economically. However, this reaction is usually accompanied by several side reactions mainly including ester-exchange reaction. To get high alcohol yield, many efforts have been made, mainly focusing on researching for catalysts. The Cu–Cr-based catalysts exhibit high efficiency for the hydrogenation of fatty esters to alcohols under the reaction conditions at 250–350°C and approximately 10–20MPa H2 pressure [2,3]. However, the toxicity of chromium compounds and strong environmental restrictions drive researchers to explore more efficient and less polluting catalysts for ester hydrogenation. Since copper-containing catalysts allow for selective hydrogenation of carbon–oxygen double bond and are relatively inactive in carbon–carbon double bond hydrogenation, they have been used in the hydrogenation of the esters or acids [4]. As one of the best Cr-free catalysts, Cu–Zn-based catalysts are widely applied in the production of natural fatty alcohols [5–7]. In addition, the catalysts based on noble metals such as Ru and Rh have been investigated for the selective hydrogenation of long-chain esters [8–16]. However, to meet the requirements of green and sustainable chemistry, it is still desirable to develop green and efficient catalysts for ester hydrogenation to alcohol with a high alcohol yield. With respect to the supported catalysts, the support usually has significant effects on the performances of the catalysts due to the synergistic effect between the support and the catalytic species. Al2O3 and SiO2 are the generally used supports of the catalysts for ester hydrogenation. For instance, Al2O3 and aluminum pillared clay supported Pt catalysts exhibited enhanced performances for adipate hydrogenation compared to the supports, and the products distribution was very influenced by the surface acidity of the supports [8]. Carbon-based monoliths were applied in immobilizing Pd particles and displayed a superior performance in the partial hydrogenation of methyl esters in terms of the much lower formation of trans double bonds [13]. The clay- or mineral-supported metal nanocatalysts showed good performances in catalysis due to the unique features of the supports. For example, H-mordenite-supported AuPt nanoparticles were discovered to selectively oxidize glycerol directly to glyceric acid without the use of basic conditions [17]; montmorillonite-supported Ru nanoparticles were highly active for benzene hydrogenation [18]; the aluminum pillared clay-supported Pt nanocatalyst displayed high activity for hydrogenation of dimethyl adipate [8]. Diatomite is a siliceous sedimentary rock with a porous structure, low density, high surface area and excellent thermal resistance, and it is readily available and environmentally friendly as well [19]. As a type of widespread natural porous material, diatomite has been widely used as filter aid, catalytic support, and adsorbent. Especially, diatomite-supported catalysts showed promising applications in catalysis [20–22]. In this work, we intend to develop environmentally benign and efficient catalysts for selective hydrogenation of long-chain esters to corresponding alcohols. Diatomite was chosen as catalyst support for the preparation of Pd-based bimetal catalysts, including Pd–Cu/diatomite, Pd–Ni/diatomite, and Pd–Co/diatomite. A series of catalysts with various metal compositions were prepared and characterized in detail by means of different techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic performances of these catalysts for hydrogenations of long-chain esters including methyl palmitate, methyl laurate, and methyl stearate were investigated, focusing on studying the influences of the metal compositions and the supports on reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Methyl palmitate, methyl laurate, and methyl stearate were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company. Diatomite with BET surface area of 85.0m2/g and average size of 400 mesh was provided by Ming Guang Xingxin Mineral Co., Ltd. Other reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were analytic grade and used without further purification."
3,Preparation of diatomite-supported catalysts,"2.2 Preparation of diatomite-supported catalysts The diatomite-supported catalysts were prepared by coimpregnation method. In a typical experiment to prepare the Pd–Cu/diatomite catalyst with the molar ratio of Pd to Cu at 3, 100mg of diatomite powders was dispersed in 10mL of aqueous solution containing H2PdCl4 (0.36mL, 0.02256M) and CuCl2 (0.12mL, 0.02256M). After the mixture was sonicated for 10min and subsequently stirred for 2h at room temperature, 5mL of NaBH4 solution (n NaBH4:n metallic precursors =10, n representing for the moles of the compound) was dropped into the mixture under the intense ultrasonication. The solid was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times, respectively, and dried under vacuum at 60°C for 12h. A series of Pd–Cu/diatomite catalysts with various metal compositions were obtained via tuning the molar ratios of Pd to Cu precursors. Similarly, Pd–Ni/diatomite, Pd–Co/diatomite, Pd–Cu/Al2O3, and Pd–Cu/SiO2 with the molar ratio of Pd to the second metal of 3:1 were prepared."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The phase structure of the as-prepared samples was examined by XRD on a powder XRD diffractometer D/max2500 using CuKα radiation. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were detected on a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan) operated at 200kV and equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300W MgKα radiation. The base pressure was about 3×10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8eV from adventitious carbon. The metal composition in the as-prepared nanocomposites was determined by ICP-AES (VISTA-MPX). The acidity of the diatomite support was evaluated by NH3 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) (TP5080, Xianquan, China). Before the adsorption of NH3, 100mg of the diatomite support was treated under Ar flow with a flowrate of 30mL/min from room temperature to 600°C with 10°C/min, keeping at 600°C for 2h, and then cooled to 120°C; subsequently, a 10% NH3–90% Ar stream was introduced to sweep through the sample at 120°C. The physicosorbed NH3 was eliminated by flowing Ar for 1h at 120°C. The NH3-TPD was conducted from 120 to 600°C at 10°C/min and Ar flowing rate at 30mL/min, and the desorbed NH3 was monitored by an on-line gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector."
5,Hydrogenation of esters,"2.4 Hydrogenation of esters The hydrogenation of esters was carried out in a 6mL stainless steel autoclave under stirring. In a typical experiment to hydrogenate methyl palmitate, the reactor was first loaded with methyl palmitate (0.1g) and catalyst (20mg) together with 1mL of n-heptane. After being purged with hydrogen three times to remove the air inside, the reactor was charged with H2 up to 5.5MPa at 25°C and then moved into an electric furnace set at desired temperature (e.g., 270°C). The stirring rate was set at 1000rpm. After desired reaction time, the autoclave was cooled by cold water to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was collected via high-speed centrifugation and analyzed by GC–MS to identify the products and by GC using SE-30 column and N2 as a carrier gas with FID, and n-tetradecane as an internal standard to determine the composition of the products."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Preparation and characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Preparation and characterization of catalysts In this work, a series of diatomite-supported Pd-based bimetal nanocatalysts including Pd–Cu/diatomite, Pd–Co/diatomite, and Pd–Ni/diatomite were prepared. The Pd–Cu/diatomite sample with metal weight loading of A% and Pd/Cu molar ratio of B is denoted as A%Pd–Cu(B:1)/diatomite. The microstructures of the as-prepared catalysts were examined by TEM, and Fig. 1 shows the typical TEM images of the support diatomite, 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite, 1%Pd–Co(3:1)/diatomite, and 1%Pd–Ni(3:1)/diatomite composite together with the histogram of particle size distribution and the EDS spectrum of 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite. It is clear that the used support displayed one-dimensional structure with smooth surface and diameter of 15–40nm (Fig. 1a), while in all the composites, numerous nanoparticles were uniformly decorated on the support. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis on about 50 randomly selected particles during the TEM observation indicated that all of the particles contained Pd and Cu, as shown in Fig. 1c, while the Pd/Cu ratios were slightly inhomogeneous from particle to particle. The total Pd/Cu molar ratio in 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite was almost equal to 3:1 determined by the ICP analysis. The other catalysts prepared in this work, 1%Pd–Co(3:1)/diatomite and 1%Pd–Ni(3:1)/diatomite, showed similar morphology with uniform distribution of metal particles on the diatomite support, as illustrated in Fig. 1d and e. Diatomite is a natural siliceous rock, which is generally amorphous. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of diatomite and 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite. The XRD pattern of the used diatomite shows intensive diffraction peaks, which can be well corresponded to the standards of dolomite, quartz, and palygorskite (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards Card No. 36-0426, No. 65-0466 and No. 21-0958). This indicates that the used diatomite was a mixture of SiO2, and these three crystalline substances. The presence of these crystalline minerals may provide the diatomite unique feature as catalyst support. The composite shows similar XRD pattern to the support without obvious diffraction peaks ascribing to Pd and Cu species. This suggests that the support kept its original structure, and that the supported particles were small or their loading was too low to be detectable. XPS was used to detect the oxidation states of the species in the as-prepared samples. The survey XPS spectrum of each Pd–Cu/diatomite composite showed the coexistence of Si, Ca, Fe, O, Al, Mg elements, originated from the support and consistent with the XRD results, together with Pd and Cu elements. Fig. 3 displays the Pd 3d and Cu 2p XPS spectra of 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite, 1%Pd/diatomite, and 1%Cu/diatomite. In comparison, the binding energy (BE) of Pd in 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite shifted to 335.4eV from 335.1eV of Pd in Pd/diatomite, while BE of Cu in Cu/diatomite shifted to 932.5eV from 932.7eV of Cu in Pd–Cu/diatomite. The shifts of metal BEs should be ascribed to the interaction between Pd and Cu particles, further suggesting the formation of Pd–Cu bimetallic particles. This is also consistent with the EDS analysis during the TEM observation."
8,Hydrogenation of esters over the diatomite-supported catalysts,"3.2 Hydrogenation of esters over the diatomite-supported catalysts The fatty esters are usually catalytically hydrogenated at temperature higher than 200°C, and temperature has considerable influence on the reaction. In this work, the temperature effect on the hydrogenation of methyl palmitate was investigated, and Table 1 shows the results of methyl palmitate hydrogenation over 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite in the temperature range from 250 to 300°C. As expected, the conversion of the ester increased with temperature, while the selectivity to 1-hexadecanol decreased, especially at temperature higher than 270°C it declined remarkably. At 270°C, the ester conversion reached 98.8% with a selectivity of 1-hexadecanol at 83.9%. As temperature further increased, for example, to 300°C, the product distribution changed considerably with the obvious reduction in the yield of 1-hexadecanol, and palmityl palmitate became the main product with n-hexadecane, dihexadecyl ether, and trace amount of n-pentadecane. In most of the hydrogenations of long-chain esters, the ester-exchange reaction usually occurs between the newly formed long-chain alcohol and the used substrate to form new esters with long-chains. For example, in the hydrogenation of methyl laurate catalyzed by Ru–Sn/Al2O3 at 300°C, lauryl laurate was the main product [12]. In this work, the formation of palmityl palmitate should result from the exchange reaction between 1-hexadecanol and methyl palmitate, while n-hexadecane was originated from the further hydrogenolysis of 1-hexadecanol at the experimental temperature, confirmed by the fact that the hydrogenolysis of 1-hexadecanol at 300°C led to n-hexadecane and dihexadecyl ether. In the tested temperature range of 250–300°C, it was at 270°C that the catalyst showed the best performance with a 1-hexadecanol yield of 82.9%. Based on this result, the hydrogenation in this work was performed at 270°C. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of methyl palmitate conversion, 1-hexadecanol selectivity, and yield on reaction time using 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite as catalyst at 270°C under initial H2 pressure of 5.5MPa. It is clear that methyl plamitate was rapidly converted into 1-hexadecnol with a selectivity higher than 80% within the initial 4h and was almost completely converted with a slight decrease in selectivity as reaction time prolonged to 7h. This indicates that the catalyst was quite active and selective for the hydrogenation of methyl palmitate toward 1-hexadecanol. Further prolonging reaction time, the alcohol selectivity decreased sharply, implying the further conversion of alcohol to byproducts under the experimental conditions. Based on the above preliminary results, the hydrogenation reactions of esters over different catalysts were performed at 270°C and initial H2 pressure of 5.5MPa for 7h, and the results of methyl palmitate hydrogenation are listed in Table 2 . The used support, diatomite, was active for this reaction, allowing a methyl palmitate conversion of 21.4% and a selectivity to 1-hexadecanol of 22.1% under the experimental conditions (Table 2, entry 1). To explore the reason of the support to effectively catalyze ester hydrogenation, the used diatomite was detected by NH3-TPD analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 , the surface of the support exhibited relatively strong acidity, which may result in the activity for catalyzing the ester hydrogenation. As illustrated in Table 2, all the diatomite-supported catalysts prepared in this work displayed enhanced improved performances compared to the support, indicating the synergistic effect between the metal particles and the support. For example, 1%Pd/diatomite as the catalyst showed good performance with the methyl palmitate conversion of 98.3% and the 1-hexadecanol yield of 73.4% (Table 2, entry 2). The as-prepared Pd–Cu/diatomite catalysts with various Pd/Cu molar ratios could effectively catalyze methyl palmitate hydrogenation, and the Pd/Cu molar ratio had considerable effect on the activity of the catalysts and little effect on the selectivity to 1-hexadecanol. Among the Pd–Cu/diatomite catalysts, 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite displayed the best performance for catalyzing methyl palmitate hydrogenation with a conversion of 98.8% and a selectivity toward 1-hexadecanol of 83.9%, and the highest yield of 1-hexadecanol (82.9%) was achieved (Table 2, entry 3). Decreasing the Pd/Cu molar ratio to 2:1, the catalyst, 1%Pd–Cu(2:1)/diatomite, still kept the similar performance to 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite. However, further increasing the Cu content resulted in the decrease in the activity of the catalysts (Table 2, entries 3–7). For instance, the catalyst with Pd/Cu=1:3 showed an ester conversion of 63.7% (Table 2, entry 7), while the catalyst still kept the comparable selectivity to the target product. As known, Cu is cheaper than Pd, thus the partial replacement of Pd with Cu can reduce the cost of the catalyst. In this work, the as-prepared Pd–Cu/diatomite catalysts with the Pd/Cu molar ratios from 3:1 to 1:1 exhibited similar activities and slightly higher selectivities toward alcohol compared to Pd/diatomite. Therefore, they can be considered good catalysts for selective hydrogenations of esters. The preliminary experiment indicated that the diatomite used in this work was active for catalyzing methyl palmitate hydrogenation. In comparison, SiO2 and Al2O3 were selected as catalyst supports for immobilizing Pd–Cu particles, respectively, and 1%Pd–Cu (3:1)/SiO2 and 1%Pd–Cu (3:1)/Al2O3 were prepared and applied in catalyzing ester hydrogenation. Though both of the catalysts were effective to catalyze the hydrogenation of methyl palmitate, they showed much lower activities compared to 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). This implies that the support and/or the interaction between the metal particle and the support played significant role in catalyzing the reaction. SiO2 and Al2O3 as catalyst supports displayed weak surface acidity [8], and they had little activity for catalyzing ester hydrogenation. Compared to these two supports, the diatomite used in this work possessed obvious catalytic performance, which may result from its relatively strong surface acidity, confirmed by NH3-TPD analysis as shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the synergistic effect between diatomite and the Pd–Cu bimetal particles may be responsible for the high activity of the catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded that diatomite is a good support for catalysts applying in long-chain ester hydrogenation. As listed in Table 2 (Entries 11, 12), 1%Pd–Co(3:1)/diatomite and 1%Pd–Ni(3:1)/diatomite also catalyzed methyl palmitate hydrogenation with high performances, respectively, and the catalytic activity of the diatomite-supported catalysts followed the order: Pd–Cu>Pd–Co>Pd–Ni. Compared to 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite, 1%Pd–Co(3:1)/diatomite and 1%Pd–Ni(3:1)/diatomite exhibited lower selectivity toward 1-hexadecanol. In addition, the 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite catalyst was used to catalyze the hydrogenations of methyl laurate and methyl stearate at 270°C and initial H2 pressure at 5.5MPa for 7h, respectively. These two esters could be effectively hydrogenated by this catalyst, producing lauryl alcohol with yield of 76.1% at the methyl laurate conversion of 94.6% and stearyl alcohol with yield of 64.1% at the methyl stearate conversion of 96.2%. These findings indicate that the diatomite-supported Pd–Cu nanocatalysts are effective catalysts for selective hydrogenation of esters to corresponding alcohols."
9,Summary,"In this work, the diatomite supported Pd-based bimetal nanocatalysts including Pd–Cu/diatomite, Pd–Co/diatomite, and Pd–Ni/diatomite were prepared, which displayed good performances for the selective hydrogenation of long-chain fatty esters toward corresponding alcohols. Especially, the 1%Pd–Cu(3:1)/diatomite exhibited excellent performance for selective hydrogenation of methyl palmitate, giving a 1-hexadecanol yield of 82.9%. The high efficiency of the catalysts for long-chain esters may result from the synergistic effect between the diatomite support and the Pd-based bimetal particles. The catalysts prepared in this work may find promising applications in catalysis."
