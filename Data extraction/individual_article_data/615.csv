0,Introduction,"Hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds is one of the most important organic transformations in industry and academia. The applications of this useful process range from the production of fine chemicals to the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients [1–3]. An example is the hydrogenation of ketones to produce secondary alcohols, which are considered important intermediates for fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [4,5]. The three strategies commonly employed are direct hydrogenation, hydrogenation by reducing agents and transfer hydrogenation. The former two processes involve the use of either pressurized molecular hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures or reactive and dangerous reducing agents which often results in the formation of by-products (over-hydrogenated products) or racemic mixtures (in the case of chiral products) (top, Scheme 1 ). Transfer hydrogenation also referred to as hydrogen transfer, is an attractive alternative to these processes as it is highly selective, safer, more eco-friendly and requires milder reaction conditions (bottom, Scheme 1) [6]. Here, a hydrogen atom is transferred from a hydrogen donor (often 2-PrOH or formic acid) to an unsaturated compound. The latter process has several other advantages which often include (i) the use of simple equipment and easy experimental set-up; (ii) low catalyst loading; (iii) selective hydrogenation of functional groups; (iv) volatile side-products that can be easily removed or recycled; (v) inexpensive and readily available hydrogen donors which are easy to handle and (vi) eco-friendly solvents [1,7–10]. Transition metal complexes commonly used in transfer hydrogenation are those of rhodium, iridium and ruthenium ligated by (a) chiral nitrogen- and (b) phosphorous ligands [1,11–13]. Although iridium-based catalysts have been shown to be more active towards transfer hydrogenation reactions, it is the half-sandwich ruthenium-arene based catalysts that are widely employed due to their relatively cheaper cost and excellent product selectivities. Over the last decade, we have witnessed great advancements with regards to the development of a range of diverse ligands and ruthenium complexes, to produce more affordable catalytic systems with high efficiency. One of the key factors governing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst system is the choice of ligand scaffold. Of particular interest are N-heterocyclic carbene ligands which have the potential to form ruthenium complexes with a broad range of oxidation states and coordination geometries. Selectivities can be controlled by introducing steric bulk around the ruthenium centre and modulation of the metal’s electrophilicity by incorporating various substituents with different donor abilities onto the backbone of the NHC ligands. Valerga and co-workers prepared a series of ruthenium picolyl-NHC complexes and found that these complexes were efficient and versatile towards a wide range of ketones and imines when employed as catalysts in transfer hydrogenation reactions (1, Fig. 1 ) [14]. In addition, the reactivity was influenced by the substituents incorporated into the wingtip and imidazole backbone of the ligand. Similarly, Albrecht and co-workers prepared a range of ruthenium complexes ligated by substituted-functionalized NHC ligands and found that the olefin-tethered NHC complex (2, Fig. 1) could hydrogenate substrates including olefins, ketones, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile and N-benzylideneaniline under transfer hydrogenation conditions [15]. Furthermore, the reactivity of these catalysts were dependent on the lability of the pendant arm on the NHC ligand. 1,2,3-Triazoles can be regarded as substituted alternatives to NHC ligands, however the use of ruthenium triazolyl complexes as catalysts in transfer hydrogenations are rare and only a few examples are documented in the literature [16–23]. For this reason, we developed some new examples of cationic pyridyl-triazole complexes of ruthenium and investigated the reactivity of these as catalyst precursors in transfer hydrogenation reactions."

3,X-ray crystal structure determination,"2.2 X-ray crystal structure determination Single X-ray diffraction intensity data were collected on a Bruker Apex DUO diffractometer with a CCD area detector [24] using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data collection, reduction and refinement were performed using SMART and SAINT software [25]. Absorption corrections [26] and other systematic errors were accounted for using SADABS [27]. All structures were solved by Direct Methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXS-13 and SHELXL-16 [28,29] within the X-Seed graphical user interface [30,31]. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen atoms were placed using calculated positions and riding models.

6,Procedures for transfer hydrogenation reactions,"2.5 Procedures for transfer hydrogenation reactions 2.5.1 Method A (General method) Catalytic reactions were conducted on a Radleys® 12-stage carrousel parallel reactor equipped with a gas distribution system. In a typical experiment, 0.1 mol% of the catalyst was dissolved in 2-PrOH (9.37 mL) in a 20 mL glass reactor tube under a N2 atmosphere at 25 °C. The reaction was flushed with N2 (three times). KOH solution (2 mol%: 0.4 mL, 0.1 M solution) was added to the reaction while maintaining a positive N2 pressure. The tube was sealed and the temperature increased to 82 °C while being stirred continuously. Following this, acetophenone (0.23 mL, 2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture stirred under N2 for the desired time. The total reaction volume amounts to 10 mL. It was imperative to degas the reactor tubes to remove any traces of oxygen so as to prevent catalyst decomposition or oxidation from occurring. After the allotted time, the reaction tube was removed from the carousel reactor and cooled in an ice bath for 30 min. A sample of the reaction mixture was filtered through a syringe filter and the filtrate (1 mL) was analysed by means of GC-FID. p-Xylene was used as internal standard for quantification purposes. Conversions were determined by monitoring the disappearance of the substrate peak and the appearance of the product peak in the gas chromatogram."
7,Procedure for 1H NMR and MS experiments probing the transformation of 2a in the presence of KOH and 2-PrOH,"2.6 Procedure for 1H NMR and MS experiments probing the transformation of 2a in the presence of KOH and 2-PrOH Complex 2a (0.020 g, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in deuterated chloroform (0.75 mL) and transferred to a J-Young tube. The first spectrum was recorded at 25 °C. A solution of KOH in 2-PrOH (23 μL of a 0.1 M solution) was added to the reaction tube and a second spectrum was recorded 5 min later at 25 °C. The temperature of the instrument was increased to 60 °C and 80 °C after which the third and fourth spectra were recorded at 5-minute interval respectively. All spectra were normalized relative to the methyl peak at 2.20 ppm. At the end of the experiment, a precipitation was observed. Instrument conditions: 600 MHz instrument; Pulse angle = 90°; spectral collection range = ± 20 ppm; 1 s relaxation time; 32–64 scans. The same sample was submitted for MS analysis and immediately analysed."

9,Synthesis and characterization of ligands and complexes,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of ligands and complexes The preparation and characterization of ligands a-c have been reported previously [33] and are not discussed here. The appropriate ligand was reacted with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 at room temperature under an inert atmosphere to form the desired cationic complex containing a chloride counterion . The cationic complexes with Cl− as anion were not isolated as they were found to be unstable, rapidly undergoing decomposition in the solid state. Treatment of the in situ generated cationic complex, [(L)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl (L = bidentate triazole ligand), with excess sodium tetraphenylborate (NaBPh4) afforded the cationic half-sandwich ruthenium (II) complexes (1a-1c) as yellow solids in high yields (Scheme 2 ). Cationic complexes 2a-2b and 3a-3b were prepared in a similar manner by treating [(L)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl with excess ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6) and sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4) respectively, which afforded the complexes as either orange or brown solids in moderate to high yields. Salt metathesis with larger anions is well documented in the literature in order to isolate more stable metal complexes as opposed to having the smaller chloride as the anion [34,35]. It is noteworthy to mention that the solubility of the cationic complexes is influenced by the nature of the anion as well as the substituent on the triazole ring. For instance, replacing the aryl rings with an octyl chain led to significant improvement in the solubility of the complexes. In addition, the PF6 − and BF4 − complexes were found to be more soluble than their BPh4 − analogues. Cationic complexes 1a-1c, 2b and 3b were found to be air-stable and moisture tolerant as they can be stored under ambient conditions for several months, however, the complexes containing the octyl substituent are hygroscopic over time and must be stored under an inert atmosphere. Conversely, 2a and 3a are quite stable in solution when samples, dissolved in CHCl3, were left for weeks under ambient conditions showed no signs of decomposition when monitored by NMR spectroscopy ( Fig. S1 ). Complex 1a [36] has been reported previously whereas 1b-1c, 2a-2b and 3a-3b are all novel compounds. FT-IR spectroscopy of the complexes confirmed bidentate coordination of the ligands to the ruthenium metal centre. The v(CN) band of the pyridine ring for the ligands in the range 1590–1601 cm−1 shifted towards lower wavenumbers upon complexation. The shift to lower frequencies was attributed to the electron-withdrawing nature of the ligands which, upon complexation, facilitates metal-to-ligand back-bonding interactions [37]. This, in turn, causes the weakening of the CN bond which results in the v(CN) band shifting to lower wavenumbers. In addition, strong absorption bands are observed in the region 700–736 cm−1, 826–828 cm−1 (broad peak) and 1050 cm−1 (broad peak) which were assigned to the stretching vibration modes of the BPh4 −, PF6 − and BF4 − anions respectively. The appearance of these absorption bands provided evidence for successful anion exchange of the chloride counter-ion with the larger anions. Further evidence of successful coordination of the ligands to the ruthenium centre was provided by NMR spectroscopy (Figs. S9–S12; S14–S16; S19–S20; S22–S29; S31–S34; S37–S41;S43–S45). In the 1H NMR spectra of the complexes, the proton in position-6 of the pyridine ring (H1) shifted downfield by approximately 0.9 ppm in comparison to that of the free ligands in DMSO‑d 6. In addition, a slight downfield shift of approximately 0.6 ppm was observed for the triazole proton (H7 ) upon complexation which confirms the coordination of the ligands through the pyridyl nitrogen as well as the proximal nitrogen of the triazole ring. For complexes 1a-1c, broad resonances were observed in the region 6.79–7.18 ppm which were assigned to the protons of the BPh4 − anion. Furthermore, the 31P NMR spectra of complexes 2a and 2b show a septet at −143.1 ppm, indicating the presence of the PF6 − anion. The stereogenic nature of the ruthenium centre is highlighted by the appearance of four doublets in the region 5.80–6.30 ppm and two sharp doublets in the region 0.97–1.10 ppm which were assigned to the aromatic and the aliphatic protons of the p-cymene moiety respectively. Upon complexation, the two-fold symmetry of the p-cymene arene ring is lost and as a consequence, inequivalent doublets are observed in the 1H NMR spectrum. This behaviour is a common phenomenon and has been reported for similar ruthenium (II) complexes [37,38]. It is interesting to note that the anions had minimal influence on the chemical shifts of the protons of the ligand backbone in DMSO. For instance, the pyridyl-imine proton (H1) resonates at 8.59 ppm for complexes with the same ligand backbone, irrespective of the anion. A similar result was observed for the triazole proton (H7) of these complexes in DMSO. High-resolution ESI-MS recorded in the positive mode were consistent with the proposed ruthenium structures. In a typical spectrum, the parent ion (base peak) revealed a characteristic isotopic cluster corresponding to the cationic portion of the complex (see SI, Figs. S13, S17, S21, S30, S35, S42, S46 ) which coincide with the theoretical isotopic cluster [39]. Sharp peaks in the mass spectra recorded in the negative mode at approximately 319, 144 and 87 m/z were observed and assigned to the BPh4 −, PF6 − and BF4 − anions respectively. Further characterization by elemental analysis confirms the bulk purity of the cationic ruthenium complexes where the elemental data obtained experimentally corresponded well with the calculated values (see SI, section 6.1). These results indicate that the ruthenium complexes are formed in a 1:1 metal/ligand ratio. Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained by slow evaporation from a CH2Cl2 solution of 1b at room temperature. Crystallography data, as well as selected bond lengths and bond angles, are given in Table S1 and Table S2 respectively (see SI). The molecular structure of 1b (Fig. 2 ) shows a dissociated ion-pair in which the cation and anion are clearly separated by a distance of 6.587 Å (Ru-B). The coordination sphere of the metal centre is occupied by the pyridyl-triazole ligand, the terminal halide and p-cymene arene ring with the arrangement around the ruthenium centre is described as a typical “piano-stool” geometry. The Ru-Npy bond length of 1b is 2.1162(14) Å which is within the range observed for analogous ruthenium complexes [34,40] and is slightly longer than the corresponding bond to the triazole nitrogen (Ru-Ntrz). The torsion angle was observed as 0.5(2) Å, reflecting the planar nature of the ligand in the complex."
10,Transfer hydrogenation reactions,"3.2 Transfer hydrogenation reactions The cationic half-sandwich ruthenium complexes (1a-1c, 2a-2b, 3a-3b) were evaluated as pre-catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of selected ketones (Scheme 3 ). These complexes differ from each other in terms of the substituents on the triazole ring as well as the type of anion associated with the cations with the former having different electron-donating abilities and the latter varying in steric size. Here, the effect of the nature of the catalyst architectures, catalyst and base loadings, reaction temperatures and times, hydrogen sources, nature of the base and substrates were studied in some detail. 3.2.1 Reactivity of cationic half-sandwich ruthenium complexes as catalyst precursors for transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol The reaction conditions employed were adapted from a previously reported procedure by Ramesh and co-workers, using our catalyst 2b (PF6) to establish the optimized reaction conditions [41]. Acetophenone was used as a model substrate and 2-PrOH as a hydrogen source. Reactions were performed at 82 °C with a catalyst loading and base concentration of 0.1 and 2 mol% respectively. Fig. 3 summarizes the catalytic activities of all ruthenium complexes tested under the above-mentioned reaction conditions. The complexes 1a-1c, 2a-2b, 3a-3b, upon activation with KOH in the presence of 2-PrOH, were found to mediate the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone to produce 1-phenylethanol in moderate quantities over 3 h, whereas higher activities were observed for the complexes especially those of 2a and 3a at 6 h. Comparing the different catalyst architectures, the ligand backbone had a marked effect on the reactivity of the catalysts. For the complexes having the bulkier BPh4 − as anion (1a-1c), a conversion of 52 % was observed over 3 h for 1a which contained an octyl substituent on the triazole ring. When aryl substituents were introduced onto the triazole ring (1b and 1c), a significant drop in activity was observed with conversion of only 33 % and ∼ 40 % obtained for 1b and 1c respectively after 3 h. The decrease in activity was attributed to the low solubility of 1b and 1c in 2-PrOH. The catalytic reactions of these two complexes were performed as a suspension in 2-PrOH, which resulted in only low concentrations of the active species migrating into solution and thus being able to partake in the catalytic reaction thus leading to less 1-phenylethanol being produced. The incorporation of a CF3 group onto the phenyl ring slightly improved the solubility of complex 1c in 2-PrOH, leading to a ∼ 7 % (after 3 h) increase in conversion. A similar trend was observed for the complexes with PF6 − (2a and 2b) and BF4 − (3a and 3b) as anion where the catalysts containing the octyl substituent showed a ∼ 32 % increase in activity relative to their phenyl analogues at 3 h. Extending the reaction time to 6 h also led to a significant increase in activity which indicates that the extent of catalyst decomposition between 3 and 6 h is minimal. The catalytic activities of these catalysts were compared with those of the [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 precursor to determine whether the coordination of the pyridyl-triazole ligands to the ruthenium centre had a positive effect on the reactivity of the catalysts. Under the same reaction conditions employing a 0.05 mol% catalyst loading (precursor has two metal centres), the [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 precursor gave poor conversion of only 8 % after 6 h. In this particular case, rapid catalyst decomposition occurred with the formation of ruthenium black observed within the first 30 min of the reaction. This result highlights the importance of appropriate ligands to stabilize the metal centre to prolong catalyst lifetime and to increase the productivity of the catalytic systems. The effect of different counterions to the cationic complexes was also investigated and this revealed interesting observations. Regardless of the substituent on the triazole ring, the complexes containing the smaller anions (PF6 − and BF4 −) were found to be more active catalysts than their BPh4 − analogues in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone. For example, 2a (PF6) and 3a (BF4) gave conversions of ∼ 77 % and ∼ 75 % respectively in comparison to that of 1a (BPh4) with only 52 % obtained after 3 h. As mentioned before, some of the BPh4-derived complexes are only partially soluble in 2-PrOH. However, in the case of 1a (BPh4), the complex was completely soluble and therefore the decrease in the activity of 1a (BPh4), in comparison to that of 2a (PF6) and 3a (BF4) is not related to differences in solubility but rather to the effect of the different counterions. At this stage the exact nature of the impact of the counterions are not known but it could possibly be related to differences in ion pairing in the different systems. The solubility of the cationic complex improved slightly in 2-PrOH when the BPh4 − anion was replaced with PF6 − and BF4 −, hence it comes as no surprise that the corresponding complexes 2b (PF6) and 3b (BF4) gave similar activities to each other. 3.2.2 Influence of reaction parameters on the reactivity of catalysts 1a (BPh4) and 2a (PF6) Since these ruthenium complexes were found to be active in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, the catalytic behaviour of 2a (PF6) was studied in more detail to explore the impact of various reaction parameters on the reactivity of these complexes. The effect of different catalyst loading (Table 1 ) was briefly investigated employing the same reaction conditions listed in section 2.2.1. Despite the catalyst loading being decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 mol%, the transfer hydrogenation reaction still proceeded and resulted in an increase in turnover frequencies (TOFs) (entries 5–6, Table S3) with a relatively good conversion registered for 2a (PF6) (∼77 %) after 3 h (entries 1–2, Table 1 and Fig. S2 ). Similarly, for 1a (BPh4), a moderate conversion of 52 % and an increase in TOF were observed (entries 1–2, Table S3). When the catalyst loading was halved to 0.05 mol%, the highest TOF was registered for 2a (entry 7, Table S3), however, it came at the expense of reduced catalytic activity which saw a substantial decrease in conversion to 35 % after 3 h. In the case of 1a (BPh4), a loss of only ∼ 16 % was observed with the highest TOF recorded using a 0.05 mol% catalyst loading (entry 3, Table S3). In the absence of catalyst in the catalytic reaction, acetophenone was not converted to 1-phenylethanol at all. Although the optimum reaction conditions for 1a (BPh4) would be to employ a catalyst loading of 0.05 mol%, for comparison studies between 1a (BPh4) and 2a (PF6), a 0.1 mol% catalyst loading was chosen for further catalytic reactions. Next, we investigated the effect of temperature on the reactivity of the catalysts by decreasing the temperature to 40 °C and 25 °C respectively (entries 5–8, Table 1). It is clear from the results that reactions performed at temperatures below 82 °C showed the catalysts to be inactive with conversions below 6 % for 1a and 2a ( Fig. S3 ). A similar trend was observed for other ruthenium systems reported in the literature [42,43]. This is quite an important observation which suggests that the catalytic active species (presumable the Ru-H species) is only generated at higher temperatures. Further evidence to support this argument was the fact that the colour of the catalytic reaction mixtures was sensitive to temperature changes. Reactions conducted at 25 °C and 40 °C gave light brown solutions as opposed to the deep dark brown solution obtained at 82 °C after the addition of KOH. In another experiment, we set out to try and generate the active species in solution at 82 °C and to subsequently allow the mixture to cool to 25 °C after which an attempt was made to conduct the reaction at this temperature for 3 h (entries 9–10, Table 1). The aim here was to establish whether the active species can mediate the transfer hydrogenation process at room temperature. In this case, similar conversions were registered to those obtained for reactions previously performed at 25 °C and 40 °C respectively. The results highlight two important observations regarding our catalytic systems: firstly, higher temperatures are crucial for the generation of the active species to facilitate transfer hydrogenation and secondly, although the active species is formed in solution, the catalytic reactions still require higher temperatures to facilitate the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone. In addition to varying the reaction temperature, the influence of base concentration was also investigated to evaluate the catalyst’s efficiency (Fig. 4 ). Base concentrations exceeding 2 mol% had no discernible effect on the catalytic reactivities of 1a and 2a under transfer hydrogenation conditions with conversion between 52 and 59 % and 76 – 81 % registered after 3 h respectively. Decreasing the base-loading below 2 mol% led to a significant loss in activity. For example, a conversion of 58 % observed for 2a when the base concentration was decreased from 2 to 1 mol %. In the complete absence of base, the catalysts were inactive. These results highlight two important observations regarding the transfer hydrogenation reaction catalysed by these complexes. Firstly, a base is required in order to generate the catalytically active species in solution. The active species seemingly only forms in 2-PrOH at 82 °C as at this temperature the reaction mixture changes colour to dark brown. Reaction mixtures for reactions conducted in the absence of KOH remained yellow, even at higher temperatures, which seems to suggest that the active species is not formed without the base being present. Secondly, only catalytic amounts of KOH were required to catalyse the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone, unlike the case for other ruthenium complexes which usually require stoichiometric amounts [44,45]. The influence of the type of hydrogen source was also investigated in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone employing 1a (BPh4) and 2a (PF6) as precatalyst (Table 2 ). For these reactions, the alcohol act as both the hydrogen donor and as the reaction solvent. Among the alcohols examined, secondary alcohols such as 2-PrOH and 2-butanol were found to be the most efficient hydrogen donors affording 1-phenylethanol conversions of ∼77 % and ∼53 % respectively using 2a (PF6) as catalyst after 3 h. In contrast, the use of primary alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol resulted in significantly lower conversions of between 6 and 15 %. It is evident from these results that the activity is highly influenced by the nature of the hydrogen donors employed. To fully understand the behaviour of the catalysts in these solvents, we need to consider the following two points: Firstly, the ability of the alkoxide to coordinate to the metal centre and secondly, the ease of the β-H transfer to the metal centre to generate the metal hydride species. Alcohols, in general, are weak nucleophiles which often requires strong electrophiles to facilitate nucleophilic substitution reactions. To increase the nucleophilic character of alcohols, alkoxides are often generated since they are considered better nucleophiles. It is therefore not surprising that no activity was observed for 1a (BPh4) and 2a (PF6) in the absence of base due to 2-PrOH not being converted to the isopropoxide (Fig. 4). Mayr et al. studied the nucleophilicities of alcohols and alkoxides towards benzhydrylium ions in alcohol solutions [46]. They found that the nucleophilic reactivity of the isopropoxide species is slightly higher than those of 1-propoxide and ethoxide species in solution. This suggests that secondary alcohols are more nucleophilic in nature. The second aspect involves the lability of the Cβ-H bond and how facile the β-H transfer process is to generate the metal hydride species. Of all the hydrogen donors investigated, EtOH, 1-PrOH, 2-PrOH and 2-BuOH are not sterically hindered and they all have β-hydrogens which renders this process favourable. Indeed, when reactions were performed in tert-BuOH, lower activities were registered in comparison to those observed for secondary alcohols (Table 2). The decrease in activity was ascribed to the metal tert-butoxide species undergoing γ-H elimination instead, which is a less favourable process in transfer hydrogenation. Although further investigation is needed to fully understand the behaviour of the catalysts in different hydrogen donor solvents, the differences in activity could be as a result of both the nucleophilicity of the alkoxides and the lability of the Cβ-H bond to undergo β-H transfer. In addition, it has been shown in the literature that secondary alcohols, in general, are far better hydrogen donors than primary alcohols due to their relative oxidation potentials [47,48]. Reaction time profiles of reactions performed with complexes 1a (BPh4) and 2a (PF6) as catalyst precursors were plotted by varying the reaction times between 0.5 and 12 h to shed more light on the stability of the catalysts ( Fig. S4 ). At 30 min, 2a (PF6) was able to catalyse acetophenone with a conversion up to 29 %, while a lower activity was observed for 1a (BPh4) under similar reaction conditions. Increasing the reaction time to 6 h resulted in a steady increase in activity with nearly full conversion observed for 2a (PF6). Extending the reaction time to 12 h led to 1a (BPh4) also being able to reach nearly full conversion. 3.2.3 Transfer hydrogenation of various ketones employing 2a (PF6) as catalyst precursor Having explored the impact of various reaction parameters on the reactivity of selected complexes, we next examined the catalytic efficiency of the most active complex 2a (PF6) in reactions of a small library of substrates including aryl and alkyl ketones under the optimized reaction conditions (Table 3 ). In general, 2a (PF6) was able to catalyse the transfer hydrogenation of these ketones to their corresponding alcohols in moderate to excellent conversions. The introduction of electron-deficient and electron-rich substituents in the para position on the aromatic ring had a marked effect on the rate of the reaction (entries 1–8). From the catalytic data collected, analogues of acetophenone with electron-deficient substituents in the para position requires less time to undergo reduction of the carbonyl group in comparison to electron-rich substituents at the same position. For example, 4-chloroacetophenone was converted into the corresponding alcohol in > 99 % conversion within 4 h (entry 8) in comparison to acetophenone which took 6 h to achieve ∼ 99 % conversion (entry 2). In contrast, longer reaction times were required when the electron-withdrawing chloride substituent was replaced with an electron-donating methyl group with a comparable conversion only observed after 9 h (entry 5). The differences in reaction rates of the substrates may be attributed to the electrophilic character of the carbonyl group in the presence of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents which alter the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group [41,49]. These inductive effects could control the ease of hydride transfer during the catalytic cycle in which a hydride is transferred from the metal-hydride intermediate to the corresponding carbonyl group and in turn, affecting the hydrogenation process. It is worth mentioning that the reaction time was significantly reduced to 3 h when a 0.2 mol% catalyst loading was employed for the transfer hydrogenation of 4-methyl acetophenone (entry 6), which afforded the corresponding alcohol in 88 % conversion with a higher TOF obtained in comparison to reactions performed at prolonged reaction time using 0.1 mol% catalyst loadings (entries 4–5). The transfer hydrogenation of 4-bromo- and 2-bromo acetophenone afforded conversions of 74 % and 69 % respectively, much lower than those observed for 4-methyl acetophenone, the more electron-donating substrate, after 9 h (entries 9–12). The lower reactivity recorded for 4-bromo- and 2-bromo acetophenone was attributed to the low solubility of these two substrates in 2-PrOH. Under our reaction conditions, the bromide analogues of acetophenone partially precipitated out of the reaction mixture when 0.2 M solutions of the substrate were utilized. No dehalogenated side products were observed for any of the halo-substituted acetophenones. Complex 2a (PF6) was also found to be an effective catalyst in the transfer hydrogenation of the more sterically hindered benzophenone to yield the corresponding alcohol in 91 % conversion after 6 h (entry 14), which is comparable to that observed for acetophenone. The more challenging substrate 2-octanone could also be hydrogenated to 2-octanol however, longer reaction times were required to achieve excellent conversions (entries 15–16). This result reflects the intrinsic electronic difference between the aliphatic chain (for 2-octanone) and the phenyl group (for acetophenone) as these moieties were found to impact the reaction rates at which the hydrogenation process occurs. In order to contextualize the efficiency of our catalyst system, it was compared to other ruthenium arene complexes bearing triazole and triazolylidene ligand scaffolds. Rit and co-workers recently prepared a series of heteroditopic ruthenium NHC complexes ligated by 1,2,3-triazole/triazolylidene groups as catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds [23]. Among these, the electron-rich complexes were found to be more active in the hydrogenation of ketones in comparison to the analogous complex having a triazole as the donor group. Employing a catalyst loading and base concentration of 0.1 mol% and 10 mol% respectively, these complexes converted acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol which afforded conversions of 84 % (TON = 840, TOF = 336) and 50 % (TON = 500, TOF = 200) respectively within 2.5 h. Our complexes 2a and 3a were able to hydrogenate acetophenone in comparable conversions (2a: 77 %, 3a: 75 %) with TONs of 765 (TOF = 256) and 750 (TOF = 250) observed respectively within 3 h. Although the triazolylidene-NHC complexes are reported to be slightly more active, our catalytic systems outperformed the triazole-NHC complex mentioned earlier with higher TON and TOF values registered for 2a and 3a. For the complexes reported by Rit and co-workers, increasing the catalyst loading to 0.5 mol% led to moderate to excellent conversions (85–96 %: TON = 170–192, TOF = 68–77) after 2.5 h. By employing a catalyst loading of only 0.2 mol%, complex 2a was able to hydrogenate acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol in quantitative conversions with a TON and TOF of 470 and 157 being observed respectively within 3 h, more than double the activity registered for the heteroditopic ruthenium NHC complexes reported by Rit and co-workers. In another study by Singh and co-workers, the 1,4-bis(phenylthio/seleno methyl)-1,2,3-triazolyl ruthenium complexes were found to be highly efficient catalysts in the transfer hydrogenation of various aldehydes and ketones [50]. These systems were able to hydrogenate benzophenone, 4-methyl acetophenone and the more challenging biomass-derived carbonyl, furfuraldehyde, in excellent conversions (82–96 %) with TOFs > 2900 observed within 3 h when ultra-low catalyst loadings (0.01 mol%) and stoichiometric base amounts were employed. Although these catalytic systems were found to be highly active in comparison to our pyridyl-triazolyl ruthenium complexes, their complexes require high base concentrations to efficiently facilitate the transfer hydrogenation reactions. In this particular example, a stoichiometric base amount (100 mol% KOH) was employed to produce the active species which allows the transfer hydrogenation to proceed smoothly. In contrast, the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone employing our complex, 2a, could still proceed at even lower base concentration (0.25–2.0 mol%) which afforded 1-phenylethanol in moderate to good conversions (22–77 %). Under our catalytic conditions (0.1 mol% catalyst loading, 2 mol% base concentration), 2a was found to be active and could hydrogenate more challenging substrates such as benzophenone, 4-methylacetophenone and 2-octanone to their corresponding secondary alcohols in conversions > 90 % within 9 h. 3.2.4 Preliminary mechanistic studies In order to probe the reaction mechanism for our pyridyl-triazolyl ruthenium complexes, various control experiments were conducted. As previously discussed, reactions conducted in the absence of base rendered the catalyst inactive as no 1-phenylethanol was detected (entry 1, Table 4 ). These results highlight the presence of the base to generate the active species. In a similar manner and not unexpectedly, no activity was observed for reactions performed in the absence of catalyst, suggesting that the transfer hydrogenation reaction is indeed metal-mediated (entry 2). There are several possibilities in which vacant sites on the metal can be generated to accommodate the incoming substrates. These include: dissociation of the chloride or p-cymene ligands, the partial or complete dissociation of the bidentate ligand to create vacant sites on the metal centre. Reactions performed in the presence of excess p-cymene (20 equivalents with respect to catalyst) had no discernible change in 1-phenylethanol formation which clearly indicates that the active species does not result from the dissociation of the p-cymene ligand (entry 3). Furthermore, the addition of mercury to the reaction mixture did not affect the conversion of acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol which rules out nanoparticles as catalyst precursor. This lends further evidence for the homogeneous nature of the catalytic system and ruling-out nanoparticles mediating the reaction (entry 4) [51]. In a separate study, a 1H NMR experiment was conducted to investigate any discernible changes in the spectrum of 2a in the presence of KOH and 2-PrOH (see SI, Fig. S5 ). No changes in the NMR spectrum of the complex were observed after the addition of KOH and 2-PrOH at 25 °C, 60 °C and 82 °C respectively. Under these conditions, no signals associated with the free pyridyl-triazole ligand or free p-cymene were observed in the 1H NMR spectra. These results clearly indicate that both the pyridyl-triazole ligand and p-cymene are still coordinated to the metal centre and remains intact throughout the catalytic cycle. In addition, the appearance of a new peak at 2.13 ppm was assigned acetone. Attempts to isolate reaction intermediates from the NMR sample were not successful. However, during the reaction some orange crystalline material as well as an off-white powder settle out of solution. These were identified as complex 2a and KCl respectively (see SI, Fig. S6 ). Since the formation of acetone and KCl were observed, we believe that in the presence of 2-PrOH and KOH that a metal-isopropoxide species is formed during the catalytic reaction which undergoes β-H elimination to yield the metal hydride species and liberating acetone as a by-product. High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on a solution of 2a in KOH and 2-PrOH, in an attempt to detect any reaction intermediates formed during catalysis. The resultant mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks centered at 495.2046 m/z and is assigned to the metal-hydride species which correlates well with the theoretical fragment [M−Cl + H]+ with a calculated mass of 495.2069 m/z ( Fig. S7 ). It is, however, possible that metal complexes could be protonated under mass spectrometry conditions which could often lead to the formation of species with same mass as the metal hydride. If this is the case, we should observe the [M−Cl + H]+ fragment in a pure sample of 2a (in the absence of KOH and 2-PrOH). This was not the case when a pure sample of 2a was analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. For the pure sample, the [M−Cl + H]+ ion was not observed (see SI, Fig. S8 ) which suggests that the fragmentation at 495.2046 m/z in the catalytic mixture is not as a result of protonation during the mass spectrometry analysis but rather the presence of the intact metal-hydride which forms as a result of β-H elimination from a metal-isopropoxide species. The only fragment observed in the spectrum of the pure sample shown in Fig. S8 corresponded to the molecular ion, [M]+, which highlights the stability of the cationic complex under mass spectrometry conditions. On the basis of these experimental observations and related literature reports [41,52,53], a plausible monohydride mechanism is proposed for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones in the presence of base and 2-PrOH (Scheme 4 ). The first step involves the reaction between the precatalyst C15 and 2-PrOK (produced via the reaction of 2-PrOH with KOH) to generate the ruthenium-isopropoxide species (C15-I, Scheme 4). Species C15-I undergoes β-H elimination via the C15-II intermediate to form the ruthenium hydride species C15-III and at the same time liberating acetone as a by-product (a, Scheme 4). In this process, one of the N-donor sites of the N^N chelating ligand dissociates to open a coordinating site to accommodate the incoming hydride ligand as a result of β-hydride transfer, accommodate the incoming H-ligand being transferred during β-H transfer process. The Ru(1)-N(1) bond is most likely to undergo bond cleavage since it was found to be longer than the Ru(1)-N(2) bond length (Fig. 2 and Table S1). Acetophenone (b) coordinates to C15-III to form intermediate C15-IV. In the next step, the substrate is reduced as a result of insertion of the carbonyl functionality into Ru-H bond to form the ruthenium alkoxide species C15-V. This species undergoes a dissociative substitution reaction in which the alkoxide of species C15-V is exchanged with a propoxide ligand (f) to regenerate the initial ruthenium propoxide species C15-I. In this process, the product-alkoxide (c) deprotonates 2-PrOH (which is in excess) (d) and, in turn, liberates 1-phenylethanol as product (e)."
11,Conclusion,"A series of cationic half-sandwich ruthenium complexes (1a-1c, 2a-2b, 3a-3b) were successfully prepared and fully characterized. These complexes were evaluated and found to be efficient catalyst precursors in the transfer hydrogenation of the model substrate, acetophenone. The ligand scaffold had a marked effect on the reactivities of the catalysts. In general, catalysts with the octyl substituent on the triazole ring were found to be more active with quantitative conversions observed after 6 h. The reactivity of the catalysts decreases significantly when aryl substituents were introduced onto the triazole ring. The effect of different counterions associated with the various cationic complexes was also investigated and this revealed interesting observations. Regardless of the substituent on the triazole ring, the complexes containing the smaller anions (PF6 −and BF4 −) were found to be more active catalysts than their BPh4 − analogues in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone. Essentially greater ion-pairing leads to decreased catalytic activity. Further evaluation of complexes 2a (PF6) showed that the catalyst could hydrogenate acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol with a catalyst loading as low as 0.025 mol%. The efficiency of the catalyst was further highlighted by the transfer hydrogenation of a small library of substrates ranging from substituted aromatic ketones to aliphatic ketones with excellent conversion obtained using reaction times of between 3 and 9 h. Preliminary mechanistic investigations were performed. A metal-hydride species was detected by mass spectrometry which is proposed to be formed as a result of β-H elimination involving a metal-isopropoxide species. A plausible monohydride mechanism was also proposed for our catalytic system."
