0,Introduction,"Crude oil is used to produce liquid fuels such as diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, and other derivatives such as plastics, lubricants, and heat oil. According to the survey, 70% of diesel and 99.6% of the petrol is consumed by the transport sector only. Therefore, it is urgent to find out the renewable alternative fuels for transport which could substitute liquid fuels which are usually utilized in internal combustion (IC) engines. Almost all transportation modes depend on IC engines. The burning of fossil fuels is the concern of air pollution, CO2 emissions, global warming, health problems, trade deficits, energy security and wealth transfer [1,2]. Thus, the development of a renewable energy is the most urgent concern to the engineers and scientist [3,4]. Hydrogen fuel (H2) is a promising future alternative to substitute petroleum-based liquid fuels as it offers benefits such as nearly zero emissions of pollutants, diverse primary energy source, high energy conversion efficiency, and the only by-product at point of use is water [5,6]. Hydrogen atom is utmost abundant in the universe but there is nearly no molecular hydrogen (H2) is available. However, hydrogen atom is available in the form of hydrocarbons, water, carbohydrates, etc. Carbon dioxide and water are used in photosynthesis by plants to produce carbohydrates which form building blocks of biomass. The solar energy which is used during photosynthesis is stored in the form of chemical bonds in biomass. The biomass on burning efficiently produces same amount of water and carbon dioxide, which were absorbed during production of biomass. Thus, the biomass carbohydrate contribution to global warming is zero. In addition, biomass carbohydrate is the most abundant sustainable bio resource as its supply is not limited. It is available in various forms of substrate such as crop residues [7], potatoes [8], sugarbeet residues [9], animal waste [10], vegetable and fruit waste from restaurants [11], and sewage wastes [12]. The overall energy produced by biomass carbohydrate each year is approximately six-fold of the global consumption [2]. Thus, a small fraction of biomass carbohydrate would be enough to substitute liquid transportation fuel. Moreover, the replacement of liquid transportation fuel from hydrogen fuel is a secure and competitive energy source as it can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and acid rain [13]. The utilization of biomass carbohydrate for hydrogen production has additional benefits as it reduces forest management costs. It mitigates climate change, and thus reduces risks to life, property, and economy. Therefore, biomass carbohydrate as raw material for hydrogen production is an ultimate way, which may lay the foundation of a stepwise transition of the current global economy towards the sustainable economy [14]. The decreasing order of price of the various energy sources are: biodiesel > hydrogen > ethanol > diesel > gasoline > methanol > electricity > carbohydrates [15]. Therefore, it is anticipated to have great impact on future economy to produce high-cost hydrogen from renewable low-cost biomass carbohydrate. Various methods such as chemical catalysis, biocatalysis, and their combinations, for the production of hydrogen from biomass carbohydrates are discussed to report the best method of hydrogen production."
1,Production of hydrogen,"The biomass carbohydrate can be converted into hydrogen by using chemical catalysis, biocatalysis, and their combinations ( Fig. 1). The chemical catalysis reactions are performed at harsh reaction conditions whereas biocatalysis are performed at modest reaction conditions."
2,Chemical catalysis,"2.1 Chemical catalysis Aqueous phase reforming (APR), gasification in critical water, pyrolysis and gasification are the chemical catalysis used for hydrogen production. All of these processes suffer from relatively low hydrogen yield i.e. 6–8 H2/glucose. APR is the reforming which occurs in an aqueous phase under high pressure (50–70 bar) and high temperature (400–550 K) [6]. In 2002, hydrogen was generated from biomass carbohydrates by utilizing a Pt based catalyst in a single-reactor at about 500 K temperature [16]. The APR of oxygenated carbohydrates has potential advantages over vapour-phase reforming such as (i) a better control over performance of catalytic process, (ii) major energy savings as the aqueous water and H2 gas separation is easier, (iii) lower CO emission i.e. ~100 ppm during the production of H2 from water-gas shift reaction, (iv) reduction in decomposed side-products in case of heating carbohydrates under modest conditions. However, the disadvantages are leaching and destabilization of the catalyst in the aqueous phase. This result in formation of decomposed side-products and coke, and hence very low yield of hydrogen is obtained [17]. Gasification in supercritical water (SCW) is performed at temperature > 647 K and pressure > 221 bar. Thus, it can gasify biomass with more than 35% of moisture content whereas the regular gasification gasify biomass with only 10–20% of moisture content [18]. In addition the hydrogen yield obtained is significant (up to at least 50%) and the conversion is 100% [19,20]. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of organic materials at very high temperature in absence of oxygen. In 17th and early 19th centuries, pyrolysis of biomass (primarily wood) and coal was popular for producing smokeless fuel e.g. fuel-gas and charcoal [21]. Now, pyrolysis is applied to treat hazardous wastes i.e. to transform coal into coke and biomass into syngas. The yield of the product through biomass pyrolysis depends on size of the particle and reaction temperature of the biomass [22]. The use of high temperature promotes gas production, while the use of lower temperature results in decomposition of the biomass into tar and char (or heavy oil) [23]. Gasification is generally performed at temperature higher than 1000 K and in the presence of steam and sub-stoichiometric oxygen. The process involves partial combustion of biomass to combustible gas rich in hydrogen and carbon monooxide. Gasification is more favourable than pyrolysis for production of H2, when coupled with water-gas shift reaction [24]. The use of integrated process containing a steam reformer, an air-blown bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, and a water-gas-shift membrane reactor, decomposes tar completely and thus generate ultrapure H2 gas via gasification of biomass [25,26]."
3,Biocatalysis,"2.2 Biocatalysis Biocatalysis is the catalysis mediated by living system such as microorganisms or protein enzymes at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. Biological catalysis has advantage over chemical catalysis, such as cost-effective bioreactors, lower energy input, and high selectivity [27,28]. However, rate of the reaction of biocatalysis is lower. Biocatalysis are the cost-efficient way of H2 production from organic resources having high-water content for example sewage sludge, wastewater, etc. [29,30]. Different methods of biocatalysis that can produce H2 are cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation (cell-free SyPaB), microbial electrohydrogenesis, dark fermentation (anaerobic fermentation), light fermentation, and their combination. Most of the methane or biohydrogen in nature is obtained by dark fermentation of carbohydrates or their metabolic products by anaerobic microorganisms [31]. Bacillus, Clostridium spp. (e.g. C. butyricum, C. beijerinki and C. pasteaurianum), and Enterobacter, are well-known species for biohydrogen production [32]. In principle, four mol of H2 can be generated from one mol of glucose that is known as Thauer limit [33]. However, the experimental H2 yields are usually lower than their respective theoretical yields. The higher H2 yields are generally associated with the formation of acetate, whereas the lower H2 yields are associated with the formation of propionate and reduced by-products such as lactic acid and alcohols [34]. Dark-fermentation is used to produce H2 from the waste water, but it is far from the practical solution for H2 production due to its poor yield [35]. In order to attain the theoretical yield or the Thauer-limit, H2 production should be conducted under near-equilibrium conditions [36]. However, in order to achieve the theoretical yield, strong efforts have been made by designing of the reactor, process optimization, pH control strategy and to modify the metabolism of an organism by using genetic engineering [37,38]. The overall H2 production can be increased by converting acetate into H2 by photo-fermentation or electrohydrogenesis (Fig. 1). However, this is thermodynamically unfavourable and thus extra energy input is required. The reactor in which electrohydrogenesis i.e. a bio-electrochemical process occurs is known as Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). A small amount of electricity supply is also required from outside sources during this process. The minimum 0.11 V of voltage is required at cathode for hydrogenesis. It has been reported that 2.01–3.95 mol of H2 / mol of acetic acid is obtained by using 0.2–0.8 V of voltage [39]. However, the scale up of MFC is restricted due to high capital cost as compare to the mature anaerobic digestion [40]. Alternatively, the photosynthetic bacteria utilize solar energy and organic acids for generation of hydrogen [41,42], but the collection of hydrogen from a non-point source has high hidden cost, which prevent it from scale-up. Also, the rate of production of hydrogen is lower than anaerobic fermentation by one order magnitude. The implementation of integrated multiple process for H2 production leads to more challenges in designing of the system such as reactor engineering, optimization of the process, operation and system maintenance [43]. Adjustment of the ratio of respiration to photosynthesis, cell biomass pre-treatment, and co-culture balance are few more challenges [43]. In order to attain the maximum substrate conversion into the product, the system should be able to provide essential environmental conditions and optimum media composition for the process [44,45]. Neutralization and dilution is needed for adjusting pH level and concentration of the organic acid before photo fermentation [46]. The feed C/N ratio in the effluent should not result into decrease of H2 production [47]. A more advanced and systematic application of cell-free synthetic enzyme engineering is the cell-free SyPaB [5,48] that involves assembly of large number (> 10) of purified enzymes and coenzymes for the desired product formation [49]. This enzymatic synthetic pathway has been demonstrated by Zhang et al. for the production of high yield hydrogen [50,51]. The pathway consist of (i) producing glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) by phosphorylation reaction in presence of glucan phosphorylase catalyst, where Pi is the inorganic phosphate, (ii) G-1-P is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by using phosphoglucomutase catalyst, (iii) 12 mol of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is generated per G-6-P by using pentose phosphate pathway, and (iv) H2 production from NADPH by utilizing hydrogenase. (1) (C6H10O5)n + H2O + Pi ↔ (C6H10O5)n-1 + G-1-P (2) G-1-P ↔ G-6-P (3) G-6-P + 12 NADP+ + 6 H2O ↔ 12 NADPH + 6 CO2 + 12 H+ + Pi (4) 12 NADPH + 12 H+ ↔ 12 H2 + 2 NADP+ The combination of Equations (1)–(4): (5) C6H10O5 + 7 H2O ↔ 12 H2 + 6 CO2 According to thermodynamic analysis, the overall reaction of carbohydrate to hydrogen conversion (Eq. 5) is an endothermic (ΔH° = +596 kJ/mol) [50] and spontaneous (ΔG° = −48.9 kJ/mol) [51] process. As two final products i.e. H2 and CO2 are gaseous under < 100 °C temperature and ~ 1 atm pressure, and thus the increase in entropy from aqueous (C6H10O5 + H2O) to gaseous phase results to occur the negative-enthalpy reactions. Consequently, Eq. 5 is the first chemical reaction that utilizes waste heat to generate H2 energy. When cellobiose is used as a substrate the overall yield obtained is 11.2 mol of hydrogen / mol of cellobiose [51]. This yield is higher than that of photobiological systems and is comparable to electrohydrogenesis and dark fermentations [3,39]. This slightly lower yield than the theoretical value is due to the accumulation of intermediates such as glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and NADPH, in a batch operation. However, 12H2 per glucose i.e. theoretical yield is anticipated to be obtained in a continuous reactor. The comparison of hydrogen yield obtained from carbohydrate by using cell-free SyPaB and microbial fermentation, is given in Table 1."
4,A combination of biocatalysis and catalysis,"2.3 A combination of biocatalysis and catalysis Another process used for the hydrogen production from carbohydrate is the combination of chemical and biological catalysis. First, polysaccharides are hydrolysed to glucose in presence of hydrolase enzymes such as amylase and cellulase [56,57]. Then, glucose is converted into ethanol with almost theoretical yield i.e. 2 mol ethanol / mol glucose in presence of ethanol-producing bacteria or yeasts [58,59]. Alternatively, ethanol is produced by consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) using a single type of microorganisms in a single reactor [60,61]. Ethanol after distillation is converted into H2 by using partial oxidation reforming [62,63]. The overall theoretical yield of H2 production by this hybrid process is 10H2 / glucose unit. However, due to the energy conversion losses during the process, the experimental H2 yield through this hybrid obtained is ~ 9H2 / glucose."
5,Advantages and obstacles of cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation,"2.4 Advantages and obstacles of cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation The opinion that cell-free biosystem is too expensive for producing biocommodities is due to the instability and cost associated with the enzymes and coenzymes. But now, cell-free SyPaB has been proved to be an ultimate solution for generating biocommodities including hydrogen [5] due to its several advantages. Among all the technologies for hydrogen production from carbohydrates, cell-free SyPaB is the ultimate way to achieve almost theoretical yield. In addition to high product yield, cell-free SyPaB has many other advantages such as energy efficiency, fast reaction rate and great engineering flexibility. The great engineering flexibility is a characteristic of SyPaB as the easy assembly of enzymes and the better control is possible due to availability of the building blocks. Additional advantages include in-situ monitoring, simplified metabolic load balancing, simplified metabolic load balancing, addition of enzymes and cofactors, real-time control, and reduced toxicity effects [64,65]. Because of the open nature of cell-free system, the reactors can be optimized at each step, perform uncoupled and coupled reactions, aligned in sequence or parallel, and can be of any size and shape, to achieve maximum performance [66,67]. The cell-free SyPaB applies chemistry, biology and engineering for designing novel biological entities such as biological parts, systems and devices with the aim of functioning better than their natural counterparts. The designing principles of cell-free SyPaB are now so well understood that one can design and build a new system without any constraints from physiology, cellular viability, complexity, and the presence of membranes [68]. The development of cell-free SyPaB cycle consists of five parts i.e. pathway reconstruction, enzyme selection, engineering, enzyme production, and the process engineering. The designing of synthetic enzymatic pathway assembly is generally based on metabolic pathways. Since, several different pathways are possible for the same biochemical reactions thus the pathway should be carefully designed by considering reaction equilibrium, thermodynamics, product separation, NAD(P) and ATP balance. Enzyme selection is based on substrate preference and catalytic mechanisms. The enzymes with high stability, catalytic efficiency, substrate selectivity, and low product inhibition are preferred. All enzymes are not good for cell-free SyPaB e.g. Pyrococcus furiosus fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase can hydrolyse many other substrates as well [69]. Since different enzymes obtained from different microorganisms may have different optima for temperature, pH, and even require metal ions as activators. Therefore, as much as possible, enzymes should be obtained from the same source so that they may have similar optima thus can form an enzyme complex to allow metabolite channelling [70,71]. However, catalytic efficiency of enzymes can be further enhanced such as thermostability [72,73] and cofactor preference for the industrial processes [74,75]. The low cost of enzyme production and purification is important for industrial process. The high-cell-density fermentation is often used to generate low-cost recombinant proteins as it offers many advantages over traditional fermentation such as lower water usage and higher final product concentrations [76,77]. Low-cost large scale purification of enzyme is conducted by desorption/adsorption [78,79] and precipitation [80,81]. The overall production cost of recombinant protein is estimated to be $20–40 / kg of their dry weight [82]. Process engineering includes immobilization and stabilization of enzymes and cofactors, reactor engineering (one or multi pot reactor), in-situ product separation, etc. In addition to the recycling of enzymes and cofactors, in-situ product removal is required as it increases yield of the product by decreasing reactant inhibition [83]. The cost associated with cell-free SyPaB is higher than microbial fermentation as microbes (living cells) can duplicate themselves but enzymes cannot. Thousands of proteins present in microbes are responsible for self-duplication and desired product formation. In contrast, only a small fraction of about ~20 cellular enzymes is responsible for desired transformation in cell-free SyPaB. This technology requires cost for the purification, addition of coenzymes, stabilization, and production. However, the cost is manageable by utilization of low cost abundant biomass carbohydrate. The cell-free SyPaB has several other advantages over microbial fermentation e.g. high concentration of the biocatalyst can be used in the reactor as macromolecules such as proteins are not the part of cell-free SyPaB. The cost of feedstock carbohydrates is responsible for final product price and thus product yield is a significant cost factor. Hence, the utilization of low cost renewable carbohydrate will become a key for the future industrial feed stock for the production of bio commodities. In addition, bio commodities produced by renewable carbohydrate will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain, improve rural economy, and thus has a better future perspective for the environment. In one-step microbial fermentation, the desired product formation is directly proportional to cell growth and production which occur in one-step e.g. carbohydrate production from membrane lipids [84]. Whereas, in two-step microbial fermentation, the product formation is not directly proportional to the cell growth i.e. cell growth and production occur in two different steps. Ethanol fermentation is an example of two-step processes. The cell-free SyPaB can be considered as typical two-step fermentation. First step is the cultivation for producing recombinant thermostable enzymes, which are then purified by using precipitation and adsorption [85]. Second step is the reconstitution of purified enzymes for biotransformation. If required, thermostable enzymes are immobilized to obtain higher turn-over number (TTN). Cell-free SyPaB is economically more beneficial over two-step microbial fermentation as the enzymes have greater order of magnitude and hence higher TTN than those of microbes [5]. In short, hydrogen production cost through cell-free SyPaB depends on three major cost components that are carbohydrates, coenzyme (NAD) and enzymes. The cost of hydrogen production decreases with increase in TTN of the enzymes in cell-free SyPaB. Higher is the TTN value of the enzymes, lower is the cost. If TTN value of enzymes is more than 107–108, the cost of hydrogen production is anticipated to be $ 1.30 / kg hydrogen [15], which is lower than the cost of hydrogen obtained from natural gases i.e. $ 2–2.70 / kg H2 [85]. The enzymes Thermotoga maritima fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase [86], T. maritima 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [87] and Clostridium thermocellum phosphoglucomutase [88], are thermostable with TTN values of more than 107. TTN value of C. thermocellum phosphoglucose isomerase is low but after immobilization by its adsorption on the cellulose surface, it becomes ultra-stable (TTN > 109) [89]. As a result of the development of stable building blocks (enzymes) of cell-free SyPaB [86–88] and engineered oxidoreductases [89,90], it is estimated that H2 production cost may decrease upto ~ $ 1.30 / kg hydrogen, where carbohydrate accounts for approximately 95% of its production costs [15]. The cell-free SyPaB presents a future platform for hydrogen production due to low production cost and high product yield."
6,Conclusion,"Hydrogen promises higher energy utilization efficiency and a clean energy future. The utilization of low cost renewable carbohydrate will become a key for the future industrial feed stock for the production of bio commodities including hydrogen. It has a better future perspective for the environment as it will reduce acid rain, greenhouse gas emissions, and improve rural economy. The production cost of hydrogen from carbohydrate depends on its obtained yield. Different technologies have been used to obtain hydrogen from carbohydrates such as gasification, pyrolysis, APR, SCW, anaerobic fermentation, ethanol fermentation, partial oxidation, reforming, and cell-free SyPaB. Among them, highest yield of hydrogen with low cost is obtained from cell-free SyPaB. In addition, the pathway design of cell-free SyPaB has several advantages such as use of less expensive bioreactors or bioreformers, modest reaction conditions, and acceptable reaction rates. In addition, there is the availability of thermostable enzymes for example DNA polymerase, glucose isomerase, amylase, cellulase, etc. As macromolecules such as proteins are not involved, high concentration of the biocatalyst can be used in the reactor. Additional advantages include in-situ monitoring, simplified metabolic load balancing, addition of enzymes and cofactors, absence of cell membrane, increase of reaction rate, real-time control, and reduced toxicity effects. The cell-free SyPaB reactors can be optimized for each synthetic pathway due to open nature of cell-free system. To achieve the optimal performance, the reactors can be aligned in parallel or sequence, can perform coupled or uncoupled reactions, and can be of any shape and size. Carbohydrate to hydrogen production by cell-free SyPaB addresses some more challenges such as infrastructure, distribution, storage and safety. Due to these advantages along with the availability of stable biomimetic cofactor analogues and stable enzyme building blocks and coenzymes, cell-free SyPaB seems to be an ultimate winner for low-cost transportation fuel production i.e. hydrogen production."
