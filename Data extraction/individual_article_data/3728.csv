0,Introduction,"Biomass is a promising candidate to serve as a sustainable source of organic carbon for the production of industrial chemicals [1]. The available strategies for transforming biomass to bio-fuels and/or chemicals have been attracted more interestingly. In future, the range of block chemicals from biorefineries is extensive and is expected to become greater with further research [2–5]. Generally, these block chemicals, i.e., the so-called platform molecules, are defined as chemicals containing multiple functional groups (e.g., acids, ketones, alcohols, amines, etc.). It is imperative to develop more efficient processes for catalytic upgrading of these block chemicals. However, lots of potential feedstocks are produced along with water from biomass by fermentation and/or hydrolysis routes [4]. However, removal of water from these compositions would be time-consuming and costly, and water has many advantages over more conventional solvents that present problems with toxicity and difficulties with handling and disposal. Considering these factors, the aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation (APHDO) reactions [6–21] are a crucial component of a number of strategies for the conversion of biomass-derived feedstocks into fuels and chemicals, e.g., hydrogenation of targeted functionalities of biomass including acids, sugars, aldehydes and furans. Many groups have extensively worked on these (e.g., Dumesic [8–11,15,20,22], Miller and Jackson groups [6,7,12,13,23], Huber [17,20,22,24–28], Corma [29], Clark and Luque groups [30,31]), including alcohol production from organic acids [6,12,17,23], gasoline production from bio-oils [28], and alkane production from carbohydrates [8,11,20,22]. The APHDO of carboxylic acids to alcohols has been investigated as a possible pathway for production of novel, high-valued products from bio-derived feedstock [23]. The direct APHDO of organic acids offers an alternative that is atom economical and amenable to continuous processing, and that obviates the need for intermediate esterification, use of organic solvents, and byproduct waste streams [23]. Recently, Miller and Jackson groups have studied the APHDO of propanoic acid and lactic acid over the Ru/C catalyst [6,12,13]. They demonstrated that production of alcohol was improved at lower temperature and higher hydrogen pressures, and the methane, ethane and propane were detected as the main by-products. In addition, many degraded alkane byproducts were produced in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to propylene glycol over the Ru-base catalysts [32–35]. In these reactions, the cleavage of C–C bonds and the formation of methane were proposed to occur primarily through a metal-catalyzed reaction on Ru [33]. Thus, selectively removing oxygen from the biomass-derived compounds is one of the key challenges in converting renewable biomass resources into fuels and chemicals. The oxygen is removed from the biomass with the APHDO by a combination of the CO hydrogenation, the C–O bond cleavage and the C–C bond cleavage reactions. If the larger alkanes or upgraded oxygenates are desired, then the C–C bond cleavage should be inhibited and the CO hydrogenation and the C–O bond cleavage should be strengthened. If the degraded alkanes are desired, then the C–C bond cleavage should be enhanced. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the CO hydrogenation and C–C bond cleavage reactions over the supported Ru catalysts, since the ruthenium is a promising catalyst for the conversion of biomass feedstock to various chemicals [6,12,13,31–37]. In this work, the APHDO of carboxylic acids (C2–C4), especially propanoic acid served as a probe molecule, was studied to understand the catalytic performance of several supported Ru catalysts (Ru/C, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3). The goal was to identify key reaction intermediate and to reveal the reaction mechanisms of the CO hydrogenation and C–C bond cleavage on supported Ru catalysts. The different reaction routes (CO hydrogenation of carboxyl and C–C bond cleavage) were investigated in detail. In particular, the DRIFTS of propanoic acid were performed to understand the mechanism of the C–C bond cleavage. The effect of support on the hydrodeoxygenation routes was discussed based on the characterizations of catalysts (H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, CO-FTIR and DRIFTS of propanoic acid). In the present contribution, the APHDO reaction can be tuned to make a targeted product (alkanes or upgraded oxygenates) from biomass-derived chemicals by the improvement in the catalyst design."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Supported Ru catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution containing corresponding metal precursors (RuCl3·3H2O, Shaaxi Kaida Chemical Engineering Co., Ltd., China) at ambient for 12h, followed by drying at 120°C for 12h. Subsequently, the catalysts were calcined at 500°C in air for 6h except the Ru/C catalyst. Prior to impregnation, the supports ZrO2 (S BET =58m2 g−1, Jiangsu Qianye Co., Ltd., China), γ-Al2O3 (S BET =197m2 g−1, Shandong Aluminum Co., Ltd., China) and granular coconut carbon (referred to as C, S BET =1091m2 g−1, Liyang Zhuxi Carbon Co., Ltd., China) were soaked in deionized water for 24h at ambient, and then dried at 120°C. The catalysts are generally labeled as (n)metal/support, in which the number n represents nominal metal loading, e.g., the 1.0Ru/ZrO2 stands for a Ru metal supported on the ZrO2 support with 1.0wt% metal loading."
3,Catalyst characterizations,"2.2 Catalyst characterizations N2-physisorption was carried out at −196°C in a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 (USA) instrument. Before the measurements, the samples were first outgassed overnight at 250°C to 50mTorr. The specific surface area was estimated by the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method. Metal dispersion was determined by CO and H2 pulse chemisorption performed in a Micrometrics Auto Chem. 2920 (USA) apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The pre-treatment of catalyst was performed in the H2 flow at 300°C for 2h, followed by degassing in flowing Ar at 350°C. Pulse chemisorption was carried out at 0°C. Several pulses of H2 (or CO) were injected at regular intervals, until the area of the recorded peaks became constant. Dispersion values were calculated from quantification of the chemisorbed H2 (or CO) based on the assumption that the stoichiometry factor of chemisorbed H2 (or CO) to surface Ru equals H (CO)/Ru=1. The acidic property of the catalyst was studied by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). The NH3-TPD was measured by the same apparatus with chemisorption. The catalysts (100mg) were pretreated in flowing H2 at 300°C for 2h, followed by degassing in flowing He at 350°C and then cooled to 100°C under a 50cm3 min−1 He flow. The pretreated samples were saturated with NH3 for 1h at 100°C, with subsequent flushing with helium at 100°C for 2h to remove the physisorbed NH3. Finally, the sample was heated from 100°C up to 800°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR) was performed in the same apparatus with chemisorption. When needed, a quadrupolar mass spectrometer (MS) was connected with the TPR system for the detailed analysis of the outlet gas. The samples (100mg) were dried under Argon flow at 150°C for 60min, and then cooled to 40°C. Then, the Argon flow was switched to 10vol% H2/Ar mixed gas, and a cold trap with isopropanol–liquid nitrogen slurry was added to condense the water vapor. After the TCD signal returned to the baseline, the reduction was carried out from 40°C up to 800°C with a ramp of 10°Cmin−1. CO-FTIR spectra were recorded by an infrared spectrometer (VERTEX70, Bruker, Germany), equipped with KBr optics which works at the liquid nitrogen temperature. The infrared cell with ZnSe windows was connected to a gas-feed system with a set of stainless steel gas lines, which allowed the in situ measurement for the adsorption of CO. Before measurements, the catalysts were reduced in situ at 300°C for 2h. After the reduction procedure, the system was cooled to 20°C. The CO-FTIR spectra were recorded following adsorption of CO at 20°C, subsequently, desorption of CO in He at the higher temperature (50–170°C). The propanoic acid chemisorption on the catalyst surface was performed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectra (DRIFTS) measurement using a VERTEX70 spectrometer cooled by liquid nitrogen. A vacuum pump was used to pull the propanoic acid vapor through the chamber for in situ DRIFTS measurements. Before the measurements, the catalysts were reduced in situ at 300°C for 3h. After the reduction procedure, the system was cooled to 180°C and the DRIFTS spectra of propanoic acid were recorded. Then, the temperature was increased from 180°C to 210 or 270°C under flowing H2. For the DRIFTS spectra of propanoic acid adsorption on catalysts in the absence of H2, the system was cooled to 50°C after the reduction of catalysts, and then the DRIFTS spectra were recorded at 50°C, subsequently, recorded with TPD (50–400°C). The spectra were recorded with a cumulative averaging of 64 scans and at a resolution of 4cm−1."
4,Catalytic test,"2.3 Catalytic test Experimental studies were carried out using a continuous-flow trickle-bed reactor (i.d. 11mm and length 1300mm), in which 6.0g of catalyst was packed. Before the reactions, the catalysts were first activated by in situ reduced in a H2 flow of 80cm3 min−1 at 300°C for 3h. To ensure an aqueous-phase system, the APHDO of carboxylic acids was operated at 6.4MPa total pressures. The feedstock was introduced into the reactor with an HPLC pump along with a co-feed H2 of gas flowing at 80cm3 min−1. The effluent aqueous phase was collected in a gas–liquid separator immersed in ice–water. The products were obtained when the reaction reached the steady state. The mass balance closure in every experiment was achieved within 5% deviation from the inlet feedstock. The aqueous phase products in the ice trap were analyzed off-line by an Agilent 6980 gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a FID detector and a DB-WAX (30m×0.32mm) capillary column. The concentrations of H2, CO and CO2 were determined on-line by an Agilent 7980 GC equipped with a Porapak Q stainless steel packed column, a PLOT Q packed column, a molecular sieve (5A) packed column, and a TCD detector. The gaseous alkanes were analyzed on-line by an Agilent 7980 GC equipped with a FID detector and an Al2O3 capillary column. The conversion and the selectivity of products in the present study were calculated based on the following equations: Conversion ( % ) = 100 − Carbon mol of reactants after reaction Carbon mol of reactants in feedstock × 100 Selectivity ( % ) = Carbon mol of each product in gas or aqueous phase Sum of carbon mol for all products × 100"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Catalyst characterizations,"3.1 Catalyst characterizations 3.1.1 BET surface area and pulse chemisorption of H2 and CO BET surface area and Ru dispersion of catalysts are shown in Table 1 . The Ru/ZrO2 catalyst has a small BET surface area of 52m2 g−1 compared with the Ru/C (1021m2 g−1) and Ru/Al2O3 (185m2 g−1) catalysts. The Ru dispersion determined by H2 or CO pulse chemisorption increases in the same order: Ru/Al2O3 <Ru/ZrO2 <Ru/C. Nevertheless, the Ru dispersion measured by H2 pulse chemisorption is lower than that determined by CO pulse chemisorption. This behavior may result from the strongly corrosive chemisorption and/or multiple adsorption of CO on the supported Ru catalysts [38]. 3.1.2 Surface acidity of catalysts The ammonia desorption curves and the acidity values of catalysts (expressed as the amount of desorbed ammonia per unit surface area of catalyst, μmolNH3 m−2) are compiled in Fig. 1 and Table 1, respectively. The density of acid sites on the catalyst surface increases in the following order: Ru/C<Ru/ZrO2 <Ru/Al2O3 (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, just one weak peak appears at 190°C in the profile of Ru/C, and no peak is observed obviously above 300°C. In case of Ru/ZrO2, two main peaks appear in the temperature range of 100–200°C and 200–400°C, indicating the presence of weak and medium acid sites. The Ru/Al2O3 catalyst has three peaks corresponding to weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively. 3.1.3 Temperature programmed reduction of H2 Fig. 2 illustrates the H2-TPR profiles for the unsupported bulk RuO2 and the supported Ru catalysts. The unsupported RuO2 shows a highly sharp peak at 102°C. The amount of H2 consumed in the reduction of RuO2 is calculated, which is almost comparable with the theoretical value (198μmolg−1) calculated by assuming the reduction of RuO2 to Ru. In fact, Hosokawa et al. [39] have reported that Ru ion in RuO2 changes directly from Ru4+ to Ru0 without forming intermediate valence states such as Ru3+ or Ru2+. Thus, the H2 consumption in TPR runs can be ascribed to the reduction of RuO2 to Ru metal. For the supported Ru catalysts, the reduction temperature is strongly dependent on the nature of support. The reduction peaks are observed at around 85°C and 150–300°C for the Ru/C catalyst. The temperature of first peak is lower than that of unsupported RuO2, indicating that this peak is due to reduction of well dispersed RuO2 on the active carbon surface [40,41]. Besides, the MS analysis confirms that CH4 formation connects with the peak above 150°C. It can be concluded that the supported Ru particles catalyze the breaking of the weakest C–C bonds on the surface of active carbon [42]. The efficiency of this catalytic action improves greatly at the higher temperature, and it is indicated by the uphill of the TCD signal in the TPR of Ru/C catalyst (Fig. 2). In the case of Ru/ZrO2, two reduction peaks are observed at around 90°C and 132°C, which are in agreement with the previous report [43]. Furthermore, a broad peak appears at around 430°C is due to the promoted support reduction through spillover of hydrogen species from Ru onto ZrO2 [44]. For the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, two overlapped H2 consumption peaks occur at relatively higher temperature of 120–200°C than that of bulk RuO2 (102°C). It is usually accepted that the reduction of RuO2 to Ru at lower temperature is attributed to highly dispersed RuO2 species, while at higher temperature is attributed to the reduction of well crystallized RuO2 particles [40,41]. For the Ru/C and Ru/ZrO2 catalysts, the low temperature peaks in the TPR are dominant, while the high temperature peaks are great for the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. These indicate that the well-dispersed Ru particles on the Ru/C and Ru/ZrO2 catalysts are greater than those of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the metal-support interaction of catalyst can greatly influence the reducibility of the Ru species. For all catalysts, the maximal reduction temperature increases in the following order: Ru/C<Ru/ZrO2 <Ru/Al2O3, indicating that the support material greatly influences the reducibility of the Ru species. Indeed, the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) is the reason of the increased reduction temperature of the ruthenium species on Al2O3 compared with ZrO2 [45]. Asakura and Iwasawa [46] have reported that the Ru species on Al2O3 have strong chemical interaction between metal and support through the Ru–O–Al bonding by extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) analysis. They suggested that the interaction between metal and support could be explained by the electronegativities of support metal ions. 3.1.4 CO-FTIR FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO is a method for the characterization of the electronic states of supported metals. Several FTIR studies have been conducted with Ru catalysts employing the probe molecule CO [47–49], where the ability of adsorbed carbon monoxide to respond sensitively to the environment of the adsorbing metal atoms is utilized to indicate the electronic state of the adsorption site by the C–O vibration frequency. Generally, CO linearly bonded on Ru0 produces a low frequency (LF) absorption bands in the 1990–2060cm−1 region [49,50]. High frequency (HF) bands in around 2060–2156cm−1 region are attributed to the multicarbonyl species adsorbed on partially oxidized Ru sites [49–51]. These Ru sites are mostly produced by the oxidative disruption of very small Ru clusters with the participation of hydroxyl groups of the support [49,50]. The FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on the 1.0Ru/ZrO2 and 1.0Ru/Al2O3 samples are displayed in Fig. 3 . In the case of Ru/ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 3a), the 2033cm−1 band disappears at 80°C with increasing temperature, and the band located at 2135cm−1 decreases without exhibiting any frequency shift and disappears at 170°C. At the same time, the 2002cm−1 band appears at 50°C and becomes clear with a red shift from 2003 to 1996cm−1 with the temperature increasing from 50 to 170°C. The intensity of 2066 and 2002cm−1 bands decrease obviously from 50 to 110°C, but they can still exhibit high intensity at the higher temperatures. In the case of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 3b), adsorption of CO at 20°C produces three IR features at 2125, 2068 and 2025cm−1. The band located at 2025cm−1 exhibits a little shift to 2015cm−1 at 110°C and disappears at above 140°C with the increase of temperature. The intensity of 2068cm−1 band decreases and even disappears with the temperature increasing from 20 to 110°C. Subsequently, the 2051cm−1 appears at 140°C and its intensity increases with temperature increasing to 170°C. Meanwhile, the 2125cm−1 band follows the same trend of disappearance/appearance at between 110 and 140°C and then becomes stronger and broader with temperature increasing. Fig. 3a and b demonstrate that the thermal stability of the CO species adsorbed on Ru/ZrO2 catalyst is different from that of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. The 2002 and 2066cm−1 bands are more stable over the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst than that the 2025 and 2068cm−1 bands over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. The frequency of LF band on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst (2002cm−1) is lower than that of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (2025cm−1). This may indicate that the electronic state of Ru species is different between the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. In addition, a particular interest is that the 2051 and 2125cm−1 bands follow the trend of disappearance/appearance upon thermal desorption over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, while this trend is not observed on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. Generally, these HF bands are attributed to multicarbonyl species adsorbed on oxidized Ru sites [49–51]. Indeed, Chin et al. [49] have demonstrated that a significant part of Ru species exists in its oxidized form on the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and CO-FTIR techniques. The current CO-FTIR study shows that the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits relatively unstable adsorption of CO species and reappearance of multicarbonyl species at the high temperatures compared with the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. It is possible that the Ru metal over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is more easily reoxidated and is more unstabilized at the high temperature than that over the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst, which may be attributed to the nature of support and the redox behavior of the dispersed metal [51]. Furthermore, Mazzieri et al. [52] have reported that the HF bands characterize electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+) in different oxidation states. They have confirmed that the electron deficient species are the origin of the HF bands by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. Mitsui et al. [53] have analyzed the electronic state of supported Ru catalysts by XPS. They have reported that the binding energy of reduced Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (280.8eV) is higher than that of reduced Ru/ZrO2 catalyst (279.8eV). Therefore, it is speculated that the electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+) on the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst are more than those on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst."
7,DRIFTS of propanoic acid over the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts,"3.2 DRIFTS of propanoic acid over the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts In order to obtain the information about the adsorbed intermediates on catalyst surface, the DRIFTS of propanoic acid adsorbed on the catalysts were performed. In the case of Ru/ZrO2 catalyst, Fig. 4 a illustrates that the two bands at 1303 and 1382cm−1 may be ascribed to δ s(–CH3) and δ as(–CH3) [54–57], and the three weak bands at 2886, 2950, and 2983cm−1 are ascribed to the C–H stretching in ν as(–CH3), ν as(–CH2) and ν s(–CH3) [55,56,58], respectively. At 50°C, a broad band at 1521cm−1 and a very weak shoulder band at 1475cm−1 are ascribed to asymmetric ν as(–COO) and symmetric ν s(–COO) stretching of adsorbed propionate species [55,56], respectively. As temperature increases from 50 to 400°C, the 1475cm−1 band appears and its intensity becomes very weak at 400°C. The 1303, 1382 and 1521cm−1 bands don’t exhibit any frequency shift but change of intensity. However, the ν(–CO) stretching of propanoyl species shifts from 1682 to 1621cm−1 [55,56,59] and the intensity of band becomes very weak at 400°C. At the same time, the bands of adsorbed CO at 1868, 1987 and 2065cm−1 [49–51], as well as, the bands of adsorbed CO2 at 2335 and 2362cm−1 [60] appear above 200°C. Based on this information, it is speculative that the configuration of adsorbed propanoyl species is transformed to another configuration which is easily dissociated to CO through decarbonylation with the increase of temperature. However, the decomposition of propionate to CO/CO2 cannot be excluded at the high temperature. For the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4b), in the same way, the bands of δ(–CH3) (1308 and 1370cm−1), ν(–CH3) (2889, 2946 and 2981cm−1), ν(–COO) of propionate (1503 and 1538cm−1), and ν(–CO) stretching of propanoyl (1707cm−1) were observed at 50°C. The intensity of these bands decreases greatly without exhibiting any obvious frequency shift with the increasing of temperature, just the 1707cm−1 band (ν(–CO) stretching of propanoyl) exhibits a little red shift to 1692cm−1. However, the bands of adsorbed CO and CO2 appear very weakly even at the higher temperatures. These results display that the propionate and propanoyl species on the Ru/Al2O3 catalysts surface become thermal unstable, and yet the decomposition of propionate and propanoyl species to CO/CO2 is not occurred. These indicate that the surface species may be hydrogenated to propanol, although it is not confirmed by the DRIFTS. From these results, the C–C bond cleavage via the decarbonylation of propanoyl species or the decomposition of propionate species is significantly inhibited on the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, and the formation of CO/CO2 from the propanoyl or propionate species is greatly facilitated on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst surface. To understand the surface reaction of intermediates in the presence of H2, the in situ DRIFTS spectra for propanoic acid adsorbed on the samples were performed under vacuum at 180°C, followed by introducing H2 at different temperature. In the case of the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 5 ), the spectra of adsorbed propionate (1483 and 1521cm−1) [55,56] and the analogous δ s(–CH3) and δ as(–CH3) stretching (1307 and 1400cm−1) [54–57] are observed. In addition, the C–H stretching in ν as(–CH3), ν as(–CH2) and ν s(–CH3) is not clearly observed in 2800–3000cm−1 region, and only very weak bands at both 2939 and 2983cm−1 are observed above 180°C. The vanishing/weakening of C–H stretching region indicates that significant dissociation takes place [54]. As temperature increases, the spectrum shows two bands at 1949 and 2042cm−1 which are assigned to the adsorption of CO on Ru particles [49,60,61]. The appearance of adsorbed CO indicates the significant dissociation and/or decarbonylation of propanoyl species on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst surface. At 200 and 210°C, the band of adsorbed CH4 appears at 3017cm−1 [62], which may be formed by methanation of the adsorbed CO on the Ru particles. Moreover, when the H2 is firstly introduced at 180°C, the adsorption of propanoyl (1634cm−1 band) [55,56,59] becomes weaker and the adsorption of CO on the surface becomes stronger. This phenomenon indicates that the presence of H2 could favor the dissociation of propanoyl. In addition, the initial spectra of CO2 clearly appear at 200°C, while the spectra of CO clearly appear at the lower temperature (180°C) than those of CO2. These demonstrate that the presence of H2 could favor the decarbonylation of propanoyl species other than decarboxylation of propionate species. Accordingly, we suggest that the adsorbed propanoic acid species over the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst have a high selectivity towards C−C bond cleavage by decarbonylation of propanoyl species. In the presence of H2, the methane can be formed by the methanation of CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The production of CO2 may be due to the decomposition of propionate species or the oxidation of adsorbed CO at the higher temperature. In the case of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, Fig. 6 a shows a dominant band at 1693cm−1 and a very weak shoulder band at 1625cm−1, which may be ascribed to two different stretching modes of ν(–CO) in propanoyl [55,56]. The spectra of adsorbed propionate (1498 and 1548cm−1) [55,56] and the analogous δ s(–CH3) and δ as(–CH3) stretching (1303 and 1375cm−1) [54–57] are also observed. Additionally, Fig. 6b shows no spectra of adsorbed CO and CH4 are detected below 210°C, only very weak 1960 and 3017cm−1 bands are observed at 270°C. Therefore, in the presence of H2, the C−C bond cleavage by the decarbonylation of propanoyl species is also inhibited over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst compared with the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst."
8,Catalytic test,"3.3 Catalytic test 3.3.1 Hydrodeoxygenation of propanoic acid over the Ru/C catalyst Fig. 7 shows the effects of temperature, pressure and WHSV on the catalytic activity and product selectivity for the APHDO of propanoic acid over the Ru/C catalyst. The products include propanol, alkanes (methane, ethane, and propane), and a trace amount of the degraded oxygenates (ethanol and acetic acid). Interestingly, nearly equimolar amounts of methane and ethane were produced. As shown in Fig. 7a, as the increase of temperature, the catalytic activity increased significantly (from 27.9 to 93.5% for conversion). The selectivity of propanol decreased sharply (from 45.8 to 2.7%), and the selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes increased greatly. Accordingly, the high temperature facilitates the conversion of propanoic acid to methane, ethane and propane via C−C or C−O cleavage, while low temperature favors the formation of propanol via CO hydrogenation of carboxyl. As shown in Fig. 7b, the conversion of propanoic acid increased from 46.5 to 89% significantly with the total pressure of the system increasing from 2.0 to 9.6Mpa. The selectivities of methane, ethane and propanol increased slightly, especially for propanol with a very small increase (1.6–3.2%), and the selectivity of propane decreased from 14.2 to 6.1%. Therefore, the C−C bond cleavage reaction is predominant at the high temperature (200°C), and the hydrogen pressure has a little effect on the product selectivity but improves the catalytic activity greatly. Fig. 7c displays that the selectivity of propanol increased from 0.1 to 44.9%, while the selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes decreased from 99.9 to 52.3%, as the conversion of propanoic acid decreased with the WHSV in the range of 1.0–6.0h−1. This indicates the increase of WHSV can improve the production of propanol with the decrease of the selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes. 3.3.2 Hydrodeoxygenation of carboxylic acids (C2–C4) over the Ru/C catalyst The APHDO of several carboxylic acids (C2–C4) over the Ru/C catalyst, including acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid and isobutyric acid, was also investigated. As shown in Table 2 , the main products include methane, alcohol and alkane with corresponding carbon atom to the substrate (C n -alcohol and C n -alkane), and alkane with one carbon atom less than the substrate (C n−1-alkane). At the high temperature (above 180°C), the alkanes are predominant products. It is certain that the monocarboxylic acids have the common hydrodeoxygenation performance over the supported Ru catalysts, i.e., the hydrogenation of carboxyl to alcohol, the cleavage of C−O bond to corresponding alkane, and the formation of equimolar quantities of methane and C n−1-alkane via the cleavage of C−C bond adjacent to the oxygen atom. In summary, the CO hydrogenation of carboxyl and C−C bond cleavage routes is strongly affected by the reaction conditions for the APHDO of carboxylic acids. However, the catalysis of the supported Ru catalysts is strongly dependent on the nature of supports [34]. 3.3.3 Hydrodeoxygenation of propanoic acid over Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts As shown in Table 3 , the conversion of porpanoic acid increased significantly from 35.2 to 96.0% with increasing the temperature from 170 to 210°C over the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. The selectivity of propanol decreased sharply from 43.2 to 3.6%, and the selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes increased correspondingly. However, the conversion of propanoic acid increased mildly from 17.1 to 61.8% over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivity of propanol decreased slightly from 87.7 to 67.9% and the selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes exhibited no significant increase. Obviously, the high temperature favors the cleavage of C−C and C−O bonds (production of C1–C3 alkanes), while the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst has a lower selectivity of C1–C3 alkanes and a high selectivity of propanol. Nevertheless, the conversion of propanoic acid over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is lower than that of Ru/C and Ru/ZrO2 catalysts under the same conditions. In high pressure aqueous environment, generally, the changes of support structure during reaction could induce the decrease of catalytic activity [63]. The Ru/Al2O3 catalyst exhibiting the lowest conversion of propanoic acid is likely ascribed to the structural unstable of γ-alumina in aqueous environment [63]. In addition, the low conversion of Ru/Al2O3 may be attributed to the low Ru dispersion (Table 1). In this work, we focus mainly on the difference of reaction routes (CO hydrogenation, C−C bond cleavage) over the Ru/C, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. Fig. 8 shows the behavior of C−C bond cleavage/CO hydrogenation as a function of temperature over the Ru/C, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts. The cleavage of C−C bond to produce methane and ethane is greatly inhibited over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, as the temperature increases, the (CH4 +C2H6)/(C3H8 +C3H7OH) molar ratio obtained from the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst increases much less than that of the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/C catalysts. As given in Table 4 , under similar conversions of 35–40%, about 92.6% selectivity for C3-products (propanol and propane) are obtained over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst, while only 52% and 32.6% are obtained over the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/C catalysts, respectively. The selectivity of C−C bond cleavage products (methane and ethane) for the Ru/ZrO2 (46.3%) and Ru/C (66.1%) catalysts are apparently higher than that of the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (3.7%). Under the similar conversions of 47–52%, the selectivity of C3-products (90.3%) for the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is approximately double of Ru/ZrO2 catalyst (46.4%) and is about four times of Ru/C catalyst (22.8%). Correspondingly, the selectivity of C−C bond cleavage products (6.3%) is greatly lower than that of the Ru/ZrO2 (51.5%) and Ru/C (70.7) catalysts. It is concluded that the production of propanol and propane by the CO hydrogenation of propanoic acid is improved over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst where the cleavage of C−C bond to methane and ethane is greatly inhibited. However, the cleavage of C−C bond is greatly enhanced over the Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/C catalysts. These results are also confirmed by the DRIFTS results of propanoic acid (Figs. 4–6). In addition, the contribution of metal should be considered in the APHDO reaction in order to selectively produce higher or lower alkanes, since C−C bond cleavage generally occurs on metal sites. As shown in Table 5 , under similar conversions, the products of C−C bond cleavage increase from 44.1 to 55.9% with the increase of Ru metal loading for Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. The same trend is observed over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (from 8.9 to 16.6%), but it is much lower than that of Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. Consequently, the higher amounts of Ru will lead to a favorable formation of CH4 and C2H6 from propanoic acid. Although the high Ru contents favors the formation of methane and ethane from propanoic acid, the Al2O3 support in combination with Ru metal still can favor the CO hydrogenation of carboxyl compared with that of ZrO2 support. For the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst with high Ru contents, the selectivity of CO hydrogenation products is still much higher than C–C bond cleavage products. It is indicated that the CO hydrogenation and C–C bond cleavage are mainly dependent on the nature of support. However, the contribution of Ru metal should be also considered. Therefore, the balancing each contribution of metal and support is crucial in the APHDO reaction in order to selectively produce desired production. 3.3.4 Hydrodeoxygenation of carboxylic aicd in the absence of H2 We performed another test to investigate the formation of CO/CO2 and their methanation in aqueous-phase system. The catalytic test was carried out over the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst at 200°C, 6.4MPa, 3.0h−1, 80cm3 min−1 H2 or N2 flow, and 0.83M propanoic acid as feedstock. After catalyst was reduced in a H2 flow, the H2 was purged out and the reaction pressure was adjusted by N2. After running 60h, the N2 flow was switched to H2 flow. As shown in Fig. 9 , before switching to H2 flow, the low propanoic acid conversion (ca. 30%) is observed. The concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the effluent gas are 0.9 and 0.5%, respectively. However, the CO is still not detected in the effluent gas. In fact, the CO and water can be transformed to CO2 and H2 by water gas shift (WGS), and the methanation of CO and/or CO2 can give the CH4 [64]. The extremely low levels of CO compared to the amounts of CO2 and CH4 could be ascribed to the high WGS activity and high methanation activity of CO on the Ru catalyst [64]. Under similar conditions, Davda et al. [64] reported that the relatively low levels of CO were produced compared to the amount of CO2 formed from the aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol, e.g., ethylene glycol reforming over the supported Ru catalyst resulted in CO/CO2 ratios of 0.05, even lower amounts of CO were produced over Pt and Rh, with CO/CO2 ratios lower than 0.004. Therefore, it is accepted that the CO is not detected in our experiments due to its concentration is below the detection limit of GC. When the N2 flow was substituted with H2, the concentration of H2 in the effluent gas increased from 0.24 to 91% on the time stream, and the conversion of propanoic acid increased greatly from 31 to 99%. At the same time, the concentration of CH4 in the effluent gas increased from 0.5% to the maximum value of 2.8%, while the concentration of CO2 decreased from 0.9 to 0.02% and the CO was still not detected. It is sure that the catalytic activity can be significantly improved by increasing H2 partial pressure. In this reaction system, the concentration of CO2 became less and less (0.02%) with the increase of H2 partial pressure, as well as, no CO was observed in the effluent gas all along, indicating that the nearly completed methanation of CO or CO2 was possible for the APHDO of propanoic acid over the supported Ru catalysts."
9,APHDO mechanism of carboxylic acids,"3.4 APHDO mechanism of carboxylic acids The detail reaction mechanisms, for conversion of acetic acid to ethanol, have been studied over transition metal catalysts by combined experimental and DFT calculations theoretical study [17,65]. In the postulated mechanism, acetic acid dissociates to form an acetyl surface species directly or via acetate intermediate. The acetyl intermediate is then subsequently hydrogenated to ethanol via the formation of an acetaldehyde surface intermediate. In addition, Mavrikakis and Barteau reviewed the decomposition mechanisms of oxygenates on transition metal surfaces [66]. They concluded that decarbonylation of aldehydes and alcohols over Group VIII metals to produce CO via the formation of acyl intermediates on metal surfaces [57,66,67]. The formation of acetyl is the likely precursor to the formation of CO from C2 oxygenates [57]. Indeed, several references have reported that the decomposition of C2-oxygenates, such as acetic acid and acetaldehyde, to CO is preceded by the formation of surface-bound acetyl intermediate [57,67–70]. It is suggested that the β C–H bond activation of the methyl group on acetyl or acetate to produce ketene intermediate (CH2CO), is rate determining for CO/CO2 and methyl surface fragments production with C–C scission of ketene. Henderson et al. have also proposed that the adsorbed ketene (CH2CO) as η 2(C, C) on the Ru crystals may dissociate to CO and methylene [71,72]. In this study, the C3-products (propanol and propane) as well as the equimolar amounts of methane and C n−1-alkane were observed in the all APHDO tests of carboxylic acids. The DRIFTS spectra of propanoic acid adsorbed on the Ru/ZrO2 catalyst surface (Figs. 4 and 5) showed that the CO was formed by the decarbonylation of propanoyl species by changing of its configuration with the increase of temperature, and then it was hydrogenated to methane in the presence of H2 at high temperature. Accordingly, we think that the acyl is a key intermediate for the CO hydrogenation and C–C bond cleavage of carboxylic acid functional group. The hydrodeoxygenation mechanism of carboxylic acid over the supported Ru catalyst is proposed in Scheme 1 . The carboxylic acid molecule dissociates to form the acyl surface species directly or via carboxylate intermediate over Ru metal firstly. Consequently, one pathway is that the acyl intermediate is catalyzed by Ru metal to produce adsorbed CO plus hydrocarbon moieties after the β C–H bond activation of the acyl. Finally, the methane and C n−1-alkane are produced by hydrogenation of adsorbed CO and hydrocarbon moieties on Ru metal. Another pathway is that the acyl intermediate is hydrogenated to alcohol via formation of aldehyde intermediate. In addition, a fast equilibrium reaction may be existed between the acyl species and the adsorbed alcohol/aldehyde species. This equilibrium reaction will lead to the C–C bond cleavage of the alcohol/aldehyde. Furthermore, the produced alcohol from carboxylic acid can be further hydrogenated to corresponding alkane. This was reported for alcohols converted into corresponding alkane via dehydration-hydrogenation over the acid/metal bifunctional catalysts [8,11,22]."
10,Effect of support on reaction of C–C bond cleavage,"3.5 Effect of support on reaction of C–C bond cleavage The reaction kinetics data and DRIFTS characterization results reveal that the C–C bond cleavage via decarbonylation of the acyl is greatly inhibited over the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst compared to the Ru/ZrO2 (or Ru/C) catalyst. The inhibition ability of C–C bond cleavage increases in the follow order: Ru/C<Ru/ZrO2 <Ru/Al2O3. Based on the characterizations of catalysts (H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, CO-FTIR), the metal–support interaction and surface acidity of catalysts increases in the following order: Ru/C<Ru/ZrO2 <Ru/Al2O3. In addition, the CO-FTIR reveals that the electronic state of Ru species on the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is electron deficient compared with those of Ru/ZrO2 catalyst. Therefore, it is possible that the effect of support on the reaction route for APHDO of carboxylic acids is attributed to these factors of catalyst, i.e., surface acidity, metal–support interaction and electronic state of Ru species. The stronger metal–support interaction, the more electron deficient ruthenium species (Ru n+) and the more acidity sites on the catalyst will lead to the higher extent of CO hydrogenation or lower extent of C–C bond cleavage."
11,Conclusions,"For carboxylic acid APHDO over the Ru/C, Ru/ZrO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts, the high temperature, as well as, the catalysts with high Ru loading Ru loading facilitated the cleavage of C–C bond, while acidic support in combination with a metal favored the hydrogenation of carboxyl. The DRIFTS results revealed that the C–C bond cleavage was induced by the decarbonylation of acyl on the catalyst. The C–C bond cleavage was favored in the order of Ru/C>Ru/ZrO2 >Ru/Al2O3. Based on H2-TPR, NH3-TPD and CO-FTIR, the effect of support on the reaction routes may be attributed to surface acidity, electronic state of Ru species and metal–support interaction of catalyst."
