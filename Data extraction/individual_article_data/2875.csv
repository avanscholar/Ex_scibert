0,Introduction,"Hydrogen production from water under irradiation with visible or near ultraviolet (UV) light has become an increasingly popular subject of research [1–29]. This lightest gas can serve as a green highly energetic fuel and raw material for many industrial and fine chemical syntheses. Pure or loaded with noble metals, TiO2 has been the photocatalyst of choice for photocatalytic H2 generation from water. TiO2 without noble metals usually has very low rate of H2 evolution not exceeding 10–20μmol/h for aqueous solutions of sacrificial electron donors [20,30]. In contrast, loading of noble metals such as Pt, Pd, or Au over TiO2 results in H2 generation rates up to 1000–2000μmol/h even in small laboratory scale reactors [1–6,8,16–19,31]. The majority of studies utilize suspensions of photocatalysts to carry out the process of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Some difficulties are met in performing this reaction including joint evolution of other gaseous products in mixture with hydrogen and difficulties in maintaining and separating the photocatalyst in suspension state. Application of membranes can help to solve these problems. Photocatalyst is retained in the flow reactor as suspension via separating it out with filtration membranes [32,33]. Proton conducting membranes that are impermeable for hydrogen can be used for separation of oxygen or CO2 and hydrogen evolution processes [34,35]. However, such separation requires external electron transport relay, which often needs application of external voltage for evolution of hydrogen. Mass transport of gaseous compounds from the reaction mixture is facilitated using inert hydrophobic porous membrane [36]. Supporting of photocatalyst and providing fast mass transport are easily achieved by loading photocatalyst over reactants permeable membranes [37–47]. The base membrane can be made of inorganic materials such as γ- or α-Al2O3 [37,41,43]. The advantage of flexibility is added if one utilizes porous polymeric membranes for supporting photocatalysts [7,38,39,46–55]. The membranes can be also self-supporting, i.e., made entirely of TiO2 [37,41]. Incorporation of photocatalysts inside Nafion membranes allows creation of novel photocatalytic systems which properties are strongly influenced by the membrane chemical structure [44,56–58]. Nafion is produced as both films and suspensions in water or alcohols mixture. Therefore, Nafion can be loaded over photocatalytic membranes made of inorganic or polymeric materials. Using the background work [59] we have previously developed membrane photocatalytic system (MPS) consisting of porous filtration Teflon membrane, a filtration loaded layer of photocatalytically active TiO2, chemically bath loaded layer of TiO2 and photochemically deposited Pt [49]. Our hope was that the thin dense layer of photocatalytic TiO2 particles could drive ethanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution over opposite sides of the layer, which should lead to an efficient separation of CO2 and H2. The membrane demonstrated a high activity in hydrogen production from aqueous ethanol, but H2 was easily transferred through the membrane from irradiated compartment filled with aqueous ethanol into non-irradiated compartment filled with gaseous argon. The high permeability of the membrane made it impossible to separate the gaseous products of reaction. In the present work, we try to decrease the permeability of photocatalytic layer to gases by loading it with Nafion with the hope to separate the reduction and oxidation processes over the different sides of the layer. We investigate the influence of Nafion loading on the texture, permeability and photocatalytic properties of MPS. It was found that Nafion loading caused desired reduction of the membrane permeability, but the photocatalytic activity was also decreased. Hydrogen production selectivity changes are discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials For MPS preparation, TiO2 Degussa P25 (DP25, 75% anatase, 25% rutile, primary particles size about 35–50nm) was used. The following chemicals were also used: TiOSO4 from “VEKTON”, H2SO4 from “ANT” and H2PtCl6 from “Aurat”, Nafion perfluorinated ion exchange resin (10wt% dispersion in water) from “Sigma–Aldrich”. PTFE filter MFFK-4 with reinforced polypropylene support was chosen as a substrate for photocatalyst loading. The microfiltration hydrophobic membranes MFFK-4 were produced by NPO “Technofiltr” and have diameter 47mm, total thickness of about 125μm and the stated characteristic retention size of 650nm."
3,MPS preparation,"2.2 MPS preparation Membrane photocatalytic system (MPS) preparation was carried out in five consecutive steps as follows: 1. Impregnation of polymeric membrane with TiO2 by filtering its aqueous suspension. 2. Strengthening of TiO2 layer by loading additional TiO2 with chemical bath deposition (CBD). 3. Aging in H2SO4 aqueous solution to improve photocatalytic activity of the CBD layer. 4. Photocatalytic Pt deposition. 5. Coating with Nafion by impregnation with its dispersion. The first four steps are fully described in our previous report [49] in details. Filtration of 1.7mg of DP25 in suspension was used for the impregnation of TiO2 onto the membrane. Suspension with concentration 2mg/L of DP25 was filtered top–down in a special filtration attachment. The CBD was carried out in 0.1M H2SO4 and 3mM TiOSO4 water solution (100mL) during 2h at 65°C. TiO2 loaded during the filtration step served as seeds for heterogeneous precipitation of TiO2 by the CBD. The CBD allows forming a denser and mechanically stable TiO2 layer on the polymeric substrate. To increase the crystallinity of TiO2 deposited, the membrane was aged in 0.1M H2SO4 solution at 90°C for 8h. To deposit Pt, the aged membranes were fixed to a Plexiglas support and dipped into the aqueous solution (50mL) containing 0.2mM H2PtCl6 and 6vol% of ethanol. The reagent solution was placed in Petri dish and illuminated by a 18W UV lamp Dulux L (Osram) from the distance of 5cm at room temperature. At the last step, two different sets of the membranes with the same permeability and TiO2 quantity were chosen for Nafion loading. 0.1mL Nafion aqueous dispersion containing desired concentration of Nafion and ethanol was applied uniformly on top of the photocatalyst layer. In the first set of MPS prepared, the dispersion contained different amounts of Nafion from 0mg to 8mg. In the second one, the dispersion contained 2mg of Nafion and different concentration of ethanol from 0% to 30%."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The permeability of the prepared MPS was assessed by measuring the permeation rate of a certain volume of water–ethanol solution (50vol% ethanol) under vacuum created by a diaphragm vacuum pump. The solution was poured into the filtration attachment connected through a Bunsen flask to the pump. The morphology of MPS created was studied with scanning electron microscopy. The cross-sectional view of a membrane was obtained by the following procedure. Initially, a membrane was dipped into ethanol, then it was dipped into liquid nitrogen and cut with a blade. A SEM microscope JEOL JSM-6460LV was used for obtaining microphotographs. The loading of photocatalysts in the MPS was measured using balance Ohaus Pioneer PA214C with precision of 0.0001g."
5,Photocatalytic activity measurements,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurements Hydrogen production experiments were carried out in the membrane reactor shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor consists of two main parts with a membrane installed between the parts dividing the internal space into illuminated compartment (IC) and non-illuminated compartment (NC). The IC was filled with 6vol% of aqueous ethanol and the NC was filled with water. The reactor was operated in a flow regime. Before photocatalytic experiments, both compartments were purged with Ar at a flow rate of about 100mL/min for 40min. During the experiments, each compartment was purged with Ar at 10mL/min. Irradiation of the photocatalytic membrane inside the reactor was performed with high pressure Hg lamp DRSh-1000 having maximum emission line in UV region at 365nm. Temperature of the reactor was kept close to ambient by cooling with a fan. Analysis of H2 produced was performed using a gas chromatograph LHM-8 (USSR) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The error of hydrogen concentration measurement was about 5%."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Influence of Nafion loading on membranes properties,"3.1 Influence of Nafion loading on membranes properties Two different sets of membranes were prepared in the present investigation. The first set was prepared via wetting the membranes with Nafion solution containing the same mass of Nafion of 2mg and different concentration of ethanol in the range of 0–30vol%. In the second set of MPS, the amount of Nafion loaded was varied from 0.5 to 8mg. Weight change measurements for the MPS showed that the Nafion loaded was washed away from the membranes during the hydrogen production reaction almost completely. Generally, small amount of Nafion from 0 to 0.7mg is retained in the membranes. The largest amount of Nafion retained was for the membrane prepared using 30 vol% ethanol solution of Nafion. The high retention of Nafion in this case can be explained by deepest wetting of the membrane with the Nafion dispersion. Fig. 2 demonstrates SEM images of several photocatalytic membranes. SEM image of the membrane with 2mg of Nafion prepared without ethanol shows that the TiO2 layer was covered with a Nafion layer before the reaction (Fig. 2A). After the reaction, Nafion layer is washed away from the TiO2 layer (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the weight change measurements. SEM image of the membrane cross-section in Fig. 2C shows that the most of TiO2 is located on top of PTFE layer and forms a layer with a thickness of several micrometers. One can also see the highly porous structure of the PTFE layer. In Fig. 2D, a cross-sectional view of the initial unloaded membrane MFFK-4 is shown. One can see that the filtration PTFE layer of thickness 60μm lies on reinforcing fibers of polypropylene. A low level of MPS permeability is important for constructing a system with efficient separation of gaseous products between the reactor compartments. Figs. 3 and 4 show the permeability data for the first and the second sets of photocatalytic membranes. To avoid washout of Nafion before photocatalytic activity measurements, the permeability was measured after the reaction. For the membranes of the first set, it was found that addition of ethanol (10vol%) initially increases permeability of membranes obtained, but further increase of ethanol concentration to 30vol% leads to the decrease of permeability up to two times compared with the membrane prepared without ethanol Fig. 3. The higher permeability of the Nafion loaded membrane can result from covering the hydrophobic pores of PTFE with hydrophilic Nafion. Fig. 4 shows that permeability of the membranes loaded with different quantity of Nafion decreases by a factor of seven when the Nafion quantity loaded increases from 0.5 to 4mg. The membrane with 8mg of Nafion had higher permeability than the membrane with 4mg because the dispersion with 8mg had high viscosity and so it was difficult to apply uniformly. It should be noted that minor amounts of Nafion left over after the hydrogen production reaction was enough for the permeability changes showed in Figs. 3 and 4."
8,Effect of Nafion loading on photocatalytic hydrogen production,"3.2 Effect of Nafion loading on photocatalytic hydrogen production Fig. 5 shows kinetic curves of hydrogen production rate on the membranes of the first set. The rate is obtained as a sum of the rate in the irradiated and non-irradiated compartments of the reactor. The increase of ethanol concentration in Nafion dispersion led to a decrease of MPS’s activity. But the membrane prepared with 20% ethanol concentration, surprisingly, showed a value of activity close to that of the membrane prepared with 0% ethanol concentration, though the membranes with 10 and 30% ethanol showed lower activity. The activity of the membrane prepared with 20vol% ethanol could be explained by a preparation mistake but the permeability of that membrane follows the trend for the other membranes Fig. 1. Lowering of hydrogen production rate after loading membranes with Nafion may be connected with blocking of TiO2 active surface sites or with pores plugging. The accessibility of the membrane porous structure to Nafion dispersion increases with an increase of ethanol concentration since the surface tension of the dispersion decreases. It seems that the most probable reason for the photocatalytic activity decrease is TiO2 surface sites blocking because permeability is not decreased as strongly as the activity. Analysis of H2 distribution between the reactor compartments gives interesting results. Ratio of H2 evolution rate in IC–NC were 1–1.4, 1.3–1.5, and 2.9–4.9 for the membranes prepared at 0, 10, and 30vol% ethanol content. That is, an increase in the ethanol content led to higher fraction of hydrogen to be released in the illuminated compartment of the membrane reactor. The results are in agreement with the decrease of the membranes permeability with an increase of ethanol concentration in the Nafion dispersion. Total hydrogen production rate obtained for the second set of MPS is shown in Fig. 6 . The kinetic curves were approximated with the following formula (1) W ( H 2 ) = A × ( 1 − exp ⁡ ( − t τ ) ) where A is an approximated steady rate of hydrogen evolution, and τ is the characteristic time of reaching the steady rate. Parameters obtained during the approximation are shown in Table 1 . Hydrogen evolution on the membranes with Nafion loading has a lower rate than on the same membrane without Nafion due to the blocking of active sites of the photocatalyst with Nafion. The rate depends on the weight of Nafion loaded in a complex way. The total steady hydrogen production rate AΣ decreases with an increase of Nafion loading from 0 to 1mg. Further increase in Nafion amount causes the total steady rate to fluctuate between 0.59 and 098mL/min. The fluctuations could be caused by the non-uniformity of Nafion distribution in the membranes due to the increased viscousity of Nafion dispersion. The characteristic time to reach total steady rate τΣ is smallest for the membrane without Nafion. It increases sharply for the membranes with 0.5 and 1mg loadings of Nafion but decreases and remain the same as for the membrane without Nafion for the Nafion loading from 2 to 8mg. Since the Nafion loading decreases permeability of MPS significantly one can expect significant changes in distribution of hydrogen among the irradiated and non-irradiated compartments of the membrane reactor. Kinetic curves of hydrogen production rate in IC and NC are presented in Fig. 7 for MPS loaded with different amount of Nafion. Table 1 lists parameters of hydrogen production rate in these compartments obtained by fitting Eq. (1). For the membrane without Nafion, steady rate of hydrogen evolution is 2.2 times higher in IC than in NC. Unexpectedly, loading the membrane with Nafion in quantities 2, 4, and 8mg resulted in very similar ratios between hydrogen evolution rate in IC and NC equal to 2.4, 2.9, and 1.9, respectively. The largest decrease in membrane permeability for loading 4mg resulted in small change of hydrogen distribution among the reactor compartments. However, when we consider the hydrogen production rates over the membrane loaded with 1mg of Nafion, the IC–NC ratio as large as eight is obtained. These results indicate that hydrogen is predominantly produced in the IC and that there is no clear effect of changing Nafion quantity on hydrogen distribution. Moreover, almost all membranes in the second set showed the close distribution ratios to the membrane without Nafion. Hence, we can conclude that the main factor that influences the distribution is an internal structure of the photocatalytic TiO2 layer on the polymer substrate and probably Nafion is not applied deeply into volume of TiO2 layer. This suggestion is consistent with the statement that Nafion in the first set of MPS can be applied more deeply due to lower surface tension of ethanol solutions. Taking into account the fact that the decrease of permeability in the first set of MPS led to the change of hydrogen distribution, this pattern of applying differences seems truthful. So decreasing of permeability in top of the TiO2 layer did not affect the distribution of H2 because the reaction takes place in the volume of the photocatalytic layer. And for the membranes of the first set, decrease of permeability was caused by locating Nafion into the whole volume of the catalyst layer but not only on the top of the layer."
9,Conclusions,"Loading Nafion onto photocatalytic membrane decreased its permeability up to seven times. The increase in Nafion amount and ethanol solvent concentration decreased permeability. Most of Nafion loaded is washed away during the reaction, and this stability problem needs to be solved in future research. Photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from aqueous ethanol solution decreases after loading photocatalytic membranes with Nafion. Separation of gaseous products, H2 and CO2 did not increase as a result of Nafion loading."
