0,Introduction,"Aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO, EC 1.1.3.7) is a fungal flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of aromatic alcohols and aliphatic polyunsaturated alcohols to corresponding aldehydes and the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) simultaneously (Ferreira et al., 2005; Hernández-Ortega et al., 2011). AAO activity was first found in Polystictus versicolor (Farmer et al., 1960) and has been detected in various white-rot fungi (e.g. Pleurotis eryngii and Bjerkandera adusta), which are the main organisms responsible for biological lignin degradation (Guillén et al., 1994; Muheim et al., 1990b; Varela et al., 2000). As one of the key enzymes involved in lignin degradation, AAO has received intensive attention due to its capability of providing extracellular H2O2 for ligninolytic peroxidases, such as lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase (Alcalde, 2015; Hernández-Ortega et al., 2012). It is promising to utilize AAO, in combination with ligninolytic peroxidases, in lignin depolymerization, which is a central process for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels, chemicals, and materials in a future biorefining industry (Carro et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Ragauskas et al., 2014). Moreover, AAO has also been applied to detoxify 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, decolorize anthraquinone dye, and enhance polyhydroxybutyrate production from alkaline pretreatment liquor (Feldman et al., 2015; Galperin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019). Despite the broad application of AAO, the enzyme is not commercially available partially due to the low yield of AAO production. Therefore, it is critical to develop cost-effective fermentation technologies for large-scale production of AAO with high yield and productivity. Multiple studies have been focused on purification of AAO from white-rot fungi and production of AAO from recombinant organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus nidulans) via heterologous protein expression (Muheim et al., 1990a; Pardo-Planas et al., 2017b; Ruiz-Dueñas et al., 2006; Varela et al., 2001; Viña-Gonzalez et al., 2015). Among different efforts, production of AAO from genetically modified filamentous fungi has received increasing attention because of their high capacity of protein secretion and exceptional post-translational modification system (Nevalainen & Peterson, 2014). However, current research has mainly focused on construction of the recombinant strains and characterization of the enzyme (Couturier et al., 2016; Kumar & Goswami, 2006; Varela et al., 2001). Several studies on AAO production either were carried out in small-scale or generated low yields of enzyme (Liu et al., 2020; Pardo-Planas et al., 2018; Pardo-Planas et al., 2017b). Process optimization and large-scale production of AAO remain rarely studied. The scale-up of fermentation and process optimization are key strategies in biotechnology to increase yields and produce large amounts of products while maintaining a consistent product quality (Schmidt, 2005). In order to increase product yield (or maintain the same yield as observed in small-scale), it is crucial to understand the process control of scaling-up a fermentation system (Hewitt & Nienow, 2007). Several factors, including temperature, pH, aeration, and inoculum have impacts on microbial growth and fermentation (Hellmuth & van den Brink, 2013). In particular, pH control during microbial production of enzymes from filamentous fungi has important effects on mycelial growth, sporulation, and enzyme production (Abubakar et al., 2013; Niaz et al., 2014; Sohail et al., 2009). Additionally, oxygen supply in submerged fermentation is critical for growth of microbes and maintaining production of metabolites (Garcia-Ochoa & Gomez, 2009). For instance, dissolved oxygen (DO) can directly impact oxygen transfer and enzyme/final product productivity during filamentous fungi fermentation (Abdella et al., 2020; Meneghel et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012). It is therefore important to understand and optimize pH and DO control during scale-up of filamentous fungi fermentation. In our previous study, a cost-effective medium for high-yield submerged production of AAO using recombinant Aspergillus nidulans was developed (Liu et al., 2020). The AAO gene was from Myceliophthora thermophila, which contains a variety of biomass-hydrolyzing enzymes and has proven to be a good source of genes encode thermostable enzymes (Visser et al., 2011). The present study aims to optimize the fermentation process and scale-up production of AAO using the same genetically modified strain (A. nidulans) in stirred-tank bioreactor. Process parameters (specifically inoculation methods, temperature, initial pH, and size of inoculum) of AAO production were optimized in shake flasks. In addition, the effects of pH and DO control on AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactor and different AAO concentration and partial purification methods were investigated. This study provides a potential translation of fundamental AAO research to industrial and commercial practice."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Strain and culture media,"2.1 Strain and culture media Genetically modified A. nidulans was used as the production host for heterologous AAO expression. The strain was deposited at the Fungal Genetics Stock Culture (FGSC, Manhattan, Kansas, U.S.) with an identification number of A773. The A. nidulans strain was further genetically manipulated by transformation of pEXPYR plasmid containing AAO gene from Myceliophthora thermophila (also known as Thermothelomyces thermophilus) into the fungal genome, as described elsewhere (Pardo-Planas et al., 2017a; Segato et al., 2012). The resulting recombinant strain was a maltose-induced strain, which secretes and accumulates AAO in the media. AAO production was carried out in a complex medium containing 61.0 g/L maltose, 26.4 g/L CSL (corn steep liquor), and 13.8 g/L NaNO3 as described in our previous study (Liu et al., 2020). All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade."
3,Optimization of process parameters,"2.2 Optimization of process parameters Optimization of process parameters for AAO production was conducted using 50 ml of medium in 250 ml shake flasks agitated at 250 RPM for 72 h in an incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific MaxQ Shaker, USA). The medium was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min (Hirayama HV-50 Autoclave, Japan) before inoculation. Effects of inoculation methods on AAO production: Three different inoculation methods using different seed cultures, including −80 °C stock, spores grown on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plate, and cell pellets, were compared and evaluated. The −80 °C stock was a solution containing spores of A. nidulans in 20% glycerol and 10% lactose preserved at −80 °C. The spores grown on PDA plate was prepared by adding 50 µl of spore solution onto solid PDA medium and spreading homogeneously. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h before spores were harvested and suspended in sterilized 0.9% NaCl solution. The spore suspension was kept at 4 °C before use. Cell pellets were prepared by growing A. nidulans spores in 50 ml potato dextrose broth at 37 °C for 40–44 h. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 RPM (3360 g) for 10 min and washed with sterilized 0.9% NaCl solution. In order to compare the effects of using different seed cultures on the production of AAO, a constant spore concentration (~6 × 108 spores/ml) was used for all experiments in this section. AAO production was carried out at 37 °C with initial medium pH of 6.5 and 1% (v/v) inoculum (0.5 ml spore or cell pellet per 50 ml fermentation medium). Effects of temperature on AAO production: The effects of different temperatures on AAO production were determined by comparing AAO activity at 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, and 40 °C. The initial medium pH was adjusted to 6.5 and 1% cell pellets inoculum was employed. Effects of initial pH on AAO production: The effects of initial medium pH on AAO production were studied by adjusting medium pH to 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 before autoclave using 6 M NaOH solution. AAO production was carried out at 37 °C with 1% cell pellets inoculum. Effects of inoculum (%, v/v) on AAO production: The effects of the size of inoculum on AAO production were conducted by using cell pellets at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% (v/v) of the volume of the fermentation medium. AAO production was carried out at 37 °C with initial medium pH of 6.0."
4,Fermentation in stirred-tank bioreactor,"2.3 Fermentation in stirred-tank bioreactor Scale-up of AAO production was carried out in a commercially available 3 L stirred-tank bioreactor (Eppendorf BioFlo 115, Hauppauge, NY, USA) with a 1.5 L working volume. The bioreactor was a glass vessel equipped with a stainless steel head plate with several opening ports for pH control, sampling, and placing electrodes. The bioreactor containing fermentation media (with initial pH adjusted to pH = 6.0) was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min before each fermentation batch. The AAO production temperature was maintained at 37 °C by the heat blanket and circulating water in the cooling coil. The bioreactor was also equipped with an exhaust condenser incorporated with cooling water to minimize evaporation during fermentation. The pH of culture (at pH = 6.0 ± 0.2) was sensed by a pH electrode (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and maintained by a P & I (proportional & integral) controller to perform acid or base addition. The culture was aerated through an air sparger below liquid level and was agitated by an impeller. Dissolved oxygen was monitored by a polarographic oxygen sensor (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA). Silicone antifoam was used to control foaming as needed. AAO production was started by inoculating A. nidulans cell pellets at 1% (v/v) of the total medium volume. Samples were taken at 12 h intervals for 96 h and were diluted appropriately before AAO activity assay. Samples were stored at −20 °C if not analyzed in a timely manner. AAO activity, protein concentration, and maltose consumption were determined at each time point. Results were compared with AAO production (in 250 ml shake flasks containing 50 ml medium) results from our previous study (Liu et al., 2020)."
5,Effects of pH control on AAO production,"2.4 Effects of pH control on AAO production AAO production medium was initially adjusted to pH 6.0 prior to autoclaving. Fermentations were performed in the stirred-tank bioreactor with 1) pH control (by 5 M H2SO4 and 5 M NaOH) at 6.0 ± 0.2 and 2) without pH control. The pH was continuously monitored over the fermentation period (72 h). AAO activity and protein concentration were compared between controlled pH and natural pH. In addition, the crude AAO was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The operational stability of pH control was also compared between using 1) 5 M H2SO4 + 5 M NaOH and 2) 5 M H2SO4 + 5 M NH4OH."
6,Effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on AAO production,"2.5 Effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on AAO production Aeration control in the stirred-tank bioreactor was regulated by a DO sensor and a P & I (proportional & integral) controller via adjusting the flow of gases and changing the speed of agitation. The DO during AAO fermentation can be controlled manually by adjusting the gas flow rate and agitation speed or controlled automatically by cascade. Effects of different DO levels (i.e. 20, 40, and 60%) were investigated by adjusting DO via cascade control. 20% and 40% DO were controlled by setting the agitation/gas flow cascade with an agitation range from 300 to 1000 RPM and a gas flow range from 0.75 to 4 VVM (volume per volume per minute). This cascade controlled DO by first increasing agitation to the high limit, then increasing gas flow if DO still had not reached the setpoint. 60% DO was controlled by an agitation/gas flow/oxygen cascade, since pure oxygen was needed to obtain 60% DO. The agitation range and gas flow range were the same as that of 20% and 40% DO control. The oxygen range was set from 0 to 100%. The agitation/gas flow/oxygen cascade controlled the DO by first increasing agitation to the high limit, then increasing the gas flow to the high limit if DO was under the setpoint. If DO still had not reached 60%, the cascade started to increase the oxygen percentage in the gas. AAO activity and protein concentration were determined for different DO levels."
7,"Concentration, partial purification, and verification of AAO","2.6 Concentration, partial purification, and verification of AAO Concentration and partial purification of crude AAO solutions were carried out using three different methods, i.e. ammonium sulfate salting out, ultrafiltration with polyethersulfone (PES) membrane, and ultrafiltration with regenerated cellulose (RC) membrane. Ultrafiltration was conducted in an Amicon® stirred cell unit (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) equipped with 10 kDa Biomax® PES membrane or Ultracel® RC membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). The stirred cell unit was filled with 50 ml crude AAO solution and pressurized with air at 207 kPa (30 psig), while stirring on a magnetic stir plate at a speed of 400 RPM. After filtration, the concentrated and partially purified enzyme were collected for further determination of AAO activity and protein concentration. Ammonium sulfate salting out was carried out by precipitating protein with ammonium sulfate. The crude AAO solution was precipitated by 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate at 4 °C overnight. Then, the precipitated protein was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was resuspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The excessive salts were washed out through Amicon® centrifugal filter units (3 K) (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). AAO activity and protein concentration were determined after partial purification. Calculations of specific activity, purification fold, and recovery: Specific a c t i v i t y U / m g = Total A A O a c t i v i t y U Total p r o t e i n c o n t e n t m g Purification f o l d = Specific a c t i v i t y o f p u r i f i e d f r a c t i o n ( U / m g ) Specific a c t i v i t y o f c r u d e A A O ( U / m g ) Recovery % = Total a c t i v i t y o f p u r i f i e d f r a c t i o n ( U ) Total a c t i v i t y o f c r u d e A A O ( U ) Protein analysis by SDS-PAGE was conducted by dissolving protein in NuPAGE™ LDS (lithium dodecyl sulfate) sample buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) as reducing reagent. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After that, the samples were loaded onto a BoltTM 12% Bis-Tris Plus gel and run at 200 V. The gel was stained using colloidal Coomassie Blue. AAO protein identification and verification were conducted by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The gel band was excised and washed with ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile to remove stain and SDS. The proteins were digested overnight with trypsin at 37 °C. The digests were then run by nanoLC-MS/MS using a 1 h gradient on a 0.075 mm × 250 mm C18 column feeding into a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer. All MS/MS samples were analyzed by using Mascot 2.6.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK). Scaffold 4.8.4 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if greater than 80% probability could be established."
8,"Determination of AAO activity, protein concentration, and maltose concentration","2.7 Determination of AAO activity, protein concentration, and maltose concentration Spectrophotometric assay method, which is based on the oxidation of veratryl alcohol (substrate) and reduction of 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP, final electron acceptor), was used to determine AAO activity (Benson et al., 1980; Pardo-Planas et al., 2017a). The absorbance of the reaction was monitored at 600 nm (ɛ600 = 21,000 M−1·cm−1) at 50 °C for 2 min with 1 cm pathlength using an UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 201 UV–visible Spectrophotometer equipped with Peltier Control and Cooling Unit, USA). Each reaction contained 0.1 ml 2 mM DCPIP, 0.1 ml 250 mM veratryl alcohol, 0.1 ml 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 0.7 ml crude enzyme sample. The enzyme sample solution and reagents were equilibrated at 50 °C before reaction. One unit of AAO activity was defined as the reduction of one µmol of DCPIP per min. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) using bovine serum as protein standard. In brief, 30 µl of AAO sample were mixed well with 1.5 ml of the Coomassie reagent (Thermo Scientific, USA). Absorbance was measured under 595 nm after incubating the mixture at room temperature for 10 min. Maltose concentration was measured by HPLC (Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101, Japan). The mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and a column temperature of 65 °C. Experiments were conducted and analyzed in duplicate unless otherwise indicated in the results. Data was collected and presented as means with standard deviations (shown as error bars in the figures, indicating the variability of data). Statistical analysis was performed using JMP® Pro 13 statistical software with a significance level of p less than 0.05 for all experimental data."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Optimization of process parameters on AAO production,"3.1 Optimization of process parameters on AAO production Process parameters, specifically inoculation methods, temperature, initial pH, and inoculum size, of AAO production were optimized in shake flasks (50 ml working volume) before scaling-up. Differences in AAO activity were expected when different process parameters were applied, so that the optimal operation parameters (or ranges) can be selected and applied in scale-up of AAO production. Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of different process parameters, which include inoculation methods, temperature, initial pH, and size of inoculum on AAO production. As shown in Fig. 1A, AAO activity was affected by using different seed cultures for the inoculation. The AAO activity of using cell pellets as the seed culture was significantly greater than that of using spores in the −80 °C stock solution and spores grown on PDA plates. No significant difference was observed between using −80 °C stock solution and spores grown on PDA plates. The results demonstrated that inoculation with pre-cultured cell pellets produced more AAO activity than inoculation with spores. Inoculation with cell pellets reduced the energy required for cell growth and mycelia formation. Also, the higher mass transfer rate inside the cell pellets facilitated the transfer of nutrients into cells and enzymes out of cells (Abdella et al., 2019; Talabardon & Yang, 2005). The culture temperature has been proven to have effects on filamentous fungi fermentation and heterologous gene expression (e.g. gene translation and protein aggregation) (Eibes et al., 2009; Vasina & Baneyx, 1997). Thus, it is critical to optimize the temperature for production of AAO by recombinant A. nidulans. Fig. 1B shows the effects of different temperatures (30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, and 40 °C) on the activity of AAO. AAO activity increased as temperature increased when temperature was less than or equal to 37 °C. Then AAO activity decreased as temperature increased to 38 °C and 40 °C. The maximum AAO activity was observed at 36 °C and 37 °C as no significant difference in AAO activity was observed between 36 °C and 37 °C. The AAO activity between 34 °C and 36 °C was not significantly different, however, activity as 34 °C was less than activity at 37 °C was observed. Thus, AAO production at 37 °C was used in subsequent experiments. Fig. 1C illustrates the effects of initial medium pH on AAO activity. The maximum AAO activity, which was 1010 U/L (average activity of three replicates), was detected at an initial pH of 6.0. However, no significant difference in AAO activity was observed among initial pH of 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5, which indicated that the optimal initial pH for AAO production was in the range of 5.5 to 6.5. The AAO activity between initial pH of 6.5 and 7.0 was not significantly different, however, a significant difference was observed between initial pH of 6.0 and 7.0. Then the optimal initial pH should be between 5.5 and 6.0. In addition, a pH decrease (by 0.2–0.3) after autoclaving was expected in this study, so an initial pH of 6.0 for AAO production medium was selected for subsequent experiments. The actual pH of the medium (5.7–5.8) was also checked after autoclaving and before fermentation. Fig. 1D shows the effects of different sizes of inoculum (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% of the fermentation medium) on AAO activity. No significant difference in AAO activity was observed among 1%, 2%, and 4% inoculum. As the inoculum increased to 10%, the AAO activity was significantly lower than that of 1–4%. The results demonstrated that 1% inoculum of cell pellets was adequate for AAO production. The decreased AAO activity at elevated inoculum size (6–10%) could be due to the presence of large amounts of mycelia which consumed a large quantity of substrate for growth (Niaz et al., 2014). The maximum AAO activity of 1066 U/L was achieved at 37 °C with initial medium pH of 6.0 and 1% inoculum of cell pellets during optimization of process parameters. The optimized process parameters (i.e. inoculation with cell pellet, production temperature at 37 °C, initial pH at 6.0, and 1% inoculum size) were crucial for scale-up production of AAO."
11,Scale-up production of AAO in stirred-tank bioreactor,"3.2 Scale-up production of AAO in stirred-tank bioreactor Scale-up production of AAO was initiated to maximize enzyme production once process parameters were optimized on small-scale. The scale-up of AAO production was carried out in a 3 L stirred-tank bioreactor with 1.5 L working volume. AAO activity, protein concentration, and maltose consumption were determined and compared with that observed for AAO production on shake flask scale (50 ml) from a previous study (Liu et al., 2020). Fig. 2 shows the comparison of AAO activity, protein concentration, and maltose concentration between AAO production on bioreactor scale and shake flask scale over 96 h. According to the results, AAO activity was detected at 24 h in both bioreactor and shake flask scales, indicating AAO started to accumulate between 12 and 24 h. After that, AAO activity increased as fermentation time increased, and reached the maxima at 72 h in both the bioreactor and shake flask. The greatest AAO activities in the bioreactor and shake flask were 1520 U/L and 1021 U/L, respectively. And the AAO activity in bioreactor was significantly greater than that in shake flask. While no significant changes of AAO activity were observed in shake flasks after 72 h, the AAO activity in bioreactor started to decrease after 72 h. AAO activity decreased to 1101 U/L in the bioreactor at 96 h. The results indicated that fermentation should be stopped and enzyme should be harvested at 72 h. Protein concentration in both the bioreactor and shake flask started to increase at 24 h and 36 h, respectively. In shake flasks, the protein concentration was at ~ 0.3 g/L for 36 h due to the balance of AAO production and consumption of nitrogen in corn steep liquor. Then the protein concentration reached the maximum, which was around 0.8 g/L. In the bioreactor, the balance was only kept for 24 h, as protein concentration increased after 24 h. This could be due to the large amounts of mycelia present in the bioreactor, which caused a faster consumption of nutrients than in the shake flask. This was also reflected in the changes of maltose concentration during AAO production. The maltose concentration decreased to less than 5 g/L in 36 h in the bioreactor. However, the maltose concentration reached similar amounts (less than 5 g/L) at 48 h in shake flask. The maximum protein concentration in the bioreactor was 1.08 g/L at 72 h. Similar to the AAO activity, the protein concentration started to decrease after 72 h. The decrease of AAO activity and protein concentration at the end of fermentation (after 72 h) can be explained by proteolytic degradation of AAO by extracellular proteases from A. nidulans. The degradation of target proteins during heterologous protein expression is a common problem in filamentous fungi hosts (Gouka et al., 1997; Yoon et al., 2011), and there are around 80 genes that encode extracellular proteases in A. nidulans (Budak et al., 2014). Further research needs to be conducted to identify proteases that affect AAO production to possibly eliminate AAO proteolytic degradation. The greatest AAO activity observed during scale-up was 1520 U/L (average activity of two replicates) with a protein concentration of 1.08 g/L, which was significantly greater that in shake flask (1021 U/L with 0.75 g/L protein). Furthermore, the yield and productivity (in 72 h) of AAO in the bioreactor were 24.9 U/g maltose and 21.1 U/L/h, respectively, which were also greater than that observed in shake flasks (16.8 U/g maltose and 14.2 U/L/h). The results demonstrated that AAO production was significantly improved in a stirred-tank bioreactor when compared to shake flasks and was technically viable to be achieved at a large scale."
12,Effects of pH control on AAO production on bioreactor scale,"3.3 Effects of pH control on AAO production on bioreactor scale It has been demonstrated that the expression of a number of extracellular enzymes in A. nidulans were controlled by medium pH (Caddick et al., 1986; Luque et al., 2004). Results from optimization of process parameters also indicated that initial medium pH impacted final AAO activity. Moreover, medium pH during AAO production increased over time (as shown in Fig. 4) if pH control was not performed. Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of pH control on AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactor. Fig. 3 A illustrates the comparison of AAO activity and protein concentration during AAO production in bioreactors with pH control and without pH control (natural pH). According to the experimental data, the changes of AAO activity over time for natural pH and controlled pH were almost identical, which means no significant difference in AAO activity was observed. The greatest AAO activities (60 h) for natural pH and controlled pH were 1527 U/L and 1523 U/L, respectively. However, the protein concentrations (at 60 h) for natural pH and controlled pH were 1.33 g/L and 1.06 g/L, respectively. The protein concentration of natural pH was significantly greater than that of controlled pH, and the difference in protein concentration (1.66 g/L and 1.22 g/L for natural pH and controlled pH, respectively) was even greater at 72 h. The proteins from natural pH and controlled pH fermentations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to investigate the reasons why protein concentrations were different while the AAO activity were similar between natural and controlled pH. According to the SDS-PAGE results depicted in Fig. 3B, AAO bands, which had a molecular mass of ~87 kDa, were clearly fractionated on the gel. In addition, the controlled pH lane was visually cleaner than the natural pH lane on the gel. Proteins or peptides at ~65 kDa were clearly noticeable in the natural pH lane, but no such proteins or peptides were observed in the controlled pH lane. These results demonstrated that fewer non-target proteins were produced from A. nidulans by controlling pH. Consequently, pH at 6.0 was controlled during AAO production in the stirred-tank bioreactor. In addition to the investigation of effects of pH control on AAO production, the operational stability of pH control by different chemicals (i.e. 5 M H2SO4 + 5 M NaOH and 5 M H2SO4 + 5 M NH4OH) was studied. The natural pH changes during AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactors were illustrated in Fig. 4 . The initial pH was slightly lower than 6.0. Then pH started to increase at around 36 h, when AAO started to accumulate. The pH increased to ~7.5 at around 48 h and remained at ~7.5 till the end of fermentation. The pH during AAO production was set at 6.0 ± 0.2 and regulated by the controller to perform acid or base addition automatically. Initially, 5 M H2SO4 + 5 M NH4OH were used to adjust pH, as ammonium can also be used as a nitrogen source. The pH was successfully maintained at ~6.0 in the first 36 h. Then frequent changes of pH were observed from 36 h to 72 h. The pH fluctuation caused the addition of excessive H2SO4 and NH4OH and foaming problems, which made the fermentation difficult to control. Alternatively, 5 M H2SO4 and 5 M NaOH were used to control the pH (as shown in Fig. 4). According to the pH record, the pH during AAO production was well maintained at around 6.0 without too much fluctuation. Therefore, H2SO4 and NaOH were selected as pH control agents during AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactor."
13,Effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on AAO production on bioreactor scale,"3.4 Effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on AAO production on bioreactor scale A. nidulans is a filamentous fungus that requires significant aeration (Abdella et al., 2020; Panagiotou et al., 2009), thus DO plays an important role in AAO production. Fig. 5 demonstrates the changes of DO and agitation (changed manually) during AAO production in a stirred-tank bioreactor. The air flow was set at 3 VVM, which was a relatively high gas flow rate when compared to another study with A. nidulans (Abdella et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 5, the DO decreased to close to 0% in 20 h with an agitation speed of 300 RPM. After that, it was attempted to maintain DO at 40% by manually increasing the agitation speed. DO increased to around 40% when the agitation speed reached 500 RPM; however, DO decreased to less than 10% from 20 h to 30 h during AAO production. DO was maintained at ~ 40% from 30 h to 48 h when agitation speed was increased to 800 RPM. After 48 h, it was difficult to maintain a 25% DO, even though agitation speed was increased to 1000 RPM at an air flow rate of 3 VVM. A potential limitation of this study is that it is not possible to collect the fungal biomass data (which would be helpful to better understand the fungal growth and production process) due to the insoluble solids in CSL affect the determination of biomass. The results indicated that the genetically modified A. nidulans strain for AAO production required a considerable amount of oxygen for enzyme production and the overall AAO production is an oxygen-limiting process. As a result, it is critical to investigate the effects of DO on AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactor. Fig. 6 shows the effects of different levels of DO on AAO activity and protein concentration during AAO production in stirred-tank bioreactor. Different levels of DO were controlled by the cascade function in bioreactor with an air flow range from 0.75 to 4 VVM and agitation range from 300 to 1000 RPM. The AAO activity and protein concentration reached the maxima, which were 1491 U/L and 1.10 g/L, at 72 h when DO was controlled at 20%. As DO increased to 40%, the greatest AAO activity (1676 U/L) and protein concentration (1.07 g/L) were detected at 60 h. When DO was controlled at 60%, the AAO activity and protein concentration dramatically increased in 48 h, and started to decrease after 48 h due to proteolytic degradation (as discussed in Section 3.2). The greatest AAO activity and protein concentration at 60% DO were 1906 U/L and 1.19 g/L, respectively. The yield and productivity (in 48 h) were 31.2 U/g maltose and 39.7 U/L/h, respectively. According to the results, AAO activity (average activity of duplicates) at 60% was significantly greater than that at 40% and 20% DO. Moreover, the activity at 40% DO was significantly greater than that at 20% DO. The results demonstrated as DO% was increased, AAO activity also increased. Under current cascade settings with a maximum air flow rate of 4 VVM in the stirred-tank bioreactor, it was possible to maintain a 40% DO during AAO production. However, 60% DO could not be achieved without increasing the percentage of oxygen in the gas flow, which means pure oxygen was required to maintain a 60% DO. Although AAO activity of 60% DO was 230 U/L higher than that of 40% DO and fermentation time was shorter, the cost of pure oxygen was not negligible. As a result, AAO activity of 1906 U/L (60% DO, with supply of oxygen) or 1676 U/L (40% DO without oxygen) can be accomplished. Although AAO activity of 60% DO was greater than that of 40% DO, introducing pure oxygen for AAO production could be a costly affair. Therefore, recommendations of DO control during AAO production for industrial practice cannot be made without further techno-economic analysis."
14,"Concentration, partial purification, and verification of AAO","3.5 Concentration, partial purification, and verification of AAO After scale-up production of AAO, the crude enzyme was concentrated and partially purified through different methods. Table 1 summarized three different methods, including (NH4)2SO4 salting out (protein precipitation), ultrafiltration with PES (polyethersulfone) membrane, and ultrafiltration with RC (regenerated cellulose) membrane, to concentrate and partially purify crude AAO. According to the purification table, crude AAO was concentrated to an activity of >6000 U/L by ultrafiltration (both 10 kDa PES and RC membranes). Although close to 5000 U/L of AAO activity was obtained by concentration and partial purification using (NH4)2SO4 salting out, the low recovery rate and long processing time (overnight) limited its application in AAO concentration and purification. In contrast, both ultrafiltration methods had a recovery rate of greater than 96% and can be completed in 45 min for 50 ml crude AAO. Ultrafiltration equipped with PES membrane was selected for AAO concentration and partial purification, due to the slightly higher recovery rate and purification fold. The purification folds using different concentration and partial purification methods were all close to 1, indicating that the purity of AAO produced from A. nidulans was high. This was also demonstrated on the gel of SDS-PAGE. In a similar study, AAO from Pleurotus eryngii was expressed in A. nidulans, and Sephacryl S-200 resin and Mono-Q ion exchange column were required to remove non-target proteins and minor impurities (Varela et al., 2001). In addition, AAO expressed in E. coli was concentrated and purified by a chromatographic method, which included concentration, dialysis, and a 20 h centrifugation to remove impurities and unfolded proteins (Ruiz-Dueñas et al., 2006). The overall process was time-consuming and the yield was around 70%, which was lower than 96% in current study. The crude AAO concentration and partial purification results revealed that the purity of AAO from A. nidulans was high and no advanced purification method was required to purify the crude enzyme. Furthermore, AAO was identified and verified by LC-MS/MS after partial purification. The MS/MS profile was searched against M. thermophila (the gene source of AAO), which contains a variety of biomass-hydrolyzing-enzyme-encoding genes (Visser et al., 2011). Results demonstrated that the protein was a GMC (Glucose-Methanol-Choline) oxidoreductase-like protein with a 42% sequence coverage (Table 1). As AAO belongs to the GMC oxidoreductase superfamily (Hernández-Ortega et al., 2012), the AAO produced from genetically modified A. nidulans was verified. AAO production has been carried out in extensive studies, but few studies focused on scale-up production of AAO in submerged culture. Pardo-Planas et al. (2018) conducted continuous AAO production from A. nidulans using a trickle bed reactor with a total volume of 1.1 L, and the greatest AAO activity achieved was 65.1 U/L, which was almost 30 times lower than the activity in present study. In addition, the maximum yield (1.43 U/g maltose) and productivity (2.2 U/L/h) was substantially lower than that in the current study (31.2 U/g maltose and 39.7 U/L/h, respectively). Furthermore, to fairly compare the AAO production in the continuous reactor and the present batch reactor, total AAO activities produced per day (24 h) were calculated. Pardo-Planas et al. (2018) produced a maximum activity of 58.1 U/day in the continuous reactor, which was 24.6 times lower than that in the present stirred-tank reactor (1429.2 U/day at maximum activity observed). Varela et al. (2001) expressed AAO from Pleurotus eryngii in A. nidulans using glucose as substrate and produced a maximum activity of 400–500 U/L, which was significantly lower than 1906 U/L in this study. The enzyme activity in this study was also significantly greater than the AAO produced in hosts other than A. nidulans (Galperin et al., 2016; Viña-Gonzalez et al., 2018). For instance, Galperin et al. (2016) carried out AAO production from recombinant Coprinopsis cinerea in a 7.5 L stirred-tank bioreactor (with 5 L working volume) and reached an AAO activity of up to 125 U/L, which was over 15 times lower than the AAO activity achieved in this study. In addition, the yield and productivity of AAO were significantly improved when compared to that in small-scale (50 ml) AAO production (with a yield and productivity of 16.8 U/g maltose and 14.2 U/L/h, respectively) in our previous study (Liu et al., 2020). To our knowledge, AAO activity of 1906 U/L with 1.19 g/L protein is the greatest AAO activity that has been published. This study provides a basis for future study of submerged production of AAO using filamentous fungi at large scale."
15,Conclusion,"The present study investigated the optimization of process parameters and scale-up production of AAO from recombinant A. nidulans in submerged culture in stirred-tank bioreactor. Particularly, effects of pH and DO on AAO production were investigated and evaluated. Results demonstrated that the AAO production was technically viable to be performed at large scale and yield and productivity were significantly improved in stirred-tank bioreactor. Also, pH control reduced non-target proteins production and higher levels of DO were beneficial to AAO production. The greatest AAO activity of 1906 U/L with 1.19 g/L protein was achieved at pH 6.0 and 60% dissolved oxygen."
