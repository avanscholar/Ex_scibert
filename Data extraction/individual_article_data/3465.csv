0,Introduction,"A future without reliance on fossil fuels for energy is widely touted. Global attention is towards reducing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, caused by combustion of fossil fuels and simultaneously discovering a sustainable future fuel. In this scenario, hydrogen is considered to be an ideal energy alternative for the future. Compared with conventional H2 generation process (chemical and electrochemical), biological H2 production using fermentative, photosynthetic bacteria, or algae is an environmentally benign and less energy intensive process (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Levin et al., 2004). Microbial H2 production is an attractive process for supplying a significant share of the H2 required for the near future. Furthermore, renewable biomass can be used as substrates for biological H2 production facilitating both bioremediation and energy recovery. The feasibility of fermentative H2 production from organic wastes or wastewaters has been widely demonstrated by various laboratories (Cai and Liu, 2005; Kim et al., 2004; Lay et al., 1999; Lin and Lay, 2005; Shu-Yii et al., 2006). Galore microbial species, belonging to the genera Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium are reported to produce hydrogen (Nandi and Sengupta, 1998). Apart from pure cultures, various mixed micro-flora and co-cultures have also been explored for hydrogen production from carbohydrates (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Haruhiko et al., 1998; Nandi and Sengupta, 1998). Nevertheless, the quest for ideal microbe(s) for microbial H2 production has thrust the researchers to screen various sources. Sewage sludge has been reported to be the most proven and potent source of H2 producers. B. coagulans, a gram positive, motile, acid-tolerant and heat-resistant facultative anaerobic bacterium is notoriously known to spoil acidic foods. Bacillus coagulans and its close relatives are ideal biocatalysts for fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals. Further these bacteria are metabolically versatile, grow in minimum mineral salts, utilize a wide range of carbon compounds as carbon and energy source. However very brief study has been reported on Bacillus sp. for H2 fermentation. The fermentative H2-producing process is greatly influenced by many factors, such as pH, temperature, oxidation–reduction potential and nutritional requirements (Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Levin et al., 2004; Lin and Lay, 2005). Kim et al. (2004) found that methanogenesis could be prevented by heat treatment of seed sludge and that the maximum H2 production occurred over a pH range of 5.5–6.5. Nutritional requirements on H2 production have also been demonstrated by Lin and Lay (2005). Temperature is one of the important factors influencing the biological H2 fermentation process. Substrate degradation, H2 production, product distribution and bacterial growth are all affected by temperature. Reported studies on fermentative H2 production were operated in a mesophilic range, i.e., 30–37°C (Cai and Liu, 2005; Haruhiko et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2004; Kumar and Das, 2001; Lin and Lay, 2004a, 2005; Palazzi et al., 2000; Shu-Yii et al., 2006), whereas some experiments were conducted in a thermophilic range, i.e., 50–60°C (Yeonghee et al., 2005). H2 production and substrate degradation rate can be increased through elevating operating temperature. However, operation at high temperatures is not favorable for energy recovery. Therefore, for a balance between H2 production and energy recovery, it seems to be reasonable to operate biological H2-producing reactors in the mesophilic range (Fabiano and Perego, 2002; Kumar and Das, 2000; Oh, S.E. et al., 2003). This study aimed to investigate operational parameters for maximization of H2 production process using B. coagulans IIT-BT S1 in terms of substrate degradation, H2 production rate, H2 content (%) and cell growth."
1,Methods,
2,Isolation of the bacterial strain and growth conditions,"2.1 Isolation of the bacterial strain and growth conditions From the anaerobically digested sewage sludge, hydrogen-producing microbial strains were isolated by enrichment on MYG medium under anaerobic conditions at 37°C overnight. Pure cultures were obtained from these by serial dilution using 0.85% w/v saline solution and plating on nutrient agar plates incubated overnight in anaerobic jar maintained at 37°C. These were grown in nutrient broth (pH 6.0) at 37°C at 250rpm for 12h."
3,"16S rDNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and microbial characterization of the strains","2.2 16S rDNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and microbial characterization of the strains Genomic DNA of the organism the selected cultures was isolated using the method of Marmur (1961). The primers designed from 16S rDNA conserved gene sequences of γ-proteobacteria were employed to amplify the ∼1.5kb long fragment (Muyzer et al., 1993). The sequencing was done at Sequencing facility, MWG Biotech, Germany. Clone Manager suite 5.0, SE Central software was used in the sequence analysis, alignment and to obtain the phylogenetic tree."
4,Hydrogen production in batch fermentors,"2.3 Hydrogen production in batch fermentors Experiments were carried out in jacketed glass reactor (of working volume 500ml; MYG medium) placed on a magnetic stirring platform using the free suspended cells of the isolates. All the media and glassware were autoclaved for 15min at 121°C and 1.05kg/cm2 steam pressure. Anaerobicity was maintained by flushing with argon for fixed time after the inoculation. Samples from the reactor were withdrawn for estimation of glucose utilisation or COD reduction. The gas mixture was allowed to pass through 40% KOH solution for selective absorption of carbon dioxide. The filtered gas was collected in a graduated water displacement system containing saline solution at ambient pressure and temperature. Effect of temperature: Reactor temperature (28–40°C) was maintained using a circulated water bath connected to the jacket of the reactor. Initial pH of the medium was 6.0, glucose 1%, inoculum volume and age to 10% (v/v) and 12h respectively. Effect of initial pH: Initial pH of the media was adjusted accordingly (in the range 5.5–9.0) prior to sterilization using freshly prepared acid and alkali stock solutions. Fermentation temperature was maintained at 37°C while the rest of the parameters were unchanged as above. Effect of initial glucose concentration: Glucose concentrations in the medium was varied from 0.5% to 2.5% w/v. Temperature was maintained at 37°C, initial pH was set to 6.5, inoculum volume and age of 10% v/v and 12h were respectively used. Effect of inoculum volume and age: Temperature was maintained at 37°C, initial pH was set to 6.5, glucose concentration to 1.5% w/v. The inoculum volume and age were varied in the range of 2–20% v/v and 10–18h respectively. Effect of substrate: Different carbon sources were used keeping all the parameters constant (viz. temperature=37°C, pH=6.5, initial substrate concentration=1.5% w/v, inoculum volume and age 10% and 14h respectively). 2.3.1 Analytical methods (i) Hydrogen: The composition of the gas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Perkin–Elmer) with TCD using Porapak-Q column using N2 as carrier gas at 5.62kg/cm2 pressure and 20ml/min flow rate. Injector, oven and detector temperatures were set at 150°C, 80°C and 200°C respectively. The chromatogram was developed and analyzed using software, Turbochrome Navigator (version 4.1) Perkin–Elmer Coorp. (ii) Physico-chemical characteristics: Physical parameters viz, T.S, T.S.S., T.V.S., T.D.S., B.O.D etc. were characterized using protocols mentioned in Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). C.O.D estimation was performed using K2Cr2O7 open-reflux method (Pitwell, 1983) and T.O.C using rapid titrimeric method (APHA, 1995). (iii) Glucose concentration: Reducing sugar content of the medium was estimated spectrophotometrically (UV–VIS Spectrophotometer Perkin–Elmer, λ =630nm) using anthrone reagent (Loewus, 1952). (iv) VFA and alcohols: Qualitative detection of VFA and alcohols in the distillate of spent media was carried out with GC using FID detector, in capillary column under the conditions injector, oven and detector temperatures, 250, 170 and 280°C respectively."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolates,"3.1 Characterization of the hydrogen-producing isolates Sewage sludge has been used for isolating microbial strains having potential of H2 production (Chen et al., 2001, 2005; Lin and Lay, 2004a,b; Mulin et al., 2004). In the present investigation, 14 hydrogen-producing isolates evaluated for hydrogen production and two isolates, viz. Isolate I and Isolate II were selected for further studies based on higher hydrogen producing abilities (data not shown). The ∼1.5kb 16S rRNA gene amplicons were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of the organisms using the primers designed (Fig. 1 ). The alignment of 16S rRNA fragments with the established sequences from NCBI database was used to deduce the phylogenetic tree. The isolates showed phylogenetic relatedness with other bacteria in γ-proteobacteria. The members of this group particularly belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae have been reported in several earlier works for their potential hydrogen yields. Isolate II showed >97% homology with E. coli on alignment of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons; Isolate I showed ∼88% homology with Bacillus sp. Further identification of the strain by MTCC, Chandigarh, India characterized it as B. coagulans and was designated as strain IIT-BT S1. B. licheniformis is the only other reported strain belonging Bacilliaceae employed for H2 production (Kalia et al., 1994)."
7,Effect of temperature,"3.2 Effect of temperature B. coagulans is known to be a heat-resistant bacterium. Cell mass was recorded to be about two folds higher at 40°C than at 28°C (Fig. 2 ). It was also observed that hydrogen production rate and H2 content (%) increased with operating temperature until 37°C but dropped significantly at 40°C. Drop in H2 production rate at 40°C could be attributed to the protein deactivation (Fabiano and Perego, 2002). Activation energy of the reaction was deduced to be 19.146kcal, relatively smaller to many of those reported H2-producing strains (Boyles, 1984; Das and Veziroglu, 2001; Kumar and Das, 2000; Oh, S.E. et al., 2003)."
8,Effect of pH,"3.3 Effect of pH Initial pH of the medium influenced the cell mass, rate of H2 production and H2 content (%) significantly. Cell growth rate and yield of H2 decreased with decrease in initial pH of the medium (Fig. 3 ). At lower pH there could be increased formation of acidic metabolites, which destabilize the cell’s ability to maintain internal pH, resulting in lowering of intracellular level of ATP and inhibiting glucose uptake (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985). At pH 5.5 and 6.0, growth was better than that at higher pH values, showing the acid tolerance nature of B. coagulans. But H2 production rate was considerably lower at pH 5.5 and 6.0, which was most likely due to rapid conversion of the carbon source into biomass, reducing the formation of hydrogen. Higher pH (8.0–9.0) severely hindered the growth of bacterium and also the H2 production. pH 6.5 recorded maximum H2 production rate and H2 content, which was in consensus with reported values (Oh, S.E. et al., 2003)."
9,Effect of substrate concentration,"3.4 Effect of substrate concentration Though initial glucose concentration of 1.5% showed highest growth, H2 production rate was maximum at 2.0% (Fig. 4 ). The rate increased with increase in initial glucose concentration from 0.5–2.0% but dropped at 2.5% indicating substrate inhibition. Several authors have reported similar profile between initial substrate concentration and H2 production rate (Bowles and Ellefson, 1985; Fang and Liu, 2002; Oh, Y.K. et al., 2003; Wu and Lin, 2004)."
10,Effect of inoculum volume and age,"3.5 Effect of inoculum volume and age Up to 10% inoculum volume, there was increase in H2 production rate with the increase in inoculum volume (Fig. 5 ) but thereafter the rate reduced at 15% and 20%. However, cell mass increased exponentially with increase in inoculum volume. Apparently, at higher inoculum volume more carbon source was devoted for biomass than hydrogen production. Effect of inoculum age on rate of H2 production was not very significant. All the same, 14h inoculum age to some extent recorded higher rate of H2 production and H2 content; 14h was mid-log phase of the growth of the bacterium (data not shown), H2 production was recorded to initiate in mid-log phase and reached maximum production rate in the stationary phase. For this reason, using 14h old inoculum might have minimized the lag phase in the H2 production."
11,Effect of different substrates,"3.6 Effect of different substrates Ten different carbon sources were examined for H2 production ability using B. coagulans IIT-BT S1 (Fig. 6 ). Sucrose was most productive with respect to the yield of H2, and was mannose least suitable. But ability of the bacterium to utilize wide range of substrates for producing H2 was striking and accentuated its capability to produce H2 using renewable biomass (Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2005a,b). Maximal H2 yield from different reported strains was compared with that of B. coagulans IIT-BT S1. Also, the acidogenesis, gas composition and production of other metabolites at optimal conditions for maximal H2 yield have been quantitatively compared with that of other reported strains. The values (Tables 1 and 2 ) are comparable with the strain, Enterobacter cloacae IIT-BT 08 reported with highest yield (Kumar and Das, 2000)."
12,Conclusions,B. coagulans IIT-BT S1 appeared a suitable candidate for the fermentative hydrogen production due to its capacity to use from different carbon sources. The results could be of great significance for pilot studies for H2 production.
