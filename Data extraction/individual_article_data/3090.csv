0,Introduction,"It is well known that the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions over TiO2 can be improved by noble metal doping (see Fig. 1 below for instance). The enhancement in activity is often related to the metal's ability to accept photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2, thus prolonging the lifetime of the electron/hole pair. As a result, the role of the noble metal in the mechanism of such reactions has generally been considered to be only that of an electron sink. This view has been supported by spectroscopic investigations which show surfaces dominated by intermediates formed from the abstraction of an α-hydrogen from the alcohol [1,2]. FTIR studies of the photo-reforming of i-propanol to H2 and CO2 on Pt/TiO2 for example, suggested that the i-propanol decomposition involved acetone-like intermediates that further decomposed via photo-Kolbe reactions [3]. However, recent work has suggested [4] that the role of the noble metal is much more significant in the overall process. The aim of the present paper is to explore this concept by examining the changes in reaction products when a selection of alcohols are thermally decomposed on nano-particulate TiO2 surfaces in the presence and absence of palladium; the changes in product distribution that are observed mirrors that seen during photocatalysis and thus gives an insight into the key reaction steps in the latter. Interest in the catalytic reforming of alcohols has led to extensive surface studies of alcohol decomposition on both TiO2 and Pd model catalysts [5]. Through this work, reactive sites have been identified and an understanding developed of the mechanistic pathways [6–9]. Alcohol adsorption on both the TiO2 and Pd surfaces leads to dissociation and the formation of an alkoxide (Eqs. (1) and (2)). (1) ROHg →ROHa (2) ROHa →ROa +Ha Following alkoxide formation the reaction pathways diverge: on Pd, reaction is dominated by decarbonylation with α CC scission leading to the formation of CO and the corresponding alkane (Eqs. (3) and (3a)) [9–11]. On the other hand, studies of alcohol decomposition on TiO2 report negligible product formation from CC scission. Instead, dehydration to an alkene (Eqs. (4) and (4a)), or dehydrogenation to a carbonyl (Eqs. (5) and (5a)) occurs. It has been proposed that the different pathways are determined by the availability of acidic and/or basic sites. i-propanol for example gives rise to propylene where acid sites are available but generates acetone when both basic and acidic sites are available. On Pd (3) RCH2CH2Oa →RCH3a +COg +½H2g (3a) R(R′CH2)CHOa →RCH2Ra′+COg +Ha On TiO2 (4) RCH2CH2Oa →RCH=CH2 +OHa (4a) R(R′CH2)CHOa →RCH=CHR′+OHa (5) RCH2CH2Oa →RCH2CHOg +½H2g (5a) R(R′CH2)CHOa →R(R′CH2)COg +½H2g In earlier papers [4,12] we reported that the products of the photo-reforming of various alcohols on Pd/TiO2 are similar to those observed from the decomposition of the alcohols on pure, well-defined Pd surfaces [9,11,13,14] suggesting that the Pd plays a significant role in facilitating alcohol decomposition on the modified TiO2 catalyst. This is not limited to alcohols but extends to a variety of oxygenates, forming products similar to those being observed on well-defined Pd surfaces [15–17]. It suggests therefore that when Pd is present at a TiO2 surface it becomes a dominant site and drives the reaction to follow a more facile kinetic process (decarbonylation and/or dehydrogenation). Similarly, the decomposition of formic acid over Pd/TiO2 catalysts can be attributed to the activity of Pd, not TiO2 with studies on model catalysts suggesting that formic acid diffuses from the TiO2 support to the Pd particles [18]. Campbell et al. [19] have studied the effect of Pt islands on the decomposition of methanol on ZnO single crystals. The coverages involved were much higher than those considered here but the observed effects were similar, with the presence of Pt dramatically altering the reaction pathway followed by the adsorbed methanol. Campbell's conclusion was that the Pt adsorbs preferentially at defect sites and it is these that dominate the reactivity of the ZnO surface. With the use of larger molecules in the present work we are able to examine this proposal and for the Pd/TiO2 system reach a different conclusion. The comparisons made above are largely referenced to work on single crystal Pd, and it is important to investigate in detail how supporting Pd on nanoparticulate TiO2 affects such reactivity patterns. The present work addresses this concern, using temperature-programmed desorption studies (TPD) to investigate the reactivity of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and i-propanol on high surface area titania and Pd/titania samples. We show that whilst dehydration is the only significant reaction pathway for the alcohols on clean TiO2 catalysts, dehydrogenation and decarbonylation dominate when Pd particles are introduced onto the support and that this pathway takes place at a much lower temperature. We also propose that reverse spillover of adsorbate occurs from the support to the metal."
1,Experimental,"The catalysts used in this study are P25 TiO2 (Evonik) and with Pd at a loading of 5wt% Pd/TiO2. PdCl2 (0.1667g, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in 1.5ml deionised water, acidified with HCl to pH 1, and then added drop-wise onto 2g of titania powder while stirring. The samples were dried in static air at 120°C for 2h followed by heating to 500°C (at 50°Cmin−1) and maintained at this temperature for 3h. The resulting catalysts have surface areas of approximately 52m2 g−1 with TEM showing palladium particles of sizes of ∼2–4nm (see Section 4). After calcination XPS showed the surface Cl concentration to be <0.1%. XP spectra were recorded with a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The reactor consists of a stainless steel U-tube (6mm o.d., 4mm i.d.) mounted vertically in an oven that can be held at constant temperature or ramped in temperature at a constant rate. The catalyst (0.5g) was loaded into the reactor tube and pre-treated in flowing helium (99.5% purity, BOC Ltd) at 400°C for 40min in order to remove unwanted carbon or oxygen containing species, confirmed by subsequent TPD in He, which shows no products evolving from the surface. Liquid reactants (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and i-propanol, all 99.8% pure) were injected in 0.5μL injections through a septum assembly and they passed over the sample in well defined pulses until the surface was saturated. The composition of the gas flow after reaction with the catalyst is monitored by mass spectrometry (Hiden Analytical quadrupole (HAL 201)). Saturation of a sample was defined as the point where no adsorption of reactant on the catalyst could be detected from a pulse. For the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments the catalyst was exposed to the adsorbate until saturation, the temperature was then ramped at ∼1°Cs−1 and the desorbing molecules monitored by mass spectrometry. Elucidation of the various products was made by use of the cracking patterns, and of the contribution of fragments to the various peaks in the TPD. For instance, a mass of 28 alone in a peak with no mass 27 indicates CO desorption, whereas desorption of mass 16 with coincident 15 and no higher masses is an indication of methane desorption."

3,Photocatalytic decomposition of alcohols on Pd/TiO2 catalysts,"3.1 Photocatalytic decomposition of alcohols on Pd/TiO2 catalysts We have previously reported data for the photocatalytic activity of a wide range of alcohols [4,12] over 0.5wt% Pd/P25 TiO2 catalysts. Here we are interested in the surface chemistry of these materials, but since 0.5wt% loading represents a small amount of Pd in the material, we have used a much higher loading of Pd in order to more fully understand the role of Pd in the surface chemistry. However, such catalysts are also active for photocatalysis and Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen generated from the photocatalytic reforming of methanol over the 5wt% Pd/TiO2 catalyst used in this study. Over the course of 3h more than 30ml of H2 are evolved, while in the absence of palladium the hydrogen yield is negligible. Hydrogen yields from the other alcohols are similar, as described in detail in the earlier papers [4,12]. Adsorption of the alcohols is carried out at ambient temperature, just as it is in the photocatalysis experiments, and the objective here is to show the nature of the intermediates likely to be formed under these circumstances."
4,Thermal decomposition of alcohols on TiO2,"3.2 Thermal decomposition of alcohols on TiO2 The decomposition of methanol over pure TiO2 catalysts was carried out by saturation at room temperature followed by heating to 400°C. Fig. 2a shows the decomposition patterns of methanol with the main products being dimethyl ether, CO, H2, CH4 and H2O, indicating elements of both dehydrogenation and dehydration. Molecular methanol desorbs at 100°C with weakly held water leaving the surface at 150°C before fully desorbing at around 400°C. H2 and CO desorb coincidently at 330°C, dimethyl ether at 360°C while CH4 and CO appear at 390°C. Methane evolution is a result of CO bond scission implying the presence of Ti3+ sites/anion vacancies which provide a strong interaction with the oxygen atom in the methanol and thus enable CO bond scission [20,21]. The methyl group subsequently picks up an adsorbed hydrogen atom to leave as CH4. We can propose the reaction mechanism for methanol then as follows: (6) AdsorptionCH3OHg +S→CH3OHa (7) DesorptionCH3OHa →CH3OHg +S (8) DissociationCH3OHa +Os →CH3Oa +OHa (9) CH3OHa +OHa →CH3Oa +H2Oa (10) Water desorptionH2Oa →H2Og +Vo (11) Bimolecular de-oxygenation2CH3Oa +Vo →CH3OCH3g +Os +2S (12) Methoxy dehydrogenation (decarbonylation)CH3Oa →COg +1.5 H2g +S (13) Methoxy de-oxygenationCH3Oa +Vo →CH3a +Os (14) Methyl hydrogenationCH3a +Ha →CH4g +2S Here “a” indicates an adsorbed species, Os is a surface lattice oxygen site, S is a surface site (though not all such sites are equivalent) and VO is an anion vacancy. It is likely that the methane formation mechanism is a concerted reaction, since the methyl group would be expected to be unstable with respect to dehydrogenation at 350°C. This is an important property of titania and implies a simplified mechanism of methanol interaction with the surface as follows, with the creation of an anion vacancy in the surface: (15) CH3OH+Os →CO+H2 +H2O+Vo which is then followed by healing of the vacancy by CO bond scission of one of the adjacent methoxy groups: (16) CH3OH+Vo →CH4 +Os So that the overall reaction can be written as the sum of 15 and 16: (17) 2CH3OH→CO+CH4 +H2O+H2 The other reaction is bimolecular dehydration to the ether: (18) 2CH3OH→CH3OCH3 +H2O Importantly, as illustrated in the step by step mechanism (Eqs. (6)–(14)), it would appear that the vacancy creation steps and the vacancy healing steps have very different kinetics. It is clear that water is produced early in the TPD, that is, steps 8 and 9 occur first (from ∼150°C), creating the anion vacancy, whereas steps 11 and 13, which heal the vacancy only occurs later (>300°C). This is likely to be a general mechanism for reaction on a number of oxides, and for a number of alcohols, as shown below. In order to investigate the behaviour of longer chain aliphatic alcohol decomposition on TiO2, ethanol and the two propanol isomers (n-propanol and i-propanol) were studied. The decomposition pattern of ethanol on TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2b. The first desorption peak at 100°C corresponds to ethanol molecular desorption which has characteristic fragments at m/e=31 and 27. These are accompanied by water desorption at m/e=18. Subsequently there are two more distinctive water peaks centred at 300°C and 370°C. Analogous to methanol, a distinctive peak, characteristic of diethyl ether is observed at m/e=31 at 325°C, followed by a sharp and intense peak at 360°C in the m/e=27 spectrum which corresponds to ethylene. This peak is the result of ethanol dehydration catalysed by acid sites on the TiO2 surface, the acid sites being oxygen vacancies. The decomposition spectrum of n-propanol (Fig. 2c) follows a similar dehydration pattern to that of ethanol with H2O, di-n-propyl ether and propylene released as the main products. A broad water desorption peak appears at 280°C and a sharp peak at 400°C, the latter appearing after propylene desorption at 350°C, both deriving from propanol dehydration. The ether evolves at ∼320°C. The decomposition of i-propanol over TiO2 catalysts is very similar to n-propanol (Fig. 2d) except that propylene is produced approximately 60°C lower in temperature, and there is no evidence of ether production. This reduced stability of the i-propoxy intermediate is consistent with a mechanism involving a positively charged α-carbon which would be stabilised by the alkyl substituent in the case of i-propanol as proposed by Kim et al. [22]. Note that the peak temperatures seen here are also very similar to those seen by Kim et al. on single crystal TiO2(110), including the downshift for the secondary alcohol. Thus a general picture of the thermal decomposition of these alcohols on TiO2 can be drawn with dehydration occurring in two separate stages: (i) dehydration of the combined adsorbate–adsorbent system to yield adsorbed alkoxy groups and anion vacancies and (ii) decomposition of the alkoxy group by oxygen abstraction back into the anion vacancy site which requires CO bond dissociation (Eq. (13)). Dehydration occurs in the TPD at ∼200–300°C, though rather than being reaction limited, this may simply represent the temperature range for OH recombination, after alkoxy groups have been formed during adsorption [23]. Subsequent reaction steps eliminate more water at ∼300–400°C, by two routes, which, at least for the C2 and C3 straight chain alcohols are both bimolecular and unimolecular dehydration steps. The former is shown in Eq. (19) below and the latter probably involves surface hydroxyls that act as acidic sites to eliminate β-hydrogen (Eqs. (20)–(22)). (19) 2RCH2CH2OHa →RCH2CH2OCH2CH2Rg +H2Og (20) 2RCH2CH2OHa +Os →2RCH2CH2Oa +H2Og +Vo (21) RCH2CH2Oa +Vo →RCH2CH2a +Oa (22) RCH2CH2a +OHa →RCH=CH2g +H2Og As noted above for methanol, this is likely to be an important general mechanism for many oxide systems, the exact mechanism of which is dictated by the strength of the oxygenmetal bond; the stronger this bond, the more likely step 21 becomes. If the oxygen binding strength in the oxide is weak, then simple dehydrogenation to the aldehyde becomes more probable."
5,Thermal decomposition of alcohols on 5wt% Pd/TiO2,"3.3 Thermal decomposition of alcohols on 5wt% Pd/TiO2 The thermal decomposition spectrum of methanol over a 5wt% Pd/TiO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 3a. In comparison to the pure TiO2 catalyst, methanol decomposition has shifted to a much lower temperature with H2 and CO desorption starting at 130°C and peaking at 250°C. A water desorption peak appears at ∼250°C as in TiO2 but no methane was observed when the temperature was increased up to 400°C implying that CO bond scission is inhibited by the presence of the palladium. The decomposition spectrum in Fig. 3a is similar to the pattern for pure Pd metal in single crystal form [9,14]. An important point is that the lower desorption temperature rules out a process of desorption from the titania followed by reaction on Pd. Instead, it implies diffusion of the methoxy intermediates from the TiO2 support to the Pd particles where reactions with lower activation energies are accessible. The case of ethanol parallels that of methanol. After saturation at room temperature, the catalyst was heated to 400°C and the resulting decomposition products are shown in Fig. 3b. Ethanol is desorbed molecularly at 100°C and, as in the case of methanol, decomposition products were desorbed at much lower temperature over the Pd-doped catalyst than for the TiO2 support alone. Water desorbs over a wide range of temperature but peaks at ∼325°C, arising from OH dissociation of the ethanol. H2 begins to desorb at ∼200°C and is fully desorbed by 400°C. A CO peak was observed at 220°C, together with some acetaldehyde, and followed by CH4 desorption at 280°C. The broad hydrogen peak at 250°C with a shoulder at 320°C shows that the dehydrogenation of ethanol is the main reaction on Pd/TiO2. This implies that, as in the case of ethanol, reaction on the Pd particles dominates and this is confirmed by the presence of CH4 and CO which indicates CC bond scission. Davis and Barteau [9,17], and ourselves more recently [11,24] have reported similar product distributions for ethanol decomposition on pure Pd. Finally, no traces of ethylene were found which rules out CO bond dissociation on the TiO2. In a similar case involving Pt adsorbed on ZnO, Campbell and co-workers suggested that the Pt preferentially adsorbs at the specific sites responsible for the dehydration of methanol but this can be ruled out in the present case by the presence of propene in the decomposition of propanol over Pd/TiO2 indicating that the dehydration sites remain open despite the presence of the palladium. We can therefore conclude that diffusion of the ethoxy species from the TiO2 support to the Pd particles is a facile process during the temperature ramp and that dehydrogenation and decarbonylation on the palladium provide kinetically more favourable routes than reaction on the TiO2 surface itself. The reaction steps for ethanol can be summarised as follows: On TiO2 (23) C2H5OHa +OHa →C2H5Oa +H2Og +Vo On Pd (24) C2H5OHa →C2H5Oa +Ha (25) 2Ha →H2g (26) C2H5Oa →CH3CHOg +Ha (27) C2H5Oa →CH3a +COg +2Ha (28) CH3a +Ha →CH4g n-Propanol adsorption on both palladium and TiO2 surfaces has been reported to take place through the formation of an n-propoxy intermediate [24–26]. In the present experiments, the decomposition of n-propanol over Pd modified TiO2 results mainly in CO, H2, H2O and propylene (Fig. 3c) indicating α CC and CH bond scissions on the Pd surface. However, the propylene peak appeared at 325°C as observed on TiO2 alone, suggesting that the competing CO bond dissociation reaction also occurs, in contrast to the finding for ethanol above. Fig. 3d shows the TPD of i-propanol on the Pd/TiO2. Molecular desorption occurs at 70°C followed by desorption of water at 100°C and then H2, CO, acetone and propylene products. Shekhar and Barteau found that i-propanol decomposes unselectively on the Pd (110) surface giving CO, hydrogen, methane and surface carbon with acetone as an intermediate species [14]. No methane was seen in the present case, suggesting that further dehydrogenation of the methyl groups may occur leaving surface carbon. Propylene appeared at 270°C as in the case of the pure TiO2 sample and the implications of this observation are discussed below."
6,Discussion,"The aim of this work was to investigate the role of deposited Pd nanoparticles in changing the reaction pathways followed by alcohols on TiO2 supports. The TPD studies reported here showed dehydration as the predominant reaction pathway for all the alcohols studied confirming previous reports from the literature [6,27]. A two step mechanism has been proposed: firstly reaction with the acidic hydrogen of the alcohol with basic oxygen sites on the surface lattice of the titania leaving adsorbed alkoxy species and hydroxide species (step T1 in Scheme 1 ). These species then have two routes to further reaction, both of them being dehydration routes. The lower temperature process is the bimolecular dehydration to ether (step T2), the slightly higher temperature route is the monomolecular dehydration, forming alkene (step T3). The latter is likely to occur via surface anion vacancies as proposed by Kim and Barteau [28], and as indicated to be the case from STM studies [29]. It is tempting to consider that step T2 also involves anion vacancies, since one molecule, effectively, has its OH group removed in the reaction. Although anion vacancies are implicated, note that they are only intermediate species since, overall, the reactions are neutral, they do not abstract oxygen from the titania surface. The anion vacancies that are formed are excellent oxygen abstractors and recover their oxygen during the overall reaction cycle. In the case of methanol, the alkene route is obviously not available but the adsorbed methyl is able to intercept a surface hydrogen to desorb as methane. The reactivity pattern is changed when Pd nanoparticles are present on the surface of the titania as shown in Scheme 1. Dissociation of the alcohol to form an alkoxy occurs at both the metal and oxide surfaces but whereas the resulting hydrogen remains as an adatom on metals it forms a hydroxyl group on oxides. In the case of methanol and ethanol, the presence of Pd nanoparticles on the TiO2 support dramatically alters the decomposition pathways with the products of decarbonylation (step P3) and dehydrogenation (step P2) dominating. Methanol undergoes decarbonylation/dehydrogenation with CO being the major carbon product whereas ethanol, shows predominantly methane desorption indicative of an alkoxy intermediate undergoing dehydrogenation of the α-hydrogen followed by decarbonylation (step P3a), as found by ourselves [11,24] and others [9,14,17] previously on well-defined Pd single crystal surfaces. An important observation is that the products from the Pd modified surface desorb at a temperature at least 75°C below those observed on the pure TiO2 surface. The unambiguous conclusion from these results is that the presence of Pd on the surface offers a kinetically more facile reaction pathway for alcohol decomposition than that available on the oxide. This parallels photocatalytic results, where titania shows little reactivity, but Pd/TiO2 is active for photoreforming of alcohols at ambient temperature [2–4,12]. Furthermore, since no ethylene is observed in the presence of Pd, even though it is presumably adsorbed on the titania (as evidenced by alkene production from propanol), the adsorbed alcohol, or more likely, the alkoxy intermediate, must undergo rapid diffusion to adjacent Pd particles, where they can decompose. It is not simply that re-adsorption of products desorbed from TiO2 onto Pd occurs, since this would dictate a desorption temperature similar to that for TiO2 alone. TEM images (Fig. 4 .) indicate a fairly homogeneous distribution of the metal particles across the surface of the titania nanoparticles. The latter are ∼25nm in diameter, whereas, from a number of images, the average Pd particle size is about 3 (±0.5) nm, and the average separation between particles is about 5 (±1) nm. This indicates then, that the maximum diffusion length for adsorbed species to reach the Pd from the support is ∼3nm, roughly 10 lattice sites. On a random walk basis, the average number of sites visited will be 2 this value, ∼14 sites. Evidence has been presented in the literature to indicate that adsorbed alcohols can diffuse on rutile TiO2 (110) by surface translation via oxygen vacancies [30]. In fact, the hopping rate was ∼0.05s−1 at 500°C (by extrapolation of lower temperature data), that is 14 sites could be visited in ∼0.7s. Whilst n-propanol and i-propanol both give CO as a major product on Pd/TiO2 surfaces indicating a Pd mediated pathway, the C2 and C1 hydrocarbons expected from Pd are absent. In contrast to ethanol, they also give the dehydration products typical of reaction on the oxide surface (step T3). The presence of the latter suggests that the bulkier structure of these alcohols reduces the rate of diffusion on the catalyst surface thus enabling dehydration on TiO2 to occur. This observation also indicates that, in contrast to the conclusion reached by Campbell et al. for the deposition of Pt on ZnO [19], the palladium deposited in the present case is not blocking the TiO2 sites responsible for the dehydration reaction. Meanwhile the C2 and C1 products are probably absent because the alkyl fragments can undergo total dehydrogenation depositing C as observed for ethylene on Pd metal surfaces (step P3b) [31,32]. TPD is a non-steady state technique which follows surface species as they become transient in stability and evolve products, and hence is not a complete catalytic cycle. In contrast, the photocatalytic hydrogen production shown in Fig. 1, to which these data relate, is a steady state catalytic phenomenon. So what is the relevance of the TPD data to photocatalysis results? To relate these findings Fig. 5 shows a photocatalytic cycle, in this case for methanol for simplicity. This emphasises that the major catalytic role of the Pd is to enable alcohol decarbonylation/dehydrogenation, but that without the presence of light the Pd surface becomes poisoned with carbon monoxide at ambient temperature, which then prevents alcohol adsorption and so the alcohol reforming reactions cannot take place. Similarly, the products from the alcohols during TPD (CH4 from ethanol for example)) are like to those seen in molecular beam experiments [10,11], and from the photocatalytic reforming itself [4,12]."
7,Conclusion,"None of the alcohols investigated showed any dehydrogenation products or CC bond dissociation over the TiO2 surface. Instead, reaction involved bimolecular and monomolecular dehydration producing ether and alkene compounds. The presence of Pd nanoparticles changes the product distribution dramatically, yielding the dehydrogenation/decarbonylation products characteristic of Pd activity. For ethanol, the dehydration products were not observed when Pd was present, indicating that the adsorbed species diffuse to Pd where they decarbonylate before they can dehydrate on the oxide surface. For longer chain alcohols, diffusion is restricted due to the bulkier structure and the competing dehydration pathways are still observed in the presence of Pd."
