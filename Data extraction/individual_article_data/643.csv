0,Introduction,"In past decades, biocatalysis has been studied extensively for the production of high value-added chemicals in chemical and pharmaceutical industries [35]. Due to mild reaction conditions, high substrate specificity and high stereoselectivity, biocatalysis provides an efficient complementary for the synthesis of many chiral compounds which are difficult to synthesize using traditional chemical methods [9,31,45]. In industrial biocatalysis, heterotrophic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, mildew and yeast are often employed as host cells and immobilized catalysts to express and use enzymes for biotransformation of substrates [6,22,26,37,48]. Therefore, most industrial processes highly rely on the rich culture medium to provide carbon and nitrogen sources such as glucose and peptone for cell growth and enzyme expression, and additional sacrificial substrates and auxiliary enzymes were generally employed for cofactor regeneration, which generate a huge amount of wastewater with high biochemical oxygen demand that cannot be ignored [13,17]. In particular, expensive cofactors, i.e. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), are usually added to reaction mixtures for supplementing insufficient cellular cofactors, further increasing production costs. Recently, autotrophic microorganisms including green algae and cyanobacteria have received increasing attentions as green cell factories for the production of pharmaceuticals [32], chemicals [49] and biofuels [2,11] etc. Compared with heterotrophic organisms, algae can perform efficient photosynthesis and metabolisms to synthesize heterologous proteins from water and CO2 without additional organic carbon and nitrogen sources, which reduces the cost of cell growth and captures CO2 simultaneously [19,38]. In addition to cell metabolism, the whole-cell biocatalyzed synthesis of a variety of chemicals via algae has been achieved [14,27,28,42,47]. Some novel enzymes with unique catalytic functions were discovered in microalgae, demonstrating its big potential as whole-cell catalysts for biocatalysis [4,5,18]. However, the range of applicable enzymes and expression levels in wild-type cyanobacterial strains are limited. Genetically engineered strains have become to take a place in biocatalysis [36]. Many attempts have been made to express one or more heterologous proteins in cyanobacteria catalyzing the desired reactions [3,5,15,36,40]. Notably, NADPH is the direct product of photoreaction and an important reduction cofactor involved in bioenergy and carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria (Fig. 1 ). During the photoreaction process, PS Ⅱ can use light energy to drive the oxidation and decomposition of water on the cavity side of thylakoid membrane to generate electrons. The electrons pass through the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, Cytb6f, plastocyanin/Cytc6 and PS Ⅰ to Fd which is eventually oxidized by Fd-NADP+ reductase (FNR) to generate NADPH [34]. Therefore, the concentration of NADPH in cyanobacteria is approximately 6.5 times higher than nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) [41] while other heterotrophic bacteria, i.e. E. coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contain NADPH 4–5 times lower than NADH [25]. The physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria are completely different from bacteria and fungi such as E. coli and yeast. Cyanobacteria can not only be cultivated on a large scale like microorganisms, but also have photosynthetic metabolic pathways similar to plant cells. The photoautotrophic metabolism of cyanobacteria allows continuous supply of oxygen and NADPH [39], thus overcoming the limitations that heterotrophic hosts often face in biotransformation, and their high atom utilization makes them attractive for redox-based biotechnology purposes [7,38]. We compared the advantages and disadvantages of typical four types of living cell biocatalysts in these terms, growth cycle, nutritional mode, substrate tolerance, safety, asymmetric reduction ability, cofactor regeneration (Table S1). Thus, cyanobacteria show potential advantages in the asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones which requires a large amount of NADPH to drive reactions towards chiral alcohols in high yields. Among many cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is the first photosynthetic organisms to complete whole-genome sequencing, which provides a clear genetic background for its metabolic engineering and synthetic biology manipulation [1]. Although the biotransformation of cyanobacteria as a whole-cell catalyst have reported [12,28,29,46], the influence factor of its unique physiological characteristics on the catalytic performance is unclear, which impedes the further development for biocatalysis. In particular, it is necessary to elucidate the effect of photosynthetic regeneration of the reductive cofactor NADPH on catalytic properties of cyanobacteria for asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds in order to develop an efficient whole-cell catalyst for industrial biocatalysis. Herein, we investigated the asymmetric synthesis of ten important chiral alcohols for the production of pharmaceuticals using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a whole-cell biocatalyst (Fig. 1). The reaction conditions including substrate concentration, reaction temperature, light intensity, growth state and cell concentration were optimized for the model substrate 3-chloroacetophenone (1b). In addition, two compounds, Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt, were added to regulate the regeneration and consumption of NADPH in Synechocystis to explore its influence on asymmetric reduction of various ketones."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Algae strain and culture system,"2.1 Algae strain and culture system The wild-type strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were cultivated in BG11 or on BG11 agar plates under constant light intensity of 50 μmol/m2/s at 30 °C. It was then inoculated into BG11 medium containing in flasks (120 rpm) or column photo-bioreactors (PBRs, 6 cm × 60 cm). For PBRs, the air was bubbled 1vvm, with a LED light source was placed on both sides of the incubator; and the glass-made, light-transmitting, easy-to-clean column reactor was 3 cm away from the light source. The light incubator used in the experiment is gear-adjusted, and there are 9 gears with fixed light intensity."
3,Biotransformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,"2.2 Biotransformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 The reaction volume for all biotransformation with Synechocystis was 10 mL. The reaction was started by mixing BG11 medium, the substrate stock solution (200 mM in DMSO) and algal cell suspension (OD730 = 30) in a 50 mL triangle bottle. The reaction parameters including temperature, light intensity, algae cell concentration and substrate concentration were changed accordingly. Within 48 h, 6 samples of 200 μL were collected at different time points (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h) for analysis. NaCl and saturated Na2CO3 solution (200 μL) were added to quench the reaction. Samples were frozen at −20 °C before chromatography analysis."
4,Product extraction and analysis,"2.3 Product extraction and analysis Samples were extracted with 400 μL ethyl acetate containing 2 mM n-dodecane as an internal standard. After vortexing for 5 min, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000g. The upper organic phase was collected and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The structure of the products were analyzed by chiral gas chromatography with a chiral chromatographic column GC/CP-Chirasil-Dex-CB (25 m × 0.25 mM × 0.39 mM, Varian) and a flame ionization detector. GC conditions used to determine the enantioselectivity of corresponding products were provided in Table S2 and Fig. S2."
5,NADPH regulation and measurement in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,"2.4 NADPH regulation and measurement in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Regulating NADPH of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by inorganic salts were carried out. Angeli’s Salt and Na2S2O3 were chosen to add in the culture broth. For NADPH analysis, 30 mL liquid was taken and centrifuged to collect algae cells. 1 mL of 0.3 M perchloric acid and 1 mM EDTA were added to lyse the algae cells. After centrifugation, cell debris was discard. 0.1 mL of 2 M K2CO3 was adding to 0.5 mL of the supernatant to neutralize the reaction. The supernatant was taken after centrifuging again. The absorbance of the supernatant at 340 nm was detected by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Fig. S1) [33]."
6,Statistical analysis,"2.5 Statistical analysis Results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) from triple samples. Independent sample T test were performed with SPSS software to determine the statistical significance of the data. When p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**), the differences was considered significant."
7,Result and discussion,
8,Substrate scope,"3.1 Substrate scope First, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was used to catalyze 10 aromatic ketones, and the conversion and stereoselectivity of different substrates were determined. As shown in Table 1 , 1 mM acetophenone and its derivatives (1a–1h) can be asymmetrically reduced by Synechocystis, affording chiral alcohols 2a–2e with >99% ee and 2f–2h with 83–92% ee. The ee of 2b (>99%) is higher than the reported value (54%) using red algae [43]. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cannot catalyze the two aromatic keto esters 1i and 1j. However, the concentrations of 1i and 1j decreased in the reaction systems. We speculated that 1i and 1j may be metabolized as a carbon source for cell growth. After 24 h, the conversion of 1b, 1c, 1f, 1g and 1h reached >50%, while the conversion of 1a, 1d and 1e were relatively low. We also found that chlorine substituted acetophenone derivatives showed a strong toxicity on Synechocystis, and the toxicity increased with the number of chlorines. At the same substrate concentration, the death rate of 1g is much higher than that of 1b in Synechocystis. Synechocystis almost completely died at 36 h after adding 1 mM 1g, while the algae cells still maintained a growth state when 1 mM 1b was added. The death of cyanobacteria was recognized by a color change to blue. The conversion and stereoselectivity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 towards 1b were the best. Thus, 1b was selected as the model substrate for further optimization."
9,Optimization of reaction conditions,"3.2 Optimization of reaction conditions First, the time-course conversions of 1b by Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 of different cell densities were performed (Fig. 2 a). As the cell density increased, the conversion of 1b at different times was enhanced. When OD730 = 15, the conversion reached 95% at 36 h, which was the highest in all cases. Increasing cell density to OD730 20 did not lead to higher conversion, indicating that the equilibrium of the enzymatic reaction may be reached. Therefore, OD730 15 was chosen as the optimal algal cell concentration for the reaction system. The ee of product 2b was >99%, which was not affected by the concentration of algae cells. Next, algal cells in the lag phase, log phase and stable phase were collected according to the growth curve and tested for the catalytic capability. As shown in Fig. 2b, the reaction efficiency of algae cells in the exponential phase was the best. Whole-cell biocatalysts are susceptible to substrate inhibition [10], and a high substrate concentration may toxify algae cells and reduce the catalytic efficiency [16]. As shown in Fig. 2c, when the substrate concentration exceeded 2 mM, the algal cells were toxified and the conversions dropped significantly with the maximum conversion < 20%. The appropriate substrate concentration was 2 mM, providing conversion > 90% and ee > 99% at 48 h. Light affects the photosynthesis of algae cells and reaction rates. The conversion increased with the increase of the light intensity (Fig. 2d). When the light intensity reached a certain value, the conversion reached equilibrium. The final conversion of the substrate under the two light intensities of 200 and 250 µmol/m2/s was almost the same, thus 200 μmol/m2/s was selected for the following studies. After that, the reaction temperatures were further optimized (Fig. 2e). When the temperature reaches 30 °C, the final substrate conversion was highest. 30 °C was also the best culture temperature for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which could maintain the best physiological state. In addition to substrate toxicity and inhibition, products may also hinder the catalytic performance of algae cells. We added 2b of 0–4 mM to the reaction system and started the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2f, when 1 mM 2b was added the conversion was lowered at different time periods. With product concentration increased, the inhibition effect was stronger. When product concentration exceeded 2 mM, the reaction was completely terminated and the algae cells died slowly. Under the optimal reaction conditions, the catalytic effect of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 on 10 substrates was determined, and the conversion and ee at the 48 h were determined (Table 1). Considering the toxicity of the substrate to the algae, we chose a concentration of 1 mM. As shown in Table 1, after extending the reaction time to 48 h under optimal conditions, the conversion of substrate 1a-h had been improved and clearly they are not linear. The conversion of 1b and 1c are higher in these substrates. The conversion of 1b had increased to 95%, and the conversion of 1c had increased to 80%. The conversion of 1d and 1e was still very low, only about 2%. At 48 h, neither substrate 1a-h was detected. Due to the strong toxicity of 1f, 1g and 1h, the algal cells gradually died within 48 h, and the final conversion were not greatly improved. The ee of each product did not fluctuate much, and there was almost no change. The chiral products corresponding to the two aromatic ketone ester substrates 1i and 1j were still not detected."
10,Regulating NADPH of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by inorganic salts,"3.3 Regulating NADPH of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by inorganic salts It has been reported that the amount of NADPH in algae cells can be regulated by reducing the consumption of NADPH in the Calvin cycle and increasing the recovery of NADPH in photosynthesis [23]. In the photoreaction stage, cyanobacteria convert water into H+ and electrons, and generates O2 at the same time. Electrons are transferred to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) through the photosynthetic electron transport chain, thereby completing the regeneration process of the photosynthetic coenzyme NADPH. In this process, the activity of FNR, the reduction efficiency of PQ, the source of reduced hydrogen and the electron transfer efficiency can affect the regeneration efficiency of NADPH. In the Calvin cycle, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a cysteine thiol protein with an important catalytic effect. It can be activated by reduced thioredoxin (TRX) and participates in the fixation of CO2 and consumes NADPH at the same time. [24] One of the most important biological targets of HNO is the thiol protein, which can oxidize a variety of thiols in the cell to inhibit the activity of GAPDH [44]. Na2S2O3 can be used as an electron donor to provide photoelectrons necessary for the regeneration of coenzyme NADPH and improve the regeneration efficiency of NADPH [8,20,30]. We added different concentrations of Na2S2O3 to the Synechocystis catalytic reaction system, and tested its effect on the NADPH content in algae cells and the catalytic efficiency. The results showed that the addition of an appropriate concentration of Na2S2O3 had a positive effect on the catalytic reaction of 1b. When 3.2 g/L Na2S2O3 was added, the conversion of 1b reaches 95% at 36 h (Fig. 3 a and b); however, it took 48 h to reach the same conversion for the control group without the addition of Na2S2O3 (p < 0.05). The > 99% ee of the product was not affected by the addition of Na2S2O3. Angeli’s Salt is an Nitroxyl (HNO) donor, which can inhibit GAPDH activity and reduce the consumption of coenzyme NADPH in the Calvin cycle [21]. Therefore, we added Angeli’s Salt of different concentrations to the reaction system to regulate the amount of NADPH in the cyanobacteria cells (Fig. 3c and d). When the concentration of Angeli’s Salt was 20 mg/L, the conversion at 36 h increased from 88% to 95% compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The time to reach the maximum conversion efficiency was shortened by 12 h. In addition, we also tried to add 3.2 g/L Na2S2O3 and 20 mg/L Angeli’s Salt to the reaction system at the same time to explore if there is a synergic effect for the improvement of cofactor regeneration. Compared with the reactions in which Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt were added separately, the reaction rate of the system added with Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt together did not show apparent change (Fig. 3e and f). The catalytic system with separate addition of Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt reached the maximum conversion of 95% (p < 0.05) at 36 h, while the catalytic system with the addition of Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt still needed 48 h to reach 95% conversion. Then, we attempted to elucidate how these inorganic salts influenced NADPH regeneration in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. First, Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt were added in the lag phase of Synechocystis growth (Fig. 4 a). The results showed that the two compounds could increase the content of intracellular NADPH to varying degrees in the first two days, and the NADPH content in the following 3–7 days did not significantly increase compared with the control group. It should be noted that these inorganic salts are not necessary in the living cell catalytic system, thus the increase of some by-products (such as excessive sulfate and nitrate) may affect the progress of catalytic reaction and increase the difficulty of product post-treatment. In addition, the excessive accumulation of these unnecessary by-products will also increase the burden on the growth of cyanobacteria. These factors might be the potential reason for the rapid decline of activity to the same level as the control group after 2 days. Therefore, we took the algae cells in the exponential growth phase and measured the changes of intracellular NADPH within 48 h after adding exogenous compounds (Fig. 4b). Both Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt could increase the NADPH content in Synechocystis. Angeli’s Salt had a significant effect at the initial stage. At 12 h, the NADPH content was 25% higher than that of the control group. After adding Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt at the same time, the increase in NADPH of cyanobacteria was less than when they were added separately, which was not favorable for the accumulation of NADPH. This may explain why the reaction efficiency of adding two compounds at the same time was not as good as the reaction efficiency of adding respectively."
11,Conclusion,"In this study, we explored the substrate specificity and selectivity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a living cell biocatalyst to catalyze 10 aromatic ketones. Using 3-chloroacetophenone as a model substrate, various conditions of the catalytic reaction were optimized. Under the optimal condition, the conversion of 1b and product ee reached 95% and 99%, respectively. We found that the metabolism of intracellular NADPH of Synechocystis was increased up to 25% by adding Na2S2O3 and Angeli’s Salt, and the time to reach the maximum conversion was shortened by 12 h. The unique photoautotrophic metabolism of algae cells can produce a large number of enzyme catalysts and provide high reducing power, which is a potential sustainable production platform for chiral chemicals in the future."
