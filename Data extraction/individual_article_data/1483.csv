0,Introduction,"The ferrocenyl group has been widely explored in different areas, from polymers 1 to bioorganometallic chemistry. 2 Among several applications, the use of ferrocene-based chiral ligands in asymmetric synthesis is the most prominent. 3 A typical example is the production of the enantiomerically pure products (+)-biotin and dextromethorphan by Lonza Fine Chemicals, using ferrocenyl-type phosphine ligands developed by Ciba-Geigy, in catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations. 4 The synthesis of chiral ferrocenyl compounds frequently makes use of enantiopure 1-ferrocenyl alcohols as key intermediates, 5 and different procedures have been developed in order to obtain these compounds. Preparation methods described in the literature are either not simple or do not give satisfactory yields. Generally they use air-sensitive organometallic reagents. One method uses enantioselective reductions of prochiral ferrocenyl ketones with the Corey–Bakshi–Shibata (CBS) catalytic system to give the respective alcohols with a high yield and high ee in a few minutes. 5a,c,6 However, the chiral β-methylated oxazaborolidine catalyst is expensive and a large amount of catalyst is often required (typically 10–30mol%). Another efficient method for the preparation of optically active alcohols is the catalytic alkylation of ferrocene carboxaldehydes with dialkylzincs in the presence of catalytic chiral aminoalcohols. 5d,7 Enantiomeric-rich ferrocene derivatives have also been obtained by resolution of the respective racemates with biocatalytic systems 5b,8 and by diastereoselective oxidation of ferrocenyl amino alcohol diastereoisomeric mixtures. 9 Recently, we published the use of asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) to reduce and resolve some racemic arylketones–tricarbonylchromium complexes possessing planar chirality with RuII-aminoalcohol chiral catalyst in 2-PrOH as the solvent and hydrogen donor. 10 The tricarbonylchromium fragment, Cr(CO)3, is an electron-withdrawing group attached to the six carbon atoms of the aryl ligand that reduces the electron density on the neighboring keto group. 11 However, the contrary effect occurs with electron-rich substrates, 12 such as ferrocenyl ketones, in this case due to the electron-rich η5-cyclopentadienyl ligand. 13 These opposite eletronic effects and the possibility to obtain chiral 1-ferrocenyl alcohols with a simple and versatile catalytic system, motivated us to employ transfer hydrogenation for the asymmetric reduction of 1-ferrocenyl ketones."
1,Results and discussion,"Ferrocenyl ketones 1a and 1b were synthesized from the reactions of ferrocene with the respective anhydride in the presence of phosphoric acid. Compound 1c was synthesized from chloroacetyl chloride and ferrocene using aluminum chloride 14 and it was the starting material to obtain α-azidoacetylferrocene 1d by halogen-azido substitution (Scheme 1 ). Compound 1d was isolated as orange crystals (mp 63–64°C) and characterized by NMR and elemental analysis. Initial experiments with ATH were carried out using either 1a (Scheme 2 ) or 1b having 2-PrOH as the hydrogen donor and the combination [RuCl2(η6-benzene)]/(−)-(1R,2S)-ephedrine as the catalyst precursor. The conversions to their respective alcohols (R)-2a (>98% ee) and 2b (1-ferrocenylpropanol) were relatively low at room temperature: 22% for the hydrogenation of 1a and only 6% for 1b. A small increment of 1b conversion to 2b (13%) was observed by increasing the reaction temperature to 60°C. Alcohol 2b was isolated, but it had decomposed somewhat. Reductions of the corresponding arylketones, acetophenone, and propiophenone, under the same reaction conditions at room temperature, resulted in high conversions (93–97%) to their respective alcohols (R)-1-phenylethanol (62% ee) and (R)-1-phenylpropanol (41% ee). The organochromium complexes (η6-acetophenone)Cr(CO)3 and (η6-propiophenone)-Cr(CO)3 also demonstrated high conversions to the respective alcohols (95% and 96%). 10 The lower conversion of the ferrocenyl ketones in comparison to the respective arylketones and arylketone–Cr(CO)3 complexes can be explained by electronic effects. The Cr(CO)3 fragment is an electron-withdrawing group, 15 while the cyclopentadienyl ring at the ferrocene moiety is rich in electrons, 13 reducing the positive character of the carbonyl carbon. The acetophenone and propiophenone are in an intermediate situation. In opposition to the low yield, the ee determined for (R)-2a (>98%) demonstrated a highly enantioselective process when compared with ATH of the compound (η6-acetophenone)Cr(CO)3 to (R)-(η6-phenylethanol)Cr(CO)3 (33% ee). The enantioselectivity of ATH catalyzed with RuII-arene complexes is attributed to the CH/π attraction between the η6-arene–Ru and the aryl substituent in the ketone. 16 With the ferrocenyl ketones, the π electrons of the cyclopentadienyl ring are responsible for this attraction, which must be more effective than for aryl rings. The good ee obtained for the initial reductions of ferrocenyl-ketones motivated us to keep employing the benzene derivative of the arene–Ru catalyst instead of the more commonly used p-cymene derivative for the asymmetric reduction of 1-ferrocenyl ketones. However, the low conversions obtained for the reductions of 1a and 1b by ATH in 2-PrOH, led us to try the reverse reaction in the resolution of rac-2a (Scheme 3 ). The reaction procedure was practically identical to that used for ATH reductions of ferrocenyl ketones with the Ru(η6-benzene)/(−)-ephedrine catalytic system. The only modification was the change of solvent after the generation of the pre-catalyst: 2-PrOH was evaporated and acetone was added. The reaction was carried out after the addition of the substrate and KOH solution in 2-PrOH. After 20h, the reaction was interrupted and 1H NMR analysis of the products mixture showed 41% of acetylferrocene and 59% of unreacted alcohol, isolated in 36% yield of (S)-2a (77% ee). A similar experiment was described with a chiral diamine–RuII catalyst: [Ru(η6-mesytilene)(1S,2S)-TsDPEN]. 51% of unreacted (R)-2a in 98% ee was recovered after 36h of reaction. 17 In an attempt to increase the yields of 1-ferrocenyl alcohols (R)-2a and (R)-2b we carried out the reductions of 1a and 1b with formic acid/triethylamine azeotrope as the hydrogen donor. The chiral modifier used as the ruthenium catalyst was the diamine (1R,2R)-TsDPEN. The reduction of 1a for 4 days showed a conversion of 89% to (R)-2a in 98% ee (Scheme 2). The gain in conversion was significant in comparison to ATH in 2-PrOH with the RuII-(−)-ephedrine catalytic system, representing an improvement in the yield achieved by Patti and Pedotti (35% yield, 92% ee). 18 The reduction of 1b showed a conversion of 23% to 2b, approximately four times the conversion observed for the reduction using 2-PrOH/RuII-(−)-ephedrine system at room temperature, but the crude product did show some decomposition before being purified. The efficiency gain using formic acid as the hydrogen donor in comparison with 2-PrOH is probably due to irreversibility of the reaction. This hydrogen donor produces carbon dioxide, which is eliminated from the reaction mixture preventing the reverse reaction. In the case of ATH using 2-PrOH as hydrogen donor, the acetone produced remains in the reaction medium and can act as a hydrogen acceptor, allowing reversibility of the reaction. 19 This effect may be responsible for the low conversion observed for the ATH of 1a with 2-PrOH. The α-chloro- and α-azidoacetylferrocene, 1c and 1d, respectively, were submitted to reduction with formic acid/triethylamine azeotrope in the presence of the RuII(benzene)-(1R,2R)-TsDPEN catalytic system. After 24h, 1c was completely consumed and the respective alcohol (R)-2c was isolated in a 64% yield with an excellent enantiomeric excess (>98% ee) (Scheme 4 ). This compound was obtained in a 92% yield with the same ee via the (S)-CBS catalyst (30mol%) and BH3·SMe2 as the hydride source. 6a We attempted to reduce 1c with 2-PrOH using the RuII-(−)-ephedrine system, but the conversion to 2c was low (≈15%) and the reaction was not further explored. The azido compound 1d was completely consumed after 4 days at room temperature and the respective alcohol (R)-2d was isolated in 67% yield with high ee (>98%) (Scheme 4). The ATH of 1d with the 2-PrOH/RuII-(−)-ephedrine system consumed the substrate without the formation of the expected alcohol 2d, probably due to the basic medium and side reactions at the sensitive α-halogenated center. 20 Therefore, the RuII–arene–TsDPEN complex remains as one of the best catalysts for the enantioselective reduction of a carbonyl group. 12 Considering the ATH of 1a, 1c, and 1d, producing (R)-2a, (R)-2c, and (R)-2d in good yields and excellent ee, it is possible to explain the high stereoselectivity using the mechanism for ATH proposed by Noyori 21 for metal ligand bifunctional catalysts, adapted here for our case (Scheme 5 ), via a concerted six-membered transition state, which is supported by computational studies. 22 The chiral auxiliaries (−)-ephedrine and (R,R)-TsDPEN probably lead to hydride intermediates with an (S)-configuration at the Ru atom based on NMR and X-ray diffraction studies. 23 According to Scheme 5, the resultant TS A must be favored in comparison to TS B due to the CH/π attraction between the η6-benzene–Ru and the electron-rich cyclopentadienyl ring of the ferrocenyl ketone. 16 The TS A is responsible for the (R)-configuration for the 1-ferrocenyl alcohols produced, while TS B is the responsible for their (S)-enantiomers. These results have recently been proven by Wills et al. in their studies on the enantiocontrol of Noyori/Ikariya catalysts in the ATH of ketones. 24"
2,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new possibility for the enantioselective synthesis of 1-ferrocenylethanol, 2-chloro-1-ferrocenylethanol, and 2-azido-1-ferrocenylethanol from the respective ferrocenyl ketones using the simple ATH catalyzed RuII(benzene)-diamine system, with HCO2H–Et3N as the hydrogen transfer agent. The compounds produced in a high ee (⩾98%) are important precursors of chiral ferrocene derivatives, including the ligands for asymmetric catalysis."
