0,Introduction,"The Brazilian agribusiness sector has been recognized worldwide for the sugarcane industry. In 2012/2013 crop was produced around 26 billion liters of ethanol [1]. However, several challenges must be overcome to make this process fully sustainable, including the treatment and disposal of vinasse, which is wastewater generated from the production of first-generation ethanol. For the 2012/2013 crop, approximately 312 billion liters of vinasse were generated, with an average of 10–14 L of vinasse L−1 ethanol produced. Due to its high organic matter content, low pH and amounts of macro and micronutrients, sugarcane vinasse could be used to produce hydrogen. According to Fernandes et al. [2], a maximum hydrogen yield (YH2) of 25 mmol-H2 g−1COD could be obtained in batch tests using vinasse from corn alcohol production, fact that motivated the present study. Anaerobic packed bed reactors (APBR) are a good alternative for hydrogen production because they have a simple configuration and are able to increase the cell retention time, resulting in a higher concentration of biomass in the reactor. Furthermore, these reactors do not require mechanical agitation and recirculation apparatuses when further dilution is not necessary. These characteristics result in lower construction and operation costs [3,4]. In APBR, the choice of the material for microorganism adhesion can be a determining factor in selecting the appropriate microbial population, which is crucial for the successful implementation and performance of a reactor [5]. Several studies have reported the influence of the support material on hydrogen production in APBR and in anaerobic fluidized bed reactors (AFBR) using different HRT values and organic loading rates (OLR) (Table 1 ). Different support materials have been evaluated in hydrogen production and under different operational conditions, including reactor designs, substrates, pH values, inoculum, HRT values, and temperatures (Table 1). However, these studies used synthetic wastewater, and there is a lack of knowledge regarding how support materials influence hydrogen production when real wastewater is used. In this context, this paper reports on the evaluation of biohydrogen production from Brazilian sugarcane vinasse in APBR. To select an appropriate support, four types of materials: expanded clay (EC), charcoal (Ch), a porous ceramic (PC), and low-density polyethylene (LDP) were evaluated. The influence of the support material on hydrogen production and on the selection of microbial communities were assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Support material,"2.1 Support material Four different materials were used as a support matrix. Their characteristics are presented in Table 2 . The materials were chosen for their biomass adhesion properties, which included porosity, uniformity, structural resistance, and inherence during the hydrogen production process [13]."
3,Reactor configuration,"2.2 Reactor configuration Four up-flow APBR were built using acrylic tubes with an internal diameter of 80 mm and an outer diameter of 88 mm. The ratio of particle diameter to column diameter (øsupport/øinternal reactor) was 1/8 to reduce wall effects [14]. The APBR were divided into four zones: (i) the feed zone (L1 = 100 mm - 0.5 L); (ii) the reaction zone or packed-bed (L2 = 500 mm - 2.5 L); (iii) the effluent collection zone (L3 = 100 mm - 0.5 L); and (iv) biogas collection zone (L4 = 50 mm - 0.25 L), resulting in total and liquid volumes of approximately 3.5 and 2.3 L, respectively (Fig. 1 A)."
4,Substrate,"2.3 Substrate Wastewater (sugarcane vinasse) from the sugarcane industry (São Martinho, Pradópolis, São Paulo, Brazil) was used as the substrate. The wastewater, generated in the distillation to obtain ethanol, was provided by the industry and maintained at 4 °C until use. Prior to being fed into the reactors, the raw wastewater (vinasse) was filtered with a paper filter (Nalgon, density of 80 g m², porosity of 3 μm) to reduce the concentration of suspended solids and to avoid bed clogging in the reactor. No dilution was performed. The pH value of the vinasse, which was initially near 4.6, was adjusted to 6.5 with a 50% (w/v) NaOH solution. The COD filtered (3 μm) value was used as a parameter for the OLR calculation. The chemical composition of the wastewater was determined previously and is presented in Table 3 ."
5,Inoculation,"2.4 Inoculation The inoculum was obtained through the natural wastewater fermentation process. The filtered vinasse with an adjusted pH of 6.5 was maintained for three days in a dark chamber to allow for autochthonous microorganism growth. After this period, the fermented effluent with the cultured biomass was pumped into the reactor and recirculated for 5 days to enhance the attachment of the biomass to the support matrix [3]."
6,Operation of the reactors for hydrogen production,"2.5 Operation of the reactors for hydrogen production Hydrogen production was evaluated in four up-flow packed bed reactors arranged in parallel with different support materials. The reactors were fed continuously with the prepared vinasse using peristaltic pumps (Gilson® model Minipuls) in a thermostatic chamber (25 °C), as shown in Fig. 1B. A HRT of 24 h was applied, resulting in an OLR of 36.4 kg-COD m−3 d−1. Hydrodynamic assays were conducted at the beginning and end of the operation to evaluate changes in the up-flow behavior. Sodium chloride (10 g L−1) was used as a tracer. The effluent was monitored by a conductivity probe (Vernier®) coupled to a data acquisition system (CBL 2TM - Texas Instruments® IT 89). The data generated were processed using the Microcal Origin 8.0® software and adjusted using the Boltzmann sigmoidal model."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The flow rate of gas was measured using a Ritter® MilligasCounter gas meter. The analytical composition of the biogas, which consisted of hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4), was determined using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph-2010® GC equipped with a capillary column Carboxen 1010 PLOT (30 m × 0.32 mm) and thermal conductivity detector [4]. The total carbohydrates concentration was determined by the phenol-sulfuric method using sucrose (1% w/v) as the standard curve [15]. Acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, and caproic acids and the solvents, methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol, were analyzed in a Shimadzu GC 2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) column and an HP-Innowax column with an internal diameter of 30 × 0.25 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 μm, as described previously [16]. The pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ODP), TCOD, SCOD, volatile suspended solids (VSS), total organic carbon (TOC), phosphorus, sulfate, and total and ammoniacal nitrogen values were determined based on the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [17]."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis The Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for homoscedasticity were used to determine whether variances in the results were similar. The non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was used to analyze the variances and compare averages with a 5% significance level, as proposed by [18]."
9,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),2.8 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Support material samples were analyzed at the end of the operational period (on day 30) using SEM according to the method proposed by [19] and adapted by [20]. A microscope (Philips XL30 FEG) coupled to an image capture software (Link ISIS) was used.
10,Molecular analysis,"2.9 Molecular analysis The biomass attached to the support material at the end of the reactors operation was used for the T-RFLP analysis. Biomass was detached from 35 g of support material by applying an ultrasound treatment (40 W for 5 min), followed by centrifugation (5 min at 6000 g and 25 °C). Samples for real-time PCR and 454 pyrosequencing were collected from the feed zone where biomass was accumulated and from five sampling points distributed along the bed zone of the APBR (suspended biomass) at day 10, 20, and 30 days of operation. Cells were separated by centrifugation (5 min at 6000 g and 25 °C), and 0.2 g of wet biomass from each sampling point was pooled into a sample consisting of 1.2 g of wet biomass (compose sample)."
11,DNA extraction,2.10 DNA extraction Total DNA was extracted as described by [21]. The quality of the extracted DNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis using an agarose (BIO-RAD) gel (0.8%) stained with ethidium bromide. The genomic DNA was purified using Illustra CFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification kits (GE Healthcare®) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
12,Fe-hydrogenase gene quantification by real-time PCR,"2.11 Fe-hydrogenase gene quantification by real-time PCR The number of copies of the Fe-hydrogenase gene in the DNA samples was determined using the method described by [22]. The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 10 μL of SYBR Green mix (Rotor Gene SYBR Green RT-PCR kit, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), 1 μL of each primer, and 8 μL of template. The amplification conditions and primers used were the same as those described by [22]. A calibration curve was constructed using 10-fold dilutions of a Fe-hydrogenase gene produced via PCR using a Fe-hydrogenase clone (clone A10) as a standard, as previously described [4]. The amplification reactions were performed in a Rotor Gene 6000 device (Corbett Research, Sidney, Australia). The results were analyzed using the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time rotary analyzer software (version 1.7). The reaction was performed in duplicate, and the average and standard deviation were determined. DNA was quantified using a fluorometer (Qubit2.0, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)."
13,454-Pyrosequencing,"2.12 454-Pyrosequencing Two compose samples collected at days 10 and 30 from APBR bed filled with LDP were selected for microbial communities analysis by bacterial 16S rRNA gene 454-pyrosequencing. DNA was precipitated with 95% ethanol, dried at room temperature and then sent to the Institute for Agrobiology Rosario (INDEAR, Rosario, Argentina), where the pyrosequencing analysis was performed using a Roche Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified with primers for the V4 region: 563f (CACGACGTTGTAAAACGACAYTGGGYDTAAAGNG), for which the tag was included, and 802r (CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC) using a barcode with 10 bp. The F563 and R802 primers (V4 hypervariable region) were used in the 454 GS-FLX equipment (Roche Life Science) at INDEAR (www.indear.com)."
14,454-pyrosequencing Data analysis,"2.13 454-pyrosequencing Data analysis Sequence analysis was performed by the INDEAR bioinformatic service using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software [23]. Reads with length less than 200 bases, quality coefficients greater than 25, homopolymer sizes greater than 6, and ambiguous bases were removed. As a result, 96% of the sequences evaluated were 280 bp. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined using the UCluster method [24] in the QIIME software based on 97% identity, and OTUs that contained less than two sequences (singletons) were removed from the analysis. Representative sequences of each OTU were classified using the RDP-classifier tool with a similarity value of greater than or equal to 97% [25]. The sequences were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk) under accession number PRJEB5266."
15,T-RFLP analysis,"2.14 T-RFLP analysis The microbial composition of the biomass developed in the four reactors was analyzed by T-RFLP using samples taken from the attached biomass at day 30 of operation. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using specific primers 27F (labeled with 6-carboxy-fluorescein at 5′ position) and 1429R [26]. The purification of the PCR product, quantification, digestion with restriction enzyme MspI, and fragment purification were performed according to the method described by [27]. The fragments were separated and detected in a sequencer 3130 (Applied Biosystems) using the internal label Liz Gene Scan-1000 (Applied Biosystems) at the Institut Pasteur of Montevideo sequencing service. The chromatograms were analyzed using the Peak Scanner software (version 1.0) and standardized as proposed by [28]. Cluster analysis was performed using the PAST software [29]. The Jaccard index was applied as shown in Equation (1). (1) d j k = M/ ( M + N ) The Jaccard equation considers the presence and absence of microorganisms, where M is the number of terminal fragments (strain) in sample 1 and N is the number of terminal fragments (strain) in sample 2."
16,Results and discussion,
17,Performance of the reactors,"3.1 Performance of the reactors Four APBR with different support materials were operated in parallel for 30 days using the same substrate, HRT (24 h), and OLR (36.4 kg-COD m−3 d−1) at 25 °C. Similar pH, COD, and total carbohydrate conversion results were obtained in the four reactors (Fig. 2 ). A decrease in pH was observed for all of the reactors during the first 10 days of operation (Fig. 2A). The mean pH values of the effluent were characteristic of fermentative systems applied to hydrogen production (mean values of 5.5) [4]. Total COD (TCOD) and soluble COD (SCOD) conversion ranged from 37.3% to 40.1% (Fig. 2B) and from 13.1% to 16.7% (Fig. 2C), respectively, resulting in volatile fatty acid (VFA) production (acetic, butyric, and propionic acid, as presented below). An adaptation period of 10 days was observed to the carbohydrate conversion in the reactors filled with LDP and EC (Fig. 2D)."
18,Bio-hydrogen production,"3.2 Bio-hydrogen production The different materials evaluated exhibited a strong influence on hydrogen production and yield, with high values of hydrogen production for the reactors filled with EC and LDP and low values of hydrogen production for the reactors filled with Ch and the PC (Fig. 3 ). The produced biogas exhibited maximum hydrogen contents of 46.3% (LDP), 39.1% (EC), 26.5% (Ch), and 4% (PC). Methane was not observed in the biogas during the entire experimental period, indicating that the strategy used for inoculation was adequate to avoid methanogenesis. Hydrogen was produced in all reactors for a short time, no more than 15 days. When LDP, EC and Ch were used as support material, hydrogen production reached a peak, after which the values decreased to zero, while the reactor with PC presented an unstable behavior with traces of hydrogen in the biogas (Fig. 3). Such ephemeral behavior observed for hydrogen production is explored in the last topic of this section. Table 4 provides an overview of the results obtained in our study in terms of the different units commonly used in the literature. A normality test indicated that the distribution of data on hydrogen production and yield was nonparametric for all monitored reactors. Thus, applying the Mann–Whitney test, which is used for nonparametric data, with a significance level of 5% indicated that the results obtained in reactors filled with Ch and PC were statistically similar, as were the reactors with EC and LDP, in terms of hydrogen production and yield. Both LDP and EC 1 1 Expanded clay price (0–5 mm): Cotation realized at Terrafort Comécio Agrícola and Construções Ltda. and Cinexpan Indústria and Comercio de Argila Expandida Ltda. at 04/20/2014. are easy to obtain and inexpensive, with a price range of 1.60–1.85 USD kg−1 and 1.10 to 1.79 USD kg−1, respectively [30]. However, economic calculation should include the operating conditions as a parameter for the selection of the support material. Fernandes [31] evaluated hydrogen production in an APBR filled with EC as the support and fed with synthetic wastewater based on sucrose (2 g L−1) at 25 °C. Natural fermentation inoculation was used, and the applied HRT ranged from 0.5 to 2 h. The author reported that the fragmentation of EC throughout the process (89 days of operation) resulted in a decreased bed height and clogging of the APBR outlet, indicating some disadvantages in the use of this material. Thus, in terms of mechanical resistance, LDP gains advantage over EC being the most appropriate material for hydrogen production among the materials evaluated. To our knowledge, only two studies have investigated hydrogen production using vinasse [2] [32]. Fernandes et al. [2] used corn vinasse, and obtained a maximum hydrogen yield of 25 mmol-H2 g−1COD in batch reactors. The maximum yields obtained in our work, which were 17.6 and 18.5 mmol-H2 g−1COD for the reactors filled with EC and LDP, respectively, were slightly lower than those obtained by the other authors. Buitrón and Carvajal [32] obtained a similar yield of 16 mmol-H2 g−1-CODremoved using vinasse produced by the tequila industry. They used an initial substrate concentration of 1 g-COD L−1 and an HRT of 24 h at 35 °C. The volumetric hydrogen production values reported by these authors were 2.4 times higher than those obtained in our study. These authors evaluated the influence of temperature (25–35 °C), HRT (12 and 24 h), and the initial substrate concentration (Tequila vinasse ranging from 0.5 to 5 g-COD L−1) on hydrogen production. The authors operated a sequencing batch reactor inoculated with sludge from a brewery that had been heat treated at 104 °C for 24 h and observed no biogas production for the reactor operated at 25 °C and a HRT of 12 h. However, the maximum volumetric hydrogen production of 1.212 mL-H2 d−1 L−1 reactor and a hydrogen biogas content of 29.2 ± 8.8% were observed when the initial substrate concentration was 3 g-DQO L−1 at an HRT of 12 h and 35 °C. The differences from our results could be explained by the authors' use of an initial tequila vinasse concentration of only 3 g-COD L−1, which was ten times lower than the concentration used in our study."
19,Effect of the support material on the composition of intermediate products,"3.3 Effect of the support material on the composition of intermediate products Despite the variations in hydrogen production, the main fermentation products observed during the entire operation of the reactors were acetic, butyric, and propionic acids regardless of the support material used in the reactor. There was no clear relationship between hydrogen production and VFA concentration (Table 5 ); the reactors filled with Ch and PC, both with low hydrogen production, yielded the highest concentrations of acetic acid (AcH) and butyric acid (BuH). The preferred routes for hydrogen production are shown in Equations (2) and (3) [33]. (2) AcH production – C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 (3) BuH production – C6H12O6 → CH3CH2CH2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 In the reactors filled with EC and LDP, hydrogen production by the type of fermentation associated with acetic/butyric acid (at pH 5.6) was also dominant. Furthermore, even at pH values above 4.5, the type of fermentation associated with acetic acid and ethanol (EtOH) was assumed to contribute to the simultaneous production of acetic acid, ethanol, H2, and CO2, as shown in Equation (4) [34]. (4) EtOH and AcH production – C6H12O6 + H2O → 2H2 + 2CO2 + C2H4O2 + C2H6O Another metabolic pathway observed was propionic acid (PrH) production. According to the stoichiometric Equation (5) proposed by Antonopoulou et al. [33], propionic acid production is unfavorable for hydrogen production because two moles of hydrogen are consumed for every mole of propionic acid produced, which contributed to the low hydrogen production values. (5) PrH production – C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O In the reactors filled with particles of Ch and PC, high concentrations of VFAs of commercial interest were produced despite the low hydrogen production (Table 5). VFA concentration values for the APBR were similar to those reported by Bengtsson et al. [35]. These authors evaluated the production of VFA in continuous fermentation systems fed with cheese whey wastewater with a pH of 5.2 and an HRT of 48 h and paper processing wastewater with a pH of 5.7 and an HRT of 48 h. However, the HRT applied in our study was almost half that applied by these authors, indicating the high potential of VFA production from sugarcane vinasse. The SCOD mass balance only considered the values for the total carbohydrate effluent and the VFA and solvent concentrations. Other soluble compounds, such as lactic acid, glycerol, and melanoidins, were not monitored, resulting in low values for the SCOD of metabolites (between 37.3% and 40.9%) in relation to the SCOD measured (Table 5)."
20,Effect of the different support materials on the microbial composition of the attached biomass,"3.4 Effect of the different support materials on the microbial composition of the attached biomass The analysis of the bacterial community by T-RFLP in samples taken from the attached biomass in the different reactors indicated that the support material selected different microbial populations (Fig. 4 ). Cluster analysis based on the Jaccard index with the presence and absence of peaks revealed two groups. The first group considered the communities from the reactors with low hydrogen production (Ch and PC) and yielded a similarity of 38%. This branch displayed similarities of 35% and 18% with the microbial communities from the reactors filled with EC and LDP, respectively. The low similarity values among the samples from the reactors confirm the influence of different support materials on the selection of microorganisms."
21,Effect of the support material on biofilm formation,"3.5 Effect of the support material on biofilm formation Biofilm analysis of samples taken at the end of the operation using SEM also revealed that the support material directly influenced the biofilm structure developed in the reactors (Fig. 5 ). Agglomerate bacilli and flagellated cells were observed on the surfaces of the Ch and PC, indicating the possible stabilization process of biofilm formation, which is the last stage of biofilm colonization, as suggested by van Loodstrecht et al. [36]. Conversely, a biofilm structure in the intermediate stage of development was observed on the LDP where cell membrane structures such as fibril and polymer were observed increasing the interaction between membrane cells and the solid surface, thereby enhancing the irreversible attachment of microorganisms onto the support [36]."
22,Discussion about the instability of hydrogen production,"3.6 Discussion about the instability of hydrogen production Although support material had strongly influenced hydrogen production in APBR, the production of hydrogen was not maintained for a long term in any of the reactors tested. Three different analyses were performed to explain this result: 1 – the quantification of genes associated with hydrogen production by Clostridium in samples taken over time; 2 – microbial composition analysis using 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes in samples taken during periods of high and low hydrogen production; and 3 – hydrodynamics assays to determine changes in the HRT after biomass growth. Such analyses were performed only for the reactors filled with LDP and EC, which presented the highest hydrogen production. Samples for molecular analysis using real-time PCR and 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes were collected from the feed zone where biomass was accumulated and from five sampling points distributed along the bed zone of the APBR (suspended biomass). A compiled sample of all of the subsamples was used for the analysis. The results from the analysis 1 indicated a decrease in the number of copies of Fe-hydrogenase genes in the DNA extracted from the biomass of reactors filled with EC and LDP over time (Fig. 6 ), suggesting that the community was enriched in microorganisms without this enzyme. This result was confirmed by the results obtained from the second analysis. 16S rRNA 454-pyrosequence analysis was performed with samples taken from the APBR filled with LDP during a period of high hydrogen production (day 10) and during a period without hydrogen production (day 30). More than 5000 reads were obtained for each sample. The reads were classified into 7 phylogenetic groups according to the RDP pipeline: Coriobacteriales, Bifidobacteriales, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, Rhodospirillales, and Burkholderiales (Table 6 ). There was a clear shift from a hydrogen-producing microbial community in the sample taken at day 10 to a community rich in non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms in the sample taken at day 30. The phylum Firmicutes (77.1%) was dominant in the sample taken during the period of high hydrogen production (day 10), whereas the phylum Proteobacteria (70.4%) was dominant in the period without hydrogen production (day 30). The reads with a relative abundance greater than 10% of the total reads were classified in the Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and Burkhoderiales families, suggesting that these organisms were the predominant microorganisms in the system. Organisms affiliated with the Clostridium and Pectinatus genera were dominant in the sample associated with hydrogen production (day 10). According to the 454-pyrosequence analysis, the relative abundance of organisms from Clostridium genus was rather low at both the beginning and end of the reactor operation, with values of 12.8% and 5.3%, respectively. These low levels of abundance may be associated with an inoculation process and operational conditions that did not encourage the selection and maintenance of potential hydrogen-producing microorganisms in the system. On the other hand, members of the Veillonellaceae family were dominant (60.7%) during the high-hydrogen-production period based on the sample taken at day 10. According to Hung et al. [37], members of this family may play a role in hydrogen production, consumption, and competition; thus, deserves attention in future research. Moreover, Pectinatus and Megasphaera (organisms from Veillonellaceae family), have been observed in other hydrogen production reactors and associated with low hydrogen yields [38]. According to our results, organisms from the genus Pectinatus were dominant (54.1%) at the beginning and not dominant (3.1%) at the end of the reactor operation. Therefore, its presence could explain the low hydrogen production rates (211.3 mL-H2 d−1) and low hydrogen yields (0.64 mol-H2 mol−1 total carbohydrates) in the APBR filled with LDP. The proportion of reads affiliated with different genera known to be lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAPB) was increased in the sample from the low-hydrogen-production period (day 30) compared to in the sample from the high-hydrogen-production period (day 10). In particular, the reads affiliated with the Lactobacillus genus increased from 1.9% to 11.1%. There is disagreement in the literature about these microorganisms in hydrogen-producing systems. Some authors have proposed that LAPB may be associated with the production of small amounts of hydrogen by medium acidification [39], whereas others have proposed that substrate competition between LAPB and hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) leads to system instability [40] and the inhibition of hydrogen production [41]. Ohnishi et al. [40] observed lactic acid consumption during continuous hydrogen production. Lactic acid was not measured in our study; thus, whether lactic acid was produced or consumed is unknown. The role of LAPB in hydrogen producing reactors must be clarified. An increase in the proportion of the reads affiliated with the Burkholderiales family was unexpectedly detected in the sample taken during the period of low hydrogen production. Sequences affiliated with this order have been reported in studies of freshwater, soils, and bioreactors. These microorganisms are known as non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms and are considered efficient in organic matter mineralization under aerobic conditions [42]. Members of this family have also been detected in other hydrogen-producing systems, and their presence has been associated with growth under microaerophilic conditions. Unidentified sequences from Burkholderiales were detected in a phototrophic hydrogen-producing reactor in which acetic acid and butyric acid were used as the carbon source [43]. Thus, these organisms could be associated with growth in microaerophilic conditions. This statement can be supported based on Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) measurement carried out in the last 10 days of APBR operation. The ORP values were 55.7 ± 23 mV, indicating that the APBR operation was at times anoxic and at other times aerobic. In a third experiment, we studied the changes produced in the up-flow regime of the APBR with different supports materials. Experiments were performed at the beginning and at the end of the reactor operation (i.e., without and with biomass, respectively) based on a theoretical HRT of 24 h. The maximum experimental error was 3.2%. The actual average HRT value obtained from hydrodynamic assays at the beginning and end of operation were 24.3 and 20.9 h, respectively. Further, based on an analysis of the experimental curves fitted to a uniparametric model for the representation of the reactor flow regime (N-CSTR in series), as proposed by Levenspiel [44], the biomass overgrowth changed the flow regime in all reactors from a plug-flow regime to a nearly complete stirred tank reactor regime. This change was more pronounced in the reactor with the LDP (Table 7 ). The approximately 3.5 h decrease in the HRT and the flow regime changes were associated with a loss of working volume in the reactor and were attributed to the generation of biomass in a short period of time (30 days). The low C/N ratio of 32.5 based on the TOC, in the feed could cause this excess of biomass production and a decrease in the hydrogen production [45,46]. The COD mass balance was calculated for the various reactors to identify the direction of energy flow in the process and to validate the reliability of the data. The total COD concentrations in the influent and effluent, the equivalent CODs for hydrogen biogas (8 g-COD g−1-H2 at 25 °C), and the attached and settled biomass concentrations in the effluent (1.42 g-COD g−1-VSS) were calculated, as shown in Equation (6). (6) COD mass balance ( % ) = ( ( SCOD effluent ( gCOD .d − 1 ) + H 2 ( gCOD .d − 1 ) + VSS effluent ( gCOD .d − 1 ) + VSS attached ( gCOD .d − 1 ) + VSS feed zone ( gCOD .d − 1 ) / TCOD influent ( gCOD .d − 1 ) ) ) The products detected by the analytical methods represented between 76.4% and 91.4% of the total COD measured, and the hydrogen production and generated biomass in the reactors comprised approximately 0.2% and 19.7% of the mass balance, respectively. Although the suspended biomass was observed in the feed zone, 97.6% of the biomass was attached to the support materials in the bed zone, indicating that the APBR were operated as attached biomass reactors (Table S1). Considering the results of all three experiments, the microaerophilic conditions in the reactors were assumed to inhibit the growth of hydrogen-producing microorganisms from the Clostridiales order and to favor the growth of non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms from the Burkholderiales order, especially from the Comamonadaceae family which quite possibly was already in the inoculum (produced by natural fermentation of the vinasse). Therefore, according to Sadaie et al. [47], the ideal configuration for hydrogen-producing reactors should consider dissolved oxygen removal from the influent to avoid the development of microaerophilic bacteria. Hung et al. [37] noted that this task would be extremely difficult to accomplish due to the low HRT applied in hydrogen-producing systems and their viable operation size. The excess nitrogen, indicated by a low C/N ratio of 32.5 based on the TOC, contributed to the generation of large amounts of biomass in the reactors, which decreased the reactor working volume and the real HRT and changed the flow regime [45]. Therefore, the combined effect of the microaeration conditions and low C/N ratios severely affected the APBR operation, leading to a decay in hydrogen production. Although the problems caused by excess biomass can be mitigated by the periodic discharge of sludge, the microaeration of the reactor can only be avoided with the appropriate design of storage tanks, pipes, and pumping devices."
23,Operational strategy for continuous and long-term hydrogen production,"3.7 Operational strategy for continuous and long-term hydrogen production Based on the results archived in this study (most of them reveled by the several microbiological analysis techniques applied). We decided to operate the APBR under thermophilic condition (55 °C) to decrease both the biomass yield and oxygen solubility, i.e., decrease the negative interference of the low C/N ratio and microaerophilic conditions, respectively. This represented a great and rational option for sugarcane vinasse that is discharged at high temperatures (85–90 °C) and thus, not requiring energy input. We successfully demonstrated that thermophilic APBR filled with LDP can be used for continuous hydrogen production using raw sugarcane vinasse as a substrate [48]. In the cited study, a high OLR of 84.2 kg-COD m−3 d−1 was determined, predicting a maximum volumetric hydrogen production (VHP) and yield of 1,117.2 mL-H2 d−1 L− 1 reactor and 2.4 mol-H2 mol−1 total carbohydrates, respectively. Later on, the hydrogen production and yield values were maximized to 2,283.7 mL-H2 d−1 reactor and 3.7 mol-H2 mol−1total carbohydrates, respectively. We also demonstrated that thermophilic fermentation was able to decrease the contamination by autochthonous non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms (Burkholderiales) usually present in the inflow [49]."
24,Conclusions,"Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The mesophilic bio-hydrogen production from raw sugarcane vinasse in APBR was quite unstable and ephemeral, lasting no more than 15 days. • The support material had a strong influence on the selection of microbial populations, being LDP the most appropriate material for hydrogen production among the materials evaluated; • Although the hydrogen yield was low, sugarcane vinasse displayed potential for VFA production; • The mesophilic process was unstable due to the excess nitrogen in association with the microaeration conditions in the systems, which may promote the overgrowth of non-hydrogen-producing microorganisms observed at day 30 of operation by 454-pyrosequence analysis, affecting hydrogen production and causing the APBR operation to fail. • Although long-term hydrogen production could not be obtained in mesophilic APBR processing raw sugarcane vinasse, operating strategies can be applied to overcome this problem as periodic discharge of excess biomass, adoption of technologies to avoid microaeration of the reactor or even operation of two reactors in parallel, which can be operated in lagged and short cycles of, for example, 15 days."
