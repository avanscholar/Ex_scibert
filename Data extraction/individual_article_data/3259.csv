0,Introduction,"In recent years, metallic nanoparticles distributed in polymer composites are very interested in their wonderful characteristics that can be obtained from such compositions because of the significant proportion of the electrical or antibacterial activity of metals [1–4]. Therefore, the presence of nanoparticles that establish a polymer structure may induce abnormal behavior for synthesized nanocomposites, such as; optical, structural, electrical, and antibacterial properties [5–7]. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is known to be a linear polymer with many properties such as; strong reactivity, chemical strength, and high thermal stability [8–10]. Its conductivity was accepted by a broad arrangement of PEO combined with non-crystalline co-polymer. The ether group O duplication allows PEO to be associated with a wide spectrum of metal ions. In general, because of its polar existence, it has the ability to create versatile composites by different solvents. Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) considers a semi-crystalline cross-linked polymer containing hydroxyl groups (O–H) that have an excellent mechanical, electrical, antibacterial, and thermal efficiency [11,12]. It has been recommended for various uses, including electrical and antibacterial utilizations related to its high nontoxicity, water-solubility, degradability, reduction ability, good charge storage capacity, great optical properties, and high dielectric constant [13,14]. According to the function group with an ion electron pair which establishes metallic nanoparticles in its matrix related to the presence of carbonyl groups, PVA is an effective reducing agent for metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) [15,16]. With many potential uses, such as electrical applications, polymeric nanocomposites have drawn considerable interest [17]. Polymer bending is used as an easy way to manipulate new composites with unique properties under reaction conditions [18,19]. In this case, polymeric material matrix connect with each other and the resultant behavior of the blend is fully connected to its blends, solubilization ratio, boiling pattern with respect to the doped nanoparticles distributed inside the system. The hydrogen bonding inside polymer blend structures consider the reason of creation of classification of the blend; thus, composite contains PVA and PEO will enhance chemical stability, electrochemical operation, etc. [20–22]. When polymer blend exposed to gamma radiation, some of the chemical features of polymer blends are impaired, such as; optical, structural, electrical, and antibacterial features and these because that the energy that come from gamma which make broken to cross-linking [23–25]. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) recently gained considerable prominence between metallic oxides due to their versatile uses from medical to electrical [26,27]. Different techniques have been suggested for producing CuONPs, but Laser Ablation is known to be a highly efficient technique for high-impact extraction of nanoparticles from its bulk form [28,29]. Laser ablation route supplies strong distribution of copper oxide nanoparticles across PEO/PVA blend solution. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of gamma radiation exposed to nanocomposite of PEO/PVA/CuONPs on the optical, morphological, electrical conductivity, and antibacterial activity properties."
1,Materials and method,
2,Materials,2.1 Materials Polyethylene Oxide (M.W. ≈ 40 kg/mol) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (M.W. ≈ 72 kg/mol) were bought from ACROS.
3,Synthesis of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites,2.2 Synthesis of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites 0.5 gm of both PEO and PVA were added to vessel contains 50 ml of Ultra-Pure Water and stirred continuously at 50 °C for 6 h until a homogenous viscous PEO/PVA blend solution was formed. Nanosecond laser was incident on a pure copper plate placed in the bottom of the vessel contains a certain amount of the synthesized PEO/PVA blend solution in order to the production of CuONPs that embedded in PEO/PVA blend solution by laser ablation route. The synthesized PEO/PVA/CuONPs solution has been cast in a Petri dish and dried in oven at 40 °C for 3 days.
4,Gamma radiation to PEO/PVA/CuONPs film,"2.3 Gamma radiation to PEO/PVA/CuONPs film The synthesized nanocomposites were divided to PEO/PVA/CuONPs films. The nanocomposites were irradiated at different doses; 10 kGrays, 30 kGrays and 50 kGrays. The source of gamma was Indian 60Co gamma cell (2000 Ci) by a dose rate of 150 rad s−1. PEO/PVA/CuONPs films."
5,Characterization techniques,"2.4 Characterization techniques Fourier transform infrared analysis (FT-IR) has been studied within the region: 4000–400 cm−1 via (PerkinElmer 2000) spectrometer. UV–Visible spectroscopy has been studied by JASCO (V-570) spectrophotometer in the range: 190–700 nm. Photoluminescence studies have been evaluated via (Jasco, FP-6500, Japan) spectrofluorometer. The morphology has been investigated via (Quanta FE-SEM 250, USA). AC conductivity studies have been investigated by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) type (concept 40) Novocontrol within 0.1 Hz–20 MHz frequency. The antibacterial behavior has been conducted against both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) at the same parameters. 5 mg/ml of each nanocomposites have been seeded in Petri dishes contain agar media and the Petri dishes have been incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The antibacterial activity has been evaluated by recording the inhibition zone. The last step has been repeated three times to obtain the positive and negative deviation. The antibacterial activity percent (%) has been obtained via the equation [11]: (1) % Activity Index = Zone of inhibition by test compound ( diameter ) Zone of inhibition by standard ( diameter ) × 100"
6,Results and discussion,
7,FT-IR analysis,"3.1 FT-IR analysis FT-IR spectra of the prepared PEO/PVA blend, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at different doses was obtained in Fig. 1 . For PEO/PVA blend, the band at 2881 cm−1 may be attributed to the symmetric-stretching of C–H refers to PEO. The band at 839 cm−1 is related to C–O stretching of PEO [30]. The appearance of band at about 1638 cm−1 related to the stretching-vibration of CO, while the band at 1069 cm−1 was due to the stretching mode of –C–O–C [31]. The bands at about 3198 up to 3331 cm−1 might be related to the vibrational mode of O–H because of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The bands at 1728 and 1033 cm−1 could be attributed to CO and C–O groups of PVA, the most distinctive bands of PVA [32]. For PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites, the filler CuONPs induce significant modifications in its functional groups of PVA/PEO related changes in the bands. The intensity and broadness of the bands at 2880 cm−1 and 1110 cm−1 have been enhanced by the doping CuONPs in PEO/PVA blend. By PEO/PVA/CuONPs films exposed to various doses, obvious changes were obtained in bands location and its intensities. The intensity of bands at 1652 cm−1, 1098 cm−1, and 2881 cm−1 was decreased by enhancing gamma dose from 10 kGrays to 50 kGrays that assigned to the complexation between PEO/PVA blend and CuONPs. The previous results confirm the modifications in PEO/PVA/CuONPs films exposed to gamma doses."
8,Optical properties,"3.2 Optical properties UV–Vis spectra of the synthesized PEO/PVA composite, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at different doses was obtained in Fig. 2 . UV–Vis spectrum of PEO/PVA blend showed a peak at about 210 nm, which attributed to n → π∗ electronic-transitions. UV–Vis spectrum of PEO/PVA/CuONPs show a peak at about 279 nm, which has been attributed to characteristic peak of CuONPs [33]. As the absorbed dose rises, the intensity of the SPR peak has improved, showing the influence of quantum confinement [34]. UV–Vis spectrum of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at various doses show change the position of peak at 279 nm toward higher wavelength. This shift approves the influences of gamma radiation when the energy gap changed that confirm the interaction between PEO/PVA and CuONPs. The absorption coefficients α of the synthesized PEO/PVA/CuONPs and PEO/PVA/CuONPs films exposed to gamma radiation with various doses was shown in Fig. 3 and might be investigated by Beer–Lambert's equation [35]: (2) α ( λ ) = 2.303 d A The values of α for PEO/PVA/CuONPs film is 4.69 eV, and 4.27 eV for PEO/PVA/CuONPs film exposed to 10 kGrays dose. As the dose increased, the values of α were decreased to reach 2.91 for PEO/PVA/CuONPs films exposed to 50 kGrays dose."
9,Photoluminescence studies (PL),"3.3 Photoluminescence studies (PL) Photoluminescence (PL) has been conducted to investigate the optical properties of the synthesized PEO/PVA composite, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at various doses and to show the interaction occurs by filling via CuONPs and the influences of various gamma doses on the synthesized PEO/PVA/CuONPs composite. PL spectra of the synthesized PEO/PVA composite, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at various doses was obtained in Fig. 4 . PL spectrum of PEO/PVA/CuONPs before exposed to gamma radiation showed decreases in the intensity of the photoluminescence band. PL spectrum of PEO/PVA/CuONPs irradiated at different doses showed continuous decreasing in the intensity of the Photoluminescence band. Also, photoluminescence of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposite obtains the peak at 415 nm with more broadness that could be assigned to the deep-level structural defects that introduced via CuONPs [36]. The intensity value of Photoluminescence band was increased with increase the dose from 10 kGrays to 50 kGrays. The previous results approve that the radiation makes an enhancement in the PL intensity of PEO/PVA/CuONPs composite. The photoluminescence spectra showed red shift in the peak at 415 nm–421 nm that observed by increasing the absorbed dose which could be assigned to the quantum confinement effect. PL spectra may be indicating that the gamma radiation reorders the delocalized n-electron system of PEO/PVA/CuONPs composite. The previous results of optical studies in photoluminescence and ultraviolet–visible suggest the using of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposite for optical, photonics and optoelectronics applications."
10,Morphological investigations,"3.4 Morphological investigations FE-SEM obtains the surface modification affected by various doses of radiation. Fig. 5 obtain FE-SEM photos of the synthesized PEO/PVA blend, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at different doses; 10 kGrays and 50 kGrays. The surface morphology of PEO/PVA blend without doping by CuONPs in Fig. 5a obtain smooth and homogeneous morphology that confirm the excellent miscibility between PVA and PEO. The morphology of PEO/PVA/CuONPs that obtained in Fig. 5b was a good distribution of small number of CuONPs on the surface of PEO/PVA blend that approve the excellent complexation between PEO/PVA and CuONPs. Fig. 5c show FE-SEM photos of PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at doses 50 kGrays. For PEO/PVA/CuONPs sample that exposed to 50 kGrays in Fig. 5c, the uniform distribution of copper oxide nanoparticles has been decreased and the agglomeration has been increased. The previous results approve that the gamma radiation induced enhancement to PEO/PVA/CuONPs films."
11,AC electrical conductivity,"3.5 AC electrical conductivity 3.5.1 Dielectric analysis The plots of both dielectric constant ε ′ and the dielectric loss ε ″ in dependence of frequency for the synthesized PEO/PVA composite, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at different doses were obtained in Fig. 6 . The figure showed the small values of ε ′ and ε ″ for PEO/PVA sample then these values have been raised by the doping of CuONPs inside PEO/PVA blend and by PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at various doses these values were increased more. The values of ε ′ and ε ″ were high in low frequency then it decreased to a constant values. The previous results might be assigned to polarization effects and the high contribution of charge accumulation in the synthesized nanocomposites which exposed to gamma due to the influences of interfacial polarization on dielectric permittivity. 3.5.2 Conductivity analysis The plots of both real σac' and imaginary σac'' part in dependence of frequency for the synthesized PEO/PVA composite, PEO/PVA/CuONPs, and PEO/PVA/CuONPs nanocomposites irradiated at different doses were obtained in Fig. 7 . It was shown that the values of σac' are very small at low frequencies, which begin to raise with raising the frequencies as obtained in Fig. 7a. The previous results might be attributed to space-charge polarization [37]. When PEO/PVA/CuONPs film exposed to various doses of gamma, the values of σac' were raised at high frequencies. It has been shown that the higher value of σac' located at the high doses. The values of σac'' are very small at low frequencies then begin to decrease by raising the frequencies as obtained in Fig. 7b. The values of σac'' have been decreased as the dose raised at high frequencies."
12,Antibacterial activity,"3.6 Antibacterial activity The antimicrobial behavior of the synthesized PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at different doses was tested via agar plate technique [38]. According to Fig. 8 , the activity index was obtained, it was obtained that the increasing in the dose of gamma makes an increase in the activity index. It has been shown by the figure that, E-coli has been most affected via the dose of gamma while S. aureus has been the lowest. The previous results indicate that PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at different doses have a possible antibacterial application."
13,Conclusion,"CuONPs doped in PEO/PVA blend was prepared via laser ablation route. PEO/PVA/CuONPs films were irradiated at different doses. FT-IR analysis confirms that PEO/PVA/CuONPs film has been affected by gamma doses. UV/vis results confirmed the doped of CuONPs in PEO/PVA blend. The presence of SPR band at 279 nm, which shifted to higher wavelengths by raising the absorbed dose. Both ε ′ and ε ″ values were raised with raise the absorbed dose, but also decreasing its values reaching the constant values. The values of σac' were raised as the absorbed dose raised. The current research suggests that PEO/PVA/CuONPs films irradiated at different doses have a possible electrical applications antibacterial applications against S. aureus and E- c oli."
