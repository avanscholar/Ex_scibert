0,Introduction,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer gained by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc)(S.H. Bossmann et al., 2001b; Sun et al., 2017). PVA is regularly employed in textile industry as an original material for the production of PVA fabric. At present, PVA is produced in more than 20 countries and regions, the world total production of PVA material is about 930 kilotons every year(Ye et al., 2017). It is fundamentally considered that PVA material is a high-molecular polymer with amusing properties such as high water soluble ability, Low manufacturing cost, and excellent physical properties. PVA has such excellent properties, so it is widely used in industrial production and daily life, resulting in a large number of PVA materials, and the PVA fabric is a very important part. Now many countries are vigorously developing nuclear power plants, nuclear power is a clean energy, it plays an important role in solving the global energy crisis. PVA fabric as the main fabric of nuclear power plant uniforms, there is a huge amount of consumption every year. Therefore, the post-treatment of uniforms has become a big environment problem. Over the past few decades, most of the treatment methods are to solidify nuclear waste, temporary existence in nuclear power plant in waste repository. There is no country has been able to find a method to dispose radioactive nuclear waste safely and permanently so far. In order to realize the effective treatment of nuclear power plant uniforms, the degradation method of PVA fabric should be studied first. However, it is usually hard to dispose PVA fabric and to transform into no harm substances, for example H2O and CO2; hence, PVA fabric generally have a bad effect to the ecosystem in the environment(Wei et al., 2018). The reported bio-technologies do not provide an efficient method to treat PVA because most microorganisms do not have the capacity to degrade PVA fabric(Ye et al., 2017). Based on this situation, there is an increasing number in the research of degrading PVA. In the past 25 years, a new methods called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)(Chu et al., 2004; Behnajady et al., 2007; Pignatello et al., 2007; Kos et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020), for disposing organic pollutants in wastewater, has drew great attention. It is reported that AOPs are basically based on the formation of hydroxyl radical (•OH), that can degrade a large amount of organic pollutants rapidly and without selectively. Among them, H2O2 has been used as an effective accessory ingredient to generate •OH for dealing with wastewater in environment that includes organic pollutants. These treat methods generate •OH in different ways, can meet different processing requirements. Therefore, a considerable number of experimental studies on the degradation of PVA have been implemented. Most of these researches have pay attention to electrocoagulation(Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018), biological degradation(Chiellini et al., 2003; Bharathiraja et al., 2013; Marusincova et al., 2013; Bian et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020), adsorption process(Chou, 2010; Hsu et al., 2011), chemical oxidation process(Song et al., 2018), and photo-catalytic degradation(S.H. Bossmann et al., 2001a; Giroto et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2011, 2013; Hamad et al., 2016). Although these studies have achieved some achievements, on the other hand, such as electrocoagulation will generate a lot of energy consumption, biological degradation need a long reaction time for obtaining high degrading efficiency of PVA. Therefore, it is necessary to find a simple, efficient and economical treatment method. As mentioned above, although people conducted some researches on the degradation of PVA, however, there are few studies on the degradation of PVA fabric. Because PVA fabric may contain impurities such as grease and oil after use, it will increase the difficulty to dispose PVA fabric. Besides, researches in Fenton process have never stopped, when dealing with different organic pollutants, such as PVA fabric, it remains a chemical challenge in practice. The solubility of PVA fabric in water is determined by the degree of polymerization and alcoholysis, the higher the alcoholysis degree, the worse the water solubility. Therefore, for PVA fabrics with different degrees of polymerization and alcoholysis, degradation tests need to be carried out under different experimental conditions. According to this situation, in this paper, the degradation of PVA fabrics via Fenton process was investigated. The research is on the influence of H2O2 dosage, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2, initial pH value, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The PVA fabric was dissolved in deionized water first and then configured into a mass fraction of 5%. PVA fabric aqueous solution was employed in all degradation experiments, in which the reaction kinetics was studied along the reaction time."
1,Experimental,
2,Experimental procedure in a laboratory-scale reactor,"2.1 Experimental procedure in a laboratory-scale reactor A sketch of the self-assembly experiment reactor is shown in Fig. 1 . Degradation of PVA fabric and PVA (1750) via Fenton reaction was carried out in the reactor including 0.5 L of PVA fabric aqueous solution with a mass fraction of 5%. The reactor consists of a DF-101 s magnetic agitator with constant temperature heating of collector type which connected to a power supply. The degradation of PVA fabric and PVA (1750) reacted in a three-necked, round-bottomed flask, hydrogen peroxide and ferrous nitrate solution were added slowly during the reaction and saturated clear limewater is to collect the carbon dioxide produced in the reaction. After the reaction, centrifuged the reaction solution, and took the supernatant for testing and analysis, and the iron sludge was properly treated to prevent environmental pollution. The experimental procedure involved the production of Fe(NO3)2 aqueous solution and PVA fabric and PVA (1750) with the desired concentrations. The preparation process of Fe(NO3)2 is shown as Eq. (1): (1) F e S O 4 · 7 H 2 O + B a ( N O 3 ) 2 = F e ( N O 3 ) 2 + B a S O 4 ↓ + 7 H 2 O The PVA fabric and PVA (1750) solution was produced by gradualness dissolving definite quality of PVA fabric and PVA (1750) in a 1000 mL glass beaker with stirring at temperature of 95 °C. The aqueous solution was then added in deionized water, to gain the required concentration of PVA fabric and PVA (1750). After putting the PVA fabric and PVA (1750) solution into the reactor, the pH was adjusted to the desired value. After the reaction, adjusted the pH value of the reaction solution to 10–11, after the complete precipitation of iron ions, the supernatant was centrifuged and tested. In all degradation experiments carried out in this study, H2O2 dosage, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2, initial pH value, reaction temperature, and reaction time were kept at the required values. A single-factor influences experiment was employed to evaluate the impact of these factors on the degrading efficiency of PVA fabric and PVA (1750). In this experiment, UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer was used to measure the degrading efficiency of PVA fabric and PVA (1750) at the wavelength of 645 nm in the reaction process. The degrading efficiency of PVA fabric and PVA (1750) was calculated via Eq. (2). (2) The degrading efficiency = C 0 − C t C 0 × 100 % where C 0 is the concentration of initial PVA fabric aqueous solution, C t is the concentration of PVA fabric aqueous solution at time t (min). The polyvinyl alcohol fabric was obtained from Baohualin industrial development co. LTD with an alcoholysis degree of 99%. Polyvinyl alcohol (1750), Hydrogen peroxide (25%−28%), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4•7H2O), nitrate barium (Ba(NO3)2), iodine (I2), potash iodide (KI), boric acid, sodium hydroxide, concentrated nitric acid were obtained from Sinopharm group chemical reagent co. LTD. The PVA fabric aqueous solution was prepared using deionized water. The Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC, Waters 1525EF) was obtained from Waters, UV-1800 PC spectrophotometer was bought from Shanghai MAPADA instrument co., LTD, the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOC, SHIMADZU TOC-V CPH) were obtained from SHIMADZU."

4,Degrading efficiency of PVA fabric under different reaction conditions,"3.1 Degrading efficiency of PVA fabric under different reaction conditions Fig. 2 (a) shows the PVA fabric degrading efficiency via Fenton process using various H2O2 dosage at the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 of 10, initial pH value of 4, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and reaction time of 25 min. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the PVA fabric degrading efficiency with the H2O2 dosage of 0.5 g/mL, 0.7 g/mL, 0.9 g/mL, 1.1 g/mL, 1.3 g/mL, and 1.5 g/mL were 96.73%, 97.82%, 98.56%, 99.35%, 99.96%, and 99.96%, respectively. These results reveal that the PVA fabric degrading efficiency increased with H2O2 dosage from 0.5 g/L to 1.3 g/L mainly because more •OH was formed. However, the degrading efficiency not decreased as the H2O2 dosage was increased to 1.5 g/L. When H2O2 dosage is less than 1.3 g/L, H2O2 generates •OH under the catalysis of Fe2+, •OH degrades the PVA fabric. When the amount of H2O2 is 1.3 g/L, Fe2+ and H2O2 can react completely in reaction solution. Therefore, further increasing H2O2 dosage has no effect on the removal of PVA fabric. Fig. 2(b) displays the effect of the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 on PVA fabric degrading efficiency. To investigate the effect of the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 on the degradation of PVA fabric in aqueous solutions via Fenton process, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were chosen to conduct degradation experiments, an H2O2 dosage of 1.3 g/mL, initial pH value of 4, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and reaction time of 25 min. The PVA fabric degrading efficiency after 25 min at the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were 94.85%, 97.53%, 99.56%, 99.96%, 99.96%, and 99.96%, respectively. It is clear that the PVA fabric degrading efficiency after 25 min increased as the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 increased. As the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 increased to 10, the PVA degrading efficiency reached to the maximum value of 99.96%. When the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 increased from 10 to 12, the PVA fabric degrading efficiency remain unchanged. This is because Fe2+ plays a catalytic role in the degradation process of PVA fabric. When the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 was less than 10, more and more •OH is produced in reaction solution, PVA fabric was gradually decomposed by the oxidation of •OH. When the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 was greater than 10, Fe2+ was completely consumed in reaction solution, and the degradation efficiency did not increase. In order to test the impact of initial pH value on the degradation of PVA fabric, experiments were carried out at initial pH values of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Fig. 2(c) displays the results of the PVA fabric degrading efficiency was 97.56%, 99.35%, 99.96%, 98.64%, 96.31%, and 95.47% respectively at the initial pH of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 that were obtained using an H2O2 dosage of 1.3 g/L, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 of 10, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and reaction time of 25 min. The PVA fabric degrading efficiency at different initial pH value followed the order pH 2 < pH 3 < pH 4 > pH 5 > pH 6 > pH 7. The highest PVA fabric degrading efficiency was 99.96%, which was achieved at pH 4. This effect is caused by the fact that the initial pH value was greater than 4 will inhibited the generation of hydroxyl free radical•OH, leading to the decrease of PVA fabric degrading efficiency. Under neutral or alkaline conditions, the decomposition of H2O2 will be accelerated, and a part of H2O2 will be decomposed into H2O and CO2. Fig. 2(d) presents the influence of reaction temperature on the degrading efficiency of PVA fabric via Fenton process at an H2O2 dosage of 1.3 g/L, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 of 10, initial pH value of 4, and reaction time of 25 min. As presented in Fig. 2(d), the PVA fabric degrading efficiency obtained using reaction temperature of 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C were 94.85%, 98.36%, 99.65%, 99.96%, 97.48%, and 96.57%, respectively. With the reaction temperature increased from 30 °C to 50 °C, the PVA fabric degrading efficiency increased from 94.85% to 99.96%. But with the reaction temperature increased continuously, the PVA fabric degrading efficiency began to decrease from the maximum value of 99.96% to 96.57%. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that with the reaction temperature increased from 30 °C to 60 °C, the molecular activity in reaction solution increases and the reaction rate increases, promoting the degradation of PVA fabric. With the reaction temperature continued to rise, part of H2O2 was decomposed into H2O and O2, leading to the insufficient of the amount of hydroxyl free radical •OH involved in the degradation of PVA fabric, resulting in a decrease in PVA fabric degrading efficiency. It is indispensable to evaluate the degrading efficiency of PVA fabric on the reaction time from a practical view. Fig. 2(e) reveals the effect of reaction time on the PVA fabric degrading efficiency at an H2O2 dosage of 1.3 g/L, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 of 10, initial pH value of 4, and reaction temperature of 60 °C. As shown in Fig. 2(e), the PVA fabric degrading efficiency obtained using a reaction time of 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, and 35 min was 93.54%, 96.75%, 98.32%, 99.96%, 99.96%, and 99.96%, respectively. With the increase of reaction time, the PVA fabric degrading efficiency showed a trend of increasing gradually. When reaching 25 min, the PVA fabric degrading efficiency reached the maximum value of 99.96%. The PVA fabric degrading efficiency was no longer changed when the reaction time continued to increase."
5,The TOC removal rate of PVA fabric under different conditions,"3.2 The TOC removal rate of PVA fabric under different conditions The TOC removal rate of PVA fabric under different H2O2 dosages (a), the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 (b), initial pH values (c), reaction temperatures (d), reaction times (e) via Fenton process is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) reveals the effect of H2O2 dosage on TOC removal rate of PVA fabric at the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 of 10, initial pH value of 4, reaction temperature of 60 °C, and reaction time of 25 min. The TOC removal rate were 96.55%, 97.53%, 98.35%, 99.54%, 99.97%, and 99.97%, respectively at H2O2 dosage of 0.5 g/mL, 0.7 g/mL, 0.9 g/mL, 1.1 g/mL, 1.3 g/mL, and 1.5 g/mL. Fig. 3(b) displays the TOC removal rate were 96.74%, 98.13%, 99.05%, 99.97%, 99.97%, and 99.97% at the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Fig. 3(c) demonstrates the TOC removal rate were 98.35%, 99.56%, 99.97%, 99.45%, 99.85%, and 97.89% at initial pH values of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Fig. 3(d) exhibits the TOC removal rate were 95.68%, 97.56%, 99.57%, 99.97%, 98.63%, and 97.25% at reaction temperature of 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C. Fig. 3(e) shows the TOC removal rate were 94.13%, 97.15%, 98.35%, 99.35%, 99.97%, and 99.97% at reaction time of 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, and 35 min. We can see that the TOC removal rate of PVA fabric reached the maximum at the condition of H2O2 dosage, the molar ratio of H2O2/Fe(NO3)2, initial pH value, reaction temperature, and reaction time to be 1.3 g/L, 10, 4, 60 °C, and 25 min, respectively, and the TOC removal rate is 99.97%. As an important index to evaluate organic pollution of water quality, TOC removal rate indicates that effective degradation of PVA fabric can be achieved via Fenton process."

Fig. 4(a), and Fig. 4(b) stand for PVA fabric aqueous solution and degradation products aqueous solution. Fig. 4(d), and Fig. 4(e) stand for PVA (1750) aqueous solution and degradation products aqueous solution. PVA fabric solution becomes clear and the viscosity-average molecular weight of PVA fabric is degraded from 130,293 to 420. The viscosity-average molecular weight of PVA (1750) is degraded from 75,034 to 390, the degrading efficiency and TOC removal rate were 99.97% and 99.95%, respectively."
7,Degradation mechanism and kinetics study,"3.4 Degradation mechanism and kinetics study The degradation mechanism of PVA fabric is shown in Eqs. (3)–(9), and Fig. 5. These results reveal that the Fenton process provided efficient degradation of PVA fabrics because of the following mechanism. hydroxyl radical •OH was generated by the activation of H2O2 by Fe2+, and directly degraded PVA fabrics in aqueous solutions(Hamad et al., 2014). (3) F e 2 + + H 2 O 2 → F e 2 + + 2 · O H (4) F e 2 + + · O H → F e 3 + + O H − (5) F e 3 + + H 2 O 2 → F e 2 + + H + + H O 2 (6) H O 2 + H 2 O 2 → O 2 + H 2 O + · O H (7) RH + OH → R + H 2 O (8) R + F e 3 + → R + + F e 2 + (9) R + + O 2 → R O O + → · · · → C O 2 + H 2 O The kinetics of the PVA fabric degradation process is an oxidation process of hydroxyl radical, the kinetics of the degradation of PVA fabric was discussed in this experiment. Eqs. (10)–(13) show the zero-order kinetic, first-order kinetic, second-order kinetic, and Chu kinetic model, respectively.(Abdel-Hamid et al., 2001; Chu et al., 2004; Behnajady et al., 2007; de Luna et al., 2013). Fig. 6 displays the zero-order kinetic, first-order kinetic, second-order kinetic, and Chu kinetic model plots of PVA fabric degradation under different reaction time. By comparing the kinetic equations and plots in the PVA fabric degradation process, we found that the PVA fabric degradation via Fenton process conforms to Chu kinetic model. (10) C 0 − C t = k t (11) ln ( C 0 C t ) = k t (12) 1 C t − 1 C 0 = k t (13) t 1 − C t C 0 = p + a t The zero-order, first-order, second-order, and Chu kinetic model data of PVA fabric degradation under different reaction time are shown in Table 1."
