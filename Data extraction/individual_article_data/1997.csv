0,Introduction,"Sulfide stress cracking (SSC) is one of the major damage phenomenons of steels in sour environment, which was first identified in the 1940s following several failures of oil and gas systems in the United States and Canada [1]. In the recent years, with the deep and ultra-deep sour wells exploitation, there is an increasing demand for materials used for downhole casing and tubing with sufficient strength and SSC resistance, but it is well known that higher strength corresponds to higher susceptibility to SSC [2,3]. When the steels are immersed in wet H2S environment, hydrogen atoms generated by the cathodic reaction will be adsorbed on the steel surface and further diffuse into the metal lattice [4]. The diffused hydrogen atoms tend to accumulate in hydrogen traps, which may result in SSC failure once the steels are subjected to applied or residual stress [5]. It has been demonstrated that SSC is one form of cracking assisted by hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [6]. Therefore, many researchers were devoted to study the mechanism of HE, trying to lower the HE susceptibility, in order to achieve high strength steels with superior SSC resistance [7–9]. It has been established that tempered martensite produced by quenching and tempering heat treatments is the best suitable microstructure for high strength steel serviced in sour environment [10,11]. During tempering process, most ferrites formed by the α′→α transformation still retain martensitic multiscale substructures (i.e. packet, block and lath) and possess relatively low dislocation density [12,13], while excess carbon solute diffuse out to form dispersed carbide precipitates which could act as irreversible hydrogen traps [7,14]. The C110 material is such a typical low-alloy tempered martensitic steel for high-strength and sour-service oil country tubular goods (OCTG) production and has been introduced to API Spec 5CT standard in 2011 [15,16]. Due to the optimization of alloying element contents and heat treatment processing, the C110 steel obtains a desirable combination of sufficient mechanical strength and fully SSC resistance, having a specified minimum yield strength grade of 758 MPa (110 ksi), and meeting or exceeding the SSC requirement of API Spec 5CT using NACE TM0177 test Method A [16,17]. In the past decade, C110 steel has become the preferred high strength material for casing and tubing design for sour wells over the world. It has been proven that C110 steel tubing has low corrosion and HE/SSC failure rates in H2S-containing downhole environments which generally belong to ISO 15156–2 SSC Regions 1 or 2 situations [18]. However, due to the implementation of secondary or tertiary recovery techniques involving gas lift, water injection or steam injection in old wells where productivity or pressures are uncertain, oxygen contamination may occur in downhole environment [1,19]. The corrosion behaviour of low and micro alloy steels in mixtures gas system has become a research focus, and many studies revealed the synergistic effect of H2S and O2 on corrosion damage [20–24]. Elemental sulfur (S8) has been considered to be the main cause of severe localized corrosion in oil and gas industry, and its appearance is usually related to the oxidation of sulfide species due to sour systems with O2 ingress [25–27]. Until now, there is no sight of agreement on the corrosion mechanism in H2S and O2 environment, and three main assumptions based on the formation of elemental sulfur inducing corrosion have been proposed, involving the direct contact mechanism [28], the polysulfides reduction mechanism [29] and the disproportionation mechanism [30]. On the other hand, compared with corrosion mechanism, in-depth analysis on the extent of the effect O2 on the SSC behaviour of low-alloy steels, especially for C110 steel with SSC resistance, is rarely systematically discussed in the literature. Of note, it has been suggested that dissolved O2 contamination should be avoided during H2S cracking tests [17], and some published experimental data showed that cracking behaviour was observed on C110 steel in SSC tests with trace O2 [31]. Moreover, over the past three years, dozens of fracture failures of C110 steels have happened in gas lift wells containing H2S in western oilfield in China, which was considered to be related to O2 contamination. However, the associated scientific issues such as the effect of O2 on the stability of corrosion product film and transformation of HE mechanism remain to be clarified. With above considerations in mind, the aim of the present work is to systematically investigate the cracking behaviour of C110 tubing steel during the H2S and O2-containing gas injection into solution environment. To achieve this objective, the SSC sensitivity and corrosion rate under various P H2S/P O2 ratios conditions were determined by SSC uniaxial tensile and weight loss tests, respectively. The characterization of corrosion production layers, microstructure and crack propagation were also analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Accordingly, new considerations were raised regarding the effect of O2 on the whole cracking process of sulfur resistant steel."
1,Experimental,
2,Material and solution,"2.1 Material and solution Quenched and tempered API Spec 5CT C110 tubing steel with the chemical composition of (wt%) C 0.17, Si 0.20, Mn 0.47, P 0.0055, S 0.0013, Cr 0.48, Mo 0.75, Ni 0.017, Nb 0.027, V 0.11, Ti 0.020, Cu 0.024, B 0.0031, Al 0.021 and Fe balance was used in this work. The initial microstructure of as-received sample was characterized by STEM. The STEM disc for microstructure observation was prepared using a twin-jet electropolishing apparatus in a 5 vol% perchloric acid and 95 vol% alcohol solution at −30 ℃. The Kernel average misorientation (KAM) distribution was determined by EBSD. Prior to EBSD analysis, the sample was mechanically polished and finally electrolytic polished. The EBSD measure area was scanned with a step size of 0.1 µm and a tilt angle of 70°. The test solution for SSC tests and weight loss tests was 4.96 g/L NaCl solution in order to simulate condensate water in the tubing-casing annulus of gas injection wells. The test solution was previously deaerated in a sealed vessel that is purged with high-purity N2 gas at a rate of at least 100 mL/min for at least 1 h/L of test solution."
3,SSC tests,"2.2 SSC tests The SSC tests under various P H2S/P O2 ratios conditions were performed in a H2S and O2-containing uniaxial tensile loading system which consisted of a gas mixer and three test cells using NACE TM0177 standard [17] specified proof ring as loading device, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 showed the dimensions of specimens, which were the standard uniaxial tensile specimens. All the specimens were ground to 1500# with SiC papers and then mechanically polished to obtain the mirror surface finish. For each test, triplicate specimens were placed in the test cells of proof rings, and were subjected to a constant load corresponding to 500 MPa (about 63% of actual yield strength (AYS) 794 MPa) which was the maximum service stress of C110 oil tubing used in wells with a safety factor of 1.5. After loading and sealing, the deaerated test solution was transferred to test cells and then purged by high-purity N2 once more for 2 h to ensure the absence of O2. After deaeration, high-purity H2S (gas 1) and O2 or O2 + N2 (gas 2) were separately imported into the gas mixer at certain and stable flow rates controlled by two high precise SIERRA Smart-Trak 100 digital mass flow controllers. Then, the homogeneous mixture of H2S and O2 or O2 + N2 flowed from gas mixer into the series connected test cells in sequence. Table 1 listed the seven test gas conditions for different H2S and O2 levels. All the tests were conducted at room temperature (24 ± 1 ℃). The exposure duration was 30 days or until all the three specimens had failed, whichever occurred first. After the tests, the fracture surface, gauge surface, longitudinal sections of the 1# specimens were examined using SEM."
4,Weight loss tests,"2.3 Weight loss tests Weight loss tests were conducted in a 1.5 L glass vessel to investigate the corrosion rates of C110 steel. The weight loss coupons were machined into a size of 50 mm length × 10 mm width × 3 mm thickness. All the coupons were ground to 1000# with SiC papers and then cleaned by absolute alcohol. After cleaning, the coupons were stored in a desiccator for 24 h and then weighed using an electronic balance. The same gas mixing device and test protocol as SSC tests were used but four weight loss coupons were immersed in the vessel for each weight loss test instead of three loaded uniaxial tensile specimens in the test vessels of proof rings. Five different P H2S/P O2 ratios of test gas conditions (i.e. 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 100:1 and 1:0) given in Table 1 were selected for weight loss tests. The test solution was 4.96 g/L NaCl solution and the test temperature was room temperature (24 ± 1 ℃). After 30 days exposure, the coupons were rinsed with distilled water and then absolute alcohol. For each test, one coupon was used for corrosion product analysis, and the remaining three ones were cleaned using a 10 vol% hydrochloric acid, 90 vol% distilled water and 5 g/L hexamethylenetetramine solution to remove the corrosion products and then weighed again to determine the weight loss. The corrosion rate was calculated via Eq. 1. (1) CR = 3.65 × 1 0 5 × W ATD Where CR is the corrosion rate, millimeters per year (mm/y); W is the mass loss, g; A is the initial exposed surface area of coupon, mm2; T is the exposure time, days; D is the density of specimen, g/cm3. The morphology, elemental distributions and phase identification were characterized using SEM, EDS and XRD with a Cu Kα radiation source."
5,EBSD and STEM observations of crack tips,"2.4 EBSD and STEM observations of crack tips The crack tips of the 1# specimen obtained under the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 5:1 condition were analyzed through EBSD and STEM, to further reveal the crack propagation mechanism. The crystallographic data including crystal orientation, grain boundary types and KAM distribution around the cracks were determined. A focused ion beam (FIB) was used to extract a STEM lamella from crack tips to determine elemental distribution and phase structures."
6,Results,
7,Microstructure features of C110 steel,"3.1 Microstructure features of C110 steel The initial microstructure of as-received C110 steel characterized by STEM is presented in Fig. 3. Due to quenching and tempering treatment, the C110 steel obtained tempered martensites consisting of recrystallized ferrites and spheroidized precipitates. Most of ferrite grains maintained regular lath shape (Fig. 3(a)), while a few exhibited equiaxed shape (Fig. 3(b)). Numerous precipitates with a size of ~300 nm mainly distributed at the grain boundaries. In addition, a few tangled dislocations were observed to be aggregated at the grain boundaries."
8,Effect of O2 on cracking susceptibility,"3.2 Effect of O2 on cracking susceptibility Table 2 lists the time to failure (TTF) of seven sets of C110 steel stressed at 63% AYS in the SSC tests under different P H2S/P O2 ratios conditions. Cracking susceptibility with tensile loading test is usually determined by TTF for a maximum test duration of 720 h[32]. It can be seen that all of the specimens measured at P H2S/P O2 ratios of 1:1 and 5:1 failed with the average TTF of 388 h and 548 h, respectively. When the P H2S/P O2 ratio reached to 10:1, only the first specimen had failed, showing a TTF of 541 h. By contrast, no failures were observed in all the tests at the P H2S/P O2 ratios of 25:1, 50:1, 100:1 and 1:0. The fracture surface morphologies of the failed 1# specimens tested under high O2 level conditions (i.e. P H2S/P O2 ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1) are presented in the Fig. 4. It can be seen that the fracture surface of failed specimen tested at P H2S/P O2 ratio of 1:1 mainly exhibited brittle features, and there existed extensive secondary cracks as a result of the branched nature of this failure (Fig. 4(a)). With the decrease of O2 partial pressure, the fracture surfaces of failed specimen tested at P H2S/P O2 ratios of 5:1 and 10:1 were composed of a mixture of brittle and ductile features (Fig. 4(b and c)), where brittle cracks were initiated from the edge of the fracture surface and gradually transformed into ductile microvoid coalescence in the center region of the fracture surfaces. Fig. 4(d, e, and f) shows the high magnification images of quasi-cleavage morphologies in brittle areas, revealing lath-like tear ridges which were comparable in dimension to the martensitic blocks and laths which was in agreement with previous paper about hydrogen embrittlement fracture of tempered lath martensitic steels [33]. Moreover, some flat-like intergranular features could also be found, as marked by IG in Fig. 4(g, h and i). It is well known that SSC phenomenon is mainly dependent on the diffusion of Habs generated from cathodic reaction process, but not anodic dissolution process of Fe, and usually occurs in low corrosivity environment [1]. However, the gauge surface morphologies of the 1# specimens exhibited various degrees of corrosion characteristics, as shown in Fig. 5. For the specimens tested under high O2 test conditions, severe corrosion and narrow-trench like pitting perpendicular to the loading direction were observed, as shown in Fig. 5(a, b and c). When the P H2S/P O2 ratios exceeded 10:1, less pitting could be detected, and more compact corrosion products formed on the surface, as shown in Fig. 5(d, e, f and g). Furthermore, the longitudinal-sectional morphologies of the gauge sections of the 1# specimens are presented in Fig. 6. The sharp pits were detected on the gauge surface of the specimen tested at the P H2S/P O2 ratios of 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1, where some cracks were initiated from the bottom of pits, as shown in Fig. 6(a, b and c). With the increasing P H2S/P O2 ratio, the degree of surface pitting and cracking decreased significantly. When the P H2S/P O2 ratio reached to 25:1, only small pits were distributed on the surface, and no cracks further initiated, as shown in Fig. 6(d). When the P H2S/P O2 ratios were over 25:1, few surface or inner cracks were detected, and similar features were also obtained for O2-free specimen, as shown in Fig. 6(e, f and g). The comparison of SSC tests with and without O2 ingress clearly demonstrates that the cracking susceptibility of C110 steels shows a strong dependence on the high O2 concentration, while low O2 level seems to have a negligible effect on cracking failures."
9,Effect of O2 on sour corrosion,"3.3 Effect of O2 on sour corrosion Fig. 7 shows the general corrosion rates of C110 steel immersed in the solution under various P H2S/P O2 ratios of 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 100:1 and 1:0 conditions, where the ends of error bars represent the maximum and minimum, respectively. As a result, the highest corrosion rate was up to 2.8 mm/y at the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 1:1, and about 28 times the corrosion rate for the test in the absence of O2 (i.e. 0.1 mm/y). When the P H2S/P O2 ratio reached to 5:1 and 10:1, the corrosion rate decreased to 1.5 mm/y and 0.7 mm/y, respectively. Furthermore, at the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 100:1 belonging to the low O2 concentration level, the corrosion rate decreased to 0.2 mm/y, which was about two times the corrosion rate for O2 free. Apparently, these indicate that high O2 level ingress significantly accelerates the corrosion of C110 steels in sour environment, whereas low O2 concentration only shows a relatively limited effect. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphologies, cross-sectional morphologies and corresponding EDS mapping results of C110 steels after 720 h exposure at various P H2S/P O2 ratios. Table 3 lists the EDS analysis results of corrosion products denoted by white arrows of 1–10 in Fig. 8(b, f, j, n and r). At the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 1:1, the coupon was covered with a large amount of loose corrosion products. At higher magnification, some bulk particles could be observed on the surface. According to atomic ratio (i.e. arrow 1 in Fig. 8(b)), these particles were probably elemental sulfur. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the corrosion product film presented a porous structure with an average thickness of about 140 µm. The EDS map scanning shows that the corrosion products consisted of high concentrations of Fe and O elements and a small amount of S element. Note that O element was enriched at the bottom of corrosion product film (i.e. adjacent to the matrix). At the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 5:1, the surface morphology of corrosion products was similar to that at the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 1:1. Although the film presented a slightly compact structure, some cracks extended through the whole film. Due to the increasing P H2S/P O2 ratio, more S element could be detected. Nevertheless, there was also an O enriched layer adjacent to the matrix. When the P H2S/P O2 ratio increased to 10:1, the steel surface showed a dry-cracking morphology and the content of O element decreased. The average thickness of corrosion product film decreased to about 60 µm. As the O2 concentration decreased to low degree (i.e. P H2S/P O2 ratio of 100:1), the corrosion products become more compact, and some octahedron crystals containing 48.24 at% Fe, 51.76 at% S (i.e. arrow 8 in Fig. 8(n)) were found on the local surface. Fewer O enriched layer could be detected in the corrosion product film. In contrast, the characteristics of corrosion products formed under O2-free condition were significantly different from those under the coexistence of H2S and O2 conditions. There existed well-crystalline corrosion products consisting of flake like crystals containing 52.72 at% Fe, 47.28 at% S (i.e. arrow 9 in Fig. 8(r)) and a few octahedron crystals were found in Fig. 8(r). Furthermore, the corrosion product film in absence of O2 transformed to more compact structure, where the distributions of Fe and S elements were relatively homogeneous in overall film. The XRD spectra of corrosion product films on the surface of C110 steels were analyzed to identify the phase configuration, as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the film formed at the P H2S/P O2 ratio of 1:1 was composed of goethite (α-FeOOH), elemental sulfur (S8), magnetite (Fe3O4), mackinawite (Fe1+xS) and greigite (Fe3S4). When the P H2S/P O2 ratio reached to 5:1, elemental sulfur, magnetite, mackinawite and greigite were detected as the components of corrosion products. With the decrease of injected O2 concentration (e.g. P H2S/P O2 ratio of 10:1 and 100:1), elemental sulfur peaks weakened and even disappeared, while an obvious increase in the intensity of mackinawite and greigite peaks as well as a decrease in intensity of magnetite peaks were observed. In the absence of O2, the spectrum exhibited stronger mackinawite peaks with a small amount of cubic FeS, and no iron oxides/hydroxides could be detected. Above results demonstrate that oxidized species and elemental sulfur tend to be generated under high O2 conditions."
10,EBSD and STEM observations of crack tips,"3.4 EBSD and STEM observations of crack tips To further understand the cracking mechanism of SSC resistant lath martensitic steels in H2S and O2 environment, secondary cracks underneath the fracture surface of the 1# specimen after SSC test at P H2S/P O2 ratio of 5:1 were analyzed by various EBSD measurements in the present research. Fig. 10 (a and b) shows the SEM image and corresponding EBSD IPF map, and Fig. 10 (c) shows the magnified image of the part outlined by the square in Fig. 10 (b). It has been reported that among four types of martensitic boundaries, most of laths boundaries have misorientation angles ＜3°, and some block boundaries with small misorientation (sometimes known as sub-block boundaries) belong to low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs, 2°≤θ ≤ 15°) [34–36]. Table 4 lists the misorientation angle/axis between the grain pairs denoted by grain 1–18 along the crack path in Fig. 10 (c). It can be seen that most of the corresponding misorientation angles between grain pairs were in the range of high angle (i.e. θ＞15°). Among grain pairs listed in Table 4, only grain 1 - grain 18 (51.1°/[011]), grain 5 - grain 6 (10.3°/[0–11]) and grain 10 - grain 15 (47.2°/[101]) had the misorientation angle/axis close to the conventionally reported values (i.e. 10.5°/[011], 49.5°/[011], 60.0°/[011] and 70.5°/[011]) for Kurdjumov–Sachs (K–S) OR variant pairs in a given packet [34,35]. In addition, it is well know that only the boundaries between adjacent blocks or adjacent laths inside one packet have the identical crystallographic {110} plane [36,37]. Bouyne et al. observed that the traces of cleavage cracking planes of bainitic steel were always perpendicular to corresponding crystallographic direction in the EBSD pole figures [38]. In the present research, the similar method was used to identify the cracking plane traces of grains along the crack path, as shown in Fig. 11. For the grains 1, 18, 5, 6, 10 and 15, the perpendicular lines of crack plane trace were very closed to {110} poles, indicating that the crack had propagated along the block boundaries. Note that most other grains did not exhibit the similar crack plane orientations. This clearly suggests that the cracks were mainly aligned along packets/prior austenite grains boundaries, which is not fully consistent with common HE-related cracking paths along the {110} laths/blocks boundaries reported by other researchers [33,36,37]. In addition, the KAM, a quantitative parameter calculated by EBSD, was then used to assess local strain distribution and dislocation density surrounding the cracks. By comparing the EBSD data of original specimen before SSC test, the peak of KAM distribution after SSC test slightly shifted to higher Kernel misorientation angles, and the average value of KAM was just increased from 0.644° to 0.724° after SSC test, while no strongly deformed grains and local strain regions were observed along the crack path or at the crack tips, as shown in Fig. 12. Considering other possible mechanisms related to the martensitic boundaries, the degradation of microstructure around crack paths was discussed through STEM measurements. A STEM lamella selected from tip section of micro crack initiated from corrosion pit from the 1# specimen after SSC test at P H2S/P O2 ratio of 5:1 was prepared by FIB. The STEM HAADF images of crack tip are displayed in Fig. 13 (a and b). It can be observed that the crack was filled with non-metallic species formed in the crack which appeared a dark region, where some bright granular precipitates were distributed. The SAED patterns taken from selected area denoted by 1 in Fig. 13 (a) shows the [001] of M3C type carbide having an orthorhombic structure in the middle, as well as a very clear polycrystalline diffraction ring, as shown in Fig. 13 (c). From these results, it can be concluded that the cracking process in H2S and O2 environment was accompanied by the formation of a large number of nanoscale corrosion products. In addition, although some tangled dislocations could be observed around local crack tips, there was no significant alteration to the dislocation density around the most cracking paths, compared to initial microstructure shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding EDS mappings of S, O, Fe, Cr, Mn, Mo, V and C are exhibited in Fig. 14 (b~i). Those bright precipitates contained lower content of Fe and higher contents of Cr, Mn and C than the lath matrix, indicating the alloy cementites. Furthermore, the dark region in the crack was enriched in S and depleted in Fe. There was also a significant O enriched region with a width of about 50–100 nm along the crack interface. In order to reveal the variations of composition across the crack, EDS line scan along the line marked in HAADF map in Fig. 14 (a) was taken, as shown in Fig. 14 (j). Due to the existence of alloy carbide, evident Cr, Mn and C peaks appeared in the center of crack section. The line profiles of S and O were quite different across the crack width. O content peaked adjacent to both sides of crack-matrix interfaces and then gradually decreased with an increase in the distance from the interface to the center of the crack. On the contrary, S content at crack-matrix interfaces was about half of that in the center of the crack. The high resolution images together with fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and the corresponding inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) were used to study the crystal structures of corrosion products in the crack. The mixture of disordered structures and greigite structures was observed in the matrix-crack interface region, as shown in Fig. 15. Greigite (cubic Fe3S4) containing mixed Fe (Ⅱ) and Fe (Ⅲ), is similar to ferriferous oxide [4]. Considering the enrichment of O and decrease of S at the interface, those disordered structures may be amorphous iron-oxygen compounds. In addition, in the S enriched region beyond the interface oxide, layered lattice fringes were also found where the proportion of disordered structures had the tendency of declining, as shown in Fig. 16. Based on FFT pattern analysis, these layered structures could be identified as mackinawite, with the d (001) located at 5.10–5.20 Å. Clearly, the d (001) of mackinawite in this study differs from the well-crystalline mackinawite which d (001) is 5.0328 Å [39]. Mackinawite has a tetragonal layered structure made up of stacked (001) planes [40]. Previous researches have reported the lattice expansion of synthetic nanocrystalline mackinawite along the c-axis, which was attributed to both intercalation of water molecules between the layers of mackinawite and lattice relaxation with decreasing crystallite size[41]. Furthermore, a large scale of SAED in Fig. 13 (d) obtained from about 450 nm diameter circle area in the center of the crack denoted by 2 in Fig. 13 (a) shows the Debye-rings with d-spacings similar to that of nanocrystalline mackinawite. These results suggest that mackinawite containing Fe (Ⅱ) had become the main phase in the center of the crack."
11,Discussion,"According to the issues mentioned above, we proposed a model to depict the whole cracking behaviour involving a multi-stage process in H2S and O2 environment: (I) the formation of necessary environmental conditions based on oxidation reactions of H2S; (Ⅱ) the corrosion reactions on the metal surface in the absence of effective diffusion barrier; (Ⅲ) the degradation and cracking of martensitic boundaries controlled by hydrogen and corrosion, as shown in Fig. 17. The corresponding mechanisms involved in each stage are systematically discussed in following Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively."
12,The reactions of H2S and O2,"4.1 The reactions of H2S and O2 It is well known that H2S dissolves in the water to generate HS-, S2- and H+ ions. The reactions and the corresponding equilibrium constant equations are listed as follows [4,42]: (2) H 2 S ( g ) ↔ K H 2 S H 2 S ( aq ) K H 2 S = α H 2 S ( aq ) f H 2 S ( g ) = C H 2 S ( aq ) φ P H 2 S ( g ) (3) H 2 S ( aq ) ↔ K 1 H + + HS − K 1 = C HS − ( aq ) ∙ C H + ( aq ) C H 2 S ( aq ) (4) H S − ↔ K 2 H + + S 2 − K 2 = C S 2 − ( aq ) ∙ C H + ( aq ) C HS − ( aq ) Where K H2S and K i (i = 1, 2) are the solubility constant and acid dissociation constant for H2S, respectively, which can be calculated by the three functions of temperature, as shown by Eq. 5–7 [43–46]; φ is the fugacity coefficient, which can be calculated by Eq. 8 [47]; T K is the temperature (K); P is the partial pressure of H2S (bar). (5) K H 2 S = 1 0 − ( 634.27 + 0.2709 T k − 0.11132 × 10 − 3 T K 2 − 16719 T K − 261.9 log T K ) (6) K 1 = 10 782.43945 + 0.361261 T K − 1.6722 × 10 − 4 T K 2 − 20565.7315 T K − 142.741722 In T K (7) K 2 = 1 0 − ( 23.93 − 0.030446 T K + 2.4831 × 10 − 5 T K 2 ) (8) log φ = P 0.0031 − 1.4 / T K Based on the electro-neutrality theory, the concentration of H+ can be calculated from the equilibrium constants derived from Eq. 2–4, and the function with respect to C H(aq)+ can be express as follows [48,49]: (9) C H + ( aq ) 3 + 2 C F e 2 + C H + ( aq ) 2 − ( K W + K 1 K H 2 S φ P H 2 S （ g ） ) C H + ( aq ) - 2 K 1 K 2 K H 2 S φ P H 2 S （ g ） = 0 Where K w is the ionization constant of water, which is 1 × 10−13.99 at 0.1 MPa and 298 K[50]; C Fe2+ is the Fe2+ concentration associated with the anodic reaction of metals. According to Eq. 9, C H+ (aq) is dependent on the temperature, partial pressure of H2S and Fe2+ concentration. By solving Eq. 5–9, the relationship between pH value and P H2S or C Fe2+ in the solution only saturated with H2S are summarized in Fig. 18. Before the corrosion of metals occurs (i.e. C Fe2+ =0), the pH value slightly decreases with the increase of H2S partial pressure. Once the anodic reaction proceeds (i.e. C Fe2+ ＞0), the increase of C Fe2+ will induce a significant increase in the pH value, as shown in Fig. 18 (b). In the present research, the pH values and chemical composition of solutions after 720 h weight loss tests in Section 3.3 were measured and listed in Table 5. With the increase of O2 partial pressure, the measured pH value gradually decreases, and the lowest pH drops to 3.1 (i.e. P H2S/P O2 ratios of 1:1 and 5:1), which is much lower than the calculated pH value without O2 ingress (e.g. pH 5.9 at 0.83 bar H2S and 199 mg/L C Fe2+). It is thus indicated that the concentration of H+ is also influenced by the O2 ingress which even plays a greater role than the H2S partial pressure or the proceeding of anodic reaction. In addition, Table 5 also shows the presence of SO4 2- in the solutions with high level of O2 ingress. Based on the prevailing research, elemental sulfur is the only reaction product in H2S and O2 coexistent systems [26,27], described by Eq. 10. Nevertheless, Song et al. demonstrated that besides elemental sulfur, the oxysulfur ions, such as SO3 2-, S2O3 2-, SO4 2-, were also the reaction products of H2S and O2 [20,51]. Possible reaction pathways are shown in Eqs. 11 and 12 [52]. (10) 8 H 2 S ( aq ) + 4 O 2 ( g ) → S 8 ( s ) ↓+ 8 H 2 O ( l ) (11) 2 H 2 S ( aq ) + 2 O 2 ( g ) → S 2 O 3 2 - ( aq ) + H 2 O ( l ) + 2 H + ( aq ) (12) 8 S 2 O 3 2 - ( aq ) + 4 O 2 ( g ) → 8 S O 4 2 - ( aq ) + S 8 ( s ) ↓ Considering that thiosulfate acts as an intermediate during the formation of sulfate, Eq. 11+Eq. 12 can be expressed as: (13) 16 H 2 S ( aq ) + 20 O 2 ( g ) → 8 S O 4 2 - ( aq ) + S 8 ( s ) ↓+ 8 H 2 O ( l ) + 16 H + ( aq ) Clearly, Eq. 13 produces not only sulfate ions but also more H ions, resulting in the lower pH value, which needs more amounts of O2 acting as electron acceptors than Eq. 10. It is important to note that with the increase of O2 contents, both of elemental sulfur and sulfate ions concentrations increased and the pH value decreased, providing more corrosive and acidic solution conditions."
13,The effect of O2 on the formation and transformation of corrosion products,"4.2 The effect of O2 on the formation and transformation of corrosion products In the prevailing researches about O2 corrosion in water environment, O2 as cathodic depolarizer and strong oxidant, provides a cathodic reaction for the anodic dissolution of metals, and oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, the following reactions are involved in the O2 corrosion process [53,54]: Anode reaction: (14) Fe → F e 2 + + 2 e − (15) F e 2 + → F e 3 + + e − Cathode reaction: (16) O 2 + 2 H 2 O+ 4 e − → 4 O H − (in neutral or alkali solution) (17) O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e − → 2 H 2 O in acidic solution Unlike the cathode reaction in neutral or alkali solution, the O2 reduction will consume amount of H+ in acidic solution, according to Eq. 17. However, in the present research, the O2 ingress not only increases corrosion rate of C110 steels, but also significantly decreases the pH values of the solutions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the direct effect of O2 as the cathodic depolarizer on corrosion process is limited. Actually, the presence of O2 may mainly has an indirect effect on the corrosion rate and the corrosion product formation by oxidizing H2S to elemental sulfur, sulphate and more H+ (i.e. Eq. 10 – 13). In wet H2S environment, the dense and stable corrosion product films can act as a barrier for mass transport to provide the corrosion protection [4]. In the present tests with O2 ingress, the predominant corrosion products on the steel surface were mackinawite formed by the corrosion reactions of iron with H2S and elemental sulfur, respectively. The widely accepted formation mechanism of H2S induced mackinawite is mainly based on the solid-state reaction and precipitation kinetics, and the corresponding reactions are expressed as follows [4,55–57]: Anode reaction: (18) Fe + H 2 S+ H 2 O↔FeHS ads − + H 3 O + (19) FeHS ads − ↔ FeHS ads + + 2 e − (20) FeHS ads + ↔ FeS 1 − x + x HS − + 1 − x H + Cathode reaction: (21) H 2 S+ e − → H+HS − (22) H S − + e − → H+ S 2 − (23) H + + e − → H Precipitation reaction: (24) F e 2 + + H 2 S ↔Fe S m + 2 H + It has been established that elemental sulfur could result in the most severe localized corrosion encountered in oil and gas production [1]. However, in contrast with H2S corrosion, there are different reaction paths having been proposed to describe the elemental sulfur corrosion mechanism. MacDonald et al. reported a electrochemical mechanism for oxidation of iron by sulfur based on their physical contact, suggesting that the overall corrosion process (i.e. Eq. 25) was controlled by the cathodic reaction catalysed by mackinawite [29]. It is worth noting that the mackinawite has metal-type electronic conductivity, making it an excellent substrate for cathodic reduction of protons[1]. In the present research, the corrosion process did not depend on the hydrolysis of elemental sulfur, indicating that elemental sulfur was in direct contact with metal surface (or covered by mackinawite), which is consistent with the necessary condition of above electrochemical mechanism. However, mackinawite is thermodynamically metastable with standard molar Gibbs energy of formation of −88.43 kJ/mol [58]. Shoesmith et al. revealed that the solubility of mackinawite was high enough below the pH value of 4, which inhibited the precipitation of corrosion products and further accelerated the corrosion of steels [59]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the formation and dissolution of mackinawite will occur simultaneously in H2S and O2 -containing system, and which process is dominant depends on the acidification degree caused by the ingress of O2. (25) ( x -1)Fe+ S y - 1 ∙ S 2 - + 2 H + → FeS m ( x -1)FeS m +H 2 S+S y-x On the other hand, exposure of mackinawite to oxidants can easily promote the formation and migration of Fe (Ⅲ), resulting in the transformation to greigite [60]. Greigite is also assumed to be metastable [4], and even has been thought to be looser and less protective than mackinawite [61]. Lennie et al. proposed that the transformation of synthetic mackinawite to greigite proceeded by rearrangement of Fe cations within the cubic close-packed S array of mackinawite, and surplus Fe would be accommodated as Fe-O(H) phases [62]. Therefore, it is generally accepted that the transformation process also involves the formation of elemental sulfur, magnetite and goethite, and the possible reaction pathways are described in Eq. 26–30 [60,63]. Firstly: (26) 3 Fe S m + 2 O 2 → F e 3 O 4 + 3 S( 0 ) (27) or 4 Fe S m + 3 O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 FeOOH+ 4 S( 0 ) Secondly: (28) 3 Fe S m +S( 0 ) → F e 3 S 4 Finally: (29) F e 3 S 4 + 2 O 2 → F e 3 O 4 + 4 S( 0 ) (30) or 4 F e 3 S 4 + 9 O 2 + 6 H 2 O → 12 FeOOH+ 16 S( 0 ) In the present research, Fe (Ⅲ)-containing polysulphide/oxidized phases were observed under H2S and O2 containing conditions, suggesting that O2 acting as electron acceptors also directly participated in the oxidation of mackinawite. With the increase of O2 content, more iron-oxygen phases and fewer iron-sulfur phases are detected as well as the significant enhancement of corrosion rates. Accordingly, it can be concluded that due to the dissolution and oxidation of mackinawite, the changes in compaction and structure of the corrosion product film result in the lack of diffusion barrier layer, which can accelerate the ion diffusion. By contrast, under the O2-free “reduction” condition, the corrosion product film is compact and well-crystalline mackinawite. Furthermore, the precipitation of elemental sulfur generated by the reaction of H2S and O2 can also significantly assist the pitting corrosion process. Once the localized corrosion proceeds, large pitting defects easily serve as nucleation sites for cracking due to the stress concentration developing at the bottom of the pits."
14,The effect of O2 on the cracking mechanism,"4.3 The effect of O2 on the cracking mechanism According to the classical electrochemical adsorption mechanism of H+ (i.e. Eq. 31) [1,32], more hydrogen atoms should have be adsorbed and further diffused into C110 steels due to the production of more H+ in presence of O2 and H2S, making C110 steels more susceptible for HE. (31) H + + e − → H ads In the previous HE researches, the mutual interactions of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) mechanisms are usually proposed to explain the effects of hydrogen on crack propagation of lath martensitic steels [33,37,64]. Nagao et al. observed the intense slip bands and partial destruction of the lath boundaries beneath the fracture surface with hydrogen, revealing that HE failure of these steels was driven by a hydrogen-enhanced and plasticity-mediated decohesion (HEPD) mechanism [33]. According to Geudes et al., diffusive hydrogen can enhance the mobility of screw dislocations, resulting in the propagation of HE-induced quasi-cleavage cracks along the laths/blocks boundaries [37]. In addition, when dislocation pile-ups impinge on prior austenite grain boundaries, HE-induced intergranular cracking may take place [64]. Nevertheless, in the present research, although there are two typical HE crack propagation paths in the form of quasi-cleavage cracking and intergranular cracking under high O2 conditions, both KAM and STEM results show no significant alteration to the dislocation density around the cracks, suggesting that the effect of plasticity on the cracking process is limited. Accordingly, it can be inferred that the HEPD may be not the dominant cracking mechanism for C110 steels in O2-contaminated H2S environment. Tian et al. reported that the hydrogen permeation of E690 high strength low alloy steel in thiosulfate-containing artificial seawater tended to be inhibited with the increase of thiosulfate concentration [65]. Ayagou et al. also observed that O2 contamination in H2S-containing solution reduced hydrogen charging into metal, and they assumed that the reduction of thiosulfate generated from the reaction of H2S-O2 might play a detrimental role in the atomic hydrogen uptake into the metal, based on Eq. 32 [66]. Shvab et al. proposed that the reduction of thiosulfate ions with atomic hydrogen proceeds in the near-cathode layer, and the process rate was determined by the concentration of atomic hydrogen rather than by the electrode potential [67]. (32) S 2 O 3 2 − + H ads + e − → S 2 − +S O 3 2 − + H + Therefore, it can be inferred that the lower pH under O2-contaminated condition favors the atomic hydrogen adsorption as in Eq. 31, but the more adsorbed hydrogen on the cathode surface could react with thiosulfate as in Eq. 32, which will block the hydrogen adsorption and further mitigate hydrogen permeation. On the other hand, it must be noted that the increase of O2 concentration accelerates the localized corrosion of steels, and the pits/trenches acting as stress concentration points will favor HE-induced cracking. Also, HRTEM results show that a large amount of corrosion products including nanoscale iron mono/polysulphide and iron oxidized phases existed in the crack tip, indicating that the anodic dissolution along cracking pathways still occurred during the martensitic boundaries cracking process. Based on the issues mentioned above, it can be concluded that the cracking behavior of C110 steels in presence of H2S and O2 is controlled by a combined effect of hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion. The high O2 level ingress not only promotes the pitting on the surface and the corrosion along cracking pathways, but also restricts HE effect to a certain extent, making the anodic dissolution mechanism more dominant. It is well known that high strength and low alloy steels achieve acceptable resistance to SSC mainly by the refinement of microstructure, controlling non-metallic inclusions and achieving a homogeneous dispersion of fine alloy carbide precipitates, to increase the level of irreversible hydrogen traps and reduce the effective hydrogen diffusivity [68–70], which obviously can not meet the requirements of corrosion and cracking resistances in H2S and O2 -containing environment. Accordingly, it is easy to think of selecting the high corrosion resistant alloy materials such as stainless steels and nickel-based alloys to avoid O2 ingress induced failure modes such as sour corrosion, pitting, cracking, etc., but it will bring a significant development cost increase to oil companies. Based on the present research, a more economical and feasible way can be proposed to mitigate crack risks by reducing the injected O2 resources to a low concentration range (e.g. by employing effective gas purification deoxidation process), making the dominant mechanism convert to the HE mechanism."
15,Conclusions,"The cracking behavior of SSC resistant C110 steel exposed to various partial pressure ratios of H2S and O2 gas injected solutions was investigated. The following conclusions can be obtained: 1. With the increase of O2 partial pressure, the cracking susceptibility and corrosion rate of C110 steel significantly increased. Under high O2 level conditions, the severe localized corrosion on the steel surface accelerated the cracking process, while low O2 level had a negligible effect on cracking behavior. 2. The O2 ingress strongly affected the environmental conditions (i.e. the formation of elemental sulfur and more H+) because of the oxidation reactions of H2S in the solution. The dissolution and oxidation of mackinawite resulted in the formation of porous corrosion product films comprised of mackinawite, greigite and other oxidized species which could not act as an effective diffusion barrier to inhibit corrosion. 3. In the presence of H2S and O2, no significant local dislocation activity could be observed in the cracking regions, but corrosion and O2 induced phase transformation still occurred during the martensitic boundaries cracking process. Thus, due to the O2 ingress, the cracking mechanism changed from the HE mechanism for O2 free condition to the combined effect of HE and anodic dissolution mechanisms."
