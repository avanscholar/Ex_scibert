0,Introduction,"Nowadays, modern society relies heavily on energy consumption using mostly solid, liquid or gaseous fuels from fossil sources. Combustion of such fuels has led to increasing CO2 emissions, this together with the depletion of existing reserves, makes crucial the development of alternatives fuels. European Union wishes to increase the share of renewable sources in energy production, including the production of biofuels for the transportation sector and consequently research and development activities have been encouraged and supported. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), or biodiesel, is produced by transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol. Many fats contain triglycerides, which can be transesterified to produce FAME, however, in Europe are usually used rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and palm oil. FAME has been used as diesel fuel for many years in Europe, blended with petroleum derived diesel fuel, at amounts lower than 10%, because of FAME different chemical compositions. Some motor manufacturers defend that during combustion some problems may arise that damage combustion devices or lowers their performance, however, it has been claimed that FAME use as a pure component, without blending, does not affect combustion devices. Hydrogenated Vegetal Oil (HVO) is another option to use vegetable oils as biofuels. HVO is produced by catalytic hydrogenation and its composition is similar to petroleum derived fuels, thus allowing its use in conventional motors without legal limitations. HVO is still a first generation fuel, but it may present several advantages in relation to FAME, namely: superior cold weather properties, higher heating value, higher cetane number, and the process by-product, propane, has better options than glycerol by-product. On the other hand, they may be used in conventional motors without the need of blending with conventional fuels. Rapeseed oil has been widely studied for the production of bio-fuels via hydrogenation [1–6] with the aim of producing liquid biofuels with the right properties to be used in conventional transportation vehicles. Hydrogenation of rapeseed oil may convert fatty acid triglycerides into hydrocarbons. During triglycerides hydrogenation some chemical bonds are broken done, thus they may be converted into monoglycerides, diglycerides and carboxylic acids, which may be converted into alkanes by three different pathways: decarboxylation, decarbonylation and hydrodexogenation. Catalytic hydrogenation improves vegetable oils conversion into suitable biofuels. Ravasio et al. [1] tested different supported copper catalysts to study the effect of catalysts preparation method, the support used and the activation treatment in rapeseed oil hydrogenation and found that 8% Cu/SiO2 destroyed the trienic component C18:3, reduced considerably the dienic one and the C18:1 compounds content increased till 88% with notable oxidation stability. Priecel et al. [2] also studied the influence of catalyst preparation in rapeseed oil deoxygenation by sulfided NiMo-alumina catalysts with different distribution of Ni species and found higher activity in catalysts with higher population of octahedral nickel species than in those with higher population of tetrahedral nickel species. These authors also reported that Ni-alumina catalysts promoted rapeseed oil deoxygenation, through the hydrodecarboxylation pathway and the formation of C17 hydrocarbons, while Mo-alumina catalysts favoured the hydrodeoxygenation pathway and the formation of C18 hydrocarbons [2]. Šimácˇek et al. [3] hydrogenated rapeseed oil over a temperature range from 260 to 340°C and under a pressure of 7MPa in presence of three NiMo/alumina hydrorefining catalysts in a laboratory flow reactor. Reaction products were affected by reaction conditions, as at temperatures lower than 310°C, the final organic liquid product contained fatty acids and triglycerides, but at higher reaction temperatures only hydrocarbons were detected, mainly C17 and C18 n-alkanes and about 40wt.% of i-alkanes C16 C18. In a more recent publication [4] the same authors blended the organic liquid product obtained at 360°C and 7MPa in concentrations from 5 to 30wt.% with mineral diesel fuel. Most of the standard parameters of these blends were similar to or even better than those of pure mineral fuels, meeting the European diesel fuel specification EN 590. But the low-temperature properties were worse (pour point higher than +20°C), which prevented the use of the organic liquid product obtained by hydrogenation in the pure form. The hydrogenation of 5wt.% of rapeseed oil mixed with pure petroleum vacuum distillate at 420°C, under a hydrogen pressure of 18MPa and in presence of a commercial NiMo catalyst led to a final product with acceptable low-temperature properties (cloud point: 23 C, CFPP: 24 C) and similar to those obtained from pure petroleum raw material [5]. Šimácˇek et al. [5] reported that the rise of hydrogenation temperature from 400 to 420°C allowed decreasing the content of n-heptadecane and n-octadecane in the final product by increasing the formation of i-alkanes, which improved the low-temperature properties of the co-processed product. According to these authors the hydrogenation of petroleum raw material blended with vegetable oil may be a potential alternative to produce green diesel using refinery technologies already known. Rapeseed oil cracking studied in the presence of different catalysts and at temperatures from 350 to 440°C under atmospheric pressure were reported by Buzetzki et al. [6]. The yield of the liquid reaction products changed between 85 and 90wt.% and presented paraffins, olefins and fatty acids. Due to the presence of oxygenated compounds, viscosity and density values were higher than those permitted by EN 590 standard. However, mixtures of 3–7vol.% of these organic products with fossil diesel fuels allowed to meet the requirements of EN 590 standard. Sotelo-Boyás et al. [7] studied the effect of three different catalysts (Pt/H-Y, Pt/H-ZSM-5, and sulfided NiMo/γ-Al2O3) in hydrocracking of rapeseed oil at a temperature range from 300 to 400°C, initial hydrogen pressures from 5 to 11MPa and reaction time limited to 3h. the conversion of triglycerides and fatty acids into hydrocarbons was reported to be highly affected by pressure and temperature. Pt-zeolite catalysts had a strong catalytic effect in cracking and hydrogenation reactions, producing more iso- than n-paraffins in the range of C5 C22. On the other hand, the highest yield of liquid hydrocarbons with the boiling temperature in the range of those of diesel fraction, with compounds from C15 to C18, was obtained in presence of NiMo/γ-Al2O3. A basic thermodynamic model was proposed to evaluate vegetable oil conversion into hydrocarbons by Smejkal et al. [8], who reported good agreement with experimental data. According to this model, the main reaction products were C18 hydrocarbons, whose formation depended on reaction temperature and pressure and were limited by hydrogen transfer. Neste Oil [9] and UOP/Eni Ecofining [10] are commercial processes for HVO production. Plant-derived oils are mixed with recycle hydrogen to saturate and completely deoxygenate the oil by catalytic reaction, producing a paraffin-rich product, compatible with petroleum diesel and with environmental benefits. Thus, large-scale industrial production may have an important role in fulfilling world’s growing need for clean diesel fuel. Most of research works about hydrogenation of vegetable oils have been done with the goal of producing fuels similar to those obtained from petroleum. However, other utilisation should also be considered and investigated, due to the depletion of existing petroleum reserves. Nowadays mankind depends on petroleum to produce many valuable raw materials and it is urgent to find a bio-product that could substitute petroleum, hydrogenation of vegetable oils may be a possibility to attain this goal. The main aim of the rapeseed oil hydrogenation experimental work presented in this paper was the production of renewable valuable liquid hydrocarbons with different applications either than as liquid biofuels. Thus, the production of valuable bio-hydrocarbons, like aromatic were the target compounds. The effect of experimental conditions on rapeseed oil hydrogenation was studied, with the aim of decreasing temperature and pressure conditions by the presence of an active cobalt and molybdenum catalyst. The innovations aspects of this work were the use of different experimental conditions, namely a catalyst commonly used in petrochemical industry, lower temperature and lower hydrogen pressures with the objective of decreasing operational costs and increasing the viability of hydrogenation process to produce bio-chemicals."
1,Experimental part,"Hydrogenation tests were carried out in a discontinuous reactor with a capacity of 1L inside a furnace, as shown in Fig. 1 . The reactor was connected to a PID programmable controller for temperature control and with agitation speed and pressure sensors. The reactor was loaded with rapeseed oil, closed, purged and pressurised to a pre-set value with hydrogen. After the pre-settled reaction temperature was reached, the reaction was carried during the defined reaction time. Afterwards, the autoclave was cooled down till room temperature and gaseous and liquid products were collected, measured and analysed. Both gases and liquids yields were calculated by common procedures, using the rates between each product formed and the initial amount of rapeseed oil. Rapeseed oil elemental analysis is presented in Table 1 and some of its physicochemical properties are shown in Table 2 . Density was measured at 20°C according to ISO 12185:1996 and viscosity was determined at 40°C by EN ISO 3104. HHV was determined by CEN/TS 14918 standard and LHV was calculated from HHV, considering water content. The same standards and procedures were also used for the determination of physicochemical properties of hydrogenated oils obtained at different experimental conditions. Rapeseed oil was hydrogenated at different experimental conditions. The following range of experimental parameters was studied: run temperature from 200 to 400°C; reaction time from 8 to 180min and hydrogen initial pressure was 1.10MPa. Due to the rise of temperature during reactor heating process and to the formation of gaseous products, reactor pressure increased, reaching values between 1.4MPa and 6.0MPa, depending on reaction conditions. The performance of a hydrogenation CoMo based commercial catalyst, usually used for hydrocarbons hydrogenation, was also tested. Gaseous products were collected for direct analysis by gas chromatography (GC), using a HP 6890 Hewlett–Packard gas chromatograph, to determine their content of hydrocarbons and other compounds such as carbon oxides (CO and CO2), hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), C3H8 (propane) and other gaseous hydrocarbons. Gases density was determined by Schilling effusiometer, applying the standard IP59 – Method C [11]. Liquid products were collected, measured and analysed by several techniques, namely GC-FID (gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector), GC–MS (gas chromatography with mass spectrometry) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The identification of the compounds present in the hydrogenated oils was done by GC–MS, using a gas chromatograph Thermo Focus GC coupled to a mass spectrometer Thermo Polaris Q. A capillary column Thermo, model TR-V1 (cyanopropylphenyl phase) with an internal diameter of 0.25mm, film thickness of 1.4μm and a length of 60m was used. Each sample was diluted in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and 1μL of this solution obtained was injected into the GC–MS. Samples were injected at 280°C in the splitless mode. After 3min, the flow split valve was opened with a flow of 30mL/min. The oven temperature program began with an isothermal period of 3min at the temperature of 40°C, after which temperature was raised to 280°C at a heating rate of 2°C/min, followed by a isothermal period of 15min at this temperature. Data acquisition was performed in full scan mode in a mass range from 30 to 500 atomic mass units. The purpose of the GC-FID analysis was to determine quantitatively the main components of each sample, and evaluate the conversion of triglycerides in other compounds such as hydrocarbons, free fatty acids, monoglycerides and diglycerides. To obtain a good chromatographic peak shape and an adequate chromatographic elution of the components with hydroxyl groups (monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids) all samples were subject to a derivatization procedure using BSTFA agent (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide). A small volume of liquid sample and of pure BSTFA were mixed and heated for 30min at a temperature of 50°C. Afterwards, 1mL of hexane was added to the mixture and 1μL of this solution was immediately injected in the GC-FID (Trace GC, Thermo). The sample was injected in a PTV injector at an initial temperature of 280°C followed by a ballistic heating up to 380°C at a heating rate of 14°C/s. The injection was made in the split mode with a split valve flow of 40mL/min. The oven temperature was programmed at 40°C during 3min, the temperature was then increased to 370°C at a heating rate of 15°C/min, followed by a isothermal period of 5min at this temperature. The flame ionisation detector (FID) was operated at a temperature of 380°C and the carrier gas used was hydrogen (H2) at a constant pressure of 60kPa. The FT-IR spectra of the hydrogenated oil samples and of the original rapeseed oil were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX spectrophotometer using 16 consecutive scans of each spectra in a range between 400 and 4000cm−1 with a 4cm−1 of resolution. Each sample was analysed in the form of a thin pellet prepared by mixing an appropriate amount of pre-dried sample with dry KBr powder."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Effect of experimental conditions on hydrogenation product yields,"3.1 Effect of experimental conditions on hydrogenation product yields During the hydrogenation of a vegetal oil triglycerides are converted into small molecules: diglycerides, monoglycerides and carboxylic acids, and oxygen may be removed from these compounds by different chemical reactions: decarboxylation (1), decarbonylation (2) and hydrodeoxygenation(or dehydration/hydrogenation) (3) [12]. Water (H2O), CO and CO2 are released in these reactions, leading to the formation of a gas phase. (1) R- CH 2 COOH ⇆ R- CH 3 + CO 2 (2) R- CH 2 COOH + H 2 ⇆ R- CH 3 + CO + H 2 O (3) R- CH 2 COOH + 3 H 2 ⇆ R- CH 2 CH 3 + 2 H 2 O During hydrogenation, the high process temperatures may lead to cracking reactions, thus originating small radicals, which after stabilisation by hydrogen addition may lead to the formation of small molecules, which are gases at normal temperature and pressure conditions. Thus, the formation of gaseous products is expected to occur during vegetable oils hydrogenation and the release of gases may give information about how far the hydrogenation reactions proceeded. In Figs. 2 and 3 are presented the yields of gaseous and liquid products obtained after rapeseed oil hydrogenation at different experimental conditions. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the rise of temperature, to values higher than 300°C, favoured the release of gaseous compounds and consequently decreased the production of liquid products. This effect was observed at quite distinct experimental conditions; reaction times of 6min and 120min and in presence or absence of catalyst. The results presented in Fig. 2 seem to show that the hydrogenation reactions were favoured by longer reaction times and by the effect of the CoMo catalyst, as higher gaseous products were obtained. These results agree with those reported by Sotelo-Boyás et al. [7], who observed that the rise of temperature from 350 to 400°C decreased the formation of liquid compounds obtained by rapeseed oil hydrogenation in presence of NiMo/Al2O3 during 3h at 350°C and with a hydrogen initial pressure of 8MPa. In Fig. 3 may be analysed the effect of hydrogenation reaction time on products yields in presence of CoMo catalyst at two reaction temperatures 200°C and 400°C. No great changes were observed in products yields when the reaction time increased from 6 to 120min at 200°C. The low yield in gaseous products observed at 200°C indicated that the rapeseed oil required higher temperatures to produce gas products via cracking or decarboxylation. Probably, the reactions occurring at 200°C were most cracking and isomerisation of triglycerides to yield liquid products, with an eventual uptake of hydrogen in reactions with lower activation energy, such as the hydrogenation of double bonds. On the other hand, at 400°C, the same variation in reaction time led to a decrease in liquid yield of about 18%, while gas yields rose around 88%. The increase of reaction time from 120 to 180min led to milder variations in both gas and liquid yields, which may indicate that the hydrogenation reaction was close to equilibrium at 120min. Fig. 3 results seem to show that the hydrogenation reactions were favoured by the reaction temperature of 400°C. Test runs done at 350°C led to trends similar to those obtained at 400°C, though lower variations in products yield were obtained. A batch process was used for hydrogenation of rapeseed oil studies and as the steady-state was reached through a transient stage, reaction mechanism might have been affected, probably, because during the heating step, some hydrogenation and cracking reactions might have occurred even before the setting reaction temperature was reached. This effect is expected to be more important at the highest temperature tested [13]. However, these are experimental limitations of batch reactors like autoclaves. Hydrogenation of rapeseed oil needs high hydrogen pressures, thus autoclaves are the type of reactors usually used at lab-scale. Hence, reactions progress and pathway and consequently products yields and properties may be affected by reactor design and characteristics, which are main features in the technical and economical viability of hydrogenation process [14]."
4,Analysis of hydrogenation gaseous products,"3.2 Analysis of hydrogenation gaseous products The analysis of gaseous products by GC showed the presence of the following compounds: CO2, CO, CH4, C2H6 and C3H8, besides H2. Other gaseous hydrocarbons, which include: ethylene, propene and butane and cis-2-buteno were also detected, but at concentrations below 1% (v/v). CO2 and CO concentrations depended on experimental conditions used and values around 6 and 14% (v/v), respectively, were measured, probably as a result of decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions (1) and (2). CH4 was the hydrocarbon detected with the highest concentrations, being followed by C2H6 and C3H8. Though different concentrations were obtained at different experimental conditions, no significant relationships were observed. The determination of gas density by IP59 – Method C [11] led to values between 0.2 and 0.9kg/m3. The lowest values corresponded to the lowest temperature and reaction time conditions, at which hydrogenation reactions were not so favoured and the formation of gaseous products was lower. At these conditions, the H2 introduced in the reactor in the beginning of the experiments was the predominant component of the gas phase, thus gas density reached the lowest values. The rise of temperature and of reaction time favoured hydrogenation and cracking reactions and consequently the release of CO and CO2 and the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons were expected to increase, which led to the rise in gas density. This assumption was confirmed by Fig. 4 data. The rise of reaction temperature led to an increase in gas density of around 50%. This increase was even higher in presence of CoMo catalyst, as hydrogenation and cracking reactions were promoted by the increase in reaction time."
5,Analysis of hydrogenation liquid products,"3.3 Analysis of hydrogenation liquid products 3.3.1 FTIR analysis The conversion of triglycerides in other liquid products was evaluated by FTIR analysis of the hydrogenated liquid products. This analysis allows the qualitative evaluation of the deoxygenation and decarboxylation reactions through the disappearance of the absorption peaks corresponding to oxygenated functional groups such as esters, carboxylic acids and alcohols and the increase in the absorption peaks corresponding to hydrocarbon CC bonds. The FTIR spectrums of hydrogenated oils obtained at conditions of good triglyceride conversion (Figs. 6 and 7 ) showed similar patterns, thus only one FTIR spectrum is shown. The FTIR spectre obtained for hydrogenated oil produced at 400°C and 180min in presence of catalyst is shown in Fig. 5b, which may be compared to that of initial rapeseed oil, Fig. 5a. FTIR spectre of rapeseed oil showed the presence of absorption bands typical of several functional groups expected in vegetable oils: esters (1746cm−1 and 1164cm−1), saturated and unsaturated alkanes (2850cm−1 and 3000cm−1). The band at 3468cm−1 typical of OH bonds of alcohols or carboxylic acids was very small showing that the initial rapeseed oil had a low free acidity, Fig. 5a. The ester bands at 1746cm−1 (CO stretch, carbonyl group) and 1164cm−1(CO stretch, acid or ester groups) were not detected in FTIR spectra of hydrogenated oil obtained at 400°C and 180min in presence of catalyst (Fig. 5b, due to cracking and hydrogenation of the ester bonds. On the other hand, the characteristic absorption bands of the CH bonds (typical of alkyl groups) are well visible in Fig. 5b, in the region between 2853cm−1 and 2956cm−1, which indicates an increase in the hydrocarbon content of the hydrogenated oil when compared to the original rapeseed oil. The OH absorption band in the region from 3400cm−1 to 3500cm−1 is also absent in the hydrogenated oil showing that the decomposition of the triglycerides to produce free fatty acids was followed by deoxygenation and/or decarboxylation reactions that converted free fatty acids in hydrocarbons. The FTIR spectra of hydrogenated oils with triglycerides conversion higher than 95% (Figs. 6 and 7) all showed a similar pattern of that of Fig. 5b. The FTIR spectra of some hydrogenated oils also showed the presence of a small amount of COOH group, which was in agreement with the presence of carboxylic acids detected by the GC-FID analysis, that will be discussed later. 3.3.2 Triglycerides conversion Hydrogenated liquid products were analysed by GC–MS to identify the main compounds present in each sample obtained at different experimental conditions and afterwards these compounds were quantified by GC-FID. The conversion of triglycerides into diglycerides, monoglycerides, and carboxylic acids and their deoxygenation to yield other compounds, such as hydrocarbons was evaluated. Depending on hydrogenation experimental conditions, the concentration of carboxylic acids in the hydrogenated oils varied between 2% and 12%. In Fig. 6 may be analysed the effect of hydrogenation temperature on triglycerides conversion in presence of catalyst. Several ranges of experimental tests were done to study the effect of experimental conditions on triglycerides destruction. In the absence of catalyst and at low reaction times, 6min, the effect of temperature was quite important, as at 200°C, triglycerides conversion was only 45%, but the rise of temperature till 300°C allowed destroying almost all triglycerides, as a conversion of around 99% was obtained. These results were expected, as in absence of catalyst and with so lower reaction times, hydrogenation reactions and destruction of triglycerides were likely to occur at a lower degree. Lower rises of triglycerides conversion were obtained for the tests done in presence of catalyst and during 120min, as even at 200°C, triglycerides conversion was around 90%. The rise of temperature till 300°C led to an almost complete destruction of these compounds, as triglycerides conversion was higher than 99%. Even at 200°C, catalyst action and the use of a reaction time of 120min allowed to double triglycerides conversion, in relation to the value obtained without catalyst and at a reaction time of only 6min. The results present in Fig. 7 show that at 400°C and even with a reaction time of only 6min triglycerides destruction was complete. Thus, the rise of reaction time till 180min had no significant effect. The same happen for the tests done in presence of CoMo catalyst. At 400°C, to achieve complete triglycerides destruction it was enough to use a low a reaction time (6min). Though the catalyst was not necessary for triglycerides destruction, its presence was advantageous to achieve a higher degree of hydrogenation and to convert rapeseed oil initial compounds into alkanes and other hydrocarbons, as will be discussed later. Fig. 7 also shows that at 200°C and in presence of catalyst, triglycerides destruction was more difficult, as when a reaction time of around 25min was tested, more than 40% of the triglycerides initial present still remained in the hydrogenated liquid. At these experimental conditions, only after 140min, was possible to achieve the complete destruction of triglycerides. Due to the high complexity of hydrogenated liquids composition and to the presence of many different compounds, most of them with very low concentrations, it was decided to evaluate composition of hydrogenated liquids, considering groups of components with the same functional groups. Five groups of compounds with relevance for the hydrogenation process were considered: triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, free fatty acids and hydrocarbons. In Fig. 8 may be analysed the effect of reaction time and temperature on hydrogenated liquids composition, in presence of catalyst and liquids composition after hydrogenation at different experimental conditions may be compared with rapeseed oil initial composition. Five groups of compounds were considered: triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, fatty acids and hydrocarbons. Rapeseed oil contained mostly triglycerides, but fatty acids and diglycerides were also detected with concentrations lower than 4%, while the contents of other compounds were below 1%. At 200°C and with a reaction time of only 6min the triglycerides content was around 50%, but it was possible to decrease this value to around 8% when the reaction time rose to 120min. The decrease of triglycerides was followed by an increase of fatty acids, which more than doubled, all the other compounds: diglycerides, monoglycerides and hydrocarbons were only detected with very small concentrations. These results indicate that at this temperature, efficient conversion of triglycerides to free fatty acids was achieved, but almost no deoxygenation reactions occurred. For a reaction time of 6min, the rise of hydrogenation temperature from 200 to 300°C led to a great decrease of triglycerides and to the consequent formation of fatty acids, due to incomplete hydrogenation reactions. It was also detected some formation of hydrocarbons, but at very low contents. At 300°C, the rise of reaction time to 120min led to complete destruction of triglycerides and to some decrease of fatty acids. It was also observed that hydrocarbons contents increased to values around 20%. The presence of triglycerides was not detected at 400°C and the compounds analysed with the highest concentrations were hydrocarbons. Very small contents of diglycerides and monoglycerides were detected for reaction times till 25min. With the rise of reaction times to 120min, these compounds were almost all destructed and even the contents of fatty acids were reduced from 30% at 6min to around 1% at 120min. On the contrary, hydrocarbons were observed to increase from 54% to 97% for the same range of reaction times variation. Thus, rapeseed oil hydrogenation at 400°C during 180min and in presence of a CoMo catalyst led to the complete destruction of triglycerides and to their conversion into hydrocarbons. In absence of catalyst and at similar experimental conditions, 400°C and 120min, the complete destruction of triglycerides was also achieved, though their conversion into hydrocarbons was lower and a considerable formation of fatty acids was observed. Thus, catalyst presence was important, to attain the complete conversion of triglycerides into hydrocarbons. The results obtained seem to indicate that triglycerides destruction and its conversion into fatty acids occurred even without catalyst, however catalyst presence was necessary to covert fatty acids into hydrocarbons. Thus, a two step process seems to have happened, during the first one triglycerides were transformed into fatty acids, which afterwards reacted to originate hydrocarbons. This study allowed the identification of chemical bonds more vulnerable to be broken and also the understanding of possible routes for reactional mechanism. However, the development of a more complete reactional pathway, the calculation of reaction rates and the determination of kinetic parameters, like activation energy and frequency factor will be the aim of a future paper. These results agree with those obtained by Šimácˇek et al. [4], who reported monoglycerides and diglycerides contents below 0.1%, triglycerides under 0.8% and hydrocarbons concentrations above 95%. However, these authors used a flow reactor and higher hydrogenation pressure, 7 and 15MPa, which were experimental conditions more favourable for the production of hydrocarbons in the range of those of gas oils. 3.3.3 GC–MS and GC-FID analysis As the hydrogenation at 400°C led to the highest conversation into hydrocarbons, in Fig. 9 are shown hydrocarbons distribution into aromatics and aliphatic compounds. In aliphatic compounds were included saturated compounds (alkanes) or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). Aliphatic carbon atoms can be bonded in straight chains, branched chains, or cyclic rings (non-aromatic). High contents of aromatic compounds were detected for all the experimental conditions presented in Fig. 9. The formation of aromatic compounds was favoured by the increase of reaction time, at 6min 70% of the hydrocarbons obtained were aliphatic compounds, while at 180min aromatic compounds reached contents around 50%. The catalyst presence also favoured the formation of aromatics compounds, as the comparison of hydrogenated liquid obtained at 400°C and during 120min showed that without catalyst, aliphatic compounds were higher than aromatics, while in presence of catalyst the content of both aliphatic and aromatics compounds were around 50%. As mentioned before, hydrogenation of rapeseed oil in presence of catalyst, at 400°C and during 120 and 180min allowed converting the initial product in high contents of hydrocarbons, respectively more than 90% and 95%. These samples analysis showed the presence of many aliphatic hydrocarbons, with number of carbon atoms from C7 to C18. In Fig. 10 may be analysed the effect of reaction time on liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons composition obtained at 400°C. In general, the rise of reaction time led to an increase in lower hydrocarbons, as the formation of C7 C11 seemed to have been favoured. Probably because cracking reactions were promoted by catalyst action and by longer reaction times. These results agree with those reported by Smejkal et al. [15], who observed that a low H2/oil ratio at these range of temperatures favoured isomerisation and cracking reactions. In Fig. 10 may also be observed that there was not a clear tendency about the effect of reaction time on the formation of C12–C14 hydrocarbons. However, the rise of reaction time led to a decrease on C15–C18 hydrocarbons contents, probably because the further cracking of these molecules led to the formation of lighter ones (C7 C11). The presence of C17–C18 in the hydrogenated oils is very important for its utilisation as biofuel to substitute gas oil. In rapeseed oil as in other vegetable oils, most of the fatty acids bound in triglycerides have 18 carbon atoms in the molecule, thus the selectivity to C18/C17 may give useful information about how the hydrodeoxygenation and decarboxylation reactions proceed during the hydrogenation process [2]. In Fig. 10 may be observed that the aliphatic hydrocarbon obtained with the highest concentration for experiment done during 6 and 25min was C17, but the rise of reaction time led to significant decreases of both C17 and C18. Though, the increase of reaction time favoured rapeseed oil conversion into hydrocarbons, the rise of reaction time from 25 till 180min led to decreases in C17 and C18 contents of around 72% and 63%, respectively. Probably, the rise of reaction time favoured cracking reactions and longer hydrocarbons initially formed were converted into smaller ones. Though the same hydrogen initial pressure was used for all hydrogenation experimental tests, the rise of reaction time led to higher releases of gaseous products, Fig. 3, and consequently an increase in reaction pressure was observed, which might be responsible for further cracking reactions. In the hydrogenation experiment done during 6min the average reaction pressure attained was 3.8MPa, while the corresponding value attained during the hydrogenation experiment at 180min was 63% higher. On the other hand, the rise of reaction pressure was not followed by an increase in hydrogen partial pressure, because the further release of gaseous products led to a decrease in hydrogen partial pressure, which might explain the higher contents of heptadecane in relation to octadecane [15]. Probably, the results obtained were also a consequence of the reactor design used. Mass transfer reactions were more difficult in a batch reactor, which prevented hydrogenation reaction to further occur, on the other hand, the permanence of hydrocarbons inside the reactor during long periods might have promoted cracking reactions, thus, favouring the conversion of hydrocarbons initial formed into smaller molecules. Šimácˇek et al. [4] used more favourable experimental conditions (a flow reactor, higher hydrogenation pressure, 7 and 15MPa and NiMo/alumina catalyst) and consequently n-heptadecane concentrations between 10.5% and 24.9% and n-octadecane contents from 51.8% and 78.2% were obtained. Sotelo-Boyás et al. [7] stated that after rapeseed oil hydrogenation in presence of NiMo/Al2O3 during 3h at 350°C and with an hydrogen initial pressure of 8–9MPa, the main compounds formed were single-branched C17 and C18 alkanes, though, other n-alkanes and iso-alkanes, between C15 and C24 were detected in much lower concentrations. These authors also observed that the rise of initial hydrogen pressure from 8 to 10MPa clearly favoured the formation of n-heptadecane and n-octadecane. On the other hand, the rise of temperature from 350 to 400°C decreased the formation of C17 and C18 alkanes, which agrees with the results presented in Fig. 10. The comparison of aliphatic hydrocarbons composition obtained by hydrogenation at 400°C and 120min, in absence and in presence of catalyst, showed that without catalysts the formation of lighter hydrocarbons was cleared favoured, probably at the expenses of heptadecane and octadecane conversion. Hydrogenation of rapeseed oil in presence of catalyst, at 400°C led to a high conversion of hydrocarbons, with a high percentage of aromatic compounds, Fig. 9. The effect of reaction time on liquid aromatic hydrocarbons composition obtained at 400°C and in presence of catalyst may be analysed in Fig. 11 . The aromatic compounds detected with higher contents were alkyl benzenes and naphthalenes. The aromatic compounds formed during hydrogenation experiment at the lowest reaction time were mainly the isomers of trimethylbenzene and tetramethylbenzene. In general, the rise of reaction time favoured the formation of most aromatic compounds, especially those with higher molecular weight and condensed aromatics such as naphthalene, methylnaphthalenes and dimethylnaphthalenes. The decrease of hydrogen partial pressure with the rise of the reaction time, together with the high temperature of hydrogenation process, might have favoured cracking and dehydrogenation reactions, which might have promoted cyclisation reactions and afterwards the formation of aromatic compounds [16,17]. The batch reactor used, might also have contribute to the formation of aromatics as a consequence of poor hydrogen diffusion through the reaction medium. On the other hand, the use of lower hydrogen pressures, below 2.5MPa, usually difficult the conversion of fatty acids into hydrocarbons [16]. On the other hand, the relative concentration of propylnaphthalene isomers decreased with the rise of reaction time, which might be due to the thermal conversion of propyl group into methyl ones, what could explain the increase observed in methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene. In Fig. 11 may also be compared the results obtained in presence and in absence of catalyst for the hydrogenation test at 400°C and during 120min. The presence of catalyst favoured the formation of most aromatic compounds, which agrees with data shown in Fig. 9. Hydrogenated liquids composition prevented its direct use in transport sector as alternative of fossil gas oil. However, its composition allows its utilisation as raw material for the production of several chemicals and in chemical synthesis."
6,Physic-chemical characterisation of hydrogenation liquid products,"3.4 Physic-chemical characterisation of hydrogenation liquid products In Fig. 12 are shown the distillation curves of hydrogenated oils obtained without catalyst, during 6min and at different hydrogenation temperatures. ASTM standard D 86 was followed to obtain these distillation curves, which may be compared with those of typical gasoline and gas oil. Hydrogenated liquids distillation curves showed a pattern similar to those of typical gas oils, which may mean that in hydrogenated liquids composition were present molecules with boiling points more similar to those of typical gas oils than to those of typical gasoline. The rise of reaction temperature from 300 to 400°C slightly moved to the right the distillation curves of hydrogenated liquids, which means that the formation of compounds with lower boiling points were favoured by the rise of temperature. However, all the distillation curves shown in Fig. 12 presented a pattern similar to those of gas oils. Liquids fraction with a distillation temperature below 250°C, changed between 36% and 70% (v/v), the highest value corresponded to the lowest hydrogenation temperature, 300°C. For these conditions was also obtained the lowest fraction with distillation temperature below 150°C, which was only 7% (v/v), whilst the values obtained for 350 and 400°C were18% and 12% (v/v), respectively. This behaviour might be due to the presence of longer molecules, as at 300°C the hydrogenation process might not have happened at a high extent. It was not possible to carry on the distillation of hydrogenated oils beyond 250°C, due to sample decomposition and the release of black smoke. This behaviour was not observed when gas oil and gasoline were distilled by the same procedure. To overcame this situation hydrogenated oils were distilled under pressure, which allowed further separation of heavier compounds without sample decomposition and the release of black smoke, as lower temperature values were used under pressure conditions. However, the comparison with conventional fuels was done at atmospheric conditions, according to ASTM standard D 86. The distillation curves shown in Fig. 12 had an initial pattern similar to that of NExBTL (Neste bio-oil), in which 30% distilled till 250°C [18]. However, around 95% of Neste bio-oil, distilled below 300°C [18], which was a quite different behaviour from Fig. 12 distillation curves. Distillation curves of organic liquid products, presented by Šimácˇek et al. [4] showed a pattern quite similar to those of gas oil, however, as mentioned before, these authors used a flow reactor and higher hydrogenation pressure, 7 and 15MPa, which favoured the hydrogenation process and the production of hydrocarbons in the range of those of gas oils. Some physic-chemical properties of hydrogenated oils were determined, according to the procedures described previously. In Table 1 may be compared rapeseed oil properties with those of hydrogenated oils obtained at 400°C, in presence and in absence of catalyst and during 120min and also with catalysts and during 180min. Though, oxygen content was determined by difference, using carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen contents, and thus experimental errors of these determinations were included in oxygen content, it is clear that catalyst presence decreased oxygen content of hydrogenated oils and that this decrease was even higher when a higher reaction time was used. These results agree fairly well with those of chemical analysis, as catalyst presence and the rise of reaction time favoured oxygenated compounds destruction. Bezergianni et al. [19] hydrocracked used cooking oil in a fixed bed reactor at 390°C and 13.7MPa for biofuels production and the hydrogenated oil had an oxygen content of 0.47%, which agrees with Table 1 results. In Table 1 may also be observed that the decrease of oxygen content was followed by a similar increase in both carbon and hydrogen, thus H/C molar ratio was the same for either rapeseed oil and hydrogenated oils obtained with different experimental conditions. In Table 2 some physic-chemical properties of rapeseed oil and other fuels [10,18,20,21] may be compared with those of hydrogenated oils obtained at different experimental conditions. Hydrogenated oil in presence of the MoCo catalyst had LHV values higher than that of rapeseed oil and similar to those of other hydrogenated oils: HVO [20] and NExBTL [18]. In absence of catalyst, the LHV value was lower and similar to that of rapeseed oil. The same tendency was also observed for density values, in absence of catalyst, hydrogenated oil density was slightly lower than that of rapeseed oil, while in presence of catalyst density values were lower and in the range of those reported for other HVOs [20]. The rise of reaction time from 120 to 180min seems to have favoured the hydrogenation process, as a slight increase in LHV and a mild decrease in density were observed. On the other hand, viscosity values of hydrogenated oils obtained in presence of catalyst were quite lower than that of HVO [20] and NExBTL [18], probably due to the high aromatic content of hydrogenated oils. The increase of reaction time from 120 to 180min led to a further decrease of viscosity, which agrees with the higher content of aromatic compounds in hydrogenated oils. These results agree with Knothe [22] that stated that the rise on carbon atoms number in biodiesel led to a higher viscosity value, while the presence of higher contents of aromatic compounds led to a decrease in this parameter. For this reason, viscosity values shown in Table 2 are quite different from those obtained by other authors. The kinematic viscosity of organic liquid products, obtained by Šimácˇek et al. [4] were between 2.4 and 4.1mm2 s−1, as the experimental conditions used, flow reactor and higher hydrogenation pressure, 7 and 15MPa, favoured the formation of hydrocarbons in the range of those of gas oils. Buzetzki et al. [6] reported that the liquid condensates obtained by rapeseed oil cracking in the presence of zeolite catalysts, presented higher viscosity and density than those allowed by standard EN 590, because of the presence of oxygenates, due to incomplete hydrogenation."
7,Conclusions,"Hydrogenation of rapeseed oil at 400°C led to high triglycerides destructions even without CoMo catalyst and when reaction times of only 6min were used. However, for lower temperatures the presence of catalyst and the use of longer reaction times allowed increasing triglycerides conversion. The experimental conditions that favoured triglycerides destruction also led to higher releases of gaseous products during hydrogenation process, as besides CO and CO2 formed during hydrogenation, cracking reactions led to the formation of small molecules that are gases at normal temperature and pressure conditions. The rise of temperature and of reaction time clearly favoured the destruction of triglycerides and its conversion into hydrocarbons. At 200°C, the rise of reaction time from 6 to 120min led to a decrease in triglycerides content from 50% to 8%, while fatty acids increased from 35% to 75% and hydrocarbons contents remained around 1%. At 300°C, triglycerides concentrations were below 1% and the rise of reaction time decreased fatty acids and increased hydrocarbons concentrations. At 400°C, the increase of reaction time was followed by a reduction in fatty acids contents and by the consequent increase of hydrocarbons concentrations, which reached values around 97%. The results obtained seem to show that triglycerides conversion occurred at a two stage process. In the first one, triglycerides were converted into fatty acids. Afterwards, fatty acids reacted to form hydrocarbons, which was favoured by further increases of temperature and of reaction time. The development of a more complete reactional pathway and the determination of kinetic parameters will be reported in a future paper. Experimental conditions that increased triglycerides conversion into hydrocarbons also favoured the formation of higher contents of aromatic compounds. When the maximum concentration of hydrocarbons was attained, 97%, their content in aromatics compounds were around 50%. Aromatics compounds detected in higher concentrations were trimethylbenzene, tetramethylbenzene, methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene. Hydrocarbons analysis showed the presence of aliphatic compounds from C7 to C18. The hydrocarbon obtained with the highest concentration was C17 for experiments done during 6 and 25min. But the increase of reaction time led to a decrease on C15–C18 contents, probably because cracking reactions of these molecules led to the formation of lighter ones (C7 C11), which were observed to increase. Longer reaction times favoured the increase of reaction pressure, but hydrogen partial pressure decreased. This, in addition to hydrogen transfer limitations, due to the batch reactor used, and to the high hydrogenation temperature, might have favoured cracking reactions, followed by cyclisation and the formation of aromatic compounds. These hypotheses allow explaining the higher contents of lighter aliphatic compounds and the high concentrations of aromatic compounds. Hydrogenated liquids composition showed that they were not suitable to be used as an alternative of fossil gas oil. Nevertheless, the presence of so many valuable hydrocarbons, including aliphatic and aromatic compounds, encourages the use of these hydrogenated liquids as a renewable raw material."
