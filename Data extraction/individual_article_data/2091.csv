0,Introduction,"In the last two decades, interest in biotechnology has increasingly focused on obtaining value-added products from low-value by-product or waste materials (Pandey et al., 2000). Lignocellulosic materials from agriculture and forest management are the most favorable substrate for bioconversion as they are renewable and abundantly available, with a potential for the production of biofuels, biochemicals and other economic by-products. Other feedstock’s suitable for conversion into biofuel and chemicals are vegetable oils. Triacylglycerides produced by plants have got attention for the last decades because to their environmental benefits and for being renewable resources (Dias et al., 2013). Plant triacylglycerides from oil crops give the integrated biorefinery a potential source of renewable fuels and chemicals (Bozell, 2008; Janssen et al., 2013). The production of renewable energy and chemicals could be obtained through a jojoba biorefinery where valuable long chain alcohols would be obtained as main products and fatty acid alkyl esters as co-product. Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) is a perennial shrub that belongs to the Simmondsiaceae family and it naturally grows in the United States, Central and South America, South Africa and many other countries. The production of oil in the extraction process of jojoba oil is usually from 45% to 55% and this oil is formed by unsaturated long-chain esters from C20 to C44 (Wisniak, 1987). This structure makes jojoba oil (JO) really interesting for partial substitution of sperm whale oil (García et al., 1995). Besides, JO and its derivatives have a wide range of industrial uses, mainly in cosmetic, pharmaceuticals, dietetic foods, animal feeding, lubrication, polishing and gardening (Shani, 1995). In addition, recently JO also has begun to appear as one of several biodiesel sources (Al-Widyan and Al-Muhtase, 2010; Bouaid et al., 2014). The most relevant drawback of JO for biodiesel production is the high viscosity and low-temperature properties of the transesterified jojoba oil (TJO), because it shows a high cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP) (Shah et al., 2010). The peculiar composition of JO has as a consequence of unique product obtained in the alcoholysis that consists of a mixture of fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) and long chain jojobyl alcohols (JA). In addition, the poor low-temperature properties in biodiesel can be solved using different improving additives (BS EN 14,214, 2003). The viscosity of TJO (mixture of JA and FAAE), so far needs to be reduced so that it will be accepted by fuel properties standards, hence it should be reduced from more than 19 to lower than 7. The separation of JA as value-added products from FAAE (biodiesel) not only reduces the FAAE viscosity and improves FAAE low-temperature properties, also allows FAAE production to become more cost-effective (Chem Systems, 2001; Sánchez et al., 2014). This oily liquid mixture of JA components of JO (cis-9-octadecenol, cis-11-eicosenol, cis-13-docosenol and cis-15-tetracosenol) are used for the topical treatment of subdermal infection such as herpes virus infections, and the transdermal delivery of pharmacological agent for the treatment of various disorders (Verbiscar, 2005). From a biorefinery perspective, it would be economically and environmentally beneficial to use the JO for production of JA as main product and FAAE as co-product. Therefore, we tried to elucidate the transesterification of JO with different short-chain alcohols and followed by separation of the JA as added-value product, of the mixture formed, by two-step crystallization. The main fuel properties of FAAE before and after the crystallization were determined. The present work also discusses the influence of JA separation and the alcohol moieties that comprise FAAE on these properties."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The main properties and composition of jojoba oil (JO) used in this work are shown in Table 1 . JO was supplied by Jojoba Israel (Israel). All the chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. Methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, hexane and diethyl ether were supplied by Sigma–Aldrich with purity higher than 99%. The catalyst used was potassium methoxide (32% purity) supplied from BASF (Spain). The K-methoxide is sold commercially by BASF in the form K-methylate. This substance is composed by 32% of K-methoxide dissolved in methanol."
3,Reaction procedure,"2.2 Reaction procedure JO transesterification using different alcohols (Scheme 1 ) was conducted by the method suggested by Bouaid et al. (2007). The reaction was conducted using excess alcohol, i.e., molar ratio of alcohol to oil of 6:1 and catalyst concentration of 1.5%. The molecular weight of Jojoba oil is 657g/mol. Potassium methoxide was dissolved in alcohol, which was added to hot oil and the reaction was carried out in batch stirred reactor of 5L with temperature is lower than boiling point of each alcohols. To avoid the emulsion formation after the transesterification reaction, 0.1% aqueous hydrochloric acid was used as a washing solution to remove catalyst (Kulkarni et al., 2007). With mild agitation in the reactor, the alcohol, catalyst and most of the soap could be removed by three washes. The complete removal of the catalyst was checked by bromophenol blue indicator. Traces of moisture and unreacted alcohol were eliminated by vacuum distillation. After the washing process, it was observed that the separation of water from ethyl, propyl and butyl esters takes longer time in comparison with methyl ester. Higher alcohols such as ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol are more prone to absorb more water during the washing process than methanol, as expressed in the literature (Lang et al., 2001)."
4,Separation of the jojobyl alcohols (JA) from fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE) by crystallization,"2.3 Separation of the jojobyl alcohols (JA) from fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE) by crystallization After the transesterification of jojoba oil with short chain alcohols followed by washing process and elimination of traces of moisture and alcohols the transesterified jojoba oil (TJO) (100g) obtained was dissolved in hot diethyl ether (200mL) and subsequently diluted with hexane (600mL). The mixture was kept at 30°C and with vigorous stirring for 10min. The phase separation and precipitation was prompted by chilling the mixture to −20°C for 24h. The solid jojobyl alcohols was swiftly eliminated by a filtration process and washed with cold hexane. This afforded a mixture of jojobyl alcohols composed of C22:1 and C24:1 in a ratio of 5.8:1. The mother liquors were concentrated by rotary evaporation, and the same procedure was repeated. In the second crystallization a mixture of jojobyl alcohols composed of C20:1, C22:1 y C24:1 in a ratio of 5.4:10:1 was obtained. The resulting mother liquor was concentrated to afford a mixture of JAAE as by-product with less than 2% of jojobyl alcohols."
5,Analytical method,"2.4 Analytical method 2.4.1 Gas chromatography (GC) Jojoba oil (JO), jojobyl alcohols (JA) and fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE), were monitored using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The injection system was split–splitless and the carrier gas was helium at a flow of 1mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 275 and 325°C, respectively. A temperature program was used starting with a 1min hold at 120°C; followed by a ramp rate of 5°C min−1–160°C and then 30°C min−1–320°C. The analysis of the standards and the reaction products were prepared dissolving the samples in CS2 and 1μL was injected into the GC equipment. The procedure used to characterize the samples was the internal standard. N-Octyl octanoate was used as internal standard. 2.4.2 Non-chromatographic analysis The rest of the methods used for the analysis of the samples are charted in Table 2 . In this table, each method is accompanied with the test performed, the standard followed, the brand name equipment used and its units."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Transesterification of jojoba oil (JO) with various alcohols,"3.1 Transesterification of jojoba oil (JO) with various alcohols The comparison between the transesterification process with different short-chain alcohols was conducted in a STR (stirred tank reactor) using methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. Hence, the transesterification of JO with four short alcohols was studied with respect to time. According to preliminary studies in our laboratory (unpublished data), we found that the optimal conditions to conduct the reaction are: a reaction temperature of 60°C for methanol, 75°C for ethanol, 78°C for 1-propanol and 85°C for 1-butanol, 6–8h of reaction time, alcohol:oil ratio of 6:1 and an initial catalyst percent of 1.5% of the whole initial mass put into the reactor. The time course changes of JO conversion with methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol are shown in Fig. 1 . On one hand, the oil conversion in the methanolysis of JO was higher regarding the other alcohols tested. On the other hand, the lowest rate of reaction is obtained in the transesterification using 1-butanol. It took 8h to obtain more than of 90% of JO conversion. The reactivity of the used ions has the following tendency: methoxide>ethoxide>propoxyde>butoxyde, respectively. With increasing length of the carbon chain of the alkoxide anion, the decrease of nucleophilicity occurs, resulting in a reduction in the reactivity of butoxide in comparison con methoxide (Sridharan and Mathai, 1974) can also explain the low conversion of jojoba oil with butanol due to the low miscibility of this blend comparing it with that of jojoba oil and methanol. The reaction rates of transesterification of JO with 1-propanol and 1-butanol alcohols were lower than that with methanol and ethanol. JO conversion was as low as 70% in most of the cases until 2h and with time the ester content increases to about 90%."
8,Separation of JA from FAAE,"3.2 Separation of JA from FAAE The fatty acid component of jojoba oil (JO) primarily consists of eiconenoic, erucic, and oleic acids with cis-11-eicosenol, cis-13-docosenol and cis-15-tetracosenol principally composing the alcohol component. The peculiar structure of JO entails the production of JA and FAAE in a mixture form. The fluidity properties of this mixture such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point and cold filter plugging point were not adequate for using this mixture as biodiesel. These properties were much better than that of the raw JO, because shorter molecules were created after the alcoholysis reaction but still they did not fulfil the requirements marked in the European standard EN 14,214 (BS EN 14,214, 2003). The poor fluidity properties of the mixture are mainly to the fatty alcohols that present strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The feasibility of a biodiesel plant using JO as raw material is limited because the high cost of the oil and the low selling price of FAAE and it directly depends on the value of JA. The JA is much less soluble than their corresponding FAAE counterparts and may be partially separated from a mixture containing both compounds. Therefore, crystallization at low temperatures has been a useful method of separation JA from their corresponding FAAE. Preliminary study in our laboratory has been carried out in order to evaluate the separation of the JA from the FAAE using different solvents (Aracil et al., 2013). The JA recovered varied greatly depending on the crystallization solvents and the alcohols used in transesterification reaction (Aracil et al., 2013). In this study, the chosen solvents to perform the crystallization were binary systems of hexane/diethyl ether in 3:1 proportion. This binary system was able to achieve greater than 94% of JA recovered for the four alcohols used in the transesterification reaction. The best percentage of jojobyl alcohols achieved, was obtained, when the butyl alcohols was used as transesterification agent. Fig. 2 shows the gas chromatogram of the main raw material or JO (a). GC/MS also showing the TJO (b) and jojobyl alcohols (cis-11-eicosenol; cis-13-docosenol; cis-15-tetracosenol) resulting from the two-step crystallization (c). As shown in the gas chromatogram, the JO is a perfect source of long-chain unsaturated alcohols which have pharmaceutical properties, and therefore, a high-added value."
9,Performance test of FAAE,"3.3 Performance test of FAAE The performances of different FAAE prepared by methanolysis, ethanolysis, propanolysis and butanolysis were analyzed. Table 3 summarizes the comparison of different physico-chemical properties of TJO, FAAE and the JA, together with the requirements marked in the biodiesel standards EN 14,214 ([BS EN 14,214, 2003]14214). Next, we discuss the properties that were mostly affected by crystallization process and by the use of different short-chain alcohols in the transesterification reaction. 3.3.1 Kinematic viscosity The kinematic viscosity indicates the degree of fluidity and it is related with the low temperature properties of biodiesel as a fuel. In general terms, the fluidity properties of FAAE (blue color in Fig. 3 ) were much better than that of the transesterified jojoba oil (TJO) (green color in Fig. 4 ) as well as that of raw jojoba oil (JO) (brown color in Fig. 3). The high kinematic viscosity of TJO was largely a result of the long-chain jojobyl alcohols (see Table 1), that, in part, comprise TJO, because shorter molecules were created after the alcoholysis reaction such as JA or FAAE. For example, in the case of pure FAAE, the kinematic viscosity analysis result of alcoholysis based biodiesel showed that methanolysis (7.50cSt) resulted in biodiesel of lower kinematic viscosity than ethanolysis (8.24cSt), propanolysis (9.03cSt) or butanolysis (9.82cSt). Viscosity increases with chain length of alcohols used in transesterification reaction. 3.3.2 Low-temperature properties Low temperature properties of biodiesel are usually analyzed by three different parameters, cloud point (CP), pour point (PP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and the most used parameter to measure the low-temperature properties is the CFPP because of its higher reliability (Park et al., 2008). Pure fatty acid butyl ester (JABE) shows the best low-temperature properties, as indicated by CP and PP values of −11°C and −12°C versus −2°C and −6°C for pure fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) (Fig. 4). The same tendency was found for CFPP where FABE showed a value of −8°C versus −5°C for pure FAME. The low-temperature properties values are improved as the carbon numbers of the short-chain alcohols increased (Fig. 4). The low-temperature properties were improved when 1-butanol is used instead of methanol (−2°C, −6°C and −5°C), ethanol (−3°C, −7°C and −6°C), and 1-propanol (−6°C, −8°C and −7°C) as alcohols in the transesterification reaction. In addition, it is concluded that FAAE displayed mach better cold flow properties than the corresponding TJO (mixture of FAAE and JA). 3.3.3 Oxidative stability FAAE oxidation stabilities were maintained below 8h, and therefore, they do not meet the quality standard for biodiesel (BS EN 14214, 2003 for this property. The oxidation stabilities of FAME, FAEE, FAPE, FABE, transesterified jojoba oil (TJO) with: methanol (TJO–Me), ethanol (TJO–Et), 1-propanol (TJO–Pr) and 1-butanol (TJO–Bu) are shown in Fig. 5 . Oxidation stability is improved as the carbon numbers of the short-chain alcohols are increased. This property directly depends on the number of unsaturations and the molecular weight of the substance. Therefore, when biodiesel has the same level of unsaturation but different molecular weight (because the raw material reacts with different short-chain alcohols) the property follows this tendency: the higher the molecular weight the higher the oxidation stability. Illustrative of this point is FAME (MW∼324), FAEE (MW∼338), FAPE (MW∼352) and FABE (MW∼366), which have similar double bond content but increasing oxidation stability values (110°C) of 3.10, 4.83, 6.06 and 6.89h, respectively (Fig. 5)."
10,Jojoba oil valorization process,"3.4 Jojoba oil valorization process The process design for jojobyl alcohols and fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) from JO was converted to the block flow diagram as shown in Fig. 6 . As seen in Fig. 6, there are three different stages in this process. First of all, the transesterified jojoba oil is produced in the transesterification reactor and the catalyst is removed by water washing. Secondly, after the reaction stage and an elimination of the excess of alcohol in the reaction product is done, two crystallization steps using organic solvents are performed in order to separate the JA from the FAAE and unreacted oil. Finally, purification of the streams was conducted using flash separators and a distillation column."
11,Conclusion,"The production of JA as high value added product and FAAE as by-product was successfully performed. This was achieved through the transesterification of jojoba oil with four short-chain alcohols followed by two-step crystallization of TJO. The mixture of JA has pharmaceutical properties against enveloped viruses which make this product highly valuable. The separation of JA from FAAE and the alcohols moieties that comprise a FAAE have considerable influence on fuel proprieties of FAAE such as cold flow properties, oxidative stability and viscosity. Generally, all the fuel properties of FAAE have been improved regarding its corresponding TJO, after the crystallization. Cold flow properties and oxidative stability were improved when other alcohols rather than methanol were used in transesterification reaction, but fluidity decreased. It has been concluded that FAAE cannot be used as biodiesel but nevertheless it can generate energy for the biorefinery making this process more efficient and environmentally-friendly."
