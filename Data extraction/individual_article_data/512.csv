0,Introduction,"Currently, the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable energy sources is a crucial research topic over the world due to the rapid consumption of traditional fossil fuels and the ever-increasing number of serious environmental issues [1]. Due to its high energy density, zero carbon emissions, and renewability, hydrogen is considered as an ideal energy source [2,3]. However, hydrogen storage in a safe and efficient way is still challenging. Traditional liquefaction hydrogen storage is neither safe nor energy saving. However, ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) can provide alternative material-based hydrogen storage, due to its high hydrogen storage capacity (19.6 wt%), high stability, and easy transportation. There are three routes to produce hydrogen from AB, namely pyrolysis [4], alcoholysis [5], and hydrolysis [6]. Among them, generation of hydrogen by AB hydrolysis has attracted intensive attention because of its mild reaction conditions and high efficiency. AB hydrolysis is extremely sluggish in the absence of catalyst [7]. Therefore, seeking a robust catalyst is necessary for hydrogen production via AB hydrolysis. Over the past decade, many scientist have discovered precious metal-based catalysts, such as Pt [8], Pd [9], Ru [10], and their alloys [11], show robust catalytic performance in AB hydrolysis. However, the scarcity and high cost of those precious metal-based catalysts have impeded large-scale applications. Thus, a great deal of effort has been made to develop cheap catalysts, such as non-precious metal-based catalysts [12,13] and oxide-based composites [14–16]. However, the catalytic performances of these catalysts are still unsatisfactory and must be improved. One popular strategy to promote the reactivity of catalysts to AB hydrolysis is to disperse the active species on proper supports. For example, Xu’s group has fabricated a catalyst of CuCo nanoparticles supported on diamine-functionalized reduced graphene (PDA-rGO) [17]. Due to the high dispersibility of CuCo nanoparticles on PDA-rGO and the synergistic interactions between Co and Cu, the Cu0.2Co0.8/PDA-rGO catalyst exhibits superior activity with a TOF value of 51.5 molH2 molcat −1 min−1. Other commonly used supports include g-C3N4 [18], carbon nanotubes [19], TiO2 [20], C [21], and Al2O3 [22]. However, each of these supports are in powder form from a macro point of view. It is highly likely that aggregation of powdery catalysts will occur when suspended in the reaction solution, leading to a decline in catalytic activity. Additionally, it is tedious and costly to recover these powdery catalysts from the reaction medium industrially, which makes the reuse of these catalysts difficult. In contrast, nanocatalysts in the form of film have advantages of high stability, good reusability, and easy separation from the reaction solution, which make film catalysts more attractive for practical applications. Additionally, the catalytic behaviors of nanocatalysts are closely associated with their morphology because of the “shape effect” [23]. It is expected that high performance nanocatalysts for AB hydrolysis can be obtained by rationally controlling their morphology. For example, Yan et al. have successfully demonstrated that CoB nanowires display significantly improved catalytic activity in AB hydrolysis compared with CoB nanoparticles [24]. Taking these factors into consideration, a film catalyst composed of a well-designed nanostructure is expected to show both superior catalytic activity and high stability in AB hydrolysis, which is highly desirable in practical applications. Herein, we describe the fabrication of a Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array supported on Ti film by chemically anchoring Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 on the film substrate via a hydrothermal method followed by a calcination process. Ti film is selected as substrate because of its cheapness and high stability in different environment. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, the nanoleaf-like array exhibits robust catalytic activity with a TOF of 60.3 min−1, which is much higher than those of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 film catalysts composed of spherical nanoparticles and unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticle catalysts. This value is even higher than those of some noble metal-containing catalysts. Notably, the nanoleaf-like array catalyst exhibits good stability without evident activity loss after seven catalytic cycles. Possessing high activity and stability, our Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array can be a promising substitute for precious metal-based catalysts in practical applications of hydrogen production."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. To prepare the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array, 0.6 mmol CuSO4·5H2O (Tianjin Baishi Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China), 0.4 mmol NiSO4·6H2O (Tianjin Baishi Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China), and 2.0 mmol CoSO4·7H2O (Tianjin Baishi Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China) were dissolved in 40.0 mL deionized water with magnetic stirring, and 3.0 mL tween 80 (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China) was added to the above solution slowly. Then, 40.0 mL NaOH (2.5 mol/L) (Taishan Yueqiao Chemical Reagent plastics Co.Ltd., Jiangmen, China) was added to the above solution drop by drop. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was transferred to a 100.0 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, in which a Ti film (Qingyuan Metallic materials Co., Ltd., Xingtai, China) of 5 × 12 cm was placed in advance, and heated at 393 K for 12 h. After the reaction was completed, the product was washed thoroughly with deionized water and alcohol and dried in the oven at 333 K for 24 h. Finally, the obtained product was calcined at 773 K for 2 h. The fabrication process of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticle film is similar to that of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array mentioned above, except that the Cu, Ni, and Co sources are substituted by CuCl2·2H2O (Xilong Chemical Co. LTD., Shantou, China), NiCl2·6H2O (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China), and Co(Ac)2·4H2O (Tianjin Baishi Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China), respectively. In addition, 0.5 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China) was used instead of tween 80. The fabrication process of unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles is also similar to that of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array, except that tween 80 is replaced by 2.0 mmol sodium citrate (Tianjin Baishi Chemical Reagent Co.Ltd., Tianjin, China), the reaction time was shortened to 8 h, and the Ti substrate was removed in the synthesis."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The crystal structure of the samples was investigated by a Rigaku Ultima Ⅳ X-ray powder diffractionmeter (XRD) using the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å and 40 kV, 40 mA). A Hitachi Su8010 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was applied to analyze the surface morphology. A FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope was applied to record the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples. The composition of the sample was measured by Spectro Arcos FHS12 Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The elements and valence states of the materials were analyzed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation. The functional groups on the surface of the obtained material were studied by a FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker TENSOR 27)."
4,Hydrogen production experiments,"2.3 Hydrogen production experiments The hydrogen production experiment was conducted in a glass vessel sealed and connected to a glass burette. Unless specified, the catalytic performance was tested at 298 K. Typically, a cut Ti film supported nanoleaf-like array (3 × 5 cm) with 2.4 mg Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 was put in 10.0 mL of deionized water. Next, 10 mL of a mixture solution containing 3 mmol (0.0926 g) of AB and 20 mmol (0.80 g) of NaOH was quickly injected into the vessel. The volume of the generated gas was monitored by recording the displacement of water in the gas burette. For comparison, the hydrolysis catalyzed by Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticle film and unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles was also carried out. No matter which material acted as a catalyst, 2.4 mg of active specie of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 was used in each experiment. To study the stability and reusability of the catalyst, the hydrolytic reaction was repeated 7 times. After the previous run of the hydrolysis, the catalyst was collected and washed. Then, freshly-prepared reaction solution was mixed with the recovered catalyst, and a new run of the catalytic hydrolysis began."
5,Results and discussion,"In this work, a Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array was prepared via a hydrothermal process followed by a calcination treatment, which is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The optical photographs of the bare Ti film and Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array are displayed in Fig. 2 a–b. Before the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array is anchored on the Ti substrate, the bare Ti film is silvery gray. After Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 anchoring, the Ti film becomes dark, which implies the successful formation of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array on the surface of Ti film. Fig. 2c–d are the SEM images of the surface of bare Ti film. As shown, bare Ti film is quite smooth on its surface. After the anchoring of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 on the Ti film, well-defined nanoleaves in the form of arrays are obtained, which are vertical to the Ti sheet. It is clear that the typical width and thickness of these nanoleaf-like sheets are 40 and 200 nm, respectively. For comparison, we also synthesized Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles supported on Ti film and unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2g–h, the sizes of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles immobilized on the Ti substrate are about 100 nm. In contrast, the mean diameters of the unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles are about 30 nm (Fig. 2i–j). For simplicity, we named these three samples as Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array, Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticle film, and Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles, respectively. The crystal structures of the three samples were analyzed with XRD, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . Notably, the quality of the XRD patterns of the nanoleaf-like array and the nanoparticle film samples is low due to the low intensity of the characteristic peaks. Thus, powder samples were analyzed instead of film samples. For comparison, the standard patterns of NiCo2O4 (PDF # 20-0781) and CuCo2O4 (PDF # 01-1155) are also shown in Fig. 3. It must be noted the standard patterns of NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 resemble each other, which is understandable since NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 have the same spinel crystal structure. Besides, Ni and Cu atoms have similar atomic radii. Therefore, substituting Ni with Cu will not result in a significant structural change. As shown in Fig. 3, each of the three samples have similar crystal structures, which match well with the standard patterns of NiCo2O4 (PDF # 20-0781) and CuCo2O4 (PDF # 01-1155). The characteristic peaks can be indexed to the crystal planes of NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4 with spinel structures. Fig. 1k shows the elemental mapping result of the nanoleaf-like array, verifying that O, Ni, Cu, and Co are homogeneously distributed. This hints that the as-synthesized nanoleaf-like array is a nanocomposite of Ni2Co2O4 and CuCo2O4 instead of a physical mixture of NiCo2O4 and CuCo2O4. The molar ratio of Ni, Cu and Co in Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 determined with ICP-AES is 0.4:0.53:2, which is very close to the designed value of 0.4:0.6:2. To understand the formation process of the nanoleaf-like array on the Ti film, the precursor of the nanoleaf-like array was analyzed with SEM and XRD. SEM images in Fig. 4 a–b indicate that the precursor has a similar morphology to the nanoleaf-like array, implying that the architecture of the nanoleaf-like array of the precursor is retained during the calcination. XRD patterns indicate the precursor is composed of Ni(OH)2, Co(OH)2, and CoCuO2 (Fig. 4c). Co2+, in either CoCuO2 or Co(OH)2, will be oxidized to Co3+ during the calcination process in air. Ni2+ and Cu2+ will retain their chemical states. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that the following reaction will take place, resulting in the formation of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4. (1) Ni2+ + 2OH− → Ni(OH)2 (2) Co2+ + 2OH− → Co(OH)2 (3) Co2+ + Cu2+ + 4OH− → CoCuO2 +2H2O (4) 0.4 Ni(OH)2 + 1.4 Co(OH)2 + 0.6 CoCuO2 + 0.5 O2 → Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 + 1.8 H2O The functional groups on the surface of the nanoleaf-like array were determined by FT-IR, and the result is shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The absorption peaks at 557 and 652 cm−1 can be indexed to Co3+- O2− and M2+- O2− (M is Ni or Cu), respectively, implying the presence of NiCo2O4 and/or CuCo2O4 in the nanoleaf-like array sample [25]. XPS analysis was performed on the nanoleaf-like array sample to investigate the surface electronic structure and chemical composition. The Ni, Cu, Co, and O elements were detected on the surface of the sample (Fig. 5 a). In the high-resolution spectrum of Ni2p, six peaks were observed. Two peaks at binding energies of ca. 880.7 and 860.7 eV can be indexed to the satellite peaks of nickel [26]. In the Ni2p3/2 region, two deconvoluted peaks at binding energies of 855.2 and 853.7 eV are assigned to the Ni3+ and Ni2+ states, respectively [27]. In the Ni2p1/2 region, two deconvoluted peaks at binding energies of 872.8 and 871.3 eV are allotted to Ni3+ and Ni2+ [28]. The result reveals that Ni3+ and Ni2+ coexist on the surface of NiCo2O4, which is in line with the XPS result of NiCo2O4 [29]. The high-resolution spectrum of Cu2p is shown in Fig. 5c. As can be seen, two satellite peaks are located at binding energies of 961.7 and 941.7 eV. Two peaks at 953.4 and 933.5 eV can be indexed to Cu2+, indicating that Cu exists as Cu2+ [30]. Similarly, two deconvoluted peaks at binding energies of 796.0 and 780.7 eV are assigned to Co2+. Another two peaks at binding energies of 794.7 and 779.6 eV are assigned to Co3+ [31]. This result demonstrates that Co2+ and Co3+ coexist on the surface of the sample, which matches well with the XPS results of NiCo2O4 [29] and CuCo2O4 [32] previously reported. The catalytic performances of the as-prepared Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array, nanoparticle film, and nanoparticles were investigated by the hydrolysis of AB at 298 K, and the results are presented in Fig. 6 a and b. It was noted that no hydrogen was generated from AB hydrolysis in the absence of catalyst. When bare Ti film was immersed into AB solution, no hydrogen generated indicating that bare Ti film is inactive to AB hydrolysis. In contrast, all three samples can catalyze AB hydrolysis. The nanoleaf-like array exhibits robust catalytic performance with the highest TOF value of 60.3 min−1 among the three catalysts. The calculation of TOF is illustrated in the Supporting Information. The hydrogen volume during hydrolysis is up to 200 mL with 20 min, very close to the theoretical value of 201.6 mL, demonstrating the complete hydrolysis of AB. In our hydrolysis system, the unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles are suspended in AB solution. Due to their high surface energy, these nanoparticles tend to aggregate to reduce surface energy and decrease the active sites of the catalyst, which will lead to a decrease in catalytic activity. To check the state of unsupported Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles, TEM analysis was carried out on the used nanoparticles and the result is shown in Figure S2. Clearly, serious aggregation of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles occurred. In contrast, the nanoleaves and nanoparticles were tightly immobilized on the surface of Ti film in the nanoleaf-like array and nanoparticle film samples. Thus, nanostructure aggregation will not occur, and the related activity loss is avoided. Considering this, it is understandable that both the nanoleaf-like array and nanoparticle film exhibit better catalytic activity than the unsupported nanoparticles. Also, the nanoleaf-like array shows higher reactivity than the nanoparticle film. This observation is likely due to the “shape effect” of the nanocatalysts. It has been widely reported that the morphology of nanocatalysts will affect their catalytic behavior to a considerable degree. In general, shape-anisotropic nanostructures possessing more edges, corners, and faces can provide more active sites for catalysis, leading to improved catalytic performance. Related to these catalysts, the nanoleaf-like array is composed of numerous nanoleaves while the nanoparticle film consists of spherical nanoparticles. It is rational to believe that the former shows higher catalytic performance than the latter. For comparison, we list the TOF values of some supported non-noble metal-based catalysts in Table 1 . It is evident that our nanoleaf-like array can be classified into the highly active noble metal-free catalyst group. Its TOF value is close to or even higher than those of some precious metal-containing catalysts, such as Pt0.68Co0.32/C (TOF = 67 molH2 molcat −1 min−1) [33], PdCu/NAs (TOF = 72.9 molH2 molcat −1 min−1) [34], PdPt nanocube nanoparticles (TOF = 50.02 molH2 molcat −1 min−1) [35], Pd@Co@MIL-101 (TOF = 51 molH2 molcat −1 min−1) [36] and Pt-CoCu@SiO2 (TOF = 51.01 molH2 molPt −1 min−1) [37]. Notably, the hydrolysis of AB in our study was carried out in the presence of NaOH because it may promote the hydrogen production [12]. For comparison, the hydrolysis of AB in the absence of NaOH was also carried out and shown in Figure S3. Clearly, the hydrolysis rate in the absence of NaOH is quite slow compared with that in the presence of NaOH, which is in good agreement with the result in previous report [13]. We also conducted a contrast catalytic experiment, in which NaOH was introduced into AB solution but no catalyst was used. It was discovered that no hydrogen was generated in that case, demonstrating that NaOH could not act as a catalyst for AB hydrolysis. According to the hydrolysis reaction of AB, (5) H3NBH3(aq) + 2H2O(l) →NH4 +(aq) + BO2 − (aq) + 2H2(g) As the hydrolysis reaction proceeds, NH4 + ions will be generated, which will be consumed by OH− by the following reaction: NH4 + + OH− → NH3 + H2O. So, OH− can enhance the hydrolysis reaction by shifting the chemical equilibrium to the right side. Notably, NH3 may be formed during the hydrolysis process in the presence of OH−. In order to detect NH3, we built an experimental set-up containing an absorption bottle for the catalysis, as shown in Figure S4a. The absorption bottle contained 10 mL dilute solution of phenolphthalein as the acid-base indicator. The reusability test described in the experiment section was carried out and the generated gas passed through the phenolphthalein solution in the absorption bottle. After finishing the 1st cycle of hydrolysis reaction, the phenolphthalein solution remained unchanged in color (Figure S4b). It was discovered that the phenolphthalein solution turned to light red during the 4th cycle (Figure S4c), hinting that a small amount of NH3 will be generated when AB hydrolysis is performed in alkaline medium for a long time. In order to determine the amount of generated NH3, the generated gas was passed through a 10 mL (0.001M) standard HCl solution in absorption bottle, by which the NH3 was captured and further determined by an acid-base titration experiment using phenolphthalein solution as indicator (please see Supporting Information). After the 4th cycle of hydrolysis reaction, the accumulated amount of generated NH3 was determined to be 2 × 10−7 mol, hinting the produced gas is almost pure H2, which is in line with the previous study [6]. It should be mentioned that NH3 can be easily removed from the produced gas by an acid solution or even water and will not contaminant the hydrogen. According to the literature [47], Cu nanoparticles in situ generated via reduction of CuSO4 by AB can act as a catalyst for AB hydrolysis. Motivate by the above work, we prepared Co, Cu, Ni, CoCu, CoNi, NiCu and CoNiCu catalysts via reduction of their corresponding sulfate by AB during hydrolysis reaction. The catalytic activity of those catalysts was tested and the results are shown in Figure S6. Evidently, their catalytic activity is much lower than the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array. On the other hand, the compositions of catalysts maybe significantly affect their catalytic activity. Thus, we synthesized a series of NixCu1-xCo2O4 array samples with different Ni/Cu ratios. The SEM images in Figure S7 confirm the morphology of NixCu1-xCo2O4 is similar to that of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array though the moral ratios of Ni/Cu have changed. However, the catalytic activity of NixCu1-xCo2O4 arrays will remarkably change as the variation of Ni/Cu rations in NixCu1-xCo2O4 (Figure S8). Obviously, Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array exhibited the highest catalytic activity among all the NixCu1-xCo2O4 samples. In this study, tween 80 acted as a surfactant in our synthetic process which can significantly affect the morphology of the resultant sample and their corresponding activity. The morphology of the sample synthesized without tween 80 is nanowire array (Figure S9) and the catalytic activity is significantly lower than that of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array (see Figure S10). The influence of the amount of nanoleaf-like array on the hydrogen evolution rate was studied in the range from 1.2 to 4.8 mg, and the result is shown in Fig. 7 a. As expected, the hydrogen evolution rate remarkably increases when more catalyst is used. It is reasonable because more catalysts mean that more active sites are available for AB dehydrogenation. Fig. 7b displays the log-scale plot of H2 production rate vs. corresponding catalyst amount. The slope of the fitting line is calculated to be 1.1, hinting that hydrogen production complies with pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to catalyst amount. The influence of AB dosage on hydrogen evolution rate is depicted in Fig. 7c. It is clear that the initial hydrogen evolution rates remain almost unchanged despite increasing AB concentrations. Fig. 7d presents the log-scale plot of hydrogen production rate constant vs. corresponding AB amount. The slope of the fitting line is estimated to be 0.2, which demonstrates that the H2 production rate complies with pseudo-zero order kinetics with respect to the amount of AB. To evaluate the apparent activation energy (E a ) of AB hydrolysis catalyzed by nanoleaf-like array, the effect of reaction temperature on the hydrogen evolution rate was studied by varying the temperature from 293 to 313 K. The apparent activation energy (E a ) of AB hydrolysis can be calculated by the Arrhenius equation: ln k = lnA − E a R T where k, A, E a , R and T is the rate constant, pre-exponential factor, apparent activation energy, molar gas constant and reaction temperature, respectively. As expected, the hydrogen evolution rate increased as the temperature increased. According to the Arrhenius equation presented in Fig. 7f, the apparent activation energy was measured to be 23.5 kJ mol−1. For comparison, E a values of some typical non-noble metal-based catalysts are listed in Table 1. According to the analysis above, the kinetic equation for AB dehydrogenation catalyzed by nanoleaf-like array can be deduced from the concentration of AB and catalyst as follows: (1) r = − d [ A B ] d t = k [ c a t a l y s t ] 1.1 [ A B ] 0.2 (2) k = A exp ( − E a R T ) → ln k = lnA − E a R T (3) r = − d [ A B ] d t = 4412712 exp ( − 2825 T ) [ c a t a l y s t ] 1.1 [ A B ] 0.2 The thermodynamic data such as activation enthalpy (ΔH), activation entropy (ΔS), the Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔG) of the catalytic reaction can be calculated based on the thermodynamic equations as follows: (4) ln k T = ln K B h + Δ S / R − Δ H R T where k is the rate constant, T is the reaction temperature, K B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), h is the Planck constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s), ΔH is activation enthalpy (kJ·mol−1), ΔS is the activation entropy (J·mol−1 K−1) and ΔG is Gibbs free energy of activation (kJ·mol−1). According the result in Fig. 8 , the thermodynamic data of ΔH and ΔS is evaluated to be 21.0 kJ mol−1 and −126.0 J mol−1 K−1 respectively. The stability of a heterogeneous catalyst over long times is of great significance in practical applications. Hence, the reusability test of the nanoleaf-like array was performed by repeating the hydrolytic reaction seven times, and the result is shown in Fig. 9 . The hydrogen evolution rate remains almost unchanged over the first five cycles. After seven cycles, the H2 evolution rate slightly decreases. This observation indicates that the catalyst of the nanoleaf-like array exhibits high stability and good recyclability. This is understandable because the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaves are tightly immobilized on the Ti film, which can help to avoid aggregation during the reaction process. The microstructures of the nanoleaf-like array after reaction were analyzed with SEM, and it was discovered that the morphology of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 remained unchanged (Figure S11). In addition, the cross-sectional morphology of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 catalyst before and after catalytic reaction was also analyzed with SEM and the results were shown in Figure S12. Clearly, the cross-sectional morphology of used Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array also remained unchanged after catalytic experiment. Both the results in Figure S11 and S12 have demonstrated the high stability of the sample."
6,Conclusion,"In this work, three types of Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanocatalysts, namely a nanoleaf-like array, a nanoparticle film, and unsupported nanoparticles were prepared. In AB hydrolysis, the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array exhibited robust catalytic performance with a turnover frequency of 60.3 min−1, which was much higher than those of the Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 particle film catalyst and the unsupported nanoparticle catalyst. This value is even higher than those of some noble metal-containing catalysts. The improved catalytic activity was attributed to both the “shape effect” of the nanocatalysts and the advantages of nanostructured film catalysts. More importantly, the nanoleaf-like array catalyst exhibits good stability without evident activity loss after seven catalytic cycles. Benefiting from its high catalytic activity and good stability, as well as its low cost, our Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2O4 nanoleaf-like array can be a good substitute for noble metal-based catalysts in hydrogen production. In addition, our work can help to inspire researchers to design high performing film catalysts towards other heterogeneous catalysis."
