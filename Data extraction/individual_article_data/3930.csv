0,Introduction,"For the past few years, semiconductor based composites are being extensively studied in the field of photocatalysis and solar energy conversion. Many studies have been reported to develop efficient photocatalysts using synthesis techniques like hydrothermal, sol–gel, mechanical mixing, chemical vapor deposition, impregnation, etc. to bring interactions between semiconductors [1–6]. TiO2 is a better photocatalyst compared to the other photo catalysts because of its band positions that are feasible for both oxidation as well as reduction of water. However, its photocatalytic activity is limited due to its high bandgap that requires UV light for excitation of charge carriers. Since its discovery, it has been modified in many ways by doping with metals like Si, Ni, Co, Bi [7–10] and non-metals like C, N, S [11,12] to improve its visible absorption. Besides expanding absorption edge of the photocatalyst towards visible region, it is also important to have control over the electron–hole recombination. Efforts are made to extend the photo response of TiO2 through charge transfer interactions with narrow bandgap ferrites. Degradation of pollutants in aqueous solutions on TiO2 based CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 [13–15] and hydrogen production on CuFe2O4 nanoparticles are reported in literature [16]. Recently, photo electrochemical water splitting to hydrogen and oxygen is observed on CaFe2O4 and TiO2 electrodes [17]. In general, ferrites are known for their magnetic properties, yet they also show photocatalytic properties for hydrogen or oxygen evolution from water. These materials have narrow bandgap of nearly 2eV that allow the absorption of a large portion of visible light. Owing to their narrow bandgap, however, recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is high and their photocatalytic activity is low. Several researchers have obtained good photocatalytic activity by coupling these narrow bandgap semiconductors with wide bandgap semiconductors [18–20]. Based on our earlier experience in making photocatalysts for hydrogen production [21–26], in the present investigation, CaFe2O4 is dispersed over TiO2 spheres. These TiO2 spheres prepared under solvothermal conditions are of hierarchical structures consisting nanosheets of TiO2 crystallites. These nanosheets are reported to facilitate high conductivity of the charge carriers along with improved quantum efficiency due to multiple reflections on TiO2 spheres [27,28]. The composite material prepared from TiO2 spheres and CaFe2O4 is used for the first time for water splitting under solar irradiation. The solid state dispersion method used retained the morphology of TiO2 spheres at the same time creating a contact with CaFe2O4 through which a synergism has been established resulting in enhanced hydrogen production activity."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts Hierarchical spheres of TiO2 nanosheets (TO) is prepared by solvothermal method as reported earlier [28] wherein, diethylenetriamine (DETA) is used as stabilizing agent and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is used as solvent for dissolving titanium isopropoxide. The reaction solution contains Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (3.6ml) dissolved in DETA (0.7ml) and 100ml IPA. The reaction mixture was taken in a 250ml Teflon container placed in a stainless steel autoclave and was kept in a furnace at 200°C for 24h. After the reaction the autoclave was taken out from the oven and allowed to cool to the room temperature. The white precipitate obtained was collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with ethanol, and dried overnight in the oven at 100°C. Thus obtained sample was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to ensure the temperature of calcinations as shown in Fig. 1 . Gradual weight loss till 400°C was observed due to the organic matter present in the precursor. Based on TGA analysis the samples were calcined at 400°C for 2h. CaFe2O4 (CFO) was prepared by polymerizable complex (PC) method [29]. Citric acid of 6.4g dissolved in 100ml deionized water. Then, 7.9g calcium acetate and 40.4g ferric nitrate were added to the citric acid solution and stirred for 30min. To the above solution, 4.3g ethylene glycol was added. The final solution was stirred on a hot plate at 80°C until it converts into a polymeric gel. Finally the gel obtained was oven dried at 100°C, crushed and calcined at 300°C. The resultant powder was further calcined at 1000°C for 2h. CFTO composite was prepared by solid state dispersion method. The method involves mixing of CaFe2O4 and TiO2 in required amount using solvent ethanol in an agate mortar till the solvent is evaporated. The samples obtained were dried in oven at 100°C and calcined at 400°C for 2h. The amounts of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0wt% of CaFe2O4 are loaded over TiO2 and designated as 0.5 CFTO, 1.0 CFTO, 1.5 CFTO, 2.0 CFTO and 3.0 CFTO respectively. For comparison, CFTO composites are also prepared by loading similar amounts of CFO over commercial TiO2 (Degussa P-25) and designated as CFTO-P25. Further, 1CFTO composite was modified with silver by photo-deposition method. The catalyst (1CFTO) was suspended in aqueous methanol solution containing AgNO3 and was subjected to UV irradiation using 250W high pressure mercury vapor lamp (Phillips) for 2h. After the illumination the dark grey colored powder was collected and washed with the deionized water and dried overnight in the oven at 100°C and denoted as AgCFTO."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The catalysts prepared were characterized by techniques like TGA, XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–Vis DRS, N2 adsorption/desorption and Photoluminescence Spectra. The TGA was obtained by Leeds and Northup (USA) unit at a heat rate of 10°C/min/N2 flow using Pt & Pt-Rh (10%) differential thermocouple. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (0.1540nm). Surface area of the catalysts was measured on Autosorb 1C Quantachrome physical adsorption apparatus. UV–Vis DRS measurements were recorded in the wavelength range 200–800nm using a GBC UV–Visible Cintra 10e spectrometer with an integration sphere diffuse reflectance attachment. For SEM analysis, samples were mounted on an aluminum support using a double adhesive tape, coated with gold in HUS-SGB vacuum coating unit and observed in Hitachi S-520 SEM unit. The TEM and HRTEM studies were made on a TECNAI G2 TEM microscope equipped with a slow-scan CCD camera and at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The preparation of samples for this analysis involved sonication in ethanol for 10min and deposition on a copper grid. The photoluminescence spectra were obtained from Elico Spectrofluorometer-SL174."
4,Photocatalytic activity,"2.3 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting was carried out over TiO2, CaFe2O4 and CaFe2O4/TiO2 photocatalysts under solar light and visible light irradiation. The reaction was performed in a 100ml tube like quartz reactor with round bottom. 50mg of catalyst was added to 50ml of reaction solution in a quartz reactor and sealed with air tight rubber septum. The reactor was evacuated for 30min and then, the solution was purged with N2 gas for another 30min. The reaction was carried out under bright sun light irradiation from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. For the visible light reactions, the reactor was exposed to a Xenon arc lamp with a filter to remove light of wavelength below 400nm. The amount of H2 gas produced during the course of reaction was monitored hourly by taking the gas samples in an airtight syringe and the analysis of the sample was carried out using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with TCD detector and molecular sieve 5A column and N2 as a carrier gas."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization 3.1.1 XRD X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts prepared are shown in Fig. 2 . XRD pattern of CaFe2O4 shown in Fig. 2a matches with the documented XRD data (PCPDF No. 32-0168), indicating crystalline phase of CaFe2O4. Fig. 2b is the XRD pattern of TiO2 calcined at 400°C, which is in agreement with the anatase phase (PCPDF 71-1167). Fig. 2(c–e) are the XRD patterns of 1wt% CaFe2O4/TiO2 photocatalysts calcined at 400, 500 and 600°C respectively. The anatase phase is intact even up to 600°C calcination temperature. The TiO2 crystallite size of the composite is seen increasing with calcination temperature as reported in Table 1 . 3.1.2 SEM SEM image in Fig. 3 a shows aggregated particles of CaFe2O4 whereas, Fig. 3(b and c) shows the spherical morphology of TiO2 with particle size of 1–2μm. Fig. 3(d–f) are the SEM images of the 1wt% CaFe2O4/TiO2 calcined at 400, 500, 600°C respectively. The SEM evidences the fact that the spherical structure of the TiO2 is deformed at high calcination temperatures. 3.1.3 TEM TEM image of the bare TiO2 (TO) is shown in Fig. 4 (a and b). TiO2 has spherical morphology with small crystal projections on the surface of the spheres. These structures are established to be hierarchical spheres formed from ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets [28]. As these nanosheets are highly flexible they can readily self organized into hierarchical structures. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of TiO2 (Fig. 4c) shows ring patterns, confirming the polycrystalline nature of TiO2 spheres. The patterns are indexed to the anatase phase of TiO2, thus substantiate the XRD data. The TEM images of 1CFTO in Fig. 4d and e shows the CaFe2O4 nano crystals on the surface of TiO2 spheres. HRTEM image shown in the Fig. 4(f) depicts the (020) plane of CaFe2O4 crystallite with a “d” spacing of 0.465nm and the (101) plane of TiO2 with a “d” spacing of 0.351nm. 3.1.4 UV–Vis DRS UV–Vis DRS of the TiO2, CaFe2O4 and CaFe2O4/TiO2 composites are shown in Fig. 5 . Bare TiO2 is showing an absorption edge around 390nm. The deep brown color of calcium ferrite powders evidence its absorption in visible light region forming absorption edge around 670nm. The bandgap of CaFe2O4 is 1.85eV calculated according to the equation E g =1239.8/λ max, where λ max and E g are the absorption maximum and the bandgap of the semiconductor. Owing to its small bandgap, CaFe2O4 absorbs a wide range of visible spectrum. As it can be seen from the spectra, the CaFe2O4 addition to TiO2 leads to the expansion of absorption of TiO2 towards the visible light region. The silver deposition on CFTO gives peak with absorption maxima at 480nm and confirms the presence of nanosilver particles on the surface of CFTO. 3.1.5 N2 adsorption/desorption Fig. 6 a illustrates the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves of the TiO2 (TO). TiO2 shows Type IV isotherms with a H2 hysteresis loop. The pore size distribution confirms that TiO2 spheres have uniform distribution of mesopores with a pore-size of about 4–7nm. Fig. 6b shows N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 1wt% CaFe2O4/TiO2 (1CFTO) calcined at 600°C. CaFe2O4/TiO2 composite shows Type IV isotherms with a H3 hysteresis that describes the increase in pore size at high temperature calcination. The wide range distribution of pore-sizes (4–15nm) depicts the trend of irregular mesopores system. 3.1.6 Photo-luminescence spectra The photo luminescence (PL) spectra are useful to disclose the information regarding the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer of photo excited free charge carriers. Since PL emission results from the recombination of photo excited charge carriers, it is a useful technique to understand the recombination nature of electron–hole pairs in semiconductor particles. The PL spectrum of 1CFTO and AgCFTO is shown in the Fig. 7 . The spectra clearly indicate that the luminescence intensity of 1CFTO was substantially reduced by Ag addition. This reveals that electron–hole recombination minimization is evidenced in AgCFTO by the deposition of silver on CFTO surface. The slower recombination process of photogenerated charge carriers will benefit the photocatalytic reaction that result in enhanced hydrogen production."
7,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity 3.2.1 Effect of CFO loading on TO Photocatalytic activity on TO, CFO and CFTO is evaluated for the production of hydrogen under solar light irradiation using methanol:water mixtures. Hydrogen production is not observed under solar light on bare CaFe2O4 (CFO) whereas, 200μmoleH2 h−1 g−1 is observed on bare TiO2 (TO). Fig. 8 a depicts the hydrogen production in 10% methanol over different wt% of CaFe2O4/TiO2 photocatalysts as a function of irradiation time. 1CFTO is showing maximum photocatalytic activity i.e., 2100μmoleH2 h−1 g−1 in aqueous methanol. Under the similar experimental conditions in the absence of scavenger i.e., in pure water, the optimum activity observed is around 92μmoleH2 h−1 g−1 on 2CFTO catalyst (Fig. 8b). Further increase in the CaFe2O4 amount resulted in decreased photocatalytic activity of CaFe2O4/TiO2 composite. When the CaFe2O4 crystallites are dispersed by SSD over high surface area TiO2, the crystallite size of CaFe2O4 tends to decrease. The highly dispersed nano crystallites show properties different from bulk such as bandgap broadening (due to size quantization) resulting in minimal electron hole recombination. As the loading increases the crystallites become bulky and tend to show the bulk characteristics such as absorption of shorter wavelengths and fast electron hole recombination. 3.2.2 Comparison of CFTO under visible and solar irradiation The photocatalytic activity of TO, CFO and 1CFTO under visible & solar light irradiation is studied and compared (Fig. 9 ). Under visible irradiation no hydrogen production is observed on CFO and a small amount of hydrogen is produced on TO (36μmoleh−1 g−1) whereas, 1CFTO showed enhanced activity for hydrogen production (577μmoleh−1 g−1). However, the activity of 1CFTO under visible light irradiation is seen decreased compared to sunlight irradiation. Though the observed activity is low under visible light than solar light, the results clearly show that both CFO and TO are playing vital role in the enhanced activity of CFTO composite. Since the aim of this work is to effectively utilize solar light, further experiments are conducted under solar light irradiation. 3.2.3 Effect of preparative conditions on CFTO activity The activity comparison between the samples prepared by mechanical mixing (1CFTO-MM) and solid state dispersion (1CFTO-SSD) is shown in Fig. 10 a. The higher activity of 1CFTO-SSD compared to 1CFTO-MM confirms an established contact between CFO and TO during the process of grinding and calcination (SSD). The improved photocatalytic performance of the composite photocatalysts is reported by several groups wherein a good contact between the semiconductors facilitated enhanced charge separation [30–32]. Based on the experimental results, it may be considered that by using a simple solid state dispersion method a contact between two semiconductors can be achieved. Since solid state dispersion method is establishing a contact between CFO and TO, it is proposed to study how the conducting properties of TiO2 influence the charge separation in CFTO composites. In general better crystallinity and high conductivity of a semiconductor plays major role in the efficient charge separation. Nanotubes and sheet like structures are found to be efficient photocatalysts because of their high conducting properties compared to the normal crystalline particles [33]. Activity comparison of CFO loaded on commercial TiO2 (CFTO-P25) and TO spheres of nanosheets (CFTO) is carried out and illustrated in Fig. 10b. Optimum activity of 810μmoleH2 h−1 g−1 is achieved for CFTO-P25 composite at 0.5wt% loading whereas, maximum activity of 2111μmoleH2 h−1 g−1 is observed for CFTO composite at 1wt% loading. The possible reasons for better activity over CFTO may be due to (i) fine dispersion of CaFe2O4 over the TiO2 spheres due to its high surface area. (ii) High conductivity of TiO2 spheres formed by crystalline nanosheets that make charge separation more facile. Moreover, multiple reflections in TiO2 spheres improve quantum efficiency. Activity of 1CFTO catalyst calcined at different temperatures 400, 500, and 600°C is also studied. It was found that with the increase in calcination temperature, the activity is decreased as shown in Fig. 10c. At high calcination temperature the deformation of TiO2 spheres of nanosheets is taking place that is evidenced in SEM images (Fig. 3). Hence, the conducting nature of the TiO2 spheres is reduced that in turn minimizes charge separation and charge mobility between semiconductors CFO and TO in the CFTO composite. This infers that to attain better activity the conducting nature of TiO2 is very important and should be retained to facilitate charge separation between the two semiconductors. 3.2.4 Effect of methanol concentration and catalyst amount In order to optimize the methanol concentration, reactions were carried out with 1CFTO catalyst using methanol:water mixtures. The results are summarized in Fig. 11 a. It is clear from the figure that the methanol concentration is affecting the production of hydrogen and methanol is actively involved in the production of H2. Maximum amount of H2 is produced in 5% methanol solution and with increase in methanol concentration no increase is seen in H2 production. The reason may be seen as that at higher concentrations the surface of the photocatalyst reaches saturation with no further increase in H2 production. Further, the catalyst amount 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0gl− 1 of 1CFTO in 5% methanol:water solution is investigated for hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 11b. It is observed that, the rate of H2 production is decreased by increasing catalyst amount from 0.1 to 1.0gl− 1. This may be seen as that the higher amount of the catalyst makes the solution opaque and obstructs the light path reaching the catalyst particles. In the present study, 0.1gl− 1 is found to be the optimum catalyst amount for maximum production of hydrogen i.e. 7820μmoleh−1 g−1. 3.2.5 Effect of silver deposition on 1CFTO activity An attempt was experimented to improve the hydrogen production activity further by photo depositing silver as a co-catalyst on CFO, TO and 1CFTO. The H2 production as a function of light irradiation time over CFO, TO and 1CFTO composite photocatalysts with Ag modification is shown in Fig. 12 . Ag deposition on TiO2 surface gives marginal improvement in the hydrogen production activity. Nano silver particles play a role of electron sinks and act as active sites for proton reduction to decrease electron–hole recombination thereby increasing the production of H2. Moreover the enhancement in activity may be attributed to the fact that the loading of silver results in the formation of Schottky barriers at Ag–TiO2 contact regions, thus promoting charge transfer and inhibiting the recombination of electron–hole pairs. The decrease in the electron–hole recombination and an increase in the charge transfer are also evidenced by PL spectral information of AgCFTO and CFTO composite depicted in Fig. 7. It is clear from the figure that the intensity of AgCFTO is lesser than CFTO, which illustrates that the recombination process is much slower in AgCFTO than that of CFTO."
8,Structure vs. charge separation vs. activity,"3.3 Structure vs. charge separation vs. activity The present study describes composite photocatalyst developed by combining a visible light-driven material (CaFe2O4) with an UV light driven photocatalyst (TiO2). Charges generated on the surface of visible active catalyst under visible light region are transferred to the surface of UV active catalyst and vice versa. In this way, the probability of recombination of electron and hole is minimized to a greater extent as both the charge carriers (electron–hole) are localized on different surfaces of photo composite, which lead to the synergistic photocatalytic activity. Based on the results obtained, a Scheme 1 has been proposed to illustrate the photoactivity of CFTO composite under visible and solar light irradiation. Under visible light irradiation, the low energy photons are harvested by CFO to produce electron and hole in conduction band (CB) and valance bands (VB) respectively. The electron thus produced is transferred to the CB of TO thereby avoiding recombination of electron and hole in CFO. The electron transferred to TO participates in the reduction of protons to produce hydrogen. At the same time, the holes in the VB of CFO oxidize sacrificial agent methanol to yield carbon dioxide. However, the situation is different under solar-light irradiation. Under these conditions both the semiconductors TO and CFO are excited by capturing UV and visible part of solar light respectively. Thus, electrons are excited from the VB of both CFO and TO to the CB. Photo-generated electrons will be transferred from the CB of CFO into the CB of TO and holes at the VB of TO to the VB of CFO. In this case, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are effectively separated and a high concentration of electrons in the CB of TO and of holes in the VB of CFO is obtained. In addition, the high charge-carrier transfer efficiency of nanosheets of TO spheres can be beneficial for the electron transportation and effectively reduce H+ to produce H2. Meanwhile, the surface deposited CFO can function as an active oxidation site, in which the assembled holes consumed by methanol sacrificial agent to produce CO2. This may be the possible reason for the activity under solar light irradiation compared to visible light irradiation. Whereas, under solar light, both semiconductors are excited and involve in the redox reactions and under visible light only one semiconductor is excited and the other one facilitates charge separation. The light absorption efficiency, electron–hole pair generation ability, effective charge transfer and charge mobility in the composite materials effect the photocatalytic properties. Thus the mobility of photogenerated electrons and holes between the two semiconductors is the key factor in getting the optimum activity of CFTO composite photo catalyst in the present investigation."
9,Conclusion,"Hierarchical spheres of self organized nanosheets of TiO2 are prepared by solvothermal method. A visible light active composite consisting these TiO2 spheres and CaFe2O4 is prepared. The composite prepared is found to be an effective catalyst for hydrogen production under solar light irradiation. The preparative conditions are playing vital role in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. A proper contact between the semiconductors of composite catalysts is achieved by SSD method in the present investigation. Also, it is found that the high conductive nature of TiO2 spheres composed of nanosheets is responsible for enhanced charge separation and charge mobility. The pronounced synergistic activity of the composite is explained by the possible mobility of charge carriers under visible and solar irradiation. Thus a structure–activity correlation is arrived."
