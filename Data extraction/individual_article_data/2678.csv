0,Introduction,"The evolution of modern society have led to several technological advances and, as a consequence, the growth in energy consumption based on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, environmental issues related to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), global warming and climate change have become a global concern [1,2]. The United Nations recognized it through the Paris Agreement and challenged countries to reduce the emission of gases in order to maintain global average temperature increase rate below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels [3]. Among the main strategies to combat climate change and greenhouse gases is to replace fossil fuels by biofuels, especially from renewable biomasses such as vegetable oils, animal fats, lignin, and acidic vegetable oils [4–6]. Biodiesel is one of the main biofuels produced today [7]. This fuel can be produced from the processes of transesterification or esterification. Transesterification is the most applied process and consists of a reaction between a triglyceride and an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst [8]. The most common raw material for biodiesel production is vegetable oils, corresponding to 95% of world production [9]. Despite this, vegetable oils have a large amount of free fatty acids in their constitution, which prevents biodiesel production by transesterification reaction using a conventional basic catalyst [10,11] evidencing a considerable disadvantage to the process. Pyrolysis/thermal cracking reactions and deoxygenation via decarboxylation and decarbonylation are considered alternative reactions for biofuels production from fatty acids. Deoxygenation of oils by either decarboxylation or decarbonylation consists of reactions based on elimination of oxygen present in the oils used as a carbon source. That can occur in the presence of a catalyst or in the presence/absence of H2 [12]. In decarboxylation reactions, the oxygenated groups are eliminated in the form of H2O and CO2, while in decarbonylation in the form of H2O and CO [13]. A disadvantage of this process is usually associated with the type of catalyst used, since expensive metals such as Pt and Pd, are commonly used as catalysts and leading to an increase in the process costs [14]. Several strategies using these type of reactions have been proposed in the literature, although most of them make use of high hydrogen pressures, suffer from the deactivation of expensive catalysts by the formation of coke, or even the low activity and selectivity in the conversion of products [15–17]. Few reports have demonstrated the activity of inexpensive Fe-based catalysts for deoxygenation reactions. Kandel, et al [18], described the conversion of fatty acids into hydrodeoxygenation product using iron nanoparticles supported on mesoporous silica. The authors showed that, initially reduced iron nanoparticles are later oxidized by the substrate's carboxylic groups during the reaction, thus converting the carboxyl to carbonyl, followed by the formation of the alcohol intermediates [18]. In another work, red mud bauxite, an iron rich tailing, was used as a multifunctional catalyst by Weber, et al [15], to upgrade complex oxygenate mixtures infast pyrolysisoil. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information about the potential usage of iron-based catalysts regarding the best temperature and time for the conversion to desired products. In this work, we describe a versatile thermal cracking reaction to produce liquid or gas fuels, using an inexpensive iron-based catalyst obtained from iron ore tailing. We explore the possibility of tunning the reaction parameters to obtain the desired products. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that iron ore tailings have been used as an active material for the cracking reaction of a fatty acid."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reactions,"2.1 Reactions The iron ore tailing used, from the iron ore beneficiation process, was dried at 120 °C for 48 h in an oven and used without any previous chemical treatment. The reactions using the mixture of iron ore tailing (IOT – obtained from the iron ore beneficiation process of a company in Minas Gerais - Brazil) and oleic acid (OA – Synth 99%) were carried out in a glass tube inserted in a vertical steel reactor connected in direct lines, that was sealed with a steel cap with a copper ring and connected to a second steel tube, where liquid products were collected. A pressure gauge connected to the system was used to measure the reaction pressure. The gaseous products were collected at the end of each reaction at the manometer outlet to be later injected into the chromatograph, while the solid products were collected inside the glass tube after the end of the reactions. Fig. S1 of supplementary material shows a representative scheme of the reactor. The IOT was mixed with oleic acid in a 1:1 mass ratio. The sealed steel reactor was placed in a vertical tubular oven and the pressure inside the reactor was adjusted to 12.5 bar using argon. Temperature values of 250, 350, 400 and 450 °C were used, with heating rates of 10 °C min−1 and reaction time of 3 and 12 h. At the end of the reactions, the gases were collected and immediately injected into the gaseous chromatograph. The reactor was opened after cooling, the liquid was collected and the solid was washed with hexane and dried at room temperature. Table 1 shows the conditions under which the reactions were carried out its nomenclature. All reactions were carried out using oleic acid and IOT."
3,Silica chromatographic column,"2.2 Silica chromatographic column The collected liquid products were eluted in a chromatographic column to separate fractions and remove iron compounds, such as iron oleate, which influence the characterization of other liquid compounds. For the separation, silica gel (60 (70–230 mesh, Merck) was used as stationary phase and the solvents hexane (Ciavicco – 98.5 %), ethyl acetate (CRQ – 99.9%) and methanol (Vetec – 99.8%) in different proportions as mobile phases. Table 2 shows the solvents used as a mobile phase and the proportions used to separate the fractions. A detailed description of how the column was prepared can be found in the supplementary material."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The dried IOT and the obtained solids after reactions were characterized by X-ray diffraction in a Shimadzu diffractometer, model XRD-7000 with CuKα radiation (1.5406 Å) and scanning speed of 4° min−1. The iron compounds were analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy at room temperature on a constant acceleration transducer with a 57Co/Rh source and the spectra were adjusted using the numerical program “NORMOS”. The percentage of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of the materials was determined by elemental analysis using a Perkin Elmer equipment, model 2400. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed in a Shimadzu DTG 60H under atmosphere of synthetic air or nitrogen (50 mL min−1) with heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 900 °C. The TGA sample holder was alumina and the amount of sample used was 2–4 mg. Infrared spectroscopy analyzes were performed using a PerkinElmer spectrometer, Frontier Single Range - MIR, using ATR mode. The spectra were obtained in a spectral range of 4000 to 550 cm−1, resolution of 4 cm−1 and 16 scans. The liquid products were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker AVANCE-III 400 Nanobay equipment. The samples were prepared using CDCl3 (deuterated chloroform) as solvent and TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal standard. The gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) in a Shimadzu equipment, model GC 2010 (Column Carboxen-1010), equipped with TCD and FID detectors. Equipment calibration was performed using a standard mixture containing 3.5 mol% of the gases H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, C3H8, C3H6 and C3H4 in N2."
5,Results and discussion,"In this work, we mixed oleic acid (OA) with iron ore tailing (IOT) and heating it at different time and temperature, with the formation of gaseous, liquid and solid products, as showed in Fig. 1 . The IOT was characterized by different techniques as showed in supplementary material. This tailing is mainly composed by iron (50.2 %), silica (14.1 %) and alumina (5.6 %) phases. The obtained results from the reactions between the IOT and oleic acid are presented below. Firstly, we evaluated the influence of temperature and time in the formation of the products. Subsequently, reactions in the absence of IOT were carried out to assess the importance of iron in the products formation. Iron oxides are good catalysts for different types of reactions [19,20]. It is noteworthy that in this work the IOT was not under catalytic conditions (the amount of material used was much greater than would be used under catalytic conditions). In addition, material reuse tests were not performed at the end of the reactions and the reaction mechanism to understand the role of the IOT as a catalyst was not studied."
6,Influence of temperature on reactions,"3.1 Influence of temperature on reactions Fig. 2 shows the mass distribution of solid, liquid and gaseous products considering only the initial oleic acid mass for the reaction at different temperatures. The mass distribution considering the total mass of the system are showed in Fig. S5. It is possible to observe that the temperature plays an important role in the products distribution. At 250 and 350 °C, liquid products were predominant (about 90 wt%) while gaseous were the main products in temperatures equal or above 400 °C. In order to evaluate the reaction paths and the obtained products, we characterized all fractions (solid, liquid, and gaseous) by different techniques. The solid products (same reaction codes with the prefix “S”) were composed mainly of iron species, as can be seen by XRD (Fig. 3 ). This result was expected since a very large amount of IOT was used. The changes in the iron phases during the reactions can give us some information about the paths and mechanisms in which the products are being formed. At lower reaction temperatures (250 and 350 °C), hematite (α-Fe2O3 – JCPDS 3-800) [21,22] and goethite (α-FeOOH – JCPDS 81-462) [23] are the two main iron phases. For solids produced at temperatures equal or above 400 °C, the main iron phase was magnetite (Fe3O4 – JCPDS 1-1111) [24,25] showing that there was a partial reduction of the Fe3+ into Fe2+. Besides the iron phases, XRD analysis indicated the presence of silica (SiO2 – JCPDS 3-420) and kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4 – JCPDS 78-2109) for all solid products. As XRD is not a quantitative measure, it was not possible to state whether there were any changes in the amount of phases or the formation of some amorphous new phase. Although, according to literature data, the decomposition temperature of kaolinite starts from 400 °C, but it can occur up to 800 °C [26]. The Mössbauer spectra and their hyperfine parameters (Fig. – S6 Supplementary Material) confirmed the XRD analysis, showing approximately 90 % of magnetite phase for reactions above 400 °C. Normally, the reduction of hematite occurs at temperatures equal or greater than 450 °C at atmospheric pressures. However, under different reaction conditions, such as high pressure and in the presence of gases such as CO, H2O and H2, this reactivity can be altered, decreasing this reduction temperature [27]. In addition, this reduction can occur in the presence of different reducing materials such as hydrogen, vegetable oils and carbon, which can be formed during the reaction [28]. A small percentage of maghemite phase (γ-Fe2O3) and Fe3+ is also observed and can be associated to the magnetite reoxidation, due to the high temperature and it can also occur when the solid is exposed to air after the reaction [29] (Fig. 4 ). Results of elemental analyses showed formation of a moderate amount of carbon for all solid fractions, Table 3 . Raman spectroscopy was performed for the solid SR1:1_450_3h, confirming the formation of carbon on the surface of the material (Discussion is found in the supplementary material – Fig. S7. A study in a reducing atmosphere to better understand how the chemical transformations of the IOT work in reactions could be carried out. Some results from our group showed that iron tailings undergo significant changes in a reducing atmosphere at different temperatures. In the work of Bicalho, H. [30], it was showed that the reduction of mining tailings at 450 °C led to the formation of magnetite (91%) and metallic iron (9%). In the work of Boscaglia, J. [31], it was showed that the tailings react with hydrogen at different temperatures to form different reduced phases, according to the TPR curve (Fig. S8). These results show that the temperature of 450 °C is already sufficient to reduce the hematite and goethite of IOT into magnetite. When the tailings were treated at 460 °C, the partial reduction of the iron phases to magnetite was observed. It is worth noting that the percentages and specific temperatures of the reduction of the iron phases depend considerably of the the reducer (hydrogen, carbon or other), the residence time in the reactor, the mass of material in the reactor, among others [31]. The formation of liquid fraction was observed mainly for the reactions R1:1_250_3h and R1:1_350_3h. These products were analyzed by FTIR (Fig. 5 ), thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 6 and H1 and C13) NMR (Figs. S8–S11). The spectra of oleic acid, LR1:1_250_3h and LR1:1_350_3h have some similarities. Only in the region between 1720 and 1590 cm−1 changes in the spectrum of oleic acid and liquid products can be observed. The band at 1711 cm−1, attributed to the stretching of the group –COOH of carboxylic acid observed in the three spectra decrease in intensity in the liquid products spectra. In other hand, the appearance of a new band is observed around 1600 cm−1, due to the asymmetric stretch of the group –COO-M+ from metallic carboxylates [32]. These changes can be associated to the formation of iron carboxylate. This shows that although the iron phases were not changed for reactions at lower temperatures, the formation of iron oleate indicates that at some point the iron was leached and reacted with the oleic acid. The complete bands assigned in the spectra of the Fig. 5 are described in the supplementary material. Fig. 6 showed the thermogravimetric curves of the materials in order to investigate the thermal behavior of liquids obtained from reactions (Fig. 6). It is possible to observe only a single weight loss event around 300 °C for oleic acid, corresponding to its evaporation [33]. The same mass loss event was observed around 300 °C for the liquid products, which can be associated with the presence of free oleic acid in the products. Nevertheless, another mass loss events can be seen for liquid produts at higher temperatures, indicating that oleic acid somehow react with IOT, forming other products. It is known that formation of iron oleates can occur during reaction of iron and oleic acid, where the Fe3+ cation can be coordinated to the oleic acid in a single-toothed, bidentate or bridge shape [34]. The formation of different types of iron oleates can explain the mass loss events above 300 °C, as related elsewhere [35]. These characterization techniques showed that the liquid fractions obtained in the reactions carried out at temperatures of 250 and 350 °C were formed mostly by unreacted oleic acid and iron carboxylates, formed during the reactions. The liquids were subjected to a chromatographic column, in which there was the formation of a single fraction which, when analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR spectrum, revealed to belong to the oleic acid molecule. Therefore, these reaction conditions did not favor the formation of liquid products of the biofuel type, but the iron oleate formed can be an interesting product, as it is a substrate that can be used as a precursor for other types of reactions, especially for the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles, which can vary according to the structure of the oleate produced [36]. The gaseous products were obtained as a major fraction for the reactions carried out at temperatures of 400 and 450 °C (for reactions at 250 and 350 °C are found in the supplementary material – Fig. S13, with conversions of 80 and 95 % (in mol), respectively. The distribution of those products, analyzed by gas chromatography, indicated that both temperatures led to a greater selectivity for hydrogen gas (Fig. 7 ). Asinkin, et al [37] demonstrated that the higher the reaction temperature, higher the formation of gaseous products. According to the authors the C–C bond breaking is favored with the increase in temperature, thus forming smaller and volatile species. It is noteworthy that argon and water were not evaluated in our calculations, as we used the molar percentage of products from the oleic acid substrate. In addition, it is expected that the water present as a reaction product is in low concentrations, since it was not possible to identify it in the analyzes performed. For a better understanding of the amount of water formed, additional quantification tests are needed. The high selectivity for hydrogen gas in these reactions revealed that the thermal cracking reaction of oleic acid occurred and generated hydrogen gas as the main product. According to Shim, et al [38], thermal cracking reactions of oleic acid generating hydrogen are facilitated by increasing the reaction pressure. The reaction conditions are not similar to those performed in this work, but it is an indirect comparison since we did not find works in the literature under these same conditions. Normally, in this type of reaction, hydrogen is available to participate in hydrogenation reactions that continue to occur during the process [39]. However, unlike other studies, hydrogen was observed in our products, in large amounts. Hydrogen gas is currently considered one of the most promising alternative fuels [40], by environmental and economic point of view, since it produces only water in its combustion process [41], in addition to its use in several applications, as fuel cells [42]. Thus, the formation of hydrogen as the main gaseous product in the reactions is a great advantage, since hydrogen is a fuel that depends on the use of non-renewable fossil fuels [43]. The gases produced in our work are not pure, which would increase the value of the process for us to purify these gases. However, the high selectivity and possible applications motivate us to continue and find ways to purify these gases. As previously discussed, the increase in the reaction temperature changed the distribution of liquid products to gaseous products. The formation of gaseous products was favored at higher temperatures. Liquid products were favored at lower temperatures, however, these products were unreacted oleic acid and iron oleate, not forming any fuel products. In the work of Asomaning, J. et al [44], the authors aimed to study the thermal cracking of oleic acid, varying the conditions of time and temperature, and observed that these reactions have a general tendency in which products with lower carbon chains are formed at higher temperatures and shorter times. However, the products formed can also suffer deviations and another type of trend can be observed. They showed that the best reaction conditions obtained were 390 and 410 °C for reaction times ranging from 4 to 8 h and 430 to 450 °C for reaction times from 0.5 to 1 h, in which a greater amount hydrocarbons of industrial interest were obtained as main products. In order to compare the results already obtained, reactions in the absence of IOT were also performed. Fig. 8 shows the comparison of reactions at 350 and 450 °C for 3 h, in the absence (WR1:1_350_3h and WR1:1_450_3h) and presence of IOT (R1:1_350_3h and R1:1_450_3h). It can be seen that for reactions in the absence of IOT, there was no formation of solid products. In addition, the mass balance for these reactions is mainly composed of the liquid fraction, being composed of unreacted oleic acid. In addition, only a small amount of gaseous products has been formed. As can be seen, for reaction R1:1_350_3h the presence of the tailings did not have a great effect on the distribution of the fractions obtained, the difference was only in the formation of the iron oleate, in which it was obtained as the only liquid product formed. This shows that, for these reaction conditions, the IOT was responsible for the formation of iron oleate, which may be a possible reaction intermediate, however, it did not generate other types of products. Estimated calculations considering the amount of iron oleate obtained in the liquid fraction showed that the amount of iron extracted from the IOT for the formation of iron oleate was low, ie, less than 0.1% of the total content. Unlike what happened for reactions performed at 450 °C. Since then, product distribution was quite different in the absence and presence of IOT. This shows that iron/iron oxide made an important contribution to the formation of gaseous products. The results suggest that the iron oxide influences the formation of the products, since, without the presence of the IOT, the quantity and distribution of the formed products is affected. Furthermore, an iron oleate is formed showing the interference of iron in the reaction. However, further study of these reactions would be necessary in order to understand the mechanisms of these reactions and what is the role of iron in the formation of products. From the results presented, we believe that silica and kaolinite present also in the IOT structure did not interfere in the formation of the products, as they did not undergo modification processes such as iron oxides. Works show that silica, commonly, acts as supports for metallic catalysts. In the work of Su-Un Lee, et al [45] the authors used silica-supported Ni/Al catalysts for the deoxygenation of methyl palmitate for fuel production. In the work of Nozomu, et al [46], the authors showed that the gaseous composition generated by the thermal cracking of tar using iron catalysts generated as products, alkane (C2 to C5), alkenes (C2 to C5), CO, CO2, CH4, and H2. They also showed that hematite was the iron oxide responsible for the formation of the products. In this work, iron waste was used as a source of iron for reactions. This IOT is mainly composed of the hematite and goethite phases, probably the hematite phase is responsible for the occurrence of reactions and product formations in the presence of iron tailings."
7,Influence of time on reactions,"3.2 Influence of time on reactions In order to evaluate the influence of the time in the formation of the production, we performed another test using a longer reaction time (12 h) at 350 °C. The results obtained for the reactions carried out at 350 °C for 3 h, were again used in order to compare the results. In Fig. 9 , it is shown the product distribution (wt %) for reactions at 350 °C over 3 and 12 h. Again, the IOT mass added was disregarded. It is interesting to observe that the increase in reaction time had a major impact on product distribution. While R1:1_350_3h generated practically liquid products (iron oleate and unreacted oleic acid), the increase of reaction time to 12 h led to the formation of liquid and gaseous products in similar quantities. No significant changes in the solid product distribution was observed, being responsible for less than 5 wt%. For the solid products, the elemental analysis showed a low formation of coke, less than 5 wt% (Table S2 – Supplementary Material), as it was observed for all other reactions. As already discussed, the solid SR1:1_350_3h had only the same iron species present in the IOT (hematite and goethite). However, increasing the reaction time to 12 h, part of iron(III) was reduced to iron(II) as it can be seen by the presence of magnetite in the XRD diffractogram (Fig. S13). These results were confirmed by Mössbauer Spectroscopy (Fig. S14 and Table S3), where is possible to observe the formation of magnetite fase in the reaction at 12 h. The liquid fraction was obtained in greater quantity for the reaction at 350 °C for 3 h as shown previously, however the presence of biofuels in liquid fraction was not detected. The liquid fraction obtained in the reaction R1:1_350_12h was also characterized by different techniques to evaluate the products formed during the reaction and to verify the importance of the time in the reaction. Fig. 10 shows the infrared spectra of the liquids obtained from reactions carried out at 350° C for 3 and 12 h. The spectra are similar, with only some small differences in the region between 1600 and 900 cm−1. The band at 1711 cm−1 corresponds to the symmetrical stretching of the group –COO- of carboxylic acid. The band at 1600 cm−1 corresponds to the symmetrical stretching of the group –COO-M+ bonded to the metal [32], which confirms the formation of the iron oleate, probably as an intermediate. It can be seen that these bands in the liquid spectrum of 350 °C for 12 h decreased in intensity when compared to the spectrum of 350 °C for 3 h. This suggests that both the amount of oleic acid present in the liquid and the amount of iron oleate decreased in the liquid reaction product in 12 h. Furthermore, a small band around 3006 cm−1 that is in the spectrum of the 3 h reaction belongs to the unsaturation of the oleic acid molecule. This band is absent in the 12 h reaction, suggesting that the unsaturated species no longer exists, forming stearic acid or even other acidic molecules of smaller chains. Showing that both the amount of oleic acid present in the liquid and the amount of iron oleate decreased in the liquid reaction product in 12 h. Another change that can be observed is in the region between 1500 and 1300 cm−1 corresponding to bending vibrations of –CH2 and –CH3 [33]. It can be observed that there was a change in the format and intensity of the bands when comparing the spectra. This suggests that there may have been an increase in the carbon chain of the products, or there was a formation of other products that have long carbon chains. Despite not having an intense band of iron oleate, the liquid obtained from the reaction R1:1_350_12h showed a dark brown color and was also subjected to silica column chromatography to separate the products. Fig. S15 shows the 1–4 weaknesses collected after separation. Table 4 shows the mass and percentage obtained for each fraction. The fractions collected from the chromatographic column were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all fractions can be found in the supplementary material (Figs. S16 – S23). Table 5 shows the chemical shifts obtained from analysis of 1H and 13C spectra, for the products obtained in each of the collected flasks. The spectra for the product in fration 1, showed a considerable difference when compared with the spectra of oleic acid. These spectra were associated with a long chain hydrocarbon molecule. However, NMR analysis alone is not enough to state that this is the only product, and there may be other types of products. The 13C NMR spectrum, however, showed no peak associated to carbonyl carbon and no peaks related to unsaturated carbons, confirming the absence of oleic acid. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 5 peaks. The first at 14.10 ppm corresponds to C1 and C17 terminal methyl groups, the peak at δ C 22.69 a corresponds to C2 and C16 carbons, downfield to their terminal neighbors. The peak at 29.70 corresponds to methylene groups in the middle of the long chain (C5 to C13). The other two peaks one at δ C 29.36 and δ C 31.93 correspond to carbons C4, C14 and C3, C15, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum, it was possible to observe two main peaks, the first at δ H 0.88 corresponding to the hydrogens (H1 and H17) of the methyl groups, while the other at δ H 1.26 corresponds to the methylene hydrogens of the rest of the carbon chain. The product obtained in fration 2 was associated with a ketone molecule. In the spectra it was possible to identify some characteristic peaks of this functional group. The 13C spectrum showed a peak at δ C 211 corresponding to a carbonyl of ketone (C9) and the peak at 42.85 ppm correspond to alpha carbon neighbor to carbonyl group (C8 and C10). The results obtained in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra for fractions 3 and 4 showed that in these flasks there are a mixture of products, that is, the products were not completely separated. In the spectra of fraction 3, it was possible to observe peaks related associated to carboxylic acid and ketone. In the 13C spectrum it was possible to identify the peak related to the carboxylic group at δC 180. In addition, the peaks related to the alpha carbons of the acid and ketone groups at δC 34.00 (CH2-COOH) and δC 43.00 ppm (CH2COCH2). The peaks related to the unsaturated carbon atoms from oleic acid (δ C 129 and 130) were not observed in the spectrum suggesting that the acid obtained is not oleic acid, and that a hydrogenation reaction has occurred. In the spectra of fraction 4, it was possible to identify the peaks related to ketone function (at δ C 42.83), but the peak at δ C 210 was not observed. Table 4 shows the mass and percentage obtained for each fraction. Ketone was the main product obtained from this reaction. In the work of Dieni Mansur, et al. [47], the authors used a catalyst based on iron oxide for the production of ketones from pyrolymer acid. They evaluated that the ideal reaction temperature obtained was 350 °C, which formed a greater amount of ketones, and they observed that the active phase for the formation of these substances was the hematite phase. The results obtained corroborate with ketonization reactions, in which one of the main catalysts used is iron oxides [48]. We do not know for sure what the mechanisms of these reactions would be, as we did not carry out experimental tests for such proof. Based in our results and the literature, its suggested that for the formation of ketones the mechanism happens through the ketonization reaction [49]. In this reaction, there is the formation of an intermediate, a metallic carboxylate, and later the formation of symmetrical ketones. In our case we have evidence of the formation of iron oleates as an intermediate. Cracking reactions are also taking place and a break mainly in the double bond may be occurring, given the possible formed products that were observed, such as 9-heptadecanone. Ketones play a very important role in the industrial sector. Ketones such as 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone and cyclopentenone, for example, are widely used as products in the pharmaceutical, pesticide, fuel and resin sectors [50]. In addition, many ketone reactions are being carried out as intermediate reactions for the production of long chain hydrocarbons, or not, such as gasoline and diesel [51]. As is seen in Fig. 11 , in 12 h of reaction the gaseous products represented 50 wt% of the products. Fig. 12 shows the GC characterization of the gases. For RL1:1_350_3h, gaseous products represented less than 10 wt% of the products, mainly composed of hydrogen and hydrocarbons with three carbons (C3). On the other hand, with increased time, RL1:1_350_12h was composed mainly of hydrocarbons, with 75 %mol of C3. In this case, hydrogen represented less than 5 %mol. Probably the hydrogen produced by oleic acid chain cracking was consumed in competitive hydrogenation reactions since both occur at these conditions. Lei Tant et al. [52] also observed the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons when using iron oxides based catalysts for the production of liquid fuels. Based in our results it is possible to observe that decarboxylation and decarboxylation reactions contribute to the molecule's fragmentation into CO, CO2 and short-chain hydrocarbons. In a previous work of our research group [44], hydrocarbons C3 were formed with high selectivity after thermal decomposition of iron oleate species. It was also observed the reduction of iron(III) to magnetite (Fe3O4) and wüstite (FeO). Again, reactions in the presence and absence of IOT were carried out, at 350 °C, varying the reaction time. Fig. 12 shows the distribution of the products obtained for the reactions. As previously shown, the reactions carried out at 350 °C for 3 h there was almost no difference in the distribution of the products. For the reactions carried out over a longer period of time (12 h) the mass balance was quite different for the reaction in the absence of IOT (WR1:1_350_12h) and in the presence of IOT (R1:1_350_12h). It can be observed that in the absence of IOT there was the formation of a small amount of gaseous products, which can be associated with the evaporation of oleic acid and the liquid refers only to the unreacted oleic acid. Unlike what happened with reaction R1:1_350_12h in which liquid and gaseous products were formed. This shows that iron has a great importance in this reaction, as already discussed. Iron-based materials have been widely used for Fisher-Tropsch synthesis. In these reactions, raw materials such as coal, biomass, and natural gas are used to produce liquid and gaseous fuels. In the work of Lei Tang, et al [52], the authors used iron nanoparticles encapsulated with carbon as catalysts for the production of C5 to C11 hydrocarbons with high selectivity. In the work of Fabiano de Paula, et al [53], the authors synthesized intermediates based on a mixture of iron nitrate and fatty acids, to later be used in thermal cracking for the production of biofuels. The main products obtained were long chain nitriles and hydrocarbon and hydrogen gases."
8,Considerations,"The results show that depending on the reaction conditions, different selectivities are obtained between solid, liquid and gaseous products. In addition, different products are formed. Therefore, it is possible to address the reaction conditions to obtain the desired products. Fig. 13 shows a summary of the reactions and the products obtained in each one. It can be observed that for shorter reaction temperatures and times no interesting products were obtained. For the reaction at a lower temperature and longer time, mainly liquid and gaseous products of the hydrocarbon and ketone types were obtained. Finally, in reactions at high temperatures, gaseous products were mostly produced in a shorter reaction time. The solid products obtained in all reactions, are mainly the magnetite phase, which can be an advantage, since obtaining a magnetic product facilitates phase separation. In addition, the reactions without the presence of IOT show the importance of this material for the reactions, since no product was obtained without its presence in the reaction medium, showing that time, temperature and pressure did not interfere in obtaining the products."
9,Conclusion,"Iron ore tailing was used as an iron source for the formation of iron oleate and the production of liquid and gaseous products of industrial interest by thermal cracking. For the reactions processed at different temperatures the gaseous products were the most interesting and hydrogen was the main product. For the reactions carried out at 350 °C, for long times, similar amounts of liquid and gaseous products were obtained, with the main liquid product being ketones and the main hydrocarbon gas product of type C3. For all reaction it was observed the formation of some amount of carbon as solid products. It was also observed the transformation of goethite and hematite of IOT into magnetite. The mix of solid carbon and magnetite can be a very interest material for steel industry. This work shows that iron tailings are interesting materials for the production of several types of high added value products, showing the usefulness of a tailings that would have no further use."
