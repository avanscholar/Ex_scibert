0,Introduction,"The development of a sustainable H2 economy depends on the discovery of simple, low cost and efficient technologies for H2 production. Approximately, 95% of current hydrogen production is based on steam methane reforming (SMR), which is an energy intensive process with a significant carbon footprint [1,2]. A global H2 economy based around SMR is not practical since methane is sourced primarily from natural gas, a non-renewable fossil fuel. Various alternative H2 production technologies are presently being developed [3–6], of which photocatalytic H2 production from water or biofuels using solar energy is highly promising [7,8]. Currently there is a strong drive to develop stable and efficient semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 generation. Titania (TiO2) is the archetypal semiconductor photocatalyst, and has been widely used in research studies of H2 production from water or biofuels. TiO2 exists in three different polymorphic forms, all of which have electronic band gaps in the UV region (Anatase TiO2, E g = 3.2 eV; Brookite TiO2, E g = 3.1 eV; Rutile TiO2, E g = 3.0 eV) [9]. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation with E > E g promotes electrons from the valence band of TiO2 into the conduction band, giving rise to electron–hole pairs (e−–h+). The electrons and holes can migrate to the surface of TiO2 particles and participate in surface reduction or oxidation reactions, respectively, or recombine. To be an effective photocatalyst for H2 production, the valence band of a semiconductor must be more positive than the O2/H2O redox couple (+1.23 V versus NHE), and the conduction band must be more negative than the H2O/H2 redox couple (0 V) [7]. TiO2 satisfies both these criteria. However, the hydrogen production efficiency of pure TiO2 for photocatalytic water splitting is low due to many factors including the following: (1) rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes; (2) fast back reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form H2O, and (3) the large overpotential for hydrogen production on the titania surface. Surface modification of TiO2 with noble metal co-catalysts (such as Pt, Au, Pd) [10–15], or semiconductors (such as CuO) [16–22] is very effective for suppressing electron–hole recombination, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production. In addition, sacrificial hole scavengers such as ethanol or methanol are commonly used to further enhance charge separation (e.g. CH3OH + 2h+ → HCHO + 2H+) and serve as additional proton sources for producing H2 [12–15]. Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 are particularly stable and efficient for H2 production under UV excitation, though the high cost of Pt and Au motivates the search for alternative low cost co-catalysts. The CuO/TiO2 system is particularly promising in this regard. Bandara et al. found that CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were very active for the reduction of water under sacrificial conditions (95 vol.% H2O, 5 vol.% CH3OH) and UV excitation, with the optimum CuO loading ∼5–10 wt.% [16]. The high catalytic activity was attributed to photoexcitation of electrons in the conduction bands of both CuO and TiO2, followed by migration of the conduction band electrons in TiO2 into the conduction band of CuO. The accumulation of excess electrons in the conduction band of CuO caused a negative shift in the Fermi level of CuO to give the required overvoltage necessary for efficient water reduction. Xu et al. deposited CuO on TiO2 nanotubes (Cu/Ti atom ratio = 10) by various methods, and then evaluated the H2 generation activity in methanol–water mixtures (10 vol.% CH3OH) under UV excitation [17]. Hydrogen evolution rates were 64.2–71.6 mmol g−1 h−1 depending on the preparation method. Yu et al. reported efficient hydrogen production from 0.1 M glycerol solutions on CuO-modified TiO2 surfaces under UV excitation [18]. The optimal CuO loading was around 1.3 wt.%, giving a H2 production rate of 2061 μmol g−1 h−1 (corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 13.4% at 365 nm). Yoong et al. prepared 2, 5, 10 and 15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts by the complex precipitation method for water splitting under UV excitation [19]. Highest H2 production rates were observed at a 10 wt.% CuO loading. Gombac et al. evaluated the performance of 2.5 wt.% CuO x –TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production from ethanol (1:1) and 0.1 M glycerol solutions under UV–Vis irradiation [20]. Apparent quantum yields were 27–29%, with H2 evolution rates of ∼1350 μmol g−1 h−1 for ethanol–water mixtures and 900–1000 μmol g−1 h−1 for glycerol–water mixtures. Skaf et al. examined photocatalytic H2 production from 0.1 M glycerol solutions using Pt/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2 catalysts [21]. A 1.25 wt.% Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst was ∼4 times more active than a 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst under the same testing conditions. Jin et al. found that a Eosin Y-sensitized 1 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst to be active for water splitting under visible light (λ > 420 nm) in the presence of triethanolamine (H2 production rate = 1.16 μmol/h) [22]. The process had a 5.1% apparent quantum yield. Whilst it is widely recognised that CuO facilitates charge separation and acts as a water reduction site, conjecture still exists as to the exact nature of the dispersed CuO species on TiO2, and also the optimum CuO loading for efficient H2 production. The surface chemistry of the CuO/TiO2 system has been the subject of a number of investigations to explain the excellent activity of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts [16–18,23–27]. It is generally recognised that CuO can exist in several different forms on TiO2, with the speciation depending on the CuO content and catalyst pretreatment conditions. Experimental evidence suggests that at low CuO loadings, Cu2+ is highly dispersed on TiO2 as a surface complex (or CuO monolayer), which can easily be reduced by CO or H2 at low temperatures. Xu et al. proposed that Cu2+ occupies octahedral sites in Anatase (001) planes up to a dispersion capacity of 6.98 nm−2, with oxygen ions sitting on top of Cu2+ cations for charge compensation [23]. When the CuO loading exceeds the dispersion capacity, nanocrystalline CuO begins to form. CuO itself is inactive for H2 production from water or alcohol–water mixtures under UV or visible irradiation, since the conduction band of CuO is more positive than the H2O/H2 redox potential [18]. Accordingly, the onset of CuO nanoparticle formation should coincide with a decrease in the photocatalytic activity of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production, as the presence of inert CuO nanoparticles will reduce the number of surface sites on TiO2 available for photoreactions. Experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is currently lacking, motivating the present investigation. This study aimed to systematically examine the effect of CuO loading on the photocatalytic performance of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures (80 vol.% EtOH; 20 vol.% H2O) under UV excitation. Particular emphasis is placed on characterisation of the dispersed state of CuO, and identification of the optimal CuO loading for efficient H2 generation. Finally, we aimed to compare activity of the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts and Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production, under the same testing conditions, to establish the potential of the CuO/TiO2 system for future large-scale, low cost photocatalytic H2 generation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Copper nitrate hemihydrate (98%), glycerol (≥99%), urea (≥99.5%), sodium hydroxide (≥98%), absolute ethanol (≥99.5%) were all obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. Degussa P25 TiO2 (85 wt.% anatase, 15 wt.% rutile, ≥99.5%) was obtained from a local supplier. All solutions were prepared using milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). A reference photocatalyst, 1.25 wt.% Pt/TiO2, was prepared using the deposition-precipitation with urea method described by Zanella et al. for Au/TiO2 catalysts, substituting HAuCl4·3H2O with K2PtCl6 [28]."
3,CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst preparation,"2.2 CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst preparation CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts with nominal CuO loadings of 0–15 wt.% were prepared by the complex precipitation method described by Yoong et al. [19]. Briefly, copper nitrate hemihydrate and glycerol (mole ratio of 1: 2) were added to milli Q water (200 mL) to form an aqueous copper(II)-glycerol complex. The masses of copper nitrate hemihydrate and glycerol used depended on the nominal CuO loading. P25 TiO2 (10 g) was added to the solution containing the copper(II)-glycerol complex with continuous stirring. The copper-glycerol complex was then precipitated on the TiO2 support by the dropwise addition of 0.5 M NaOH under constant stirring until pH 12. The resulting suspension was stirred for a further 1 h, then the light blue powders (presumably Cu(OH)2/TiO2) were collected by vacuum filtration. After washing repeatedly with milli-Q water, the Cu(OH)2/TiO2 powders were dried overnight at 70 °C in air. CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were obtained by calcination of the Cu(OH)2/TiO2 powders at 300 °C for 2 h."
4,CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization,"2.3 CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization TGA analyses were performed on a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermogravimetric analyzer. Photocatalyst precursors, Cu(OH)2/TiO2, were heated in air from room temperature to 1000 °C at heating rate of 10 °C/min. XRF data was taken on a Siemens SRS3000 spectrometer. Data reduction used Siemens SPECTRA 3000 software. Samples were analysed directly as powders supported on Mylar films. EPR data was collected at room temperature on a JEOL (JES-FA-200) EPR spectrometer, equipped with a variable temperature controller (ES-DVT4) and operated at 9.427 GHz and 100 kHz field modulation. Acquisition parameters were: 2.5 × 100 sweep width, time = 2 min, 0.35 × 1 modulation width, 1.40 × 100 amplitude and time constant = 0.1 and power = 5 mW. UV–Visible absorbance spectra were recorded over the range 250–900 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-240A integrating sphere attachment. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) was used as a reference standard. TEM images were collected using a TECNAI 12 transmission electron microscope. Powders samples were dispersed in absolute ethanol and then 3 μL of the resulting dispersion placed on holey carbon coated copper TEM grids for analysis. SEM images were collected on a Philips XL-30 field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEGSEM), equipped with an Oxford Instruments ISIS energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system for quantitative analysis of elements present in each sample. Specimens were mounted on double-sided carbon tape and lightly platinum sputter coated for analysis. Powder XRD patterns were taken on a Siemens D5000 Diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode X-ray tube and a curved graphite filter monochromator. XRD data was collected from 2θ = 10–90° (step 0.02°, scan rate 2° min−1) using Cu Kα X-rays (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 mA, 40 kV). Anatase and Rutile crystallite sizes (L) were determined from the powder XRD data using the Scherrer equation and line-widths of the Anatase (101) reflection at 2θ = 25.3° and Rutile (110) reflection at 2θ = 27.4°, respectively. The Rutile:Anatase ratio in the samples was determined according to the method described by Ding et al. [29]. % Rutile = 1 [ 1 + 0.8 ( I A / I R ) ] × 100 where I A is the peak intensity for the Anatase (101) reflection, and R is the peak intensity for the Rutile (110) reflection. Raman spectra were acquired over the range 2000–80 cm−1 on Renishaw Raman System 1000 Spectrometer, using an Ar+ laser (λ = 488 nm, 5 mW at the sample) as the excitation source. XPS data was collected using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer and an analysis chamber of base pressure ∼1 × 10−9 Torr. Spectra were excited using monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.69 eV), with the X-ray source operating at 150 W. Samples were gently pressed into thin pellets of ∼0.1 mm thickness for the analyses. A charge neutralisation system was used to alleviate sample charge build up during analysis. Survey scans were collected at a pass energy of 80 eV over the binding energy range 1200–0 eV, whilst core level scans were collected with a pass energy of 20 eV. The spectra were calibrated against the C 1s signal at 285.0 eV from adventitious hydrocarbons. Synchrotron XPS and NEXAFS data were taken on the Soft X-ray beamline of the Australian Synchrotron, using an elliptically polarized undulator capable of providing photons in the energy range between 90 and 2000 eV. The end station of the beamline comprised a vacuum system consisting of four interconnected chambers: (i) a load lock with heating facilities, (ii) a transfer chamber, (iii) a preparation chamber; and (iv) an analysis chamber for XPS/NEXAFS measurements of base pressure 2 × 10−10 Torr, equipped with a hemispherical analyzer, retarding field analyzer, fluorescence yield device and detector. XPS data was collected at a photon energy of 1486.7 eV, and emitted photoelectrons collected at an hemispherical analyser pass energy of 20 eV. Cu L-edge NEXAFS data was taken in both total electron yield (TEY) and partial electron yield (PEY) modes. The TEY and PEY spectra were normalized to a photo-diode current measured simultaneously to cancel any contributions originating from impurities present in the beam line which may contribute to changes in the photon intensity. The measurements were carried out in high resolution (HR) mode by increasing the photon energies in steps of 0.05 or 0.1 eV. N2 physisorption isotherms were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (−195 °C) using a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 instrument. Specific surfaces areas were calculated from the N2 adsorption data according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using P/P o values in the range 0.05–0.2 [30]. Cumulative pore volumes and pore diameters were calculated from the adsorption isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method [31]. Samples were degassed at 100 °C under vacuum for 1 h prior to the N2 physisorption measurements. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in air at room temperature using a Perkin–Elmer LS-55 Luminescence Spectrometer. A 290 nm cutoff filter was used. Spectra were excited at 310 nm and photoluminescence spectra were recorded over a range of 330–600 nm using a standard photomultiplier."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests on the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were carried out in a tubular pyrex reactor (100 mL volume). Photocatalyst (6.5 mg) was placed in the reactor and evacuated under a nitrogen flow for 30 min to remove oxygen. Ethanol (15 mL) and milli-Q water (3.75 mL) were then injected into the reactor through a rubber septum and the mixture stirred continuously in the dark for 1 h. The reactor was then exposed to UV light, supplied from a Spectraline model SB-100P/F lamp (100 W, 365 nm) at a distance of 10 cm from the reactor. The photon flux at the sample was approximately 6.5 mW cm−2 (the UV flux from the Sun is approximately 5 mW cm−2). Hydrogen evolution was monitored by taking gas head space samples (1 mL) at 20 min intervals and injecting these into a Shimadzu GC 2014 equipped with a TCD detector and Carboxen-1010 plot capillary column (L × I.D. 30 m × 0.53 mm, average thickness 30 μm). H2 produced through photoreaction was quantified against an external calibration curve. Photocatalytic tests for each sample were carried out in triplicate."
6,Results and discussions,
7,CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst characterization Fig. S1 shows TGA curves for the 1.25, 5, 10 and 15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst precursors with heating in air from room temperature to 800 °C. The precursors comprised Cu(OH)2 supported on TiO2. All samples showed a 1–2% mass loss below 200 °C due to thermal desorption of surface chemisorbed water. Between 200 and 350 °C, thermal decomposition of supported Cu(OH)2 to CuO and H2O occurs [19,20]. Mass losses in this range increased in proportion to the Cu(OH)2 content in the samples. The mass loss at ∼600 °C is due to thermal reduction of supported CuO to Cu2O [32]. The TGA data indicates that precursor calcination at 300 °C for 2 h was appropriate for preparing CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts, ensuring complete thermal reduction of supported Cu(OH)2 to CuO. Fig. 1 (a) shows a digital photograph of the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts following calcination at 300 °C for 2 h. At low CuO loadings (0.31–2.5 wt.%), the CuO/TiO2 samples were all light blue-green in colour as is typical for octahedrally coordinated Cu(II) cations [33]. At CuO loadings of 5 wt.% or greater, the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were all grey, with the intensity of grey colour increasing systematically with nominal CuO loading. CuO and TiO2 are black and white, respectively, so the grey colour of the 5–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 samples suggests the formation of CuO nanoparticles on the surface of the TiO2 support. TEM, XRD and Raman data below confirms the appearance of a discrete CuO phase for the 5–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 powders. Differences in the visual appearance of the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared at low loadings (<5 wt.% CuO) and high loadings (5 wt.% CuO and above) strongly suggests that the electronic state of Cu(II) differed between these sets of samples, a point we elaborate on in detail below. Fig. 1(b) shows the UV–Vis absorbance spectra for the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. All samples displayed intense absorption below 400 nm due the TiO2 support (E g = 3.15 eV). Deposition of CuO caused the samples to absorb strongly at visible wavelengths, though the visible absorption spectra differed considerably depending on the nominal CuO loading. At low CuO loadings (<5 wt.% CuO), absorption features at 450 nm and above 800 nm were seen, consistent with the blue-green colour of the samples (Fig. 1(a)). At higher loadings (5 wt.% CuO and above), intense absorption across the entire visible spectrum was observed, consistent with CuO nanoparticle formation (c.f. bulk CuO absorbs very strongly between 300 and 900 nm). The intensity of the CuO related peaks increased with nominal CuO loading in the range 5–15 wt.% CuO. The UV–Vis data of Fig. 1(b) qualitatively supports the suggestion that the electronic state of Cu(II) differed between the low and high CuO loading samples. The UV–Vis absorption edge energies for the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were estimated from plots of (αhυ)1/2 versus E (Fig. 1(c)). Results are presented in Table 1 . The data shows that the absorption edge for the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts progressively shifted to lower energy with increasing nominal CuO loading. XRF (Table 1) and SEM/EDAX analyses (Fig. S2) confirmed that the CuO content in the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were near identical to the nominal loadings. TEM was used to examine the dispersion of CuO over the TiO2 support as a function of CuO loading. TEM images for selected CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The TEM image for the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 2(a)) was characteristic for the P25 TiO2 support, composed of small spherical Anatase TiO2 crystallites of diameter ∼20–30 nm and larger angular crystallites of Rutile TiO2 (diameter 40–60 nm). EDAX analyses over the whole image (not shown) confirmed the presence of copper (as well as Ti and O), though no individual CuO particles were seen. This indicates that at low CuO loadings, the Cu2+ was highly dispersed over the TiO2 support. At higher loadings, particularly 10 and 15 wt.% CuO, discrete CuO nanoparticles can be seen on the TiO2 support particles (Fig. 2(b)–(d)). The average diameter of the CuO nanoparticles is approximately 2–3 nm. The CuO nanoparticles appear to develop preferentially on the Anatase TiO2 support particles. The TEM data of Fig. 2 suggests that CuO nanoparticle formation occurs only after the CuO loading has exceeded a few weight percent. Powder XRD patterns for the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts over the 2θ range 20–90° are shown in Fig. S3. The XRD patterns for all samples are dominated by peaks due to Anatase and Rutile in the TiO2 support. From the relative intensity of the Anatase (101) and Rutile (110) reflections, the Anatase:Rutile weight ratio in the P25 TiO2 support was estimated to be 6:1, in good agreement with the manufacturer's specifications. Average Anatase and Rutile particle sizes, estimated from the FWHM of the Anatase (101) and Rutile (110) reflections using the Scherrer equation, were 25 nm and 43 nm, respectively. Fig. 3 shows an expanded view of the XRD patterns in the 2θ range 30–50°, where the most intense CuO reflections occur. At CuO loadings <5 wt.% (Fig. 3(b)–(e)), no CuO peaks are seen. However, at 5 wt.% CuO and above (Fig. 3(f)–(i)), monoclinic CuO peaks appear that intensify with nominal CuO loading [26]. The XRD data confirms that the dispersed state of CuO on TiO2 undergoes a dramatic change in the CuO loading range 2.5–5 wt.%. Raman spectra for the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts (Fig. S4) qualitatively support the XRD findings. The Raman spectrum for the P25 TiO2 was dominated by bands due to Anatase TiO2 (I41/amd, D 4 h 19 ) at 141 (E g), 209 (E g), 401 (B1g), 515 (A1g/B1g unresolved doublet) and 638 cm−1 (E g) [34]. The co-existence of Rutile TiO2 (P42/mnm, D 4 h 14 ) is evident from the weak shoulder ∼451 cm−1(E g) [35]. At CuO loadings <5 wt.%, no CuO related bands are observed. From 5 to 15 wt.% CuO, new bands appear at 283, 333, and 617 cm−1 characteristic for monoclinic CuO (C2/c, C 2 h 6 ; Ag, Bg and Bg modes, respectively) [36]. The 1077 cm−1 band is not expected based on a factor group analysis of CuO, which predicts only three Raman active modes. It is a combination band which arises through multi-phonon scattering [37]. EPR spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool for probing paramagnetic nuclei, such as Cu2+ ([Ar]3d9). Fig. 4 shows EPR spectra for the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. The P25 TiO2 support gave no EPR signal, since Ti4+ is diamagnetic. For the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts, a sharp Cu2+ EPR signal was observed which intensified linearly with nominal CuO loading (Fig. 4, inset). By comparison, a crystalline CuO reference powder gave a very broad EPR signal under the same acquisition parameters [20,25,38]. Long-range dipolar coupling (dipole–dipole interactions) between Cu2+ ions in large grain crystalline CuO particles causes broadening of EPR spectral lines [27,39]. The narrow EPR signals observed for Cu2+ in the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts, even at high CuO loadings, indicates that any supported CuO particles were very small (a few nm or less), in agreement with the TEM data of Fig. 2. XPS was used to probe the near surface region chemical composition and valence state of copper in the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. In preliminary experiments, we found the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts to be very susceptible to X-ray induced beam damage, either from prolonged X-ray exposure on a lab XPS or short term exposure on a synchrotron XPS (approximately 8–9 orders of magnitude higher photon flux than a lab XPS). X-ray induced beam damage was evidenced by a progressive reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ during data acquisition (Fig. S5). Accordingly, all data reported here was collected on a lab XPS system, with a maximum X-ray exposure time of 20 min per sample. XPS studies of the CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst, where the presence of both Cu+ and Cu2+ has been claimed [16,18], should be treated with caution. Elements identified in XPS survey spectra (not shown) of the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were Cu, Ti, O and C, with the latter being due primarily to adventitious hydrocarbons. Quantitative XPS analyses were performed using peak areas of the Cu 2p, Ti 2p, O 1s and C 1s signals, results for which are presented in Table 2 . The copper content in the samples increased with the nominal CuO loading, though the Cu/Ti ratio did not increase linearly (see below). Narrow scan XPS spectra were collected over the Cu 2p (Fig. 5 ) and Ti 2p (Fig. 6 ) regions to ascertain the valence states of Cu and Ti, respectively, in the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. The Cu 2p XPS spectra for most samples were similar to that collected for a CuO reference powder, with Cu 2p3/2 = 933.7 eV and Cu 2p1/2 = 953.6 eV (2:1 area ratio). The presence of characteristic “shake up” satellites ∼7 eV above the Cu 2p peaks, further confirmed that paramagnetic Cu2+ (formally 3d9) was the dominant copper species in the samples [40]. Cu L-edge NEXAFS data (Fig. S6) further supported this conclusion [41]. The 0.63 wt.% CuO/TiO2 sample showed Cu 2p XPS binding energies characteristic for Cu2O (Cu 2p3/2 = 932.0 eV and Cu 2p1/2 = 952.0 eV), and no “shake up” satellite features (Cu+ is diamagnetic, formally [Ar]3d10) [42,43]. This observation of Cu+ by XPS is unquestionably due to Cu2+ reduction to Cu+ during data acquisition, since EPR analysis on the same sample confirmed the presence of Cu2+ (Fig. 4). Previous XPS studies of the CuO/TiO2 system similarly reported that low CuO loading samples are especially susceptible to X-ray induced beam damage [23,44,45]. As the CuO content in the samples increased, the Ti 2p signals (characteristic of Ti4+ in TiO2) were progressively attenuated (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows a plot of Cu/Ti atom ratio determined by XPS versus nominal CuO loading. At low CuO loadings, the Cu/Ti ratio increased sharply and linearly with nominal CuO content up to an extrapolated value of ∼3 wt.% CuO. Above this value, the Cu/Ti ratio also increased linearly, but with a lower slope. The data of Fig. 7 suggests that the nature of the dispersed CuO changes above 3 wt.%. Since no discrete CuO particles or phase was seen by TEM, XRD or Raman spectroscopy for the 0.31–2.5 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts, it is reasonable to assume that at these loadings Cu(II) was adsorbed either as a surface cationic species or as a CuO submonolayer on TiO2. Thus, the initial steep rise in the Cu/Ti ratio in Fig. 7 at CuO loadings <3 wt.% can be attributed to either Cu(II) or CuO monolayer development. Assuming the Cu(II) or CuO is dispersed uniformly over the TiO2 support, the thickness (d) of the dispersed layer can be calculated from the attenuation of the Ti 2p signals according to the equation [46] I = I 0 exp ( − d / λ cos θ ) where I is the measured intensity, I 0 is the intensity before attenuation, d the thickness of the CuO overlayer, λ the electron inelastic mean free path of the Ti 2p electrons, and θ is the photoelectron emission angle relative to the surface normal. At a nominal CuO loading of 3 wt.%, the ratio I/I 0 was estimated to be ∼0.86 and λ ∼1.2–1.4 nm, corresponding to an overlayer thickness of ∼0.2–0.23 nm. This is comparable to the interlayer spacing between crystallographic planes of CuO (e.g. d 002 = 0.2527 nm, d 111 = 0.2330 nm, d 200 = 0.231 nm) [JCPDS data card for monoclinic CuO, card #00-045-0937]. Thus the XPS data strongly supports the hypothesis that at low nominal CuO loadings (up to ∼3 wt.% CuO), a Cu(II) or CuO submonolayer exists on TiO2. Once monolayer formation is complete (i.e. once the nominal CuO loading is ∼3 wt.% or higher), CuO nanoparticle formation commences. Since the CuO nanoparticles are not dispersed uniformly as an overlayer on the TiO2 support, the Cu/Ti ratio no longer follows the same trend line seen at low loading region of Fig. 7. Table 1 summarises N2 physisorption data for the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. All samples, including the P25 TiO2 support had similar N2 physisorption isotherms that could be classified as Type II accordingly to IUPAC convention for adsorption isotherms. The BET surface areas of the photocatalysts generally decreased as the CuO loading increased (c.f. P25 TiO2, BET area = 48 m2 g−1; 15 wt.% CuO/TiO2, BET area = 43 m2 g−1). BJH cumulative pore volumes and BJH average pore diameters for all CuO/TiO2 samples were in the range 0.2–0.33 cm3 g−1 and 19–27 nm, respectively. CuO co-catalysts are proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production by accepting electrons photoexcited into the conduction band of TiO2 and acting as active sites for H2 generation [16–22]. To confirm the former, photoluminescence spectra were collected in air for P25 TiO2 and the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. Results are shown in Fig. 8 . P25 TiO2 gave a very intense and broad photoluminescence signal centered around 400 nm, that can be assigned to direct (X1b → X1a, 3.45 eV and X1b → X2b, 3.59 eV) and phonon-assisted indirect transitions (X1b → Γ3, 3.19 eV; Γ1b → X2b 3.05 eV; and Γ1b → X1a 2.91 eV) in Anatase TiO2 (X denotes the edge, and Γ the center, of the Brillouin Zone) [47–50]. Additional sharper features at lower energies are assigned to surface traps [51]. The intense nature of the photoluminescence signal observed for the TiO2 support indicates that rapid electron–hole pair recombination occurred following UV excitation. After deposition of CuO, the photoluminescence signal weakened, confirming that CuO effectively suppresses electron–hole pair recombination in TiO2, even at moderate CuO loadings (see Fig. 8, inset)."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests The photocatalytic activity of the 0–15 wt.% CuO/TiO2 powders for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures (80 vol.% ethanol, 20 vol.% H2O) under UV irradiation were evaluated in triplicate. Results are presented in Fig. 9 (a) and (b), and summarized in Table 1. The P25 TiO2 support displayed low photocatalytic activity for H2 production (1.2 mmol g−1 h−1), which can be attributed to fast electron–hole pair recombination in the absence of an added co-catalyst (CuO or Pt). Deposition of CuO dramatically enhanced the rate of H2 production, with the optimum loading being ∼1.25 wt.% CuO (H2 production rate of 20.3 mmol g−1 h−1). Yu et al. and Bandara et al. observed similar optimum CuO loadings in their studies of photocatalytic H2 production from methanol–water and glycerol-water solutions, respectively [16,18]. The photocatalytic activity of the 1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was comparable to that determined here for a 1.25 wt.% Pt/TiO2 (H2 production rate of 29.5 mmol g−1 h−1), confirming that CuO co-catalysts are strong candidates to replace Pt co-catalysts for solar H2 production. Further, Pt-containing photocatalysts typically require H2 reduction at 300–400 °C before use, to reduce surface cationic Pt species (Pt2+ or Pt4+) to the active metal form (Pt0). The CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts required no such H2 activation step. Also, EPR and UV–Vis analyses of post-reaction ethanol–water mixtures (not shown) revealed negligible leaching of Cu2+ ions even after prolonged UV exposure (periods up to 24 h), indicating that the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts were stable under the applied reaction conditions. Fig. 10 shows normalized rates of H2 production plotted as a function of CuO loading. At CuO loadings above 1.25 wt.%, the rate of H2 production (normalized against catalyst mass) decreased sharply. TEM, XRD and Raman data above suggested that at CuO loadings between 2.5 and 5 wt.%, CuO nanoparticle formation commenced. Pure CuO was inactive for photocatalytic hydrogen production under the test conditions used in this study (Table 1). Thus, the decreased activity of the CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts at CuO loadings above the optimal value of 1.25 wt.% is attributed to partial blockage of TiO2 sites (where ethanol photo-oxidation occurs) by supported CuO nanoparticles. The rate of H2 production per Cu atom (Fig. 10) provides strong evidence that a highly dispersed Cu(II) species on TiO2, either adsorbed cations or a CuO sub-monolayer, is the active phase for efficient H2 hydrogen generation. The highest normalized rates were observed for the 0.31–1.25 wt.% CuO/TiO2 samples. Xu et al. calculated that the dispersion capacity of CuO on TiO2 is about 6.98 Cu2+ nm−2 (or 6.98 × 1018 Cu2+ m−2) [23]. For the 1.25, 2.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts prepared in this study, the calculated dispersions are 2.0 × 1018 Cu2+ m−2, 3.9 × 1018 Cu2+ m−2 and 7.8 × 1018 Cu2+ m−2, respectively (assuming Cu2+ is adsorbed uniformly over the entire TiO2 support). Accordingly, at CuO loadings where the photocatalytic activity is highest (0.31–1.25 wt.%), copper will be adsorbed as a sub-monolayer Cu(II) or CuO species on TiO2."
9,Mechanism of photocatalytic enhancement,"3.3 Mechanism of photocatalytic enhancement On the basis of the data presented above, the mechanism by which CuO enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures can be rationalized. Fig. 11 (a) shows an energy diagram for TiO2 and various dispersed states of copper, ranging from Cu(II) or CuO sub-monolayer, to supported CuO nanoparticles of quantum size and finally to bulk CuO [18,43]. Under UV excitation, electrons are promoted from the valence bands of both TiO2 and CuO into their respective conduction bands. Holes in the valence band of TiO2 and CuO oxidise both ethanol (CH3CH2OH + 2h+ → CH3CHO + 2 H+) and H2O (H2O + 2h+ → 0.5O2 + 2H+) [14]. At low CuO loadings (<3 wt.%), copper exists as a sub-monolayer Cu(II) or CuO species on TiO2. The Fermi level for such adsorbed species is positive with respect to the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in transfer of photoexcited electrons from TiO2 to surface Cu(II) or CuO centres. The accumulation of negative charge in the Cu(II) or CuO centres facilitates H2 production, since the conduction band is more negative than the H2O/H2 redox couple. At CuO loadings above 3 wt.%, CuO nanoparticle formation occurs. The electronic band gap in nanocrystalline CuO clusters decreases with particle size. For CuO nanoparticles of size ∼3–4 nm, the band gap is around 2.3–2.6 eV (c.f bulk CuO, E g ∼ 1.3–1.5 eV, Table 1). As the CuO nanoparticle size increases, the conduction band of CuO becomes positive with respect to H+/H2 couple, preventing direct transfer of electrons from CuO to H+ or H2O. H2 formation is suppressed accordingly. The inactivity of bulk CuO for H2 production can be explained using the same rationale. A Cu(II) or CuO sub-monolayer on TiO2 is thus identified as the active site for efficient H2 generation over CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts. Fig. 11(b) shows an Anatase (001) plane, as well as CuO monolayer on Anatase(001) as proposed by Xu et al. [23]. In the latter, Cu2+ cations occupy octahedral sites, with the oxide ion of CuO sitting on top of the copper cation for charge compensation. Our results suggest that the activity of CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts is highest when the CuO coverage is approximately one-half a monolayer (i.e. when around 50% of the sites occupied by Cu2+ in Fig. 11(b) are occupied)."
10,Conclusions,"At low CuO loadings, CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and stability for H2 production from ethanol–water mixtures under UV excitation. The optimum nominal CuO loading is ∼1.25 wt.%, which afforded a H2 production rate of 20.3 mmol g−1 h−1 at UV fluxes comparable to that present in sunlight. At the optimum CuO loadings, copper is adsorbed on the TiO2 support either as a surface Cu(II) or CuO sub-monolayer, and positively enhances the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2 production by suppressing electron–hole pair recombination. Higher CuO loadings were detrimental for H2 generation due to CuO nanoparticle formation, which modified unfavourably the local electronic structure of the CuO/TiO2 interface (CuO itself was inactive for H2 production under the applied test conditions). Results demonstrate that CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts are promising low cost alternatives to Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production from biofuels."
