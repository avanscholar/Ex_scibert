0,Introduction,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the world. It affects approximately 30–45 million people and accounts for at least 60% of all clinical dementia cases. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and later behavioral and functional impairments. Neuropathologically, its two hallmark features are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and extracellular beta amyloid (Aβ)-rich plaques (Huang and Jiang, 2009). Aβ aggregates in the brain can cause inflammation, oxidative stress and eventual neuronal loss. Additionally, memory impairment may be associated with increased brain Aβ levels and/or Aβ plaque deposits (Octave and Pierrot, 2008). Beta amyloid is generated through the sequential proteolytic cleavage of a transmembrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP), by two membrane-bound proteases, beta-secretase (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme, BACE1) and the gamma-secretase complex comprising presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 (Iizuka et al., 1996; Xia et al., 1998). BACE1 mediates the initial, rate-limiting step of Aβ production via beta-cleavage of APP. Proteolysis at the β-site results in shedding of sAPPβ and the production of a membrane-bound, 99 amino acid fragment (C99). C99 can be further cleaved by gamma-secretase to generate free Aβ and APP intracellular domains. A second proteolytic pathway involves cleavage of APP at the α-site. Alpha-site cleavage results in the secretion of sAPPα and the formation of a membrane-bound 83 amino acid fragment (C83), which can be further cleaved by gamma-secretase. Endogenous alpha-secretase are enzymes belonging to a large metallopeptidase family, known as ADAM. A disintegrin metalloprotease (ADAM10) and TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE, also known as ADAM17) are both known to possess alpha-secretase activity (Allinson et al., 2003; Asai et al., 2003). Since cleavage at the alpha-secretase site results in non-pathogenic products, recent therapeutic approaches have focused on shifting cleavage activities from beta- and gamma-secretase to alpha-secretase. Historically, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was classified as a toxic gas. However, its discovery as a product of mammalian enzymatic activity has led to theories about its role as a physiologically-relevant signaling molecule. Endogenous H2S is formed from l-cysteine. There are three known enzymes that produce H2S in mammalian tissue: Cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-c-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST). The expression of CBS is primarily in the central nervous system (CNS), while CSE is primarily found in peripheral tissues, including vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle (Kimura, 2011). H2S is also produced by 3MST from l-cysteine and alpha-ketoglutarate through a metabolic pathway involving cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) (Shibuya et al., 2009). Within mammalian tissue, H2S has been shown to have anti-neuroinflammatory (Hu et al., 2007) anti-apoptotic effects (Yin et al., 2009). For example, work in a rat model of AD has shown that H2S can attenuate spatial memory impairment and neuroinflammation within the hippocampus (Xuan et al., 2012). There is also evidence for H2S possessing neuronal protective effects against both Aβ-induced cellular toxicity and oxidative stress (Liu and Bian, 2010). For instance, oxidative stress results in decreased cellular glutathione levels. H2S acts to protect neurons by reinstating glutathione levels through an enhancement of the activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and an up-regulation of cystine transport (Kimura and Kimura, 2004). The role for H2S in AD is evident in clinical populations. For instance, H2S levels are severely decreased in the plasma of AD patients compared with age-matched controls (Liu et al., 2008). Prior work by our lab has shown that administration of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), an H2S donor, decreases BACE-1 mRNA and protein levels and also Aβ1-42 release in PC12 cells (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, both in vitro and in vivo work led us to hypothesize that the absence of H2S may accelerate Aβ production and subsequent development of AD. Furthermore, H2S-releasing drugs may have therapeutic potential in AD patients. In order to validate clinical findings, H2S levels in the CNS of rodent models of AD .We characterized its levels at various time points through the development and progression of the disease. We also examined if supplementing exogenous sources of H2S would improve AD-derived memory impairments and/or reduce the production of Aβ. Finally, we sought to determine if this same exogenous application of H2S could shift APP processing away from the pathogenic beta-secretase pathway and toward the non-pathogenic alpha-secretase pathway. Our study utilized mice harboring both the APPswe and PS1dE9 mutant transgenes (Ruan et al., 2009). Past research has shown Aβ deposition occurs by 4–6months of age with a progressive increase in Aβ levels up to 12months with a corresponding similar increase in plaque number (Jankowsky et al., 2004). Cognitive impairments also coincide with the onset of Aβ plaque deposition. Thus, we focused our experimental approach between 3 and 12months of age in our double transgenic mice. NaHS was then administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 4- and 10-month old AD transgenic mice for 2months according to the development of memory impairment. We then examined the protective effects of H2S on neurons and possible mechanisms of action on the decrease in Aβ levels. While our results are promising, longitudinal studies in both animal models and patient populations will allow for a better understanding of the utility of H2S as a therapeutic agent."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Experimental procedure and sample preparation,"2.1 Experimental procedure and sample preparation Transgenic mice APP/PS1 (APPswe×PS1dE9) were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University in China. These double transgenic mice were used in experiments measuring H2S level and activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes at 3, 6, 9 and 12months of age months (n =5). Subjects were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350mg/kg, i.p.) brains were removed immediately. Tissue from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was removed to determine H2S concentration and activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes via sulfide-sensitive electrode. A second cohort of double transgenic mice provided tissue for immunohistochemical analyses of CBS protein (n =3). Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), an H2S donor, was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in sterilized water (0.001umol/L). NaHS was administered (i.p.) to 4- and 10-month old mice every other day for 60days (n =12). Control mice received identical dose saline injection. Memory function was measured through the Morris water maze, Aβ level determined via ELISA and immunohistochemical analyses. To establish a mechanism behind reduced Aβ levels, secretase protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. All procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines."
3,Measurement of H2S-synthesizing enzymatic activity,"2.2 Measurement of H2S-synthesizing enzymatic activity The activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes was measured as previously described. Brain tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 50mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 12%wt./vol) with a Polytron homogenizer. The reaction was performed in a 20-ml pyramidal bottle. The bottle contained a medium pore (diameter of 2cm, height of 2cm) which had 0.5mL of 1M sodium hydroxide. A sulfur-sensitive electrode (PXSJ-226, Shanghai, China) was used to evaluate endogenous hydrogen sulfide production rates, which presents CBS enzyme activity. 0.5mL of brain homogenate was mixed with 0.5mL of pre-cooled 50mmol/L (pH 6.8) PBS and 1mL of the reacting system solution (100mmol/L, pH 7.4 of PBS, 10mmol/L l-cysteine, 2mmol/L phosphate pyridoxine aldehyde). After determination of protein concentration, 2mL of the solution was then moved to the pyramidal bottle. The 1M sodium hydroxide within the pore was used to trap H2S and did not come into contact with the brain homogenate. The sealed bottle was then incubated in a 37°C water bath for 90min and 1mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to end the reaction. Incubation was continued for the whole bottle (37°C, 60m). We then transferred the contents of the medium pore to a glass cup containing 3.5mL of antioxidant solution. Finally, the solution was measured with the sulfide-sensitive electrode. The H2S concentration of each sample was calculated against a calibration curve of NaHS and adjusted by the protein concentration of each sample. Results were expressed in (nmol/mg protein)."
4,Measurement of level of H2S in double transgenic brain tissue,"2.3 Measurement of level of H2S in double transgenic brain tissue Fifty milligram of brain tissue was removed immediately homogenized in ice-cold 0.9% saline water with a Polytron homogenizer. Five hundred microliter of the brain homogenate and 1M hydrogen chloride (500μl) were added into a pyramidal bottle. Again, 1M sodium hydroxide (0.5mL) was contained within the pore and incubation was carried out in tightly sealed reaction bottle in a 37°C water bath for four hours. The contents of the medium pore were then transferred to a vial containing 3.5mL of antioxidant. Levels of H2S were measured as previously described."
5,Morris water maze,"2.4 Morris water maze The Morris water maze (MWM) apparatus and behavioral paradigm used were similar to previously described methods. Briefly, the water maze was a circular tank (diameter of 120cm, height of 50cm) filled with water to a depth of 30cm and at a temperature of 22±1°C. A round, transparent platform (diameter of 10cm) was placed at the center of a designated quadrant within the tank and submerged 1cm beneath the water’s surface. The distance from the platform center to the pool edge was 33cm. Mice were tested for five consecutive days, with one session occurring per day. Each session consisted of four trials, with an inter-trial interval of 60s. The procedure for each trial was as follows. Mice were gently placed into the pool at the middle site of the circular edge within one of four quadrants, each arbitrarily defined as east, south, west, and north. The animal was allowed 90s to swim to the hidden platform and then allowed to remain on the platform for at least 3s. If the mouse was unable to locate the platform within the allotted 90s, it was gently guided to the platform by the experimenter and allowed to remain on it for 10s. In this case, its performance score (or escape latency) was marked as 90s. MWM behavior was videotaped via a commercial video/computer system (Beijing Logon Science and Technology, Beijing, China). On the fifth and final test day, aprobe trial was performed where by the platform was removed from the maze. The mice were released into the quadrant opposite to the one that had previously contained the platform (the ‘‘platform” quadrant) and allowed to swim in the maze for 1.5min. The video/computer system automatically recorded the number of crossings over the target area for each mouse."
6,Aβ level measurement,"2.5 Aβ level measurement The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified using colorimetric ELISA kits according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cerebral tissue samples were extracted and homogenized in RIPA buffer. After following the manufacturer’s protocol, the assay was read at 450nm on a Microplate Reader (Model EL310, Bio-TEK). All measurements were done in duplicate and an average taken of the two samples."
7,Immunohistochemical analysis,"2.6 Immunohistochemical analysis To detect the protein expression level and location of CBS, Aβ1–42, capase-3 in brain tissue, CBS, Aβ1–42, capase-3 polyclonal antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse) were used at dilution of 1:100, 1:50, 1:100, respectively. All assays were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions. As previously described, paraffin sections were de-waxed with xylene, hydrated with an alcohol gradient, and subjected to microwaves to increase the antigenicity of target epitopes. Tissue was then blocked with non-immunized animal normal serum for 20min to reduce non-specific binding, and then probed with primary antibody (either anti-CBS and Aβ1–42) overnight at 4°C. After primary incubation, tissue was incubated in biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and then StreptAvidin–Biotin Complex (SABC) for 30min at 37°C. Slides were coverslipped with waterborne mount and immunoreactivity then examined via light microscopy. Negative control slides were incubated in 0.1mol/L PBS containing 1:100 blocking serum instead of primary antibody and had no immunological reaction."
8,Western blot analysis,"2.7 Western blot analysis Protein expression in H2S-treated mice was quantified using Western blot. Briefly, brain samples were homogenized in 0.5mL of RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 50mM Tris–hydrochloric acid, 2mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The supernatant containing the dissolved proteins was collected after centrifugation (12,000g for 20min). Protein concentrations were determined using the enhanced BCA protein assay kit. The proteins were then separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After being blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 1×PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 at 37°C for 60min, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against BACE1, PS1 and ADAM10, ADAM17, AHP and GAPDH (loading control) at 4°C overnight. The membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60min. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was used for detection. Densitometric quantification of blots was analyzed using Alphapart11Ease, v. 5.0 and final measurements were calculated as a relative ratio to the loading control."
9,Statistical analyses,2.8 Statistical analyses All data are expressed as mean±standard error (SE). Differences between groups were analyzed by two way ANOVA for MWM and t-test for other analyze. Statistical significance was determined based on a p-value of 0.05.
10,Results,
11,The level of H2S decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice,"3.1 The level of H2S decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice H2S levels in the brains of transgenic mice were found to decrease with increasing age. Decreases in H2S levels began at 9months of age. As shown in Fig. 1 A, A significant reduction was observed when mice were 12months of age and compared to 3-month-old subjects. This tendency for H2S levels to decrease was also found within specific regions such as the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1A). We also observed that at several time points, H2S levels in the hippocampus were higher than those of the cortex."
12,Activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes decreased in the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 transgenic mice,"3.2 Activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes decreased in the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 transgenic mice As the AD transgenic mice increased in age, we found a subsequent decrease in the activity of H2S synthesizing enzymes. This decrease was found in both the cortex and hippocampus. This decrease in H2S-synthesizing enzyme activity paralleled the decrease in H2S levels we had previously observed (Fig. 1B)."
13,CBS enzyme expression in cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice,"3.3 CBS enzyme expression in cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice When compared to 3-month-old mice, both cortex and hippocampus immunohistochemical analyses showed a significant decrease in CBS protein expression in both 9- and 12-month-old mice (Fig. 1C). There was no difference in CBS protein expression between 3- and 6-month-old mice. At 9 and 12months, we found a decrease in CBS protein expression paralleled an increase in cell loss."
14,H2S prevented the neuronal apoptosis in transgenic mice,"3.4 H2S prevented the neuronal apoptosis in transgenic mice We found that 50umol/kg NaHS treatment reduced the expression of capase-3 in both 6- and 12-month-old transgenic mice (Fig. 2 A–D). As expression of caspase-3 is a known indicator of cellular apoptosis, we took this result as an indication of the efficacy of NaHS to reduce neuronal cell loss."
15,H2S prevented memory impairment in transgenic mice in the Morris water maze,"3.5 H2S prevented memory impairment in transgenic mice in the Morris water maze All NaHS treatment groups showed the same swimming speed in the Morris water maze when compared with controls (Fig. 4a and b). However, 50umol/kg NaHS treatment significantly reduced both the escape latencies and swimming distance in 6-month-old transgenic mice when compared to age-matched saline controls on day 2 (escape latencies, p <0.05; swimming distance, p <0.001), day 3 (escape latencies, p <0.01; swimming distance, p <0.001) and day 4 (p <0.05) (Fig. 3 A; Fig. 4 c). There was no difference in escape latencies among the 10 and 20umol/kg NaHS treatment groups and saline controls (p >0.05) (Fig. 3A). Compared to saline controls, 12-month-old transgenic mice, that received treatments of NaHS (50umol/kg) had both decreased escape latencies and swimming distance on day 2 (escape latencies, p< 0.05; swimming distance, p <0.01), on day 3 (escape latencies, p< 0.01; swimming distance, p <0.001) and day 4 (p <0.001). These results indicate a recovery of subject’s ability to acquire the memory of the platform’s location (Fig. 3B; Fig. 4d). However, mice treated with 20uM/kg of NaHS showed reduced escape latencies only on day 4 (p <0.05) (Fig. 3B). On the fifth day (probe trial with no platform present), mice treated with 50umol/kg of NaHS showed a higher percentage of time spent in the target quadrant when compared to saline-treated controls at both 6- and 12-months of age (Fig. 4e and f). Moreover, mice treated with 50umol/kg of NaHS-had more crossings over the platform location when compared to saline controls at both 6- and 12-months of age. (Fig. 4g and h). 12-month-old NaHS treated mice also had a shorter path (distance traveled) to locate the platform within the 90s test period when compared to control mice. This difference was especially salient for those received 50uMol/kg of NaHS (Fig. 3C)."
16,Exogenous H2S reduced the level of Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice,"3.6 Exogenous H2S reduced the level of Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice 50umol/kg of NaHS resulted in a decrease in Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 levels in both 6- and 12-month-old transgenic mice when compared to saline controls (p <0.01) (Fig. 5 A–D). Similarly, treatment with 50umol/kg of NaHS reduced both the number and size of Aβ-42 in 6- and 12-month-old transgenic mice when compared to saline controls (Fig. 5E.a–d). Interestingly, both 10 and 20umol/kg of NaHS treatment did not change levels of either Aβ-40 or Aβ-42."
17,"H2S altered the expression of α, β, and γ-secretase enzymes","3.7 H2S altered the expression of α, β, and γ-secretase enzymes 3.7.1 H2S increased protein levels of ADAM17 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice NaHS treatment had no effect on the expression levels of ADAM10 in both 6- and 12-month-old transgenic mice (p >0.05) (Fig. 6 ). NaHS treatment did not change the expression levels of ADAM17 in 6-month-old mice (p >0.05); however, there was a dose-dependence increase in expression levels of ADAM17 in the cortex of 12-month-old months NaHS treated mice when compared to saline controls. We observed a parallel increase in levels of its corresponding CTFα (C83) in 50umol/kg NaHS treated mice at 12months of age, but we did not observe the a change in C83 levels in 6-month-old mice (Fig. 6). 3.7.2 H2S decreased protein levels of BACE-1 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice At 6months of age, transgenic mice treated with 50umol/kg of NaHS had a reduced expression of BACE1. Both 20 and 50umol/kg of NaHS treatment significantly decreased expression levels of BACE1 in 12-month-old mice. In accordingly, 20 and 50umol/kg of NaHS treatment mice also showed reduced levels of APP-CTFβ (C99) at 6 and 12months of age when compared to saline treatment groups (Fig. 6). 3.7.3 H2S decreased protein levels of PS1 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice Compared to saline treated mice, we observed a significant decrease in protein levels of PS1 in the 50umol/kg NaHS treatment group at both 6- and 12-months. 20umol/kg of NaHS treatment also reduced expression of PS1 in 12-month-old mice, but 10umol/kg of NaHS had no effect on PS1 protein levels at any time point (Fig. 6)."
18,Discussion,"Since high concentrations (up to 160uM) of H2S are reported in healthy human brain tissue and levels are found to be decreased by ∼55% in the brains of patients with AD, the significance of H2S to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease is high (Kamoun, 2004). We found that brain level of H2S in our mouse model was very low, around 10∼14nmol in the cortex and hippocampus at 3 and 6months of age. We observed decreased levels of H2S in both 9- and 12-month-old AD mice. The activity of H2S-synthesizing enzymes showed a similar decrease in AD mice. Moreover, the decrease in protein expression of CBS was found in the cortex and hippocampus of 9- and 12-month-old AD mice because of a reduction of CBS-containing neurons. In the previous reports, Aβ accumulation in the AD mice caused inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes subsequently caused an induction of NFkappaB, release of the inflammatory mediators TNFalpha, IL-6 and nitrite ions. This resulted in both a down-regulation of CBS and, ultimately, a decrease in H2S synthesis. These effects were partially reversed by pre-treatment with the H2S releasing agent NaHS (Lee et al., 2009). Recent work has shown that approximately 90% of H2S in the brain is produced by 3MST which can potentially change the perceived role of CBS in H2S production. However, reduced expression of CBS protein may partially contribute to decreased levels of H2S in 9- and 12-month AD mice. Our study administered NaHS to transgenic mice at 4- and 10-month-old mice. NaHS treatment reduced neuronal apoptosis in both 6- and 12-month transgenic mice. This effect was particularly evident for mice treated with 50umol/kg of NaHS. All NaHS treatment groups showed identical swimming speed in the Morris water maze compared with control mice. However, transgenic mice treated with 50umol/kg of NaHS showed a shortener latency to find the platform as well as decreased swimming distance on days two, three and four. On test (probe trial), these mice also displayed a higher percentage of time spent in the target quadrant as well as a larger number of entrances. Thus, we found that 50umol/kg of NaHS improved the spatial memory of AD mice at both 6- and 12-months of age. However, 10umol/kg of NaHS treatment had no effect on memory at any time point. We found that 20umol/kg of NaHS treatment partially improved memory in some AD mice. We wanted to determine if higher doses of NaHS led to better memory improvements in AD mice. In preliminary experiments, 100umol/kg of NaHS treatment was found to be lethal to all mice. Thus, we determined that the protective effects of H2S are dose-dependent. In an acute beta-amyloid treatment rat model of Alzheimer’s disease, Xuan A, et al. observed that NaHS could improve significantly ameliorate Aβ(1–40)-induced spatial learning and memory impairments, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This was found to be due, in part, to an inhibition of p38 MAPK and p65 NF-κB activity. (Xuan et al., 2012). Our mouse model used a chronic increase in beta-amyloid to mimic AD and we found that resulting cognitive impairments in these mice were prevented by NaHS treatment. Different mechanisms may contribute to this result, including reduced neuronal apoptosis, decreased Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 levels and/or the decrease Aβ plaque formation. Our ELISA assay results showed that Aβ-40 and Aβ-42 levels were significantly decreased in both 6- and 12-month-old mice. This decrease in Aβ was paralleled by increased spatial memory and was most apparent in the 50umol/kg NaHS treatment group. There is much evidence that increased brain Aβ levels and/or Aβ plaques may be the primary factor leading to neuronal degeneration in AD, impairment of long-term potentiation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and the cause of neuroinflammatory responses in a transgenic model of AD (Duyckaerts et al., 1995). Therefore, the protective effects of chronic administration of NaHS on memory impairment may be associated with its apparent ability to decrease either brain Aβ levels and/or Aβ plaques. Proteolytic cleavage of APP at the α-site results in the secretion of sAPPα and formation of a membrane-bound 83 amino acid fragment (C83). However, age-related Aβ deposition in the AD mouse brain can gradually interrupt the balance of secretase enzymes, resulting in decreased expression of α-secretases (ADAMs) and subsequent increase in BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase enzyme complex. This imbalance can then cause increase in Aβ levels and progression of AD (Kojro and Fahrenholz, 2005). Our experiments used a chronic (2-month), i.p. administration of NaHS to AD transgenic mice. We found that a 50umol/kg dose of NaSH resulted in significantly reduced beta- and gamma-secretase expression levels as well as decreased levels of C99 in both 6- and 12-month-old mice. Although we found mixed results with a dose of 20umol/kg of NaHS, this treatment could have a similar and more consistent effect as higher doses (e.g. 50umol/kg) if we used subjects older than 12-months of age. In 6-month-old mice, the expression levels of ADAM17 and C83 were not significantly increased in the NaHS treatment group. However, in 12-month-old mice, 10, 20, 50 NaHS umol/kg treatment changed the expression of ADAM17 and the expression of C83 was observed to increase in the 50umol/kg NaHS treatment group. The increase in expression of ADAM7 and C83 and decrease in expression of BACE1, PS1 and C99 was not evident in some NaHS treatment groups. This result can be interpreted as an age-related effect, a dose-dependent effect, or both. In our study, a dose of 50umol/kg of NaHS had profound effects on the levels of APP processing through both the alpha- and beta-secretase pathways. This resulted in an overall increase of the non-amyloidogenic alpha cleavage product (C83) and a decrease in the beta (C99) cleavage product. Our results indicate that the effect of H2S on decreasing beta-secretase and gama-secretase expression may contribute to decreased Aβ levels, and subsequent attenuation of the neuropathological and behavioral impairments observed in AD mice. To our knowledge, the effects of H2S on beta- and gamma-secretase activity and subsequent Aβ levels in a clinical Alzheimer’s population have not been studied. However, our mouse model results indicate the ability for H2S to affect beta-secretase activity and subsequent Aβ levels to be used as a therapeutic agent. Past in vitro work has shown that exogenous H2S increased the expression of pAkt and pERK1/2 and reduced the expression of PP38 MAPK. However, it did not change the expression of pJNK in both neurons and PC12 cells. Reduction of BACE1 and PS1 expression levels were inhibited by LY294002 (a known inhibitor of PI3K/AKt), but unaffected by PD 98059(a known inhibitor of ERK1/2). Thus, we inferred that H2S decreased expression of BACE1 and PS1 via the PI3K/AKt pathway. However, the mechanism by which ADAM17 levels increase is currently unknown. Because our results indicate that PS1 and BACE1 expression levels changed in parallel to the same doses of NaHS, we hypothesize that a similar mechanism may underlie both. Alternatively, PS1 may also mediate the reduction of BACE1 induced by H2S administration. Past work has shown that both BACE1 and ADAM17 share a common localization within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and that they do not compete for APP under normal conditions (Kim et al., 2008). In concordance with these findings, we did not observe that NaHS-induced decreases in either BACE1 or PS1 levels were followed by an increase in ADAM17 levels. Unfortunately, the toxicity of NaHS precludes its direct application to AD patients. Moreover, our study only examined the cognitive benefits of NaHS administration in one behavioral task, the Morris water maze. Whether this benefit would extend both to further rodent behavioral and cognitive assays and, more importantly, whether it would generalize to a human population remains to be seen. Thus, further studies are necessary to elucidate whether the protective effect of H2S we observed presenting our APP/PS1 mouse model are also shared by AD patients. In conclusion, chronic administration of NaHS may prevent memory impairment in an AD mouse model by a decrease in the production of Aβ. This decrease in the production of Aβ may be the result of a decrease in the expression of BACE1 and PS1 with a concurrent increase in ADAM17. We also found that NaHS had a dose-dependent effect, with 50umol/kg being optimal for both efficacy and non-toxicity in our mouse model. These findings suggest that NaHS-releasing drug may provide a promising new therapeutic avenue for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease."
