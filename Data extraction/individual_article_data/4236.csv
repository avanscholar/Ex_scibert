0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is considered as a promising clean energy carrier for replacing fossil fuels, and among the current technologies for hydrogen production, electrocatalytic water splitting is attracting increasing attention [1–5]. Platinum based materials are the most efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [6], but they are scarce and expensive. Despite tremendous efforts put on finding more efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation, noble-metal-based materials remain as the most efficient HER electrocatalysts. Platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and iridium (Ir) in particular not only possess high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity but also can be effectively combined with other materials for superior catalytic performance [7]. Therefore, reducing the amount of Pt in the catalysts while maintaining high catalytic activity is crucial for the HER. In conventional Pt based catalysts, not all Pt atoms are catalytically active, resulting in low utilization efficiency. Recent theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that subnanometer clusters have better catalytic activity and/or selectivity than nanometer-sized particles [8–12]. Low-coordination, unsaturated atoms often function as active sites [13], so downsizing the particles or clusters is highly desirable for obtaining high Pt utilization for promoting electrocatalytic reactions. Hence, because of maximal usage of metal surface and great potential to achieve high catalytic activities, subnanometer sized catalyst particles have recently attracted much attention [14–18] especially for such catalytic reaction as the HER [19–21]. However, fabrication of practical and stable subnanometer catalyst particles remains a significant challenge because, typically, atomic-sized clusters are very mobile and readily aggregate into larger particles leading to a decrease in catalytic activity [22–24]. Accordingly, it is critical to stabilize metal atoms on a proper matrix to achieve optimized catalytic performance and good durability. Therefore, supported pseudo-atomic scale metal clusters are a promising catalyst class as in them the noble metals can be used to the ultimate efficiency limit. In such materials the surface is efficiently used and hence, the noble metal loading can be significantly reduced [25–29]. In this context, a variety of synthetic approaches have been developed to fabricate supported pseudo-atomic noble metal catalysts including atomic layer deposition, pyrolysis [30] and a wet chemistry method [27]. Most previously reported supports have composed of metals, metal oxides, metal carbides, metal sulfides and heteroatom (for example, N) doped carbon materials [31,32] and carbon-based materials, including Pt/FeOx [33], Pt/α-Mo2C [34], Co/MoS2 [35], Pt/Ni nanocrystals [36] and Pt/CeO2 [37]. However, despite many recent studies on pseudo-atomic heterogeneous catalysts, there has been considerable debate regarding the catalytic capabilities of supported subnanometer sized particles. While some studies show those as active catalytic centers [37–39] others claim nanoparticles to be the active species in similar systems [40,41]. Moreover, although subnanometer sized particles decorated on different supports are used for fundamental studies [42,43], such an expensive and low-yield fabrication method is not suitable for practical applications. Hence, a more realistic approach is needed to anchor metal atoms on special sites of supports to reduce the utilization of the noble metal. Here, a practical fabrication method for obtaining a Pt pseudo-atomic catalyst which consists of a low amount of Pt (0.02 at%) anchored onto a core–shell nanoparticle support is reported. The support comprises of NiFe nanoparticles encapsulated in an ultra-thin graphene layer (NiFe@UTG). This electrocatalyst shows the same catalytic activity as commercial Pt/C (with 1.5 atPt-%) towards the HER in acidic media. This 0.02 at-% Pt/NiFe@UTG catalyst exhibits extraordinary activity and durability, attributed to the strong interaction between Pt atoms and the metal-core that activate the carbon cage. In this study, a detailed description of the morphology, electronic structure, and the HER reaction mechanism at Pt/NiFe@UTG is presented through a combination of structural and electrochemical studies and DFT calculations. Our results demonstrate the important role of the catalyst support for simultaneously achieving high activity and durability."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis process of a NiFe@UTG support,"2.1 Synthesis process of a NiFe@UTG support The preparation of a NiFe@UTG support followed previous reports [44]. Briefly, NiFe@UTG was synthesized by a facile technique using ultrashort pulsed laser ablation (see Supporting Information Fig. S1) for the synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) in acetone as described in detail elsewhere [44]. For this process, an Nd: YAG laser (Ekspla, Atlantic) with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, a pulse duration of 10 ps and a repetition rate of 100 kHz were used. A scanner (SCANcube10, Scanlab) moved the laser beam in a spiral pattern, and it was focused on the target with an f-theta lens (focal lens of 100 mm). The actual pulse energy applied, after the scanner and all optics, was 95 µJ. For synthesizing the NPs, a Ni80Fe20 (80 wt%-20 wt%, Sekels) was placed in a self-constructed stirred 100 mL aluminium batch chamber. The chamber was filled with acetone (analytical reagent grade, Fisher Chemical), and the ablation was carried out for 20 min. The collected colloid was used for further processing and analysis. To adjust the concentration, the solvent was evaporated at ambient temperature and pressure. Another support was also synthesized with the same procedure but using a different laser type, nanosecond laser to produce NiFe@C(10nm) in acetone. The difference between these two supports, NiFe@UTG and NiFe@C(10nm), is the number of the graphitic carbon layers in the shell encapsulating the NiFe NPs and those are formed from acetone during the PLD synthesis [1,44]. NiFe@UTG has 1–4 graphitic layer with thickness < 1 nm whereas NiFe@C(10nm) has a thick graphitic shell of some 10 nm as shown below."
3,Electrochemical activation and characterization,"2.2 Electrochemical activation and characterization The electrochemical measurements were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell and an Autolab PGSTAT12 potentiostat. For HER measurements, cathodic linear sweep voltammetry with 10 mV s−1 scan rate was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 (diluted from H2SO4 99.999%, purity based on trace metals, purchased from Sigma Aldrich) electrolyte solution at 25 °C saturated with N2. For Pt electrodeposition (Fig. S1b), the reference and counter electrodes were a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a Pt foil (purity: 99.95%, purchased from Kultakeskus), respectively. The area of the Pt foil and the volume of the electrolyte in the cell were 1 cm2 and 100 mL, respectively. For the other electrochemical measurements, a Ti wire (diameter: 3 mm, length: 2.5 cm) was utilized as a counter electrode. The pristine NiFe@UTG or NiFe@C(10nm) was deposited on a polished glassy carbon (GC) electrode with loading of ~0.19 mg cm−2 and to avoid detachment of the materials from the GC electrode Nafion ionomer (5 wt -% dispersion in lower aliphatic alcohols and water, Aldrich) was used as a binder. Commercial 20 wt% platinum on carbon black (Pt/C purchased from Alfa Aesar) was used for the comparison and deposited on a GC electrode so that its loading was ~0.2 mg cm−2. Prior to any measurements, all the electrodes were cycled between 0 and 1.2 V vs. RHE at 50 mV s−1 scan rate in nitrogen protected electrolyte until a stable CV was reached. The uncompensated ohmic electrolyte resistance (Ru ) was measured to be ~3 Ω by impedance spectroscopy. However, iR correction was not applied to the overpotential curves. The currents are normalized to the GC geometrical surface area of 0.196 cm2. During the Pt immobilization and for measuring the HER polarization curves, the GC substrate was rotated at 3500 rpm to remove the produced hydrogen bubbles from the electrode during the deposition of Pt. The rotation was also applied during the HER durability cycles. To eliminate any effect from Pt ions dissolved in the electrolyte, after each Pt immobilization process, the acidic electrolyte was discarded and replaced with a fresh one to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalyst. All the curves of activated samples were reported with a fresh electrolyte. All the STEM, XPS, and SEM analysis are done after the complete electrochemical measurements and HER stability cycles between −0.2 and 1.1 V vs RHE."
4,XPS analysis,"2.3 XPS analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) from the catalyst materials were performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer with monochromated Al Kα radiation, a pass energy of 40 eV, spot size of roughly 700 μm × 300 μm and an X-ray power of 225 W. XPS measurements for the NiFe@UTG and NiFe@C(10nm) samples were performed on polished GC electrodes using the same sample before and after the Pt electrodeposition."
5,STEM characterization,"2.4 STEM characterization For scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterizations of the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample, the material was scratched from the GC electrode and dispersed in ethanol (with the concentration of ~0.01 mg/ml) and then 10 µl of the solution was drop casted on a carbon coated TEM grid (Cu grid) and dried in ambient air. The product was observed through a JEOL-2200FS, double Cs-corrected STEM at the acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data was extracted from STEM analysis."
6,Computational methods,"2.5 Computational methods For Ni20%@C and Ni80%@C modelling, calculations were started from a realistic single-shell carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticle (SCEIN) model system, Fe55@C240. In Fe55@C240, Fe55 is icosahedral, and the Fe atoms are organized in 2 layers (a second layer and a surface layer with the facet and corner iron atoms) around one central Fe. Fe55@C240 was modified accordingly: in the surface layer, the 12 corner Fe atoms were either replaced with Ni to obtain a 20% Ni system, Ni12Fe43@C240 (Ni20%@C) or conserved and all others replaced by Ni yielding a 80% Ni, i.e. Ni43Fe12@C240 (Ni80%@C). Further computational details are provided in Supporting Information."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Pseudo-atomic platinum immobilization on the NiFe@UTG support,"3.1 Pseudo-atomic platinum immobilization on the NiFe@UTG support The material comprising of platinum atoms immobilized on the NiFe@UTG support (denoted as Pt/NiFe@UTG) was prepared through potential cycling in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 1 b). The immobilization was done via only 3 potential cycles between −0.55 and 0.25 V vs. RHE using a NiFe@UTG coated GC electrode as a working electrode (WE), while a Pt foil was utilized as a counter electrode (CE). The cathodic cycling of the NiFe@UTG WE during the activation induces anodic cycling for the Pt CE. Once the potential applied to the WE decreases to −0.55 V vs. RHE, the potential applied to the CE increases to ca. 2.2 V vs. RHE. When the potential on the CE exceeds the dissolution onset potential for Pt in acidic media, 1.1 V vs. RHE, such Pt species as Pt2+ or Pt4+ are dissolved from the Pt electrode into the electrolyte and subsequently reduced on the WE [28,29,45]. Likewise, Pt atoms can be anchored on NiFe@UTG by an external power source applying a voltage difference between the NiFe@UTG electrode (negative electrode) and a Pt foil (Fig. 1b). To eliminate any effect by the Pt ions dissolved in the electrolyte, after each activation process, the acidic electrolyte was discarded and replaced with a fresh one to evaluate the catalytic activity of the material. It is worth mentioning that the above-described very short activation time leads to dissolution of only low amount of Pt in the electrolyte and only a proper support can be activated with such a low amount of Pt [29]. In order to show the critical role of the carbon shell thickness for designing a proper catalyst support for pseudo-atomic Pt immobilization, two carbon encapsulated NiFe nanoparticle supports are considered here. One of them, NiFe@UTG, has an ultra-thin graphitic shell comprising of 1–4 carbon layers while in the other NiFe is encapsulated in a thicker carbon shell of 10 nm (denoted as NiFe@C(10nm)) as shown below. Both are synthesized with the same pulsed laser deposition (PLAL) method (Fig. 1a) by varying the laser pulsing [44]. The NiFe@C(10nm) WE was subjected to similar Pt electrodeposition procedure than NiFe@UTG. However, a longer activation of 150 above-mentioned potential cycles was done for the NiFe@C(10nm) support to elucidate the significance of the graphitic shell thickness for the Pt electrodeposition."
9,Catalytic performance,"3.2 Catalytic performance The electrocatalytic activity of the NiFe@UTG support with and without 0.02 at-% Pt (see XPS results below for determining the Pt loading) for the HER was investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 purged with N2 and compared with that of a commercial 20 wt-% Pt/C catalyst (equaling 1.5 atPt-%). Fig. 2 a shows typical polarization curves of the HER on pristine NiFe@UTG, Pt/NiFe@UTG, and a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. The Pt/NiFe@UTG sample exhibits an onset potential of about 0 V vs. RHE, equaling to the thermodynamic potential of the HER. This is significantly lower than that of the pristine NiFe@UTG (~ −0.3 V vs. HER). The Pt/NiFe@UTG electrode requires low overpotentials of 10, 110, and 200 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively. These are the same as those for commercial Pt/C with some hundred times higher Pt loading. The activation of NiFe@UTG results from the adsorbed Pt atoms liberated from the CE, since replacing the Pt foil with a carbon paper and applying even 50 potential cycles does not improve the HER catalytic activity of NiFe@UTG (Fig. S2a). The HER activity of Pt/NiFe@UTG is significantly higher than those of the most active precious or non-precious metal catalysts (Table S1) [46–48] and in acidic media rivals the catalytic activity of commercial Pt/C which has a notably higher Pt loading. Tafel plots of the HER polarization curves are shown in Fig. 2b. Using the linear sweep voltammetry data, Tafel slopes of 31 and 34 mV/dec are calculated for the Pt/NiFe@UTG and Pt/C electrodes, respectively, which differ notably from 97 mV/dec determined for NiFe@UTG (Fig. S2b). These Tafel slope values suggest that the rate determining step for the HER on Pt/NiFe@UTG is the same as for Pt/C. However, more extensive electrochemical investigations are needed to confirm this reaction mechanism. The HER exchange current density (j0 ) of the electrocatalysts is also calculated from the Tafel plots by an extrapolation method [49]. The HER j0 value of 0.06 mA cm−2 for NiFe@UTG is significantly improved to 1.20 mA cm−2 after 3Pt electrodeposition cycles (Pt/NiFe@UTG), indicating a reaction rate similar to that of Pt/C (1.22 mA cm−2). Fig. 3 displays cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Pt/C and NiFe@UTG before and after 3Pt electrodeposition cycles. The CV of the NiFe@UTG sample is featureless indicating absence of Faradic reactions as expected for transition metal nanoparticles fully encapsulated in graphitic carbon shells [4,5]. Overall, the CV is a sensitive analytical technique for Pt metal electrodes, showing its characteristic redox processes related peaks even with low Pt amounts. A typical CV of a Pt electrode (see the Pt/C reference material in Fig. 3) includes several pairs of peaks assigned to adsorption/desorption of hydrogen (hydrogen fingerprint region, 0.05–0.4 V vs. RHE) and surface oxide formation and reduction (oxygen region, 0.7–1.1 V vs. RHE) [50–52]. Moffat et al. have shown the presence of hydrogen region (under potentially deposited H, Hupd) features in an acidic electrolyte for a low amount Pt deposition, even for thin layers of ~0.2 nm where Pt island coverage is ~0.75 [50]. However, for pseudo-atomic Pt clusters on a carbon support featureless CVs have been reported earlier [30] reflecting the absence of typical Pt crystal facets. It is noteworthy that the CV of the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample reminds that of the pristine NiFe@UTG material (Fig. 3). As for Pt/NiFe@UTG, the above-described typical Pt induced features cannot be observed (after the Pt deposition on NiFe@UTG) the CV suggests a pseudo-atomic or atomic scale dispersion of Pt. At low potentials, slight reduction current increase in the Pt/NiFe@UTG CV can be observed when sweeping towards negative potentials form about 0.5 V vs. RHE. This is followed by a drastic current increase at around 0.05 V vs. RHE. These features are attributed to hydrogen underpotential deposition and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Hence, the CV indicates the ability of pseudo-atomic Pt in Pt/NiFe@UTG to adsorb hydrogen (Hupd) and to promote the HER. Electrodeposition of Pt atoms can also be expected when NiFe@C(10nm) is exposed to the above-described potential cycling method with a Pt CE. This hybrid material has the same transition metal core as NiFe@UTG but a thicker carbon shell of 10 nm (see Figs. S3 and S4). Interestingly, Fig. 4 shows that this is not the case as even after 150 potential cycles, there is no improvement in the HER activity for NiFe@C(10nm). The HER polarization curves depicted in Figs. 2a and 4 suggest that the graphitic carbon shell thickness has an important role in the Pt deposition. These results are in agreement with earlier theoretical and experimental findings [53–55] suggesting that more than 3 graphitic carbon layers in carbon encapsulated metal hybrid materials (metal@C) inhibit the interaction of a metal core with the surroundings. Hence, those studies demonstrate that the number of graphitic layers influences significantly the electronic structure of the surface of the metal@C nanostructures. A simple comparison between the NiFe@UTG and NiFe@C(10nm) HER activity before and after subjecting to the Pt electrodeposition (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, respectively) reveals that the number of graphitic layers in the carbon-shell has a crucial role on the immobilization of Pt atoms on the surface of the metal@C core shell materials studied here and/or the electrocatalytic activity of Pt immobilized on such hybrid materials. A recently published work [56] has shown that curved carbon supports can be used to anchor stable atomically dispersed Pt. However, in this work the metal core in such a curved structure is further shown to even enhance the Pt atom immobilization and enable reduction of the Pt loading of an electrocatalyst (see comparison in Table S1). Our experimental results combined with the DFT calculations (discussed below) show that the metal core has a vital role in anchoring atom decorations and thus further confirming the above-mentioned graphene shell thickness effect. Many investigations have shown that the anodic platinum dissolution and subsequent transfer during the potential cycles must be responsible for the formation of Pt nanoparticles on the cathode [57]. In most recently published data, fabrication of Pt atom/support materials have required many potential cycles for Pt deposition to reach an activity comparable to commercial Pt/C. In a very recent work [28], the formation of Pt atoms on exfoliated MXene nanosheets has been reported and shown to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the HER in acidic media. In the mentioned work, the Pt atom decoration has been implemented through a similar electrochemical cycling procedure as used here, while 1000 cycles are needed to reach the activity similar to 20 wt-% commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the synthesis procedure of MXene nanosheets is more complicated compared to that of the NiFe@UTG catalyst support. Another group has recently reported the synthesis of platinum atoms on CoP-based nanotube arrays supported on a Ni foam with a similar electrochemical activation method [45]. However, similar activity to a Pt/C reference has been achieved after 10,000 cycles. In another recent research [57] after 7500 and 13,000 potential cycles activity comparable to that of reference Pt/C has been achieved in the presence of a support. Graphite and carbon nanohorns have also shown HER activity after electrodepositing a high loading of Pt particles from a Pt counter electrode [50]. Recently, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been activated for the HER after 4 h electrodepositing with 37.5 times higher Pt loading (0.75 at-%) [29] than in this study (0.2 at% as shown below by XPS). In another investigation, SWNTs have been activated for the HER by brief exposure to electrochemical potentials that induce hydrogen evolution in intercalating acids combined with extended soaking times in sulfuric acid [58]. However, the catalytic activity after that activation is very low, and the attained activity after 120 h of soaking in the acid is still significantly lower than the activity of the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample reported here. In all the above-mentioned studies, the amount of Pt loading required to reach a high HER activity is much higher than that in the present work. In contrast, herein an ultralow Pt loading in Pt/NiFe@UTG revealed a notable HER activity. After a careful comparison with other electrocatalysts synthetized with similar methods, NiFe@UTG appears as the most efficient support reported so far for high utilization of Pt. The extraordinary catalytic activity of Pt/NiFe@UTG (0.02 atPt-%) in comparison to other materials comprising of low Pt loadings on such supports as graphene [29], carbon nanohorns and SWNTs, can be attributed to the higher ability of NiFe@UTG to activate Pt atoms decorated on its surface. Furthermore, the strong interactions between the NiFe-core@C-shell hybrid and the Pt atoms prevent fast aggregation of Pt as indicated by DFT calculations as discussed below. In addition, the formation of pseudo-atomic dispersion of Pt on the surface of NiFe@UTG (as shown below by STEM experiments) enables Pt/NiFe@UTG to possess extraordinary catalytic activity (Fig. 2)."
10,XPS analysis,"3.3 XPS analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for the pristine (NiFe@UTG, NiFe@C(10nm)) and activated (Pt/NiFe@UTG, Pt/NiFe@C(10nm)) materials, Table S2 presents the elemental compositions of the studied samples. The at% values for all elements have been determined from the peak areas of high-resolution elemental spectra after Shirley background subtraction using element specific sensitivity factors. C, O, Ni and Fe are attributed to the samples and likewise Pt after the electrodeposition. The intense F 1s and the S 2p peak in the XPS spectra originate from the Nafion binder. The other elements in Table S2 (N, Cl, Na and Si) are attributed to contamination from the glassware used for the PLD synthesis of NiFe@UTG and Pt/NiFe@C(10nm). Detailed information of the atomic percentages of the elements is provided in Table S2. The XPS analysis of the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample reveals the presence of 0.02 at% Pt. However, no platinum is detected in NiFe@C(10nm) after the Pt electrodeposition indicating that the absence of Pt is the reason for the unchanged electrocatalytic activity after the activation (Fig. 4). The fact that no Pt is observed in XPS for the NiFe encapsulated in a thick carbon shell (NiFe@C(10nm)) further confirms the important role of the carbon shell thickness in the metal@C support for immobilizing atomic scale Pt. Fig. 5 shows the Pt 4f region for both the studied samples. In the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample, a doublet peak is observed with a 4f7/2 binding energy of 71.1 ± 0.1 eV, typical for metallic Pt. A shift to higher binding energies could be expected upon charge transfer from Pt to the carbon shell [59]. However, previously, e.g. for pseudo-atomic Pt on carbon nanotubes no shift has been observed [29]. It is possible that for the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample, the interaction is limited only to Pt atoms in direct contact with the carbon-shell of NiFe@UTG and therefore, not clear shift is observed."
11,Electron microscopy analysis,"3.4 Electron microscopy analysis Fig. 6 a demonstrates HRTEM images for NiFe@UTG before activation with pseudo-atomic Pt; as it can be seen all the nanoparticles are covered in a thin layer of fullerene-like carbon. The HRTEM images in Fig. 6b and 6c show different regions of Pt/NiFe@UTG. As it is seen in Fig. 6b and 6c, no Pt nanoparticles is observed and observing small Pt clusters is difficult. Only rare two-dimensional Pt pseudo-atomic clusters are observed with the aid of EDS (Fig. 6d) on the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample. These results show that ultra-low amount of 0.02 at-% Pt on Pt/NiFe@UTG is very scattered and detecting Pt clusters in the presence of Ni and Fe is burdensome. Therefore, the extraordinary catalytic activity of Pt/NiFe@UTG is mainly attributed to the formation of very scattered pseudo-atomic Pt clusters on the surface of the NiFe@UTG support. The Pt atoms on NiFe@UTG are quite stable under irradiation of a highly energetic electron beam (200 kV), and no Pt sintering or hopping of the Pt atoms is observed within the time scale of our investigation (~5 min). This indicates that the Pt species are sufficiently immobilized on the NiFe@UTG supports. Hence, the pseudo-atomic Pt catalyst system allows minimization of the Pt loading by increasing the relative amount of surface atoms. As a structural comparison, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of pristine NiFe@C(10nm) is provided in Fig. S4."
12,Durability measurements for the HER,"3.5 Durability measurements for the HER For the HER durability measurements, a suitable type of a counter electrode (CE) must be selected. In the literature, carbon CEs have been used to prevent metal dissolution from the CE to the electrolyte and subsequent electrodeposition on the WE, as this changes the WE activity as shown above [58,60]. However, the Pt/NiFe@UTG sample is quite sensitive to CO or CO2 generation during the oxidation processes at the carbon CE so that a decrease in the HER activity on the WE is observed when a carbon CE is utilized. Therefore, for the durability measurements, a Ti CE is used. Cyclic voltammetric sweeps between −0.2 and 1.1 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was applied to the Pt/NiFe@UTG electrode to investigate its durability. The upper limit of 1.1 V in the stability CVs was selected to strip off the possible adsorbed species affecting the Pt/NiFe@UTG activity. Adsorption of species from electrolytes has been shown to lead to a significant blocking of Pt sites on electrodes with small Pt clusters [61,62]. DFT calculations have also suggested, for example, adsorption of small gaseous molecules to Pt doped carbon materials [63]. This would cause significant errors in the electrochemical measurements. Thus, the kinetic measurements of such electrodes should be performed immediately after electrochemical pre-cleaning of the electrode [61,62]. Here, it is found that the surface of the Pt/NiFe@UTG electrocatalyst can be easily cleaned by holding the electrode at a potential of 1 V vs. RHE, or higher, for about 60 s. A similar procedure has been previously shown to be a sufficient method to clean Pt surface before the cathodic polarization [62]. As long as the surface is cleaned from the adsorbed species before the HER measurements, the catalytic activity is completely preserved and therefore such a precleaning is performed here. As depicted in Fig. 7 , no changes are observed in the HER polarization curve after 5000 above-described aging cycles. The Pt/NiFe@UTG electrode durability was further studied by chronopotentiometry measurements at static potentials of −0.03 V vs. RHE so that the WE was polarized to the potential of 1.1 V vs. RHE after every 10 min (Fig. S5). The latter step was done to remove the species adsorbed from the electrolyte on the pseudo-atomic Pt catalyst. After polarization to the high potential, the catalytic activity is completely recovered, indicating that the current decrease during the chronopotentiometry measurements is not induced by the irreversible structural reformation of the catalyst. These results show the high durability of the Pt/NiFe@UTG catalyst during the HER."
13,Ab-Initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
14,Atomic level description of Pt/NiFe@UTG interactions,"4.1 Atomic level description of Pt/NiFe@UTG interactions DFT/PBE calculations were carried out to gain atomistic insight into the interaction of a Pt atom (Ptat) with different substrates. To highlight the important role of the metal-core in NiFe@UTG, empty fullerene (C240) and C240 with two NiFe metal-core compositions (Fig. 8 a and Fig. S6 for Ni20Fe80@C240 and Ni80Fe20@C240 models (values for Ni and Fe refer to percentage) were chosen for the simulations (details on NiFe NPs modelling and computational methods can be found in Supporting Information). First, a single atom Pt adsorption on the C240 and NiFe@C model systems was studied. Then, the catalytic ability of Pt/NiFe@UTG for the HER was explored by considering the hydrogen free energy model ΔG H [68]. Bader charge analysis was performed to characterize our systems. A charge transfer of 6.8 and 5.4 electrons from the NiFe NP core to the carbon shell is estimated for Ni20Fe80@C and Ni80Fe20@C, respectively. These systems are thus charged transfer complexes where NiFe-core acts as an electron donor. In addition, the projected density of states PDOS were calculated for all pristine models without and with Ptat. The PDOS of both Ni20Fe80@C and Ni80Fe20@C demonstrate metallic-like systems with high metal-C shell interaction, which promotes electron transfer. Regardless of the NiFe-core composition, a significant enhancement of their carbon DOS is noted at the Fermi level when compared to C240 (Fig. 8b and Fig. S7). Moreover, the PDOS shows enhanced occupied states for the Pt atom near E Fermi in both Ni20Fe80@C-Pt and Ni80Fe20@C–Pt (See Fig. 8b inset). Thus, both the carbon and Pt DOS enhancement are assisted by the presence of the encapsulated metal. A high Ni DOS peak near the Fermi level for Ni80Fe20@C–Pt is noteworthy. It evidences a stronger effect of Ni on the carbon-shell compared to Fe; this system is similar to the experimental system in terms of the metal ratio between Ni and Fe. However, as shown by their carbon DOS, only very slight variations between Ni20Fe80@C–Pt and Ni80Fe20@C-Pt are observed (Fig. S8). To emphasize, the carbon-shell is the reacting surface of these metal-core carbon-shell systems and the underlying Ni and Fe are not directly involved in the Pt decoration."
15,Pt adsorption on NiFe@C and C240,"4.2 Pt adsorption on NiFe@C and C240 Three Pt binding sites were identified on 5MR-6MR-6MR blocks of the C cage, preferentially bridge sites (C5MR-C5MR, C6MR-C6MR and C6MR-C6MR) classified into group 1 to 3 (Fig. S9). For C240, three Pt adsorption energy range are obtained in accordance with the identified Pt binding site groups. ΔEPt varies in the range −2.3 eV to −2.7 eV with a preference for C5MR-C6MR sites, group 2 (Fig. S10). Thus, presenting more stable Pt adsorption by 0.3 eV than in (14,0) SWNT/at-Pt [60]. The variation of ΔEPt within each Pt binding site group is observed to be small. Thus, the ΔEP t are quite homogeneous on C240 as sites with the same carbon environment has the same adsorption ability. As for Ni20Fe80@C and Ni80Fe20@C (Fig. S11), ΔEPt in the range −2.6 to −3.1 eV is found evidencing enhanced Pt-C interaction in the presence of the metal core. In addition, contrary to C240, no clear trend is found between the Pt binding site groups except that 5MR sites (C5MR-C5MR) have the highest binding ability. In addition, the heterogeneity in ΔEPt within each Pt binding site group arises from the metal core. In all, our results suggest strong chemisorption of Pt in the presence of NiFe-core. No significant differences in the ΔEPt range are observed between Ni20Fe80@C and Ni80Fe20@C in good corroboration with their similar carbon DOS discussed above. In view of the similar behaviour of the two NiFe models, and in view of the convergence problems in Ni80Fe20@C, probably due to the high DOS near the E Fermi generated by Ni, only Ni20Fe80@C is further considered. Ni20Fe80@C model is considered to capture the Ni effect from the outermost layer of the core on the carbon shell. Ni20Fe80@C will be referred to as NiFe@C in the following."
16,H adsorption free energy on NiFe@C–Pt* and C240-Pt*,"4.3 H adsorption free energy on NiFe@C–Pt* and C240-Pt* Strong Pt chemisorption (Pt*) on C240 is demonstrated above. To assess the hydrogen adsorption, a key step in the HER process, one to five Hs were added to Pt* (Fig. 9 a). In addition, several H adsorption patterns where H also bind to nearby carbon sites of the cage were investigated. All calculated ΔG Hs are presented in Fig. 9b and Table S3. Nørskov et al. [68] have shown that a good catalyst has a ΔG H ≈ 0 eV. Our calculations for C240-Pt* show that Pt* could bind only two Hs. The first H binds with a ΔG H of −0.06 eV while the second overbinds with a ΔG H of −1 eV. A third H does not bind with a ΔG H of 0.5 eV. As a comparison, a ΔG H of −0.03 eV for Pt(111) [68], −0.03 eV for SWNT/at-Pt [29] for axial Pt and −0.08 eV for Mo2TiC2O4-PtSA [28] have been reported (Table S3). No adsorption energy data for a second H have been found. The H adsorption trend reported herein show that C240-Pt* is not a good catalyst. In the presence of the NiFe-core (NiFe@C-Pt*), independently of the Pt* binding site, two Hs always bind strongly to Pt*. Interestingly, when Pt* is in a C5MR-C6MR bridge site, it can bind up to four Hs. Pt*–3H and Pt*-4H have ΔG Hs close to 0 eV (Fig. 9b and Table S3 Pattern 1). Adding an additional H atom to Pt* (Pt*-5H) is endothermic. While Patterns 2, 3 and 8 show that C240 is not activated in C240-Pt*, Pattern 8 shows that a single Pt* can activate the cage of NiFe@C. For example, ΔG Hs of −0.13 eV and 0.04 eV are found for H1 and H4 positions (Pattern 8, Table S3). However, H preferentially will bind to Pt* with a ΔG H of −0.45 eV (Pattern 1, Pt*-1H, Pt* at C5MR-C6MR). Moreover, Patterns 3, 4 and 5 show that the activation of the cage enables several combinations upon addition of Hs to Pt*-2H. Thus, H can bind either Pt* or the carbon cage, e.g. ΔG H for Pt*-2H-H1, Pt*-3H-H1, Pt*-4H-H1 and Pt*-4H-H3 are −0.09 eV, −0.09 eV, −0.20 eV and −0.03 eV, respectively. In particular, the most active carbons are nearby Pt* (Table S3, See also Fig. S12 for H labelling). Based on total energy differences (Table S3), Pt*-2H-H1 is found more stable than Pt*-3H by 0.1 eV, Pt*-3H-H1 is more stable than Pt*-4H by only −0.01 eV and Pt*-4H-H3 is much more stable than Pt*-5H with a ΔG H of −0.03 eV. Thus, C sites can compete with Pt*. Further insight into the H coverage around Pt* in Pattern 6 and 7 shows that only a few sites on the carbon cage are activated (Fig. S12). In all, these results show that Pt*-2H acts as a highly efficient catalyst in the presence of the carbon encapsulated metal-NPs as a catalyst support. Pt and the metal core activate the carbon cage and enhance H binding on the closest carbon neighbours of Pt. Based on our results, the HER probably occur on Pt* or/and on the carbon cage."
17,Pseudo-atomic Pt clusters (Beyond one Pt* model),"4.4 Pseudo-atomic Pt clusters (Beyond one Pt* model) To gain insight into the origin of the limitation of the Pt coverage on the surface of the NiFe@UTG supports observed experimentally, the Pt*-Pt clustering and distances on the NiFe@C model have also been investigated. For this purpose, a second Pt on the cage of the NiFe@C-Pt* model was added by probing the first to the fifth neighbour sites. All adsorption energies of the second Pt (ΔE 2nd Pt) are presented in Table S4 and details on starting and optimized geometries can be found in Fig. S13 and S14. The 1st neighbour site is repulsive and unstable and leads to rearrangement of the two Pt atoms (Fig. S13). The 2nd and 3rd neighbour positions are attractive, and Pt tends to yield clustering with a d(Pt*-Pt) of 2.5–2.6 Å similar to Pt2. The 2nd neighbour site is the most stable with a ΔE 2nd Pt of about −4 eV. As for the 4th and 5th neighbour sites (Fig. S14), Pt*-Pt interaction becomes negligible, and ΔE 2ndPt is of the order of ΔE Pt. Thus, each Pt behaves as an isolated Pt. These calculations prove that when Pt*-Pt distance is within [2.5 Å–4 Å], Pt tends to form small dimers. In addition, the H binding ability to a second Pt placed next to Pt*-4H is investigated. For that purpose, the most stable second neighbour position is selected with ΔE 2nd Pt = −4.09 eV (Table S4). These calculations prove that the second Pt can bind up to three Hs (Fig. 10 a) and this is associated with a slight increase in Pt*-Pt distance (d = 2.8 Å) resulting in a weak dimer. An additional H (4th H) leads to instability with formation and removal of a H2 molecule (Fig. 10b). These results prove that Pt can aggregate when close enough in agreement with the detection of pseudo-atomic Pt by HAADF (Fig. 6). In this case study, the Pt aggregation is not assumed to deactivate Pt*. The presence of two or more Pt, however, multiply the complexity of the system as many other conformations are possible considering the fact that H can also bind the C surface (Table S3) and can possibly affect the interaction. Thus, a stronger conclusion on aggregated Pt, which is beyond the scope of the present study, will require more investigation. In all, a single Pt atom in the presence of a carbon encapsulated metal core can offer attractive and competitive catalytic ability with Pt/C."
18,Conclusions,"In this study, a NiFe@UTG core-shell material is introduced as a catalyst support enabling efficient utilization of Pt using a simple electrochemical activation method. The resulting Pt/NiFe@UTG catalyst with ultra-low Pt loading (0.02 at%) shows the same promotion of the HER in acidic media as a commercial Pt/C catalyst with much higher Pt loading (20 wt% i.e. 1.5 at%). The new material also has excellent durability. Based on the DFT calculations and experimental results, this exceptional high activity is attributed to the synergistic pairing of the NiFe metal-core and the thin graphitic shell which contributes to the immobilization and activation of the atomic scale Pt. Furthermore, as a snowball effect, Pt will further activate the C shell. Our results indicate that by designing conductive and highly reactive core–shell supports, the utilization of noble metals can be reduced even by a factor of 100. To our knowledge, this is the first time when such a low Pt loading and HER activity in acidic media, comparable to a commercial nanoparticular electrocatalyst, is achieved (see Table S1). It is anticipated that the approach demonstrated here for immobilizing atomic-scale metal clusters can also be applied for obtaining other atomic-scale catalytic materials."
