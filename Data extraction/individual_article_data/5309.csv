0,Introduction,"Graphene oxide (GO) membranes have been investigated as very promising candidates for water filtration and/or separation membranes [1,2]. Recently, experimental evidence has shown that in the aqueous phase, water molecules can permeate through GO membranes while blocking the passage of ions [3,4] and molecules such as alcohols [5–8], gases [9,10] and others [11]. GO membranes composed of stacking GO sheets can exhibit complex topologies depending on the experimental techniques used to fabricate them. They can lead to distinct micro- and nano-morphologies and transport pathways that directly affect their selectivity properties [12]. The molecules inside the membrane are supposed to be transported through the percolating two-dimensional channels formed between GO sheets. A typical single GO sheet structure contains a high percentage of functionalized regions (∼82%), pristine regions (∼16%) and structural holes (∼2%) [13]. The pristine regions have the same local structure as pristine graphene and they are responsible for water fast slip inside the channels [14]. On the other hands, the functionalized regions have a large amount of hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups that are attractive sites for water and other polar molecules [15]. The number of functional groups can be tunable through some chemical post-treatments [16,17]. The typical interlayer distance between GO sheets is ∼6–7 Å under dry conditions and about 12–13 Å under humidification, and it can be also controlled by physical confinement, as recently shown by experimentalists [4,18]. The promising application of GO membranes for water removal from alcohols, such as ethanol and methanol, would have important relevance in biofuels production processes. Ethanol is the most commercialized biofuel that might help world energy supply demands with minor negative environmental impacts [19]. However, to improve sustainability and cost gain of this renewable resource, efficient membrane separation is still needed to reduce energy cost during the process of ethanol dehydration [20,21]. The first experimental evidence that GO membranes are permselective for water rather than ethanol was reported by Nair et al. [5]. In their experiment, a GO membrane sealed the open aperture of a container with vapor water-ethanol (50:50) mixture. After several days, only water was evaporated until the concentration of ethanol in the feed side reaches ∼80%. To cite another example, Yeh et al. obtained high water permeability and excellent selectivity for ethanol dehydration through pervaporation by using nanofibrous membranes containing multilayered graphene oxide barrier layers [22]. In both experiments, the separation mechanism has been attributed to the formation of a network of nano-capillaries that allow nearly frictionless water flow, while blocking the alcohol. However, the origin of GO membranes selectivity is not evident since water and alcohol molecules are neutral and have similar affinities to the polar oxygen-containing functional groups of GO. Thus far, the role of GO membrane in the water-alcohol separation remains unclear, limiting further improvements on their selectivity performance. Theoretical studies devoted to understand the water filtration mechanisms inside GO membranes came mostly from those dedicated to water desalination [23–25]. Some works on alcohol-water separation have focused on the performance of adsorbents such as metal-organic framework and zeolites [26–28], and some in 2D materials. For example, Gravelle et al. have performed MD simulation in multilayer pure graphene-membrane to probe permselectivity of ethanol [29] and Kommu et al. investigated the separation in stacked hexagonal boron nitride [30] membranes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a computational investigation of multilayer GO membranes for water-ethanol and water-methanol separations is performed. In this work, we propose a structural model that simulates a fluid flowing from an infinite reservoir through a multilayer GO-based membrane by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This method allows the investigation of the capillary effects considering only the different pressure between both reservoirs as the driven force. In addition, we have also carried out Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to probe ethanol/water and methanol/water vapor mixtures adsorptive separation. To obtain a deep understanding of these mechanisms at the molecular scale, a careful inspection on the structural aspects (how the molecules are spatially arranged) of the molecules inside the membranes, as well as membrane/molecule affinities and molecular permeation were analyzed."
1,Methods,"Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were performed using the structural model schematically shown in Fig. 1 . Typical structural models contain four graphene sheets perforated with nanoslits of width D ∼12.7 Å and parallelly arranged by a distance d. D is the distance between the center of the carbon atoms of the sheet edges without considering the functional groups COOH. We used the reflector wall protocol, where immaterial walls are placed on the extremity of the simulation box and parallel to the membrane to create a molecular flow through a unique path, as schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Two d different values were considered here: 7 and 10 Å. The simulation box dimensions are 76.5 × 44.2 × 200 Å3. Two types of graphene sheets were considered: graphene oxide (GO) with 35% and 14% content of oxygen (from hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups) atoms, as shown in Fig. 1. To build GO sheets, graphene membranes were functionalized with hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups on the both membrane sides and with carboxyl groups on the sheet edges. In our approach, the interlayer distance and the number of oxygen-containing functional groups are treated independently. In reality, these two variables are related. The amount of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and their ionization in aqueous solution would play important roles on the dispersion of GO sheets and, then, on the interlayer distance. However, our simple model allows us to systematically investigate the contribution of each variable on the separation mechanism. The system configuration was then prepared by placing a water-alcohol liquid reservoir in contact to the fixed membrane. The initial water-ethanol and water-methanol configuration was generated using the Packmol [31] code and equilibrated at ambient pressure (1 atm) and room temperature (300 K) through MD simulations. Once the reservoir is placed in contact to the membrane, the water flow was simulated through controlling the reservoir thermodynamics properties. The reservoir temperature is kept constant at 500 K using a Nosé-Hoover thermostat [32,33] and the pressure is controlled by a movable piston of graphene placed on the bottom of the simulation box. The piston allows the reservoir volume to vary while the water moves into the membrane. The piston position is scaled by the force experienced by the piston as a response of the reaction mixture force. This protocol is very effective to mimic an infinite reservoir by keeping constant the difference of pressure between feed and permeate side. The positions of the atoms of the membrane are kept fixed, so the bonded interaction description for the membrane is not needed. The Lennard-Jones parameters were extracted from CHARMM [34,35] force field for GO and the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules are used to determine the parameters for the cross-interactions [36,37]. Partial charge values were taken from Ref. [38]. The rigid extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model [39] was used to describe water molecules, while the TraPPE force field was used for ethanol and methanol [40]. The van der Waals interactions are truncated at 12 Å, and the long-range Coulomb interactions are computed by utilizing the particle−particle particle-mesh (PPPM) algorithm [41]. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed along the xy-plane containing the membranes, while non-periodic boundaries were used along the z-direction. The MD simulations were carried out using the open source software called large-scale parallel molecular dynamics simulation code (LAMMPS) [42]. Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to probe the water/methanol and water/ethanol co-adsorption at 350 K. Three mixtures with mole fraction equal 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 were considered. The fixed multilayer graphene membrane model and the guest/host interactions using the classical force field formalism were applied as used in the MD simulations. The Ewald summation was also used for calculating the electrostatic interactions while the short-range contributions were computed with a cut-off distance of 12 Å. The GCMC simulations used to estimate the co-adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy were computed using the revised Widom's test particle method [43]."
2,Results and discussion,"The permeability of alcohols (i.e. methanol and ethanol) and water within graphene oxide (GO) membranes were systematically investigated using MD simulations to mimic GO multilayer membranes in contact with a reservoir of water-alcohol mixtures of 0.5 mol fraction. The pure liquid water reservoir was also simulated for comparison purposes. Two types of membranes were built with GO sheets functionalized with hydroxyl and epoxy on both sides and carboxyl groups on the sheet edges, totalizing O/C ratio (number of Oxygen atoms over the number of carbon atoms in the membrane) equal to 35% and 14%, respectively (see Fig. 1). At the simulation runs, the membrane induces the fluid to flow into the nanocapillary channels. The fluid pathway is determined by the nanocapillary network formed from connected interlayer spaces (2D channels), together with the slits in the GO sheets. Two interlayer distances were considered here: 7 Å (GO7) and 10 Å (GO10), while the slit width was fixed to be equals to 12.7 Å, as indicated in Fig. 1. Notice that the interlayer distance does not take into account the functional groups and the carbon Van-der-Waals radius. Thus, the channel width accessible to the solvent are ∼3–4 Å and ∼5–7 Å for CO7 and GO10, respectively (see the calculated pore size distribution in Fig. S1). The flow is driven by the difference in pressure between the inlet of the membrane (at the bottom), which is the water/alcohol reservoir and the outlet of the membrane (on top), which is vacuum. The difference of pressure was controlled by the piston on the bottom of the reservoir in order to keep the same value during the simulation. The water/alcohol separation occurs right after the fluid starts flowing upwards into the membrane. The favorable permeation of water against alcohols is evident in all investigated cases, pointing out that our model is able to qualitatively capture the separation phenomena observed in several experiments [5,10,22]. Fig. 2 shows the flow differences of water vs. Ethanol and water vs. methanol inside GO7 (35%). The graphs display the time evolution of the number of water and alcohol molecules flowing outside the reservoir into the membrane. The membrane becomes filled with water rather than alcohols, as we can observe that the number of water molecules is more than 15 times larger than that of ethanol molecules. The separation of the water-methanol mixture is less pronounced, as one can observe in Fig. 2 b. From an initial inspection, one can see that both alcohol and water strongly interact with the carboxyl groups located at the edges of the GO sheets, which will contribute to further block the entrance of other molecules into the membrane. The easier molecular water permeation is favored due to its smaller size in relation to alcohol molecules (these processes can be better visualized from the videos in the supplementary materials and are supported by Fig. S2). In principle, the membrane would work as a molecular sieving and the size selectivity would be the first explanation for the water/alcohol separation. However, when the porous channel width is increased to 10 Å, both water and alcohol molecules can easily get into the membrane at the initial stages, as shown in Fig. S3. Although the separation is more effective for the cases of narrower channels, the favorable permeation of water can be also observed for the cases of GO10. This suggests that the size selectivity is not the unique relevant factor for the separation process. Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.11.020 The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Another important factor that influences the membrane selectivity is how the molecules flow inside the channels. Fig. 3 a shows the permeability of pure water and water-alcohol mixtures through the GO membranes. These values were obtained by linear fitting of the time evolution of the number of molecules that crossed the membrane (see Fig. S4). Our results show that the water permeation through GO membranes is drastically decreased in presence of alcohols. For instance, the permeability of pure water in GO7 (35%) is 0.25 mol/m2/s/bar, while 5 × 10−2 and 1 × 10−3 mol/m2/s/bar for water-ethanol and water-methanol mixtures, respectively. Comparing the permeability and the percentage of water inside the membrane shown in Fig. 3b, we observe that the permeability is associated with the membrane rejection to alcohol. As discussed in Fig. 2, GO7 (35%) is more efficient for water-ethanol rather than water-methanol separation. Consequently, the percentage of water inside the GO7 (35%) is up to 95% for the water-ethanol case against 67% for the water-methanol case, favoriting the permeation in the first case. In other words, the presence of alcohol molecules inside the membrane strongly hindrance water flow. Further analysis to understand how the amount of oxygen functional groups affects the membrane permeability and selectivity was performed. When O/C ratio is reduced from 35% to 14%, the permeability increases in all cases (i.e. pure water and mixtures), as shown in Fig. 3a. The pure water permeability is enhanced due to the fact that GO (14%) is more hydrophobic with enlarged pristine graphene region and low water friction [44]. Regarding the selectivity, the preference of water penetration inside the membrane against alcohol penetration is drastically reduced with O/C ratio decrease. For instance, the percentage of water inside GO7 (14%) is equal to 52% for the water-ethanol case and 40% for the water-methanol case (see Fig. 3b). Despite that, the number of water molecules that effectively crosses the membrane is significantly larger than the corresponding alcohol molecules (see Fig. S5), evidencing that the separation also occurs in GO7 (14%). To explain the selectivity of GO7 (14%), the water dynamics should be faster than alcohol dynamics in such confinement condition. Indeed, the 2D pore geometry (e.g. a very narrow channel, such as in the GO7, where the molecules are restricted to form only a single molecular layer) forces the fluid diffusion to be essentially two-dimensional. In this condition, the water has intrinsically much faster diffusion than alcohols due to the less steric hindrance effects (size effect) and also to the fact that co-planar water molecules can easily slip inside the 2D channels [45,46]. The fact of having fast water dynamics vs. the slow alcohol dynamics enhances the separation/selectivity mechanism in GO (14%) membranes. To gain further insights on the energetic aspect of guest/membrane interaction, Grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of water/alcohol vapor co-adsorption were performed. Fig. 4 shows the ethanol/water and methanol/water co-adsorption data points and the obtained fit Freunclich [47] isotherms at T = 350 K and mole fraction 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 in the membrane GO7 (35%). At the initial adsorption stages, i.e., at low pressure values, the amount of adsorbed alcohol and water are similar, while at high pressure (>0.1 bar) an effective separation was observed in all studied cases. The separation factor is calculated as α = ( y w a t e r / y a l c o h o l ) / ( x w a t e r / x a l c o h o l ) , where y is the mole fractions in the adsorbed phase and x is the mole fractions in the solution, both at equilibrium. GO7 (35%) is the most effective selective membrane with α equal to 18.1 and 4.5 for water/ethanol and water/methanol, respectively. GCMC simulations indicate that the decreasing order of guest/host affinity is ethanol/GO, methanol/GO and water/GO, with adsorption enthalpy varying around −77, −73 and −64 kJ/mol, respectively (see Table S1). This affinity order is not what we could expect to explain the preferable adsorption of water. Indeed, the first adsorption sites inside the membrane are very similar for both alcohols and water. They mainly interact with the functional groups (e.g. OH, COOH and O-epoxy) via H-bonds, as indicated in the hydrogen-oxygen, g HcaO* (r) and g HhxO* (r), radial distribution function displayed in Fig. 5 . The first adsorption site is not affected neither by the interlayer distance of the membrane nor by the functionalization level. The alcohol molecules firstly interact with COOH groups, while water molecules can interact with OH and O-epoxy even at low uptake (see Fig. S6). The alcohol has additional affinity via hydrophobic interaction of CH3 and CH2 with pristine graphene region, which could explain the higher adsorption enthalpy values compared to water. We have also investigated how the ratio of functional groups present in the GO structure affects the selectivity. When the GO O/C ratio was decreased from 35% to 14% the water/ethanol separation factor decreases from 18.1 to 5.4 for GO7 and from 3.2 to 2.3 for GO10. The water/methanol separation factor was substantially smaller than water/ethanol in all cases. Decreasing O/C ratio, the water/methanol separation factor decreases from 4.5 to 2.0 for GO7 and from 3.2 to 2.8 for GO10 (see Table S2). These selectivity values are quantitatively comparable and sometimes larger them those of porous materials for alcohol/water separation [28,48]. Clearly, the membrane selectivity is enhanced by the functionalization degree, mainly in GO7 membranes. Although the addition of oxygen-containing functional groups increases the interaction sites for both water and alcohol molecules, it could be an additional constrain for the alcohol permeation. On the other hand, when decreasing the O/C ratio, the pristine regions are necessarily increased, then, the membrane becomes more hydrophobic and repulsive to water while being more attractive to alcohol. Then, to explain the preferred water adsorption, the preferable affinity of ethanol must be counter balanced by other effects such as steric hindrance. In other words, the separation phenomenon is not governed by affinities with the membrane (enthalpic mechanism) but rather by the geometry and size factors (entropic mechanism). To confirm this hypothesis a careful analysis of the preferential arrangements for each component was performed. Fig. 6 shows a snapshot of adsorbed molecules inside a single channel for the GO7 (%35) membrane case. The 2D pore geometry imposes the formation of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules. At this configuration, water can easily form 2D H-bonds network with up to 4 H-bonds per water molecule. This configuration is the most energetically favorable. Once the ethanol molecule is adsorbed it would disrupt this network. Ethanol can also form H-bonds via the OH groups but it has limited possibilities for that. The asymmetry of the alcohol molecule additionally to its geometry and large size make its alignment into the monolayer structure more difficult. Moreover, the ethanol has OH group being hydrophilic, while the rest of the ethanol, the C2H5 group, being repulsive to water. This leads to a natural phase separation inside the channels forming alcohol-rich and water-rich islands, similarly to what was observed in experimental analyses [49]. In other words, the adsorption selectivity mechanism is explained by the separation into a water phase, which is more favorable to growth inside the channel vs. an ethanol phase, which is less energetically favorable. Similar mechanism occurs with methanol/water separation. However, since methanol is smaller it has less constraining, the methanol phase is less unfavorable. In summary, there exist a balance among a number of factors that influence the preferable GO water selectivity. Although GO membranes have more affinity to alcohols, they are mostly hydrophilic which also attracts water. The 2D confinement restricts the molecules to stay in layered configurations, which is highly unfavorable for alcohols, while it is strongly favorable for water diffusion. Also, the 2D channel geometry is crucial for an effective separation/selectivity mechanism, since it forces the formation of water monolayers H-bonded network. In other words, the pore geometry of this membrane is crucial feature that assist water selectivity."
3,Conclusion,"A series of molecular dynamics and Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the ethanol/water and methanol/water separation/selectivity through GO membranes with different interlayer distances and levels of functional groups. To rationalize the preferred selectivity of water in nano-confined structures and the effective blocking of alcohol molecules, we have performed deep analysis on the structural molecular arrangements and the permeation mechanisms. We have concluded that both the size exclusion and molecular arrangements within 2D GO channels are responsible for the separation. The probable formation of water monolayer is enhanced by the formation of a robust 2D H-bond network. Moreover, the two-dimensionality of the channels is also an important factor that contributes to the fast water diffusion. The role of the number of oxygen-containing functional groups in the membranes was also investigated and we observed that by increasing the functionalization degree it increases the alcohol/water separation factor. Therefore, we verified that the presence of narrow 2D channels with high functionalization degree, such as in the case of GO7 (35%) (i.e. membranes with interlayer distance of 7 Å and containing 35% of oxygen atoms) appears to be the best configuration for ethanol/water separation. In summary, a balance among permeability, membrane affinity, molecular size exclusion and geometry confinement are present during the separation mechanism and they are key factors for designing more efficient alcohol-water separation membranes."
