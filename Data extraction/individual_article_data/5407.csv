0,Introduction,"The production of biofuels from renewable sources such as plants and algae offers a real alternative to fossil fuels. The use of liquid fossil fuels has a huge impact on the environment greatly contributing to the increase of ecological footprint. Their combustion is directly related to the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Moreover, fossil fuels are limited in supply. Therefore, their employment as main source of primary energy (with a total current contribution of 80% out of global primary energy supply or total primary energy supply, TPES) is regarded unsustainable [1–5]. While some experts claim that the peak oil will occur within 20 years, others uphold that the world is already at peak production. In any case, it is generally agreed that an energy transition is inevitable. This energy transition could involve the transformation of traditional sources such as clean coal technology and nuclear energy, particularly if nuclear fusion becomes commercially possible, and the development of new fuel cell and hydrogen technologies as sustainable options to help meet energy demands [6]. Moreover, recent advances in biotechnology highlight the great potential of fuels derived from biomass. By the moment, only biodiesel and bioethanol are produced at industrial scale, being used for internal combustions engines as alternatives to fossil fuels. In comparison to diesel fuel, biodiesel provides advantages such as net CO2 emissions, zero sulfur emissions, lower CO generation and significant reduction in smoke and more free oxygen, leading to complete combustion [7–9]. It is widely known that vegetable oils are not efficient fuel forms because of their high viscosity and low volatility. There are several methods to overcome high fuel viscosity, including dilution, micro-emulsification and pyrolysis. However, oil (fatty acids) transesterification to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) production is an advantageous technique for this purpose. Biodiesel can be synthesized through the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils (including used cooking and frying oils or UFOs) and animal fats with a short-chain alcohol like methanol or ethanol (alcoholysis), in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts or in catalyst-free processes. In comparison, methanol is preferred over ethanol due to their lower price. The reaction involves the transesterification of the fatty acid molecules from triglycerides (TGs) with a molecule of alcohol (Fig. 1 ) [10–13]. First-generation biodiesel is mainly obtained from food crops such as soybean (America), palm (Asia) and rapeseed (Europe). However, the use of products derived from crops comprises food production for human consumption and animal feedstocks by raising the prices on the raw material markets. In comparison, it is preferable second generation biodiesel, which involves the use of non-edible vegetable oils, animal fats and UFOs, avoiding the competition with crops for food purposes and land clearing [14]. Oils from Karanja (Pongamia pinnata), Jatropha curcas, castor, rubber and jojoba seeds are strong candidates for second-generation biodiesel production since they are not suitable for human consumption due to the presence of toxic compounds [15–21]. However, given that only in USA the replacement of liquid fuels would imply 0.53 billion m3 year−1 of biodiesel, the current levels of fuel consumption could not be realistically addressed by only using oil sources from non-edible crops. In this sense, microalgae oil is a very promising sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production that could help to meet the world needs of transportation fuel [22,23]. Oil from microalgae presents no significant differences from other vegetable oils, but because of the fast-growing rate of cultivation (with growth cycles of few days) and the high level of lipids contained in microalgae biomass (above 50% in dry weight biomass), this feedstock is becoming increasingly popular as oil source for biodiesel production [24]. Microalgae cultivation offers great advantages such as adaptability to several climate types, less water consumption compared to traditional crops and the possibility of using brackish water instead of freshwater. Moreover, microalgae are capable of producing specific compounds at significant concentrations when subjected to chemical/physical stress [25]. In comparison with traditional crops for biodiesel production such as soybean, algae can provide up to 100 times higher biomass yields. Microalgae have a photosynthetic machinery similar to higher plants and although they can grow under heterotrophic conditions, photosynthetic microalgae are more efficient, since the carbon source required for heterotrophic growth is ultimately obtained from photosynthetic crop plants. On the other hand, in terms of carbon footprint, the production of biodiesel from algal biomass benefits from the fact that microalgae capture CO2 via photosynthesis up to 50 times more efficiently versus terrestrial plants. The CO2 sequestrated as lipids can be then reused as biofuels reducing the impact of their combustion [22,26,27]. However, the cultivation of microalgae presents some drawbacks that would need to be overcome in order to increase its sustainability. Thus, it is essential to improve the energy balance of the production process of microalgae, which would lead to the reduction of GHG emissions. The cultivation of microalgae in photobioreactors requires a high energy consumption, which makes it unsustainable. However, the process could become sustainable under some conditions such as the use of open ponds or raceways combined with wastewater treatment [28,29]. Until now, the production of biodiesel from algal biomass has been implemented at laboratory-scale and in small industrial plants. Both the content of lipids and growth rate are key factors that determine the suitability of microalgae species as biodiesel feedstock. These in turns depend on several parameters that include temperature, light exposure (intensity) and CO2 and nutrient concentrations (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus). For instance, the concentration of nutrients such as nitrogen can greatly influence the accumulation of lipids in microalgae cells [30]. Since CO2 concentration is another key factor, several works have specifically focused on the analysis of CO2 sequestration by different microalgae species and their capability for effective fatty acids production [31–33]. In general, it has been found that green microalgae lead to enhanced biodiesel quality versus blue-green and red microalgae, since the daily production rates of lipids by green microalgae are significantly higher in comparison [30]. Suitable microalgae species used for biodiesel include Neochloris oleoabundans, Chlorella sp. and Chlorococcum sp., among others [30]. The transesterification reaction shown in Fig. 1 has been conventionally performed employing acid/alkali catalysts. However, this process poses some drawbacks such as high energy and production costs, the need of separation and purification stages and the release of toxic compounds to the environment. Moreover, the requirements in terms of feedstock composition, i.e. water content and free fatty acids (FFAs), are stricter. The presence of water and FFAs leads to saponification and catalyst deactivation [34]. In comparison, non-catalytic processes under supercritical conditions simplify product purification stages. When the reaction is performed in supercritical alcohol, the process offers higher tolerance towards feedstock composition and enables the achievement of high yields in short reactor times [35]. There are several unsystematic narrative reviews focusing on the production of biofuels from microalgae [22,30,36,37]. This kind of reviews usually includes only the subjective selection of publications by the authors, which may be biased, and often contradict the available evidence and quickly become obsolete [38]. In comparison, this work approaches the production of biodiesel from microalgae under supercritical conditions by a systematic method. A systematic review is defined as a ‘review of the evidence on a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant primary research, and to extract and analyze data from the studies’ [39]. In addition, systematic reviews should attempt to be sensitive, that is, seeking as many studies as possible to minimize bias and to be efficient [40]. Other authors defined systematic reviews as scientific investigations in which the analysis unit is the primary original studies, constituting an essential tool to synthesize the available scientific information, increasing the conclusions validity of the individual studies and identifying areas of uncertainty where research is needed [41]. This study aims to conduct a systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology [42], of non-catalytic supercritical biodiesel production from algae in order to analyze the current status of this research topic and to identify future research strategies. The relevance of a new systematic review on this specific issue is justified by the growing interest for microalgae as feedstock for biodiesel production with exponential rise in research publications in the lasts years [43]. Thus, the PRISMA methodology is comprised in this work offering the following novelties: (i) this methodology is applied for the first time within technological engineering fields, offering an instrument for systematic reviews under critical appraisal criteria, (ii) this is the first specific overview on the production of biodiesel from microalgae under supercritical conditions."
1,Method,
2,Protocol and registration,"2.1 Protocol and registration The design of the present systematic review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. The PRISMA method contains 27 sub-items and comprises the well-define stages of a systematic review such as developing eligibility criteria and describing information sources, search strategies, study selection processes, outcomes and data synthesis [42]. The present systematic approach under the PRISMA perspective covers the developments in the field of biodiesel production from microalgae biomass under supercritical conditions by providing critical analysis on key parameters such as selection of microalgae species, supercritical operational variables and biodiesel properties."
3,Eligibility criteria,"2.2 Eligibility criteria Eligibility criteria, which provide the boundaries of the present systematic review, were chosen in a meeting held by all the authors of the present systematic review and applied to the works identified in the database search step. The eligibility criteria were: Inclusion criteria: 1) works that relate the production of non-catalytic supercritical biodiesel of algae as feedstock; 2) articles published from inception to September 17th 2018; and 3) articles reporting comprehensive results and/or information. Exclusion criteria: 1) unsystematic narrative reviews; 2) works published in a language other than English; 3) dissertations and proceedings of conferences; 4) books or book chapters; 5) editorial material; 6) articles dealing with biodiesel production by using other techniques, other feedstocks, only co-solvents or catalysts as main subject of study. Unsystematic narrative reviews have been comprised in the exclusion criteria since they have to be considered as opinion pieces or guest comments according to the PRISMA methodology [44]."
4,Information sources,"2.3 Information sources The bibliographic search was performed for works published from inception to September 17th, 2018. Although PRISMA statement recommends a full electronic search strategy for at least one major database, the use of only one database does not ensure that all the relevant studies will be found and, therefore, various databases should be searched. In this sense, bibliographical searches across 4 different comprehensive databases were conducted to minimize possible bias. These comprehensive databases were: Scopus (n = 110), Web of Science (n = 274), Science Database (n = 95) and PubMed (n = 24)."
5,Search,"2.4 Search The keywords selected for the search in the comprehensive databases were chosen in a meeting held by all the authors of the present systematic review, since all the authors are experts in the field of biodiesel production using supercritical conditions and, therefore, they are well versed in the terminology of the field. The Boolean strings (using also wildcard) chosen for the present systematic review were: (biodiesel* OR FAME*) AND (supercritical*) AND (algae* OR microalgae* OR seaweed*). The searches included works published in all languages. Scopus database options search were: “title, abstract and keywords”. Web of Science database option search was “theme” in all databases. Both Science Database and PubMed database option search was “all fields”."
6,Study selection,"2.5 Study selection According to the PRISMA methodology, the review team was composed by two authors (PA-M and NG-M) in order to implement measures to minimize random errors and bias at all review stages. Those two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts of the works for potential inclusion. These two authors evaluated them according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria discussed in Eligibility criteria section. Disagreements on whether a given reference should be included or not were resolved through discussion of all the authors of the present systematic review. The 503 works obtained by the four comprehensive databases were crossed with the EndNote X7 software to detect possible duplicated studies. After reviewing the abstract of each of the remaining works, those that were related to the subject of the study were selected. The complete works were downloaded for further assessment when the review team was unsure about whether a given work met or not the inclusion criteria. In addition, the reference list of the selected works was also examined in search of potentially relevant papers; however, no additional works were identified in this step. Finally, a total of 17 articles were found to be eligible for the present systematic review following the full-text eligibility assessment."
7,Data collection,2.6 Data collection Data extraction was performed by the review team due to this review step must be accurate and unbiased. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted from the 17 articles included in the present systematic review using a data extraction form developed for use in the present study. A portion of this data extraction form is presented as Table 1 .
8,Data items,"2.7 Data items The review team performed the data extraction of the 17 selected articles variables for which data were searched comprising those related to the publication of the article (corresponding author/s country, publication year and journal name), material and methods (algae type, % of lipid content, pre-treatment process, algae moisture percentage, solvent type and reactor type) and results (non-catalyst supercritical reaction conditions and maximum yield)."
9,Synthesis of results,"2.8 Synthesis of results No meta-analysis was conducted as the all articles included in the present systematic review lacked sufficient statistical information to calculate the necessary effect sizes, therefore, the present systematic review can be considered a qualitative systematic review [45]. In other words, a synthesis of the results focusing on the discussion of the empirical trends in the data is presented."
10,Results,
11,Study selection,"3.1 Study selection As shown in Fig. 2 , 503 works fit the objective or initial inquiry, and, after the elimination of duplicates works using EndNote X7 software, this number decreased to 379 works. After applying the eligibility criteria, 197 works were eliminated. 22 works, among which the final inclusion of 6 of these works was doubtful, were included in the first screening by the review team that, after discussion with all the authors of the present review, this number was reduced by 5 works. Specifically, the works arising doubtful inclusion were those by Demirbas [46], Zhou et al. [47], Zhou et al. [48], Cao et al. [49], Bi et al. [50] and Demirbas [51]. The text of Demirbas [46] work was not found in the literature, Zhou et al. [47] used the HTL technique to obtain biodiesel, Zhou et al. [48] studied the non-catalytic supercritical biodiesel production using only co-solvents, Cao et al. [49] did not report the algae specie used, Demirbas [51] did not report specific data of biodiesel yields in his Discussion section and Bi et al. [50] used a small and constant amount of CO2 as co-solvent (1.4 MPa). Cao et al. [49] work was finally included in the present systematic review due to the quality of data and information reported, and some of the information reported by both Demirbas [51] and Bi et al. [47] works were used for discussion purposes. Finally, 17 works were included in the final qualitative analysis of the present systematic review. The works that did not meet the inclusion criteria of the present systematic review are provided as Supplementary Material. Although some of the works can be introduced in more than one elimination group, the final criterion was agreed by all the authors of the present systematic review."
12,Study characteristics and results of individual studies,"3.2 Study characteristics and results of individual studies The characteristics and main findings of the 17 selected articles such as algae type, % of lipid content, pre-treatment process, algae moisture percentage, solvent type, non-catalytic supercritical reaction conditions (for optimal performance) and maximum yield are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted that, although the keywords “algae” and “seaweed” has been used in the Boolean string of the present systematic review, only one study has been obtained studying the production of biodiesel from algae [52], while the rest specifically focuses on the use of microalgae species. The 17 identified articles were published between 2011 and 2018. Since the first article on the production of biodiesel using non-catalytic supercritical technology was published in 2001 [68], it is normal that the first articles on the production of biodiesel using non-catalytic supercritical technology using algae as feedstock appeared years later. According to corresponding author address, the articles were published in eight different countries: eight in the United States, two in Iran, two in Spain, one in India, one in Egypt, one in Argentina, one in Japan and one in China. The 17 included articles were published in nine different journals: six in Bioresource Technology, three in Fuel, two in Journal of Supercritical Fluid, one in Energy and Fuel, one in Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effect, one in Applied Energy, one in ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, one in Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification, and one in Energy Conversion and Management."
13,Limitations,"3.3 Limitations The systematic reviews have several advantages but, however, they also have several limitations, which can affect the conclusions. By definition, the present systematic review was limited by the databases used, the search terms chosen and the established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The search strategy was quite exhaustive so it is expected that only relatively few relevant studies were not identified. Only works reported in English were included. This could suggest bias in the search [41,69]. However, as only one non-English study was excluded, the language bias can be considered very low. Finally, as discussed before, the lack of sufficient statistical information made it impossible to combine the results of different studies in a meta-analysis."
14,Discussion,The following sections include detailed information on the production of biodiesel from microalgae oil under supercritical conditions and relevant associated key parameters on the basis of the results obtained in Section 3.
15,Microalgae species as biodiesel feedstock,"4.1 Microalgae species as biodiesel feedstock The importance of the type of microalgae for the production of biodiesel lies on their content of lipids (fatty acids) as well as the extraction capacity of oil from this feedstock. The composition of microalgae comprises carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids (ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids) and lipids in varying amounts. In turns, the content of lipids (and fatty acids) is dependent on culture conditions. The content of lipids can account for a relatively high percentage in some microalgae species, within an average range of 11–40% of total dry matter, i.e. Scenedesmus obliquus (12–14%), Chlorella vulgaris (14–22%), Scenedesmus dimorphus (16–40%). This percentage can be much lower in other microalgae species such as Chlorella pyrenoidosa (2%) and Spirulina platensis (4–9%) [51]. According to Table 1, the most frequent microalgae types used as biodiesel feedstock include Chlorella and Nannochloropsis species. As representative profile, the lipid content of Nannochloropsis sp. (50% on dry weight biomass basis) has been reported to be formed by over 37% of TGs, over 8% of isoprenoids and over 3.5% of polars, glycolipids and phospholipids [53]. In other microalgae species, such as Nannochloropsis salina, the percentage of TGs can account for up to 70–75% out of total lipids [56,67]. For specific fatty acid profiles, it also varies according to microalgae species. For example, in the case of green microalga Schizochytrium limacinum, with a lipid content of 55 wt% of dry biomass, specific fatty acid composition has been reported to be formed mostly by palmitic acid (43 wt%) and docosahexaenoic acid (25 wt%) followed by linoleic acid (12 wt%) and other minority fatty acids (e.g. myristic acid, linolenic acid, stearic acid with relative proportions below 3 wt%) [50]. As case study, Demirbas et al. [51] analyzed the properties of microalga and macroalga species (Chlorella protothecoides and Cladophora fracta, respectively) and respective oil profiles in order to compare their suitability as biodiesel feedstock. The percentage of lipids determined from microalgae dry matter was clearly higher (29.4%) in comparison with macroalgae (14.2%). Moreover, microalga species provided higher calorific values (HHV) (25 MJ kg−1 versus 21 MJ kg−1 for macroalga species). As was pointed out, the profile of fatty esters derived from fatty acids is a relevant parameter in determining the final fuel properties. In comparative terms, higher proportions of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids are preferred in oil profiles. In general, algae contain a significant amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids increases, the resulting fuel (biodiesel) can offer stability issues and could be subjected to undesired polymerization processes during combustion [51]. In this case, Chlorella protothecoides presented a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (62% out of total fatty acids) versus Cladophora fracta (51%). In contrast, the advantage of polyunsaturated fatty acids lies on their liquefaction points, which are lower than those of monounsaturated and saturated ones, providing biodiesel with some enhanced properties (i.e. cloud point or freezing point) for cold weather conditions. The clearest advantage of microalgae versus macroalgae is their superior growing rates. Other biodiesel production works have also addressed the comparison of different microalgae types both in terms of cultivation and subsequent in situ transesterification. Jazzar et al. [59] assessed the growth rates for Chlorella sp. and Nannochloris sp. by using a two stage strategies both in bath and continuous mode. As commented above, Chlorella sp. is one of the most frequently used microalgae types for biodiesel production. In the first case, Chlorella sp. reached stationary growth after 7 days, while Nannochloris sp. offered longer constant increase growth rate up to 12 days, after which its grows began to stabilize, with finals biomass concentrations of 1.69 and 2.25 g L−1, respectively. However, in continuous mode, both species reached steady phase growth after 6 days, offering productivities of 318 and 256 mg L−1d−1, respectively. Lipid analysis showed that Nannochloris sp. had higher lipid content than Chlorella sp. (12 and 21 wt%, respectively, of dry and ass free biomass). When employed for transesterification reaction in supercritical methanol, FAME yield obtained for Chlorella sp. was higher (up to 45 wt%) in comparison with Nannochloris sp. (21 wt%), for the same reaction conditions (methanol-to-dry microalgae ratio -vol./wt.- 10:1, 265 °C and 50 min of reaction time). This would suggest that Nannochloris sp. would require more severe reaction conditions to achieve higher FAME yields. To sum up, the profile of oils from microalgae is directly responsible for final biodiesel properties. Several important factors such as percentage of lipid content and profile of fatty acids (saturates, monounsaturates and polyunsaturates) determine production efficiency, fuel properties and combustion performance. Moreover, for integrated processes including microalgae biomass cultivation, growth rates and e.g. daily biomass productivity would also need to be analyzed in order to find a robust process to ensure continuous feedstock supply."
16,Oil extraction process,"4.2 Oil extraction process Biodiesel production from microalgae oil can be accomplished in a two-step process via extraction-conversion or in a one-step process that integrates extraction with conversion in a single stage. If biodiesel production is the whole purpose of microalgae processing, the extraction stage in a two-step process becomes expensive and is the process that uses the most energy. Microalgae are formed by rigid cell walls and the processes of extraction, drying and cell disruption are energy intensive [49]. To this regard, wall structure, lipid placement and lipid content are important parameters in determining the final cost of the extraction stage. In this sense, it has been reported that the net energy ratio (NER), defined as the ratio of the total energy produced over the total energy consumed by each step, was higher than 1 when the economic feasibility of a whole biodiesel conversion process from Nannochloropsis gaditana, using a reduced number of operating steps, was measured [58]. Thus, a process can be considered economically feasible if its NER is higher than 1. The most used methods for oil extraction from microalgae include solvent extraction (generally organic solvents such as hexane), mechanical cell disruption (i.e. grinding, bead-milling and high pressure homogenizer) and extraction based on supercritical fluids. Among them, supercritical conditions can provide high extraction percentages (up to 100%) with high selectivity (oil purity). The use of solvent remains less efficient (<75%) and can pose environmental issues when employing solvents of organic nature [51]. For example, supercritical CO2 can be used for this purpose, in which liquefied CO2 under high pressure and temperature behaves as liquid and gas extraction solvent. Some works have compared several methods for the extraction of microalgae oil with subsequent production of biodiesel in a two-step process. Fushimi and Umeda [62] assessed the performance of Fistulifera solaris oil extracted by two different methods: extraction based on the use of an organic solvent (chloroform) and extraction through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). In the first case, microalgae were firstly subjected to freeze-drying and then to extraction with a solution of methanol/chloroform, using chloroform as oil recovery phase. In the HTL method, subcritical water in the presence of argon (575 K, 10 MPa) was used in an autoclave-type reactor. After cooling, solid products and liquid phases were separated by filtration and the liquid phase was then subjected to oil extraction by using acetone and hexane. Oil extraction yields of both methods were comparable (45% for solvent extraction and 43% for HTL). The two types of oils were converted into FAMEs in supercritical methanol (593 K, 13 MPa) at different reaction times (10–60 min) and at two methanol-to-oil molar ratios (42:1 and 21:1, respectively). According to the results, the FAME yields obtained with the two fraction oils from microalgae were notably different. FAME yield was found to be higher for the oil obtained with HTL (75–80%) in comparison with the oil obtained by solvent extraction (48–64%) for all the reaction conditions analyzed. As seen, the extraction method can greatly affect final FAME yield. For the methods just discussed, the authors found that the content of FFAs was promoted in the oil extracted by HTL process versus that obtained by solvent extraction, whose esterification is favored in supercritical conditions. Moreover, resulting FAMEs were more resistant to undesired thermal decomposition or isomerization over time. Similarly, Srivastava et al. [66] employed a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water with a Bligh and Dyer method for the extraction of lipids from Chlorella biomass. While lipids and other nonpolar compounds remained in the chloroform phase, the rest of polar constituents and pigments were separated in the methanol/water phase. As previously commented, this type of method requires further treatment of the recovery phase for chloroform evaporation. Extraction yield by this method was not reported. Extracted oil was then subjected to transesterification in supercritical methanol (two-step process) with conversion yields as high as 98.12%. Hydrothermal liquefaction was also applied by Yang et al. [63] in a two-step process, for the extraction of oil from Chlorella biomass. The process was performed in an induction reactor at 350 °C for 1 h. The extraction stage included the use of dichloromethane as organic phase for crude bio-oil recovery, which was subjected to evaporation for solvent separation, obtaining 34 wt% of recovery oil on dry biomass. Biocrude was then treated in ethanol (at temperatures from 210 to 290 °C in a wide range of reaction time, from 0.5 to 4 h). It is worth noting that HTL process even uses organic solvents in the final extraction steps, which would remain as a drawback versus the process in which oil extraction and transesterification reaction are performed simultaneously in a single-stage process under supercritical conditions. Other treatment processes has been applied to microalga biomass to obtain derived biochars for the direct conversion of lipids into biodiesel in a two-step process. Levine et al. [55] subjected Chlorella protothecoides feedstock to hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to obtain lipid rich hydrochars for conversion in a non-catalytic supercritical ethanol process. Briefly, HTC comprised the preheating of biomass and vacuum filtering followed by carbonization (e.g. 215 °C for 30 min). The supercritical transesterification of resulting hydrochars was proved as an efficient method for biodiesel production, with high final yields of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) up to 89% at 275 °C (at 20:1 ethanol: fatty acid molar ratio). As commented above, another method to extract lipids from algal biomass in two-step processes consists of the use of supercritical CO2. Patil et al. [67] employed this method for the extraction of lipids from Nannochloropsis salina using a constant flow of CO2 under 340 bar and 80 °C after 60 min. Following this method, a total extraction yield of up to 30% was achieved on total algal lipid on dry basis. In one-step supercritical processes, extraction of microalgae is performed in situ, as previously mentioned. The cell walls of microalgae are broken down in the process due to the severe conditions and lipids reach the reaction media for subsequent transesterification (Fig. 3 ). Thus, extraction and transesterification of microalgae biomass are performed simultaneously. As will be widely discussed later, this one-step method tolerates relatively high water content and thus wet biomass of microalgae can be directly discharged in the reactor. This offers an additional advantage versus other synthesis methods. Patil et al. [54] compared the performance of a single-stage supercritical methanol method for the conversion of Nannochloropsis biomass with the yield of a microwave assisted transesterification process. The first method was studied for reaction times of 10–30 min, reaction temperatures of 240–260 °C and methanol-to-wet microalgae (wt./vol.) ratios of 4:1, 8:1 and 12:1. The microwave assisted process involves the drying of microalga biomass as previous stage, which is mixed with methanol and KOH (catalyst) prior to the discharge in the reactor. Microwave irradiation assisted transesterification was analyzed for reaction times from 3 to 9 min, at catalyst amounts of 1–3 wt% of dry biomass and methanol-to dry microalgae biomass ratios (wt./vol.) of 9:1–15:1. According to the results, microwave irradiation method allowed higher FAME yield (80%) in very short reaction times (4–5 min), at temperatures of 60–64 °C and for an optimal methanol ratio of 12:1. In comparison, optimal conditions for supercritical method required 9:1 methanol ratio, reaction temperature of 255 °C and 25 min reaction time. Despite the severe conditions in supercritical methanol, this process tolerates water content while irradiation-assisted methods require the drying of the biomass. In addition, supercritical methanol reduces total energy costs since downstream processing in terms of purification is much less intensive. In addition, supercritical process provided higher quality in final products free of toxic solvent residues and with higher thermal stability [54]."
17,Effect of type and excess of solvent,"4.3 Effect of type and excess of solvent Short-chain alcohol such as methanol and ethanol are frequently used in supercritical conditions. The amount of alcohol involved in the transesterification reaction of microalgae oil is another of the key parameters that needs to be optimized. Under supercritical conditions, the hydrogen bonding in the alcohol molecules is weakened and then they can act as free monomers. An excess of alcohol is required to break the bonds between fatty acids and glycerin and to achieve complete and fast conversion of TGs, and to provide a homogenous reaction phase reducing the critical temperature of the total mixture. At the same time, as the amount of alcohol employed increases, the separation of fuel product from the methanol phase becomes more energy intensive [58]. The effect of the variation of the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio (or alternatively the ratio of alcohol-to-dry microalgae) on FAME yield has been commonly addressed. For one-stage processes, optimal methanol-to-dry microalgae weight ratios have been found in the interval 8–10:1 (vol./wt.). Jazzar et al. [58] studied the in-situ transesterification of the marine microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana in supercritical methanol (538 K, >8.09 MPa, 35 min) at different methanol-to-dry microalgae weight ratios in the range 6–12:1 vol./wt. (equivalent to 588–1177:1 methanol-to-lipid molar ratio). A maximum FAME yield of over 41% was obtained at 10:1 vol./wt., decreasing below 32% at a ratio of 6:1. While a balanced ratio favors the contact between reactants, excessive use of methanol can cause the inhibition of the transesterification reaction and hinder the separation of glycerin from fatty acids due to enhanced solubility, reducing FAME yield. The behavior of individual FAME yields was similar to that of global yields. Similar results were obtained by Patil et al. [53], observing that methanol-to-wet microalgae ratio had a beneficial effect up to values of 9:1 for the direct transesterification of oil from Nannochloropsis sp. at 250 °C (for <30 min of reaction time). In this case, FAME yield was much higher reaching an optimal FAME yield of over 84%. The negative effect beyond 9:1 was attributed by the authors to the decrease of the critical temperature of the mixture or due to promoted FAME decomposition in combination with high temperature. This ratio 9:1 (alcohol-to-microalgae dry weight, vol./wt.) was also found optimal by Reddy et al. [56] using the same microalgae type in a single supercritical transesterification process at 260 °C (after 20 min of reaction time) but using ethanol instead of methanol, with a final FAEE yield of 60%. In this case, additional adverse mechanisms are proposed for ratios beyond 9:1, such as the auto-oxidation of intermediates like organic substrates and FAEES, which leads to the generation of unstable hydroperoxides. Similar optimal ratio was also reported by Njafabadi et al. [57] but in this case considering wet Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass. In this work, the ratio was varied from 4:1 to 16:1 and optimal ratio was 8:1 in supercritical conditions at 256 °C. Fushimi and Umeda [62] also studied the effect of methanol-to-oil ratio from 42:1 to 21:1 on FAME yield using respective solvent-extracted and HTL based extracted oils (from Fistulifera solaris microalgae) in a two-step process, observing in both cases that decreasing alcohol excess led to lower yields. In the case of oil extracted with hexane, FAME yields decreased from 64 to 48%, while for the HTL-derived oil, FAME yield decreased from 80 to 75%. In both cases, methyl palmitoleate ester (C16:1(cis-9)) resulted more sensitive to the variation of alcohol excess. The same effect was reported by Shirazi et al. [65] using Spirulina platensis oil in a one-step process, this time considering methanol-to-dry weight microalgae ratio within the interval 4:1–12:1. Moreover, as special case, Shirazi et al. [65] approached the use of co-solvent such as n-hexane in the direct supercritical process in addition to methanol, showing that the presence of a co-solvent has a negative effect on final FAME yield and thus it was unnecessary. The addition of a co-solvent seems to reduce the concentration of reactants and their density, reducing the overall yield. The just discussed work contrasts with the findings reported by Najafabadi et al. [57], which also assessed the use of different co-solvents in addition to methanol employing wet Chlorella vulgaris oil, namely diethyl ether, hexane and chloroform, at ratios of 4:1 to 8:1 (co-solvent-to-wet microalgae biomass) for a fixed methanol ratio of 8:1, which was found optimal when employed as the only solvent process. While diethyl ether and hexane proved to increase process efficiency, chloroform offered negative effects. Optimal ratios of co-solvents were established at 6:1 and 4:1 for diethyl ether and chloroform, respectively. However, FAME yields were relatively low in all cases, below 10%, which may suggests that there is another options for yield improvement beyond co-solvent use, which would increase the cost of the process. Although methanol is the most frequent short-chain alcohol used for supercritical transesterification, ethanol is also employed as alcohol source. In comparison with methanol, ethanol is less toxic and poses fewer safety risks. However, the extraction of methanol-derived FAMEs from reaction media is easier in comparison with FAEEs since the latter tend to form stable emulsions. Finally, as commented in the introduction part, the cost of ethanol remains significantly higher than that of methanol, and thus methanol is still widely preferable. As representative case of ethanol use, Levine et al. [55] analyzed the effect of ethanol excess on the transesterification reaction using hydrochars from microalgae biomass, also founding that higher ethanol loadings (here expressed as ethanol: fatty acid molar ratio) can increase biodiesel yield but with a limited effect. In fact, with small excess of alcohol (5:1 EtOH: fatty acid molar ratio) was possible to achieve high biodiesel yields of 79% after 150 min. The effect of reaction time on FAEE yield clearly surpassed that of ethanol excess, and yield improvement with high ethanol loading was especially evident for long reaction times. This suggests that for long reaction times when equilibrium is reached, ethanol help to avoid polymerization and thermal decomposition of FAEEs, due to increased reactant dilution or/and free radical stabilization. Other less frequent solvents have been employed for supercritical transesterification of microalgae oil. Supercritical methyl acetate (a carboxylate ester, CH3COOCH3) was used by Patil et al. [67] in order to show that glycerin-free biodiesel could be obtained. Instead of glycerin, triacetin is generated during the transesterification reaction. In this case, triacetin is miscible with FAMEs and can be jointly used as fuel. This process offers great advantages in terms of purification costs of final products. To study the effect of CH3COOCH3 excess, solvent-to-total lipid ratio was varied in the range from 20:1 to 50:1 (for a fixed temperature of 310 °C, 100 bar and 60 min of reaction time). Optimal molar ratio was found at 40:1 methyl acetate to total lipid, obtaining a total biodiesel fuel yield (considering FAMEs and triacetin) as high as 80% (equivalent to 72% FAME yield). In this case, CH3COOCH3 acts both as solvent and acidic catalyst. However, it must be noted that this solvent displays lower reactivity compared to methanol, and thus the process need to be operated at higher temperatures in comparison with methanol. Finally, as another case of co-solvent use, supercritical CO2 was employed along with supercritical methanol by Bi et al. [50] for the in situ transesterification of the green microalgae Schizochytrium l. In this case, CO2 (1.4 MPa) is added into the reaction media to improve the extraction of lipids and the total overall yield. The specific effect of CO2 as co-solvent on the process is not approached in this works by performing experiments in the presence and in the absence of CO2. Maximum FAME yield of 64% was obtained in the process at optimal conditions."
18,Effect of temperature and reaction time,"4.4 Effect of temperature and reaction time Transesterification reaction in supercritical conditions can be greatly influenced by temperature and reaction time. Moreover, both factors are of special relevance in determining the efficiency of the process (productivity and economy). As commented in the introduction part, transesterification of microalgae oil under supercritical conditions requires much shorter times for optimal FAME yield (usually <50 min) in comparison with non-supercritical conditions. The effect of time and temperature on FAME yield can be studied as separate factors or simultaneously in order to analyze their interaction. These two parameters need to be balanced. Although it could be said that high temperature and long reaction times generally increase FAME yield, thermal decomposition of products can occur above certain values [70]. Optimization studies employing response surface methodology (RSM) has shown that temperature is the most significant variable on transesterification efficiency. High temperatures decrease hydrogen bond strength in alcohol molecules (e.g. methanol), making it possible to act as free monomers. Srivastava et al. [66] studied the influence of temperature, reaction time and methanol-to-oil molar ratio by RSM technique. Optimal temperatures were found at 270 °C for 30 min of reaction time and 30:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio. The three parameters were studied in wide ranges. While temperature was varied from 240 to 300 °C, reaction times and methanol-to-oil ratio were varied in the intervals from 15 to 45 min and from 15:1 to 45:1, respectively, founding that temperature displays the larger effect on FAME conversion. Moreover, for the given intervals, the effect of varying reaction time was more significant in comparison with methanol excess. Experimental results were also used for the successfully modelling of the process by advanced techniques such as genetic algorithm (GA). Predicted results by GA optimization offered only a deviation of 1% from experimental results. Jazzar et al. [58] studied the direct transesterification of microalgae Nannochloropsis gaditana by varying the temperature of reaction within the range 245–290 °C. For each temperature, reaction time was analyzed in the interval 10–50 min. Highest FAME yields were obtained for intermediates values inside the range 255–265 °C after 50 min of reaction time, observing increasing total FAME yields over time, being optimal at 265 °C (45.8 wt% FAME yield). This trend remained the same for individual FAMEs. However, at extreme values of the range (245 °C and 290 °C), FAME yield was clearly affected. For temperatures over 275 °C, the decrease of FAME yield was attributed to the decomposition of unsaturated FAMEs due to excessive temperature (thermal decomposition). This phenomena has been also observed for temperatures higher than 275 °C in other works such as Levine et al. [55]. In such case, ethanol was employed for the supercritical alcoholysis of microalgae-derived hydrochars and the resulting FAEEs was clearly lower for temperatures beyond 275 °C, with a yield decay above 10% for 285 °C after 90 min in comparison with 275 °C after the same time. In addition to the effect on the temperature on the decomposition of unsaturated fatty acids, the presence of other components in the feedstock (hydrochars) of non-lipid nature (e.g. acidic or metallic components) can help to accelerate their degradation. However, decomposition can also occurred for lower temperatures. Patil et al. [53] reported that at relatively low temperatures of 255 °C and 8.2 MPa (<30 min of reaction time) decomposition was observed and caused by the isomerization of cis carbon bonding into trans-type carbon bonding which leads to the formation of unstable fatty acids. When using supercritical ethanol, lower maximum temperatures than 275 °C have been reported to avoid biodiesel product decomposition. Specifically, Reddy et al. [56] found that for temperatures equal to and above 270 °C thermal degradation of unsaturated FAEEs could take place, since final FAME yield was lower than at 265 °C using Nannochloropsis salina microalgae (optimal FAME yield of 70% was determined for an ethanol-to-microalgae dry weight of 9:1 and 20 min of reaction time). Even though, the FAEE yield was higher than that obtained at 260 °C, showing the positive effect of temperature on transesterification reaction. The same positive effect was for reaction time (at 260 °C) on FAEE yield. Increasing times up to 20 min also offered increasing FAEE yield, but it remained stable beyond this time (up to 30 min). However, for higher temperatures such as 300 °C, time needs to be limited due to thermal decomposition of final biodiesel constituents. In line whit this results, for very short reaction times, decomposition temperature of biodiesel product can occur at higher temperatures than 275 °C. Lit et al. [60] found that for a reaction time of up to 10 min, the decomposition of FAMEs took place above 350 °C (for a fixed pressure of 200 bar and 9:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio). For reaction times as short as 4 min, decomposition of biodiesel product seems to be even negligible for a temperature of 400 °C. For such conditions, a maximum conversion of 95.5% can be achieved (FAME yield is not reported, which would give a better idea of the efficiency of the process) by using Chlorella protothecoides oil in a one-step transesterification reaction. On the other hand, the effect of temperature can be differentiated from subcritical and supercritical conditions. Shirazi et al. [65] compared the effect of this parameter in the two temperature ranges in a one-step process using Spirulina microalgae and methanol. At temperatures below critical point (200 and 225 °C), the impact of increasing temperature is much less pronounced than in the case of supercritical conditions (250–300 °C). To this regards, it is interesting to dwell on the reaction mechanism. Since biodiesel generation implies two stage reactions, i.e. in-situ lipid extraction and subsequent transesterification reaction, under subcritical conditions the extraction mechanism is the limiting mechanism because of their low solubility in methanol. On the contrary, at supercritical temperatures, the solubility of lipids is clearly enhanced and reaction yields increases with reaction time. Bi et al. [50] also compared the process yield in subcritical and supercritical methanol conditions (employing CO2 as co-solvent) for the transesterification of green microalgae from 170 °C to 290 °C, for reaction times between 30 and 120 min (for a fixed methanol-to-lipid molar ratio of 75:1). For these conditions, it was also found that reaction temperature clearly affects yield process. In this case, FAME yield increases with temperature up to 250 °C. At 290 °C, lower yields are obtained due to decomposition of FAMEs. On the other hand, for the lowest temperatures (below 210 °C), FAME yield increases with temperature for the whole range from 30 to 120 min. For temperatures above 210 °C, long reaction times decrease reaction yield. For example, at 250 °C, optimal reaction time was found at 30 min, as in other works. As in other cases, temperature and reaction time can be balanced to obtain high yields. Under the same conditions, a FAME yield of 60% can be achieved at 250 °C after 30 min reaction time and a FAME yield of 64% can be obtained at 210 °C after 120 min of reaction time. At these similar reactions yields, energy costs would need to be approached for decision-making process. It is worth noting that low activation energy (Ea) has been estimated for the direct reaction conversion of microalgae lipids into biodiesel product in comparison with other vegetable oils. Amin et al. [52] reported that the estimated Ea of the conversion of algal oil under supercritical conditions is 9.9 kJ mol−1. When modelling the process, it was found that the supercritical transesterification is of first order (based on the conversion of TGs). In comparison with the Ea required, for example, for the conversion of pongamia or sunflower oil, which are 58.4 kJ mol−1 [71] and 79.8 kJ mol−1 [52], respectively, the Ea for algal conversion is significantly lower."
19,Effect of pressure,"4.5 Effect of pressure In several studies, pressure is not a specific control variable, but it is a consequence of the mixture conditions for a given temperature and reaction time. Generally, temperature reaction is fixed and pressure is measured for a given time. Methanol has mild supercritical conditions (Tc > 240 °C, Pc > 8.09 MPa). When studied as separate variable, maintaining the rest of parameters unchanged, it is generally observed that when pressure is enough to maintain the reaction in homogenous state and the reaction time is suitable to reach equilibrium conversion, the effect of pressure do not provide significant improvement on reaction efficiency. Thus, Liu et al. [60] observed that for fixed temperatures and reaction times within the intervals of 350–385 °C and 6–10 min, respectively, only improvements of <2% was observed in conversion reaction when pressure was increased from 15 to 20 MPa. The progressive increase from 20 to 30 MPa (for 350 °C and 12 methanol-to-oil molar ratio) reported no changes on conversion. Thus, beyond 15 MPa no significant effects were observed and this was considered enough for favorable reaction conditions. Similar results were obtained by Nan et al. [61] for the transesterification reaction of Chlorella protothecoides oil in supercritical methanol and ethanol, respectively, with optimal pressure values of 15 and 20 MPa, proving that these values were enough to provide good mixing of the reactants with methanol/ethanol (no appearance of two or multi phases)."
20,Effect of water content,"4.6 Effect of water content Water content is another parameter that affects synthesis of biodiesel from microalgae in supercritical conditions [58]. While it has been reported that low content of water in microalgae can promote biodiesel production through hydrolysis of transesterificable lipids and subsequent esterification of the released fatty acids to FAMEs, a high content of water in algae (concentrated paste) dilutes the system, thereby reducing reaction rate, and facilitates the hydrolysis of FAMEs, resulting in lower FAME yields. The positive effect of water content was observed by Nan et al. [61] for the transesterification reaction of Chlorella protothecoides oil in both supercritical ethanol and methanol. Within the interval of water content of 0–10 wt%, an optimal water content of 7.5 wt% was found for the transesterification reaction in supercritical methanol (320 °C, 15.2 MPa, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 19:1) to obtain a FAME yield of 90.8% and in supercritical ethanol (300 °C, 20 MPa, alcohol-to-oil ratio of 33:1) to achieve a FAEE yield of 87.5%. As indicated above, moderate water contents can favor transesterification process through hydrolysis and esterification reactions. Moreover, the presence of water in the process allowed a lower alcohol-to-oil molar ratio to be used, which also offers a significant finding since it would reduce the cost of purification process (removal of alcohol). Other authors have observed neutral and negative effects from a given concentration on FAME yield. Fushimi and Umeda [62] reported that by adding up to 2.5 wt% in the process, water had no impact on FAME yield (using microalgae oil in a two-step process). However, above 5.0 wt% FAME yield resulted clearly affected. Other negative effects derived from the presence of water have been provided by Shirazi et al. [65], which used Spirulina platensis oil in a direct supercritical process. In this case, water content (humidity) was varied within the range 0–80 wt% (by microalgae dry weight) and a negative effect of water presence was observed indicating possible reasons such as the reversion of the esterification reaction and the formation of a water layer around biomass that would hinder the transport of lipids into reaction media. Another way to compare the effect of water on the process consist of the assessment of concentrated paste formed by wet microalgae biomass for direct transesterification in one-step process in comparison with that obtained from lyophilized powder. Jazzar et al. [58] used N. gaditana derived-biomass for this purpose. When comparing FAME yields under the same conditions of temperature and reaction time, 47.8 wt% was achieved with lyophilized powder, which was slightly higher than that obtained with wet microalgae biomass (255 °C, 50 min), with a yield of 45.8 wt% This would indicate that water content would affect to only some extent transesterification in supercritical methanol. The effect of water content was also assessed comparing the performance yielded by dry or wet hydrochars obtained through the carbonization of Chlorella protothecoides biomass [55]. Wet hydrochars usually present water content within the range of 40–60 wt%, which represents a high moisture amount. In comparison, dry hydrochars (e.g. at 65 °C for 1 h) can retain as much as 5–10 wt% water content. The use of both types of wet or dry feedstock can offer a good idea of how these high and low moisture contents can affect supercritical process. Levine et al. [55] found that only 40% FAEE yield could be achieved with wet hydrochars after 60 min of reaction, while this percentage could be increased up to 70% with dry hydrochars. FAEE yield could not be even enhanced with higher alcohol excess, when increasing ethanol loading from 5:1 to 10:1 ethanol-to-fatty acid molar ratio. As seen, several works have shown the possibility of successfully using wet microalgae biomass even in unwashed conditions [58,59]. Another option consists of the use of partially dried microalgae biomass. Hegel et al. [64] studied the transesterification of Neochloris oleoabundans at high methanol ratios (423:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio) at temperatures from 250 to 280 °C (and pressures of 10.5 to 13.0 bar). Biomass with final water content of 25 wt% after partial drying (60 °C for 6 h) was obtained from initial biomass with high water content of 80 wt%. The maximum FAME yield was obtained at 11 wt% (respect to dry microalgae biomass). On the other hand, in a further step, the authors analyzed the extraction process of products (downstream processing) by using two alternative solvents, n-hexane and supercritical CO2. The produced bio oils were extracted with n-hexane with final FAME content of 35 wt%. This yield was improved by the use of supercritical CO2 up to a biodiesel product with FAME content of 74 wt%. Although several authors report that the content of water have not effect on biodiesel yield to some extent, looking at the results summarized in Table 1, it can be generally concluded that wet microalgae biomass lead to lower FAME yields in comparison with the use of dry microalgae biomass [59]."
21,Properties of final product,"4.7 Properties of final product The properties of the final biodiesel product greatly influence fuel combustion performance. Several authors have focused on the assessment of the chemical composition, molecular structure and other relevant physicochemical properties of the final product obtained from microalgae biomass under supercritical conditions as well as their combustion performance. Cao et al. [49] compared the properties of biodiesel obtained from microalgae in a non-catalytic supercritical methanol process with those of conventional petroleum diesel. In terms of elemental composition, both types of fuel showed H/C ratio higher than 1.60, although it was higher for conventional diesel (1.85). This parameter is relevant since increasing H/C ratio leads to higher fuel quality. Low nitrogen content also enhances combustion performance in addition to reduce the generation of NOx emissions. Biodiesel offered in this case lower nitrogen content (0.04%) in comparison with conventional diesel (0.15%). Calorific values were similar for both types of fuels (44 MJ kg−1 for biodiesel and 45 MJ kg−1 for diesel). While some physical properties such as density, solidifying point and acid value were also comparable, kinematic viscosity (at 20 °C) and cold filter plugging were significantly different. The values obtained for biodiesel derived from microalgae were clearly higher (10 mm2 s−1 and 8 °C for biodiesel versus 3.6 mm2 s−1 and 3 °C for conventional diesel), suggesting in principle poorer fuel performance at low temperature. The blend of biodiesel with fossil fuel can be a strategy to overcome these problems or by adding pour point depressants. For example, when glycerol fatty acid ester is added at a concentration of 0.02%, kinematic viscosity and cold filter plugging point greatly decreases. Generally, the main components of biodiesel are long-chain FAMEs, (or FAEEs, if ethanol is used as alcohol instead of methanol), along with other chemical constituents such as ethers and phenols. To a lesser extent, small quantities of alkanes are also possible. Cao et al. [49] found that almost 70% (relative percentage) of biodiesel from microalgae were formed by palmitic acid methyl ester (C17H34O2) and that 15% corresponded to myristic acid methyl ester (C15H30O2). These long chain FAMEs provides biodiesel with higher values of kinematic viscosity and cold filter plugging points compared to conventional diesel. Finally, the authors suggest that polysaccharide and protein molecules from microalgae can decompose during supercritical biodiesel synthesis and may recombine taking part in the esterification reaction and generating low molecular weight esters. Other components from algal biomass such as other low weight organic compounds and water are not involved in the reaction due to limited solubility with oil, being present in the final product. Other varying composition has been reported for final biodiesel product. Srivastava et al. [66] used Chlorella oil for the transesterification in supercritical methanol in a two-step process, with the analysis of final biodiesel showing major relative proportion of oleic acid (33%) and palmitic acid methyl ester (28%) followed by palmitoleic acid (8%) and linoleic acid (8%) among others fatty acids. Among majority fatty acids, a total of 33% corresponded to saturates and 52% to unsaturates. Other relevant physico-chemical properties such as cetane number were also found high (178.64 mg g−1). High cetane number is favorable to minimize obnoxious emissions. Moreover, the oxidation stability was found to be above 12 h, with a HHV of almost 34 MJ kg−1. Reddy et al. [56] also reported detailed analysis of final biodiesel product when using Nannochloropsis salina derived-biomass in supercritical ethanol. For optimal FAEE yield, the main components of biodiesel comprised respective hexadecanoic (C16:0) and hexadecenoic (C16:1) acids ethyl esters, with relative proportions of up to 45 and 38%. The presence of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) was below 1.2%, which is in good agreement with fuel requirements. Finally, the energy content analysis of biodiesel revealed 43 MJ kg−1, which is comparable to conventional diesel fuel."
22,Conclusions,"Microalgae biomass has gained increasing interest as biodiesel feedstock in recent years due to high lipid content and fast growth rates. Moreover, supercritical conditions can improve some of the constraints posed by subcritical catalytic transesterification of microalgae oil, namely very long reaction times, the need for a very high excess of alcohol and low tolerance towards feedstock composition. In this systematic review, performed by the PRISMA methodology, several key works using two and one-step supercritical transesterification processes have been widely discussed showing the advantages and drawbacks of respective production strategies. In general, two-step processes require a previous extraction stage that usually employs organic solvents for microalgae oil recovery. This may increase overall operational costs versus direct use of microalgae biomass in single-step reactions, in which extraction and transesterification take place simultaneously. Moreover, the influence of important factors such as lipid content of microalgae and operational variables such as solvent (alcohol) excess, temperature, reaction time, pressure and water content have been analyzed. Among them, temperature and reaction time are of great relevance and need to be balanced in order to obtain high FAME yield while avoiding thermal decomposition of biodiesel products. Transesterification in supercritical alcohol can offer tolerance towards water content but also need to be carefully studied in order to find optimal humidity conditions. The direct use of wet microalgae biomass offers great advantages in term of pretreatment savings. Several works have shown that it is possible to successfully convert this type of biomass into biodiesel product (even unwashed wet biomass), although with generally lower FAME yields. Future works may delve into this research line trying to enhance biodiesel yields by directly using wet biomass and through the development of integrated processes that involve both microalgae cultivation and biodiesel production."
