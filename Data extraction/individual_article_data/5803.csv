0,Introduction,"CdS has been widely utilized for photocatalytic H2 evolution due to its narrow band gap, proper conduction band and high quantum efficiency. Nevertheless, pure CdS still cannot meet the requirement in practical application because of the high charge recombination rate. Therefore, various modification methods have been explored to improve the separation of photogenerated carriers. Heterogeneous engineering is one of the most widely-used measures to improve separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [1–6]. Doping [7] and constructing solid solution [8,9] are also the common methods to adjust the intrinsic energy band structure. Besides the strategies above, morphology control and facet engineering also play crucial roles in enhancing the photocatalytic H2 performance. Facet engineering reveals a internal relationship between the morphology and preferredgrowth crystal facet [10–14]. For example, CdS nanowires and nanorods, usually growing predominantly in (0 0 2) facet [10,15–18], demonstrate higher H2 evolution activity [16,19], which may be because the (0 0 2) facet holding the highest surface energy in wurtzite CdS [20]. The nanosheets and nanoflowers are also the preferred morphologies when the samples grow along [0 0 2] direction [21]. Meanwhile, sheet-like CdS has been confirmed as a promising photocatalyst by theoretical calculations and practical application [22,23]. An additional advantage of flower-like hierarchical structure is that it’s easy to form heterojunction structures in solvothermal process [24–27], especially for Z-scheme systems [22]. The photocatalyst with unitary growth crystal facet is likely to construct a tighter surface contact in heterojunction structure when lattice matching well with other materials [28,29]. However, throughout the existing reports, little attention has been paid to the H2 evolution research of CdS nanoflowers or nanosheets with highly preferred (0 0 2) facet. They deserve to be further explored as the novel photocatalysts to replace the commercial CdS. The morphology and crystal orientation control of CdS have been conducted via diverse synthetic routes, including chemical vapor deposition [30], solid-state method [31], pulsed laser ablation [32], sputter-deposition [33] and solvothermal method [20]. Among them, solvothermal is one of the ideal industrial methods for its low cost, nontoxicity and maneuverability. Unfortunately, the morphology and crystal orientation are still hard to be well-controlled owing to the limitation of single solvent. Therefore, the mixed-solvothermal method has been developed and received increasing attention in recent years [34–36]. The morphology and crystal orientation would be controlled more precisely by interactions of various solvents [37]. Based on the above discussion, we had successfully synthesized flower-like CdS, which was designed to be highly (0 0 2) facet preferred oriented by mixed-solvothermal method. For comparison, the (0 0 2) facet oriented CdS samples with different preferred degrees, showed up as porous flower-like, belt-like and net-like morphologies, were synthesized, which were controlled by different combinations of solvents. The higher photocatalytic performance of flower-like CdS verified the significance of (0 0 2) facet of CdS. In addition, the growth mechanisms of CdS samples with various morphologies were systematically studied as well."
1,Experimental section,
2,Material,"2.1 Material All chemical agents in analytic grade purity were purchased from Aladdin, and they were used without further purification."
3,Synthesis of CdS,"2.2 Synthesis of CdS The various morphologies of CdS samples were synthesized using a mixed-solvothermal strategy in nitrogen-containing organic solvent. In this process, 2 mmol of cadmium acetate dehydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2 2H2O) and 10 mmol of thiourea (NH2CSNH2) were dissolved in 60 mL mixed solvents of diethylenetriamine (DETA) and ethyl alcohol (EtOH) (VDETA:VEtOH = 2:1). After stirring for 1 h, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 80 °C for 48 h in an oven, followed by a natural cooling process. Subsequently, the pale yellow precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washing several times with ethanol and deionized water. After pre-freezing in refrigerator, the samples were dried in vacuum-freeze-drying (−50 °C) for a few hours. For comparison, porous flower-like, belt-like and net-like CdS samples were synthesized with addition of different amounts of H2O into the solution (the volume ratios were VDETA:VEtOH:VH2O = 2:1:0.2, VDETA:VEtOH:VH2O = 2:1:0.5, VDETA:VH2O = 2:1, respectively). Moreover, additional experiments with different mixed-solvothermal times and solvent ratios were conducted to further investigate the growth mechanisms of CdS samples in Supplementary material."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations Morphology analysis was detected with a NOVO NanoSEM 230 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high solution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were examined on a Richard D/Max 2500 X-ray diffraction with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) with a scan rate of 10°/min, 2θ ranging from 10° to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on Thermo ESCALAB 250G XPS Spectrometer. Raman spectra of powder samples were carried out on LabRAM HR Raman microscope with a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared products were carried out using an UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2500) from 300 to 700 nm at room temperature and BaSO4 was used as a reference. Specific surface (BET) areas were measured through a nitrogen adsorption instrument (Quadrasorb SI-3MP) at 77 K after degassed at 180 °C."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution The photocatalytic H2 evolution test was detected in a top-irradiation type Pyrex cylindrical reactor with a closed glass gas system. The measurement was carried out with the equipment of Labsolar-III AG system supplied by Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd. A 300 W Xe-lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was carried out to act as the visible-light source. In the typical process, 20 mg catalyst was dispersed by stirring and ultrasonic in 80 mL deionized water containing 0.2 M Na2S and 0.2 M Na2SO3 as the sacrificial electron donor. Before reaction, the whole closed system was degassed completely to remove the air in system and solvent. The water-cooling system was used to keep the temperature maintain at 6 °C during the whole reaction process. The generated H2 gas was analyzed once per hour via a gas chromatograph, N2 (99.9%) was used as the carrier gas."
6,Photoelectrochemistry measurement,"2.5 Photoelectrochemistry measurement The transient state photocurrent was detected on a CHI 660e electrochemical workstation. A standard three-electrode system was carried out in this photochemical measurement, in which a platinum plate worked as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. 0.1 M sodium sulfate was employed as electrolyte solution. For the fabrication of working electrode, 5 mg catalyst was suspended in 500 μL ethylene glycol with 20 μL Nafion (5 wt%) aqueous solution to form a slurry, which was then dropped onto the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (1 cm × 1 cm). After evaporation of the ethylene glycol naturally, the electrode was annealed at 80 °C for 2 h in air to make catalyst tightly attach on the ITO surface. The transient state photocurrent was tested with a bias voltage of 0.193 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under the visible light irradiation produced by a 300 W Xe-lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,FE-SEM and TEM characterization,"3.1 FE-SEM and TEM characterization As shown in Fig. 1 a and e, the CdS samples exhibit flower-like structure in a mixed solution with a volume ratio of DETA to EtOH of 2:1. Each flower structure is constructed of several assembled nanosheets. In Fig. 1b and f, the macroporous regions occur on the CdS sheets when H2O is introduced to the mixed solution, leading to the formation of porous flower-like CdS (VDETA:VEtOH:VH2O = 2:1:0.2). With more H2O added to the solution, the macroporous regions expand and connect together, which changes the morphology of CdS into belt-like crystal (VDETA:VEtOH:VH2O = 2:1:0.5, Fig. 1c and g). Finally, the belt-like structure is cut into net-like when EtOH is completely replaced by H2O (VDETA:VH2O = 2:1, Fig. 1d and h). At this point, the great effect of the different solvent combinations on morphology has been proved. In order to further investigate the effect of each solvent, the SEM images of morphologicalchanges with different solvent volume ratios are displayed in Figs. S1 and S2. The morphologies of CdS in TEM images are consistent with the results shown in SEM images. The (0 0 2) facet preference of flower-like and net-like CdS can be demonstrated by HRTEM images. Fig. 2 c shows that the only visible crystal plane spaces in flower-like CdS are measured to be 0.336 nm, corresponding to the (0 0 2) facet in wurtzite CdS. Meanwhile, a lattice spacing of 0.358 nm for (1 0 0) facet can be found at the edge of net-like CdS (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the previous report [19]. It’s worth noting that in some areas, the crystal lattice fringes can’t be observed (dash parts in figure). This phenomenon could be blame on the low solvothermal temperature, which does not provide enough energy to form high crystallinity. Most of the low crystallinity regions are the initial state of (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) facet. Actually, such regions are acted as the bridges in the formation of sheet structure which would be mentioned in the growth mechanism part below."
9,XRD analysis,"3.2 XRD analysis The crystalline structure and phase composition of the prepared CdS samples were analyzed by XRD. As displayed in Fig. 3 , all the diffraction peaks can be corresponded to the hexagonal wurtzite CdS phase (JCPDS No. 77-2306). Meanwhile, as the dotted red lines indicated, there is no obvious peak indexing to the (2 0 0) peak of zinc blende CdS phase (JCPDS No. 89-0440), which proves the purity of all the synthesized CdS samples. Additionally, Raman spectrum shown in Fig. S4 is also corresponded to the wurtzite CdS previously reported. It is clearly demonstrated in XRD patterns that CdS samples hold obvious growth orientation of [0 0 2] direction. Apart from (0 0 2) facet, the peak intensity of crystallographic facets with different morphologies gradually decreases (flower-like < porous flower-like < belt-like < net-like CdS). It indicates that different combinations of solvents possess different ability to restrain the growth of crystal facets except (0 0 2) facet. In other words, the (0 0 2) facet oriented CdS samples with different preferred degrees are decided by different combinations of solvents (different amounts of introduced H2O), showing up as corresponding morphologies. The degrees of (0 0 2) facet orientation (represented as S(0 0 2)/S) for different samples are listed in Table 1 (given in bold), which are further proved by formula calculation, just as follow: (1) S α → β = ∫ β α Id θ = F HKL 2 · e 2 4 π ε 0 mRC 2 2 · 3 4 ( α - β ) + 1 16 sin 4 α - sin 4 β · I 0 (2) | F HKL | 2 = ∑ j = 1 n f j cos 2 π HX j + KY j + LZ j 2 + ∑ j = 1 n f j sin 2 π HX j + KY j + LX j 2 (3) S α → β / S = F HKL 2 · 3 4 ( α - β ) + 1 16 ( sin 4 α - sin 4 β ) ∑ i = 1 x F H i K i L i 2 · 3 4 ( α i - β i ) + 1 16 ( sin 4 α i - sin 4 β i ) The Eq. (1) is the formula of single peak area in XRD pattern, and the specific process of proof is displayed in Supplementary material (Eqs. S1–S5). As known, the XRD peak area is a significant statistic to quantify the amount of specific crystal facet. Eq. (2) is the formula of structure factor (FHKL) in Eq. (1). Eq. (3) is the result of S(HKL)/S (S(HKL) for peak area of (HKL) facet, S for the total area of all peaks in XRD pattern). According to the calculation above, it can be indicated that the variable “n” in Eq. (2) is the determinant of S(HKL)/S value for CdS samples under the same detecting condition (n for the amount of certain crystal facet; α and β are constants). Hence, the value of S(0 0 2)/S can be represented as the oriented degree of (0 0 2) facet in theory. After fitting by JADE 6.0, the relative peak areas of each crystal facet in wurtzite CdS crystal are listed in Table 1. The values of S(0 0 2)/S for flower-like, porous flower-like, belt-like and net-like CdS are calculated to be 67.2%, 46.2%, 40.5% and 25.6%, respectively, which decrease with the additional volume of H2O in mixed-solvothermal process. However, the refinement factor R in Table 1 is just above the normal range due to the low crystallinity. Nevertheless, it is reasonable that the whole trend of the peak area displayed in Fig. 3 matches well with the result of fitting. We can qualitatively draw the conclusion that the oriented degrees of (0 0 2) facet in CdS are declined from flower-like to net-like morphology."
10,XPS,"3.3 XPS The chemical species and their relative concentration on the surface of CdS are analyzed by XPS. Fig. 4 displays the full spectrum and high-resolution spectra of the Cd 3d and S 2p regions, respectively. The survey spectra of CdS with different morphologies are shown in Fig. 4a. Except for the Cd, S, O, and C, there are no other elements to be found. The carbon peak is attributed to the adventitious hydrocarbon from the XPS instrument itself [38]. The Fig. 4b and c present the comparison between flower-like and net-like CdS in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d and S 2p species. The two strong overlapping peaks at 404.48 and 411.19 eV in Fig. 4b belong to Cd5/2 and Cd3/2 of Cd2+ , which indicates that the Cd elements of each samples are in the same chemical state despite the different morphologies [39]. The S 2p spectra of different CdS are revealed in Fig. 4c. The binding energies can be derived into two peaks (161.11 and 162.35 eV) which are assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 [40], by means of XPS-peak-differentation-imation analysis."
11,Photocatalytic activity,"3.4 Photocatalytic activity Photocatalytic H2-production activities were investigated under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) without any co-catalyst. Fig. 5 depicts H2 production rate over different morphologies CdS samples. The flower-like CdS synthesized in the mixture of DETA and EtOH displays the highest H2 production rate (5.98 mmol h−1 g−1), which is nearly 6 times than that of net-like CdS synthesized in DETA and H2O. The performances of porous flower-like and belt-like CdS are located in an intermediate range between the former two samples. Thus we can come to the conclusion that the increasing addition of H2O in mixed-solvent results in the decrease of the H2 evolution photocatalytic activity. This conclusion is correlating to the oriented degrees of (0 0 2) facet with different morphologies showed in Table 1, which may prove that the (0 0 2) facet of CdS acts as a critical role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the stability test (Fig. 6 ) shows that there is no obvious loss of the photocatalytic performance after 5 cycles and 30 h of test. The BET surface area had also been investigated to make sure whether the specific surface area is the major factor to the enhancement of H2 evolution performance. As shown in Table S1, the specific surface areas in different morphologies of CdS are inversely proportional to H2 evolution rate in Fig. 5. The contrary trend can be explained as a process that 2D sheet structure is cut into 1D wires structure, which would be further discussed in growth mechanism below. In a word, the surface area is not the key factor to the improvement of H2 evolution in this work."
12,Electrical and optical properties,"3.5 Electrical and optical properties Fig. 7 exhibits the photocurrent response of different samples under visible light irradiation, which was regularly switched on and off every twenty seconds. The photocurrent density is found to be proportional to H2 production rate of CdS with various morphologies. It manifests that more photo-generated electrons are transferred to the surface as a result of higher oriented degree of (0 0 2) facet. Fig. 8 shows the UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples with different morphologies. The evident and narrow absorption edges show the good visible light absorption properties of the CdS samples. The band gaps of the samples (located in the range of 2.52–2.55 eV) are all shifted toward high energy compared with bulk CdS [36] (2.42 eV), which is ascribable to the quantum confinement effect of 2D and 1D CdS nanostructure. Moreover, it can be found that CdS with higher preferred (0 0 2) facet exhibits wider range of absorption spectrum, which is corresponded to H2 production performance in Fig. 5. In other words, the (0 0 2) facet of CdS is probably beneficial to extend light absorption response in visible region."
13,Possible growth and formation mechanism,"3.6 Possible growth and formation mechanism There is no doubt that DETA solvent plays a vital role in the synthesis process. The common understanding for the formation of highly preferred (0 0 2) facet CdS in solvothermal synthesis is that the N atoms in organic solvent (just like DETA) can be bonded to the exposed Cd atoms in the (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) surfaces [19], leading to the growth inhibition of (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) facets. Subsequently, the CdS samples tend to grow along [0 0 2] direction. As for temperature, a relatively high mix-solvothermal temperature is better to get high crystallization. However, it contradicts with the fact that the (0 0 2) facet in wurzite CdS contains the highest surface energy [41]. The thermodynamic control in high temperature [42] would promote the growth of (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) facets by the principle of minimum energy. In a word, the 80 °C is beneficial for the growth of (0 0 2) facet in wurzite CdS because the inhibition of (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) facets is kinetic-driven control [42]. However, Fig. S1a shows that single DETA solvent is so viscous that the CdS samples tend to grow into bulk-like structures, which exhibit poor performance on H2 evolution (Fig. S5). It’s necessary to introduce the assist-solvent with good fluidity like H2O or EtOH into the solvothermal system. As is known to all, the DETA solution is comparably alkaline due to the attraction on H+ by N atoms showed in chemical Eq. (4) below. It can be further concluded that if the H2O exists in (4) the mixed-solvothermal system, the NCd attraction would be weakened due to the balance of NCd and NH+. Similar to the mechanism previously reported [19], we can speculate that the CdS crystal would preferentially grow along [0 0 2] direction and end at (1 0 0) or (1 0 1) surface so that the morphology tends to be wire-like (Fig. 9 ). When replacing H2O with EtOH gradually, the ability of NCd bond in restricting the growth of (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) facets strengthens with the decrease of NH+ bond. Then (0 0 2) facets continue growing, or to grow on the original boundaries, whose crystallinity is too poor to end as the border. In consequence, the width of wire-like CdS increases with the higher oriented degree of (0 0 2) facet. The belt-like and porous flower-like morphologies can be regarded as the midstate between flower-like and net-like, which accord with the continuous process that 1D wires expend to 2D sheets. Fig. 9 is the schematic diagram for growth mechanisms of CdS with different morphologies, which illustrates the transformation of the morphology from sheet to wire. In a word, it’s a process that 1D wire structure extends to 2D sheet structure by sustained growth. So the highly (0 0 2) preferred oriented CdS tends to be nanosheets. Finally, the CdS nanosheets aggregate together and self-assemble into hierarchical flower-like structure driven by the minimization of surface energy. Additionally, the formation mechanism of flower-like CdS mentioned above can also be confirmed by the morphology changes in different solvothermal times (Fig. S3d–f). The sheet structure has grown with the time increasing from 3 h to 48 h due to the continuous growth mentioned above. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S3a–c, the net-like CdS continues growing along [0 0 2] direction so that the length of the wires increases. From the above, we can conclude that the formation mechanisms of flower-like, porous flower-like, belt-like and net-like CdS are similar, while the degrees of (0 0 2) facet orientation is the major difference among them. It demonstrates that the (0 0 2) facet in CdS may be the key factor to the enhancement of H2 evolution."
14,Conclusion,"In summary, we have successfully synthesized CdS samples with different oriented degrees of (0 0 2) facet using a low-temperature mixed-solvothermal strategy. The oriented degrees of (0 0 2) facet are controlled by different combinations of solvents, showing up as flower-like, porous flower-like, belt-like and net-like morphologies. The change of morphologies is a process that 2D sheet is cut into 1D wires gradually. According to the previously reported [19], the DETA is used to inhibit the growth of the facets in CdS except (0 0 2) facet. The low temperature and EtOH are the key growing environmental factors to obtain the high (0 0 2) preferred orientation CdS. The former promotes the growth of (0 0 2) facet by kinetic-driven control, while the latter increases the liquidity of the solvent. Additionally, H2O is used to control the morphology and preferred degrees of (0 0 2) facet. In other words, the different preferred degrees of (0 0 2) facet have been controlled precisely by interactions of DETA, EtOH and H2O in the mixed-solvothermal system. Compared to other morphologies of CdS, the flower-like CdS, which contains the highest preferred degrees of (0 0 2) facet, displays excellent performance in H2 evolution, reaching a maximum at 5.98 mmol h−1 g−1. As expect, the H2 evolution performance is proportional to the oriented degrees of (0 0 2) facet. Compared to the previous reports [19,43], the inference that (0 0 2) facet of CdS acts as a critical role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity is proved more rigorously. Moreover, the flower-like structure is easier to construct a tighter surface contact in heterojunction engineering when lattice matching well with other materials [28,29]. As one of the most widely used photocatalysts in water splitting [44], CdS nanoparticles were often regarded as the significant component in the heterojunction structure [45–47]. And now, the higher-performance flower-like CdS may be the new favourite in heterojunction engineering in the future."
