0,Introduction,"Photocatalytic hydrogen production via photocatalysis has great potential for solving environmental and energy issues and has been the focus of increasing research in the last decade. In particular, heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions on TiO2 semiconductors have been attracting much attention because of their potential applications in hydrogen production by water splitting (WS) and environmental clean-up by the so-called advanced oxidative processes (AOP) [1,2]. The WS reaction was discovered in 1972 [3], and after more than 40 years, no real breakthroughs have been observed in the field. The WS reaction, referred to as one of the “holy grail” [4] of chemistry, remains elusive in spite of the exponential growth of scientific articles that have been published in the last decade. In spite of promising results that have been reported, a commercially viable catalyst system for this transformation is still absent, even for the high surface area TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). This difficulty is mainly due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated conduction-band electrons and valence band holes summed to the efficient surface recombination back-reaction of oxygen and hydrogen to produce water [5]. Photogeneration of hydrogen from water is usually investigated, contrary to AOPs, in unaerated conditions with simultaneous hydrogen production rate enhanced by the use of the so called sacrificial agents [5]. These agents increase the life time of the photoelectrons, decreasing the rate of electron–hole recombination and increasing consequently the hydrogen generation yield. In this sense, if the sacrificial agent is a pollutant present in the wastewater there is a possibility of the organic pollutant degradation together with hydrogen generation. In the last decade there have been used a large variety of electron donors for photocatalytic hydrogen production, such as alcohols [6–9], polyalcohols [10,11], sugars [12], n-heptane cracking [13] and chloroacetic acids [14]. Within all the above series of sacrificial agents, alcohols were found to be very efficient as hole scavengers increasing the hydrogen production rate one or two orders of magnitude compared to the WS reaction carried out in pure water. For this reason a number of research groups have recently moved their attention to the study of hydrogen production over TiO2 nanoparticles together with pollutant degradation [8,10,14,15]. The results were promising, especially because the overall process can be described as a photo-induced reform of alcohols at room temperature representing an environmentally friendly and low cost method for wastewater treatment with simultaneous production of clean and renewable energy source, i.e., hydrogen. Photocatalytic activity can be increased, for example, by the presence of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) [7,10,16–18] or Gold NPs [19–22] as co-catalyst deposited on TiO2 surface. Several works have reported new Pt-loaded photocatalysts with improve efficiency towards water splitting using TiO2 NTs structures [23,24]. The photocatalytic reaction over Pt/TiO2 systems has been already studied from the point of view of pollutant degradation [8] and also for the production of hydrogen [7,8,10,25–28]. After the absorption of the photon and charge separation, the photocatalytic reaction requires that the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 migrate to the Pt NPs through the Pt/TiO2 interfaces. The electrons finally are trapped by the Pt particles and available to participate in reduction reactions. The holes generated in the valence band remain for oxidation reactions [7]. The low-charge separation and transfer efficiency constitutes the bottle neck of the process where an intense electron–hole recombination takes place. If a sacrificial agent is present in the water and the electron transfer at the Pt/TiO2 interface is efficient, high production rates should be expected. The photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous methanol solutions over Pt-loaded laboratory prepared TiO2, non nonstoichiometric titania oxide and commercial TiO2 photocatalysts has been recently studied [26,29]. In particular, Kandiel et al. [26] obtained interesting results using methanol as hole scavenger, indicating that this system should be described as a methanol dehydrogenation reaction when the photocatalytic reaction is stopped at the first step of photocatalytic oxidation (formaldehyde formation). Then when carbon dioxide is detected the photocatalytic reaction would be described better as methanol reforming but not as a real water splitting system. The amount of Pt can play a key role in deciding whether a particular catalyst has a positive, negative or even null photocatalytic effect. Several authors have observed that an optimal loading of Pt existed for promoting photocatalytic rates on TiO2 surfaces and Pt loading over about 1 wt% resulted in attenuation of photochemical rates as a result of blocking of the TiO2 surface [8,10,16,30,31]. Several ways of Pt deposition have been used over the years; among them photoassisted Pt deposition [16,32,33] and in particular the wet impregnation method were employed due to its simplicity [7,16,25,34]. Wet impregnation methodology, the more common approach used, has a poor control on the amount and type of Pt nanoparticles deposited on the TiO2 structures. For this reason, a number of groups starting to use sputtering deposition methods to control the amount of Pt loading with precision [30,31,35]. In spite Platinum has a high price and limited world-wide supply, recently it was shown that the sputtering method allow to use a minimum metal loading without compromise efficiency [36]. Herein we extend our previous work on hydrogen production by NTs photocatalysts [37–39] loading ultra-small Pt NPs on TiO2 NTs by DC-magnetron sputtering deposition (DC-MS) method. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation under UV irradiation using methanol, ethanol, glycerol and phenol as sacrificial species was investigated. Hydrogen apparent quantum efficiencies (Ф app), using methanol and ethanol as typical hole scavengers to enhance hydrogen production rate, were also measured. The prepared photocatalysts showed Ф app of 16% at an excitation wavelength of 313 nm for thin 1.5 μm length TiO2 NTs. The Pt NPs loaded on TiO2 NTs reported here represents also a true WS catalyst under UV irradiation and pure distilled water."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation and characterization of TiO2 photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of TiO2 photocatalysts TiO2 NTs were prepared by anodization of a Ti foil with constant applied voltage at room temperature, using an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol + 0.25 wt% NH4F + 10 wt% H2O with ultrasonic bath following a methodology already described [37–40]. After the anodization the TiO2 NTs were annealed at 400 °C for 3 h in air atmosphere in order to crystallize the oxide nanotubes layer. The crystal structure analyses of TiO2 NTs after thermal treatment was performed by Rietveld profile refinement using Fullprof software [41]. For the Rietveld refinements, a preferred orientation (Ph) using the Modified March's function was used [42,43] (eq. (1)): (1) P h = G 2 + ( 1 − G 2 ) ( ( G 1 cos α h ) 2 + sin 2 α h G 1 ) − 3 2 where G 1 correspond to the Bragg–Brentano geometry, G 2 represents the fraction of the sample without orientation and α h is the acute angle between the scattering vector and the normal to the crystallites. Pt NPs loaded on TiO2 NTs were prepared by DC-magnetron sputtering (DC-MS) deposition method. The deposition was performed in a sputter coater MED 020 (Bal-Tech). Initially the vacuum chamber was evacuated at 10−4 Pa. The Pt deposition was carried out under an argon work pressure of 2.0 Pa at room temperature, with discharge current of 40 mA for 6 s. The TiO2 NTs surface was located at a distance of 50 mm from the Pt target (99.99% in purity). The control of deposition rate was performed in situ by a quartz crystal film thickness measurement device (QSG 060 - Bal-Tech). Platinum determination was carried out following a standard procedure using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Analyst 200, PerkinElmer, Singapore) equipped with a deuterium background corrector and a hollow cathode lamp of Pt (wavelength of 265.95 nm and current of 30 mA). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses were carried out in a Cs-corrected FEI Titan 80/300 transmission electron microscope, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer at INMETRO, Brazil. High Z-contrast images were acquired through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using a high-angle annular dark-field detector. The mean size of Pt NPs was obtained averaging the measurements of 300 NPs. For each Pt NPs the two longest diameters were measured, therefore 600 measurements were averaged to obtain the final mean diameter informed. The EDX analyses were performed in STEM mode, allowing nanometer scale spatial resolution. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) patterns were recorded at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron (LNLS, XRD-2 beam line, λ = 1.50 Å, Campinas, Brazil). The sample was tilted in an angle ω fixed in 2° and the GAXRD measurements was realized in a 2θ range from 10 to 80° with a 0.02° step size and measuring time of 20 s per step. High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Pt 4f spectra were obtained with 10 eV of pass energy at the TGM (Toroidal Grating Monochromator) beam line of the LNLS, Campinas, Brazil. XPS spectra were obtained using a high performance hemispheric SPECSLAB II (Phoibos-Hs 3500,150 analyzer, SPECS) energy analyzer. Alternatively, XPS spectra were also obtained using a conventional electron spectrometer (Omicron N. T.Gmbh, Germany) and a non-monochromatic Al Kα radiation as excitation source. Pass energies of 50 eV and 10 eV were used for the survey, and single element spectra, respectively. The position of the C 1s signal corresponding to C–C/C–H was always used for energy calibration, by setting the energy value at 285.0 eV. The envelopes were analyzed and peak-fitted after subtraction of the Shirley background using Gaussian–Lorenzian peak shapes obtained from the CasaXPS software package."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen measurements,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen measurements Hydrogen photogeneration experiments were carried out in a calibrated (22.16 ± 0.01) mL gas-closed photochemical reactor made of PTFE under continuous magnetic stirring (see Figure S1, in supporting information). A quartz window of 2.54 cm in diameter allowed irradiation of the aqueous mixture under a wide incident spectral range, including UV and visible light. The photocatalysis was carried out with unfiltered or filtered light from a high pressure Xe/Hg lamp 150 W (Sciencetech Inc.). Wavelengths were selected using line filters of ±10 nm FWHM (Newport). A precision Iris was set in the output of the line filter box to allow only irradiation on the NTs surface. Prior to irradiation, the reactor was deaerated with nitrogen or argon. The photocatalytic activity of the titania NTs were evaluated by gas chromatography (Agilent 6820 GC chromatograph) using a molecular sieve 5Å packed column following the procedure previously reported [39]. As the mixture of methanol and water has a partial molar volume which depends on the concentration of methanol and water, the actual volume of the mixture was determined by measuring the density of the final mixture and the remaining gas volume was corrected accordingly. This correction was only carried out for water/methanol mixtures where Ф app was measured. Actinometry measurements were performed initially, and at the end of a photochemical run. When it was necessary, the intensity of the light was controlled at intermediate times during the photocatalysis. An average value of the light intensities was used for quantum yield calculations. The relative intensities at the wavelength selected 254, 313 and 365 nm were approximately 1, 3 and 9 respectively. The quantum yield of the actinometer, potassium ferrioxalate, was assumed to be 1.25 at all wavelengths studied [44]. It was considered also that 100% of the photons reaching the surface of the NTs were absorbed. Due to the TiO2 NTs array studied here have 1.5 μm thicknesses, the 100% absorption approximation is valid [27]. Since production of hydrogen is a two electron process, (2) 2 H + + 2 e − → H 2 Ф app is defined as twice the number of hydrogen molecules produced divided by the number of absorbed incident photons. The photocatalytic data presented here for Pt loaded on TiO2 NTs corresponded to 6 s of deposition time, which produced a hydrogen rate close to the maximum obtained under the present experimental conditions. Because the maximum photoactivity for Pt loaded TiO2 (usually in the form of P-25) is obtained with about 1% w/w% of Pt, the measurements of Ф app were carried out using NTs loaded with 0.7% w/w% of Pt (6 s of sputtering)."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization The TiO2 NTs substrates after annealed at 400 °C for 3 h in air atmosphere showed a typical crystalline anatase phase. Fig. 1 shows the GAXRD patterns of the as-anodized TiO2 NTs and annealed TiO2 NTs, respectively. The results show that as-anodized sample present an amorphous TiO2 structure (Fig. 1a) and after the annealing process only tetragonal anatase structure was formed (Fig. 1b). The Rietveld refinement indicated that the average size of the anatase crystallites structure presented 31.64 nm and lattice parameters of a = 3.789, b = 3.789 and c = 9.490 Å. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) microscopy images of the TiO2 NTs with 1.5 μm length, 70 nm diameter and ∼10 nm wall thickness can be seen in Fig. 2 a–b. After annealing, TiO2 NTs samples were loaded with ultra-small Pt NPs by DC-MS for 2, 6 and 12 s. The Pt quantities deposited on the NTs were proportional to the deposition time. For example, the Pt amounts determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy were 0.7 and 1.6 w/w% for 6 s and 12 s of deposition time respectively. Fig. 2c shows representative STEM with high-Z contrast of the TiO2 NTs decorated with Pt by sputtering for 12 s. HRTEM micrographs of the same sample can be seen in Fig. 2d. The inverse Fourier transform picture (Fig. 2e) obtained by treating the HRTEM image of a single Pt particle, shows the distance of 2.26 Å typical from the Pt (111) planes. EDX spectrum, Fig. 2f, confirms the presence of Pt in the sample as well as Ti and O from TiO2 and Cu from the copper grid used on TEM analysis. Pt NPs sizes slightly increased from 1.1 ± 0.3 to 1.3 ± 0.3 nm when the sputtering time changed from 2 to 12 s (see Fig. 3 ). Finally, XPS spectroscopy was used to prove the surface chemistry changes before and after Pt deposition. Following anodization, XPS survey spectra showed the presence of C, O, Ti, N and a small amount of F with an O/Ti ratio of 2.5–2.8 due to the presence of the electrolyte compounds on the surface. After the annealing process, F and N signal disappeared; leaving only carbon adventitious and an O/Ti ratio of about 2 (see Fig. S2 in supporting information). When Pt was deposited for 6 s a typical XPS spectrum of the Pt 4f region was measured (Fig. 4 -top). Pt 4f electron spectrum is well-resolved with two main doublets with Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 binding energies between 71.2 and 74.5 eV. Both components of equal half-widths have an intensity ratio of ca. 4:3 and a separation of about 3.3 eV, very close to that it would be expected theoretically. These mains doublet signals (relative area ∼86%) are undoubtedly due to Pt(0). Additional contributions at 72.7 and 75.8 eV are necessary to fit the experimental Pt 4f peak correctly that are assigned to PtO 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 respectively [34,45]. After photocatalysis the Pt 4f signal shows that about 28% of the Pt NPs deposited on TiO2 NTs are oxidized and new signals at 74.1 and 77.2 eV appear in the XPS spectra that are assigned to PtO2 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 respectively (see Fig. 4-bottom). The higher binding energy component due to Pt(IV) species can be assigned to PtO2 or Pt(OH)4 [45]."
6,Alcohols photo-reforming and hydrogen production,"3.2 Alcohols photo-reforming and hydrogen production 3.2.1 Methanol and ethanol Methanol and ethanol are efficient hole scavengers and they are potential hydrogen “reservoirs” at ∼12.5 and 13.0 wt% respectively. In spite they are frequently used as electron donor in so-called “sacrificial systems” for the photocatalytic H2 production; only a few mechanistic study of this system have been published [46]. There is a very recent report concerning the quantum efficiency on the rate of the photocatalytic H2 evolution over Pt-loaded TiO2 NPs from aqueous methanol solution [26]. With respect to similar studies on pure TiO2 NTs the information is lacking. Table 1 shows the enhancement of the H2 production rate with the increase in methanol concentration. As the methanol concentration increased there was a proportional increase in hydrogen evolution rate. The hydrogen produced under UV irradiation on TiO2 NTs was previously observed to evolve steadily and without decrease in the rate over long periods of time [39]. Typical results obtained in the presence of ethanol-water solutions on TiO2 NTs are shown in Fig. 5 where the hydrogen production rate is plotted as functions of the irradiation time. The amount of evolved H2 (μmol cm−2 h−1) calculated from da data presented in Fig. 5 can be seen in Table 1. The hydrogen rate also increased when the ethanol concentration increased. It can be observed in Table 1 that in the presence of ethanol the rate of hydrogen evolution is slightly lower than methanol, at similar concentrations. This small decrease in the hydrogen generation rate was already found when TiO2 nanoparticles (P-25) were used (results not shown). This effect in the alcohol molecular size can be correlated with the electron transfer rate from trapped holes in TiO2 that depend on the alcohol type. Tamaki et al. observed electron transfer times of ∼100 ps for methanol, ∼1 ns for ethanol and ∼3 ns for isopropanol [47]. 3.2.2 Glycerol and phenol Glycerol and Phenol have particular interests in reform them to hydrogen at room temperature using photocatalysis. In Brazil the diesel by Federal law contain 3% of biodiesel and in 2013 it has to contain 5% [48]. Brazil will produce 250,000 tons of glycerol per year. The annual consume of glycerol in Brazil is 30,000 tons and the large surplus will produce a pressure on the search for new commercial uses of glycerol. Similar tendency can be expected in others countries and reforming of glycerol by photocatalysis begun to be studied recently by using TiO2 NPs [10,49]. Phenol and its derivates have been studied during decades using mainly commercially available TiO2 NPs although recently new catalyst have been introduced [50–53]. In spite there is a wide range of research on phenol photodegradation processes, a hydrogen generation study on the diverse catalyst used during photodegradation is lacking. Therefore, it is of interest to know if there is any hydrogen production when phenol, a prototype well studied contaminant, is decomposed by photocatalysis. Typical results on hydrogen photocatalytic generation in the presence of glycerol or phenol using TiO2 NTs are shown in Fig. 6 . The top of Fig. 6 shows that in the presence of glycerol the hydrogen rate formation is about 0.2 μmol h−1 cm−2. This rate of hydrogen generation is lower than ethanol at a similar concentration and this should be expected when a larger alcohol molecule is used as sacrificial compound. Prolonged exposure to illumination results in the formation of CO and CO2 as minor products of the photocatalytic reaction (the complete study on Glycerol photodegradation is going to be published elsewhere). The presence of CO2 as final product of the mineralization reaction of Glycerol was already measured on TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 nanoparticles [10]. Fig. 6-bottom shows that a solution of 50 mg/L of phenol in water produce hydrogen at a rate of about 0.06 μmol h−1 cm−2, that is about 12 times higher than pure water. The data presented in Fig. 6-bottom is pointing out a fact that in a standard photodegradation process of phenol, and may be in the phenol family of compounds, hydrogen generation proceeds together with the photodegradation process in anaerobic conditions."
7,Effect of Pt loading on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NTs,"3.3 Effect of Pt loading on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 NTs Results obtained from pure water and methanol/water solutions (1/8 v/v) on Pt-loaded TiO2 and pure TiO2 NTs are shown in Fig. 7 . It is possible to observe that the rate of hydrogen production strongly increased when Pt was deposited on the TiO2 NTs and that increase is even higher when methanol is present in the water. Taken into account the relative hydrogen evolution rates (Fig. 7) for pure TiO2 NTs in methanol/water solution (close circles), Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs in pure distilled water (open squares) and Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs in methanol/water solution (close triangles); the relative rates are 1, 10 and 36 respectively. The rate of hydrogen generation in pure water using Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs is much higher than TiO2 NTs without Pt (compare data on Table 1 with Fig. 7). Nonetheless, Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs in pure water have a ten times higher rate than pure TiO2 NTs in contact with a methanol/water solution. The ultra-small Pt NPs loaded on TiO2 NTs under UV radiation constitutes a real water splitting system producing hydrogen and oxygen gases under illumination (see inset of Fig. 7). The obtained results show that Pt NPs deposited on the TiO2 NTs arrays resulted in a highly efficient system to produce hydrogen even in pure water. Recently, enhanced water photocatalysis with Pt metal nanoparticles on single crystal TiO2 surfaces were obtained using a similar sputtering method [54]. Homogenous distributions of Pt NPs deposited onto columnar TiO2 films from 1.15 to 3.46 nm were observed by HRTEM. This very recent report and the work presented here are pointing out the importance of size and surface distribution of small Pt NPs on hydrogen photogeneration reactions."
8,Apparent quantum yield determination,"3.4 Apparent quantum yield determination The intense research work developed in less than a decade on the water splitting reaction and the need to publish quickly new experimental results in this expanding field resulted in a serious problem: hydrogen production rates obtained with different catalyst, different excitation sources with a wide range of intensities and wavelengths, different active surface area (in general not known), several reactor geometries, etc. lead to quantitative comparisons between catalysts almost impossible. In the photochemical field a basic experimental determination to obtained information about mechanisms and kinetic processes is quantum yield measurements of products [55,56]. The knowledge of this parameter is fundamental. It enables one (i) to compare the activity of different catalysts for the same reaction, (ii) to estimate the relative feasibility of different reactions, and (iii) to calculate the energetic yield of the process and the corresponding cost. In heterogeneous photocatalysis, mainly due to scattering of the radiation, the apparent quantum yield (lower than the actual quantum yield) is a very useful quantitative measurement that it was almost forgotten in the last 15 years. Serpone, N. in a special communication to the editor in 1997 [57], invited to the readers to determine quantum yields in heterogeneous photocatalysts with the same or other equivalent approach to debate and understand the photocatalytic reactions on the same quantitative bases. However, the actual scientific communication of the experimental results and new discoveries in the field lack of Serpone thinking, and in consequence, it is very difficult to compare the enormous number of new catalytic systems that are synthesized every year. The apparent quantum yield of hydrogen evolution on TiO2 NTs and Pt/TiO2 NTs was measured in a solution of methanol/water (1/8 v/v). Particular care was taken to keep all the experimental optical parameters constant for the series of measurements. Ф app have been determined at 254, 313 and 365 nm and the results are shown in Table 2 . Examination of Ф app of Table 2 shows that irradiation of pure TiO2 NTs present a low Ф app ranging from about 0.02% to 0.1% depending on the excitation wavelength. In this regard photocatalytic water splitting, even with sacrificial species, is a challenging process due to the low efficiency of the many systems that have been reported [2,58]. The results on pure TiO2 NTs also showed an interesting property of the photochemical reaction on the NTs arrays: an apparent dependence with the excitation wavelength. When the wavelength decreased, Ф app seemed to increase slightly. When Pt was loaded on TiO2 NTs arrays, Ф app increased from 50 up to 800 times compared to pure TiO2 NTs depending on the excitation wavelength (see Table 2). The high apparent quantum yields obtained are probably due to a synergy between the small size and homogenous surface distribution of the Pt NPs (see Figs. 2c and 3) produced by sputtering and the nanotubular geometry of the TiO2 semiconductor. When ethanol was used as sacrificial specie a high Ф app was also observed. In spite, the Ф app of hydrogen production without Pt NPs in ethanol solutions were not measured, a very low yield similar to methanol would be expected (see data on Table 1). The difference found in the hydrogen efficiencies between methanol and ethanol is due to the known lower efficiency of ethanol as hole scavenger compared to a smaller alcohol molecule such as methanol [47]. In a very recent work [54], photocatalytic applications of 1D monocrystalline TiO2 nanostructures impregnated with Pt by sputtering were reported. The authors ascribe the high activity of the photocatalysts to the small size of the Pt NPs and the geometry of the obtained TiO2 films. Hydrogen production rates were much higher using Pt/TiO2 NTs than using pure TiO2 NTs and a clear dependence on the excitation wavelength was observed (see third column in Table 2). Table 2 shows that the Ф app for Pt loaded TiO2 NTs increased 12% at 254 nm and 16% at 313 nm compared with NTs without Pt NPs. On the contrary Ф app measured at 365 nm was only 1% times. The optical properties of our TiO2 TNs and Au NPs/TiO2 NTs were already characterized in a previous publications by UV–vis spectroscopy [39]. In spite in the present work a detailed UV–vis investigation was not carried out for Pt NPs deposited on the TiO2 NTs, recent publications have reported UV–vis absorbance spectra of Pt NPs loaded on TiO2 nanostructures [54,59]. Taken into account the increase in the absorbance of TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 systems with the decrease in the excitation wavelength, a ratio of 1,43 and 1,37 can be calculated for the ratios Abs(313 nm)/Abs(365 nm) and Abs(254 nm)/Abs(365 nm) respectively for 1 wt% nominal rate ratio of Pt to Ti [59]. Similar result was obtained by An et al. for the ratio Abs(313 nm)/Abs(365 nm) ∼ 1.5 [54]. Based on the above information, changes in light absorption cannot explain the obtained results because the hydrogen apparent quantum yields increased 16% (313 nm) and 12% (254 nm) compared to 365 nm excitation. The high Ф app obtained at shorter wavelength can be understood taking into account that the mobility of electron–hole pairs affects the photocatalytic activity as well as the conduction band level because it affects the probability of electrons and holes reaching reaction sites on the surface. Those effects have already been observed in tantalate photocatalysts with a higher conduction band level of Ta5d than the reduction potential of water [60]. A key issue in charge separation relates to the energy of the charge carriers formed after photon absorption. “Deep” holes and “hot” electrons are more like to separate than charge carriers generated with near-band gap energy light [1]. Grela et al. [61,62] were the first to examine the photodegradation quantum yields as a function of excitation energy. In one of their works they examined the dependence of the quantum yield for 3-nitrophenol photooxidation [62] on the excess of photon energy (E PE) defined as the photon energy in excess of the TiO2 band gap energy. The photodegradation quantum yield started to increase significantly over 0.4–0.5 EPE reaching a constant value at ∼2.5% over ∼0.8 EPE. Our results using Pt loaded TiO2 NTs catalyst can be interpreted in similar fashion. At 365 nm the EPE is about 0.2 and the Ф app is 1%. On the contrary, at 313 and 254 nm the EPE are 0.76 and 1.68 reaching probably some steady state condition. At higher excitation energies the life time of electrons and holes will probably increase, reaching the surface more easily and therefore increasing the hydrogen quantum yield. Finally, Table 2 shows a difference in the Ф app between 254 and 313 nm of excitation energy. Previous studies on photocatalyzed degradation of phenol and 4-chlorophenol have shown that in both cases, the reactions displayed a well-defined spectral dependence with some fine structure in the quantum yields measured [63]. The spectral dependence was explained because the photogenerated carriers were formed in different states and they have different recombination constants (i.e., different recombination crosssections), and consequently different lifetimes, mobilities, and rate constants for the surface reactions. Our results may show similar spectral dependence, but further studies would be needed to confirm that hypothesis for the hydrogen photogeneration on Pt loaded TiO2 NTs."
9,Conclusions,"In summary, the results presented here are very promising because hydrogen can be produced at ambient conditions via an efficient, technologically simple, ecologically benign and potentially very low-cost process. Indeed, the system uses simple Pt-loaded TiO2 NTs photocatalyst and abundant and renewable sources: alcohols and water. Pt loading on TiO2 NTs was highly efficiently in hydrogen generation. The apparent quantum yield in hydrogen formation measured at 313 nm was about 16%. The clear dependence of the apparent hydrogen quantum yield on the excitation wavelength showed that this experimental parameter should be taking into account for the optimization of an efficient hydrogen production system. The obtained results showed that the approach developed in the present work has the potential to produce hydrogen via photocatalysis in enough amounts from a point of view of a potential application. Simultaneously, it was clearly shown the known intrinsic difficulty of TiO2 semiconductor that it is to produce hydrogen efficiently by solar light harvesting. Even if Pt is used as co-catalyts, the highest apparent hydrogen quantum yields were obtained at wavelengths where the of solar radiation flux in the UV region reaching the Earth surface is minimum or zero. Therefore, new catalysts materials are needed to allow harvesting of solar light. Moreover, the Pt DC-MS method reported herein represents a simple and efficient method for the metalation of semi-conductors of all types, shapes and sizes that can be easily employed in the expected future generation of visible light photocatalysts for the WS reaction."
