0,Introduction,"Hydrogen has been undergoing extensive research and development as a potential future alternative fuel which could help alleviate global energy shortages as well as alleviate environmental problems caused by combustion of fossil fuels (Hallenbeck, 2011). Hydrogen is especially attractive since fuel cells using hydrogen are much more energy efficient than combusting conventional or alternative fuels. Currently, most of the world’s hydrogen supply, 50million tons annually, is met by steam reforming of natural gas (Report of the Hydrogen Production Expert Panel, 2014). Thus, if a future hydrogen economy is to be sustainable, a renewable way of making the required hydrogen needs to be found. A variety of means are available for generating renewable electricity which can be used to produce hydrogen through electrolysis. However, most such power sources are intermittent, and hydrogen generated in this way is most suitably used for centralized stationary power. There has been a great deal of interest in reforming bioethanol to hydrogen, since in principle, very little energy need be lost (Deluga et al., 2004). Ethanol, presently produced at high yields from corn and cane sugars, and possibly in the future from lignocellulosic materials, would make an excellent energy (hydrogen) carrier, facilitating storage and refueling. However, although a great deal of research has gone into chemical means of reforming, and much progress has been made, there remain significant challenges for chemically catalyzed ethanol reformation (Chen et al., 2004; Dominguez et al., 2012; Haryanto et al., 2005; Mattos et al., 2012; Sun and Wang, 2014). These include the possible requirement for noble metal catalysts, catalyst inactivation, high temperature requirements, and the production of problematic side products, such as CO and acetaldehyde. Therefore, an alternative reformation process operating at ambient temperatures, robust and without special metal requirements, and producing hydrogen without the co-production of toxic compounds would be desirable. Biological systems fulfill many of these requirements since enzymes have exquisite specificity, and living organisms grow at moderate temperatures and are self-replicating. However, the main problem of course is that reformation of ethanol is thermodynamically unfavorable, Eq. (1): (1) C 2 H 5 OH + 3 H 2 O → 2 CO 2 + 6 H 2 ( Δ G 0 = 97 kJ / mol ) In chemical catalysis, the required energy is provided by the relatively high temperatures uses, 400–700°C, but generating the required energy biologically would be very challenging. Some organisms are known that live by converting ethanol to acetate and hydrogen, a reaction that is less energy demanding but even so impossible under standard conditions, Eq. (2): (2) C 2 H 5 OH + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + 2 H 2 ( Δ G 0 = 9.5 kJ / mol ) The organisms that live by carrying out this reaction can only do so in the presence of a hydrogen consuming organism which effectively changes the free energy of the reaction to make it favorable. This metabolic relationship between the two organisms is called syntrophy, widely found in anaerobic environments in nature (Hallenbeck, 2012; McInerney et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2013; Sieber et al., 2012). A few organisms are capable of the co-fermentation of ethanol and acetate to hydrogen, driven by the co-production of butyric acid (Hallenbeck, 2012). However, until now, no organism has been shown to be capable of the sustained production of hydrogen from ethanol alone. Photosynthetic bacteria are well known for their relatively broad substrate utilization in the light, being particularly adept at growing on organic acids (van Niel, 1944). In order to maintain redox balance when using substrates more reduced than cellular biomass, these organisms carry out CO2 fixation, or, in the absence of easily metabolized fixed nitrogen, the reduction of protons to hydrogen through the action of the enzyme nitrogenase, a process called photofermentation (Gest and Kamen, 1949; Hallenbeck, 2013). In addition to organic acids, some species are capable of the conversion of molecules such as glycerol (Ghosh et al., 2012) and glucose (Abo-Hashesh et al., 2013) to hydrogen, achieving high substrate conversion yields of 95% and 75% respectively. It seemed likely that this process could be applied to the bioreformation of ethanol by photosynthetic bacteria for a number of reasons: (1) many species can grow on ethanol in the light (van Niel, 1944), showing that they can use light energy to drive the assimilation of ethanol, (2) the key enzyme for hydrogen production, nitrogenase, catalyzes an irreversible process which functions even in the presence of 100% hydrogen, and (3) a preliminary study demonstrated hydrogen production from ethanol, although the yield or the duration of this reaction were not examined (Fujii et al., 1983). Here the ability to use this process for bioreformation of ethanol was examined and RSM (response surface methodology) was applied in an attempt to optimize hydrogen yields by varying three key factors; light intensity, ethanol concentration and glutamate."
1,Methods,
2,Bacterial strain and pre-culture conditions,"2.1 Bacterial strain and pre-culture conditions The purple non-sulfur bacterium R hodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 (hup−) was routinely maintained in screw-cap sealed tubes completely filled with RCV glycerol (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck, 2009; Weaver et al., 1975), with biotin (15μg/L) and para-amino benzoic acid (200μg/L), and incubated at 30°C in a Biotronette Mark III (Lab-line instruments) environmental chamber equipped with three 150W incandescent bulbs. Pre-cultures were made by transferring 1ml of glycerol-grown cells into 17ml Hungate tubes completely filled with RCV-ethanol, and culturing for about 10days. The pre-culture was used to inoculate the cultures for hydrogen production."
3,Experimental set-up for ethanol bioreformation,2.2 Experimental set-up for ethanol bioreformation Light was provided by two panels of six 50W halogen bulbs and light intensity was measured with a Delta OHM photo/radiometer (HD 2102.1) and adjusted by a voltage regulator. Ethanol pre-grown cells were inoculated (5% (v/v)) into 120ml serum bottles filled with 80ml RCV medium and sparged with oxygen-free argon. Ethanol was injected into bottles with sterile syringes after sparging to prevent losses and the bottles were then incubated at 30°C in a water bath. Produced gases were introduced into inverted cylinders pre-filled with water using hydrogen impermeable FEP 890 tubing.
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Hydrogen was measured using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a 1M column packed with molecular sieve 5A and a thermal conductivity detector with argon as carrier gas. Ethanol concentrations were determined by an assay using ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) (Poklis and Mackell, 1982). Nitrogenase activity was determined by the acetylene reduction method (Hallenbeck et al., 1982). Protein determination was done using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Nitrogenase expression levels were determined by Western blotting followed by densitometric analysis using imageJ. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) was assayed using a coupled enzyme system where the oxaloacetate formed was reduced to malate by NADH in the presence of malate dehydrogenase (Bio Basic Canada Inc). The oxidation rate of NADH was quantified spectrophotometrically. The reaction mixture contained crude enzyme preparation, 10μmol of sodium phosphoenopyruvate, 10μmol KHCO3, 20μmol MgCl2, 80μmol Tris–HCl (pH 9.0) buffer, 14units of malate dehydrogenase and 0.15μmol NADH in 1ml total volume (Sadaie et al., 1997)."
5,Optimization with response surface methodology,"2.4 Optimization with response surface methodology A 3K Box–Behnken model was used to examine the key parameters for improved ethanol conversion and to analyze possible interactive effects of key factors (Box and Behnken, 1960). The combined effects of ethanol and glutamate concentration, ethanol and light intensity, and glutamate concentration and light intensity, on hydrogen yield and nitrogenase activity were investigated. Design Expert 8.0® was used for experimental design, making RSM plots, and statistical analysis. A total of 17 experimental runs were made, with the central point repeated 5times (Table 1 )."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effects of different ethanol concentrations on growth,"3.1 Effects of different ethanol concentrations on growth Ethanol is an especially electron rich carbon source, making it more reduced than biomass. Thus an appreciable number of electrons might be available for hydrogen production. First, the effects of various concentrations of ethanol, from 25mM to 1.09M, as sole carbon source were assessed using RCV medium with 4mM glutamate as nitrogen source. Bacterial growth curves were similar with ethanol concentrations less than 440mM (2%, v/v), with an OD660 at day 4 of close to 0.25 (Fig. 1 ). However, increasing the ethanol concentration to 1.09M (5% v/v) caused significant growth inhibition. This established an initial range that could be used in a DOE (design of experiments approach) to determine the effects of varying different parameters at the same time."
8,Optimization of ethanol biological reforming with response surface methodology,"3.2 Optimization of ethanol biological reforming with response surface methodology Response surface methodology has been shown to work well to maximize the ability to produce hydrogen by optimizing key factors (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Here a 3K Box–Behnken model was chosen to optimize the hydrogen production process with three independent variables; light intensity, ethanol concentration and glutamate concentration. Light is necessary for nitrogenase activity and hence for hydrogen production Meyer et al., 1978. Glutamate concentration is another key factor since it can support high levels of nitrogenase synthesis without a significant negative effect on activity (Masepohl and Hallenbeck, 2010; Yakunin et al., 1999). Ethanol, being the sole carbon substrate and the compound to be converted to hydrogen, is also an obvious key factor. The DOE software was used to set up a series of 17 experimental runs where these three factors were varied at three different levels and hydrogen yield (moles of hydrogen produced per mole of ethanol consumed) was examined as the response (Table 1). ANOVA analysis showed that the response surface for hydrogen yield was well fit by a quadratic model with an F-value of 8.15 (Table S1). The Model F-value of 8.15 implies the model is significant. There is only a 0.57% chance that an F-value this large could occur due to noise. The software predicted [glutamate], light intensity×[ethanol], (light intensity)2, [ethanol]2 and [glutamate]2 to be significant model terms. The ANOVA values show the extent to which the experimental data is statistically significant. For a number of reasons, there was appreciable variation between runs. Replication of the central point gave a rather large standard deviation of ±38% (see below). However, the strength of the DOE approach used here is that, even with large variability in individual data points, it allows a statistically significant model to be built which can then be used in more precise future studies. In the experimental setup used here, hydrogen production occurred during growth on ethanol as the sole carbon source with final OD600s ranging, depending upon the run, from 0.27 to 0.83. Hydrogen yields were calculated with respect to substrate (ethanol) utilized during the incubation period and residual ethanol, depending upon the run, varied between 10% and 78%."
9,Perturbation plot analysis of hydrogen yields,"3.3 Perturbation plot analysis of hydrogen yields A perturbation plot can be used to compare the effect of all the factors at one point in the chosen design space. Perturbation plots trace out the variations in a response due to changes in each individual factor as it is varied away from the reference point while the ratios of all the other components are held constant. This way all the possible variables are viewed on a single plot, allowing the visualization of the sensitivity of the response to deviations from the central point. Essentially this allows the direct visualization of how sensitive the system is to deviations from the central point. Thus, trace plots (also called perturbation plots in response surface and factorial designs) help one to compare the effects of all the components in the design space. The steepness in curvature of a given factor is an indication of how sensitive the response is to changes in that factor. Therefore, relatively flat lines can be interpreted as a general lack of significant effect on the response by variation in the factor under examination. Here this analysis was used to examine changes in hydrogen yields as the three factors under study, light intensity (A), ethanol concentration (B) and glutamate concentration (C) were varied from the design central point (Fig. 2 ). Seen from this perspective, yield was most sensitive to increases in glutamate (i.e. curve C is the steepest), with the response dropping off to 20% of its central point value at the highest glutamate concentration (6.5mM). On the other hand, yield was least sensitive to a decrease away from the central point in this factor, with a drop off to only 74% of the central value at the lowest value for this factor (0.5mM). Variations in light intensity (A) and ethanol (B) had less drastic effects with drop offs to 71% and 54%, respectively, of the central point value when these were increased to their highest values (250W/m2 and 30mM, respectively). Likewise, at the lowest values for these factors, 100W/m2 and 10mM, the yield drops to 56% and 49% of the central point value respectively. Finally, this analysis suggests that the actual yield optimum lies at slightly lower values of glutamate, with a predicted yield of 1.96mol H2/mol ethanol at 190W/m2, 20mM ethanol and 2.45mM glutamate."
10,Response surface for hydrogen yields and factor interactions,"3.4 Response surface for hydrogen yields and factor interactions Response surfaces were generated to allow pairwise comparison of the effects of variations in the chosen parameters on hydrogen yields. When light intensity and the concentration of ethanol are varied at a medium glutamate concentration (3.5mM), it can be seen that hydrogen yields are particularly low at low light intensities and high ethanol concentrations (Fig. 3 A). Hydrogen yield is the highest, nearly 2mol H2/mol ethanol, at intermediate levels of these two factors which appear to have an interactive effect, as seen from the concentric ellipses of the two-dimensional projection. Varying the concentrations of ethanol and glutamate at an intermediate level of light (175W/m2) had a number of interesting effects on hydrogen yields (Fig. 3B). Hydrogen yields are greatly suppressed at high glutamate concentrations, more or less independently of the ethanol concentration. Hydrogen yields approaching 2mol H2/mol ethanol were obtained at low to moderate glutamate concentrations and medium ethanol concentrations. Thus at the central point, replicated 5times, 1.85±0.71mol of H2 per mole of ethanol, was obtained. Again, the concentric ellipses of the two-dimensional projection demonstrate interaction between these two factors. Finally, somewhat similar effects to those noted above for ethanol and glutamate (Fig. 3B) are seen when variations in light intensity and glutamate at constant ethanol (20mM) are examined. Hydrogen yields at high glutamate concentrations are low irrespective of the light intensity. A clear optimum in hydrogen yield, again approaching 2mol H2/mol ethanol are found at intermediate levels of glutamate and light, with concentric ellipses of the two-dimensional projection showing that these factors as well interact in their effects on the hydrogen yield response. Of course, in addition to high yields, practical ethanol reformation to hydrogen would also require significant volumetric production rates. As noted previously in many studies of the photofermentative conversion of different substrates to hydrogen by the photosynthetic bacteria, volumetric production rates are very low (Hallenbeck et al., 2012; Hallenbeck, 2013). The conversion of ethanol to hydrogen, examined here, is no exception, with average volumetric production of 47ml H2/L/day at the central point. Therefore, in order for this to be in the range required for a practical system, volumetric production rates would need to be increased by several orders of magnitude. This is the major challenge for future studies on this process."
11,Nitrogenase expression and its relationship to hydrogen yields,"3.5 Nitrogenase expression and its relationship to hydrogen yields Photofermentation by photosynthetic bacteria has been studied for over half a century and the overwhelming consensus is that, regardless of substrate, hydrogen evolution is catalyzed by nitrogenase (Hallenbeck, 2013). Therefore, especially since hydrogen evolution is not observed in the presence of ammonium which represses nitrogenase, it is safe to assume that the enzyme responsible for hydrogen production under the conditions employed here is nitrogenase, which in the absence of N2 reduces protons to hydrogen. Thus it was useful to examine the levels of nitrogenase present under the different conditions. The expression levels of the Mo-Fe and Fe components of nitrogenase were analyzed by Western blotting (see Fig. 4 ). The amounts of nitrogenase proteins, Mo-Fe protein+Fe protein, in general show relatively little variations between the different conditions (data not shown for run 16 and 17), shown here as run number (for levels of the three factors for each run number see Table 1). Thus, it would appear that parameters other than the total amount of enzyme present exert major control over nitrogenase activity and consequent hydrogen yields."
12,PEPC activity of ethanol grown cells and acetate grown cells,"3.6 PEPC activity of ethanol grown cells and acetate grown cells Previously it was reported that Rhodopseudomonas sp. No.7 had three fold higher levels of PEPC (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) activity when grown on ethanol as compared to acetate (Sadaie et al., 1997). Hence it was of interest to examine the PEPC activity levels of the strain used here while producing hydrogen in comparison to acetate grown cells. Indeed, here PEPC activity was found to be two fold higher in ethanol grown cells, 75.4±15.9nmol/min/mg protein, than in acetate grown cells, 37.4±6.2nmol/min/mg protein. It is known that acetate is assimilated through the glyoxylate pathway (Laguna et al., 2011), but the finding that PEPC activity is higher when the cells are grown on ethanol suggests that ethanol is converted to acetyl-CoA through a two-step oxidation and then enters the citric acid cycle (Fig. 5 ). Although the need for increased PEPC activity might be related to a requirement to maintain redox balance, a need that seems to drive much of the metabolism in these organisms (Larimer et al., 2004; McKinlay and Harwood, 2010), it is more likely related to biosynthetic requirements. Growth on ethanol as sole carbon source requires metabolites found in the gluconeogenesis pathway, and these are most easily furnished through the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate by PEPC since direct synthesis of pyruvate from acetyl-CoA requires reduced ferredoxin and is therefore difficult (Fig. 5). Future work could be aimed at increasing hydrogen yields through metabolic engineering since the present yield, 2mol H2/mol of ethanol only represents 33% of the theoretical maximum. This would require detailed knowledge about the metabolic pathways involved."
13,Conclusion,"Here the sustained bioreformation of ethanol by R . palustris was demonstrated for the first time, and characterized in some detail. Response surface methodology was used to examine the role and possible interaction of three key factors, light intensity, and ethanol and glutamate concentrations, on hydrogen yields. Under optimal conditions, 190W/m2, 20mM ethanol and 2.45mM glutamate, nearly 2mol H2/mol ethanol were obtained. Little variation in the amount of the key enzyme, nitrogenase, were seen when cells grown under the different conditions were examined by Western blot. This suggests that future work to increase yields should focus on metabolic engineering of the pathways involved."
