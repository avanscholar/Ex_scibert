0,Introduction,"In the present scenario, low molecular weight alcohols are used as a blending agent together with gasoline/diesel for various industrial purposes. They can also be used as input or raw materials for different chemical reactions and product formation. Acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation (ABE) is the formulation path for the marketable manufacturing of bio-ethanol/butanol. The alcohols produced in this manner remain with the aqueous phase. Bulk production of low molecular weight alcohols (lower alcohols) are not found to be economical because of the formation of azeotrope with water. Extraction is considered one of the effective methods which can be used commercially for the production of lower alcohols from their aqueous phase [1,2]. Other processes, such as simple distillation, membrane separation, pre-vaporization and absorption, were attempted earlier [3]. Recently, the extractive separation process is extensively used by researchers for the extraction of alcohols [4-13]. Looking at these advantages, we have proposed extraction as a viable separation tool for alcohols. During the past few decades, hydrophobic solvents are found to be useful for extraction if the feed is highly aqueous [14,15]. A promising solvent should possess a low melting temperature, low viscosity and a high boiling point. It should also be non-toxic and non-corrosive. A higher cost, complexity in synthesis and difficulty in biodegradability makes the use of traditional green solvents such as Ionic Liquid (IL) difficult. In this aspect, alternative green solvents such as Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) [16,17] are explored. Overall, DES are prepared by mixing of hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) in a predefined molar ratio. The hydrogen bond formed among HBA and HBD provides an eutectic point lower than their corresponding melting point. However, this definition is contested in a recent work by Coutinho et al. [18,19] where instead of hydrogen bonding, the entire phase envelope shall be known before classifying them as DES. The idea of DES was initially formulated by Abbott et al. [20]. DESs are used as extractive solvent in Liquid LiquidEquilibria (LLE) process and various applications such as electrochemistry, catalysis, biochemistry and hydrogel [21-28]. Recently a set of DESs have been used as azeotrope breakers for the liquid-liquid extraction of lower alcohols [29]. For IL, the toxicity part is a burning issue, as the preparatory substances make their production non-green. Also, the refinement and manufacture expenses have added to their drawbacks. Looking at this, hydrophobic DESs can replace some ILs so as to make them environmentally viable [1,29-33]. However the term DES is loosely connected, i.e the fluid instability in the case needs to be confirmed. Hence we shall term the solvent to be a mixture of two components namely HBA and HBD. In the later sections we shall term these as DES on confirmation of their physical interaction through NMR. In the present study, the hydrophobic solvent system or the eutectic mixture is prepared by mixing of DL-menthol (HBD) and decanoic acid (HBA) at a molar ratio of 1:1 at a temperature T=298.15 K and p=0.1 MPa. It should be noted that the resulting DES are not novel compound or a new type of compound, but binary eutectic mixture. Further the presence of a eutectic point in a mixture cannot be used to define or characterize a DES since essentially all mixtures of compounds immiscible in the solid phase will present an eutectic point [19,34-38]. Thereafter the selectivity and distribution coefficients were compared with reported solvents. In the concluding stage, through the LLE data a scale-up for the extraction of lower alcohols was also adopted to evaluate the solvent recovery, scale up and its associated cost. Here ASPEN Plus V8.8 was invoked through a hybrid extraction process as reported earlier [39] and also benchmarked with our own measurements [40]. The scheme was found to be economically viable in terms of overall energy, operating and capital costs. In such a scheme the extractor is operated at ambient condition without any additional energy. This helps in the reduction of energy and cost significantly as compared to the explicit extractive distillation [41,42]. Hybrid extraction–distillation system was used previously where the aqueous solution of pyridine was used [43,44]. In our work, DES molecule was used in ASPEN as a pseudocomponent. This was possible through the pioneering work of Palomar et al. [45] where COSMO based implementation was used in ASPEN and subsequently used for aromatic extraction [46] and drug isolation [47]. An economic comparison is also formulated at the penultimate step with the NRTL derived parameters using Gibbs phase stability criterion. Overall this work represents a multiscale process i.e. from laboratory level (preparation) to scale up study (ASPEN simulations) whereby batch LLE experiments represent the connection between the two. After successful separation, a comparison is carried out with other solvents in the concluding section. The cost of production for the conventional solvent namely mesitylene, is also directed."
1,Experimental details,
2,Chemicals and preparation of DES,"2.1 Chemicals and preparation of DES Table 1 shows the compounds, purity, solubility and source for all the compounds used in this work. 1H NMR spectroscopy is used to check the purity of DL-menthol, decanoic acid and lower alcohols (ethanol/1-propanol/1-butanol). Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6 ≥ 99.8%) manufactured by Merck is used as NMR solvent and is used as received. All analytical grade chemicals are used in the present work without any purification. As per the supplier specification, for DL-menthol a racemic mixture has been used in this work. The properties of chemicals were according to its specifications provided by manufacturers except for DES. For the preparation of DES, different molar ratios of DL-menthol and decanoic acid is first inserted in a jacketed vessel and heated till 323 K. This is subjected to heating along with stirring so that a homogenous solution is obtained. It is then cooled for an appropriate amount of time allowing crystals to form and then again heated so as to make the last solid disappear. This step helps us to exactly locate the phase transition point between solid and liquid phase. Prior to use, the DES was subjected to vacuum at 25 mm Hg so as to decrease the water and volatile content to minimum."
3,Analysis methods,"2.2 Analysis methods Karl Fisher Titrator (Model No.: 787 KF; Make: M/s Metrohm, Switzerland) was used for measurement of water content in DES. The uncertainty of the apparatus was within ±100 ppm and the measurement was confirmed with a triplicate run at each point. The density of DES was measured at T = 298.15 K by a densitometer (Anton Paar: DMA 4500 M) with an uncertainty of u(ρ)= 0.001g/cm3. The boiling point of DES was estimated using the standard Joback and Reid method [48]. The DES being a binary mixture shall present a liquidus temperature which was measured via Differential Scanning CalorimetryDSC (Model: TGA/DSC1 Star System, Make: Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), where the details are available in our earlier work [1]. The flow rate of the purge gas (N2) was retained at 60 ml/min with a heating and cooling rate of 1°C/min. The aliquot of DES sample was transferred to DSC pan and vacuum-packed so as to prevent vaporization. The uncertainty of liquidus temperature was found as u(T)= 0.03 K. A 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Make: Bruker) is used for the 1H NMR analysis of DES. An interfacial Rheometer (MCR 301, Anton Paar, Austria) with uncertainty of ±0.001 mPa•s was used to measure the viscosity of the DES. The rheometer was equipped with a thermal jacket connected to the heating circulation pump to control the temperature having an accuracy of ±0.01 K. The interfacial disk rheometer involves the measurement of torsional stress upon a rotating disk near the liquid surface on rotation mode. The torque exerted upon the disk due to the liquid measures the viscosity. The calibrations of the rheometer is checked by determining the viscosity of a specified typical Newtonian oil (Cannon S600 oil) with nominal viscosity of 1.4 Pas at 298.15 K. Subsequently, viscosity was measured in the shear rate range of 1.0 to 1000 s−1. The viscosity of the prepared DES was measured at different temperature ranging from 293.15 -358.15 K (Table S1)."
4,Solid liquid equilibria measurements and predictions,"2.3 Solid liquid equilibria measurements and predictions The SLE procedure was first benchmarked with the prediction of Fernandez et al. [51] for choline chloride (HBA) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (HBD). As mentioned earlier, the DL-menthol and decanoic acid was first inserted in a jacketed vessel according to their molar ratio and heated till 323 K or above their individual melting point. This was subjected to heating along with stirring so that a homogenous solution is obtained. Thereafter it was cooled at a certain rate so as to provide time for the solid or crystal phase to appear. This was again heated so as to make the last solid disappear. This step helps us to exactly locate the phase transition point between solid and liquid phase. Using the same methodology, we went ahead with the preparation of our hydrophobic solvent involving DL-menthol and decanoic acid. Here the eutectic point of the solvent system suggested namely 0.5/0.5 (HBA: HBD) or unity which is the same as predicted in by COSMO-SAC model in Section 3.1. For the solvent preparation the standard uncertainties were u(T) = 0.03 K, u(x) = 0.001 and u(p) = 5 kPa. This ratio, therefore, corresponds to the working liquid temperature of the hydrophobic solvent."
5,Procedure for LLE,"2.4 Procedure for LLE Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE) for the quaternary systems was measured at T =298.15 K and p=0.1 MPa. For every experiment, known amounts of constituents were added in 15 ml glass bottle. The corresponding feed compositions were decided so that they lie within the heterogeneous region. The sample vials were preserved in incubator shaker (Daihan Lab Tech, China), with temperature of 298.15 K (u(T) = 0.03 K) at 200 rpm for 6 h. LLE samples were then kept for 24 h to ensure the equilibrium of the two phases in a similar manner as reported in our earlier work [1]. 1H NMR analysis is used here for the composition of extract as well as raffinate phases. For the 1H NMR analysis 0.5 ml of NMR solvent (DMSO-D6) was mixed in 0.1 ml of LLE sample within the NMR tube (Sigma-Aldrich). The reliability of uncertainty for 1H NMR with binary pairs were found in the range of ±0.001. Distribution coefficient (β) and selectivity (S) of lower alcohols were then used to calculate the effectiveness of the solvent (DES) using Eqs. 1 and 2 as given below [52,53]: (1) β a l c = x a l c D E S x a l c W a t e r (2) S = β a c l / β w a t e r Here xwand xalc are the mole fractions of water and alcohol respectively. The mole fraction in Extract and Raffinate phases are represented via subscript DES and water, respectively. The quantity of solvent necessary for the process is hence related to distribution coefficient [1]. Figure S1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of the prepared solvent (DL-menthol:decanoic acid; molar ratio 1:1) in the supporting information. The peak of DMSO-D6 is observed at 2.5 ppm and is used as reference peak. Eq. 3 is used to calculate the concentration of other components as given below [1,2]: (3) x i = H i ∑ i = 1 n H i Where mole fraction of component is given by xi. The peak area of one hydrogen atom of ‘i’, unique to a component is represented by Hi. 1H NMR spectra of pure DES is shown in Figure S1 where the -OH group in DL-menthol and decanoic acid is recorded at 4.27 ppm (peak 15) and 11.94 ppm (peak 14) respectively. It shows a molar ratio of 1:1. In another confirmation, peak at 1.24 ppm resembling 12-H atoms of decanoic acid has an area of 12 (effective area due to single hydrogen atom is 1) which is similar to the -CH group of DES at 3.16 ppm (peak 9) again resembling a unit area due to a single hydrogen atom. The NMR findings here confirms with the reported literature that the solvents made from menthol and decanoic acid in the proportion 1:1 (this work), form stable mixtures in water which can be considered as an individual component (i.e. pseudocomponent) [54]. This 1:1 menthol: decanoic mixture referred to as Deep Eutectic Solvents are widely applied as hydrophobic solvents in several works, none of them reporting fluid phase instability which is similar to our case. As the DES essentially needs to be used in the aqueous rich phase, it stability with water was also tested by mixing one part of DES with two part of water (w/w) [1]. Figures S2 and S3 show the 1H NMR spectra of DES rich phase (upper part) and water-rich phase (bottom part) respectively. The absence of water in the DES rich phase (upper part) shows that the prepared DES was hydrophobic in nature. Figure S1 (peak at 3.38) refers to the dried DES where the water amount as measured by the Karl Fisher Titrator was 0.5% by weight."
6,Computational details,
7,COSMO-SAC model for SLE prediction,"3.1 COSMO-SAC model for SLE prediction Gaussview 5.0 is adopted for initiating the geometry of the molecules namely DL-menthol, alcohol, decanoic acid and water [55]. Gaussian 09 was used for optimizing the geometry of the molecules using DFT theory at B3LYP and 6-31G* basis set [56]. BVP86/TZVP/density functional theory (DFT) was then used for the COSMO file generation. The optimized COSMO surfaces for DL-menthol and decanoic acid are shown in Figure S4. Thereafter sigma profiles of the molecules were derived using a statistical mechanical framework [57-60]. The surface color represents the neutral (green), negative (blue) and positive region (red) within the molecule surface. For e.g. the oxygen in both DL-menthol and organic acid shows a red region which implies that the charges developed are positive in nature which is the inherent nature of the surface screening charges. Using the same analogy, the green regions consist of the hydrogens, while the blue region is because of the existence of hydrogen atoms. Using these sigma profile,the activity coefficient was predicted using standard methodology [57,58]. The details of the LLE implementation using COSMO-SAC is also given in our earlier work [57,58]. The mole ratio of HBD to HBA was predicted using the COMSO-SAC model based on the Solid-Liquid Equilibria equation as given below: (4) ln ( x s L γ s L ) = − Δ f u s H s R T s , f u s ( 1 − T s , f u s T ) Here Δ f u s H s is heat of fusion, and T s , f u s is the melting temperature of pure solute. T and R are the equilibrium temperature (K) and ideal gas constant respectively. x s L is mole fraction of solute (DL-menthol) in liquid phase i.e. decanoic acid. The pure component parameters (melting point and heat of fusion) are obtained as per literature and is given in Table 2 . γ s L is activity coefficient of solute (DL-menthol) in liquid phase i.e. decanoic acid. Initially the activity coefficient was taken to be unity and ideal case mole fractions of the solute were calculated using the SLE equation (Eq. 2) at different temperatures [65]. For this step first HBA was considered as the solute and HBD as the solvent with the results again checked by inversion of the components to remove numerical artefacts. The mole fractions obtained were then employed to compute the non-ideal liquid phase activity coefficient by invoking the COSMO-SAC model. This can be thought of as an initial guess to start the simulation. This is necessitated as we have temperature dependent term on both sides of SLE equation. With the current activity coefficient, mole fractions were computed using the SLE equation unless both the sides of SLE are equal. Using the same methodology, we computed the eutectic point of DES involving DL-menthol and decanoic acid. Here the eutectic point of the DES gave a molar ratio of 0.5/0.5 (HBA:HBD) or 1 which is the same as adopted in the experimental procedure as in Section 2.3."
8,ASPEN simulation details,"3.2 ASPEN simulation details Once the LLE results are available, a need of scale-up for lower alcohol separation to be adopted. The commercial simulator namely Aspen Plus V8.8 is conventionally used to simulate the entore process. It should be noted that a simple distillation is considered not economical and effective to separate the lower alcohols from aqueous solution [41]. A huge amount of energy is required to vaporize the entire water content due to the higher boiling point of 1-butanol. In the case of LLE, all the water can be extracted as a raffinate phase from the extractor. Previous authors used the same strategy where a hybrid extraction–distillation system was used to separate pyridine and water [43,44]. The flowsheet is given in Fig. 1 (a) and 1(b), which explains the entire sequential process optimization flow chart as used for hybrid extraction-distillation. In the flowsheet, DES was added as a single component using the sigma profile as given in Eq. 7 within the ASPEN suite [15]. This requires the molecular weight, viscosity, sigma profile and the boiling point of DES. In this work the both the in-house COSMO-SAC reimplementation [15,58] and the one implemented in ASPEN Plus V8.8 was used. Hence we refer the COSMO-SAC predictions in ASPEN as “COSMO-ASPEN” in the ensuing sections."
9,Results and discussions,
10,Determination of the SLE of DES,"4.1 Determination of the SLE of DES Fig. S5 shows the visual observation of all the experimentally attempted molar ratios, namely 0.5:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1, where all of them correspond to clear liquid phase. Table 3 illustrate the COSMO-SAC verification of its respective eutectic composition. This is confirmed in Fig. S6 which shows the DSC curve. However it should be noted that DES being a binary mixture here present a liquidus temperature where T-Tm refers to liquidus range starting from T. This also agrees with the literature report where a molar ratio of 1:1 is predicted for the synthesis of the similar DES [31,34]."
11,Liquid-liquid extraction of alcohols with DES,"4.2 Liquid-liquid extraction of alcohols with DES The system containing the hydrophobic solvent (DL-menthol and decanoic acid), alcohols and water is considered as a quaternary system. But, as discussed in Section 2.4, from NMR results it is clear that the DES structural entity is kept intact in both extract and raffinate phases. This has also been confirmed by other authors [66,67]. Hence we have considered DES as a single compound and have considered the LLE as pseudo-ternary system rather than a quaternary system. LLE was carried out for the pseudo-ternary systems namely, DES (1) + alcohols (ethanol/propanol/butanol) (2) + water (3) at 0.1 MPa and T=298.15 K. Tables 4–6 display the obtained LLE results for ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol in terms of their respective mole fraction in both phases. 1H NMR was used for determination of the mole fractions of components in the extract as well as raffinate phases. This was calculated in a similar manner as our earlier work [1,2]. 1H NMR spectra, as well as the algebraic procedure for computing mole fraction in extract and raffinate phase for the pseudo-ternary system DES (1) + 1-butanol (2) + water (3), is shown in Fig. S7 and Fig. S8 respectively. Further, the spectra were also used to detect the presence of DES (if any) in the water-rich phase.The distribution ratio and selectivity for ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol are calculated from LLE data in Tables 4–6, respectively. The corresponding pseudo-ternary diagrams are shown in Fig. 2 . A large value of distribution coefficient indicates lesser solvent requirement [15]. For 1-butanol, higher values of selectivity are observed when compared to ethanol and propanol. Thus, it is confirmed that 1-butanol has a preferential ability for DES. The separation factor is shown to decrease with the increase of alcohol concentration in feed. Fig. 3 , shows the comparison of selectivity and distribution ratio of butanol with reported DES and other IL's. A similar comparison for ethanol and propanol was performed in Figs. S9-S10. Here one can see the selectivity and distribution coefficient of the studied DES are much higher than the other solvents for alcohol extraction. Although some ILs show higher distribution coefficient but their selectivity values were very low, which indicate the studied DES is a better choice. Abbreviation used in Fig. 3 DES: DL-menthol (HBD) and Decanoic acid (HBA) at a molar ratio of 1:1 [Im10,1][TCB]: 1-decyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetracyanoborate [53] [Im10,1][Tf2N]: 1-decyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [67] [Mo10,1][TCB]: 4-decyl-4-methyl-morpholinium tetracyanoborate [67] [Mo10,1][Tf2N]: 4-decyl-4-methyl-morpholinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [67] [Bmim][Pf6]: 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [68] [Hmim][Pf6]: 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [68] [Omim][Pf6]: 1-Methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [68] [Bmim][Tf2N]: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [68] [Hmim][Tf2N]: Tetradecyltrihexylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [68,69] [Omim][Tf2N]: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [68] [Hmim][TfO]: 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [68] [Omim][TfO]: 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [68] [Pmim][TfO]: 1- phenylpropyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [68] [HMIM]BF4]: 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [68] [OMIM][BF4]: 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [68] Cyphos 104: Tetradecyl(trihexyl) phosphonium bis-2,4,4-trimethylpentyl-phosphinate [68] [MTOAOct]: Methyltrioctylammonium octanoate [69] [TDAMCH]: Tetrakis(decyl) ammonium 1-methyl-1-cyclohexanoate [69] Table S2 shows the thermal stability of the individual components and the DES. The decomposition temperatures (Tdec) of DL menthol and various organic acids based DESs are also reported by Ribeiro et al. [34]. The decomposition temperature of the DL menthol based DESs increases with the increasing chain length of the organic acid. This is usually in the range of 220°C- 230°C. Overall this was reported to vary through HBA selection as: “acetic acid< pyruvic acid< lactic acid<decanoic acid<lauric acid”. Hence in the later section, this ensures that the flash unit/distillation should be operated below 200°C which is our case. This will confirm that the DES is intact and does not decomposes in actual operation. Once the LLE data were available, NRTL thermodynamic model was adapted to regress the LLE data. Binary interaction parameters are used for defining the DES in Aspen Plus as it is unavailable in the ASPEN databank. The binary parameters needs to be regressed in such a manner so that the phase stability of the binary system is consistent i.e. the same parameters converge to binary systems when used. The parameter estimation strategy follows a combination of conventional minimization of composition distances with the additional constraint of phase stability. In this way, we ensure that the obtained solutions can be appropriately implemented in process simulation software such as Aspen Plus. Details of the regressing procedure can be found in literature [70] and given in Eq. (5). The objective function (Fobj) is used to minimize the summation of the composition distances between experimental data and regressed values. (5) F o b j = − ∑ k = 1 m ∑ l = I I I ∑ i = 1 c w i k l ( x i k l − x ^ i k l ) 2 , w i k l = 1 A positive tangent plane distance was imposed for some test points of the Gibbs energy of mixing (Gm) surface. The parameter estimation problem was solved using GAMS 24.8 and CONOPT 4.04 as the non-linear solver. Results were then plotted to check the phase stability of the systems as shown in Fig. S11. Table S3 shows the NRTL binary interaction parameters of pseudo-ternary systems. These were regressed from the tie-line data as available for the butanol system in Tables 4–6. Values for the pair, namely 1-butanol–water is obtained from Aspen Plus LLE database and kept fixed in the procedure. The non-randomness parameter (αij) was fixed to 0.2 for all the pseudo-ternary systems. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was used for comparing the goodness of data is as per the following Eq. 6 [71]: (6) R M S D = ( − F o b j 2 m c ) 1 / 2 = [ ∑ k = 1 m ∑ i = 1 c ∑ l = I I I ( x i k l − x ^ i k l ) 2 2 m c ] 1 / 2 Where m denotes the tie line numbers, and c, the total components. x i k l is the experimental mole fraction and x ^ i k I is the predicted mole fraction for the component i in the k th tie line for phase l."
12,LLE prediction: Sigma profile of COSMO-SAC,"4.3 LLE prediction: Sigma profile of COSMO-SAC In the COSMO model, the sigma profile describes the local polarity of the molecule surface as per the earlier cut-off region for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors [1]. The sigma profile of DES (Fig. 4 ) was calculated from Eq. 7, which is the mixture of HBD ( p H B D ( σ ) ) and HBA ( p H B A ( σ ) ) molecule [72]. (7) p D E S ( σ ) = p H B A ( σ ) + p H B D ( σ ) = f H B A p H B A ( σ ) + f H B D p H B D ( σ ) Here f H B A and f H B D are the molar fractions that are assumed in the experimental work. We have followed COSMO-ASPEN model in the case of pseudo-ternary systems representing decanoic acid-based DES. In such a case the sigma profiles as obtained in Eq. 7 are used as input to ASPEN databank within the pseudo component model. Thereafter the tie lines of DES pseudo-ternary system have been depicted for COSMO-ASPEN (Fig. 2). The RMSD obtained via COSMO-ASPEN were 0.053, 0.01 and 0.008 for ethanol, propanol and butanol respectively."
13,Hybrid extraction-distillation with DES,"4.4 Hybrid extraction-distillation with DES Fig. 5 shows the process flowsheet for the separation of 1-butanol having an output of 4.38 × 104 ton/yr (=5000 kg/h). The process flow sheet was designed for a feed flow rate of 25000 kg/h and feed containing 1-butanol with 0.2 w/w or 20% weight. In the flowsheet, an extractor is coupled with a distillation unit. The results for the sequential optimization scheme is done similarly as in our previous work [2]. This has been done so as to compare the performance and economic efficiency for conventional and DES solvents. The optimum numbers of equilibrium stages computed are seven, while for the distillation column, it is forty-four stages. The recycle stream solvent (DES) is added to complete the material balance. As discussed earlier COSMO-SAC thermodynamic model is used in the Aspen Plus V8.8®professional simulator (Bedford, Massachusetts) using the pseudo component input (Eq. 6) to define the DES. Initially, the solvent flow rate is optimized in the extractor column for 100 % recovery of butanol in the extract stream via sensitivity analysis (Fig. S12). It observed that the solvent (DES) flow rate requires around 3500 kg/h for a 100 % retrieval of 1-butanol. In such a scenario, the optimal solvent (DES) can be scaled down to 2,500 kg/h so as to recover1-butanol 0.995 w/w or 99.5% in weight. As discussed earlier [2], higher the reboiler heat duty, lesser the number of stages, which in turn increases the heat exchanger area and column diameter. Therefore, DESIGN SPEC was used in the distillation column for a fixed mass fraction of 1-butanol, which is kept at 0.862 w/w in the distillate stream. This is the maximum possible recovery of 1-butanol after convergence in the case of DES. Thereafter, the reflux ratio and distillate rate are varied as per the established procedure for optimizing the distillation column. After optimization of the distillation column, the least possible number of stages (Ndistillation = 44) accompanied by a reflux ratio of 2.01 is obtained. The column diameter (Ddistillation) was computed as 1.68 meter. The obtained results of each stream (Fig. 5) is shown in the Table 7 . The raffinate stream is dominated with aqueous phase and the obtained results agreed with the experimental tie lines (Fig. 2, Table 6). On a similar note, the extract phase consists of entirely 1-butanol. The scale-up and solvent recovery step is carried out after the LLE studies. In this step an extractor is coupled with RadFac distillation column. This ultimately shall give us the Total Annual Cost (TAC)."
14,Economics and equipment sizing,"4.5 Economics and equipment sizing Table S4 shows the empirical relation for sizing the equipment and estimation of the cost. The optimal thickness of the distillation column is usually computed through the vapor velocity [39,44]. Reboiler and condenser heat duties here mainly depends on the reflux ratio, as a higher reflux ratio requires a higher reboiler duty. The heat exchanger area is designed according to reboiler heat input, condenser heat removal (in MW), general heat transfer constant and temperature difference (first and second stage for condenser; and last and second last stage for reboiler). The payback period considered here for the optimal cost estimation is 3 years. In the first step, the optimization of the extractor is performed. After that, based on the optimal output of extractor, optimization of distillation is carried out. This is done as per the procedure discussed in our earlier work [2]. The final results with DES as a solvent are also compared with the conventional solvent mesitylene (Table S5). Such a comparison has been made for the extraction of 1-butanol having same feed (25000 kg/h) composition (1-butanol 0.2 w/w in aqueous solution) and extractor stages (Nextractor=7). It is observed that the DES solvent required is 2500 kg/h through a reflux ratio (RR) of 2.01 and a 4733.21 KW reboiler duty. Overall the DES requires an order of magnitude lesser solvent as compared to mesitylene. Further, the number of stages required is also less when compared to mesitylene. The diameter of the column required is 1.68 m in case of DES; while for mesitylene, it is 2.05 m. The Total Annual Cost (TAC) is the least in case of DES. Overall the current DES may be recommended for the extraction of lower alcohols considering their scaleup studies and costs involved."
15,Conclusion,The DES based on DL-menthol and decanoic acid was proposed for the removal of lower alcohol from the water phase. The extraction efficiency of 1-butanol was much higher compared to ethanol and 1-propanol using the capric acid based DES. A larger value of selectivity and distribution coefficient makes the DES useful for the extraction of 1-butanol. Water content in the raffinate phase is 99.5%. This is confirmed against both experimental and ASPEN simulation. A hybrid extraction-distillation is suggested for the economical separation of 1-butanol as well as to initiate a scale-up using Aspen Plus V8.8 with the prepared DES. An economic evaluation concerning Total Annual Cost (TAC) is also reported. Optimal retrieval of 1-butanol is found to be 86.2% using a solvent to feed (S/F) ratio ~ 0.1. Overall DES flow rate of 2499 kg/h is required for a feed of 25000 kg/h which contains 80% water and 20% 1-butanol. DES is found to be effective as a solvent when compared to the traditional solvent (mesitylene). This study will hence help the scientific and industrial community to implement the scale-up the current data for exploring the extraction of the lower alcohols in an economic manner.
