0,Introduction,"Due to the decreasing energy resources against the increasing energy needs of the world, intensive researches have been made on new alternative energy sources that can meet the future energy needs and prevent environmental pollution [1]. The main features of an alternative ideal fuel are that it is an economical fuel that can be produced, stored and used in an environmentally-friendly, renewable, light, high thermal value, safe and clean way. Therefore, researches have shown that because of its superior properties, hydrogen will replace fossil fuels as an alternative fuel and is the energy of the future [2–4]. Hydrogen is a highly reactive and flammable gas. Due to its low density, it is very difficult to store and there is a need to develop a safe and convenient method of storage. In order to use hydrogen energy extensively, hydrogen must be safely stored in small volumes and in large quantities. In general, hydrogen has been stored in three different forms: i. compressed gas, ii. cryogenic liquid and iii. complex metal hydrides, chemical hydrogen materials such as chemical hydrides, and carbon-based adsorbents [5]. These methods have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. Although the storage, transport or use in gas or liquid phase of hydrogen is possible, the storage or use in gas phase of hydrogen requires very large volumes and the storage in liquid phase requires both very high pressure and high costs. The storage of hydrogen in a safe, effective, and cheap system is necessary for practical applications, and therefore hydrogen storage in the solid matrix is the only alternative. Hydrogen can be stored in solid materials such as metal hydrides, organo-metal structured compounds, zeolites, and carbon derivatives [6]. Carbon derived materials are materials with low density, high surface area and large porous structure, high chemical stability, which can be prepared by various preparation methods [7]. Because of these properties, studies are underway to use carbon derived materials such as carbon nanotubes [6–7], graphite nanofibers [8], activated carbons [9–11], nanoporous carbon materials [12] and carbon spheres [13] in hydrogen storage and have been considered for the next generation of energy systems. There are a limited number of studies in the literature on carbon sphere synthesis from different sources and their use in hydrogen storage. For example, Jiang et al. (2010) obtained carbon spheres containing hollow nitrogen with CO2 activation at 1223 K. They measured the hydrogen storage capacities of these carbon spheres, which have a microporous structure, at room temperature and 8 MPa, and determined as 2.21 wt% [14]. Wanelska et al. (2013) prepared hollow mesoporous carbon spheres by chemical vapor deposition method from SiO2 spheres and then, modified the prepared carbon spheres with Pd nanoparticles. They measured as 0.36 wt% the hydrogen storage capacity of the modified carbon spheres at 298 K and 24 bar pressure [15]. Krishnamurthy et al. (2014) synthesized carbon micro/nano spheres by hydrothermal carbonization method from sucrose and starch, determined the hydrogen storage capacity of the spheres by the electrochemical method and found that the hydrogen storage capacities of carbon spheres obtained from sucrose and starch determined as ∼ 0.9 wt% and 1 wt%, respectively [13]. Zielinska et al. (2016) prepared mesoporous hollow silica spheres from the mesoporous hollow silica spheres by using chemical vapor deposition method using ethylene as the carbon source. After that, these spheres were modified using Pd nanoparticles with two different methods, reflux and impregnation, and examined the hydrogen storage properties of Pd-doped carbon spheres. The sample with the larger Pd particle distribution showed the highest hydrogen uptake capacity (0.51 wt%) [5]. Baca et al. (2017) prepared irregular mesoporous hollow carbon spheres by chemical vapor deposition method based on SiO2 mesoporous spheres using ethylene as the carbon source. They determined the hydrogen storage capacities at 40 °C and 45 bar by modifying the obtained spheres with Pd nanoparticles. They measured the highest hydrogen adsorption of Pd-supported irregular mesoporous carbon spheres as 0.55 wt% at 20 bar and 0.59 wt% at 30 bar [16]. As can be seen from the literature summary above, there are a limited number of studies on the synthesis of carbon spheres with different starting materials and different methods, and the hydrogen storage capacities of carbon spheres. However, there are no studies on obtaining carbon spheres from biomass, especially waste biomass, and determining the hydrogen storage capacity of the obtained carbon spheres. This study is important for the conversion of waste biomass into a usable and valuable product. Obtaining of carbon spheres from rice husk (RH), which is a waste biomass, by hydrothermal carbonization method and the determining the hydrogen storage capacity constitute the originality of this study. In the literature, there are studies on obtaining activated carbon from waste biomass and determining the hydrogen storage capacities in activated carbons. However, this is not the same case for carbon sphere synthesis and use. In addition, when the methods used in the production of valuable carbon materials are compared with, another difference of this study is understood. Because the hydrothermal carbonization method used in this study is a very simple and one-step process compared to the classical activated carbon synthesis. Therefore, the aims of this study were to prepare carbon spheres from RH by hydrothermal carbonization method at different carbonization temperatures and reaction times using HCl as an activating agent, to characterize the carbon spheres using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area device, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), and to determine hydrogen storage capacities of carbon spheres as hydrogen storage material as a function of pressure and temperature."
1,Material and Methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The RH was obtained from wastes of plant materials grown in agricultural areas in the region of Gönen, Balıkesir in Turkey. The hydrochloric acid (HCl) used for chemical activation in the hydrothermal carbonization method and the ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) used for washing processes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals used in the experimental studies were in analytical purity."
3,Method,"2.2 Method The RH was initially washed thoroughly with pure water to remove contamination and dried at 105 °C for 48 h. The dried RH was first treated with liquid nitrogen, ground with laboratory type blender and sieved using Retsch AS 200 siever. After grinding and sieving, RH with a particle size of 100–500 μm was obtained. Carbon sphere synthesis from RH was carried out by hydrothermal carbonization method. HCl was used as solvent in the reaction medium to convert RH, a lignocellulosic biomass, into carbon sphere. 2.5 g RH, 50 mL distilled water and mass ratio of 1/1 (w/w) HCl according to the biomass were added into the autoclave system. Experiments in the closed system were carried out under autogenous pressures at different temperatures (200, 240 and 280 °C) and at different reaction times (1, 3 and 6 h) by mixing at a stirring speed of 500 rpm. Thus, the effects of reaction temperatures and reaction times on sphere formation were investigated. The obtained samples were washed repeatedly with plenty of distilled water using a vacuum motor, then passed through ethyl alcohol and dried at 80 °C for 6 h [17]."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization RH and carbon sphere samples were characterized using BET surface area, SEM, FTIR-ATR, DTA/TG and XRD analysis. Hydrogen storage capacity of carbon sphere samples was also determined. BET surface area measurements and pore size distributions of RH and carbon sphere samples were determined by Quantachrome Nova 2200e series BET surface area analyzer at 77 K using N2 as the sorbate. Before BET surface area and pore size distribution analysis, RH was degassed at 110 °C and carbon sphere samples at 200 °C for 24 h. The surface of the samples was coated with Au-Pd for 60 s under a current of 20 mA before SEM analysis of the RH and carbon spheres. The morphology of the samples was characterized at different magnification ratios using ZEISS EVO LS 10 scanning electron microscope. FTIR-ATR analyzes of RH and carbon sphere samples were performed with PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrophotometer in the transmition mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–650 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples was carried out using PerkinElmer Diamond simultaneous DT/TGA with temperature increases of 20 °C per min in the temperature range of 25–1200 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. XRD analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples was carried out with Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at room temperature at 2° per min scanning rate at 30 mA and 40 kV between 5 and 80°. Hydrogen storage capacity of carbon sphere samples was measured with Hiden IMI PSI gas storage device. Hydrogen storage capacities of the samples were determined at cryogenic temperature (-196 °C) and high pressures. The samples were degassed at 200 °C for 24 h before the hydrogen storage capacity was determined."
5,Result and Discussion,
6,Surface area measurements and pore size distributions,"3.1 Surface area measurements and pore size distributions BET surface area values and pore size distributions of the carbon sphere samples obtained from RH with hydrothermal carbonization method at different temperatures and reaction times were determined. Table 1 lists the surface areas and micropore volumes of the carbon spheres. Surface areas of carbon sphere samples were calculated according to the BET equation from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. Pore size distributions of carbon sphere samples were calculated with Density Functional Theory (DFT) method, micropore volumes by Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) method and mesopore volumes by (VDFT-Vmicro) equation [14]. In the table, dDR, micropore diameter was calculated by Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) method and dBJH, refers to the mesopore diameter calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method [18]. When Table 1 is examined, it is seen that the surface area values of the samples obtained at different reaction temperatures and times in acidic reaction medium containing HCl are quite close to each other. When the samples obtained at different reaction temperatures (200 °C, 240 °C, 280 °C) were compared, it was concluded that the BET surface area values of the samples increased with the increasing reaction temperature compared to the untreated RH. It is seen that the BET surface area values of the samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization performed at 280 °C during 1 h and 6 h increased from 46 m2/g to 92 m2/g with increasing reaction time. With the increasing reaction time, the total pore volumes of these samples increased from 0.12 cc/g to 0.18 cc/g and the mesopore volumes from 0.10 cc/g to 0.16 cc/g, no increase was observed in the micropore volumes determined by the DR method. This slight increase trend in surface areas as the reaction time increases can be attributed to the surface roughness that occurs due to the transformation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the structure of lignocellulosic biomass because the micropore volume remains essentially the same [19]. However, a significant increase in surface areas and pore volumes of the samples is not observed with the increase in temperature. The reason why this increase is not significant may be the presence of volatile substances that migrate to the hydrocarbon surface at any temperature during the hydrothermal carbonization process, from the liquid phase to the liquid phase or to organic compounds [20]. In general, no significant increase was observed in the micropore volumes of the expected sphere formation at different reaction temperatures and times. The reason for this situation can be attributed to the surface roughness caused by the incomplete conversion of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin to simple carbohydrate derivatives, which are in the structure of lignocellulosic biomass due to low temperature [21]."
7,SEM analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples,"3.2 SEM analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples The images of the SEM analysis performed to investigate the surface morphology of RH and carbon sphere samples prepared under various conditions were given in Fig. 1 .a-f. The physical properties and surface morphology of samples obtained under different hydrothermal carbonization conditions can be examined with SEM micrographs [22]. In the literature, glucose, xylose, maltose, sucrose, amylopectin, starch [23], cellulose [21], methyl cellulose [24], hemicellulose in Cannabis sativa L. plant [25], rye straw [26] and corn stalk [27] were obtained by hydrothermal carbonization method and it has been shown that different sizes of carbon spheres can be produced from carbohydrate derivative materials with this method. Lignocellulosic biomass, which has cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in its structure, is the most abundant renewable energy source in the world and it is important to use it as a starting material in carbon sphere production by hydrothermal carbonization method. It is known from the literature that hydrothermal carbonization method can produce carbon spheres in different sizes from carbohydrate-derived materials. Depending on the type of starting material, hydrochar products are obtained when the product obtained is not a carbon sphere. Carbon sphere synthesis was carried out by hydrothermal carbonization method based on RH having grain size of 100–500 μm. In hydrothermal carbonization method, the experimental conditions were kept constant and the experiments were carried out in 1/1 (w/w) HCl medium at 200, 240 and 280 °C and at different reaction times of 1, 3 and 6 h. The effects of reaction temperature and reaction time on sphere formation were investigated. When the SEM images of the samples obtained from the experiments were examined, it was stated that the temperature increase was directly proportional to the sphere yield. It is also evident from SEM photographs that more efficient and more homogeneous spheres can be obtained as time increases. Spheres with spherical morphology could not be obtained in the reactions taking place at 200 °C. This can be explained by the insufficient temperature to decompose the lignocellulosic biomass of RH to cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [28]. It can be said that carbon sphere formation starts with reactions that take place at 240 °C. However, it is seen that the obtained carbon spheres are irregular and some carbon spheres are agglomerated. In the literature, Falco et al. (2011) subjected rye straw to hydrothermal carbonization process in aqueous environment and at 240 °C. Carbon sphere formation on the surface of rye straw, which is a lignocellulosic biomass at this temperature, was observed with SEM images, but the transformation of the structure to carbon sphere is insufficient [26]. When the images obtained in this study for the same temperature value are compared with the literature, it can be said that carbon sphere formation occurs more effectively. This suggests that by adding HCl as a catalyst to the reaction medium, the structure of lignocellulosic biomass is more easily decomposed into oligomers and monomers and transformed into a carbon sphere. When the SEM photographs of the products obtained from hydrothermal carbonization process at 280 °C are examined, it is seen that the density of carbon spheres increases as the reaction time increases. It is clear that the spheres obtained in particular for 6 h have excellent spherical morphology which is homogeneous and smooth. In addition, the average diameter of the obtained samples was determined as approximately 1–4 μm. To summarize the SEM photographs, it can be said that the temperature required to obtain homogeneous carbon spheres from the RH is 280 °C and the required reaction time is 6 h. In addition, the effect of temperature as well as pressure on carbon sphere production affects sphere formation. In the reactor where the hydrothermal carbonization took place, the self-generated pressures at 200, 240 and 280 °C were 15, 35 and 55 bar, respectively. In other words, more successful spheres were obtained in acid catalyzed trials in cases where pressure increased. This result is consistent with the literature [29–31]. Because when the cellulose in the structure of lignocellulosic biomass is subjected to pressure, chemical transformations are more effective."
8,FTIR analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples,"3.3 FTIR analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples The FTIR-ATR spectra of the samples obtained from the experiments carried out for 1, 3 and 6 h at 200, 240 and 280 °C for the optimization of reaction temperature and reaction time in hydrothermal carbonization of RH were given in Fig. 2 a and b. The FTIR spectra of RH used as the starting material and the carbon spheres obtained by the hydrothermal carbonization method were shown comparatively. The FTIR spectrum of the RH in the range of 4000–650 cm−1 shows two distinct bands around 3300 and 1020 cm−1. The broad band around 3300 cm−1 can be attributed to –OH tensile vibrations of hydroxyl functional groups of the hydrogen bonds in the structure of the starting material containing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [32]. In addition, the band at ∼ 2925 cm−1 belongs to the C-H stretching of the aliphatic carbon. The band obtained at ∼ 1640 cm−1 may be dependent on the carbonyl C-O strain frequencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Multiple bands at the 1515–1455 cm−1 band can be attributed to C = C vibrations in the aromatic group. The strong band around ∼ 1030 cm−1 corresponds to the C-O tensile vibrations of bonds in the ether, phenol and alcohol groups and CH-OH groups. Finally, the band around ∼ 800 cm−1 is attributed to the vibrations of the C-H groups in the aromatic ring [33–35]. When carbon sphere is obtained from RH, three distinct changes in the structure of the carbon sphere are expected. The first is that the band densities of carboxyl or hydroxyl groups corresponding to 3600–3000 cm−1 and > CH-OH stress vibrations observed at ∼ 1030 cm−1 are weakened by the effect of dehydration reactions during sphere formation [36]. The second is that C = C multiple bands observed in the 1600–1450 cm−1 wavenumber range confirm the aromatic structure formed by the transformation of the structure into a carbon sphere. Third, bands corresponding to 875–750 cm−1 are attributed to aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations [37]. Based on this situation, in the FTIR spectrum of the samples obtained in acidic reaction medium containing HCl, the decrease in the intensity of O-H stress vibrations, aliphatic C-H stress vibrations and C-O stress vibrations is observed due to the increasing reaction temperature and reaction time. In addition, when the FTIR spectra of the samples are examined, it is seen that the structure for each sample changes compared to the untreated RH. When hydrothermal carbonization takes place in the presence of any agent, the two weak bands in the region attributed to the stress vibrations of the aromatic ring, namely at 1520–1450 cm−1, show some differences [38]. This situation can be explained by the dissolution of lignocellulosic components in the structure of RH under the effect of HCl and the start of carbon sphere formation by decomposing into subunits. The FTIR-ATR spectrum of the sample obtained at 200 °C and 3 h reaction time is given in Fig. 2.a. The bands observed at ∼ 2980 and 2910 cm−1 are due to the aliphatic C-H stretching and these bands are due to the presence of aliphatic structures created by the breakdown of polymeric materials. In other words, this situation suggests that the components of lignocellulosic biomass are degraded with the addition of acid, but the temperature is insufficient for the aliphatic structures to be exposed to aromatization. In the literature, it has been stated that hemicellulose in the structure of RH degrades approximately 180–200 °C, cellulose over 200–230 °C and lignin partially above 260 °C [22,28,39]. When the FTIR-ATR spectrum of the samples obtained at 240 °C and 3 h reaction time is examined, the intensity of the bands corresponding to the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups at 3600–3000 cm−1 decreased due to the dehydration reactions that occur as the reaction temperature increases due to the removal of oxygen in the structure. Dehydration reactions take place during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into carbon sphere. It is understood that the density of the bands attributed to aliphatic C-H stretching at ∼ 2920 and 2840 cm−1 decreases as the temperature increases, and the products with aromatic structure have begun to be obtained with hydrothermal carbonization at 240 °C for 3 h. Bands corresponding to C = O groups at ∼ 1720 cm−1 and C = C groups at ∼ 1630 cm−1 and 1512 cm−1 reveal the aromatization of the samples. At the same time, the density of the aromatic C-H band around 790 cm−1 reveals an increase in the aromatization of the samples [36,40]. FTIR-ATR spectra of samples obtained at 280 °C and different reaction times (1 h, 3 h, 6 h) in the acidic reaction medium formed by adding 1/1 HCl by mass are given in Fig. 2.b. The broad band observed at 3600–3000 cm−1 generally corresponds to O-H stretching vibrations of carboxylic acids, phenols, alcohols or adsorbed water molecules. The decrease in the density of this band supports the formation of carbon spheres with dehydration reactions. Compared to the FTIR spectra of the samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization at 200 °C and 240 °C in the same reaction environment, the intensity of the expected aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations at approximately 2920 and 2850 cm−1 is quite low. It suggests that the aliphatic structure of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which are separated into their monomers with the addition of acid, at 280 °C temperature completely transforms into carbon sphere by aromatization. SEM images also confirm the homogeneous spherical structure occurring at this temperature. C = O band belonging to carboxylic and lactonic groups is observed around 1700 cm−1. Similarly, the band observed around ∼ 1630 cm−1 and 1520 cm−1 is attributed to the C = C double bonds of the aromatic and furanic rings. Finally, the band around 800–790 cm−1 denotes the C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations in the aromatic group. As the reaction time increases at 280 °C, the density of this band increases, proving the presence of the aromatic structure formed [21,36,41,42]. Because, it has been proved by SEM images that more efficient carbon spheres are obtained depending on the reaction temperature and reaction time with the hydrothermal carbonization method from RH. FTIR spectra of carbon spheres obtained at this temperature are similar to those of carbon spheres obtained from glucose and cellulose in the literature [21,36]."
9,XRD analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples,"3.4 XRD analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples Approximately 30% of the RH is released during processing after the production of the rice plant. Approximately 10% of the exposed RH is a thin membrane covering the rice; about 20% of the rice grains are harder than the bran found in the outside of the husk, also known as a hatch. Silica and carbon are present in the structure and silica is the skeleton of the shell, so the RH is amorphous [43]. When the XRD pattern of the raw RH in the figure is examined (Fig. 3 ), it is seen that the peaks are severe at 2θ = 25.8° and 2θ = 31.9°, and weaker peaks at 2θ = 28.3°, 2θ = 32.0° and 2θ = 32.6°. The peak at 2θ = 25.8° can be attributed to the characteristic large peak of silica. In addition, the XRD pattern shows that the carbon skeleton that forms the RH is amorphous structure [44]. When the XRD patterns of carbon sphere samples (Fig. 3) obtained by hydrothermal carbonization method at different temperatures and times are examined, it is understood that the samples generally do not show any crystal structure. As it is understood from the SEM images in the experiment carried out to obtain carbon spheres at 200 °C, temperature is thought to be insufficient for degradation of lignocellulosic components. When the XRD pattern of this sample is examined, it is seen that is different than the other samples obtained and a broad peak is observed at approximately 2θ = 25° corresponding to the plane (002) [45]. No reflection was observed in the XRD patterns of the samples obtained at 240 °C and 280 °C, indicating that the samples were not crystalline and they are amorphous. This confirms that the crystal structure of the RH, has disappeared by hydrothermal carbonization process at appropriate temperatures and is similar to the results obtained in the literature for the carbon sphere production [21]. When the XRD patterns of the carbon spheres performed with a reaction time of 3 h at 240 °C and reaction times of 1 h, 3 h and 6 h at 280 °C are evaluated together, the crystalline structure of the RH, in all samples. No characteristic peak was observed. This result is confirmed by the effect of hydrothermal carbonization on the microcrystalline structure of cellulose. Increasing the temperature to 240 °C and 280 °C caused the destruction of the microcrystalline structure. These observations show that a temperature of 240 °C is required for the decomposition of the microcrystalline structure. Because it is known from the literature that the onset of hydrothermal reactions for cellulose takes place around 220 °C. Sevilla and Fuertes (2009) observed that the sample obtained by hydrothermal processing of cellulose at 210 °C displays an XRD pattern similar to pure cellulose, showing that the microcrystalline structure of cellulose is preserved. On the contrary, there is no reflection of the crystalline structure in the XRD model of the sample obtained at 220 °C. These results show that the onset of hydrothermal carbonization takes place around 220 °C. In addition, according to XRD results, they stated that the temperature required for the onset of hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose was considerably higher than glucose, sucrose or starch (160–170 °C) [21]. Kang et al. (2012) exposed cellulose, lignin, xylose and wood dust samples to hydrothermal carbonization at 225 °C, 245 °C and 265 °C for 20 h in aqueous environment. When the XRD patterns of the samples obtained at 245 °C are examined, while cellulose products show a completely amorphous structure at this temperature, a wide peak is observed in the range 2θ = 10-30° for samples obtained from lignin, xylose and wood dust [46]."
10,TG analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples,"3.5 TG analysis of RH and carbon sphere samples Thermal gravimetric analyzes were performed to determine the thermal properties of carbon sphere samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization of RH. TG thermograms obtained as a result of these analyzes were given in Fig. 4 a and b. In addition, the data obtained from these curves were presented in Table 2 . The Tx values given in the table represent the temperature values where the mass loss of × % occurs and the residual % is the amount of substance remaining at 1200 °C at the end of the analysis. Thermal analysis of raw RH used as starting material to obtain carbon sphere provides information about decomposition behaviors depending on temperature. Thermal behavior of biomass depends on the chemical composition, chemical bond structure and the catalytic effect of the ash/inorganic substances in its structure. Due to the thermal decomposition of RH under nitrogen atmosphere, mass loss occurred in 2 steps. In the first step, water or moisture in the structure in the temperature range of 50–100 °C was removed and 2.5% mass loss occurred. The obtained TG curves show that the second decay occurs in the range of 275–410 °C. In these temperature ranges where maximum degradation takes place, it is seen that the mass of the starting material is reduced by an average of 65%. This reduction in the mass of plant material is attributed to the degradation of the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin structures in the structure of the RH in these temperature ranges and thus the removal of volatile components and gas products from the structure during degradation [47,48]. When the degradation curves of the products obtained at different temperatures and reaction times with the addition of 1/1 (w/w) HCl by using RH as the starting material are examined the structure of the carbon spheres appears to differ from the starting material and degradable in four steps. The mass loss in the first decomposition step below 100 °C corresponds to the removal of the moisture water in the structure. The second decomposition step in the range of 400–550 °C can be attributed to the evaporation of the organic material in the structure and the decomposition of the typical cellulose [49]. When the mass losses in this step are examined, it is seen that the highest mass loss belongs to RH-200 °C-3 h sample with 25.8 wt%, and the least mass loss belongs to RH-280 °C-6 h sample with 17.9 wt%. In addition, when the mass losses occurring in this step are matched with SEM images, it is understood that in this example, which shows a homogeneous sphere structure, less degradation occurs in this step that belongs to cellulose. In other words, as the temperature and reaction time increase, the lignocellulosic structure of the starting material is degraded and the cellolose content decreases and the sphere is achieved more successfully. In addition, when the residual amounts at 1200 °C are analyzed, it is understood that the remaining amount of RH-280 °C-6 h sample is 70.7 wt% and it is the most thermally stable product. When the remaining amounts of residue determined from TG thermograms are examined, it is seen that the thermal stability of the spheres increases with increasing reaction temperature and increasing reaction time. It is possible to say that volatile matter content at low temperatures and higher constant carbon content at high temperatures are possible factors affecting thermal stability [46]."
11,Hydrogen uptake measurement of carbon sphere samples,"3.6 Hydrogen uptake measurement of carbon sphere samples Fig. 5 a and b graph the wt.% hydrogen storage data of the samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization at different temperatures for 3 h and the samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization at different times at 280 °C, respectively. The hydrogen storage capacities of the carbon spheres were determined in the pressure range of 0–35 bar at cryogenic temperature. For the carbon spheres obtained at different temperatures, the hydrogen storage capacities of RH-200 °C-3 h, RH-240 °C-3 h and RH-280 °C-3 h samples were 0.39 wt%, 0.10 wt% and 0.70 wt% at 30 bar, respectively. These results show that there is no significant sequencing in the hydrogen storage capacities of carbon spheres. For carbon spheres obtained at different reaction times, the hydrogen storage capacities of RH-280 °C-1 h, RH-280 °C-3 h and RH-280 °C-6 h samples were 0.62 wt%, 0.70 wt% and 1.1 wt% at 30 bar respectively. As can be seen from SEM images, RH-280 °C-6 h sample, which shows the most ideal spherical structure, has the highest hydrogen storage capacity. With the increased reaction time, there is a significant relationship between the formation of the spherical structure from the lignocellulosic biomass and the hydrogen storage capacities. The adsorption isotherms RH-200 °C-3 h and RH-240 °C-3 h samples increase as the pressure increases and then decrease. This situation can be explained in two ways. Firstly, with increasing pressure, the hydrogen storage capacities of these two samples have decreased somewhat, and in the literature this is explained by the term “excessive adsorption capacity”. This phenomenon occurs when excessive gas is filled into the pores of the materials, but the density of the outer gas is still increased. Excess adsorption capacity is thus defined as the difference in the amount of gas stored at a given temperature and pressure. As a result, hydrogen storage capacity decreases at high pressures due to the increase in hydrogen density in the pores of the materials [50]. Secondly, the reason for this decrease can be explained by the fact that the samples do not turn into carbon spheres due to the insufficient temperature and the carbon derivative structure decays with increasing pressure. It is confirmed by SEM images that these samples do not turn into carbon spheres. Since these two samples have neither an excellent porous structure such as activated carbon nor an ideal structure like a carbon sphere, it is thought that the structure is adversely affected by pressure, and the structure tends to decrease hydrogen adsorption by decaying on a certain pressure value. There are many studies in the literature on the storage of hydrogen in solid form in carbon-structured materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotube, and carbon nanofiber [51]. Hydrogen can be stored in these materials through physisorption and/or chemisorption. Adsorption of hydrogen in carbon derivative materials occurs depending on the surface area or pore size (micropore (<2 nm), mesopore (2‐50 nm), macropore (>50 nm)). In the literature, hydrogen storage capacities of carbon-derived materials such as carbon nanotube, fullerene and activated carbon are generally associated with increased BET surface area and especially micropore volumes [52], and the hydrogen storage capacities of these materials are expected to comply with the Chahine rule. The Chahine rule assumes that the maximum amount of hydrogen a material will store at 77 K is related to the BET surface area, and that the hydrogen storage capacity is 1% by weight for every 500 m2/g BET surface area [53,54]. This rule is compatible with many porous materials, mainly graphene, but has also deviated in some cases in the literature. The increasing BET surface area values and hydrogen storage capacities of carbon sphere samples obtained by hydrothermal carbonization method from 100 to 500 μm RH vary in parallel with each other. However, since the BET surface area values of the obtained carbon spheres are not very high, it is not meaningful to explain the percent hydrogen storage capacity by correlating the surface area values. When the BET surface area and pore size distribution results of the samples obtained are compared, it is seen that the hydrogen storage capacities obtained at 30 bar are related to the mesopore volume. Therefore, it can be said that the hydrogen storage capacities of the carbon spheres obtained from lignocellulosic biomass in this study deviated from the Chahine rule. If the material used as hydrogen storage material contains more mesopores than micropores, it is also stated in the literature that hydrogen can be stored in mesopores [55,56]. When the findings of the hydrogen storage capacities of carbon spheres obtained by hydrothermal carbonization method from RH are evaluated together, it is possible to say that hydrogen adsorbed in metal hydrides by chemisorption process is physically stored by hydroxyl groups in the mesopores, inner surfaces and outer surfaces of the carbon spheres [52]. There are many different studies in the literature describing how hydrogen is stored in carbon-derived materials. Agarwal et al. (1987) concluded that although the specific surface areas of carbon-derived materials did not increase with surface modifications, the hydrogen storage capacity of the materials increased [57]. Noh et al. (1987) revealed that surface modification by oxygen treatment did not affect the specific surface areas of activated carbons, but increased surface acidity enhanced the hydrogen storage capacity [58]. Nijkamp et al. (2001) investigated the hydrogen storage capacities of different materials such as zeolite and activated carbon and reported that hydrogen can be stored in microporous structures by physisorption [59]. Poirier et al. (2004) stated that the hydrogen storage capacity of single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) exceeds the maximum storage capacity of activated carbons with large surface areas and that hydrogen adsorption is linear with the surface areas of carbon-derived materials [53]. Panella et al. (2005) reported that hydrogen adsorption increased linearly with specific surface area, regardless of operating temperature and carbon material type [60]. Su et al. (2007) investigated the changes in hydrogen storage capacities as a result of surface modification of activated carbons obtained from biomass and explained these changes in hydrogen storage capacity by changes in the specific surface area, pore size distribution and surface chemistry of activated carbons. They also stated that the specific surface area of activated carbons is a dominant factor for hydrogen adsorption, regardless of the treatment [61]. Li et al. (2007) stated that the adsorption of hydrogen in carbon-derived materials occurs by two different mechanisms. According to the first mechanism, hydrogen molecules are adsorbed on the surface of carbon-derived materials; according to the second mechanism, they suggested that hydrogen molecules penetrate into the interlayer space of carbon-derived materials [62]. When the literature is examined in general, it is seen that the hydrogen storage capacity in carbon-derived materials is associated with the specific surface area and micropore volume, and there are many studies in this area with activated carbon and carbon nanotubes. However, there is no study on the storage of hydrogen in carbon spheres obtained from biomass. Obtaining carbon spheres from RH by hydrothermal carbonization method is a very economical and one-step process compared to carbon-derived materials. Because the production of activated carbon is a long process, and the production of carbon nanotubes requires high costs. On the other hand, when the starting materials and methods used to obtain the carbon spheres given in Table 3 are compared, it can be said that this method is more environmentally friendly than other methods, since the reaction proceeds in a closed system and at low temperatures in this study [21]. When all these are evaluated, it is very important to examine the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon spheres obtained from RH by hydrothermal carbonization method in order to obtain carbon-derived materials for the safe storage of hydrogen in solid materials, to determine the hydrogen storage capacity, and to contribute to the intensive studies on the mechanism of hydrogen adsorption. The findings of this study are important in order to guide the literature."
12,Isotherm analysis of carbon sphere samples,"3.7 Isotherm analysis of carbon sphere samples It is very important to understand the adsorption mechanism which experimental data obtained in solid surface gas adsorption studies are compatible with which adsorption isotherm. [63]. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms related to adsorption equilibrium are equations used to describe events. Langmuir isotherm assumes that the solid adsorbent surface is exactly the same, the adsorption occurs on the adsorbent in a single layer, and it is homogeneous in the energy distribution on the adsorbent surface [64]. Langmuir isotherm can be formalized as follows: P/n = 1/n0 b + P/n0 (1) In this equation, P is pressure, n is the amount adsorbed in mmol, n0 is saturated adsorption capacity and b refers to the adsorption coefficient of the Lagmuir isotherm [64–66]. Freunlich isotherm describes multilayered reversible heterogeneous adsorption. It states that adsorption heat and affinity are not equivalent on heterogeneous surfaces [67]. The Freundlich isotherm equation can be specified as follows: Ln(n) = lnKF + 1/mlnP (2) where P is pressure, n is the amount adsorbed in mmol, KF is Frundlich constant and m is a constant. When the Langmuir equation is arranged to study gas adsorption on the solid surface, the P/n is plotted against P. Saturated H2 adsorption value expressed as n0 can be calculated from this graph. Similarly, when the equation for Freundlich isotherm is arranged, Freundlich constants can be calculated by graphing ln(n) against lnP. The data obtained were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms to understand how hydrogen was stored in carbon spheres and to determine the adsorption characteristics. The data obtained from the isotherms (figures not shown) were summarized in Table 4 . The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms of the samples were created up to the pressure values at which maximum hydrogen adsorption occurred and the corresponding values were calculated for this pressure range. From the carbon sphere samples obtained from 100 to 500 μm RH at different temperatures by keeping the reaction time constant; maximum hydrogen storage capacity for RH-200 °C-3 h sample was 0.43 wt% at 19.1 bar, maximum hydrogen storage capacity for RH-240 °C-3 h sample was 0.20 wt% at 13.7 bar and maximum hydrogen storage capacity for RH-280 °C-3 h sample was determined as 0.70% by weight at 29.6 bar. From carbon sphere samples obtained at 280 °C and different reaction times, maximum hydrogen storage capacity for RH-280 °C-1 h sample was 0.62 wt% at 30.4 bar and maximum hydrogen storage capacity for RH-280 °C-6 h sample measured at 1.1% by weight at 29.4 bar. When the isotherm models of samples obtained at different reaction temperatures and times are examined, considering only the regression coefficients, it is possible to say that the adsorption process, which varies according to the sample type under cryogenic conditions, is compatible with the Langmuir isotherm for some samples and the Freundlich isotherm for some samples. It is seen that the R2 values of all samples are very close to each other and to 1 for two isotherm models. However, when n0 and nF values expressing the maximum hydrogen adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir and Freundlich equations are compared with the experimentally stored maximum hydrogen capacities (n0(exp)), it shows that the adsorption process for carbon microspheres is compatible with the Langmuir isotherm. For example, for RH-280 °C-6 h carbon sphere sample, while the experimentally determined hydrogen storage capacity in Table 4 was 0.197 mmol, the value calculated from the Langmuir isotherm is 0.217 mmol and the value calculated from the Freundlich isotherm is 1.478 mmol. Accordingly, it is clear that hydrogen adsorption conforms to the Langmuir isotherm. The critical temperature of hydrogen is 32.98 K [54] and it is known from the literature that hydrogen molecules are generally physically adsorbed to the solid adsorbent surface at the critical temperature. The fact that the experimental data of hydrogen adsorption of carbon sphere samples carried out at 77 K in this study are compatible with the Langmuir model indicates that the active sites for hydrogen adsorption in carbon spheres are homogeneously distributed and adsorption is limited to a single layer."
13,Conclusion,"In this study, it was investigated how the structure and composition of the starting material used in the hydrothermal carbonization process and the experimental factors such as temperature, reaction time and reaction environment affect the size, shape and surface morphology of the obtained product. The carbon sphere yield increased with HCl added to the reaction medium. Especially in acidic environment, carbon sphere yield increased with increasing temperature and reaction time. When the BET surface area and pore size distribution results of the samples were examined, it was seen that the carbon spheres contained both micro and mesopores. Although the surface area values of the samples obtained at different temperatures and reaction times increase linearly with temperature, it can be said that the main difference is in the mesopore structure of the carbon spheres. While the micropore volumes determined by the DR method of the samples did not change with the increasing reaction temperature and time, it was observed that the mesopore volumes increased. The mesopore volume of the carbon sphere, which is prepared in an acidic environment at a temperature of 280 °C and in 6 h, is the highest. FTIR-ATR spectra and XRD patterns confirmed carbon sphere formation and the necessary conditions for this synthesis were 280 °C and 6 h. Sphere morphology of the synthesized samples was confirmed by SEM images, and the resulting images were compatible with FTIR-ATR and XRD analyses. SEM images showed that 85–95% more carbon spheres were formed for the RH-280 °C-6 h sample and TGA thermograms that as the reaction temperature and reaction time increased, the amount of residue was more and the carbon spheres were more thermally stable. Hydrogen storage capacities were measured to determine the usability in the energy field of carbon spheres obtained under different reaction conditions. The hydrogen storage capacity of the carbon sphere synthesized at 280 °C for 6 h was the highest and was measured as 1.1 wt% at 77 K and 30 bar. When the hydrogen storage capacities of the samples were evaluated together with the BET surface area and pore size distribution results, it was seen that the hydrogen storage capacities of the carbon spheres were directly proportional to the mesopore volumes. In addition, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms related to the adsorption equilibrium were investigated in order to better define H2 adsorption in these samples. Considering the regression coefficients of the obtained isotherms and saturated adsorption capacities, they were determined that most of the samples were compatible with the Langmuir isotherm, and the RH-280 °C-6 h sample with the most ideal spherical structure was compatible with the Freundlich isotherm."
