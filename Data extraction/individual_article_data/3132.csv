0,Introduction,"One of the main challenges for scientists today is to reduce the dependence from fossil fuels. But how can we meet the ever growing world energy demand in a clean and sustainable way? Renewables can be the answer. Hydrogen is the ideal candidate to solve environmental problems. It could be used for generation of electricity in fuel cells and as fuel for transportation, virtually without CO2 emissions, being water the only oxidation product [1]. Hydrogen has great advantages as compared with fossil fuels, because it is a good transportation fuel, has the highest utilization efficiency and can be converted to useful energy forms through several processes [2]. Nowadays 47% of global hydrogen is produced from natural gas, 30% from oil, 19% from coal and the remaining fraction via water electrolysis [3]. Therefore about 96% of hydrogen derives from the conversion of fossil resources, which means the co-production of CO2. New sources and new processes are necessary to produce hydrogen in a sustainable way. The steam reforming of biofuels is an attracting topic for researchers. Ethanol emerged as a good candidate for hydrogen production because it is a renewable source and the CO2 produced in the steam reforming process is consumed by biomass during its growth [4]. Moreover ethanol is easy to store, handle and transport because of its low volatility and atoxicity [5]. Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) is an endothermic reaction ( Δ H 298 0 = + 347.4 KJ mol − 1 ) that leads to the formation of H2 and CO2 according to the stoichiometric reaction, Eq. (1): (1) CH 3 CH 2 OH + 3 H 2 O ⇌ 6 H 2 + 2 CO 2 including the water-gas shift of the intermediate CO ( Δ H 298 0 = − 41 KJ / mol ), which further increases the hydrogen yield (Eq. (2)): (2) CO + H 2 O ⇌ CO 2 + H 2 However the overall process is quite complex and several side reactions can take place, such as ethanol dehydrogenation (CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + H2), dehydration (CH3CH2OH → C2H4 + H2O) and decomposition (CH3CH2OH → CH4 + CO + H2), leading to the formation of acetaldehyde, ethylene and methane respectively. These by-products compete for hydrogen atoms, thus lowering the overall H2 yield [6,7]. It is well known that both the active phase and the support play a key role in determining the productivity and selectivity of the reaction, because different catalysts induce different pathways for H2 production [5,8,9]. Several metal-based catalysts [4,10–12] have been proposed for the steam reforming of alcohols. Nickel is particularly attractive because of its high activity and selectivity in breaking C–C bonds and its lower cost if compared with noble metals; it also catalyses the water-gas shift reaction in order to remove adsorbed CO from the surface and the gas phase [13–15], improving H2 yield and its purification. However, some challenges related to metal sintering and coke deposition are still open; therefore the choice of the support is crucial. The synergism between the support and the metal is fundamental in order to stabilize the active phase and decrease the rate of coke formation [16,17]. TiO2 is used for its well-known ability to interact with metals [18]. The so-called strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect, firstly introduced by Tauster et al. [19] and observed for group VIII metals over reducible support materials, deeply affects the properties of a catalyst [20–23]. In our case, strong metal-support interaction proved of outstanding importance in the case of zirconia- and silica-supported Ni samples for steam reforming reactions. Indeed, higher Ni dispersion and stronger interaction of the metal with the support allowed to improve carbon balance during testing at low temperature, i.e. decreased catalyst coking [24,25]. By contrast, as for a TiO2-based sample, we found that the catalyst showed negligible activity because of Ni incorporation in the anatase lattice [26]. We concluded that this could be due to the preparation method, in which the active phase was added to an uncalcined support. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of the synthesis parameters (i.e. Ni addition on Ti(OH)4 or TiO2; ii. calcination temperature) on the properties of the catalyst, in particular on the Ni-support interaction, and on their activity. The samples were used as catalysts for the ESR reaction for hydrogen production. The reaction was carried out at relatively low temperature, i.e. 500 °C, in order to limit the energy input to the process."
1,Experimental section,
2,Catalysts preparation,"2.1 Catalysts preparation Ti(OH)4 was prepared by a conventional precipitation method [26]. Part of the titanium hydroxide was calcined at 500 or 800 °C. The active phase was added to the support through the incipient wetness impregnation technique using Ni(NO3)2∗6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, purity ≥98.5%), in the proper concentration in order to obtain a 8 wt% Ni loading. Four different samples were synthesized. Two samples were prepared by adding Ni on the Ti(OH)4 support (TH) and calcining at 500 °C (THNi500) or 800 °C (THNi800) for 4 h. The two other samples were prepared by adding Ni on the TiO2 support (TOx) and calcining at 500 °C (TOxNi500) or 800 °C (TOxNi800) for 4 h."
3,Catalysts characterization,"2.2 Catalysts characterization Specific surface area and pores size distribution were evaluated through N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C (MICROMERITICS, ASAP 2000 Analyser). Surface area was calculated on the basis of the BET equation [27], whereas the pores size distribution was determined by the BJH method, applied to the N2 desorption branch of the isotherm [28]. Prior to the analyses the samples were reduced in H2 flow for 1 h at 500 °C (THNi500 and TOxNi500) or 800 °C (THNi800 and TOxNi800), dried overnight at 110 °C and then outgassed in vacuum at 110 °C for 2 h. For the samples with low surface area a lab-made equipment for single point analysis has been used [29]. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out by placing the catalyst in a quartz reactor and heating in a 5% H2/Ar mixed gas stream flowing at 40 mL/min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 800 °C. H2 consumption was monitored with a TCD detector. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Si(Li) solid state detector (SOL-X) and a sealed tube providing Cu Kα radiation. The quantitative phase analysis and crystal size determination of the support and metal phases in the samples where obtained by the Rietveld refinement method as implemented in the Bruker TOPAS program. Also in this case, the samples were reduced in H2 flow for 1 h at 500 °C (THNi500 and TOxNi500) or 800 °C (THNi800 and TOxNi800) before the analysis."
4,Catalytic tests: ethanol steam reforming,"2.3 Catalytic tests: ethanol steam reforming Activity tests were performed by means of a micropilot plant constituted by an Incoloy 800 continuous downflow reactor (i.d. 0.9 cm, length 40 cm), heated by an electric oven. The reactor temperature was controlled by an Eurotherm 3204 TIC. The reactor may be fed both with liquid and gaseous reactants and at the reactor outlet there is a trap for the collection of possible liquid products and a gas sampling point. The catalysts were pressed, ground and sieved into 0.15–0.25 mm particles and ca. 0.5 g were loaded into the reactor after dilution 1:3 (vol/vol) with SiC of the same particle size. Catalyst activation was accomplished by feeding 50 cm3/min of a 20 vol% H2/N2 gas mixture, while heating by 10 °C/min up to 500 °C (THNi500 and TOxNi500) or 800 °C (THNi800 and TOxNi800), then kept for 1 h. During activity testing 0.017 cm3/min of a 3:1 (mol/mol) H2O:CH3CH2OH liquid mixture were fed to the reactor by means of a Hitachi, mod. L7100, HPLC pump, added with 56 cm3/min of N2, used as internal standard, and 174 cm3/min of He. Such dilution of the feed stream was calibrated so to keep the reactants mixture in the vapour phase even at zero conversion at the reactor outlet. No liquid phase was ever detected at reactor outlet. The activity tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure, GHSV = 2500 h−1 (referred to the ethanol + water gaseous mixture) at 500 °C. The analysis of the out-flowing gas was carried out by a gaschromatograph (Agilent, mod. 7980) equipped with two columns connected in series (MS and Poraplot Q) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), properly calibrated for the detection of ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, water, ethylene, CO, CO2, H2. Material balance on C-containing products was checked to quantify coke deposition. Repeated analyses of the effluent gas were carried out every hour and the whole duration of every test at each temperature was ca. 8 h. The raw data, expressed as mol/min of each species outflowing from the reactor, have been elaborated as follows. Products distribution [30]: Y i = mol i/∑(mol i) C balance : 100 − ( ( ( mol CH 3 CH 2 OH∗ 2 ) in − ∑ ( mol C i ∗χ i ) out ) / ( mol CH 3 CH 2 OH∗ 2 ) in ) ∗ 100 Conversion :X i = ( mol i in − mol i out ) / mol i in i = H 2 O,CH 3 CH 2 OH Selectivity :S i = ( mol i / v i ) / ( mol ethanol in − mol ethanol out ) H 2 productivity : mol H 2 out / min kg cat where i = products detected, dry basis; χ i = number of C atoms in the i-th molecule; v i = stoichiometric coefficient of species i in the ESR reaction."
5,Results and discussion,"We recently reported that a Ni/TiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnating the non-calcined support was almost completely inactive in glycerol steam reforming [26]. We supposed that all nickel was incorporated in the anatase lattice. This hypothesis is in agreement with previous reports [31]. Two different substitution mechanisms have been suggested to explain the incorporation of Ni2+ in anatase: occupation of nickel ions in octahedral interstitial positions charge-compensated by Ti4+ vacancies or substitution of Ti4+ with Ni2+ balanced by oxygen vacancies. However, it is more likely that Ni is incorporated as Ni3+, because of the closer similarity of Ni3+ ionic radii (60 pm) to Ti4+ ions (60.5 pm), compared to Ni2+ (69 pm) [32]. The present work is aimed to further verify the effect of the synthesis procedure on the properties of Ni/TiO2 catalysts."
6,Samples calcined at 500 °C,"3.1 Samples calcined at 500 °C The samples calcined at 500 °C were characterized by N2 physisorption measurements. It can be noted that both THNi500 and TOxNi500 (Fig. 1 ) exhibit a IV-type isotherm and an H2-type hysteresis loop. However, the shape of both the isotherms and the hysteresis loops are quite different. In THNi500 the hysteresis loop starts at a lower value of p/p o if compared with TOxNi500, which suggests a smaller average pores diameter (4 nm and 7 nm respectively). The increase of average pore size is consistent with the double calcination step. The larger hysteresis loop in THNi500 denotes a larger pores size distribution. Both catalysts are characterized by a rather high surface area (71 and 82 m2/g respectively). Fig. 2 shows the TPR profiles of samples THNi500 and TOxNi500. The most evident difference between THNi500 and TOxNi500 is the number of NiO species found on the support. The TPR pattern of THNi500 shows three peaks, centred at 370 °C, 410 °C and 450 °C, ascribable to as many NiO species interacting more or less strongly with the titania support [33]. On TOxNi500 only one peak centred at 480 °C, ascribable to NiO species strongly interacting with the support, can be detected. These results seem to suggest a kind of heterogeneity of NiO species on sample THNi500. On the contrary TOxNi500 exhibits a single NiO species with strong interactions with the support. X-ray diffraction measurements on both unreduced and reduced catalysts were also carried out. Fig. 3 compares the XRD profiles of THNi500 and TOxNi500 before the reduction. In both samples the main phase of the support is nanocrystalline anatase (A), with a small percentage of brookite (B). On the contrary, with regard to the metal phase, a basic difference can be detected: the occurrence of NiO is clearly detected (inset of Fig. 3 with peak at 2θ ≈ 43.4°) only in sample TOxNi500. As we reported in Ref. 26, the absence of NiO diffraction peak in THNi500 can be explained by nickel incorporation into the anatase lattice. Its presence in the XRD pattern of TOxNi500 suggests the strong influence of the synthesis procedure: the calcination of the support before Ni addition seems to prevent the incorporation of the Ni phase in the support. It is plausible that this difference strongly affects nickel reducibility. In fact, XRD analyses of the reduced (R) catalysts (reported in Fig. 4 ) show that the diffraction peaks of metallic nickel are clearly observable only for TOxNi500R, whereas for THNi500R they can be hardly evidenced. Moreover, the Ni contents obtained by Rietveld quantitative phase analysis, although affected by a large potential uncertainty, appear almost complete in TOxNi500R (about 8%) and much smaller in THNi500R (about 3%). These results suggest that Ni reduction is inhibited by its incorporation in the anatase lattice, which can be avoided by the choice of the proper synthesis procedure. THNi500 and TOxNi500 were tested in ethanol steam reforming at 500 °C. Operating at the lowest possible temperature is advantageous to limit the heat input to the reaction and thus fuel consumption. Nevertheless, at 500 °C many active phases fail in completely convert ethanol or, even at full reactant conversion, lead to unsatisfactory carbon balance. Indeed, catalyst coking is more sensitive around this temperature. Therefore, a challenging goal would be to find out active and sufficiently stable catalysts for ESR at this temperature. Table 1 shows the results of the activity tests. Ethanol conversion at this temperature was incomplete and almost undetectable H2 amount was achieved with THNi500. In fact, this catalyst was only active for ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and also led to extensive coke deposition as suggested by the poor C balance. The latter value should be compared with that of a blank test reported elsewhere [24], which closed to 91% at the same testing temperature. By contrast, TOxNi500 exhibited higher ethanol conversion, though H2 productivity remained limited due to a high amount of by-products unreformed (acetaldehyde and methane). Also in this case the poor carbon balance suggested some coke deposition and a poor stability was observed during testing, as evidenced by the very high standard deviation on almost every parameter reported in Table 1. In particular, the C balance was initially ca. 60%, increasing up to ca. 80% after 5 h-on-stream, when ethanol conversion started decreasing from 100% to ca. 50%. The present catalytic data indicate a remarkable increase in activity for the TOxNi500 catalyst with respect to THNi500. This difference can be ascribed to the availability of the active phase in TOxNi500, whereas in THNi500 Ni incorporation in the anatase lattice depressed the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance is not optimal yet, as TOxNi500 exhibits a low carbon balance, which suggests some coke deposition that deactivates the most active Ni sites, leading to lower ethanol conversion and a poor hydrogen productivity. Coking can be related to the contribution of the Lewis acidity of the support, as better detailed elsewhere [25]. Moreover, coking is thought to occur more promptly over bigger Ni sites [34–37] and, as a matter of fact, a certain sintering of the active phase was detected by XRD analysis of spent TOxNi500. The Rietveld refinement analysis revealed that Ni particle size increased from 14 to 21 nm. In conclusion these preliminary results show that, for the samples calcined at 500 °C, the calcination of the support is essential to prevent Ni incorporation in the anatase lattice, thus making the catalyst active in steam reforming reactions. Nevertheless, the catalyst still shows a certain instability, with sintering even at such low temperature and coking, which is likely to be ascribed to the low temperature thermal treatment."
7,Samples calcined at 800 °C,"3.2 Samples calcined at 800 °C In order to verify the effect of calcination temperature on the physico-chemical properties of the catalysts, a series of characterization measurements was carried out onto the catalysts calcined at 800 °C. Physisorption analyses revealed that both THNi800 and TOxNi800 suffered the collapse of the porous structure of the support, thus obtaining a non-porous material. This effect can be ascribed to the strong thermal treatment that the samples experienced. A single point BET measurement was carried out and a specific surface area of ca. 4 and 2 m2/g, respectively, was obtained. Fig. 5 compares the XRD patterns of THNi800 and TOxNi800 before the reduction treatment. The collapse of the specific surface area values is supported by the presence of very sharp diffraction peaks, in good agreement with the above physisorpion data. It is evident that the titania support is present mainly in the rutile (RU) phase in both samples, because of the high calcination temperature. As for the Ni phase, the XRD patterns clearly indicate the presence of different Ni species depending on the synthesis procedure. In THNi800, Ni is present mainly as NiTiO3. This ilmenite-type structure (I) formed as a consequence of the reaction between NiO and TiO2 during the calcination at high temperature, as also previously reported [33,38,39]. On the contrary, in the case of TOxNi800, Ni is present both as NiTiO3 (I) and as a Ni-freudenbergite phase (F). These results are confirmed by the TPR measurements, reported in Fig. 6 . The TPR profile of THNi800 exhibits only one peak at about 690 °C, due to the reduction of NiTiO3, whereas in TOxNi800 two peaks can be detected, ascribable to the reduction of NiTiO3 (690 °C) and Ni-freudenbergite (785 °C). As a general comment, it can be noted that the TPR patterns of the samples calcined at 800 °C show a shift of the reduction peaks towards much higher temperatures with respect to the catalysts calcined at 500 °C. Harder reducibility of samples calcined at 800 °C can be ascribed to the presence of a mixed oxide. Moreover, it is well known that the interaction between metal and support increases with calcination temperature [39]. Nevertheless the nature of these interactions changes according to the synthesis procedure and leads to the formation of various Ni-species characterized by a different reducibility. In fact, in the XRD analysis of reduced (R) THNi800R (Fig. 7 ) the ilmenite diffraction peaks disappeared, with the parallel appearance of those of metallic nickel, revealing the complete reduction of NiTiO3 to Ni0. On the contrary, on TOxNi800R only a fraction of the Ni-species was reduced to Ni0, as part of Ni is still present as Ni-freudenbergite. As previously observed for the samples calcined at 500 °C, the interaction of the Ni-species with the titania support and their reducibility to metallic nickel seem to be strongly affected by the synthesis procedure. The catalytic performance is affected as well (see Table 1). In fact, THNi800 was the most active catalyst of this series, with an almost complete ethanol conversion, whereas TOxNi800 had a lower and decreasing conversion of the alcohol. These results seem to be related, also in this case, to the availability of metallic nickel, which depends on the reducibility of the different Ni-species. Nickel in NiTiO3 is completely reduced to Ni0, as also reported by Zhang et al. [40]. This is the reason why THNi800 is active in ESR, with total conversion of the reagent. On the contrary, the presence of Ni-freuderbergite hinders Ni reduction, thus depressing the catalytic activity of TOxNi800. With regard to hydrogen, THNi800 hydrogen productivity was twice as large as the TOxNi800 one. The higher catalytic activity of the THNi800 sample with respect to the TOxNi800 one was also demonstrated in terms of lower selectivity to by-products, indicating reforming activity also for methane and acetaldehyde at such low temperature. The induction period before reaching optimal and stable operation may be ascribed to the harsh reducibility of the mixed oxide formed, so that a longer period under reducing atmosphere may help exploiting the best performance. Also the carbon balance for THNi800 was higher and stable with respect to TOxNi800, although still not optimal. This is probably related to the contribution of the Lewis acidity of the support, as previously reported [25], and not to Ni sintering. Ye et al. [41] found that Ni0 reduced from NiTiO3 was highly dispersed and that the agglomeration and sintering of the nickel particles was inhibited, making the catalysts very active in ESR. Our results confirmed that nickel sintering did not take place in THNi800, as the Rietveld refinement analysis revealed that Ni particle size remained constant (27 nm) also after the reaction. This result can be attributed to the SMSI effect, due to the strong interaction between Ni and titania, and to the phase transformation of the support from anatase to rutile as a consequence of the calcination temperature, which hinders a significant Ni incorporation in the titania lattice. Although an early study suggested that nickel oxide solubility would be enhanced upon anatase-to-rutile conversion [42], no definite results are available on this issue. In fact the oxygen vacancy defects which charge-compensate the incorporation of Ni2+ or Ni3+ ions into the anatase lattice are likely to be removed by annealing at high temperature and transformation to rutile, leading to expulsion of Ni from rutile lattice. Recently Raj et al [22]. found that a Ni/rutile catalyst is more active in selective hydrogenation of acetophenone than Ni/anatase because of higher concentration of Ni on the surface and SMSI. The availability of metallic Ni sites, stabilized against sintering by strong interaction with the titania support, seems to be the key to achieve satisfactory catalytic performance. In order to achieve these results, the synthesis conditions must be properly tuned."
8,Conclusions,"In this work the activity of Ni/TiO2 catalysts in ethanol steam reforming was studied. Our results highlighted that two parameters in particular affect the catalytic performance of TiO2-supported Ni samples. First of all, nickel reducibility is an essential condition to obtain high performing catalysts, since it is related to the availability of metallic Ni, which is the active phase in ESR. For our samples, Ni incorporation (both in the anatase lattice of the support or in a scarcely reducible structure as Ni-freuderbergite) depressed the catalytic activity (i. e. low ethanol conversion and hydrogen productivity). The second condition is the stabilization of Ni particles through strong metal-support interactions. We found that Ni sintering led to fast coking and deactivation. These two conditions can be reached by properly tuning the synthesis conditions of the Ni/TiO2 catalyst."
