0,Introduction,"Eucalyptus trees are fast growing and planted on more than 19 million ha of land globally [1]. At a growth rate of 40–50ton/ha within a harvesting period of 4 years, 190–238milliontons of eucalyptus wood can be produced annually [2]. Currently, eucalyptus wood is used largely by pulp and paper industries with eucalyptus bark as the main residue. The bark can be used as an ingredient for fertilizer making or as solid biofuel for power generation. In addition, the eucalyptus bark was recently used as a raw material for bio-oil production by fast pyrolysis [3]. Fast pyrolysis can thermochemically convert solid biomass into liquid bio-fuel, leaving solid char as a secondary by-product. In general, the process is carried out at a reaction temperature of 400–600°C in an oxygen-free environment. The important criteria for achieving fast pyrolysis conditions include high heating rate, short vapour residence time and rapid quenching of the pyrolysis vapour. The yield and properties of bio-oil depend largely on pyrolysis conditions and reactor configurations. Typical bio-oils are known to be viscous, with low pH of 2–3, high water content of 20–30wt%, low heating value of 13–18MJ/Kg and low storage and thermal stability [4]. These problems must be solved efficiently and economically before the end product can be launched on a market. One of the simple and efficient ways to improve bio-oil properties is blending with other fuels or adding a solvent or additive to the bio-oil. This method was introduced by Diebold et al. [5] and Radlein et al. [6] who pioneered the works on bio-oil stability improvement. Several researchers have studied mixtures of bio-oils with ethanol [3,7–12], methanol [3–5,7,8,10,13], acetone [7,10], isopropanol [9] and ethyl acetate [7,10,14] at proportions between 2.5 and 30wt%. These bio-oil samples were produced from hybrid poplar [5,7], 50% poultry litter and 50% pinewood mixtures [8], hardwood [4,10], eucalyptus bark [3], pine [9,15], rice husk [13,16], softwood bark [17], corn stover [11] using vortex [5,7], fluidised-bed [8,10,13,16], circulating fluidised-bed [4,9], vacuum [17], free-fall [3] and microwave reactors [11]. Lehto et al. [18] mentioned that although alcohol such as ethanol and methanol are miscible in bio-oil, in most cases the addition of lighter fuel to the bio-oil is not the most lucrative solution. However, the cost of the additive could be offset by the extra heating value added to the bio-oil, especially when the alcohol is produced domestically and thus inexpensively. In addition there are several other benefits from the simple alcohol addition method as similar findings were reported from these studies [3–5,7,9–11,13,16,17]. The pH of the bio-oil increased after the addition of solvents [3]. This was due to reactions of the solvent with acids present in bio-oil. For example, if alcohol is added, esterification with acetic acid could take place, producing an ester and water: the acid content reduces, increasing the pH. The addition of some solvents with heating values higher than that of bio-oil led to an increase of the bio-oil heating value [3]. In addition, it was reported that the additive lowers the bio-oil viscosity [13] and increase the bio-oil stability [3,8]. The extent to which the bio-oil properties could be improved also depended on the amount of the added solvent [9] as well as the addition time after production. Diebold and Czernik [7] reported that the addition of methanol to freshly-produced bio-oil was more effective than adding methanol to aged bio-oil in terms of the viscosity reduction. They also suggested that there are two mechanisms involved in the improvement of bio-oil stability by alcohol addition: (1) molecular dilution to slow the chemical reactions and (2) the formation of chain-terminated intermediate products by the reaction of alcohol with bio-oil reactive components [7]. Several solvents have been added during bio-oil production, specifically at the condenser. These included ethanol [19–21], isoparaffin [21] and water [20,21]. Experiments were carried out on pine wood [19,20], Scotch pine [21], Pterocarpus indicus [21], using auger [19,20] and fluidised bed reactors [21]. Reports show that the bio-oil yield can be either increased or decreased depending on the biomass types and the solvents applied [19–21]. Li et al. [21] reported that when using isoparaffin as a spray medium, the bio-oil yields derived from P. indicus increased from 49wt% to 52wt% and from Scotch pine increased from 45wt% to 51wt%. However, if deionised water was used as a spray medium when pyrolysing P. indicus, the bio-oil yield decreased from 49wt% to 47.5wt%. Likewise, Li et al. [20] investigated untreated and dilute-acid pretreated loblolly pinewood samples in auger pyrolysis with water spray injection at 8ml/min. They found that the bio-oil yield was decreased from 58±2wt% to 56±2wt% for the untreated biomass after spray injection. However, if the pretreated biomass was applied, the bio-oil yield increased from 58±2wt% to 59±0.4wt% due to the water injection. When ethanol was used at the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8.3–33 or the ethanol content in bio-oil of 7.3–23.3wt%, the bio-oil yield tended to increase from 58wt% to 62wt% [19]. Also, the addition of solvent to the pyrolysis vapour affected the bio-oil properties [19,21]. The bio-oil pH increased, whereas the water content was decreased [19,21]. When applying ethanol in the pyrolysis process, viscosity of bio-oil was reduced by up to 56% [19], whereas the viscosity was found to increase when isoparaffin and deionised water were used as spray media [21]. This is attributed to the reactions of ethanol and the pyrolysis vapour compounds such as esterification of carboxylic acids and acetalisations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde [19]. It is clear from the literature that the additives or solvents are beneficial to bio-oil properties no matter how they are introduced to bio-oil. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which method of solvent addition is better for bio-oil yield and property improvement. Therefore, the originality of this work is the comparison of three solvent addition techniques using ethanol and methanol as solvents in order to find out which method is the best for improving bio-oil quality. These three methods include external blending of alcohol and bio-oil, in-situ addition at the condenser inlet and at the biomass feeding tube. The bio-oil yields and properties including water content, solids content, ash content, pH, specific gravity, viscosity, stability and heating value were measured."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biomass feedstock,"2.1 Biomass feedstock Biomass used in this work was eucalyptus bark obtained from a paper factory in Udonthani Province, Thailand. The biomass material was ground and sieved to a particle size range of 0.212–0.500mm. The proximate, ultimate and heating value analyses of the biomass sample are shown in Table 1 . The higher heating values (HHV) of the biomass samples were calculated using the following equation [22]: (1) HHV dry ( MJ kg ) = − 1.3675 + 0.3137 C + 0.7009 H + 0.0318 O * C and H are percentages on dry basis of carbon and hydrogen, respectively and O* is 100-C-H-ash. The lower heating values (LHV) were calculated from HHV and hydrogen content by [23]: (2) LHV d r y ( MJ kg ) = HHV d r y − 2.442 × 8.936 H 100"
3,Fast pyrolysis apparatus,"2.2 Fast pyrolysis apparatus The production of bio-oil from eucalyptus bark samples was performed in a free-fall fast pyrolysis unit as shown in Fig. 1 . The unit consisted of a biomass hopper, a screw feeder, a tubular reactor, three char pots, two cyclone separators, a fixed-bed glass wool hot filter, a water-cooled condenser, an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), four bio-oil pots (pots 1 and 2 for heavy bio-oils and pots 3 and 4 for light bio-oils), two dry-ice/acetone condensers and a cotton wool filter. The biomass hopper was made with 304 stainless steel and had a capacity of 1.5kg dry biomass sample. The biomass particles were conveyed to the reactor by a stainless steel screw feeder. At the top of the reactor, there was a water-cooling jacket, installed to prevent the heat from the reactor furnace from reaching the biomass. Without this cooling jacket, the biomass could be pre-pyrolysed and block the feeder. The reactor was made from a 10.3mm ID 304 stainless steel tube with 1.2m high. The reactor was heated by a 6-kW tailor-made muffle furnace. The temperature of the heated zone was controlled by a PID temperature controller (SESTOS, model D1S-2R) using a K-type thermocouple, which was placed inside the reactor tube close to the reactor wall at the middle of the reactor length. The char pots, cyclones, hot filter and the water-cooled condenser were made from 304 stainless steel. The bio-oil pots, dry-ice/acetone condenser and cotton wool filter were glassware. Alcohol was fed to the pyrolysis system using an alcohol feeding unit. The feeding rate was controlled by four N2 flow meters. Alcohol was fed at either position ① (screw feeder) or ② (condenser)."
4,Alcohol feeding unit,"2.3 Alcohol feeding unit The alcohol feeding unit consisted of a glass bottle and a venturi tubing set. The design and dimensions of the unit is shown in Fig. 2 . The inside diameters of the carrier gas tubes were 7mm. The constricted section inside diameter was 2mm, whereas that of alcohol suction tube was 1mm. The top of the alcohol bottle was connected to a 7mm ID tube for controlling the pressure inside the bottle. This tube was connected with flow meter 3 which was used to control the nitrogen flow rate from 0.1-0.5l/min. Flow meter 4 controlled the entrained flow of nitrogen. The flow was fixed at 1.5l/min. Based on these flow rates, the feed rate of the alcohol was 2.5–20.0g/h. It is important to note that the temperature at which N2 was saturated with alcohols in the glass bottle is around 30°C and the N2 flow rate was measured at 30°C and 1atm."
5,Fast pyrolysis experiments,"2.4 Fast pyrolysis experiments Fast pyrolysis was conducted in a free-fall reactor at 500 °C using eucalyptus bark with a particle size range of 0.212–0.500mm. The total nitrogen flow rate of the system was controlled at 3l/min. The biomass feed rate was 80–150g/h. For each experimental run, approximately 100g of biomass was fed to the unit. For the in-situ addition of alcohol, ethanol and methanol were continuously fed at either the screw feeder or the pyrolysis gas inlet of the water-cooled condenser as labelled by in Fig. 1. The amount of the total alcohol addition was calculated to be ∼5–30wt% of alcohol to heavy bio-oil. A similar proportion was used to prepare the external addition of alcohol in order to compare the effect of in-situ and external addition of alcohol on bio-oil properties. For each experiment, all parts of the fast pyrolysis unit were weighed before and after the experiment. This data was used to calculate the mass balances yields of bio-oil and char, whereas that of the non-condensable gases was calculated by difference, using the following equations: (3) % Bio − oil = ∑ i = 0 n L i − ( A + B ) A l O H M b i o m a s s × 100 (4) % Char = ∑ i = 0 n S i M b i o m a s s × 100 (5) % Heavy Bio − oil = L 1 + L 2 + L 5 + L 6 − A × A l O H M b i o m a s s × 100 (6) % Light Bio − oil = L 3 + L 4 + L 7 + L 8 − B × A l O H M b i o m a s s × 100 (7) ∑ i = 0 n L i = L 1 + L 2 + L 3 + L 4 + L 5 + L 6 + L 7 + L 8 (8) ∑ i = 0 n S i = S 1 + S 2 + S 3 + S 4 + S 5 + S 6 L 1 − L 4 are the masses of the liquid product collected from bio-oil pots 1–4(g). L 5 − L 8 are the mass of the liquid product sticking to the water-cooled condenser, ESP, dry-ice acetone condensers 1 and 2, respectively (g). A l O H is the total mass of alcohol added to the system (g). S 1 − S 3 are the mass of the solid char collected in the char pots 1–3, respectively (g). S 4 − S 6 are the mass of the solid char left in the reactor tube, the cyclone ports 1 and 2 and the hot filter, respectively (g). M b i o m a s s is the mass of the total dry biomass fed (g). “A” is the fraction of alcohol that ends up in the heavy bio-oil. According to the experiments on feeding alcohol at the screw feeder and at the condenser, “A” is equal to 0.48 and 1.0, respectively. “B” is the fraction of alcohol that ends up in the light bio-oil. According to the experiments on feeding alcohol at the screw feeder and at the condenser, “B” is equal to 0.20 and 0, respectively. It is important to state that large proportion (95%) of the heavy bio-oil was recovered in the bio-oil pots (L1 and L2). Only ∼5% of heavy bio-oil (L5 and L6) stuck to the wall of the condenser and ESP and was not collected. Similar method was also applied for L7 and L8 of light bio-oil as only ∼3% of total light bio-oil was not collected in the bio-oil pot."
6,Bio-oil analysis,"2.5 Bio-oil analysis The bio-oil samples were analysed for their water content, solids content, ash content, pH, specific gravity, viscosity, stability and heating value. It is important to note that the bio-oils produced in this work were fractionated in to heavy and light bio-oils. The heavy bio-oils are from the bio-oil pots 1 and 2, whereas the light ones were from pots 3 as shown in Fig. 1. Only heavy bio-oil fractions were considered as liquid fuel and were analysed for these properties because the light fraction contained significant proportion of water and cannot be combusted in its current form. The details for each analysis are summarised below. 2.5.1 Water content The water content of the bio-oil samples was determined by the volumetric Karl-Fischer titration technique. The instrument used was V20 Mettler Toledo. The titration indicator was Hydranal composite 5K and the solvent was Working Medium K (Fluka Analytical). 2.5.2 Solids content The solids content of bio-oil samples was measured as ethanol insolubles using a vacuum filtration technique. About 2–3g of bio-oil was mixed with approximately 50ml of 95% ethanol. Then, the solution was filtered through a pre-dried and weighed Whatman No. 3 qualitative filter paper with particle retention of 6μm. The filter paper was flushed with ethanol to remove all ethanol soluble material and only solids remained. The filter paper was then dried at ambient temperature for 15min and then in an oven at 105°C for 30min. The paper was subsequently left to cool down in a desiccator before being weighed. 2.5.3 Ash content Approximately 2–3g of bio-oil was burnt in a furnace at 775°C for 24h or until constant weight was reached. The residue was ash from bio-oil and was calculated as a percentage in bio-oil. 2.5.4 pH The pH of the liquid samples was measured using a UB-10 Denver Instrument pH meter. Prior to the analysis, the instrument was calibrated with pH 4, 7 and 10 buffer solutions. 2.5.5 Specific gravity The specific gravity of bio-oil was measured by weighing a constant volume of bio-oil in a 25ml density bottle. The weight and volume were used to calculate the specific gravity. 2.5.6 Viscosity The kinematic viscosity of the bio-oil samples was determined by a Cannon-Fenske opaque viscometer. Approximately 12g of bio-oil was put into the viscometer maintained at 40°C and allowed to flow freely. The time spent in the tube was recorded and the viscosity was calculated by a constant factor obtained from calibration with liquid standard. 2.5.7 Stability Stability indicates how much the viscosity of the bio-oil changes over a period of time. Generally, the viscosity of the fresh bio-oil is compared with that stored for about one year. Researchers [24] reported that the viscosity of bio-oil stored at 80°C for 24h is equivalent to that stored at room temperature for 1year. The technique of simulating the storage of bio-oil for 1year by high temperature storage is called accelerated ageing. In this work, the bio-oil samples were aged at 80°C for 72h to clearly see the effects of alcohol addition and injection positions on bio-oil stability. The parameters used to explain the bio-oil stability are stability index (SI) and ageing rate (AR), which were calculated [25]. (9) SI = V a g e d − V f r e s h V f r e s h (10) AR = V a g e d − V f r e s h 72 ( c S t / h ) V a g e d and V f r e s h are the kinematic viscosity in cSt of the aged and the fresh bio-oils. A high SI indicates low stability. 2.5.8 Heating value The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil was determined with an IKA-C200 Toledo bomb calorimeter. Approximately 1g of bio-oil was placed in a cup and put in a bomb. The HHV was calculated based on the bio-oil weight, the changes of temperature and the specific heat capacity of the bomb, which was calibrated with benzoic acid. The HHV was determined following ASTM D 4809. To calculate the values on water-free or dry basis, the following equations were applied taking into account the water content of bio-oil (H2O, wt%). (11) HHV d r y = H H V a s − p r o d u c e d ( 1 − H 2 O 100 )"
7,Reproducibility,"2.6 Reproducibility Reproducibility of the bio-oil production in the free-fall reactor was examined at a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C without the alcohol addition. Three experimental runs were carried out. It was found that the reproducibility, which is calculated as the standard deviation (S.D.), was ±3.8% for total bio-oil, ±3.1% for char, ±3.8% for gas, ±2.0% for heavy bio-oil and ±3.4% for light bio-oil yields."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis The effect of alcohol addition parameters (feed position, alcohol type and alcohol content) on yields of pyrolysis products and heavy bio-oil properties was statistically analysed by Pearson correlation analysis to determine if there is a relationship between two variables by calculating Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) or Pearson’s r [26]: (12) r = n ∑ X i Y i − ∑ X i ∑ Y i [ n ∑ X i 2 − ( ∑ X i ) 2 ] [ n ∑ Y i 2 − ( ∑ Y i ) 2 ] where n=number of data X=data from the first time measurement Y=data from the second time measurement The Pearson’s r is between −1 and +1. The positive values denote positive linear correlation, whereas the negative values denote negative linear correlation. A value of 0 denotes no linear correlation. The closer the value is to 1 or −1, the stronger the linear correlation."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Effects of alcohol addition on product yields,"3.1 Effects of alcohol addition on product yields There were certain controlled parameters that fluctuated to some degrees and could not be fully controlled. These included the biomass feed rate and the pyrolysis temperature, which could affect the pyrolysis product yield. Therefore, the reproducibility of the experimental runs was studied. The results showed that without alcohol addition, pyrolysis of eucalyptus bark in the free-fall reactor at 500°C gave a bio-oil yield of 60±4wt%, a char yield of 27±3wt% and a non-condensable gas yield of 13±4wt%. Ethanol and methanol were added at either the screw feeder or the condenser of the fast pyrolysis unit at a rate of 2.5–20g/h, which was equivalent to 4.6–31wt% of alcohol to heavy bio-oil. Since the bio-oil yield changed with experimental conditions, it was not possible, in practice, to control the ratio of alcohol addition to the bio-oil yield by adjusting the addition rate. Therefore, the percentages of alcohol to heavy bio-oil, or alcohol content, shown in Table 2 were calculated from the ratio of total weight of alcohol to heavy bio-oil produced. This ratio allows us to compare the effects of in-situ and external addition of alcohol to the main part of the liquid product, the heavy phase of bio-oil. Table 2 summarises the effects of feed position, alcohol type and alcohol content on pyrolysis product yields. Since the yields varied considerably, it is rather difficult to draw the conclusive findings by observing only the data of the mass balance yields. Therefore, statistical analysis was performed and the results are shown in Table 3 . Two parameters were calculated using SPSS software and shown in Table including Pearson Correlation (r) and sig. (2-tailed) or p-value. Statistically, it was shown that the feed position and the alcohol type did not significantly affect the product yield. Only alcohol content affected the total bio-oil and gas yields. The alcohol content affected the total bio-oil yield at the 99% confidence level, whereas it affected the gas yield at 95% confidence level. The Pearson correlation coefficients are −0.728 for the bio-oil yield and 0.661 for the gas yield. This means that there are a strong negative correlation between the alcohol content and the bio-oil yield and a strong positive correlation between the alcohol content and the gas yield. In other words, increasing the alcohol content led to the decrease in the total bio-oil yield and the increase in the gas yield. According to the literature, the effect of in-situ alcohol addition on bio-oil yield is not consistent depending on several factors. Therefore, the alcohol addition could reduce or increase the bio-oil yield. The reduction of the bio-oil yield when adding liquid to the pyrolysis system at the condenser was previously reported by Li et al. [20]. They found that the bio-oil produced from pine wood in an auger reactor reduced from 58 to 55.6wt% when water was used as spray medium at a rate of 8ml/min. However, the bio-oil yield was found to increase when isoparaffin was sprayed at the condenser of a fluidised bed reactor at the amount of 20wt% of biomass [21].With their system, the P. indicus bio-oil yield was increased from 49 to 52wt% and the Scotch pine bio-oil yield was increased from 45 to 51wt% [21]. Based on the literature and the current findings, it is logical to state that the influence of in-situ alcohol addition can lead to the increase or decrease of bio-oil yield. According to Table 2, at ∼24–31wt% alcohol content, the total bio-oil yield decreased from 60wt% (no alcohol addition) to 38–50wt%, indicating a 10–22wt% total bio-oil yield decrease. This decrease corresponds to the increase of the gas yield from 13wt% (no alcohol addition) to 25–33wt%, or decreasing 12–20wt%. Likewise, at ∼5–6wt% alcohol content, the total bio-oil yield decreased 6–12wt% and the gas yield increased 3–13wt%. If lower alcohol content of less than 5% is fed to the system, one would expect the similar result, but to the less extent than using higher proportion of alcohol in terms of bio-oil reduction and gas production and possibly the effect on bio-oil properties. Therefore, only bio-oil content of higher than 5wt% was applied in order to clearly observe the results. The combination of these findings implied that the bio-oil was transformed to non-condensable gases when alcohol was added to the pyrolysis system either at the screw feeder or the condenser. As a consequence, the change of the char yield was not significant. This observation is also supported by the statistical analysis as shown in Table 3. The potential reasons why the bio-oil became non-condensable gases when alcohol was added to the system are related to certain chemical reactions taking place such as methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) or ethanol-to-hydrocarbon (ETH) that promote the formation of lighter compounds or intermediates that might further reacted with pyrolysis vapour. Since the mass of alcohol that became gases was excluded from the gas yield in the mass balance calculation, the increase of the gas yield cannot be derived from the mass of alcohol, but rather from the part of the pyrolysis vapour that chemically bonded to the intermediates from the alcohol decomposition product."
11,Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil viscosity,"3.2 Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil viscosity According to the specification for pyrolysis liquid biofuel (ASTM D7544-12), the kinematic viscosity of bio-oil measured at 40°C must not exceed 125 cSt (mm2/s). Provided that the chemical composition of bio-oil is the same, the lower viscosity is preferred for applications, such as pumping and spraying, storage and transport. Fig. 3 (a) shows the variation of the initial viscosity of bio-oil produced from eucalyptus bark in the free-fall reactor with alcohol content. Without the alcohol addition, the initial viscosity was 21 cSt, thus meeting the requirement of the ASTM D7544-12. When adding 2.5-30% of methanol or ethanol to the bio-oil, the viscosity reduced sharply to 7–16 cSt, or a reduction of 24–67%. Moreover, it is very interesting to note from Fig. 3(a) that the in-situ addition of alcohol enhanced the reduction of the initial viscosity of bio-oil. When feeding 5–30% of either ethanol or methanol to the pyrolysis system at either the screw feeder or the condenser, the bio-oil viscosity reduced to 5–7 cSt or a 67–76% viscosity reduction. The external addition of 30% alcohol gave a viscosity reduction to the in-situ addition of only 5% of alcohol. Therefore, in-situ addition similar of alcohol is more effective for bio-oil viscosity improvement than external mixing or blending. The reason for this is expected to be a sudden termination of oligomers chain, thus preventing polymerization. When externally added alcohol to bio-oil, polymerization already occurred to a certain level which increased the molecular weight of the bio-oil compounds and accordingly increased the viscosity. For in-situ addition, alcohol quickly reacted with compounds such as acids, aldehydes and ketones via esterification, transesterification and etherification [7]. It is also important to note that the reaction temperature occurred in the case of in-situ alcohol addition was higher than the external case. Therefore, it is likely that the elevated temperature enhanced the chain termination reactions. The influence of alcohol type and feed position according to Fig. 3 is not clear. Therefore, statistical analysis was carried out to identify the effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil properties. The results are shown in Table 4 for external addition and Table 5 for in-situ addition. It is apparent from the statistics that alcohol type did not affect any of the bio-oil properties for external mixing. Nevertheless, it affected the viscosity of the aged bio-oil at 95% confidence level for in-situ addition. According to the negative value of the Pearson correlation coefficient (−0.690), methanol gave lower viscosity of the aged bio-oil than ethanol because the setting values of ethanol and methanol in the statistical data table were 1 and 2, respectively. The majority of work reported in the literature also found that methanol is more effective than ethanol in terms of viscosity reduction [3,7,11,27]. However, two studies found that ethanol was a slightly better additive than methanol for lowering the viscosity of bio-oil produced from a mixture of poultry litter and pine wood [8,28]. Table 5 also shows that the feed position did not significantly affect the viscosity of bio-oil. Fig. 3 together with Tables 4 and 5 show that the alcohol content affected the bio-oil viscosity only in the external addition case. For external addition, the viscosity of fresh and aged bio-oils significantly decreased with the increase of alcohol content. For in-situ alcohol addition, the viscosity reduced sharply after adding 5% alcohol. Further addition did not statistically lead to any viscosity reduction. Although the initial viscosity of bio-oil already meets the ASTM standard requirement, when bio-oil has been stored for a period of time, its viscosity can increase significantly and may exceed the acceptable limit of 125 cSt. Without any additive, the bio-oil produced in this work had a viscosity of ∼200 cSt after storage at 80°C for 3days—see Fig. 3(b). The external addition of ethanol or methanol at 5wt% can reduce the viscosity to ∼60 cSt, which is acceptable. Importantly, the viscosity of the bio-oil that was produced with the alcohol addition to the pyrolysis system was still only ∼15–30 cSt even after 3days of accelerated aging. These results confirm the significance of the in-situ addition of alcohol for lowering the bio-oil viscosity."
12,Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil stability,"3.3 Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil stability To investigate the heavy bio-oil stability, the stability index (SI), ageing rate (AR) and ageing rate decrease factor (ARDF) are calculated parameters used to differentiate the impacts of (1) in-situ and external addition, (2) alcohol type and (3) in-situ addition positions at screw feeder and condenser. The results are presented in Fig. 4 . Clearly, the graphs are separated into two groups for Fig. 4(a)–(c): group A for in-situ alcohol addition and group B for external addition. Based on the SI (Fig. 4(a)), group A had a lower value, thereby indicating higher stability because the SI is the change of the viscosity compared to the initial viscosity. Fig. 4(a) shows that without alcohol addition, the SI was ∼8. When adding 5% of alcohol externally, the SI reduced to ∼4 and further addition (up to 31%) did not further reduce the SI. The SI can be reduced further when the same quantity of alcohol (5%) was added in the pyrolysis process to a minimum of ∼1 by feeding methanol at the condenser. Based on the statistical results in Tables 4 and 5, the SI was not significantly affected by increasing the alcohol content from 5 to 31%. Based on the SI in Fig. 4(a) and the statistical results in Table 5, methanol was slightly more effective than ethanol and both addition positions gave similar results. Fig. 4(b) shows the variation of the bio-oil ageing rate with the percentage of alcohol to heavy bio-oil. The ageing rate of the original bio-oil was 2.7cSt/h. It was reduced to 0.8cSt/h for 5% and to ∼0.4cSt/h for 30% external alcohol addition. Interestingly, the in-situ addition led to a relatively low ageing rate of 0.2–0.4cSt/h with only 5% alcohol addition. Based on this ageing rate, methanol was again slightly more effective than ethanol, whereas the feeding position had little effect. This is confirmed by the statistical analysis results in Table 5. Another stability indicator, ageing rate decrease factor (ARDF), was calculated by dividing the ageing rate of the improved bio-oil with that of the original bio-oil. If the ARDF is equal to 1, it means that there is no improvement of the bio-oil stability. The higher the ARDF, the better the stability improvement. The plots in Fig. 4(c) can also be separated into two groups. Group A shows significantly higher ARDF than group B. Therefore, this confirms that the in-situ addition is better than the external mixing in terms of the stability improvement. Diebold and Czernik [7] suggested that the components in bio-oil could be reacting with alcohols to become chain terminated, which improves the stability. For adding at the condenser, the chain termination reaction temperature occurred at elevated temperature compared to external addition. Some reactions could also occur in vapour phase where water was spatially separated from reactants. For adding at the screw feeder, it is expected that alcohols were pyrolysed giving off hydrogen gas or free radicals. These free radicals react with components in pyrolysis vapour giving more stable or less reactive products. Fig. 4 also shows that the maximum ARDF of the external addition samples was ∼6 when adding ∼30% of either ethanol or methanol, whereas the ARDF of ∼14 was achieved when only 5% of methanol was added at the screw feeder. Comparing the alcohol type on the ARDF, it is clear that methanol gave better results, which is again confirmed by the statistical analysis results in Table 5. Moreover, it was found that the alcohol feeding positions did not significantly affect the ARDF at 95% confidence level."
13,Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil water content,"3.4 Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil water content Typically, water in bio-oil is derived from biomass moisture and pyrolysis reaction water from degradation of the lignocellulosic structure. When alcohol is added, esterification can occur, thus producing additional water. The variation of bio-oil water content is shown in Fig. 5 (a). Without alcohol addition, the bio-oil water content was 33wt%. When externally adding alcohol (up to 30%) to bio-oil, the water content decreased steadily to ∼27wt% (18% reduction). In this case, methanol gave lower bio-oil water content than ethanol. When adding alcohol internally, the bio-oil water content reduced sharply after 5% alcohol content to a minimum of ∼23wt% (30% reduction) for the case of methanol added to the pyrolysis system at the screw feeder. Further increase of alcohol content did not reduce further water content, but rather increased slightly, for most cases except the ethanol-at-condenser case. There is also a distinct trend found with increasing alcohol content between methanol and ethanol added in the condenser. The water content of bio-oil constantly decreased with the increase of alcohol content from 5 to 30wt% when adding ethanol in the condenser. When adding methanol in the same place, the water content reduced with the increase of alcohol content from 5 to 15wt% and further increase of the content to 25wt% led the increase of the water content, but still lower than the one without the alcohol addition. It is likely that at high proportion of methanol addition, esterification reactions of methanol and acids in bio-oil took place and gave water as a product. It is important to note that alcohol added to bio-oil can lead to esterification reactions with acids in bio-oil to produce esters and water. However, the results showed that the bio-oil water content was reduced instead of being increased. This is due to the dilution effect of the anhydrous alcohols. By adding 30% of the alcohol to the bio-oil of 33% water content, the mixture would have a water content of 23% if no chemical reaction took place. However, Fig. 5(a) shows that most of the bio-oil water contents were higher than 23% for 30% alcohol content. This implies that some water came from esterification reactions. In the case of external addition, a maximum of 4% water content of bio-oil could stem from esterification reactions. The reduction of the bio-oil water content was previously reported by Yu et al. [11]. They externally mixed bio-oils with 10–30wt% of ethanol and methanol and found that the water content of the blend proportionately reduced from 15.2wt% to 11.2-14.1wt%. It appears that the in-situ alcohol addition, especially at the screw feeder gave lower water content that external blending. This is possibly related to the forming of the reaction water during biomass fast pyrolysis in the presence of pyrolysed alcohol. Since pyrolysed alcohol can give hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas as products, these gases could be involved in biomass pyrolysis reactions in a way that suppresses reaction water or dehydration reactions."
14,Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil pH,"3.5 Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil pH The pH of bio-oil produced without alcohol addition was 2.5. Fig. 5(b) shows that the pH increased with the alcohol content. For external mixing, the effects of ethanol and methanol on bio-oil pH were similar and a maximum pH of 2.9 was obtained for 30% alcohol content. The in-situ alcohol addition gave slightly different results compared to the external mixing. Adding methanol at the screw feeder led to the highest increase of the bio-oil pH; pH 3.5 was obtained with 30% alcohol content. The reason why in-situ addition, especially feeding methanol at the screw feeder, is superior to the external mixing is possibly due to the reactions of gas from pyrolysed methanol with biomass pyrolysis vapour before condensation. Nevertheless, the reactions are still not understood and should be a subject for future work. Furthermore, feeding ethanol at the condenser hardly increased the bio-oil pH. The current results are consistent with the previous study by Hilten et al. [19] who found that increasing ethanol content from 0 to 23wt% led to a pH increase of the slow pyrolysis oily liquid from 2.45 to 3.05. Although, in general, the addition of alcohol could improve bio-oil acidity by increasing its pH, the bio-oils produced in this work were still acidic. Therefore, further upgrading is required in order to improve their acidity levels. Otherwise, cautions must be given for their applications."
15,Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil heating value,"3.6 Effects of alcohol addition on bio-oil heating value Fig. 5(c) and (d) show the effect of alcohol content on the higher heating value (HHV) of heavy bio-oil on as-produced and dry bases, respectively. Without the alcohol addition, the heavy bio-oil had a HHV of 12.3MJ/kg on as-produced basis and 18.3MJ/kg on dry basis. The relatively low heating value (HHV) of the as-produced heavy bio-oil is due to its high (33wt%) water content. On both bases, increasing the alcohol content tended to increase the HHV. For 30wt% external alcohol addition, the HHV on as-produced basis increased to 18MJ/kg for methanol feeding and 19MJ/kg for ethanol feeding. These were slightly higher than their theoretical values of 17.5MJ/kg for ethanol case and 15.5MJ/kg for methanol case. It can be seen that the HHV of the heavy bio-oil mixed with ethanol was higher than that of the methanol/bio-oil blend since the HHV of ethanol (29.7MJ/kg) is higher than that of methanol (23MJ/kg). Fig. 5(c) also shows that the in-situ addition of alcohol did not give significantly different results from the external one. For low (∼5wt%) alcohol content, feeding alcohol at the screw feeder gave heavy bio-oil of slightly higher HHV than the external counterparts, whereas feeding at the condenser gave a slightly lower HHV. For high (>20wt%) alcohol content, both feeding positions gave similar results and slightly lower HHV than external addition. In general, the in-situ alcohol addition can enhance the heavy bio-oil heating value. The heating value could also be decreased by adding alcohol if the heating value of the initial bio-oil is already higher than that of alcohol. For example, Hilten et al. [19] applied alcohol with a HHV of 27MJ/kg to the oily pyrolysis liquid that had an initial HHV of 27.6MJ/kg. They found that when adding 7.4–23.2wt% ethanol, the HHV reduced to 24.5–27MJ/kg."
16,"Effects of alcohol addition on specific gravity, ash content and solids content of bio-oil","3.7 Effects of alcohol addition on specific gravity, ash content and solids content of bio-oil The specific gravity, ash and solids content of bio-oil are tabulated in Table 6 . For in-situ addition of 5–31wt% alcohol, the bio-oil specific gravity was 1.03–1.15, the ash content was 0.09–0.18wt%, and the solids content was 0.11–0.45wt%. Based on the data in Table 6 and the statistical analysis in Table 5, it is clear that the alcohol feeding position, type and content did not significantly affect these properties at 95% confidence level. For external mixing, these properties decreased with the increase in the alcohol content as noticed from the negative values of Pearson’s r in Table 4."
17,Conclusions,"Fast pyrolylsis of eucalyptus bark in a free-fall reactor without alcohol addition gave 60wt% bio-oil, 27wt% char and 13wt% gas. Adding 5–31wt% ethanol or methanol to heavy bio-oil decreased bio-oil yield and increased gas yield, giving constant char yield. In-situ addition of alcohol was more effective than external mixing in terms of the bio-oil quality improvement measured from viscosity, stability, water content and pH. Feeding 5wt% alcohol into the process gave similar or even better results than externally mixing 30wt% alcohol with bio-oil. The heating value, specific gravity, ash and solids contents were similarly improved by both addition techniques. There was no significant impact of the alcohol feeding position on bio-oil properties. Methanol was superior to ethanol for the in-situ improvement of bio-oil viscosity, stability and pH."
