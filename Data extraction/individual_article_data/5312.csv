0,Introduction,"Due to the shortage of the fossil fuel resources, seeking for the alternative fuels is the key issue for the energy research. Hydrogen is considered as the one of the promising clean fuel for the next generation. Conventionally, hydrogen can be produced by fuel processing (reforming, pyrolysis, and gasification), electrolysis and the biological process (light fermentation, dark fermentation, and the other biological process) [1]. For the biological process, hydrolysis of the biomass to obtain the reducing sugar as the substrate for the fermentation process is the key process [2,3]. In general, the hydrolysis of the biomass can be attained by the hydrothermal chemical process or the biological digestion [4]. The hydrogen production from sugars and alcohols at ca. 500 K by the aqueous phase reforming were proposed by Cortright et al. [5]. The results revealed a possible route to produce hydrogen from biomass directly and the reaction mechanism was also proposed. Therefore, production of alternative energy from biomass by the hydrothermal route became a key process for the energy production in the next generation [6]. The composition of numerous kinds biomass was well studied by Garrote et al. [7]. They provided basic information of biomass for application in the future. Valenzuela and co-authors [8] studied the aqueous phase reforming of woody biomass in a batch reactor, and they also found the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst could effectively improve the hydrogen selectivity and yield. However, the liquid phase products were not took into account. In this work, both of the gas phase and liquid phase were took into consideration and the effects of some factors were also discussed. Meryemoglu et al. [9] used a two-step process to produce hydrogen by aqueous phase reforming and the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was also found to be able to enhance the hydrogen selectivity. In our previous work [10], the one-pot aqueous phase reforming by low cost Pt–Ru bimetallic catalyst for hydrogen and reducing sugar production was proposed. In this study, a potential process of biomass hydrolysis by the aqueous phase reforming to obtain high concentration of reducing sugar as well as bio-hydrogen production simultaneously was proposed. The effects of the experimental parameters and the conversion of biomass, yield of reducing sugar, concentration of the reducing sugar in aqueous phase, and yield of bio-hydrogen were investigated."
1,Materials and methods,"α-cellulose (Sigma, CAS No. 9004-34-6) was used as the substrate for the aqueous phase reaction without any further treatment. The reaction was carried out in a stainless steel batch reactor. In a typical batch of the reaction, water, substrate, catalyst, and acid were added into an autoclave reactor at the weight ratio of 20:1:0.1:0.05 or 20:1:0.03 (without catalyst) and the reaction temperature were controlled from 100 to 235 °C. 0.5% Pt/Al2O3 (1/8″, Alfa Aesar) [8,11] was used as the catalyst for the aqueous phase reforming. To determine the optimum reaction condition, the weight ratio of water to biomass (10–60 g/g), acids (Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and maleic acid), and the reaction temperature (100–235 °C) were varied. Prior each course of the reaction, the reactor was purged with argon. Reactor temperature was then heated from room temperature to the designated temperature with a heating rate of 1 °C/min and hold for additional 3 h. Different agriculture biomass will be used for the further studies. At the end of the reaction, the gas phase was sampled and analyzed by the gas chromatograph (G.C., GC-1000, Chinese Chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, TCD) to determine the hydrogen and carbon dioxide yield. Moreover, the aqueous phase reducing sugar concentration was determined by the DNS reagent (3,5-dinitrosalicil acid) [11] and then analyzed by the spectrophotometer (Genesys 20, Thermo Spectro) to determine the yield of reducing sugar. Glucose was used as the standard to calibrate the concentration of the reducing sugar concentration in the aqueous product. The solid phase sample (residue) were washed, dried, and weighted to determine the biomass conversion."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Aqueous phase reforming for reducing sugar formation,"3.1 Aqueous phase reforming for reducing sugar formation Fig. 1 shows the reducing sugar yield and the conversion of biomass of the preliminary studies by the diluted-acid hydrolysis with various acids. Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and maleic acid were used as the hydrolysis promoter and tested in the reactions, where the test of no acid added was also performed for the comparative purpose. In the preliminary studies, the weight ratio of water:biomass:acid was controlled of 20:1:0.03 at different temperature. Besides, no Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was employed in the preliminary studies. Fig. 1a show that a maximum value of the yield of reducing sugar was attained by adding acids along with the increment of reaction temperature. At the same reaction temperature, the conversion of biomass was at the order of the presence of nitric acid ≈ hydrochloric acid > sulfuric acid ≈ maleic acid > deionized water (no acid adding). It deserved noticing that after the maximum reducing sugar yield was attained, it decreased drastically which was suggested to the occurrence of side reaction (xylose dehydration). In general, a monotonic increasing relation between the biomass conversion and the reaction temperature was observed in Fig. 1b. The high concentration of reducing sugar was good for employing in the fermentation process, although it may be needed some other treatments to remove the inhibitor, such as furfural. The results showed the maximum yield of reducing sugar was 0.52 g/g-cellulose, which is equivalent to 26.01 g/L of concentration with adding hydrochloric acid and reacted at 170 °C. The high concentration of reducing sugar solution was found to be able to immediately employ in fermentation process without any other pretreatments. It was interesting noticing that hydrogen was also found in this study of adding sulfuric acid; however, hydrogen was not detected in the other cases. In the case of adding sulfuric acid, carbon dioxide was also detected in the gas phase sample. It had to mention that since the pressure gauge was not installed over the autoclave reactor in the preliminary studies, the yield of hydrogen production could not be well determined. Further studies (see in section 3.2) will be then studied on biomass hydrolysis and reforming reaction to obtain the yield of reducing sugar and hydrogen with another modified autoclave reactor by adding sulfuric acid and the catalyst in the reaction."
4,Hydrogen production by the aqueous phase reforming,"3.2 Hydrogen production by the aqueous phase reforming To elucidate the effects of the reaction parameters for the yield of reducing sugar and hydrogen in the hydrolysis and reforming reaction, series reactions were studied. In a typical batch of the reaction, water, substrate, catalyst (0.5 wt % Pt/Al2O3), and sulfuric acid were added together into a modified autoclave reactor at the weight ratio of 400:20:2:1, and the reaction temperature were ranging from 195 to 235 °C. The results were shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2a, it shows the yield (g-reducing sugar/g-cellulose) and the concentration (g/L) of reducing sugar, and the biomass conversion in the aqueous phase; in Fig. 2b, it shows the yield of bio-hydrogen and carbon dioxide (mmol/g-cellulose) in the gas phase. The results showed that the conversion of the biomass was increased at a higher reaction temperature. (Fig. 2a) However, the yield of the reducing sugar in the aqueous solution was not increased in parallel. A monotonic increasing relation between the yield of hydrogen (mmol/g) and temperature was also observed. 0.9098 mmol/g of hydrogen at the temperature of 235 °C was obtained, which is equivalent to the value of the reported results [8]. Although the conversion of the biomass was monotonic increasing with the reaction temperature, the yield and the concentration of reducing sugar were not increased as well. It was suggested by the side reaction was occurred and consumed reducing sugar to generate complicated organic compounds at higher temperature. The concentration of the reducing sugar was dropped from 3.74 g/L at 195 °C to 2.19 g/L at 235 °C, indicated that reaction was not favored to the formation of the reducing sugar at a higher temperature. Series side reactions may also be occurred. Literature results [12] also suggested that the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials with the presence of the acid and the ionic solution could enhance the conversion and the yield of the reducing sugar and the values were higher than those of current studies. However, the acid content in the solution was much higher than that of current study. Further treatment to remove the extra anions should be expected if the solution will be used for the fermentation process. Besides the formation of hydrogen in the gas phase, CO2 was another important product. The yield of hydrogen was 0.0944 mmol/g and the yield of CO2 was 0.5200 mmol/g at the reaction temperature of 195 °C. Both yields of hydrogen and CO2 were increased at a higher reaction temperature. To have a better understanding the selectivity of the products, yield ratios were defined as the yield of hydrogen or CO2 at any given temperature to that at 195 °C to elucidate selectivity of the reformed products and the results were shown in Fig. 2b. Although CO2 was the other component in the product stream, hydrogen became more selective than that of CO2 at a higher temperature under the reaction condition."
5,The effects of water to biomass ratio,"3.3 The effects of water to biomass ratio Besides the effects of the reaction temperature, water to biomass ratio was also studied. Fig. 3 showed the results with respect to different ratios at reaction temperature of 225 °C. It showed that the biomass conversion and the yield of reducing sugar were increased along with the water to biomass ratio. However, the concentration of the reducing sugar was not increased accordingly. The apparent results may simply contribute to the dilution effects toward to the completion of the reaction. For the hydrogen production, a maximum yield of hydrogen production (0.8826 mmol/g) was attained at the water to biomass ratio of 20. This ratio was a key factor to attain the maximum yield of hydrogen. Excess water to the reaction did not help to enhance the yield of hydrogen."
6,The effects of catalyst,"3.4 The effects of catalyst In the preliminary studies, hydrolysis of the biomass was carried out without adding the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. By adding 5 wt% sulfuric acid/biomass with catalyst into the reaction solution at the temperature of 195–225 °C were also studied and the results were shown in Fig. 4 . In comparison with the results of adding catalyst into the reaction, there were no significantly differences of the biomass conversion. The concentrations of the reducing sugar were a little bit different from the results by adding catalyst; however, they were at the same bulk range. Considering the yield of hydrogen, the cases with adding catalyst were much higher than those without catalyst. It seems that the catalyst helped the reaction toward to the formation of hydrogen and the yield of hydrogen was increased with the reaction temperature. Therefore, the presence of sulfuric and the catalyst were the key factors for the hydrogen production in the biomass aqueous phase reforming."
7,The effect of biomass in the reforming,"3.5 The effect of biomass in the reforming Besides the commercially available biomass, α-cellulose, the energy crop and agriculture waste were also used as the substrate for the reforming reaction. Napiergrass, cotton, wood saw dust (Philippine lauan), rice straw, and paper pulp were compared. The raw materials were dried and grounded into fine powder prior loading into the reactor. Water, substrate, catalyst, and sulfuric acid were added together into an autoclave reactor with the weight ratio of 400 (522 for cotton):20:2:1, and the reaction temperature was fixed at 225 °C. The results were shown in Fig. 5 . Current results suggested that cotton and paper pulp were the materials with very high cellulose contents and leading to a higher conversion of the biomass. The yield of the reducing sugar was higher than that in comparison with the α-cellulose of all substrates; except the case of using paper pulp. Hydrogen was also found in all cases and the yield was shown in Fig. 5. The yields of hydrogen were 0.8826, 0.018700, 0.3618, 0.2651, 0.02160, and 0.3882 mmol/g for α-cellulose, napiergrass, cotton, wood saw dust, rice straw and paper pulp, respectively. Thus, it is possible to use this method to produce bio-hydrogen and reducing sugar simultaneously by a one-step hydrothermal chemical process. Since the reducing sugars were also formed from hydrolysis of cellulose, current results were agreed that the conversion of the biomass was depending on the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents in the agriculture biomass. Higher conversion of the biomass did not lead to a higher yield of the reducing sugar in the solution as well as hydrogen in the gas phase. Further studies will be expected in the future."
8,Conclusion,"A hydrothermal chemical process for the simultaneous biomass hydrolysis and bio-hydrogen production was proposed. The results showed that a maximum reducing sugar concentration of 26.01 g/L and yield of bio-hydrogen of 0.9098 mmol/g-cellulose was attained. This study provided a potential route for the bio-hydrogen and reducing sugar production simultaneously in a one-step reaction process using the energy crops or the agriculture wastes as the substrate. Current studies suggested that a monotonic increasing of the biomass conversion and the reaction temperature was found for all series studies. However, the yield of the reducing sugar was not increased at a higher temperature. The result of the reforming reaction without adding the catalyst, a maximum reducing sugar concentration was attained at the temperature lower than 200 °C. A maximum yield and concentration of the reducing sugar were attained of 0.5202 g/g, 26.01 g/L in the hydrolysate, at the temperature of 170 °C with adding hydrochloric acid. A maximum yield of hydrogen production was also attained of 0.9098 mmol/g at the temperature of 235 °C with water to biomass ratio of 20 and with sulfuric acid as hydrolysis promoter. Hydrogen can only be detected for the cases of sulfuric acid and/or catalyst added in the reaction of all current studies. In comparison with the conversion of biomass and the yield of the reducing sugar suggesting future studies should be focused on the composition analysis of the aqueous phase and the total carbon balance in the reactions to reveal the mechanism of biomass hydrolysis and the bio-hydrogen formation."
