0,Introduction,"Given the high efficiency of hydrogen oxidation in fuel cells and its cleanness, hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising alternative fuels [1]. Hydrogen may be produced by several ways including reforming of hydrocarbons [2–4] and alcohols [5–8], gasification of coal or biomass [9,10], and the electrolysis or thermochemical decomposition of water [11,12]. Hydrocarbons and alcohols reforming typically yield a mixture of hydrogen, CO, CO2 and H2O. The hydrogen produced can then either be separated, or utilized with CO as synthesis gas for the downstream production of a number of fuels and chemicals. The diversity of synthesis gas applications include its use as a feedstock of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) for liquid fuels production [13] and the synthesis of a variety of chemicals including methanol, ammonia, olefin, etc [14,15]. Among the various hydrocarbons, propane is attracting considerable attention in hydrogen production studies primarily because it is a major constituent of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [16,17]. The advantage of LPG is that it is inexpensive and reported to exhibit properties (with respect to heavier feedstocks) which enhance resistance of the catalyst to deactivation due to carbon deposition during reforming [18]. In addition, propane is produced in relative high amounts from natural gas and oil crude refining. For pressures of approximately 9 bar, it is in liquid state and can be easily stored and distributed [19,20]. Hydrogen can be generated through different propane reforming routes, such as dry reforming (DR), steam reforming (SR) and oxidative steam reforming (OSR). Various catalysts have been studied in propane reforming, including nickel-based [21–29] and noble metal-based catalysts (Pt, Rh, Pd, etc.) [4,16,17,30–33]. Regarding propane DR, Olsbye et al. [21–23] reported an exceptionally stable Ni/Mg(Al)O hydrotalcite-derived catalyst. The intrinsic activity of catalysts depended strongly on Ni particle size. Further mechanistic studies showed C–C bond rupture is the rate determining step. Solymosi et al. [30–32] compared the performance of noble metal-based Pt, Rh and Ru catalysts and concluded the highest specific rates for H2 and CO production were over Rh and Ru catalysts. Investigating a bimetallic Co–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in both DR and SR of propane, it was reported that carbon deposition was the main cause of catalyst deactivation [24,25]. In the case of SR, separate studies on the effects of preparation method and lanthanide elements on propane SR performance of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts were reported [26–28]. With respects to OSR of propane, Rh/Al2O3 [4,17], Ce1−xNixO2 [29], Pt/CeO2 [16] and Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 [33] were investigated by different groups. Most of the efforts in terms of hydrogen production from propane reforming, however, have been focused on the research and development of catalysts. Like the extensive thermodynamic studies on the reforming of methane [34], methanol [35], ethanol [36], glycerol [37] and butanol [38], a detailed thermodynamic analysis of propane reforming is essential to provide a set of parameters to maximize the hydrogen production and/or propane conversion, through which, further experimental work can be guided. Of particular relevance to this work, Li et al. [39] reported a thermodynamic analysis of propane OSR and concluded that close to 9 mol of hydrogen can be produced per mole of propane at oxidation conditions and for thermo–neutral condition at 973 K, an appropriate water to propane ratio (WPR) between 7 and 13 is favourable for achieving a high hydrogen yield. To the best of our knowledgement, however, no thermodynamic analysis has been published regarding DR and SR of propane. In this paper, we report the first thermodynamic analysis of DR and SR of propane, where total Gibbs free energy minimization method was employed to calculate equilibrium compositions. The effects of process variables such as pressure, temperature and reactant ratio [carbon dioxide to propane ratio (CPR) and WPR] were studied and the carbon formation was also illustrated. Propane DR is shown, from a thermodynamic point of view, to be promising for synthesis gas production with low hydrogen content whereas SR of propane displays considerable potential for generation of synthesis gas with high hydrogen content."
1,Methodology,"The method of thermodynamic analysis by minimization of Gibbs free energy was introduced in our previous publications [7,37,40] and was also reported in detail by other groups [8,34–36,38,39]. At low pressure and high temperature, the system can be considered as ideal [35,36]. The total Gibbs function for a system is given as follows: (1) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i G ¯ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ ¯ i = ∑ n i G i 0 + R T ∑ n i ln f ˆ i f i 0 For reaction equilibria in gas phase, f ˆ i = ϕ ˆ i y i P , f i 0 = P 0 , and since G i 0 is set equal to zero for each chemical element in its standard-state, Δ G 0 = Δ G f i 0 for each component is assumed. The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed as Eqs. (2) and (3), with the Lagrange’s undetermined multiplier method. (2) Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ ˆ i y i p p 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (3) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T ln ϕ ˆ i y i p p 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 With the constraints of elemental balances: (4) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = A k When solid carbon is considered in the system, Eq. (5) is used in the calculations. Carbon formation in gas phase reactions can be estimated by exploiting the phase equilibrium existed between solid carbon and carbon vapour in the gas phase. Considering all carbon to be in graphite form with the free energy of formation as zero and to have no vapour pressure in the range of temperatures studied in this work, then the total Gibbs free energy can be considered to be independent of carbon. However, the calculations of carbon amount can be included in the elemental balance, i.e. Eq. (4). (5) n C Δ G f C ( s ) 0 = 0 The primary species involved in propane DR and SR are C3H8, H2O, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and carbon (graphite) [39]. The most occurring species, including H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and carbon [4,16,17,21,22,24–29,39], together with C3H8 and H2O were considered in this work. The thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed utilizing the chemical reaction and equilibrium software Outokumpu HSC Chemistry 4.0, using the extensive thermochemical database delivered in the software package [41]. Gibbs module of this software is usually used to directly calculate product compositions at equilibrium employing the total Gibbs free energy minimization method. The initial amount of propane was assumed to be 1 mol. Thermodynamic analysis was carried out over the following variable ranges: pressure 1–5 atm, temperature 700–1100 K, CPR 1–12 for DR and WPR 1–18 for SR. As a theoretical study, reaction kinetics, reactor design and operation were not considered here."
2,Results and discussion,"Complete conversion of propane was obtained for the range of pressure, temperature, CPR and WPR considered in this study. Fig. 1 describes moles of hydrogen produced per mole of propane from DR and SR of propane at selected pressures. For both SR and DR, numbers of moles of hydrogen produced decrease with an increase in pressure. It can be attributed to the overall reactions of propane DR and SR, of which numbers of moles increase during the reactions, respectively [see Eqs. (6) and (7)]. Low pressure favours the reaction and high pressure can reduce the capacity of hydrogen production significantly. As superior hydrogen production was achieved, atmospheric pressure was selected accordingly throughout the following discussion. Moreover, Fig. 1 provides a first indication that, in general, more hydrogen can be produced from SR than DR at the same temperature."
3,Possible reactions of propane dry and steam reforming,3.1 Possible reactions of propane dry and steam reforming The reactions of DR and SR of propane can be expressed as follows.The overall reaction of propane DR and SR: (6) C 3 H 8 + 3 CO 2 ↔ 6 CO + 4 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 620 kJ / mol (7) C 3 H 8 + 6 H 2 O ↔ 3 CO 2 + 10 H 2 Δ H 298 K = 374 kJ / mol Other possible reactions are shown as follows: Water gas shift (WGS): (8) CO + H 2 O ↔ H 2 + CO 2 Δ H 298 K = − 41 kJ / mol Methanation: (9) CO + 3 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 206 kJ / mol (10) CO 2 + 4 H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 165 kJ / mol Methane CO2 reforming: (11) CO 2 + CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + 2 CO Δ H 298 K = 247 kJ / mol Propane cracking and carbon formation [33]: (12) C 3 H 8 ↔ C 2 H 4 + CH 4 Δ H 298 K = 89 kJ / mol (13) C 2 H 4 ↔ 2 C + 2 H 2 Δ H 298 K = − 52 kJ / mol (14) H 2 + CO ↔ C + H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 131 kJ / mol (15) CH 4 ↔ 2 H 2 + C Δ H 298 K = 75 kJ / mol (16) 2 CO ↔ CO 2 + C Δ H 298 K = − 172 kJ / mol (17) 2 H 2 + CO 2 ↔ C + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K = − 90 kJ / mol
4,Propane dry reforming,"3.2 Propane dry reforming One of the potential advantages of the dry reforming route is the attendant reduction in overall green-house gas (GHG) emission due to CO2 utilization [24]. Therefore, the conversion of CO2 needs to be considered and discussed. Fig. 2 shows the conversion of CO2 as a function of CPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. CO2 conversion decreases with an increase in CPR. For a given CPR that is more than 3 (stoichiometric ratio), high temperature favours CO2 conversion. This can be ascribed to the highly endothermic reaction of propane DR. The optimal condition for CO2 conversion is achieved with temperatures over 1000 K and CPRs ≤ 6, where over 60% conversion can be achieved. Consequently, the highest CO2 conversion is 95% which can be obtained at 1100 K and CPR = 1. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , moles of hydrogen increase with increasing temperature steadily when CPR is less than 3; whereas when CPR is higher than 3, the number of moles of hydrogen increases with increasing temperature, goes through maximum around 925–1025 K, and then starts to decrease at higher temperatures. The effect of CPR on hydrogen production is not significant when it is less than 6, but high CPRs reduce the capacity of hydrogen production when temperature is higher than 925 K. More than 3 mol of hydrogen (4 mol in theory) can be generated at CPRs between 1 and 6 over 1000 K. Fig. 4 shows moles of CO produced as a function of CPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. High CPR and high temperature favour CO production. This high concentration of CO in equilibrium compositions is not feasible for further application of hydrogen in fuel cell directly. But it provides a good opportunity for synthesis gas production. The required molar ratio of H2 to CO varies depending on the desired product and fuel processing technology. In the synthesis of methanol, the desirable synthesis gas composition is best characterized by a H2/CO ratio of about 2 [42]. The ratios equal to 1.7 and 2.15 are suitable for FTS [43]. Furthermore, a H2/CO ratio of 1 is desirable for direct use as a feedstock for FTS to produce liquid fuels [44]. Oxosynthesis and other processes such as dimethyl ether synthesis generally require a H2/CO ratio of 1 [45]. Fig. 5 describes the ratios of H2/CO at different temperatures and CPRs at atmospheric pressure. From propane DR, quite a variety of H2/CO ratios which favour downstream synthesis of different fuels and chemicals can be obtained. This process also provides a wide and flexible range of operating parameters for synthesis gas production in industry. For instance, a H2/CO ratio of 2 can be achieved at 800 (CPR = 6) and 875 K (CPR = 3); and a H2/CO ratio of 1 can be attained at 875 (CPR = 6) and 975 K (CPR = 3). The ratios of H2/CO decrease with increasing temperature and CPR. There are two optimum conditions for synthesis gas production: the first one is 975 K and CPR = 3, at which 6.1 mol of synthesis gas (H2/CO = 1:1) can be produced with a CO2 conversion of 71%; the other one is 1100 K and CPR = 1, where 5.5 mol of synthesis gas (H2/CO = 2:1) can be produced with a CO2 conversion of 95%. Nearly 10 mol of synthesis gas can be produced per mole of propane when CPR is higher than 6 over 1000 K. Although the H2/CO ratios are less than 1 then, it will be preferable in some synthesis [46,47]. For hydrogen and/or synthesis gas production, it is apparent that CH4 is not a desirable product as the production of CH4 competes with hydrogen generation [34]. Fig. 6 depicts moles of CH4 produced from DR of propane as a function of CPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. Moles of CH4 decrease with the increase in both temperature and CPR. High temperatures and CPRs, which are suitable for generating large quantity of synthesis gas, also favour the inhibition of CH4 production. The maximum number of moles of CH4 produced is only around 1 mol. The existence of carbon can poison catalysts in reforming reactions [48]. The elimination of carbon, from a thermodynamic point of view, was therefore analysed in this work. As can be seen from Fig. 7 , carbon formation is almost stable regardless of the temperature when CPR = 1. However, high CPRs favour the inhibition of carbon formation at a temperature above 825 K. Carbon formation can also be eliminated under conditions where the maximum amount of synthesis gas can be obtained."
5,Propane steam reforming,"3.3 Propane steam reforming Fig. 8 illustrates moles of hydrogen produced per mole of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. In the SR of propane, the number of moles of hydrogen increases steadily with increasing temperature when WPR is less than 6. It is consistent with the experimental study reported by Barison et al. [49], where hydrogen yield was observed to increase with increasing temperature from 873 to 1073 K at WPR = 2.5. For a given WPR (more than 6), however, the amount of hydrogen produced at equilibrium increases with an increase in temperature until a peak temperature (925–975 K). Further increasing temperature leads to a declining trend. The greatest quantity of hydrogen (9.1 mol) is produced at 925 K with a WPR of 18; this is superior to that achieved from DR. Moles of hydrogen increase steadily with increasing WPR. Although high WPR enhances the reforming performance significantly, it is believed that higher WPRs require higher reactor volume due to higher steam volumetric flow. In addition, higher water content also consumes higher input heat duty because of higher vaporization energy. Moreover, the benefit in terms of hydrogen production from an increase in WPR from 12 to 18 becomes marginal. From a thermodynamic perspective, the optimum condition for hydrogen production is, therefore, a WPR of 12 at around 950 K and atmospheric pressure. Fig. 9 describes moles of CO produced per mole of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. For a given WPR in SR of propane, CO production increases as the temperature increases. This can be attributed to the exothermicity of WGS reaction; high temperature does not favour the conversion of CO. High WPRs favour the production of CO when WPR is less than 6 (stoichiometric ratio), however, moles of CO decrease with a further increase in WPR. The maximum amount of CO produced is only 2.7 mol, which is far less than 7.9 mol obtained in DR. As discussed above, the H2 to CO ratio is critical for downstream utilization of synthesis gas. Unfortunately, the H2 to CO ratios (shown in Fig. 10 ) of synthesis gas obtained from SR are far beyond the required values for direct use in fuels and chemicals production. Therefore, SR is more feasible for hydrogen production. Fig. 11 depicts moles of CH4 produced from SR of propane as a function of WPR and temperature at atmospheric pressure. Generally, moles of CH4 decrease with the increase in both temperature and WPR. High temperatures and WPRs, which are suitable for hydrogen production, can also inhibit the production of CH4. Thermodynamically, CH4 production can be inhibited almost entirely over 950 K with WPRs more than 12. As can be seen from Fig. 12 , high WPRs favour the inhibition of carbon formation from SR of propane and a WPR of 6 is high enough to avoid carbon production throughout the temperature range considered in this study. From a thermodynamic perspective, carbon formation should be eliminated with any WPRs greater than 6 (stoichiometric ratio) regardless of the temperature. Compared with DR, SR of propane is, in general, not favourable for carbon production. The problem of carbon formation can be mitigated by the presence of steam in the process. No carbon will be produced under conditions which are optimized for hydrogen production."
6,Conclusion,"Thermodynamic features of DR and SR of propane have been investigated with the method of Gibbs free energy minimization. The effects of pressure, temperature, CPR and WPR on the equilibrium compositions and carbon formation were studied. Results show that, from a thermodynamic point of view, DR is promising for production of synthesis gas with low hydrogen content whereas SR displays considerable potential for generation of synthesis gas with high hydrogen content. Complete conversion of propane was obtained for the range of pressure, temperature, CPR and WPR considered in this study. Atmospheric pressure is feasible for both DR and SR of propane. Approximately 10 mol of synthesis gas can be produced over 1000 K from DR of propane when CPR is higher than 6. The optimal conditions for synthesis gas production are: 975 K and CPR = 3, at which 6.1 mol of synthesis gas (H2/CO = 1:1) can be produced with a CO2 conversion of 71%; 1100 K and CPR = 1, where 5.5 mol of synthesis gas (H2/CO = 2:1) can be obtained with a CO2 conversion of 95%. The most favourable conditions for hydrogen production from SR are achieved with the temperatures and WPRs of 925–975 K and 12–18, respectively. The maximum number of moles of hydrogen produced is 9.1 (925 K and WPR = 18). Under these conditions that are suitable for hydrogen production, methane and carbon formation can be effectively eliminated. Future work will focus on experimentally validating the findings of this work over nickel-based catalyst [48] derived from Ni/Mg/Al hydrotalcite-like compounds."
