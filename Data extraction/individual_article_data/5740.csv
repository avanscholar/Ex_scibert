0,Introduction,"Supported single-atom metal catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to its utmost atom efficiency and well-defined active sites for a variety of heterogeneous catalytic applications [1–10], including electrocatalysis [2,11] and photocatalysis [12–15]. However, efficient, controllable and large-scale synthesis of stable, highly dispersed single-atom metal catalysts is still a very challenging task. The large surface energy of single metal atom on the support inevitably induces its aggregation, which leads to the formation of metal nanoclusters and even large metal nanoparticles, in particular, under harsh reaction conditions [16,17]. There are two technical hurdles that need to be overcome. The first one is to find a general and facile approach for preparing the uniformly distributed SACs; the other one is to enhance the stability of as-prepared SACs under harsh reaction conditions. To meet this end, the interaction between the single metal atom and the supporting meatrials, which is controlled by the geometric and electronic properties of supporting metarials, plays the crucial role. Therefore, finding a suitable supporting metarials with specific morphology and structure, which provides the unique hosting environment for single metal atoms and the strong electronic intercation between supporting metarials and single metal atoms, is highly desired for single-atom catalysis [1,8,18,19]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are a class of porous crystalline solid materials, have emerged as one of the very promising supporting materials for highly dispersed metal catalysts, largely due to its feasible introduction of metal species to tunable inorganic metal nodes/organic ligands that provide suitable coordination sites for metal atoms [3,20–26]. In the first category, MOF materials had been used to prepare the porous carbon-based single-atom metal catalysts [27,28]. Since the crystal structures of MOFs were destroyed under high temperature by pyrolysis treatments, the active single-atom sites in theses pyrolyzed MOFs cannot be accurately designed at the atomic level although excellent electrochemical performance. In the second category of MOFs supported single-atom metal catalysts, specific functional groups or ligands were introduced by post-synthetic modification treatments for anchoring single metal atoms in the ordered building units of versatile inorganic metal nodes/organic ligands of MOFs [29–32]. Since the crystal structures of MOFs were still maintained, the synthesized MOF-based single-atom metal catalysts were generally homogeneously distributed with well-defined active sites/positions. It has been reported that the porphyrin with four pyrrolic nitrogen sites in the square-planar structure of MOFs can effectively trap single metal atoms by coordination [13,33,34]. Similar to four-coordination in porphyrin unit, the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with six binding sites: four hard carboxyl and two relatively soft tertiary amine groups that are open chelating ligand also can provide four-coordination (two nitrogen and two oxygen atoms) for strongly binding single metal ions by the facile capture process. Therefore, the EDTA based MOFs might be ideal platforms for the intercalation of single atom sites to prepare SACs. Recently, we have developed a broad-spectrum heavy metal ion trap method using MOF-808-EDTA (MOF-based trap, MBT) materials for removing 22 heavy metal ions with the removal efficiency of ≥99% [35]. Inspired by this work, it is naturally evolved that this MBT materials could serve as a novel synthesis approach for preparing MOF-based SACs. This is due to the fact that the immobilized EDTA ligands anchored at the metal nodes would capture single metal ions and maintain this configuration after hydrogen activation. Herein, we first proposed that the MOF-based ion trap approach can be used to serve as a general and operable synthesis platform for stable, highly dispersed, and well-defined positioned single-atom metal catalysts. This is demonstrated with MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. As shown in Scheme 1 , using this MOF-based ion trap approach, MBT capture single Pt2+ ions to prepare well-defined positioned single Pt atom catalysts under H2 atmosphere at 200 °C. The as-synthesized single Pt atom catalysts show the excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, high apparent quantum efficiency, and high stability. This novel approach for preparing a series of MBT based single metal catalysts including noble metals and non-noble metals will be beneficial to many other catalytic applications."
1,Experimental and computational details,
2,Synthesis of MBT,"2.1 Synthesis of MBT A mixture of trimesic acid (H3BTC) (2.1 g, 10 mmol) and ZrOCl2·8H2O (9.7 g, 30 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF)/formic acid (450 mL/450 mL) within a 1 L screw-capped glass jar, which was heated to 130 °C for two days. The as-synthesized MOF-808 was then rinsed with DMF and acetone, and dried in vacuum at 150 °C. The 0.100 g of MOF-808 and 1.860 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) was added to 50 mL H2O at 60 °C for 24 h. After being filtrated and washed with H2O for several times, a white precipitate MOF-808-EDTA (MBT) was obtained."
3,Synthesis of Pt-SACs/MBT,"2.2 Synthesis of Pt-SACs/MBT The introduction of Pt metal into MOF-808-EDTA was quite facile. Firstly, about 200 mL Pt nitrate (Pt(NO3)2) solution with 10 ppm Pt2+ concentration (CPt2+) was added into 200 mg MBT sample at room temperature. After 6 h, this mixture was centrifugated at 10000 rpm for 5 min and washed with H2O for three times. After drying this sample in vacuum at 60 °C, the MBT encapsulated single Pt2+ ions (Pt2+-SAs/MBT) sample was obtained. The Pt2+-SAs/MBT can then be activated under a flowing H2 atmosphere for 2 h, obtaining the MBT encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst (Pt-SACs/MBT). Using the same preparation method, Pd-SACs/MBT, Rh-SACs/MBT, Ru-SACs/MBT, Cu-SACs/MBT, Ni-SACs/MBT and Co-SACs/MBT were prepared by replacing Pt(NO3)2 with the same concentration of Pd(NO3)2, RhCl3, RuCl3·3H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O respectively. By adding 200 mL Pt nitrate solution with CPt2+ = 20 ppm into the as-prepared MBT, it was found that, except for a portion of Pt2+ ions were captured by EDTA ligands forming Pt2+-SAs/MBT, the additional Pt2+ ions would be hydrolyzed and converted to Pt4+ in the form of PtO2 monomers in the solution, which would adsorb and segregate at the MBT framework, leading to the formation of co-existing PtO2 nanoclusters/MBT (PtO2-NCs/MBT). Upon further activated with H2 at 200 °C, the resulting Pt nanoclusters/MBT (Pt-NCs/MBT) was obtained. The Pt-NPs/MOF catalyst was prepared by an in situ photodeposition procedure using 3 wt% H2PtCl6 solution as the precursor. Typically, 500 mg of the as-prepared MBT were dispersed in 100 mL deionized water. An aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (30 mg) was added into the MBT dispersion under stirring. The mixture was then irradiated by a 350 W Xe lamp to prepare Pt-NPs/MOF. After 30 min irradiation, the Pt-NPs/MOF was collected by centrifugation, further washed by deionized water, and then dried at 80 °C overnight in vacuum oven. The amount of Pt was determined 1.52 wt% by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)."
4,Characterizations,"2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on D8 Advanced X diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA, with 2θ ranging between 5° and 50° at a scanning rate of 0.5° min−1. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by Autosorb-IQ-MP (Quantachrome Instruments). The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope that worked at 200 kV and a JEOL JEM-ARM200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector that worked at 300 kV. The results of XPS were obtained by using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. The All XPS spectra were corrected using C 1s line at 284.6 eV, and curve fitting and background subtraction were accomplished. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectra were collected on a Vector 22 (Bruker) spectrophotometer with KBr discs. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) analysis was carried out by an STA-449F3 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from ambient temperature to 800 °C under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The amount of Pt was determined by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) absorbance spectra were tested by Shimadzu UV-3101 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–600 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were observed on a FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of Pt K-edge were performed at 1W1B station in Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), and electron storage ring was operated at 2.5 GeV with 250 mA."
5,Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity measurement,"2.4 Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity measurement Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were performed by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV cut-off filter (>420 nm). Fabricated catalysts (5 mg) were dispersed into 40 mL de-ionized water with 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial reagent, and 5 mg Eosin Y (EY) as a photosensitizer. The generated hydrogen was analyzed using gas chromatography (Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd, 7920) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured as follow, AQE = 2 ∗ mole of hydrogen evolved / mole of incident photon ∗ 100 % Electrochemical characterizations were performed with CHI 760E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Co., China) with an AM-1.5 filter in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. 10 mg of the catalysts were dispersed in 500 μL water, 480 μL alcohol and 20 μL 5% Nafion by sonication to form a homogeneous suspension. The 5 μL suspension was dropped on the 3 mm glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode with saturated KCl. A carbon electrode were used as reference and counter electrode, respectively. The photocurrent density versus time (J–t) curves at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl were performed in the dark and under light irradiation. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) tests were performed at open circuit potential over the frequency range between 105 and 10−2 Hz. Mott–Schottky plots were measured at the frequency of 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz with the potential ranging between −1.0 ∼ 1.0 V."
6,Computational details,"2.5 Computational details All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using QUICKSTEP program within the CP2K code employing a mixed Gaussian and planewave basis sets [36]. Core electrons were represented with norm-conserving Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials [37–39], and the valence electron wavefunction was expanded in a double zeta basis set with polarization functions along with an auxiliary plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 Ry [40]. The generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Enzerhof (PBE) was used [41]. To account for the van der Waals (vdW) interaction, the DFT-D3 scheme with an empirical damped potential term was added into the energies obtained from exchange-correlation functional in the calculations. The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm with self-consistent field convergence criteria of 1.0 × 10−8 au was used in geometrical optimizations. Test calculations showed that the energy change was negligible (<0.01 eV) when the maximum force convergence criteria of 0.001 hartree/bohr was used. As aforementioned, the addition of EDTA molecules into synthesized MOF-808 system would result in the ligand exchanging between formate (HCOO) anionic ligands on at the zicornium (Zr6) metal cluster nodes with EDTA anoins. To estimate the number of anionic HCOO ligands replaced by EDTA, we calculated the exchange energy involving this repalcement process Δ E exchange = E Zr 6 cluster node + 6 - n HCOO + nEDTA + n E HCOO - E Zr 6 cluster node + 6 HCOO + n E EDTA where EZr6 cluster node+(6-n)HCOO+nEDTA is the total energy of the number (n) of EDTA exchanged with the same number (n) of HCOO anionic ligands on a Zr6 metal cluster node; EZr6 cluster node+6HCOO is the total enengy of the original Zr6 metal cluster node with six HCOO anionic ligands; EHCOO and EEDTA is the energies of one single HCOO and EDTA anion in vacuum respectively. The negative value of ΔEexchange indicate this exchange process is thermodynamically favorable. To further understand the possibility of the EDTA ligand exchanging other larger ligands such as acetate in MOF-808, we also calculated the exchange energies of EDTA with acetate using the same method. The adsorption energy of a single Pt atom at EDTA ligand or the neighboring sites at the Zr6 metal cluster node in the MBT architeture is defined as Δ E Pt = E Pt / MBT - E MBT - E Single Pt atom where EPt/MBT and EMBT are the total enegies of the adsorbed single Pt atom on the MBT system and the pure MBT system, respectively. ESingle Pt atom is the enegy of a single Pt atom in vacuum. Following the method proposed in the previous work [13], the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity can be described by the hydrogen binding free energy (ΔGH*), which is calculated as follows D G H ∗ = D E H ∗ + D E ZPE - TDS where ΔEH is the DFT calculated hydrogen adsorption energy; ΔEZPE and ΔS are the zero point energy correction and the entropy difference, which both are referenced to a hydrogen molecule atom in vacuum, respectively. T is the system temperature (298.15 K)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterizations of MBT,"3.1 Characterizations of MBT The periodic MOF-808 structure used in this work was taken from the experimental single crystal XRD results reported by Furukawa et al. [42]. As shown in Fig. S1 (supporting information), this periodic MOF-808 system contains 1280 atoms with the formula of C384H288O512Zr96. The simulation cell is cubic with a length of 35.0764 Å. Each metal node of the periodic MOF-808 is terminated with six formate groups. During the optimization, all atoms in the periodic MOF-808 structure are allowed to relax. On the basis of the optimized MOF-808 structure, a model containing the Zr6 metal cluster node, which partially mimics the periodic MOF-808, was built further study of ligand exchange with EDTA and adsorption of Pt2+ ions and PtO2 monomers. In the calculations of MBT, all atoms in the structure are also fully relaxed. The MBT was obtained by the postsynthetic modification of MOF-808 using the solvent assisted linker exchanged method [43]. As shown in Fig. S2 (supporting information), DFT calculated exchange energyies are −410, −253, and −110 kJ/mol for one, two, and three EDTA replacements, respectively. While the fourth EDTA exchange is thermodynamically unfavorable (+323 kJ/mol) due to large repulsive interactions between these ligands. In addition, various configurations with different numbers and positons of exchanged EDTA ligands on the Zr6 metal node were calculated using DFT. It has been noted that the EDTA ligands would prefer to exchange with HCOO groups in the separate positonsing, not in the neighbioring positions due to the to large repulsive interactions between EDTA ligands. At most three EDTA ligands could be thermodynamically exchanged with HCOO groups. This is consistent with our previous experimental estimation that about 2 ∼ 3 HCOO groups could be exchanged with the introduced EDTA molecules [35]. Similarly, we also studied the possibility of EDTA exchanging with a larger ligand, i.e., acetate. As shown in Figs. S3 and S4, the calculated exchange energies also suggest that at most three acetate ligands at the Zr6 metal cluster node could be replaced by EDTA ligands."
9,Characterizations of Pt2+-SAs/MBT and Pt-SACs/MBT,"3.2 Characterizations of Pt2+-SAs/MBT and Pt-SACs/MBT With as-prepared MBT materials, Pt metal is introduced by CPt2+ = 10 ppm. DFT calculation results shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 (supporting information) suggest that single Pt2+ ions are most likely captured by EDTA anchored at the Zr6 metal cluster node in MBT (Pt2+-SAs/MBT). The calculated binding energy of Pt2+ ion at the EDTA site is −541 kJ/mol, indicating this EDTA capture process is thermodynamically very facile. While the single Pt2+ ion adsorption at the interfacial sites between EDTA and the Zr6 metal cluster node (outside the EDTA ligand) is relatively weak (−102 kJ/mol). The Pt2+ ion adsorbs at the linker is very weaker, with a binding energy of −21 kJ/mol. As such, it is expected that single Pt2+ ions preferencially adsorb at the EDTA site. After all the EDTA sites are occupied by Pt2+ ions, the remaining Pt2+ ions in the solution, which have not been hydrolyzed to be Pt4+, will adsorb at the interfacial sites. Our DFT calculation results also suggest that each EDTA site can only capture a single Pt2+ ion. While one EDTA site having two Pt2+ ions are thermodynamically unlikely. Therefore, it can be concluded that the introduction of Pt metal in the formed Pt2+-SAs/MBT materials is in the state of isolated single Pt2+ ion. The nature and distribution of Pt2+ ions in Pt2+-SAs/MBT were further investigated using HAADF-STEM technique. The HAADF-STEM image clearly indicates that no Pt nanoclusters can be found in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample, suggesting that all Pt2+ ions captured by EDTA are uniformly distributed. These Pt2+ ions in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample are uniformly distributed in the entire MBT architecture because of the archoring EDTA sites at the Zr6 cluster metal nodes of the MBT. This is confirmed by isolated bright dots (red circles) in Fig. 2 a. The energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 2b) indicate that Pt, Zr, and C species are homogeneously distributed, further confirmed that the single Pt2+ ions uniformly distributed in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT. The oxidation states of Pt species in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT are verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S6 (supporting information), the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 core levels in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT are at 72.3 and 75.6 eV, indicating the Pt2+ species exist in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample. While the weak peaks of Pt4+ may be due to resulted from little nanoclusters. By increasing CPt2+ = 20 ppm (PtO2-NCs/MBT), both uniformly dispersed single Pt atoms (red circles) and Pt nanoclusters (yellow circles) appeared in the catalyst sample, as shown in Fig. S5 (supporting information). The interplanar spacing of 2.1 Å of the PtO2 nanocluster corresponds to the (2 1 0) crystal plane structure of PtO2 (JCPDS 43-1045). The measured XRD patterns shown in Fig. S8 (supporting information) indicate the nearly identical crystallinity and structures of MBT after Pt2+ ions being captured. To obtain the detailed structure at the atomic level, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy analysis and DFT calculations have been performed. The Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) profiles shown in Fig. 2c reveal that the white-line intensity of the Pt2+-SAs/MBT is much higher than that of the Pt foil, indicating that the state of Pt species is the Pt2+ ion. Fourier transforms of the EXAFS shown in Fig. 2d display one sharp peak at 1.56 Å for the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample, clearly suggesting the existence of single Pt2+ ions. While the main peak at 2.34 Å is observed for the standard Pt foil, which corresponds to the typical Pt–Pt bond length in metallic Pt bulk. The EXAFS fitting analysis (Fig. 2e, Fig. S9 and Table S1, supporting information) further suggest that the isolated single Pt atoms are stabilized by neighboring four atoms. It is illustrated in Fig. 2f that the Pt2+ ion is preferable to be captured by EDTA with the tetra-coordinated structure consisting two N and O atoms. DFT calculated two Pt-N and two Pt-O bond lengths are 2.086/2.072 and 1.987/2.020 Å respectively, which agree well with the Pt-N/O bond length of 1.99 Å fitted by EXAFS results (Table S2, supporting information). The TGA result suggests that EDTA ligands on the MOF-808 framework are only stable below 220 °C (Fig. S10, supporting information). To avoid the deconstruction of EDTA ligands, the synthesized Pt2+-SAs/MBT are thermally activated under H2 atmosphere at 200 °C, generating the encapsulated single-atom Pt catalysts (Pt-SACs/MBT). The XRD patterns of Pt-SACs/MBT catalysts shows (Fig. S11, supporting information) that very similar crystalline structures of MBT after activated. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Pt-SACs/MBT suggests that no Pt nanoclusters are observed (Fig. S12a, supporting information). The EDS elemental mappings (Fig. S12b, supporting information) and the HAADF-STEM image (Fig. S12c, supporting information) of the Pt-SACs/MBT sample clearly indicate that these single Pt atoms (red circles) are uniformly distributed in the entire MBT matrix. HRTEM and HAADF-STEM images of the Pt-NCs/MBT catalyst shown in Fig. S13 (supporting information) clearly suggest that Pt nanoclusters (yellow circles) exist as the major Pt component form while the Pt-SACs/MBT also co-exists. Again, the local structural information of these single Pt atoms was identified using EXAFS measurements. As shown in Fig. 3 a, a high white line edge in the Pt-SACs/MBT sample indicates that the unoccupied density of states of Pt 5d orbitals in Pt-SACs/MBT are more than those of the Pt foil, which corresponds to partially oxidized Pt states (Ptδ+) after activated in H2. The Pt-Pt contribution of ∼2.34 Å (Fig. 3b) is absent in the EXAFS for the Pt-SACs/MBT sample (1.79 Å), strongly indicating that the Pt atoms exist predominantly as isolated single atoms in Pt-SACs/MBT. The EXAFS fitting analysis (Fig. 3c, Fig. S14 and Table S1, supporting information) show that the calculated coordination number of the single Pt atom is about two. The fitted mean bond length of Pt-N/O is 2.11 Å. This is also confirmed by DFT calculated Pt-O and Pt-N bond lengths of 2.079/2.101 and 2.034/2.038 Å. The Ptδ+ atoms are strongly bonded to two N atoms with slightly shorter Pt-N bond lengths, which agrees with previous suggestion that the nitrogen sites provide a strong anchoring sites for noble metal atoms [13,20,34]. On the basis of EXAFS analysis and DFT calculation results, the coordination number of single Pt atoms in Pt-SACs/MBT is two, which suggests that the single Pt atoms are highly undercoordinated, more exposing than the four-coordinated Pt2+ in the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample. To confirm experimental EXAFS results shown in the Table S2, we also studied the structures of single Pt2+ ion and the Ptδ+ atom captured by the EDTA ligand on the Zr6 metal cluster node of MOF-808. The EDTA ligand captures a Pt2+ ion from the solution. In this case, the protons of three COOH groups of the EDTA ligand are kept. While two protons of three COOH groups of the EDTA ligand are removed to represent the single Ptδ+ atom after reduction under hydrogen environment. The optimized structures of both cases are very similar, indicating the exceptional stability of single Pt atom captured by the EDTA ligand. The pronounced difference of Pt oxidation states before and after activation was also confirmed by the Bader charge analysis. The calculated Bader charges for the Pt2+ ion and Ptδ+ atom are +1.37 and +0.48 |e|, respectively. This is further confirmed by the adsorption of CO on as-prepared samples in DRIFT spectra. The DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption over the Pt-SACs/MBT shown in Fig. 3d displays a peak centered at 2036 cm−1, which is ascribed to the linearly bonded CO at single Pt atoms. While no obvious peak of CO adsorption was identified in the DRIFT spectroscopy of the Pt2+-SAs/MBT sample (Fig. S15, supporting information), suggesting a lack of interaction between Pt metal ions and adsorbed CO molecules. With these evidence, it is believed that the Pt metal in the MOF-808-EDTA is the uniformly dispersed single Pt atoms without clusters after activated. XPS results show that in the Ptδ+ in the Pt-SACs/MBT peaks (Fig. S16a, supporting information) of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 at 71.2 and 74.5 eV are between Pt2+ and Pt0, indicating the strong interaction between the single Pt atom and N atoms of the EDTA ligand [44]. Moreover, the N 1 s of Pt-SACs/MBT is shifted to higher binding energy (399.88 eV) after activated compared with the Pt2+-SAs/MBT (399.68 eV) (Fig. S17, supporting information), further revealing the significantly chemical interaction between the single Pt atom and N atoms. These results unambiguously indicate that Pt species in Pt-SACs/MBT samples would keep its original positions with homogeneous distributions after activated. Thus, the well-defined positioned single-atom Pt catalysts encapsulated in MOF architecture was developed. The deconvolution of Pt 4f XPS doublet in the Pt-NCs/MBT sample (Fig. S16b, supporting information) gives rise to two pairs of peaks: the strong peak pair at 71.2 and 74.5 eV is attributed to the Ptδ+, while the weak pair refers to the Ptα+, which the oxidation state is between Pt4+ and Pt2+. The later Ptα+ are derived from the partial activated of Pt4+ in PtO2 nanoclusters. The loading amount of single Pt atoms in Pt-SACs/MBT is 0.98 wt%, which is estimated by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The MOF-808-EDTA is formulated (Zr6O7.76(OH)0.24(C9H3O6)2(EDTA)2(HCOO)0.24) [35]. After the incorporation of Pt, the formulate of Pt-SCAs/MBT is eventually denoted as Pt0.085[Zr6O7.76(OH)0.24(C9H3O6)2(EDTA)2(HCOO)0.24]. In other words, the MBT encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst synthesized with the low Pt2+ concentration (CPt2+ = 10 ppm) solution is homogeneously distributed with well-defined locations. Pt-NCs/MBT (CPt2+ = 20 ppm) is composed of single Pt atoms and Pt nanoclusters."
10,Band structure analysis of Pt-SACs/MBT,"3.3 Band structure analysis of Pt-SACs/MBT The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) show that Pt-SACs/MBT has an obvious absorption in the UV range (<400 nm) (Fig. 4 a). As a direct bandgap semiconductor, the optical bandgap energies of Pt-SACs/MBT and MBT can be calculated to 3.69 and 3.80 eV from the Tauc plots, respectively (Fig. 4b). The band positions of Pt-SACs/MBT are critical for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Mott-Schottky measurements are applied to exploit the semiconducting properties and the electronic band positions. The positive slope of curves shows the typical n-type semiconductors (Fig. 4c). The intersection values on the abscissa give flat band potentials of −0.71 and −0.63 eV vs Ag/AgCl for Pt-SACs/MBT and MBT, respectively. The bottom of the conduction band (CB) is generally approximated by flat band potential [45]. As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) values (bottoms of CB) are calculated to be −0.10 eV vs NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) for Pt-SACs/MBT and −0.02 eV vs NHE for MBT. The valence band (VB) edges are calculated to be 3.61 and 3.81 V vs NHE for Pt-SACs/MBT and MBT, respectively, in consideration of their bandgap energies (Fig. 4d). Pt-SACs/MBT and MBT show more negative reduction potentials than H2 evolution (H+/H2: 0 V vs. NHE, pH = 0). As above results inferred, Pt-SACs/MBT and MBT have photocatalytic H2 evolution under UV light irradiation (<400 nm), as shown in Fig. S18 (supporting information)."
11,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities,"3.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities To understand the transfer behavior of photogenerated charge carriers, the PL spectra were measured to monitor the electron transfer process. As shown in Fig. 5 a, EY solution displays a strong emission peak at 549 nm with excitation at 480 nm. When catalysts were dispersed into EY solution, the PL intensity of EY solution declined, illustrating that the photogenerated electron firstly are transferred from EY to MBT. Then, the quenching effect of Pt-SACs/MBT is more pronounced than that of Pt-NCs/MBT and MBT, indicating the high-efficiency photogenerated electron transfer after the introduction of single Pt atoms. Furthermore, the fate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was investigated by the PL of catalyst powders with excited wavelength 325 nm (Fig. 5b). The steady-state PL spectra show that the intrinsic emission peak of MBT has been greatly weakened after Pt incorporation. The obvious PL quenching of Pt-SACs/MBT suggests that single Pt atoms can prevent the direct recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in MBT due to the efficient electron transfer from MBT to single Pt atoms. To investigate the electron transfer efficiency of the Pt-SACs/MBT, the photoelectrochemical method was employed to examine the interfacial charge kinetics through transient photocurrent responses. As shown in Fig. 5c, compared with the pure MBT materials, the Pt-SACs/MBT catalyst possesses much stronger photocurrent response, indicating that the photogenerated electrons and holes is mostly separated and the fast charge transfer from MBT to single Pt atoms under light irradiation. The EIS also shows that the introduction of single Pt atoms into MBT greatly reduces the charge-transfer resistance (Fig. 5d), reflecting the fastest interfacial charge transfer between Pt-SACs/MBT and medium. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the MBT encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst have the high electron transfer efficiency and fast charge-separation ability, which may result in enhanced photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of catalysts were measured under visible and near infrared irradiation (>420 nm) using triethanolamine (TEOA) and Eosin Y (EY) as electron donor and the photosensitizer, respectively. In the presence of EY, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 67.6% has been achieved at 420 nm. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the pure MBT show little photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. Comparing with the negligible activity of MBT, after incorporation of single Pt atoms, the H2 evolution rate over the Pt-SACs/MBT is 68.33 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 6b), which is due to the decreased recombination efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes of MBT by single Pt atoms. The H2 evolution rate over the Pt-SACs/MBT is also 1.5 times higher than Pt-NCs/MBT. The Pt nanoclusters in Pt-NCs/MBT have been hindered the entrance of solutes to degrade photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, corresponding to the BET and pore size distribution results of Pt-SACs/MBT and Pt-NCs/MBT (Fig. S19, supporting information). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Pt-SACs/MBT is superior to Pt-NPs/MOF (photodeposition method) benchmark. Table S3 (supporting information) summarized the previously reported photocatalytic catalysts, where Pt-SACs/MBT shows the efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and AQE. This indicates that the MBT encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst is better than the MBT encapsulated Pt nanocluster and the supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts. It has been noted that the Pt2+-SAs/MBT without H2 activated displays negligible photocatalytic H2 production, indicating that the transformed Pt2+ ions to Pt single atoms are crucial to photocatalysis, as shown in Fig. S20 (supporting information). Furthermore, it is found that excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is kept after five cycles, as shown in Fig. S21 (supporting information). After the reaction, neither Pt nanoclusters or nanoparticles have been observed (Fig. S22, supporting information), indicating the stability of the Pt-SACs/MBT as the single-atom Pt catalyst. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism of Pt-SACs/MBT using TEOA and EY as electron donor and the photosensitizer is showed in Fig. 6c. Under visible and near infrared light irradiation, the EY is excited to form singlet excited state EY1*, which are then undergone the intersystem crossing (ISC) to lowest-lying triplet excited state EY3* [46]. Subsequently, TEOA can be applied to quenched EY3* to obtain TEOA+ and EY−̇ [47]. The electron of EY−̇ species is transferred to the conduction band (CB) of MBT, and the EY−̇ changes back to EY [48,49]. After the incorporation of single Pt atoms, the electron on the CB of MBT is transferred to single Pt atoms, resulting in the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, where the photogenerated holes in MBT are then consumed by TEOA to produce TEOA+. Finally, the electrons in single Pt atoms can combine with two protons to generate H2."
12,DFT calculation for calculated free energy,"3.5 DFT calculation for calculated free energy To gain fundamental insight into why the single-atom Pt catalyst showing the best photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production from water splitting, hydrogen binding free energies (ΔGH*) over the MOF-808, the Pt-SACs/MBT and the Pt-NCs/MBT were calculated using DFT, as shown in Fig. 7 . To understand the hydrogen adsorption on the Pt-NCs/MBT catalyst, various size of Ptn (n = 1 ∼ 6, and 13) clusters outside the EDTA ligand shown in Fig. S23 (supporting information) were calculated in this work. For computational feasibility, the Pt13 cluster was chosen as the model Pt cluster embedded inside MOF-808-EDTA, mimicking the Pt-NCs/MBT catalyst. It is also noted that the adsorbed larger Ptn (n > 13) clusters would cause the structural deformation around the Zr6 metal cluster node or ligand decomposition. The calculated Gibbs hydrogen free energies are very similar on various Ptn clusters. The Pt-NCs/MBT is modeled by a Pt13 cluster anchored at the interfacial site of MBT matrix (Fig. S24, supporting information). The calculated ΔGH* for the Pt-SACs/MBT is −0.13 eV, indicating the facial electron-proton process for the H* formation and hydrogen desorption. While the calculated ΔGH* for the MBT and the Pt-NCs/MBT are −1.12 and −0.48 eV, respectively, suggesting the strong hydrogen binding and inhibited hydrogen desorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the MBT encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst provides the utmost atom efficiency and excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity due to the fact that the single Pt atom effectively lowers the hydrogen binding free energy under photocatalytic conditions in this work."
13,The generality of MBT encaptulated single-atom metal catalysts,"3.6 The generality of MBT encaptulated single-atom metal catalysts We have demostrated that the MOF encaptulated, homogeneously distributed and well-defined positioned single-atom Pt catalyst shows the superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity and high stability. We have extended this novel approach for preparing a series of MBT based metal catalysts including noble metals (Pd, Rh, and Ru) and base metals (Cu, Co, and Ni). The HRTEM images and EDX elemental mapping images of each single-atom M(Pd, Rh, Ru, Cu, Co, and Ni)-SACs/MBT, which are shown in Figs. S25∼S30 (supporting information), clearly confirm these as-synthesized single-atom metal catalysts. These single atom catalysts can be applied in other fields of catalysis."
14,Conclusions,"In the present work, MOF-808-EDTA based metal ion trap method was used to provide a general synthesis platform for preparing stable, homogenously distributed and well-defined positioned single-atom metal catalysts. As a demonstration case, the MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst was synthesized. It had been found that single Pt2+ ions were facilely captured by post-synthetic modified EDTA ligands anchored at the Zr6 cluster metal nodes. Upon activated in H2 atmosphere, the stable MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst with well-defined atomic positions were confirmed by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. DFT calculations were carried out to further confirm experimental characterizations with detailed catalyst structures at the atomic level. Compared with previously reported photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities over MOF-based single-atom Pt catalysts, the as-synthesized MOF-808-EDTA encapsulated single-atom Pt catalyst shows three order of magnitude higher hydrogen generation rate, largely due to the lower hydrogen binding free energy at the single-atom Pt site anchored at EDTA ligand of MOF-808 architecture. Furthermore, the synthesis approach developed in this work has been successfully extended to the preparation of a series of other single-atom metal catalysts encapsulated in MOF-808-EDTA. It is believed that this unique, operable synthesis method can be served as a general platform for preparing stable atomically dispersed bimetallic or tri-metallic alloy catalysts with preferred distributions, compositions, well-defined configurations and locations."
