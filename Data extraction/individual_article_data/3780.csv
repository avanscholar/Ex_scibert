0,Introduction,"The tangerine peel is an important agriculture residue, which can serve as potential adsorbents for the removal of diverse types of pollutants especially metal ions, and it was reported that the most of tangerines were grown in China, Spain, Morocco and Turkey in the world. The tangerine peel is one of the pectin-rich fruit wastes whose basic composition is lignin, hemicelluloses, cellulose, and principally pectin, containing hydroxyl and carboxyl functions, which are promptly available to interact with cations [1,2]. When the processed tangerine peel is thrown into the environment from fruit juice factories or is burned as waste, it causes both in appearance and air pollution by time. Thus, the use of the products to be obtained from tangerine peel, which is the waste of fruit juice factories, in hydrogen storage is very important both for meeting of the energy needs and protecting of the environment. Today, the depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental threats caused by their combustion has diverted the attention of scientific community to search for renewable and environmentally safe energy source. As a candidate for fossil fuels, not renewable, hydrogen has attracted more attention as a result of its pollution-free and high energy [3,4]. Hydrogen has been recognized as an ideal energy carrier, because it is clean and the most abundant element on the Earth. Besides, it can be easily produced by numerous techniques, with no emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases at all, and contains higher chemical energy per mass than the hydrocarbon fuels [5–7]. However, hydrogen storage is the obstacle that hinders the application of hydrogen. Because the storage of hydrogen is difficult and dangerous [3]. Possible current approaches to hydrogen storage are i. compressed hydrogen gas tanks, ii. liquid hydrogen tanks, and iii. reversible metal and chemical hydrides [8,9]. Since these tanks are exposed to high pressure hydrogen, hydrogen embrittlement may occur in the structure of the tanks. This can cause corrosion and dangerous situations [10,11]. Although the storage, transport or use in gas or liquid phase of hydrogen are possible, the storage or use in gas phase of hydrogen requires very large volumes and the storage in liquid phase requires both very high pressure and high costs. The storage of hydrogen in a safe, effective, and cheap system is necessary for practical applications [12]. Therefore, new investigations are centred in the development of novelty hydrogen storage materials. Numerous studies are currently focused on improving present technologies and also on advanced materials such as adsorbent, absorbent and chemical hydrides. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that carbonaceous materials are attractive candidates due to their adsorption ability, high surface areas, low mass density and low cost [8,13]. Activated carbon (AC) can be defined as carbonaceous materials with high surface area and internal surface structure, which cannot be characterized by structural formula or chemical analysis in any way. The fact that the activated carbons have a high pore size and internal surface area allows these materials to be used as an effective adsorbent on an industrial scale [12]. The various porous carbon materials have successfully been synthesized via using template techniques, catalytic activation, carbonization of polymer blend, CVD methods. But these methods had complicated synthesis procedures or used some toxic reagents. For improving specific surface area in practical application, physical or chemical activation are required. Taking the above points, tangerine peel based porous carbon through physical and chemical activation owning developed pores and large specific surface area may be a suitable material for hydrogen storage [3]. The effects of different chemical reagents on carbon quality in activated carbon production processes have extensively been studied by different researchers [14–18]. Among the chemical reagents used for this purpose, especially ZnCl2 and KOH, have widely been used in the preparation of the activated carbons. Chemical activation process with these agents is highly effective in producing of porous and high carbon content materials [18]. Activation is to create pores in non-porous raw materials with the aid of simple chemical reactions [19]. Such activated carbons are used especially for gas storage [20]. Activated carbons have been used for many years in the adsorption of different gases and impurities due to their different physical properties. In the literature, there are studies on hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbons synthesized from different sources by different methods. One of the first studies on the use of the activated carbon in hydrogen storage was made by Kidnay and Hiza. They determined hydrogen adsorption isotherms of the activated carbon samples from coconut shell at 76 K temperature and different pressures and found that 20.2 g of hydrogen at 25 atm was adsorbed by 1 kg of the activated carbon [21]. Carpetis and Peshka (1980) were the first researchers to investigate that hydrogen could be stored cheaply by the activated carbon at cryogenic temperatures. They found that the maximum hydrogen adsorption for the F12/350 activated carbon sample at 41.5 atm and 65 K was 5.2 wt% [22]. Oberoi et al. (2016) investigated the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon electrodes produced from brown coal and found that the highest hydrogen storage capacity obtained was 1.29 wt%, which compared favourably with metal hydrides used incommercially available solid-state hydrogen storages [23]. Wrobel-Iwaniec et al. (2015) studied the hydrogen storage capacities of chitosan-based activated carbons and found that the optimized ACs exhibited excellent hydrogen adsorption capacities at 77 K (2.95 wt% at 0.1 MPa, 5.61 wt% at 4 MPa) [24]. Wang et al. (2014) synthesized the chemically activated fungi-based porous carbons for hydrogen storage and determined that these fungi-based porous carbons achieved an excellent H2 uptake of up to 2.4 wt% at 1 bar and −196 °C, being in agreement with results from other porous carbonaceous adsorbents reported in the literature [25]. Dogan et al. (2018) synthesized the activated carbons with chemical and microwave processes of olive leaf in media with and without ultrasonic waves and carbon nanotube were synthesized with chemical vapor deposition method, respectively; measured the hydrogen adsorption capacity of carbon structures as a function of pressure at 77 K; and found that the hydrogen storage capacity of the carbon nanotube was higher than that of the activated carbon [12]. As can be seen from the above studies, there are not any studies on the production of the activated carbon from tangerine peel and its use in hydrogen storage. Therefore, the aims of this study were to synthesize the activated carbons from tangerine peel by physical and chemical activation methods, to characterize the synthesized activated carbons by fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), and to determine the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbons as a function of pressure at room and cryogenic temperatures using Hiden IMI PSI device."
1,Material and methods,
2,Material,"2.1 Material Tangerine peel used as raw material in experimental studies was obtained from Balıkesir in Turkey. The tangerine peels were washed 3–4 times with distilled water and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 2 days. The dried tangerine peels were ground in a Retsch PM100 ball mill and sieved through a 100–500 μm sieve in the Retsch AS200 device. KOH and ZnCl2 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, HCl from Merck, and NaOH from Emir chemistry. All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical purity."
3,Method,"2.2 Method 2.2.1 Activated carbon synthesis The activated carbons used in the experiments were synthesized by chemical and physical activations of tangerine peel with ZnCl2 and KOH. In the activation procedure, the dried, ground and 25 g of tangerine peel samples with 100–500 μm grain size were soaked with both 50 mL of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5 M ZnCl2 and 50 mL of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5 M KOH solutions and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 day. The reason for the selection of ZnCl2 and KOH as the activation agents in the study was to produce high surface area activated carbons. Tangerine peel samples soaked with activating agents were dried in an oven at 110 °C for 1 day. The dried samples were pyrolyzed at 700 °C for optimization of concentration in a stainless steel reactor vessel for 2 h under a constant flow of N2 gas at 10 psi. The samples were removed from the reactor and washed with 1 M NaOH solution to neutralize excess of activating agents and 0.5 M HCl solutions to remove excess chloride ions. The samples were then washed 3–4 times with warm distilled water and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 1 day. Activated carbon production was carried out in this way. The synthesized activated carbons were called as AC (0.1 M ZnCl2), AC (0.5 M ZnCl2), AC (1 M ZnCl2), AC (5 M ZnCl2), AC (0.1 M KOH), AC (0.5 M KOH), AC (1 M KOH), and AC (5 M KOH) [26,27]. 2.2.2 Characterization of activated carbon Characterization of the activated carbon was carried out by using BET surface area, FTIR-ATR, SEM, and DTA/TG devices. BET surface areas of the activated carbons were measured with the Quantachrome Nova 2200e instrument. The samples were degassed at 250 °C for 24 h before analysis. The surface areas of the degassed samples were determined by using pure nitrogen gas as adsorbate in liquid nitrogen (77 K). FTIR-ATR spectra of the samples were taken in the wavelength range of 650–4000 cm−1 using PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 instrument. SEM images of the samples were taken using Zeiss EVO LS 10 model device. Prior to examining the morphology of the samples, the samples were fixed on the conductive carbon tape and Au–Pd coating was applied for 15 s under a current of 20 μA. The thermal properties of the activated carbon samples were determined using PerkinElmer Diamond DTA/TG instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 600 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Hydrogen gas adsorption measurements of the activated carbon samples were performed with Hiden IMI PSI gas storage device at −198 °C and 25 °C."
4,Results and discussion,Experimental results on the characterization and hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon samples synthesized by physical and chemical activation of tangerine peel have been discussed as following.
5,Characterization of activated carbons,"3.1 Characterization of activated carbons 3.1.1 BET surface area analysis ZnCl2 and KOH were selected as chemical reagents in this study. BET surface area results of the activated carbon samples synthesized from tangerine peel were given in Table 1 . The results show that BET surface areas of the activated carbons increase with increasing ZnCl2 and KOH concentrations. This may be that with increasing concentration, the chemical agents penetrate better into the inner parts of the tangerine peel to form a more porous structure. Again, when BET surface areas of the activated carbons synthesized with both agents are compared, BET surface areas of the activated carbons with ZnCl2 are higher. This result shows that ZnCl2 is a more effective chemical agent in the production of the activated carbon from tangerine peel. 3.1.2 FTIR-ATR analysis Fig 1 shows FTIR-ATR spectra of tangerine peel and the activated carbons. In FTIR-ATR spectrum of tangerine peel, the bands at 3320 and 1017 cm−1 belong to the (O–H) vibration of the hydroxyl group; the bands at 2925, 2046 and 1980 cm−1 the (C–H) vibration of alkenes and alkyl groups; the band at 1732 cm−1 the (CO) vibration of the carbonyl group; the bands at 1606 and 1518 cm−1 the (CC) vibrations in the aromatic group; the band at 1359 cm−1 the (C–O) vibrations in the carboxylate group; the bands at around 1234 cm−1 the (C–N) and (CO) tensile vibrations; and the band at 816 cm−1 the (C–H) vibrations in the benzene ring. When these band values were compared with the FTIR spectra of biomass samples in the literature, the following results were obtained. The wide band at around 3300 cm−1 can be attributed to the tensile vibrations of hydroxyl groups (OH) in tangerine peel containing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in its structure [28]. In addition, the band at ∼2925 cm−1 may belong to the C–H stretching of aliphatic carbon; and the band at ∼1732 cm−1 the tensile frequencies of the carbonyl (CO) in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Multiple peaks in the range of 1606–1518 cm−1 indicate CC vibrations in the aromatic group. The strong band at around ∼1017 cm−1 corresponds to the C–O tensile vibration band and the CH–OH band in the ether, phenol and alcohol. Finally, the band at around ∼816 cm−1 is attributed to C–H vibrations in the benzene derivative [29–31]. Fig. 1 a and b shows that significant changes occur in FTIR-ATR spectra of the activated carbon samples. From this spectrum, it appears that most of the bands in tangerine peel disappear. The reason for this is that when the high temperatures are reached, the functional groups in the structure of the tangerine peel move away from the structure with the effect of temperature. The hydroxyl (-OH) at 3320 cm−1 and the carbonyl bands at 1723 cm−1 in tangerine peel completely disappeared with the influence of ZnCl2 and KOH. The band at 816 cm−1 in the tangerine peel belongs to the aromatic (CC) vibration band. High temperature pyrolysis of the materials causes the functional groups in the structure to convert to volatile CO2 and CO and move away from the structure. As a result, elemental carbons remain in the structure of the activated carbon. CO2 and CO formation was confirmed by the observation of peaks at around 2300-1900 cm−1 in FTIR-ATR spectra of the activated carbons. In FTIR spectra of the activated carbons, the band intensities in the range of 2000–1600 cm−1 increased due to vibrations of (CC) and (CO) in aromatic structures. In addition, the O–H vibration band in the range of 3400–3300 cm−1 in tangerine peel was not observed. This is an expected result considering that the oxygen by carbonization is removed from tangerine peel and that the aromatic structures are broken down to turn into a carbon-weighted solid product [32]."
6,SEM images,"3.2 SEM images SEM gives important information about features such as surface morphology of samples, porosity structure, surface changes, etc. [33]. In this study, SEM was used to investigate the changes occurring on the surface of the activated carbons synthesized at different concentrations with different chemical agents from tangerine peel, especially whether a porous structure was formed. Fig. 2 shows SEM images at constant magnification ratios of the activated carbons. As can be seen from Fig. 2 a, with increasing ZnCl2 concentration, the activated carbon samples are transformed into a more porous structure. This may be the result of the more penetration of ZnCl2 molecules into the inner parts of the tangerine peels and the formation of a more porous structure in the inner parts of the tangerine peels. Table 1 shows that BET surface areas of the activated carbon samples increases with increasing ZnCl2 concentration. According to these results, BET and SEM analysis are quite compatible. Because the increase in surface area generally leads to the formation of a more porous structure. The results of SEM analysis show that with increasing ZnCl2 concentration, the activated carbons are transformed to a more porous structure. SEM image results of the activated carbons with KOH were given in Fig. 2b. From observation, the activated carbon samples have turned into a more porous structure. Again, when BET surface areas in Table 1 are examined, the surface areas of the activated carbons with increasing KOH concentrations increase. In parallel with SEM analysis, this result also shows that activated carbon samples are transformed into a more porous structure. 3.2.1 DTA/TG analysis Thermal analysis of tangerine peel used in the production of the activated carbon provides an important information about the decomposition behavior that occurs depending on the temperature. The thermal behavior of biomasses can be explained as depending on their chemical composition, chemical bonding structure and the catalytic effects of ash/inorganic substances. Thermal analysis of tangerine peel was carried out under an inert gas (N2) atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C per min in the temperature range of 30–600 °C. When the thermogram of this analysis is examined, degradation occurs in 4 steps (Fig. 3 ). In the first step, water/moisture in the structure of the sample is removed in the temperature range of 50–120 °C and a mass loss of about 3.69 wt% occurs. The second decomposition occurs in the temperature range of 150–300 °C, the third decomposition in the temperature range of 300–400 °C, and fourth decomposition in the temperature range of 400–500. It is seen that in these temperature ranges where maximum decomposition takes place, the mass of the starting material decreases by an average of 68.3 wt%. This decreasing in the mass of plant materials can be attributed to the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the structure of tangerine peel in these temperature ranges and thus to the removal of volatile components and gas products from the structure during degradation [34,35]. At temperatures above 500 °C, it was not observed significant weight losses and decomposition step. Therefore, it can be stated that the temperatures above 500 °C is more appropriate for activation. While there are few studies related to tangerine peels in the literature, there are no studies on activated carbon production. In addition, no findings were found regarding the characterization of tangerine peel. The thermal properties of tangerine peel show similar behavior compared to the thermal properties of orange peel in the literature. Mechatia et al. (2015) observed four decomposition steps in TG curve of orange peel. In addition to the first mass loss of 4.8 wt% due to evaporation of water and/or moisture, other three decomposition peaks were observed at 194 °C (20.9 wt%), 222 °C (10.45 wt%) and 315 °C (31.4 wt%) [36–38]. Fig. 4 shows TG thermograms of the activated carbon samples and Table 2 the data calculated from these curves. When Table 2 was examined and Fig. 4 a and b was compared, the number of degradation steps of the activated carbons was similar to each other. Activated carbon samples with ZnCl2 and KOH degrade in two steps. The mass loss amounts (ΔY) and maximum degradation temperatures in these steps were given in Table 2."
7,Hydrogen storage analysis,"3.3 Hydrogen storage analysis 3.3.1 Hydrogen storage capacities of activated carbons with ZnCl2 Activated carbons are amorphous materials consisting of hydrophobic points containing graphene basal plane layers and hydrophilic points containing functional groups. Hydrophobic graphene layer surfaces have important functions in the adsorption of neutral species such as hydrogen and hydrophilic oxygen functional groups in the adsorption of polar species [39]. In this study, hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples synthesized in different conditions from tangerine peel were measured by using Hiden IMI PSI device at low and high pressures at room and cryogenic temperatures. According to the gas law, the amount of adsorbed hydrogen can be calculated from the pressure difference. The hydrogen storage capacity of the adsorbent can be found from gravimetric removal, expressed as weight %. When the mass of the adsorbent is taken as ms and the mass of the adsorbed hydrogen is taken as mH2, the percentage of the adsorbed hydrogen can be calculated from following equation: (1) Weight % = m H 2 ( m H 2 + m s ) x 100 Fig. 5 shows the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbons synthesized at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 M ZnCl2. From the figure, it is seen that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbons increases with increasing concentration of ZnCl2 and increasing pressure. The hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbons synthesized from tangerine peel at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 M ZnCl2 were measured as 0.13, 0.15, 0.16 and 0.20 wt% at 30 bar at room temperature. Although the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples increase both ZnCl2 concentration and pressure it is very low. In the adsorption process, different interactions may be occurred between the adsorbed hydrogen and the activated carbons with different pore sizes and surface areas. Hydrogen molecules can be attached to carbon atoms by covalent bonds. However, the activated carbons do not have a uniform crystalline structure but are amorphous materials. All carbon atoms bonding to the three carbon atoms that hybridize to sp2 in the amorphous structure have an idle π-bond. In this case, the carbon atom is capable of chemical bonding with hydrogen [40]. Since the activation energy required for chemical adsorption of hydrogen (∼3.5 eV) is much higher than physical adsorption (∼30 meV) [41], the tendency of chemical adsorption to occur is lower. Due to the high bond energy, high temperature values (500 °C) are required for the desorption of chemically adsorbed hydrogen [40,42]. Theoretical studies show that the probability of chemical adsorption is particularly low at room temperature and atmospheric pressures [43]. Therefore, it can be said that the interactions between activated carbon and hydrogen are not chemical interactions. In general, in hydrogen storage systems, it is desirable to adsorb hydrogen to the adsorbent surface reversibly by physical forces. Physical sorption is a process in which the hydrogen molecule binds to the adsorbent surface by weak Van der Waals interactions. In this process, the hydrogen molecules retain their molecular forms and do not participate in a chemical reaction such as decomposition. Therefore, physical sorption is a very fast and completely reversible process [44]. In this process, hydrogen is physically adsorbed in the pores or on surface of the activated carbon by the weak Van der Waals interaction between carbon and hydrogen. There is no limit to the amount of hydrogen to be physically adsorbed since the adsorption may be multiple layers. However, in theoretical studies it was determined that physical adsorption at room temperature and atmospheric pressure was only monolayer [45]. From the experimental results, it can be said that hydrogen is physically adsorbed as monolayer on the activated carbon produced since the amount of hydrogen adsorbed in the pores and on surface of the activated carbon at room temperature is low. One of the most important parameters affecting physical adsorption is the surface area of adsorbents [40]. The fact that the hydrogen storage capacity of activated carbon samples synthesized with increasing concentration of ZnCl2 increases may be due to increasing of BET surface areas. However, although there was no significant increase in BET surface area of the samples synthesized with KOH, there were significant changes in hydrogen storage capacities. This case may be due to micro- and mesopores in the structure. Moreover, it can be said that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon samples is low due to the very poor Van der Waals interactions between adsorbent and hydrogen at room and above temperatures. Experiments should be performed at low temperatures to increase the Van der Waals interactions between adsorbent and hydrogen. Therefore, the samples were first placed in an airtight measuring cell and then immersed in a Dewar container filled with liquid nitrogen under vacuum. In order to store high amounts of hydrogen, weak interactions that hold hydrogen molecules together become more important at cryogenic temperatures (77 K) and/or high pressures. Fig. 5 b shows the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples at cryogenic temperature at low and high pressures. When the figure is examined, hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples with increasing ZnCl2 agent increase in parallel with the results obtained at room temperature. However, when the experimental results are compared with the results in Fig. 5a, it can be said that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon samples at cryogenic temperatures is quite high. The hydrogen storage capacities at cryogenic temperatures and 30 bar pressure of the activated carbons synthesized at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5 M ZnCl2 concentrations were measured as 0.96, 1.15, 1.22 and 1.67%, respectively. There are two basic rules for the physical adsorption of supercritical gases. The first is monolayer adsorption and the second is the exponential decrease of adsorption with increasing temperature. In accordance with this disclosure, the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbons decreases at elevated temperatures. The hydrogen storage capacity of a material depends on the specific surface area of material. Hydrogen desorbs with increasing temperature. As a result, the hydrogen storage capacity of the same material under the same conditions decreases with increasing temperature. When the isotherms showing the adsorbed amount of hydrogen on the surface of the activated carbon samples are examined (Fig. 5a and b), it is seen that the adsorbed amount of hydrogen increases on the surface and in pores of the activated carbon at low pressures but it reaches a flatness at high pressures. No further increase in storage capacity was observed when hydrogen pressure continued to be increased. On the contrary, with increasing pressure, the storage capacities of the activated carbon samples decreased slightly. In the literature, the term “excessive adsorption capacity” is often used. Excess adsorption isotherm does not have a flatness at high pressures, but has a maximum, and with further increase in hydrogen pressure, excessive removal decreases. This case occurs when gas is filled into the pores but also the density of the outer gas is still increased. Excessive storage capacity is thus defined as the difference in the amount of gas stored at a given temperature and pressure. As a result, storage capacity decreases due to the increase in the density of hydrogen in the pores of the activated carbon at high pressures [46,47]. 3.3.2 Hydrogen storage capacities of activated carbons with KOH One of the most important chemical agents used in the production of activated carbon is KOH. It has been found that the activated carbons with KOH are generally microporous [26]. The hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbons synthesized using KOH solutions of different concentrations at low and high pressures at room and cryogenic temperatures were given in Fig. 6 a and b. Hydrogen storage capacities of activated carbons have also increased due to the increasing of BET surface area. This provides the increasing of the amount of gas to be adsorbed. When figure is examined, it can be seen that hydrogen storage capacities of activated carbon samples are higher at cryogenic temperatures. The percent hydrogen storage capacities at 30 bar at room and cryogenic temperatures of the activated carbons synthesized by activation at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5 M KOH were measured as 0.12, 0.13, 0.13 and 0.14 wt%; and 0.21, 0.50, 1.00 and 1.11 wt%, respectively. This result shows that Van der Waals interactions between the activated carbon and hydrogen are increased at low temperatures and that hydrogen is more adsorbed in pores and on surface of the activated carbon. When Figs. 5 and 6 are compared with each other, it is seen that the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples with ZnCl2 are higher due to their higher BET surface areas. Again, the change in the nature of the isotherm from linear to non linear in the case of cryogenic conditions may be due to not reaching the monolayer capacity of the activated carbon for hydrogen molecules at room temperature. It can be said that the activated carbon at cryogenic temperatures reaches its maximum adsorption capacity for hydrogen molecules since its pores and outer surface are completely covered by hydrogen molecules. In the literature, it is stated that the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon samples synthesized from different sources by various methods also change. Kidnay and Hiza (1966) investigated the adsorption isotherm of the activated carbon sample synthesized from coconut shell at 76 K temperature and different pressures and determined that 20.2 g of hydrogen at 25 atm was adsorbed by 1000 g of activated carbon (0.0202 wt%) [21]. Jorda-Beneyto et al. (2007) measured the hydrogen storage capacity of a series activated carbon samples at different temperatures and pressures. They found that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon at 298 K depended on both micropore volume and micropore size distribution, that the hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbon at 298 K was 1.2 and 2.7 wt% at 20 and 50 bar pressures, respectively, and that the hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbon at 77 K depended on both the surface area and the total micropore volume [48]. Jimenez et al. (2010) investigated hydrogen adsorption capacities of various carbon samples containing activated carbon and carbon nano fibers as a function of pressure and temperature. They determined that the adsorption capacity values obtained at room temperature and 10 bar pressure were less than 0.1 wt%, and the highest hydrogen adsorption capacity at 77 K and 10 bar was 2.02 wt% depending on cooling and pressure [13]. Akasaka et al. (2011) synthesized microporous carbon samples by KOH activation of coffee bean. They measured that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the samples at 298 K linearly increased with increasing surface area, and that the hydrogen adsorption capacities at 298 and 77 K of the sample with a surface area of 2070 m2/g were 0.6 and 4 wt%, respectively [49]. As can be seen from the above studies, the hydrogen storage capacity at cryogenic temperatures of the activated carbons synthesized in this study is very similar to the results in the literature."
8,Conclusions,"In this study, the characterization and hydrogen storage capacity of the activated carbons synthesized by chemical and physical activation methods of tangerine peel were studied. It was found that with increasing concentration of ZnCl2 and KOH, the surface areas of the activated carbons increased. Additionally, activated carbons synthesized with ZnCl2 had higher surface area than KOH. These results are supported by BET and SEM analysis. Furthermore, hydrogen storage analysis showed that, the activated carbons had higher hydrogen storage capacity at cryogenic temperatures. The hydrogen storage capacities of the activated carbons synthesized with ZnCl2 were higher than those of by KOH. The interactions between hydrogen and the activated carbon were Van der Waals interactions, and were confirmed through Hiden IMI PSI gas storage device at −198 °C and 25 °C."
