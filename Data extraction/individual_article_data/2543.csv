0,Introduction,"Over the past decade, hydrogen has been identified as the “energy carrier for the future” because it has a high energy content (143GJ/t, which is the highest of all known fuels) (Boyles, 1984) and can be converted to electricity more efficiently via fuel cells with water as the end product. Even though hydrogen is currently being produced utilizing fossil fuels, several recent studies have reported on the feasibility of biological processes for producing hydrogen from organic feedstocks – biohydrogen. Recent research has demonstrated that, with appropriate pretreatment of the feed such as acid, alkaline, heat (Lee et al., 2009; Kim and Lee, 2010; Valdez-Vazquez et al., 2006) to inhibit hydrogen-consuming methane-formers, the classical anaerobic process can be engineered to harvest hydrogen from organic substrates instead of methane – a process referred to as dark fermentation (DF). When sucrose is used as the feedstock in dark fermentation, the maximum fermentative hydrogen yield is 8mol H2/mol sucrose when acetic acid is the aqueous end product (ΔG°=−457.5kJ). However, in practice, the actual yield is much smaller due to the formation of other volatile fatty acids and alcohols (Logan et al., 2002; Gadhamshetty et al., 2009). As such, DF researchers have been evaluating possible approaches to attain the theoretical hydrogen yield. Approaches that have been proposed to enhance the DF process include use of optimized cultures and supplemental nutrition; high temperature operation; pH management by initial adjustment, buffering, and continuous pH control; and gas-sparging (Xing et al., 2009). Among the above approaches, the most common one is high temperature operation (>30°C) (Park et al., 2005; Khanal et al., 2004; Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Salerno et al., 2006). While kinetics of the process can be enhanced at higher temperatures, thermal deactivation of hydrogenaze enzyme responsible for hydrogen production can negatively impact productivity (Nath et al., 2006). Further, if the resulting increase in hydrogen yield is not high enough, this approach may result in a negative net energy yield, negating the advantages of hydrogen. The dependency on net energy yield per unit volume of the reactor (kJ/L) on the actual hydrogen yield (mol H2/mol sucrose) and the reactor temperature is shown in Fig. 1 , for fixed sucrose concentration of 5000mg/L. Although Fig. 1 is based on theoretical calculations and ideal conditions (assuming density of reactor contents=1000g/L; calorific value of hydrogen=141,790kJ/kg H2; and specific heat of reactor contents=4.186kJ/kg°C), it illustrates the decline of the viability of the DF process with increase of reactor temperature, providing the motivation to appraise low temperature operation of DF reactors. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of enhancing fermentative hydrogen production from sucrose by minimizing reliance on external materials and energy resources. It was hypothesized that waste materials such as cattle manure when blended with the feedstock could provide the nutritional needs, buffering capacity, and seeds necessary for hydrogen production by DF. It was also hypothesized that seed from hydrogen-producing cultures enriched from compost and growing on special media at ambient temperatures could continue to produce hydrogen from the blended feed at ambient temperatures. The above hypotheses were tested in batch reactors with sucrose blended with cattle manure as the feedstock. The reactors were run at ambient temperature (25°C) without any nutrition addition, buffering, pH control, or gas-sparging."
1,Methods,
2,Hydrogen-producing cultures,"2.1 Hydrogen-producing cultures Mixed cultures enriched from our compost-based hydrogen studies were used as inocula in this study. Microbiome analysis of these cultures was performed with bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) procedure (Dowd et al., 2008) of the 16S rDNA gene, employing amplicons extracted from the reactor microbial population. Primer sets 16S-17F 5′-GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ and 16S-519R-5′-GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3′ were used to amplify a ∼500bp region of the 16S gene with subsequent comparison of sequenced constructs to the 16S ribosomal database. Two identical sample sets were submitted for analysis and out of approximately ∼2500 total sequenced gene constructs the average of the two samples revealed a mixed culture of gram positive anaerobic consortium consisting of 18 bacterial community members, of which the following two members comprised 98% of the consortia: Clostridium pasteurianum (71–84%) and Sporolactobacillus laevolacticus (28–14%). The remaining 2% comprised of 16 other members from Firmicutes. Sequence identification for species level required at least 98% common identity between sequenced amplicons and corresponding organisms in the NCBI database. Quantification of microbiome species was determined by percentage number of sequences within the 2500gene constructs produced by the bTEFAP procedure. These cultures have been grown on media consisting of 0.50g yeast extract, 0.50g bactopeptone, 0.50g bactotryptone, 8.91g sucrose, 0.50g soluble potato starch, 0.30g sodium acetate, 0.30g K2HPO4, 0.05g MgSO4·7H2O, 1mL Turf & Garden Pro humic acids, all mixed in 1L of deionized water. The mixture was transferred into 150mL bottles (Wheaton Scientific) capped with rubber septa and crimp-sealed with aluminum crimp rings and autoclaved for 1h. Two bottles were inoculated with the mentioned culture after cooling to ambient temperature. At the peak H2 production level, 3mL samples from these bottles were used to inoculate the reactor set."
3,Reactor set-up,"2.2 Reactor set-up Average of 1–2days-old screened cattle manure was obtained from the waste pile of a nearby dairy farm. The moisture content of manure samples ranged 75–85%, which is similar to reported literature values (Kalle and Menon, 1984). Manure samples were spread to a thickness of 1cm in aluminum trays and heat-treated for 2h at 104°C and allowed to reach ambient temperature to inhibit methanogens (Oh et al., 2003). Serum bottles (250mL) were used as batch reactors, with headspace volume of 75–100mL. Five reactors were set-up in duplicate with different configurations as summarized in Table 1 , to evaluate the effects of seed addition, manure addition, and sucrose: manure ratio. Two different sucrose: manure ratios were evaluated: 3.75% and 5%. These ratios were selected based on our preliminary tests done at various ratios to assess the optimal range for hydrogen production. All the reactors were capped with rubber septa and crimp-sealed with aluminum crimp rings, without any pH adjustments, gas-sparging or buffers. All the reactors were stirred continuously at 150rpm using magnetic stirrer and maintained under ambient temperature (25°C)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure intermittently (daily) using the reversible displacement method (Gadhamshetty, 2007; Gadhamshetty et al., 2009). Gas samples (0.5mL) were collected from the headspace of the reactors using a gas tight syringe and analyzed with gas chromatograph (GC) (SRI Instruments, model 8610, Torrance, CA) equipped with molecular sieve column (AlltechMolesieve 5A 80/100 6ft×1/8 ft×0.085) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperatures of injection point, oven, and detector were 100, 70, and 100°C respectively. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30mL/min. The GC is capable of analyzing hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and methane. Three samples were analyzed from each reactor and averaged. Liquid samples drawn from the reactors with a gas tight syringe were analyzed for pH, COD and reducing sugar, once in 2days. Cole Parmer electrode probe was used to measure pH and COD was measured using Hach Standard Method. Reducing sugar was analyzed by the di-nitro salicylic acid (DNS) assay. Concentrations of acetate, butyrate, propionate and ethanol were measured using gas chromatograph (SRI Instruments, model 8610A, Torrence, CA) with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Alltech AT-Steel P/W Haysep q 80/1, 6ft×1/8ft×0.085) using helium as carrier gas. The operational temperature of injector port, oven and the detector were 200, 200 and 220°C, respectively. Injection volume was 1μl from filtered liquid sample."
5,Results and discussion,"Measurable methane was not detected in any of the reactors. This confirmed that the heat treatment was adequate to inhibit native methane-formers in cattle manure, agreeing with the observation by Gilroyed et al. (2008). Reactor R5 fed with sucrose alone and seeded with hydrogen-producing cultures produced negligible amounts of biogas (<21mL) with low hydrogen content (<12%). However, significant volumes of hydrogen-rich biogas (>312mL at >50% hydrogen) were produced in all the reactors supplemented with cattle manure (R1–R4) as summarized in Table 2 . These findings indicated that hydrogen could not be produced from pure sucrose at ambient temperatures and that hydrogen production from sucrose could be enhanced when supplemented with heat-treated cattle manure."
6,Cattle manure as a source of nutrients,"3.1 Cattle manure as a source of nutrients Even though our preliminary studies (Gadhamshetty, 2007) had showed that the inoculum enriched in our lab was capable of producing hydrogen from sucrose in reasonable quantity and composition when the reactors were enriched with nutrients and vitamins, in this study, this inoculum was not able to produce any significant hydrogen from the control reactor R5, with sucrose but without any nutrients. Previous literature studies had also reported poor hydrogen production under nutrient-limited conditions (Lin and Lay, 2005). Maximum hydrogen content of the headspace in R5 was 12% while that in the reactors fed with the sucrose–manure blend (R1–R4), ranged 50–59%. Average hydrogen production rate in reactor R5 was 1mL/g COD-day whereas that in reactors R1–R4 ranged 16–30mL/g COD-day (Table 2). From these observations, it is proposed that cattle manure as a supplement could serve a beneficial role in dark fermentation by providing the nutrition essential for bacterial growth and hydrogen production."
7,Cattle manure as a source of seed,"3.2 Cattle manure as a source of seed In this study, two sources of cultures were tested for biohydrogen production-enriched cultures from external source (seeded reactors, R1 and R2) and native organisms in heat-treated cattle manure (unseeded reactors, R3 and R4). It was found that hydrogen production in the unseeded reactors (225±24mL H2 in R3 and 181±29mL H2 in R4) were comparable to those in the seeded reactors (192±8mL H2 in R1 and 201±15mL H2 in R2) with no statistically significant difference between the seeded and unseeded reactors (at 95% confidence level). Based on this finding, it is proposed that heat-treated cattle manure as a supplement can enhance fermentative hydrogen production from sugary wastes by providing hydrogen-producing seed."
8,Cattle manure as a source of buffer,"3.3 Cattle manure as a source of buffer In this study, pH was not adjusted or controlled in any of the reactors. From the pH profiles shown in Fig. 2 , it can be seen that pH in the reactors supplemented with cattle manure ranged 4.5–5.0 and did not fall below 4.5. In contrast, pH declined from 4.0 to 3.1 in the sucrose-only reactor R5 that did not receive any manure. Based on the pH fluctuations and the hydrogen yields obtained in this study under different conditions, it is concluded that a pH range of 4.5–5.0 is optimal for hydrogen production from sucrose supplemented with cattle manure; and that this range can be maintained without any initial pH adjustments, buffering, or external pH control. The optimal pH range found in this study is comparable to the corresponding values reported in the biohydrogen literature. For instance, Van Ginkel et al. (2001) proposed a pH range of 5.0–6.0 as optimum for hydrogen production from sucrose, enriched with additional nutrients and pH adjustment. Kawagoshi et al. (2005) tested six types of inocula with synthetic medium, initial gas-sparging, and pH adjustment, and suggested a constant pH of 6.0 for optimal hydrogen production from glucose. Hwang et al. (2004) studied biohydrogen production from glucose with nutrient/mineral addition at constant pH levels, and identified pH of 4 as inhibition level for biohydrogen production. Fang et al. (2006) has recommended pH of 4.5 for acidophilic biohydrogen production from rice slurry with periodic pH adjustment. Lay et al. (2003) has suggested pH of 5.0 for hydrogen production from carbohydrate-rich high solid organic wastes with initial pH adjustment. Zhu et al. (2009) evaluated fermentative hydrogen production from liquid swine manure blended with glucose at 35°C in the pH range of 4.7–5.9 and had suggested pH of 5.0 to be optimal. Based on these observations, it is further proposed that the cattle manure could serve an additional role as a buffering agent."
9,Cattle manure as a co-substrate,"3.4 Cattle manure as a co-substrate In our previous dark fermentation studies on pure sucrose (Gadhamshetty, 2007), the major end products were acetic, butyric, and propionic acids, with the following average VFA ratios at the end of gas production phase: butyric/acetate=2.0M/M and propionic/acetate=0.17M/M. Using these average ratios and assuming a typical biomass yield of 0.1g/g, the following empirical stoichiometric equation could be derived for biohydrogen production from pure sucrose: C 12 H 22 O 11 + 0.3 NH 4 + + 0.78 H 2 O → 1.34 C 4 H 8 O 2 + 0.11 C 3 H 6 O 2 + 0.67 C 2 H 4 O 2 + 0.3 C 5 H 7 O 2 N + 3.47 CO 2 + 4.3 H 2 This equation predicts the hydrogen content in the biogases to be 55%, which agrees well with the measured values that ranged 50–60% (Gadhamshetty, 2007). Based on the above equation, hydrogen yield from pure sucrose would be 4.3mol H2/mol sucrose when the yields of liquid products match experimental results. We attribute this relatively high yield to the enriched hydrogen-producing cultures used in our studies. Comparable yields have been reported by Lin and Lay (2004) =4.8, Chen and Lin (2003) =4.52 and Chen et al. (2008) =3.8. In contrast to our previous study (Gadhamshetty, 2007) with pure sucrose, in this study with sucrose-supplemented cattle manure, ethanol was observed as an additional end product, reducing the potential hydrogen yield. In spite of that, the maximum hydrogen yield in this study is found to be 4.7±0.5mol H2/mol sucrose. Based on this, albeit, indirect deduction, we conclude that cattle manure contributed to at least 0.4mol (∼10%) of the additional H2. Assuming typical solids content of manure reported in the literature (54.5kg manure per cow/day, 7.6kg TS per cow/day, 6.4kg TVS per cow/day) (Hubbard and Lowrance, 1998), hydrogen production achieved in this study at 25°C translates to about 7L H2/kg TS (8L H2/kg TVS)."
10,Gas production and yields,"3.5 Gas production and yields Gas production in all the test reactors (R1–R4) continued for 120h and ceased thereafter. Fig. 3 shows the cumulative hydrogen production and Fig. 4 shows the variation of hydrogen composition in the reactors over the test period. It is hypothesized that decline in hydrogen composition depicted in Fig. 4 could be due to homo-acitogenic bacteria from the manure. Maximum biogas volume of 381±16mL was obtained in R3 reactor with 57% hydrogen content at sucrose-to-manure ratio of 5.0%. In contrast, R2 reactor produced 362±25mL of biogas with 59% hydrogen at sucrose-to-manure ratio of 3.75%. Even though maximum hydrogen production rate (of 55mL H2/gCOD-day) was obtained in R2 reactor which had a higher manure content (20 vs. 15g) in spite of lower sucrose supplement (3.75% vs. 5.0%), average hydrogen production rates recorded in R2 and R3 reactors are comparable: 30±2 and 27±3mL H2/gCOD-day. From this comparison, it can be seen that, highest production was from R3 at sucrose supplement of 5.0%, without any external seeding. These observations warrant further studies to determine the optimum sucrose: manure ratio for biohydrogen production. Hydrogen yields reported in the literature using pure substrates augmented with nutrients, pH adjustment, pH control, and gas-sparging are summarized in Table 3 along with those found in this study. The practical feasibility of our approach can be noted in Table 3, where the hydrogen yield obtained in this study without any pH adjustments can be seen to be comparable to, or better than, the reported data obtained with pure substrates augmented with nutrients, pH adjustment, pH control, or gas-sparging."
11,"COD, sucrose, and VFA profiles","3.6 COD, sucrose, and VFA profiles Profiles of dissolved COD in reactors R1–R5 as a function of time are shown in Fig. 5 . The fate of dissolved COD in these batch reactors is governed by two reactions: (1) production of dissolved COD due to hydrolysis of particulate manure; and (2) uptake and conversion of dissolved COD to H2 and other aqueous end products. The almost flat COD profiles in reactors R1–R4 indicate that the hydrolytic COD production rate is nearly balanced by the utilization rate. Sugar analyses showed that 95% of the sucrose was consumed at the end of gas evolution period in reactors R1–R4 while only 25% was consumed in R5 reactor; total gas production in R5 was less than 10% of that in R1–R4. As discussed earlier, this poor performance of R5, in spite of the sucrose level and the seeding with hydrogen-producing cultures, is attributed to the lack of nutrients and buffering that the manure supplement was able to provide in the productive reactors, R1–R4. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis of the liquid phase showed acetic, propionic and butyric acids as the significant liquid phase end products. Concentration of all VFAs increased with time, while butyric acid was the dominant one. In addition to VFAs, ethanol was also detected in all reactors, which began to decline with cessation of hydrogen production. These liquid phase products are similar to those observed in manure studies (Xing et al., 2009). The average liquid end products relative to acetic acid were 0.65M/M for butyric acid; 0.50M/M for propionic acid; and 0.53M/M for ethanol."
12,Benefit of hydrogen production at ambient temperature,"3.7 Benefit of hydrogen production at ambient temperature Most previous studies on biohydrogen production from pure substrates and liquid organic waste streams had been conducted at temperatures of 30°C or higher. While operation at higher temperatures can enhance the kinetics of the process and metabolite product distribution, it can, at the same time, reduce the net energy gain of the process. Gas production data from the literature and our studies (summarized in Table 3) were evaluated in this study to compare the net energy gain at ambient temperature against that at elevated temperatures. For this comparison, we estimated the energy consumed to heat unit volume of the reactor contents to the test temperature (assuming specific heat and density of water as 4.2kJ/kgK and 1kg/L, respectively); and estimated the energy produced from the reported hydrogen production per unit volume of the reactor (assuming the calorific value and density of hydrogen as 141.8MJ/kg and 0.09g/L, respectively). The heat loss from the reactors was ignored in these conservative estimations. In addition, the heat energy required for heat-treatment is also ignored for this comparison, as all the studies had used a similar heat-treatment process to inhibit the methanogens. From the results shown in Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the net energy gain could be negative at elevated temperatures, in spite of the high hydrogen yield (Table 3). The intent of Fig. 6 is to illustrate the net energy gain in each study and not to compare the energies across the different studies because of the different substrates and their initial concentrations used in the respective studies. Results of our previous studies (Gadhamshetty et al., 2009) as well as this study demonstrate the viability of biohydrogen production at ambient temperatures. The positive net energy gain realized in this study is due to the low fermentation temperature on one hand and the high hydrogen yield on the other, as illustrated in Fig. 1."
13,Conclusions,"Results of this study confirmed the hypotheses that heat-treated cattle manure as a supplement can provide the necessary cultures, nutrients, and buffers to enhance fermentative hydrogen production from sucrose. However further research is needed to optimize sucrose:manure ratio and study any other negative effects due to the complex nature of dairy manure. The hydrogen yield values found in this study, without resorting to high temperature operation, initial pH adjustments, buffering, pH control, or gas-sparging, are comparable to those reported in the literature that had utilized some combinations of the above. In contrast to the literature studies done at above-ambient temperatures, this study demonstrated that fermentation at ambient temperature could be more energy-efficient with positive net energy yield."
