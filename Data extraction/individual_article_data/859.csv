0,Introduction,"Now, massive production of waste activated sludge (WAS) is becoming one of the serious issues faced by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018a). It was reported that 0.1–30.8 kg per person equivalent of WAS was generated annually based on the estimation on WAS production rate globally (Guan et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017). WAS is an extremely complex and heterogeneous solid waste and readily causes serious environmental pollution, moreover, and its treatment and disposal amounts for up to ∼60% of total operating cost of a WWTP. WAS contains large amount of organics substances (Wang et al., 2018b), e.g. proteins and carbohydrates, which is also a potential pragmatic source for bioenergy recovery. Generally, WAS is treated by anaerobic digestion to product methane (Wang et al., 2018b;Wang et al., 2017a,b; Xu et al.,2018b; Liu et al., 2019). Hydrogen could be generated from WAS as an intermediate product of anaerobic fermentation (Wang et al., 2018a; Stanislaus et al., 2018). Hydrogen is regarded as the worthy alternative to conventional fossil fuel energy sources due to its clean combustion product (only water vapor) and high energy release (143 M kg−1) (Yin and Wang, 2015; Sittijunda and Reungsang, 2012; Khan et al., 2017). Thus, the production of biohydrogen from anaerobic fermentation process has attracted growing attention (Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b). The process of biohydrogen by anaerobic fermentation has not been applied in practical engineering due to low yields of hydrogen and rapid consumption rates. Hence, scientists and researchers tested many technical methods for biohydrogen production from WAS, mainly including adding chemical substances (e.g. NO2 −-N, NH4 +-N, iron) (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al, 2018c; Budiman and Wu,2018), and controlling/adjusting the fermentation conditions and the characteristics of fermented sludge (e.g. pH, temperature, C/N) (Qi et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2008). For example, it was found that hydrogen production from sludge could be greatly enhanced by NH4 +-N addition with pH pretreatment, because this strategy not only improved the solubilization and hydrolysis processes but also inhibited the activities of hydrogen consuming bacteria of both methanogens and acetobacteria (Wang et al., 2018c). Other pretreatment methods enhancing the biohydrogen production, e.g. heat treatment, acid/base treatment, combined treatment with pH and temperature adjustment, were also reviewed in previous few years. As the byproduct of wastewater treatment, many hazardous substances, such as dyes, heavy metals, antibiotic, trace organic contaminants and oil, are contained in WAS, causing a potential risk to ecology, environment and even human health with sludge reuse as biosolids (Phan et al., 2018). Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as one type of high production and widespread use of synthetic chemicals are continuously and ubiquitously detected in WAS. Previous studies have reported their fates in WWTPs and effect on sludge anaerobic fermentation and digestion (Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018d). Triclocarban (TCC) is one of typical PPCPs and has been received increasing attention in recent years. It was reported that TCC is an important additive for household consumables or other personal care products (e.g. soap, toothpaste, and cosmetics) and 227–454 tons were produced and consumed annually in USA (Tizaoui et al., 2011). TTC’s special properties and extensive usage caused a “pseudo-persistent” in environment. Recent investigations have stated the contents of TCC in water and sludge are up to ppb or even to ppm levels (Armstrong et al., 2018; Chu and Metcalfe, 2007; Sapkota et al., 2007). Halden and Paull (2004, 2005) found the concentration of TCC was up to 5600 ng/L–6750 ng/L in the Baltimore urban streams. Lehutso et al. (2017) investigated six different WWTPs in South Africa for two years and found TCC concentrations were 0.086–2.84 µg/L in influent, ∼1.89 µg/L in effluent, 3.65–11.8 µg/L in raw sludge and 2.59–8.23 µg/L in biosolids, respectively. Due to its high hydrophobicity (log Kow = 4.9), it was reported that approximately 78% of TCC was adsorbed in waste sludge (Heidler et al., 2006). Venkatesan et al. (2012) found 822 ng/g dry weights (dw) of TCC in WWTPs and 50 mg/kg TSS in biosolids, even its lesser chlorinated congeners (dichloro- and non-chlorinated carbanilides) were also detected in all study sites. With the increasing use of TCC, the content of TCC might increase to a risk level in the future, requiring exploring its hazardless urgently. Some efforts were preformed to investigate its antibiotic resistance, endocrine disruption, and carcinogenicity. It was found TCC contains certain extent toxicity to many organisms, including aquatic model organisms, terrestrial organisms, mammals, (Carey and Mcnamara, 2016; Pycke et al., 2014; Jret al., 2012; Lenz et al., 2017) and even to humans. TCC caused the antibiotic toxicity to E. fetida with the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of 40 mg TCC kg amended find sand−1 (Snyder et al., 2011), to C. elegans with IC50 of 0.91 mg/L (Lenz et al., 2017), and to P. subcapitata with IC50 of 17.5 mg/L (Yang et al., 2008). TCC impacts androgenic activity of mammals by amplifying the bioactivity of endogenous hormones (Chung et al., 2011). Recently, Carey and McNamara (2016) studied the toxicity of TCC to anaerobic digestion by measuring methane production rate as indicators and concluded that TCC contained much harsher toxicity to digester communities than other antibacterial agents. In addition, Wang et al. (2018d) further evaluated the toxicity of TCC to microorganisms in waste sludge and concluded that TCC exposure facilitated some of the SCFA producers (e.g. Guggeheimella sp., Proteiniclasticum sp., and Fastidiosipila sp.), but greatly inhibited methanogens, causing amounts of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were produced by TCC addition. It was known that hydrogen and SCFAs are the two mainly end products during anaerobic fermentation, but it is unknown that the effect of TCC on biohydrogen production from dark fermentation. The knowledge gap greatly creates our interest and leads us to raise several questions: Dose different concentration exposure of TCC also impact hydrogen production from sludge? If it does, how does TCC affect sludge anaerobic fermentation processes relevant to hydrogen production and consumption, such as solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis, and methonogenesis processes? By answering these questions above, this study aimed to explain the effect of TCC on hydrogen accumulation during anaerobic fermentation and to reveal the potential mechanisms. Firstly, the effect of different dosages of TCC on hydrogen production from anaerobic WAS fermentation was investigated under alkaline condition (pH 9.5), as this condition was reported to be beneficial for hydrogen accumulation (Wang et al., 2018c). Then the facts of how TCC affects each step involved in anaerobic WAS fermentation were assessed via a series of batch test and key enzyme activity analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study revealing the effect of TCC on biohydrogen production from WAS, which made researchers and engineers to thoroughly understand the toxicity of TCC to anaerobic fermentation."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Sludge sources,"2.1 Sludge sources To eliminate the residual TCC in sludge, the WAS used in this study was harvested from a sequencing batch reactor with a working volume of 40L, where TCC was not contained in influent. Raw sludge was concentrated by setting at 4℃ for 24 h and was filtrated by 2.0 mm stainless steel mesh before experiment. The main characteristics of the concentrated WAS are as follows: pH 6.8 ± 0.2, total suspended soils (TSS) 28505 ± 150 mg/L, volatile suspended soils (VSS) 15050 ± 150 mg/L, total chemical oxygen demand (COD) 16210 ± 342 mg/L, total protein 11430 ± 220 mg COD/L, total carbohydrate1611 ± 150 mg COD/L, and lipid and oil 150 ± 30 mg COD/L. In this study, TCC was extra added in sludge with over 98% purity and was purchased from Chemical Industry Park, Shanghai, China. NH4Cl stock solution of 10 g/L was prepared in deionized water."
3,Batch experiment for bio-hydrogen production from WAS anaerobic fermentation with different levels TCC at different conditions,"2.2 Batch experiment for bio-hydrogen production from WAS anaerobic fermentation with different levels TCC at different conditions In this batch experiment, five reproductive bottles were carried out as anaerobic fermentation reactors with a working volume of 1L. Each bottle was imported with 500 mL concentrated sludge. Different levels of TCC were added into three fermentation groups, making the initial TCC level of 0, 84.2 ± 18, 420 ± 58, 912 ± 110, or 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS. The pH was respectively controlled at 9.5 by adjusting with 2.0 M hydrochloric acid and 2.0 M sodium hydroxide. In addition, 30 mL NH4Cl stock solution was introduced to make the initial NH4 +-N was 158 ± 5 mg/L. The bottles were aerated with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen, capped with rubber stoppers, sealed and placed in an air-bath shaker at 120 rpm with 35 ± 1 °C. It should be noted that there are no other inocula being added into the fermenters, thus WAS was utilized as both fermentation substrates and inocula in this experiment. The batch experiment was fermented approximately 20 d. The total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottle using a glass syringe (300 mL) to equilibrate with the atmospheric pressure, and the calculation of the cumulative volume of hydrogen gas was reported in our recent studies (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al.,2018c;Wang et al., 2018d). The variations of soluble COD, protein, carbohydrate, and SCFAs were measured to reveal the effect of TCC on sludge solubilization."
4,"Evaluation of the effect of different TCC concentrations on hydrolysis, acidification, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes during anaerobic fermentation system","2.3 Evaluation of the effect of different TCC concentrations on hydrolysis, acidification, acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes during anaerobic fermentation system Hydrolysis and acidification are the processes for microorganisms to degrade macromolecular organics, their reaction rates significantly impact the production of biogas, which are regarded as the second anaerobic fermentation phase. Afterwards, anaerobic fermentation also contains three main processes closely relevant to hydrogen production and consumption, namely acetogenesis, homoacetogenesis, and methonogenesis. Five simulation experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of TCC on these processes, and specific experimental methods were demonstrated below. Hydrolysis: Five identical reactors with working volume of 500 mL each were performed using synthetic wastewater. Each reactor received 300 mL of synthetic wastewater and 30 mL of fermented sludge as in culums. The TCC levels in the five reactors were 0, 0.67, 2.0, 4.4, or 6.7 mg/L, which were respectively equivalent to those in the reactors carried out in the Section 2.2. 18 mL NH4Cl stock solution was added into each reactor to ensure the same NH4 +-N concentration in this test as in the above batch experiment. Then these reactors were maintained pH at 9.5, aerated N2 for 5 min and placed in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 ± 2℃ shaking at 120 rpm. The synthetic wastewater contains 5g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA, average molecular weight 67000, a model protein compound). The BSA concentration in each reactor was measured at different fermentation times. The effect of TCC on hydrolysis process was assessed via calculating the volumetric BSA degradation rate among the reactors. Acidification: The operations of this test were performed the same as stated in the above test expect that L-alanine (model amino acid compound, one of basic structural units of proteins) was replaced with BSA. Acetogenesis: In this test, butyrate was used as the synthetic wastewater and the all other operation conditions were conducted with the same as described in the Hydrolysis test. By analyzing the concentration variation of sodium butyrate, the effect of TCC on acetogenesis could be indicated. Homoacetogenesis: This test was carried out with the synthetic wastewater was replaced with top water. The content of inocula of fermented sludge and concentration of NH4Cl were injected same as the above test in each reactor. pH was controlled at 9.5 in each reactors during the whole fermentation period. Then, all these reactors were aerated with a combined gas (40% hydrogen, 10% carbon dioxide, and 50% nitrogen) for 3 min to ensure that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen-containing gas. Finally, these reactors were also capped with rubber stoppers, sealed and stored in an air-bath shaker at stirring speed of 120 rpm. It was measured the content of hydrogen and methane in each reactor every day during the 5 d fermentation time. Thus, the effect of TCC on both homoacetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methonogenesis processes was displayed by assessing the consumption of hydrogen among these reactors. Methonogenesis: This test was performed with the same operation conditions described in Acetogenesis except that 5 g/L sodium acetate was used to replace butyrate in synthetic medium. In this test, the effect of TCC on methanotrophic methonogenesis could be evaluated by comparing the degradation rate of sodium acetate among these reactors."
5,Long-term operation of semi-continuous fermenters for the analysis of the relevant enzyme activities involved in anaerobic fermentation,"2.4 Long-term operation of semi-continuous fermenters for the analysis of the relevant enzyme activities involved in anaerobic fermentation In this study, the effect of TCC on hydrogen production was further explained by investigating the variations of the activities of key enzymes in two long-term anaerobic fermenters. Two identical fermenters were carried out with a working volume of 1L. One fermenter is set as the control reactor receiving 800 mL WAS without TCC addition, the other fermenter is served as the experimental reactor feeding with 800 mL WAS with 912 ± 110 mg/kg TSS presence. The same initial concentration of NH4 +-N (158 ± 5 mg/L) was pledged in both the two fermenters. pH in the each fermenter was constantly controlled at 9.5. The other operation conditions were same as showed in Section 2.2. Based on the batch experimental results, the maximum cumulative hydrogen production among these fermenters was obtained after 15 d fermentation time. Hence, in the long-term and semi-continuous fermentation, 33.3 mL of fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each reactor and replaced with the same volume of new WAS either with or without TCC addition, which guaranteed a 15 d of sludge retention time in the two reactors. In addition, the two reactors were aerated with nitrogen gas for 5 min before they were re-capped and re-sealed every time. After 50 d fermentation, both the reactors obtained a stable hydrogen yield, and then it analyzed the activities of key enzymes by their specific detection methods."
6,Model-based analysis,"2.5 Model-based analysis A modified Gompertz equation was used to modify the cumulative hydrogen yield curves (Zhang et al.,2017; Nualsri et al., 2016). The Gompertz model describes the correlation between the yield of cumulative hydrogen production (H, mL/g VSS) and the fermentation time (t, h) based on a sigmoid function (Eq. (1)). (1) H = P exp - exp Rm × e p λ - t + 1 where H is represent the yield of cumulative hydrogen production (mL/g VSS), P is the hydrogen production potential (mL/g VSS), Rm is the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/g VSS/h), λ is the lag phase time (h), t is the fermentation time, e is the exp = 2.718. Key parameters (P, Rm, λ) could be estimated by using Matlab 2016. The effect of TCC on the degradations of BAS, glucose, butyrate, acetate, and hydrogen can be evaluated by the inhibition constant, which was obtained by the following Eqs. (2) and (3): (2) C 0 - C t = C 0 × 1 - exp X × t where C0 is the initial concentration of model substrates, Ct is represent the concentration of model substrates at t day fermentation, t is the digestion time (d), and X is the degradation kinetic rate (mg/(L·d)) of model substrates. (3) X s , i / X s , 0 = 1 / 1 + Ii / K s , i where X is represent the removal efficiency as described in Eq. (2), subindex “s” is the model substrate and “i” refers to the inhibitor, Ii is the concentration of inhibitor (mg/L), and Ks,i is the related inhibition constant (mg/L)."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods Soluble COD, VSS, and TSS were measured according to standard methods (APHA, 1998). The measurement of protein and carbohydrate were performed by the Lowry-Folin method with BSA as the standard and the phenol–sulfuric method with glucose as the standard based on our previous studies (Wang et al., 2019a). L-alanine is measured according the method reported by Bergmeyer and Horder (1980). The relative activities of acetate kinase, butyrate kinase, [FeFe] hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420 were assessed based on our previous studies (Wang et al., 2017a,b). The fractions of hydrogen and methane in biogas were measured by a gas chromatograph (GC112A, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2-m stainless steel column peaked with Shin carbon (50/80 mesh). The GC conditions were showed in the following: 1 mL of sample gas was as the injection volume via a gastight syringe, nitrogen as the carrier gas flowed a 4 mm × 32 m stainless column at the flow rate of 30 mL/min, 40, 40, and 80℃ were respectively set as the temperatures of the injection port, column, and detector. The analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (namely acetic acid, propionic acid, iso-butyric acid, n-butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and n-valeric acid) in fermentation liquor was used a gas chromatograph (HP5890, GC) equipped flame ionization detector. The infrared spectra of freeze-dried WAS was measured in potassium bromide pellets via an Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) according to the method reported previously (Feng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Except the long-term operation of semi-continuous fermenters, all other batch tests were conducted in triplicate. An analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Fermentation hydrogen production from WAS with different TCC levels exposure and158 ± 5 mg/LNH4 +-N pretreatment at pH 9.5,"3.1 Fermentation hydrogen production from WAS with different TCC levels exposure and158 ± 5 mg/LNH4 +-N pretreatment at pH 9.5 Fig. 1 showed that the curve of cumulative hydrogen yield from the anaerobic sludge with different levels of TCC addition. The cumulative hydrogen production yields in fermenters increased with the fermentation time from 0 to 384 h, and after that time there were no significant increase for the yields of cumulative hydrogen production (p > 0.05). Thus, 384 h fermentation was regarded as the optimum fermentation time in this test. It can be observed that the maximum hydrogen production yields were respectively 11.4 ± 0.2, 12.0 ± 0.3, 13.1 ± 0.2, 14.2 ± 0.2 mL/g VSS in the fermenters with different levels of TCC addition, which were approximately 1.13, 1.18, 1.30, 1.4 times than that in the fermenter without TCC addition (10.1 ± 0.2 mL/g VSS). This results indicated that the hydrogen yield was evidently enhanced by TCC addition at the concentration range of 0–1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS. Additionally, it was found similar tendencies of hydrogen accumulation in the fermenters with the increase of TCC addition from 0 to 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS. In order to deeply understand the effect of TCC on dark fermentation hydrogen production from WAS, the Gompertz empirical model was used to describe the experimental results. From Fig. 1, it can be found that hydrogen production increased exponentially and fitted the modifying Gompertz equation well (full line). The regression values among the fermenters for all the cumulative hydrogen production yields were found to be ＞0.94, indicating Gompertz empirical model successfully simulates the experimental data. The key kinetic parameters (i.e., maximum hydrogen yield potential (Pm), hydrogen production rate (Rm), and lag phase time (λ)) were respectively displayed in Table 1 . It can be seen that with TCC levels increasing from 0 to 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS, maximum hydrogen yield potentials (Pm) and hydrogen production rates (Rm) increased from 9.97 to 13.85 mL/g VSS and from 0.09 to 0.13 mL/g VSS·h, respectively. It modeled the relevant mathematical function simulation of Pm and Rm and the results were depicted in Fig. 1B and C with an exponential function. In addition, the increasing trend of Pm and Rm became smaller with an increase of TCC concentration, indicating that high TCC levels maybe inhibit hydrogen production during anaerobic fermentation process. The analysis results showed that the addition of TCC not only enhanced the hydrogen production yields but also promoted the hydrogen yield potentials and hydrogen production rates."
11,Contribution of TCC degradation to hydrogen production,"3.2 Contribution of TCC degradation to hydrogen production Previous studies documented that TCC was difficult to be biodegraded in soil and sediment and its half-life was reported at 70–540 days (Armstrong et al., 2018; Heidler et al., 2006), but TCC could be degraded by some specific microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. It was demonstrated TCC was partly degraded under an alkaline pretreatment fermentation system (See Supplementary data), and its degradation pathway was summarized previously (Wang et al., 2018d). As well, it assessed the concentration variation of TCC in this study. Similarly, small part of TCC were degraded in WAS fermentation system, but the main intermediate substances were 4, 4′-dichlorocarbanilide and 4-Chloroniline. Table 2 showed the variations of TCC and its main intermediate substances. It can be seen that the initial concentration of total TCC was 40 ± 4.6 mg/L in the 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS reactor. After 20 d fermentation the total TCC concentration significantly decreased by 15.6% with 3.2 ± 0.8 mg/L of 4, 4′-dichlorocarbanilide and 2.1 ± 0.7 mg/L of 4-Chloroniline being detected, respectively. Furthermore, theoretic calculation showed that even if all the degraded TCC was converted into hydrogen, the maximum hydrogen yield was 0.13 mL/g VSS (See Supplementary data), which accounted for only 0.9% of the promotion of hydrogen production (14.2 mL/g VSS). Thus, the contribution of TCC degradation to hydrogen accumulation could be neglectable."
12,COD mass balance evaluation of sludge anaerobic fermentation with different TCC addition and NH4 +-N pretreatment at pH 9.5,"3.3 COD mass balance evaluation of sludge anaerobic fermentation with different TCC addition and NH4 +-N pretreatment at pH 9.5 Sludge fermentation is a process about the organic substances conversion and protein, polysaccharide, SCFAs, CH4, H2 and other matters (such as CO2, lactic acid, ethanol) are the primary intermediate transformation products. A carbon mass balance is used to detect the transformation of these matters to illustrate the effect of TCC on WAS anaerobic fermentation. Fig. 2 showed the COD percentages of main composition of the different TCC addition fermenters with NH4 +-N pretreatment and pH regulation at 10 d of fermentation time. COD percentage of VSS was approximately 83.6 ± 4.2% in the initial WAS, suggesting that the raw sludge contained abundant organics. With WAS fermentation, the content of VSS significantly decreased, and its transformation products (e.g. soluble protein and polysaccharide, SCFAs, CH4, H2) increased. The COD percentages of VSS were 68.0 ± 3.4%, 65.6 ± 3.2%, 63.2 ± 3.5%, 61.7 ± 3.2%, and 60.1 ± 3.0%, respectively, in the reactors with TCC level increasing from 0 to1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS, and the COD percentages of SCFAs were respectively 11.7 ± 0.6%,12.2 ± 0.7%, 12.8 ± 0.8%, 13.3 ± 0.9%, 14.0 ± 0.9%, indicating that the presence of TCC significantly promoted sludge reduction and SCFAs production which was in agreement with our previous study (Wang et al., 2018d). Furthermore, although COD percentages of other matters (such as CH4, H2, soluble protein and polysaccharide) was much smaller than that of SCFAs among these fermenters, the COD percentages increased in all the fermenters with the increase of TCC addition, expect the CH4 percentages. Importantly, hydrogen and methane are two mainly basic components for biogas. From Fig. 2, it was observed that the COD percentages of H2 were increased from 0.39 ± 0.01% to 0.55 ± 0.06% when TCC exposure concentration was added from 0 to 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS, while the COD percentages of CH4 were decreased from 2.91 ± 0.3% to 2.1 ± 0.1% with increasing of TCC exposure, further verifying that TCC addition also enhanced hydrogen production but inhibited methanogenesis. As we known, different substances production during WAS anaerobic fermentation system are depended on abundant biological processes (such as solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis). Thus, in order to deeply understand the effect of TCC on anaerobic fermentation, it was necessary to comprehensively investigate the effect of TCC on each biological fermentation processes."
13,How does TCC affect the solubilization process?,"3.4 How does TCC affect the solubilization process? WAS is a complicated biological system and contains abundant organic substances for biodegradation. Generally, protein and carbohydrate are the primary organic compositions of WAS, but they need to be converted to soluble compounds through WAS solubilization. Fig. 3 A and B presented that the concentrations of soluble COD, soluble carbohydrate and soluble protein in the fermenters with different TCC exposure at 2 d fermentation time. It was obvious that different TCC addition greatly increasing of soluble COD, which meant that much more particulate organics became soluble substrates in WAS. The concentration of soluble COD was increased from 7689 ± 264 mg/L to 9250 ± 462 mg/L in the fermenters with TCC dosage from 0 to 1402 ± 150 mg/kg TSS. In addition, it measured the variations of soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate in presence of different TCC after 2 days fermentation. Fig. 3B showed that the soluble concentrations of COD increased with the increase of TCC dosage at the WAS fermentation system. The profile of soluble protein and soluble carbohydrate were in agreement with the depiction of soluble COD in the 2 fermentation time. For example, the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate were 450 ± 42 mg/L, 249 ± 12 mg/L, respectively, in 1402 ± 150 mg/kg TSS reactor, while the concentrations of protein and carbohydrate were 366.7 ± 18.3 mg/L, 181.7 ± 9 mg/L, respectively, in the reactor without TCC addition. The results implied that the addition of TCC was beneficial to the sludge solubilization in the fermentation system with NH4 +-N pretreatment at pH 9.5. The FTIR spectroscopy variations of fermentation sludge in presence of different TCC contents was further analyzed to deeply understand the effect of TCC on functional groups. Generally, 1800–600 cm−1 region of FTIR spectra is considered as the dominating analysis range for WAS fermentation samples, which could reveal compositions and functions of WAS and it is mainly divided into six regions, including 1800–1600 cm−1 (amide I region related to protein), 1600–1500 cm−1 (amide II region related to protein), 1500–1300 cm−1 (carboxylic group-containing and hydrocarbon-like compounds), 1300–1200 cm−1 (amide III region related to protein), 1200–900 cm−1 (compounds associated with polysaccharides and nucleic acids), 900–600 cm−1 (fingerprint region) (Feng et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017a,b). Besides, the region of 2800–3000 cm−1 is representative the compounds of saturated fatty acid and the region of 2250–2300 cm−1 reflects the interference peaks caused by CO2 in air (Ma et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2016). Hence, the regions of FTIR spectra in this study were assessed and found the detected peaks were almost aggregated in 1800–600 cm−1, indicating that the functional groups affected by TCC in the fermentation sludge were carbohydrate and protein. In this study, the profiles of FTIR for fermentation sludge with or without TCC were similar, implying that the functional groups were very semblable for the samples. But there were obviously differences between the samples with TCC exposure and without TCC addition through a closer inspection. Fig. 3C showed the variation curves and the related band assignments of FTIR spectra of fermentation sludge in presence of 0, 420 ± 21 and 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS TCC. The adsorption bands were increased at 1559 and 1635 cm−1 with TCC exposure, which represent the CO, NH2, NH and CN associated with amide I and II of protein. This indicated that TCC exposure may be contributed to stimulate the functional components production from WAS. By contrast with 0 mg/kg TSS TCC, two week adsorption peaks at 1405–1395 and 1249–1247 cm−1 also higher than that with 420 ± 21 and 1403 ± 150 mg/kg TSS TCC exposure. The absorption bands between 1405 and 1395 and 1249–1247 cm−1 are related to the CH stretching vibration, CO stretching and OH deformation of COOH, and CO stretching, namely amide III. CO stretching, NH bending and CN stretching vibration, and CO stretching and OH deformation of COOH of proteins are reported play an important role for interaction with chemical substances during anaerobic fermentation of sludge (Feng et al., 2018), due pollutants could destruct of extracellular polymeric substances of microorganisms and stimulate cells to secrete more proteins to protect cells from toxic effect (Feng et al., 2018). Another transmittance of absorption band had a great increase with TCC exposure at 1036–1032 cm−1, which was associated with CO stretching of alcohols, ethers and carbohydrates components. The bands at approximately 1032, 1559 and 1635 cm−1 were obviously changed with TCC exposure, being consistent with that TCC exposure significantly impacted protein and carbohydrates components. Moreover, the addition of TCC in fermentation sludge also increased the COC stretching vibration of polysaccharide and ring vibrations of aromatic amino acids and nucleotides compounds at band of 911, 796–793 and 684–682 cm−1. The higher absorption peaks in the fermentation sludge under TCC stress were primarily due to the higher content of carbohydrates and proteins in fermentation system with TCC exposure. This was accordant with the measured data and strongly proved TCC exposure might facilitate the solubilization during WAS fermentation system."
14,Evaluation of the effect of TCC on the bioprocesses relevant to hydrogen accumulation,"3.5 Evaluation of the effect of TCC on the bioprocesses relevant to hydrogen accumulation After WAS solubilization, anaerobic microorganisms primarily degrade the macromolecular soluble particulate organic matters produced from solubilization into low molecular weight organic matters (such as glucose, SCFAs) through hydrolysis and acidification processes. Most low molecular weight organic matters are regarded as the matrixes for biogas generation, including H2, CH4, and CO2, etc. Therefore, the relevant reaction rates and activities of hydrolysis and acidification are intimately affected the following production and consumption of hydrogen. We measured degradation rates of model substrates (BSA and L-glutamate) and their inhibition constants to evaluate the effect of TCC on this phase. Results showed that the degradation of BSA was almost not affected by TCC exposure during hydrolysis process, while the degradation of L-glutamate was significantly facilitated when TCC added into the reactors during acidification process (Table 3 ). For example, after five day fermentation, the degradation rates of BSA were range from 26.1 ± 4% to 30.1 ± 3% with the TCC exposure concentrations from0.67 to 6.7 mg/L, which were basically close to the reactor without TCC exposure (29.0 ± 2%) (Table 3). While the degradation rates of L-glutamate were 31.1 ± 4%, 38.4 ± 3%, 39.4 ± 2%, 41.4 ± 5%, respectively, in the reactors with TCC increasing from 0.67 to 6.7 mg/L, which were approximately 1.13, 1.39, 1.43, 1.49 times higher than the reactor without TCC exposure (27.6 ± 3%) at 5 d fermentation time (Table 3). Furthermore, the inhibition constant was detected by an inhibition kinetic analysis to verify the above experimental results. When TCC exposure concentrations were from 0.67 to 6.7 mg/L, the inhibition constants of BSA were range from 53.66 to 62.87 mg/L·d, which were all similar to the reactor without TCC exposure, but for L-glutamate, the inhibition contents were reduced from 70.95 to 52.13 mg/L·d with TCC increasing from 0 to 6.7 mg/L (See Supplementary data). This indicated that acidification was more sensitive to the exposure of TCC than hydrolysis, which led to much more available substrates for the following fermentation with TCC exposure. It should be also noticed that the degradation of model substrates in the control reactor was slower in this study (29.0 ± 2% and 27.6 ± 3% for BSA and L-glutamate) than in general fermentation studies (∼50%) (Xu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018b) at the final fermentation, this phenomena maybe due NH4 +-N addition and pH jointly seriously decreased the activities of fermentation microorganisms. Fig. 4 depicted the effect of TCC on the extent of degradation of butyrate, H2, acetate. Based on the dates of Fig. 4, butyrate degradation rates were no obvious fluctuations between TCC exposure reactors and the blank reactor during the whole fermentation time, indicating that TCC exposure little affected acetogenesis. However, for acetate degradation, the degradation rates were 44.5 ± 2.5%, 44.5 ± 3.5%, 39.2 ± 2.3%, 29.6 ± 1.7%, 29.1 ± 1.3%, respectively, at 6 d fermentation time when TCC exposure concentrations were from 0 to 6.7 mg/L. For hydrogen consumption, it was found that nearly 94.8 ± 4.5% of hydrogen was consumed by microbes in 0 mg/L TCC reactor after 6 days fermentation, while only 57.3 ± 2.3%, 39.5 ± 1.9%, 37.2 ± 2.8%, 28.9 ± 1.2% of hydrogen were consumed in reactors with TCC from 0.67 to 6.7 mg/L at the same fermentation time. At other fermentation time, similar inhibition tendency of TCC was also found and observed. Methonogenesis is responsible for bio-converting acetate into methane and homoacetogenesis is the dominant bioprocess for hydrogen consumption during WAS fermentation system. The greatly inhibitory of methonogenesis and homoacetogenesis caused lesser hydrogen consumption and contributed to hydrogen accumulation during WAS fermentation system. It further verified the above results by calculating and analyzing their relevant inhibition constants, which were showed in Fig. 4B. The inhibition constants of butyrate were range from 231.5 to 253.8 mg/L·d, which were almost the same in reactors with TCC from 0 to 6.7 mg/L, but the inhibition constants of acetate were importantly reduced from 220.6 to 140.0 mg/L with TCC content increasing from 0 to 6.7 mg/L and H2 inhibition constants were respectively 6.837, 3.937, 2.480, 2.411 and 1.954 mg/L·d with 0, 0.67, 2.0, 4.4, and 6.7 mg/L TCC exposure. The variations of the inhibition constants of butyrate, H2, acetate further verified that TCC almost has little impact the degradation of butyrate but seriously inhibited acetate and H2 degradation, which was consistent with the above results. In addition, during the fermentation system, hydrogen accumulation were mainly decided by the process of solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis, but acetogenesis and sulfate-reducing only have little effect on the hydrogen accumulation due less related microorganisms in WAS. Also, for sulfate-reducing, the activities of relevant microbial consortium were sensitive for their growing conditions, especially extreme pretreatment (e.g. FA, FNA or pH) (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018c), thus in this study, it was unnecessary to further research TCC’s toxicity to sulfate-reducing. According to the investigation of effect of TCC on three phases of WAS fermentation system, TCC have little effect on the hydrolysis and acetogenesis, but importantly facilitated the processes of solubilization and acidogenesis and severely inhibited the processes of homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis. This consequence demonstrated that TCC exposure leads to more adverse effect for hydrogen consumption than hydrogen production, which was the key reason why the yields of cumulative hydrogen were higher in reactors with TCC exposure than that in reactor without TCC exposure. Furthermore, this study evaluated the effect of TCC on the relative activities of key enzymes, namely protease, acetate kinase, butyrate kinase, [FeFe] hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420 (see Fig. 5 ). Protease plays an important role to transform protein to amino acids by hydrolytic microorganism in the hydrolysis process. Acetate kinase and butyrate kinase are the two main enzymes in the acidification processes, which are responsible for the generation of acetic acid and butyric acid from hydrolyzed products. [FeFe] hydrogenase is responsible for hydrogen production during the fermentation system, while carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and coenzyme contribute to hydrogen and acetate consumption in homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis. Table 4 described that the activities of protease, acetate kinase, butyrate kinase, [FeFe] hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420 in the two reactors with 0 and 912 ± 110 mg/kg TSS addition in a long-term operation. It can be seen that the activities of protease had no apparent variation between the two reactors, suggesting hydrolytic microorganisms were no affected by TCC addition. The activities of acetate kinase, butyrate kinase, and [FeFe] hydrogenase were higher 34.7 ± 2.7%, 10.8 ± 0.9%, and 51.4 ± 3.6%, respectively, in 912 ± 110 mg/kg TSS reactor than that in 0 mg/kg TSS reactor, while compared with the latter reactor, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and coenzyme F420 activities were respectively reduced 69.5 ± 8.4% and 23.2 ± 1.9% in the former reactor. It means that TCC exposure could greatly promoted the relative activities of the microbes relevant to acidification and hydrogen producers, but seriously inhibited the relative activities of the hydrogen consumers and methanogens. The results were in agreement with the above-mentioned dates."
15,Conclusions,"The main conclusions are: (1) The presence of TCC not only enhanced the hydrogen production yields but also promoted the hydrogen yield potentials and hydrogen production rates. (2) Approximately 15% of TCC was degraded during anaerobic fermentation system and 4-Chloroniline and 4, 4′-dichlorocarbanilide were the main degradation products. (3) The presence of TCC significantly promoted the sludge solubilization and acidogenesis but greatly inhibited methonogenesis and homoacetogenesis. (4) TCC could greatly increase the activities of acetate kinase and [FeFe] hydrogenase but seriously inhibited the activities of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and Coenzyme F420."
