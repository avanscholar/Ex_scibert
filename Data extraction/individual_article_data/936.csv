0,Introduction,"Photocatalysis is a field of tremendous expansion over recent years. This is evident by an increase in papers concerning the subject at International Catalysis Conferences, with very few being presented at early ICCs, whereas the most were presented at the last ICC in Munich, 2012, with several sessions being devoted to the subject of photocatalysis (see Fig. 1 ). To a degree, this interest parallels our increasing need for and interest in ‘green chemistry’ and sustainable energy/materials. With diminishing fuel resources and problems with their security and with the concern for the effects of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning, we need renewable resources for energy. Photocatalysis can be applied in a wide variety of areas, from water cleanup [1] and demineralisation [2] to novel synthesis [3], but in this paper, we concentrate on hydrogen production. The development of a ‘hydrogen economy’ is a real possibility this century, and the conversion of hydrogen chemical energy into electricity is already realised, in fuel cells for instance. However, a good, reliable and sustainable source of hydrogen has not yet been achieved, though much progress in that direction has been made in the last 20years. We [4–10], and others [11–21], have reported that alcohols can be reacted with water at ambient temperature using sunlight energy. The essential features of such technology are the requirement for a light absorbing entity, combined with a metallic component. Many consider that the role of the metal centres in these materials is as electron traps to increase the lifetime of the electron–hole pair, though we propose that they also have a major role in the chemistry itself, especially acting as active sites for alcohol dehydrogenation/decarbonylation. Much of this type of photocatalytic work has focussed on Pt as the active material, but here, we report on the activity of Au catalysts prepared in a variety of ways and compare them with the activity of Pd. Au proves to be an effective catalyst for these reactions."
1,Experimental,"Some of the photocatalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania (Degussa P25) with an acidified aqueous solution of PdCl2 or with chloroauric acid solution, made up to give the specific weight loading of metal; these samples are labelled as IW in the following text. The catalysts so produced were then dried at 200°C for 2h before calcining in air at 500°C for a further 3h. Au catalysts supported on TiO2 were also prepared using two different colloidal methods. This first involved the production of a gold sol by the Turkevich method [22], using chloroauric acid, which is then reduced and capped using citrate; such catalysts are labelled CM2. Secondly, a sol-immobilisation method was used [23]. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4.3H2O of the desired concentration (1.268×10−4 M) was prepared. To this solution, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (1wt% solution, Aldrich, weight averaged molecular weight MW=9000–10,000gmol−1, 80% hydrolysed) was added (PVA/Au (wt/wt)=0.65). Subsequently, a 0.1M freshly prepared solution of NaBH4 (>96%, Aldrich, NaBH4/Au (mol/mol)=5) was then added to form a dark red/brown solution. After 30min of sol generation, the colloid was immobilised by adding TiO2 (acidified to pH 1 by sulphuric acid) under vigorous stirring conditions. The amount of support material required was calculated so as to have a total final metal loading of 1wt%. After 2h the slurry was filtered, the solid washed thoroughly with distilled water (2l of doubly distilled water) to remove all the dissolvable species, such as Na+, Cl− and dried at 120°C overnight, followed by calcination at 400°C. XPS analysis confirmed the absence of contaminants on the surface. These samples are labelled CM1. The catalyst samples which comprised both Au and Pd were prepared by co-impregnation of TiO2 with Au and Pd, from the chloro salts, with concentrations depending on the weight ratio needed. Samples were prepared for transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterisation by dispersing the catalyst powder in high purity ethanol, followed by sonication. A drop of this suspension was then evaporated on a holey carbon film supported by a 300 mesh copper TEM grid. Samples were then subjected to bright field diffraction contrast imaging experiments in order to image the particles. The instrument use for this analysis was a JEOL-2100 LaB6 TEM operating at 200kV. For the photocatalysis measurements, the photocatalyst powders were sieved through a stainless-steel mesh (to <53μm) and were placed in 100ml of deionized water containing 110μl of methanol (Fisher Scientific 99.99%) in a Pyrex flask. The mixture was purged for 30min with Ar to remove dissolved gases, and the reactor was finally sealed under Ar before switching on the light source (400WXe arc, Oriel Model 66084). The product hydrogen was measured off-line by GC Varian 3300 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and a 2m MS 13× column. Analysis for other products (such as formaldehyde, formic acid, CO and CO2) was carried out off line using a Hiden Analytical quadrupole Hal 201 mass spectrometer, by injection of 0.5ml samples of the gas phase from the reactor through a septum, into a He flow (30mlmin−1) which is sampled in the mass spectrometer. The only measurable other product was CO2, produced in a 1:3 (±0.3) ratio with hydrogen, although the exact ratio may be time dependent in the early part of the reaction as reported by Kawai and Sakata [24,25]."
2,Results,
3,Hydrogen production from Au and Pd,"3.1 Hydrogen production from Au and Pd Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen evolution for a loading of 0.5wt% Au on P25 TiO2 and is compared with the same Pd loading, both prepared by the IW technique. Clearly gold is active for this reaction, but Pd produces more hydrogen. There is a higher molar loading of Pd here, but nonetheless, as will be shown below, it appears that Pd is a better metal for yield of hydrogen by photoreforming than Au, especially at low loadings. Fig. 3a shows the photocatalytic reactivity patterns for gold catalysts prepared by the different methods used here. There appears to be no great advantage in using methods more elaborate than IW, since that catalyst produces the highest rate among these catalysts. Calcination has a positive effect for both catalysts, Figs. 3a and 3b ; in fact, the optimum calcination temperature appears to be ∼400°C, with a small reduction in yield by calcining at 500°C. The reasons for the positive effects of calcination are probably different for the two types of catalyst. For the IW catalysts, it has been shown that the activity for CO oxidation improves with calcination due to loss of Cl from the surface, the Cl being present for the precursor chloroaurate solution, while very high temperature is detrimental due to sintering [26]. For the CM catalyst, capping agent is still present after drying, which probably impedes activity, while it is removed by calcination in air [27]. We have used TEM to examine some of these materials, and Fig. 4 shows some examples. However, it was not possible to image particles of Pd for low loadings, so here, we only show images for 5% Pd on P25 prepared by IW and for Au CM1 at 1% loading. In both cases, the particles are fairly homogeneously distributed over the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 4b and d), and the particles are roughly hemispherical in shape, with a good area of contact with the titania support. The gold particle size is ∼5nm, whereas the Pd particles are slightly bigger at ∼7nm, but are more closely packed on the surface (average spacing ∼10nm, whereas it is bigger for Au at ∼15nm). These numbers are consistent with the weight loading difference. In general, it appears that the (111) planes of the Au nanoparticles are parallel with the surface of the titania."
4,Loading dependence,"3.2 Loading dependence The dependence of the hydrogen evolution upon metal loading is shown in Fig. 5 for Au and Pd IW catalysts. Here, we see that for Pd, the dependence is similar to that which we reported previously [7], with relatively high rates at very low loadings, a shallow maximum in rate at ∼0.01–0.5wt% loading, followed by a sharp drop as loadings increase above that. It is significantly higher than for titania alone (which yields only ∼0.1ml in 3h) even at loadings as low as 0.001wt%. The results are broadly similar for gold, though with a lower overall yield. This is especially so at low loadings; at 0.01% loading, for instance, Pd gives ∼10× the hydrogen yield of Au, whereas at the maximum yield from Pd (at ∼0.1% weight loading), it is only a factor of ∼1.5 higher than the maximum yield than for Au (at ∼2% weight loading). The rate for gold appears to be higher at higher weight loadings, but drops to a very low value at loading >5%."
5,Alloyed catalysts,"3.3 Alloyed catalysts Other work at Cardiff has shown benefits of mixing Au with Pd for a variety of catalytic reactions [28,29]. Hence, we made catalysts with of Au and Pd and of AuPd by the two methods used here, as shown in Fig. 6 . A clear maximum in rate was found for the colloidal preparation when we had the mixture of the two metals present. Although this is not so obvious for the IW samples, note that for the Pd sample, there is normally a strong decrease in rate with an increase in loading from 0.5% to 1% (Fig. 5 and [7]), and hence, we believe that even for these samples, there is real synergic effect between Au and Pd. We have no direct evidence of alloying here, but others have reported alloying for these types of catalysts [30]). The main evidence of alloying is really this different behaviour in the reactivity, which mimics other catalytic behaviour for such catalysts systems which we have reported at Cardiff, as discussed below."
6,Photocatalytic reforming of biofuels,"3.4 Photocatalytic reforming of biofuels A range of oxygenates can be reformed at ambient temperature, under anaerobic conditions using these kinds of catalysts. We have previously reported the results for Pd, which showed that a wide range of such molecules can yield hydrogen in this way [10,11], and some requirements which dictate whether or not a particular molecule can be reformed are discussed below. Gold is also successful at reforming such molecules, and Fig. 7 below shows results for a number of them. Here, it can be seen that primary and secondary alcohols successfully produce hydrogen, while an alkane (heptane) and an aromatic (toluene) produced very little hydrogen (not shown), and the tertiary alcohol, tert-butanol, produced much less than for the other alcohols."
7,Discussion,
8,General,"4.1 General We have shown that Pd and Au loaded on titania are both successful catalysts for the photoreforming of oxygenates. It is generally the case that Pd produces higher yields of hydrogen, and indeed, the peak rate of production (as a function weight loading) is higher for Pd than for gold. It must be noted, however, that the rate per mole of metal is higher for Au, as we pointed out in an earlier publication [4]. However, in some ways, it is surprising that gold is active at all, in the sense that gold was generally considered to be an inactive metal. However, we now know, after the pioneering work of Haruta [31] and Hutchings [32], that in nanoparticle form, it is indeed reactive in heterogeneous catalysis, and so it proves to be the case for photocatalytic reforming too. There are other, but relatively few works which have also shown photoreactivity of gold [see 18,17,33 for instance], most work reported uses Pt as the metal component. We will now consider some more details of this particular kind of reactivity."
9,The mechanism of the reaction,"4.2 The mechanism of the reaction The reaction on Pd occurs in several steps, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The most catalytically active component of the catalyst is the metal nanoparticle, and studies on model materials have indicated exactly what the form of this reactivity is on Pd, and it can be summarised by the characteristic catalytic properties of Pd. For alcohols, it is generally a decarbonylation catalyst, that is, the first step in this reaction is (1) RCH 2 OH → RH + CO a + H 2 Here, CO a refers to CO remaining on the surface in the adsorbed state, because it is relatively strongly adsorbed and stable at ambient temperature. This reactivity pattern is manifested in studies on well-defined, pure single crystals of Pd [33] and on powdered catalysts by TPD [34]. The reaction stops when the surface becomes self-poisoned by CO and is analogous to the self-poisoning of the precious metals in automotive applications when the engine is first started and is cold. Similarly here, the catalyst does not give steady-state hydrogen production until the system is exposed to light. Hydrogen production does begin when the material is exposed to light, due to band-gap excitation in the titania, which produces electron–hole (e–h) separation, the holes here being highly oxidising species (2) Ti 4 + - O 2 - + hv → Ti 3 + ( e - ) + O - ( h + ) We propose, from the Ockham’s Razor principle, that it is this O− species that is the active oxidant that removes CO from the metal as follows (3) O - + CO a → CO 2 + V o - Of course, we recognise that, in the aqueous environment, a variety of other species have been proposed as the active species, such as hydroxyl [35] and peroxyl species [36], though evidence is rather scant and often contradictory in the literature, partly due to the low steady-state level and short lifetimes of these entities. The final step in the catalytic cycle is then the refilling of the anion vacancy, V o - , produced on the titania surface (4) H 2 O + Ti 3 + + V o - → H 2 + Ti 4 + + O 2 - For gold, the situation is a little different, since we have shown that the water–gas shift reaction (CO+H2O) does not happen photocatalytically at ambient temperature for Au [37], whereas it does on Pd [6]. This is probably because CO is much more weakly adsorbed on Au and so has negligible surface coverage under these circumstances, whereas it absorbs strongly on Pd. Further, it is likely that the intermediates involved in the reaction are more stable on Au (since it is a less reactive metal) than they are on Pd. We have previously shown that methoxy is unstable on Pd at ambient temperature, decomposing to gas-phase hydrogen and leaving CO to self-poison the surface [33], and that formate is also unstable [40]. In contrast, Outka and Madix have shown that formate does not thermally decompose until ∼340K on a well-defined gold surface [38]. Further, we recently showed that Au/P25 catalysts are combustion catalysts for methanol oxidation in the gas phase, and DRIFTS and TPD indicate the presence of methoxy and formate species, the latter being produced on gold, and being stable at ambient temperature [39]. Thus, rather than CO being the self-poison for the reaction in the absence of light, we propose that it is an intermediate species on the surface which is present before exposure to light, and which is then photolysed to produce CO2 and hydrogen in the gas phase. Another factor which may result in differences in performance between gold and palladium is the different electron affinities of the two metals. Au has a much higher electron affinity than Pd (4.1eV vs 0.6eV), and so, it is possible that its electron-trapping capability is higher. This, in turn, may affect the stability of surface intermediates (by the Au nanoparticles having higher net charge than Pd) and the e–h recombination efficiency of the material. Similarly, the difference in performance between IW and CM catalysts could be due to differences in detailed morphology and interaction with the support, which may then also affect such charging. However, we have no information about the charge state of the nanoparticles at present, especially in the in situ environment."
10,The loading dependence,"4.3 The loading dependence The loading dependence for Pd shows a broad maximum between ∼0.1% and 0.5%. The explanation for this was that the active site for the reaction was located at the periphery of the metal nanoparticles where there is an interface between surface titania and the metal surface, which is understandable since this is where reaction (3) above would be expected to take place. Thus, the important thing is to maximise the perimeter length, where the active sites are, and once the particles get too big they begin to touch and above that loading the perimeter sites diminish. However, this model predicts a maximum in rate at much higher loadings (∼10% [7]), and so, the model was modified to introduce a zone around the metal particle, some way remote from it (hence decreasing the loading for zone overlap and reduction in the numbers of active sites) at which the rate-limiting step occurs. The exact nature of this zone is unclear, but one possibility is related to diffusion of the active oxygen involved in the reaction; it is only at that location that it can be found in significant quantity, due to annihilation by electrons located on the metal nanoparticles at close approach. For gold, we similarly have a maximised rate at relatively low loadings, and so, a similar explanation applies. However, the maximum occurs at higher metal loadings than for Pd, which may imply that, for a similar atomic loading (∼ twice the weight of Pd, which has a lower atomic weight) the particle size for gold is higher, and the particle density is lower."
11,Au–Pd alloyed catalysts,"4.4 Au–Pd alloyed catalysts In previous work, we have shown that Pd is an active metal for enabling photocatalytic methanol reforming [6,8,10], and work elsewhere also shows that Au–Pd alloys have benefits for a range of reactions, such as peroxide synthesis [28] and selective oxidations [29]. Hence, our attempts here to make alloys of the two metals for photocatalysis, since both have shown activity for photoreforming individually. From Fig. 6, such an effect is also clear for photocatalytic reforming of methanol, at least for the CM catalysts. However, for the IW catalysts, we must note that increasing the weight loading of the two metals independently does not give such an increase in yield. For Pd, increasing loading to 1% actually results in a decrease in rate by ∼20% [8], and Fig. 5 shows little change in the Au rate with increased loading to 1%. These two effects should give a significantly reduced rate for the alloy, but instead, we have a similar rate, indicating some synergy in the operation of the mixed material and also showing the likelihood of alloying between the two components. Thus, we believe that there is indeed a beneficial effect of having both metals present. Besides this, we do not have a good idea of how homogeneous IW catalysts are, though for Au–Pd catalysts used for VAM synthesis, for instance, it has been reported that they are indeed very heterogeneous, with varying Au–Pd ratio within individual metal particles. Based on previously published results [23,27–29], the mean particle size of the Au x Pd y nanoparticles was in the 3–5nm range. In the case of Au–Pd/TiO2 catalysts, the metal particles were found to be random, homogeneous Au–Pd alloys with an fcc structure, based on the previous STEM-HAADF and XEDS studies. XPS analysis verified that the monometallic Au and Pd and bimetallic Au–Pd catalysts synthesised by sol-immobilisation method contain Au in the metallic state, and the majority of Pd is also in the metallic state. We can assume that the enhancement of catalytic activity by using Au–Pd random alloys could be due to enhancement of the rate of trapping photo-excited electrons therefore minimising the recombination process based on the hypothesis that we improve the capability of the storage of photo-excited electrons by using alloy metal nanoparticles. An increase in the storage of photo-excited electrons will lead to an enhancement in terms of catalytic activity. Another reason that the alloyed materials appear to give better yields is likely to be due to a change in stability of the important intermediates involved in the reaction on the metal surfaces, (Fig. 8 for example), either adsorbed CO (on Pd [4–7]) or other intermediates such as the methoxy or formate which are probably stable on the gold [26]. Alloying Pd with Au is likely to destabilise CO, while somewhat increasing the stability of organic intermediates. It is likely that both of these roles, e–h lifetime extension, and intermediate stability adjustment are important and may indeed be related."
12,Reactivity variation for different alcohols,"4.5 Reactivity variation for different alcohols It is clear from the data in Fig. 7 that a wide range of oxygenate molecules are active for these kinds of photoreforming reactions. However, we showed earlier that some are inactive, and this includes carboxylic acids and ketones. It appears that a number of reactivity rules apply to these systems [10,11]. Most important of these is that the oxygenate must have a hydrogen α to the oxygenate functional group. Thus carboxylic acids and ketones are inactive because they do not have that function, with the sole exception of formic acid, which we have shown previously does not even need light to decompose on Pd [10] because the formate is unstable on that metal at ambient temperature [40]. Further, it appears that hydrogen is generally produced from the alcohol function and the adjacent α-hydrogen, with a further mole of hydrogen from water splitting, which occurs (effectively) by the water–gas shift reaction. Thus for methanol, the only products are hydrogen and CO2, but for longer chain alcohols, alkanes are given as products, following the reaction route as follows RR ′ CHOH + H 2 O → RH + R ′ H + CO 2 + H 2 Thus, for methanol, three moles of hydrogen are produced per mole of methanol, whereas for ethanol, methane is the alkane product [10,11]. Diols and triols are excellent hydrogen producers, since more hydrogen is produced per mole of reactant organic. Glycerol produces seven moles of hydrogen per mole of glycerol and for Pd showed the highest rate of hydrogen production of the various alcohols [9]. Thus, a range of molecules, which are proposed as keys for the biorefinery of the future, are good for hydrogen production, including ethanol, glycerol (a major by-product of biodiesel synthesis), and indeed, even sugars themselves work and may make attractive sources of hydrogen [41,42]."
13,Conclusions,"Gold is shown to be an active component in catalysts for the photoreforming of alcohols to produce hydrogen, including the use of renewables, which thus makes part of a potential clean cycle for hydrogen production. It appears to show lower activity than Pd, especially at low loadings, but alloying the two metals shows some synergy and a benefit in activity. Like palladium, gold is able to reform a wide variety of alcohol species, including biofuels."
