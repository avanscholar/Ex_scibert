0,Introduction,"The composting belongs among the important technologies for disposal of biologically degradable waste. Thecomposting represents the controlled decomposition process ofbiologically degradable waste by means ofmicroorganisms (Seo et al., 2004). The main advantage ofcomposting is the recovery of nutrients and carbon sequestration by the formation of humic substances. Other technologies (with the higher added value of new products) aresought to apply the principles of the circular economy. In the case of processing waste from the production of fruit beverages, it is a compositionally variable mixture of wastes with a high proportion of wastes derived from citrus fruits (CPW – citrus peel waste), which does not allow for a simple technological solution. The processing of citrus fruit generates high amounts of side products: pulp and peels containing juice rich in sugars, hemicellulose, cellulose, pectin, and essential oils (EOs). Citrus waste can be utilised as a source of fibres, pectin, flavonoids, substrate for fermentation (Patsalou et al., 2019), and EOs extraction. Many compounds in EOs have strong antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, phytotoxic, and insecticide properties, which can complicate composting processes and consequent utilisation of composts. Adverse effects of CPW on soil microflora and in some cases, even possible destruction of the aquatic ecosystems was described by Zema et al. (2018). The composting of waste from the processing of citrus fruits is complicated by low pH value, high moisture, the occurrence of antimicrobial components of essential oils, and residues ofpesticides. Citrus waste is usually composted together with other lignocellulose agricultural plant and animal waste (Gelsomino et al., 2010). Chemicals of basic reaction are often added to ensure the adjustment of pH value and prevent the non-desirable fermentation. The processes of decomposition of citrus waste should be suppressed to prevent the deterioration of the input raw material for the applied technology. Inrelationship with ensuring the requirements forutilisation ofbiodegradable waste inthe framework of End ofWaste, there is an increase infinancial expenses that are not compensated due to therelatively low market value ofthefinal products: composts from food waste (FW) recycling (Voběrková et al., 2020). Theother problem is represented by potential risks from theapplication of composts produced from FW, which can be caused by ecotoxicity, salinity, the occurrence of pesticides and other factors (Kucbel et al., 2019). Phytotoxicity of composts produced from the waste of fruit and vegetables is an important environmental problem that limits their utilisation (Sall et al., 2019). Thetransfer of organic compounds (water-extractable organic matter, WEOM) to the aqueous medium is controlled by many factors andparameters (temperature and pressure), which involve: solubility, polarity, theoccurrence of other organic compounds, processes ofcompetition and inhibition between compounds and interaction between the root system ofplants, the compost and microorganisms (Monda et al., 2017). Only limited information oncompounds that are released from thecompost into aqueous leachate and can play the key role from the point of view ofecotoxicity of the final product isavailable in the literature. In most cases, phytotoxicity isonly attributed tothepolar compounds, i.e.,water-soluble compounds. The modern analytical technique – Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction and twister (SBSE) was used to identify compounds with potentially toxic properties released from acidulocomposts. The possibility was also studied todecrease theleachability of organic compounds from composts using the addition of a suitable bulking agent during the production of composts (e.g., sawdust). Identification of both polar and non-polar compounds of various solubility using SBSE in combination with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) for analysis of aqueous leachate made the new understanding ofphytotoxicity causes possible. It was found by SBSE extraction and GC/MS analysis ofWEOM from composts that it is formed by both polar and non-polar compounds with various solubility. The aqueous leachate also contained typically non-soluble non-polar compounds (e.g., limonene and myrcene) with known phytotoxicity. The aim is to identify potentially toxic compounds in aqueous leachate from acidulocomposts and verify the possibility ofminimisation of their leachability by the addition of bulking agent."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Input waste from fruit and vegetables for compost production was obtained from theproducer ofthebeverage “Kofola”. Kofola Enterprise is one of the most important producers of non-alcoholic beverages in Central Europe. The base of Kofola drink is sirup KOFO produced from 14 plant and fruit substances like extracts from apples, cherries andredcurrant, or plant oil. Kofola is produced with various flavours: citrus (lemon), grapefruit, sour cherry, apricot, raspberry, pineapple, blackcurrant, and gooseberry. It is exported toSlovakia, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Russia, Austria, and Hungary. The annual production is255,000 m3. Biological waste from the production of Kofola is formed mostly by citruses (peels and pulp of oranges, grapefruits, and limes), berries (blackcurrant, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries), stone fruits (apricots and sour cherries) and apples. Exotic fruit is represented by pineapple and vegetables by watermelon. Waste also contains remnants ofplants (liquorice) and guarana. In order to reduce ecotoxicity, two materials were added to the final product: certified biochar Woodchar (Sonnenerde, Austria) made from untreated wood in the PYREG-Reactor at600 °C, and bentonite (a rock characterised by a high content ofclay minerals –montmorillonite 80%) from the Rokle deposit at Kadaň (Czech Republic) which was used asinorganic sorbent."
3,Methods,"2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Composting The composting was performed in the automatic composter GreenGood GG02 (OKLIN, Hong Kong) intended for households and small businesses (cafes, school cafeterias). The input capacity of this composter is approximately 10 kg of the fresh raw material. It was used for laboratory experiments at the temperature between 40 and 65 °C during closed cycle. Thecomposting process uses bacteria AciduloTM – natural polyextremophile organisms of the microbial strain Firmicutes supplied by the producer. These bacteria have the key importance for the hydrolysation of polysaccharides and the degradation of lignocelluloses. Amore detailed description of the utilised technology and the properties of the composts thus prepared is given by Růžičková et al. (2020). This modern composting technique was selected because it allows significant shortening of the composting processes. The quality of composting products obtained by this technology was not yet sufficiently described in the literature. According to the manufacturer, composting can require 24 h only. Inour case, the composting lasted for 21 days atthe temperature of approximately 65 °C under theconditions of acid pH 3.5–6.5 and permanent mixing. Fresh raw material (3 kg) was delivered to the composter each week. The total input was 8.9 kg ofwaste containing 69% ofmoisture. Theinput of waste was composted alone (compost CK) and mixed with sawdust in ratio 4:1 (compost CK20) and 1:1 (compost CK50). Both biochar and bentonite were added to the compost after the composting process was completed. 2.2.2 Water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) WEOM is the soluble fraction of organic matter extracted from the compost. WEOM was determined by the modified method, according to Guigue et al. (2014). Thecompost sample ofgrain size less than 2 mm was dynamically leached (using shaking) in the dilution of1:10 (100 g sample in1000 ml of ultrapure water) for 60 min and consequently filtered on0.45 μm pore-size cellulose acetate filters. This method of sample preparation was selected to enable utilisation of the leachate for determination of dissolved organic matter (DOC) according to the standard ISO 20236:2018 and nitrates according to ISO 10304-1:2007. Electrical conductivity was determined according to EN 13038:2011 and pH value according to EN 15933:2012. Humic and fulvic acids were determined by the “New Standardized Method for Quantification ofHumic and Fulvic Acids” described by Lamar et al. (2014). Thedetermination of organic compounds in this work was performed by the technique ofStir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE, Gerstel, Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany). The method is based on sorptive extraction, whereby the solutes are extracted into a polymer, such aspolydimethylsiloxane, coated on a stir bar (Ochiai et al., 2018). The unspecific sorption of polar compounds with log(Kow) > 4 takes place. The time of sorption was 60 min, and the volume ofleachate was 10 ml. Analysed compounds were then desorbed from the twister using thermal desorption (TDU3.5+ Gerstel). The programme of the thermal desorption was: 50 °C (1 min) until 300 °C (5 min), the temperature ramp 5 °C/min. The separation of organic compounds was carried out under conditions: 40 °C (4 min) to320 °C (4 min), the temperature ramp 5 °C/min. The identification and quantification of organic compounds were performed using standards and the Agilent MassHunter Quantitative and Unknown Analysis programmes. The leachate analysis results were recalculated to express the influence of the addition ofsawdust on the leachability of individual compounds. The determination of percentage losses of an analysed components after addition of 20% of sawdust (CK20) and 50% of sawdust (CK50) is compared with the value for compost without an addition of sawdust (CK). The determinations of leached amounts (mg/L) for inputs of 50 and 80% of fruit waste (i.e.,addition of 50 or 20% sawdust, respectively) were recalculated for 50 and 80% of compost, respectively. Measured values (McCK20 and McCK50) were subtracted from these theoretical values TcCK20 and TcCK50. These values (Cs) represent the effect of sawdust addition (decrease of leachability ofcompounds) due to changes in matrix composition and processes of sorption on solid particles (Eq. (1)): (1) Cs = TC CK2 0 - - MC CK2 0 mg / L It can be converted to percentage efficiency, which was described as Eq. (2): (2) ECs = Cs / TC CK2 0 × 1 00 % The efficiency of leachability decreasing can be expressed as Eq. (3): (3) E = 1 00 - - C CK2 0 / C CK × 1 00 % Similarly for CCK50 where C are corresponding concentrations. The total efficiency of leachability decreasing can be divided into two parts. One part is caused by the addition of sawdust (ECs) and the other part is caused by the composting processes (ECc) involving biological decomposition and volatilization, which were described as Eq. (4) and Eq. (5): (4) E = ECs + ECc (5) ECc = E - - ECs These two parts of the efficiency of leachability decreasing are illustrated in the figures. 2.2.3 Solid sample analysis Lignin in the compost and input material was determined by the method of Klasson. Cellulose and hemicellulose were determined by the method described by Saura-Calixto et al. (1983). The determination of monosaccharides was performed according to the DuBois method. Ultimate analysis – determination of carbon, nitrogen andhydrogen in the compost was done using elemental analyser FlashSmart (ThermoScientific, USA) according to the standard ISO10694:1995, and ISO 13878:1998. 2.2.4 Ecotoxicity Most information about the ecotoxicity of organic compounds is gathered for these test organisms: planktonic crustaceans Daphnia magna, algae Scenedesmus subspicatus and vascular plant seeds of white mustard Sinapis alba or lettuce Lactuca sativa. Leachate from biochar was used for the ecotoxicity tests, which were carried out according to standardised methods: ISO 6341:2012, ISO8692:2012, and Sinapis alba OECD test No. 208. The values for the evaluation of toxic effects on aquatic invertebrates (Daphnia magna) were taken from the ECHA Europe database as key values for chemical safety assessment. As part of the evaluation of phytotoxic effects, only values showing the effect of the concentration ondamage to the test organism (limits are lower than the established concentrations) are provided in the tables."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Composition of waste from the production of non-alcoholic beverages with fruit additives,"3.1 Composition of waste from the production of non-alcoholic beverages with fruit additives The main components of the fruit waste are formed by pulp, seeds, and peels of citruses. Citrus plants belong to the family Rutaceae which include fruit trees such as orange, mandarin, lime, lemon, sour orange, andgrapefruit. The composition of individual kinds ofcitruses is very variable and depends on citrus species and on the part of the plant (peels, pulp, and juice). Peels form>50% of waste from the processing ofcitrusfruit (Mamma et al., 2008). Important components of citrus peelsareformed by saccharides (5.5–21%), proteins (up to7%, except lemon peels) and pectin (13–42%) as was published by Pathak et al. (2017). Concentrations of the main components in input raw material (Table1 ) are consistent with values reported by Pathak et al. (2017). The aqueous leachate is acid and has a high electrical conductivity that can influence ecotoxicity. Thecompost with a surplus of salts causes inhibition in ecotoxicological tests already in the case when the value ofelectrical conductivity surpasses 2.0–2.6mS/cm (Pivato et al., 2016). Comparing the concentrations of most of the compounds in WEOM from feedstock and CK, it is apparent that the concentrations in WEOM from CK are approximately two-fold higher than those from feedstock (Table 2 ). The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aqueous leachate from composts increase in comparison with the input. The addition of 20% of sawdust to the waste decreased DOC leachability by 12.3%; the pronounced decrease (28%) is caused by the addition of 50% ofsawdust. The loss of DOC depending on the sawdust ratio shows a linear dependency. DOC in leachate from composts contains important amounts of monosaccharides. Thedetermined values were 83 g/kg (61.5% from DOC) in composts with the addition of20% of sawdust and 113 g/kg (73.5% from DOC) in composts without the addition. Other important components ofDOC from CK20 can be fulvic acids (40.8 g/kg) and humic acids (10.9 g/kg). The addition of sawdust to the compost batch does not significantly affect the leaching of other inorganic elements (K, Na and Cl) either and has only resulted in a reduction in the leachability of Ntot and N-NO3 due to a reduction in the original input concentration by the amount of sawdust added."
6,Chemical compounds influencing the ecotoxicity of water leachate,"3.2 Chemical compounds influencing the ecotoxicity of water leachate The aqueous leachates from fruit waste contain approximately 30% higher number oforganic compounds (175) compared with the leachates prepared from composts (121). Thedominant group of organic compounds inleachates is formed by various dissoluble and non-dissoluble polar (carboxylic acids) and non-polar terpenes, terpene alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and hydrocarbons. These compounds usually represent components of essential oils ofplants. Citrus essential oils can contain from 20to60 compounds which are mostly (from85to 99%) of volatile character (monoterpenes sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, ketones, acids, alcohols, and esters); non-volatile compounds only represent a small part of 1–15%. The major components of the compost extract without added saw dust are carboxylic acids and their esters (70%) and alcohols (25%). The concentrations of carboxylic acids and their esters (CA + E) falls significantly with the addition of saw dust to 32% in CK50 and 36% inCK20. 3.2.1 Terpenes Terpenes belong to the group of isoprenoids that are highly resistant against physicochemical degradation but can be decomposed by isoprene degrading bacteria (Srivastava and Singh, 2019) or evaporate at increased temperature. From the point of view of concentrations of individual terpene compounds in the leachate originating from input material, the most important monoterpenes include D-limonene (5.2 g/kgd.m.) and myrcene (2.06 g/kgd.m.). Incitrus fruits, D-limonene (C10H16) has thehighest concentration from monoterpenes. The toxicity of terpenes depends on the solubility. Monoterpenes that have increased lipophilic properties (limonene) cause lower inhibition of seed germination and inhibition ofroot growth compared with oxygenated monoterpenes (linalool), which are soluble in water (Mancini et al., 2009). Alldegradation products of monoterpenes are bacteriostatic andphytotoxic in low millimolar concentrations because they cause lipid peroxidation inmembranes. Limonene concentration > 0.15 mg/L causes the germination and seed inhibition of cress (Martino et al., 2010). Myrcene is almost insoluble in water and therefore has lower phytotoxicity for seed germination than limonene, β-ocimene and terpinene. Oxygenated monoterpenes are represented in leachates by terpene alcohols: terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol, linalool, geraniol and carveol. Terpinen-4-ol, α-terpineol and β-terpineol are isomers of terpineol (C10H18O). Among oxygenated monoterpenes in the leachate from input material, linalool C10H18O (1830 mg/kgd.m.) and α-terpineol (1496 mg/kg d.m.) have the highest concentrations. During composting, there should be a decrease in D-limonene and myrcene and an increase in their decomposition products during microbial transformation. These processes were not confirmed inthecomposts CK (Table 3 ). Sesquiterpenes present in the leachates from fruit waste and composts include nootkatone derived from grapefruit, caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide, the main oxidation product ofcaryophyllene. The absence ofcaryophyllene oxide in leachates from composts indicates alow degree of oxidation during the composting. Phenol derivatives of terpenes (monoterpenoid derivatives of phenol) are in the aqueous leachate from theinput material and the compost CK represented by thymol and carvacrol. Thymol (C10H14O) isavolatile monoterpenoid phenol derivative of cymene (C10H14). Carvacrol (C10H14O) is a volatile isomer of thymol. Carvacrol was not identified intheleachate from the composts prepared from fruit waste with the addition of sawdust; itwas only found in the leachate from the compost CK in the concentration of 18.3 mg/L. Compared to feedstock during the composting, concentrations of terpenes in the leachate from the compost decrease by 45%, with theaddition of 20% of sawdust by 75% and with 50% of sawdust up to 90%. Incomparison with CK, the addition of 20% of sawdust decreases theconcentrations of terpenes by 50% and in the case of CK50 by 78%. The addition of bulking agent influences the final concentrations of terpenes in the compost. From terpenes, the highest decrease during thecomposting without the addition of bulking agent has from oxygenated monoterpenes terpinenen-4-ol and geraniol (60–70%) and from monoterpenes D-limonene and myrcene (>50%). After the addition of 20% of sawdust, thehighest decrease (>65%) was shown by D-limonene, myrcene, α-terpineol and, after the addition of 50% of sawdust, concentrations in the extract decreased by an average of81% (Fig. 1 ). Terpenes capable of rapid volatilization include myrcene and D-limonene with Henry law constant below 10-3 atm m3/mol. Significant volatile terpenes include geraniol, linalool, perillyl alcohol, thymol and nootkatone, which have Henry law constant ranging from 10-3 to 10-5 atm m3/mol. The addition of sawdust to the feedstock significantly influences the flow of their release into the leachate. However, the sorption processes of terpenes on the added lignocellulose material may inhibit the degradation processes. Sorption processes may influence terpenes that have a log KOW value > 4.4 (myrcene, limonene, caryophyllene). For other terpenes with a log KOW value > 3.12–3.4, the probability of sorption is lower (carveol, citronellol, thymol, α-terpineol, carvacrol). For myrcene, an exponential relationship was found between myrcene concentration in the leachate and the added amount of sawdust. Polynomial dependence was found for D-limonene, thymol, nootkatone, citronellol, and α-terpineol. The linear relationship between the added sawdust and the concentrations in the leachate was found for linallol, caryophyllene, carveol, geraniol, and terpinene-4-ol. In this case, the changes in the concentrations in the leachate is influenced only by the addition of sawdust and is not affected by other factors, including volatility, sorption, orreduction of microbial degradation. For other terpenes, the decrease ofconcentrations can be caused either by their volatilisation and release into the air under thermophile conditions inautomatic composters (González et al., 2020) or by their adsorption on lignocellulose biomass (Suhas et al., 2016) supplied inthe form of sawdust. Absorption of terpene is influenced bythe chemical composition, concentration, and polarity of the compounds, aswell as the presence of other chemical constituents (disaccharides such as lactose andsaccharose increase absorption, probably by a “salting out” effect of less non-polar flavour compounds), pH value (the best adsorption conditions are at pHvalue of 3–5), temperature, and relative humidity (Sajilata et al., 2007). The high content ofsaccharose and pH value around3 in the aqueous leachate from the composts would support the sorption processes onlignocellulose matrix(sawdust). The decrease of terpene concentrations compared with the input material approximately by6 g/kg is probably caused by their volatilisation rather than microbial decomposition because the environment can be toxic forbacteria. The concentration of terpenes in the leachate decreased by 87% compared with the input material after the addition of 50% of sawdust. However, the values of LC50 for Daphnia magna are higher than the remaining concentrations of terpenes intheaqueous leachate for most of the compounds (Table 3). Similar results are also valid for plants. The final concentrations ofterpenes inthe leachate can still cause ecotoxicity. 3.2.2 Terpene aldehyde and ketone WEOM contains nine compounds of the terpene aldehydes group, of which seven can be assumed to have phytotoxic properties based on literary data: hexanal, heptanal, octanal, decanal, dodecanal, 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (Table 4 ). Mostoftheidentified chemical compounds are parts of citrus components. The exceptions represent 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde contained in bananas and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde contained incoffee. Themicrobial decomposition of hydrocinnamic acid contained in plant phenolics can be asource of acetophenone determined in the leachate from fruit waste. Moreover, the leachate from the compost without the addition of sawdust contains acetone (4.2 mg/kg), which is absent in the leachates from the composts with theaddition of sawdust. Acetophenone has the highest concentrations in the leachates from thecompost. The concentrations of all compounds from the aldehyde and ketone group in the leachates decreased after the addition of sawdust. It decreases on average by 43.8% in the CK20 compost leachate and falls on average by 62.8% in the CK50 leachate. The linear relationship between the drop in concentration in the leachate and the amount of added sawdustis shown by compounds with high solubility: hexanal (6 g/L), pentanal (14 g/L), heptanal (1.5–2.5 g/L), and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde. The polynomial dependency between the concentration in the leachate and the amount of added sawdust was found for dodecanal and decanal with Henry’s law constant below 10-3 atm m3/mol that is limit for compounds with fast volatilisation and octanal, vanillin, and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. Except of vanillin (10 g/L), all these compounds are characterised by low solubility (0.56–29.4 mg/L). The decrease of concentrations in leachate from the mixture with sawdust isinfluenced bytheaddition of bulking agent (dilution) but also by adsorption onlignocellulose matrix contained in sawdust and decrease of intensity of the composting processes (volatilization and microbial degradation). The addition of 20% of sawdust removes 12% of aldehyde and ketone concentrations from the leachate while the composting processes remove 25% (Fig. 2 ). The addition of 50% sawdust results in an average decrease of 23% in aldehyde and ketone concentrations and around 40% decrease is caused by composting processes. Acetophenone has a low log KOW value, in the range of 1.59–1.65, and thus it has low biosorption ability. The decrease in acetophenone concentrations after the addition of sawdust is related to a decrease in the decomposition processes. Values log KOW for aldehydes vary: vanillin 1.2, decanal 3.4 and dodecanal 4.9. Compounds with a log KOW value>4.5 can be assumed to have the tendency to adsorb more readily to organic matter. Of the compounds identified in the aqueous leachate, dodecanal is the only compound with a high log KOW value where concentration loss may be affected by sorption processes. The efficiency of lignin to attract organic compounds depends on both the physical propertiesofthe adsorbent and the chemical andphysical interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate (Supanchaiyamat et al., 2019). Despite the high reduction in aldehyde concentration in both CK20 and CK50 leachates, three compounds out of nine remained higher than the EC50 value for Daphnia magna (decanal and octanal 10times; heptanal 3times). The values published for inhibition ofgermination andgrowth of plant roots (Lactuca sativa) can represent the problem; they are at least 100 × lower than theconcentrations measured in the aqueous leachates (Table4). 3.2.3 Alcohols Fatty alcohols occur in a free and esterified form in many vegetable waxes. The aliphatic alcohols are natural components of apples and oranges. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be converted to fatty alcohols by many organisms, including bacteria with enzymes. C6-C12 fatty alcohols are likely to volatise quickly. Fatty alcohols up to chain length C18 are biodegradable, with lengths up to C16 biodegrading within 10 days completely. Theconcentrations ofalcohols in the aqueous leachate from the compost CK are approximately 4–5higher than those intheleachates from CK20 and CK50. During composting with the addition of 20% sawdust, an average removal of 73 ± 28% alcohols from the leachate while the addition of 50% of sawdust caused removal of 80 ± 29%. The 20% addition of sawdust influences the decrease of concentrations in aqueous leachate for 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-furfurylalcohol, 1-nonanol, 1-octanol, 1-dodecanol, and 1-decanol more than the 50% addition. The decrease in concentrations in relation to the addition of sawdust can be expressed by polynomial dependency. Reducing the concentrations of alcohols in leachate is caused by a reduction of the fermentation processes and by volatilisation. Lignin has potential for moderating the product inhibition that occurs during fermentations. Thenumber ofindividual compounds in the aqueous leachate is identical even after the addition of sawdust. Fatty alcohols possess only moderate acute toxicity for aquatic organisms. In general, in their range of water solubility no toxic effects are observed. Fatty alcohols represent a very low risk for environmental contamination (Sanderson et al., 2013). 3.2.4 Tannins and compounds containing phenols Tannins are water-soluble polyphenols present in many plants that can bind and precipitate proteins. Leachate from logs and wood chips contain tannins, lignin and phenolic compoundstoxic to aquatic life (Kannepalli et al., 2016). Phenolic compounds and their derivatives, e.g. catechol, are considered priority pollutants because they are harmful toliving organisms even at low concentrations (Cohen et al., 2009). Catechol is a component of lignin. The concentrations of catechol in the leachate from the compost increases after the addition ofsawdust caused by catechol in sawdust (Fig. 3 ). Leached amount of catechol proportionally increases independence on the addition ofsawdust. The high concentrations of catechol can cause ecotoxicity ofthe water leachate from the compost (Table4). In the leachates from the composts, methoxyphenols (2-methoxyphenol and 5-ethenyl-2-methoxyphenol) and 4-methylphenol were identified. There is a polynomial dependency between the amount of methoxyphenols extracted by leaching and the addition of sawdust tothecompost. The amount of leached phenolic compounds increased after the addition of 50% sawdust from 154 to 614 mg/L. The leached concentrations ofphenolic compounds are significantly higher than values of EC50 for Daphnia magna (4-methylphenol 42 × ) and values for germination ofplant seeds of Lactuca sativa approximately three times (Wang et al., 2001). 3.2.5 Coumarins Coumarins (class of lactones) are secondary metabolites of higher plants. They are also present incitruses. Coumarin suppresses input of water, delays reactivation of peroxidases, increases theactivity of dismutase, decreases the activity of enzymes. Although coumarins are easily biodegradable and up to 85% decompose after 10 days, 1.31 g/kgd.m. has been leached from CK compost. The concentrations of coumarins in the aqueous leachate decreased after the addition of sawdust (Fig. 3). The addition of sawdust may reduce degradation processes, or coumarin compounds may be adsorbed onto lignin and cellulose contained in sawdust. Coumarin has a low log KOW value (1.39), characterised by high mobility in the soil environment. It can, therefore, be assumed that the reduction of coumarins leaching after the addition of sawdust is more related to the reduction of degradation processes than to sorption processes. The relationship between the concentrations in the leachate and the addition of sawdust to the compost is determined by polynomial dependence. In the CK leachate, concentrations of all four coumarin compounds exceeded the limit for phytotoxicity (Table4). The NOEC values for Daphnia magna were significantly exceeded for all extracts. The EC50 value expressing long-term toxicity to aquatic invertebrates was exceeded only for isocoumarin even after the addition of 50% of sawdust. Concentrations of coumarins in CK20 and CK50 leachate are approximately two times higher than the concentration causing the phytotoxic effect of coumarin determined by seed germination and root growth (Araniti et al., 2015)."
7,Ecotoxicity of the water leachate from the compost,"3.3 Ecotoxicity of the water leachate from the compost The leachates contain chemical compounds that can cause ecotoxicity of aquatic organisms (Daphnia magna) and also inhibit seed germination and plant growth: terpenes, tannins and phenolic compounds, lower carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and coumarins (Fig. 4 ). Addition 20% of bulking agent causes a decrease of leachability approximately by 74%, andaddition 50% by 79%. In the CK50 leachate, where the highest decrease occurred, the EC50 concentrations of aldehyde compounds are exceeded 3.5–11 times (octanal), alcohols 46× (furfural), tannins 62× (catechol), coumarins without toxicity, and terpenes 1.1-33× (D-limonene). The EC50 value is exceeded up to 655 × for 4-methylphenol from the phenol group, which is derived from sawdust leaching. The positive influence of the addition of sawdust (CK50) results in the decrease oftheconcentrations ofspecific organic compounds iscompensated by increased leaching oftannins and phenolic compounds, which are toxic for Daphnia magna, and which also are phytotoxic. The influence of organic compounds with the phenolic group on phytotoxicity was described by Siles-Castellano et al. (2020). Phytotoxicity is a problematic indicator in terms ofthe great variety of tested plants used. The results presented in Tables 3–6 indicate thatphytotoxicity of composts may be affected by higher concentrations of decanal, catechol, 2-methoxyphenols, acetic acids and mainly terpene compounds (myrcene and D-limonene, linalool and caryophyllene). The compost without the addition of sawdust has inhibition 100% for all testing organisms; the decrease ofinhibition after the addition of sawdust is for Sinapis alba by 25% and for Lactuca sativa even by 50% (Table 5). The most problematic group is formed by terpenes. The influence of the addition of biochar on a decrease in leachability oforganic compounds was negligible. An application of biochar for decreasing the mobility oforganic pollutants has prevalently positive references in the literature. An example is apaper by Sánchez-Monedero et al. (2019), who proved that the addition 3% of biochar to the compost decreased releasing ofoxygenated volatile compounds: ketones, phenols and organic acids, but had no effect on aliphatic compounds, aromatic compounds and terpenes. The best results concerning ecotoxicity were obtained with the application of bentonite. Asignificant decrease was found for phytotoxicity, and toxicity, which was determined forDaphnia magnaandPoecilia reticulata. Terpenes are probably adsorbed by bentonite; similar results were published by Ghrab et al. (2018) for beidellite (clay mineral from the group ofmontmorillonite)."
8,Conclusions,"Both polar and non-polar chemical compounds were identified in the leachates from thecomposts and input fruit waste. The addition of sawdust causes a decrease intheconcentrations of terpene alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and terpenes. Due to the leaching of polyphenolic compounds and tannin from sawdust, their concentrations in compost increase, significantly increasing the ecotoxicity of the aqueous leachate. Automatic composters cannot be used for the separate composting of citrus waste even with the addition of sawdust because the final compost is phytotoxic. Compost is phytotoxic (inhibition > 30%) until 80% of bentonite is added."
