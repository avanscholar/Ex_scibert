0,Introduction,"Lignocellulosic biomass is surplus and low cost feedstock for sustainable biohydrogen production with upscaling options. Recent research spotlight aimed on establishment of lignocellulosic biomass with broader technical suitability for hydrogen production (Pan et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c). However, the consequences associated with the lignocellulosic biomass are that the chemical compositions of the feedstock such as cellulose and hemicellulose fraction integrate with lignin moiety. Advanced method of pretreatment, neutralization/detoxification effects have not been adequately studied and this knowledge gap should be considered towards the establishment of sustainable biofuel platform (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c; Cui et al., 2010; Mora-Pale et al., 2011). In recent years, the deoiled jatropha waste (DJW) as the lignocellulosic biorefinery platform seems promising as a low cost substrate for the recovery of fermentable sugars and its subsequent utilization in the biohydrogen production (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c, 2016a,b). Most of the hydrogen production potential of the DJW has been assessed in a small scale batch mode reaction operational system, and only few attempts made on continuous operation. In an earlier report by Kumar et al. (2015a,b,c), it was demonstrated that dilute acid (2% HCl) pretreated hydrolyzate of DJW could recover the major portion of the hemicellulosic sugars and act as a feasible substrate for hydrogen production than other pretreatment methods such as temperature, ultrasonication, alkali etc. in a batch mode operation (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c). In order to examine the further scale-up possibility of the lignocellulosic based DJW biohydrogen system, the continuous mode operation was recommended to acquire the knowledge on the relative establishment of the dominant microflora and the hydrogen production capability of the system. Low strength acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose biomass has been demonstrated in hydrogen fermentation in spite of its inhibitor formation and the heavy action on only hemicellulose fraction. This method is quite cost-effective and efficient for large scale applications (Cao et al., 2009; Lo et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2011). Sugar recovery and further utilization of those recovered sugars from DJW is gaining attention in recent years due to the abundance of this biomass in many countries, especially in Asia and Africa continents (Kumar et al., 2013; Kootstra et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2010). In our earlier reports, acid hydrolysis of DJW for the sugar release and subsequent utilization of the hydrolysates produced for the fermentative hydrogen production has been demonstrated (Kumar et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c, 2016c). In an earlier report with the same authors group has documented the continuous hydrogen fermentation of the acid pretreated hydrolysate using suspended cell systems (Kumar et al., 2016c). The major drawback observed was that washout of biomass at 24h HRT resulted in the failure of the CSTR system (Kumar et al., 2016c). Immobilization of the biomass could modestly enhance the production performances by sustaining the biomass inside the porous structures and also aid in better gas transport process inside the reactor (Kumar et al., 2016c; Sivagurunathan et al., 2014a; Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b; Sivagurunathan et al., 2015). Additionally, microbial analysis of the process could provide better information if suppose the reactor has to be restarted with enriched microbial populations. Thus, based on the aforementioned, this report seeks to advance the knowledge on the efficient use of immobilized cell system to minimize the biomass washout during the CSTR operation (suspended biomass) of the acid pretreated DJW hydrolysate in continuous systems. Additionally, microbial community dynamics through the use of PCR-DGGE analysis has been conducted to deepen the knowledge on the microbial ecology of the process."
1,Materials and methods,
2,"Microorganisms, immobilization procedure and DJW acid hydrolysate Preparation","2.1 Microorganisms, immobilization procedure and DJW acid hydrolysate Preparation The anaerobic seed sludge was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in central Taiwan. Major parameters such as COD, TS and VS were mentioned in our earlier study (Kumar et al., 2016c). The mixed microbial seed source has been stored in the refrigerator before use in the immobilization procedure. Heat pretreatment was employed as a methanogen killing step and also avoiding the growth of other unnecessary bacterial population, but enrich the spore forming Clostridia population. DJW used in this study was collected from a Jatropha biomass based biodiesel producing industry (Huneng Pvt. Ltd.) located in central Taiwan. The lignocellulose characterization (42% soluble sugars from cellulose and hemi cellulose fraction) and other parameters were mentioned in our previous study (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c). DJW acid hydrolysate was prepared using 2% HCl as hydrolyzing agent with the solid liquid ratio of 1:10 (10g DJW: 100mL of 2% HCl), which provided 11.9g reducing sugars (RS) and was used in the fermentation reaction directly. The immobilized cells were prepared by mixing the sodium alginate (2%), activated carbon prepared from the DJW itself (1%) and chitosan and silicon dioxide as (1%), respectively for the entrapment and encapsulation methods followed an earlier study (Sivagurunathan et al., 2014a; Sivagurunathan et al., 2014b). The prepared beads were dried and stored before use in the experiments."
3,Batch and continuous hydrogen fermentation,"2.2 Batch and continuous hydrogen fermentation Batch tests were done in reactors with the whole capacity of 150mL and working volume of 60mL which cover 40mL of acid pretreated hydrolysate, 12mL of seed sludge (10g of immobilized beads), 3mL for pH adjustment (either 1N NaOH or 1N HCl) and 5mL of nutrient solution. The nutrient solution was made by mixing the following inorganic supplements (mg/L): K2HPO4 125, MgCl2·6H2O 100, MnSO4·6H2O 15, FeSO4·7H2O 25, CuSO4·5H2O 5, and CoCl2·5H2O 0.12 which was modified from the formulation proposed by (Endo et al., 1982). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the vials were subjected to argon purging for 5min for the creation of strict anaerobic environment. The batch vials were kept in an incubator with the controlled rpm of 150 and temperature was maintained at 37°C. The gas production was measured in periodic intervals as expected. The produced gas was measure with a gas tight glass syringe at room conditions. All experiments were carried out in triplicates and the Mean with SD values are reported. A lab scale CSTR (continuously-stirred tank reactor) lab-scale hydrogen fermenter (working volume, 1.0 L) was operated at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 12–48h and an influent concentration obtained from the acid (2% HCl) pretreatment process (Kumar et al., 2016c). Initially the reactor was kept for 5days in batch mode in order to adapt the bacterial population to the complex substrate, and operated at a mesophilic temperature of 37°C with pH maintained at 5.5 using 1N NaOH. While the reactor was operated steadily with less fluctuation in the production performances, HRT was shortened. During CSTR operation the monitoring parameters were pH, ORP (oxidation- reduction potential), volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution and total biogas and hydrogen production. The hydrogen production efficiency in terms of HPR, HY and hydrogen content in the biogas, were monitored."
4,Analytical procedures,"2.3 Analytical procedures The analytical procedures of Standard Methods of APHA (1995) were used to determine pH and COD. The hydrogen and CO2 content was determined by a gas chromatograph (GC) having a thermal conductivity detector (China Chromatograph 8700T). The liquid samples were analyzed for SMP (alcohols and volatile fatty acids) using GC equipped with flame ionization detector (FID). Other parameters analysis procedures were reported in our previous studies (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c, 2016c). During CSTR operation the monitoring parameters were pH, ORP (oxidation- reduction potential), volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution and gas production. The hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using the hydrogen content in the biogas, hydrogen production rate (the rate of hydrogen production from the reactor, HPR. COD balance was calculated according to our earlier report (Kumar et al., 2016c)."
5,Kinetic models,"2.4 Kinetic models The kinetic analysis was conducted by curve fitting using Gompertz equation as follows, (1) H ( t ) = P · exp - exp R m · e P ( λ - t ) + 1 where, H (t) = cumulative hydrogen production (mL), P=hydrogen production potential (mL); Rm=the maximum hydrogen production rate (mL/h); e=2.71828; λ=lag phase time (h) and t=the cultivation time (h). Hydrogen production rate (HPR, mL H2/L-d) was defined as Rm value divided by the reactor working volume (0.06 L) and multiplied with 24h. Hydrogen yield (HY, mL H2/g VS) was defined as hydrogen production (mL) per gram VS (0.85g/g TS) (Kumar et al., 2016c)."
6,Microbial community analysis,"2.5 Microbial community analysis Microbial community changes in the CSTR at different HRTs were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. Total genomic DNA from effluent sample collected from the CSTR was extracted by using the Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The V6 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and the PCR product was further subjected to DGGE analysis as per the method described elsewhere (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c, 2016c)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Immobilized cell systems- batch operations,"3.1 Immobilized cell systems- batch operations Improving the cell mass retention under low HRT could be an essential factor to improve the stability of operation and the production rates as well (Lee et al., 2004). A hybrid immobilization method was developed for stable operation. Preparation method has been explained in the materials and methods section. The SEM images of the immobilized beads are shown in the Supplementary Fig 1 (Fig. S1). The stability of the prepared beads was checked in the batch fermentation and it revealed that for more than 10 cycles the beads were stable (Fig 1 ). Average cumulative hydrogen production was observed as 770ml/L. Besides, the porous structure of the immobilized beads could be observed very clearly in the SEM images (shown in Supplementary Fig, Fig S1). This might be attributed to the efficient mass transfer of the gaseous products. Additionally the lag phase time was slowly reducing from approximately 30h to 8.5h, which corresponds to the coherent biofilm adherence inside the immobilized beads. Moreover, reusability of the immobilized cells was evaluated for around 10 cycles and nearly the unchangeable production performances revealed the well-regulated fabrication and application of the immobilized cells in the hydrogen fermentation (Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c)."
9,Immobilized cell system- CSTR operations at various HRTs,"3.2 Immobilized cell system- CSTR operations at various HRTs Washout of biomass primarily occurs at lower HRT in case of CSTR operation ultimately resulting in the instability of the system or inefficient production performances (Chen et al., 2001). Therefore, improving the cell mass retention under low HRT could be an essential factor to improve the stability of operation and the production rates as well (Lee et al., 2004). In our previous study, using acid pretreated hydrolysate feedstock, HRT down to 24h was demonstrated (Kumar et al., 2016c). The lower production performance observed at HRT 24h in the suspended cell system was successfully solved by this immobilized system. The prepared immobilized cells showed enhanced mechanical stability over the period of nearly 60days. Table 1 provides the summary of the production performance of the CSTR system. Daily production performances are depicted in Fig 2 . During days 34–45 (at steady state conditions), hydrogen content in the produced gas ranged from 55–58%, and CO2 was the rest. BPR and HPR were observed as 1.2 L/L-d and 0.86 L H2/L-d. The peak HPR was observed as 0.9 L H2/L-d at the day 40. Peak HY of 81mL H2/g RS added was observed. The SMP consisted mainly of acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Acetate concentration ranged from 2400 to 3200mg COD/L, whereas butyrate ranged from 4500 to 5400mg COD/L. Ethanol was nearly 3 times lower (840–1250mg COD/L) than the acetate and butyrate. COD balance during the stead-state period revealed that the sugars were converted to H2 (20%) and SMP (72%, Table 2 ). In this study we demonstrated that relatively higher production rate was possible with the acid hydrolysate of DJW and mixed microflora. A previous study (Kongjan et al., 2010) used the wheat straw hydrolysate for the continuous hydrogen fermentation via extreme thermophilic temperature and mixed cultures. The thermophilic temperature for a hydrogen fermentation process usually results in the negative net energy gain (Lin et al., 2012). Daily production performance of the CSTR operated at various HRT has been shown in Fig. 2. In the immobilized acid hydrolysate system, the HRT varied from 48–12h. The results show that immobilized cell system could efficiently enhance the production performances even at low HRT of 16h. As a result, the peak HPR of 0.9 L/L*d was observed, when the HRT was 16h (Fig. 2). Previously, immobilization for the cell retention was efficiently applied for the enhancement of hydrogen production (Wu et al., 2008). Table 2 shows the COD balance of the immobilized CTSR reactor system, the calculations were followed by a previous study (Kongjan et al., 2010). The overall mass balance of nearly 90.3% was achieved by converting all the values to a COD equivalent value. The results show that the COD balance calculated is fairly consistent with the CSTR system, whereas only 9% of the COD is missing and this could be other VFAs in the effluent which were the minor ones in the hydrogen fermentation process. SMP varied with the HRT; however, butyrate was dominant when the hydrogen production peaked at even low HRT operation (Fig 3 ). Generally it is considered that high B/A ratio accelerate the hydrogen production performances, thus directly indicating that higher butyrate production system would be the feasible system for a high rate hydrogen production. Our results also indicate the similar result. The VFA pattern provided in Fig. 3 elucidate that acetate and butyrate were the dominant after 2weeks of operation. However, butyrate was dominated during the 16h HRT, where hydrogen production was highest. Ethanol and propionate were rather stable throughout the operation time. Ethanol formation is an undesired process with regards to hydrogen fermentation. Propionate formation also one of the disadvantage to the lower production of hydrogen as it consumes the produced hydrogen for its formation (Sivagurunathan et al., 2015). As we could see that ethanol was remarkably higher at the higher HRTs, however the dominance of butyrate in lower HRT enhanced the hydrogen production performances (Fig 3). Fig. 4 shows linear correspondence of the acetate, butyrate and the B/A ratio with the hydrogen production performances by means of HPR. It could be seen from the figure that B/A ratio and the acetate to HPR show the non-linear relationship with the r2 values of 0.03 and 0.04, respectively. Interestingly, butyrate indicates a modest degree of linear relationship with r2 values of 0.68 relative to acetate and B/A. This reveals that higher butyrate formation favors the hydrogen turnout, as mentioned in other studies (Kumar et al., 2016c)."
10,Bacterial community composition dynamics,"3.3 Bacterial community composition dynamics Microbial community analysis was performed by PCR-DGGE to get an insight into the microbial ecology influencing the production performances. The DGGE (Fig 5 ) analysis showed mainly 2 distinctive bands as progressive and regressive. The progressive bands were the dominant and enriched during the operation time and dominant at the 16h HRT. The regressive bands disappeared while lowering the HRT; which might have occurred due to the cell washout. The bands belong to the genus Clostridium (progressive bands, dominant), and were perhaps responsible for the higher hydrogen production (Kumar et al., 2016c). The band patterns observed at the various HRTs of the acid hydrolysate dark fermentation did not vary significantly with the variation of HRT. PCR- DGGE analyses provided the results that indicated Clostridium spp. as the dominant hydrogen producers present in the CSTR system at lower HRTs. The bacterial species belong to the Firmicutes family and the Clostridia genus (Table 3). The table shows that most of the bacteria belong to the Clostridia group. The bacterial species were Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium algidixylanolyticum, Clostridium saccharolyticum, and Clostridium indolis. These organisms were previously reported as the efficient hydrogen producers by various other authors using the similar substrate but in commercial form such as glucose and xylose (Wu et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2015a,b,c). Since PCR-DGGE is a low resolution molecular technique to know the microbial population in the environment, it would mostly provide the results of the dominant species only. Thus, high-throughput sequencing in association with FISH or cloning techniques should be employed to know the real microbial insights of the bioreactor environment. A literature review of the acid hydrolysates of hydrogen fermentation has been tabulated in Table 4 . It could be seen that many reports are based on the batch reactors and very few reports have been conducted in continuous systems. Among all studies, our reported values are lying above the average due to the efficient immobilized system operation at lower HRT of 16h. This study opens a new window for the development of high rate hydrogen fermentation from the de-oiled jatropha waste acid hydrolysate and lead a sustainable hydrogen production."
11,Conclusions,"This study has demonstrated the continuous hydrogen fermentation of acid pretreated hydrolysate of de-oiled jatropha waste. Results indicated that peak HPR and HY were attained at 16h HRT which was determined to be the optimal. The soluble metabolic product (SMP) consisted mainly of acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Acetate concentration ranged from 2400–3200mg COD/L, whereas butyrate ranged from 4500–5400mg COD/L. Ethanol was nearly 3 times lower (840–1250mg COD/L) than the acetate and butyrate."
