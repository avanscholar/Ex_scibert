0,Introduction,"Construction of hierarchical nanostrcutures has been found to be effective to enhance the physical and chemical properties of the functional materials [1]. At present, this method is widely used in fuel cells [2], photocatalysis [3] and gas sensors [4], etc. In the field of gas sensors, sensing materials with hierarchical nanostructures is difficult to aggregate, providing well-aligned porous structures to accomplish high response and fast response speed when detecting target gas [4]. For this reason, it is possible for gas sensor to exhibit high sensing performance by micro-nanostructure design. A variety of hierarchical nanostructures have been reported before, such as nanoleaf [5], nanosphere [6], nanoflower [7], etc. While, novel nanostructures are still desired to show more remarkable performances when detecting gases. Gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) play a significant role in the detection of toxic gases attributed to the low cost, small size, high sensitivity and easy preparation. Up to now, binary oxide semiconductors have always been the focus of research. Numerous reports introduced the investigations on SnO2 [8–9], ZnO [10–11], WO3 [12–13], In2O3 [14–15], NiO [16–17] and CuO [18–19]. However, there is less research on ternary oxide semiconductors. Recently, the ternary oxide semiconductors attract growing attention due to their potential application in the field of gas sensors. Xu et al. synthesized Zn2SnO4 microspheres to detect H2S, Li et al. synthesized ZnO/ZnCo2O4 hierarchical structures for TEA detection [20–21]. Lupan et al. fabricated enhanced hydrogen gas sensors using ZnxCu1-xOy nanocrystals as sensing material [22]. It is found that most of the investigations about ternary oxide semiconductors are spinel structure and inverse spinel structure. There is less research on other types of ternary oxides. Exploring novel new ternary oxide semiconductor materials has important scientific and practical significance for designing high-performance gas sensors. House painting, automobile exhaust, petroleum production, and many other human activities (straw burning, cooking, etc.) emitted large amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indoors and outdoors [23]. The VOCs usually include alcohols, ketones, benzenes, etc. Excessive inhalation of the VOCs could cause headache, blindness, or other long-term effect on human health (eg: cancer) [24–27]. The VOCs monitoring is of great significance for safeguarding human health and preventing environmental pollution. Many researchers devoted themselves to the design of gas sensors for the detection of VOCs, such as ethanol gas sensor [28–29], acetone gas sensor [30–31], formaldehyde gas sensor [32–33], toluene gas sensor [34–35]. Most of the investigations focused on the detection of one target gas, but some methods were also proposed to detect two gases. For instance, Lee et al. tried to detect xylene and toluene by adjusting the operating temperature of the sensor based on Nb-doped NiO hollow spheres [36], Kim et al. realized toluene and benzene detection by loading Pt and Pd nanoparticles on ZnO nanowires [37], Lupan et al. changed the sensing properties from the ethanol vapour (pure copper oxide) to hydrogen gas (zinc-doped copper oxide) by doping with Zn in copper oxide[22]. Although the detection of two gases can be achieved, modification of the sensing material or adjusting of operating temperature is still required. However, there is almost no literature about gas sensors for detection of some target gases with certain characteristics. In this paper, one-pot solvothermal method and subsequent annealing treatment are employed to synthesize non-stoichiometric ratio indium tungsten oxide with sea cucumber-like nanostructure. To the best of our knowledge, this special nanostructure has not been synthesized as sensing material before. The sea cucumber-like nanostructures-based gas sensor shows remarkable sensing performance to alcohols, especially to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol and n-hexanol. This is the first time that indium tungsten oxide is found to be sensitive to straight-chain alcohols with -OH function group at the end of the chain. The possible mechanism for this sensing behavior is proposed here. High response and fast response-recovery characteristic prove this hierarchical nanostructure is a kind of promising sensing material for gas sensor."
1,Experiment section,
2,Synthesis of sensing material,"2.1 Synthesis of sensing material All the stirring operations were accomplished by a magnetic stirrer under room temperature. In the typical synthesis, 10 ml of deionized water and 15 ml of ethanol were mixed by stirring with 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 1.5 mmol Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved into the mixed solution, the solution became clear after stirring with 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. Then, 1.5 mmol In(NO3)3·4.5H2O was added into this clear solution, the solution turned white almost simultaneously. After stirring with 1000 rpm for another 10 minutes, the above turbid fluid was transformed into the lining of Teflon-lined autoclave. The lining is made of polytetrafluoroethylene with volume of 45 ml. Tighten the lid of the autoclave with a wrench to guarantee the airtight of the lining. The autoclave was then put into an oven which was set to 200 °C for 24 h. When the autoclave cooled down to room temperature, open the autoclave to remove the lining. Supernatant in the lining was discarded and white precipitates deposited at the bottom were collected. Then, the collected precipitates were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tube filled with 40 ml deionized water. The centrifuge tube was put into a centrifuge which was set to10000 rpm for 10 minutes. Followed by ethanol after deionized water. After being washed 7 times in total, the precipitates were poured out into a petri dish and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the dried precipitates were heated at 500 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C/min to get the sensing material."
3,Material characterization,"2.2 Material characterization X-ray power diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka1 radiation (l ¼ 1.54056 A) in the range of 20 ˚-70 ˚. The morphology and nanostructure of the material was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7500 F, operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operated at 200 kV. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements were also carried out using a NETZSCH STA 449F3 simultaneous thermogravimetric analyzer under air atmosphere in the temperature range from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C / min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
4,Fabrication and measurement of sensor,"2.3 Fabrication and measurement of sensor The synthesized indium tungsten oxide powders were used as sensing material to fabricate a sensor. 20 mg of the sensing material was mixed with two drops of deionized water to form a homogeneous paste. The paste was coated onto the surface of an alumina tube with a small brush. Two gold electrodes were installed on the alumina tube, each gold electrode connected with two Pt wires. The alumina tube was coated with the small brush for several times until the gold electrodes were not visible. Then, the alumina tube was put under infrared light for 10 min. Then, the alumina tube was sintered at 300 ℃ for 2 h in a muffle furnace to evaporate the water and impurities introduced in the sensing material during the coating process. Finally, the alumina tube was soldered to the pedestal by electric welding, a Ni–Cr alloy coil inserted in the internal of the tube to provide operating temperature. In this paper, the response of the sensor is defined as S = Ra/Rg, Ra and Rg represent the resistances of the sensor in air and target gas. The response time and recovery time represent the time of the sensor takes to achieve 90% of the total resistance change. The testing schematic diagram is given in Fig. S1. The detailed testing process was described in previous work [38]."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterizations of indium tungsten oxide,"3.1 Characterizations of indium tungsten oxide XRD patterns of the sample are displayed in the Supporting Information (Fig. S2). XPS characterization was performed in order to figure out the element and composition of the sample, the results are displayed in Fig. 1 . In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 XPS peaks are found located at binding energies of 445 and 452.65 eV (Fig. 1 (a)), excluding the existence of metallic indium located at 443.6 eV [39]. Compared with the reported literature, the indium element contained in the sample is mainly In 3+ [40]. W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 appears at 36.4 and 38.4 eV (Fig. 1(b)), respectively, representing the valence state for tungsten is W6+ [41]. The O 1s peak is decomposed into three fitted peaks in Fig. 1 (c), which is attributed to the lattice oxygen species (Ol), oxygen ions in oxygen deficient regions (Ov), and chemisorbed oxygen species (Oc) (O2 −, O− and OH− etc) from lower binding energy to higher binding [42]. The relative percentage of O species is given in Fig. 1(d1). The content of Ol, Ov and Oc is 50.5%, 34.2%, 15.3%, respectively. As reported, the surface defects has ability to attract adsorbed oxygen to enhance the gas sensing performance [43]. The high Ov content here plays as activate centers for the adsorption of oxygen, inducing high gas response. As the atom content listed in Fig. 1(d2), the molar ratio of In, W, O is 1: 1.27: 6.69. Strong signal peaks of indium, tungsten, oxide elements are also observed by EDX characterization in Fig. S3(a). The elements distribution of Fig. S3(b) is shown in Fig. S3(c)-(e). The molar ratio of In, W, O is 1(±0.32): 1.07(±0.18): 4.96(±0.63) by the EDX results, which is consistent with the XPS results. The morphologies and nanostructures of the samples obtained at different reaction time were observed by FESEM. Initially, the sample contained numerous agglomerated nanoparticles can be observed with diameter of 30 - 40 nm when the reaction time was only 1 h (Fig. 2 (a)). As the reaction time increased to 3 h, some nanoellipsoids began to appear as marked in Fig. 2(b). Prolonging the reaction time to 6 h could result in the formation of numerous nanoellipsoids with ∼800 nm in long axis and ∼270 nm in short axis, the agglomerated nanoparticles disappeared. It could be observed that some nanothorns vertically distributed on the surface of the main nanoellipsoid, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The size of the nanoellipsoids remained unchanged as the reaction time was extended to 24 h, but both the number and the size of the nanorods increased respectively. All the nanoparticles in the initial stage developed into fully sea-cucumber like nanostructures after 24 h solvothermal reaction (Fig. 2(d)). The schematic representation of the morphology evolution in combination with SEM results is given in Fig. 2(e). The formation mechanism could be concluded to a three-step development procedure. Step 1: nucleation process. In this stage, a great number of nanoparticles with tens of nanometers formed which were not stable due to the high surface energy. These nanoparticles had tendency to further aggregate as intermediates. Step 2: aggregation to primary nanostructures. The neighboring nanoparticle intermediates aggregated to nanoellipsoids via a self-assemble process in order to reduce the surface energy. In this stage, primary nanoellipsoids with coarse surface were formed, which provided support for the secondary crystal growth. Step 3: secondary-nanostructures growth. The reagents concentration and volume ratio of alcohol to deionized water were key factors that determined the secondary-nanostructures growth in this experiment. As the previous research reported [44], only nanoellipsoids could be synthesized when having low reactants concentration with deionized water as solvent. However, some nanothorns began to grow on the surface of the primary nanoellipsoid-like nanostructures when the reactant concentration was high enough with adjusting the solvent ratio in this experiment. As the high chemical potential of the system promoted the acceleration of the nucleation and resulted in the secondary growth. During this stage, the nanothorns gradually formed a vertical distribution on the coarse surface through an oriented attachment. As a result, fully sea-cucumber like nanostructures formed at last through the nucleation process, aggregation to primary nanostructures process and secondary-nanostructures growth process. The TEM images of the samples annealed at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 2(f), indicating high yield of the sea cucumber nanostructures. The SAED pattern of the nanothorn marked in Fig. 2(g) is given in Fig. 2(h), confirming the nanothorn is single crystalline in nature. The EDX elemental scanning images of the sea cucumber nanostructure are presented in Fig. 2(i)-(l), the different colors represent In, W, and O elements. The signal of In is weaker than W and O, further revealing that the content of In is lower than W and O, which has been proved by XPS result. Annealing process was performed to remove moister and organics adsorbed on the surface of the sample to stabilize the properties of the sensing materials. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was executed from 30 °C to 800 °C with a rate of 10 ℃/min to choose the suitable annealing temperature. According to the TG curve in Fig. 3 , the first weight loose is about 0.8% from 30-170 °C which could be attributed to the removing of physisorbed water on the surface of the sample. Then the weight of the sample gradually decreases about 3% as further increasing the annealing temperature from 170-500 °C. However, there is no phase transition by analyzing the XRD results, thus, we assume the pyrolysis of the organics adsorbed on the surface of the sample might be the reason for this part of weight loose. Then, there is only slight fluctuations in weight above 500 °C. Based on the thermal behavior of the sample according to the TG curve, the products were annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C respectively. The morphologies of the samples obtained after solvothermal reaction as well as annealing at 500 °C and 600 °C were observed under the same magnification and presented in Fig. 3. Before annealing, we could observe the irregular distribution of the nanothorns on the pretty rough surface. There was no obvious change on the morphology under the treatment of 500 °C except the surface of the nanoellipsoid became a little smoother. However, the morphology was destroyed when annealed at 600 °C: significant shrinkage of the size and disappearance of the nanothorns. The nanothorns collapsed to nanoparticles caused by the excessive annealing temperature. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm plots are given in Fig. 4 , the BET surface area of the samples annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C is calculated to be 10.73 and 9.72 m2 g-1 respectively. Annealing at 600 °C causes a slight decrease in BET surface area, which is not conducive to sensitivity improvement. By comparison, 500 °C is more suitable than 600 °C for keeping the morphology unchanged to exhibit superior sensing performance."
7,Gas sensing properties,"3.2 Gas sensing properties After annealing at 500 °C, the sea-cucumber nanostructures-based gas sensor was fabricated to investigate the sensing performance. The testing environment was under a relative humidity of 30-50 % at 23-25 °C. Responses of the sensor to 200 ppm methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol were tested at different operating temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 400 °C, the results are given in Fig. 5 (a). According to the curves, the responses increase from 300 °C to 325 °C and reach the maximum at 325 °C for all the tested gases. The responses trend to decrease gradually with increasing the operating temperature from 325 °C to 400 °C. Thus, 325 °C is regarded as the optimal operating temperature for the sea-cucumber nanostructures-based gas sensor to detect methanol, ethanol, etc. There is a widely accepted explanation for the “increase first and decrease later” response [45]. The current sensitive mechanism used to explain oxide semiconductors is the change of the resistance caused by the reaction of gas molecules on the surface of the material [4]. The moderate high operating temperature provides more energy, resulting in the stronger reaction happened on the surface of the material. While, the desorption speed of the gas is too fast to complete the reaction when the operating temperature is too high [46–48]. Thus, the balance between adsorption and desorption establishes at the optimal operating temperature and induces the highest response. Another interesting phenomenon can be observed from the curves is the relationship between gas response and the carbon atom numbers (CAN) of the alcohols. The methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol belongs to straight chain alcohol gas molecules with various CAN ranging from 1 to 6. The responses to the above gases at 325 °C with concentration of 200 ppm are obtained from Fig. 5(a) and concluded in Fig. 5(b), which shows a volcano-shaped curve. The gas response is 11.40 when the carbon number is 1. As increasing the CAN from 2 to 4, the response is 20.46, 22.34, 23.65, respectively. Then, the gas response decreases with increasing the CAN from 5 to 6. Gas response to ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol are around 22 as marked by the red circle in Fig. 5(b). To discuss the effect of -OH position on the gas response, sensing performance to isopropanol (CH3CHOHCH3) was studied. As a result, the gas response to 200 ppm of isopropanol is only 4 at 325 °C. As is known, -OH is an electron-withdrawing group, -CH3 is an electron-donating group. The CH3CHOHCH3 has two -CH3 groups, but the CH3CH2CH2OH has only one -CH3 group. More -CH3 groups induce stronger C-OH bond energy. Based on this theory, it is harder to break the C-OH bond in CH3CHOHCH3. As a result, the sensor has higher response to CH3CH2CH2OH compared with CH3CHOHCH3. With increasing the CAN, longer distance between -OH and -CH3 weaken the C-OH bond energy. Therefore, the gas response increases with increasing the CAN. Therefore, the CAN is a dominant parameter that affects the response. While, the viscosity of the gas molecule participates in the impact on the gas response with further increasing the CAN. At 20 °C, the liquid viscosity of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol is 0.58, 1.074, 2.256, 2.95, 3.31, 5.2 (mPa·s) respectively. Obviously, the liquid viscosity increases with increasing the CAN. The n-hexanol possesses the maximum viscosity among them. There are enough reasons to speculate that the viscosities of the corresponding gas molecules have the similar trends: increase with increasing the CAN. Therefore, the gas response of the sensor to n-hexanol drops sharply as observed from Fig. 5(b). From the above analysis results, it is considered that the gas response of the sensor is sensitive to the CAN and the viscosity of the gas molecule. Represent real-time response curves of the sensor to methanol with concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 200 ppm are shown in Fig. S4. For all the target gases, the corresponding function relationship between gas response and concentration is given in Fig. 6 , the inset in Fig. 6 is the enlarge image of the responses at low gas concentration from 1 ppm to 10 ppm. From the inset, it is observed that the gas responses to n-pentanol and n-hexanol are lower than to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol when the gas concentration is 1 ppm. We deduce that only small amount of gases could adsorb onto the surface of the material due to high gas viscosity at low concentration, inducing low gas responses. The gas response of the sensor is more sensitive to the CAN as the concentration increases. Over a wide range of concentrations, the sensor exhibits higher gas responses to ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol than to methanol and n-hexanol. To get the detailed information of the sensing characteristics, real-time resistance curves of the sensor to 200 ppm methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol are presented in Fig. 7 . The testing environment was under a relative humidity of 30-50 % at 23-25 °C. For methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, the sensor shows rapid response characteristic. The recovery speed is not comparable to the response speed, but the resistance can still recover to its original value. For n-pentanol and n-hexanol (blue and purple curves), the sensor needs more time to complete the recovery process, in addition, it is harder to recover to the initial resistance value. We deduce that the recovery process is affected by the viscosity of gas molecule. High viscosity prevents the desorption of the target gas during the recovery process, consequently, the recovery process of the senor for detecting n-hexanol is the hardest compared with other gases. The resistance decreases immediately once exposed to alcohols, the change of the resistance is almost instantaneous. According to the definition, the response time and recovery time for methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol are 2 s/16 s, 2 s/19 s, 2 s/33 s, 2 s/36 s, 2 s/66 s, 17 s/103 s. The sensor exhibits fast detection to alcohols. However, the recovery time becomes longer as the CAN increases. We deduce that the increasing gas viscosity might be the dominant factor that limits he diffusion of the target gas during the recovery process. Gas sensor based on sea cucumber-like nanostructures realize the fast detection to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, which is important for the fabrication of advanced gas sensors. In practical application, the impact of humidity on sensing performance cannot be neglected. Hence, the responses to various gases with 200 ppm concentration under 25%, 50%, 75% and 95% relative humidity were measured at the optimal operating temperature and shown in Fig. 8 (a). From 25 RH% to 50 RH%, the gas responses change slightly. It is considered that the operating temperature of 325 °C could evaporate the water molecules on the material surface. The impact of humidity could be ignored below 50 RH%. However, there is a clear downward trend in gas responses beyond 50 RH%. The change of baseline resistance is responsible to the gas response under the high humidity environment. The variation of baseline resistance with relative humidity is shown in Fig. 8(b). The resistance value decreases with the increase of the relative humidity, this could be explained by the reaction on the material surface between pre-adsorbed O− and water [49–51]: H2O + O- = 2OH + e-. Terminal hydroxyl groups formed and one electron released to the conduction band by this reaction. The consumption of O− reduced the available O− that can participate in the reaction with target gas. Consequently, the response of the sensor is compromised over 50 RH%. Stability measurement was executed during 20 days, the testing environment was under a relative humidity of 30-50 % at 23-25 °C. The result is shown in Fig. 8(c). The response to methanol maintained around 11. Curve drift appears for the other 5 gases, but the responses are still around 22 for ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol as marked by the pink dotted line. Except the detection of alcohols, responses towards various VOCs including acetaldehyde, acetic acid, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, benzyl alcohol were investigated with 200 ppm concentration for testing the selectivity. The testing environment was under a relative humidity of 30-50 % at 23-25 °C. These gases involved the molecules with functional groups of C = O (acetaldehyde), O = C-OH (acetic acid), isomer of n-propanol (isopropanol), two -OH groups (ethylene glycol), alcohols with benzene ring (benzyl alcohol). The graph of the selectivity results is listed in Fig. 8(d). We speculate that for alcohols detection, the gas response is greatly affected by the -OH number and the -OH position in the molecular chain. For instance, the response to CH3CH2OH is 20.5, which is 10 times higher than the response to CH2OHCH2OH (response = 2.1). This shows that the -OH number interferes the response of the sensor. Another example, the response of the sensor to CH3CH2CH2OH is 22,3, which is 5 times higher than the response to CH3CHOHCH3 (response = 4.2). This shows that the -OH position interferes the response of the sensor. Besides -OH, the sensor is also found to be sensitive to the gases with C = O functional group, such as acetone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde. While, the sensor shows lowest response to acetic acid, which possesses O = C-OH functional group. Based on these results, we speculate that when detecting VOCs, the type of functional group is critical. The sensitivities of the sensor to functional groups are: -OH > C = O > O = C-OH. The selectivity is affected by the combination of functional group types, functional group number, functional group positions, and molecular chain styles (eg: even with one -OH, the response to benzyl alcohol is only 2). The sensing material is only sensitive to the straight-chain molecules with one -OH functional group at the end of the chain. The selectivity of the sensor demonstrates that the sea cucumber sensing material is especially sensitive and selective to certain kind of alcohols. Literatures about gas sensors based on various materials are listed in Table1 [52–59]. The survey shows that there is almost no literature reports the sensing performance to n-pentanol and n-hexanol. Compared with the reported literatures, the sensor fabricated here exhibit superior sensing performance, which has potential application in alcohols detection area."
8,Gas sensing mechanism,"3.3 Gas sensing mechanism The most widely accepted gas sensing mechanism for n-type oxide semiconductor materials is the resistance change caused by the reaction between adsorbed oxygen and the target gas on the surface of sensing material [60–61]. According to the sensing behavior of the sea-cucumber nanostructures (resistance decreases when exposed to reducing gas), it is believed that the nanostructures belong to n-type sensing material. The sensing process conforms to the n-type semiconductor sensitive mechanism. In ambient air, the atmospheric oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the material and captured electrons from the conduction band of the material. The transportation of electrons from sensing material to oxygen induced surface negative charge layer formed and determined an upwards band bending. The electron depletion layer contributed to the creation of potential barrier between the adjacent nanograins, resulting the increasing of electrical resistance. The schematic diagram of this process is presented in Fig. 9 (a). The ionization process has been investigated by many literatures before [62–64]: (1) O2 (g) → O2 (ads) (2) O2 (ads)+ e- → O2- (ads) (T < 150 °C) (3) O2- (ads)+ e- → 2O- (ads) (150 °C < T < 400 °C) (4) O2- (ads)+ e- → 2O2- (ads) (T > 400 °C) In Fig. 9(a), we take detecting ethanol as an example. When the ethanol gases are introduced in, the gas molecules adsorb on the surface of the material to react with the adsorbed oxygen species. CO2 and H2O are released into the air atmosphere as the products of the reaction. The thickness of the depletion layer decreases owing to the removal of the electrons from the oxygen ion to the conduction band. The concentration of the electrons increases and the height of the potential decreases, resulting the decrease of the sensor resistance [64]. According to the previous literatures, the reactions happen between adsorbed oxygen and methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol and generate CO2 and H2O [65–72]. As no literature has reported the detection of n-pentanol and n-hexanol, it is speculated that reactions for n-pentanol and n-hexanol are similar with that of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. The reaction processes are described from Eq. 5 to Eq. 10 [65–72], (5) CH3OH+ 3O−→ CO2 +2H2O +3e- (6) CH3CH2OH+ 6O−→ 2CO2 + 3H2O +6e- (7) CH3(CH2)2OH+ 9O−→ 3CO2 + 4H2O +9e- (8) CH3(CH2)3OH+ 12O−→ 4CO2 + 5H2O +12e- (9) CH3(CH2)4OH+ 15O−→ 5CO2 + 6H2O +15e- (10) CH3(CH2)5OH+ 18O−→ 6CO2 + 7H2O +18e- The excellent sensing performance of the gas sensor to alcohols could be attributed to the following reasons. I: the special nanostructures of the sensing material. The nanothorns distributed on the nanoellipsoids provide more available sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules (Fig. 9(b)). As a result, the utilization of sensing body increases and more effective reactions take place on the material surface. As reported by Lee [4], the aggregation of nanoparticles destroys the porous structure and hampers the diffusion of analyte gas toward the inner part of the secondary particles. The TEM result shown in Fig. 2(F) proves that the sea-cucumber nanostructures loosely connect with each other owing to the existence of the nanothorns, providing evidence for the advantage of the nanothorns: tight packing can be avoided compared with the solid structures. This advantage leads to more effective gas diffusions and thus higher response of the sensor. II: chemical components of the material. As reported in many literatures [73–74], the sensing materials with non-stoichiometric ratio always exhibit high response. For ternary semiconductor, the presence of two cations with different atomic radii makes the bond energies weaker compared with binary semiconductor, consequently, it is easier to attract electrons from conduction band. More oxygen ions are formed to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. III. The CAN and viscosity of the target gas. As discussed above, the sensor is mainly sensitive to certain kind of alcohols. The CAN and viscosity of the target gas affect the response of the sensor together. While, it is still a challenge to figure out the reason that the sensing material is more sensitive to -OH functional group than to others (C = O, COOH, etc.)."
9,Conclusions,"In this paper, novel sea cucumber-like nanostructures were successfully synthesized for the first time by one-step solvothermal method. The reagents concentration and volume ratio of alcohols to deionized were the key factors to determine the growth of nanothorns onto the nanoellipsoid. The sensor based on the sea cucumber-like nanostructures showed excellent sensing performance to methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, especially to ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol. It was firstly found the sensor exhibited superior sensing characteristics to straight-chain gas molecules with -OH functional group at the end of the chain. In other words, the sensor realized the detection of gases with common characteristics, which was never reported elsewhere as far as we know. It was speculated the special nanostructure, the chemical components of the material, the CAN and viscosity of the target gas were responsible to the high sensing performance to alcohols. The short response time (2 s, 2 s, 2 s, 2 s, 2 s and 17 s) indicated the sensor were capable of fast detection. All the investigations in this paper provided potential applications in the fast detection of alcohols. Moreover, it inspired the research on gas sensors for a certain type of gas with specific functional group."
