0,Introduction,"Organic chromophores which can change their brightness or emission spectra upon a variety of factors have recently drawn great attention because of their simplicity, low-cost of production and a simple way of recycling [1–5]. These kinds of molecules have already found applications in biological imaging [6–9], sensing of toxic metal ions [10–13], special organic ions [14–17] or environmental inspection [18,19]. There are several mechanisms responsible for highly precise detection of specific ions, water or polarity by fluorescent sensors. One of the most investigated is solvatochromism, which describes the influence of the molecule's surroundings on its absorption, as well as emission spectra. Significant solvatochromism of emission was already encountered in metal complexes [20,21], polymers [22–24], metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [25–27], molecules which exhibit excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) [28], as well as push-pull molecules [29–31]. The last group seems to be especially worth investigating due to their pronounced optoelectronic properties. These π-conjugated systems contain an electron-donating group (D) covalently bonded with electron-withdrawing moiety (A). In such D-π-A systems, due to the donor-acceptor interactions, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) can be observed, which is a phenomenon responsible for the polarization of the molecules. Push-pull organic chromophores are known for a low value of a dipole moment in the ground state, which grows significantly upon electronic excitation, hence a strong bathochromic shift of emission spectra can be visible in solvents with increasing polarity [28]. Small manipulations within donor and acceptor moieties can thoroughly change the photophysical properties. Well investigated examples are derivatives of Fluoroprobe [32], Prodan [9,33,34], BODIPY [35–37] or dimethylaminophthalimide (DMAP) [8,38,39]. Solvatochromic probes might be useful for industry application such as estimation of polarity, monitoring of polymerization process [40] as well as detection of hydrogen bonds [41]. An equally significant aspect of detection properties arises from well-known aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ), where even highly conjugated push-pull chromophores exhibit weak emission in powder or aggregated state. Usually, in aggregates the stacking of dye molecules changes, so the interplanar distance is emphatically decreased, resulting in a strong π-π interactions between neighboring molecules. This leads to the emission quenching, especially when two π-conjugated systems are overlapping, creating non-emissive excimer [42,43]. On the other hand, polar protic solvents (i.e. methanol, ethanol, water) are known for significantly decreasing the emission of solvatochromic dyes due to the creation of H-aggregates, high polarity and a hydrogen-bonding effect [44]. Weakened fluorescence and ACQ are considered as unwelcome processes, although highly-sensitive detectors of water in organic solvents are desired for many industrial applications, such as the manufacture of dry solvents or petroleum, where water is considered as a dangerous impurity [45]. Furthermore, the fluoroprobes for highly precise detection of poisonous cyanide anions have been investigated in recent years. Even trace amounts of cyanide are considered deadly for plants, animals and especially humans. The mechanism responsible for the death of the cell is the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase, which directly leads to the inability to produce ATP, respiratory arrest and death. Hence, the development of efficient and sensitive methods of detection is greatly needed. Nowadays most of the cyanide detection is performed through mass spectrometry, although this method needs a specific and expensive machine. Recently some sensors showing the ability to ‘turn on’ or ‘turn off’ the fluorescence upon addition of CN− ions have been reported [46–50]. Moreover, it has been proved that electron-withdrawing groups such as dicyanovinyl [51–53] or carbonyl [54,55] have the ability to interact with cyanide anions which visibly change the position of absorption and emission spectra. We report herein on the synthesis of thiophene derivatives (ThD), with covalently connected benzothiophene as a donor part and various combinations of cyano and nitro groups as acceptor moieties, which are known as one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups used in organic chemistry (CN: σp = 0.66 and NO2: σp = 0.78) [3]. We chose eight solvents differing in dielectric constant and measured the changes in emission spectra of investigated compounds. Afterwards, we established that Stokes shifts are linearly dependent on empirical polarity parameter ET (30), as well as orientation polarizability (Δf) in case of all investigated compounds. Moreover, chosen ThDs display strong quenching of luminescence upon addition of water, along with a variety of alcohols, as well as sensitivity to the addition of specific ions (CN− and OH−). These properties put the presented compounds as great candidates for sensor devices."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Synthesis,"2.1 Synthesis Chemical structures of investigated compounds are presented in Scheme 1 . Solvents and commercially available substrates were used without further purification. In the case of compounds 1 and 2 we used typical Horner-Wittig reaction route, whereas for compound 3 classic condensation was applied (see Scheme S1). The chemical structures were confirmed with common spectroscopic methods: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra measurements were conducted on Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer with chemical shifts expressed in ppm (parts per million), infrared (IR) spectra were measured on Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer in range of 400–4000 cm−1, Jeol JMS 700 with isobutane as a matrix, using electron ionization (EI) method, was used for high-resolution mass spectrometry."
3,Photophysical measurements,"2.2 Photophysical measurements Photophysical properties were measured for the same solutions with concentration equal to 10 μM of ThDs in chosen solvents. Measurements were conducted at room temperature, using quartz cuvettes and Shimadzu UV 1800 Spectrometer to obtain absorption spectra and Shimadzu RF-6000 Spectrofluorometer for emission spectra. For the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) we used a relative method, with a solution of Coumarin 153 in ethanol as a reference (Φ = 58%) [56]."
4,Results and discussion,
5,Solvatochromism,"3.1 Solvatochromism It is well known that push-pull chromophores can exhibit significant change of emission spectra in solvents with different polarity. Due to the electron-donating and electron-accepting groups present in compounds 1–3, they represent a typical D-π-A structure. Solvatochromic behavior of this type of molecules can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor moiety, which enhance dipole-dipole interaction between the dye and the solvent molecules and also, decrease the excited state energy as a result of the solvent relaxation. Compounds 1–3 exhibit slightly red-shifted absorption spectra (See Figs. S1a–c) although, these shifts are not completely linear. Usually absorption spectra is less responsive to the solvent polarity, due to the very short time in which absorption occurs. On the other hand, chromophores in the excited state are exposed to the environment of the relaxed solvent. Molecules with a large dipole moment in the excited state can interact with polar solvent molecules, what leads to the reduction of the excited state's energy [57]. Investigated compounds are highly sensitive to the solvent polarity and exhibit profound change of emission spectra maximum in variety of solvents-from apolar n-hexane to highly polar DMSO (See Fig. 1 ). In all compounds we observed remarkable bathochromic shift from green to red (2) or from blue to red (1, 3), which covers whole visible spectrum. The shift of emission's maximum between the solution in hexane and DMSO were estimated to Δλ = 197 nm, Δλ = 182 nm and Δλ = 203 nm for 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, the spectra recorded in more polar solvents are broader than the well-defined spectra in apolar solvents, what points to the extensive ICT occurring within polar environment. In Table 1 we summarized the solvatochromic response of presented compounds in eight different solvents. As mentioned before, the solvatochromism of absorption is insignificant in comparison to the bathochromic shift of the emission spectra. Shift of the emission spectrum caused by the solvent's relaxation effect can be described by the factor of the orientation polarizability (Δf). In order to estimate the solvents involvement in the emission aspect, we use the Lippert-Mataga method (1): (1) Δ ν = 2 h c ( μ E − μ G ) 2 a 3 Δ f (2) Δ f = ε − 1 2 ε + 1 − n 2 − 1 2 n 2 + 1 where Δν is the Stokes shift between the absorption and emission maximum (cm−1), h is Plank's constant, c is the speed of light, and a is the radius of the molecule cavity, μE and μG are the dipolar moments in the excited and ground states. Above mentioned correlation should be linear if solvatochromic response is purely the effect of dipolar interaction between solvent and dyes molecules in the excited state. As presented in Fig. 2 a, only for the compound 2 this relation is well fitted with linear approximation. This indicates that in case of compounds 1 and 3 other effects contributes to the visible solvatochromism of emission. In order to better understand solvatochromism caused in these molecules, we used the Reichardt–Dimroth equation (3), which takes in consideration polarity as well as acidity, but is independent of solvent's polarizability [31]. (3) E T ( 30 ) = 28591 λ m a x , R D ET (30) (kcal/mol) parameter is defined as molar electronic transition energy and can be calculated based on the wavelength of intramolecular charge-transfer π-π* absorption band of pyridinium-Nphenolate betaine dye (RD). It can be observed that for compounds 1 and 3 we achieved better linear correlation, whereas for compound 2 this approximation worsened (see Fig. 2b). That indicates clear dipole-dipole interactions between dye and solvent are responsible for solvatochromism in case of compounds 2, when in fact for compounds 1 and 3 beside solvents polarity, other effects should be considered i.e. hydrogen bonding or probe-probe interactions. The slope of the curve in Fig. 2 grows in order from 2 → 3→1. Although, calculated transition dipole moments Δμ, based on the slope of Lippert-Mataga relation, shows a slightly different trend. The highest value, due to the extended π-conjugation length in comparison to 1 and 3, was achieved for compound 2 – Δμ = 13.5 D. In the case of 1 and 3, calculated transition dipole moments were Δμ = 12.3 D and Δμ = 12.2 D respectively, giving us quite similar values due to the similar chemical structure of studied derivatives. In all cases the change of dipole moment indicates profound ICT occurring in all studied molecules. Fluorophores quantum yield (QY) was calculated in comparison to the Coumarin 153 dye in ethanol solution (Φ = 58%). The highest values were achieved for 1 and the lowest for 3. High fluorescence quantum yield in apolar solvents shown by compound 2, suggests in this case there is no quenching caused by intersystem crossing (ISC). El Sayed's rule indicates that ISC or internal conversion (IC) deactivate the fluorescence process, promoting the radiationless conversion [59]. This phenomenon can be clearly observed in 1, where QY is clearly lower in apolar solvents. On the other hand 1–3 show significant decrease of QY in highly polar solvents due to the energy gap rule [59]. It is a well-known pattern for compounds which exhibit strong separation of the charge in the excited state. Gradually low QY exhibited by 3 mighty be easily explained by its structure. Close proximation of cyano group near double bond disturbs the planarity of the compound, hence more energy in the excited state is released through torsion, which is a radiationless process [60]."
6,Detection of water and alcohols,"3.2 Detection of water and alcohols Presented compounds turned out to be unsolvable in protic solvents. Therefore we investigated their behavior in aprotic water-miscible solvent like THF upon addition of water and variety of alcohols. We monitored changes in the intensity of emission for 10 μM solutions of investigated compounds, caused by addition of 0–80% of water, methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. All compounds were more sensitive to the addition of water than alcohols and this sensitivity seemed to decrease with decrease of solvents polarity. The lowest detection threshold was observed for isopropanol in every case (See Figs. S4–S6). We observed dramatic decays of emission in case of compounds 1 and 3, even upon addition of 1% of water, which is a very polar solvent (ET(30) = 63.1 kcal/mol). On Fig. 3 we present exemplary results for compound 1. Moreover, the changes of intensity in the function of water concentration showed very good linear correlation between 0 and 1%, hence the detection limits for compounds 1 and 3 were established to be 0.0033% (59 ppm) and 0.0071% (126 ppm), respectively. In both cases, just after adding 10% of water the luminescence was significantly quenched what can be observed with the naked eye (See Fig. 3d). After that amount the fluorescence intensity decay behaved linearly. For compound 2 the quenching progressed more linearly from the beginning (See Fig. S7b). As expected, we also noticed slight bathochromic shift of around 40 nm in every case. Furthermore, we compared the quenching kinetics caused by addition of different alcohols-methanol (ET(30) = 55.4 kcal/mol), ethanol (ET(30) = 51.9 kcal/mol) and isopropanol (ET(30) = 50.7 kcal/mol) which are slightly less polar than water. The highest sensitivity was shown by compound 1 and the lowest for compound 2. Worth noticing is the fact that sensitivity decreased along the decrease of solvents polarity. In every case quenching of luminescence caused by isopropanol was slower than for more polar alcohols like methanol (See Fig. S7). Investigated compounds are soulible in alcohols less polar than isopropanol, hence the detection measurements were not conducted. As effects responsible for a luminescence quenching we can highlight the aggregation process caused by low solubility and hydrogen bonding (that can occur between the nitro and cyano groups and water molecules) leading to the promotion of non-radiative path of relaxation of the molecules from the excited state. Most chromophores are known to emit strongly in isolated state but when clustered the molecules are in a close proximity, hence the aromatic rings of dyes face extensive π-π intramolecular stacking. Due to this process, the relaxation from the excited to the ground state occurs via the non-radiative way. This phenomena is very common and already known as aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) [43]. On the other hand, molecules possessing strong ICT have emission reduced by protic solvents corresponding to the energy gap rule. Since the n-π* energy state is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, the ICS is promoted and emission occurs through a radiationless transition. Results of this section are summarized in Table 2 ."
7,Detection of ions,"3.3 Detection of ions Besides water and alcohol detection, there is also a growing need for developing precise sensors for specific ions. The studied ThDs compounds seem to be valuable candidates for specific anions detection. Therefore we have monitored changes in emission spectra caused by interactions between compounds 1–3 and variety of ions, such as OH−, Br−, F−, Cl−, I−, NO3 −, CN−, AcO−, SCN−, HSO4 −. Especially cyanide sensors are desired since even traces amount can be deadly for human beings, though large amounts are still used in the industry so the danger of contamination is considerably high. According to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 100–200 mg, although long-time exposure to small doses can also noticeably damaged the organism [61]. Among many methods developed for cyanide detection in recent years, optical sensors distinguish themselves due to their simplicity, quick response and low costs of production. As shown in Fig. 4 a, compound 2 turned out to be especially interesting since there is a significant shift of emission after addition either CN− or OH− ions. On the other hand, we observed no visible changes neither in color nor in emission spectra upon addition of other anions. In the case of compound 1 and 3 (See Fig. S8) we only observed the decrease of emission intensity which might be due to their high sensitivity towards water, visibly no chemical reaction was initiated. Above mentioned results clearly indicate that compound 2 can be considered as a highly precise detector of CN− and OH− ions, which can be attributed to its acceptor moiety. It is well known that nucleophilic ions can interact with the α-position of dicyanovinyl group and create stable anionic specie (See Fig. 5 a) [62]. The presence of the ions such as CN− or OH− initiates the Michael addition to the CC double bond and creates a new C–C bond between the ion and dicyanovinyl group. As a result, the ICT should be disturbed, which affect the optical properties and hence the hypsochromic shift of emission is visible. In order to proof this theory we performed the titration followed by 1H NMR (See Fig. 5b). In the initial state the signal of the proton corresponding to the vinyl group (Ha) was situated at 8.47 ppm. Upon addition of increasing equivalents of CN− ions, we observed the growth of a new signal at 6.34 ppm, whereas the initial peak completely disappeared. Moreover, we observed a small shift of aromatic protons due to the breakage of the intramolecular charge transfer. These changes clearly demonstrate that cyanide anion was attached to the compound 2. Similar behavior was observed upon addition of OH− ions. However in that case the initial peak of the vinyl group (8.47 ppm) shifted to 5.04 ppm and also new peak arose at 9.95 ppm, which corresponds to the OH group (See Fig. S10). To obtain additional prove of above described interaction we conducted High Resolution Mass Spectrometry of the solutions after titration. An expected signals were noticed at 421.0724 and 412.0768, which corresponds to [compound 2 + CN]- and [compound 2 + OH]- respectively (See Fig. S11). As shown in Figs. S9a–b, compound 2 has two visible peaks of absorption, situated at 333 nm and 441 nm. During titration, by both cyanide and hydroxide anions, we can observe merging of these two bands into one absorption band at 380 nm. This indicates that strong ICT got disturbed by the nucleophilic reaction between CN−/OH− and a dicyanovinyl group of 2. In order to better distinguish sensing properties of compound 2, we performed titration experiment and monitor changes in emission spectra. As shown in Figure 5c, 2 has one visible peak at 572 nm, which visibly decrease upon addition of CN− or OH− anions (Fig. S10a), meanwhile there is a new peak at 465 nm growing rapidly. These two peaks are quite well separated on the visible spectrum, hence the change of emission is noticeable even with simple observation. During the changes from orange toward blue emission, we observed quite clear white emission from the titrated solution. This phenomenon could be observed after adding 2.5 eq and 1.75 eq in case of CN− and OH− respectively (See Fig. S12), when both bands of emission are evened. In the case of titration by OH− ions we observed slightly faster and more visible changes in emission spectra. First of all, the change in the intensity of the band at 572 nm is visible just after the addition of 0.2 eq of OH− ions. Furthermore, after adding just 5 eq the intensity of the new peak at 465 nm exceeded the initial peak almost twice. In the case of cyanide ions changes are visible after the addition of at least 0.5 eq. Moreover, the intensity of the new peak at 465 nm does not exceed the initial band. Saturation occurs after adding around 5 eq in both cases. Results of the titration experiments were plotted on the CIE graph (See Fig. 5d), to show very good linear change of color from orange to blue. Based on the intensity of the peak at 465 nm, the detection limits of both CN− and OH− were established to 0.0131 μM and 0.0025 μM respectively (See Fig. S13). In order to exhibit usefulness of abovementioned compound as a fast and easy sensor for the industrial application, we prepared test papers by immersing filter paper (1 cm × 1 cm) in the solution of compound 2 (1 mM in DMSO) for 5 min and drying in the air. As shown in Fig. 6 , the change from orange to blue emission after applying a solution of OH− as well as CN− was immediately visible. Moreover, even diluted solution of poisonous anions can be detected by the naked eye, which proves that this simple in preparation test papers can be used for precise detection of CN− as well as OH− anions in everyday life."
8,Conclusions,"The prepared thiophene derivatives (ThDs) represent typical D-π-A molecules, where ICT plays a significant role on their sensing properties. In addition, by simply changing the electron-withdrawing moiety we can easily manipulate the photophysical response. Investigated molecules containing nitro group in para position turned out to be extremely sensitive to low concentration of water (0.0033%) and alcohols (0.0040%). Results show the decreasing trend of detection ability with the decrease of alcohol's polarity. On the other hand, by using dicyanovinyl group we created a molecule for precise detection of cyanide and hydroxide anions. This phenomenon is quite important for the industrial applications. Thus, we proved that even simple in preparation sensor made of test paper, can detect abovementioned ions in diluted solutions. Moreover, all compounds exhibit strong sensitivity for solvent's polarity with tunable emission from blue to red. These properties make such thiophene derivatives as an attractive alternative for highly-precise sensors."
