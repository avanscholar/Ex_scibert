0,Introduction,"The most common method for lignocellulosic biomass thermochemical conversion into liquid fuels involves gasification, which yields biosyngas (mixture of CO and H2) [1,2]. The produced biosyngas is an important intermediate which can be converted depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions either into hydrocarbons (methane, olefins, long-chain paraffins) or into oxygenates (methanol, dimethyl ether, higher alcohols). The presence of several impurities is a specificity of biosyngas produced from biomass gasification. Biosyngas usually contains several percents of CO2 and methane, while tar, alkali, alkaline-earth metals, nitrogen-containing, and sulphur-containing compounds can be present in ppm concentrations. Among the biosyngas impurities sulphur is one of the most harmful elements for the catalysts which irreversibly contaminates active sites and dramatically reduces the catalyst activity [3]. Sulphur is generally present in biosyngas as H2S with small amounts of COS, methylmerkaptan and dimethyl sulphide [4,5]. Thus, there is a general consensus in the literature that sulphur-containing compounds should be removed from biosyngas for stable process operation [3,6]. Deep desulfurization of biosyngas (to several ppb) is however a very expensive procedure. Design of sulphur-tolerant catalysts could be therefore a solution and is of major interest for converting biosyngas into valuable products. For more than 50 years sulphides of transition metals have been used in the petroleum industry in hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrogenation reactions. Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) exhibits noticeable activity in carbon monoxide hydrogenation [7–9]. Because of its catalytic properties and excellent resistance to sulphur poisoning, molybdenum disulphide could be a potential candidate for valorisation of biosyngas. Moreover, the presence of sulphur in syngas is often even required for the stable catalyst operation [10]. Extremely low sulphur concentration in syngas could lead to sulphur loss in the catalysts and subsequent deactivation. On the non-promoted MoS2 catalysts, syngas is mainly transformed to methane [7,10] which is a relatively inexpensive reaction product. Carbon monoxide hydrogenation involves active sites which are located in the molybdenum sulphide phase. As was recently pointed out by Védrine [11], the structure and properties of the active sites in heterogeneous catalysts are strongly affected by electronic effects. Addition of different promoters may therefore lead to the modification of molybdenum sulphide structure, electronic properties and reactivity of active sites. The selectivity of molybdenum disulphide catalysts can be modified using promotion. Alkali metals are the most used promoters. Previous reports indicate higher selectivity of potassium-modified MoS2-based catalysts to mixed alcohols at high pressures [12]. Most of the publications describe bulk molybdenum sulphide catalysts, while very few reports have addressed the supported systems. The supported catalysts represent several advantages compared to bulk catalyst such as more efficient use of active phase and better chemical, mechanical and thermal stability. In addition, the support can affect chemical and electronic structures of the active sites and thus the catalytic performance of supported catalysts. The potassium-promoted molybdenum sulphide catalysts also exhibit high activity for water–gas shift (WGS) reaction and show significant tolerance to coke deposition [13]. The function of K on one hand seems to reduce hydrogenation ability of alkyl species and hydrocarbon production, and on the other hand can favour alcohol formation [14]. Different potassium precursors have been used [15]. Use of potassium chloride [16] and sulphide may introduce acidity to the catalyst and thus, affect the selectivity. In addition to the catalyst composition, the selectivity of carbon monoxide hydrogenation on molybdenum sulphide catalysts is also affected by the reaction conditions (pressure, temperature, H2/CO ratio). The linear alcohols are produced at 80–90bar, while hydrocarbons are major products at lower pressures. The mechanism for the formation of higher alcohols (C2+OH) is believed to be CO insertion [17]. Olefins serve as an important feedstock for the petrochemical industry because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions [18,19]. In the industry, olefins are typically obtained either by steam cracking of oil fractions or by methanol conversion to olefin (MTO) process. In the steam cracking, the olefins are by-side products and the selectivity to specific olefins is rather low. The MTO technology involves a number of technological steps which reduce the overall conversion efficiency. In addition, the catalyst undergoes noticeable deactivation. As a result, the produced olefins get rather costly. High temperature Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis represents a major interest for synthesis of light olefins [20,21]. In FT synthesis, light olefins are produced directly using carbon monoxide hydrogenation without any intermediate steps. Iron catalysts have shown so far the highest olefin productivity in direct FT synthesis; however they are sensitive to the presence of small amounts of sulphur in syngas. While a significant number of papers have described alcohol synthesis on molybdenum sulphide catalysts which usually occurs at higher reaction pressures (80–90bar), very less information is available about potential use of the MoS2 catalysts for selective olefin synthesis from syngas. The present work addresses design of supported molybdenum sulphide catalysts for synthesis of olefins from syngas. This paper more particularly focuses on the effect of potassium content and catalyst activation on the structure of supported molybdenum sulphide catalysts and their performance in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. At different preparation stages, the catalysts were characterised by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) and temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD). The catalytic performance was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at different CO conversion levels. To enhance olefin production, the catalytic experiments were conducted at relatively low total pressure (20bar) compared to the conditions used for alcohol synthesis."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The γ-Al2O3 support (Puralox SCCA-5/17) was provided by SASOL (Germany). Molybdenum was deposited on the alumina support using incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Sigma–Aldrich), which is a common precursor for MoS2-based catalysts [22]. The impregnated catalysts were dried at 60°C for 12h, and then milled mechanically with K2CO3 precursor (Prolabo). Previously it was found [23] that mechanical mixing of molybdenum sulphide with potassium resulted in better catalytic performance in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The samples were calcined at 550°C under air flow for 2h. The calcined samples were then sulphided in a mixture of 10mol% H2S in H2 at a flow rate of 100ml/min at 400°C for 2h. After the sulphidation, the catalysts have been passivated in a flow of 1% O2 in argon at room temperature. The molybdenum and potassium contents in the samples were between 6 and 15wt.% and between 0 and 24wt.% respectively. The K/Mo molar ratio varied from 0.5 to 4. The catalysts are labelled as xKyMo/Al2O3, where x designates potassium content (wt.%) in the catalysts and y stands for molybdenum loading (wt.%)."
3,Characterisation,"2.2 Characterisation The BET surface area, pore volume, average pore diameter and pore size distribution of the catalysts were determined by N2 physisorption at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. The pore size distribution curves were calculated from the desorption branches of the isotherms using BJH method [24]. The ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using a Cu Kα source. The catalysts were scanned from 2θ of 5° to 70° with a scanning rate of 0.02°s−1. The diffraction patterns were analysed by Eva software (Bruker) and matched using the JCPDS database. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the sulphided samples were carried out in AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics) with 10vol% H2 diluted in argon stream. The total flow rate is 50cm3/min. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 1100°C with the ramping rate at 10°Cmin−1. Then the temperature was kept at 1100°C for 1h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a VG ESCALAB 220 XL spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (E =1486.6eV) X-ray source. The binding energies (BE) of Mo 3d, Co 2p, C 1s and S 2p were determined by computer fitting of the measured spectra and referred to the Al 2p peak of the support at 74.6eV, using Casa XPS software. The binding energies were estimated within ±0.2eV. The Raman spectrometry is constituted by a multi-channel Raman spectrometer (Dilor XY800) with a Krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics model Beamlok) which allows varying the wavelength from the ultraviolet to the near infrared fields. The laser wavelength is 532nm and a filter with D =0.6 is employed. The spectrometer consists of three floors of 800mm focal length equipped with a holographic grating plan 1800lines/mm. The radiation is received by the CCD (charge coupled device) detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. The software allows LabSpec acquisition and data processing. The temperature programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) was carried out in a quartz reactor connected to a mass spectrometer. The samples were first pre-treated in a flow of helium (40cm3/min) at 400°C for 1h then the temperature was lowered to 30°C. CO2 was adsorbed on the sulphided samples using a pulse technique (0.49cm3 of CO2) at 30°C. The CO2 desorption was measured during continuous temperature increase (10°Cmin−1) up to 800°C."
4,Catalytic measurements,"2.3 Catalytic measurements The experimental catalytic tests were conducted using a high-pressure milli-fixed bed stainless steel reactor (id=1.4mm). The feed gas was composed of syngas with H2/CO ratio of 2 and contained 13.2ppm of H2S. Carbon monoxide contained 5% of N2 (internal standard). The reaction was conducted at 360°C and 20bar. The GHSV has been varied from 420 to 4600cm3/g/h. The reactant and stream products were analysed on-line using a GC-456 Bruker gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity and flame ionisation detectors. H2, N2, CO, CH4 and CO2 were separated with a Shincarbon (Resteck®) column and analysed by a TCD detector. C1–C5 hydrocarbons and light alcohols were separated by a Q-Plot (Bruker®) column and measured by FID. The liquid products were collected in an off-line trap and analysed by the same chromatograph. Furthermore, the sulphur-containing products were analysed online using a dedicated gas chromatograph (Brucker, GC-450) equipped with a sulphur-selective pulsed flame photometric detector (PFPD). H2S, COS and mercaptans were separated by Rxi-1ms (Resteck®) column. The selectivity (S) of each product was calculated on carbon basis. The selectivity to hydrocarbons and alcohols takes into account CO2 production in this reaction."

6,Catalyst characterisation,"3.1 Catalyst characterisation 3.1.1 Calcined catalysts The textural characteristics of Al2O3 and calcined K_MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts, determined using the BET/BJH method, are shown in Table 1 . The Puralox alumina had surface, pore volume and diameter in agreement with previous reports [25,26]. The surface area and pore volume decrease in the catalysts after addition of molybdenum and potassium (Table 1). The decrease in surface area and pore volume are probably due to pore plugging and alumina dilution in particular after addition of significant amounts of potassium carbonate. No significant change in the pore diameter was observed. A series of K_MoO3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were characterised by XRD. In addition to γ-alumina, the 15Mo/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher intensities of MoO3 XRD peaks which indicate higher fraction of the crystalline molybdenum oxide phase. The XRD patterns of the calcined samples with 15wt.% Mo and variable K content (from 0 to 24wt.%) are shown in Fig. 1 . In the calcined catalysts (Fig. 1A), an increase in potassium content results in a major drop in the intensity of MoO3 peaks (JCPDF 05-0508, 2θ =25.70°, 27.35°, 33.73°, 38.98°). This indicates stronger interaction between molybdenum, potassium and γ-Al2O3 at higher potassium contents. The presence of K seems to favour mixed K–Mo phases. At K/Mo ratio higher than 0.5 (3K15Mo/Al2O3), MoO3 phase was not detected anymore and all of the XRD patterns were assigned to mixed K–Mo–O oxides. XRD patterns showed the presence of K2MoO4 (JCPDF 29-1011, 2θ =18.87°, 26.27°, 30.65°, 39.42°, 45.83°) and KMo4O6 (JCPDF 87-0730, 2θ =13.08°, 17.07°, 25.49°, 27.47°, 30.15°) species. The XRD intensity of those mixed phases increases with potassium content. The K2CO3 phase (JCPDF 87-0730, 2θ =12.98°, 29.19°, 37.54°, 46.32°) is also observed in the diffraction patterns. As expected, its intensity becomes also more important in the catalysts with high potassium contents [27]. Note that besides the two-component potassium molybdates, the catalysts also exhibited the presence of aluminium molybdate (Al2(MoO4)3, JCPDF 85-2286, 2θ =20.84°, 22.15°, 23.14°, 30.79°, 32.10°) and mixed potassium aluminium molybdates (KAl(MoO4)2, JCPDF 74-2008, 2θ =22.36°, 31.40°, 32.26°, 51.97°). The Al2(MoO4)3 phase was detected for all catalysts; its intensity slightly increases with addition of K. In agreement with Gutierrez et al. [28], the KAl(MoO4)2 phase was only detected in the catalysts with K/Mo molar ratio higher than 2.5 (15K15Mo/Al2O3 and 24K15Mo/Al2O3). The Raman spectra of the calcined K_MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The spectra exhibit the presence of MoO3, Al2(MoO4)3 and polymeric surface molybdates. MoO3 is identified in all the catalysts using Raman frequencies at 153, 288, 334, 662, 818 and 991cm−1 [29,30]. Promotion with K has a strong impact on the absolute and relative intensities of the Raman bands. The intensity of the Raman MoO3 bands decreases with an increase in potassium content. This suggests that in agreement with the XRD results, MoO3 concentration became less significant with higher K loading, suggesting formation of K–Mo mixed oxides. In addition to MoO3, the Raman spectra also exhibit the bands at 372 and 1001cm−1 corresponding to Al2(MoO4)3 [31] . The intensity of the Al2(MoO4)3 band increases with higher K loading. This suggests a strong interaction between molybdenum and alumina in the supported catalysts in the presence of potassium. This observation is also consistent with the XRD characterisation results. The Raman bands at 314, 818, 848 and 896cm−l were attributed to the Mo–O–Mo asymmetric stretching modes of polymerised surface molybdenum oxide clusters in the tetrahedrally coordinated Mo6+ species such as MoO4 2− and the Raman bands at 896, 929 and 954cm−l were attributed to the symmetric stretching of the MoO bond in octahedrally coordinated Mo6+ species such as Mo4O6 2− and Mo7O24 2− [29]. The latest two molybdenum species can be associated to the K–Mo mixed phases. Note that the mixed K–Mo phases (K2MoO4 and K2Mo4O6) were also observed from XRD patterns (Fig. 1). The band at 929cm−1 is also characteristic of well-dispersed polymolybdate species [32]. The band at 372cm−1 is probably due to the overlap of bands corresponding to Al2(MoO4)3 and polymolybdate species [31]. The intensities of the bands at 372, 929 and 1001cm−1 increase with higher K/Mo ratio. In addition, the calcined K-promoted catalysts showed the presence of Raman bands at 961 and 1055cm−1. The peak at 961cm−1 can be assigned to the octahedrally coordinated Mo6+ species [29,31], while the assignment of the peak at 1051cm−1 cannot be exactly established. From our results, we inferred that these two bands might correspond to the KAl(MoO4)2 which was identified in the calcined catalysts using XRD. The Raman data suggest that catalyst promotion of alumina supported molybdenum catalysts with potassium results in a stronger interaction between molybdenum, potassium and alumina and leads to formation of the mixed K–Mo, Mo–Al and K–Mo–Al oxides. The phase composition of the calcined catalysts is summarised in Table S1 (Supplementary material)."
7,Sulphided catalysts,"3.2 Sulphided catalysts Sulphidation results in major modifications of the catalyst structure. The XRD patterns of sulphidated catalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. Interestingly, the diffraction peaks assigned to the molybdenum oxides, potassium molybdate and mixed oxide species almost completely disappeared after sulphidation. The XRD patterns indicate the presence of MoS2 (JCPDF 89-3040, 2θ =14.38°, 32.68°, 39.60°, 49.79°, 58.34°, 60.15°), K2MoS4 (JCPDF 19-1001, 2θ =17.55°, 24.23°, 29.36°, 41.19°, 47.05°, 58.40°) or K-MoS2 (JCPDF 18-1064, 2θ =9.66°, 32.41°, 36.13°, 40.61°, 60.46°). This suggests that the mixed K–Mo–O oxides were sulphided during the pre-treatment with H2S [33]. Note that no potassium carbonate can be detected in the sulphided catalysts. When the potassium concentration is low, potassium sulphides cannot be meaningfully observed by XRD. At higher potassium content, XRD shows the presence of K2S (JCPDF 65-3001, 2θ =34.21°, 49.16°, 61.26°), K2S3 (JCPDF 31-1095, 2θ =28.28°, 30.02°, 32.70°) and K2S5 (JCPDF 01-089-3999, 2θ =19.83°, 30.78°, 31.15°, not well observed until the K/Mo=2.5), and potassium sulphide phases, K2SO4 (JCPDF 83-0681, 2θ =29.80°, 30.79°) and K2S3O6 (JCPDF 01-075-1479, 2θ =16.73°, 18.10°, 23.61°, 24.90°, 26.54°, 28.08°, 31.13°). The intensity of XRD peaks attributed to Al2(MoO4)3 and KAl(MoO4)2 was significantly reduced after sulphidation. Raman spectroscopy was used for further characterisation of the sulphided K_MoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Major modifications of Raman spectra were also observed after sulphidation (Fig. 3 ). The two intense bands at 378cm−1 and 406cm−1, characteristic of MoS2, are observed in both unpromoted and potassium-promoted catalysts [27,29,34]. For the MoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the bands at 818cm−1 and 998cm−1 corresponding to the MoO3 were observed. This suggests that a part of the molybdenum remains as oxide after sulphidation of the unpromoted catalyst. The residual MoO3 phase was not detected by Raman spectroscopy in sulphided K-promoted catalysts. The catalysts with higher potassium content also present the bands at 450cm−1 and 550–600cm−1 which are characteristic of Mo oxysulphide [28,35]. This phase arises from the uncompleted sulphidation of MoO3 oxide. The molybdenum oxidation state in this phase is +5 (further confirmed by XPS). In the catalysts with K/Mo ratio ≥2.5, the bands at 961cm−1 and 1055cm−1 were also detected which can be probably attributed to KAl(MoO4)2. Both of them were already present in the Raman spectra of the oxide catalysts shown in Fig. 2. The Mo 3d and S 2p XPS spectra of sulphided K–Mo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . In the Mo 3d XPS region, several peaks were observed. The broad envelop of the Mo 3d signal can be deconvoluted in three separate overlapping doublets. This suggests that molybdenum is present in three oxidation states: Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+. The more intense signals at 229.0eV and 232.1eV are characteristic of the Mo4+ species (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) which are probably related to the MoS2 phase [36]. In addition, the XPS shows the presence of the peaks with the binding energy of 232.8eV and 235.9eV characteristic of Mo6+ and 230.6eV and 233.7eV which can be assigned to Mo5+ species [37]. The values of the binding energy do not change with potassium addition. Only a very small shift of Mo 3d5/2 peak attributed to Mo4+ to lower binding energy species is observed. Note however that the intensity of the peaks attributed to Mo6+ and Mo5+ phases increases with higher K content [38]. This suggests higher concentration of oxidised molybdenum species in potassium-promoted catalysts. The Mo6+ and Mo5+ present in the sulphided catalysts could be (i) produced during the passivation, (ii) due to the formation of a K2MoS4 phase (also observed by XRD) where Mo exist as Mo6+, (iii) can be related to the formation of the oxysulphide species of the MoO2S2 and MoOS2 type [39], (iv) or due to the interaction of Mo and support resulting in Al2(MoO4)3 which is not sulphided under these conditions. The S 2p XPS spectra are relatively complex for the sulphided K_Mo/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 5). The S 2p peak showed a doublet which reveals the presence of two types of sulphur species. The XPS peaks with the binding energies of 161.6eV and 162.8eV correspond to sulphide ions (S2−), which might be present in K2S and/or MoS2. The binding energy around 162.6eV and 163.8eV could be possibly assigned to poly-sulphide ions (S2 2−) in K–MoS x and K2S x (K2S3/K2S5). Addition of K also leads to a small shift of the S 2p XPS peaks to higher energies. The high energy shift of the sulphur XPS peaks in the 15K15Mo/Al2O3 and 24K15Mo/Al2O3 catalysts indicates that sulphur atoms may be neighboured by some high electronegativity atoms. These atoms might be for example K+ or Mo6+ ions [40]. The S 2p XPS spectra also exhibit other broad peaks at 168.9eV and 170.1eV which are due to the presence of sulphates (SO4 2−). The intensity of these peaks increases with an increase in K/Mo ratio. The presence of sulphates on the catalyst surface might be mainly due to partial molybdenum oxidation during catalyst exposure to air in the passivation. The K 2p XPS spectra (not shown here) were also measured for these catalysts. The K 2p XPS peak is located at binding energies around 293.0eV. The binding energy and peak shape were not affected by potassium content in the samples. The XPS data were also analysed in a more quantitative manner. The surface composition for the sulphided samples calculated from XPS data is given in Table 2 . The surface atomic concentrations of aluminium, oxygen, potassium and sulphur vary as a function of promotion with potassium. It is noticeable that the surface concentration of aluminium and oxygen decreases in the samples with higher potassium content. At the same time, the XPS data are also indicative of enrichment of catalyst surface with molybdenum. Indeed, the surface K/Mo ratio measured from XPS increase is much lower than the bulk K/Mo ratio in the sulphided catalysts. A 8-fold increase in the bulk K/Mo ratio from 0.5 to 4 in the alumina supported molybdenum catalysts (Table 2) results only in a very moderate increase (about 29%) in the surface K/Mo ratio. This suggests that molybdenum is highly dispersed on the catalyst outer surface, while potassium is mostly located in the catalyst bulk where it is undetectable by XPS. The deconvolution of Mo 3p spectra suggests that Mo4+ is a major molybdenum species on the catalyst surface. The potassium promotion slightly affects the oxidation state of Mo. In the K-promoted catalysts, the contribution of Mo4+ species slightly decreases, while the fractions of Mo5+ and Mo6+ species are getting more significant. The presence of Mo5+ and Mo6+ could be associated with both formation of the MoO x S y oxysulphide species, in which O atoms replace the S atoms in the MoS2 structure, and with the presence of sulphate species. The S2− seems to be related to MoS2 sulphides and K2S sulphides, while S2 2− could be principally present in unsaturated sulphide such as MoO x S y or K2S x [41]. Note that the MoO x S y or K2S x phases are also detected in sulphided catalysts by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The basicity of the sulphided catalysts was followed by CO2-TPD (Fig. 6 ). All the catalysts exhibited a broad CO2 desorption peak, in the range 30–300°C and several peaks at 600–800°C. The high temperature peaks seem to be attributed to carbonate species. The carbonate composition could be affected by the presence of potassium. Taking into account very significant stability of carbonates which decompose only at very high temperatures, these species are not likely to be involved in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Note that the total CO2 adsorption measured from the CO2-TPD low temperature peak increases significantly with the addition of potassium. This suggests that addition of potassium leads to the appearance of new basic sites. An almost linear slope was observed in the plot of CO2 adsorption versus potassium content (Fig. 7 ). The peak position was not affected by the presence of potassium; for the all catalysts the maximum of CO2 desorption rate was situated at 104–109°C. This suggests that while the concentration of basic surface sites increases with increase in potassium content, and the strength of the basic sites are not much influenced by the promotion with potassium compared to the alumina support. The H2-TPR profiles were measured for the sulphided K_MoS2/Al2O3 catalysts. They are presented in Fig. 8 . Three types of TPR peaks are observed which correspond to various molybdenum and sulphur species [42]. The H2 consumptions measured from the TPR profiles are given in Table 3 . In agreement with Toulhouat and Kasztelan [43], the low temperature TPR peaks situated between 230°C and 430°C could be related to the hydrogenation of extra-sulphur atoms (chemisorbed H2S or SH groups) or sulphur atoms that are weakly bond to the catalyst surface. Those easily removable species are adsorbed on low coordinated edge/corner sites, which were believed to be responsible for the active sites of the molybdenum catalysts. A slight shift of these peaks towards higher temperature is observable with further addition of K. The presence of the alkali ion seems to stabilise the sulphur adsorption and leads to stronger interactions between S atoms and Mo atoms. The hydrogen consumption for the low temperatures peak is only slightly affected by promotion with potassium (Table 3). The medium temperature TPR peaks between 530°C and 730°C could be related to the hydrogenation of molybdenum and potassium mixed sulphides and sulphates. Note that the peaks in this temperature range are absent in the TPR profiles of the unpromoted alumina supported molybdenum catalyst which does not contain potassium ions. The area of this peak significantly increases with the increase in K loading (Table 3). It can be suggested that the high temperature peaks could be assigned to the reduction of K–Mo–S species and possibly sulphate ions (such as the thiosulphate K2S3O6). All these compounds have been observed in XRD patterns and their concentration also increases with potassium content. In addition, the sulphur atoms located at the edges or basal planes [43] of molybdenum sulphide crystallites could also contribute to these medium temperature TPR peaks. Finally, the broad low-intense high temperature TPR peaks at 950–1000°C seem to be related to the partial reduction of bulk MoS2. It is known [42] that reduction of bulk MoS2 occurs generally at the temperature between 700°C and 1050°C. The MoS2 reduction temperature is usually related to the strength of the Mo–S bond, size of the particles, dispersion on the surface and interactions with the support. High reduction temperature in this case is indicative of relatively large molybdenum sulphide crystallites. To summarize, the catalyst characterization uncovered the presence of the following species in the sulphided catalysts. Sulphided unpromoted Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst: Mostly MoS2 was detected in this catalyst. In addition, some residual concentration of MoO3 has been also detected in this catalyst. Sulphided potassium-promoted catalysts with moderate potassium content (3K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 , 6K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 , and 12K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 ). In addition to the MoS2 phase, however, the promoted catalysts contain several K–Mo mixed sulphides (K2MoS4 or K–MoS2). The potassium-promoted catalysts also exhibited the presence of mixed K–Mo and K–Mo–Al and Mo–Al oxides; these compounds seem to be rather inert and are difficult to sulphidize. Note that MoO3 species were absent in the K-promoted catalysts. Sulphided potassium-promoted catalysts with higher potassium (15K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 , 18K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 , and 24K15Mo/Al 2 O 3 ). In addition to MoS2, mixed sulphides and oxides, significant concentrations of molybdenum oxysulphides were observed in the catalysts with higher potassium content. Higher concentration of basic sites was also observed. Interestingly the strength of the basic sites is not affected by the promotion. All the promoted sulphided catalysts also contain measurable concentrations of K2S, K2S3 and K2S5. The presence of potassium sulphate was also detected which can be due to partial reoxidation of sulphide species. Table 4 gives a summary of molybdenum phase composition of the sulphided catalysts as a function of potassium content."
8,Catalytic tests,"3.3 Catalytic tests 3.3.1 Effect of K promoter on catalytic performance Methane, olefins, paraffins, methanol, ethanol and carbon dioxide were major reaction products detected in carbon monoxide hydrogenation on alumina supported molybdenum catalysts. Carbon monoxide hydrogenation was conducted in the presence of 13.2ppmv of H2S in syngas. Analysis of the reaction products using a selective PFPD detector showed the presence of trace amounts of several sulphur-containing compounds in the reactor outlet. The reaction was conducted at relatively low total pressure (20bar) in order to shift the reaction selectivity from alcohols to olefins. The catalysts were relatively stable under the reaction conditions. The catalyst stability data are shown in Fig. 9 for the 15K15Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. Carbon monoxide did not change during the first 60h on stream, while a slight increase in olefin selectivity was observed with time-on-stream. Similar results were also obtained for other catalysts. A relatively stable catalytic activity could be explained by low carbon deposition in the catalysts. Indeed, TPH experiments conducted with used catalysts (not shown) did not uncover any additional peaks which can be attributed to carbon accumulation. Recently Henseley et al. [44] observed that the presence of sulphur in syngas is crucial for the long-term stability. If the syngas feed does not contain small amount of H2S, oxidisation, carburization, and coking of the catalyst surface may occur on K–CoMoS x after several hundred hours of the reaction. Continuous addition of H2S can maintain the catalysts under operating conditions for a few years [44]. The CO conversion and product selectivities at the steady state obtained at iso-GHSV for unpromoted and potassium-promoted alumina supported molybdenum sulphide catalysts are shown in Table 5 . For the sake of clarity, carbon dioxide was included in the total selectivity calculations. The catalytic performance is strongly affected by promotion with potassium (Table 5, Fig. 10 ). At iso-GHSV=4200cm3/(gcat h), the CO conversion decreases from 48.9% to 11.2% with the increase in K/Mo molar ratio from 0 to 4.0. Under these conditions, addition of potassium generally leads to better selectivity to alcohols [45]. The total alcohol selectivity increases from 0.05% to 18.4% whereas the total hydrocarbon selectivity fluctuates between 50 and 56%. Addition of potassium also results in lower selectivities to CH4 and light paraffins, while the selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons has been significantly enhanced. Fig. 10 displays C2–C4 olefin, methanol and ethanol production rates as functions of potassium content in the catalysts. Only insignificant light olefin and alcohol production rates were observed on the unpromoted molybdenum catalyst. Molybdenum was present in this catalyst as MoS2. This suggests that pure molybdenum sulphide does not provide active sites for synthesis of higher hydrocarbons and alcohols. The olefins and alcohol production rates passed through the maximum as a function of potassium content. The best results in terms of olefin and alcohol productivities were obtained at intermediate potassium contents. Note however that extremely high potassium contents (>15wt.%) could be unfavourable for olefin and alcohol synthesis. The distribution of sulphur-containing products present in trace amounts is shown in Fig. 11 and Table 6 . Their composition is also affected by potassium content in the catalysts. At low potassium content, mostly H2S and COS were detected. The PFPD detects total sulphur content of 14.5ppmv in the reactor outlet while the sulphur concentration in the feed is 13.2ppmv. It can be suggested therefore that the unpromoted alumina supported catalyst does not loose any noticeable amounts of sulphur during the reaction. This suggestion takes into account volume decrease which occurs during carbon monoxide hydrogenation. At higher potassium content, methanethiol, ethanethiol and dimethyl sulphide were also observed. Interestingly, the production of mercaptans on potassium-promoted catalysts coincides with the noticeable selectivity of these catalysts to alcohols and light olefins. This may suggest some similarity in the mechanisms of the formation of mercaptans, olefins and alcohols. The total sulphur concentration in the outlet of the reactor (Table 6) is higher for potassium-promoted catalysts (>20ppmv) than the sulphur content in feed (13.3ppmv). This suggests that sulphur is partially removed from the catalysts during the reaction. Sulphur loss was more noticeable in the catalysts promoted with potassium relative to the unpromoted counterpart. 3.3.2 Effect of different CO conversion on the product selectivity On the unpromoted alumina supported molybdenum catalyst, methane and carbon dioxide were the major reaction products at a wide range of conversions, while the potassium-promoted catalysts exhibited higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons and alcohols. The product selectivities on potassium-promoted catalysts were investigated as a function of carbon monoxide conversion. The results are shown in Fig. 12 . Carbon monoxide conversion at 360°C was adjusted in the range of 10–40% by varying GHSV. As expected, the increase in GHSV leads to lower CO conversion [46,47]. The selectivities to alcohols and hydrocarbons are also considerably affected by carbon monoxide conversion levels. Higher carbon monoxide conversion on all the catalysts leads to increase in methane selectivity, while selectivity to C5+ paraffins drops at higher carbon monoxide conversion. Methane selectivity is particularly significant on the catalysts with low potassium content (Fig. 12A), while the catalysts with higher potassium loading exhibit higher selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons, methanol and higher alcohols (Fig. 12B and C). Noticeable methane selectivity at low carbon monoxide conversions suggests that methane could be possibly one of the primary reaction products. It can be suggested that higher methane selectivity on the catalysts with low potassium content could be attributed to higher fraction of unpromoted MoS2 which selectively produces methane from syngas. The presence of potassium results in partial conversion of MoS2 into mixed K–Mo sulphides, which exhibit lower methane selectivity. An increase in methane selectivity with higher conversion can be due to the methane production via hydrogenolysis of higher paraffins or methanol hydrogenation. Carbon dioxide selectivity is about 30–40% on all the catalysts. On 15K15Mo/Al2O3 (K/Mo=2.5) and 24K15Mo/Al2O3 (K/Mo=4.0), carbon dioxide selectivity increases with higher carbon monoxide conversion which seems to be due to very significant water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. Water is produced in carbon monoxide hydrogenation to hydrocarbons; its concentration increases with conversion. Interestingly, the methanol selectivity as a function of conversion varies differently on the catalysts with different potassium contents. The methanol selectivity increases with conversion on 9K15Mo/Al2O3 catalyst (K/Mo=1.5, Fig. 12A), while methanol selectivity decreases with conversion on the catalysts with high potassium content (15K15Mo/Al2O3 and 24K15Mo/Al2O3, Fig. 12B and C). This might suggest different mechanisms of methanol formation as a function of potassium content. The drop in methanol selectivity coincides with increase in methane selectivity and selectivity to higher alcohols. Thus, decrease in methanol selectivity with conversion on the catalysts with higher potassium contents can be attributed to the secondary reactions such as for example, methanol hydrogenation to methane. Noticeable selectivity to olefins is observed as K/Mo molar ratio gets higher than 1.5. The best olefin selectivity is obtained for the 15K15Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. On the catalysts with higher potassium content, the olefin and alcohol selectivities decrease with the conversion."
9,Discussion,"The obtained results have revealed a strong influence of potassium content in alumina supported catalysts on the structure of molybdenum phases and their performance in carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The molybdenum phase composition is strongly affected by the presence of potassium in both calcined and sulphided catalysts. Mostly supported molybdenum oxide and sulphides are observed at low potassium contents, while higher potassium content leads to the appearance of the mixed K–Mo, Mo–Al and K–Mo–Al species which were identified by XRD, Raman and XPS (Figs. 1–4). Interestingly, the data show a correlation between formation of the mixed species in the calcined and sulphided catalysts. Indeed, strong interaction between molybdenum and potassium already occurs at the stage of catalyst calcination and leads to mixed K–Mo oxides [48]. This interaction further governs the catalyst phase composition and catalytic performance [16]. XRD patterns did not show any detectable concentration of MoO3 in the calcined K-promoted catalysts. MoO3 readily converts into mixed K–Mo oxides after addition of relatively small amounts of potassium. Molybdenum trioxide disappeared completely after reacting with potassium in the catalyst with K/Mo ratio of 2.5. The presence of potassium results also in formation of Al–Mo and K–Al–Mo mixed phases. The mixed Mo–K oxides are then converted in the presence of H2S into mixed sulphides. XRD shows than even mixed Mo–Al and K–Mo–Al oxides can be partially converted into molybdenum sulphides in the presence of H2S. This result is consistent with XPS which shows relatively high fraction (>0.75) of Mo4+ species probably associated to MoS2 species (Table 2). Relatively large crystallites of molybdenum sulphide were produced. An increase in potassium content leads also to the appearance of mixed K–Mo sulphide and molybdenum oxysulphides. Higher potassium content results in a higher fraction of Mo5+ and Mo6+ species [13]. According to a study of Woo et al. [49], the oxidised K2CO3/MoS2 catalyst, i.e. with a significant amount of Mo6+, produces mostly hydrocarbons while the catalyst with a significant amount of Mo4+ produces mainly alcohols. Hensley et al. [44] suggested that the presence of oxidised molybdenum species would increase the catalyst acidity (via formation of acidic MoO–H groups) and would result in lower selectivity to alcohols. Higher acidity could be also favourable for carbon deposition and thus affects the catalyst stability. Thus the level of potassium addition could be of a great influence on molybdenum oxidation state and sulphidation, which can orientate the selectivity in CO hydrogenation reaction. Potassium promotion also has a strong impact on the catalyst basicity. In the presence of 24wt.% of potassium, the concentration of basic sites identified by CO2 desorption at 90–120°C increases by a factor of 3 after addition of 24wt.% of potassium. The catalyst basicity could be an important parameter which would affect the rate of secondary reactions such as reabsorption and hydration of olefins or oxygenated products. It was reported that the catalyst acido-basic properties could be strongly correlated to the rate of olefin hydration [50]. Previously, Bian et al. [51] have demonstrated that while the sample possesses a strong acidity, the selectivity to mixed alcohols was low and while the sample shows a weak acidity, the selectivity to mixed alcohols became high. They highlighted that the strong acidic sites on K_Mo/Al2O3 catalyst which had not been covered by K–Mo species may be the principal reason of the high hydrocarbon selectivity. The catalyst basicity and acidity can be also modified by using different potassium precursors (potassium chloride, sulphate, etc.) in the preparation of alumina supported catalysts. The catalytic data suggest that unpromoted molybdenum sulphide does not produce any noticeable concentration of alcohols and olefins. Indeed, the selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons and alcohols is very low on the unpromoted alumina supported molybdenum catalyst [52]. In agreement with previous reports [16,27,53], it can be concluded that the active sites associated with molybdenum sulphide are not active for olefin and higher alcohol synthesis. Fig. 10 shows simultaneous appearance of methanol, C2–C4 olefins and ethanol as the potassium content in the catalysts reaches 6wt.%. At the same time, the methane selectivity has been significantly reduced at higher potassium loadings. The appearance of olefin and alcohols coincides with detection of mixed K–Mo–S species. Comparison of the catalyst data with characterisation indicates a major role of mixed K–Mo sulphides in synthesis of olefins and alcohols on the K-promoted molybdenum catalysts. The mixed K–Mo–S species seem to provide active sites for olefin and alcohol synthesis. Interestingly, our data also showed that production of olefins and oxygenates coincides with appearance of methanethiol, ethanethiol and dimethyl sulphide on the catalysts with high potassium content (Figs. 10 and 11). This indicates that similar active species might be involved in both alcohol and thiol synthesis on promoted MoS2 catalysts. The methanol selectivity increases with conversion on the catalysts with low molybdenum content, while it drops on the 15K15Mo/Al2O3 and 24K15Mo/Al2O3 catalysts. This suggests that methanol can be involved in secondary tractions on the catalyst with higher molybdenum content such as hydrogenation to methane or synthesis of olefins and C2+ alcohols. While promotion with potassium has a beneficial effect on the olefin and alcohol synthesis, the olefin and methanol production rates drop at higher potassium contents. Characterisation is indicative of the major modifications of catalyst structure at higher potassium content. The presence of molybdenum oxysulphides and molybdenum atoms in higher oxidation state was detected by Raman and XPS in sulphided 18K15Mo/Al2O3 and 24K15Mo/Al2O3 catalysts. Fig. 9 shows that olefins and alcohol production rates decrease at very high potassium contents. It can be suggested that these species could be harmful for olefin synthesis."
10,Conclusion,"Promotion of alumina supported molybdenum catalysts with potassium carbonate via mechanical mixing leads to Mo–K mixed species in both calcined and sulphided catalysts. The MoO3 phase present in the calcined unpromoted catalyst disappears at relatively low potassium content while formation of mixed K–Mo, Mo–Al and K–Mo–Al oxides occurs in the calcined catalysts. Addition of K makes the interaction between support and Mo stronger and leads to mixed Mo–Al and Kk–Mo–Al oxides. In the sulphided catalysts, the characterisation indicates the presence of both molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) and mixed K–Mo sulphides. The fraction of K–Mo–S phases increases with increase in potassium content. Potassium promotion also results in higher concentration of basic sites without any noticeable modification of their strength. At higher potassium content, in addition to molybdenum sulphide and K–Mo sulphides, molybdenum oxysulphides were also detected. Methane is a major product of carbon monoxide hydrogenation on MoS2, while olefins and alcohols are produced on mixed sulphide species. The higher olefin and alcohol productivities were observed on the catalyst with moderate K/Mo ratio. All the catalysts exhibit high water–gas shift activity. Analysis of catalytic data for potassium-promoted alumina supported molybdenum catalysts is indicative of the presence of two kinds of active sites for carbon monoxide hydrogenation, associated respectively with molybdenum and mixed K–Mo–S sulphides. Molybdenum oxysulphides are probably not involved in the reaction under the reaction conditions."
