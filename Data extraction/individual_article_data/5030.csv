0,Introduction,"Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a redox-induced luminescence process, where intermediate species generated in the vicinity of the working electrode undergo electron-transfer reaction to form excited state that emits light upon returning to the ground state [1–5]. ECL, which combines the two methods of electrochemistry and spectroscopy, possesses advantages of high sensitivity, low background signal and simple operation [2,6,7]. Therefore, ECL is widely applied in the field of bioimaging [7,8], constructing sensing platforms [9–11], studying the surface defect state of novel nanomaterials [12], and analyzing the dynamic process of optical and electrochemical reactions [13,14]. It is well-known that ruthenium tris(bipyridine) and its derivatives are the most competed ECL luminophore due to stable emission output and high ECL efficiency. And the typical representative is tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)3 2+) [10]. However, the ECL signal of individual Ru(bpy)3 2+ is relatively low. In order to improve the luminescence intensity, effective coreactants are added. It has been verified that tripropylamine (TPA) is one of the most traditional coreactants in the Ru(bpy)3 2+-based ECL system [13,15]. Nevertheless, TPA has some limitations such as volatility, toxicity, corrosiveness, and is usually used at high concentrations [3,16]. Resultantly, considerable efforts are still devoted to developing prospective coreactants of Ru(bpy)3 2+. Therein, large numbers of Ru(bpy)3 2+-molecular coreactants, mainly including poly(etherimide), poly-l-lysine, bi-arginine, l-cysteine, thiosemicarbazide etc, have been adopted [17–22]. With the exception of molecular coreactants, many nanomaterials based on carbon, nitride, metal, and II-VI semiconductor have been discovered to serve as effective coreactants, which provide novel characterization methodologies, new Ru(bpy)3 2+-based ECL enhancement mechanisms and novel sensing strategies [3,13,23]. Recently, besides their luminescent functions, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and CQDs-based composites have been increasingly used as newly-emerging coreactants of Ru(bpy)3 2+ due to their good biocompatibility and low toxicity [3,23–31]. Pang’s group firstly reported that the effect of CQDs on the anodic Ru(bpy)3 2+ ECL was analogous to that of TPA, and its principal functional sites were the benzyl alcohol units on CQDs surface [23]. In our group, several new CQDs-based composites such as NCQDs [28], nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) [24,25] and polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized NCQDs (NCQDs@PEI) [29,30] have also been used as the effective coreactants of Ru(bpy)3 2+ to construct ECL sensing platforms for sensitive and selective determination of analytes. In recent experiments, we discovered that combining with NCQDs, enhanced ECL intensity could be expected when using tris(4,4′-dicarboxylicacid-2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) dichloride (Ru(dcbpy)3Cl2) to replace Ru(bpy)3 2+ to construct a solid-state ECL system. Therefore, in this work, we reported a new self-enhanced ECL sensor where Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ worked as luminophore and NCQDs acted as coreactant by simply dropping them together. Based on the functional groups in Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs, a self-enhanced ECL composite was produced via the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs, which resulted in short electron-transfer distance. And exceedingly good ECL signal could be obtained without the introduction of signal amplification reagent. Its ECL performances were confirmed by selecting 17β-estradiol (E2) as the target model. High-performance analysis of E2 were successfully realized. When the aptamer sensor was used to quantify E2 in milk powder, the accuracy of the testing results was verified by national standard method of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, GB/T 21981–2008)."
1,Experimental section,
2,Fabrication of the solid-state ECL aptamer sensor,"2.1 Fabrication of the solid-state ECL aptamer sensor The construction process of the solid-state ECL aptamer sensor was stated in Scheme 1 . Before modification, common workmanship was applied to pretreat the glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm). After natural drying, 3 μL 2 × 10-4 mol L-1 Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ solution and 3 μL 0.2 mg mL−1 NCQDs were dropped on the GCE surface to obtain novel solid-state ECL interface (NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE). Then, 3 μL 0.5 wt% Nafion was used to avoid falling off of the materials from the electrode surface. Subsequently, the obtained electrode was immersed into 1% HAuCl4 solution and electrodeposited at − 0.30 V for 25 s to gain gold particles (AuPs). Thereafter, 6 μL 1.2 × 10-7 mol L-1 thiol functionalized E2 aptamer was immobilized by Au-S covalent bonds to obtain the Apt/AuPs/NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE at 4 °C for 6 h. Next, 6 μL 1% BSA was dropped on GCE surface at 37 °C to block non-specific sites. Ultimately, the BSA/Apt/AuPs/NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE was incubated with 6 μL E2 solution for 30 min to further quantify E2."
3,Sample preparation,"2.2 Sample preparation The milk powder was purchased from local supermarket in Zhenjiang, China, and was treated according to reported method [32]. 5 g milk powder and 30 mL ethanol were thoroughly mixed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to obtain homogeneous suspension. Then, the acquired solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min to collect the supernatant. After that, the impurities of the supernatant sample were filtered by 0.22 μm cellulose membrane. Furthermore, the sample was diluted to get the store solution."

5,ECL behaviors and mechanism investigation of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE,"3.1 ECL behaviors and mechanism investigation of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE In our previous investigation, it was accidentally discovered that when NCQDs (Characterization is exhibited in Fig. S1) was applied as the coreactant of Ru(bpy)3 2+ to develop solid-state ECL sensor, limited enhancement ECL intensity was obtained. Interestingly, when the ECL emitter Ru(bpy)3 2+ was replaced by Ru(dcbpy)3 2+, the ECL intensity of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ was greatly enhanced by NCQDs, which was a charming phenomenon. Specifically, the superiority of ECL performances of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE was firstly investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. As is shown in Fig. 1 A, bare GCE (curve a) and NCQDs modified GCE (NCQDs/GCE, curve b) show no redox peaks in PBS buffer, while Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE (curve c) exhibits obvious oxidation peak at 1.22 V and reduction peak at 1.15 V, respectively. With the further modification of NCQDs on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE, the oxidation current of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ obviously increases and the reduction peak current is almost constant (curve d), suggesting the NCQDs catalytic effect on the process of the Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ oxidation [3,25]. Corresponding ECL behaviors of different modified GCE were illustrated in Fig. 1B. GCE (curve a) and NCQDs/GCE (curve b) have no apparent ECL responses, and a distinct ECL intensity of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE beginning at 0.99 V and peaking at 1.22 V is observed (curve c, 383 a.u.). After further modified by NCQDs, a very satisfactory signal amplification result with the ECL intensity of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE is 18-fold higher than that of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE (curve d, 7047 a.u) is obtained, which should be attributed to the coreactant property of NCQDs during the oxidation process [3,29]. In order to confirm the roles of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs, the ECL spectrum of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE is compared with photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+, NCQDs and their mixture, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 1C and Fig. 1D that the ECL spectrum of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE is basically consistent with the PL spectrum of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+, but separate from that of NCQDs, whether Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ or NCQDs exist alone or in a mixed manner. Therefore, it can be inferred that the ECL intensity of the Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/NCQDs system comes from Ru(dcbpy)3 2+, and NCQDs should act as coreactant according to previous literature reports [3,23]. However, considering such a strong magnification of NCQDs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/GCE, do NCQDs only play the role of a common coreactant? As previously reported, oxygen-containing CQDs can form intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carboxyl (–COOH)-rich materials [33–35]. Herein, Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ is rich in –COOH groups (Fig. S2A), and NCQDs contains a large number of –COOH, amine (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the surface (Fig. S2B). Consequently, we speculated that intermolecular hydrogen bonds induced self-enhanced composite of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs might be formed in the solid contact layer, which could short electron-transfer distance and reduce energy loss, resulting in higher signal amplification effect [25,35]. Aiming at verifying the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs, the EC and ECL responses with different luminophore and coreactant were further investigated by the way of the functional group shielding method. To begin with, when Ru(bpy)3 2+ was used as luminophore instead of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs was still used as coreactant, it can be seen from Fig. 2 A that the introduction of NCQDs enables the oxidation peaks of Ru(bpy)3 2+/GCE to increase slightly (curve a, b) and the ECL signal to enhance by just 1.7-fold (curve á, b́). Compared with the 18-fold enhancement effect of NCQDs on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ (Fig. 1B), the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)3 2+ is amplified by only one-tenth of that of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+/NCQDs system, demonstrating that the –COOH groups of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ plays an important role to form the intermolecular hydrogen bonds with NCQDs. Furthermore, CQDs was chosen as Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ coreactant to shield nitrogen-containing groups on the surface of NCQDs to proof the existence of hydrogen bonds. Fig. 2B illustrates that the EC catalytic effect and ECL enhancement ability of CQDs on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ were significantly lower than that of NCQDs under the same conditions (Fig. 1B), which should be attributed to that the absence of nitrogen-containing groups weakens the intermolecular hydrogen bonds. These results suggest that Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs indeed form intermolecular hydrogen bonds-induced self-enhanced composite to amplify the ECL signal of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ (Fig. 2C). Therefore, based on the aforementioned investigations and consulted literatures [3,25], the possible ECL mechanism of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs self-enhanced ECL composite can be inferred as follows: firstly, the composite in the solid contact layer is firstly electro-oxidized (Formula 1) and lose a proton to generate Ru(dcbpy)3 3+-NCQDs• (Formula 2). Subsequently, the electron transfer from the NCQDs• to Ru(dcbpy)3 3+ by intramolecular reaction to generate the excited state of composite (Ru(dcbpy)3 2+*-NCQDs) (Formula 3), which are capable to emit light when Ru(dcbpy)3 2+*-NCQDs returns to the ground state (Formula 4). Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs − 2e- → Ru(dcbpy)3 3+-NCQDs•+ (1.Electrochemical oxidation) Ru(dcbpy)3 3+-NCQDs•+ → Ru(dcbpy)3 3+-NCQDs• + H+ (2.Deprotonation) Ru(dcbpy)3 2+*-NCQDs → Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs + hν (4.ECL luminescence)"
6,Construction and feasibility investigation of the self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor,"3.2 Construction and feasibility investigation of the self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor On account of the excellent signal amplification advantages of NCQDs on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ ECL, a novel-type ECL aptamer sensor based on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs was developed and E2 was chosen as a typical analyte to assess its analytical performances. The interface properties of each modified layers were simultaneously investigated via EC and ECL technology. Fig. 3 A exhibits the CV responses of the ECL aptamer sensor in PBS. The redox peaks appearing at 1.22 V, 1.15 V, and 0.42 V were clearly observed on the interface of AuPs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs/GCE (curve a). Among them, the peaks at 1.22 V and 1.15 V are ascribed to the Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ designated as the EC probe, and the peak appearing at 0.42 V is attributed to the reduction peak of AuPs (The SEM characterization of AuPs are shown in Fig. S3) [30,36], which is introduced to specifically bind aptamer of E2. With the introduction of E2 aptamer, the redox current apparently decreases (curve b) because the loading of aptamer hindered the capability of electron transfer, thereby diminishing the EC signal [32,37]. Upon the assembling of BSA, the current decrease (curve c) owing to the poor conductivity of BSA. After Apt/BSA/AuPs/Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs/GCE is incubated with E2 solution, the current further reduce (curve d) since captured E2 reduce electron transfer rate [32]. The corresponding ECL responses were stated in Fig. 3B. After electrodeposition of AuPs on the modified electrode, the ECL signal attains to 5973 a.u. (curve a). With the modification of E2 aptamer on AuPs surface by Au-S bonds, the ECL intensity is quenched to 4076 a.u. (curve b) because aptamer impedes the electron transfer rate [32]. After that, the as-prepared electrode is incubated with a nontargeting protein (1% BSA) to block the non-specific sites, which results in the decrease of ECL intensity (curve c, 2264 a.u.) on account of its poor conductivity. When target E2 is incubated with its aptamer, a further decreased ECL behavior (curve d, 1062 a.u.) is received. These ECL results are in good agreement with those of EC data. Moreover, the investigations in the absence of aptamer, in the presence of aptamer and random DNA sequence are implemented by comparing the ECL intensity, and obtained results demonstrate that the proposed ECL aptamer sensor is expected to perform superior sensitivity and selectivity for E2 determination (Fig. S4 and S5)."
7,Detection performances of the self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor,"3.3 Detection performances of the self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor Analytical performances of the as-constructed ECL aptamer sensor based on Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs self-enhanced composite for E2 determination were investigated under optimal conditions (Optimization of experimental parameters is exhibited in Fig S6). It can be evidently seen from inset of Fig. 4 A that ECL signal of the as-developed ECL aptamer sensor gradually decrease with higher E2 concentration (CE2). ECL aptamer sensor shows a wider linear range of 1.0 × 10-14 − 1.0 × 10-6 mol L-1 and a lower detection limit of 1.0 × 10-15 mol L-1 (Fig. 4A) compared with the ECL sensor without aptamer (Fig. S7), which is benefited from the assembled aptamer capturing more E2. Satisfactorily, the linear regression equation is IECL = − 49.92–126.81 logCE2 (R2 = 0.9985). Compared with the reported methods, the widest linear range and the lowest detection limit are acquired because of high-intensity ECL properties of Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs composite (Table S1). In order to affirm the selectivity of the as-developed ECL aptamer sensor, some potential interference substances, mainly including ethynylestradiol, diethystulbestrol, estriol and bisphenol A with 1000-fold concentration, were selected to study their ECL behaviors. As can be seen from Fig. 4B, ethynylestradiol, diethystulbestrol, estradiol, bisphenol A and their mixture with 10-6 mol L-1 concentration enable the ECL intensity to decrease by 1.6%, 5.8%, 6.3%, 13.2% and 5.8% respectively. As expected, the ECL intensity caused by 10-9 mol L-1 E2 and corresponding mixture decrease by 49.7% and 52%, respectively. The results further indicate the high selectivity of the ECL aptamer sensor for E2 determination. Furthermore, the repeatability by 6 parallel ECL aptamer sensor is performed and the relative standard deviation (RSD) is 1.7% (Fig. S8A), and the ECL signal after one week still remains 85.6% of the initial intensity (Fig. S8B), indicating a satisfactory repeatability and a good stability of the ECL aptamer sensor."
8,The E2 analysis in milk powder,"3.4 The E2 analysis in milk powder According to previously reported literatures [32,37], E2 may be present in milk powder since it can be used as additive into cow feed to improve the milk production. However, excessive E2 in milk powder will affect human health [38–40]. Therefore, milk powder was selected as the real sample to certify the practicability of the Ru(dcbpy)3 2+-NCQDs-based self-enhanced ECL aptamer sensor, and the standard addition method was carried out for E2 determination in milk powder. The milk powder was treated by dissolving, centrifuging and filtering process. As exhibited in Table 1 , the recoveries of spiked milk powder are between 95.7% and 110%, and the average recovery of three adding levels was 102% with RSDs below 5.65%. Simultaneously, the accuracy of the developed sensor was verified by the national standard method (LC-MS/MS, GB/T 21981–2008). Obviously, both of two methods exhibit the good recoveries, illustrating the comparable reliability of the developed method in practical application. Table 1 ."
9,Conclusion,"In summary, for the first time, we innovatively reported a new type self-enhanced ECL sensing strategy by simply dropping the luminophore (Ru(dcbpy)3 2+) and coreactant (NCQDs) onto the electrode surface. In which, an intermolecular hydrogen bonds played a key role in an induced self-enhanced composite. The as-prepared ECL system exhibited high ECL intensity because Ru(dcbpy)3 2+ and NCQDs were co-existing in the same composite. As a result, the high-performance analysis of the as-developed ECL aptamer sensor were successfully realized towards E2. More forward-looking, the as-developed self-enhanced ECL sensing strategy could be developed into a universal sensor by programming the analytes and specific recognition element."
