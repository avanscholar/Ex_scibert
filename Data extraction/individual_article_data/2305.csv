0,Introduction,"Exploiting into the catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass to bulk chemicals and transportation fuels has rapidly expanded over the past decade due to the exhaustion of the traditional fossil energy and increased concerns about climate change [1–3]. Agricultural residues represent attractive feedstocks for this declared attempt because they are abundant particularly in China and can be gathered in a sustainable pattern. The industrial production of furfural (FAL) straight from hemicellulose-rich wastes (e.g., sugarcane bagasse, corncob) is mature through well-established methods, with an annual production close to 300 kTon [4–6]. FAL has been identified as one of the most alluring biomass-derived platform molecules, which is significant precursor for the preparation of versatile industrial chemicals and fuel additives, such as furfuryl alcohol (FOL), 2-methylfuran [7–8]. The importance of γ-valerolactone (GVL) that represents a promising biomass-based commodity is noteworthy, supporting its use as an advanced fuel oxygenate additive and excellent solvent in biomass processing [9], as well as a specially building block to synthesize liquid alkenes [10], renewable polymers [11–12], and other value-added chemicals [13–15]. Currently, numerous studies focused on the production of GVL from hydrogenation of levulinic acid and its esters, and the near-quantitative yield could be accomplished from the persistent efforts [16–17]. In particular, the strategy of catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) using accessible liquid hydrogen donors (alcohols or formic acid) and inexpensive noble-metal-free catalysts represents more attractive [18–19]. On the side, it is known that levulinic acid and its esters can be readily gained via acid-catalyzed transformation of FOL [20–22], which stems from the hydrogenation of FAL [23–24]. Each single step has been widely explored and various catalytic systems have been proposed in previous reports [16–21,23–25]. To evade the separation of chemical intermediate, increase the overall carbon yields and reduce cost for industrial implementation, it is highly desirable to produce GVL from raw FAL via an integrated catalytic process in a one-pot cascade reaction. Literature presents the possibility to directly convert FAL to GVL through sequential CTH and hydrolysis/alcoholysis reaction with the cooperation of metal species, Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. Incipiently, several physically mixed catalyst systems were successfully developed, for instance: the combination of Zr-Beta zeolite and Al-MFI-ns [26], Au/ZrO2 and H-ZSM-5 [27]. As a result, GVL yield up to 78% could be gained from FAL using secondary alcohol as a hydrogen donor and solvent (e.g., iso-propanol, sec-propanol). Using a single catalyst may simplify the experimental operation process and conductive to the recycling of catalyst. Eventually, a series of ingenious multifunctional catalysts were fabricated and found to be efficient in the cascade reaction from FAL to GVL, e.g., Sn-Al-Beta zeolite [28], Zr-Al-Beta [29], Zr-containing heteropolyacid supported on β-zeolite [30–31], Zr-graphitic carbon nitride/H-β composite [32], Hf-based metal organic framework [33], and Zr-supported mesoporous zeolite [34–35]. The obtained GVL yields directly from FAL ranged from 60% to 87%. These reports have demonstrated that ZrO2 represents a superior supporter to impart metal and Lewis acid sites in the CTH process. In spite of significant advances from the persistent efforts, it is still fundamental to increase the activity, stability, and recyclability of catalyst to cater to green chemistry and sustainable biorefining for the practical implementation. Functionalized magnetic catalyst has emerged as a viable alternative to the conventional heterogeneous catalyst, as it possesses a realistic advantage of being magnetically separable, thereby avoiding the requirement of catalyst filtration [36]. Till now, many types of magnetic nanoparticles can be synthesized for different application, including iron oxides (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) and cobalt, manganese, nickel, and magnesium ferrite [37]. Among them, Fe3O4 is considered as a first-class magnetic material in the field of catalysis because it is easy to synthesize with size-monodisperse particles and high saturation magnetization [38–43]. The preparation of Fe3O4 involves coprecipitation method, ultrasonic chemical reduction method, solvothermal and hydrothermal method. The chemical coprecipitation represents one of the most commonly used method for the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, with the magnetization up to 58.0 emu/g. Inspired by the present advances, we fabricated monolithic multifunctional catalyst containing magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ZrO2 species with tunable Lewis and Brønsted acidities via a coprecipitation-impregnation method, to positively convert FAL to GVL in a one-pot model of integration two-step CTH reaction and one-step alcoholysis process with iso-propanol as a hydrogen donor and solvent. A mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41, riches in acid sites, was served as a preferred porous support for loading Fe3O4 and ZrO2 due to its thermally stable pore walls and high surface area to disperse the active species [44–46]. The characterization and catalysis investigations of the as-synthesized catalysts were systematically combined in view to reveal the reaction mechanism and catalyst properties. The kinetic behavior describing the cascade conversion of FAL to GVL with the developed catalytic strategy was explored to monitor the process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of a magnetic multifunctional catalyst for direct GVL production from FAL that possesses powerful catalytic activity, high separation efficiency and good reusability."

All chemicals were used directly without further purification or treatment."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Synthesis of Fe3O4@MCM-41 3 g of MCM-41, 2 g of FeCl3‧6H2O and 1 g of FeCl2‧4H2O were added into 200 mL of deionized water and mechanical stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h to dissolve FeCl3‧6H2O and FeCl2‧4H2O. Subsequently, the pH value was adjusted to 10 by adding concentrated NH3‧H2O, and stirred continuously for 12 h at room temperature. Then the resulting sample was filtered and dried in 80 °C for 12 h, finally the obtained solid was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, and labeled as Fe3O4@MCM-41. 2.2.2 Synthesis of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 1.68 g of Zr(NO3)4‧5H2O was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water, then 3 g of the as- prepared Fe3O4@MCM-41 was added and the mixture was ultrasonic treated for 10 min to enable Zr(NO3)4‧5H2O fully dissolve. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. Then, the excess water in the mixture was evaporated by vacuum distillation. Drying at 80 °C for 12 h and calcining at 550 °C in nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h. The obtained solid was labeled as Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41."
4,Catalyst characterizations,"2.3 Catalyst characterizations Prior to the measurements, the prepared catalysts were dried at 110 °C for 24 h to remove physisorbed water. The specific surface area was measured by the Brunnauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and mean pore size was evaluated by JW-BK 112 surface analyzer. Before the BET measurement, all catalysts were degassed in vacuum at 120 °C for 2 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image was provided using a FEI Tecnai G2 20 instrument operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI system with a 158 Al Kα radiation source. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA over a 2θ range of 0° to 80° at a scanning speed of 10°/min. The basic/acidic properties of different catalysts were determined through temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3–/CO2-TPD) by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipment. Firstly, a 40 mg sample was in a quartz reactor and degassed under a flowing He (50 mL/min) at 150 °C for 2 h. The temperature was then cooled to 50 °C and NH3/CO2-He (10 vol% NH3/CO2) mixture was introduced for 0.5 h. The TPD results were obtained in He flow by increasing the temperature from 50 °C to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and then kept at 300 °C for 2 h. Pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) was conducted using a Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer in the wavenumber range of 1700–1400 cm−1. The magnetization data were acquired in a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID XL magnetometer."
5,Procedure for catalytic reaction,"2.4 Procedure for catalytic reaction All catalytic experiments were performed in a 20 mL cylindrical stainless steel pressurized reactor, equipped with a mechanical stirrer. For a typical reaction, 10 mL of iso-propanol, 0.5 mmol of FAL and 0.4 g of catalyst were added to the reactor vessel, the reactor was heated in an oil bath for about 24 h at 150 °C. Then, the reaction system was stirred at 600 rpm and heated up to desired reaction temperature. Once reaction time was reached, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature with cool water. The spent catalyst was separated by an external magnet from reaction mixture after each run, washed with ethanol three times, dried at 80 °C for 4 h at nitrogen atmosphere, and then directly used for the next run. And the liquid sample separated from the reaction solution was diluted with chromatographic ethanol to a certain concentration and further filtrated with a syringe filter (pore size: 0.22 μm) prior to quantitative analysis. Each experiment was repeated three times to increase the certainty of the results, and the data were reported as averages of repeated experiments."
6,Product analysis,"2.5 Product analysis Identification of liquid products was achieved with gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7820A) equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) using a capillary DB-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm). The products were quantitatively analyzed on the basis of standard curves with commercial samples using methyl levulinate as internal standard. GC analysis operating conditions were as following: carrier gas was N2 with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, injection port temperature was 250 °C, the temperature program used in the analysis was from 50 °C to 220 °C with a heating ramp of 20 °C/min, and the detector temperature was 300 °C. The concentrations of FAL, isopropyl levulinate (IPL) and GVL were calculated by using a standard curve based on known concentration of these compounds. Quantitative analysis of 2-isopropoxymethylfuran (IPMF) was calculated using calibration data of propyl levulinate due to the commercially unavailable and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). FAL conversion (CFAL , %), IPMF yield (YIPMF , %), IPL yield (YIPL , %) and GVL yield (YGVL , %) were calculated according to equations 1–4: (1) C FAL m o l % = 1 - M FALF / M FALI × 100 % (2) Y IPMF m o l % = M IPMF / M FALI × 100 % (3) Y IPL m o l % = M IPL / M FALI × 100 % (4) Y GVL m o l % = M GVL / M FALI × 100 % where, M FALF , M FALI , M IPMF , M IPL , and M GVL stand for the final molar weight of FAL, the initial molar weight of FAL, the final molar weight of IPMF, the final molar weight of IPL and the final molar weight of GVL, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization The textural properties of a series of catalysts were measured by N2-physisorption measurements with BET, including surface area, pore volume and pore diameter, and the results are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the bulk ZrO2 adopted a small surface area (60.3 m2/g) and total pore volume (0.25 cm3/g) (entry 1, Table 1). In addition, MCM-41 featured the largest surface area (1027.1 m2/g) (entry 2, Table 1), however, its surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were decreased upon the deposition of ZrO2 (entry 3, Table 1). This is due to blockage of the pores and coverage of the catalyst surface with ZrO2. ZrO2@SBA-15 and ZrO2@ZSM-5 showed lower surface area compared to that of ZrO2@MCM-41 (entries 3–5, Table 1). It is worth noting that the textural properties of MCM-41 had been significantly affected by the incorporation of Fe3O4, seeing that the decrease of surface area and pore sizes (entry 7, Table 1). Even though such a change in the textural properties, the solid catalyst of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 still had a high surface area (entry 8, Table 1), which was favorable for the catalytic reaction. Moreover, the surface area of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 after five recycling cycles did not change significantly compared with that of fresh one (entry 9, Table 1). However, when ZSM-5 or SBA-15 was used as the support to get Fe3O4/ZrO2@SBA-15 and Fe3O4/ZrO2@ZSM-5, a great decrease in surface area was observed (entries 10–11, Table 1), which is not conducive to the reaction. TEM images revealed the ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure of MCM-41 (Fig. 1 a), and the parallel ordered 2D hexagonal channel still could be observed clearly in Fig. 1b and c after the embedding of ZrO2 and Fe3O4. Moreover, the TEM images indicated the MCM-41 structure with pore diameter of 3.47–3.70 nm, which is consistent with the BET results in Table 1, suggesting MCM-41 still presented excellent range order and dimensional pores after combined with zirconium species and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Fig. 1 d further revealed that the hexagonal channel and magnetic Fe3O4 particles still existed in the recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, indicating Fe3O4 is steady binding with MCM-41 support. In order to determine the elements content of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, EDX analysis was performed (Fig. 1 c). As depicted, the EDX elemental mappings showed the presence of Zr (purple), Fe (green), Al (orange), Si (yellow), and as well as O (red) in described material, which revealed a homogeneous distribution of both Fe and Zr within the MCM-41 mesoporous structure. These results indicated the successful formation of Fe3O4 in MCM-41 support, and a finely dispersion of the Fe and Zr across the MCM-41 with a high density was obtained. The dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles had been further confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The SEM image of MCM-41 (Fig. 1 e) showed spherical particles with uniform size and diameter at the nanometer level. ZrO2@MCM-41 (Fig. 1 f) still maintained a spherical structure, but it generated aggregation due to the incorporation of ZrO2. Fig. 1 g revealed the uniform and nearly spherical nanoparticles in the surface of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, suggesting that the Fe3O4 magnetite had been encapsulated into Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, this result is consistent with the TEM observation. In order to assess the incorporation of ZrO2 into MCM-41, the catalysts were further characterized by means of XPS analysis (Fig. 2 a). The XPS spectra showed that the crucial elements in catalysts are O, C, Si, Al, Zr and Fe. All the catalysts displayed two peaks at 185.9 and 183.8 eV assigned to Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2, respectively. The finding suggested the ZrO2 preferential incorporation into MCM-41 silica framework. The determined Si/Zr molar ratio of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 and ZrO2@MCM-41 were 20.8 and 20.6 respectively, which are closer to theoretical values of the designed catalysts. It also suggests that the introduction of Fe3O4 did not influence the load of Zr species. In the case of recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, the sample with the higher Si/Zr molar ratio (23.2), which was due to the leaching of Zr species in a very low degree during the catalytic reaction. Furthermore, it should be particularly noted that no significant changes in characteristic peak of Zr were observed in Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, demonstrating that the introduction of Fe3O4 did not change the valence state of Zr atom. In the Fe spectrum of fresh and recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, the two peaks at binding energy of 724.2 and 711.3 eV represented Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. After reaction, those two peaks exhibited similar intensity, implying that the structure of the magnetic composite was not changed after the recycle. The XRD patterns of the as- synthesized catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2 b. In low-angle XRD pattern, MCM-41 exhibited three clear diffraction peaks of (100), (110), and (200), which were assigned to the ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure [45]. With the Zr species was incorporated into MCM-41 and resulted in the blocking of the mesoporous structure, the intensity of the diffraction peak of (100) was diminished and (110), (200) nearly disappeared. Furthermore, the patterns of high-angle showed that ZrO2@MCM-41 was highly amorphous, demonstrating that Zr species was highly dispersed in catalyst surface. In contrast, the peaks at around 30.2°, 35.6°, 43.3°, 53.5°, 57.1° and 62.7° in Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 could be observed, which were assigned to (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) crystalline planes of Fe3O4, respectively. It conforms to the standard magnetite structure data [JCPDS Card No. 19-0629], indicating that Fe3O4 had been successfully introduced. The recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 displayed similar characteristic peaks to Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, implying that the structure of the magnetic composite did not changed after reaction. Therefore, the Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 catalyst can be separated easily from the reaction mixture by applying an external magnetic. TPD analysis was carried with NH3 and CO2 as an investigate molecule to determine the acid-base strength distribution and total acidity or alkalinity of the catalysts. The NH3-TPD profiles of different samples are shown in Fig. 2 c. Generally, for NH3-TPD analysis, three types of desorption peaks related to weak, moderate and strong acidic sites could be observed in the temperature range of 100–250 °C, 250–450 °C and 450–600 °C, respectively. All the samples (MCM-41, ZrO2@MCM-41, Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41) showed major desorption peak at the temperature range of 100–250 °C, no desorption peak was found at the temperature above 250 °C, which means that the three samples had weak acidic sites. Compare with MCM-41, the desorption peak of ZrO2@MCM-41 did not change significantly, the desorption peaks of MCM-41 and ZrO2@MCM-41 were observed at 107 °C and 104 °C, respectively. However, the acid amount increased from 0.57 to 1.56 mmol/g, suggesting that the introduction of weak acidic ZrO2 could provide more acid sites. Similar feature was observed for Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, the desorption peak appeared at 117 °C, and the acid amount decreased to 1.33 mmol/g. The slightly difference is likely due to the presence of basic sites in Fe3O4, which neutralized the acidic sites in ZrO2@MCM-41 and resulted the decrease in overall acidity. The overall basicity was investigated by CO2-TPD and desorption profiles are shown in Fig. 2 d. The basicity values (0.09–0.63 mmol/g) calculated from TPD desorption of the catalysts were lower than the corresponding acid site loadings. The patterns showed two desorption peaks in the range of 98–120 °C and 376–413 °C, which was related to weak and moderate basic sites, respectively. As can be seen that MCM-41 displayed weakly alkaline due to the presence of aluminum, and the weak base amount was 0.09 mmol/g, while weak and moderate basic sites increased to 0.19 and 0.08 mmol/g, respectively after ZrO2 introduced to MCM-41. The increase in weak and moderate basic sites is due to the presence of unsaturated zirconium species (-O-Zr-O-, acid and base sites). The basicity gradually increased to 0.24 and 0.64 mmol/g for Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41, suggesting that the introduction of Fe3O4 favored the presence of moderate basic sites. These results confirm that incorporated ZrO2 and Fe3O4 enhance the basicity of the support surface. To gain more insights into the distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of the catalysts, pyridine adsorbed FTIR spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) was further performed, the results are shown in Fig. 2 e. The bands at 1441 and 1617 cm−1 were due to the coordinated pyridine species with Lewis acid sites. While the bands at 1537 and 1660 cm−1 were assignable to Brønsted acid sites and the band at 1470 cm−1 was related to both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites. Bare MCM-41 had Lewis and Brønsted acid sites of 16.98 and 4.29 μmol/g respectively, suggesting that Lewis acid sites are the prime acidic species on the surface of MCM-41. Lewis acid sites concentration sharply increased from 16.98 to 29.94 μmol/g with incorporation of unsaturated zirconium species (-O-Zr-O-, acid and base sites), while Brønsted acid sites slightly increased from 4.29 to 6.35 μmol/g, illustrating the presence of high density of Lewis acid sites and low density of Brønsted acid sites in zirconium species. In addition, it can be found that the Lewis acid sites were remarkably increased to 36.60 μmol/g and the Brønsted acid sites decreased to 6.04 μmol/g with the incorporation of Fe3O4, and the ratio of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites increased from 4.71 to 6.06, this facilitates the CTH reaction. Furthermore, a slightly decrease of Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid sites was observed for the recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 due to the leaching of zirconium species. MPMS magnetic analysis of fresh and recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was carried out at room temperature, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 f. According to IUPAC classification, the isotherms of these two samples both presented type IV pattern with a H1 hysteresis loop, which was attributed to typical mesoporous material properties. [47–49] The saturation magnetization of fresh and recovered Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was 5.87 and 3.18 emu/g, respectively, such magnetization features can allow the magnetic composites to be recovered easily from liquid mixture by using a permanent magnet. Based on the above observation, the as-synthesized Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 exhibited an amorphous and mesoporous structure with multiple properties (Lewis and Brønsted acidities, and strong magnetism), have great potential as a monolithic multifunctional and magnetically-recoverable catalyst for the cascade reaction of FAL to GVL."
9,Catalytic conversion of FAL to GVL,"3.2 Catalytic conversion of FAL to GVL 3.2.1 Screening of the catalysts The tandem conversion of FAL into GVL was used to screen the catalytic activity of various solid catalyst in the presence of iso-propanol as the hydrogen donor. In this reaction, both Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites are crucial. [50] Lewis acidic sites are involved in two major conversion steps viz., conversion of FAL to FOL and AL to GVL. While the conversion of FOL to AL needs Brønsted acidic sites. Therefore, difference nature and type of acidity present in the catalysts will influence the FAL conversion and GVL yield, the results are summarized in Table 2 . The distribution of products determined by GC–MS analysis mainly includes FOL, isopropyl levulinate (IPL), 2-isopropoxymethylfuran (IPMF) and GVL. It can be observed that only 12.4% of FAL conversion with 3.8% of IPMF yield was observed with the catalysis of ZrO2 (entry 1, Table 2), implying that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction hardly took place when only ZrO2 was present. It was observed that a small amount of bio-product can be detected over bare MCM-41 due to the catalyst framework of MCM-41 contented a certain amount of mental Al and equipped with Lewis acidic sites, in consequence showed lower catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity (entry 2, Table 2). These results further indicate the Lewis acidic sites are active for catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction, which is consistent with the past reports. [51] As ZrO2 combined with MCM-41 to get ZrO2@MCM-41, an 85.2% FAL conversion with GVL yield of 65.4% was observed after 24 h (entry 3, Table 2), this is because that the ZrO2 mental sites in the catalyst facilitated the catalytic transfer hydrogenation rates of FAL to FOL and IPL to GVL. The Py-FTIR spectra profiles also revealed that ZrO2@MCM-41 exhibited both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites and the amount of Lewis acidic sites were increased with the embedding of ZrO2. In the case of ZrO2@SBA-15 (entry 4, Table 2) and ZrO2@ZSM-5 (entry 5, Table 2), only 23.9% and 5.6% yield of GVL was obtained due to their smaller surface areas than that of ZrO2@MCM-41 (Table 1). Based on this observation, the magnetic particle Fe3O4 was successfully embedded in MCM-41material to form Fe3O4@MCM-41 catalyst. Interestingly, relative higher GVL yield of (8.9%) was found over Fe3O4@MCM-41 (entry 7, Table 2) while the reaction can barely carry out over Fe3O4 (entry 6, Table 2), suggesting MCM-41 is a good acidic support. In the following step, Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was successfully prepared, and showed high activity for the conversion of FAL to GVL, an 80.8% yield of GVL with 99.3% conversion of FAL was found at 150 °C in 24 h (entry 8, Table 2). Comparing with ZrO2@MCM-41, the higher FAL conversion and GVL yield over Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 catalyst is might due to the high Lewis acidity sites and sufficient Brønsted acidity amount. Moreover, compared with Fe3O4/ZrO2@SBA-15 (entry 9, Table 2) and Fe3O4/ZrO2@ZSM-5 (entry 10, Table 2), Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 also had a proper mesoporous structure that might provide the large room for contact of FAL with zirconium and iso-propanol, leading to a superior performance, and so it was chosen as the appropriate catalyst for the subsequent experiments. It is well known CHT tandem reaction is closely related to alcohol types owing to them serves as an outstanding solvent and hydrogen donor. In general, secondary alcohol is an excellent hydrogen donor for catalytic transfer hydrogenation reaction thanks to it is very suitable to the dehydrogenation [52–53]. The conversion of FAL to GVL involves two CHT reaction steps and one esterification reaction step. Solvent will affect the rate of GVL formation. As shown in Table 2 (entries 8, 11–14), the secondary alcohols include iso-propanol and sec-butanol were more effective than primary alcohols toward the production of GVL and iso-propanol showed the best GVL yield than sec-butanol. Though primary alcohols like methanol and ethanol were also effective for the conversion of FAL, it had a negative impact on GVL production, which is in accordance with the previous finding [54]. This result can be explain in terms of the dehydrogenation nature of alcohols, secondary alcohols with high dehydrogenation nature showed more GVL yield [51–52,55]. Therefore, iso-propanol is the best hydrogen donor for the tandem conversion of FAL to produce GVL over Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction parameters As Zr-MCM@Fe3O4 catalyst showed high activity, it is used to evaluate various reaction parameters for this reaction. Firstly, the effect of Si/Zr molar ratio was carried and the results are presented in Fig. 3 a. The FAL conversion was up to 99.7% for all Si/Zr molar ratio. The GVL yield was up to 77.8% and did not change considerably when the Si/Zr molar ratio varied from 5 to 20, this is more likely due to the saturation loading of active sites. The higher Si/Zr molar ratio in catalyst means the less amount of ZrO2. Obviously, when the Si/Zr molar ratio was further increased from 20 to 100, the GVL yield decreased gradually from 77.8% to 57.8%. In addition, the amounts of other products in this reaction cannot be ignored, the yield of IPMF had no obvious change (<6%) when Si/Zr molar ratio ranged from 5 to 100. However, IPL yield increased with Si/Zr molar ratio increased from 20 to 100. This can be explained based on the catalyst characterizations. The presence of ZrO2 in Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 led to the generation of Lewis acidic sites as observed by Py-FTIR. The presence of moderate Lewis acidic sites might be responsible for high yield of IPL. Excess Lewis acidic sites are in favor of catalytic hydrogenation of IPL to GVL. Since GVL yield was relatively stable with Si/Zr molar ratio varied from 5 to 20 and take the energy consumption into consideration, the optimum Si/Zr molar ratio is 20. Under identical conditions, catalyst loading also plays a significant effect on the conversion of FAL to GVL, with increasing the catalyst loading, the availability of the vacant sites number is increased. As shown in Fig. 3 b, when the catalyst loading was 10 mg, the FAL conversion was 94.0% with GVL yield of 53.7%. With the catalyst loading further increased from 10 to 50 mg, FAL conversion reached about 99.0% with 81.4% of GVL yield. As the loading increased to 60 mg, FAL conversion was maintained, while the GVL yield was decreased slightly. The decrease in GVL yield was due to the excess amount of catalyst, which leads to the reaction mixture becoming thickened while H-donor is inadequate. At the same time, the increase of catalyst loading would result in the decrease of IPL, which decreased from 29.1% to 7.8%. Influence of the reaction temperature towards the conversion of FAL to GVL over Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was studied in the temperature range 130 °C to 160 °C and illustrated the results in Fig. 4 . The FAL conversion reached its maximum nearly 99% in 30 h at all reaction temperature. It was observed that the GVL yield at 130 °C in 30 h was low, while IPMF and IPL yield up to 37.8% and 43.3%, respectively. When the reaction temperature was elevated to 140 °C, the GVL yield was increased significantly. However, the IPL yield decreased sharply with the temperature increased from 130 °C to 140 °C. Further increased the temperature to 150 °C, the influence was much more evident. The best activity was achieved with 85.3% yield of GVL and 99.2% conversion of FAL under the condition of 150 °C in 30 h. The temperature was further increased to 160 °C, the GVL yield did not change considerably compared with that of 150 °C. Better activities were achieved at the higher temperature, product yield towards GVL increased with an increase in reaction temperature from 130 °C to 160 °C, confirming that high reaction temperature accelerated the reaction rate. Considering the evolution of the different product over the reaction time, a similar trend can be described for IPL and IPMF, their yields increased in the first 2 h, then decreased while GVL yield increased with prolong reaction time, which suggested that IPL and IPMF are intermediate for the conversion of FAL to GVL. In general, the alcoholysis of FOL with alcohol undergoes the formation of furfuryl ether, which further converts into final product. [56–57] Based on the product distribution and Py-FTIR, TPD studies, a plausible reaction mechanism for the cascade transformation of FAL into GVL was proposed (Scheme 1 ). In the first step, iso-propanol adsorbs on catalyst surface coordinated to the Lewis-acidic center of zirconium species to generate zirconium bound isopropoxide. The electron-rich oxygen on the carbonyl group of FAL coordinates with the electron deficient zirconium site on isopropoxide to form a six-membered ring transition state. The hydride of the isopropoxide bounds to zirconia is transferred from alkoxide to the carbonyl group on FAL. Then a carbonyl byproduct is released to yield FOL. In the second step, a Brønsted acidic proton from Si-(OH)-Si of MCM-41 framework attacks on the electrophilic ɑ-carbon in the protonation of FAL, so that FAL coordinates with iso-propanol, subsequently releases water and forms IPMF. Lewis acid site of zirconium also helps for this step, after coordinates with FAL to enhance its electrophilicity follows by attacking OH of iso-propanol to form IPMF Then IPMF is protonated by Brønsted acid and releases iso-propanol to form intermediate A. C1 of intermediate A is attacked by iso-propanol, then furan ring opening occurs with attaching of water molecule to form IPL. In final step, IPL undergoes CTH reaction to form 4-hydroxy pentanoic ester (4-HPE) with the catalysis of Lewis acidic site. This is followed by intramolecular lactonization with the release of iso-propanol to form intermediate B, which catalyzed by Brønsted acid site, it would further transformed to GVL via deprotonation. Based on the above reaction mechanism, to further investigate the catalytic conversion of FAL to IPMF, IPL, and GVL over Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 in the presence of iso-propanol, the kinetics at different temperatures were studied. The overall reaction process is simplified (Fig. 5 a). A simple power-law model/Arrhenius was selected for kinetic analysis. The amount of iso-propanol was in large excess. The catalytic conversion of FAL to IPMF, IPL, and GVL over Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was assumed to be a pseudo-first-order reaction, which can be expressed as follows: (5) d C FAL dt = - k 1 c FAL (6) d C IPMF dt = k 1 c FAL - k 2 c IPMF (7) d C IPL dt = k 2 c IPMF - k 3 c IPL (8) d C GVL dt = k 3 c IPL The experimental results (shown in Fig. 4) were then fitted to these equations. The obtained reaction rate constants of each step at various temperature are illustrated in Fig. 5 b. It found that the rate constant for IPL conversion to GVL was significantly lower than that for the transformation of FAL to IPMF and IPL under identical temperature, indicating that IPL-to-GVL represents a rate-limiting step during this cascade reaction. The apparent activation energy was calculated by Arrhenius law, as shown in Fig. 5 c. The apparent activation energies of E1 , E2 , and E3 were 35.0, 51.0, and 86.9 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating that FAL is easily converted to IPMF due to the lower activation energy (35.0 kJ/mol). It is difficult to get GVL from IPL via the lactonization due to the higher activation energy of 86.9 kJ/mol. 3.2.3 Reusability of the catalyst The facile separation and reusability are essential aspects for the heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, the recyclability of Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was evaluated by successive batches of FAL conversion under the optimization reaction conditions. In the reusability tests, the Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 was separated by an external magnet from reaction mixture after each run, washed with ethanol three times, dried at 80 °C for 4 h at nitrogen atmosphere, and then directly used for the next run. As seen in Fig. 6 a, the solid catalyst could be separated easily when a permanent magnet was placed near the reaction mixture. At the same time, the turbid solution was changed limpidity quickly. It also can be seen from Fig. 6 b that the catalyst recovery rate, which refers to the ratio of the weight of recovered catalyst to the amount of added catalyst, kept up to 95% after five consecutive reaction runs. Thus, magnetic Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41 is useful for the magnetic separation with a satisfactory magnetic responsive property, which in accordance with the magnetization curves (Fig. 2 f). By using this approach, Fig. 6 b includes the results in terms of yields to the identified products. As shown, the solid catalyst could be reused five runs with remaining about 95.0% of FAL conversion. Though a decline in GVL yield occurred as the catalyst was reused, a 75.2% of GVL yield was obtained in the fifth reaction run. According to XPS result, the reasons for the deactivation most likely due to active component of zirconium leached from the support (elemental composition results are shown in Table 3 ). The accumulation of carbonaceous substrates on the surface of catalysts also can be responsible for deactivation."
10,Conclusions,"The present work successfully developed a magnetically-recoverable monolithic multifunctional catalyst (Fe3O4/ZrO2@MCM-41) with tunable Lewis and Brønsted acidities for the one-pot cascade conversion of FAL to GVL that possesses powerful catalytic activity, high separation efficiency and good reusability. The incorporation of Fe3O4 could not only impart the catalyst with a strong magnetism, but also tune its acidity to promote GVL production. Selectivity towards GVL was found to be strongly dependent on the distribution of acid sites. A high yield of 85% was achieved from FAL conversion with iso-propanol as a hydrogen donor and solvent. The kinetic study revealed that IPL-to-GVL process represents a rate-limiting step during this cascade conversion based on its relatively low rate constant and high activation energy. The as-synthesized catalyst could be fully recovered by an external magnetic field and reused at least six times without substantial change in catalytic activity. This proposed strategy exposes some advantages over those available towards GVL production from FAL, such as the nonuse of noble-metal or dual catalysts and hazardous gaseous H2, fine catalyst recyclability with magnetic separation, and the implementation of a green and sustainable route."
