0,Introduction,"The boomingly global energy demands have led to a strong dependence on fossil fuels, which result in the enormous emission of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from various industrial processes in current society. The surged CO2 emission prominently caused the environmental problem of global warming and ocean acidification [1,2]. The development of efficient technology for the capture, utilization and transformation of CO2 to become carbon neutral is extremely desired [3–5]. The direct transformation of CO2 into liquid fuels and value-added chemicals has attracted much attention [6–12]. Olefins, in particular the linear α-olefins (LAOs; C ≥ 4), are high-valued feedstocks for the production of poly-olefins, lubricating oils, detergents, surfactants, cosmetics as well as drugs [13–15]. The hydrogenation of CO2 into olefins is proposed a sustainable approach by taking advantage of H2, which could be generated by renewable electricity from photovoltaic and wind power [11,16]. However, the hydrogenation of CO2 is more likely to form C1 products including CO, CH4, CH3OH and HCOOH, and the formation of C2+ (C ≥ 2) olefins by controllable C–C coupling is difficult. The development of highly efficient catalysts is highly attractive but challenging. To date, Fe-based catalysts and bifunctional catalysts consisting of metal oxides and zeolites are reported to be effective for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+ olefins. Compared to bifunctional catalysts [17–21], Fe-based catalysts showed high CO2 conversion, low CO selectivity and high space–time yield (STY) of C2+ olefins [22–35]. It is generally accepted that the hydrogenation of CO2 into olefins over Fe-based catalysts proceeds via two steps, i.e. RWGS (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, ΔH 298 = 41 kJ mol−1) and CO hydrogenation to olefins (FTO, CO + 2H2 → -(CH2)- + H2O, ΔH 298 = -166 kJ mol−1). However, sole Fe catalyst usually showed weak adsorption of CO2 and a low CO2/H2 ratio on the catalyst surface, which results in the successive hydrogenation to form CH4 rather than to C2+ products. Doping with various promoters has been explored to improve the selectivity of C2+ olefins over Fe-based catalysts. Alkali metal (e.g., Na, K) or non-metal element (e.g., N, S) was added to modify the reducibility of Fe catalyst and carbonization ability of Fe species to form active iron carbides, and thus improving the performances [36–47]. Besides, a second promoter, such as Zr [25], Mn [30–32] or Zn [27,34,35,39,42] was usually adopted to improve the dispersion of Fe species and promote the conversion of CO2. Although significant progress has been achieved for hydrogenation of CO2 into olefins, the performances are still unsatisfactory. Among the reported Fe-based catalysts, the selectivities of olefins and LAOs were mostly less than 75% and 50%, and the STYs of olefins and LAOs were lower than 0.6 and 0.4 g gcat −1 h−1, respectively (Table S1). For these catalysts, iron oxides and iron carbides are found and considered for the RWGS and FTO reactions, respectively. However, the phase transformation from iron oxides or metallic Fe to iron carbides and the synergistic matching between these different phases in one catalyst are uncontrollable, and thus significantly affects the activity and selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation. Very recently, we developed a hybrid ZnO-Na+-Fe5C2 catalyst, which composed of ZnO and Na+-Fe5C2 components and was efficient for CO2 hydrogenation to C2 =-C12 = [35]. We proposed that the ZnO works for RWGS reaction and the Na+-Fe5C2 catalyzes FTO reaction. Few reports also revealed that Na promoted Fe-Zn catalysts were beneficial to the synthesis of olefins by CO2 hydrogenation, exhibiting C2 =-C6 = [40] or heavier C5+ = [42] as the main products. However, the effects of Zn and Na promoters on catalyst structures and performances of CO2 hydrogenation remain ambiguous. For instance, the Zn promoter is usually considered as structure promoter, but it was proposed as an electronic promoter or the active phase in the form of ZnO for RWGS [27,35]. Furthermore, the studies on the synergistic effects of Zn and Na promoters were seldom in previous literatures. On the other hand, as compared to CO hydrogenation reaction, which behaved CO conversion as high as ∼ 90% [35,37], the CO2 conversions for CO2 hydrogenation were stilled limited to 40–45% over most of the reported Fe-based catalysts. In addition to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of CO2 molecule, the complicated catalytic system during CO2 hydrogenation would affect the activity, since the process produces abundant water via RWGS and FTO reactions. Recently, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the H2O, the main byproduct in RWGS and FTO steps, would cover and oxidize the active sites (i.e., Fe5C2) to iron oxides during the CO2 hydrogenation, and thus decreased the CO2 conversion [34]. To our best knowledge, the understanding on the effects of H2O on CO2 conversion have not been established. In the present paper, we report that Na and Zn promoted Fe catalysts fabricated by simple sol–gel method, show an outstanding performances for the production of value-added olefins from CO2 hydrogenation. By comparing to the performances and characterization results over Fe, Zn-Fe, Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts, we correlate the structure-performance relationship and explicitly reveal the effects of the Na and Zn promoters. It is demonstrated that the presence of Na and Zn additives benefits the carburization of Fe species to smaller active Fe5C2 particles, improves the CO2 adsorption, and suppresses the deep hydrogenation of olefins, which are crucial for the transformation of CO2 into olefins. Furthermore, for the first time, the effect of H2O on the catalytic performances is revealed, and it is proposed that the RWGS reaction is significantly affected by H2O, and thus restrains the total CO2 conversion. The present work offers the useful insight for rational design of efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to olefins."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation All the Fe catalysts were prepared by a simple sol–gel method. Typically, the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst was synthesized as follows. The Fe(NO3)3·9H2O of 12.5 mmol, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O of 12.0 mmol, NaNO3 of 0.15 mmol and citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O) of 25.0 mmol were first dissolved in 30 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring for 1 h at ambient temperature. Then the mixed solution was evaporated at 363 K under stirring for 3 h until a gel was obtained. The gel was further dried at 453 K for 5 h, and subsequently calcined in air at 673 K for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The sole Fe, Zn modified Fe and Na modified Fe catalysts were also prepared by the same procedures. Notably, the weight content of Na is 1.5 wt% for both Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts, whereas the Zn content is 25 wt% for the Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts."
3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization The crystalline phases of Fe-based catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) in the 2θ scanning range of 10-90°, and the XRD signals were recorded using the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) source (40 kV, 30 mA). Normally, the XRD patterns were collected using a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The elemental compositions of Fe catalysts were probed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy with the Panalytical Axois Petro XRF instrument using rhodium target (50 kV, 50 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was conducted on an UHV chamber equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source and a Sphere 2 analyzer. All the binding energies were calibrated by the adventitious C1s line at 284.6 eV. The Mössbauer spectrum measurements were performed on the ms-500 Mössbauer spectrometer (manufactured by Oxford) at 293 K, and the phase content is evaluated by integrating the corresponding absorption peak area. N2 physisorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer. The specific surface area (SSA) was evaluated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The samples were degassed at 573 K for 2 h before measurement. The particle size and morphology of the catalysts were characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI-Tecnai20). H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Typically, the samples were firstly purged by pure He at 673 K and then heated from 323 K to 1173 K in 5% H2-Ar atmosphere. CO2 and H2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD and H2-TPD) measurements were also performed on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Typically, the samples were firstly reduced with 5% H2-Ar gas flow at 673 K. Then, the adsorption of CO2 or H2 was performed at 323 K in 10% CO2-Ar or pure H2, and the TPD was performed in He gas flow by raising the temperature from 323 K to 1073 K."
4,Catalytic reaction,"2.3 Catalytic reaction Primarily, 100 mg samples (30–60 mesh) were diluted with 900 mg quartz sand and then loaded in a 10 mm inner diameter titanium tube for CO2 hydrogenation, which was carried out in a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor. Before the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was reduced at 673 K for 2 h in 5% H2-N2 (25 mL min−1). Typically, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction was performed at 613 K and 2.5 MPa, using a feed gas H2/CO2/Ar with molar ratio of 72/24/4 under the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000 mL gcat −1 h−1. Ar in the feed gas was used as an internal standard to calculate the CO2 conversion. All of the products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a carbon molecular sieve (TDX-01) packed column connected to thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2, Ar, CO, CH4 and CO2 analysis and two capillary columns (RT-Q-BOND-PLOT and PONA) connected to flame ionization detector (FID) for the quantitate of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. The liquid products were collected by a cold trap and analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, Thermo Trace1310-ISQ7000). The CO2 conversion and the product selectivity were calculated on a carbon balance, which were all better than 95%. The catalytic activity and product selectivity in the present study were obtained at around time on stream (TOS) of 10 h and the liquid products collected by cold trap were obtained at around time on stream TOS of 100 h. The C3H6 hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 613 K and 0.1 MPa with the feed gas C3H6/H2/He with molar ratio of 12/48/40 (25 mL min−1) over the used catalysts after 10 h reaction for CO2 hydrogenation."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterization of the Fe-based catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of the Fe-based catalysts 3.1.1 Textural property, structure and morphology The XRD was used to characterize the crystal phases of Fe, Zn-Fe, Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the calcined Fe and Na-Fe catalysts only exhibited the characteristic diffractions patterns attributed to Fe2O3 phase (JCPDS No. 33–0664), while the Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts gave mainly diffraction peaks assigned to ZnFe2O4 spinel phases (JCPDS No. 22–1012) in addition to the weak signals for ZnO (JCPDS No. 36–1451) phase. Compared to the Fe and Na-Fe catalysts, the Zn modification (i.e., Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe) broadens the diffraction patterns of Fe species. This observation indicates that the Zn decreases the particle size of Fe species. The sizes of ZnFe2O4 evaluated by the Scherrer equation over Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts were 15 and 12 nm, respectively, which were much smaller than the Fe2O3 sizes of ∼ 27 nm in the Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 1 ). After H2 reduction, It was found that Fe2O3 or ZnFe2O4 phase was reduced into Fe3O4 phase (JCPDS No. 19–0629), while ZnO phase was remained in the Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts (Fig. 1b). Similar to the calcined catalysts, the reduced Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe also broadens the diffraction peaks attributed to Fe3O4 phase. The Fe3O4 size in Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts evaluated by the Scherrer equation was ∼ 15 nm respectively, much smaller than those of ∼ 30 nm over the Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 1). These results indicate that the Zn promoter significantly decreases the size of Fe species over Fe catalysts. The morphology and particle size of the calcined Fe-based catalysts were further characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 2 , all catalysts present similar nanosphere morphology but distinct difference in particle size. In combination with the XRD results that the size of ZnO was larger than those of ZnFe2O4 over the Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts (Table 1), it is rational to infer that the relatively larger ZnO particles were in close contact with ZnFe2O4 particles in these two catalysts (Fig. 2b and 2d). The size distribution of Fe species was also analyzed by measuring more than 150 nanoparticles from the SEM images. Clearly, the Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts provided an average Fe species size of 12–14 nm, being significantly smaller than those of 25–26 nm over the Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Fig. 2), which are consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The decrease in the size of Fe species by the addition of Zn promoter indicates that Zn may work for a structure promoter to segregates the iron species by the formation of ZnFe2O4 phase [39,42]. Besides, we also found that the SSA of calcined Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts was around 72–76 m2 g−1, which are larger than those of 29–35 m2 g−1 for the sole Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 1). 3.1.2 Surface component The valence states of components in catalysts were investigated by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3 , the sole Fe catalyst delivered a Fe 2p3/2 peak at the binding energy of 710.6 eV and a satellite peak around 718.4 eV, being consistent with the standard Fe2O3 sample [37], which confirms the existence of the Fe species in a form of Fe3+ species. The addition of Zn into Fe catalyst did not bring any change in the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2, manifesting that Zn promoter has a negligible effect on the electronic property of Fe species. Compared to the Fe and Zn-Fe catalysts, the introduction of Na promoter led to a ∼ 0.8 eV shift toward lower binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 for the Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts. The decreased in binding energy suggests the charge transfer from Na ions to the vacant d orbits of Fe species [29,39]. Besides, XPS results also disclosed that the surface molar ratios of Zn/Fe on Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts were similar to those in the bulk, while the surface Na/Fe molar ratios on Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts were 2.5 ∼ 3 times higher than those in the bulk (Table S2). These results mean that the Na species are enriched on the surfaces of Na-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts. 3.1.3 Reduction behavior H2-TPR was applied to study the reduction behavior of Fe catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4 , three distinct H2 consumption peaks were observed for all fresh Fe catalysts, which reflects the stepwise reduction of Fe2O3 or ZnFe2O4 to α-Fe. For the sole Fe catalyst, the H2 consumption peak at 618 K is assigned to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, while those around 849 and 947 K are assigned to the sequential reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and further to α-Fe, respectively. For Zn-Fe catalyst, the stepwise reductions of ZnFe2O4 to Fe3O4, FeO, and to α-Fe occur at 679, 853 and 1063 K, respectively. These results indicate that Zn retards the reduction of Fe species likely owing to the interaction between Zn and Fe. The Na-Fe catalyst exhibits the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 at 738 K, Fe3O4 to FeO at 853 K, and FeO to α-Fe above 1173 K, suggesting that the introduction of Na promoter also restrains the reduction of Fe species [31,37,39,48]. Excluding the effect of particle size, it may be associated with the electron-rich state of Fe-O bond due to the charge transfer from Na ions to Fe species [39,49,50]. Compared to the Na-Fe catalyst, adding Zn into the Na-Fe shifts H2 consumption peak to low temperature. The related phase evolution was observed at 699 K for ZnFe2O4 to Fe3O4, 857 K for Fe3O4 to FeO, and 1053 K for FeO to α-Fe over Na-Zn-Fe catalyst, demonstrating that the addition of Zn into the Na-Fe catalyst significantly increases the reducibility of Fe species owing to the decrease in the size of Fe species (Table 1 and Fig. 2). 3.1.4 Chemisorption behavior The CO2 and H2 adsorption properties of the reduced Fe catalysts were investigated by CO2-TPD and H2-TPD, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 a and Table S3, sole Fe catalyst exhibited very weak CO2 desorption signals at 386 and 454 K, which are attributed to α and β peaks respectively [39]. The addition of Zn into Fe catalyst significantly strengthened these peaks. For Na-Fe catalyst, the amount of adsorbed CO2 at 426–517 K further increased, and a higher desorption temperature around 886 K (γ peak) corresponds to the desorption of CO2 interacting strongly with the surface basic sites appeared, which is due to the Na modification [39,49]. In comparison with the Na-Fe catalyst, the introducing of Zn to Na-Fe further increased the CO2 uptake in particular the strong CO2 chemisorption at γ peak, which may be related to the enhanced SSA and reduced particle size of Na-Zn-Fe catalyst. Therefore, it is speculated that the synergistic effects between Na and Zn promoters enhance the surface basicity and provide more adsorption sites, thus increases the CO2 uptake for the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst (Table S3). As shown in Fig. 5b, all H2-TPD profiles showed two different peaks of H2 desorption over Fe-based catalysts. The low-temperature desorption peak centered at 645–659 K is attributed to weak H2 adsorption on the catalyst surface [51,52], whereas the high-temperature peak centered at 773–826 K describes the dissociative H2 or subsurface H2 adsorption [53,54]. The intensity ratio (z) of the high-temperature peak to low-temperature peak was used to present the proportion of dissociated H2 (Table S4), which is reported to be beneficial for facilitating the CO2 hydrogenation to olefins [51]. It can be seen that the sole Fe catalyst offered two weak peaks at 656 and 781 K. The presence of Zn in Fe catalyst remarkably enhances the H2 adsorption amounts. Differently, the modification of Na in Fe catalyst shifted the high-temperature peak from 781 to 816 K and increased the z from 0.7 to 2.8, but almost untouched the total H2 desorption amount. The increased value of z is likely related to the Na2O species for H2 adsorption [49]. Compared to Na-Fe catalyst, the addition of Zn in Na-Fe significantly increased the amounts of weak and dissociative H2 adsorption but slightly affected the value of z (Table S4). Therefore, the Na and Zn significantly enhance the total H2 adsorption capacity in particular the dissociative H2 adsorption, which promotes the activity of CO2 hydrogenation."
7,Catalytic performances for CO2 hydrogenation,"3.2 Catalytic performances for CO2 hydrogenation 3.2.1 The catalytic performances of Fe, Na-Fe, Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts We first performed the thermodynamic calculation on CO2 hydrogenation. The thermodynamic analyses show that the RWGS reaction is thermodynamically feasible at higher temperatures because it is an endothermic process (Fig. S1a), and the CO2 equilibrium conversion for RWGS reaction increases with increasing the reaction temperature. It was calculated that the CO2 equilibrium conversion is ∼ 28% under the typical reaction conditions of H2/CO2 = 3, 2.5 MPa and 613 K (Fig. S1b). Moreover, the formation of olefins (in cases of ethylene and hexene respectively) from CO2 hydrogenation is exothermic, which is thermodynamically unfeasible at higher temperatures (Fig. S1a), and the CO2 equilibrium conversions significantly decrease with increasing in reaction temperatures (Fig. S1b). Under the reaction conditions of H2/CO2 = 3, 2.5 MPa and 613 K, the CO2 equilibrium conversions for the formation of ethylene and hexene are ∼ 60% and 76% respectively (Fig. S1b). A temperature higher than 700 K will decrease the CO2 equilibrium conversion to less than 50%. Hence, it should control the reaction temperature at a proper temperature for the synthesis of olefins from CO2 hydrogenation. We performed CO2 hydrogenation over Fe-based catalysts under the reaction conditions of 613 K, H2/CO2 = 3, 2.5 MPa and 15000 mL g−1 h−1. The catalytic performances and a typical GC–MS pattern of liquid products were shown in Table 2 and Fig. S2. It can be seen that the CO2 conversion was 18% with a low selectivity of C2 =-C12 = (5.9%) and LAOs (1.5%) over the sole Fe catalyst, in which CH4 is the main product with low olefins/paraffins (O/P) ratio of 0.13 and chain growth factor (α) of 0.52 (Table 2 and Fig. 6 ). The Zn modification on Fe catalyst (Zn-Fe) slightly enhanced the CO2 conversion to 23% and decreased the CO selectivity to 17% over Zn-Fe catalyst. However, the O/P ratio, α value, selectivities of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs were still low. The addition of Na to Fe catalyst (Na-Fe) increased the CO2 conversion from 18% to 31% and remarkably decreased the CH4 selectivity from 48% to 13%. A high O/P ratio of 9.9, α value of 0.66 and C2 =-C12 = selectivity of 79% with LAO selectivity of 44% (corresponding to 85% LAOs in C4+ = product) were obtained over the Na-Fe catalyst. These results indicate that the Na promoter not only prominently facilitates the CO2 conversion but also promotes the formation of olefins and carbon-chain growth. Furthermore, Na and Zn co-modified Fe catalyst (Na-Zn-Fe) exhibited the highest CO2 conversion of 39%, and lowest CO selectivity of 14% as compared to the other Fe catalysts. The C2 =-C12 = selectivity reached as high as 80% and the selectivity of LAOs was 46% (corresponding to 88% LAOs in C4+ = product). The O/P ratio of 9.8 and α value of 0.65 were obtained over the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst (Fig. 6). Thus, the addition of Zn further increases the activity for CO2 conversion, and the presence of Na keeps the high selectivity of olefins. The C3H6 hydrogenation results for the Na-free and Na modified Fe catalysts further reveal that the addition of Na to Fe catalysts remarkably suppresses the deep hydrogenation of olefins (Table S5) and thus enhances the selectivity of olefins. The STYs of olefins and LAOs were calculated to evaluate the catalytic behaviors of these Fe-based catalysts. The Na-Zn-Fe catalyst delivered the highest C2 =-C12 = STY of 0.61 g gcat −1 h−1 and LAO STY of 0.35 g gcat −1 h−1, being much higher than those for Fe, Na-Fe and Zn-Fe catalysts (Table 2). We found that Na-Zn-Fe catalyst could provide the further enhanced STYs of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs at the reaction condition of high GHSV. The selectivity of C2 =-C12 = was kept at 78% with LAOs selectivity of 44% (corresponding to 87% LAOs in C4+ = product) under the GHSV of 300000 mL g−1 h−1, and the STYs of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs significantly increased to 3.7 and 2.1 g gcat −1 h−1 (Table S1), respectively. Remarkably, such high STYs of C2+ olefins and LAOs have seldom been reported in CO2 hydrogenation reaction, being much higher than state-of-the art Fe-based catalysts (Table S1). Moreover, in order to compare the intrinsic activities of these catalysts, the CO2 conversions were controlled below 5% via further increasing the GHSV to 900000 mL g−1 h−1. The highest CO2 conversion rate of 21 × 10−3 mol molFe −1 s−1 and C2 =-C12 = formation rate of 8.8 × 10−3 mol molFe −1 s−1 were obtained over the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst, which were much higher than those for the Fe, Zn-Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 3 ). Correspondingly, an apparent activation energy (Ea ) for C2 =-C12 = formation measured under those reaction conditions of 523–643 K and GHSV of 300000 mL g−1 h−1 indicated that the Na-Zn-Fe presented the lowest Ea for C2 =-C12 = formation of 90 kJ mol−1, being lower than that of 124, 116 and 101 kJ mol−1 for the Fe, Zn-Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 3 and Fig. S3), respectively. These results suggest that Na and Zn co-modification gives the highest performance on CO2 hydrogenation to olefins. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction conditions on catalytic performances over the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst The Na-Zn-Fe catalyst was further investigated under different reaction conditions to improve the catalytic performances. The effect of reaction temperature was firstly studied, and the results were shown in Fig. 7 a. The CO2 conversion increased from 24% to 41% and the CO selectivity decreased from 21% to 14% with the increase in reaction temperature from 583 K to 623 K at the GHSV of 15000 mL g−1 h−1. For the product distribution in hydrocarbons, the formation of alkanes (in particular CH4) was significantly promoted and the C2 =-C4 = selectivity remained almost unchanged (∼43%), while the C5 =-C12 = selectivity decreased from 39% to 31% with the increase in reaction temperature (Fig. 7b). The corresponding O/P ratio decreased from 12 to 7.6 (Table S6), which indicates that higher temperature would promote the hydrogenation of olefins. The selectivities of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs were kept relatively stable (∼80% for C2 =-C12 = and 47% for LAOs) with an increase in temperature from 583 K to 613 K, then declined to 75% for C2 =-C12 = and 41% for LAOs with further increase in temperature to 623 K. Hence, the highest STYs of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs were attained at 613 K for CO2 hydrogenation (Table S6). The effect of H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic performances of Na-Zn-Fe catalyst was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 7c, increasing the ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 results in a significant increase in CO2 conversion from 21% to 42% and a sharp decrease in CO selectivity from 30% to 11%, while the selectivities of alkanes (in particular CH4) and C2 =-C4 = were slightly increased. Differently, the C5 =-C12 = selectivity and O/P significantly decreased from 41% to 32% and 11 to 8.2 with increasing H2/CO2 ratio, respectively (Fig. 7d and Table S7). As a result, the C2 =-C12 = selectivity decreased from 83% to 77% and the LAOs selectivity declined from 49% to 43% with increase in H2/CO2 ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 (Fig. 7d). The decrease in olefin selectivity would be caused by subsequent hydrogenation of olefins under high H2 atmosphere. It is obvious that the highest STYs of C2 =-C12 = and LAOs were obtained at the H2/CO2 ratio of 3 (Table S7). Moreover, the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst was very stable in CO2 hydrogenation; both the CO2 conversion (∼39%) and olefin selectivity (∼80%) remained unchanged with time on stream during 70 h reaction (Fig. S4)."
8,Characterization of the spent catalysts,"3.3 Characterization of the spent catalysts 3.3.1 Textural property, structure and morphology of spent catalysts The XRD, N2 physical adsorption, SEM and HR-TEM characterizations were performed to probe the structural and compositional characteristics of the Fe catalysts after CO2 hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Fig. 8 a and 9a, the Fe catalyst only exhibited Fe3O4 phase after reaction. In addition to Fe3O4 phase, the Fe5C2 (JCPDS No. 51–0997) was observed in the Na-Fe catalyst (Fig. 8a-b and 9b) and ZnO was detected in the Zn-Fe catalyst (Fig. 8a and 9c). These results indicate that the Na promoter obviously facilitates the generation of Fe5C2, which is reported to be the active species in CO hydrogenation to produce hydrocarbons [35,37,55]. For Na-Zn-Fe catalyst, in addition to ZnO, only Fe5C2 was observed (Fig. 8a-b and 9d), suggesting that the Na and Zn co-modification promotes the complete carbonization of Fe species into Fe5C2. Moreover, the Fe catalysts with Zn promoter exhibited broader diffraction peaks of Fe species (Fig. 8a-b), indicating that the presence of Zn can suppress the growth of Fe species during the CO2 hydrogenation. For instance, the spent Zn-Fe catalyst exhibited smaller Fe3O4 sizes of 27 nm than that of the spent Fe catalyst (∼40 nm), and the spent Na-Zn-Fe catalyst offered the smaller Fe5C2 sizes (24 nm) than that over the spent Na-Fe catalyst (34 nm) (Table 4 ). We found that the SSA for four catalysts all decreased after reaction, and the spent Zn-Fe and Na-Zn-Fe catalysts showed a higher SSA than the spent Fe and Na-Fe catalysts (Table 4). Besides, Fig. 8c-d denoted that the morphology of Fe5C2 is nano-spherical, which was also confirmed by HR-TEM image (Fig. S5). According to the results for the particle size distribution of Fe5C2 nanosphere in TEM images, the spent Na-Zn-Fe catalyst provided an average Fe5C2 size of 25 nm, which was smaller than that of the spent Na-Fe (35 nm) (Table 4 and Fig. 8c-d). Hence, we speculate that the synergistic effects of Na and Zn provide smaller crystallites, larger active surface areas, and higher CO2 uptake, which facilitates the complete carburization of iron species to iron carbides with a smaller particle size during the CO2 hydrogenation. 3.3.2 XPS results The XPS was used to investigate the surface species of Fe-based catalysts after reaction. As shown in Fig. 10 , the Fe and Zn-Fe catalysts delivered the Fe 2p3/2 peak at the binding energy of ∼ 710.1 eV with a satellite peak around 718.0 eV, while the Na-Fe catalyst exhibited the Fe 2p3/2 peak at 709.3 eV with a satellite peak around 717.5 eV. In comparison with the fresh Fe, Zn-Fe and Na-Fe catalysts, the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 all decreased to some extent after CO2 hydrogenation for these catalysts, which would be owing to the formation of Fe2+ species. This result was also confirmed by the existence of Fe3O4 in XRD patterns (Figs. 8 and 9). In addition to the Fe 2p3/2 peak at 709.3 eV (corresponding to Fe3O4 phase), a new peak at 705.5 eV associated with Fe5C2 was observed in the spent Na-Fe catalyst. This binding energy was much lower than that of 706.5 eV for the standard Fe5C2, suggesting the formation of electron-rich Fe5C2 species [37,39]. The Na-Zn-Fe catalysts mainly delivered the Fe 2p3/2 peak at binding energy of 705.5 eV with a satellite peak around 718.6 eV, which can be assigned to Fe5C2 species. In addition, a smaller peak at 709.3 eV for Fe3O4 species were also observed, indicating that a tiny amount of Fe5C2 was oxidized, which would happen during the sample transfer process in air before XPS measurement [56]. These results further confirmed that the Fe species mostly existed in the form of Fe5C2 over the spent Na-Zn-Fe catalyst. 3.3.3 Mössbauer spectroscopy The Mössbauer spectroscopy is a powerful tool to identify and quantify the Fe phases and their contents. The Mössbauer spectroscopies of the Fe-based catalysts after CO2 hydrogenation were collected and the results were shown in Fig. 11 and Table 5 . The sextets with isomer shift (IS) of 0.26–0.28 and 0.61–0.66 mm s−1 with hyperfine field strength (Hhf) of 478 ± 3 and 439 ± 2 kOe were assigned to the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites in Fe3O4, respectively [57,58]. In addition, other sextets with IS of 0.19–0.29 mm s−1, quadrupole splitting (QS) of 0.03–0.11 mm s−1, and Hhf of 184 ± 3, 218 ± 2, and 112 ± 2 kOe were attributed to the crystallographic sites in Fe5C2 phase [59–61]. A superparamagnetic (spm) doublet with the IS of 0.19–0.31 mm s−1 and the QS of 0.49–0.62 mm s−1 was responsible to the high-spin Fe(III) in an oxygen-rich coordination environment. Other doublets with the IS of 0.68–0.79 and the QS of 1.1–1.5 mm s−1 were ascribable to the high-spin Fe(II) in an oxygen-rich coordination environment [61,62], which may be due to the presence of some poorly crystallized iron oxide [63,64]. In addition to the low contents of Fe5C2 (less than5%), the Fe species were mainly in form of Fe3O4 over the spent Fe and Zn-Fe catalysts (Table 5). The presence of Fe5C2 is not in good agreement with the XRDS results, which would be likely due to the low amount of Fe5C2 being out of the instrument detection limitation or the weak crystalline. Differently, the Na-Fe catalyst was consisted of 39% Fe3O4 and 61% Fe5C2 after CO2 hydrogenation, while the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst gave the Fe5C2 content as high as 96% with Fe3O4 amount of 4% (Table 5). These results further confirm that the synergistic effects between Na and Zn additives contribute to the formation of active Fe5C2 species during the catalysis process."
9,Insight into the structure-performance relationship,"3.4 Insight into the structure-performance relationship Scheme 1 displays a rational structure-performance relationship based on the experimental and characterization results. The sole Fe catalyst shows the undesirable CO2 conversion and low C2 =-C12 = selectivity with low LAO content, which could be owing to the relatively weak adsorption of CO2 and H2. The incorporation of Zn in Fe catalyst increases the SSA by reducing the particle size, and thus enhances the total adsorption amounts of CO2 and H2, which is beneficial for improving the catalytic activity. On the other hand, the doping of Na into Fe catalyst results in the electron transformation from Na ions to Fe species and enhancement of Na content in the catalyst surface, which significantly enhances CO2 adsorption capacity and accelerates the formation of Fe5C2. Meanwhile, the enhanced CO2 adsorption can efficiently suppress the hydrogenation of olefins and thus leading to the improvement in the selectivity of C2 =-C12 = products with a high proportion of LAOs. More important, the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst exhibits the best performances in CO2 hydrogenation to olefins in comparison to the Fe, Na-Fe and Zn-Fe catalysts. In this catalyst, the synergistic effects of Na and Zn promoters not only increases the CO2 adsorption amount thereby promoting the complete transformation of Fe species into Fe5C2, but also enhances the amount of H2 adsorption in particular the dissociative H2 adsorption being favorable for the RWGS to produce CO and subsequent FTO to produce olefins. Besides, the presence of Zn in Na-Fe catalyst remarkably reduces the Fe5C2 size and exposes more active sites, which is beneficial for the FTO to consume CO and accelerates the conversion of CO2. Therefore, the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst gives a higher CO2 hydrogenation rate, C2 =-C12 = formation rate and lower Ea for CO2 hydrogenation to olefins in particular the LAOs."
10,The effect of H2O on CO2 hydrogenation reaction,"3.5 The effect of H2O on CO2 hydrogenation reaction As discussed above, the equilibrium conversions of CO2 calculated by thermodynamics could reach 65–70% under the reaction conditions of H2/CO2 = 3, 2.5 MPa and 613 K (Fig. S1). However, for our Na-Zn-Fe catalyst with a high Fe5C2 proportion, the CO2 conversions were limited at 40–45% even at high H2/CO2 or reaction temperature (Fig. 7). We also found that the CO2 conversions over most of the reported Fe-based catalysts were limited at 40–45% (Table S1). Very recently, it was observed that the H2O formed during CO2 hydrogenation, significantly affected the Fe phases, and thus decreased the CO2 conversion during the reaction [34]. For eliminating the influence of H2O, Guo et al. designed a multi-stage reactor to ex-situ remove the H2O and the CO2 conversion was noteworthy increased from 47% to 71% for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons [65]. However, the deep insight of the effect of H2O on the catalytic performances for CO2 hydrogenation is still unclear. We performed the CO2 hydrogenation reaction in the presence of H2O with different content over the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst. Fig. 12 a-b shows that a marked drop in CO2 conversion was observed from 39% to 20% and the CO selectivity decreased from 14% to 6.4%, but the hydrocarbon distribution kept almost unchanged with increasing the H2O content from 0 to 40%. This means that the introduction of H2O significantly decreases the activity of Na-Zn-Fe catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. We further investigated the effect of H2O content on CO hydrogenation performances. As shown in Fig. 12c-d, the CO conversion partly decreased from 94% to 84% and CO2 selectivity increased from 30% to 37%, while the hydrocarbon selectivity was kept stable under the conditions of H2O content increased from 0 to 40%. The above results indicated that the effect of H2O on catalytic performances of Na-Zn-Fe catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation is significant than that of CO hydrogenation. Consider that the hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins over the Fe-based catalysts is assumed to proceed via the RWGS reaction for CO2 to CO and the subsequent CO hydrogenation to olefins, it can infer that the RWGS reaction might be suppressed in the presence of H2O. Since ZnO works for RWGS during CO2 hydrogenation to olefins over the Na-Zn-Fe catalyst [35], we performed the RWGS reaction by co-feeding H2O over the sole ZnO catalyst. The results exhibited that the CO2 conversion significantly decreased from 10% to 2.0% (Fig. S6), which confirms the significant inhibiting effect of H2O on RWGS reaction. The RWGS reaction is a reversible reaction, hence the enhanced H2O content suppresses the RWGS reaction, leading to inhibiting the total conversion of CO2. Furthermore, we performed the CO2 and CO hydrogenations under different temperature in the presence of H2O. The results indicate that the inhibiting effect of H2O in CO2 conversion is more severely than that in CO conversion at each temperature (Fig. S7). Hence, we consider that the CO2 hydrogenation over the Fe-based catalysts is more sensitive to the H2O than CO hydrogenation, which limits the improvement of CO2 conversion by the inhibiting effect of H2O on the RWGS step. To date, how to improve CO2 conversion is still a challenge. Although the ex-situ removal of H2O could enhance the total CO2 conversion [65], the development of more efficient catalyst with the capacity of water-resistant for CO2 hydrogenation is more attractive. We speculate that the Fe based catalysts modified by hydrophobic components or groups to separation of H2O on catalyst surface may be a promising strategy."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, the Na and Zn promoted Fe catalysts are selective for the production of high-valued olefins by CO2 hydrogenation. Such catalysts offered CO2 conversion of 39% and C2+ olefin selectivity of 80% with LAO selectivity of 46%. The space–time yields of C2 =-C12 = olefins and LAOs attained at 3.7 and 2.1 g gcat −1 h−1 respectively, being significantly higher than those reported Fe based catalysts to date. We reveal that the incorporation of Zn into Fe catalyst significantly reduces the particle size of Fe species, and enhances the H2 adsorption capacity, and thus promotes the CO2 conversion. The co-modification by Na promoter obviously increases the CO2 adsorption, facilitates the formation of active Fe5C2 with higher content, which further increases the CO2 conversion. Moreover, the addition of Na inhibits the hydrogenation of olefins, and thus enhances the selectivity of target products. Furthermore, it is proposed that the H2O formed during CO2 hydrogenation significantly inhibits the RWGS step than that of FTO, and thus plays a significant role in the CO2 conversion. These insights offer useful guidance for the rational design of efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ olefins in particular the LAOs via tandem route."
