0,Introduction,"Global warming and the loss of fossil fuels have prompted significant research efforts in the development of materials for clean energy technologies and advanced energy devices such as fuel cells, solar cells, and batteries [1–4]. In the past decades, electrooxidation of organic compounds such as methanol [5], ethanol [6], urea [7], glucose [8], and glycerol [9] attracted the attention of researchers. To the development of fuel cells, the oxygen evolution reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are important and they have been considered by researchers [10,11]. Both the HER and the MOR are very important for the development of green-energy devices [12]. In the case of the HER, hydrogen is produced at a cathode. In the case of the MOR, in acidic media, methanol is oxidized at the anode of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) in the presence of water, giving protons, electrons, and CO2 according to the following reaction: (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 6 H + + 6 e − In alkaline media, methanol is oxidized to CO2 and H2O in a six-electron process. Intermediates such as CH2OH, CHOH, COH, and CO arise during the oxidation process. The general reaction is as follows: (2) CH 3 OH + + 6 OH − → CO 2 + 5 H 2 O + 6 e − Platinum and palladium are efficient catalysts for the HER [13], the MOR [14], the ethanol oxidation reaction [6], and the glycerol oxidation reaction [9,15], but their high price and scarcity prevent their application on large scales. Hence, efforts to develop inexpensive and active catalysts for practical applications are essential. On the other hand, cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic methanol oxidation with low-overpotential and high-activity are very important [16–19]. Recently, transition metal catalysts such as transition metal sulfides [20,21] and transition metal oxides [22,23] have been considered as electrocatalytic materials because of their excellent HER and MOR performance. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) based on Mo, Ni, and Co have been considered by researchers for the HER, the MOR, and solar energy to hydrogen conversion [24,25]. We also reported some TMC-based composites in previous work [5,16,26], and the results showed the excellent catalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts. MoS2 is a promising candidate for the HER and the MOR, but some properties should be improved. Doping of MoS2 with metal ions [11,27] and hybridization with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [28] have been performed to enhance its conductivity and edge sites for the HER. The layered graphene increases the conductivity of the catalyst and reduces charge transfer resistance, thus increasing the electrochemical activity of the catalyst as an anode and a cathode [29]. Also, MoS2 nanosheet–decorated polyaniline has been synthesized for the HER. It was found that polyaniline provides effective electron transport channels and increases the surface area of the catalyst [30]. In the current work, a dual TMC catalyst, MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles, was embedded in rGO for applications in hydrogen generation and DMFCs. The structure, composition, and morphology of the catalyst were characterized. Also, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronopotentiometry, and chronoamperometry for the HER and the MOR. The fuel cell performance of the catalyst was studied in a single DMFC. The results showed that the catalyst has excellent hydrogen evolution and methanol oxidation performance and electrocatalytic stability."
1,Experimental,
2,"Synthesis of MoS2, CoS2, and MoS2/CoS2/rGO","2.1 Synthesis of MoS2, CoS2, and MoS2/CoS2/rGO Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized according to a modified Hummers' method [31] The GO was dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonication for 45 min to produce a stable suspension. A mixture of 10 mL of 25% ammonia solution and 10 mL hydrazine hydrate (50% w/w) was added to the GO suspension (1 mg/mL). The solution was stirred during reflux at 85 °C for 1 h to obtain rGO. Then, rGO was filtered, washed, and dried at 60 °C in an oven. Pure MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles were synthesized as follows: 10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2 mmol (NH4)6·Mo7O24, and 15 mmol thioacetamide (C2H5NS) were added to 30 mL deionized water with ultrasonication. Then 3 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was slowly added to the aforementioned solution with stirring for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and the reaction continued at 160 °C for 16 h in an oven. The violet-pink product was washed and purified by centrifugation and redispersion in distilled water followed by dispersion in ethanol. The product was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and then calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in air to obtain MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles. MoS2/CoS2/rGO was synthesized as follows: 100 mg GO was added to a mixture of deionized water and ethylene glycol (1:1) with ultrasonication. Then 3 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone was slowly added to the aforementioned solution with stirring for 1 h. Next, 10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2 mmol (NH4)6·Mo7O24, and 15 mmol C2H5NS were added, and stirring continued for 2 h. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and the reaction continued at 160 °C for 16 h in an oven. The violet-pink product was washed and purified by centrifugation and redispersion in distilled water followed by dispersion in ethanol. The product was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and then calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in air to obtain spinel MoS2/CoS2/rGO."
3,Apparatus,2.2 Apparatus X-ray diffraction (XRD) of samples was performed with a Philips PW1800 instrument at room temperature to investigate the structure and composition of the samples. A Raman spectrometer was used to observe the low-frequency modes in the samples. The morphology and dispersion of the samples were assessed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; TESCAN MIRA3-XMU) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted with a Philips CM30 transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) was used to investigate the chemistry of the catalyst surface.
4,Electrochemical investigations and single-cell performance,"2.3 Electrochemical investigations and single-cell performance To investigate the methanol oxidation process, 0.02 g of catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of Nafion solution (5%), isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water in a ratio of 1:1:3. Then 10 μL of suspension was placed on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and then dried at room temperature. CV, LSV, and chronopotentiometry were performed to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the catalyst for methanol oxidation in alkaline medium with a three-electrode system including Ag/AgCl, Pt wire, and catalyst/GCE in a potentiostat/galvanostat (OrigaFlex 500, OrigaLys ElectroChem). An Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat was used for EIS. In HER investigations, the GCE was modified with Pt/C (20 wt%) similarly to the as-prepared catalyst for comparison. The electrocatalyst performance in the single cell was evaluated with a membrane electrode assembly based on a Nafion 117 membrane. Catalyst (20 mg) was mixed with Nafion binder solution, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water to prepare anode catalyst ink. Carbon cloth was coated with catalyst ink to provide a catalyst loading of 4 mg cm−2. The cathode catalyst was obtained by the same method by the painting of Pt/C on carbon cloth to give a Pt loading of 2 mg cm−2. The Nafion membrane was hot pressed between two electrodes at 125 °C and 9 MPa for 90 s to obtain a membrane electrode assembly. The DMFC test was performed at 60 °C at an optimum methanol concentration (0.5 M) in alkaline medium. Methanol was supplied to the anode at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1 and the flow rate of oxygen gas was 200 mL min−1."
5,Results,
6,Characterization,"3.1 Characterization The XRD patterns of rGO, MoS2/CoS2, and MoS2/CoS2/rGO are shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks at 2θ of 27.9°, 32.4°, 36.4°, 40.0°, 46.4°, 54.8°, 57.8°, 60.5°, and 63.0° correspond to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (222), (023), and (321) planes, respectively, of pyrite-phase CoS2 (JCPDS card no. 01-089-3056) [32]. The weak peaks at 32.5° and 57.5° are attributed to low-crystallinity MoS2 [33]. A broad peak for rGO was found at 2θ of 25°. All peaks were observed in the pattern of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst. The average crystallite size of MoS2/CoS2/rGO was calculated with the Debye-Scherer equation [34], and it was found to be 50 nm. The Raman spectra of rGO, MoS2/CoS2, and MoS2/CoS2/rGO are shown in Fig. 2 . Two broad peaks at about 1330 cm−1 (D band) and 1583 cm−1 (G band) were found for both rGO and MoS2/CoS2/rGO. The vibrational modes correspond to the sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (E2g) and the defects and disorders in the hexagonal graphitic carbon layers [33,35]. The peaks observed at around 373 and 404 cm−1 in the spectra of MoS2/CoS2/rGO and MoS2/CoS2 were assigned to the in-plane E1 2g vibrational mode and the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of MoS2/CoS2, respectively [33,36]. These peaks are associated with the vibrations of Co–S and Mo–S bonds. XPS measurements were used to determine the elemental composition and bonding energies of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO composite. The XPS scan and high-resolution spectra related to Mo 3d, S 2p, and Co 2p of MoS2/CoS2/rGO are shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3b, the two peaks at binding energies of 228.84 and 231.97 eV correspond, respectively, to the peaks of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo4+ in MoS2. Furthermore, the two peaks at 232.88 and 236.01 eV correspond to oxidation of Mo4+ to Mo6+ in air [32]. In Fig. 3c, the peaks at 161.63 and 162.81 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, and the peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, which are observed at 162.75 and 163.92 eV, indicate the presence of S2− and S2 2− species in the edge sites of the catalyst. Peaks at 779.0, 778.0, 780.5, 781.9, and 787.3 eV were observed in the Co 2p region (Fig. 3d) and correspond to Co in the CoMoS phase, Co2+, and cobalt salts, respectively [32]. The Mo/Co atomic content ratio in CoS2/MoS2/rGO was calculated from the area of the corresponding XPS peaks and was 1.3:1, which is consistent with the precursor ratio of Mo to Co (1.4:1). FESEM and TEM were performed to investigate the size and morphology of the nanoparticles. FESEM and TEM images of MoS2/CoS2 are shown in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. The porous morphology can be seen. FESEM and TEM images of MoS2/CoS2/rGO are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The size of the MoS2/CoS2 nanoparticles was about 80 nm, and they were homogenously arranged on the surface of rGO. A FESEM micrograph of rGO nanosheets is shown in Fig. 4e. Plate morphology and very low thickness of rGO were observed. Furthermore, the uniform distribution of Mo, Co, and S on the rGO surface was proved by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping, as shown in Fig. 4f."
7,Electrochemical performance of the catalyst for the MOR,"3.2 Electrochemical performance of the catalyst for the MOR The electrochemical performance and stability of the catalyst were investigated in the absence and in the presence of methanol. All multicycle tests were performed in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The multicycle voltammogram of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO electrode in the absence of methanol was obtained to see whether there is a catalyst oxidation peak, and the bare electrode was tested for comparison, as shown in Fig. 5 a and b. It is clear that both the bare electrode and the MoS2/CoS2/rGO electrode did not show any oxidation peak in the absence of methanol, but the capacitive current density increased for both electrodes with the increasing number of cycles. Also, multicycle voltammograms (10 cycles) of MoS2/CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2/rGO electrodes in the presence of 0.3 M methanol were obtained, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. With the increase of the number of cycles, the catalyst sites are activated and thus the anodic current density increased and reached 59 μA cm−2 for MoS2/CoS2 and 2.1 mA cm−2 for MoS2/CoS2/rGO. However, after the ninth cycle, it was almost constant because of the saturation of electrocatalytic active sites. Generally, in the forward scan methanol is oxidized to carbonaceous species. CO is one of the intermediate species that poisons the catalyst surface. Oxidation of CO to CO2 can occur in the anodic peak in the forward scan (I f) or in the anodic peak in the reverse scan (I b) [37]. In other words, the accumulated carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface are oxidized in the backward scan. Therefore, CO tolerance of the catalyst can be determined by I f/I b. Higher I f/I b corresponds to high catalyst tolerance to CO and oxidation of methanol in the forward scan. In the case of MoS2/CoS2/rGO, no anodic peak was observed in the reverse scan, which indicates high tolerance of the catalyst to CO. The reduction peak in methanol oxidation may be attributed to the reduction of CO2 to carbonaceous materials [37,38]. The stability of the CoS2/MoS2/rGO catalyst was tested by chronoamperometry in 0.3 M methanol at 0.3 V for 2000 s. An initial decline in current density occurred, but then it was constant. This decline is attributed to the carbonaceous intermediate species [39]. CV curves of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst were obtained in 1 M KOH in the presence of different methanol concentrations (0.05–0.7 M) with a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 6 a, with increasing methanol concentration from 0.05 to 0.3 M, the peak current density increased from 0.4 to 0.9 mA cm−2. However, for concentrations above 0.3 M, the current density did not exhibit an increasing trend, and for 0.7 M the current density reached 0.6 mA cm−2. This phenomenon is due to by-products caused by methanol oxidation after a critical concentration that restrict charge transfer. So, the methanol concentration was optimized as 0.3 M. CV curves of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst in 1 M KOH and the optimum methanol concentration (0.3 M) at different scan rates (10–100 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. 6b. With increasing scan rate, the anodic current density increased, and it reached 1.7 mA cm−2 for a scan rate of 60 mV s−1. For scan rates above 60 mV s−1, the current density slightly decreased, which is attributed to the inadequate time for the oxidation of some active compounds. Thus, the best scan rate was 60 mV s−1. To validate the optimum methanol concentration, voltammograms of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst were obtained in different methanol concentrations with a sweep rate of 60 mV s−1 (Fig. 6c). The highest anodic peaks were found in 0.3 M methanol, which confirms the selected optimum concentration. The effect of temperature on the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst was investigated. For this purpose, LSV was performed in the temperature range from 290 to 310 K in 0.3 M methanol. As shown in Fig. 6d, the oxidation current density increased from 1.68 to 2.71 mA cm−2 with the increase of temperature from 290 to 310 K. The linear relationship between oxidation current density and temperature is shown in Fig. 6e. These results are mainly due to the reduction of charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrolyte and catalyst with increasing temperature [40]. In other words, the charge transfer rate increases as the temperature rises. The activation energy was determined from the Arrhenius plot (ln I p versus inverse temperature, 1/T), as shown in Fig. 6f. From the linear relationship, the activation energy for methanol oxidation in the temperature range from 290 to 310 K is 17.1 kJ mol−1. Similar results have been reported in the literature [41,42]. The performance of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst in the optimum concentration of methanol (0.3 M) was examined in a single DMFC. The polarization curve is shown in Fig. 7 . As can be seen, a maximum power density of about 19 mW cm−2 and a current density of 118 mA cm−2 (at 0.12 V) were obtained for a single cell based on the MoS2/CoS2/rGO anode catalyst. Although these values are smaller than those reported for commercial Pt-Ru/C (maximum power density of 39.22 mW cm−2 and current density of 196.1 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V) [43], our research shows the potential of the as-prepared hybrid catalyst for use in DMFCs."
8,Electrochemical performance of MoS2/CoS2/rGO for the HER,"3.3 Electrochemical performance of MoS2/CoS2/rGO for the HER The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts deposited on a GCE toward the HER was investigated in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by LSV. LSV was performed at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1 and calibrated versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. LSV curves of MoS2/CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2/rGO and the related Tafel plots are shown in Fig. 8 a and b, together with the LSV curve and related Tafel plot for Pt/C for comparison. The Tafel slope and onset overpotential of the samples were compared. The onset overpotential in a cathodic reaction is the highest potential at which a reaction product is formed, and it is critical for the evaluation of HER catalytic activity. In other words, the onset potential is the potential where the current starts increasing. MoS2/CoS2/rGO had a lower onset overpotential of 90 mV compared with MoS2/CoS2 (160 mV) because of the positive effect of rGO on MoS2/CoS2 dispersion and conductivity of rGO. This value is comparable to the Pt/C overpotential. The Tafel slopes were obtained from the linear portions of the LSV curves with the Tafel equation. The Tafel slope decreased from 86 to 48 mV dec−1 with the addition of rGO to MoS2/CoS2. The HER proceeds through the reduction of protons through a reduction half-reaction. The general and three-step reactions in acidic media are as follows: (3) 2 H + ( aq ) + 2 e − → H 2 ( g ) ( general ), (4) H 3 O + + e − → H ads + H 2 O ( Volmer ), (5) H ads + H 3 O + + e − → H 2 + H 2 O ( Heyrovsky ), (6) H ads + H ads → H 2 ( Tafel ). According to the preceding reactions, the HER can follow the Volmer-Heyrovsky or the Volmer-Tafel recombination pathway. These reactions depend on the inherent surface chemistry and the electronic structure of the catalyst [44]. The performance of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst is beyond that of the previously reported catalysts, or it is comparable with that of others as shown in Table 1 . Long-term stability is an essential characteristic of a catalyst. Cyclic stability of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst in the first cycle and the 2000th cycle is shown in Fig. 8c. The polarization curve showed a slight drop in current density in the 2000th cycle compared with the first cycle. This indicates the excellent stability of the MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalyst. Furthermore, the time-dependent potential curve was examined at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 2500 s (Fig. 8d). As can be seen, at first the potential slightly declined but then became stable. The excellent stability together with superior catalytic activity ensures MoS2/CoS2/rGO is a promising candidate for electrochemical hydrogen generation. Chronopotentiometry was used to measure the amount of hydrogen evolved from the MoS2/CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalysts in acidic medium. This test was performed for 2500 s at a constant current of 10 mA cm−2. An inverted burette was used to collect gas during the electrochemical process. The chronopotentiometry curve and volume of hydrogen produced by the catalysts are shown in Fig. 8d and the inset in Fig. 8d. The volume of evolved hydrogen obtained was about 1.5 mL for MoS2/CoS2 and about 4.3 mL for MoS2/CoS2/rGO. These results are consistent with the LSV curves. The presence of rGO, which increases the electrical conductivity of the catalyst, and the synergistic effect between Mo4+ and Co3+ ions are reasons for the higher electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2/CoS2/rGO. The electrochemical surface area of the MoS2/CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalysts was investigated by use of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C DL) in a nonfaradic current region according to the literature [50]. The capacitive current density (J C) was measured at different scan rates. J C was plotted versus the scan rate, and C DL was obtained from half of the slope (Fig. 8e). The calculated C DL for MoS2/CoS2/rGO was 33.6 mF cm−2, which is higher than for MoS2/CoS2 (19.5 mF cm−2). The electrical conductivity of rGO and good dispersion of MoS2/CoS2 are reasons for this increase. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic properties of the MoS2/CoS2 and MoS2/CoS2/rGO catalysts were investigated by EIS. From Fig. 8f, it is observed that MoS2/CoS2/rGO has the smaller semicircle and thus lower charge transfer resistance (R CT). R CT was 43 Ω for MoS2/CoS2 and 24 Ω for MoS2/CoS2/rGO. A smaller R CT suggests faster electron transfer during electrochemical reactions. Therefore, the results of EIS analysis are in agreement with the HER performance."
9,Conclusion,"We propose dual TMC nanoparticles as the catalyst, MoS2/CoS2, and its hybrid with rGO (MoS2/CoS2/rGO) for both methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution. MoS2/CoS2/rGO exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the MOR and the HER, which is generally ascribed to the active edge sites of MoS2/CoS2, the synergic effect of Mo4+ and Co4+ ions, and the conductivity and structure of rGO, which facilitates the charge transfer. Also, MoS2/CoS2/rGO exhibited a maximum power density of 19 mW cm−2 at 60 °C. Hence, MoS2/CoS2/rGO could have the potential for application in DMFCs and the HER."
