0,Introduction,"Low-level carbon monoxide (CO) concentration (ppm level) is one of the most common impurities in hydrogen (H2) fuel streams extracted from thermo-chemical processes such as reforming of methane, coal and heavy hydrocarbons and alcohols (Holladay et al., 2009; Kawamura et al., 2008; Mattos et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2007). Other sources of hydrogen production include electrolysis and biological processes (Ardao and Zeng, 2013; Bičáková and Straka, 2012; Dinh Nguyen et al., 2012; Faraj et al., 2012; Kothari et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2012; Wan and Yang, 2012). Even low CO concentration can cause significant performance degradation of H2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (Alcaide et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2007; Ehteshami and Chan, 2011). The on-board removal of CO from H2 stream is a challenge due to the fact that it requires a low process temperature and a fast removal rate. The conventional technologies have serious limitations for the removal of CO for on-site/board applications (Huang et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Kimura et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). Water-gas shift reaction, CO methanation and preferential oxidation are run at high temperatures (>150°C), the multi-step combined processes cause the entire gas clean-up system to be inefficient, expensive to maintain and bulky. In addition, CO removal to the level that is acceptable by PEM fuel cells is not possible using these methods. On the other hand, high-temperature fuel cell operation (120–200°C) (Asensio et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006), oxygen/air bleeding (Baschuk and Li, 2003; Zamel and Li, 2008) and using more CO tolerant electro-catalysts (Antolini, 2007; Beard et al., 2007; Casado-Rivera et al., 2004; Götz and Wendt, 1998; Igarashi et al., 2001; Koper, 2004; Lin et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2010; Maillard et al., 2005; Yousfi-Steiner et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) are approaches which can be used on the fuel cell itself but none of them can eliminate the effect of CO completely. Furthermore, high-temperature and oxygen/air bleeding need gas heaters and on-site/board oxygen tank, respectively, which make the whole system rather complicated and hazardous. In this research, a PEM reactor, which serves as an adsorber, is used to produce hydrogen with low CO concentrations suitable for PEM fuel cell applications. This is accomplished through the physico-chemical adsorption of impurities present in the hydrogen stream, such as CO, on metallic electro-catalysts deposited on a carbon structure at a temperature less than 80°C and atmospheric pressure. The feedstock flows through the gas flow field and the impurities are adsorbed onto the catalyst nanoparticles. A wide range of metallic nanoparticles, such as, Pt, Ru, Co, Ni, Cu and their alloys supported on carbons, can be used as to provide significant adsorption sites. Different approaches may be taken to regenerate the catalyst surface saturated with CO adsorption. While heat can be applied to the adsorber to remove the CO in the regeneration step, an innovative approach adopted here is by electrolysis which removes the adsorbed impurities by means of electrochemical method (Ehteshami et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2006). In this approach, a potential is applied to the two sides of the PEM reactor conductive end plates converting the PEM reactor to an electrolyzer. Experimental and theoretical studies proving the merit of this approach indicate that removing CO by electricity is more efficient than by heat which leads to high energy efficiencies (>80%) as extra hydrogen is produced in the process (Ehteshami et al., 2012). Low operating temperature and pressure are the most important advantages of the electrochemical approach for CO removal. These features are in big contrast with those of the existing technologies. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to enable a portable H2 powered application such as a fuel cell vehicle. The flow field of a PEMFC plays two important roles which are the current collection and the reactant distribution. Flow fields channel the fuel and oxidant, as well as the produced water to and from the cell. In order to minimize the concentration losses, the flow fields should be designed in a way that the reactants are evenly distributed over the surface of the electrode and the products are effectively removed from the cell. Therefore, the optimized geometry design of the PEM fuel cell flow field ensures the effective mass transport and efficient water management. The issue of water flooding in PEM fuel cells is more serious in the gas diffusion layer of cathode side under ribs (Sahraoui et al., in press). A large number of studies have been devoted to investigate the effect of flow field design on the gas transport and water management of PEM fuel cells with an attempt to enhance the reactants distribution and water removal (Manso et al., 2012; Wang and Wang, 2012). For instance, new flow fields have been designed where the convection is enhanced in the gas diffusion layer facilitating the water removal and mass transport (Xu and Zhao, 2007). Another requirement of flow fields is the minimized pressure drop to decrease the parasitic losses of the system. Unfavorable pressure drop causes non-uniformity in the production of water, heat, and current within the cell and more severe issues such as flooding, thermal and mechanical stresses and fatigue which are the main reason for most of the degradation problems. Similar to PEM fuel cells (Diep et al., 2007; Ding et al., in press), the performance of a PEM reactor is strongly influenced by the flow field. A flow field plays a significant role in channeling the feedstock gas through the reactor. It should be designed in a way that the residence time of the gas in the reactor is increased so that the exposure of the gas molecules to the catalyst surface is prolonged. In addition, the design should minimize the dead volumes and pressure drop. Watkins and Dircks (1992) proposed multi-serpentine flow field by which the pressure drop and consequently the parasitic power required to pressurize the air would be minimized. Interdigitated flow field consists of dead-ended flow paths built on bipolar plates through which the flow is forced to pass through the porous gas diffusion layer which develops the convection flow towards the anode and cathode catalyst layers. However, there is a large pressure drop for the gas flows. This flow field is attractive from this point of view that the catalyst particles are completely exposed to the reactants through the forced convection flow through the electrodes. The properties of the gas diffusion layer affect the performance of the catalyst layer and generally the electrode (Cindrella et al., 2009; El-Kharouf et al., 2012). They are porous media which facilitate the uniform distribution of the gases allowing diffusion of reactants to reach to the catalyst sites and providing a better utilization of the electrode area. The pore size range and pore size distribution of the gas diffusion layer would affect the gas diffusion and electron conductivity. Big pore sizes enhance the gas diffusion but at the same time reduce the electrical conductivity. Similarly, in the PEM reactor application, it is desired to use a gas diffusion layer which facilitates the contact between the gas and the catalyst nanoparticles. The catalyst loading is another factor which affects the electrode performance. Higher catalyst loading increases the vacant sites on the surface increasing the probability of the contact between the catalyst surface and gas molecules. However, increasing the catalyst loading may not necessarily increase the catalytic performance as it can influence the porosity of the electrode. The objective of this research is to determine the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions of the PEM reactor through a parametric study investigating the effect of different operating and geometric parameters such as the gas flow field geometry, gas diffusion layer porosity and thickness, and catalysts and catalysts support type and loading on the adsorption capacity of the adsorber. The performance of the adsorber is evaluated by analyzing the CO concentration at the outlet of the adsorber. The time during which the adsorber can produce hydrogen with no more than 10ppm CO content is termed as breakthrough time in this study. Four different flow fields (straight, multi-serpentine, pin-type and interdigitated flow fields), are investigated. The breakthrough curves of adsorbers with different flow fields are measured and the corresponding residence time distribution (RTD) functions are calculated (Krewer et al., 2004; Martin, 2000; Nauman, 2008). RTD analysis of a reactor presents the probability distribution function describing the time a fluid molecule or element spends inside the reactor. The residence time distribution is defined as an exit age distribution, E(t). The function E(t) is calculated such that ∫ 0 ∞ E ( t ) d t = 1 . The RTD analysis is the key to identify dead volumes in the flow field and clarify the diffusional limitations in the gas diffusion media under the channel ribs. Low pressure drops is one of the most main criteria of a well designed flow field. High pressure drop necessitates higher pumping power increasing the parasitic losses and reducing the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, it may lead to membrane dehydration and pinhole, significant leakage flow and damage in the reactor structure due to the mechanical stresses. Therefore, it is essential to consider pressure drop of the different flow fields in this study in order to make a more realistic judgment on the performance of the flow fields. Furthermore, gas diffusion fields with porosities of 0.55, 0.74 and 0.78 and single metal catalyst Pt and alloyed PtRu supported onto two different supports including carbon black and activated carbon with metal loadings are investigated. The rationale of studying alloyed PtRu catalyst is to investigate the effect of using alloyed Pt on the CO removal capacity of the adsorber. This motivates the development of non-Pt catalysts for CO removal from hydrogen rich gas stream. Catalyst loadings of 0.5, 1 and 2mgcm−2 are investigated. The obtained results provide guidelines for the design of reactors with optimized performance."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs),"2.1 Bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) Four types of flow field geometries are used in the experiments namely pin-type, straight, multi-serpentine and interdigitated flow fields, which are shown in Fig. 1. The 4-path serpentine has been used in order to reduce the machining time. Straight (parallel) and pin-type channels are ideal for the low-pressure drop design with the consequence of reducing the gases blower power and therefore parasitic losses. The bipolar plates design specifications and the MEA to bipolar plate contact area ratio are shown in Table 1. The bipolar plates are made of graphite with 2.5mm thickness, and channels are milled with a computer numerically controlled machine. Fig. 2 shows a simplified schematic of the PEM reactor used, in which the bipolar plates are inserted into the windows fabricated in two metallic end plates. The end plates are designed and fabricated in a way that different flow fields can be used conveniently. Silicon glue is used as the sealant material. As the experiments are carried out at room temperature, no heating systems are required. The MEAs are fabricated in-house by an automatic spraying machine used to deposit the catalyst nanoparticles onto the carbon paper and a hot press machine to assemble the electrodes and the proton conductive membrane. Three types of carbon papers have been used in this research to study the effect of porosity on the adsorber performance. The carbon papers specifications are summarized in Table 2. Toray and Ballard carbon papers are used as received while the third gas diffusion layer is modified by coating of the gas diffusion layer with a mesophase pitch carbon onto the Ballard carbon paper with the objective of investigating the effect of the gas diffusion layer porosity over a wider range. In this research, a pitch-based carbon layer is coated onto the Ballard carbon paper. This modification decreases the porosity of the gas diffusion layer while it improves the conductivity. The Toray carbon paper is coated by a mesophase pitch carbon solution prepared by dissolving required amount of mesophase pitch carbon in aqueous toluene. The prepared solution is coated onto the carbon paper and after that the coated gas diffusion layer is dried at 80°C followed by carbonization at 1300°C in nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 3 shows the SEM graphs of the bare carbon papers and carbon papers deposited with Pt nanoparticles. To study the effect of using alloyed Pt on the CO removal capacity of the adsorber, Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts are used. This study could motivate investigations for development of non-Pt catalysts for CO removal from hydrogen rich streams in PEM reactors. Adding another metal to Pt changes the electronic properties of Pt which might change the adsorptive capacity of the catalyst. In addition, the catalyst support can influence the ability of the electrode to adsorb impurities. To investigate the effect of the catalyst support, Pt nanoparticles supported onto two types of carbon, i.e., carbon black and activated carbon are studied. To compare the surface area and pore size distribution of the bare carbon black, and activated carbon particles as well as their Pt decorated samples, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms are obtained and the results are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically stirring of the supported catalyst (Pt/C or PtRu/C) and appropriate amounts of 5wt% Nafion solution in a mixture of ultrapure water and isopropanol for 30min. A Nafion 112 membrane (DuPont) was treated by boiling in 5% H2O2 for half an hour followed by boiling in 0.5M sulfuric acid for another half an hour and finally boiling in ultrapure water for 1h. The treated membrane was stored in ultrapure water. The catalyst ink was sprayed in layers onto the carbon papers by the spraying machine. This machine assures a well distribution of the catalyst ink onto the carbon papers producing a homogeneous catalyst layer. Electrodes with desired loadings are made without any significant loss. The catalyst layer weight was confirmed by measurements the electrode weight before spraying and after drying of the electrode comparing the two numbers. The cell is assembled using a uniform torque of 10Nm."
3,Breakthrough curve measurement tests,"2.2 Breakthrough curve measurement tests Systematic experiments are carried out to investigate the adsorption capacities through measuring the breakthrough curves of the adsorber with the four flow field types exposed to different feedstock flow rate of 120mlmin−1 and different CO concentrations including 100, 300 and 500ppm balanced with hydrogen. As a measure of the system performance, it is essential to have an insight of the adsorption capacity of the adsorber. The time taken for the concentration of the CO in the outlet to reach 10ppm is measured and reported as the breakthrough time. The setup used to measure the breakthrough times is depicted in Fig. 4. It includes a gas analyzer with an Infra-Red detector to measure the CO and hydrogen concentrations before and after the adsorber. The gas mixture is supplied to the cell from a pressure cylinder regulated by pressure gauges. The feedstock flow rates are measured and controlled using a digital mass flow controller. The breakthrough curves were measured by the gas analyzer at the outlet of the adsorber. The analyzer is able to detect ppm level of CO available in the gas stream flowing through the CO sensor. The analog current output is recorded on a computer through a data logger. The current is proportional to the carbon monoxide concentration and therefore, the concentrations are calculated according to the recorded currents. Studying the effect of different geometrical and operational parameters on the adsorber breakthrough time provides a guideline for making adsorber with the optimized performance. An in-house fabricated PEM reactor with a 50cm2 membrane electrode assembly (MEA) sandwiched between two graphite plates as the flow fields is used. Once the adsorber is saturated with CO at the end of a breakthrough measurement test, a potential of 0.9V is applied for 5min (arbitrary time) to fully electro-oxidize the CO molecules adsorbed. Subsequently the reactor is purged with nitrogen for at least 10min to remove the CO molecules from the reactor."
4,Pressure drop measurement test,"2.3 Pressure drop measurement test Pressure drops are measured using a differential pressure sensor. This type of pressure sensor enables the measurement of the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the anode chamber. Hydrogen stream in the presence of 300ppm CO at 100mlmin−1 and 200mlmin−1 is fed into the anode flow field with parallel, multi-serpentine, pin-type and interdigitated design to measure the corresponding pressure drops between the outlet and inlet of the anode flow channel. The pressure sensor model MPXV5100 from Freescale Semiconductor Inc., USA with a precision of 2.5% was used to measure the pressure drops. The cell was purged with nitrogen after each experiment to remove the remaining gases from the previous test."
5,Results and discussion,"Fig. 5 presents the breakthrough curves of the adsorber with different flow fields exposed to hydrogen flow in the presence of (a) 100, (b) 300 and (c) 500ppm CO. As mentioned earlier, the area of MEA is 50cm2 with a loading of 2mgcm−2 Pt/C deposited on Toray carbon paper. The gas flow rate is 120mlmin−1 and the measurements are done at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Results indicate that the breakthrough time for all the three CO concentrations increases in this order: straight<pin-type<multi-serpentine<interdigitated. Straight flow field offers the shortest flow path among the flow fields which justifies the shortest breakthrough time presented by this flow field. Straight and pin-type flow fields are beneficial as they give the lowest pressure drop. However, in the case of these two flow fields, gas flows tend to pass through paths with the least flow resistance which may cause dead volume and stagnant areas. This may disturb the uniformity of the gases distribution leading to the decrease of the contact points between the gas molecules and the catalyst layer with the consequence of the decrease in breakthrough time. Serpentine flow field is claimed to improve the issues mentioned in straight and pin-type flow fields. In addition, this flow field produces a longer channel leading to a big pressure drop between the channel inlets to the outlet but it favorably increases the exposure time of the gas and catalyst surface. The gas flow is passed through the flow channels in the case of straight, pin-type and multi-serpentine flow fields and the contact between the gas molecules and the catalyst layer is because of the diffusion of the molecules through the catalyst layer. While, in the case of interdigitated flow field, the gas flow is forced through the catalyst layer which prolongs the contact between the catalyst and the CO molecules with the consequence of increasing the CO adsorption and breakthrough time. The breakthrough times of the adsorber of 50cm2 in active area with different flow fields exposed to hydrogen flow in the presence of 100, 300 and 500ppm CO are shown in Fig. 6. In all cases, a loading of 2mgcm−2 Pt/C deposited on Toray carbon paper is used as the catalyst layer and the gas flow rate is 120mlmin−1. To make a more meaningful judgment, the corresponding pressure drops of different flow fields as a function of time are also presented in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the pressure drop in different flow fields increases in the order: straight≈pin-type<multi-serpentine<interdigitated. The relatively big pressure drop in the case of multi-serpentine and even bigger in the case of interdigitated flow field increase the required pumping power and disturb the flow uniformity. In long term operation, the big pressure drop potentially may damage the reactor structure due to mechanical stresses. RTD analysis determines the exit age distribution at various moments explaining the reason why different flow fields present different performances. The distribution is related to axial dispersion radial mixing, and molecular diffusion in the flow fields (Nauman, 2008). In Fig. 7, the RTD curves of reactors with different flow fields are presented. It can be seen that the residence time of the reactors increase in the order: straight≈pin-type<multi-serpentine<interdigitated. Straight and interdigitated flow fields present the shortest and longest residence times, respectively. The small peaks in the RTD of interdigitated flow field at t=100 and 125min may be the result of few preferential flow paths through which the gas molecules pass from the inlet to the outlet. The majority of the molecules passing through interdigitated flow field have a much longer residence time. These results justify the differences among the performance of reactors. To study the effect of gas diffusion layer porosity and morphology on the adsorption capacity of the adsorber, the breakthrough time of the adsorber with an as received Ballard carbon paper and another Ballard carbon paper modified with mesophase pitch carbon are measured and compared with that of a reactor with Toray carbon paper as gas diffusion layer. The carbon papers specifications are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 8 presents the breakthrough times of the adsorber made with different GDLs of 50cm2 in active area and the same catalyst loading (2mgcm−2 Pt/C) with different flow fields exposed to hydrogen flow in the presence of 100, 300 and 500ppm CO. Compared to the corresponding breakthrough times of the adsorber using as received Toray and Ballard carbon papers, adsorbers with modified Ballard carbon paper have much shorter breakthrough times. The breakthrough time of adsorbers with the mentioned gas diffusion layers increases in the order: mesophase carbon modified<Ballard<Toray. This is due to the effect of porosity and permeability of the gas diffusion media. As seen from SEM results in Fig. 3 and confirmed by the porosity data presented in Table 2, the carbon paper modified with mesophase carbon having the lowest porosity hinders the gas transport conditions, which reduces the contact between the catalyst nanoparticles and the CO molecules. Fig. 9 presents the breakthrough times of the adsorbers with catalyst loadings of 0.5mgcm−2, 1mgcm−2 and 2mgcm−2 deposited on Toray carbon papers. The flow rate of the gas feed is 120mlmin−1. It can be seen that there is almost a linear correlation between the catalyst loading and the breakthrough time. The effect of using Pt-based alloy catalyst such as PtRu/C on the adsorption capacity of the adsorber is studied, too. This study could motivate investigations for development of non-Pt catalysts for CO removal from hydrogen rich streams in PEM reactors. Fig. 10 presents the breakthrough times of the adsorbers with Pt/C and PtRu/C catalysts loading of 2mgcm−2 deposited on Toray carbon papers. Compared to the breakthrough times of adsorbers with the same loading of Pt/C sprayed on Toray carbon paper, no remarkable difference is observed. This implies that alloying Pt with Ru does not change the CO adsorption relative to pure Pt noticeably. This observation is in agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations by Han and Ceder (2006). They concluded that alloying Pt with Ru increases the adsorption energy by 6meV, which is negligible compared to the Pt–CO bond strength, which is around 10eV. This is related to the difference of Pt and Ru lattice sizes (R Ru<R Pt) which induces a surface strain with the consequence of changing the electronic densities of Pt and increase in CO adsorption (Ge et al., 2001). The effect of the catalyst support is investigated by comparison between the adsorption times of adsorber with 2mgcm−2 Pt/C as shown in Fig. 11 and those of adsorbers with 2mgcm−2 Pt supported on activated carbon. Breakthrough times of adsorbers with catalyst particles supported on activated carbon are considerably longer than those supported on carbon black. This is partly related to the microstructure, porosity and the surface area of the two supports. Activated carbon is a high surface area carbon with 4–5 folds higher surface area compared to carbon black as indicated in Table 3. These factors influence the electrocatalyst nanoparticles dispersion on the carbon surface. A good dispersion of the nanoparticles provides access to a larger number of active sites, therefore enhances the contact between the catalyst sites and the gas molecules with the consequence of improving the adsorption of impurities. In addition, as the support material is a porous material, it has the ability to facilitate the CO adsorption through physico-chemical adsorption of CO molecules. The CO adsorption capacity onto the pore surface of the support material is also strongly related to the micro-pore volume and specific surface area. Activated carbon, having a significantly higher surface area and micro-pore volume potentially increases the CO adsorption capacity of the reformer more effectively compared to the reactor made of electrocatalyst supported on carbon black. Normally, the driving force for the gas molecules adsorption onto solid surfaces is the van der Waals force. The gas adsorption potential has the largest value in pores with sub-nanometer size where binding energies are much higher due to the potential wells created (Romanos et al., 2012). Therefore, exploiting a support material with maximized number of sub-nanometer pores has the potential to increase the CO adsorption capacity of the gas clean-up unit."
6,Conclusion,"A parametric study was carried out to provide guidelines for designing a PEM reactor used as a gas clean-up system for production of pure hydrogen for fuel cells or other applications. The focus of the study was on the effect of different geometrical and operational parameters of the adsorber such as the gas flow field geometry, gas diffusion layer porosity and thickness, catalysts and catalyst supports type and loading on the adsorption capacity of the adsorber. An electrochemical approach is used to electro-oxidize the adsorbed CO molecules. Having established the relationships among these key parameters, one can design an adsorber with the best performance while using optimum amount of catalyst loading. To achieve this purpose, four different flow fields (straight, multi-serpentine, pin-type and interdigitated flow fields), gas diffusion fields with porosities of 0.55, 0.74 and 0.78 and single metal catalyst (Pt) and alloyed (PtRu) supported onto two different supports including carbon black and activated carbon with metal loadings of 0.5, 1 and 2mgcm−2 were studied. Results indicated that the breakthrough time for all the three CO concentrations increases in this order: straight<pin-type<multi-serpentine<interdigitated. In the case of interdigitated flow field, the gas flow is forced through the catalyst layer which prolongs the contact between the catalyst and the CO molecules with the consequence of increasing the CO adsorption and breakthrough time. To make a more meaningful judgment, the corresponding pressure drops of different flow fields as a function of time are also measured. Results indicate that the pressure drop in different flow fields increases in the order: straight≈pin-type<multi-serpentine<interdigitated. The relatively big pressure drop in the case of multi-serpentine and even bigger in the case of interdigitated flow field increase the required pumping power and disturb the flow uniformity. In long term operation, the big pressure drop potentially may damage the reactor structure due to mechanical stresses. RTD analysis of different flow fields indicates that interdigitated flow field has the longest residence time among the flow fields. In addition, RTD curves of this flow field exhibit few small peaks implying that there are preferential flow paths through which the gas molecules pass from the inlet to the outlet. The breakthrough time of adsorbers with the gas diffusion layers studied in this research, increases in the order: mesophase carbon modified<Ballard<Toray. This is due to the effect of porosity and permeability of the gas diffusion media. The carbon paper modified with mesophase carbon having the lowest porosity hinders the gas transport conditions, which reduces the contact between the catalyst nanoparticles and the CO molecules. It was also found out that there is almost a linear relationship between the catalyst loading and the breakthrough time. In addition, compared to the breakthrough times of adsorbers with the same loading of Pt/C sprayed on Toray carbon paper, no remarkable difference is observed when PtRu/C is used as the catalyst. This implies that alloying Pt with Ru does not change the CO adsorption relative to pure Pt noticeably. This study motivates investigations for development of non-Pt catalysts for CO removal from hydrogen rich streams in PEM reactors. Furthermore, breakthrough times of adsorbers with catalyst particles supported on activated carbon are considerably longer than those supported on carbon black. Activated carbon, having a significantly higher surface area and micro-pore volume potentially increases the CO adsorption capacity of the reformer more effectively compared to the reactor made of electrocatalyst supported on carbon black. Therefore, exploiting a support material with maximized number of sub-nanometer pores has the potential to increase the CO adsorption capacity of the gas clean-up unit."
