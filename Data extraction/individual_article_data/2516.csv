0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of economy and urbanization in China, annual production of food waste from household, commercial restaurants, canteen and food-processing plants is increasing (Li et al., 2018a). In China, about 100 million tons of food waste are generated each year (Wang et al., 2020). Anaerobic digestion was considered as an attractive method to convert food waste to renewable energy (Yin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018b). Food waste can be converted into VFAs and clean fuel-H2 by biological fermentation, which could prevent environmental pollution and recycle carbon resources. Glucose, as a typical carbohydrate, could derived from hydrolysis of cellulose and starch, which are the main components in food waste. In anaerobic digestion process, anaerobes digested the substrate to maintain their lives while releasing gas and VFAs. Currently, the researchers regarded the VFAs as a better carbon source than biogas due to the limits of applications of bio-methane and high potential yield of VFAs (Yin et al., 2016; Eryildiz et al., 2020). Furthermore, VFAs usage area has been widely developed, including biodiesel (Fortela et al., 2016), PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) (Fradinho et al., 2014), electricity production via microbial fuel cells (Zheng et al., 2017). H2 is a clean fuel with high calorific value and is promising in the future. Thus, fermentation of organic material for H2 and VFAs was widely studied. Some factors such as pH (Jiang et al., 2013), temperature (Ho et al., 2014), HRT (Hydraulic retention time) (Ferreira et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2011) and OLR (Jiang et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2011) were found to be effective on H2 production. And numerous methods were applied for H2 yield enhancement, such as co-digestion (Wang et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2017), gas control (Bastidas-Oyanedel et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2015), nutritional balance (C/N, C/P) (Carosia et al., 2021) and etc. Pure culture such as Clostridium sp. could significantly increase the H2 yield (Park et al., 2018), however the bacteria was very sensitive to oxygen and need expensive operation cost (Dong et al., 2009). One way to reduce processing cost is to work with open mixed cultures under non-sterile conditions (Kleerebezem and van Loosdrecht, 2007), which means higher microbial diversity, better capable of dealing with substrate mixtures of various composition (Temudo et al., 2008). Additionally, mixed culture was very easy to obtain from wastewater treatment, soil (Carosia et al., 2021) or mixing pig manure with slurry. However, the mixed culture often contains H2-consuming bacteria such as methanogens and homoacetogens (Pu et al., 2019). Methanogens can be inactivated by some pretreatment, such as thermal treatment (Silva et al., 2017; Eryildiz et al., 2020), acid/alkali pretreatment (Pendyala et al., 2012) and etc. However, the activity of homoacetogens couldn’t be inhibited in these processes. In addition, acetogenesis was quite distinguished from homoacetogenesis. During the anaerobic digestion, organic polymers were first hydrolyzed and digested into H2, CO2, organic acids and alcohols. After that organic acids and alcohols (except acetate) were transformed to acetate and H2 by acidogenic bacteria, while homoacetogens consumed generated H2 and CO2 to form acetate and resulted in low H2 yield (Eq. (1)). And this is the reason that there was always a lag time/ phase before the observation of homoacetogenesis. Dinamarca and Bakke (2012) showed that H2 yield in non-methanogen system decreased from about 2 mol-H2/mol-glucose in first 20 days to 0.02–0.40 mol-H2/mol-glucose after 30 days. From this phenomenon, we speculated H2 consumed through homoacetogenesis couldn’t be ignored. Saady (2013) summarized homoacetogenesis consumed 11–43% generated H2 in single and repeated batch fermentations, but the quantification and extent during continuous fermentation needed further investigate. According to the study of Menezes and Silva (2019), the occurrence of homoacetogenesis was not influenced by the decrease in HRT. Anzola-Rojas et al. (2015) revealed that a low organic loading rate was favorable to homoacetogenesis, resulted a low H2 yield. Some strategies were applied to inhibit the effect of homoacetogenesis in non-methanogen system (Carosia et al., 2021). The main ideas of suppressing the homoacetogenesis reaction were 1) increasing the gas–liquid mass transfer (Montiel Corona & Razo-Flores, 2018), 2) controlling the cell growth (Carosia et al., 2021) and 3) reduced P H 2 (H2 partial pressure). Compared with methods 1) and 2), reducing P H 2 has the advantages of lower equipment and simpler operation. The partial pressure of H2 and CO2 can be reduced by reduction of headspace pressure in the fermenter, and the Gibbs free energy of Eq. (1) was reduced as a result of low H2 and CO2 partial pressure, thereby the homoacetogenesis was inhibited. The influence of P H 2 on anaerobic digestion, especially H2 yield has been widely studied (Yan et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2012; Kisielewska et al., 2015). Few studies investigated the influence of P H 2 on the homoacetogenesis in semi-continuous fermentation, Siriwongrungson et al. (2007) revealed that the H2 produced by the degradation of butyrate was used to form acetate with CO2 immediately under mixed gas (20% CO2 and 80% N2) sparging conditions. Dinamarca et al. (2011) investigated the influence of P H 2 on the homoacetogenesis in a batch fermentation, 6–51% generated hydrogen was converted to acetate when P H 2 was 0.6 atm. They didn’t take other metabolites such as butyrate, which could degraded into acetate and hydrogen under low P H 2 (Siriwongrungson et al., 2007), into consideration. However, the fermentation system was more complex, the homoacetogenesis is not only related to acetate, propionate, butyrate and generated hydrogen are exerting influence on homoacetogenesis (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2014). (1) 4H2 + 2CO2 → CH3COOH + 2H2O ΔG = − 131 kJ In this study, the effect of reduced pressure in headspace of fermenter and substrate concentration on H2 and VFAs yield was investigated in a semi-continuous fermentation, and especially the efficacy that H2 consumption through homoacetogenesis influenced by these two factors was analyzed (Considering the influence of acetate, propionate and butyrate on homoacetogenesis). The quantifications of H2 consumption were calculated and the formulas between HP and H2 yield under different OLRs were established in our study."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Seed sludge and cultivate medium used in fermentation,"2.1 Seed sludge and cultivate medium used in fermentation Anaerobic seed sludge was obtained by mixing the fresh pig manure and fermentation broth. In order to inactivate methanogen, the inoculum was first filtrated and thermally pretreated at 121 °C for 30 mins, and then pH was adjusted to 5.0 by 1 M HCl and NaOH. A medium employed for cultivating inoculum was consisted of 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L peptone, 2g/L beef extract, 0.5 g/L L-cysteine, a great amount of inorganic resources and little trace elements, including (g/L):NaCl (4), MgCl2 (0.1), FeCl2 (0.1), KH2PO4 (1.5), CoCl2·6H2O (0.1), FeCl2·4H2O (0.4), MnCl2·H2O (0.1), KAl(SO4)2 (0.01), CaCl2 (0.02), Na2MoO4 (0.01), H3BO3 (0.01) and NiCl2·6H2O (0.4). This medium was added every 2 days and after 6 times addition the enrichment of bacteria was completed (Liu and Wang, 2017). After the enrichment process, the TS (Total solid) and VS (Volatile solid) of inoculation sludge were 14.58% and 9.68%, respectively."
3,Anaerobic digestion process setup and experimental operation,"2.2 Anaerobic digestion process setup and experimental operation The experiment was carried out in about 800 mL working volume serum glass bottles which contained 300 mL inoculum and 500 mL glucose solution (glucose: (NH4)2SO4 : KH2PO4 = 3:1.5:1, calculated in mass), in order to test the effect of OLR, influent concentration was in a step increase (10, 20 and 30 g/L). HRT was set at 36 h and HP was set in 5 ranges: 100 ± 2 kPa, 80 ± 2 kPa, 60 ± 2 kPa, 40 ± 2 kPa and 20 ± 2 kPa. Each reactor was installed with a vacuum pressure controller that is connected with a pump to control the HP in the bottle (Fig. 1 ). The pressure controller could detect the pressure inside the glass bottle, once the inside pressure is higher than set parameters, the pump will start working immediately to reduce pressure to parameter we set. The temperature of bottles was maintained at 37 ± 0.2 °C through water bath and influent pH was adjusted to 5.0 ± 0.1 everyday using 2 M HCl and NaOH. After finished adding the slurry and substrate, the bottles were purified with nitrogen at a rate of 300 mL/min for 5 mins to create an anaerobic environment. Semi-continuous batch fermentation was used in this study to investigate product spectrum of glucose fermentation in different HP and OLR. The substrate was removed from and added to serum bottles by peristaltic pump at speed of 200 mL/min every day to maintain 36 h HRT, the gas productions were recorded every 24 h before the substrate was added, the VFAs of liquid samples and content of gas were measured every day after the substrate was renewed. Data given were the average values of the stable period."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Detection of VS and TS: (1) After being washed, the porcelain crucible was dried in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 1 h. After the furnace temperature was lowered to 100 °C, the porcelain crucible was taken out and cooled in a drying dish. The weight of the dried porcelain crucible was recorded as a g. (2) V ml sample was placed into crucible, and its weight was recorded as b g. Then, this crucible was dried in a dry box at 104 °C to a constant weight which was designated as c g. (3) The crucible containing the dried sample was burned in a ventilated place until no more smoke was emitted, and then placed in a muffle furnace, fired at 600 °C for 2 h. After the furnace temperature was dropped to 100 °C, the porcelain crucible was taken out and weighed in a drying dish, and its weight was recorded as d g. (4) The VS and TS were calculated according to the following equation: TS = [(c-a)/(b-a)] *100%; VS = [(c-d)/(b-a)] *100%. Volumetric biogas composition (mainly H2 and CO2) was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC) (FULI; GC9790II; China). A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was installed in GC to determine the type of gas and its proportion. The carrier gas was helium, flow rate was 15 mL/min. When biogas was tested, the temperatures of injector, oven and detector were set at 150, 200 and 120 °C respectively. Biogas was analyzed with a packed column (Porapak Q column [3 m × 3 mm] connected with a TDX-01 column [2 m × 3 mm]) (Li et al., 2019a). H2 yield amounted to the total gas multiplied by the proportion of H2. Liquid samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 mins with its pH adjusted to 2–3 and filtered through a 45 μm membrane before testing VFAs. After the pretreatment, alcohols and VFAs, including EtOH (Ethanol), PrOH (Propanol), HAc (Acetic acid), HPr (Propionic acid),HBu (Butyric acid),HVa (Valeric acid), were analyzed by the same GC equipped with automatic sampler with a flame ionized detector (FID) and column detector (Kromat, KB-Wax; 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.33 mm). H2 and nitrogen were both carrier gases, flow rate were all set at 75 mL/min. The temperatures of both inlet and detector were both 250 °C while testing, temperature of oven was programmed to rise up from initially 80 °C to the final 200 °C at a rate of 20 °C per min to separate various compounds of VFAs by the nature of the boiling point of different organic acids and alcohols (Liu and Wang, 2017)."

6,Effect of OLR and HP on H2 yield: The role of homoacetogenesis,"3.1 Effect of OLR and HP on H2 yield: The role of homoacetogenesis In this study, glucose solution was added into fermenter with mixed culture to produce bio-H2 and VFAs. The biogas was consisted of H2 and CO2 only, which indicated thermal pretreatment of sludge was useful for inactivating methanogens. H2 content in biogas varied from 30 to 60%, and H2 content under 10 and 20 g/L OLR (about 50%) was higher than H2 content under 30 g/L OLR (about 30%). And this might has no connection with pH since the effluent pH was very close in 20 g/L and 30 g/L, and may have a great relationship with the concentration of glucose. The H2 yield under different OLRs and HPs was demonstrated in Table 1 , the H2 yield was positively correlated to the glucose concentration when HP was 100 kPa. However, when the HP was decreased, the increasing trend of H2 yield with the increase in OLR was disappeared. For example, when HP was 60 kPa, the average H2 production obtained in 10 g/L OLR was 9.62 mmol/L·d−1 and 20.88 mmol/L·d−1 when OLR was 20 g/L, only 22.18 mmol/L·d−1 when OLR increased to 30 g/L. Kim et al (2012) reported that the H2 yield decreased from 0.9 mol-H2/mol-glucose to 0.8 mol-H2/mol-glucose as the OLR increased from 20 g/L·d−1 to 40 g/L·d−1. The inhibition of high OLR on H2 yield was also observed in fermentation of sugarcane vinasse (Djalma Nunes Ferraz Júnior et al., 2014). The P H 2 under different conditions was illustrated in Table 2 . As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, the effect of reduced pressure on P H 2 and further on the H2 yield is very clear. Compared with the control group, the H2 yield in experimental group increased by at least 2 times. The decrease of HP will directly induce the reduction of P H 2 (as shown in Table 2). The P H 2 was 53, 35, 26, 17, 10 kPa under 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure when the OLR was 10 g/L, respectively (Pi = Pxi, where P is the headspace pressure, xi is the percentage of H2). The P H 2 was 52, 38, 28, 21, 8 kPa under 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure when the OLR was 20 g/L, respectively and P H 2 was 40, 31, 24, 14, 9 kPa under100 kPa, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure when the OLR was 30 g/L, respectively. P H 2 decreased about 10 kPa in all groups as the HP decreased by 20 kPa. However, theoretical H2 yield was always much higher than actual yield. Theoretically 4 mol H2 could formed through acetate pathway (Eq. (2)) and 2 mol H2 was released by butyrate pathway (Eq. (3)) when per mol glucose is degraded. (2) C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 ΔG = -206.0 KJ (3) C6H12O6 → CH3(CH2)2COOH + 2CO2 + 2H2 ΔG = -254.0 KJ In this experiment, no methane was detected so no H2 was consumed by methanogens. The formation of HPr would result in decrease of H2, but it could be ignored due to the few amount of HPr. Organic acids and alcohols can be converted to each other under certain conditions, some of them are H2-consuming pathways, such as the conversion of acetate to ethanol (Eq. (4)), propionate (Eq. (5)) and butyrate (Eq. (6)). (4) CH3COOH + H2 → CH3CH2OH + H2O ΔG = −19.2 KJ (5) 2CH3COOH + 3H2 + 2CO2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 4H2O ΔG = −76.1 KJ (6) 2CH3COOH + 2H2 → CH3(CH2)2COOH + 2H2O ΔG = −48.1 KJ However, because of higher P H 2 , the homoacetogenesis (Eq. (1)) was more obvious in H2 consumption than above reactions (because of lower ΔG). Homoacetogenesis consumed lots of generated H2 and unfavorable to H2 production. An equation (Eq. (7)) that calculates acetate formed from Eq. (1) was proposed (Carrillo-Reyes et al., 2014), and then H2 consumed through homoacetogenesis could be calculated. (7) Ac homoacet = 2 HAc + 2 HBu - HPr - H 2 / 6 where the Achomoacet was the acetate produced from Eq. (1), HAc, HBu, HPr and H2 represented acetate, butyrate, propionate and H2 yield (mmol/d), respectively. Here, we take 10 g/L OLR as an example. According to our result, the acetate obtained from homoacetogenesis (Eq. (1)) were about 3.37, 1.04, 1.25, 0.66 and 0 mmol/L·d−1, under 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure. And based on the coefficient of Eq. (1), we can easily calculate the consumed H2 was 13.49, 4.16, 5.01, 2.65 and 0 mmol/L·d−1, equal to 302.25, 93.18, 112.15, 59.29 and 0 mL/ L·d−1 under 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure. In addition, the consumed H2 was 24.92, 17.60, 17.00, 18.12 and 25.84 mmol/L·d−1 when OLR was 20 g/L and 16.48, 23.32, 16.12, 27 and 18.84 mmol/L·d−1 when OLR was 30 g/L under 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 kPa headspace pressure, respectively. This result was much correlated to the P H 2 in the headspace, and it proves that lowing headspace pressure is an effective method to accumulate H2 by repressing the activity of homoacetogenic bacteria. The H2 production under 60 kPa condition was 9.62 mmol/L·d−1, lower than 14.09 mmol/L·d−1 in 80 kPa group. There may be two reasons: one is more HPr was formed in 60 kPa than 80 kPa (shown in Table 3 ), the formation of HPr is a reaction that consumes pyruvate, and this will result in a decrease in the amount of pyruvate used to generate H2 (Eq. (8)). Another is the higher HBu/HAc ratio of group 80 kPa than group 60 kPa, which was considered as an indicator of high H2 production (Silva et al., 2017; Tawfik & El-Qelish, 2012). (8) C6H12O6 + 4H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2CO2 ΔG = -279.4 kJ The consumed H2 yield through homoacetogenesis and accumulated H2 yield under 10 g/L, 20 g/L and 30 g/L condition were depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 . As can be seen clearly, there is a trend that consumed H2 is decreasing as the reduction of HP, especially when OLR was 10 g/L. However, there was not much difference on the consumed and accumulated H2 yield after the HP decreased to 80 kPa when the OLR was 20 g/L. When the OLR was 30 g/L condition, the consumed and actual yields under 100 kPa were both low. H2 yield in control groups were 0.24, 0.23 and 0.20 mmol/g-glucosedegrade·d−1 when OLR was 10, 20 and 30 g/L, respectively, which were similar. However, it varied much when the headspace pressure was decreased. The minimal consumed H2 yield was almost 0. As a result, the maximum H2 yield was 3.31 mmol/g-glucosedegrade·d−1 in this experiment, which was 12.67 times higher than H2 yield under the OLR was 10 g/L and HP was 100 kPa. The ratio of consumed H2 to total H2 in control groups were 89.33%, 88.71% and 79.84% under 10, 20 and 30 g/L concentration, respectively. But headspace pressure exerted a huge impact on hydrogen consumed through homoacetogenesis, the ratio decreased to 40 to 70% in 20 and 30 g/L experimental groups and 10–30% in 10 g/L experimental groups, and even almost 0 under 10 g/L and 20 kPa condition. The H2 yield was quite low in this study, and the reasons may be attributing to reduced products formation at pH < 4.6, biomass growth and homoacetogenesis, summarized by Dinamarca and Bakke (2012). In this study, we performed a polynomial fitting of the H2 production under the condition of 10 g/L, the formula was y = -0.00023x3 + 0.04056x2 − 2.3142x + 54.384. Where the × was headspace pressure (kPa), y was H2 yield (mmol/L·d−1). The R2 of this equation was 0.935, which indicated this equation could well predict the production of H2 under 10 g/L and different HPs. The polynomial fitting under 20 g/L and 30 g/L were also performed and the formula s were y = -0.0063x2 + 0.5809x + 8.652 (R2 = 0.983) and y = −0.0002x3 + 0.0387x2-2.122x + 53.578 (R2 = 0.816), respectively (Fig. 3 ). In order to accumulate more H2, H2 consumption through homoacetogenesis must be decreased. To achieve this goal, the Gibbs free energy of Eq. (1) should be reduced. Creating a reduced pressure in the headspace of fermenter is effective. The P H 2 and P C O 2 (CO2 partial pressure) were reduced simultaneously and ΔG would no doubt decrease, the reaction balance would shift to left and the consumption of H2 through this pathway would decrease. Low headspace pressure and low OLR were more favorable to the accumulation of H2 though the law is not so consistent at different OLRs."
7,Data analysis,"3.2 Data analysis SPSS 18.0 software was used for data analysis. The analysis of variance on H2 consumption rate through homoacetogenesis and acid production rate was performed, and the interaction of HP and OLR on the results was considered. Table 4 showed the result of factors HP, OLR and their interaction on H2 consumption rate (mmol/g-glucosedegrade·d−1) through homoacetogenesis. The p values of OLR, HP and HP*OLR were all 0, which means HP, OLR and their interaction have significant influence on H2 consumption rate. In addition, there is no obvious difference among them. And then, we examined the specific impact of HP on H2 consumption (Table 5 ). As illustrated in Table 5, the 5 levels of HP were divided into two subsets, the numbers in subset were the average of H2 consumption at the corresponding level. There is no difference between levels in the same subset, and there are significant differences in levels between different subsets. Apparently, there is much difference between control group and experimental group. Table 6 illustrated the factors HP, OLR and their interaction on acid production rate. According to the results, both HP and OLR have significant effect on acid production rate. Acid production rate under 40, 60 and 80 kPa HP was higher than 20 and 100 kPa, and acid production rate under 20 g/L was higher than 10 and 30 g/L."
8,VFA concentration,"3.3 VFA concentration Total VFA (TVFA) concentrations shown in Fig. 4 a were the average values of the fermentation period. The increase of OLR could enhance the yield of VFA under experimental conditions, however VFA yield has not changed when glucose concentration increased from 20 to 30 g/L under control group, but the content of each component varies a lot (Fig. 4b). The maximum VFA concentration of 3481 mg/L was obtained at OLR = 30 g/L, HP = 60 kPa condition. Actually, the VFA yield of 30 g/L group was higher than 10 and 20 g/L group when the headspace pressure decreased below 80 kPa. However, as the HP decreased to 40 and 20 kPa, this increasing trend becomes slower, which might indicate high VFA yield has an inhibitory effect on the further degradation of glucose to produce VFA. The suitable glucose concentration for acid production according to our results was between 20 and 30 g/L. Higher OLR and high HP have a co-inhibition effect on the VFA yield. As shown in Fig. 4a, when OLR was 30 g/L, HP was 100 kPa, TVFA concentration was 1955 mg/L, lower than the concentration under the same HP when OLR was 20 g/L. As can be seen clearly, there is no doubt that the decrease of HP has a positive influence on the VFA concentration. In addition, glucose degradation rates were both nearly 70% under 20 and 30 g/L OLR and 100 kPa HP condition, and acid production obtained in contorl group under 20 g/L was almost the same as that under 30 g/L, however the H2 yield under 30 g/L was higher than 20 g/L. One possibility was the content of butyrate was higher under 20 g/L (the butytrate content was 75% under 20 g/L while 48% under 30 g/L), and the consumed H2 through homoacetogenesis calculated by Eq. (7) was higher. This means it’s necessary to adjust the fermentation parameters (especially pH) for ethanol-type fermentation to get a high H2 yield (Li et al., 2020). Another possibility was the portion of glucose was utilized to the synthesis of biomass (Bastidas-Oyanedel et al., 2012). As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the EtOH yield accounts for 11–46% and HBu production accounts for 43–79%, which exhibited sign of mixed ethanol and butyric acid type fermentation. At relatively low concentrations (10 and 20 g/L), the content of ethanol was between 20 and 30%, and ethanol content increased to 30–40% when glucose concentration was 30 g/L. As shown in Fig. 4b, it is possible that the fermentation type has changed from butyrate-type to ethanol-type since the effluent pH was 4–4.5 while influent pH was 5. High OLR would result a quicker decline in pH, and this might be the cause of the higher ethanol content under 30 g/L OLR. In addition, ethanol production is a non H2-producing pathway (Eq. (9)) and this might be one of the reasons for low H2 yield. The content of acetate in all experimental condition were almost the same. (9) C6H12O6 → 2CH3CH2OH + 2CO2 ΔG = -164.8 kJ Theoretically, the lower of P H 2 can inhibit homoacetogenesis, so acetate production rate would decrease. But many metabolic pathways generate acetate under low P H 2 at the same time (Huang et al., 2020), as shown in Eqs. (4) to (6), which led to an increase in HAc. And the formation of acetate was to provide the necessary NADH to maintain the stability of the fermentation system (Ren et al., 2006). As a result, the decrease of P H 2 will not reduce the yield of HAc."
9,VFA conversion rate and degree of acidification,"3.4 VFA conversion rate and degree of acidification DOA indicates the degree of acid production due to the production of carboxylic acids related to the degradation of substrate (Eq. (10)) (Dahiya et al., 2015) and was depicted in Fig. 5 . (10) DOA % = Sf / Si ∗ 100 where Si represent initial substrate concentration (in COD, mg/L) and Sf represent net VFA concentration (in COD, mg/L). The COD theoretical equivalents of organic matter was expressed by following equation: (2x + y/2-z)*16/ (12x + y + 16z), supposing the molecular was CxHyOz (The COD theoretical equivalent for ethanol was 2.08, for acetate was 1.066, for propionate was 1.512 and for butyrate was 1.816). In addition, the production of ethanol in this experiment could not be ignored, it was also included in the DOA calculation. The DOA value under different conditions were depicted in Fig. 5, the low DOA here (around 20 to 30%) indicated that few glucose was utilized to produce VFA and H2. Alkaya and Demirer (2011) used sugar-beet processing wastes as the substrate, obtained a maximum 600 mg-VFA/g-COD with 40 to 60% DOA result. At 20 and 30 g/L concentrations, the DOA was increased with the decrease of HP, and so do H2 and VFA yield. This indicated that low HP could promote the hydrolysis of substrate at high OLR. DOA was significantly influenced by the type of fermentation. To better understand the impact of OLR and HP on VFA production, the VFA production rate was also depicted in Fig. 5. Eq. (11) was used to calculate acid production rate in our previous study (Li et al., 2019b). (11) Acid production rate = X / SCOD degrade 2 where X was the concentration of VFA (mg-COD/L·d−1), SCODdegrade was the digested SCOD (Soluble chemical oxygen demand) (mg/L·d−1) between two adjacent sampling time. (12) SCOD degrade nd = SCOD n - 1 d + SCOD add - - SCOD rest nd where SCODdegrade nd was the amount of SCOD degradation on day n, SCOD(n-1)d represented SCOD degradation amount on day n-1. SCODadd was the added SCOD on that day. SCODrest nd means the amount of undegraded SOCD after 24 h fermentation, which followed the equation SCODrest nd = SCODnd – SCODSMP, SCODSMP indicated the theoretical SCOD value of soluble products. Overall, the acid production rate at middle concentration (20 g/L) was higher than low (10 g/L) and high (30 g/L) concentration. And acid production rate at low HP was higher than control group under 20 g/L and 30 g/L. HAc production rate in all groups were almost the same. The maximum acid production rate was 489.86 mg-COD/g-CODdegrade·d−1 obtained under condition of 20 g/L OLR and 40 kPa HP. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the acid production rate decreased sharply as the concentration of glucose increased from 20 to 30 g/L, acid production rate under 10 g/L, 20 g/L and 100 kPa condition were 338.72 and 346.13 mg-COD/g-CODdegrade·d−1, respectively, however only 245.31 mg-COD/g-CODdegrade·d−1 when the OLR increased to 30 g/L. Obviously, generation of VFA has a great relationship with the concentration of the substrate. From another perspective, the reduction of HP was beneficial to the degradation of substrate when the substrate concentration was higher enough to induced inhibition, thus, the acid production rate increased as the HP decreased."
10,Conclusions,"In this study, the factors OLR and HP were examined on the performance of H2 and VFAs yield. Results showed that homoacetogenesis consumed more than 79% H2 under control groups, higher than prior reports, and low headspace pressure could reduce this part H2 consumption by 10–70% and was favorable to the accumulation of H2. The component of VFA also plays a vital role in the accumulation of H2, H2 consumed through homoacetogenesis was positively related to the production of acetate and butyrate. The max acid production rate was 489.86 mg-COD/g-CODdegrade·d−1 when OLR was 20 g/L and HP was 40 kPa."
