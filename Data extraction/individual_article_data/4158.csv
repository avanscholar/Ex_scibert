0,Introduction,"Selective oxidation of a hydroxyl group to carbonyl without traceable over-oxidation products often represents a key step in total synthesis of complex natural products and widely recognized as one of the most fundamental transformations in industrial, laboratory, synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical synthesis [1–5]. Tremendous efforts on developing efficient catalysts towards these oxidations have been progressed and reported [6–8]. Many oxidizing reagents have been traditionally utilized in order to accomplish this transformation. Traditional synthesis approaches for commercial production of benzaldehyde has obvious drawbacks, including toxic, hazardous or costly oxidant, stringent reaction conditions and expensive catalysts and produce a large amount of wastes [9–13]. With increasing of environmental problems, a wide range of efforts has been devoted in order to the development of feasible catalytic protocols and utilizing molecular oxygen as a primary oxidant, which is easily accessible and produce water as the sole byproduct [1,14,15]. Among this, hypervalent iodine compounds has emerged as versatile and environmentally benign oxidizing reagents [16–19]. Recently, hypervalent iodine oxidants has been widely applied for oxidation in organic synthesis [18,20–26] because they are having unique features such as less toxic, nonmetallic and easy to handle, and they allow gentle reaction conditions in most cases [27]. Between hypervalent iodine compounds, polyvalent iodine carboxylates such as (diacetoxyiodo) arenes can be most important class. [28]. According to valuable features of hypervalent iodine compounds, synthesis of polymer-supported hypervalent iodine reagents with having the similar reactivity as their monomeric analogues [29,30] and the employment of hypervalent iodine amounts as catalytic reagent of in combination with an external oxidant for different transformations is an noteworthy area of research [31–34]. On the other hand, the polymeric component containing inorganic partials in very general terms, because of the advantageous structural functions may tune processability, stability and the mechanical features of the final materials, whereas specific functionalities such as luminescence, catalytic activity, magnetism and other features can introduce by inorganic component [35–38]. Numerous techniques have been improved for fabrication of polymer/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles and also polymer coatings on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) through in-situ or ex-situ methods including physical adsorption of polymers and polymerization in associate with nanoparticles (NPs), which can be mentioned in some ways such as “grafting-to” and “grafting-from” techniques [39,40]. The formation of magnetite/ polymer hybrid materials leads to immobilization of the MNPs and endows the MNPs with functionality, therefore the magnetic polymer hybrid can be widely applied in medicine, biology, and catalysis [41–48]. In heterogeneous reaction, tedious recycling process like filtration and centrifugation are applied to regenerate catalysts that lead to loss of solid catalyst during the process of separation and also environmental concerns [49]. In this context, polymer matrices as hybrid materials consisting nanoparticles of iron oxides and polymer network with high dispersive magnetized particle inclusions can be regarded for designing of composites builds on the integration of properties of inorganic nanoparticles and an organic material. As a result, magnetic isolation supplies a convenient method to recycle magnetized species by using an appropriate magnetic field [50–52]. Based on this strategy and in continuation our works on preparation of new heterogeneous catalysts [53–57] we design a catalytic system using quick and inexpensive synthetic route for the effective conversion of various benzylalchohols to the corresponding substituted benzaldehydes. This synthetic strategy according to previous works [58] was performed in the two consecutive pathways; first during the convenient one-step process, 2-iodoanliline in combination with iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO)3 .9H2O) as Fe resource to synthesize of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was successfully polymerized and composite material of Fe3O4-PANI-I was obtained. Therefore, the linkage of iodine groups with advantages of solid phase organic as an attractive target was achieved. Second, efficient oxidation in freshly prepared peracetic acid solution was applied as activation step of iodo groups that lead to synthesis of hypervalent iodine reagent. It was found that obtained composite material is a potentially oxidant compound and can be employed as an efficient and selective oxidant in oxidation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding benzaldehydes. Through optimization of reaction conditions and comprehensive evaluation, various benzyl alcohols were allowed to react and we speculated that the alcohol oxidation was directly promoted by using the synthesized heterogeneous nanocatalyst under appropriate amount of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO). Using the ferromagnetic properties of Fe within the structure, nanocatalyst can be regenerated and recycled successfully."

Detection of the progress of the reaction was carried out by TLC technique and on plates of silica gel 60 F254 with aluminum-backed that visualized through ultraviolet light."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of Fe3O4-PANI-I nanocomposite 2.4240 g of Fe(NO)3 .9H2O and 0.7 g of 2-iodoaniline were dissolved in 48.00 mL EtOH to produce brick red solution. By transferring the solution into autoclave of Teflon lined stainless-steel with 100 mL capacity, the reaction was carried out at 200 °C for 10 h [58]. After gathering of product with outer magnet and its frequent washing with distilled H2O and hot EtOH, finally gained sample was dried at 70 °C. 2.2.2 Preparation of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite A solution with 4:1 ratio of acetic anhydride (6.36 mL, 67.4 mmol) and hydrogen peroxide (30%) (1.6 mL, 14.2 mmol) mixture was prepared and stirred for 5 h at 40 °C. Obtained peracetic acid solution (20 mL) was added to Fe3O4-PANI-I magnetite nanocomposite (1.0 g) at 40 °C and allowed the mixture to stir overnight. In the last step, the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and the obtained brown precipitate was easily gathered with the help of permanent magnet. It was transferred to the vessel and washed with ethanol and finally was dried in an oven for 12 h at 70 °C. The synthetic route and steps for synthesis of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite is depicted in Scheme 1 ."
4,Oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2,"2.3 Oxidation of benzyl alcohols catalyzed by Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 The catalytic activity for alcohol oxidation was evaluated using a round bottom flask (25 mL) equipped with an electronically controlled magnetic stirrer. In a typical reaction condition, 1 mmol alcohol substrate, 0.015 g TEMPO (0.096 mmol) and 0.03 g catalyst (equals to 0.26 mol% of iodine(III)) were added into 3 mL acetonitrile, and the suspension was heated for reach to reaction condition under stirring in a flask without condenser (in reflux condition, a flask equipped with a condenser was used). Upon the completion of the reaction that was screened using TLC, 5 mL EtOH was added and the catalyst was separated by magnetic filtration, washed with ethanol and water, and dried in an oven at 40 °C overnight to be ready for the next cycle without any purification. In the next step, the solvent was evaporated under the reduced pressure, the impure product was refined by short column chromatography, to afford the desired purity."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Preparation of the catalyst,"3.1 Preparation of the catalyst 3.1.1 Procedure for synthesis and formation of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite In a typical preparation, Fe(NO)3 .9H2O and 2-iodoaniline were used as precursors for in-situ formation of Fe3O4-PANI-I nanocomposite using solvothermal method as explained in experimental section. Light brown magnetic precipitate was separated by external magnet and then in order to activation of iodo groups, it was dissolved in warm peracetic acid solution. The as-obtained mixture was kept overnight under these conditions. Finally, the Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite was obtained after drying for 12 h in an oven. 3.1.2 Characterization techniques of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite 3.1.2.1 Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) The FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1 ) were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 and confirmed the structure of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2. As displayed in Fig. 1a vibration bands which are ascribed to the surface FeO are seen at 435 cm−1. The absorbance peaks at 1442–1720 cm−1 are ascribed to the characteristic CC stretching of the quinoid and benzenoid rings which correspond to formation of polyaniline structure. The band around 1390 cm−1 is allocated to CN stretching of the secondary aromatic amine. The peak appearing at 524 cm−1 is corresponds to aryl-I vibration that confirmed the presence of iodine in the polymeric network. Functionalization of compound Fe3O4-PANI-I with peracetic acid solution leads to the emersion of new bands at around 1012–1078 cm−1 and 1647 cm−1 that are related to COC, and CO stretching mods. Moreover, increase of intensity at band around 1390 cm−1 is due to OCO stretching of acetoxy group. 3.1.2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) The Fig. 2 has shown diffraction pattern of composite material Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 that provided by XRD analysis. It can be seen that in the sample there are goal Fe3O4 and impurity Fe2O3. Indeed, the XRD results do not quite characterize the magnetic component (Fe3O4 and/or Fe2O3) since the XRD pattern of Fe3O4 is basically the identical as that of Fe2O3. It should be noted that during the solvothermal reaction process, iodoaniline plays a role of reductive reagent and can reduce a partial Fe3+ to Fe2+. In this process, adding appropriate amount of iodoaniline is one of the essential factor in order to ensure the 2:1 M ratio of Fe3+ and produced Fe2+ ions and ensuring formation of relatively pure Fe3O4 particles [58]. Furthermore, PANI-I compound has no obvious diffraction peak because of the relatively thin layer, amorphous and crystal structure of the PANI-I prepared under described polymerization method. In addition, via Scherrer equation the crystallite size at a half maximum (FWHM) of diffraction angle of (101) was assessed almost 20.751 nm. 3.1.2.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) By TGA analysis, thermal stability of the composite nanocatalyst was investigated. According to the results illustrated in Fig. 3 , Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 thermogram includes two weight loss steps, in the temperature below 110 °C and temperature range of 110–360 °C. The first one is related to the loss of water or organic solvent molecules physically adsorbed on the surface of nanocomposite (about 4%) and the second step was for decomposition of its polymeric network (about 17%). Beyond 360 °C, rate of mass loss was kept in stable condition until the analysis was completed in which remaining mass is related to relative high thermal stability of synthesized nanocomposite means magnetic particles (about 79%). 3.1.2.4 Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) Magnetic pattern of magnetite nanocomposite Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 illustrates in the Fig. 4 . The saturation magnetization value of sample is 16.138 emu/g and indicates capability of separation of catalyst by outer magnetic field in order to reuse the reaction. 3.1.2.5 Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyze (FESEM-EDX) Morphological structures of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite was revealed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 5 ). Surface morphology of the sample appears as spherical shape with little agglomeration on the rough dark surface of the polymeric network. As shown in this figure, the size of catalyst particle is around 34 nm. Additionally, Fig. 6 shows energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the sample, in which iodo ratio at the Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 composite nanocatalyst was measured to be 1.13 w%, regarding that presence of other elements such as O, N, Fe and C in the composite is clearly observed."
7,Catalytic study,"3.2 Catalytic study In order to evaluate the performance of the synthesized catalyst nanocomposite of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2, the catalytic oxidation of benzylalcohols to benzaldehydes was investigated and the reaction progress was followed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Oxidation of benzylalcohols was carried out in a 25 mL round bottom flask that was placed in an oil bath under stirring and temperature-controlled condition. In model reaction, 4-Methylbenzylalcohol (1 mmol), TEMPO (0.015 g, 0.096 mmol) and 0.03 g catalyst were dissolved in 3 mL acetonitrile under magnetic stirring. Upon the completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the catalyst was separated by an outer magnet. Subsequently, the effect of reaction parameters on the oxidation reaction yield of benzylalcohols was studied (Fig. 7 ). 3.2.1 Influence of different parameters on yield reaction and optimization 3.2.1.1 Effect of catalyst loading Oxidation 4-methylbenzylalcohol was selected as a pattern reaction and the yield reaction was evaluated under a variety of conditions. In order to clarify the role and importance of the catalyst, the above reaction was performed with various amounts of the Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 catalyst, and the progress of the reaction was carefully pursued. The results are presented in Table 1 . Based on these results, it can easily be concluded that without the presence of catalyst (Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2) or based catalyst (Fe3O4-PANI-I), even after a prolonged reaction time, low yield of the corresponding product was achieved, indicating the reaction is effectively catalyzed with hypervalent iodine(III) (entry 1–3). Additionally to explore the effect of catalyst amount, the model reaction was performed with the various amounts of the synthesized catalyst. The oxidation reaction will clearly be promoted after increasing the Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 catalyst concentration to the solution (entries 4–6). As shown, with amount 0.03 g of the synthesized catalyst oxidation reaction is nearly completed. 3.2.1.2 Effect of TEMPO ratio Another factor effective in the conversion of benzylalcohols to benzaldehydes is effect of TEMPO ratio changes. Initially a series of TEMPO amounts were evaluated and then other factors were changed. Then, the model reaction was performed in the presence of various amounts of TEMPO in 70 °C and 0.03 g catalyst. However, the highest efficiency of the reaction was gained with applying 150 mg TEMPO at a certain temperature and time and further increase in the amount of TEMPO did not boost the yield of the product (entries 8–9). Obviously without TEMPO the reaction yield was low (entry 7). 3.2.1.3 Effect of reaction temperature After optimizing the catalyst amount and TEMPO ratio, we focused on the interaction between temperatures and yield of reaction. To detection of reaction temperature effect, several parallel reactions were carried out in the different temperatures such as room temperature, 50, 70 °C and reflux condition. The results revealed that increasing from room temperature to 70 °C can improve the efficiency of the reaction. Rise more temperature not only did not increase efficiency but also when the temperature was raised over 70 °C a decrease in reaction yield was observed which might be due to unavailability of required amount of acetonitrile as solvent in reaction mixture (entries 10–12). 3.2.1.4 Effect of solvent To elucidate the influence of the solvent type, performing of the oxidation reaction was investigated in various solvents including dichloro ethane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, toluene and THF (entries 13–18). As shown in Table 1 the obtained results clearly demonstrate that presence of solvent is a critical factor for this oxidation reaction and the reaction does not proceed in the absence of solvent (entry 19). In fact, carrying out the reaction in appropriate amount of CH3CN, led to nearly highest convert of model substrate with 92% yield, considering that the slightly increased amount of solvent did not effect in improvement of reaction. Aprotic nature and high dielectric constant of acetonitrile as solvent may be cause improving and increasing of yield of the products. 3.2.2 Study of the scope of the catalytic reaction After optimization of the reaction conditions, we investigated the generality and scope of the promoted protocol for the synthesis of various benzaldehydes. The various reactants bearing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were utilized to produce the corresponding benaldehydes in desirable yields. The results demonstrate the reaction for the benzyl alcohols with electron-withdrawing groups such as -NO2, -Br and -Cl decreased the rate of reaction and however longer reaction times to better performing of reaction were required in comparison with other benzyl alcohols. According to the obtained results and optimum conditions, the scrutiny of catalytic application of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 in the oxidation of benzylalcohols including 4-methoxy benzylalcohol, 2-hydroxy benzylalcohol and 4- methyl benzylalcohol exhibits good yield of reaction over catalyst nanocomposite. These results illustrated in Table 2 (TEMPO is utilized as the secondary oxidant). In fact, performing of the oxidation of various benzyl alcohols in condition's optimization demonstrated the reaction effectively was maintained at a high level, indicating that the Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 catalyst had a high effective for the oxidation of various benzyl alcohols into corresponding aldehydes without any byproduct."
8,Mechanistic evaluation,"3.3 Mechanistic evaluation According to studies [59–62] and in pursuit of understanding the mechanism of oxidation reaction, a catalytic cycle was designed in the existence of Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAC)2 catalyst nanocomposite and radical TEMPO, as illustrated in Fig. 8 . Oxoammonium salt (II) is an active species in the catalytic cycle process that in the first step can be produced through oxidation of primary nitroxyl radicals (I) with supported -I(OAc)2 partial on polymeric network. During the reaction, by nucleophilic attack of anionic alkoxide to the nitrogen atom in the cation of oxoammonium, alcohol is oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde and then through intramolecular transfer of the proton, the oxoammonium sal (III) is reduced to the hydroxylamine (IV). At the end of oxidation reaction of alcohol and in order to continue the catalytic cycle, hydroxylamine group by the initial oxidant can be oxidized, consequently nitroxyl radical is regenerated."
9,Catalyst's stability,"3.4 Catalyst's stability One of the valuable features for each catalyst from the viewpoint of its utilization in practical applications is its ability to be reused without reducing its performance. In present work, the synthesized catalyst nanocomposite could be easily retrieved from the model reaction via magnetic isolation and reused for at least five consecutive cycles in which the catalyst had not exhibited any appreciable loss of activity (Fig. 9 ). More evidences to confirm the stability and reusability of the catalyst was achieved via comparing the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 10 ). Since the resemblance of the results attained from reused and fresh catalysts is obvious, the stability and reusability of the catalyst is affirmed."
10,Comparison of catalytic activity with previous studies,"3.5 Comparison of catalytic activity with previous studies To shed light on be worthy of the current protocol, comparable works on the activities of the fabricated polymer-supported hypervalent iodine nanocatalyst with other of the previously reported approaches for the oxidation of benzylalcohols to corresponding benzaldehydes was investigated. From comparison of reported data, it is clearly seen that the other systems for showing better catalytic activity tolerate undesirable conditions including much longer reaction times and higher temperature also involve difficulties of catalyst separation from the reaction mixture [63–72]."
11,Conclusion,"Fe3O4-PANI-I(OAc)2 nanocomposite ascatalyst with particular properties such as eco-friendly, good efficiency, low-cost and simple separation was prepared in two convenient steps and applied for synthesis of benzaldehyde derivatives. One of the remarkable features at present work is synthesis of composite nanomaterial of PANI-I and Fe3O4 via impressive and green route of one-step solvothermal technique using single Fe3+ salt and the 2-iodoaniline, in which other additives, reductive reagents or surfactant in order to surface modification of Fe3O4 also oxidant for the polymerization of iodoaniline are not used. The nature of the materials used as supports for the preparation of the supported -I(OAc)2 partial play an important role during both the preparation stage and catalytic process. On the basis of gained results, synthesized composite has a good performance and is able to effective oxidation various benzylalcohols under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, the applied catalytic system exhibited a desirable stability and regenerated five runs without remarkable deactivating that was attributed to the good bonding of active catalytic partial with the polymeric support. Thus, in the field of development of highly effective catalyst for oxidation of alcohols, recyclability and stability advantages were well achieved in present work. Various characterization techniques (FT-IR, FESEM-EDX, XRD, VSM, and TGA) were used to confirm that the nanocomposite was formed."
