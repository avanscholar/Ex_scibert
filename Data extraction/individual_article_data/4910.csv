0,Introduction,"The origin of ethanol may be the key piece of information to define an alcohol-related case. Ethanol content is the most commonly requested analysis in forensic toxicology laboratories [1], including in cases of violence, sexual assault, motor vehicle accidents and other alcohol-related cases [2,3]. The single results of an ethanol content analysis have become increasingly likely to be questioned in court. Chinese media have recently reported many cases as follows: when lawyers were questioned, investigators could not exclude the possibility of contamination during sampling. Thus, the traditional evidence of alcohol consumption is rebutted by lawyers. Specific ethanol metabolites, such as ethyl glucuronide [4,5] and ethyl sulfate [6], are used to reflect alcohol consumption. However, in recent cases, lawyers have pointed out that the detected metabolites may be derived from alcohol consumption a long time before the incident due to the longer half-lives of these metabolites [7,8]. Novel markers such as iso-α-acids for alcohol consumption have been studied recently [9,10]. Using the logical relationship between ethanol-related compounds and ethanol itself, lawyers are still able to find new arguments. The stable carbon isotope naturally occurs in carbon-containing compounds, and it is a new indicator of the origin of ethanol. The stable carbon isotope is expressed as a δ13C value and is related to an international standard (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite, VPDB); this value has been used to determine the geographical origin of wine [11–14]. In forensic studies, the feasibility of the δ13C value is also being studied, such as in the analysis of explosives [15–17] and illegal drugs [18]. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of stable carbon isotope analysis in the determination of ethanol origins for forensic purposes. As a preliminary study, we chose beer as a typical example of alcohol consumption because it represents the largest market in China [19]. At the same time, disinfectants are chosen as the typical example of alcohol contamination, which has been a controversial issue in recent years. According to the approval of the ethics committee, non-invasive samples (urine and oral fluids) were used in this study. The δ13C values of ethanol in consumption bio-samples and in contamination bio-samples were compared."
1,Material and methods,
2,Reagents,"2.1 Reagents The n-alkane isotopic standard (Type A6) was purchased from Biogeochemical Laboratories, Indiana University (Bloomington, IN, USA). Wine ethanol certified reference material (BCR-660) was purchased from the Directorate F (health, consumer and reference materials), European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (Geel, Belgium). A series of ethanol standard solutions (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0mg/mL) were prepared with pure ethanol (analytical reagent, Linfeng, SH, China) in water. Acetonitrile (HPLC, gradient grade) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Water (LC/MS grade) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). tert-Butanol was purchased from Chem Service (Westchester, PA, USA) and diluted to 0.04mg/mL in water."
3,HS-GC-FID measurements,"2.2 HS-GC-FID measurements Headspace-gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID) analysis was performed following a previously described procedure [20] in which 0.1mL of urine or oral fluid was placed directly into a capped and sealed vial with 0.5mL of 0.04mg/mL tert-butanol (as an internal standard). After vortexing the sample for 30s, the vial was put on a 7697A headspace sampler (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The equilibration time and temperature were 10min and 65°C, respectively. Headspace vapor was injected into a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and separated in double columns (DB-ALC1: 30m×0.32mm i.d., 1.8μm film thickness; DB-ALC2: 30m×0.32mm i.d., 1.2μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 40°C. Ethanol was detected with double FIDs. The standard curve for ethanol was obtained by plotting the peak area ratio of ethanol to tert-butanol versus the standard ethanol series solution concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0mg/mL). The correlation coefficient of the method was greater than 0.999, the precision and accuracy of the method were less than 5%, the detection limit was 0.01mg/mL, and the limit of quantification was 0.1mg/mL."
4,GC–IRMS measurements,"2.3 GC–IRMS measurements Before gas chromatography–stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC–IRMS) analysis, samples were prepared by two different methods according to the ethanol content to remove the interference of endogenous substances, such as protein in the sample. Beer and disinfectant samples with high ethanol contents were diluted with acetonitrile to an ethanol concentration of approximately 1.0mg/mL. The urine and oral fluid samples with low ethanol contents were centrifugally separated at 12,000rpm for 5min, and then the supernatants were filtered by 0.22-mm nylon membranes. The GC–IRMS analysis was performed using a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected to an MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a GC Isolink combustion reactor interface (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). An HPINNOWAX column (30m×0.32mm i.d., 0.25-μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for chromatographic separation. The injection temperature was 200°C, the injection volume was 2μL, and the post-injection dwell time was 5s. The oven was programmed as follows: an initial temperature of 45°C for 3min, which was increased at a rate of 1°C/min to 52°C, then increased at a rate of 20°C/min to 200°C and kept at the final temperature for 2min. Helium was used as the carrier with an injection rate of 1mL/min. The combustion interface temperature was set to 1020°C. The CO2 reference gas pressure was 2 bars, and the gas was introduced into the IRMS at 30s, 850s and 900s for 20s each time. The back flush was switched off at 90s and switched on at 800s. The δ13C values were expressed against VPDB standard and were calculated using the formula (δ13C=[(13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)VPDB]−1). This calculation was performed using CO2 as a reference gas that was calibrated by an n-alkane isotopic standard (Type A6). BCR-660 was analyzed at the beginning of each sequence to test the accuracy of the instrument. Isodat 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) software was used for data acquisition and isotope value calculation. SPSS 19.0 (IBM, USA) was used for statistical calculations."
5,Validation of the GC–IRMS method,"2.4 Validation of the GC–IRMS method Selectivity was measured by pure ethanol, diluent (acetonitrile), wort (a simulated beer matrix), blank urine and blank oral fluid. The linear range was measured by a series of ethanol standard solutions (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0mg/mL). The method’s precision (represented by the standard deviation) and accuracy (represented by bias) were measured together on 7 different days using BCR-660."
6,Samples,2.5 Samples Beer samples (Table 1 ) and alcohol-containing disinfectant samples were purchased from supermarkets or online shops. Two types of wort were purchased from supermarkets.
7,Consumption and contamination experiments,"2.6 Consumption and contamination experiments Six volunteers (3 males and 3 females, ages 21–49years), who provided oral informed consent, were involved in the experiments. Urine samples (20mL) were collected in a plastic collector at each sampling point. To remove the residual beer in the mouth after consumption, all volunteers gargled with 100mL of drinking water after beer consumption. Then, oral fluid samples (5mL) were collected in a clean corning tube at each sampling point. All bio-samples were analyzed by HS-GC–MS and GC–IRMS within 6h after being collected. 2.6.1 Consumption experiment 1 Before the experiment, urine and oral fluid samples were collected from all 6 volunteers for ethanol-negative confirmation. The pasteurized Lager beer imports from Denmark (No. 40 in this study, with a wort concentration of 10.5°P, and fermented by barley) from the same barrel (net volume: 2000mL) were consumed by all the volunteers (each volunteer consumed approximately 330mL). Urine and oral fluid samples were collected 1h later. 2.6.2 Consumption experiment 2 Before the experiment, urine and oral fluid samples were collected from volunteer #1 for ethanol-negative confirmation. The pasteurized Lager beer imports from Germany (No. 41 in this study, with a wort concentration of 17.0°P fermented by barley and with a net volume of 500mL) were consumed by volunteer #1. Urine and oral fluid samples were collected at 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, and 6h after consumption. After 2 days, urine and oral fluid samples were collected again from volunteer #1 for ethanol-negative confirmation. Then, the pasteurized ale beer imports from Germany (No. 42 in this study with a wort concentration of 11.2°P fermented by barley and cane sugar and with a net volume of 500mL) were consumed as described previously. Similarly, urine and oral fluid samples were collected at 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, and 6h after consumption. 2.6.3 Contamination experiment The ethanol-negative urine and oral fluid samples were used as blank samples. Then, 20μL of alcohol-containing disinfectant was added to 10mL of the blank sample one by one to prepare the contaminated samples."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Method validation,"3.1 Method validation The selectivity of the GC–IRMS method was assessed by absolute ethanol, diluent (acetonitrile), wort, blank urine and blank oral fluid. The retention time of ethanol was obtained via absolute ethanol analysis with a small sample volume (0.2μL) and a high split ratio (200:1). Fig. 1 A shows a typical GC–IRMS chromatogram of ethanol. There were no interfering peaks in the retention window of ethanol (Fig. 1B–E). Fig. 1F–H shows typical GC–IRMS chromatograms of a beer sample, urine sample and oral fluid sample, respectively. In a previous study by Ai, acetonitrile was used instead of water as the solvent for the δ13C analysis of ethanol in alcoholic beverages by GC/IRMS [21]. In this study, we used acetonitrile as the diluent because it can eliminate protein in beer and avoid the blocking of chromatographic columns. Fig. 2 contains a plot of the mean intensities for the m/z 44 peak amplitude (mV) at ethanol concentrations from 0.1 to 3.0mg/mL and a plot of δ13C values from ethanol at concentrations from 0.1 to 3.0mg/mL. As an integrated result, accurate δ13C values could be obtained when the sample signal for the m/z 44 peak was near 1000–10,000mV. Therefore, it was better to control the concentration of ethanol in the sample to be within 0.5 to 2.0mg/mL. Because of this limitation, we have adopted different pretreatment methods for two kinds of samples with different ethanol concentrations. The observed δ13C values of ethanol in BCR-660 over a 7-day period were −27.2‰ to −26.7‰. The nominal δ13C value of ethanol in BCR-660 was −26.7‰. The standard deviation (precision) observed over 7days was 0.2‰, and the biases (accuracy) of the observed date from the certified date were less than 1.8%. To avoid the isotopic fractionation caused by heating during the headspace process, we selected another processing method different from GC-FID analysis. The verification data showed that direct dilution and filtration led to good precision and accuracy."
10,Reference δ13C values of ethanol in beer,"3.2 Reference δ13C values of ethanol in beer First, 10 bottles of No. 1 beer and 10 cans of No. 2 beer with different production dates were analyzed to determine whether the different production dates (batches) affect the δ13C value of ethanol in beer. According to the standard deviation test, the standard deviation was less than 0.5‰. Production dates do not affect the δ13C value. Next, δ13C values of ethanol in 42 types of beer were analyzed (Table 1). Similar to the research by Brooks et al. [22], the distribution of the δ13C value of ethanol in beer was bimodal, with one peak ranging from −29.5‰ to −25.4‰ and the other ranging from −20.1‰ to −18.4‰. The dates grouped by the fermentative method showed significant differences (P<0.01) according to the t-tests. In fact, this difference was related to the botanical origin (Fig. 3 ). All lager beer samples analyzed in this study used C3 ingredients, such as barley, wheat and rice. The ale beer samples analyzed in this study had a higher isotopic ratio because C4 plants (such as cane and corn) were mixed in the ingredients. Due to the different carbon dioxide absorption pathways, the δ13C values of C3 plants ranged from approximately −34‰ to −22‰, while the δ13C values of C4 plants ranged from −17‰ to −11‰ [23]. Similar to Brooks’ results [22], the median δ13C value of ethanol in beer samples with all C3 ingredients was −26.9‰. After adding C4 plants as ingredients, the median δ13C values of ethanol increased to −18.6‰. Further, the distribution of δ13C values of the beer samples with C3 ingredients was bimodal. The δ13C values of ethanol in unpasteurized beer samples ranged from −27.0‰ to −25.4‰ and ranged from −29.5‰ to −26.8‰ for pasteurized beers. This difference may have originated from the temperature difference during the process, as pasteurized beer is heated and disinfected at approximately 60°C [24]. Different producers or wort concentrations did not significantly affect the δ13C values of ethanol in beer with C3 ingredients (P>0.05)."
11,Reference δ13C values of ethanol in disinfectants,"3.3 Reference δ13C values of ethanol in disinfectants The δ13C values of ethanol in 11 types of alcohol-containing disinfectants ranged from −17.7‰ to −14.4‰ (Table 2 ). In China, commercialized ethanol is mainly derived from corn, a typical C4 plant [25,26]. In this study, 11 types of best-selling alcohol-containing disinfectants from Chinese online shops were bought as samples. As expected, all of these disinfectants had higher δ13C values than those in beer samples."
12,The difference between the δ13C values in consumption and contamination samples,"3.4 The difference between the δ13C values in consumption and contamination samples In consumption experiment 1, 6 volunteers consumed No. 40 beer (δ13C=−28.0‰) from the same barrel, and urine and oral fluids were collected 1h later and analyzed. The δ13C values of ethanol ranged from −27.3‰ to −26.7‰ in urine and from −27.3‰ to −26.3‰ in oral fluids (Table 3 ). The δ13C values of ethanol in all bio-samples were compared with the No. 40 beer. The differences were less than 1.3‰ for urine and less than 1.7‰ for oral fluid. In consumption experiment 2, volunteer #1 consumed No. 41 beer (δ13C=−27.9‰) and No. 42 beer (δ13C=−18.4‰) on two different days. Urine and oral fluids were collected at 0 (before beer consumed), 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6h after consumption. The δ13C values of ethanol ranged from −27.9‰ to −27.5‰ in urine and ranged from −27.7‰to −27.3‰ in oral fluids after consuming No. 41 beer (Table 4 ). The δ13C values of ethanol in urine and oral fluids after consuming No. 42 beer ranged from −18.2‰ to −18.0‰ and from −18.8‰ to −18.2‰, respectively (Table 5 ). Similar to experiment 1, differences in the δ13C values between the bio-samples and beer were calculated one by one. The differences were less than 0.6‰. In the contamination experiment, contaminated urine and oral fluid samples were analyzed (Table 2). The δ13C values of ethanol ranged from −17.8‰ to −14.2‰ in urine and from −17.9‰ to −14.5‰ in oral fluids after being contaminated. The differences in δ13C values between contaminated bio-samples and disinfectants were less than 0.4‰. The results of these experiments show that the isotopic characteristics (δ13C value) of ethanol can be transferred to the bio-samples, regardless of consumption or contamination. The δ13C value of ethanol with a pure C3 origin in urine and oral fluid was lower than −25.0‰, and the δ13C value of ethanol with a pure C4 origin in urine and oral fluid was higher than −18.0‰ (Fig. 3). This obvious data difference shows the potential of stable carbon isotope analysis to determine the origin of ethanol in vivo. Because most alcoholic beverages are from C3 plants [27] and most non-edible alcohol is produced from C4 plants [28], stable carbon isotope analysis can provide data on consumption and contamination. However, some alcoholic beverages are brewed with C4 plants (such as vodka, bourbon whisky and rum), and the production of ethanol from residues of C3 plants (such as wheat [29]) has also become a recent research direction. The origin of ethanol is not clear when it comes from a mixture of C3 and C4 plants. The inadequate differentiation of the ethanol origin by δ13C values may require stable oxygen isotope values and stable hydrogen isotope values."
13,Analysis of a sample in an authentic case,"3.5 Analysis of a sample in an authentic case In a traffic accident, the blood alcohol content of the driver was detected to be 0.82mg/mL. According to Chinese law, an individual with a blood alcohol content greater than 0.80mg/mL should be prosecuted for criminal liabilities. The driver argued that he did not drink alcohol before the accident and that his blood was contaminated by alcohol swabs when drawing the blood. He said that he saw the nurse use a tincture for skin disinfection. The police investigated the hospital where the blood draws were performed. They found that the hospital purchased two kinds of disinfectants, a tincture (red bottle) and an alcohol-free sterile swab (blue bottle). In the absence of more information, the driver was going to be acquitted. The driver’s urine was analyzed, and the δ13C value of ethanol in the urine was −28.4‰. This value indicates that the origin of ethanol detected in the urine originated from C3 plants. For further confirmation, we analyzed the tincture provided by the hospital. The δ13C value of ethanol in the tincture was −15.0‰, which was obviously different from the ethanol present in the urine of the driver. We speculate that the driver had consumed alcohol. According to our analysis, the police believed that the driver was suspected of lying. By replaying the surveillance video, the police found two important points. First, the hospital used a sterile swab from a blue bottle when drawing blood from the driver. Second, half an hour before the traffic accident, the driver exited a restaurant. By comparing the driver’s credit card records and restaurant bill records, it was proven that the driver consumed 2 bottles of beer in the restaurant before the accident. According to the police investigation, the type of beer consumed by the driver was the same as the No. 19 beer sample (δ13C=−28.4‰) in this study. This finding was consistent with our analytical data (the δ13C value of ethanol in the urine was also −28.4‰). In a comprehensive survey, the police uncovered the truth and forced the driver to assume the criminal responsibility he deserved."
14,Conclusion,"The δ13C values of ethanol in beer and disinfectant samples were measured. The stable carbon isotope characteristics of beer have the botanical features of C3 plants or a mixture of C3 and C4 plants. The isotopic characteristics of commercial alcohol are relatively simple, only showing the botanical features of C4 plants. These characteristics were transferred to bio-samples without changes in consumption and contamination experiments. Through the application of a case, the potential and value of stable isotope analysis technology in forensic analysis was explained. More studies need to be conducted on how to describe the origin of mixed botanical ethanol."
