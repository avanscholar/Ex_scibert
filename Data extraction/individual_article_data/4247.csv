0,Introduction,"The utilization of light through water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is a benign and sustainable pathway to partially address today’s energy crisis and greenhouse effects. Developing suitable high-efficiency catalysts for the photocatalytic hydrogen production has attracted intensive attention in the academic community [1–8]. The traditional metal oxide catalysts, for instance TiO2, are widely studied for hydrogen production but they only absorb ultraviolet light, resulting in limited efficiency solar utilization [9]. Graphitic carbon nitride (graphitic CN or g-C3N4), the typical metal-free semiconductor, has recently been considered as the unique catalyst for the photocatalytic H2 evolution due to its excellent visible light absorption and suitable band valence (2.7 eV) [2,10,11]. Wang et al. firstly reported that the photocatalytic H2 and O2 production by water splitting could be accelerated over g-C3N4, herein, much exciting work was initiated to investigate the effect of the physical and chemical properties of C3N4 on enhancing the photocatalytic activities [10,12–17]. So far, pure g-C3N4 with C/N atomic ratio of 0.75 still faces various challenges in the photocatalytic field, such as the limited photon absorption edge at around 450 nm, severe combination of photogenerated electrons and holes, low specific surface area, and so on [10,18–20]. Considerable effort has been devoted in order to overcome those challenges and improve the photocatalytic performance of pure bulk g-C3N4 [3,21]. For example, the porosity and unique surface structure of g-C3N4 was found to facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants, which improved the photocatalytic performance under visible light [22]. The hollow mesoporous g-C3N4 sphere with high surface area and porosity also exhibited an increased light absorption in visible range, and faster separation rate of hole and electron than those of bulk g-C3N4 [23]. Additionally, the electric and optical properties were usually changed when the bulk g-C3N4 was exfoliated into nanosheet structure [24–26]. Xu et al reported that g-C3N4 nanosheets with single atomic layer thickness of 0.4 nm showed a superiority in the separation and transformation of photogenerated charge carriers, obtaining a 2.6-fold higher H2 production rate (λ > 420 nm) than that of bulk g-C3N4 [24]. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 was enhanced by assembling one dimensional structure into two- or three-dimensional structure [3,27]. Zhu et al. reported that the photocurrent intensity and photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 nanorods were 2.0 and 1.5 times higher than the nanoplate samples, respectively [27]. The introduction of defect sites (vacancies, heteroatom doping and chemical defects) or controlling of surface functionality were believed to be another important approach to tune the activity of photocatalysis [28–30]. The C or N defects in g-C3N4 usually can adjust the energy band structure, broaden the light absorption range, and act as the active sites in the reaction system [31–36]. For example, N vacancies of g-C3N4 could restrict the recombination of electrons/holes pairs, and broadened the visible light absorbance from 450 to 600 nm [37]. The N vacancies produced by the occupation of H atoms into g-C3N4 could reduce the band gap from 2.7 to 2.0 eV [38]. Zhang et al. reported that the introduction of N defects (cyano groups and surface N vacancies) into g-C3N4 would increase the conduction band (CB) from −1.17 to −0.85 eV [32]. Zhao et al also found that the porous g-C3N4 with chemical defects (groups and nitrogen vacancies) exhibited higher light-harvesting capability and charge separation efficiency than those of bulk g-C3N4, leading to a 26 times higher H2 evolution rate than that of pristine g-C3N4 under the visible light irradiation [33]. When the N vacancy was around 7%, mainly from the framework of the heptazine ring, the band gap would be efficiently narrowed about 0.75 eV [39]. Surface functionality was reported as the significant factor for enhancing the catalytic performance as well. Chen et al. found that the reduced g-C3N4 with abundant N vacancies and oxygen-containing functional groups (CO and CO), reduced CB and VB of g-C3N4 from −0.75 eV to −0.5 eV and from 2.05 eV to 2.03 eV, respectively. Moreover, the improved separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers by those functionalities could offer 9-folds higher photocatalytic activity and 8-folds photocurrent responses than that of pure g-C3N4 [34]. Overall O doping and N vacancies in g-C3N4 were reported to be the significant factors in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for H2 production. However, the intrinsic roles of the O and N element in the g-C3N4 for affecting the catalytic performance are still unclear [34,36]. Since the heteroatoms, e.g., O atoms, were usually introduced simultaneously with N vacancies [15,31,32,34,40]. In this work, fibrous g-C3N4 samples with the controllable N vacancies and surface functional groups were synthesized in a simple and effective way. The nitric acid (HNO3) as the significant additive was added into melamine solution to tune the physical and chemical property of g-C3N4 samples. Although there are some researches demonstrated that acid treatment could modulate the morphology and surface chemistry of g-C3N4 [24,41–44]. They did not fully investigate the underlying influence factor of the obtained C3N4 samples on the catalytic performance. The crystal form, chemical component, surface structure, light absorption property, electronic behavior, and the H2 production properties of the g-C3N4 samples were comprehensively studied. The results showed that the N defects and surface functional groups significantly affect the catalytic efficiency for the H2 production. The intrinsic relationships between the C, N atom, surface functionality, and the catalytic performance were revealed as well."
1,Experimental section,
2,Synthesis of g-C3N4 samples,"2.1 Synthesis of g-C3N4 samples The bulk g-C3N4 sample was prepared according to the literature [10]. Typically, 3.0 g melamine was heated directly in the argon atmosphere at 550 °C for 4.0 h with a heating rate of 2.0 °C/min. The obtained pristine g-C3N4 sample was named CN0. Porous fibrous N-defected g-C3N4 (CNx, x = 1–5) was prepared as follows. 3.0 g melamine was dissolved in 200 mL deionized water and heated to 90 °C with vigorous agitation. Varying amounts of HNO3 solution was then added into the solution drop by drop. The precipitate of white fibers was obtained when the solution was cooled down to room temperature (see Fig. S1). After that, the precipitates were filtered and washed by deionized water, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. Thus, the precursor of CNx (pre-CNx) was obtained. Afterwards, the pre-CNx was annealed in the Ar atmosphere at 550 °C for 4 h with the heat rate at 2 °C/min to obtain the g-C3N4 sample. In this synthesis procedure, the molar ratios of C3N6H6/HNO3 were adjusted at 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5, and the corresponding g-C3N4 samples were named CNx (x = 1–5). Bulk g-C3N4 sample without HNO3 treatment undergo the same procedure as the synthesis of CNx, named as non-HNO3-CN. The preparation process was as following: 3.0 g melamine was dissolved in 200 mL deionized water in 90 °C with vigorous agitation for two hours. After that, the solution was cooled down to room temperature naturally. And the precipitates were filtered and dried at 60 °C overnight. The precursor of non-HNO3-CN was obtained, and it was annealed in the Ar atmosphere at 550 °C for 4 h with the heat rate of 2 °C/min to obtain non-HNO3-CN sample."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The crystalline phases of the CN samples were measured by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) using a Cu Kα irradiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å, 35 kV and 40 mA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on an infrared spectrometer (VERTEX 33, Bruker). The 13C MAS NMR spectra were obtained by a superconducting Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer at room temperature (AVANCE III HD 400, Bruker). Raman spectra were measured by a confocal laser micro-Raman spectrometer with excitation wavelength of 325 nm (Renishaw in Via-Reflex Raman spectroscopy). The BET surface areas, average pore width, and pore volume of all samples were recorded on a BELSORP-max instrument (BEL Japan Inc.) The surface chemical state and valence band (VB) position of CNx samples were tested on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Escalab 250xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 15 kV Al Kα X-ray at 150 W (hʋ = 1486.6 eV). The elemental analyzer (EA, Vario EL cube, Elementar) was used to identify the content of C, N, O and H. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected by SU8220 microscope (5 kV, HITACHI, Japan) with energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) (X-MaxN20, Oxford, England). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100F microscope (200 KV, 90 µA). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-2600). The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were collected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) with 330 nm excitation wavelength. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were performed on a A300 EPR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) operating at room temperature with micro frequency at 9.86 GHz."
4,Photocatalytic H2 production and AQE measurement,"2.3 Photocatalytic H2 production and AQE measurement Light-driven H2 evolution was performed in a hermetic CEL-SPH2N photocatalytic H2 production system (CEAULIGHT, China). 10 mg catalyst was dispersed into 150 mL aqueous solution with 10 vol% methanol. 1.0 wt% Pt as co-catalyst was in-situ photo-deposited on the catalyst surface using H2PtCl6 as the precursor. Before the reaction, the solution was vacuumed for about 30 min to remove air completely in the aqueous solution. And then the photocatalytic reaction was launched by using a 300 W Xenon lamp. Pt was deposited under full-spectrum light for 1 h, and then the H2 generation was carried out under visible light irradiation (with >400 nm filter). The produced H2 was determined by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Fuli in China) equipped with molecular sieve 5A packed column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated following the method described by Qiao et al. [21]. The 150 mL aqueous solution with 10 vol% methanol and 50.0 mg catalyst with 1.0 wt% Pt was irradiated for 1 h by 300 W Xenon lamp using a 405, 420, 450, 475, and 550 nm bandpass filters, respectively. The average intensity of irradiation was measured to be 286.0, 244.0, 242.7, 356.3 and 256.0 W/m2, respectively. And the irradiation area was about 28.3 cm2. AQE was calculated by the following Eq. (1): (1) AQE = 2 × Number of evolved H 2 molecules Number of incident photons × 100 %"
5,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements The transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, initial voltage of −0.1 V) and Mott-Schottky tests (1000 Hz) of CNx were conducted with a CHI 760 electrochemical analyzer in a conventional three-electrode cell with a counter electrode (Pt plate), reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode) and working electrode. The working electrode was prepared by a spreading slurry of the catalyst (50 µL) over FTO glass substrate. The suspension was prepared by dispersing catalyst (10 mg) and polyethylene glycol (PEG 2000, 0.06 g) in absolute ethyl alcohol (1 mL). Then the FTO glass coated by the catalyst was dried at 60 °C overnight. After that, the electrode was annealed at 400 °C for 1 h with heating rate at 10 °C/min under a flow of Ar gas. The supporting electrolyte was an 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Morphology and structure,"3.1 Morphology and structure Fig. 1 a presents the schematic synthetic process of modified CNx (x = 1–5), a rod-like structure of the samples (precursors of CNx) can be obtained from the reaction of HNO3 and melamine, and a fibrillar structure with porous layers is formed after the precursors was annealed to CNx. The surface morphologies of melamine and CNx precursors are shown in Fig. S1. Bulk structure with relatively smooth surface of melamine was observed (Fig. S1a). A rod-like structure (around 2 µm diameter) with smooth surface was obtained because the addition of HNO3 (melamine: HNO3 = 1 M ratio) in the synthesis process modified the structure of pre-CN (Fig. S1b) [45,46]. When the dosage of HNO3 increased, the length of rods increased and the thin rods stacked together to form thicker rods (5–10 µm) (Fig. S1c–f). The precursors were annealed at 550 °C to produce pristine and modified g-C3N4 samples, and their morphology structures are shown in Fig. 1b–g. It can be clearly seen that CN0 contained the bulk structure with a few pores, while the modified CNx displayed the porous fibrillar structure with layers. The TEM images (Fig. 1h–i) further confirm that the modified CN contained the mesoporous in the layers. The elemental mapping images show that the C, N and O elements were well dispersed in CN3 matrix (Fig. 1j). As shown in the Fig. S2 and Table S1, the BET specific surface areas of modified CNx obviously increased from 12.61 to 20.53 m2/g compared with CN0 (8.71 m2/g), due to HNO3 modification. Whereas, it is worth noting that the average pore width and pore volume in CNx decreased, which was probably due to the much smaller average pores in CN1–CN5 than that in CN0 (Fig. S2). Fig. 2 a shows the XRD patterns of all samples. The typical peaks centered at 13.0° and 27.4° in CN0 were attributed to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) lattice planes, which corresponded to the in-plane structural packing of s-triazine ring units and π-π inter-planar stacking peak of conjugated aromatic system of g-C3N4, respectively [10,12,27]. For modified CNx (CN1 to CN5), the peak at 13.0° disappeared while the peak at 27.4° with reduced intensity and broadened width was obtained. This result demonstrates that the long-rang order in atomic arrangements was destroyed in modified CNx [12,47], indicating rich defects in g-C3N4 due to HNO3 modification. Moreover, a slight shift of (0 0 2) lattice plane from 27.4° for CN0 to 26.8° for CN1–CN5 was observed. Based on Bragg’s law (2dsinθ = nλ), the slight shift of (0 0 2) peak was caused by the increase of interlayer stacking distance from 0.324 nm for CN0 to 0.330 nm for CN1–CN5, due to the slightly loosened packing of the conjugated systems [47,48]. FTIR spectra were utilized to analyze the chemical structure of the samples (Fig. 2b). The featured peaks at 810 and 1200–1650 cm−1 corresponding to typical g-C3N4 features were observed in these CNx samples [19,49]. The skeletal vibrations of aromatic CN heterocycles aroused several strong peaks in the 1200–1650 cm−1 region [19]. And the characteristic breathing vibration of triazine units brought the peak at about 810 cm−1 [19]. A remarkably broad peak at around 3000–3600 cm−1 was observed, which is generated from the surface-bonded N-Hx or OH bands, relating to uncondensed amino groups and absorbed H2O [47]. In order to verify the N-Hx species in CNx, the NMR 13C spectrum was applied. In Fig. 2c, all the CNx samples showed two peaks at 158 and 166 ppm, which were attributed to the chemical shifts of C(N)3 and C(N)2 NHx (x = 1, 2), respectively [39]. The intensity ratio of C(N)3 and C(N)2 NHx decreased from 0.786 for CN0 to 0.468 for CN3 (based on the equation: R = I C - ( N ) 3 / I C - ( N ) 2 - N H x ), and the R of CN1–CN5varied between 0.5 and 0.4. The lower R values of CN1–CN5 than that of CN0 indicates that the tri-triazine units of modified CNx could be broken to produce more NHx groups in this procedure. Another difference result in the FTIR spectra was that a new vibration peak at 2180 cm−1 emerged in modified CNx, which arose from CN or NC group, could be considered as an indicator of defective surface sites on the modified CNx [29,32,39,48–51]. To further explore the molecular structure of modified CNx, Raman spectral technology was used. Based on the literature, the vibration peak of CN group is typically centered at the range of 2219–2240 cm−1 [52], which has been covered in our study. As seen from the Fig. 2d, there is no apparent peak at 2219–2240 cm−1, indicating no CN group was not produced in this work. Therefore, the new peak at 2180 cm−1 in FTIR spectra of modified CNx should be assigned to NC. The characteristic peaks of Raman spectra for g-C3N4 at 479, 579, 705, 768, and 1200–1650 cm−1, which corresponded to the vibration modes of CN heterocycles [18,26,50], existed in all the samples. These results indicated that all the CNx samples contained the essential framework of melon, which is consistent with the FTIR results in Fig. 2b (the characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 at 810 and 1200–1650 cm−1). However, the peak of CN0 at 768 cm−1 shifted to 755 cm−1 of CN1–CN5, which was also observed in other g-C3N4 thin films, owning to the phonon confinement effect of the thin layers of g-C3N4 [26,53]. It was noted that two peaks at 1060 and 1112 cm−1 were obtained in CN0, which could be assigned to primary alcohol and tertiary alcohol functionalities, respectively [54]. In contrast, the peak of Raman spectra at 1060 cm−1 disappear and the intensity of peak at 1112 cm−1 is weaker in CN1–CN5. Meanwhile, the intensity of the peak at 1161 cm−1, belonging to unsaturated ketone (CO), increased remarkably [54]. These results demonstrated that there were more abundant CO than COH groups produced in modified CNx through HNO3 modification in the synthesis procedure. To further investigate the variation of the chemical state and elemental composition of the obtained CNx samples, the XPS and EA measurements were employed. The EA results show the element contents in the whole matrix of samples, including bulk phase and surface distribution, while the XPS results represent the element distribution on the sample surface. Based on the EA analysis, the relative quantities of C, N, H and O atoms in CNx have been revealed, showing the successfully doping of O atoms in the whole matrix of modified samples. The C/N ratios of 0.66–0.68 from EA results in CNx samples are consistent with the literature [34]. The slight increase of C/N ratios from EA results (0.01–0.02 wt%) reveals the tiny N loss in the bulk phases of CNx through the HNO3 treatment. From the XPS results, the chemical structure of CNx and its surface functionalities were revealed. In this work, three peaks at 288, 399 and 532 eV ascribed to C, N and O elements, respectively, were observed in all samples (Fig. S3). High-resolution deconvolution of O1s XPS spectra was carried out in Fig. 3 . Two peaks fitted at 531.2 and 533.7 eV were obtained. The peak at 531.2 eV is assigned to CO or CO (CO/CO) groups, while peak at 533.7 eV is OH species [34,36,55]. Compared with CN0, the peaks of CO/CO groups and OH species slightly shifted to a higher binding energy in the modified CNx samples, showing a decreasing electron density on O atoms [56,57]. Compared with CN0, the content of oxygen obviously increased in CN1–CN5, and the O(-C=O/C-O)/OH-O atomic ratios of increased significantly from 0.92 for CN0 to 7.23 for CN3 (Table S3), while the ratios of CN4 and CN5 are 4.39 and 4.91, respectively. The enhancing O(-C=O/C-O)/OH-O atomic ratios of modified CNx suggest that HNO3 modification would produce the CO/CO species on the surface, which consistent with the results of Raman spectra in Fig. 2d. According to the high-resolution deconvolution of C1s XPS spectra, three components centered at around 288.1, 286.3 and 284.7 eV were obtained (Fig. 3), corresponding to sp2 hybridized C (NCN) in aromatic skeleton rings, CNHx (x = 1, 2) at the edge of heptazine units and sp2 hybrid orbital energy level of the exogenous CC bond, respectively [33–35]. The CN-C=N/C-C atomic ratio decreased from CN0 to CN5, while the content of CNHx in CNx (x = 3, 4 and 5) increased significantly (Table S4). This result also demonstrates that the HNO3 treatment would cause more CNHx groups (consistent with NMR 13C result in Fig. 2c) and sp2 C in CNx than CN0. According to the XPS survey (Table S2), the contents of C atoms in the modified CNx are a little varied from 41.36 (CN0) to 47.68 at.% (CN4), while the contents of N atoms show an obvious decrease (CN0: 57.08, CN5: 48.53). The C/N atomic ratio for CN0 was 0.73, which was close to the theoretical value of traditional g-C3N4 (0.75) [32]. The C/N atomic ratio increased significantly from CN1 to CN5, and the highest ratio of 1.01 was obtained in the CN4, demonstrating that HNO3 modification could cause more N loss in modified CNx. In order to reveal the intrinsic role of N functionalities in the catalytic performance clearly, the high-resolution deconvolution of the N1s XPS spectra for CNx was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3, three components located at about 398.6, 399.9 and 401.0 eV were obtained, which arose from sp2 hybridized N in CNC or CNC (N2C), bridging N in N(C)3 (N3C) and N-Hx group in the heptazine framework, respectively [58]. The slight red shifts of N3C and N-NHx species were observed from CN0 to CN5, suggesting an increase electron density on the N atoms [57]. Considering the blue shifts of O species together with the redshifts of N species (Fig. 3), it is clear that the electrons transferred from the O to N atoms on the surface of samples [56,57]. The main component was the N2C, with much higher content than the other two components, N3C and N-Hx (Table S5). The contents of N-Hx species in modified CNx were much higher than CN0, revealing that some of the tri-triazine was destroyed after HNO3 modification, which was consistent with the result of NMR 13C in Fig. 2c. At the same time, low N2C/N3C ratios of modified CNx was observed, suggesting that the loss of N atoms mainly occurred at N2C lattice sites in modified CNx [40]. To further understand the effect of N defects in all the CNx samples, EPR spectra for probing unpaired electrons over all the samples were presented. As shown in Fig. 4 , the EPR spectra of all samples show a very strong signal at 3503 G with a g = 2.005, which is assigned to the π-conjugated aromatic rings of g-C3N4 [59]. C/N atomic ratio (0.73) and N2C/N3C atomic ratio (6.04) of CN0 were very close to the theoretical values of g-C3N4 (C/N atomic ratio of 0.75 and N2C/N3C atomic ratio of 6.00), indicating very few N atoms were lost in CN0 (Tables S2 & S5). Therefore, the high EPR signal of CN0 could be probably ascribed to the unpaired electron on the O atoms of OH (Table S3). And the EPR signal of CN1 was higher than that of CN0, mainly caused by N vacancies at N2C site (Fig. 4) [60,61]. Furthermore, the EPR signals of CN1 to CN5 decreased unexpectedly, suggesting that the content of N vacancies decreased. Based on the aforementioned results, we have demonstrated that the amounts of N loss at N2C site and O atoms increase from CN1 to CN5 gradually (Table S2). It is probably that the O atoms replaced the N atoms at N2C sites, causing the decrease of N vacancy in modified CNx, as shown in Fig. 5 . Therefore, we believe that the loss of N atom and O replacement for N atom at N2C sites could make the decrease of N2C/N3C atomic ratio in this work."
8,Optical and electrochemical properties,"3.2 Optical and electrochemical properties The light-harvesting capability, recombination rate and transfer of photo-generated charge carries are the important factors for the CNx samples, which display significant influences on the photocatalytic performance [33]. The UV–vis DRS were utilized to investigate the photo-absorption ability and the energy gap of the catalysts (Fig. 6 a). The photo-absorption edge of CN0 was found to be 460 nm, while a significant enhancing absorption edge of modified CNx (550–579 nm) was observed, indicating that the modified CNx was more photo-responsive than the CN0 sample (Fig. 6a). The larger light absorption edge in modified CNx could be attributed to the reflections of incoming light at the pore surface in the nano-layers [48]. It is reported that the quantum confinement effect could be enhanced by the exfoliated CN layers, thereby resulting in the larger band gap (Eg ) (Fig. 6b) [3,24,37,48]. Generally, g-C3N4 is believed as the direct band gap semiconductors. In this study, the characteristics of direct band gap over modified CNx samples displayed no significant variation after the HNO3 modification. The results of XPS spectra (Fig. 6c) revealed that VB of modified CNx are lower than pristine CN0, indicating that VB maximum of CNx, resulted from the layered structure with defects, could be efficiently adjusted by HNO3 modification. The maximum VB values of CN0, CN1, CN2, CN3, CN4 and CN5 obtained by XPS were calculated to be 1.33, 1.42, 1.55, 1.48, 1.39 and 1.46 eV vs. NHE, respectively [62]. The PL spectrum demonstrated that the emission peak of CN0 was around 460 nm (Fig. 6d), which was the typical peak for g-C3N4 [23,63]. A 10–25 nm redshift of the emission peak in modified CNx was observed, which is contrast to the UV–vis DRS result (Fig. 6a). It might be caused by the change of Eg [63,64]. Moreover, the intensities of PL signal for modified CNx became lower, indicating that the recombination rate of the electrons and holes under light irradiation was greatly inhibited due to the synergistic effect of the unique geometry structure and nitrogen defect over the modified CNx [3,33,37,48]. Charge transfer in CNx is another significant factor, which greatly affects the photocurrent efficiency. From Fig. 7 a, the diameters of Nyquist plot increased from CN0 to CN5, displaying an enhanced resistance for the charge transfer after modification [31,33], which is probably caused by the porous structure and the damage of the long-rang order in atomic arrangements of g-C3N4. To determine the charge carrier density and band structures of all samples, Mott-Schottky analysis was conducted. For n-type semiconductors, the Mott-Schottky curves of CN0 and modified CNx are plotted according to the following equation [65]: (2) 1 C 2 = 2 N D e ε ε 0 E - E fb - k B T e where C is the space charge capacitance, ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (5.25 for C3N4) and permittivity in vacuum (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−2), e represents the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ND represents the number of donors for n-type semiconductors, E and Efb are the applied voltage and flat-band potential, respectively. T and kB represent the Kelvin temperature and Boltzmann constant, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7b, positive slopes are observed in the curves of all samples, demonstrating n-type semiconductor features.[59,65] Descending gradients was observed in the modified CNx. According to the intercepts of the plots on the E axis, the flat-band potentials (Efb vs. Ag/AgCl) of CN0, CN1, CN2, CN3, CN4 and CN5 are determined to be about −1.16, 1.03, 0.91, 1.12, 0.90, 0.95 V, respectively [65]. The normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential can be calculated through the Eq. (3) [59,65]: (3) E fb ( v s . N H E ) = E fb ( p H = 0 , v s . A g / A g C l ) + E AgCl + 0.059 × p H where the pH value of the electrolyte is around 6.8, and EAgCl is 0.197 V. Therefore, the calculated flat-band potentials (vs. NHE) of CN0–CN5 are −0.56, −0.43, −0.32, −0.53, −0.30 and −0.35, respectively. The carrier density (ND/cm−3) can be confirmed by the slope in the Mott-Schottky curves of all samples Fig. 7b [65]. (4) N D = 2 e ε ε 0 dE d 1 C 2 = 2 e ε ε 0 1 slope The ND of CN0 (2.39 × 1023 cm−3) is lower than that of modified CNx (the ND of CN1–CN5 are 4.26 × 1023, 4.20 × 1023, 5.42 × 1023, 2.88 × 1023 and 3.60 × 1023 cm−3, respectively), while the ND of CN3 is the highest among all samples. Fig. 7c shows the transient photocurrent responses of CNx samples coated on FTO glass. The detected photocurrent was caused mainly by the separation and diffusion of photoinduced electron-hole pairs from the inner structure of the photocatalyst to the free charge acceptors on its surface or the electrolyte [33]. In current work, the increased photocurrent of CNx (Fig. 7c) was mainly caused by the higher carrier density (Fig. 7b) and the improved separation of electrons and holes pairs (Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the photocurrent first increased then decreased from CN1 to CN5, and CN3 displays the highest photocurrent."
9,Photocatalytic H2 evolution,"3.3 Photocatalytic H2 evolution The photo-induced H2 evolution performances over all samples were evaluated. As seen in Fig. 8 a, CN0 displayed a low H2 production rate of 60 μmol/h/g. It is worth noting that the bulk g-C3N4 sample without HNO3 treatment showed a lower activity than the CN0 (Fig. S5). In contrast, the enhanced H2 evolution rates were observed over the HNO3 modified CNx catalysts. Among those catalysts, CN3 showed an excellent H2 generation rate with 1160 μmol/h/g, up to 19 times higher than that of CN0. Moreover, a high stability over CN3 for the photo-induced H2 evolution was observed as well. The reaction, after 25 h with 5 recycles under light irradiation, showed no significant decline for the H2 production over CN3 (Fig. 8b). In addition, a high AQE at 405 (7.83%) and 420 nm (7.67%) were obtained over CN3 (Fig. 8c). The photocatalytic H2 evolutions catalyzed by g-C3N4 materials and their typical derivatives with different structures under different sacrificial agents are summarized in Table 1 . Among those catalysts, CN3 displayed a competitive catalytic performance among most of g-C3N4 based catalysts, such as pure g-C3N4 (100 μmol/h/g) [10], graphene/g-C3N4 (451 μmol/h/g) [66], O-g-C3N4 nanorods (732 μmol/h/g) [36], N deficient g-C3N4 (316 μmol/h/g) [67], owing to the optimized textural, optical and electronic properties. It is worth noting that the high efficiency over fish-scale g-C3N4 (1316 μmol/h/g) nanosheet and porous ultrathin g-C3N4 (1323 μmol/h/g) are obtained, as resulted from the high dosage of Pt (3 wt%) in the process [3,17]. Furthermore, a high AQE of CN3 was also obtained compared to other catalysts. These results demonstrate that the CN3 in this work can be used as an alternative photocatalyst for the H2 evaluation."
10,Mechanism study,"3.4 Mechanism study Based on the aforementioned discussions, the CNx samples modified by HNO3 possessed a larger light absorption edge, better separation of electrons and holes, and higher carrier density compared to those of CN0, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution. For the modified samples (CNx), the carrier density and conduction bands (vs. NHE) fluctuated with the increasing dosages of HNO3, leading to a variational photocatalytic activity among CN1–CN5. The Mott-Schottky showed that CN3 obtained the highest carrier density and most negative conduction band (vs. NHE) than those of CN1, CN2, CN4, and CN5. Together with the good separation of electrons and holes, the reasons for the highest H2 production rates of CN3 among all the samples were explained. In fact, the variation of chemical-physical properties over modified CNx would greatly influence the catalytic efficiency [32,34,36–38,67]. Extensive research has shown that the functionality on the C3N4 molecular structure could efficiently moderate the catalytic performance in the H2 production [70–72]. The debate on the surface-active sites of the functional groups is still clouded [32,34,37]. Hence, to understand the intrinsic effect of the modified CNx on the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, the relationships between the H2 production rates and the surface functionality of catalysts were established. As shown in Fig. 9 a & b, the volcanic curves in the relationship between the H2 production rate and the contents of C and N atoms were obtained, revealing that the moderate contents of C and N atoms were beneficial for H2 production in g-C3N4 samples. It is reported that the ratio of C/N atoms in g-C3N4 samples plays a significant role in the catalytic performance [32,37,40,73]. Herein, the relationship between the H2 production rate and C/N atomic ratio was investigated. Fig. 9c shows that H2 generation rate increased with the increase of C/N atomic ratio, meaning that the N defects in tri-triazine units enhanced the H2 generation rate. However, a higher C/N atomic ratio (>0.92) showed a negative effect on the catalytic efficiency. These results demonstrated that the moderate C/N ratio was important for g-C3N4 to reach high efficiency in the photocatalysis. Apart from the C and N atoms, O atoms also existed in the g-C3N4 samples (as shown in Fig. S3), which was also involved in the photocatalysis. From the Fig. 9d, we can clearly see that a volcanic curve based on the O atoms and H2 production rate was observed, indicating that the moderate content of O atoms was beneficial for the reaction as well. Further detailed information for the relationship between surface functionalities and the H2 production rate was explored to unravel the intrinsic role of surface functionalities in influencing the catalytic performance (Figs. 3, 10 & S6). The functionalities deconvoluted from C1s XPS spectral, such as CC, NCN, displayed no monotonic relationship with catalytic efficiency, as shown in Fig. S6. In contrast, the NHx, CO/CO and OH species showed the different tendency in this reaction. Along with the increase of the content of OC and NHx species, the H2 evolution rate first ascended to reach the maximum value, and then descended (Fig. 10 a & b), demonstrating that the CO/CO and NHx species could apparently affect the catalytic efficiency. It is worth noting that a negative effect over the content of OH group on H2 evolution rate was observed, indicating that OH species acted as inhibitors on photocatalytic activity (Fig. 10c). It is well known that the N atoms of N2C and N3C along with the C atoms constitute the typical framework of tri-s-triazine in g-C3N4 (Fig. 5) [10]. Generally speaking, the catalytic efficiency over g-C3N4 is greatly influenced by the structural integrity of the triazine structure [32,37,38]. Therefore, the relationship between the N2C/N3C ratio and the H2 production rate was correlated to reveal the structure-dependence of g-C3N4 on the H2 evaluation. As shown in Fig. 10d, when the N2C/N3C ratio increased, the H2 production rate first increased and then decreased, indicating that too much loss of N atoms at N2C sites would have a negative effect on the catalytic performance of CNx. This result is not quite consistent with the reported results [37]. Since the O doping and N vacancy at N2C sites was believed to improve the photocatalytic activity of CNx [34,36,37]. To explore the key factor for the enhancement of the H2 production, more detailed relationships were correlated. As we know from Fig. 10c, the OH group displayed a negative effect on the catalytic efficiency. This phenomenal also was observed in non-HNO3-CN (Fig. S5 and Table S6). It is speculated that the decrease of H2 evolution rate was probably caused by the negative influence of OH species, even though there were numerous functionalities, which had a positive effect on catalytic efficiency. In order to eliminate the effect of OH species, the ratios of the CO/CO, NHx and N defects at N2C sites (N2C/N3C) to OH species were correlated with H2 rates, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11 , the H2 evolution rate increased monotonically with the ratios of (CO/CO)/OH, NHx/OH and (N2C/N3C)/OH, indicating that the CO/CO, NHx and lost N at N2C sites (including N vacancies and N replaced by O atoms) acted as the active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. These results confirm the CO/CO, NHx and N defects as the active sites for the CNx in the photocatalysis of H2 production. Accordingly, if the influence of the OH group on the photocatalytic H2 evolution could be avoided, higher catalytic efficiency would be obtained. Based on the above analyses and discussion, we put forward the active-site structure diagram of the modified CNx for photocatalytic hydrogen production as shown in Fig. 12 . The CO/CO group of the modified CNx acted as an active site for photocatalytic H2 generation, while the OH group was considered an inhibitor. Moreover, the NHx functionality and N vacancy were also regarded as the active sites when the impact of OH was eliminated."
11,Conclusions,"In summary, N defected CNx fibers with striping porous layers were successfully synthesized through a facile one-step strategy of annealing melaminium nitrate, which was produced from the reaction between the melamine and HNO3. The as-prepared CNx displayed the typical molecular structure of g-C3N4 with N vacancies at N2C sites. With the involvement of HNO3, more N vacancies in modified CNx were produced and at the same time these N vacancies might be replaced by O atoms, thereby adjusting the visible light absorption, band gap, carrier density and the separation efficiency of photo-induced electrons and holes over the catalysts. These modified CNx displayed improved photocatalytic performance for H2 production. CN3 showed the highest catalytic efficiency, as high as 1160 μmol/h/g H2 production rate (λ > 400 nm), 19 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (CN0, 60 μmol/h/g). And AQE of CN3 at 405 and 420 nm reached to 7.83% and 7.67%, respectively. High stability for the H2 evolution over CN3 was observed after 25 h with 5 recycles under light irradiation. Based on the intrinsic relationships between the surface functionalities and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, we can conclude that the OH species in CNx acts as an inhibitor for H2 production, while the CO/CO, NHx and N defects at N2C sites (including N vacancies and N replaced by O atoms) acts as the active sites for the photocatalytic H2 evolution. From the aforementioned results, this is an alternative approach to tune the physical and chemical properties of the CNx based materials through the acid treatment."
