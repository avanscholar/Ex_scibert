0,Introduction,"Occupational safety regulations limit the exposure to many toxic gases used in chemical and pharmaceutical industry, medicine, food production, etc. Existing solutions to monitor the exposure to toxic gases for the protection of employees are either expensive (elaborate sensor components and electronics) or impractical due to a long evaluation time after performing the measurements. Besides the purpose of occupational safety, monitoring and tracing of environmental and chemical processes cause significant costs to these industries but are essential. Colorimetric gas sensors provide a promising low-cost and low-power alternative for fast and simple identification of gases in ambient air. The detection mechanism relies on the tracking of a color change of a gas sensitive dye, which ideally responds selective to only one target gas by a characteristic color change. The main challenge of these gas sensors for a zero power application currently lies on the color evaluation. Systems in which the color change is evaluated with the naked eye by using a color comparison scale are very prone to errors. In order to detect the color change automatically and to determine the gas concentration quantitatively, spectroscopic measurement-techniques are frequently used to measure the spectral color change of the dye due to reaction with the target gas. These techniques are very complex and hence expensive (long optical paths of in-situ measurement techniques). In some research approaches, the interpretation of RGB values taken with conventional digital imaging devises (e.g. digital camera, flatbed scanner, etc.) are used for color evaluation [1–3]. Due to an impractical handling and cross-sensitivities to environmental conditions (e.g. inconstant illumination, varying recording distance, shadows, etc.) improvements are essential for a wider use in practice. Aim of this research work was the development of a disposable colorimetric sensor label, for which the color change can be evaluated with a conventional camera of e.g. a smartphone or a stationary reader, and which is both independent of the illumination situation and the camera device. Fig. 1 illustrates the sensor principle by an example of a dual sensor for the simultaneous detection of two different gases and/or gas concentration ranges. The sensor consists of an inexpensive paper/plastic composite and the gas sensitive material is applied by the means of a printing process. The integration of the gas sensitive layer into the machine-readable pattern of a QR code and the insert of a color reference enables a correction of the recorded color values. The color reference covers all possible RGB combinations, so that it can be used to calibrate any color within this color space. The arrangement of the reference in two separated color palettes next to the gas sensitive layer are deemed to minimize errors stemming from illumination gradients or misprints. In order to create space for the color reference the digital ID was removed from the QR code layout. Inclusion of the digital ID for the identification of the respective sensor label (target gases, gas concentration ranges, expiry date of the label, etc.) should be taken into account in a more advanced approach. A general description of the colorimetric sensor interrogation is given in [4]. To protect the gas sensor label against environmental influences and aging, it is packed gas-tight under a defined atmosphere. Current colorimetric gas sensors show drawbacks regarding the long-term stability of the color dye at permanent gas exposure and the dehydration of the color matrix. The illustrated measurement principle solves these problems by creating a single-use sensor label, designed for e.g. a short-term measurement of 15 min and/or a long-term measurement for a working day of 8 h. Thus, a user-orientated identification of the target gas within a complex gas mixture as well as a quantitative determination of the gas concentration should be realized by inexpensive mass production suitable way of manufacturing the sensor label. This is achieved by using printing technologies and an almost zero power consumption by the app of an available smartphone. Within the scope of this work, three possible application scenarios of gas sensitive sensor labels for the detection of ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde (CH2O) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) served as starting point of the investigations. Furthermore, pastes for the manufacturing of gas sensitive layers by screen printing were developed and the prints were characterized dependent on the target gas used."
1,Ammonia detection,"1.1 Ammonia detection One possible application scenario for the detection of ammonia (NH3) refers to a “freshness label” for food packaging. Natural NH3 arises primarily by the degradation of proteins [5] and is therefore well suited for evaluating food freshness and/or quality (e.g. meat, fish, vegetables, etc.) by monitoring the instant gas concentration in a modified inset gas atmosphere. However, its monitoring has also a high relevance in terms of environmental safety, because of its far-reaching consequences to humans’ health beyond the damage caused by direct exposure. 80–95% of the total NH3 emission in Europe result from agriculture [6] through livestock, nitrogen fertilizer, fermentation residues of biogas production, compost etc. [7]. Immense NH3 emissions are responsible for a steadily increasing eutrophication of waters, which is reflected in a reduction of water quality and thus in a decline in biodiversity [8]. Furthermore, NH3 contributes significantly to the formation of fine dust and as a consequence to an increase in mortality due to air pollution [9]. The colorimetric detection of NH3 has already been described frequently in literature [10–23]. An overview of possible indicators for the colorimetric detection of the three target gases is given in Table 1 . A reversible reaction, to monitor the instant concentration of the alkaline gas NH3, can be achieved by the usage of pH indicators like bromophenol blue (BPB), bromocresol green (BCG), bromocresol purple (BCP), bromophenol red (BPR), etc. The color change relies on the protonation and/or deprotonation of the pH indicator due to the reaction with NH3. Fig. 2 shows the sensing mechanism by the example of the pH indicator BCG, which changes its color at a pH value of 3.8–5.4 from yellow over green to blue. The detection of gases using pH indicators is not limited exclusively to NH3, also acidic gases like e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2) can be detected [13]. Consequently, possible interferences with other gases than the target gas have to be considered in a closer examination and excluded for the later application range. Due to the fact, that the color change is based on a proton transfer, the sensing ability of pH indicators improve with increasing relative humidity. Some research papers report about the use of phase transfer salts with a trace amount of water like tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and tetraoctylammonium hydroxide for paste preparation to foster the sensing mechanism in environments with low humidity conditions [13,23]. Due to the high attainable color saturation, the good solubility in organic solvents and the comparatively high long-term stability of the dissolved indicator, most pH-sensitive dyes are gladly used. Furthermore, the availability of pH indicators in arbitrary colors and color transition ranges offers the opportunity of combining and/or mixing indicators (similar to the coordination of different pH indicators for the use in a universal indicator) depending on the application range. In commercially available gas sensor systems, pH indicators are already in use, in form of gas detector tubes [19]."
2,Formaldehyde detection,"1.2 Formaldehyde detection With a production of 21 million tons per year [24], formaldehyde (CH2O) is probably one of the most produced chemicals worldwide. It serves as raw material for many other industrially produced chemicals, but also the demand for CH2O in its pure form rises steadily. In nature, CH2O originates amongst others endogenously as intermediate of metabolism in most living systems [25], however chronic exposure carries a high risk to humans’ health. In June 2014, the European Union reassessed the toxicological properties of CH2O and classified it in its regulation 605/2014, as carcinogen (category 1B) and mutagen (category 2) [26]. Despite its high toxicity, but due to its disinfecting, germicidal and preserving properties, the usage of CH2O is common in the production of many everyday life objects like for example furniture, adhesives, coatings, cosmetics and textile finishing. Thus, CH2O is not only a risk to workers of processing industries, but also an important issue for the assessment of indoor air quality, since the average Central European spends 90% of the day indoors, currently [27]. Furthermore, it is assumed that CH2O monitoring of indoor air may improve asthma control [28]. With the help of a colorimetric sensor label, the CH2O concentration could be checked periodically in private households without much effort. Colorimetric methods for the CH2O detection have been described in diverse literature [3,29–42]. However, current colorimetric standards are often based on measurements of concentration in solution and the development of a solid-state sensor for the measurement of gaseous CH2O contributes a big challenge. The detection mechanism relies commonly on nucleophilic addition of an amine through reaction with an aldehyde by a dehydration reaction, which induces a change in the dye’s chromophores. The color change runs often chromogen. As the synthesis of self-indicating amines turns out to be extremely complex, it is reported about the use of pH indicators to detect the change in basicity due to the reaction of CH2O with any primary amine [29,3]. Fig. 3 illustrates the sensing mechanism by the example of the pH indicator bromocresol purple (BCP), which changes its color at pH 5.2–6.8 from blue to yellow due to the reaction of CH2O with a primary amine. All approaches to detect CH2O described in this work are based on this principle and have been investigated using pH indicators with different pH transition ranges."
3,Hydrogen sulfide detection,"1.3 Hydrogen sulfide detection The last application scenario refers to the detection of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which has a great importance for the oil and gas industry as well as other industries, dealing with similar problems such as wastewater treatment plants, paper and pulp producers, landfills, etc. Even low gas concentrations and a short exposure time can lead to considerable physical damage of people exposed. Although H2S is easily recognizable at low gas concentrations by its characteristic smell of rotten eggs, a chronic exposure leads to a habituation effect and higher gas concentrations (>100 ppm) even to an anesthesia of the olfactory sense [43]. Especially in areas with a lower risk as well as in areas where many visitors operate, a colorimetric sensor label could be a cost-effective alternative to common alarm systems. Various detection methods based on copper, iron, mercury and lead salts are conceivable for a colorimetric detection of H2S [1,19,44–52]. In this research work, H2S is monitored using a copper(II) complex of the azo dye 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (H-PAN), abbreviated as Cu-PAN (see Fig. 4 ). The azo dye H-PAN has the property to form insoluble chelate complexes with many metal ions and is frequently used as a colorimetric reagent for quantitative determination of metal ions [48]. If H2S is present, the complex changes color from purple over red to yellow due to a reaction with S2−. This reaction is reversible. If H2S is no longer available, the purple colored Cu-PAN is formed again by the reaction of the chelating ligand H-PAN with CuS. Despite the reversible property, the complex is suitable for a dosimeter application, since the back reaction proceeds relatively slowly. We have already described the sensing properties of a printed Cu-PAN complex layer in [47]."
4,Experimental,
5,Screen printing,"2.1 Screen printing Due to the high achievable edge sharpness and the homogenous layer formation property, screen printing technology was chosen as the printing method of choice for producing the gas sensitive layer. With the aim to develop pastes compatible for screen printing, all color dyes used were embedded in the equal basic structure consisting of an ethyl cellulose (EC) matrix. For the preparation of the EC matrix, 10 g EC (ethoxyl content 48%, Aldrich Chemistry, USA) were dissolved in 400 mL ethanol (HPLC gradient grade, Roth, Germany) using 10 mL tributyl phosphate (puriss. ≥ 99% (GC), Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as plasticizer. The EC was solved successively by stirring the solution in a water bath at 40 °C. The resulting base paste has a milky translucent appearance. To dissolve the color dyes in the EC matrix, the solution was treated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Immediately before printing, a commercially available print retarder (universal retarder, No. 10-02459, medium, Printcolor Screen AG, Swiss) was added to the paste (10% of the final paste) to delay the drying of the paste in the mesh. Printing tests were performed on a “Thieme LAB 1000” (Thieme GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) precision screen printing machine using a 120−30 polyester mesh, which normally is used for the printing of fine lines and grids on smooth non-absorbent surfaces. A white poly(p-phenylene oxide) (PPE) coated matte paper served as printing substrate. Prints on the substrate with pastes containing the pure pH indicator show a pH value of ∼2.5−3 as starting point of the gas detection. The QR code elements for machine-readability as well as the reference for calibration of the color values were printed in advance by a three-color UV offset. The gas sensitive layers were printed in multiple layers on the substrate, in order to achieve the desired color saturation. Before the gas dependent characterization, all prints were dried under a flow of synthetic air with a relative humidity (r.h.) of 40% at room temperature for 12 h."
6,Ammonia and formaldehyde sensitive labels,"2.2 Ammonia and formaldehyde sensitive labels For the detection of ammonia (NH3) and formaldehyde (CH2O), the pH indicators bromophenol blue (BPB, pH 3–4.6) bromocresol green (BCG, pH 3.8–5.4) and bromocresol purple (BCP, pH 5.2–6.8) were purchased from “AppliChem” (Germany) and bromothymol blue (BTB, pH 6–7.6) from “Merk” (Germany) to examine their use in a colorimetric sensor label. The selected pH indicators change their color from yellow to blue in alkaline direction. The primary amine 1-octadecylamine (ODC, 97%, Alfa Aesar, USA) was used as CH2O sensitive material and combined with the pH indicators in a molar ratio of 2:1, starting from a 0.07 mmol amine content for 10 g EC matrix. ODC is good soluble in the application medium and commonly used as lubricant, dispersant and emulsifier [61]. Fig. 5 shows pipetted samples of the developed pastes at different molar ratio. The layer for the detection of NH3 exhibit a yellow color impression on the PPE coated paper, while the BPB, BCG and BCP based CH2O sensitive layers turned blue and the BTB based green at a molar ratio of amine to indicator of 2:1 (∼pH 6–6.5). With its green color, the BTB based CH2O paste revels a color almost outside its color transition range. Consequently, the maximum achievable color change of the dye cannot be fully exploited. For this reason, the dye content was increased for the production of the BTB label and the amine to indicator ratio adjusted to 2.5:1 to achieve a higher possible delta of color change through a blue-green color. Furthermore, the amount of color dye was modified for all pastes in dependency to the selected indicator for label production."
7,Hydrogen sulfide sensitive label,"2.3 Hydrogen sulfide sensitive label The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensitive color dye Cu-PAN was synthesized as described in literature [1,46] by adding a solution of 0.5 mmol copper(II) chloride dehydrate (≥ 99.99% trace metal basis, Aldrich Chemistry) in 3 mL distilled water to a solution of 0.5 mmol 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol in 75 mL ethanol (HPLC gradient grade, Roth, Germany). We have already described the synthesis and characterization of the resulting dye in [47]. During synthesis, the soluble azo dye forms coordinative bonds with the metal ion and receives thus pigment-like properties, which in turn makes it difficult to dissolve the color dye in the application medium. The addition of the color dye >2 mg/10 g EC matrix leads to increasing graying, which can be recognized in the reflection spectra by a growing peak. To improve the solubility of the color dye and the attainable color saturation of the paste, 500 μL potassium hydroxide (KOH) (pellets for analysis, Merk, Germany) solution in ethanol (0.18 N) were added to 10 g of the EC matrix. Fig. 6 shows different paste approaches with different proportions of dye with and without the addition of KOH solution. Subsequent measurements were performed with 14 mg Cu-PAN/10 g EC matrix."
8,Gas dependent characterization,"2.4 Gas dependent characterization The color change of the gas sensitive layer due to the reaction with the target gas was characterized by the evaluation of RGB values taken with an in-situ readout station using the camera of an iPhone 6 s and a commonly available time-lapse app, taking consequent consistent images every five seconds. The determination of the color values of individual pixels was implemented with the help of a Python script. For the installation of the in-situ readout station a transparent gas measurement chamber was built in an opaque plastic box to achieve constant illumination, and preferably high repeatability conditions, using several LEDs to configure a 6500 K white illumination. Subsequent measurements show the recorded raw RGB data. The gas measurement station disposes ten gas lines, each adjustable via a computer-driven mass flow controller (MFC) in order to set the required gas concentrations. For the production of synthetic air with the desired relative humidity level, dry and/or moist nitrogen (N2, 80%) were mixed with oxygen (O2, 20%). Moistened N2 was obtained by bubbling the gas through deionized water. The test gases (bottles concentrations: 1000 ppm NH3, 10 ppm CH2O, 20 ppm H2S, 1000 ppm CO, 2% CO2 and 1% CH4) were added to the synthetic air by reducing the same amount of dry N2. All test gases were purchased by Linde Gas Germany with the associated gas analysis certificates. The measurements shown were performed with a relative humidity of 40% (unless otherwise stated) at 24 °C room temperature and a gas flow of 500 mL/min. A general description of the gas measurement station is given in [62]."
9,Results and discussion,
10,PH indicator based labels for the detection of ammonia and formaldehyde,"3.1 PH indicator based labels for the detection of ammonia and formaldehyde Fig. 7 shows preliminary tests of the pH indicator based pastes for the detection of ammonia (NH3) and formaldehyde (CH2O) using pipetted samples containing identical molar ratio of color dye and an amine to indicator ratio of to 2:1 (analogue to samples in Fig. 5c). Aim of this attempt was a rough estimation of the realizable gas concentration ranges and the influence of cross-sensitivity to NH3 in dependency to the selected indicator and/or its color transition range. To this end, layers were exposed to 2 ppm CH2O for 2 h and to 10 ppm and 100 ppm NH3 for 1 h each. Between the gas exposures, the gas measurement chamber was flushed with synthetic air for 1 h. The color channel with the largest delta, induced by the reaction with the target gas was used for evaluation. The measurement results show the average color value based on 10 × 10 pixels. As expected, the NH3 layers show no cross-sensitivity to CH2O, while some of the CH2O layers change their color under the influence of NH3. However, the cross-sensitivity to 100 ppm NH3 decreases with increasing color transition range, while the detection limit of the NH3 layers shifts to higher gas concentration ranges. For example, NH3 concentrations <100 ppm have no measurable influence on the color change of BTB based layers and only a modest influence on BCP based layers. Due to the exposure of 100 ppm NH3, the pure BPB layer has almost reached its final blue color and is therefore well suited to measure NH3 concentrations <100 ppm. Due to the high availably of pH indicators with different color and/or pH transition ranges, their use provides a simple method for setting the desired sensor properties of the sensor label in dependency to the intended application range. A sensor label for the detection of NH3 can be adjusted to a specific gas concentration range easily, while the measurement duration can be set for the CH2O dosimeter label, e.g. to a working day of 8 h or a short-term measurement in the minute range in dependency to the expected detection limits. PH indicators in combination with the primary amine are suitable for the detection of CH2O as soon as possible interferences are known or when combined with the pure pH indicator to check whether the test is valid. In comparison to the instantaneous detection of NH3 the time must be taken into account for dosimeter applications, which is implemented in the later use by an additional picture that must be recorded at the beginning of the measurement immediately after opening the packaged sensor. Based on the first measurement results, a colorimetric dual sensor label for the detection of NH3 was made using a BPB and a BCG based pastes for printing. For the preparation of the BPB paste, half of the color dye was used compared to the BKG paste to improve the sensor’s back reaction. Fig. 8 shows the recorded RGB values due to exposure of increasing concentrations of NH3 from 5 to 100 ppm at 60%, 40% and 20% relative humidity, respectively. Each concentration was applied to the samples for 15 min afterwards the gas measurement chamber was flushed with synthetic air for 20 min. The respective camera images of the sensor label at the different NH3 concentrations are displayed in Fig. 13a. The sensor label shows a quick sensor response to NH3 with a t90 = ∼1 min (e.g. BCG, 100 ppm NH3, 60% r.h., red channel) and is well suited to monitor the instantaneous gas concentration. A first inspection of the raw camera data shows that the largest signals were obtained both in the red and in the green color channels. In the next section, other color representations will be discussed. Due to the exposure of 100 ppm NH3 the BPB based layer has almost reached its final blue color, while the BCG based layer can be used to monitor NH3 concentrations >100 ppm. Using BPB and BCG as indicators, the unpacked sensor label can be used for several months. Fig. 13b shows a sensor label for the detection of CH2O prepared for a long-term measurement of a working day of 8 h based on ODA and BCG. For comparison and the later fine adjustment, the gas sensitive layers were printed with different numbers of layers (two- and four-layered prints) and exposed to 2 ppm CH2O for 8 h. After the gas exposure, the two-layered print has almost reached its final yellow color and receives a higher delta of color change compared to the four-layered print despite the lower amount of dye molecules. The sensing properties of a colorimetric sensor label are decisive determined by the amount of color dye molecules, the matrix properties and the substrate."
11,Sensor response data analysis,"3.2 Sensor response data analysis While H2S and CH2O sensor labels are suitable for a dosimeter application, labels for the detection of NH3 exhibit a good performance in back reaction times (see Fig. 8). Fig. 9 shows a summary of the sensor responses defined as, (1) S = 100 ∙ x c - x 0 x 0 - x r e f % where S is the response in %, c the concentration in ppm, x(c) the raw sensor signal (red, green and blue color channels or combinations of them) with an 8-bit resolution (0–255), x0 the value of x(c =0 ppm) and xref a reference value of the signal (255 for red and green channels, 0 for blue channel) calculated from the experimental data in Fig. 8. The response of both labels is clearly linear with the logarithm of the gas concentration. This is, (2) S = m log c + n % where S is again the response in %, c the concentration in ppm and m and n the constants of a linear law. m represents the sensitivity towards the logarithm of the gas concentration, and n the response at very low concentrations. As previously stated, both sensor labels display their largest changes in the red and green image channels (Fig. 9). In order to create one single data value representative of the NH3 concentration, dimensionality reduction methods were applied for simplification. Fig. 10 shows the sensor responses obtained by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the data seen in Fig. 9. After the PCA transformation, most of the sensing information remains in the principal component (PCA1), while subsequent dimensions (PCA2, etc.) are almost insensitive to the presence of NH3. This brings us to conclude, that the color information generated by both layers in the presence of NH3 evolves along one single line in the three-dimensional red-green-blue spaces, which is definitely not aligned with any of these raw components. Moreover, the PCA1 component conveys the same or better sensor information than any of the raw ones () in the case the sensitivity is nearly identical, and in the case of the BCG based layer it is significantly better. This can be justified by the differences in the color excursion of both indicators and their respective overlap with the spectral responses of the red, green and blue camera channels. Regarding the effect of humidity, higher relative humidity levels (r.h.) increase the response of both pastes, leading to cross-talk. Independently of the data representation method (red, green, PCA), r.h. leads to response variations of about 5–10% (Table 2). This behavior is to be expected for any pH indicator based layer and could be mitigated by the integration of an additional unspecific indicator layer to monitor the r.h. content ."
12,Multi-gas measurements,"3.3 Multi-gas measurements As a part of the measurement in Fig. 11 , BCG, ODA + BTB and Cu-PAN based sensor labels were characterized by applying all three target gases. With a temporal shift of 40 min, the sensor labels were exposed to 1 ppm CH2O, 100 ppm NH3 and 4 ppm H2S, so that at t = 180 min all three gases are applied simultaneously. Respective camera images of the ODA + BTB and the Cu-PAN based sensor layer can be seen in Fig. 13c and d. Before gas exposure, the relative air humidity was varied from 80% to 20% in steps of 20 min and from 40% to 0% during gas exposure. The sensor labels show a complete color change due to the reaction with their target gas and no cross-sensitivity to the other gases. The gradual change in relative humidity shows only a minor influence on the sensor reaction. The greatest influence of the relative humidity on the sensor signal can be observed for the ODA + BTB based sensor label during the reduction of the relative humidity from 80% to 20% in synthetic air. With respect to the further investigation of possible cross-sensitivities, BCG, ODA + BCP and Cu-PAN based sensor labels were exposed to 10 ppm CO, 1000 ppm CO2, 100 ppm CH4, 2 ppm CH2O, 50 ppm NH3 and 4 ppm H2S for 15 min (see Fig. 12 ). Between the gas exposures, the gas measurement chamber was flushed with synthetic air for 20 min. None of the gas sensitive layers shows a cross-sensitivity to the exposed gases at the applied gas concentration. The entire color change of a six-layered ODA + BCP based print due to the exposure of 2 ppm CH2O for 40 min is shown in Fig. 13e. As a part of further measurements, a slight cross-sensitivity of ODA + BCP based sensor label to 8 ppm NO2 could be observed. Furthermore, Cu-PAN based layers show also a cross-sensitivity to NO2 visible by a reversal of the color change."
13,Conclusions,"Within the scope of our work, we developed printable colorimetric sensor labels for the detection of NH3, H2S and CH2O based on a PPE coated paper. The integration of the gas sensitive layer into the machine-readable pattern of a QR code and the use of a color reference enables quantitative and automated determination of the respective target gas concentration in ambient air through the evaluation of the recorded RGB color values. An easy method to adjust the desired target properties was shown for pH indicator-based sensor labels for the measurement of the instantaneous NH3 concentration and the detection of CH2O for the use in a dosimeter application."
