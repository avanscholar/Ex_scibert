0,Introduction,"The continuous growth of the population and economic development will boost global energy consumption. Based on a rough estimate in 2017, about 15,503 thousand cubic meters of liquid fuels were consumed per day (U.S., 2018). Currently, Fossil fuels meet the majority of the world's energy demand. However, greenhouse gas emissions are also a major pernicious threat to ecosystems (Song et al., 2020). As a result, it is necessary to find new alternative energy sources. Given the abundance of resources and environmentally friendly characteristics, liquid fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass are of great interest as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a promising renewable energy source (Sanderson et al., 2020). The technologies convert biomass to liquid fuels, which can be broadly divided into two pathways: biochemical decomposition and thermochemical conversion (Song et al., 2019). It has been reported that thermochemical conversion processes offer several merits over biochemical processes, such as low energy demand, low cost, and fast conversion process (Bhoi et al., 2020). Pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process that converts biomass into liquid biofuels under oxygen-free conditions, widely used in bio-oil production (Wang et al., 2017b). However, the crude products obtained from biomass pyrolysis contain>300 oxygenated compounds, such as acids, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, and phenols, resulting in the lower heating value of bio-oil (16.6–19 MJ/kg) (Pinheiro Pires et al., 2019). Besides, the existence of oxygenated compounds also contribute to the low pH values (2–2.5), high viscosity and water content, corrosiveness, and low chemical stability of the bio-oil. These deficiencies restrict the direct application of bio-oil as an alternative to fossil fuels (He et al., 2020a). Thus, it is of great interest to improve bio-oil quality to satisfy the rigorous transportation fuel requirements. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) can upgrade the quality of crude bio-oil by enhancing the hydrocarbon content using a wide range of catalyst types, such as zeolites (i.e., HZSM-5, MCM-41, and SBA-15) and metal oxides (i.e., MgO and CaO). HZSM-5 catalyst is the optimal material for favorable hydrocarbon production due to the unique structure and shows an impressive deoxygenation capacity (Liu and Porosoff, 2019). Presently, pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has aroused as the most endorsed analytical tool, which significantly facilitates the quantitative study of the distribution of products under different operating conditions (Chaihad et al., 2020). Several works in the literature have used Py-GC/MS to study the pyrolysis degradation mechanisms of biomass. Mishra et al. studied the Cynodon dactylon pyrolysis by Py-GC/MS (Mishra et al., 2020a), and the results showed that the formation of phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ketones increased in the temperature range of 450–650 °C. In contrast, the formation of oxygen-containing compounds such as cyclopentanone, acids, and esters decreased. They also studied the pyrolysis of waste dahlia using Py-GC/MS and found that the formation of esters, nitrogen-containing compounds, and acids was higher at lower temperatures (500 °C). In comparison, at higher temperatures (550 °C and 600 °C), the formation of oxygen-containing compounds declined, and hydrocarbons and alcohol production increased (Mishra et al., 2020b). Chen et al. studied the co-pyrolysis characteristics of kitchen waste with tire waste via Py-GC/MS, and results revealed that co-pyrolysis could increase the total peak area of volatile substances (10.92–15.34%). Besides, co-pyrolysis could improve the hydrocarbons content (especially olefins (13.25–37.42%)) and inhibit non-hydrocarbons (about 63%) in volatile products (Chen et al., 2019). Plastics are characterized by being rich in hydrogen but almost free of oxygen (Ryu et al., 2020). Presently, most plastic ends up in landfills or, in developing countries, is disposed of in unregulated disposal sites. Therefore, the plastics should be disposed of appropriately. Using plastic waste as a feedstock to produce bio-oil reduces waste generation and dependence on fossil fuels and recovering energy and chemicals (Gu et al., 2020). The quality of the product depends on the elemental composition of the feedstock (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen). The comparison between feedstock and final oil quality is typically based on the effective hydrogen to carbon ratio ((H/C) eff ) (Tang et al., 2020), which calculated by the following equation: (1) H / C eff = H - 2 O - 3 N - 2 S C C, H, O, N, S is the molar percentage of the corresponding element in the feedstock. Typically, lignocellulosic biomass has a low (H/C) eff of 0–0.3 and is a hydrogen-deficient feedstock. Researchers have found a strong correlation between olefins, aromatics yields, and inactivation rates with (H/C) eff (Shafaghat et al., 2019). Using high-density polyethylene (HDPE, with (H/C) eff of 2), a common source of municipal solid waste that is widely available and inexpensive, as the co-pyrolysis feedstock with biomass has attracted worldwide attention (Hassan et al., 2020). The quality and quantity of bio-oil were improved due to the positive synergistic effect between HDPE and biomass over the HZSM-5 catalyst, summarized in (Zhang et al., 2016). Several studies have reported that the addition of HDPE significantly improves the quality of bio-oil, such as increasing the content of olefins and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil while decreasing the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which is an undesirable product attribute to its carcinogenesis (Chen et al., 2016; Önal et al., 2014). In the present work, corn stalk (CS) and HDPE were utilized as the biomass feedstock and hydrogen-rich material in ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) experiments over HZSM-5 catalyst. The effects of temperature and CS to HDPE mass ratio on condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) and hydrocarbons yield were investigated. The synergistic effect between CS and HDPE during the co-CFP process was determined based on the difference between the theoretical and experimental CVOP and hydrocarbons values. Meanwhile, the possible reaction pathways between CS and HDPE were proposed to deeply explain the synergism between them."
1,Material and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CS was harvested from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. HDPE was purchased from a company in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Before the experiment, both CS and HDPE were mechanically ground, sieved to obtain particles <150 µm, and dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The proximate (air-dry basis) and elemental analysis (air-dry, ash-free basis) of CS were conducted in an elemental analyzer (Euro Vector EA3000, Italy) and calculated according to the Chinese National Standards (GB/T 28731, 2012), respectively. The proximate analysis result showed that the relative content of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, and ash were 9.13 wt%, 72.26 wt%, 6.13 wt%, and 12.48 wt%, respectively. The elemental analysis result revealed that the relative content of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (by difference) were 45.62 wt%, 6.26 wt%, 0.57 wt%, and 47.55 wt%, respectively. The (H/C) eff of CS was 0.05, and HDPE density was 0.97 g/cm3. HZSM-5 catalyst (particle size of 0.2–0.5 mm) with Si/Al ratio of 50 was obtained from the Catalyst Plant of Nankai University, Tianjin Province, China. Prior to the experiments, the HZSM-5 catalyst was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to activate in a muffle furnace. The physicochemical properties of the HZSM-5 catalyst are presented in Table 1 ."
3,Experimental method,"2.2 Experimental method Py-GC/MS is a convenient quantitative technique for analyzing the product distributions of pyrolysis vapors. In this work, CS and HDPE ex-situ CFP experiments were performed via an analytical CDS Pyroprobe 5200 pyrolysis reactor. The probe is a resistance heating element and holds an open-ended quartz tube. In the CFP experiment, 0.5 mg HZSM-5 catalyst was disposed of on both sides of the feedstock (0.5 mg) and served as a fixed bed because the pyrolysis vapors leave from either side. The feedstock-to-catalyst mass ratio was maintained at 1:1 in each CFP experiment. While in the non-catalytic fast pyrolysis (NCFP) experiments, no catalyst was put in the quartz tube, and the scheme diagram of the setup was reported in (Li et al., 2020). The feedstock was heated for 30 s at the desired pyrolysis temperature, and the heating rate was maintained at 2000 °C/s. Upon pyrolysis, the pyrolysis vapor was poured from the quartz tube into GC/MS (7890A/5975C, Agilent) with the gas stream (helium, 99.999%, 1.0 mL/min, Nanjing Maikesi Nanfen Special Gas Co., Ltd.). The GC/MS injection temperature and the interface temperature were 275 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The GC separation was performed on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) with a split ratio of 1:80. The MS was used with ionization energy of 70 eV and scan per second over range electron m/z of 35–550 amu. All experiments were conducted at least triplicate under the same conditions to obtain the average values and used for discussion."
4,Product analysis method,"2.3 Product analysis method Chromatographic peaks were identified and analyzed using the NIST MS library database. For each chemical component, the relative content was expressed as area% of the calibrated peak area. The products could not be collected during the Py-GC/MS experiments, so the yield of the total organic pyrolysis products could not be determined. However, since the mass of the feedstock remains identical in each experiment, the total calibrated peak area of condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) can be used to reveal the variation in product yield. The spent HZSM-5 catalyst was gathered and dried at 120 °C for 2 h; then, the dried sample was loaded into the muffle furnace for combustion (650 °C, 2 h) to calculate the coke yield through the following equation, where Ms and Mc are the mass of spent and combusted HZSM-5. (2) C o k e y i e l d % = M S - M C MC Besides, the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, and olefins (Ra ) was determined by the following: (3) R a = P S ∑ P a where Ps is the peak area of specific products, ∑Pa is the total peak area of pyrolytic products."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Effect of temperature and HZSM-5 on pyrolysis of individual CS and HDPE,"3.1 Effect of temperature and HZSM-5 on pyrolysis of individual CS and HDPE Fig. 1 a and b show the relationship between the total peak area of CVOPs and the temperature during the NCFP/CFP process. In the NCFP of HDPE, the total peak area of CVOPs increased continuously when the temperature increased from 400 °C (0.163 × 109) to 800 °C (18.98 × 109) since the HDPE degradation is an endothermic process, and high temperatures promote its decomposition. The maximum increase was observed from 500 to 600 °C. Although the presence of HZSM-5 did not change the overall variation trend of the CVOP content, the total peak areas were increased, indicating that the catalyst can promote the chain scission of HDPE primary pyrolysis products. AS depicted in Fig. 1b, due to the difference in structure and chemical composition, the CVOP content of CS pyrolysis was much lower than that of HDPE, and the variation trend was also different. In general, the decomposition of CS involves a series of endothermic and exothermic reactions, whereas HDPE degradation proceeds through a range of radical mechanisms (Önal et al., 2014). In the NCFP of CS, The total peak area of CVOPs initially increased, reaching a maximum at 600 °C, as the higher temperature favored the decomposition of CS. The CVOP content decreased when the temperature was further increased because the secondary reaction of primary pyrolysis vapors was favored by the higher temperatures, which would transform the heavier and longer molecules into permanent light gases (e.g., CO, CH4, and CO2) (Paradela et al., 2009). In the CFP of CS, the turning point of variation trend in CVOP content shifted to 700 °C. The reason was that the introduction of HZSM-5 promoted the further decomposition of CS primary pyrolysis products at 600–700 °C, which may recombine to form solid residues. Although higher temperatures could promote the secondary cracking of pyrolysis vapors, the combined effect of temperature and catalyst on the CVOP content was responsible for the increasing trend with the temperature up to 700 °C. When the temperature was further increased to 800 °C, the CVOP content decreased, suggesting that the temperature exceeded the catalyst's effect. The variation trend of coke yield during the CFP of CS or HDPE was similar to the variation of CVOP content due to the positive correlation between them. An increase in the CVOP content led to enhanced contact between pyrolysis vapors and the surface of HZSM-5. This allows the pyrolysis products to undergo polymerization and condensation on the surface and internal of the catalyst, resulting in coke formation (Zhang et al., 2014). Fig. 1c shows the relative content of olefins, alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons obtained from CS and HDPE pyrolysis. During HDPE pyrolysis, chain scissions occur, promoting the formation of alkanes and olefins, which are the main products of NCFP of HDPE, with hardly any aromatics being observed. However, the aromatic hydrocarbons were produced in the CFP of HDPE. Olefins can be transformed into aromatic hydrocarbons through a series of reactions, including oligomerization, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer reaction at the acid sites of HZSM-5 (Liu et al., 2020). Thus, the presence of HZSM-5 favors the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. The temperature dependence of their relative content opposite to that of olefins. The relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased at the temperature range of 400–500 °C and declined when the temperature increased to 800 °C. The main reason is that high temperatures promote the degradation of HDPE, leading to the high olefin content in CVOPs. The same reason applies to the variation trend of the relative content of alkanes. The presence of HZSM-5 facilitated hydrocarbons formation compared with the NCFP of CS. The relative content of aromatics and olefins increased continuously from 400 °C to 700 °C, attributed to the conversion of primary pyrolytic oxygenates (e.g., furans, alcohols, and phenols) to hydrocarbons at the active sites of HZSM-5 (Rahman et al., 2018). The primary pyrolysis vapors and formed hydrocarbons could be cracked into permanent light gases (e.g., CO2 and CH4) at 800 °C, resulting in their relative content decreased. The variation trends for olefins and aromatics were similar to those for hydrocarbons, in agreement with other studies (Li et al., 2019). Fig. 1d shows the distribution of various aromatics obtained from the CFP of CS or HDPE. Owing to the shape-selective catalytic properties of HZSM-5, toluene and xylenes were the main products in the CFP of HDPE, and their relative content first increased, reaching the maximum value at 500 °C, and then decreased with increasing temperature. As depicted in Fig. 2 a, long-chain compounds started to decompose into the short-chain ones at 500 °C, which can undergo various reactions such as isomerization and aromatization reactions at the active sites in the HZSM-5 pore and thereby generating toluene and xylenes. Also, the low CVOP content at 500 °C leads to a maximum percentage of toluene and xylene. This temperature also favored benzene and ethylbenzene production, whose relative contents were 6.0% and 2.1%, respectively. When temperature consistently increased to 800 °C, the catalytic performance of the catalyst decreased due to the high coke amount formed on the surface of HZSM-5. Hence, the formation of all aromatics was inhibited, presenting the declining trend. Note that PAHs were not observed during the CFP of HDPE. For the CFP of CS, the main products were toluene and xylene, followed by benzene, PAHs, ethylbenzene, and indene; this is in agreement with previous works (Ding et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). It is necessary to investigate the distribution of the C5+ compounds for it is the essential component of bio-oil. The thermal degradation of HDPE follows a series of radical mechanisms (initiation, propagation, hydrogen transfer reactions, β-scission, and termination) (Bockhorn et al., 1999). Since HDPE molecular chains have a high hydrogen content, the side reaction of hydrogen transfer is easily induced, and it makes the propagation (depolymerization) reaction difficult to terminate completely. The side reactions lead to the formation of oligomers (olefins or alkanes) with different chain lengths. Fig. 2a shows the selectivity of compounds with different carbon numbers. C20+ long-chain compounds were the dominant products at 400 °C because the depolymerization of primary long-chain pyrolysis products was not evident. By contrast, the degradation of HDPE and the depolymerization of primary long-chain pyrolysis products were promoted at 500 °C, leading to increased CVOP content and the formation of middle/short-chain compounds. Besides, the light olefins produced by primary long-chain products depolymerization can undergo a series of reactions (isomerization and aromatization reactions) in the catalyst pore to form aromatics; thus, the selectivity of C5–C11 compounds was high at this temperature. Further increasing the temperature caused a continuous decrease in the selectivity of C5–C11 compounds while enhancing the formation of C12-C20 and C20+ compounds. The underlying reason is that high temperature promotes the degradation of HDPE, which increased the content of primary long-chain pyrolysis products. Therefore, the long-chain compounds' selectivity exhibits an increasing trend. The C5–C11 compounds had an outstanding selectivity in all experiments, which was attributed to the excellent shape selectivity of the HZSM-5 catalyst for aromatic hydrocarbons, and this is in good agreement with Fig. 1d where benzene (C6), Toluene (C7), and xylenes (C8) play a dominant role. Fig. 2b shows the selectivity of terminal or nonterminal olefins. The new radicals generated by chain transfer during the β-scission reaction can eventually generate olefins (α-olefins or α, ω-diolefins). And HZSM-5 catalyst with high external surface area and high acidity also favor chain scission reaction at the ends of polyolefins (Aguado et al., 2001). Therefore, the terminal olefins in C5+ olefins were highly selective. However, as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 500 °C to 800 °C, the complexity of chain-scission reaction and pyrolysis process was gradually increased, leading to the increased selectivity of nonterminal olefins in C5+ olefins."
7,Effect of temperature and HZSM-5 on co-pyrolysis process,"3.2 Effect of temperature and HZSM-5 on co-pyrolysis process The theoretical total peak area of CVOPs, relative content of hydrocarbons, and coke yield were used to investigate the synergistic effect between CS and HDPE, determined using the following equation: (4) C Cal = 0.5 C HDPE + 0.5 C CS where Ccal is the theoretical value, CHDPE and CCS are the experimental values of the NCFP of HDPE and CS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 a and Table 2 , for non-catalytic co-pyrolysis of CS and HDPE, the experimental total peak area of CVOPs was larger than the calculated value at all temperatures, revealing that the co-pyrolysis results were not simply the cumulative effects of individual HDPE and CS pyrolysis. The relative experimental content of hydrocarbons was also greater than the calculated value. The fundamental reason was that the CS-derived oxygenated compounds promote the chain scission of HDPE, and then more HDPE-derived olefins would be produced for participating in the Diels-Alder reactions with CS-derived oxygenates to form hydrocarbons (Rahman et al., 2018). Besides, the hydrogen atoms produced by HDPE promoted the cracking and deoxidation reactions of CS-derived primary pyrolysis oxygenated compounds and enhanced hydrocarbon production. The introduction of HZSM-5 further facilitated the conversion of oxygenated compounds to hydrocarbons. This can be inferred from Fig. 3d, in which the relative content of oxygenated compounds significantly decreased during the co-pyrolysis process. As can be seen from it, the products obtained from individual CS pyrolysis were almost all oxygenated compounds, which is consistent with Fig. 1c, where very low content hydrocarbons exist. When adding HDPE to the sample, the relative content of oxygenated compounds sharply decreased from 97.02% for CS to 42.03% for the mixture, and the addition of HZSM-5 further reduced it to 18.61%. All of these were lower than the theoretical value (48.51%) calculated by Eq. (4). Apart from reducing oxygenated compounds by the Diels-Alder reaction, the deoxidation reactions (e.g., decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and dehydration) that occurred at the acid sites of HZSM-5 can also reduce its content. As shown in Fig. 3a, the total peak area of CVOPs initially increased and then decreased in the temperature range considered for the co-CFP process, reaching the maximum at 750 °C. The cumulative effect of individual CS and HDPE pyrolysis caused the variation trend in the total peak area of CVOPs during the co-CFP process, and a similar trend was observed for the coke yield. As exhibited in Table 2, the co-pyrolysis of HDPE and CS can reduce the coke yield compared with the calculated coke yield value. The formation of coke on the surface of HZSM-5 is known to occur for the following reason. Lignin-derived phenolic compounds are too large to enter the channel of HZSM-5 and will be deposited on the catalyst surface for polymerization or react with cellulose/hemicellulose-derived small molecule oxygenated compounds to generate coke (Wang et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2016). When HDPE was mixed with CS, CS-derived pyrolytic oxygenated compounds could react with HDPE-derived olefins via the Diels-Alder reaction rather than the polymerization reaction. Meanwhile, the hydrogen atoms supplied by HDPE could also stabilize lignin-derived phenolic compounds, both of which could inhibit coke formation. Fig. 3b shows the relative content of hydrocarbons obtained from the co-pyrolysis experiments. The presence of HZSM-5 promoted hydrocarbon production, and olefins were the major products due to the chain scission of HDPE and the conversion of CS-derived oxygenates via the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. The formation of aromatic hydrocarbons was favored because of the cyclization and aromatization reactions of the primary pyrolytic products inside the catalyst. The temperatures 650 and 700 °C were optimal when taking the production of aromatics and total hydrocarbons into consideration. Thus, these temperatures were selected for the following experiment concerning the effect of CS to HDPE mass ratio. The relative contents of olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons showed the opposite trend over the studied temperature range, owing to the reactions between HDPE-derived olefins and CS-derived furans, thereby producing aromatics at the cost of olefins. Fig. 3c presents the distribution of several aromatic hydrocarbons during the co-CFP experiment. Aromatics can be formed through two pathways. The biomass-derived oxygenated compounds and HDPE-originated olefins can produce aromatics through the Diels-Alder reactions. This reaction can explain the possible mechanism for cellulose and hemicellulose, but not for lignin, since the main thermal decomposition products of lignin are phenolic monomers and oligomers. The aromatization of lignin-derived phenolics can be described by the deoxidation reactions induced by hydrogen donated by HDPE. As depicted in Fig. 3d, the co-CFP of CS and HDPE produced comparable toluene and xylenes, followed by benzene and PAHs, all of which showed the same trend with the total aromatic content. The production of ethylbenzene and indene was lower at all temperatures (<1.0%). The formation of PAHs, which present carcinogenic hazards, was inhibited at 750 °C. The HZSM-5 catalyst has the worst catalytic performance at 750 °C thanks to the highest coke yield. Fig. 4 shows the selectivity of C5+ hydrocarbons at different co-CFP temperatures. Unlike pyrolysis of individual HDPE, the carbon selectivity in co-CFP process was much complicated. C5–C11 compounds were the main products in C5+ hydrocarbons at all temperatures, indicating that CS-derived oxygenates significantly facilitate the chain scission of HDPE-derived long-chain products. In addition, the CS-derived oxygenates and HDPE-originated olefins can form monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through various deoxygenation and aromatization reactions in the presence of HZSM-5. Hence, C5–C11 compounds showed high selectivity. For C20+ compounds, their selectivity initially decreased and then increased in the studied temperature range, and their minimum selectivity was observed at 750 °C. As mentioned above, the positive synergistic effect could be observed during the co-CFP process. Based on the current and previous works of our group (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2019), the possible reaction pathways between CS and HDPE were summarized in Fig. 5 . During the co-CFP process, the biomass first decomposed thanks to its low thermal stability, and the HDPE would be degraded at high temperatures via a range of radical mechanisms. The oxygen-containing compounds and free radicals derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin can abstract hydrogen atoms from HDPE and promote the chain scission of HDPE-derived macromolecules, resulting in the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The hydrogen atoms donated by HDPE can promote the decomposition of biomass components, forming oxygenated compounds, permanent gases, and char. Subsequently, the HDPE-derived olefins and cellulose/hemicellulose-derived furans can produce aromatic hydrocarbons through Diels–Alder reaction at the active site of HZSM-5. The olefins produced during the co-CFP process can form aromatics through a series of reactions inside the catalyst (e.g., hydrogen transfer, cyclization, and aromatization reactions). The oxygenated compounds derived from biomass can produce aromatics and coke in HZSM-5 through deoxidation, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization reactions. Specifically, the hydrogen atoms and olefins supplied by HDPE can effectively inhibit coke formation."
8,Effect of CS-to-HDPE (CS/HDPE) mass ratio on co-CFP process,"3.3 Effect of CS-to-HDPE (CS/HDPE) mass ratio on co-CFP process The biomass-to-HDPE mass ratio plays a vital role during the co-pyrolysis process. In the present work, we conducted the co-CFP experiments with CS/HDPE mass ratio ranging from 1:0 to 0:1. Given the significant effect of the feedstock’s (H/C) eff on the distribution of pyrolysis products, the (H/C) eff value was determined for feedstocks with different CS/HDPE mass ratios. As depicted in Fig. 6 a, (H/C) eff increased linearly with the HDPE proportion. Thus, blending HDPE with CS can effectively improve the hydrogen deficiency of the biomass. Fig. 6a shows the total peak area of CVOPs as a function of the CS/HDPE mass ratio at temperatures of 650 or 700 °C. The CVOP content was significantly enhanced when HDPE was added to the sample compared with the pyrolysis of individual biomass and continuous increase with CS/HDPE mass ratio decrease. The increased HDPE content leads to more pyrolysis vapors released because of the high volatile content in it. Moreover, more hydrogen atoms were donated by HDPE as its percentage increased, which promotes the decomposition of the biomass. For coke yield, decreased CS/HDPE mass ratio inhibited the coke formation at both 650 and 700 °C (Fig. 6a). During the co-CFP process, coke precursors such as cellulose-derived furans and lignin-derived phenols would react with HDPE-derived olefins rather than polymerization reactions, thereby inhibiting the coke formation. Since aromatics are the desired pyrolysis products in the present work, the dependence of the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons on the CS/HDPE mass ratio was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6b, the relative content of hydrocarbons increased with the HDPE percentage in the considered CS/HDPE mass ratio range because hydrocarbons were the major products of HDPE pyrolysis, and synergistic effects between HDPE and CS-derived oxygenated compounds proposed in Fig. 5 can also enhance hydrocarbon production. It is worth noting that only when (H/C) eff exceeds 1.0, aromatics production was significantly affected. This is similar to the findings of Wang et al. that a functional relationship exists between the target product (oil and hydrocarbons) yield and (H/C) eff with a critical point ((H/C) eff = 1.06) when zeolite was used for catalytic conversion (Wang et al., 2013). In our work, the relative content of aromatics remained constant when the percentage of HDPE increased from 0 to 50% ((H/C) eff < 1) but increased noticeably when the HDPE content exceeded 50% ((H/C) eff > 1). The decrease of aromatics content at the mass ratio of 0:1 was attributed to no synergistic effect between the feedstocks. For CS/HDPE > 1, the CS played a dominant role, and the low HDPE content was insufficient to enhance the hydrogen content of the feedstock. The high aromatic content for CS/HDPE < 1 was ascribed to the reactions between CS-derived oxygenates and HDPE-originated olefins. Furthermore, lignin-derived phenolic compounds produced side-chain fragments on the HZSM-5 surface by abstracting hydrogen atoms during the aromatization of HDPE-derived alkanes. The side-chain fragments subsequently diffused into the catalyst pores and underwent deoxygenation and hydrocarbon mechanisms to produce aromatics. Fig. 6c shows the relationship between various aromatic hydrocarbons and CS/HDPE mass ratio. Similar to the catalytic pyrolytic results of individual CS or HDPE, toluene and xylene were the main products, and their content increased with CS/HDPE mass ratio except for 1:0 and 0:1. The diameter of sinusoidal and straight channels in HZSM-5 is comparable to the equivalent diameter of toluene and xylene, thereby providing good selectivity for their formation. Besides, a hydrogen-rich atmosphere was guaranteed during the pyrolysis of HDPE. Thus, products obtained from CS pyrolysis, such as 4-methyl syringol, would be attacked by hydrogen atoms, resulting in dehydroxylation and demethylation reactions, and ultimately form toluene and xylene (He et al., 2020b). The relative content of benzene first decreased and then increased with increasing CS/HDPE mass ratio. The amounts of ethylbenzene and indene produced in the co-CFP were comparable; both of them were below 2%. Given that benzene, toluene, and xylene are valuable products, lower CS/HDPE mass ratios seem more desirable."
9,Conclusion,"We performed ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of CS and HDPE over HZSM-5 catalyst via Py-GC/MS to improve hydrocarbons and aromatics production. The results showed that the maximum CVOP content was obtained at 750 °C. However, when taking the relative content of hydrocarbons and aromatics into account, 650 °C and 700 °C presented better performance. After adding HDPE to the feedstock, positive synergistic effects exist, and potential reaction pathways between CS and HDPE were proposed. This contributes to the experimental CVOP content and hydrocarbons production were higher than the calculated one during the co-pyrolysis process. The introduction of HZSM-5 facilitated the hydrocarbons yield further, especially the aromatics owing to the good shape-selectivity of HZSM-5, in which benzene, toluene, and xylene exhibit the dominant selectivity. Besides, the CVOP content and the relative content of hydrocarbons steadily increased with decreased CS/HDPE mass ratio in co-CFP experiments. CS/HDPE mass ratio of 1:1 was a critical point in light of the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. It almost constant when CS/HDPE > 1 but continuously increased with the decrease CS/HDPE when <1:1. In both CFP and co-CFP experiments, C5–C11 compounds exhibited the largest selectivity."
