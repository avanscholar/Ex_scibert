0,Introduction,"Air pollution is one of the serious issues faced by humanity over the years and continues to be [1]. India has become the topmost emitter of atmospheric pollutants majorly contributed by industries and transportation. The concern about air pollution reduction is increasing and the world is keenly focussing on reducing these emissions from automobiles by imparting stringent emission norms. India is one of the leading emitter of PM 2.5 pollution rate as per the monitoring report released by WHO [2]. Currently, the regulations legislated around the world are more stringent against the use of fossil fuel based fuels as it harms the environment. Hence, the search for an alternate source of energy to replace petroleum-based fuel is increasing [3]. Over the decades, out of the many proposed solutions to reduce air pollution, usage of alternative fuels replacing conventional petroleum based fuels. The Indian government looked into this issue by taking initiatives in the year 2001 and introduced the Ethanol blending program (EBP) which directed a blend of 95% gasoline and 5% ethanol, paving the way to lower the dependency rate of crude oil and thus to reduce the environmental pollution to a greater extent. This program is being active in 4 union territories and 9 states in India aiding reduction in HC, CO, CO2 emissions. Alcohols and gasoline blends have been used in SI engines for a long while now, the interest in alcohol usage with hydrocarbons goes back to the early seventies of this century. This is due to the massive demand for hydrocarbons, which leads to the exploitation of crude resources around the world. The tetraethyl lead content of gasoline, is an additive to promote octane rating, which is one of the primary toxic air pollutant, a threat to humans [4]. In the current scenario, the chase to build an energy efficient and pollution free environment is still progressing as the alternative fuel technologies are lined up in the proving grounds now. Trials were also made on mixing gasoline with benzene, butadiene and few other compounds which comes under the class of aromatics [6]. Some of the additives are carcinogens and prone to smoke emissions. In internal combustion engine research, the possibilities of optimizing the compression ratios and performance improvement are swiftly progressing around the globe and improvements are upcoming every day [8]. Alcohols are widely suitable fuel for SI engine application replacing gasoline. This is because of favourable properties like oxygen content, latent heat of vaporization, flame speed, and complete combustion [9]. However, there are still challenges in mixing alcohols and gasoline at lower temperatures as it leads to stratification and knocking [10]. Elfasakhany et al. [11] studied the combustion, emission and performance characteristics with ternary gasoline-alcohol blends and arrived at favouring results in volumetric efficiency, and brake power. However, the emission results were not very favourable for gasoline-alcohol ternary blends. Though stabilizers addition is practiced in alcohol-gasoline blend mixtures, the alcohol content was limited to 10% in low-temperature conditions. Ethanol is one of the best suitable alcohols used as an additive to hydrocarbon fuels these days, as it is highly resistance to knock and has high latent heat of evaporation. Ethanol is low molecular weight alcohol, which has mostly replaces the other octane boosters added to gasoline [7]. Ethanol can be blended with gasoline to achieve complete combustion, due to the presence of oxygen molecules, which contributes to better combustion efficiency. On the other hand, ethanol blending also would lead to lower air pollution due to absence of sulphur content [12]. Elfasakhany et al. [13] studied the performance and emissions characteristics of gasoline and hybrid methanol–gasoline fuel in SI engine. Al-Hassan [14] investigated the use of unleaded gasoline blend and found that equivalence air–fuel ratio was decreasing along with brake specific fuel consumption. Ozsezen et al. [15] stated that corrosion issues are one important factor to note, which could be reduced to a greater extent by using advanced injection techniques. Turner et al. [16] investigated on ethanol blends with gasoline and found there is a considerable reduction in CO2 and NOx emissions at all loading conditions. Rui Kang et al. [5] investigated the dual fuel ethanol- gasoline engine and found that with increase in ethanol ratio improved the combustion phasing, which promotes combustion leading to better thermal efficiency. Yücesu [17] compared the mathematical and experimental analysis of spark ignition engine performance using ethanol–gasoline blend as fuel. However, higher order alcohols are gaining attention recently as they have good octane rating and calorific value. Various higher order alcohols namely butanol, pentanol and propanol were used along with gasoline in SI engine. Dhamodaran et al. [18] investigated the effect of n-butanol blending with gasoline and tested in four-cylinder SI engine at various speeds and constant load condition. Alcohol was blended 10, 20 and 30% by volume with gasoline and tests were conducted. They observed that the addition of n-butanol reduced HC and CO emissions with a slight increase in NOx emission. Liu et al. [19] conducted experimental research in SI engine at high speed with n-butanol addition to gasoline in the ratio of 0, 30 and 35% by volume. They observed that the addition of butanol could achieve knock resistance, which allows early ignition timing. Cylinder pressure and heat release rate were improved with an increase in butanol blend ratio after optimized ignition timing. The occurrence of peak of pressure and heat release rate was advanced, which leads to more heat converted to useful work leading to improvement in thermal efficiency. Li et al. [20] blended isopropanol-n-butanol-ethanol (IBE) with gasoline and tested in port fuel injection SI engine. IBE were blended at various ratios of 0–60% by volume. Based on the experimental results, IBE30 was better in terms of engine performance and emission characteristics. IBE30 showed improvement in thermal efficiency with lower CO and NOx emissions in comparison to gasoline. Dhamodharan et al. [21] conducted experiments in SI engine with the blending of the di-isopropyl ether with gasoline in the ratio of 10, 20 and 30% by volume to assess the performance, emission and combustion characteristics. Experiments were conducted in a four-cylinder MPFI system at a speed of 1400 rpm and 2800 rpm under two load conditions 20 Nm and 25 Nm. The addition of alcohol improved the brake thermal efficiency, cylinder pressure and heat release rate in comparison to gasoline. Also, HC and CO emissions were lower with a slight increase in CO2 emission. The classification still narrows down to aliphatic alcohol and aromatic alcohol. In this study, benzyl alcohol, which falls under the aromatic family is subjected to investigation. The possible production of benzyl alcohol is through the hydraulic process of Lignin [22]. Also, benzyl alcohol can be seen in aromatic oils like hyacinth and Jasmine [23]. Extensive research is ongoing in recent years on studying the performance output, combustion and emission characteristics of spark ignition engine subjected to alcohol-gasoline blends in various modes. The major technological changes would deliver significant emission reductions and performance improvement. The authors of the present study have done experimental investigations previously using alcohols, namely iso-butanol, n-butanol and benzyl alcohol with gasoline at lower blending ratio. It was observed that among the blends, benzyl alcohol was best in comparison to other blends and gasoline in terms of better performance [24]. Based on the literature review, it is observed that numerous studies were done using lower alcohol in SI engine with limited studies on higher alcohol, especially with benzyl alcohol. While there are few studies on using benzyl alcohol in CI engine [25,26], works related to use of benzyl alcohol in SI engine was not reported by anyone other than the previous work of the authors. This paper mainly investigates the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of SI engine fuelled with gasoline and alcohol blends. Higher and lower order alcohols namely benzyl alcohol and ethanol were blended 10% and 20% by volume of the overall quantity. Table 1 shows the physical properties of test fuels."
1,Experimental setup and procedure,"The experimental trials were conducted on a four-stroke gasoline two-cylinder engine shown in Fig. 1 . The engine has the MPFI capability for injection and electronic ignition enabled. The engine has a capacity of 624 cc, two valve per cylinder with a power output of 12.54 KW. The engine is electronic fuel injection enabled and controlled by closed-loop system with lambda sensor on the exhaust. An eddy current dynamometer is shaft coupled with the engine, which has the capability of loading the engine. The test setup also includes a high-speed data acquisition (AVL make) and storage system for gathering data. The gaseous emission was measured using AVL five gas analyser, which uses the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) principle to measure the emissions from the engine. The emissions mainly focussed were HC, CO, CO2, NOx. The main sensor data collected were pressure sensor for in-cylinder pressure, encoder for crank and cam position measurement which in turn gives the rpm of the engine, thermocouple for temperature measurement. The setup was used to measure all the data for 100 consecutive cycles and the collected data were consolidated and refined for effectively avoiding the non-linearity in every cycle. The uncertainty range of instruments and equipment used can be seen in Table 2 . The experimental trials were performed by restricting the engine at a constant speed of 2500 rpm. The engine was loaded from 0% to 100% ie no load to full load condition. The experiments were done with steady state condition for all the test specimens without altering any physical parameter of the engine. For warming up before the trials the engine was allowed to run for 10 min and the readings were noted for number of trials for various loading condition."
2,Results and discussion,"This section gives the discussion on the performance, emission and combustion characteristics for the blends at various loads 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% at 2500 rpm. Fig. 2 shows the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of all the test blends compared to gasoline under various load conditions. An increase in BTE was noted for all the test fuels with increase in load due to low friction and reduction in other losses at higher load conditions. BTE for Gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10 and E20 at 100% load condition were recorded as 29.77%, 32.8%, 33.2%, 30.41% and 31.1% respectively. Addition of the alcohols to gasoline improved the BTE considerably at all loading conditions. It was clearly identified that the increase in concentration of the benzyl alcohol and ethanol blends increase the BTE. The key factors behind BTE improvement were accelerated mixing and proper atomization. The quality of the vapour produced and the presence of oxygen molecules in dual fuel blends contributed to the process of combustion enhancement. It was clearly inferred from Fig. 2 that the benzyl alcohol blend showed better performance characteristics compared to ethanol blend and gasoline in both 10% and 20% blend specimens subjected for testing. This is because benzyl alcohol is a special type of aromatic alcohol. The aromatic benzene ring of benzyl alcohol bonds indirectly in the OH group, resulting in faster rate of hydrogen abstraction [23,24]. The indirect bonding also contributes to the pace of isomerism resulting in radical propagation and less activation energy required for breaking the bond. Thus the favourable outcome given by benzyl alcohol is mainly because of indirect bonding of OH group and free radical propagation. Also, the calorific value of benzyl alcohol is higher compared to ethanol which would have reduced the fuel consumption and subsequently improving the brake thermal efficiency. It is also observed that, Bn20 blend exhibited better heat release rate in comparison to gasoline as discussed in the later parts. This is also another reason for improvement in BTE for Bn20. Godwin et al. [24] observed that benzyl alcohol showed better performance compared to other higher alcohol blends namely n-pentanol, n-butanol and iso-butanol. Fig. 3 shows the variation of exhaust gas temperature (EGT) for the alcohol blends in comparison to gasoline at variable load. It is observed that EGT for all the fuels shows an increasing trend with increase in load. At full load condition the EGT for gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10 and E20 were recorded to be 654 °C, 601 °C, 591 °C, 692 °C and 672 °C respectively. EGT was reduced with benzyl alcohol and ethanol addition to gasoline due to combustion enhancement and significant with increase in percentage of alcohol in the blend. It is to be noted that higher latent heat of vaporization leads to reduction in temperature inside the combustion chamber mainly during the finishing stage of induction. This significantly impacts the in cylinder temperature during final stage of compression leading to a considerable reduction in exhaust gas temperature. Even though the alcohol fuels exhibits considerable ignition delay, benzyl alcohol due to the arrangement of the benzene ring and oxygen molecule ie the improved physical properties leads to a much reduced combustion phasing than the ethanol blends E10, E20 and neat gasoline. Thus, benzyl alcohol efficiently leads the other dual fuel blends and neat gasoline in wastage of heat at the exhaust. It was inferred from the test result that a marginal reduction of 5 to 6% of EGT with benzyl alcohol blends Bn10 and Bn20 in comparison to gasoline at full load condition. From the heat release rate, it is evident that, combustion of Bn20 started early in comparison to gasoline. This leads to reduced combustion phasing and subsequently reducing the amount of energy wasted through exhaust heat. This is also indicated in improvement of BTE. It was also noted that there is a reduction in the duration of combustion due to the higher and accelerated laminar flame speed, which in turn reduces the exhaust gas temperature [12,24]. Fig. 4 shows the variation of NOx emissions for gasoline and alcohol blends at variable loads. It is observed that increase in load increases NOx emissions due to higher in-cylinder-temperature. NOx emissions are influenced by excess oxygen and in-cylinder temperature. The nitrogen bonds disintegrates and mixes with oxygen molecules in monotonic form at high temperature. Also, NOx formation was mainly influenced by the reaction rates of nitrogen molecules during bonding at higher temperatures. Nitrogen stays as N2 at lower temperature ie in diatonic form. NOx emissions values at 100% load for gasoline Bn10, Bn20, E10, E20 were recorded to be 142 ppm, 137 ppm, 141 ppm, 106 ppm and 102 ppm respectively. NOx value of gasoline (142 ppm) was the highest observed value of all the fuel specimens. Minimum NOx emissions were observed with ethanol blend in comparison to benzyl alcohol blend. The higher latent heat of vaporization with ethanol reduces the in-cylinder temperature masking the formation of NOx emissions inspite of the excess oxygen presence in the fuel [27]. NOx emissions reduced with increase in alcohol content in the blend. Higher NOx emissions with Bn10 and Bn20 is attributed to improved combustion and slightly less latent heat in comparison to E10 and E20 [24]. However, latent heat is higher with benzyl alcohol in comparison to gasoline and hence NOx for Bn10 and Bn20 is less in comparison to gasoline at all the loads. Fig. 5 displays the variation of HC emissions of all the test fuels with reference to the progressive load conditions from 20% to 100% respectively. It is clearly inferred that, a comparatively higher amount of HC emissions were recorded for all the test fuels at 20% load conditions namely 113 ppm, 88 ppm, 74 ppm, 99 ppm and 95 ppm for gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10 and E20. This is due to the inlet air fuel mixture concentration and premixing nature of the test fuels at low temperature. At lower loads, when compared to gasoline the alcohol blends gives out low HC emissions because of the enhanced combustion process which oxidises the unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. It was also noted that the oxygen concentration in the blends promote combustion rates leading to lower HC emissions than neat gasoline test fuel. Thus the concentration of air–fuel mixture at full load lowers the HC emissions and increases the combustion temperature at 100% load condition. The trend shows 88%, 62%, 57%, 74% and 70% for gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10, E20 respectively. It was inferred from the above values that the benzyl alcohol blends Bn10 and Bn20 leads over the other test fuels (ie) gasoline, E10 and E20 the HC emissions for benzyl alcohol blends showed favourable results because of its low latent heat of vaporization and faster combustion rate when compared to ethanol blends and gasoline. When compared to E10, E20 and gasoline. Bn20 at 20% load has the lowest HC emissions as it has the maximum oxygen concentration in all the test fuels used in this research. The gasoline and ethanol blends where influenced by comparatively higher latent heat of vaporization which masks the oxidation process leading to increase in HC emissions. Thus during the exhaust stroke more amount of unburnt gases escape out of the cylinder in the case of ethanol blends E10, E20. As observed in Fig. 2, increase in BTE indicates better combustion which aids in oxidation of HC emissions with benzyl alcohol. Fig. 6 displays the CO emission for neat gasoline and other test blend fuels. At the 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% load conditions. It was noted that the CO emission has steadily decreased and then increased over all the fuel blends from 20% to full load condition. At 20% load, the combustion temperature will be less which masks the formation of CO emission. On a contrary note, in the case of 100% load, increase in fuel consumption and less resident time leads to higher CO emission levels. Fig. 6 also shows the considerable reduction of CO in the blends Bn10, Bn20, E10 and E20. When compared to gasoline.at full load the CO concentration were recorded to be 0.77, 0.62, 0.5, 0.92 and 0.83% for gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10 and E20 respectively. The reason behind this reduction in emissions was the presence of oxygen molecules in the blends which actively enhanced the oxidation of CO during combustion. Thus it was inferred from the graph that the key factors for CO emissions namely poor mixing of fuel and air, localized high concentration fuel regions inside combustion chamber and incomplete combustion were clearly avoided to some extent in the dual fuel blends due to the presence of oxygen molecules present which in turn accelerates the fuel mixing and resist the CO causing factors mentioned above. When comparing the ethanol and benzyl alcohol blends, benzyl alcohol emitted minimum CO. On a precise note the least value for CO was recorded to be 0.42 for Bn20 which was at 60% load. Similar results were observed in the previous experimental research conducted by the authors [24]. Fig. 7 shows the increasing trend on CO2 emission for all the alcohol blends and gasoline with reference to different loading conditions (ie) lower to higher loads. The CO2 emission at 100% load were recorded as 8.5%, 8.3%, 7.7%, 7.3% and 7% for gasoline, Bn10, Bn20, E10, E20 respectively. CO2 emission is influenced by the carbon content in the fuel and the fuel consumption [28]. Minimum CO2 emission was observed with ethanol blend about 14% and 18% less in comparison to gasoline. The reduced carbon content with ethanol aided in the reduction of CO2 emission. CO2 emission was also less with benzyl alcohol blend due to reduced carbon content and lower fuel consumption in comparison to gasoline. Fig. 8 shows the variation of in-cylinder pressure with respect to crank angle for the gasoline, Bn20 and E20 blends at maximum load. It is observed that peak pressure was higher for Bn20 and E20 blends in comparison to gasoline. Peak pressure for gasoline, Bn20 and E20 is 29.4 bar, 32.4 bar and 30 bar respectively at maximum load. Peak pressure for Bn20 is maximum in comparison to gasoline and E20 blend. This is due to position of OH radical in the Bn20. This influences the combustion process as less energy is required for breaking the bonds and also more radicals take part in the combustion process. This leads to early occurrence of peak pressure and maximum among E20 and gasoline. Also, the presence of oxygen enhances the combustion process once the radicals are formed during combustion. The presence of excess oxygen accelerates the combustion process by aiding in improved combustion process. Fig. 9 displays the variation of heat release rate versus crank angle for gasoline, Bn20 and E20 blends at maximum load. Heat release rate was calculated based on the first law of thermodynamics from the corresponding in-cylinder pressure values. The hydrogen abstraction rate and radical formation during combustion as influenced by the activation energy required to break the bond. Bn20 requires less activation energy for breaking the bond influenced by position of OH group. This leads to increased hydrogen abstraction rate and radical formation leading to earlier start of combustion and reduced combustion phasing. Heat release rate for gasoline, Bn20 and E20 is 23.7 J/oCA, 26.4 J/oCA and 24.8 J/oCA respectively. The presence of excess oxygen along with improved hydrogen abstraction rate leads to more fuel taking part in combustion process leading to higher heat release rate with Bn20 in comparison to gasoline and E20."
3,Conclusions,"This experimental work mainly focussed on the effect of adding alcohol to gasoline upto 20% in a two cylinder commercial gasoline engine. The blend comparison was done on the basis of the order of alcohol i.e. higher and lower order. Benzyl alcohol and Ethanol were blended in 10% and 20% by volume with gasoline. The observations from the study are as follows: 1. All the four oxygenated alcohol blends showed superior performance characteristics over neat gasoline. 2. At 100% load, BTE of Bn20 was recorded to be the highest followed by Bn10, oxygenate ethanol blends and gasoline. The BTE of Bn20 was recorded to be 10% higher than of neat gasoline. 3. EGT for the higher order alcohol blends were less in comparison to gasoline because of early start of combustion and reduced combustion phasing. The oxygenated blends of ethanol showed almost equal EGT range like neat gasoline for all loads. 4. The emission parameters of the higher and lower alcohol – gasoline blends were less in comparison with gasoline at higher load conditions. It was found that the presence of more number of oxygen atoms and lower C–H ratio of benzyl alcohol enabled low emission rates over the other subjected test fuels. 5. NOx emissions were also found to be recorded low for benzyl alcohol as the high latent heat of vaporization of benzyl alcohol reduced the NOx. E20 showed the lowest NOx in all of the fuels subjected for test. 6. The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate of the higher order alcohol were superior in comparison to gasoline and other blends. The position of OH in the molecular structure plays a major role during combustion. Based on the arrived results through this experimental study, it is concluded that the higher order alcohol i.e. Benzyl Alcohol addition to gasoline in a blend form improves the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the gasoline engine."
