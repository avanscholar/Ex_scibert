0,Introduction,"Depleting fossil fuel supplies, energy security and global warming are factors driving the development of renewable energy supplies. Fermentative biological hydrogen (H2) production from renewable sources is an emerging technology, which can assist in alleviating these issues. However, logistic issues related to H2 production, storage and distribution issues are yet to be resolved [1,2]. The current study is focused on biological H2 production from low value biomass using mixed anaerobic communities. Hydrogen production using carbon neutral feedstock is considered sustainable when compared with its production from fossil fuel sources. Fermentative H2 production from renewable substrate sources using mixed anaerobic communities is regarded to have significant potential among the different biological processes under consideration [3]. Lignocellulosics has been identified as possible feedstocks for full-scale biofuel production because it is available in large quantities [4]. Anaerobic fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass has gained widespread attention since it could be used to produce H2 [5]. Switchgrass (SWG) and waste residues generated from corn and wheat processing are considered potential low-value lignocellulosic feedstocks for producing biofuels. Approximately 140 million tonnes of corn stover including waste from the corn stalks and leaves, 75 million tonnes of wheat waste and 250 million tonnes of SWG are produced annually in North America [6–9]. Among these feedstocks, SWG is a preferred bioenergy crop because of its high yield per acre and low nutrient requirements [4]. Because lignocellulosic biomass are not utilized directly by fermentative microorganisms, pretreatment is necessary to produce soluble sugar monomers [10]. Among the pretreatment methods available, steam explosion has received considerable attention for producing hydrolysates containing feedstock chemicals [11]. According to Datar et al. [12], steam explosion with acid catalysis yields a liquor containing high sugar levels. However, a major drawback to this method is the production of fermentation inhibitors such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). To achieve higher H2 yields, these inhibitors must be removed from the liquor generated by steam explosion [13]. Substrate pretreatment alone is unlikely to improve H2 production and hence, increased efforts are focused on improving the fermentation process. Several researchers have investigated the possibility of H2 production from a variety of substrates using mixed anaerobic cultures in sequencing batch and continuous flow bioreactors [14–16]; however, a major challenge is sustained H2 production. Sustained and stable H2 production is not only dependent on operational parameters such as pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), H2 partial pressure but also on the reactor configuration as well as inoculum type and source [2,17,18]. Mixed cultures are able to utilize a wide array of substrates and produce numerous byproducts because of their robustness and metabolic flexibility [19]. Theoretically, 1 mol of glucose can be converted into a maximum of 12 mol of H2. If acetate is the only reduced carbon byproduct, the maximum possible yield is 4 mol of H2 per mol glucose while 2 mol of H2 per mol glucose is produced if butyrate is the only reduced carbon byproduct. However, the maximum yield is difficult to achieve because metabolites such as ethanol, propionate and lactate are produced with acetate [20] and because of the syntrophic association between H2 producers and consumers [21]. The cause for low H2 yields is attributed to the presence of H2 consumers such as methanogens, sulfate reducing bacteria and homoacetogens. Suppression of H2 consumers to enhance H2 production can be achieved by adjusting environmental (temperature, pH) and reactor operational (HRT) conditions as well as adding chemical inhibitors or using a combination of these approaches [14,22,23]. In a pH range from 5.2 to 6.7, H2 production is favorable [20,24]. However, because methanogens and homoacetogens are active in this range [25,26], it is necessary to add microbial inhibitors such as long-chain fatty acid (LCFAs) to inhibit these microorganisms. Linoleic acid (LA), a LCFA with 18 carbons and 2 unsaturated CC bonds (C18:2), is a potent H2 consumers' inhibitor [27]. Studies by Rinzema et al. [28] have also shown that aceticlastic methanogens is inhibited by approximately 1200 to 1600 mg L−1 capric acid (C10:0). Adjusting the HRT can affect the H2 yield by retaining or washing-out H2 consuming methanogens [29]. HRT values where maximum H2 yields have been reported vary from 5 to 48 h for mixed cultures fed different substrates [23,30–32]. This large HRT range demonstrates that optimization is essential for different cultures and reactor systems fed various substrates. Experimental design is essential in optimizing H2 production because the outcome is influenced by many factors [20,21]. Data from past studies indicate that pH, HRT and culture treatment are among the most important factors controlling fermentative H2 production [14,33]. Interaction between these factors on H2 producing cultures have been reported in several studies. According to Won and Lau [34], the optimum pH for fermentative H2 production is linked to the HRT. Factor interaction on H2 production has also been reported by Ray et al. [35]. They showed that adjusting the pH and LA level are more effective than adjusting individual parameters. Based on these reports, a statistical design was used in this study to assess the relative contributions of different factors on optimizing conditions for enhancing the H2 yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to optimize factors which subsequently leads to a maximum response. RSM is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques that are useful for modeling and analysis in applications where the response of interest is influenced by several factors and the objective is to optimize the response [36]. Among the various RSM methods, Box–Behnken design (BBD) has many broad application because of its simplicity; fewer experiments are required to be performed and the method allows efficient estimation of first- and second-order coefficients as well as interaction coefficients [37]. The use of SWG as a model biomass has been demonstrated for bio-ethanol production by Vadas et al. [4]. However, there are no published reports of bio-H2 production from SWG-derived sugars using mixed anaerobic cultures in continuous reactor systems. Hence, one objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pH, HRT and LA concentration on H2 production from a liquor derived from steam exploded SWG using a statistical approach. Another objective was to examine the effects of the three factors on a H2 producing mixed anaerobic microbial community."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw material,"2.1 Raw material Switchgrass obtained from a grower in Leamington, Ontario, Canada, was used as a raw material in this study. The material was air-dried at room temperature to an equilibrium moisture content of <3% and milled using a shredder (Retsch GmbH, Germany) to an average particle size of 5 × 2 mm."
3,Sugar production from switchgrass,"2.2 Sugar production from switchgrass A 4 L steam explosion reactor (ZC 4 L Zipperclave® stirred reactor (Autoclave Engineers, Erie, PA, U.S.)) was used to pretreat the SWG. The reactor was equipped with a 4-L vessel and designed to reach maximum temperatures and pressures of 232 °C and 20.7 MPa, respectively. After treating the SWG with 1% wt/wt H2SO4 at room temperature for 12 h, water was added to attain a 10% wt/wt mixture. The content of the reactor containing the acid treated biomass (10% wt/wt mixture) was heated to 190 °C and mixed at 815 rpm. Mixing at 190 °C was maintained for 10 min and then, the reactor contents was rapidly cooled using cold water and depressurized (i.e., steam exploded) by releasing the pressure. After filtering the exploded material, the pH of the liquor was adjusted to pH 7.0 using 10 M NaOH. The liquor was filtered through a 0.45 μm glass microfiber filter and then treated with a polymeric adsorbent (Amberlite XAD-4; Rohm and Haas (Philadelphia, PA)). Next, the adsorbent-treated liquor was filtered through a 0.45 μm glass microfiber filter and the filtrate was stored at 4 °C prior to use. The stored absorbent-treated liquor was filtered again and used as a feed to the anaerobic microbial culture. The water-soluble extract (liquor) was characterized by analyzing for sugars, acetic acid and sugar-degradation products (i.e., furfural and HMF)."
4,Inoculum preparation and basal medium,"2.3 Inoculum preparation and basal medium The granular culture used in this study to seed the reactor was obtained from a brewery wastewater treatment facility (Guleph, ON). The volatile suspended solids (VSS) of the granular culture was 50 g VSS L−1. In reactors (designated as reactors A and B) maintained at 37 °C, the granular culture was diluted with basal medium to achieve a VSS level of 30 g L−1. During acclimation over a 3-week period, the sugar concentration fed to the granular cultures was increased incrementally at 1 g L−1 per week after beginning at an initial concentration of 2 g L−1 (glucose (50%) and xylose (50%)) mixture. Reactors A and B were operated in sequencing batch mode with a 6 d HRT to acclimate the cultures. After acclimation, the granular cultures from the reactors were diluted to a VSS level of 10 g L−1 with basal media. The diluted culture was used to seed two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBRs). Cultures in the UASBRs were fed the SWG liquor containing mixed sugars (5 g COD L−1). The basal medium used for the experiment contained the following ingredients (mg L−1): NH4 HCO3, 70; KCl, 25; K2HPO4, 14; (NH4)2SO4, 10; Yeast extract, 10; MgCl2·4H2O, 9; FeCl2·4H2O, 2; EDTA, 1; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.5; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.15; Na2SeO3, 0.1; (NH4)6MoO7·4H2O, 0.09; ZnCl2, 0.05; H3BO3, 0.05; NiCl2·6H2O, 0.05; and CuCl2·2H2O, 0.03 [38]. The sugar (liquor described in Section 2.2) mixture used to feed cultures in the UASBRs was stored at 4 °C before feeding to the reactor."
5,Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor setup and operation,"2.4 Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor setup and operation Two UASBRs, 9.5 L (8.5 L liquid and 1 L headspace), 12 cm (inner diameter) were used in this study. A schematic representation of the UASBR is shown in Fig. 1 . The UASBRs were seeded with granular culture (10 g VSS L−1) and then sparged with nitrogen (N2) for 10 min to maintain anaerobic conditions. The reactors were operated with a 24 h HRT at 37 °C to acclimate the culture to a feed containing pure sugars (a 50:50 mixture of glucose and xylose) at a loading rate of 5 g L−1 d−1. Internal recirculation was used to assist with the fluidization of granules in the UASBRs. This operational configuration was employed to enhance mixing, prevent granule from settling and enhance mass transfer. All experiments were conducted in duplicate. Gas production was monitored using a wet-tip gas meter [39]."
6,Optimization study,"2.5 Optimization study The experimental design was based on the 3 K factorial Box–Behnken design (BBD) [37]. The model was used to optimize key process parameters (HRT, pH and LA) to enhance H2 production. The factors, levels and experimental design are shown in Table 1 . The response variables (H2 or methane (CH4) yield) and associated factors were HRT (8, 12, and 16 h), pH (5.0, 6.0 and 7.0), and LA concentration (0, 1 and 2 g L−1). A total of 14 experiments were conducted with two center points replicates (Table 1). The relationship between the coded and actual values is described by Equation (1). (1) x i = ( X i − X i ∗ ) Δ X i where x i is the coded value of the ith independent variable, X i is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable, X i ∗ is the uncoded value of the ith independent variable at the center point, and ΔX i is the step change value. The quadratic polynomial equations used to predict conditions for maximum H2 production and a minimum methane production can be described using Equation (2). In Equation (2), the terms (2) Y = α o + ∑ i = 1 3 α i X i + ∑ i = 1 3 α i i X i 2 + ∑ i = 1 3 ∑ i < j = 2 3 α i j X i X j are defined as follows: X i 's are input variables which influence the response variable Y (H2 or CH4), α 0 is an offset term, α i is the ith linear coefficient, α ii is the quadratic coefficient, and α ij is the ijth interaction coefficient. The input X i values in Equation (2) correspond to the different experimental factors (X 1 = HRT, X 2 = pH and X 3 = LA concentration) (Table 1). The equation was solved by setting the partial derivative to zero [40]. The model was evaluated using Minitab 16 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using the responses (H2 and CH4 production) observed at each condition shown in Table 1. A multiple regression analysis was performed using the experimental response to determine the coefficient values for fitting the model. The model was verified using an analysis of residuals (difference between the predicted and observed values in the response). A normal distribution of the residuals indicates a good fit to the experimental data. The Anderson–Darling (AD) test was used to determine deviation of the residuals from a normal distribution [41]. The D-optimality analysis was performed using an algorithm in the Minitab statistical software. The D-optimality analysis was used to obtain an optimal level for the three factors used in the design (maximize the H2 yield and minimize the CH4 yield). This was achieved by minimizing the variance in the parameter estimation of the model [42]."
7,Analytical methods,"2.6 Analytical methods The chemical composition (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) of the raw and steam-exploded SWG was estimated using methods described by Goering and Van Soest [43] and Updegraff [44]. The SWG filtered liquor (see Section 2.2) was diluted (1:50) and stored in 5 mL polypropylene vials (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) prior to analysis for different sugars. The sugar analysis was performed using a DX-600 Ion Chromatograph (IC) equipped with a 15 cm × 3 mm CarboPac PA 20 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and configured with an automated sampler (AS40), a gradient pump (GP50) and an electrochemical detector (ED50 model (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA)). The eluent (50% 40 mM NaOH solution) flow rate was set at 0.2 mL min−1. The detection limit for arabinose, galactose, glucose, manose and xylose was 1 mg L−1 using a 25 μL injection volume. Detection of furfural and HMF was performed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA)). The HPLC was configured with a photodiode array (PDA) detector and a 3.0 × 100 mm Eclipse plus C18 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The flow rate of the eluent (80% of 0.5% H3PO4 solution and 20% methanol) was set at 0.2 mL min−1. The analysis was conducted under isocratic conditions using an oven set at 50 °C. The instrument was set to scan at 205, 215, 252 and 280 nm. The detection limits for furfural and HMF were 0.5 mg L−1 for a 10 μL injection volume. The total phenol content in the steam exploded liquor was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent [45]. Catechol was used as the standard. The detection limit for total phenols was 20 mg L−1. Gas samples (25 μL) from the head space of the gas meter were analyzed for H2, CH4, and CO2 using a gas chromatograph (GC) according to Chowdhury et al. [27]. The detection limits of H2 and CH4 were 0.0032 kPa (5 μL per 160 mL) and 0.0064 kPa (10 μL per 160 mL), respectively. The IC and HPLC methods used to analyze for alcohol and VFAs in the UASB feed and effluent liquid samples were conducted in accordance to procedures described by Chowdhury et al. [27] and Moon et al. [46]. The detection limit for alcohols (ethanol, i-propanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and i-butanol) and VFAs (lactate, acetate, propionate, formate, and butyrate) were 5 and 2 mg L−1, respectively. The TSS and VSS content of the biomass and seed culture were determined according to Standard Methods [47]. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) for the influent substrate and effluent products were measured using a closed reflux calorimetric method according to Standard Methods [47]."
8,Principal component analysis,"2.7 Principal component analysis A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using the PAST software package version 2.15 [48]. The PCA was used to establish the relationship between the different experimental conditions (Table 1). The PCA was used to identify variables, which accounted for the major variance in the data set under the different operating conditions. A biplot was used to complement the PCA by superimposing the scatter and loading plot such that clustering of the samples based on the fermentation pattern and the importance of a particular loading responsible for separating the samples in the cluster. The gas and liquid metabolite COD-equivalent values were used as inputs to assess the effect of the factors involved in the distribution of the metabolic profile for mixed microbial fermentation."
9,Microbial community analysis using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism,2.8 Microbial community analysis using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism Microbial community diversity of the mixed culture was determined using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S rRNA gene followed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Microbial samples were removed from the bottom of the reactor while purging with nitrogen. Details of the T-RFLP protocol was previously described by Chaganti et al. [18]. Hae III and Hha I T-RFLP profiles were derived from the raw datasets comprising the peaks which reflected the base pair (bp) size of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs). The composition of microbial consortia in the mixed microbial community was estimated by the number of T-RFs (bands) which were generated in the Hae III and Hha I digest of 16S rRNA genes amplified by PCR. Replicate samples were aligned based on band size and intensity using the moving average algorithm in the T-align software [49]. A multivariate cluster analysis (MCA) was also performed using the Kulczynski similarity index to relate the samples based on the T-RFs presence–absence [50]. The cluster analysis was used to maximize the homogeneity within the cluster by grouping samples based on their similarity while maximizing the heterogeneity between the clusters.
10,Results and discussion,
11,Material balance,"3.1 Material balance A mass balance for the different chemical constituents in the SWG is shown in Fig. 2 . The results reveal that approximately 83% of the hemicellulosic sugars were recovered in the steam exploded liquor. The water-soluble extract was analyzed for sugars, acetic acid and sugar-degradation products (furfural and HMF). From 1000 g of dry material, approximately 620 g of pretreated solids was recovered after pretreatment. The total sugar yield after steam explosion was 28 ± 2% (on a mass basis) on a dry basis of the untreated biomass. The quantity of fermentation inhibitors (furfural, HMF and phenolic compounds) removed after treatment with the XAD-4 resin was 68 ± 7% (on a mass basis). After resin treatment, the total hexose recovered was 23 ± 2% (on a mass basis) of the untreated dry biomass."
12,Optimization of maximum hydrogen and minimum methane yield,"3.2 Optimization of maximum hydrogen and minimum methane yield The optimum level for each single factor and combining two different factors (i.e., interaction effects) were determined using a BBD model. Many studies have examined the effect of different factors on H2 production using a single factor design or one-factor-at-a-time approach [51]. For example, the effects of initial pH, substrate concentration and inhibitor concentration on H2 production in batch cultures have been reported in many studies [27,35,52,53]. Other studies have optimized H2 production using a multiple-factor design (or factorial design) [23,54,55]. In this study, optimization of HRT and pH along with the LA concentration was conducted to enhance H2 production from SWG. The design matrix of the factors together with the experimental design is shown in Table 1. The data shows the independent variables X 1, X 2 and X 3 had a significant effect on the H2 yield (Table 1). The response at the center point (pH 6.0, 12 h HRT, and 1.0 g L−1 of LA) was 65.2 ± 5.4 mL H2 g−1 TVS and 4.3 ± 1.3 mL CH4 g−1 TVS. However, a maximum H2 yield of 95.1 ± 1.4 mL g−1 TVS was observed at pH 5.0, a 12 h HRT and 2 g L−1 LA (Table 1). In contrast, a maximum CH4 yield of 31.6 ± 2.5 mL g−1 TVS was obtained at pH 6.0, an HRT of 16 h and with no LA added. This deviation in the H2 and CH4 yields is likely due to a decrease in pH coupled with increasing the LA concentration. The increasing H2 yield with increasing LA concentrations is in agreement with the findings by Chowdhury et al. [27]. These authors reported an increase in the H2 yield and a decrease in the CH4 yield with increasing LA concentrations (500–2000 mg L−1) in batch reactors fed glucose at an initial pH of 7.6. According to Fang and Liu [56], pH is an important factor affecting H2 production because of its effects on the H2 production rate, metabolic pathways and microbial community. This suggests that a decrease in pH results in an increased H2 yield and decreased CH4 yield. In comparison to data from this study, Fang and Liu [56] reported a maximum H2 yield of 2.1 ± 0.1 mol mol−1 glucose at pH 5.5 with a 6 h HRT. In this study, a maximum H2 yield of 2.5 ± 0.1 mol mol−1 hexose was observed at pH 5.0 with a 12 h HRT and 2 g L−1 LA (Table 1). The regression equation obtained using the coded variables show the H2 yield and CH4 yield as a function of pH, HRT and LA concentration. Linear, quadratic and interaction terms are included in the second-order polynomial equation regardless of their significance (Equations (3) and (4)). (3) H 2 yield = a 0 + a 1 × HRT + a 2 × pH + a 3 × LA + a 4 × HRT × pH + a 5 × HRT × LA + a 6 × pH × LA + a 7 × HRT 2 + a 8 × pH 2 + a 9 × LA 2 (4) CH 4 yield = b 0 + b 1 × HRT + b 2 × pH + b 3 × LA + b 4 × HRT × pH + b 5 × HRT × LA + b 6 × pH × LA + b 7 × HRT 2 + b 8 × pH 2 + b 9 × LA 2"
13,Analysis of the experimental design,"3.3 Analysis of the experimental design 3.3.1 Effect of factor variables on the hydrogen and methane yield The effect of three factor variables (pH, HRT and LA concentration) on the response variables (H2 and CH4 yields) is shown in Fig. 3 . Reducing the pH was associated with increasing the H2 yield. An opposite trend was observed for the CH4 yield and pH. Cultures fed an inhibitory LA concentration (1.0 g L−1) exhibited a significant increase in the H2 yield when compared with the control cultures fed no LA. A similar effect was also reported by Pendyala et al. [57] in batch reactors fed a mixture of steam-pretreated food and paper-cardboard waste. However, the maximum H2 yield observed by these authors was 72 ± 13 mL g−1 TVS for granular cultures fed 5 g COD L−1 of a steam exploded liquor and treated with 2 g L−1 LA at 37 °C and pH 5.0. The yield reported by Pendyala et al. [57] is approximately 23% less than that obtained in this study. Variations in the HRT within the levels under consideration had negligible effect on the H2 or CH4 yield (Fig. 3). However, note according to Zhang et al. [30], the H2 yield is influenced significantly by the HRT. These researchers also concluded that a stable H2 producing microbial population was established by washing out propionate producers at a low HRT. 3.3.2 Contour plots To assess the effect of varying pH, HRT and LA levels on methanogenic activity, two responses, the H2 yield and CH4 yield at the defined operating conditions (Table 1), were used in developing the contour plots (Fig. 4 A–C). Predicting the optimum factor range was conducted by overlaying the H2 and CH4 responses. Notice the interaction effects of the independent variables on the two different responses was identified using the overlay plots [58]. The overlay plots (Fig. 4A–C) was used to predict the responses (H2 and CH4 yields) given the pH, HRT and LA concentration. Hydrogen yields greater than 73 mL g−1 TVS with low CH4 levels (≤2 mL g−1 TVS) were observed at pH less than 5.8 and a LA concentration greater than 0.9 g L−1 (Fig. 4A). A similar effect was observed at pH values below 5.5 and HRT values in the range of 9–13 h (Fig. 4B). Several reports have demonstrated that pH is an important factor influencing acidogenic fermentation [56,59,60]. In this study, the data indicate optimum factor ranges for increasing the H2 yield were as follows: pH 5.0–5.5, 0.9–2.0 g L−1 LA and 8–13 h HRT. In comparison, Pendyala et al. [57] reported a low H2 yield (0.75 mol mol−1 glucose equivalent) for batch cultures maintained over a pH range from 5.5 to 6.0 at 37 °C and fed a 9.4 g COD L−1 food and paper-cardboard hydrolysate plus 1.6 g L−1 LA. Supporting studies by Antonopoulou et al. [15] and Fang and Liu [56] have provided evidence of optimum H2 production at low pH. The operating pH for optimum H2 production is variable and depends on factor such as reactor type, the type of substrate and source of inoculum. Reported pH for optimum H2 production in batch reactors are primarily for initial pH conditions. Note over the duration of batch studies the expected pH change is due to metabolite production. In continuous flow bioreactors, the pH range for enhanced H2 production is reported between pH 5.0–7.0 [15,20,61–63]. In comparison, in this study, between a pH range of 5.0–5.7 for HRT values between 8 to 13 h and in presence of 0.9 to 2.0 g L−1 LA, the H2 yield was ≥73 mL g−1 TVS (Fig. 4A and B). However, with a pH range 5.0–7.0 and in the presence of 0.0–0.7 g L−1 of LA, the CH4 yield reached ≥13 mL g−1 TVS with HRT values between 8 and 16 h (Fig. 4A and C). In controls, the CH4 yield attained a maximum of 31.6 ± 2.5 mL g−1 TVS (experiment#1, Table 1). Low CH4 yields observed were attributed to a combination of factors, which includes low HRTs, low pH and a threshold LA concentration (Table 1). According to Chandra et al. [64], a long HRT is required for establishing methanogenic conditions. Decreasing the HRT coupled with reducing the pH or increasing the LA concentration was effective in enhancing the H2 yield (Fig. 4B and C). The combined effect of LA at a lower pH with a reduction in HRT has been reported to suppress methanogenesis and enhance the H2 yield [14]. Studies by Liu et al. [65] have shown the effect of varying pH at a constant HRT and also changing HRT at a fixed pH on H2 and CH4 production from a kitchen waste. Liu et al. [65] also provided evidence showing that methanogenesis was suppressed at low HRTs and H2 production was not stable while operating at pH 7.0. They also showed that when the pH was maintained at 5.5 with a 3 d HRT, H2 production was stable at a level of 21 ± 2 mL g−1 TVS. The combined effect of HRT and LA concentration revealed that HRT values greater than 14 h or LA concentrations below 0.5 g L−1 were associated with high CH4 levels and low H2 yields (Fig. 4C). In comparison, studies by Chowdhury et al. [27] have shown methanogenesis is only suppressed in batch cultures at a threshold LA level of 2.0 g L−1 for a pH at 7.6. Work demonstrating the impact of HRT on H2 production by Chen et al. [29] has shown that HRTs ranging from 6 to 13.3 h was required for stable H2 production with simultaneous suppression of methanogenesis. A comparison of H2 production from this study and data reported in the literature using a variety of substrates under different operating conditions is shown in Table 2 ."
14,Validating the response surface model,"3.4 Validating the response surface model 3.4.1 Analysis of variance A statistical analysis of the BBD response surface model was conducted by comparing the fit of a second-order polynomial equation with the experimental data using ANOVA (Table 3 ). The ANOVA tested the significance of the model equation (Equations (5) and (6)). The ANOVA revealed that the quadratic models were significant for both H2 and CH4 production. Model terms with values of ‘Prob of F’ less than 0.05 are considered significant, whereas values greater than 0.05 are insignificant. The F test values for many of the model terms had low probabilities (P < 0.005). The F-statistic values of 76.8 and 105.4 (Table 3) for H2 and CH4, respectively, were greater than the F-critical value of 2.01 at α = 0.05. These results indicate that the variance is not due to random chance but rather to the influence of the factors and their levels. The model was evaluated based on the correlation coefficient (R). A high value indicates a good degree of fit. The R values of 0.925 and 0.945 for the H2 and CH4 models, respectively, suggest good correlation between the predicted and observed response values [66]. The coefficient of determination (squared multiple-correlation coefficient, R 2) values of 0.937 and 0.953 for H2 and CH4, respectively, indicate that the model accounted for more than 93% and 95% of the total variance. Note the model predictions fit well with experimental observations. The interactions (Table 3) between HRT and LA (F = 0.8741, p = 0.354) and pH and LA (F = 3.3832, p = 0.07) were insignificant for the H2 yield. For the CH4 model, the interaction term (HRT × pH) and quadratic term (pH2) were insignificant with p-values >0.05. 3.4.2 Response surface model verification A multiple regression analysis of the experimental data was used to estimate the regression coefficients for the factors included in the model. The relationship between the response variables and the experimental factors based on the coded variables is shown as Equations (5) and (6). (5) H 2 yield = 65.183 − 3.300 × HRT − 16.574 × pH + 28.239 × LA − 9.892 × HRT 2 − 4.773 × pH 2 − 15.866 × LA 2 + 5.874 × HRT × pH − 1.762 × HRT × LA − 3.466 × pH × LA (6) CH 4 yield = 4.304 + 1.447 × HRT + 4.484 × pH − 9.068 × LA + 3.398 × HRT 2 + 0.840 × pH 2 + 8.612 × LA 2 + 0.551 × HRT ∗ pH − 5.623 × HRT × LA − 1.211 × pH × LA The computed regression coefficients with their corresponding significance value (p) are shown in Table 4 . Regression coefficients with p-values <0.05 indicate significant differences between the model and experimental observations. The independent variables were examined to determine their significance in the model equation. Of the independent variables and their interactions that were analyzed, only the two terms for each H2 (pH × LA and LA × HRT) and CH4 (pH × HRT and pH × pH) were insignificant (p > 0.05) (Table 4) based on the ANOVA. Negative coefficients suggest that the factor or interaction showed an unfavorable effect on the H2 or CH4 yield. The negative coefficient for the independent variable pH (Equation (5)) indicates an unfavorable effect on the H2 yield with increasing pH. In comparison, the positive coefficient for the pH term (Equation (6)) indicates a favorable effect on the CH4 yield with increasing pH. Notice the interaction between pH and HRT suggest a favorable effect on the H2 yield. Comparing the models responses and the experimental data was performed to assess the adequacy of the model. The responses computed from the model (using Equations (5) and (6)) correlated well with the experimental data (Fig. 5 A and B). The regression coefficient for the H2 and CH4 model was 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. The residuals were also examined using the AD test to evaluate the adequacy of fit between the model and the experimental data. The AD statistic was 0.58 for H2 and 0.63 for CH4. Values less than the critical value of 0.752 for a sample size of 56 at a 5% level of significance suggests the residuals satisfied the normal distribution requirement (p > 0.05; Fig. 6 A). This confirmed the models fit with the experimental data over the defined parameter levels. The D-optimality plot was used to demonstrate minimization of the variance and to establish optimal levels of the independent variables to attain the desired response. A numerical optimization was performed by varying the D-optimal value between zero and one. The optimal levels of HRT, pH and LA for the maximum and minimum experimental response (H2 and CH4, respectively) were identified at the largest D-optimality value by varying the factor settings in the algorithm (Fedorov Exchange Algorithm). The optimality plot for the H2 and CH4 yield was obtained at a D-optimal value of 0.9986 (Fig. 6B). The maximum H2 and minimum CH4 yields were 94.12 and 0.92 mL g−1 TVS, respectively, at pH 5.0 with a 10.8 h HRT and 1.76 g L−1 LA. Validation of the model performed at the nearest optimum condition revealed an experimental outcome of 99.9 ± 5.6 mL H2 g−1 TVS and 0.5 ± 0.1 mL CH4 g−1 TVS at pH 5.0, an HRT of 10 h and 1.75 g L−1 LA. Note that the optimized conditions for maximum H2 yield and minimum CH4 yield from SWG that were obtained from the D-optimality analysis also fall within the optimum range depicted by the overlay contours shown in Fig. 4A–C. 3.4.3 Component contribution to responses The percent contribution of each term in the model for the H2 and CH4 yield is shown in Fig. 7 A and B. The percent contribution is calculated based on the sum of squares (SS) obtained from the ANOVA (Table 3). The individual SS divided by the total SS is represented as a percent. The total percent contribution for the first-order, quadratic and interaction terms was obtained by summing the contribution from each term (Fig. 7A and B). The results indicate that the first-order component accounted for the major contribution to the H2 or CH4 yield. The percent contribution of the LA term (X 3) was significant in either case (63.4% and 52.8% for the H2 and CH4 yields, respectively). The interaction component (X 1 × X 2, X 2 × X 3 and X 1 × X 3) for the predicted H2 and CH4 yield exhibited the lowest level of significance with a total contribution of approximately 2% and 11%, respectively (Fig. 7A and B)."
15,Metabolite production,"3.5 Metabolite production A mass balance (on a COD basis) was used to examine the product distribution in the liquid and gas phases. The results of this analysis are provided in Table 5 . The range of the COD mass balance from 83 ± 13 to 111 ± 09% validates the reliability of the data. The VFAs distribution profile is an indicator of the efficiency of the H2 production. HAc and HBu were the major soluble metabolites detected under the different experimental conditions. Elevated HAc levels were observed in the control cultures at pH 5.0 and 6.0; however, in the LA treated cultures, the lower levels were observed except for the condition where maximum H2 production was observed (experiment #12, Table 1). In the presence of 2.0 g L−1 LA, the HAc level increased and reached a maximum level of approximately 1640 ± 220 mg COD L−1 with a corresponding maximum H2 yield (experiment #12, Tables 1 and 5) at pH 5.0. High H2 yields are generally associated with elevated HAc and/or HBu levels [59,67]. Notice the HAc concentration was low with increasing pH levels within the range of LA concentrations under consideration. Several studies have shown evidence of high HAc levels under low pH conditions [12,14,24]. A shift in the HRT did not have any effect on the HAc levels. The HBu concentration was maximized at the center point of the design with a concentration equivalent to 1204 ± 166 mg COD L−1. In this study, at any HRT condition, the high ethanol (EtOH) levels observed were associated with pH 6.0 and 7.0 in both LA-treated and untreated cultures (Table 5). Similar observations have been reported at high pH levels (6.0–6.8) for cultures fed sucrose operating at 8 h HRT [59]. The high HPr levels detected were associated with low H2 yields (Tables 1 and 5). This decrease in H2 yield is explained by considering Equation (7) in which H2 produced during acidogenesis is used for HPr production [30]. (7) C6H12O6 + 2H2 → 2CH3CH2COOH + 2H2O In addition to HAc, HPr and HBu, lactate (HLa) was also detected. The percent COD equivalents shifted to HLa were within the range of 2–8%. The presence of HLa and HPr was observed in mixed anaerobic cultures fed steam-exploded food and cardboard-paper waste blends in both control and LA-treated cultures [57]. This suggests that adding LA or lowering the pH did not prevent the formation of reduced end products such as HLa and HPr."
16,Principal component analysis,"3.6 Principal component analysis The PCA biplot was used to demonstrate the effect of the different operating conditions employed on H2 fermentation from SWG. The location of samples on the biplot illustrates the variability induced by different factors on the distribution of the fermentation pattern (Fig. 8 ). The vector length for each metabolite shown in the PCA bi-plot represents the level of association of the metabolite with each of the principal components (PC 1 and PC 2). The strength of the relationship is indicated by the percent values on the ordinates of the bi-plot. Thus, the influence of these metabolites in grouping the operational conditions according to similarities in the relationships between correlated variables is depicted by the position of each operating condition in relation to the bi-plot's ordinates (PC 1 and PC 2), by its proximity to other operating conditions and metabolite loading vectors within the plane of the bi-plot. The distribution of samples observed in the biplot is based on culture treatment i.e., adding LA and/or pH adjustment (Fig. 8). Clustering of the untreated cultures (0 g L−1 of LA) is an indication of their association with CH4 production in comparison to the LA fed culture (Experiments #1–4, Table 1). Conditions showing maximum H2 yields were grouped in a different cluster (Experiments #12 and 14, Table 1). Values in the brackets denote the loading value. Vectors for H2 (0.79), HBu (0.92) and EtOH (0.41) on the bi-plot were positioned in the positive direction. Methane was observed in the negative direction with loading values of both the first (0.93) and second components (0.27). The CH4 vector, which was oriented opposite to the H2 vector, indicated that high CH4 yields are associated with low H2 yields. Similar observations for HAc, which had a loading (0.70) in the positive direction of the second component, and EtOH, which has a loading (0.83) in the negative direction, were observed. The orientation of variables (H2 and EtOH) at opposite directions on the bi-plot is because lower yields of H2 are associated with higher EtOH yields. Low H2 yields are associated with the production of reduced end products such as EtOH, HLa and HPr [20]. In mixed anaerobic communities, analogous conclusions were reported based on the operating conditions and their association to experimental factor variables [14,17,57]. In the control cultures (no LA), methane production (17 ± 2 to 32 ± 3 mL g−1 TVS) was observed under high pH conditions (Table 1), whereas the H2 yield (62 ± 3 to 95 ± 1 mL g−1 TVS) was associated with lower pH conditions (Table 1). Acetic acid production linked primarily with the untreated control conditions rather than with H2-producing conditions was likely due to the acetogenic activity with untreated culture (Table 1). In this study, the elevated EtOH levels and associated lower H2 yields observed at pH 6.0 and 7.0 is supported by work conducted by Cai et al. [68]. These authors reported high EtOH levels and reduced H2 yields at pH 7.0 for Clostridium butyricum fed glucose."
17,Microbial profile of switchgrass fermented consortia,"3.7 Microbial profile of switchgrass fermented consortia A non-parametric multivariate cluster tree was developed from the T-RF profile for the SWG steam exploded liquor fed mixed microbial consortia. Similarity between different microbial species was determined using the Kulczynski similarity cluster index [50]. The right column (leaf nodes) of the dendrogram shows data for each individual condition and the nodes representing the clusters. The horizontal lines represent the similarity between the populations. The cluster tree was divided into four major clades (A–D) and one separate sample designated as E, which exhibited no significant similarity with the other clades (Fig. 9 ). High H2 yields (≥57 ± 7 mL g−1 TVS) at pH 5.0 and 6.0 and in the presence of LA was observed in the Clade A cultures with a similarity ranging from 10% to 25%. The reason for the low similarity among the clade A cultures might be due to differences in the microbial community at the species level. The maximum H2 yield observed in cultures maintained at pH 5, fed 2 g L−1 LA and at a 12 h HRT (Experiment #12, Table 1) was observed in the clade A. Greater than 70% of the culture composition under this condition (Experiment #12, Table 1) included Clostridiaceae (Butyrivibrio crossotus, C. botulinum, C. cochlearium), and Ruminococcaceae. In addition to 2 g L−1 LA fed cultures, cultures fed with 1 g L−1 of LA and with a 16 h HRT and pH 5.0 was observed in clade A (Experiment #5, Table 1). The discrepancy within the sample grouping, likely caused by similar pH levels, resulted in an enriched H2-producing consortium which included Clostridium beijerinckii, C. kainantoi, C. proteolyticum, C. oceanicum, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, C. cellulovorans and Eubacterium dolichum. Clade B contained microorganisms from cultures not fed LA (untreated control samples) and in which methane production was dominant (Fig. 8). Clade B shared a similarity index of 18% in the cluster tree; however, cultures within clade B similarity ranged from 30% to 42%. This clade also contained one LA fed culture (1 g L−1) with a 16 h HRT and pH 7.0. Overlapping of the controls with the LA treated cultures could be attributed to high pH, low LA concentration (1 g L−1) and long HRT conditions. Cultures in clade C shared a similarity of 5% in the cluster tree. Cultures in clade C were associated with low pH (5.0, 6.0) and a LA concentration (1 g L−1). Clade A cultures, which were associated with similar pH levels (5.0 and 6.0), were positioned away from clade C on the cluster tree and shared a 10% similarity. This variation might be due to the change in the HRT and/or LA concentration. Although clades A and C and the sample designated as E shared a low similarity on the cluster tree (Fig. 9), they produced similar H2 levels and exhibited a similar metabolic profile (Table 1, Fig. 8). The low similarity between the clades containing samples from different fermenting conditions was likely due to differences in bands and their correspondingly related microbial species. Clade D, which had the highest similarity index of approximately 62%, consisted of culture samples treated with LA, a pH level of 7.0 and lower HRTs (8 and 12 h). These conditions likely caused the separation of clade D cultures from those in clade B, which comprised cultures not treated with LA. An exception to this was a culture in clade B which was treated with 1 g L−1 and operated under a 16 h HRT at pH 7.0. The high cophenetic correlation coefficient of 0.91 supported using the T-RFLP data in the cluster analysis. A high cophenetic correlation closer to 1.0 indicates that more accuracy in clustering of the data based on the T-RFs. In experiments performed without LA, irrespective of the change in the pH and HRT, the different microbial communities detected included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidia, Betaproteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Methanobacteria, Methanomicrobia, Methanococci, Ruminococcaceae and Synergistaceae with methanogens as the dominant group. Note the presence of Clostridium sp. and Rumincoccus sp. along with Synergistaceae under high pH conditions is likely the cause for the presence of EtOH and mixed acid metabolites. Similar fermentation patterns at high pH levels have been reported in studies using mixed anaerobic cultures [69,70]. According to Kong et al. [71], Ruminococcaceae, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria along with the archaea methanogens were detected in the rumen communities fed barley silage or grass hay diets with or without flaxseed. Lowering the HRT from 16 h to 8 h and changing the pH from 7.0 to 5.0 simultaneously reduced 50% of relative abundance of the T-RFs belonging to the methanogenic population and increased the relative abundance of T-RFs belonging to members of Clostridiaceae (Appendix A, Fig. A1). Note the expected increase in the H2 yield was not observed because of the possibly existence of methanogens and other H2 consumers. The present results are in contrast to work reported by Won and Lau [34] and Liu et al. [65]. These authors observed that methanogens was suppressed by reducing the pH and lowering the HRT. Data from this study confirmed that lowering the pH from 7.0 to 5.0 and changing the HRT from 16 h to 8 h did not completely eliminate methanogenesis. In comparison, studies by Kim et al. [72] have shown that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are able to tolerate acidic conditions under high HRT and low pH conditions. Similarly studies by Krakat et al. [73] have shown an increase in the diversity of methanogens under low HRT conditions. In this study, decreasing the HRT from 16 h to 12 h and lowering the pH to 6.0 or 5.0 in the presence of LA (2 g L−1), reduced the diversity of the microbial population. These conditions likely suppressed the activity of methanogenic and propionate producers. In addition, the relative abundance of the T-RFs belonging to the homoacetogenic population was reduced without affecting dominant H2 producers such as Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiaceae (Appendix A, Fig. A1). Comparative studies by Zhang et al. [30] have shown reducing the HRT to 6 h eliminates the propionate-producing population in a glucose fed heat and acid treated mixed culture maintained at pH 5.5 and at 37 °C. Wu et al. [74] observed that H2 consumption by homoacetogenesis at longer HRTs using glucose as a substrate was suppressed under low HRT conditions. Supporting evidence by Chaganti et al. [14] has shown that low pH coupled with LA treatment was able to decrease the homoacetogenic activity in a H2-producing culture. Note in this study, reducing the HRT from 12 h to 8 h caused Ruminococcaceae to become more dominant than the Clostridiaceae population. Although Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiaceae are H2 producers, Ruminococcaceae can also produce ethanol; however, this route is dependent on the environmental conditions. According to Liu et al. [69], in a UASB operating under a 12 h HRT and containing a mixed microbial consortium fed with glucose at pH 4.5, the major products produced included ethanol, H2, and acetate. These researchers also reported Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae were the dominant microbial populations. In comparison to published data, a larger H2 yield was observed at a 12 h HRT (95 ± 1 mL H2 g−1 TVS) when compared to an 8 h HRT (83 ± 3 mL H2 g−1 TVS). Under both HRT conditions, the culture was maintained at a low pH (5.0 and 6.0) and fed LA (2 g L−1)."
18,Conclusion,"In this study, a steam exploded SWG liquor was used as a feedstock for fermentative H2 production. The factors considered in the study included HRT, pH and LA concentration. An optimization method based on the BBD model was used to optimize conditions for maximizing the H2 yield. The data suggest that a steam exploded SWG hydrolysate is a potential substrate for biological H2 production. Based on the range of experimental factors under examination, the conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. All the factors under investigation influenced H2 yield; however, pH and LA concentration had greater effects in comparison to the HRT. 2. The accuracy of the model which was verified by a normal distribution of the residuals indicated that the model prediction correlated well within the experimental data. 3. The most appropriate fermentation conditions (derived from the D-optimality for maximum H2 yield) produced a yield of 99.86 ± 5.6 mL H2 g−1 TVS for cultures at pH 5.0, an HRT of 10 h and an LA concentration of 1.75 g L−1. 4. When maximum H2 production was observed, acetate and butyrate were the dominant metabolites. 5. The PCA revealed that the clustering of the samples was based mainly on LA treatment and pH. 6. Methanobacteria, Methanococci, and Methanomicrobia as well as Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Synergistaceae were observed in the cultures operated with no LA addition. 7. Methanogens were suppressed with the addition of LA (1 g L−1) at low HRTs and at a pH of 5.0. Maximum H2 yield in cultures fed 2 g L−1 LA, maintained at pH 5.0 and at a 12 h HRT was observed. Under these conditions, Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae were the dominant microorganisms observed."
