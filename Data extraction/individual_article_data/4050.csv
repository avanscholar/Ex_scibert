0,Introduction,"The growth of the world’s population and industries has caused the serious demand for energy supply and also the decline in energy reserve, especially in fossil fuel [1]. Owing to this, there is a need to find alternative renewable energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, hydro power, and biofuels. Among these, biodiesel from biofuels seems to be the best alternative to compensate diesel as it has almost the same performance as diesel fuel in engines and brings about fewer pollutants compared to fossil fuel. Biodiesel refers to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) or mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids obtained from vegetable oil and animal fats through transesterification process [2]. Natural oil or fat varies with the chemical composition and structure of fatty acids. As described in ASTM D6751, the properties of biodiesel depend greatly on the various FAMEs [3]. Biodiesel has numerous advantages over petrol-diesel, some of which are reduced exhaust emissions [4], better lubricity which is as a result of the capacity of long-chain FAMEs to conform to a firm lubricating layers on metal surfaces [5,6], high flash point, improved biodegradability and reduced toxicity [7] and also can be blended with other biofuels without the inclusion of fossil diesel for GHG benefit [8]. However, the challenge of low oxidation stability (OS) and poor cold flow properties has limited the applications of biodiesel. Low oxidation stability is caused by the presence of polyunsaturated FAME which can produce undesirable aldehydes, ketones, peroxides and acids that alter biodiesel properties. It is reported that oxidation of biodiesel can lead to undesirable saponification and then cause an increase in the total acid number (TAN) and kinematic viscosity [9,10]. As a result, it is difficult to store unsaturated FAMEs for a longer period [11]. As a crucial parameter of fuel quality, OS is specified in standards such as ASTM D6751 and the European biodiesel standard EN 14214 [3]. In converse, increased level of saturated FAME induces poor cold flow properties because they are more prone to gum which may cause blockages in the pipes and filters in the fuel system of vehicles during cold weather conditions [12]. A number of research works have suggested that the method of partial hydrogenation of biodiesel improves biodiesel OS and cold flow properties. At a minimum expense in cold flow properties, optimal OS can be achieved by selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated FAMEs [13]. Moreover, hydrogenation can bring about higher cetane number (CN) which is a crucial fuel property to indicate the ignition quality. After moderate hydrogenation of unsaturated FAMEs, the ignition performance of fuel can be raised to a more satisfied level [3]. Via partial hydrogenation, polyunsaturated FAMEs can be converted into monounsaturated and saturated counterparts. The hydrogenation ways of fatty acid compositions have been well illustrated in Fig. 1 [14]. The prominent limitation of hydrogenated biodiesel is the conversion from cis-isomers to trans-isomers during the process [15]. It can be said that trans-FAME greatly decreases the quality of hydrogenated biodiesel in cold flow property, hence there is an urgent need to reduce its generation. Trans-isomers have high crystallization point compared to cis-isomers, which is a predominant factor of cold flow properties [16]. Cis-trans isomers are geometric isomers which differ in stability from each other because of the relationship of attached substituents considered with respect to each other. Cis-isomers are polar molecules of the same atoms that are on the same side of double bonds. Cis-isomers have increased boiling point compared to trans-isomers because of the stronger intermolecular forces in it. Unlike cis-isomers, trans-isomers are non-polar molecules of the same atoms attached to the opposite sides of the double bonds. Trans-isomers have a higher melting point and are straightly shaped with well-packed molecules compared to the cis-isomers [17]. The fuel property of hydrogenated biodiesel can be improved by reducing the generation of trans-isomers and saturated FAME. It was proposed in a paper that, in order to reduce trans-isomers, a high hydrogen pressure of about 10 bar, a low reaction temperature of about 100 °C and a reduced amount of catalyst can fulfill the purpose [18]. It was also reported that, if the hydrogen concentration is well controlled, trans FAME generation can be restrained. Besides controlling the hydrogenation reaction, altering the microstructure of catalysts can as well reduce trans-FAME content in hydrogenation [19]. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation can also be used to restrain the generation of trans-FAME. This assists to convert polyunsaturated fatty acid to monounsaturated fatty acid [20]. Also, if catalysts are modified with magnesium glycinate as a promoter, trans-isomers will be reduced [21]. Thus magnesium modified catalysts increase selectivity towards cis-18:1 formation and reduces the formation of trans-C18:1 [15]. In this review paper, the developments associated with hydrogenated biodiesel in terms of production methods, feedstocks and catalysts used in the production and also ways of improving the OS without compromising its cold flow properties were reviewed thoroughly. Furthermore, it was also discussed in details on how to reduce trans-isomers which has a negative effect on the quality of the hydrogenated fuel. These findings will broaden our understanding of partially hydrogenated biodiesel and help us to improve the quality of biodiesel as well, as it is one of the promising renewable fuel to compensate for conventional petrol-diesel."
1,Feedstock for hydrogenated biodiesel,"Feedstocks for the production of biodiesel have great effects on the hydrogenation process as well as the final properties of a fuel. The fatty acid methyl composition in natural oil determines the level of saturation or unsaturation. Most of the feedstock used are traditional vegetables such as palm oil, rapeseed, canola, soybean oil, corn oil, jatropha oil etc. [22] and animal fats which mainly are pork fat, chicken fat, beef fat, etc. [1]. For example, Table 1 shows the compositions of a fatty acid of some typical feedstocks used in biodiesel production. It can be shown from Table 1 that, the main fatty acids in all feedstocks are palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2) [23]. Also, vegetable oil based-biodiesel like sunflower and soybean oil has better fluidity in cold temperature regions compared to animal fat-based biodiesel [24] and this may be as a result of the high amount of polyunsaturated FAMEs compositions in feedstocks. It can be deduced from Table 1 that, feedstocks such as soybean, sunflower and grapeseed will have poor OS but better cold flow properties due to the high amount of unsaturated compositions. Especially, the high linoleic content (C18:2) causes serious effect on its OS. In contrast, palm, almond, rapeseed and olive feedstocks will possess a better OS because of the less amount of polyunsaturated content. Fig. 2 shows the chemical functional group of soybean oil using Thermo Scientific iD7 ATR accessory for Thermo Scientific Nicolet Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The carboxylic compound acids were detected in the wavelengths between 2400 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1. The three vibrations bands located at 3009 cm−1, 2923 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1 respectively indicate CH stretching of CHCH, CH asymmetric stretching of CH2 and CH symmetric stretching of CH. Also, the vibration band at 1741 cm−1 indicates a CO double bond which corresponds to the ester group and affirms the transforming of soybean oil. The vibration band at 723 cm−1 corresponds to the cis isomers of CH that is present in the oleic and linoleic acids of soybean oil [14]. Again, palm oil based-biodiesel contains close to 45% saturated FAMEs and thus exhibit high OS, compared to cottonseed and soybean based-biodiesel which have about 29% and 14.9% of saturated FAME respectively. Marine fish biodiesel, which has a high amount of PUFAME and long chain fatty acid between the range of C20 and C22 presents high heating value, acid number, and kinematic viscosity but poor OS compared with biodiesel from waste cooking oil [27]. Jatropha oil has significant properties including low acidity, lower viscosity, and better cold flow properties compared to other feedstocks, which can be attributed to appropriate fatty acid compositions. Notwithstanding, Jatropha oil owing high unsaturated fatty acid content [28] may cause undesirable limitations of its biodiesel in terms of OS but these limitations could be mitigated with partial hydrogenation."
2,Hydrogenation method,"Partial hydrogenation of biodiesel can be produced from several methods. The first method is direct hydrogenation or hydrogen reduction where hydrogen gas is injected directly into the reactor under high pressure and temperature. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is another way to hydrotreat the biodiesel, in which the hydrogen is introduced from hydrogen donor. Formic acid, ammonium formate, phosphinic acid, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, sodium hypophosphite are commonly used as hydrogen donors [20]. Using hydrogen reduction method, it was reported that the partial hydrogenation of biodiesel derived from palm oil was carried out in a 300 mL stainless steel semi-batch reactor at temperature and hydrogen pressure of 120 °C and 0.4 MPa respectively. The stirring rate was maintained at 500 rpm to prevent external mass transfer limitation. The flow rate of hydrogen gas was kept at 50 mL/min and 1.5 g catalyst was initially put in the reactor. The system was purged with nitrogen gas to remove the remaining air. After that, 100 g of biodiesel was fed into the reactor by a peristaltic pump and the reaction started by increasing the temperature and pressure to the desired points. Finally, the liquid products were collected after two hours of reaction [13]. Partial hydrogenation process of corn oil biodiesel was also reported in a recent paper [29]. Partial hydrogenation was carried out in a pressured stainless-steel batch reactor and the stirring rate was kept constant at 500 rpm to ensure uniform mixing of different phases. The reactor was then charged with 35 mL biodiesel and 0.1167 g catalyst before the system was purged with nitrogen to remove the remaining air. The reactor was then heated to 80 °C and was fed with hydrogen. The system pressure was adjusted to 4.0 bar and the reaction proceeded for 4 h. Hydrogenation reduction reaction of polyunsaturated FAME is accelerated under the high temperature. In addition, catalyst activity also augments with high pressure. Aside from these advantages of the method, there are some limitations that should be discussed as well. This direct hydrogenation increases the formation of trans-isomers as a result of high temperature, which is not good for the fuel. In addition, this method also requires strict operating conditions such as high pressure and temperature [20]. Many works have also been done in relation to CTH method. CTH process was described in a paper. It was reported that the calculated amount of soybean oil and hydrogen donor solution was charged in a glass reactor. The reactor was then placed in a water bath with a mechanical stirrer. Catalysts were added to the solution after the water bath was heated to a predefined temperature. The process proceeded for two hours before the hydrogenated oil was obtained [20]. A similar experiment of soybean oil was carried out where formic acid salts worked as hydrogen donors in aqueous media [30]. Another experimental work on CTH of soybean methyl ester was also reported recently [31]. A calculated amount of water, oil, and isopropanol which served as hydrogen donor were mixed in a three-neck round bottom flask. The mixture was then put in the oil bath reactor of temperature 85 °C, and 26 g Raney nickel catalyst was added to the reactor. The stirring rate and bath temperature were kept at 600 rpm and 85 °C respectively. The reaction proceeded for two hours and then the partially hydrogenated biodiesel was obtained. The advantage of this method is that the reaction atmosphere under solution is very mild and controllable compared to hydrogen reduction method which operates under high pressure and temperature. Also in terms of trans-isomers formation, CTH produces fewer trans-isomers as compared to hydrogen reduction (direct hydrogenation) method since more trans-isomers are produced under higher temperature [20]."
3,Catalysts for hydrogenation,"Catalysts are believed to speed the chemical reaction rate when added to a reaction system depending on their type. Catalysts interact with the reactants in a chemical reaction but do not undergo any permanent change or get consumed in the process of the reaction. Moreover, they can aid in getting the desired products of the reaction [32]. Polyunsaturated FAMEs can be hydrogenated into monounsaturated or saturated methyl esters via CC hydrogenation or into fatty alcohols by the CO hydrogenation. Complete hydrogenation of FAMEs results in the elimination of oxygen and the emergence of new hydrocarbons. Hydrogenation reaction can be performed with or without catalysts depending on the desired properties of the products. It is laborious to control the selectivity of non-catalytic hydrogenation reactions unlike that of catalytic hydrogenation where there can be a chance to control the selectivity of the reaction towards the expected products [33]. Catalysts also bind the H2 molecule and facilitate the reaction [34]. Partial hydrogenation of CC double bond using group VIII metals like Ni, Co, Pd, Pt and Rh as catalysts have been studied and reported by many researchers. In general, these catalysts can be grouped into two types, which are homogenous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts depending on its phase in the reactants. Homogenous catalysts are usually in the liquid phase and have the same phase with the reactants and the products. Homogenous catalysts exhibit better activity and cis-selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. It was reported on hydrogenated fatty acids of sunflower oil using aqueous Na2CO3 and Na2PdCl2 as homogeneous catalysts and obtained selectivity of up to 93% [35]. In addition, under certain conditions, homogeneous catalyst Ru (II) improves the reaction activity and the selectivity of cis-isomer product compared to heterogeneous catalyst Ni [36]. It was also mentioned in a paper that using homogeneous highly selective catalytic transition metal is among the ways to reduce the level of trans-isomers and saturated fats [37]. Unlike homogenous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts have a different phase with the reactants and the products and are commonly in the solid form or phase [38]. Hydrogenation reaction using heterogeneous catalyst follows Horiut-Polanyi mechanism, in which hydrogen molecule and unsaturated fatty acids are absorbed onto the catalyst surface. Hydrogen molecule then dissociates into atomic hydrogen and then one atom of hydrogen attaches itself to the fatty acid in a reversible step. This is followed by the addition of a second hydrogen atom onto the fatty acid and thus, makes the hydrogenation reaction irreversible [39,34]. In terms of separation of the products from the catalyst, heterogeneous catalysts are more preferred to homogenous catalyst because of the relative ease of separating the catalyst from products [40]. For example, it was reported that rhodium sulfonated triphenylphosphite (Rh/STPP) which is a heterogeneous catalyst had an advantage over homogenous catalyst rhodium tri-sulfonated triphenylphosphine (Rh/TPPTS) during separation [11]. Also, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred, because reactions take place under high-temperature reactions and they are more tolerant of extreme conditions [41]. These heterogeneous catalysts are chosen from materials that have high melting points like Sc, V, Mn, Fe, Ti, Co, Ni, Cr, Cu, and Zn. A heterogeneous catalyst such as carbon-based catalysts can be prepared from renewable sources and bio-materials and are mostly used because of the ease in obtaining the carbon, its large surface area, eco-friendly and its thermal stability [42,43]. A study was conducted on the heterogeneous catalysts using noble metals such as Pd, Ru, Rh and Pt regarding hydrogenation of natural oils with similar fatty acid profiles as biodiesel. The report showed that the hydrogenation activity of natural oils over different noble metals can be ranked in an order Pd > Rh > Pt > Ru > Ni [44,45]. Turnover frequency (TOF), which is used to measure the amount of reactant reacted per surface area of an active site, was used to evaluate the hydrogenation activity of Pd, Pt, and Ni for each C18 FAME at hydrogenation time of 30 min. The results showed that Pd was the most active compared to Pt and Ni for the partial hydrogenation of rapeseed oil. It was also observed that Pt and Ni showed lower selectivity towards trans-isomers than Pd. This is because there was subsequent hydrogenation of the immediate trans-monounsaturated FAME to saturated FAME for Pt and Ni [46]. Also, a new heterogeneous catalyst Pd/1mS3-12@Al2O3 was developed and manifested higher hydrogenation activity than conventional catalyst Pd/C. Under the effect of Pd/1mS3-12@Al2O3, the partially hydrogenated biodiesel possessed higher oxidation stability and even did not undermine its cold properties. Table 2 shows the hydrogenation of FAME using different Pd based catalysts. It can be seen that Pd/ImS3-12@Al2O3 can lead to complete hydrogenation of unsaturated FAME towards C18:0 whilst Pd/C catalyst can generate less C18:0 product [16]. Ni catalysts supported on silica are normally used in partial hydrogenation process of vegetable oil, because of the reduced cost compared to noble metal catalysts. However, the hydrogenation process catalyzed by Ni demands relative strict working conditions [47]. However, during the hydrogenation process, Ni-based catalysts facilitate isomerization of naturally occurring cis-configuration to trans-configuration. This limits their use compared to noble metals like Pt and Pd because noble metals like Pt and Pd have high activities and mild hydrogenation process [48,49]."
4,Oxidative stability (OS) and cold flow property,"OS is a crucial challenge in the application of biodiesel when it comes to the storing of fuel for a longer period of time [50]. The induction period is an indicator for biodiesel OS. In order to determine the induction period, biodiesel sample is placed in a reaction tube at a constant temperature of 110 °C. A flow of air is passed through the sample, fed to a vessel containing distilled water as the absorption solution and its conductivity is recorded. FAME is oxidized to peroxides as primary oxidation products. After a while, there is a complete decomposition of the sample. The air flow transports the volatile carboxylic acids to the vessel and this is indicated by the rise in conductivity of the solution. The time difference between the start of the test and the rise in the conductivity of the solution in the vessel caused by the volatile carboxylic acids is known as the induction period [51,29]. The minimum induction period (IP) suggested by the European standard (EN 14214:2012) is 8 h and also 3 h by ASTM D6751 [52]. It indicates that the OS should not be below the stated IP value. A study was conducted on the OS of soybean biodiesel. Its IP was 2 h, which clearly shows the high amount of polyunsaturated FAMEs in the soybean feedstock [15]. The poor biodiesel stability can be associated with the presence of double bonds because they tend to form residues through auto-oxidation process during storage as reported in a paper [53]. OS also depends on the fatty methyl ester compositions as well as the presence of natural antioxidants [54]. In other words, the stability of biodiesel deteriorates with higher amounts of linoleic and linolenic acid components [55]. Antioxidants being natural or synthetic is in the form of organic compounds which slow oxidation when added to oxidizable organic materials and thus, prolong the life of the material. In the case of biodiesel, they regulate the degradation of the esters initiated by oxygen [56,57]. The oxidative stability, cloud point (CP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) properties of partially hydrogenated soybean biodiesel which were obtained by using different metal catalysts supported on SiO2 were studied [15]. As shown in Table 3 , the oxidative stability regarding induction period (IP) of soybean FAMEs without hydrogenation was 2 h, and the IP value was increased after partial hydrogenation. It can also be deduced from Table 3 that, the CFPP and CP of partially hydrogenated biodiesel ascended, which is a major drawback and can be improved by adding proper additives known as pour depressants [58]. Oxidative stability variations of soybean biodiesel before and after hydrogenation under a new hydrogenation catalyst Pd/ImS3-12@Al2O3 was studied. The IP of soybean biodiesel before and after hydrogenation (27 °C, 75 atm, 1 mL BMIM.NTf2) were less than 1 h and 28 h respectively as shown in Fig. 3 [16]. It can be explained that a large amount of polyunsaturated FAMEs in biodiesel are transferred into monounsaturated FAMEs under hydrogenation [16]. The total amount of unsaturation of FAMEs can be assessed by iodine value (IV), which means the maximum quantity in g of iodine added to 100 g grease. Normally, IV of FAME should be determined with the titration method by standard Hans solution [59]. On the other hand, for a blend of which the concrete compositions can be well specified, its iodine value can be calculated from the formula given below [23]. IV = ∑ 254 · D · X i M wi where X i is the percentage of each component of FAME i, D is the number of dothe uble bond, M wi is the molecular weight of FAME i. The degree of unsaturation (DU) is another indicator to characterize the unsaturation of FAMEs. It is defined as following [60,23]. DU = % w t . o f m o n o u n s a t u r a t e d F A M E + 2 ( % w t . o f p o l y u n s a t u r a t e d F A M E ) Where monounsaturated FAME represent methyl oleate in the FAME and polyunsaturated FAME represents methyl linoleate (C18:2) and methyl linolenate (C18:3). The IV of biodiesel should be less than 120 I2/100 g given by EN 14214 standard. Unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid (C18:2) and linoleic acid (C18:3) increase the IV of the fuel. Thus, IV increases with the degree of unsaturation [61]. The DU of some selected feedstocks using the above formula is shown in Table 4 [23]. The original composition of fatty acids in feedstock has a great impact on the CN of biodiesel. Normally, the more saturated the molecule and the longer the FAME carbon chains, the higher the cetane number would be for the fuel. In other words, high level of unsaturated components like linoleic (C18:2) and linoleic (C18:3) acids lead to low cetane number, whereas saturated fatty acids like palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) attribute to high cetane number [60]. In addition, as saturation of FAME increases, CN and OS increase [62]. It can be said that increased CN improves cold start performance because fuel with high CN is easy to ignite [63]. In addition, higher CN tends to decrease white smoke [25] aside the high oxygen content in biofuels which improves combustion to reduce PM emissions [64]. There are some methods to determine the CN of the fuel. The ignition delay of a given fuel can be estimated in a combustion bomb, and then it is translated to CN by using the correlation between ignition delay and CN. For a blend of multiple compounds, its CN can also be determined by using a linear combination if the mass fraction and the CN of each individual composition are already known. The equation below was used to calculate the cetane number in a paper [23]. CN = ∑ i = 1 N x i · CN i where, X i is the mass fraction of methyl ester i and C N i is the cetane number of methyl ester i. The CNs of the individual FAME are listed in Table 5 [62]. The relationship between cetane number, iodine value and the degree of unsaturated FAMEs of some typical feedstocks from Table 1 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . In Figs. 4 and 5, Iodine value and cetane number are almost linear with unsaturation degree. The increase in unsaturation causes the rise in iodine value whilst the cetane number is lowered. The iodine value specification for EN 14214 should be less than 120 g I2/100 g [65]. In Fig. 5, biodiesel from some typical feedstocks met the requirement except soybean, sunflower, and grape. Partial hydrogenation of biodiesel from these feedstocks can decrease the IV to less than 120 g I2/100 g which will meet the EN 14214 IV requirement. Iodine value greater than 113 (>113) could ensure better cold flow properties of biodiesel as confirmed in a paper whose pour point was −13 °C for hydrogenated biodiesel made from hempseed with an iodine value of 118 I2/100 g [66]. Yang et al. [65] conducted the study of the fuel properties of hempseed biodiesel before and after hydrogenation and concluded that the CN and pour point of hydrogenated hempseed biodiesel increase whilst iodine value decreases compared to hempseed biodiesel. It is worth mentioning that the iodine value, CN and PP of hempseed biodiesel after hydrogenation meets the specifications of ASTM D 6751, EN 14214 and GB/T2 0828-2007 (Chinese standard). Table 6 compares the fuel properties of biodiesel, and hydrogenated biodiesel with European, American and Chinese standards fuel properties. A paper also investigated the fuel properties of partially hydrogenated soybean biodiesel which includes OS, low-temperature performance, lubricity, kinematic viscosity, and specific gravity. It was revealed that partially hydrogenated biodiesel from soybean oil had a better OS and almost the same specific gravity but poor low-temperature properties, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity compared to conventional soybean methyl esters [67]. The inferior cold flow properties of biodiesel denoted by high cloud point (CP) and pour point (PP) is another challenge that limits its application as a fuel. Studies have shown that the length of carbon chains and the unsaturation in carbon chain have great effects on the cold flow properties of biodiesel [68,69]. The higher level of unsaturated FAMEs and shorter length of esters exhibit better cold flow properties [3]. CP is the temperature where saturates form a cloudy suspension like wax crystals when the fuel is allowed to cool, whereas PP is the minimum temperature at which the gel-like suspension still flow [70,54]. A study was conducted on the melting point and molecular weight using cottonseed methyl esters. As shown in Table 5 , saturated FAMEs own especially higher melting points than unsaturated esters [54]. In other words, during processing, saturated esters tend to crystallize at a higher temperature compared to the unsaturated ones. That is, FAMEs from oil or fats with higher saturation will present high CP and PP value [62]. It can be said that the high content of C18:0 causes a deterioration in the cold flow properties of biodiesel because of its high melting point. Thus, conforming to what was reported in a paper that, the presence of a higher amount of saturated C18:0 brings about poor cold flow properties but saturated C16:0 does not [15]. The use of additives can also improve cold flow properties but in turn, affects other fuel properties such as viscosity and density [71]."
5,Conclusion,"In this review paper, it is established that although partial hydrogenation increases the kinematic viscosity of biodiesel, it is a good method to enhance the saturation degree, cetane number (CN), oxidation stability (OS), cloud point (CP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) properties. This improvement in fuel properties can be attributed to the changes in the chemical composition of methyl esters during partial hydrogenation process. It refers to that polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2, C18:3) are transformed to monounsaturated FAME (C18:1) and methylstearate(C18:0). Simultaneously, partial hydrogenation can control the level of C18:0 which has high melting points and in turns exhibit a high level of CP and PP of the fuel. Though raw feedstock may have different FAME compositions which may have an effect on the hydrogenation process and fuel properties, hydrogenation gives more opportunities to such raw materials in terms of biodiesel production and provides more optimization of the fuel. It can also be said that heterogeneous catalyst serves better in the hydrogenation process in terms of catalyst separation and recovery whilst homogenous catalyst enhances selectivity and reduces the level of trans-C18:1 in partially hydrogenated biodiesel. Also, Pt, Pd and Ni catalysts assisted on SiO2 or Mg-SiO2 enhance hydrogenation selectivity by increasing the conversion of polyunsaturated FAMEs and restraining the generation of trans-C18:1. In terms of trans-isomers and cis-isomers, it is important to reduce the formation of trans-FAME in hydrogenation process since it has a negative effect on the final product. As it has already been stated, CTH medium of hydrogenation decreases the trans-isomers generation which helps to improve the cold flow properties for the reason that, trans-isomers have a higher melting point compared to cis-isomers. Some catalysts for hydrogenation may also generate more trans-isomers compared to others and this affects the fuel quality. Moreover, because trans-isomers increases with temperature and catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas deal with high temperature, there is a need to find an alternative way of introducing hydrogen in the hydrogenation reaction without increasing the reaction temperature. In addition, using hydrogen donors in catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is a promising approach to reduce the level of trans-FAME in hydrogenation. Also, research works should be conducted to investigate the effect of using mixed catalysts, that is, two or more catalysts (homogeneous and heterogeneous) combined together on trans-FAME and partial hydrogenation as a whole."
