0,Introduction,"The increase of energy demand in the world, associated to fossil sources which are exhausted by the near future, and alarming environmental problems have become serious due to unrestrained utilization of these limited sources [1]. However, the numbers of challenges attributed to fossil fuels and the conversion of biomass for energy production require the search for new, reliable and best energy options [2]. Therefore, it is a strategic goal for researchers to explore alternative energy resources that can be effective for fossil fuels substitution. In this context, biomass as promising candidate, due to its renewability, has many positive environmental impacts such as the saving of depletable fossil energy, less environmental pollution, and the reduction of harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass derived fuels seems to be the promising path; and various routes are available for the biomass thermochemical processing such as pyrolysis, steam reforming, transesterification; and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). For an efficient conversion process, the important properties of a biomass feedstock that determine its suitability and degradation are: the energy content, moisture content, chemical composition and quantity of organic matter. Naturally the humidity of fresh biomass is quite high ranged 50–80% for green crops and around 50% for green wood, such as rapeseed, maize, and sugar cane. Obviously, the moisture content is very high (more than 80%) for liquid wastes like olive mill wastewater (OMWW) [3] and aquatic based biomass (microalgae). Recently, various review papers summarized the research on HTL of different biomass including wood, agricultural waste, energy crops, algae, animal waste, organic fraction of municipal waste and others [4,5]. The rising number of publication in the area of bio-oil (BO) production from biomass HTL in the last couple years is an indication of the process raising interest. The studies about HTL process were extensively investigated in the literature under different operating conditions such as the influence of reaction temperature, pressure, residence time, solvent participation and feedstock composition. Recently, Caprariis et al. [6] reported that the liquefaction of biomass with higher lignin in subcritical water lead to the higher BO yield, when temperature increases from 260 to 320 °C during 30 min. The same result was reported by Biswas et al. [7], regarding Sargassum tenerrimum microalgae liquefaction; they observed that the production of BO enhances progressively with the rise of temperature reaction up to 280 °C. The work of Singh et al. [8] investigated how the feedstock composition affects the BO yield for a short period of time of 15 min and for different algae species at 280 °C with a ratio of algae/water 1:6. As a result, the highest BO yield of 29 wt% was achieved with protein content of 65% in Spirulina sp. compared to the others algae species tested. In fact, the use of water as solvent in different studies has shown that some shortcomings in properties of the resulting BOs, which are undesirable, need to be upgraded. In consideration of this fact, the liquefaction of biomass under sub-/supercritical organic solvents conditions is reviewed in order to illustrate the recent research progress on the effect of solvent type on the biomass liquefaction [9] (e.g., methanol [10–12], ethanol [10,11,13,14], acetone [15], propanol and butanol [11], etc.). The alcohols have been tested in different studies to enhance the yield and the physical-chemical properties of BO. Furthermore, the biomass liquefaction by using alcohols in supercritical conditions has received considerable attention, due to their particular physicochemical properties (e.g., gas-like diffusivity, liquid-like density, rapid rates of heat transfer and mass as well as low viscosity). In addition, the reactivity of alcohols such as: Hydrogen generation [16], deoxygenation [17], and esterification [18] can result in an effective reduction of the oxygen content, suppression of repolymerization as well as the increase of BO calorific value. However, the use of organic solvents as the reactant could raise several problems. Mainly, the higher cost versus water, the need of biomass drying before experiment, and leading to environmental concerns. Alcohol-water co-solvent was adopted in many studies [19–21] owing to the synergistic effect between the organic solvent and water on biomass liquefaction. For instance, ethanol–water co-solvent (EWCS) or methanol–water co-solvent (MWCS), were found to be more effective for enhancing the decomposition of wood cell wall components, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin than pure solvent [22,23]. Moreover, alcohols are expected to promote the solubilization of relatively high-molecular weight polar products, which are derived from lignocellulosic compounds due to their lower dielectric constants compared to that of water. Nevertheless, the biomass liquefaction process is very complex due to the large number of involved reaction types and mechanisms. It occurs via depolymerization of biomass materials into fragments, first by hydrolysis, and then its degradation to smaller compounds by dehydration, deoxygenation, and hydro-deoxygenation [24]. Patil et al. [25] investigated the liquefaction of wheat straw and they showed the effectiveness of ethanol-water solutions on the lignocellulosic biomass decomposition at subcritical conditions. Further results have been reported on the Nannochloropsis oceanica liquefaction in different solvent [26]. Experimental results showed that higher conversion of biomass and lower BO oxygen content are obtained when increasing ethanol content from 10 to 50 vol%. Methanol and ethanol effects have been studied by Cheng et al. [21], and it has been reported that ethanol was the most suitable solvent to convert high protein or carbohydrate content into BO. In addition, the use of alcohol-water mixture in subcritical conditions has been demonstrated to produce a BO with higher calorific value of 37.3 MJ/kg [10,13]. Also, Ji et al. [22] found that the conversion rate (up to 94.73%) was enhanced by using ethanol-water mixture compared to that in pure water or ethanol, resulting in a positive effect on BO yield during the liquefaction of microalgae. Hafez et al [27] liquefied giant miscanthus using EWCS and they obtained a high BO yield during 5 min containing more than 21.5% of ester compounds. From an economic point of view and environmental reasons, ethanol and methanol can be derived from green sources [28,29]. They could be produced by thermal processes which are target for producing ethanol [27]. On the other hand, methanol is produced by fermentation and digestion of biomasses [30]. From antiquity to the present, olives and olive oil production are one of the most successful industries around the Mediterranean basin. In the last decade, the large annual production in Mediterranean countries has been estimated to be about 2.5 million tones/year of olive oil, which corresponds to 90% of world production [31]. Olive oil production releases a high amounts of OMWW ranges between 0.5 and 3.25 m3/1 tons of olive depending on process extraction type [32]. Despite the fact that the olive oil industry contributes significantly to the economy of these countries, the management of OMWW is still an unsolved problem because of its polluting properties. The OMWW is characterized with high water content of 83–92% [33], and with a strong olive oil odor and an intensive violet-dark brown to black color. In addition, it contains an extremely high organic content (25–45 g/L), high concentration of polyphenols (0.5–2.4 g/L), acidic waste (pH ∼ 3–6). The OMWW is characterized by its high chemical oxygen demand of 220000 mg/L, high electrical conductivity (6–10 dS/m), dropping sugars up to 60% of the dry matter, high suspended of solid matter, and potassium as the predominant inorganic material (∼4 g/L) [34]. The seasonality and numerous characteristics of OMWW make it a challenging waste to apply a cost-effective and friendly treatment process method. Few studies have addressed the subject of BO production from OMWW. Among them OMWW liquefaction was investigated under subcritical conditions of water resulting in a maximum BO yield of 58 wt% at optimal conditions [3]. Haddad et al. [35] investigated the pyrolysis of impregnated sawdust with OMWW and they obtained about 25% of BO yield. In addition, OMWW sludge was used as feedstock by Elleuch et al. [36] to produce upgraded BO by pyrolysis followed by an esterification process. Based on the above mentioned work dealing with water-alcohol mixtures and the fact that OMWW presents high amounts of water, hydroliquefaction of OMWW using alcohols seems to be a valuable alternative. Despite the great potential of alcohol-water mixture in biomass liquefaction, the principal roles of alcohol to water system under various liquefaction conditions are still unclear. For instance, as question of how the temperature can influence viscosity or what is the ratio of alcohol-water co-solvent that participates in the liquefaction of OMWW has not been addressed in previous studies. As a continuation of our previous work [3], the present study focuses on the HTL of OMWW in mixture alcohol-water co-solvent, in order to achieve a higher yield and better BO quality. The influence of operating conditions (temperature, alcohol and biomass proportion) on OMWW conversion is examined. Physical and chemical properties of the upgraded BO, such as elemental analysis, viscosity, and density are reported. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses (GC–MS) are performed. These results could provide further comprehension of BO production and its upgrading via liquefaction process in alcohols-water system."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials and chemicals,"2.1 Materials and chemicals The OMWW feedstock used in this study was collected from a traditional oil mill in the north of Algeria. Ash content, water content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, fat and the C, H, N contents were determined using the protocols reported in the previous work [3]. The analysis results of OMWW sample are presented in Table 1 . On the other hand, the reagent grade chemicals, namely, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), methanol and ethanol, were purchased from Fisher Scientific (UK) and used as received. The purity of all chemicals was higher than 99%."
3,Experimental procedure,"2.2 Experimental procedure The experiments were carried out in a 998 ml cylindrical autoclave. The reactor was sealed, and ambient air was removed by purging with N2 for 10 min. For each experiment, Alcohol-water (EWCS or MWCS) with different ethanol or methanol content were mixed with OMWW (as received), containing 32 wt% dry biomass, to make 100 g of feedstock. In a typical run, the reactor was filled with OMWW at various ratios of co-solvent (EWCS or MWCS) and when the temperature reached the desired value, it was maintained for 30 min. Once the reactor was cooled to room temperature, gaseous product inside was vented to a sampling bag, then reserved for analysis. Liquid and solid products were carefully transferred into a beaker and prior to filtration under vacuum, the reactor was further rinsed with CH2Cl2. Liquid portion was put in the rotary evaporator to get rid of residual reaction solvent (methanol or ethanol) and CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 insoluble fraction was dried in the oven and defined as solid residue (SR). In addition, alcohols that were used as co-solvent along with water, they could be recycled by evaporation after OMWW liquefaction. The resulted liquid phase was designated as BO. Separation and extraction procedure are illustrated in Fig. 1 . All liquefaction experiments were repeated three times under identical conditions to ensure the repeatability of the results. The uncertainty estimation was evaluated by the maximum standard deviation calculation. The uncertainties were less than 5% for both products yields and conversion rate estimations. Moreover, the results are given as the average values and their uncertainties (i.e., error bars) are the sample standard deviations as reported in the literature [37]."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The solvent-water ratio (w/w) was defined as the percent of the solvent weight to that of water. The biomass-solvent ratio (g/ml) was defined as percentage of the OMWW mass to the volume of solvent. The liquefaction yield of each product and conversion rate were all expressed in wt% and calculated as follows: (1) B O y i e l d ( w t % ) = M a s s o f B O ( g ) / M a s s d r y o f O M W W ( g ) × 100 % (2) S R y i e l d ( w t % ) = M a s s o f S R ( g ) / M a s s d r y o f O M W W ( g ) × 100 % (3) C o n v e r s i o n r a t e ( w t % ) = 100 - M a s s o f S R ( g ) / M a s s d r y o f O M W W ( g ) × 100 % The total yield of gas and water was obtained by difference and assuming a negligible mass loss for solvent during the liquefaction process. (4) Y i e l d o f G a s + w a t e r ( w t % ) = 100 - y i e l d o f B O - y i e l d o f S R Energy recovery (ER) compares the total energy content of BO produced with the total energy content of the raw feedstock. It is calculated from the following expression [38]: (5) E R 1 % = H H V B O × M B O H H V F e e d s t o c k × M F e e d s t o c k where, H H V B O is the higher heating value ( M J . k g - 1 ) of BO, M B O is the mass of BO (kg), H H V F e e d s t o c k is the OMWW higher heating value ( M J . k g - 1 ) and M F e e d s t o c k is the mass of OMWW used (kg). In the case of using alcohol-water as co-solvent the ER is calculated as follows [39]: (6) E R 2 % = 0.3 H H V B O × Y B O 0.3 H H V f + 0.7 R R + 1 × H H V o s × 100 % where H H V B O is the higher heating value of BO ( M J . k g - 1 ), Y B O is the yield of BO, R is the solvent/water mass ratio and H H V o s is the higher heating value of the organic solvent. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the process could be seen as the ratio of the energy input (electrical energy supplied to the HTL reactor) to the energy output (energy contents of HTL products). However, for laboratory scale batch reactor, a large part of the energy invested is related to the heating phase, to reach the reaction temperature, which is energy consuming. From the outcome of the present work, this ratio represents around 25% at optimal conditions."
5,Product analysis,"2.4 Product analysis The composition of gaseous products was determined using a gas Chromatography Agilent technology 3000A of two channels micro-GC, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A PLOT Q column (10 m × 0.32 mm × 10 µm) which separates CO2 and light hydrocarbons C2Hn and C4Hn, and molecular sieve 5Ȧ (10 m × 0.32 mm × 12 µm) separates N2, O2, CO and CH4. The elemental analysis of BO and SR were analyzed by Flash EA 1112 series elemental analyser (Thermo-finnigne instrument). The higher heating value (HHV) of BO and SR were determined using a bomb calorimeter (Parr calorimeter, 6200). BO viscosity was evaluated at 40 °C with A&D company sine-wave vibro-viscometer (SV-10) while its density was measured using a pycnometer (ASTM D 4052). The flash point was determined by a Normalab Pensky-Martens (NPM-440) flash point tester and the cold filter plugging point was measured using a Normalab analyzer (NTL-450). The moisture of BO was measured by Karl Fisher method (870 kfTitrino plus). FTIR spectroscopic analysis of feedstock and BO were performed by PekinElmer470 over a range of 400–4000 cm−1. GC–MS analysis of BO was carried out using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 680, coupled with a Perkin Elmer mass spectrometer and a flame ionisation detector (FID). Gas chromatography was performed on a Supelco SLB-5 ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). 1 µL of CH2Cl2/BO solution (10%) was injected in split mode (1:10) using helium as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The injection temperature was 275 °C; the oven temperature was 30 °C for 10 min, rise to 100 °C at the rate of 2 °C/min then to 300 °C at 5 °C/min and was held at this temperature for 5 min (total run time 90 min). The mass spectrometer was set at an ionizing voltage of 70 eV and a mass range of m/z 30–450. The identification of organic compounds was accomplished by comparing the mass spectra of the resolved components using the NIST library."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Effect of the reaction temperature on the liquefaction yields,"3.1 Effect of the reaction temperature on the liquefaction yields The liquefaction process of OMWW in EWCS and MWCS was examined at reaction time of 30 min with 50% (w/w) solvent of either ethanol or methanol content by varying the temperature from 240 °C (sub-critical) to 320 °C (supercritical). The effect of temperature on BO, SR, and others yields, as well as the conversion rate are presented in Fig. 2 . Regarding the liquefaction in EWCS (Fig. 2a), the BO yield shows a significant increase from 240 °C to 280 °C ranging from 66.13 to 92.31 wt%, while the SR yield decreased greatly from 15.42 wt% to 5.27 wt% (at 280 °C). After that, the BO yield slightly decreases to 75.84 wt%, accompanied by significant increase of others yield, suggesting conversion of BO to SR, gas and water soluble products at temperature higher than 280 °C. In Fig. 2b, the SR yield of OMWW liquefaction in MWCS decreases with increasing temperature and ranges from 14.04 wt% to 9.06 wt%, while the BO yield was lower at 240 °C, and then increased with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum of 77.95 wt% at 280 °C. Afterwards, the BO yield reduced to 69.28 wt% at 320 °C. The gas + water yield showed an increase from 12.98 wt% to 23.04 wt% at 280 °C. The minimum SR yield of 5.27 wt% was obtained at 280 °C for EWCS and 5.67 wt% at 340 °C for MWCS. The BO yield follows a trend that has already been observed in OMWW's direct HTL in subcritical water [3]. It may involve same reaction mechanisms; OMWW was decomposed and depolymerized into fragments of lighter molecules highly reactive. In addition, these unstable fragments rearranged through polymerization, condensation and cyclization reactions, which generate the new organic compounds. At high temperatures, the reduction of BO and the increase of SR and gas + water yields are coupled. These temperatures enhance condensation or cracking reactions (both reaction types are thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures) which lead to the formation of gases and SR via re-polymerization of free radical reactions (Fig. 2a). Moreover, in the aqueous phase, more intermediate water soluble products were obtained at subcritical temperature range. Under high temperature conditions, these intermediates underwent defragmentation and cracking reactions to form gas and BO. This behavior was reported in the literature by the HTL of Chlorella pyrenoidosa [1]. In the case of MWCS as depicted in Fig. 2b, a further increase of the reaction temperature leads to enhance secondary decomposition and gas reactions become active. In addition, the decarboxylation, cracking/fragmentation, gasification/stream reforming and dehydration reactions of the intermediates/liquid/SR products were enhanced at high reaction temperatures to form gases and water [40]. This behavior is supported by the experimental results of HTL products yields in Fig. 2b. Similar observations were reported in liquefaction of biomass in sub/supercritical using ethanol [40] and methanol [41]. BO yield was maximized while both SR and gases yields were minimized at 280 °C. Hence, this temperature condition appeared to be the optimum for the BO production in both hot compressed co-solvents of ethanol-water or methanol-water (50/50%, w/w) for liquefaction of OMWW. Compared to the BO yield produced from OMWW by using water in the previous work [3], the BO yield is enhanced by using alcohols-water in sub-/supercritical conditions. The reason is that the critical temperatures and pressures of alcohols are lower than those of water. Additionally, the alcohols used as co-solvent for biomass HTL have lower dielectric constant compared to water, and therefore can dissolve relatively high molecular weight products derived from hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin."
8,Effect of the solvent/water ratio on the liquefaction yields,"3.2 Effect of the solvent/water ratio on the liquefaction yields OMWW was liquefied in sub/supercritical solvent/water ratio at different solvent content, varying from 20% to 80% (w/w), at 280 °C for 30 min to determine the optimal alcohol/water ratio. The products yields are plotted against the ethanol/water ratio (Fig. 3 a) and methanol/water ratio (Fig. 3b). In the solvent mixture condition, the increase of EWCS induces the increase of BO yield until a critical concentration and then decreases. The achieved BO yield was maximized for a 50% (w/w) ethanol and methanol solution, whereas at higher alcohol ratios, BO yield decreases. In fact, the BO yield decreased with increasing alcohols contents (decreasing water content), for the reason that free-radicals can be provide it by sub-supercritical water through ionization of biomass. Free radicals, derived from the ionization of water, are reduced by the increase in ethanol content because of its slightly weak acidity compared to that of water. Similar observations have been reported previously in the liquefaction of white pine sawdust [21] and corncob [42], where a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of EWCS gave a higher BO yield. Therefore, ethanol appeared to be slightly more effective than methanol for the conversion of OMWW. In fact, the surface tension of the products can be reduced by supercritical ethanol and therefore enhancing the diffusion of solvent to the lignin matrix. Moreover, the intermediates derived from the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin could be dissolved by the supercritical ethanol. In addition, the higher ethanol reactivity might be owing by its slightly lower dielectric constant (24.3) than that of methanol (33) and with its weaker h-bonds than those of water. Previous studies [1,3,21] have demonstrated the effectiveness of supercritical solvents or hot-compressed water in depolymerization of biomass into BO. As a result, during the liquefaction process of lignocellulosic biomass and in particular at ethanol supercritical state, ethanol may be expected to more readily dissolve and stabilize the relatively high-molecular weight liquid/intermediates. Suggesting that these results showed a synergistic effect of solvent and water on biomass liquefaction. This phenomenon between alcohol and water has been reported in woody biomass at 300 °C, where 50% (w/w) methanol–water content or 50%(w/w) ethanol-water content was found to be very effective for lignocellulosic biomass [21]. The use of ethanol (or methanol) water mixture as liquefaction medium, with appropriate volume ratio, could enhance the BO yield and increase the biomass conversion as much as possible. All above mentioned results indicate that alcohols addition into water system showed a synergetic effect during OMWW liquefaction. The best alcohol content was 50% (w\w), where the BO yields were 92.31 wt% and 77.95 wt% for EWCS and MWCS respectively. From the outcome of our investigation, it is possible to conclude that alcohols offer several advantages over water: they could react with free fatty acid (FFA) components to produce diesel-like products, dissolve high-molecular-weight compounds to liquid products with preventing coke formation. In addition, they can stabilize free radicals to reduce the repolymerization reaction owing to their hydrogen donor capability, and provide milder reaction conditions because of their critical temperature and pressure that are much lower."
9,Effect of the biomass/solvent ratio on the liquefaction yields,"3.3 Effect of the biomass/solvent ratio on the liquefaction yields The effect of OMWW/solvent ratio (g/ml) was investigated by conducting the liquefaction tests for 30 min in ethanol and methanol at 280 °C. The results of liquefaction product yields are depicted in Fig. 4 . The OMWW/solvent ratio has been reported as an important factor to influence biomass liquefaction in alcohols [43]. Indeed, decreasing OMWW/solvent ratio from 1:1 to 1:10 led to increasing BO yields (Fig. 4a and b) from 66.58 wt% to 80.18 wt% and 57.42 wt% to 65.49 wt% for OMWW-ethanol ratio and OMWW-methanol ratio, respectively. However, the SR yield in ethanol and methanol increased from 6.88 wt% to 13.06 wt% and from 8.19 wt% to 15.33 wt%, respectively. These results are similar to those reported in the literature [43,44]. During the liquefaction, the solvent has two major functions, namely dissolving the material and providing active hydrogen. Moreover, solvent plays a key role in the OMWW degradation mechanism as a reactant. At high concentration of raw material, solvent functions are relatively weakened; there is a clear link between solvent concentration and BO yield. Nevertheless, the SR formation mechanism was different from the excess condition biomass/water ratio. Due to the large amount of OMWW, the solvent could not provide enough ions (H+, OH−) and free radicals in order to induce free radicals reactions and base catalyzed, occurring in repolymerization to form SR products by the result of the high molecular weight of BO products [1]."
10,Influence of reaction temperature on bio-oils viscosity,"3.4 Influence of reaction temperature on bio-oils viscosity Viscosity is one of the important properties of BO when it is used as a fuel substitute. It plays a dominant role in fuel spray, combustion process and fuel-air mixture formation [45]. A high viscosity leads to poorer atomization of the fuel spray (poor combustion), requires a high energy for fuel pumping and increases engine deposits [46]. In contrast, a very low viscosity causes a leakage due to the insufficient lubrication for the precision fit of fuel injection pumps thereby. Fig. 5 illustrates the variations of BO viscosity, measured at 40 °C. The results showed an increasing trend with respect to reaction temperature. The viscosity increases from 8.3 mPa.s to 14.6 mPa.s for EWCS and from 6.6 mPa.s to 10.4 mPa.s for MWCS. From 240 °C to 280 °C, the increase of viscosity can be explained by the long chains depolymerization of lignocellulosic matrix. At this range of temperature, the pressure inside the reactor increases from 37 bar to 108 bar and from 56 bar to 96 bar for EWCS and MWCS, respectively. These conditions lead to enhance the depolymerization of biomass and subsequently to produce BO by the transfer of long chain hydrocarbons. Then with temperature increases from 280 °C to 320 °C, the augmentation of viscosity can be explained by the increase in the carbon chain length, the saturation degree of fatty acid and that of free fatty acid ester as well as the presence of free fatty acids. In addition, the repolymerization reaction of intermediary products took place by creating heavy compounds with higher viscosities. It is well known that at high temperature, in supercritical condition, radical mechanism becomes predominant. This kind of mechanism led to the formation of heavy compounds from repolymerization process. Pratas et al., [47] measured the fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters viscosities at different temperatures. Their results showed that the esters viscosity decreases with its unsaturation level and increases with the ester chain length (number of carbon atoms). On the other hand, the ethyl esters present a higher viscosity than the corresponding methyl esters of the equivalent fatty acid. Similar observations have been reported in the literature which give us clue about the evolution of the viscosity of bio-oils because of their content of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters."
11,Characterization of BO products,"3.5 Characterization of BO products The elemental composition and higher heating value (HHV) along with other properties of bio-oils obtained at the optimal conditions namely 280 °C, 30 min and (50/50%, w/w) of alcohol/water ratio, were analyzed. For a comparative purpose, the obtained results and relevant properties of European standard EN590 are summarized in Table 2 . Both produced BOs have a moisture content of 0.7 wt%. This value is higher than that of heavy fuel oil [48] and much lower than wood pyrolysis BO [49]. The OMWW BO density is around 900 kg/m3 which is in good agreement with the density range of fossil oil. On the other hand, the specification on density is important because, with fuels above upper limit, the injected mass will be greater than that of conventional fuels, which may affect the air-fuel ratio and the general fuel burning characteristics [50]. At the optimal conditions, the viscosity of BO was 7.6 and 10.2 mPa.s, for MWCS and EWCS, respectively. The BO produced from OMWW liquefaction in water had a higher viscosity (about 16.60 mPa.s at 40 °C) [3]. Hence, it was found that the viscosity of BO is reduced with the use of alcohols (ethanol or methanol). In fact, the presence of methyl or ethyl ester instead of free fatty acid lowered the viscosity. In addition, the density and viscosity are lower in presence of methanol as co-solvent compared to that of ethanol co-solvent, during the liquefaction reaction. The acid value measures the content of free fatty acids in biofuel. Considering that the presence of free fatty acids influences fuel aging, the norms specify a maximum value (e.g. 0.8 mg of KOH/g of sample recommended by ASMT D6751 norm). The maximum acid values found for the bio-oils produced from EWCS and MWCS in this work were 0.73, 0.76, respectively, which were well below the required value. The safety indicator during the transportation, storage and fuel operation is the flash point. It represents the lowest temperature at which the fuel starts to vaporize to form an ignitable mixture when it comes in contact with air [50]. Compared to the European standard EN590 for diesel fuel, the flash point is above the lower limit (55 °C). On the other hand, the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of the liquefaction BO is still higher than that of diesel fuels (EN590) but still lower than that of BO produced from alkaline liquefaction of swine carcasses [51]. The CFPP indicates the lowest temperature at which a fuel will lose its normal flow and tend to solidify or form crystals. This property is an important factor that can have detrimental effect on fuel supply system especially for countries with low ambient temperatures. 3.5.1 GC–MS analysis GC–MS was used to identify the chemical compositions of BO obtained in (50/50%, w/w) for each co-solvent system at 280 °C during 30 min. The main compounds are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . The total peak area of selected major compounds accounts for more than 80% of the total ion chromatogram. The esters were the major compounds, suggesting that ethanol or methanol can react with fatty acid to form fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE). Compared with fatty acid content in BO produced when pure water was examined [3], a significant reduction was observed in BO with employing EWCS or MWCS. During the liquefaction process, a series of complicated reactions occurred. A large quantity of esters were obtained from the liquefaction of OMWW with ethanol or methanol as solvent, which can be attributed to the esterification reactions between fatty acid and ethanol [44] or methanol. However, the sub/supercritical EWCS or MWCS could facilitate ester formation by the reaction of the co-solvent with acid content to form ethyl esters and methyl esters. On the other hand, the triglycerides and free fatty acids derived from the liquefaction were converted via esterification forming esters; carboxylic acids can also be partly degraded through decarboxylation at hydrothermal conditions to produce long chain hydrocarbons [52]. Hence, ethanol (or methanol) is an important hydrogen-donor alcohol; therefore, hydrogen transfer reactions can take a part in the liquefaction process by producing fatty acid esters. Octadecenoic acid ethyl ester and octadecenoic acid methyl ester are the most abundant ester. The addition of alcohols in OMWW increased octadecenoic acid ethyl ester or octadecenoic acid methyl ester content in BO. The analyses of the gas composition, obtained at the optimal conditions showed that C O 2 and N 2 represent the major gaseous components. The C O 2 concentrations were respectively 63.81% and 68.22% for experiments with MWCS and EWCS. The N 2 concentration was about 27% for both cases. Moreover, small amounts of H 2 were detected in the gas (3.04% with MWCS and 0.59% with EWCS). The C O concentration was almost the same (∼3%) while C 1 - C 4 hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and propane have a minor contribution to gas fraction. Similar results regarding the gas composition have been reported recently [1] in BO samples from Nannochloropsis oceanic. 3.5.2 FTIR analysis FTIR spectra analysis of raw material and BO produced by using EWCS or MWCS are shown in Fig. 6 -a. FTIR characterized the products within 4000–500 cm−1. The BOs spectra present similar profiles for both solvents implying the presence of similar chemical structure in BO. The intense band at 1710 cm−1 indicates the presence of the carbonyl groups in BO, such as the esters identified by GC–MS. The absorption at 2907 and 2855 cm−1 was attributed to C–H stretching vibration of CH3 of methoxy group. The high intensity absorption peaks at 1740–1700 cm−1 were ascribed to CO stretching from ketones and esters in bio-oils [22,53,54]. Moreover, CH bending vibration at 1400 cm−1 and CO stretching vibration in the range of 2000–1300 cm−1 could also indicate the presence of esters and fats in BO. The obvious peaks in the range of 800–730 cm−1 represent aromatic compounds and their substituted derivatives [22,55]. The FTIR analyses showed a good agreement with the GC–MS results. FTIR analysis of solid residue was performed to understand and determine the functional groups as shown in the spectrum depicted in Fig. 6-b. The same spectrum was observed for the SR using either EWCS or MWCS. According to the literature [56,57], it can be noticed that the SR is most likely consisted of phenols, carboxylic groups, acid and aromatics. Moreover, different oxygen-containing functional groups have been identified such as OH, CO, COH stretching. The bands at 1687–1550 c m - 1 assigned to be CC stretching [56–58]. The presence of aromatic CH in the band 1080–932 c m - 1 suggested the involvement of condensation through the liquefaction [57]. 3.5.3 Elemental analyses The CHON elemental analysis and HHV of SR and BO obtained in EWCS and MWCS are displayed in Table 5 . Temperature is the most influential factor on the elemental analysis. It can be seen that the carbon and hydrogen contents have greatly increased to that of the raw material. However, it can be noticed that these results may be attributed to the high temperature, thus, the increasing of temperature increases the carbon contents and decreases the oxygen content in BO. This may be due to the fact that ethanol and methanol are polar solvents which can act as hydrogen-donor. In other words, the alcohols had contributed to the reduction of oxygen content of the BOs during sub/supercritical liquefaction. Consequently, the HHVs of BO increased due to the combination of oxygen with hydrogen in biomass and hydrogen-donor solvent by producing water [40]. Similar results have been recently reported with increasing temperature and using the alcohols mixture [26]. In addition, during the HTL process, the deoxygenation reaction was favored at high temperature for BO production using alcohols as co-solvent [1]. The highest HHVs for EWCS and MWCS are achieved, with 39.20 MJ/kg and 43.18 MJ/kg, respectively, at the same temperature (280 °C). These values are approximately similar to that of fossil fuel. Regarding the elemental analysis for the SR, as shown in Table 5, the difference between MWCS and EWCS at different temperatures is not significant. On the other hand, the HHV ranged 26.92–21.94 MJ/kg for MWCS and 21.94–18.44 MJ/kg for EWCS. BO produced by MWCS and EWCS have almost similar carbon and hydrogen content but higher oxygen and nitrogen than the fossil oil. Sulfur was not detected in all BO products. In conclusion, alcohol addition during OMWW liquefaction not only improves the conversion rate but also the quality of the BO. 3.5.4 Thermal stability analysis of solid residue The thermal decomposition of SR has been examined in order to evaluate the potential of its use as a bio-char. Some published papers focused on the thermal decomposition of bio-char by HTL process of different biomasses [53,59]. The different SR, produced using EWCS and MWCS, were subjected to thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). The samples were heated from 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under high purity nitrogen gas of 60 ml/min. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , an initial peak of the first derivative curve (DTG) appeared at 90 °C and it presents around 2–3% of sample weight loss. This loss could be attributed to evaporated water from the sample, corroborating the moisture measurement by Karl Ficher method (about 4%). Furthermore, the decomposition of SR occurs mainly in two stages with a wide temperature range between 120 and 700 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, the first peak appears at 184.70 °C corresponding to 15.2% mass loss. The second peak appears at 419.58 °C resulting in sample degradation of 43%. Similar observations were reported by Gao et al [13]. After this, the degradation continued to proceed slowly to reach approximately 62% mass loss at 700 °C."
12,Energy recovery,"3.6 Energy recovery Fig. 8 -a and -b show the variations of HHV of BO and the calculated ER as function of temperature for HTL in EWCS and in MWCS respectively. The ER was calculated with and without consideration of organic solvent as expressed in Eqs. (5) and (6). The differences in the values calculated with and without considering organic solvent contribution outline the importance of taking into account the amount of solvent consumed during the biomass liquefaction. Similar conclusions were reported by Zeb et al. [60]. The results show that the process is energetically feasible, especially at the optimal conditions, concluding that sub-/supercritical HTL with alcohol-water co-solvent proved to be suitable for OMWW conversion into BO."
13,Conclusion,"Oil mill wastewater was liquefied in sub-/supercritical alcohol/water co-solvent to investigate different parameters affecting the products yield and their properties. Under optimal conditions (280 °C, 30 min, 50%/50% co-solvent), ethanol-water co-solvent contributed to the highest bio-oil yield (92.31 wt%) while methanol-water co-solvent resulted in better physical-chemical properties with higher heating value of 43.20 MJ/kg. A synergistic effect between alcohol and water lead to different reaction mechanism by dissolving high-molecular-weight compounds to bio-oil product. This behavior was confirmed since all experiments had higher bio-oil and lower solid residue yields. The chemical analyses showed that major compounds of BO were esters, outlying that alcohols are an efficient co-solvent with water. A further experimental study will be performed to examine diesel engine performance and pollutant emissions using produced BO as fuel."
