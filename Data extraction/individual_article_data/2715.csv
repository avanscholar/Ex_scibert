0,Introduction,"Producing bio-fuels from renewable lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to substantially reduce the anthropogenic carbon footprint. Hydrogenation of biomass-derived carbon resources is the most capital and energy intensive step which significantly increases the cost in the biomass conversion to fuels. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) is a new promising route for this step as adsorbed hydrogen, or reduction equivalents for hydrocarbon conversion, are produced in situ on the cathode [1–6]. With the ECH approach, the required electric energy can be provided from renewable energy resources such as solar radiation and wind making it a truly renewable process. However, current catalysts and fundamental understanding of the kinetics is lacking. Developing suitable catalysts requires understanding of the catalytic properties of the metal and the reaction mechanisms in condensed phase in the presence of electric potential. In ECH, noble metals have been found to be active for the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols [7,8], hydrogenation of phenolic rings, and hydrogenation and CO bond cleavage of diaryl ethers [9,10]. For the latter two examples, Pd showed much lower activity than Pt and Rh. Faradaic efficiency (selectivity for the electrons to participate in the desired reaction) on noble metals is usually low and seems controlled by reaction parameters rather than by the nature of the metal. Metals with high overpotentials for the H2 evolution reaction (HER), i.e., base metals and post-transition metals have also been tested for reduction of carbonyl groups showing dissimilar activities and Faradaic efficiencies to each other and to noble metals, which indicates stronger dependence on the nature of the metal. Pb cathodes, for instance, are efficient for the reduction of levulinic acid, whereas Cu is inactive [11]. Ni and Ni-containing alloys have been active for ECH of conjugated substrates such as benzene, acetophenone and styrene, while not active for ECH of non-conjugated olefins such as cyclohexene and geraniol [12,13]. Raney Ni has been reported to be active for ECH of phenolic and aromatic compounds, as well as of β-O-4 lignin models, including hydrogenolysis of phenolic β-arylethyl-aryl ethers [14,15]. Despite being abundant in bio-oils (up to 18% in carbon yield) and being prone to polymerization [16–18], comparably little work has been done on the reduction of aromatic aldehydes. The stability of the treated bio-oil is especially improved when reducing the carbonyl content, which distributes among sugars, ketones, and aldehydes [19]. Thus, benzaldehyde is an ideal model compound for low temperature hydrogenation aiming to stabilize lignin-derived bio-oils. Based on previous results [9,10], we hypothesize that below the electric potential required for direct reduction of the aldehydes, ECH and thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) follow the same reaction mechanism, and that the competition between HER and ECH is a specific property of the metal. To test these hypotheses, we explored the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde on Pt/C, Rh/C, Pd/C and Ni/C under ECH and TCH conditions. The results showed that the carbonyl functionality is quantitatively hydrogenated, which suggest that reactive carbonyl groups in bio-oil could be converted to stable alcohols at mild conditions. The study further elucidated the dependences of intrinsic activity of the metals on temperature and electric potential and provided insight into the mechanisms for hydrogenation of the target functionality in aqueous phase."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals and catalytic materials,"2.1 Chemicals and catalytic materials Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received: benzaldehyde (≥99.0%), acetate buffer solution (pH 4.6), ethyl acetate (≥99.9%, HPLC), Na2SO4 (≥99.9%), NaCl ≥99.9%), and KCl (≥99.9%). Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%), and activated carbon powder were used as received to prepare the Ni/C catalyst. High purity water, obtained with a Milli-Q water purification system with a resistivity of at least 18.2 MΩ cm, was used for all experimental procedures. H2 (Air Liquide, >99.99%) was used for thermal hydrogenation, N2 (Air Liquide, >99.99%) was used as protection gas to remove O2 from the electrolyte before ECH and Ar (Air Liquide, >99.99%) was used to change the partial pressure for determination of reaction partial orders in TCH."
3,Catalyst preparation,"2.2 Catalyst preparation The noble metal catalysts used in this study were Pt/C, Rh/C and Pd/C with a metal content of 5 wt.%, purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ni/C, with 5 wt.% metal, was prepared by impregnating activated carbon powder with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2. After drying at 383 K, the impregnated material was heated at a rate of 2 K min−1 in flowing H2 and treated in flowing H2 at 723 K for 5 h."
4,Catalyst characterization,"2.3 Catalyst characterization The metal loadings of the catalysts were verified by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) carried out on a UNICAM 939 AA-Spectrometer equipped with a GF 95 graphite furnace. The specific surface area and pore diameter of the catalysts were derived (according to BET and BJH models) from N2 physisorption isotherms, which were measured at 77 K on a PMI automated BET sorptometer. The samples were outgassed before measurements at 523 K for 2 h. The metal dispersion was determined by H2 chemisorption. Prior to the measurements, the materials were treated in vacuum at 588 K for 1 h and then cooled to 313 K. A first set of adsorption isotherms were measured from 1 to 40 kPa. Afterwards, the samples were outgassed at 313 K for 1 h and a second set of isotherms was measured, which corresponded to physisorbed H2. The concentrations of chemisorbed H2 were determined by extrapolating the difference isotherms to zero H2 pressure. The dispersion was estimated from the concentration of chemisorbed hydrogen assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1 metal to hydrogen atoms. The catalysts were also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Samples of the catalysts were ground, and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol. Drops of the suspensions were applied on a copper-carbon grid and the measurements were carried out in a JEOL JEM-2011 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 120 keV. Statistical treatment of the metal particle size was done by counting at least 300 particles detected in several places of the grid. The morphology of the working electrode (activated carbon felt) before and after incorporating the catalysts was investigated by a scanning electron microscope (JSM-7500F from JEOL)."
5,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation,"2.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) experiments were carried out in a two-compartment batch electrolysis cell described in Ref. [10]. A detailed drawing of the cell is shown in the supporting information (Fig. S1). Cathodic and anodic compartments were separated by a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane (Ion Power, Inc.), which was treated in a H2O2 solution (3 vol.%) and in sulfuric acid (2 M) before reaction. The working electrode was located in the cathode compartment and consisted of a carbon felt (Alfa Aesar > 99.0%) connected to a graphite rod (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%). The carbon felt was 3 × 1.5 × 0.6 cm. A platinum mesh (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) was used as counter electrode in the anodic compartment. The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl electrode (Ametek) with a double junction for protection. The cathode compartment was filled with 60 mL of acetate buffer solution at pH 5. 10 mg of the Rh/C, Pt/C, Pd/C or Ni/C catalyst powder were added into the cathode compartment. Prior to ECH, the electrolyte with catalyst powder in the cathode compartment was stirred at 500 rpm for infiltration of the powder into the carbon felt. The stirring at 500 rpm was maintained throughout the test. Polarization of the catalyst was performed under a constant current of −40 mA for 30 min. Benzaldehyde was typically added into the cathode compartment to obtain a final concentration of 20 mmol L−1. This concentration was varied ±25% to determine reaction orders in benzaldehyde. ECH experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure and constant applied potential while a flow of N2 was kept through the reactant solution. Temperature was controlled with a cooling/heating circulator (Julabo F25-ED). All electrochemical procedures were performed with a workstation VSP-300, Bio Logic. Control experiments showed increasing rates of benzaldehyde ECH with increasing stirring speed up to 400 rpm. Thus, all experiments were performed keeping the stirring at 500 rpm. The reaction rates increased linearly with increasing catalyst amount during the reaction. These tests allow discarding external mass diffusion limitation. The possible diffusion limitations in the pores was addressed by applying the Weisz-Prater criterion, which gave us confidence that the observed kinetics were not influenced by diffusion limitations (supporting information). The uncompensated resistance (iR drop) was determined by potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The applied potentials were corrected using the value obtained therein. The large size of the cathode and its porosity may lead to inhomogeneous iR-drops, where the measured values correspond to the smallest resistances between reference and working electrodes. However, in preliminary experiments we observed that the incorporation of catalyst to the felt is reproducible and hardly affects the measured impedance and rate. Thus, the results reported in this work are reproducible and the different catalytic performances can be accurately discussed."
6,Thermal catalytic hydrogenation,"2.5 Thermal catalytic hydrogenation Thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) was carried out in a glass batch reactor with 10 mg samples of Pt/C, Rh/C, Pd/C and Ni/C, with stirring at 500 rpm. Typical measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure with H2 (10 mL min−1) flowing through the reactant solution at 296 K. The preparation of the different reactant solutions and the benzaldehyde concentrations were the same as those described for ECH. Partial reaction orders in H2 were determined by changing the partial pressure of H2 (0.8 atm, 0.9 atm and 1 atm) using Ar as diluting gas. Gas flows were tuned by mass-flow controllers (El-Flow, Bronkhorst) and the temperature was controlled with the cooling/heating circulator Julabo F25-ED."
7,Product analysis,"2.6 Product analysis The experimental progress was followed by periodically withdrawing aliquots of 1 mL from the cathode compartment of the electrochemical cell (ECH) or the batch reactor (TCH). The products and left over reactants were extracted by adding 3 mL of ethyl acetate and allowing the organic and aqueous phases to separate. After that, the organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase, it was dried on Na2SO4. A sample of the dry organic phase was mixed with a solution containing phenol as an internal standard. Quantitative analyses of the samples were performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010), equipped with a plot Q capillary column (30 m × 250 μm) and a thermal conductivity detector. The H2 production rate in ECH experiments was measured by connecting the outlet of the cathode compartment to a Balzers mass spectrometer. Prior to the ECH experiment the spectrometer was calibrated by recording the response of the intensity of the signal to varying H2 flow (controlled by a mass flow controller). At the beginning of the experiment a three-way valve was switched to the cathodic cell to monitor the H2 evolution. The flow of H2 was determined by quantitatively comparing the signal of H2 with the calibration."
8,Results and discussion,"The catalysts used in this work (metal loadings of 5 wt.% as verified by AAS) were C-supported Pt, Rh, Pd, and Ni with dispersions of 26%, 20%, 30%, and 0.5% respectively (Table S1). This corresponds to average particle sizes of 3.8 nm for Pt, 4.2 nm for Rh, 3.3 nm for Pd and 200 nm for Ni. The particle sizes determined by H2 chemisorption and by statistical analysis of TEM images were in excellent agreement. Thus, although palladium hydride may form in Pd/C, the content of H in Pd is likely low or the kinetics of absorption are slow to affect H2 adsorption [20,21]. Additional physicochemical properties of the catalysts are described in the supporting information (Tables S1, S2, and Figs. S3–S5)."
9,Thermal catalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde,"3.1 Thermal catalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde Benzaldehyde was thermal catalytically converted via 2H-hydrogen addition to benzyl alcohol on Pt/C, Rh/C and Pd/C, whereas no conversion was observed on Ni/C (Fig. 1 shows the conversion profiles and Table S3 compiles the results). The rates of benzaldehyde conversion were 158 µmol s−1 gM −1, 520 µmol s−1 gM −1, and 928 µmol s−1 gM −1 on Pt/C, Rh/C, and Pd/C, respectively, at 298 K and 1 bar H2. The corresponding intrinsic activities followed the same trend with TOFs of 427 h−1, 964 h−1, and 1062 h−1, on Pt/C, Rh/C, and Pd/C, respectively. A blank experiment, i.e. no metal was infiltrated onto the carbon felt, was completed with by flowing H2 in the cell operating under identical conditions as the TCH experiment. The blank experiment did not show any conversion of benzaldehyde. Thus, the reaction must take place on the metal surface. Recent studies of hydrogenation in aqueous phase indicate that both reactants have to be adsorbed on the metal prior to the surface reaction according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood formalism [22], where H2 adsorbs dissociatively. The dissociative adsorption of H2 is well established in gas phase and has been observed in aqueous phase including at room temperature [23]. Thus, we postulate that the thermal catalytic hydrogenation in the aqueous phase proceeds by the addition of H atoms to the adsorbed organic at the metal surface [24]. The zero-reaction order in benzaldehyde observed during the reaction (Fig. 1) was confirmed by a series of experiments, where the initial concentrations of benzaldehyde were varied (Fig. S6-a). The reaction orders in H2 were 0.8 on Rh/C and Pt/C and 1 on Pd/C (Fig. S6-b). Within the framework of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics with rapid dissociative H2 adsorption, reaction orders of 1 in H2 and zero in benzaldehyde are possible for the following three scenarios: (i) the desorption of the product benzyl alcohol is the rate determining step; (ii) not-competitive adsorption of the reactants and the second H addition is the rate determining step in a stepwise addition; (iii) not-competitive adsorption of the reactants and a concerted addition of 2H atoms in the rate determining step. The supporting information shows the kinetic equations corresponding to these scenarios. The common conditions that must be met in all cases for the predicted orders to align with the observed ones include: low H surface coverage, high benzaldehyde surface coverage, and the rate determining step being either the last hydrogenation step or benzyl alcohol desorption. The activity trend Pt/C < Rh/C ≤ Pd/C prevailed in the temperature range from 285 K to 310 K (Fig. 2 ). The activation energies were 32 kJ mol−1, 27 kJ mol−1, and 21 kJ mol−1 for Pt/C, Rh/C, and Pd/C, respectively. The determined activation energies are lower than those reported for benzaldehyde hydrogenation at 393 K and 1 bar H2 on Pt and Pd (between 27 and 50 kJ mol−1) [25,26]. The adsorption enthalpies of benzaldehyde on the three catalysts were −39 kJ mol−1, −44 kJ mol−1, and −61 kJ mol−1 on Pt/C, Rh/C, and Pd/C, respectively (Table S4). Although these parameters do not influence the true activation energies (the reaction is zero order in benzaldehyde), they suggest that benzaldehyde more strongly adsorbs onto Pd than on Rh and Pt. The observation that benzyl alcohol is the only product from benzaldehyde hydrogenation is very different than the hydrogenation of phenol. With a Pt/C or Rh/C catalyst under the same conditions tested here, phenol hydrogenation proceeds via cyclohexanone (4H additions) to cyclohexanol (2H additions) [10,27]. Whereas, in benzaldehyde conversion seen in this study, the carbonyl group is hydrogenated (2H additions) to alcohol without hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. We propose that the substituting group impacts the adsorption strength causing this difference. This phenomena has been seen in other reactions. For example, we can compare how benzene interacts with a metal surface to how phenol and benzaldehyde interact. Literature has reported that phenol and benzaldehyde interact more weakly with metal surfaces than benzene due to the steric hindrance that hydroxyl and aldehyde groups pose to the ring distortion needed to form coplanar η6 adsorbed states [28]. Theoretical calculations, which neglect the solvent interactions, predict that the steric hindrance results in adsorption energies of phenol and benzaldehyde that are 10 kJ mol−1 and 20 kJ mol−1, respectively, lower than that of benzene on metal surfaces [29]. When solvation effects are taken into account, the adsorption energy of polar molecules decrease further [30], i.e., by up to 25% [22,31]. For benzaldehyde, the weakened interaction with the metal has been associated with repulsion of the aromatic ring from the metal surface [32]. This effect could cause a stronger interaction of the carbonyl group than with the aromatic ring, which is less reactive anyways [33,34]. Accordingly, the carbonyl group interacts with the surface metal atoms even when the ring adsorbs parallel to the surface [35]. On the other hand, it is surprising that the presence of the hydroxymethyl group in benzyl alcohol hinders the consecutive hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. Literature suggests that hydrogenation of benzyl alcohol can be achieved at high H2 pressure (60 bar) and relative mild temperatures (between 50 °C and 120 °C), significantly different to those used in this work. Moreover, solvation effects could also affect the reactivity of benzyl alcohol [36,37]."
10,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde and H2 evolution,"3.2 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde and H2 evolution Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of benzaldehyde was performed over the potential range of −0.5 V to −0.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) on Pt/C, Rh/C and Pd/C, and, owing to its different onset potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), from −0.8 V to −1.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) on Ni. In all ECH experiments benzyl alcohol was the only product of benzaldehyde hydrogenation, which competes with HER for reduction equivalents. HER proceeds as shown in Scheme 1 . Adsorbed H is first produced by the reduction of protons from solution (Volmer step). H2 is produced via the combination of adsorbed H (Tafel step) or the reaction of the adsorbed H with protons and electrons (Heyrovsky step). Thus, we define Faradaic efficiency as the percentage of the total current that is consumed for the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. We also note that the current was utilized only for benzaldehyde hydrogenation and H2 evolution as shown by quantitative analysis of the gas phase."
11,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde on C-supported noble metals,"3.3 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde on C-supported noble metals The ECH of benzaldehyde followed first order kinetics (Fig. S7) for both Rh/C and Pt/C catalysts. The intrinsic conversion rates (TOF) of benzaldehyde increased from 511 h−1 at −0.5 V to 2267 h−1 at −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl for Rh/C and from 948 h−1 to 2189 h−1 for Rh/C over the same range (Fig. 3 ). For the Rh/C, the Faradaic efficiency remained constant at around 65%. However, for the Pt/C catalyst, it decreased from 68% to 39% as the potential became more cathodic (negative). This suggests that the HER is more favored than ECH with increasingly negative potentials on Pt/C. Unlike the Rh and Pt catalysts, the conversion of benzaldehyde on Pd/C followed zero order kinetics (Fig. S7). The TOFs increased from 719 h−1 at −0.5 V to 3899 h−1 at −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl. The Faradaic efficiency on Pd/C was higher than what was observed on the Pt and Rh catalysts, ranging from 93% at −0.5 V to 99% at −0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3)."
12,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde on Ni/C,"3.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde on Ni/C In stark contrast with its performance in TCH, Ni/C was active for benzaldehyde conversion in ECH, albeit at higher cathodic potentials than the noble metals. Similar to Pd/C, the ECH benzaldehyde conversion followed zero order kinetics (Fig. S7). The TOF drastically increased from 675 h−1 at −0.8 V to 14,200 h−1 at −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3). However, the Faradaic efficiency was only 11% at −0.8 V and increased to 37% at −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3). Furthermore, when the benzaldehyde conversion exceeded 80% (at −1 V and −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl), hydrobenzoin, the product of benzaldehyde dimerization, was observed with selectivity of up to 3%. H2 chemisorption showed that Ni could activate H2 at room temperature. ECH experiments showed that benzaldehyde indeed adsorbs and reacts on Ni. This suggests that the lack of activity of Ni/C in TCH can be attributed to a passivating hydroxide layer formed in the absence of cathodic potentials. This is supported by a Ni Pourbaix diagram at 25 °C, which shows Ni to be unstable and to oxidize to Ni2+ [38]. However, at mild pH values (5–6), Ni2+ readily forms the hydroxide (Ni2+ + 2OH– → Ni(OH)2), which is known to passivate metal surfaces against corrosion [39]. Accordingly, when performing alternating and coupled TCH and ECH experiments, the reaction proceeded only in the presence of electric potential as shown in Fig. 4 a. Ni/C becomes active at −0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl because it corresponds to the minimum potential to keep Ni in metallic state at pH 5 [38]. Fig. 4b shows that when H2 was flowed in the presence of electric potential the conversion rates of benzaldehyde increased compared to the rates of ECH alone (in the absence of H2 flow). Therefore, the Ni surface is not saturated with H at −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl."
13,On the selectivity to electrocatalytic hydrogenation and to H2 evolution,"3.5 On the selectivity to electrocatalytic hydrogenation and to H2 evolution The intrinsic activity (TOF) of the catalysts for ECH of benzaldehyde increased as Rh/C < Pt/C < Pd/C < Ni/C (Figs. 3 and S8). The current density increased as Pd/C < Rh/C < Pt/C < Ni/C, whereas the Faradaic efficiency increases as Ni/C < Pt/C < Rh/C < Pd/C (Fig. S7). Note, however, that Ni/C requires higher cathodic potentials to show activity, therefore, it is difficult to interpret the direct comparisons of Ni with noble metals. ECH is favored over HER by factors of around 1.8 on Rh/C (Table S3). ECH is also twice as fast as HER on Pt/C at −0.5 V although the HER rates increase faster than ECH rates with cathodic potential. This led to lower ECH rates than HER rates at −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl on Pt/C. The ECH rates on Pd/C are one or two orders of magnitude higher than HER rates. In contrast, HER is faster than ECH by factors from 3 to 8 on Ni/C. Polarization curves in the absence and the presence of benzaldehyde were recorded below 1.5 mA cm−1 for the noble metals and below 8 mA cm−1 for Ni/C as shown in Fig. 5 (see Fig. S9 for measured currents). In the absence of benzaldehyde, the currents corresponded only to HER. The Tafel slopes (calculated from HFR-free potentials according to Refs. [40,41]) were 80 mV decade−1 on Ni/C, 90 mV decade−1 on Pt/C, 98 mV decade−1 on Rh/C, and 145 mV decade−1 on Pd/C (Table S4). These Tafel slopes are similar to values reported in the literature for HER applications [42,43]. A brief survey shows that the Tafel slopes for HER measured on Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ni increase with increasing pH (Table S5) and that the slope is independent from the onset of the HER. The Tafel slopes observed under our conditions indicate that similar increments of cathodic potential above the onset for H2 evolution lead to larger HER rate increases on Ni/C than on the noble metals. Pt/C and Rh/C have similar dependences of current on potential, whereas the largest Tafel slope among the studied catalyst on Pd/C points to the slowest HER rate increase with cathodic potential. This trend of HER Tafel slopes (Ni/C < Pt/C < Rh/C < Pd/C) matches the variation of the Faradaic efficiency (Ni/C < Pt/C < Rh/C < Pd/C). Thus, we attribute the different Faradaic efficiencies on different catalysts to intrinsic rates of HER at given cathodic potentials above the onset for H2 evolution. That is, Ni/C exhibits the fastest HER rates, which leads to the lowest Faradaic efficiencies. On the other extreme, Pd/C has the lowest HER rates, which leads to outstanding Faradaic efficiencies during ECH. The fundamental implication of this conclusion is that the HER/ECH selectivity is governed by kinetics rather than by the overpotential for H2 evolution on a given metal. The presence of benzaldehyde did not affect the onset of current in function of potential but increased the Tafel slopes compared to those in its absence, i.e., to 100 mV decade−1 on Ni/C, 150 mV decade−1 on Pt/C, 120 mV decade−1 on Rh/C, and 190 mV decade−1 on Pd/C (Fig. 5 and Table S4). This indicates that benzaldehyde had a detrimental effect on the current density reached at any given potential on all catalysts, probably by covering a fraction of the reduction sites decreasing the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts."
14,Reaction mechanisms for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde,"3.6 Reaction mechanisms for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde The ECH activity trend Rh/C < Pt/C < Pd/C < Ni/C prevailed from 285 K to 310 K (Fig. 6 ). The corresponding activation energies were 21 kJ mol−1, 25 kJ mol−1, 14 kJ mol−1, and 41 kJ mol−1 respectively. These values were lower than those in TCH, which we tentatively attribute to differences in the reaction mechanisms dominating in the presence of cathodic potential. The activation energy on Ni/C was 41 kJ mol−1 at −0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl. The reaction rates for electrocatalytic hydrogenation are related to the coverages of reactants, the nature of the metals (intrinsic barriers for hydrogen addition) and cathodic potential. As H coverages are sustained by electrical potential, increasingly cathodic potentials must increase the H coverages. Accordingly, the hydrogenation rates were observed to increase with increasingly cathodic potentials. However, it is not possible to decouple the effect of increasing H coverage from the effect of increasing the driving force (Butler-Volmer kinetics). The effect of benzaldehyde coverages on reaction rates can be qualitatively discussed on the basis of the observed reaction orders. The reaction orders in benzaldehyde on Pd/C and Ni/C are zero, whereas on Pt/C and Rh/C the reaction orders are one (Figs. S7 and S10). These differences do not result from the interaction strength between benzaldehyde and metal alone as the enthalpies of adsorption were dissimilar. For example, Ni/C and Pd/C both exhibited a reaction order of zero, yet their enthalpies of adsorption were −36 kJ mol−1 and −61 kJ mol−1, respectively, Table S4. Instead, we propose that the charge at the surface induced by the electric potential influences the coverage of benzaldehyde [44,45]. The negative charge at the surface in ECH may weaken the interactions with the carbonyl group, which has a basic character. The competitive adsorption of H, increased as the potential becomes more negative, could also lead to depletion of benzaldehyde at the surface. The concomitant decrease of the benzaldehyde coverage at the surface increases its reaction order. The reaction order in benzaldehyde on Pd/C and Ni/C of zero is attributed, by extension, to relatively high benzaldehyde coverages and low H coverages. On Pd, the low H coverages are caused by its fast reaction in ECH. On Ni, on the other hand, the coverage of H may be low due to its fast reaction in HER. Thus, high coverages of benzaldehyde could be produced by depletion of adsorbed H. The changes in reaction orders do not account for the fast ECH conversion rates compared to the TCH rates. That is, if the coverages decrease with potential (as concluded for Pt/C and Rh/C), rates would have decreased at invariant reaction barriers. Thus, we surmise that the potential must affect the reaction mechanism. Electrochemical hydrogenation might proceed through stepwise or concerted addition of protons and electrons. Stepwise addition may follow several sequences as shown in Scheme S1 and Scheme S2 of the supporting information. The most likely ones are H+-e−-e−-H+ and e−-H+-e−-H+ in protic media according to polarization curves previously reported [45]. However, pKa values of conjugated acids and one-e- reduction potentials do not support stepwise mechanisms as shown in Fig. 7 [46,47]. For instance, the pKa of protonated benzaldehyde is around −4, i.e., its concentration is negligible under our experimental conditions (pH = 5). On the other hand, the direct reduction of benzaldehyde requires potentials more negative, e.g., −1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl [48] than those accessed in this work (from −0.4 V to −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl). Therefore, stepwise addition of electrons and protons to the organic molecule should have high-energy intermediates. The exception is the protonation of the phenyl ketyl radical (PhHC O−), which readily undergoes protonation (pKa of 8 for the conjugate acid in solution) [49]. If the ketyl radical (1-hydroxy-1-phenylmethyl) were formed in solution upon one-e− addition then hydrobenzoin formation (dimer of benzaldehyde) would be expected. However, this dimer was only detected in small quantities on Ni/C at −1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl and in substantial concentrations (up to 38% at 65% benzaldehyde conversion) on the bare carbon felt at −2.2 V vs Ag/AgCl (Fig. S11). Thus, while stepwise radical pathways are indeed enabled when the driving force is sufficiently enhanced, they are not followed under typical metal-catalyzed reaction conditions. However, we propose that reduction of benzaldehyde with adsorbed H is not the main route under ECH because conversion rates are higher and activation energies are lower compared with TCH. We postulate instead, that benzaldehyde hydrogenation in the presence of electric potential occurs by concerted additions of e− and H+, which allow high energy intermediates to be avoided [50]. Fig. 7 shows that the concerted electrochemical reduction (diagonal lines) leads to the same intermediates as those in TCH (without passing through high energy charged intermediates). The steps of electron transfer may be inner-sphere or outer-sphere processes depending on the interaction strength of the reactants with the surface [51,52]. At present, we propose that the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde is an inner-sphere process because the presence of benzaldehyde impacts the rate of H2 evolution, wherein the electron transfer for the reduction of protons is an inner-sphere process [52]."
15,Conclusions,"Thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) and electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol were performed on Pt/C, Rh/C, Pd/C, and Ni/C. In TCH (at 298 K and 1 bar H2) the intrinsic activity followed the trend Pt/C < Rh/C < Pd/C (TOFs of 427 h−1, 964 h−1, and 1062 h−1, respectively), whereas Ni/C was not active. Reaction orders of zero in benzaldehyde and 1 in H2 allow proposing that the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where the rate determining step is the last hydrogenation step or product desorption. In ECH (with cathodic potential, at 298 K and 1 bar N2), the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde competes with H2 evolution. The hydrogenation rates increase with increasing cathodic potential and the activity trend is Pt/C < Rh/C < Pd/C (e.g., TOFs of 2189 h−1, 2267 h−1, and 3899 h−1, at −0.9 V Ag/AgCl). Notably, Ni/C is very active in ECH, albeit at higher cathodic potentials than noble metals. The Faradaic efficiency increases as Ni/C < Pt/C < Rh/C ≪ Pd/C (e.g., 35%, 39%, 64%, and 99.6%, respectively at set potential of −0.9 V Ag/AgCl), which correlates HER rates rather than offsets of HER. Thus the efficiency is governed by kinetics of hydrogen addition to the organic relative to the Tafel and Heyrovsky steps. The marked differences between the reaction orders in benzaldehyde in ECH and TCH on Pt and Rh indicate that surface coverages decrease in the presence of a cathodic potential. The high rates and consistently low activation energies in ECH suggest that at least one hydrogen addition step involves the concerted addition of e- and H+, which avoids higher-energy transition states associated with the addition of adsorbed hydrogen (as in TCH) or the formation of unfavorable intermediates via stepwise addition of H+ and electron."
