0,Introduction,"Potentially obtained from lignocellulosic biomass, γ-valerolactone (γ-VL) is a very promising versatile intermediate for production of fuel additives and chemicals [1,2]. Due to very high interest towards γ-VL, its efficient production is currently a topic of intensive research. Investigations are mainly focused on reduction of levulinic acid (LA) and its esters (LAE) by molecular hydrogen in the presence of metal catalysts [1,3]. Application of supported metal catalysts is especially advantageous owing to simplicity of product recovery and catalyst recycling. Previous investigations evidence outstanding activity of Ru/C as catalyst for the hydrogenation [1,4]. Although reduction of LA into γ-VL over Ru/C with H2 as reductant is highly efficient and nearly quantitative, further development can facilitate the process economics. Application of a liquid reductant derived from biomass potentially enhances the sustainability of a γ-VL production process and enables milder operation conditions. Formic acid was shown to be an efficient reductant for the transformation of LA into γ-VL in the presence of noble metals [5–8]. Alternatively, a reduction of levulinates with an alcohol as hydrogen donor was reported catalysed by (i) complexes of Ru [9]; (ii) metal oxides and hydroxides with the best activity for ZrO2 [10] and Zr(OH)4 [11]; (iii) solid Lewis acids such as Zr-beta [12,13] or Hf-beta [13] zeolites; (iv) solid metal-based catalysts, e.g. Raney Ni [14] or Pd/C [15]. Interestingly, all of the previously reported solid catalysts were active for the transformation of LAE into γ-VL, but the rate of LA transformation into γ-VL under the same reaction conditions was significantly lower [10]. For instance, strong adsorption of LA onto basic sites of ZrO2 appeared to be the reason for catalyst deactivation by LA [10]. In the presence of a Zr-beta zeolite, quick esterification of LA with the alcohol used as hydrogen donor takes place followed by a slow reduction of the alkyl levulinate into γ-VL [12]. Although some approaches towards synthesis of LAE from lignocellulose were proposed [2], LA remains a cheaper and therefore more attractive substrate than LAE. Though the catalytic activity of Pd/C for direct reduction of LA with alcohols was reported very recently, the reaction required KOH as co-catalyst, causing challenges in product purification [15]. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient reduction of levulinic acid and its esters in the presence of secondary alcohols as hydrogen donors and Ru/C without any co-catalyst, applying conventional and microwave heating."
1,Results and discussion,"In this communication we report high efficiency of Ru/C for synthesis of γ-VL based on LA and secondary alcohols, namely i-propanol ( i PrOH) and 2-butanol (2-BuOH). The experimental part can be found in electronic supplementary information (ESI). As stated above, Ru/C is very active for reduction of LA and its derivatives with molecular hydrogen [1,16,17]; moreover, Yang et al. highlighted Ru/C as a promising catalyst for synthesis of γ-VL based on ethyl levulinate (EL) and i PrOH [14]. We started this work from testing a Ru/C catalyst for the reduction of LA with i PrOH using heating in a conventional autoclave. The reaction was successfully complete within only 2 or 3h at 160 or 140°C, respectively (Fig. 1 ). In contrast to the previously reported data for basic [10] or Lewis acid [12,13] catalysts, we found only slight traces of i-propyl levulinate and pseudo-i-propyl-levulinate in the reaction mixture. At moderate (10–20%) conversions of LA, yields of the esters reached ca. 2–4%. However, at high and full conversions of LA, the selectivity towards γ-VL was >99% and the total yield of the by-products did not exceed 0.4%. According to the literature data, the efficiency of numerous processes can be significantly improved by using microwave-assisted heating, including the production of γ-VL [15]. Indeed, the hydrogenation of LA with i PrOH over Ru/C under microwave heating was even more rapid than when using a conventionally heated autoclave (Fig. 1). It is reasonable to argue that the difference in reaction kinetics originates from improved heat transfer for microwave-induced heating compared to conventional heating. For the reaction using conventional heating, an autoclave was placed into a pre-heated aluminium jacket. During the reactions, temperature was maintained by means of a thermocouple placed into a heating jacket (Fig. 1SI). In a control experiment, we found out that ca. 25min were required to reach heat equilibrium inside of the autoclave. On the contrary, the set temperature was reached in only ca. 2.5min when using microwave-assisted heating (Fig. 2SI). Since some time is required for heating-up the reaction mixture, especially in the conventional method, the initial reaction rates were somewhat low. This is reflected by an induction period for the conversion of LA (Fig. 1). Additionally, exposed to air Ru/C catalysts contain Ruδ+ oxidised species which undergo in-situ reduction, as shown below. Therefore, the presence of the induction period can be also explained by the reduction of the catalyst generating Ru0 active centres. Almost full yield of γ-VL was observed at 140°C after 60min using microwave heating. Increasing the temperature to 160°C results in a full yield towards γ-VL within 25min. Noteworthy, product distributions were the same for the experiments using autoclave- and microwave heating. Inspired by these promising results, we continued the investigations using microwave heating. Screening of catalysts showed that ruthenium exhibits the highest activity among carbon-supported metal catalysts. Poor conversions (maximum 5%) and yields (maximum 2%) were achieved by using Pt/C, Pd/C, Rh/C, Cu/C, and Ni/C. In contrast, Ru/C allowed 43% conversion of LA and 41% yield of γ-VL (after 30 min at 140 °C). Unlike the observation stated by Amarasekara et al. [15], microwave-assisted hydrogenation of LA was possible over Ru/C and highly efficient even without the addition of alkaline additives. The activity of Ru/C outperformed that of ruthenium catalysts loaded on other supports (Table 1 , entries 1–5). Systematic studies are required for revealing the dependency of catalytic activity on catalyst properties such as metal dispersion and acidity of a support. Nevertheless, even unsupported RuCl3·xH2O was active for synthesis of γ-VL, though less efficient compared to supported catalysts (Table 1, entry 6). It is known that microwave-assisted heating of Ru3+ salts in the presence of a reductant such as i PrOH results in rapid synthesis of Ru0 nanoparticles [18]. Produced in-situ, Ru0 species are presumably active sites for synthesis of γ-VL in the presence of RuCl3·xH2O. Application of LAE as substrates gave the following order of decreasing reactivity: LA>methyl levulinate (ML)>EL>butyl levulinate (BL) (Table 1, entries 1 and 7–9). The bulky alkyl chains clearly result in inhibition of the reaction. Interestingly, previously reported studies revealed no dependency of reactivity of LAE on the length of alkyl substituents when performing hydrogenation with H2 over Ru/C [16] or conducting the reduction with alcohols over basic catalysts [10,11]. While no intermediate was detected in the hydrogenation of LA itself, esters of γ-hydroxyvaleric acid were observed during the conversion of LAE to γ-VL. This indicates that LA and LAE are hydrogenated first to give γ-hydroxyvaleric acid and its esters prior to lactonization. Other alcohols were tested as hydrogen donors in LA hydrogenation. Besides i PrOH, 2-BuOH was an active reductant in the preparation of γ-VL (Table 1 entries 1 and 10). The lower activity of 2-BuOH in comparison to i PrOH coupled with the formation of 2-butyl levulinate could be due to steric hindrance. This was confirmed by utilizing higher alcohols like 2- and 3-octanol, which did not allow any conversion of LA. In the presence of primary alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, only esterification reactions were observed with 17% and 8.1% yields, respectively. Focussing on the reaction mechanism, a dehydrogenation–hydrogenation path catalysed by Ru/C is suggested (Scheme 1 ). Analysing the gas phase of the reaction mixture showed in-situ formation of molecular hydrogen during the reaction. The yield of acetone always exceeded the yield of γ-VL, confirming that both reactions mostly take place independent of each other (Table 1). Finally, the dependency of the oxidation state of Ru on the catalytic activity was investigated. First, commercial Ru/C was reduced with i PrOH under microwave irradiation at 140°C for 2min and dried at 80°C for 1h. This sample is referred to as Ru/C-red. In order to induce the formation of surface ruthenium oxide, Ru/C was kept in air overnight at 80 or 120°C. Thus produced catalysts are referred to as Ru/C-80 and Ru/C-120. Investigation of the catalysts by means of TPR revealed the presence of a characteristic peak at ca. 100–110°C, corresponding to reduction of ruthenium oxide [19,20]. The TPR curves of the catalysts also exhibited high-temperature peaks that were previously attested to the formation of hydrocarbons due to reduction of the carbon support by H2 in the presence of Ru species [19,21]. Though the peak corresponding to reduction of ruthenium oxide and the high-temperature peaks partly overlap (Fig. 2 ), we estimated the hydrogen uptake based on the peak height (Fig. 3SI). Fig. 3 shows the LA conversion plotted against the hydrogen uptake of the catalyst. Remarkably, the hydrogen uptake, which correlates with the amount of surface ruthenium oxide, decreases as follows: Ru/C-120>Ru/C-80>Ru/C>Ru/C-red. Importantly, Fig. 3 emphasises that the conversion of LA decreases with an increasing concentration of surface ruthenium oxide, suggesting Ru0 as catalytically active sites for LA reduction to γ-VL. Lower hydrogen uptake of Ru/C-red compared to Ru/C confirms in-situ reduction of surface ruthenium oxide with i PrOH. This could be further supported when considering acetone to γ-VL ratios obtained for differently pre-treated Ru/C. As mentioned above, the yield of acetone always exceeds that of γ-VL (Table 1). Remarkably, pre-oxidation of Ru/C results in further increase of acetone-to-γ-VL molar ratio: from 2 for Ru/C-red to 6 for Ru/C-120 (Table 1SI). Consequently, surface of Ru/C catalysts first undergoes reduction of ruthenium oxide to give surface Ru0 species and acetone. Thereafter conversion of LA (Scheme 1) takes place on Ru0 active centres to give γ-VL and acetone. Finally, the recyclability test was successfully conducted for Ru/C-red where a slight increase in LA conversion to γ-VL was observed in the second run to be 67% instead of 61% in the first run. We assign this observation to the reduction of the remaining unreduced Ru species during the first run. ICP-OES analysis of Ru/C revealed that ruthenium loading remains constant upon recycling."
2,Conclusion,"In summary, we demonstrated that LA and LAE can be efficiently reduced with secondary alcohols into γ-VL over Ru/C. The best yields were obtained based on LA or ML as substrate and i PrOH or 2-BuOH as reductant. The reaction proceeds rapidly in conventional autoclaves and could be further accelerated under microwave heating. A two-step dehydrogenation–hydrogenation mechanism of the reaction was suggested, i.e. (i) dehydrogenation of an alcohol generates molecular hydrogen in-situ, (ii) hydrogenation of a substrate with H2 into γ-VL occurs via γ-hydroxyvalerates. Metal Ru0 species are active for the transformation. In-situ activation of the catalyst by reduction of oxidised Ruδ+ centres under reaction conditions was observed."
