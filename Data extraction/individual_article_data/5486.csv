0,Introduction,"A large number of poisonous and harmful organic pollutants and heavy metals are directly or indirectly discharged into the aquatic environment, leading to frequent eutrophication, blackening and odors in natural water bodies (Li et al., 2019a). Recently, ferrate (Fe(VI)), as Fe in the +6 valent, has received extensive attention in efficient control of heavy metals, organic contaminants and antibiotics resistance gene due to its synthetic characteristics of chemical oxidation, coagulation, and disinfection (Sharma et al., 2015; Shin et al., 2018). However, the oxidation capacity of Fe(VI) is highly dependent on the solution pH, with the redox potential of 0.72 V at alkaline pH (Wu et al., 2020a). That is, at the related pH of wastewater treatment, Fe(VI) presents a low reactivity. Besides, Fe(VI) possesses distinct selectivity with organic components, which significantly relies on the chemical structure of contaminants, and poorly degrades some recalcitrant constituents (Gao et al., 2020). These crucial inadequacies impede the practical use of Fe(VI) in water pollution remediation. According to previous literature, intensifying Fe(VI) mainly contains the following four pathways. (i) Acid-activation enhances the redox capacity of Fe(VI) and improves the dissolved organic carbon removal by Fe(VI) (Manoli et al., 2017). (ii) Reducing agents, such as calcium sulphate (CaSO3) (Shao et al., 2019a), carbonaceous materials (e.g., carbon nanotube and graphene oxide) (Pan et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2019), and homogeneous reductants (e.g., creatinine, I− and S2O3 2−) (Feng et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2021), promote the generation of Fe(IV) and Fe(V), which provide several orders of magnitude more active than Fe(VI) (Sharma, 2002; Terryn et al., 2017). (iii) Some peculiar substances can stabilize high-valent Fe intermediates to prolong their lifetime (e.g, bicarbonate and pyrophosphate) (Luo et al., 2019; Melton and Bielski, 1990). (iv) UV and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) exhibit excellent catalytic activity for improving Fe(VI) reactivity through forming reactive oxygen species (e.g., •OH, SO4 •− and O2 •−) (Wu et al., 2018; 2020a). Until now, limited information about intensifying Fe(VI) is available, thus necessitating exploring more green and economical technologies to boost Fe(VI). Generally, H2O2 as a green oxidant plays a critical role in environmental remediation since it is a frequently-used precursor to generate •OH (E0 (•OH /H2O) = 1.9−2.7 V) (Liu et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2020). Several studies have been conscious of the enhancement contribution of H2O2 towards Fe(VI) decomposition as well as pollutant degradation in the Fe(VI) system (Lacina and Goold, 2015; Shao et al., 2019a). That is, the combination of exogenic H2O2 and Fe(VI) may be a viable alternative to remove a wide array of organic contaminants. However, the oxidation mechanism of the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system is far from clear. PMS, a derivative of H2O2, has been suggested to promote Fe(VI) to oxidation of atrazine by forming SO4 •− (Wu et al., 2018). Does the Fe(VI)−H2O2 process promote Fe(VI) activity by generating radicals like the Fe(VI)−PMS system? Furthermore, H2O2 is also an essential product of Fe(VI) decomposition. In aqueous solution, the short-lived high-valent Fe ions are extremely unstable and could be immediately decomposed into ferric (oxyhydr) oxides and H2O2 by attacking water or themselves. As early as in 1996, one work employed stopped-flow spectrum and premix pulse radiolysis apparatus to reveal the stoichiometric factor between Fe(VI) and H2O2, and regarded O2 as the final product (Rush et al., 1996). Based on the above job, some studies elaborated in-situ H2O2 produced by Fe(VI) self-decay can further convert Fe(VI) and Fe(IV) into Fe(IV) and Fe(II) (Zhu et al., 2020), indicating the two-electron reductive property of H2O2. Moreover, according to the linear fitting between redox potentials and the logarithm of the reaction rates, Sharma et al. deemed H2O2 matched well with the two-electron transfer peculiarity (Sharma, 2010). Nevertheless, a previous research presented in the Fe(VI) system, O2 •− was detected by using tetranitro-methane as a probe (Lee et al., 2014), suggesting the existence of one-electron transfer process. Besides, by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, Li et al. manifested the involvement of •OH in Fe(VI) oxidizing phenolic compounds (Li et al., 2021). Therefore, there is a necessity to systematically illustrate the transform pathway of H2O2 in Fe(VI) self-decay process and confirm the roles of •OH and O2 •−. In consideration of the promoting effect of H2O2 in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems, our work expects to provide a comprehensive reveal regarding the H2O2 activation mechanism in both systems. In this work, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was selected as a model contaminant not only because it is one of the highest detection rates in the environment but also because its degradation intermediates by Fe(VI) and other reactive oxidants have been well demonstrated (Wu et al., 2020b). Specifically, we first evaluated the effect of H2O2, including in-situ H2O2 produced by Fe(VI) self-decay and exogenic H2O2 (ex-situ H2O2), on SMX degradation by Fe(VI). Then, we identified the reactive oxidants in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems, and comprehensively summarized the role of in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 in activating Fe(VI) by integrating with experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, in view of the universality of peroxide coupled with Fe(VI) oxidation process as well as the structural similarity of peroxide, the characteristics of low dosage peroxide activating Fe(VI) were revealed. Finally, the possibility of environmental application of the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system was assessed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals In this work, potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) was synthesized via a wet chemical method according to the Thompsons’ approach (Thompson et al., 1951). Other chemicals were purchased from commercial reagent companies. The specific information about these reagents is listed in Text S1 of the Supporting Information."
3,Degradation procedures,"2.2 Degradation procedures Degradation experiment was performed in a 250 mL beaker containing 150 mL reaction solution with a magnetic stirrer (500 r min−1) in a temperature-controlled at 25 ± 1 °C. Solution pH was maintained from 7.0−9.0 by 20 mM borate buffer. The oxidation reaction was initiated by simultaneously adding H2O2 and 50 mL Fe(VI) solution into a pH-buffered solution containing the desired concentration (1−15 μM) of target contaminant. An aliquot of 1.5 mL sample was collected at predetermined time intervals, filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and quenched with 20 μL of 1 g L−1 hydroxylamine sulfate. All the degradation experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the average results and standard deviations were shown. More specific experimental procedures are described in Text S2."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods The concentration of pollutants (e.g., SMX, 2,4−dichlorophenol (2,4−DCP), atrazine (ATZ), bisphenol A (BPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), p−nitrophenol (PNP), methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO)) was monitored by a high-performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Agilent 1260, USA) equipped with an Eclipse XDB C−18 (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) column for details summarized in Table S1 and Text S3. Besides, detailed experimental procedures for measuring residual Fe(VI) and H2O2, and verifying the generation of Fe(Ⅳ) were presented in Text S4−6. DFT calculation processes were depicted in Text S7. The degradation products of SMX were analyzed by an ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer (UPLC−QTOF−MS/MS, Agilent 6500), and the details were provided in Text S8."

6,In-situ and ex-situ H2O2 accelerated Fe(VI) towards oxidation of SMX,"3.1 In-situ and ex-situ H2O2 accelerated Fe(VI) towards oxidation of SMX To evaluate the role of H2O2 in Fe(VI) self-decay process, the H2O2 concentration in the Fe(VI) system was measured. Fig. 1 a suggests the decomposition rate of Fe(VI) with an initial dosage of 100 μM is higher than 50 μM, which is generally ascribed by the autocatalytic role of in-situ induced iron oxide solids in previous studies (Huang et al., 2018). However, the catalytic effect of H2O2 seems to be also important. According to Sharma et al. reported, one molecule of Fe(VI) can assault two water to stimulate Fe(VI) self-decay and eventually convert into a molecule of H2O2 at near-neutral situation (R1 in Table 1 ) (Zhu et al., 2020). That is, based on the Fe(VI) consumption (73 μM Fe(VI) was decomposed) at an initial dosage of 100 μM after reaction 20 min, the solution can theoretically contain approximate 73 μM H2O2, while merely about 5 μM H2O2 was detected. No H2O2 was examined at an initial Fe(VI) dosage of 50 μM, which is likely to present the participation of in-situ H2O2 in promoting Fe(VI) self-decay. Meanwhile, more rapid oxidation of SMX was observed at higher dosage of Fe(VI) (Fig. S1a). The phenomenon might indicate that apart from the promotion role of magnetic nanocrystalline iron oxide, H2O2 possibly contributed to activating Fe(VI) decomposition, thereby improving SMX degradation. Meanwhile, the influence of ex-situ H2O2 on SMX degradation was also determined. As depicted in Fig. 1b, ex-situ H2O2 significantly promotes Fe(VI) to remove SMX, and the efficiency increases from 35 to 78% within 300 s at pH 8.0. Alone H2O2 was powerless for SMX degradation. The above dates were well fitted with the pseudo-first-order rate law, and the obtained conversion frequencies of Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems are 0.08 and 0.30 min−1, respectively (Fig. S1b). Moreover, Fig. S2a shows the enhancement caused by H2O2 considerably depends on the additive amount of H2O2. As the initial H2O2 dosage varied from 10 to 70 μM, the removal of SMX increased dramatically. When adding more than 70 μM H2O2, the promotion effect was suppressed. This phenomenon may be explained as excessive H2O2 can compete with SMX for reactive species, thus restraining SMX degradation. Therefore, 70 μM H2O2 was considered as the initial dosage for the subsequent experiments. Besides, ex-situ H2O2 significantly promoted Fe(VI) to oxidize SMX at pH 7.0−9.0 (Fig. S2b). For the Fe(VI) system, with increasing reaction pH, SMX degradation was gradually inhibited and the removal rate decreased from 56.0 to 4.4%. The oxidation capacity of Fe(VI) is obviously pH-dependent, because the protonated H2FeO4 and HFeO4 − have larger spin density to possess higher oxidation potential than the deprotonated FeO4 2− (Luo et al., 2020). While in the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system, the highest removal efficiency was exhibited at pH 8.0. This may be associated with the instability of Fe(VI) in an acid ambient and the competitive consumption of reactive species by H2O2."
7,Negligible contribution of radicals in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems,"3.2 Negligible contribution of radicals in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems 3.2.1 Identification of active oxidants In view of the intricate self-decomposition products of Fe(VI), including Fe(V), Fe(IV), Fe(III), Fe(II) and H2O2, the possible active oxidants (e.g., Fe(V), Fe(IV), •OH and O2 •−) in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems were seriatim examined to preliminarily evaluate the role of in-situ and ex-situ H2O2. EPR spectroscopic technique has been frequently employed to monitor radicals (Zhou et al., 2020a). The Fe(VI)−H2O2 system showed a faint distinctive signal of the DMPO−OH adduct (αN = αH = 14.9 G) (Zhou et al., 2020b), while it was not presented in the Fe(VI) system (Fig. 2 a). This seems to suggest the formation of •OH with the addition of ex-situ H2O2. Recently, because of the involvement of inverted spin trapping (DMPO → DMPO•+ → DMPO−OH) or the Forrester Hepburn mechanism (DMPO → DMPO−OH− → DMPO−OH), the detected DMPO−OH signal is accounted for the oxidation of DMPO by high-valent Fe intermediates or/ and •OH (Jing and Chaplin, 2017). Tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) as a typical scavenger of •OH (k( • OH/TBA ) = 3.8–7.6 × 108 M−1 s−1) was used to further explore the generation of •OH (Lai et al., 2020a). Once •OH participated in the degradation of SMX, SMX removal rate would be inhibited by TBA. Fig. 2b and 2c suggest that TBA cannot affect SMX removal no matter in Fe(VI) system or in Fe(VI)−H2O2 system. It is well known that •OH could be trapped by benzoic acid to produce p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA) (Hong et al., 2020). No p-HBA was detected and benzoic acid was not degraded in both systems (Fig. S3a and b), further demonstrating that •OH is not the active oxidant. In brief, in-situ H2O2 and even adding ex-situ H2O2 cannot induce the production of •OH for degrading SMX in Fe(VI) oxidation process. Therefore, the false EPR signal of •OH in the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system is likely to be deciphered by the Forrester-Hepburn mechanism caused by reactive Fe species, which agreed well with the higher yields of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) in the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system (see the discussion in the next section). Besides, since there may be a one-electron transfer pathway between Fe(VI) and H2O2 to generate O2 •−, it is imperative to certify the existence of O2 •−. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) as a representative scavenger and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as a characteristic probe were employed to verify the generation of O2 •− (You et al., 2020). As depicted in Fig. S3c, there is no characteristic absorption peak at 560 nm, which belongs to the characteristic wavelength of formazan (the product of the reaction between NBT and O2 •−) (Li et al., 2018). Negligible effects of SOD on SMX degradation were presented in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems (Fig. 2b and c). Moreover, DMPO was adopted to trap O2 •−, and the six characteristic peaks of DMPO-O2 •− were not examined in both systems (Fig. 2a). These phenomena collectively indicated no O2 •− was generated and high-valent Fe species might go through a two-electron transfer step to react with in-situ and ex-situ H2O2. It has been well demonstrated that methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) can be oxidized by high-valent Fe species to produce methyl phenyl sulfone (PMSO2) through an oxygen-atom transfer step (R2−R4), which observably differs from the radicals-based oxidation pathway (Ren et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). SMX degradation was completely inhibited by 30 μM PMSO in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 oxidation processes (Fig. 2b and c). On account of the insignificant effect of PMSO addition on Fe(VI) consumption (Fig. S4a), Fe(VI) is inefficient to react with PMSO. Moreover, based on the previous study and our results, it can be found that Fe(VI) presents a similar reactivity with SMX (34.9 M−1 s−1, Fig. S1c) and PMSO (4.05 M−1 s−1, R2) at pH 8.0, indicating that SMX degradation could be partly confined by the competition reaction between PMSO and SMX for Fe(VI). Overall, Fe(VI), Fe(V) and Fe(IV) may collectively contribute to SMX degradation, but Fe(V) and/ or Fe(IV) are the main reactive oxidants for SMX removal. The consumption of PMSO and the generation of PMSO2 were also examined. Fig. 3 a and b suggest that ex-situ H2O2 can significantly promote Fe(VI) to oxidize PMSO. Specifically, the PMSO removal rates in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems are 24% and 65%, respectively, meaning that with the addition of ex-situ H2O2 more high-valent Fe intermediates were generated. Approximate 100% PMSO2 yields further illustrate that the role of radicals is ignorable in in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 activating Fe(VI). It is an indisputable fact that Fe(IV) goes through a two-electron transfer step to oxidize PMSO, and then converts into Fe(II) (R4). To confirm the involvement of Fe(IV), BPY was employed to chelate with Fe(II). The characteristic absorbance peaks at 522 nm resulted by Fe(II)−BPY complex (ε = 8650 M−1 cm−1) were presented in both systems (Fig. S4b) (Shao et al., 2020), suggesting the existence of Fe(IV). However, since of the instability of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) and the inaccessibility of the apparatuses, the direct evidence about the formation of Fe(V) and Fe(IV) is hard to obtain. To sum up, even with the exogenous addition of H2O2, the involvement of radicals is insignificant, thereby only high-valent Fe species contributed to pollutant degradation in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems. 3.2.2 Selective oxidation In general, high-valent metal−oxo species will present obvious selectivity in removing organic compounds (Zong et al., 2020; 2021). To further evaluate the influence of H2O2 on Fe(VI) oxidation process, the degradation efficiencies of 2,4−DCP, ATZ, BPA, CBZ, PNP and ATZ were measured. Fig. 3c and d show ex-situ H2O2 can accelerate Fe(VI) to remove all of the tested organic contaminants, except ATZ. The enhancement effects were obviously different, which greatly rested with the chemical structure of organic compounds. Except for the tailing data, the pseudo-first-order rate method was used to simulate the main parts of each data set, and the obtained rate constants were shown in Fig. S5. The Fe(VI)−H2O2 system for oxidizing organic pollutants was 3.75−18.39-fold faster than those examined in Fe(VI) system. However, negligible degradation of ATZ was displayed in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems. This might be accounted for the weak electron donating capacity of ATZ. Although Fe(IV) and Fe(V) are more active than Fe(VI), they are still insensitive to oxidizing electron-deficient compounds, which agreed well with previous studies (Shao et al., 2019a; Zong et al., 2021). In short, the distinct selective oxidation phenomena manifested the obstacle of in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 in fostering Fe(VI) to oxidize electron-deficient pollutants and the few contribution of radicals. 3.2.3 Degradation intermediates of SMX Taking into account the difference in oxidative activity between radicals and high-valent Fe species, SMX degradation products were also confirmed to further determine the contribution of reactive oxidants. A total of eleven products in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems were examined and were listed in Table S2, with the corresponding MS/MS spectrums were exhibited in Figs. S6−S16. Noteworthily, the total ion chromatograms depict the inapparent difference in product peaks in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 oxidation processes (Fig. S17), and almost identical oxidation intermediates were detected in both systems (Table S2). The results exactly coincide the identical reactive species in the two oxidation processes. Since the degradation pathway of SMX in the coupling process of Fe(VI) and H2O2 has not been reported yet, we minutely analyzed the SMX conversion pathways, which were shown in Fig. 4 . SMX degradation was initiated with hydrogen replacement reaction, resulting in the generation of TP1 and TP2. Then, TP2 was further oxidized via the oxygen transfer step to produce TP3. Given the abundant H atoms of aromatic amines, hydrogen abstraction step was considered. Thus, there will be a lot of N-centered radicals involved in the reaction, thus forming TP4 and TP5. The two products were also detected in the CaSO3/Fe(VI) system, where Fe(IV) and Fe(V) were considered as the main reactive species (Shao et al., 2019a). Due to the electrophilic addition of the hydroxyl group, the hydroxylated product TP6 of SMX would be introduced. Furthermore, Sharma et al. have revealed that Fe(VI) is inclined to nucleophilic attack of isoxazole moiety rather than electrophilic attack (Sharma et al., 2015). Therefore, the ring-opening reaction of isoxazole moiety was likely to be involved to generate TP7. In pathway E, TP8, TP9 and TP10 were derived from successive oxygen-atom transfer steps. Overall, the degradation products determined in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems are highly similar to other high-valent metal-oxo species oxidation processes (Zong et al., 2020), and greatly coincide with the oxidation characteristics of high-valent Fe species (e.g., inner sphere substitution or electrophilic addition via one or two electron transfer pathway) (Rush et al., 1995). Besides, radicals (e.g., •OH and O2 •−) were revealed to primitively oxidize the methyl group on the isoxzaole ring of SMX to produce corresponding hydroxylation products (e.g., m/z = 288 [M+H]+ and 256 [M+H]+) (Du et al., 2018; Song et al., 2021). These products were not checked no matter in the Fe(VI) system or in the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system, further indicating their similar reactive oxidants and the negligible contribution of •OH and O2 •−."
8,Mechanistic insights,"3.3 Mechanistic insights 3.3.1 H2O2 reduced high-valent Fe species via a two-electron transfer pathway On the basis of the above experimental findings, the participation of O2 •− and •OH in pollutant degradation are excluded in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems, suggesting H2O2 performed as a reductant to intensify Fe(VI) oxidation reactivity via forming more Fe(IV) and Fe(V). Therefore, in the absence of SMX, Fe(VI) consumption was monitored to testify the reducing property of H2O2. Fig. S18a indicates only a small amount of Fe(VI) was decomposed without adding H2O2 (9.2 μM). With increasing the initial dosage of ex-situ H2O2, Fe(VI) consumption became higher. Furthermore, the low detection rate of in-situ H2O2 in the Fe(VI) system also proves the crucial reducibility of H2O2 (Fig. 1a). Moreover, no evidence regarding the generation of O2 •− illustrates the two-electron transfer peculiarity of in-situ as well as ex-situ H2O2. This is because once H2O2 only transfers one electron to Fe(VI), the one-electron transfer product O2 •− will participate in degrading SMX. In order to further confirm the above mechanism, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was applied. Since the oxidation of H2O2 demands preferential complexation with the hydrogen atom of metal ions to stimulate the inner-sphere oxidation mechanism, unprotonated FeO4 2− could not achieve such coordination and cut no ice with H2O2 (Rush et al., 1996). Hence, in our experimental condition (pH 8.0), protonated HFeO4 − was employed as the representative component for calculation. Fig. 5 a and b show that the energy barriers for O2 and O2 •− formation are 16.690 and 43.537 kcal mol−1, severally. A general rule of thumb suggested reactions with a barrier of 21 kcal mol−1 or less will proceed readily at room temperature (Young, 2001). That is, although the reaction of Fe(VI) and H2O2 to form Fe(IV) and O2 presented a positive Gibbs free energy change, the reaction can also proceed. The results powerfully verify the favorable thermodynamics situation to oxidize H2O2 by Fe(VI) via a two-electron step at room temperature, while O2 •− cannot be produced through the reaction between Fe(VI) and H2O2. Specifically, the oxidation process is started with the polymerization pathway that two hydrogen atoms of H2O2 integrate with the hydrogen atom of HFeO4 − and its adjacent oxygen atom, and eventually releases O2 (R5). The dissolved oxygen (DO) content of reaction solution was monitored to demonstrate the generation of O2. Fig. 5c shows the DO value in the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system increases as the reaction proceeds. For single Fe(VI) solution, the DO value did not changed, which is possibly deciphered that in the process of Fe(VI) self-decay, in-situ produced H2O2 is too few to affect the DO content. 3.3.2 Proposed reaction pathways for the generation of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) Since reactive Fe species (i.e., Fe(VI), Fe(V) and Fe(IV)) generally oxidize contaminant via a direct one or two electron transfer process, such as transforming PMSO to the correlative sulfone PMSO2 (Luo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a), it is sensible to be analogous to the similar mechanism with Fe(VI) regarding the oxidation of H2O2 by Fe(IV) and Fe(V) (R6 and R7). Therefore, Fe(II) and Fe(III) can be generated through the reductive reactions of Fe(V) and Fe(IV) by H2O2. A previous work stated uncomplexed Fe(III) can reinforce Fe(VI) decomposition and improve pollutant degradation. Jiang et al. considered Fe(OH)3 can catalyze Fe(VI) reduction by H2O2, thus contributing to the enhancement (Jiang et al., 2016), while a cutting-edge study revealed that Fe(OH)3 can make Fe(IV) at a higher content through the oxidation process between Fe(VI) and Fe(III) (R8) (Zhang et al., 2021). Moreover, Fe(VI) presents a flexible reactivity with Fe(II) to form Fe(V) (R9) (Lee et al., 2014). That is, apart from in-situ H2O2, Fe(II) and Fe(III) induced by chain reactions can also make a partial contribution to accelerating the generation of Fe(IV) and Fe(V). Therefore, the effects of exogenic Fe(II) and Fe(III) on SMX degradation were examined. Fig. S18b and c show both the two low-valent Fe species can accelerate Fe(VI) to remove SMX. Above results illustrate that even adding ex-situ H2O2, similar reactive oxidants were formed in Fe(VI) oxidation process, indicating that in Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)−H2O2 systems, H2O2 showed similar contribution for activating Fe(VI). Incorporating our conclusion with the previous literature, the schematic diagram of in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 activating Fe(VI) is depicted in Fig. 6 . Initially, ex-situ H2O2 reduces Fe(VI) via a two-electron transfer step to produce Fe(IV) (21.18 M−1 s−1, R5), which is faster than Fe(VI) self-coupling reaction (4.05 M−1 s−1, R1) (Lee et al., 2014), thus accelerating the formation of Fe(IV) intermediate. Then, Fe(IV) is put forward to be reduced by H2O2 to yield Fe(II) or go through self-decay, leading to the generation of Fe(III) (R7 and R10). Although the catalytic mechanism of Fe(III) is indistinct, our results show Fe(III) definitely facilitates Fe(VI) to degrade SMX. In addition, newly formed Fe(II) can react with Fe(VI) to form Fe(V) (R9), thus competing with Fe(VI) self-decay as well as H2O2 to expend Fe(VI). Fe(V) makes a similar contribution with Fe(IV), referring to going through self-decay or being reduced by H2O2 (R6 and R11). Meanwhile, Fe(VI), Fe(V) and Fe(IV) continually decompose to release in-situ H2O2, which performs an identical effect with ex-situ H2O2 resulting in quickly generating Fe(IV) and Fe(V) to elevate target contaminant removal."
9,Proposed reaction characteristics of peroxide activation of Fe(VI),"3.4 Proposed reaction characteristics of peroxide activation of Fe(VI) Reductive agents play non-negligible roles in accelerating the oxidation of organic contaminants by Fe(VI) (Feng et al., 2018). In this work, we elaborate that H2O2 as a reductant contributes to promoting Fe(VI) decomposition via a two-electron redox pathway. Whether PMS and peroxydisulfate (PDS), which are derivatives of H2O2, can also strengthen Fe(VI) through such a two-electron reduction mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, we carried out related experiments to reveal the oxidation performance and mechanism of Fe(VI)−PMS and Fe(VI)−PDS systems. Noteworthily, if there is a one-electron transfer pathway, radicals (e.g., SO4 •− and •OH) will be generated and participate in contaminant removal. As shown in Fig. S19a, PMS and PDS slightly accelerate SMX degradation in contrast with the Fe(VI) oxidation process, and the promotion effects are inferior to H2O2. The results are exactly corresponding with the standard redox potential of the three kinds of oxidant (E0 = 1.76 V (H2O2), E0 = 1.82 V (PMS) and E0 = 2.01 V (PDS)) (Georgi and Kopinke, 2005; Govindan et al., 2014). H2O2 provides the optimal reducibility, thus more likely to reduce Fe(VI). However, it has been well-documented that PMS is easier to be activated than H2O2 and PDS since of its asymmetric molecular structure (Geogre and Dionysios, 2004). That is, the promotion phenomenon caused by peroxide is inconsistent with the radicals-based activation process. To verify whether radicals are involved in SMX oxidation, PMSO degradation and methanol (MeOH) scavenging experiments were carried out. Fig. S19b and c show that PMS and PDS can promote Fe(VI) to convert PMSO. Moreover, the yields of PMSO2 in both Fe(VI)−PMS and Fe(VI)−PDS systems are about 100%, indicating that only high-valent Fe species contribute to SMX oxidation. Generally, MeOH is regarded as a scavenger of both SO4 •− (k1(SO4 •−, MeOH) = 1.6−7.7 × 107 M−1 s−1) and •OH (k1(•OH, MeOH) = 1.2−2.8 × 109 M−1 s−1) (Wu et al., 2020b), and was employed to certify the contributions of SO4 •− and •OH. As expected, the removal rate of SMX was not affected (Fig. S19d). All the results verified that no radicals are generated in Fe(VI)−PMS and Fe(VI)−PDS systems. However, Wu et al. illuminated there is a synergistic effect on degradation of atrazine by coupling Fe(VI) with PMS, where SO4 •− is the major active species (Wu et al., 2018). It is exactly contradictory with our results, and the reason why resulted in the consequence may be accounted for the disparity in reaction pH and dosage. Actually, in most radicals-based Fe(VI) oxidation processes, high dosages of Fe(VI) were added to catalyze PMS or other oxidants, which mainly utilized the catalytic reactivity of Fe(VI) self-decay product Fe(III) particles, thereby underutilizing Fe(VI) and increasing the cost of water treatment. Given the negligible effect of radicals in the Fe(VI)−peroxide oxidation process, the conclusion that oxidant with peroxo (O−O) bond is inclined to react with Fe(VI) via a two-electron transfer pathway can be concluded. Moreover, the conclusion might provide an unique insight into the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system. Overall, it is promising to further explore the reactive relationship between Fe(VI) and O−O bond."
10,Practical application of the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system,"3.5 Practical application of the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system The above results suggest the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system is a feasible alternative to remove pollutants as its stronger oxidation property than Fe(VI) alone and harmless reductive product (O2). The background components (e.g., dissolved organic matter and different kinds of ions) ubiquitously present in water environment, which may significantly affect chemical oxidation process (Wu et al., 2020b). To investigate the applicability of the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system, the effects of representative inorganic ions in water, including four kinds of anions (NO3 −, HCO3 −, Cl−, SO4 2−) and two kinds of cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), on SMX degradation were researched. Furthermore, humic acid (HA) is a primary ingredient of dissolved organic matter and its influence was also revealed. Correlative results are shown in Figs. S20 and S21. When 10 mM coexisting ions were added, except for HCO3 −, negligible restriction effects on SMX degradation were presented. These results are different from the oxidation process with radicals (e.g., •OH, O2 •− and SO4 •−) as the principal reactive species. Take •OH as an example, Li et al. have reported that in the process of hydroxylamine promoted Fe3O4/PMS for degradation of ATZ the removal efficiency of ATZ decreased from 94% to 82% in the presence of 10 mM Cl−, where •OH was the main reactive oxidant (Li et al., 2019b). This is because Cl2 •− with lower redox potential will be produced through the chemical reaction between •OH and Cl− (Lai et al., 2020b). In this work, high concentration HCO3 − slightly inhibited SMX degradation due to the increasing reaction pH (data not shown), which could change the protonated state of Fe(VI), thus deteriorating SMX removal rate. Besides, Fig. S21c suggests that the inhibitory effect of SMX degradation becomes more evident with increasing the dosage of HA. The results could be ascribed as that: (i) reductive constituents in HA may reduce Fe(IV) and Fe(V) to Fe(II) or/ and Fe(III); (ii) HA can compete with target pollutant to react with high-valent Fe species. Moreover, a series of degradation experiments in surrounding water were implemented. As presented in Fig. S22, the maximum SMX degradation efficiency was achieved in deionized water, and a similar result was observed in tap water. This may be because there were few natural organics to compete with SMX in deionized water and tap water. In contrast, the residual rates of SMX in river water and lake water were 40.1% and 50.0%, respectively, merely after reaction 5 min. The results could be explained by the relatively high dissolved organic constituents in real water (Table S3). These consequences attempt to show the Fe(VI)−H2O2 system is an efficient technology for removing contaminants in practical application."
11,Conclusion,"In this work, we systematically demonstrated the activation mechanism of in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 in Fe(VI) oxidation process. Active oxidants identification, selective oxidation characteristic, degradation product analysis, and DFT calculations collectively suggested that even exogenous addition of H2O2 did not induce the generation of radicals. High-valent Fe species were proposed to oxidize in-situ and ex-situ H2O2 via a two-electron transfer step, thus directly or indirectly accelerating the generation of Fe(IV) and Fe(V) to boost Fe(VI) reactivity. In addition, Fe(VI)−H2O2 system was put forward to be a feasible strategy for water pollutant remediation due to its strong oxidizing property and good resistance to natural water substances. Compared with other homogeneous reducing additives (e.g., S(IV), Fe(III), NO2 −, and I−) to activate Fe(VI), H2O2 seems to be more environmentally friendly because of its harmless product O2. More interestingly, our work utilized the degradation intermediates of target compound to determine the contribution of reactive oxidants, which might be a good paradigm for the identification of active species in Fe(VI)-based oxidation process. Besides, PDS and PMS were manifested to perform a similar role as H2O2 in activating Fe(VI). It would be necessary to further evaluate the characteristics, environmental risk and economic benefits of the Fe(VI)−peroxide system in contrast with other Fe(VI)−reductant systems."
