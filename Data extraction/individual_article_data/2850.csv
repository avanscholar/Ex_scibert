0,Introduction,"Pesticides are of great significance to agricultural production [1]. At present, a variety of formulations have been developed, including water emulsion [2,3], emulsifiable concentrate [4,5] and suspension concentrate (SC) [6–8]. Being an eco-friendly formulation in which insoluble solids are dispersed in water, SC has received special attention in recent years [9]. However, as SC is a thermodynamically unstable system, its application faces the problem of macroscopic phase separation caused by the agglomeration and sedimentation of the dispersed solids [10,11]. Thus, it is important to find effective methods to improve the long-term stability of SC. Polymeric dispersants, such as polycarboxylic acids and their salts, are frequently used to prevent the aggregation and sedimentation of solid particles by modifying their surface properties[12], such as increasing the electrostatic repulsion and/or strengthening the steric hindrance. Sato et al. used sodium polyacrylate to enhance the dispersion stability of titanium oxide (TiO2) [13]. Pang et al. enhanced the stability of silicon suspension by optimizing the hydrophilicity of the solid surfaces with poly (acrylic acid) ammonium [14]. Hua et al. used a polycarboxylic acid-containing copolymer to strengthen the steric hindrance and enhance the dispersion stability of TiO2 [15]. Polymeric dispersants have also been widely adopted to improve the stability of SC. A typical example is polycarboxylate acid sodium salt (SD-816, Scheme 1a) which is a polycarboxylate with strong, multivalent adsorption [16]. However, due to the relatively poor surface activity of SD-816, using it alone is difficult to achieve good wettability and atomization of SCs, resulting in pesticide waste and environmental pollution. The above issue could be well resolved by applying an additional dispersant in SC, which could create a synergetic stabilizing effect. Although synergetic effects have been well documented in surfactant science as seen in nonionic/anionic [17,18], cationic/anionic [19–21] and hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon [22] surfactant mixtures, they have been rarely investigated in SCs. Recently, we have successfully synthesized a series of aliphatic alcohol polyoxyethylene ether phosphate potassium (AEnP-K, Scheme 1b) whose hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value changed with the number of ethylene oxide (EO). Compared to other types of synthetic surfactants, AEnP has the advantages of high surface activity, good biocompatibility and low price. AEnPs are a class of surfactants known as suitable dispersants for various solids such as starch [23] and carbon fibers [24]. They have also been used to disperse carbendazim pesticides [25]. Triggered by these promising prospects, in this paper we used AEnP-K to improve the dispersibility of SCs which contain tebuconazole (Scheme 1c) as the effective component. We first investigated the surface activities of SD-816, AEnP and their mixtures by both static and dynamic surface tension measurements, followed by a detailed evaluation of the thermal storage stability and thixotropic properties of SCs. The atomization and wetting properties of diluted SCs were also explored. Finally, the roles of AEnP in SCs and the mechanism behind the high stability of SCs were discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials SD-816 was purchased from Shanghai Shida Polymer Materials Co., Ltd. Tebuconazole (> 98%) was obtained from Jiangsu Qi Zhou Green Chemical Co., Ltd. Organic silicone defoamer (AFE-3168) and xanthan gum were purchased from Dow Corning Chemical Co., Ltd. and Zibo Zhong Xuan Biochemical Company, respectively. Ethylene glycol (EG, AR) was bought from Sinopharm Group Reagent Co., Ltd. AEnP-K (n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 9) were synthesized following previous procedures developed in our laboratory [26]. The water used in the experiment was all triple-distilled by ultrapure water plants (Ulupure, China)."
3,Evaluation of surface activities of AEnP-K and SD-816,"2.2 Evaluation of surface activities of AEnP-K and SD-816 Static surface tension (SST) was measured using the Wilhelmy plate method by surface tension meter K12 (KRŰSS Company, Germany). Dynamic surface tension (DST) was measured using the bubble pressure method in a BP100 surface tension meter (KRŰSS Company, Germany). Before the measurement, the surface tension of water was ascertained in the range of 72.0 ± 0.5 mN·m−1, and the temperature of the measurement vessel was kept in the range of 25 ± 0.1. The results were the average of three measurements with a 90 s interval between each measurement."
4,Preparation of tebuconazole SCs,"2.3 Preparation of tebuconazole SCs Tebuconazole SC with a concentration of 25 wt% was prepared by wet milling following published procedures [27]. In brief, tebuconazole (25 g), 5 wt% Xanthan gum (5 g), AEnP-K (2 g), SD-816 (4 g) and EG (3 g) were mixed in the grinding bottle. Water was added until the total weight reached 100 g. Zirconium balls (100 g) with a diameter of 10 mm were then put into the grinding bottle, and the mixture was milled under a 1200 r·min−1 for 1.5 h."
5,Basic characterization of tebuconazole SCs,"2.4 Basic characterization of tebuconazole SCs The tebuconazole SC was diluted to 0.25 g·L−1 and placed into the ZETASIZE Nano-ZS90 (Malvern Company, United Kingdom). The Zeta potential of the SC was measured after equilibrium for 2 min at 25 °C. The particle size was measured by a laser particle size method using 0.2 g SC in the JL-1177 measurement vessel (Jingxin Powder Equipment Company, China). The particle size distribution was represented by D90, which is a value larger than 90% of the particle diameter in the system. Measurements were performed 3 times and the average value was taken. The suspension ratio of the SC sample was measured by a solid particle weighing method [28]. The test has proceeded at a SC concentration of 2 wt%. The suspension ratio (Rs) was calculated using the following formula: (1) R s = m 1 - m 2 m 1 × 10 9 × 100 % where m 1 is the mass of the solids in the SC sample involved in the measurement, m 2 is the mass of residual solids. The solid particles in the SC could be directly observed using."
6,Stability of the SCs,"2.5 Stability of the SCs The thermal storage stability of a SC is defined as the change ratio of the particle size and that of Zeta potential before and after storing at 54 °C for 14 days [27]. The thixotropic property was characterized by a three-stage thixotropy. At room temperature, the viscosity (η 0 ) was measured on the MCR 102 Rheometer (Anton Paar company, Austria) at a low shear rate (0.25 s−1). After 25 s, the high shear rate (1000 s−1) started. After 10 s, the shear rate returned to the original value (i.e., 0.25 s−1) and the viscosity (η 1 ) was recorded. The ratio of viscosities (R t ) after the above circle was then calculated. (2) R t = η 1 η 0 × 100 %"
7,Evaluation of practical applications of SC,"2.6 Evaluation of practical applications of SC Brassica Chinensis L., Brassica oleracea L., and Spinacia oleracea L. were used as plant samples, and pesticides were dropped on the leaves at 25 °C under a relative humidity of 58%. The droplets were observed using a Lx POL microscope (Laboamerica Company, America). The contact angle was measured at 25 °C under a relative humidity of 65% with a waiting time of 120 s. The SC was diluted to 5 wt%, the spray droplet size could be directly measured on an Lx POL microscope (Laboamerica Company, America) by spraying on a glass slide with a sprayer, and the spray distance was 0.5 m."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Surface activities of the surfactants,"3.1 Surface activities of the surfactants Surfactant solutions have different surface tensions at different concentrations. This trend can be seen in Fig. 1a and b. The EO addition number (n) has a great impact on the surface properties of AEnP-K. The smaller the n, the lower the surface tension. Additionally, the efficiency to reduce the surface tension of water, reflected by PC20 [29], is also different. A large value of PC20 indicates that the surfactant has high efficiency in reducing surface tension. SD-816 is less effective in reducing surface tension than AEnP-K. Besides, the surface tension at critical micelle concentration (γ CMC) of SD-816 is much larger (~43 mN·m−1) compared to that of AEnP-K. It reflects that the ability in reducing the surface tension of SD-816 is worse than AEnP-K [30]. Parameters obtained from surface tension measurements are listed in Table 1. Dynamic surface tension refers to the relationship between the surface tension of a solution over time. The more the surface tension decreases per unit time, the faster the formation of a new interface.11 Since the essence of the formation of the gas-liquid interface and the solid-liquid interface are similar, the change of the solid-liquid interface can be represented by the gas-liquid interface. From the perspective of the preparation process of the suspension, the surface of the solid particles can be considered to have undergone a transition from the solid-solid interface to the liquid-solid interface. During the formation of the liquid-solid interface, a solution capable of forming a new interface more quickly is beneficial to the rapid preparation of the suspension. According to Fig. 1c, the dynamic surface tension of AEnP-K is heavily influenced by n. The larger the n, the faster the surface tension decreases, which indicates the higher rate of forming a new interface. It can be seen from Fig. 1d that the dynamic surface tension change of SC is similar to AE9P-K, indicating that AE9P-K has a major effect on the formation of a new SC interface. At t→0, the diffusion control mechanism can correctly reflect the adsorption of surfactants at the interface [31], and surfactants with large diffusion coefficients (D) tend to format new interfaces quickly [32]. As can be seen from Fig. 1d, the increase of n is benefitted to the formation of a new interface quickly for the AEnP-K solution, while the SD-816 solution is not capable of forming a new interface quickly. Surfactants with large diffusion coefficients could improve the surface charge in a short time, which is beneficial to improve the stability of SCs. Details of the calculation of the diffusion coefficient have been given in Supporting Information (SI 1)."
10,Tebuconazole SCs stabilized by different surfactant(s),"3.2 Tebuconazole SCs stabilized by different surfactant(s) The tebuconazole SCs (25 wt%, see the experimental section for details for the preparation) prepared with different dispersants showed different states. Samples prepared using different dispersants were numbered in Table 2. Sample 1 with AE9P-K as a dispersant had a severe gelatinization phenomenon, which was recorded in Fig. 2a., i.e., the sample has poor fluidity and contains many bubbles, which shows a shear thickening behavior after the bubbles are extruded. This observation indicates that using AE9P-K alone significantly increases the viscosity of the system and accelerates the gelatinization of the sample. Haramagatti et al. found a similar phenomenon in the study of suspensions containing iron oxide and a yellow pigment [33]. In comparison, other samples had better fluidity and were stable under low shear rates. Samples that are not prone to gelatinization are considered to have a dense surface charge distribution. It can be seen from Fig. 2b that the combination of AE9P-K and SD-816 could give the surface of the solid particle a higher negative charge, accounting for the high stability of sample 7. Additionally, according to the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) model, samples with a higher Zeta potential may have thicker Stern layers, which is manifested as a decrease in sample viscosity [34], which is consistent with the phenomenon in Fig. 2a. The average size of the solid particles in the suspension is shown in Fig. 2c. Interestingly, in the measurement of the Zeta potential of the surfactants (SI 2, Fig. S1), it was found that the Zeta potential of the SCs did not coincide with that of the surfactants, indicating that the Zeta potential of the SCs was provided by the synergistic effect of the two surfactants. The solid particles in SC prepared with dispersant can reach 1.1–1.4 µm. Despite the heavy aggregation of solid particles in the SCs in the solid state, SEM images (SI 3, Fig. S2) show that the surface of tebuconazole particles dispersed by the dispersant is more rounded and smaller than the original tebuconazole particles that have been grinded. According to Stokes' law, the size of the solid particles has a significant effect on the settling rate of a suspension [35]. For samples 2–7 which have similar viscosities, the smaller the particle size, the slower the settling rate and the higher stability of the SCs. The ratio of the formation of tebuconazole SC is a description of application stability. The higher the suspension ratio, the better the stability of the SC in water after dilution. The suspension ratio (Rs) values of the samples with different dispersants are shown in Fig. 2d, large Rs values represent great suspension. Sample 7 has the highest value while Sample 1 has the lowest one. The results showed that SD-816 plays a significant role in stabilizing the SC, which could be due to the steric hindrance created by its relatively bulky molecular structure. The ""comb"" molecular structure effectively forms a flexible barrier on the surface of the solid particles, and when the solid particles are close to each other, these ""comb"" structures can reduce the conformational entropy by compression or overlap, resulting in a repulsive effect between solid particles [36–39]. The large difference in Rs between sample 2 and sample 7 means AE9P-K also contributes significantly to the Rs of the SC. Comparing samples 3–7, it can be seen that the EO addition number n in AEnP-K has an obvious effect on the improvement of Rs of SCs. While the EO group is hydrophilic, it can produce hydration, which is stretch fully in water and preventing solid particles from coming close to each other [40,41]. With increasing n, the hydration brought by AEP is more intense, which could effectively increase the Rs of SCs."
11,Stability of tebuconazole SCs,"3.3 Stability of tebuconazole SCs It is worth noting that the Rs of the SCs were tested after a 50-times dilution, in which the properties of the solid particles were mainly examined. Differently, the stability of SCs is crucial when it comes to actual production, distribution and use. After the suspension is formed, the solid particles in it will spontaneously aggregate and settle [42–44]. Since the modified solid surface adsorbs a large amount of surfactant and the time needed for natural settlement is relatively long, thermal storage is used to speed up the stability test [45]. The thermal stability of SC can then be quantified by comparing the Zeta potentials and average particle sizes before and after thermal storage. The smaller the changes, the better the thermal stability. The results are shown in Fig. 3a. After thermal storage, both the Zeta potential and particle size of the SC increased significantly. For both parameters, Sample 7 have relatively small changes, which are indicative of better thermal stability. During storage at high temperatures, the thermal movement of the solid particles in the SCs increases, the surface energy increases and the surfactant on the surface becomes desorbed, resulting in aggregation and changes in Zeta potential. The small ratio of change in sample 7 indicates that the interaction between AE9P-, SD-816 and tebuconazole is strong and can remain stable at high temperatures and under intense particle thermal motion. Fig. 3b is a “three-stage” thixotropic test of the SCs. Each sample has a high viscosity at a shear rate of 0.25 s−1 in 25 s, and low viscosity at 25–35 s at a high shear rate of 1000 s−1. The viscosity increases at a low shear rate of 0.25 s−1 within 35–60 s [46]. The shear recovery ratios are shown in Fig. 3 c. As can be seen, the thixotropic stability of sample 2 is weak, while that of other samples with additional AEnP-K is great, and sample 7 shows the best thixotropic stability. In fact, the viscosity of SCs is mainly provided by xanthan gum, which can form a three-dimensional network structure in water. The solid particles have a large number of exposed hydroxyl groups on their surface, which can form hydrogen bonding interactions with xanthan gum and enhance the stability of SCs. The 3D network is “damaged” under high-speed shear, accounting for the decrease of the viscosity [27]. When the shear rate decreases, the network recovers spontaneously and the viscosity rises. The long EO chain of AE9P- makes it easy for the phosphate group to stretch freely, facilitating the rapid formation of xanthan gum hydrogen bonds, anchoring the solid particles to the xanthan gum fiber network and maintaining good stability. The polar groups of the samples without AEP are directly attached to the alkyl chains, driven by hydrophobic interactions, and tend to be adsorbed on the surface of the tebuconazole particles, which is not conducive to the rapid adjustment of the polar groups to the correct orientation for the formation of hydrogen bonds, showing low thixotropic stability [47]."
12,Application of the SCs,"3.4 Application of the SCs Based on the excellent performance of Sample 7, it was used as the main object of applied research. Sample 2 without AE9P-K was used as a control to investigate whether the addition of AE9P-K would improve the application properties of tebuconazole suspensions. In all the tests, the pesticide formulation was diluted to 5% beforehand. 3.4.1 Wettability The well spreading of a pesticide on the leaves of plants is a prerequisite for its application, which will be determined by the wettability of the pesticide on the leaves of plants [48]. Fig. 4 shows the contact angles of diluted sample 7 and sample 2 as well as water on the leaves of three typical plants. One can see that sample 7 exhibits the smallest contact angles in all cases, indicating the best wettability. 3.4.2 Atomization Fig. 5 is a photomicrograph of the liquid sprayed on the glass slide. The diluent of sample 7 was sprayed to form smaller droplets after spraying. Since the excellent wettability, small droplets can be quickly on the glass, forming large irregular droplets. After spraying the diluent of sample 6, the size of the droplets was smaller, but the droplets could not spread quickly on the glass, and the tebuconazole particles were seriously aggregated at the air-water-glass three-phase interface, which was not conducive to the spreading process of pesticides. The dilution liquid spray of sample 7 has many small-sized droplets, which means that more gas-liquid interfaces are quickly formed during atomization, and the atomization effect is better."
13,Conclusions,"In summary, the surface activities of AEnP-K are determined. It was found that a larger EO addition number n is unfavorable to the reduction of surface tension, but can bring a larger diffusion coefficient (Dt→0) of AEnP-K. The synergistic interaction between surfactants raises the zeta potential of the system, and the hydration of AEnP-K and the molecular structure of SD-816 combine to increase the spatial resistance between the solid particles. Thus, Adding AEnP-K to the tebuconazole suspension is beneficial to increase the stability of SCs, resulting in small average particle size and a high Zeta potential. The stability of the SCs comes from a synergetic effect of electrostatic repulsion, steric hindrance among the solid particles. The high stability of SCs facilitates the storage and transport of SCs. Furthermore, the addition of AEnP-K was beneficial to the atomization and wetting process of the SC diluent, and increase the utilization of pesticides. This manuscript confirms the beneficial effects of combining AEnP-K with SD-816 in SCs. Among the tested candidates, AE9P-K shows the best performance and thus is recommended for practical use."
