0,Introduction,"Hydrogen (H2) seems to appear as the futurible, clean and sustainable energy carrier [1] used directly as a fuel in internal combustion engines or, indirectly, to supply electricity through the use of fuel cells. However, the hydrogen produced could be clean and sustainable [2] only if it is derived from renewable sources. Different interesting routes and sources for renewable hydrogen production have been studied in the last years [3], such as water splitting, biomass gasification, reforming of biomass derived hydrocarbons or alcohols, among others. Bio-ethanol, easily produced by fermentation of biomass residues, is one of the most interesting H-containing molecules derived from biomass [4,5]. Nowadays, the steam reforming process is the most usual method to produce hydrogen from ethanol (Eq. (1)) [3,6,7]. (1) CH3CH2OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2, ΔH298K° = 174 kJ mol−1 However, partial oxidation (Eq. (2)) [4,7] and its combination with the ethanol steam reforming through oxidative reforming processes (Eq. (3)) [1,3,5,7] are also used to produce hydrogen from ethanol. (2) CH3CH2OH + 1.5O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2, ΔH298K° = −545.2 kJ mol−1 (3) CH3CH2OH + 1.5O2 + 2H2O → 2CO2 + 5H2, ΔH298K° = −50 kJ mol−1 Among these processes, the oxidative steam reforming reaction (Eq. (3)) combines the advantages of both processes: the high H2 selectivity of the steam reforming, with the exothermic conditions and the rapid response of the partial oxidation [1,8–10]. Moreover, the oxidative reforming reduces the rate of carbon deposition over catalysts, because the inclusion of oxygen into the feed suppresses the formation of filamentous carbon on catalyst particles [9]. The catalysts used in oxidative reforming must show high thermal stability, due to the relative high operation temperatures (823–1073 K) at which reforming reactions take place, as well as high selectivity to the hydrogen production, avoiding the formation of undesired products such as acetaldehyde, diethyl ether, acetic acid or ethylene. Considering the influence of the nature the active sites and/or the environment of these sites on catalyst performance [10], the design of the active sites is a key requirement to develop supported catalysts that fulfill the above requirements. The catalytic properties of supported transition metals of the groups 8, 9 and 10 for hydrogen production from ethanol reforming have already been investigated in the last years [3,10]. The studies concluded that several supported noble metals such as Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru or Rh [7,11], or inexpensive metals such as Co [12–14], Ni [9,14,15], Cu [16] or bimetallic materials [16–18] are good options to catalyze the EtOH steam reforming. Thereby, supports such as: MgO, ZnO, SiO2, Al2O3, La2O3 or CeO2, among others, are the most commonly used to support the active metals [9,12,19]. The order of activity and H2 selectivity depends on the properties of the active metal, the support of the active metal and the conditions of the reaction, among other variables. Accordingly, non-expensive active metals and supports with non-acid character are considered the best option due to: (i), the delay of coke deposition, decreasing the surface poisoning [11,12,19,20]; and (ii), the promotion of the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde reaction [13]. On the other hand, the stabilization of active metals can allow to increase the reaction temperature and at the same time: (i), it avoids metal sintering, and (ii), increases the hydrogen selectivity. Thus, the incorporation of the active metals into a mixed oxide matrix may be a strategy to stabilize the metal active centre. One kind of mixed oxides able to stabilize metals into their structure includes the oxides derived from the so-called hydrotalcite-like compounds, also known as layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [21]. LDHs are a family of lamellar materials derived from brucite layers, which are currently of intense academic and industrial interest [21–24]. The general formula may be expressed as: [M(1−x) 2+ M x 3+ (OH)2]·[An−] x/n·m H2O; where M2+ and M3+ can be any divalent and trivalent metal cations capable of occupying the octahedral interstices of a brucite-like sheet by partial substitution of magnesium. An− is an exchange anion positioned in the gallery between the layers in order to balance the positive charge of the layers [21]. Upon heating, these highly ordered LDHs form an amorphous mixture of metal oxides-M2+M3+(O)-with small crystal size and high thermal stability and are named hereafter as ex-LDH. These ex-LDH systems show interesting properties, such as high dispersion of the active metals, high specific surface areas [6,21,25], high interaction between different cations in the oxide matrix [26], “memory effect” [21] or controllable acid/basic character [21,24], which can control coke deposition in the EtOH reforming reaction [27]. Moreover, ex-LDH oxides form small and thermally stable metallic crystallites upon reduction conditions [23,28]. Thereby, some studies of hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming using Ni-hydrotalcite derived catalysts have been carried out [6,18,23,29]. Busca et al. tested Ni and Co derived LDH catalysts with Zn as modifying cation in the ethanol reforming reaction [18]. From this study, the Co ex-LDH catalyst was the most active catalyst at lower temperature, while the Ni ex-LDH counterpart showed the highest resistance to deactivation by coke-formation, showing both active metals similar H2 selectivity [18]. Likewise, Mg [6,23,29] and Zn [6,18] are the most usual modifying cations added into the matrix of the ex-LDH catalysts used in the ethanol steam reforming reaction. Within this research context, the aim of this study is to compare the catalytic behaviour of the Co-, Ni- and Cu-catalysts derived from hydrotalcite-like compounds (ex-LDHs) in the hydrogen production by oxidative steam reforming of ethanol. The influence of the presence of Mg and Zn in the hydrotalcite formulation on the physical–chemical properties of the catalysts and on their performance in the ethanol steam reforming reaction has been also studied. Thus, careful investigation of the structures and properties of the catalysts was performed in an attempt to understand the relationship between activity and their structural and surface characteristics, which allows us to determine the best chemical composition or formulation of the ex-LDH catalysts in order to maximize the quantity of hydrogen in the reforming reaction."
1,Experimental,
2,Precursors and catalysts preparation,"2.1 Precursors and catalysts preparation Five layered double hydroxide (LDHs) precursors described in this study were prepared following the co-precipitation with urea method [30]. Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich. The aqueous solutions (0.5 M) containing appropriate amounts of the corresponding chloride salts of Co, Ni or Cu (as active metal), Mg or Zn (as modifying divalent cations, M m 2+), and Al (as trivalent cation), with a cations molar ratio: ΣM2+/Al3+ = 1.8; and Co2+/M m 2+ = 0.4, were heated in presence of urea as precipitating agent (mol of urea = 3Σ mol of cations). The temperature was controlled to obtain the desired precipitation pH value. The precipitates were aged in suspension at 363 K for 72 h under stirring. The resulting solids were filtered, thoroughly washed with distilled water – until the filtered water pH was around 6 – and dried overnight at 353 K. An additional Co-sample (CoAl-LDH) without divalent modifying cation was prepared using the same method explained above (atomic% Co:Al = 55:45). The three LDH Co-precursors were pink, while Ni and Cu LDH precursors were bluish-green. All precursors contained both, chloride (Cl−) and carbonate (CO3 2−), as charge compensating anions. Table 1 shows the main properties of the LDH-precursors. All the LDH-precursors were subjected to thermal treatments in order to obtain the corresponding ex-LDH oxides. The calcination of the precursors was carried out under a flow of air in a programmed furnace. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 723 K (calcination temperature was determined by TG experiments, see 3.1.3 Thermogravimetry Section) at a rate of 1 K min−1 and the temperature was maintained for 7 h. Table 2 lists calcined ex-LDH precursors and their main characteristic properties."
3,Precursors and catalysts characterization,"2.2 Precursors and catalysts characterization Chemical analysis of hydrotalcite-like precursors (LDHs) and the corresponding oxides (ex-LDHs) were carried out on an ICP–AES Perkin–Elmer Optima 3300 DV equipment. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in a Seifert XRD 3000P diffractometer, using Cu–Kα radiations (λ = 1.54050 Å) and equipped with AT Diffract software. Crystalline phases were identified comparing with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files [31]. The particle size was calculated from the characteristic peaks of the corresponding phase using the Debye–Scherrer equation. Thermogravimetric analysis of the LDH-precursors was carried out in a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyser with a heating rate of 10 K min−1, from room temperature to 1173 K under 250 mL min−1 of 20% vol O2/N2 flow. Specific surface areas of the ex-LDH oxides were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K in a Micromeritics TRISTAR 3000 instrument. Prior to the measurements, samples were degassed by heating overnight at 473 K under vacuum. The BET specific surface areas and the external surface areas were calculated using the BET and t-plot methods, respectively. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analyses were carried out in a Micromeritics 2900 TPD/TPR equipment, using a gas flow of 50 mL min−1 of 5% vol H2/Ar as reducing agent. The samples (20 mg) were heated at 10 K min−1 from room temperature to 1223 K. Calibration of the instrument was carried out with pure CuO (from Merck)."
4,Catalytic activity measurements,"2.3 Catalytic activity measurements Oxidative steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE) was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the temperature range from 848 to 948 K at atmospheric pressure. Activity tests were performed in a 6 mm ID quartz tubular reactor with a coaxially centred thermocouple (1.5 mm OD). The catalysts were diluted with SiC, to avoid adverse thermal effects, at a volume ratio of 3:1 (both in the 0.4–0.5 mm particle size range and selected after preliminary mass transport experiments to minimize diffusional resistances). Therefore, the reactor parameters as reactor diameter, bed length, and catalysts particle size were selected to minimize the diffusional, thermal and wall effects. Prior to reaction, the catalysts were flushed in N2 at 473 K for 1 h, followed by in situ reduction. The reduction pre-treatments were carried out at different temperature of activation for each catalyst (Table 3 ) for 2 h with 50 mL (STP) min−1 of 10% vol H2/N2 mixture (heating rate, 10 K min−1). The reduction temperatures where determined by the TPR analysis (Fig. 4), using the value corresponding to the initial stages of the final reduction peak, except for the case of the Cu-containing catalyst, where the temperature corresponded to the one at the end of the main reduction peaks. The pre-treating gases were flushed from the reactor with N2 before admission of ethanol–oxygen–water–nitrogen reaction mixtures. Ethanol (EtOH) and water were fed independently into the pre-heater by means of a liquid pump (Becton–Dickinson) before mixing with O2/N2 (balance) streams. The gas flows were adjusted in a molar ratio of O2/EtOH/H2O = 0.36/1/2.28, i.e., the EtOH/H2O molar ratio ( n H 2 O / n EtOH ) was 2.28 and the O2/EtOH molar ratio ( n O 2 / n EtOH ) was 0.36. These values correspond to the autothermal conditions, which allow the equilibrium between partial oxidation and EtOH steam reforming reactions (Eq. (4)), as it has been commented in the Introduction Section. (4) CH3CH2OH + 2.28H2O + 0.36O2 → 5.28H2 + 2CO2 The total flow was kept at 120 mL min−1, and a low gas hourly space velocity (GHSV = 14619 h−1) was used. The reaction products were analyzed by a GC on-line with TCD (Varian chromatograph Model Star 3400 CX) equipped with Porapack Q (CO2, C2H6, C2H4, water, acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, acetic acid, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and crotonaldehyde) and molecular sieve 5 A (H2, O2, N2, CO) packed columns connected in series, using He as carrier gas. Activity and selectivities were measured at reaction temperatures from 848 to 948 K, at step of 848–898–948 K, and maintaining the reaction in a pseudo-stationary state for 4 h at each temperature studied. Steady-state values of EtOH conversion (reached when the difference in EtOH conversion between subsequent analyses is lower than ± 2%) are the average of two different analyses taken after 3 h on-stream operation at a given temperature. Activity of the catalysts is shown as EtOH conversion and absolute volume of flow of H2 produced. The products’ distribution is shown as the molar composition of the outlet gas, excluding H2O, ethanol and N2. The theoretical highest H2 production is calculated by Eq. (4). In this case, the maximum molar composition of hydrogen in the outlet stream is 72.5% (5.28 mol of H2 for a total of 7.28 mol produced: H2+CO2). Therefore, we define the relative H 2 selectivity as the relation between the H2 molar composition of the outlet gas with respect to the maximum of 72.5%."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Precursor characterization,"3.1 Precursor characterization 3.1.1 Chemical analysis Table 1 shows the nominal composition and chemical analysis of the HT precursors. As observed, chemical analysis of all LDH-precursors and the corresponding ex-LDH oxides were very close to the nominal values. It is emphasized here that the mother-liquor filtered waters of LDH-precursor preparation were also analyzed to control the small losses of the corresponding cations during the filtration process. The chemical analysis of the Co-LDH precursors shows only traces of Zn and Mg in the mother-liquor filtered waters, while Co remains in the solid structure (differences between nominal composition and chemical analysis in Table 1). In the case of Ni and Cu precursors some loss of Mg is observed during the preparation (Table 1). The reason might be the formation of complexes of Mg2+ with ammonia [32]. Nevertheless, the highest loss was observed in the CuMgAl-LDH in which an important loss of Cu (10%) was detected (Table 1). In fact, the filtered mother-liquor waters of CuMgAl-LDH showed an intense blue color, which suggests the presence of Cu-complex [30], may be as cupric tretamine, in the solution of filtered mother-liquor water. 3.1.2 X-ray diffraction The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of LDH-precursors are shown in Fig. 1 . All precursors show well defined peaks indicative of a highly crystalline structure typical of hydrotalcite-like materials (HT, JCPDS file: 70-2151). This structure crystallizes in the hexagonal system-R3m space group, and exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11°, 24°, 35°, 60° and 62°, corresponding to the sharp and symmetric peaks for the (003), (006), (009), (110) and (113) planes and broad and asymmetric peaks for the (102), (105) and (108) planes, which are characteristic of clay minerals having a layered structure. Nevertheless, the Cu-based precursor (CuMgAl-LDH in Fig. 1e) shows additional peaks around 2θ = 16°, 32° and 40°, assigned to mixed hydroxychloride of Cu–Zn phase (Paratacamite–zincian, P–Z JCPDS file: 25-325) [30]. Comparing the intensity of the reflections of the Co-samples in Fig. 1a–c (CoAl, CoMgAl and CoZnAl), it is observed that the latter one shows the higher crystallinity (in terms of percentage of the material that is crystalline), indicating that Zn as modifying cation favours the crystallization of the HT-phase. Moreover, CoMgAl shows better HT crystallization than CoAl, as it can be seen in the magnification of the Fig. 1a. In the case of the CoMgAl, NiMgAl and CuMgAl samples, the presence of cobalt offers the best crystallinity, among the three divalent active metal ions studied (see the magnification in Fig. 1d and e regarding Fig. 1c). The order in the crystallinity of the samples was in the sequence: CoMgAl > NiMgAl > CuMgAl. The peaks in the diffraction pattern of CuMgAl precursor were relatively broad especially for higher order reflections, which is indicative of the Cu-incompatibility in a regular octahedral network of hydrotalcite lattice, which is accounted for the Jahn–Teller distortion of Cu2+ in octahedral coordination [30]. However, since CuMgAl precursor has a Cu2+/Mg2+ ratio <1, it is likely that Cu2+ incorporates into the HT-phase network [17,21]. The unit cell parameters “a” and “c”, for each hydrotalcite structure, were calculated from the XRD patterns using d(110) and d(003) spacings, since a = 2d(110) and c = 3d(003) [33]. The unit cell values for each LDH are summarized in Table 1. The parameter “a” is linked to the cation–cation distance within the brucite-like layer while the parameter “c” gives the combined thickness of the brucite-like layer and the interlamellar space. The experimental “a” unit cell parameter in Table 1 shows two different values. The CoAl and CoZnAl precursors have the “a” unit cell parameter close to that of the natural hydrotalcite one (3.05 Å) [21], while the rest of the LDH-precursors present higher values for the “a” cell parameter. The observed variations in the “a” values of the HT-phases are consequence of the variation in the ionic radii of the bivalent metal ions [34] inserted in the layered structure. On the contrary, the “c” parameter, which reflects the Coulomb forces between layer and interlayer, shows similar values for all precursors suggesting a similar extent of electrostatic interaction irrespective of the nature of the co-bivalent metal ions inserted in the LDH structure. 3.1.3 Thermogravimetry (TG) Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses can provide a measure of the thermal stability of the LDH-precursors necessary to determine the temperature at which the LDH-precursors are decomposed to form the ex-LDH oxides. Fig. 2 shows the weight losses of all LDH-precursors (TG) and the corresponding derivative curves (DvTG) as a function of the temperature. The values of the main losses produced during the LDH decompositions are shown in Table 2. Net weight losses were close to 35% wt for the five samples, typical of these precursors [33,35]. Up to six weight losses are observed in the decomposition of the LDH-precursors (Fig. 2). The first loss (peak-1) is a broad band clearly visible in CuMgAl and NiMgAl samples (Fig. 2d and e), which appears at temperatures below 373 K, and that can be attributed to the loss of non-structural water physisorbed on the external surface of the LDH crystallites [33,35]. From 398 to 513 K (peak-2 and 3), the observed weight losses can be associated to water differently bonded to the structure such as interlayer water co-intercalated with carbonate or chemisorbed water, among others [35]. The dehydroxylation and decarbonation of the LDH materials occur from 548 to 723 K (peak-4 and 5) and overlap the decomposition of the P–Z phase in the CuMgAl-LDH sample [30]. These three processes are produced simultaneously, which does not allow to differentiate between dehydroxylation and decarbonation [33,35]. The simultaneous dehydroxylation and decarbonation processes can be produced at different temperatures, depending on the cation to which the carbonate or the hydroxyl is bound [35]. The observed loss at 673 K of CuMgAl (Fig. 2e) and CoMgAl (Fig. 2c) samples and the shoulder in NiMgAl sample (Fig. 2d), can be associated to the elimination of the carbonate and/or the hydroxyl bound to magnesium, which is presented in the three LDH materials. The weight loss at a temperature higher than 773 K (peak-6) observed in the CuMgAl sample is due to the simultaneous elimination of chloride anions and the total decomposition of the P–Z phase [36]. Thereby, the low weight loss above 773 K observed for Co- and NiMgAl-LDHs seems to indicate the low concentration of chloride anions in these samples. When Zn is used as modifying cation, the chloride content increases (see peak-6 in Table 2), while the decarbonation loss (peak-4 and 5) decreases for this sample, which could indicate that a part of the compensating chloride anions are not replaced with carbonate anions during the LDH preparation of CoZnAl, as it occurs in Mg–LDHs (Table 2). In summary, the calcination treatment at 723 K guarantees the elimination of compensating anions, except for chloride anions, and the formation of corresponding oxides. An exception is the CuMgAl-LDH, in which the P–Z phase is partially decomposed at 723 K; however, as the total decomposition of P–Z phase would be above 1033 K, to avoid the loss of some of the catalyst properties, the calcination treatment was carried out at 723 K for all samples. Nevertheless, the calcination of CuZnAl-LDHs precursors at 723 K, produces the total formation of the oxides, although P–Z phase was not totally decomposed [30]."
7,Calcined precursors characterization,"3.2 Calcined precursors characterization 3.2.1 X-ray diffraction The ex-LDH oxides were obtained by calcination at 723 K of the corresponding LDH-precursors. XRD patterns of the ex-LDH oxides are shown in Fig. 3 . Calcination of the LDH-precursors leads to the destruction of the layered LDH network (Fig. 3 with regard to Fig. 1), giving rise to the characteristic diffuse signals corresponding to amorphous components and the formation of some simple oxides and spinels, depending on the chemical composition of the LDH-precursor. Thus, the formation of Co-spinel phase (Co3O4, JCPDS: 80-1545) is observed in all Co-samples (Fig. 3a–c), while the Co single oxides, CoO or Co2O3, are not detected in the Co ex-LDH samples. The formation of the crystalline Co-spinel could be explained as a segregation of Co out of the ex-LDH matrix [33]. Traces of the crystalline simple oxides of the corresponding modifying cations, ZnO and MgO, appear in CoZnAl (Fig. 3b) and CoMgAl (Fig. 3c) samples, respectively. The high loading of modifying cations (Table 1) should produce well defined peaks of the corresponding simple oxides, thus the almost absence of ZnO and MgO crystalline phases could indicate the complete incorporation of the modifying cations into amorphous oxide phases. The comparison of the three ex-LDH oxides with Mg as modifying cation allows studying the influence of the presence of Co, Ni or Cu in the formation of the oxides after calcination. The CoMgAl (Fig. 3c), NiMgAl (Fig. 3d) and CuMgAl (Fig. 3e) ex-LDH samples show the formation of the Co-spinel phase, NiO phase and CuAl-spinel phase, respectively. The CuMgAl sample also shows traces of tenorite–CuO phase, together with the main CuAl-spinel phase. Crystalline particle sizes calculated by the characteristic peaks of each phase using the Debye–Scherrer equation of the ex-LDH oxides are summarized in Table 2. From the analysis of the particle sizes of the segregated Co-, Ni- and Cu-oxides (Table 2), it seems that there exists a relation between the high crystallinity of the corresponding LDH-precursor (Fig. 1) and the small size of the particles segregated oxide phases (Table 2). Thereby, CoMgAl-LDH, which shows the highest LDH crystallinity (Fig. 1c), is the sample with the smallest crystal size of the corresponding oxide (Table 2). In the same line, the sample with the highest particle size (CuMgAl ex-LDH) was the sample which showed the lowest crystallinity of its corresponding LDH-precursor (Fig. 1e). From the results derived from the Mg-containing precursors it could be inferred that the crystal size of the segregate oxide decreases when the crystallinity of the LDH-precursor increases. Accordingly, the active divalent cation, outside of the HT structure, could form upon calcination the corresponding segregated oxides or spinels with a very small particle size, while Zn2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ could produce amorphous oxide phases [33]. On the other hand, CoAl ex-LDH sample does not show a large particle size, regarding its high Co-loading (three times more Co than CoZnAl and CoMgAl samples, see Table 1). Therefore, it seems that the CoAl sample displays a higher Co-exposure than the CoMgAl and CoZnAl ex-LDH ones, due to its higher metallic loading. 3.2.2 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms The textural properties (BET and external specific surface areas) of the ex-LDH oxides have been calculated from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms recorded at 77 K (isotherms not-shown here), and they are summarized in Table 2. All isotherms of the ex-LDHs were type IV, according to the IUPAC classification. The isotherms exhibit slight adsorption at low relative pressure due to the presence of micropores. All ex-LDH isotherms show a sharp increase at high relative pressure originated from interparticle porosity, which seems to indicate that ex-LDHs consist mainly of non-porous nanoparticles within the nanometer range. The high meso, macro and external specific surface area values show the non-microporous nanoparticle nature of the ex-LDH materials. Ex-LDH oxides formed after calcination exhibit high specific surface area values (Table 2), taking into account their bulk nature. The calcined samples with Mg as modifying cation show the highest specific surface area among the measured samples. 3.2.3 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) Fig. 4 shows the TPR-profiles of the ex-LDH oxides. All Co-containing samples (CoAl, CoZnAl and CoMgAl) present two reduction peaks. The two reduction peaks of Co ex-LDHs withCo3O4-phase are assigned: (i), peak-1, at ca. 700 K, to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+, and (ii), peak-2, at 880–930 K, to the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 [14,37]. Nevertheless, CoAl ex-LDH TPR profile shows certain heterogeneity suggested by the shoulder at 784 K and the tail at 1038 K. This heterogeneity can be caused by the higher Co-loading in the CoAl ex-LDH (Table 1). The reduction temperature of the supported Co3O4 phase reported in literature, including when Co is supported on MgO [14], is lower than that obtained for the Co-containing ex-LDH samples shown in this work (Table 2). The high reduction temperature measured in both peaks in the Co ex-LDHs indicates a higher interaction between Co2+/3+ ions and (Zn2+ or Mg2+)-Al3+ amorphous matrix. This strong interaction can be favoured by the low particle size of the Co spinel, which allows a high dispersion and a close contact of these crystalline phases (Fig. 3) with the amorphous (Zn or Mg)-Al oxide. On the other hand, the presence of Zn in the structure decreases the reduction temperature of the peak at high temperature, peak-2 (Table 2), while the incorporation of Mg increases the reduction temperature of this peak-2. Both facts suggest a close interaction between the modifying cations (Zn2+ or Mg2+) in the amorphous phase and the Co2+ ion [37]. The NiMgAl ex-LDH sample shows a broad reduction peak from 773 to 1123 K. This reduction profile is far from that corresponding to bulk NiO (that reduces at 653 K) and it is indicative of a strong interaction between Ni2+ ions with the Mg2+–Al3+ oxide matrix, including the Ni-incorporation into the Mg–Al matrix [27]. The non-symmetrical shape of the broad Ni reduction peak suggests heterogeneous environments for Ni2+, which involves different types of the Ni2+–Mg2+ and Ni2+–Al3+ interactions. A complex TPR profile was obtained for CuMgAl ex-LDH sample, which is formed by a narrow peak at 510 K with a shoulder at 528 K, a broad peak at 593 K and a small peak at 843 K (Fig. 4). From this reduction behaviour at least four different Cu2+ environments can be found. This fact contrasts with the simple CuMgAl ex-LDH XRD pattern (Fig. 3e), in which a main Cu-spinel crystalline phase with traces of tenorite–CuO phase were only observed. The reduction peak at 510 K could be assigned to the reduction of Cu2+ cations in tenorite–CuO phase, since the pure bulk CuO reduces close to this temperature [25,30]. The reduction peak at 593 K can be attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ in the CuAl2O4 mixed oxide (Fig. 3e) or in non-stoichiometric copper aluminate phases. From the hydrogen consumption corresponding to this peak, which is similar to that of the peak at 510 K (Fig. 4), it could be inferred that most of the CuO phase is amorphous and cannot be detected by XRD (Fig. 3e). The H2 consumption peak at 843 K is likely due to reduction of copper in the spinel phases as Cu1−x Mg x Al2O4 phases [30]. In summary, the reducibility of oxide precursors follows the order: CuMgAl > CoZnAl > CoAl > CoMgAl > NiMgAl. The temperature of the reduction used in the activation process of the samples done before the oxidative reforming of ethanol was selected taking into account the above differences in reducibility observed in the samples, using a reduction temperature close to the temperature corresponding to the start of the final reduction peak, except for the case of CuMgAl catalyst, where the temperature was the one corresponding to the end of the main reduction peaks (Table 3). On the other hand, a strong interaction between the active metal oxides (Co- and Ni) and the amorphous (not detectable by XRD) (Mg or Zn)-Al oxide phases have been indirectly detected by the high reduction temperatures of the active cations."
8,Catalytic activity,"3.3 Catalytic activity All ex-LDH catalysts were active in the oxidative reforming of ethanol performed at 848, 898 and 948 K. Table 3 shows the main catalytic results obtained with the five ex-LDH catalysts. The Co- and Ni-catalysts exhibited a complete and stable conversion of ethanol in the temperature range (Table 3). The sample CuMgAl shows lower activity achieving 67 and 71% of EtOH conversion at 848 and 898 K, respectively. The exceptional catalytic performance of CuMgAl ex-LDH will be commented below. The main products of the reaction over CoAl, CoZnAl, CoMgAl and NiMgAl catalysts were H2 and CO2 with a minor formation of CH4 and CO (Table 3). CoAl, CoMgAl and NiMgAl do not produce any measurable amount of other by-products. The CoZnAl catalyst produces, at 848 K, low quantities (<1% molar) of C2 and C4 by-products (Table 3), such as ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and crotonaldehyde (CH3CHCHCHO). The low formation of C2 and C4 by-products observed in these four catalysts (CoAl, CoZnAl, CoMgAl and NiMgAl) is indicative of the high activity of the catalysts for the C–C bond cleavage. The product distribution, expressed as the molar composition in the reformed gases over the four most active catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 at the three studied reaction temperature stages: 848 (Fig. 5a), 898 (Fig. 5b) and 948 K (Fig. 5c). It can be noticed that hydrogen is the main reaction product in the outlet gas over any of the four most active catalysts in all temperature range, obviously, with a concomitant high CO2 production. When increasing the temperature from 848 to 948 K, the CO concentration in the outlet gas increases. It is probably due to the participation of the CH4 reforming at a larger extent, which is favoured at high temperature, and a concomitant increase in the production of H2 and CO is produced. Therefore, the H2 production is determined by dehydrogenation–decomposition ethanol reaction together with a consecutive CH4 reforming. In this sense, Fig. 6 shows the H2 production rates over CoAl, CoMgAl, CoZnAl and NiMgAl catalysts. From these results the hydrogen production capacity of the catalysts at low temperature (848 K) decreases following the sequence: CoZnAl > CoMgAl > CoAl > NiMgAl. At higher temperatures, the sequence is maintained with the exception of CoZnAl catalyst that shows some deactivation, as is derived from the decrease in the relative amount of the H2 produced with the raise in temperature observed in Fig. 6. The differences in the H2 production with the raise in temperature are obvious to study the relative H 2 selectivity (Table 3), which was calculated with Eq. (4) (defined in the Experimental Section). For all catalysts, the relative H 2 selectivity increases with the temperature, reaching values close to 90%. However, to increase the temperature from 848 to 948 K, the relative H 2 selectivity of CoZnAl increases in 2%, while CoAl or CoMgAl increase in 10 and 8%, respectively. This increase in H2 production is related to CH4 reforming capacity. CoZnAl catalyst produces the lowest amount of CH4 (and the highest CO production) and the highest H2 production at 848 K (Table 3). Nevertheless, at higher temperature (948 K) there is a higher capacity of CoMgAl and CoAl samples to catalyze the CH4 reforming (CH4 concentration decrease and CO concentration increase) than the CoZnAl-counterpart. Two alternative explanations can be argued. The first one is related to the different basicity/acidity of the (Zn or Mg)-Al matrix in the catalysts. CoZnAl ex-LDH catalyst keeps chloride compensating anions on its surface (see Thermogravimetry Section). This residual Cl− anions have not been removed during any different thermal treatments used with this material, neither the LDH-precursor calcination treatment to obtain the ex-LDH oxide, nor the reducing pretreatment to obtain the catalyst, since the temperature required to remove these residual anions is higher (above 970 K, Fig. 2) than that employed in both treatments (both at 723 K as indicated in the Experimental Section and Table 3, respectively). Thus, Cl− anions presence makes the CoZnAl catalyst surface more acid than the CoMgAl and CoAl ones. The higher basicity of the surface of the CoMgAl and CoAl catalysts favours the CH4 reforming (a decrease the CH4 concentration and an increase of the CO one), which requires higher temperature (948 K) to carry out, respect to the capacity to reform this molecule observed for the CoZnAl catalyst, i.e. it can be noticed the CH4 decrease with CoZnAl is lower than the CoMgAl and CoAl ones. On the other hand, the differences in the Co2+ cation reducibility, previously observed by TPR (Fig. 4), could also explain the differences in the catalytic performance of the samples in the temperature range studied. The highest reaction temperature (948 K) is close to the temperatures at which the peak-2 (corresponding to Co2+ reduction) is observed for the three Co ex-LDH samples (from 874 to 929 K in the Table 2). Likewise, it is possible that changes in the oxidation state of Co under reaction at high temperature could be involved in the different behaviour of the catalysts at these temperatures. Thereby, it seems that the differences in stability of the Co2+ species under reaction conditions and related with the close interaction with the amorphous oxide phase, in such a way that the close interaction of Co2+ ions with Zn2+ (Fig. 4), may also justify the observed catalytic behaviour of the samples at high reaction temperatures. Regarding the influence of the active metal (Co or Ni), it appears that CoMgAl catalyst is slightly more active than the Ni counterpart, i.e., the Ni-catalyst requires higher temperature to reach the same conversion level as the Co-ones, as other authors have previously observed [16,21]. In order to compare the selectivity to the rest of the reaction products, Fig. 7 plots the molar percentage of CH4 (Fig. 7a), CO2 (Fig. 7b) and CO (Fig. 7c) as a function of the hydrogen production over the CoZnAl, CoMgAl, CoAl and NiMgAl ex-LDH catalysts. It is observed that all Co-containing catalysts show a similar behaviour in the production of CH4, CO and CO2. On the other hand, the NiMgAl catalyst showed a slightly different behaviour compared to Co-counterparts, presenting a lower CH4 and CO2 production and a concomitant higher CO production. This fact indicates the higher CH4 reforming capacity of the Ni species compared with Co-counterparts in line with previous works published in literature [3,18,30], although, its catalytic activity in the EtOH decomposition is lower than Co-ones, due to the fact that Ni ex-LDH requires a higher temperature to reach the same H2 production levels as the Co-ones. In order to determine the participation of the different processes during the reaction, the (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratio was calculated. This ratio could be used as an indication of the relative participation of the reforming processes with respect to the total oxidation process because our reaction conditions involve oxygen as reactant in the inlet gases. In this way, if only oxidative reforming process were carried out, the (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratio would be 2.64, in accordance with Eq. (4). On the contrary, when the total oxidation process increases its participation, the (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratio reaches values lower than 2.64. The experimental (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratios obtained for all ex-LDH catalysts at 848, 898 and 948 K are summarized in Table 3. It can be observed that the (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratio for most catalysts show values below 2.64, i.e. most of the catalysts favour the reforming processes, and consequently the H2 production. Only CoAl and NiMgAl at the lowest temperature (848 K) show (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratios lower than 2.64, indicating that part of the EtOH consumed with both catalysts at 848 K do not produce hydrogen, because part of EtOH is burnt. The (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratios increase when the temperature increases at 898 and 948 K. At temperatures above 848 K, the (H2 + CO)/CO2 ratio values increase to above 2.64. Thus, the temperature increase favours the EtOH and CH4 reforming and the EtOH decomposition processes, with respect to the total oxidation process. On the other hand, different amounts of coke were detected on the different used catalysts (Table 3). As expected, the Ni-catalyst produced larger amount of coke, since Ni favours the polimerization of the carbonaceous residues. The Co-catalysts show different amounts of coke on their surface, following the decreasing order of coke produced: CoZnAl > CoAl > CoMgAl. The sequence in carbon formation follows the same order than the sequence of catalysts acidity. Therefore, it seems that the acidity of the catalyst surface could favour the formation of carbon deposits. This acidity in CoZnAl ex-LDH catalyst is produced by residual chloride anions (see Thermogravimetry Section). An exception to all that has been discussed above is the performance of CuMgAl ex-LDH catalyst observed under the reaction conditions chosen for this work. Fig. 8 shows the product distribution, the EtOH conversion and the relative H 2 selectivity of all five ex-LDH catalysts at 898 K, in order to compare the behaviour of the Cu-catalyst with the Co- and Ni-ones, previously analyzed. As indicated before, the EtOH conversion on the CuMgAl catalyst is not complete at 898 K (Table 3). The main product obtained with CuMgAl catalyst was CO (31%) along with CH4 (23%), acetaldehyde (19%) and H2 (18%). These results seem to indicate that CuMgAl ex-LDH catalyst is less selective to hydrogen production than the Co- and Ni-ones, due to the low capacity of Cu to cause the C–C bond cleavage. These evidences cast doubt on the use of this CuMgAl ex-LDH catalyst for the oxidative steam reforming of EtOH in reaction conditions chosen in this work, as it happened in the case of ethanol steam reforming reaction published previously [16]. In summary, the five ex-LDH catalysts studied are active in the EtOH oxidative steam reforming reaction. CoZnAl, CoMgAl, CoAl and NiMgAl reach complete EtOH conversion which is maintained stable in time for all the temperatures studied. At moderate temperature (848 K), CoZnAl catalyst shows the highest H2 production and consequently the highest H2 selectivity, while at higher temperature (898 K) CoMgAl and CoAl are the most active catalysts in the H2 production. It seems that NiMgAl ex-LDH is more selective to H2 production than the Co-catalysts, although the Ni-catalyst requires more temperature to reach the same H2 production levels that the Co-ones reach at lower temperatures. The high H2 conversion level can be reached because the reaction temperatures were appropriate. In general, these high reaction temperatures can be studied due to the high stabilization and dispersion of small particles of the active metal oxides into the ex-LDH amorphous oxide network. Thus, these results prove that all Co- and Ni-catalysts are very selective to hydrogen production in the chosen reaction conditions."
9,Conclusions,"The results obtained in this study show that the catalysts obtained from ex-LDH like precursors are good systems to produce hydrogen from the oxidative steam reforming of EtOH. The high crystallinity of the LDH-precursors obtained through the urea method guarantees the formation of oxides of very small particle size, in a strong interaction with the (Zn or Mg)-Al oxide matrix, as it was confirmed by TPR by the high reduction temperatures needed to reduce the active metals of the ex-LDHs obtained. This strong interaction between active metals and oxide matrix stabilizes the active metals. The use of chloride anions as compensating anions in the LDH structure seems to affect neither the ex-LDH oxide formation nor the active metal stabilization. Summarizing the ex-LDHs’ catalytic performance, the five ex-LDH catalysts studied in this work were active in the oxidative steam reforming of EtOH. However, four of the five catalysts reached the total EtOH conversion (CoZnAl, CoMgAl, CoAl and NiMgAl), while CuMgAl showed a lower catalytic activity and a lower selectivity to H2 production. Co- and Ni-catalysts show a similar performance in this reaction, although, there are slight differences between the Co- and Ni ex-LDHs’ catalytic behaviour. Thus, Co-catalyst reached a higher H2 production level at lower temperatures compared to the Ni-one. Consequently, higher H2 selectivities can be achieved by the Co-catalyst, which seems to be due to the higher EtOH reforming capacity of the Co-catalyst, while Ni species show higher CH4 reforming capacity, which requires higher reaction temperatures. At lower temperature (848 K), the best catalyst for hydrogen production is CoZnAl, in which the Zn presence increases the reducibility of Co2+. This seems to be the cause of the higher H2 selectivity with CoZnAl at lower temperature. When temperature is increased, the lower cobalt stabilization into the Zn–Al matrix slows down in the H2 production. On the contrary, the high cobalt stabilization in the matrix of the CoMgAl and CoAl ex-LDH samples increases the H2 production."
