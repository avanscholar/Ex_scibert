0,Introduction,"Hydrogen is recognized as a clean fuel and energy carrier and will play an important role in the future global economy. In particular, its production is an attractive subject of current interest for fuel cell applications [1,2], which are considered to have the potential to provide a clean energy source for automobile as an alternative to gasoline or diesel engines. Hydrogen is also one of most important chemicals and is widely used for ammonia production, oil refineries, and methanol production, etc. Currently, main processes for producing commercial hydrogen are catalytic steam reforming of natural gas and oil-derived naphtha, partial oxidation of heavy oils, gasification of coal as well as electrolysis of water [1–3]. In view of growing environmental concerns such as global warming and the depletion of fossil fuel, major efforts are being dedicated to develop the utilization of renewable energy sources. Real environmental benefits will be linked to the ability to produce hydrogen from renewable sources with no net production of greenhouse gas such as CO2 [4]. Biomass has been proposed as an alternative to produce hydrogen, because this renewable rich resource does not contribute to a net increase in atmospheric CO2 [5]. There are different routes proposed for biomass conversion into hydrogen-rich gas or pure hydrogen, mainly including thermochemical conversion, bio-chemical/biological conversion and mechanical extraction [6]. For production of hydrogen by thermochemical conversion, several technologies such as biomass gasification (including the gasification of biomass-derived char) [7–11], biomass catalytic pyrolysis [12] have been widely explored. Besides, steam reforming of pyrolysis oil (i.e., bio-oil), which is typically produced via the process of biomass pyrolysis, is one of the promising routes of hydrogen production from biomass [13]. Biomass fast pyrolysis technology for bio-oil production has been extensively researched these years, and it has also been well reviewed previously [14–17], which is a thermal decomposition process that converts biomass into organic liquids (i.e., the bio-oil) with yields as high as 75–80% (including water) based on the original biomass weight by fast heating the biomass in the absence of air at around 400–600°C [15]. Bio-oil is a dark-brown organic liquid and contains a large number of complex compounds such as acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, substituted phenolics and other oxygenates derived from biomass carbohydrates and lignin [18]. The distribution of these compounds depends on the type of biomass used and the pyrolysis process conditions (carrier gas, temperature, residence time, and heating rate, etc.) [19]. The oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil can be simply described as a chemical formula of C n H m O k , and the steam reforming of the bio-oil proceeds according to the following stoichiometric reactions [13]: (1) C n H m O k + ( n − k ) H 2 O = n CO + ( n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 and the following water–gas shift (WGS) of (2) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 Thus, the overall steam reforming reaction can be given by (3) C n H m O k + ( 2 n − k ) H 2 O = n CO 2 + ( 2 n + m / 2 − k ) H 2 According to Eq. (3), the stoichiometric maximum yield of hydrogen (corresponding to the complete conversion of organic carbon to CO2) equals 2 n + m / 2 − k moles per n mole of carbon in the feed material. Thermal decomposition of the organic compounds contained in the bio-oil as well as the Boudouard reaction may simultaneously occur during the reforming process, which can be respectively described as following [20]: (4) C n H m O k → C x H y O z + gas ( H 2 , CO , CO 2 , CH 4 , … ) + coke (5) 2 CO → CO 2 + C Though the bio-oil represents another potential source of renewable chemicals, there are still some technical bottlenecks for efficient production of hydrogen from the steam reforming of the crude bio-oil. The crude oil contains substantial amounts of water-insoluble materials (∼50wt.%) [13], such as lignin-derived oligomeric phenolics etc., which are generally difficult to be reformed. Particularly, these water-insoluble materials easily form carbon deposition (according to Eq. (4)) on the catalyst surface and lead to fast deactivation of catalysts when the crude oil was directly fed into the reforming reactor. So far, extensive works have been focused on the only water-soluble fraction and the volatile fraction of the crude bio-oil [13,21–23]. On the other hand, in order to understand the reforming process of the crude bio-oil, some oxygenated organic compounds (e.g., acetic acid, benzene, ketone and alcohol or their mixtures etc.) were generally used as the models of the oxygenated organic compounds in the bio-oil to investigate the reforming behavior of the bio-oil [5,20,24–35]. But the water-insoluble components and the heavy fraction of the crude bio-oil are missed to be reformed into the hydrogen. Recently, Rioche et al. [20] and Domine et al. [36] have reported the successful application of the crude bio-oil as feedstock for catalytic steam reforming towards hydrogen production, using noble metal-based (Pt/Rh-based) catalysts supported on ceria–zirconia materials. And hydrogen yield of 60–70% was obtained at the temperature of 800–860°C and S/C of ∼10. Davidian et al. [37] proposed a sequential cracking/reforming process and a H2–rich (45–50 vol%) stream was produced on the catalysts of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-K/La2O3-Al2O3. Panigrahi et al. [38] researched into the thermal pyrolysis of the bio-oil in the absence of catalyst and a product gas with low H2 content (9.3–12.3vol%) and very high hydrocarbons content (70.2–84.2 vol%) was obtained at the temperature range of 650–800°C. Moreover, production of hydrogen from crude bio-oil via steam gasification was also investigated. The highest hydrogen concentration of 59.2 vol % was obtained at the temperature of 800°C by Panigrahi et al. [39] and the hydrogen yield of ∼0.65Nm3 H2/kg bio-oil was achieved at the high temperature of 970°C by Bleeker et al. [40]. In our previous work, much attention has been paid to the fast pyrolysis of biomass [41–43], the production of hydrogen or bio-syngas from the volatile fraction of the bio-oil and its model compounds [23,32,44–47] and the synthesis of liquid bio-fuels such as gasoline and diesel etc [44]. A novel electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR) method for efficient production of hydrogen from the volatile fraction of the bio-oil and its compounds was developed in our lab [45–47]. Main aim of this work is to solve the problems remaining in the production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil such as low hydrogen yield and severe deactivation of catalyst. An efficient and promising approach for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil via the integrative gasification-ECR process was proposed and investigated. The NiCuZnAl reforming catalyst was used in the downstream ECR process."
1,Experimental method,
2,Catalyst preparation and characterization,"2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The NiCuZnAl catalyst filled in the downstream reforming fixed bed was prepared by the co-precipitation method with screened Ni:Cu:Zn:Al molar ratio of 2:1:1:4 at a constant pH (9.0±0.2) using respective metal nitrates as precursors and a mixture of NaOH (1M) and Na2CO3 (1M) as precipitants. The precipitate was filtrated and washed to the neutral pH=7 and then dried in an oven at 120°C for 8h, after which it was heated at 2°C/min in air to the final temperature of 450°C and calcined at 450°C for 5h to obtain the desired catalyst. All the catalyst samples in our tests were reduced in situ before use in a hydrogen flow of 50ml/min at 700°C (according to the H2-TPR result in Section 3.5) for 1h. The metallic element contents in the prepared catalyst (NiCuZnAl) were measured by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP/AES, Atom scan Advantage of Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation, USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed to investigate the diffraction structure changes of the catalysts. The fresh and used catalysts are generally crushed into powder with an average diameter of 20–30μm. X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts were recorded on an X'pert Pro Philips diffractrometer, using a Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). The measurement conditions were in the 2θ ranges 10–80°, step counting time 5s, and step size 0.017° at 298K. The surface elements' states were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS measurements were performed on an ESCALAB-250 (Thermo-VG Scientific, USA) spectrometer with Al Kα (1486.6eV) irradiation source. The background pressure of the analytical chamber was 1.0×10−9 Torr. The analyzed surface was 2mm in diameter and the take-off angle of photoelectrons was 90° with respect to sample surface. The H2-TPR experiment was performed in the equipment assembled by ourselves. This apparatus consists of a gas handling system with mass flow controllers, a tubular reactor, a temperature programmer, a PC for data recording, and a furnace to heat the catalyst. Before the run, the sample was treated in the argon with a flow of 30ml/min for 1hour. After that, the sample was subsequently contacted with a 40ml/min flow of 5vol% H2 in Argon and heated at a rate of 10°C/min from 25°C to a final temperature of 750°C. Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector after removing the water formed. The thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Shimadzu DTG-60H instrument to determine the amount of carbon deposition on the catalysts' surface. Each sample was heated to 1000°C with the rate of 10°C/min from room temperature in air."
3,Feedstock,"2.2 Feedstock The crude bio-oil used in this work was produced by the fast pyrolysis of biomass in a circulating fluidized bed with a capacity of 120kg/h of oil at our Lab (Anhui Province Key Laboratory of the Biomass Clean Energy, Hefei, China). The pyrolysis temperature of the biomass (i.e., corn stalk) was about 505°C, which was supplied by the combustion of byproduct of charcoal formed in the bio-oil production process. Some properties of the crude bio-oil are given in Table 1 and the oxygenated organic compounds in it can be represented as an overall chemical formula of CH1.47O0.49·0.38H2O."
4,Reaction system for hydrogen production from crude bio-oil,"2.3 Reaction system for hydrogen production from crude bio-oil As shown in Fig. 1 , the experiments for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil were carried out in a continuous flow gasification-reforming dual fixed-beds system under atmospheric pressure. The whole reaction system was mainly made up of a quartz tube reactor, in which a fixed bed (named as “gasification bed”) filled with quartz sand (50g, 10–16 mesh) was located at the upper position to gasify the crude bio-oil and a lower reforming fixed bed (named as “reforming bed”) filled with 15g NiCuZnAl catalyst (60–80 mesh) was used for the purpose of further reforming all hydrocarbons and the oxygenated organic compounds derived from the primary gasification of the crude bio-oil as well as the un-converted bio-oil (all these substances were called “intermediates” for brief). We performed the integrative gasification-reforming experiments with two modes, i.e., the gasification-common steam reforming (G-CSR) mode and the gasification-electrochemical catalytic reforming (G-ECR) mode. For the G-CSR mode, NiCuZnAl catalyst was filled in the reforming bed, and heated homogeneously by an outside furnace. In the case of the G-ECR mode, an annular Ni–Cr wire (resistance: 15Ω) used for heating the catalyst and providing the thermal electrons onto the catalyst was enwound on a small quartz column and then the quatz column was installed in the reforming bed. The catalyst was uniformly embedded around the Ni–Cr wire, through which a given AC electric current passed. To create certain reforming temperatures, the catalyst was also heated by an outside furnace as compensation or cooled via a circulation-water if necessary. What must be mentioned is that for the G-CSR mode, the Ni–Cr wire was also installed whereas the current was shut off (i.e., I=0A). The reforming temperature and its distribution for both G-CSR and G-ECR modes were firstly measured by several thermocouples inserted into the catalyst bed. The operation procedures of the system were arranged as follows. First, the quartz tube reactor was flushed out by flowing pure N2 and both the gasification bed and reforming bed were respectively heated to the given temperatures. Certain electric current was turn on for only G-ESR mode. Then, the crude bio-oil was continuously fed into the reactor at constant speed using a micro-injection pump and simultaneously the steam from a steam generator was preheated and fed into the reactor. In order to compare the performances of hydrogen production from two different routes, i.e., the steam gasification of the crude bio-oil and the integrative gasification-reforming process, the steam gasification of the crude bio-oil was first carried out in the gasification bed in which the stream (crude bio-oil and steam) only passed through a gasification bed filled with 50g quartz sand (i.e., the reforming bed was free). In the case of the integrative process, the stream first passed through the upper gasification bed, and then flowed through the reforming bed filled with 15g catalyst. Thus, the experiments were carried out as following steps: (1) the gasification of the crude bio-oil without adding the downstream catalyst; (2) G-CSR at different temperature, and (3) G-ECR at different temperature."
5,Experimental measurements and definitions,"2.4 Experimental measurements and definitions The intermediates from the gasification of the crude bio-oil mainly contained varieties of gases and condensable organic vapors. The intermedial product gases (mainly including H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and other hydrocarbons such as C2H4, C2H6, etc.) were analyzed by two on-line gas chromatographs (GC1 and GC2). The gases of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 were detected by GC1 (Model: SP6890, TDX-01) with thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using ultra-high purity argon (99.999%) as carrier gas and the other hydrocarbons by GC2 (Model: SP6890, GDX-502) with flame ionization detector (FID). The condensable organic vapors were cooled into liquid and then determined by GC–MS analysis (Model: Thermo Trace DSQ (I) with a 30m×0.25mm×0.25um TR-5MS fused-silica capillary column). The injector temperature was 280°C in split mode using ultra-high purity nitrogen as carrier gas. The GC operating conditions were as follows: the oven temperature was held at 40°C for 3min and then heated to 180°C at a rate of 4°C/min, which was finally heated to 280°C at a rate of 10°C/min and held at this temperature for 10min. In GC–MS analysis, the exact same instrument conditions were applied for each sample from gasification of the crude bio-oil at different temperatures, and therefore the retention time corresponding to a certain organic species could be used to compare the changing tendency of the samples with respect to the different gasification temperature. For the integrative gasification-reforming process, the final product gases were also measured by two on-line gas chromatographs (GC1 and GC2) mentioned above. Additionally, the composition of the effluent gases from the reactor was also confirmed by a Q-MS mass spectrometer (Model: Balzers GSD300 Omnistar, Switzerland). The performance for either the single gasification of crude bio-oil or the integrative process was studied by measuring the carbon conversion of bio-oil to gases ( [ C ] conv ) , the hydrogen yield ( Y H 2 ) , and distribution of product gases. The carbon conversion is calculated according to the following Eq. (6) and expressed as the percentage of carbon from the feed converted to the following gaseous products: CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8. As shown in Eq. (7), the hydrogen yield is calculated as a percentage of the stoichiometric potential in case of complete conversion of carbon element in the bio-oil to CO2 according to the Eq. (3) [24]. (6) [ C ] conv = moles of carbon in the product gas moles of carbon in the feed × 100 % (7) Y H 2 = moles of H 2 obtained moles of H 2 in stoichiometric potential × 100 % All tests were repeated three times. The reported data were the mean values of the repeated trials and the error bars were also added to relative figures. The standard deviations of the data were analyzed with origin software release 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation, MA01060, USA)."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Gasification of crude bio-oil,"3.1 Gasification of crude bio-oil The steam gasification of the crude bio-oil was carried out in the gasification bed, and there was no downstream reforming bed. Fig. 2 shows the influences of the gasification temperature (Tg ) on (A) the H2 yield and carbon conversion to gases and (B) the distribution of product gases in the bio-oil gasification process (Tg =500–800°C, P =1atm, f (bio-oil fed rate)=14.4g/h, S/C =10.6, GHSV =7810h−1). It was observed in Fig. 2(A) that both the H2 yield and carbon conversion to gases increased with increasing the gasification temperature. However, the H2 yield from the gasification of the bio-oil was very low in our investigation region. As shown in Fig. 2(B), the distribution of main product gases (H2, CO and CO2) and other hydrocarbon gases (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8) from the gasification of the crude bio-oil was also investigated as a function of the gasification temperature. H2 and CO were the predominant gases in the product gas. At Tg =500°C, the contents of H2 and CO were almost at the same level, being about 38.7vol% and 37.9vol% respectively. With increasing temperature from 500°C to 800°C, the H2 content obviously increased to 53.9vol%, indicating that the thermal decomposition of the oxygenated organic compounds increased at the higher temperature. On the other hand, the CO content appeared an opposite trend. Besides H2 and CO, CO2 also occupied high share in the product gas, the content of which increased remarkably from 7.8vol% to 14.5vol% as the temperature was raised from 500 to 650°C, and then almost kept in the same level over 650°C. The possible explanation is that, almost all the carboxyl groups from which CO2 was mainly originated have been already broken at the temperature lower than 650°C [48]. Moreover, the gas-phase hydrocarbons from the gasification of the bio-oil were also observed. The main organic components in the crude bio-oil and the condensates collected after the gasification of the crude bio-oil were primarily extracted by ethyl acetate respectively and then determined by the GC–MS analysis. Fig. 3 shows the GC–MS analyses for the crude bio-oil and the collected condensates after the gasification of the crude bio-oil at 500, 650, 800°C respectively. Table 2 depicts the detailed organic components present in each sample (only the most abundant species were listed), including retention time (tR ), molecular formula and the compound names. The spectrum of the crude bio-oil was shown in Fig. 3(A). A great number of peaks were clearly observed, distributing over the whole range of the retention time from 5 to 50min. It should be pointed out that some small molecules (such as alcohols, acetic acid, etc.) which commonly exist in the bio-oil, were not successfully analyzed since their peaks were submerged by the extremely intensive solvent peak (i.e., the peak for ethyl acetate). Thus, only the peaks with tR >5min in present GC–MS spectra were analyzed. In the case of lower gasification temperature, the decomposition of the oxygenated organic compounds with higher molecular weight seems unserious (Fig. 3(B) and (C)). However, with increasing temperature to 800°C, decomposition of larger molecules in the crude bio-oil was enhanced (Fig. 3(D)), leading to a decrease of the relative content of heavier compositions. The essential reactions of gasification are pyrolysis, oxidation, carbon gasification, reforming (steam and/or dry), cracking, and water gas shift to yield synthesis gas, water, carbon dioxide, and unwanted products like tars, methane and carbon [49]. And the overall reaction can be expressed as follows: (8) C x H y O z + H 2 O → H 2 + CO + CO 2 + CH 4 + C 2 + + Tars + C ( s ) Thermal cracking initially breaks relatively weak aliphatic bonds, releasing large fragments (tar). Some of these fragments are highly reactive free radicals, which undergo a variety of secondary reactions such as cracking and repolymerzation. Simultaneously, various functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups decompose to form low-molecular-weight gaseous species [50]. Meanwhile, the steam gasification reactions relating to the combustible fraction of carbon in the crude bio-oil produce some gaseous products. The important reactions involved may be given as follows [39]: (9) C + H 2 O → CO + H 2 ( carbon gasification ) (10) CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 ( water − gas shift reaction , i .e ., Eq . ( 2 ) ) (11) C + CO 2 → 2 CO ( Boudouard reaction , the antidromic reaction of Eq . ( 5 ) ) Besides, other reactions may also occur, such as: (12) CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2 ( methane steam reforming ) (13) CH 4 + CO 2 → 2 H 2 + 2 CO ( methane dry reforming ) The relative rates of these reactions, which are influenced by the reaction conditions, determine the gaseous product composition [39]. It should be pointed out that the production of hydrogen derived from the gasification of the crude bio-oil showed a low hydrogen yield (<30%), which agreed with previous work [39,51]. Accordingly, further reforming using suitable reforming catalyst is also required to improve the hydrogen yield."
8,Production of hydrogen from crude bio-oil via integrative G-CSR process,"3.2 Production of hydrogen from crude bio-oil via integrative G-CSR process In view of the problems existing in the gasification of the crude bio-oil (e.g., low hydrogen yield) or in direct steam reforming of crude bio-oil (e.g., fast deactivation of catalysts), an integrative gasification-reforming method is more suitable for efficiently producing hydrogen from the crude bio-oil. This design is in favor of efficiently increasing the H2 yield and decreasing the catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition as proved by the following experiments. Here, the gasification of the crude bio-oil was carried out in the gasification bed and the catalytic steam reforming of all the intermediates were performed in the reforming bed. The influences of the gasification temperature (Tg ) and the reforming temperature (Tr ) on the production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil have been investigated in detail. Fig. 4 shows the hydrogen yield, the carbon conversion and the distribution of the main product gases under the integrative G-CSR mode, measured as a function of the gasification temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(A), both the hydrogen yield and the carbon conversion increased with temperature, reaching 64.6% and 74.3% at Tg =800°C respectively. The distribution of the main product gases (including H2, CO2, CO and CH4) versus gasification temperature was described in Fig. 4(B). H2 and CO2 were main gaseous products from the G-CSR process. The content of H2 gradually increased with the gasification temperature, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the contents of CO and CH4 in the investigated temperature region. The integrative G-CSR process significantly promotes the performance of hydrogen production from the crude bio-oil as compared with single gasification of the crude bio-oil (Fig. 2). For example, the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion from the bio-oil gasification at Tg =500°C were only about 6.7% and 21.9% (Fig. 2(A)) respectively, which remarkably increased to 41.5% and 47.1% (Fig. 4(A)) while the downstream catalyst was applied (i.e., G-CSR mode). In addition, the contents of H2 and CO2 in the product gas also significantly increased through G-CSR, accompanied by an obvious reduction of un-reformed hydrocarbons (e.g., CH4) and CO (Fig. 4(B)). The above results indicated that most of organic components from the gasification of the crude bio-oil were reformed to hydrogen, and most CO was converted to CO2 by WGS reaction via integrative G-CSR process. The influence of downstream reforming temperature on production of hydrogen via G-CSR was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 , the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion were 38.0% and 56.3% at Tr =400°C, and gradually increased to 64.6% and 74.3% respectively at Tr =700°C. Higher reforming temperature favors higher hydrogen yield and carbon conversion because the reforming reactions of organic components are endothermic. In addition, with increasing temperature from 400°C to 700°C, the content of H2 in the product gas slightly increased from 67.8 to 72.5vol%, accompanied by a decrease of the CH4 content from 3.5vol% to near zero. The CO2 content was around 27–28vol%. An increasing trend of the CO content versus the reforming temperature observed may be attributed to the fact that the WGS reaction is an exothermal process. Moreover, the amount of the C2+ hydrocarbons was negligible in the final product gas."
9,Production of hydrogen from crude bio-oil via integrative G-ECR process,"3.3 Production of hydrogen from crude bio-oil via integrative G-ECR process In our work, it was interestingly observed that the overall performance of hydrogen production from the crude bio-oil was significantly affected by the current (I) through the Ni–Cr wire embedded in the NiCuZnAl catalyst. Fig. 6 (A) shows the effect of current on the hydrogen yield at fixed reforming temperatures. It was found that the hydrogen yield was obviously enhanced by the current through the catalyst. When the current was absent (i.e., the G-CSR mode), the hydrogen yield was 38.0% at 400°C. With increasing the current to 3.0A, the hydrogen yield increased to 55.4% at 400°C. At 700°C, the hydrogen yield reached as high as 81.4% when the current of 3.0A was employed. As shown in Fig. 6(B), the carbon conversion also increased with increasing the current at various fixed reforming temperatures, indicating that more organic intermediates were converted into carbon-containing gaseous products with higher current. The highest carbon conversion of 87.6% was obtained at Tr =700°C and I =3.0A in the tested range. Fig. 6(C) and (D) display the influence of the current on the distribution of the main product gases at the reforming temperature of 400°C and 700°C respectively. At both 400 and 700°C, with increasing the current from 0A to 3.0A, the contents of H2 and CO in the product gas increased slightly. Meanwhile, the CH4 content in the product gas showed the inverse trend. The mixture gases containing H2 (73.1vol%), CO2 (25.6vol%), CO (0.91vol%) and CH4 (0.01vol%) were achieved at Tr =700°C and I =3.0A. The above results indicate that high efficient hydrogen production from the crude bio-oil can be realized by the integrative G-ECR process, even using non-noble NiCuZnAl reforming catalyst. The promotion effect of the current for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil can be qualitatively understood as follows. First, the enhancement of the organic intermediates' reforming in the ECR process may partly arise from the higher temperature close to the electrified Ni–Cr wire. The temperature gradients in ECR were higher than those in CSR [45–47]. Particularly, the local temperature close to the electrified Ni–Cr wire was evidently higher than the average temperature, which may partly result in the higher activity of the catalyst close to the electrified Ni–Cr [45–47]. Secondly, the promotion by the current during ECR process may also originate from the catalyst's reduction caused by the thermal electrons. It is well known that when an electrified metal or a metal oxide is heated, electrons can boil off its surface, leading to thermal emission of electrons from surface (i.e., thermal electron emission) [52]. It has been reported that thermal electrons on a metal or a metal oxide surface play an important role in the reduction process (e.g., O2 +4e− →2O2−) [53]. The presence of the thermal electrons in the current-enhanced reforming process was experimentally confirmed by the anionic time of flight mass (TOF) and Faraday-plate methods in our previous work [45,46]. These thermal electrons contributed to an additional reduction from the oxide states into the metallic states (see Figs. 8 and 9 in Section 3.5), leading to the enhancement of the catalytic activity. Finally, the promoting effects of the current may be partly attributed to the enhancement of the decomposition and reforming of the organic intermediates during ECR via the thermal electrons. The thermal electrons can cause the dissociation of the oxygenated organic compounds on the catalyst surface, which was confirmed by using C2H5OH [46] and HAc [47] as model compounds. The dissociations of the oxygenated organic compounds lead to form small unstable fragments and some active radicals (e.g., OH and CH), which may be very useful for prompting the reforming reactions. Moreover, Table 4 evaluates the contributions from the heating and the thermal electrons in the G-ECR process, basing on the comparison of hydrogen yield and carbon conversion between G-CSR (outside heating mode) and G-ECR (inner heating mode). In view of the hydrogen yield, the results show that the heating effect is dominating in the G-ECR-I process (about 70–80% in total hydrogen yield). In addition, the contribution from the thermal electrons to production of hydrogen in the G-ECR process was further investigated using the electrified Al–Fe–Cr wire with low resistance of 0.5Ω, in which the heating impact (I2R) from the wire was nearly negligible (G-ECR-II in Table 4). The proportion of the contribution from the thermal electrons to total hydrogen yield was about 20%, which also agreed with the above evaluation of G-ECR-I. Additionally, it was found that the energy efficiency in the G-ECR reforming process was higher than that in the G-CSR process (see Table 5), which may be explained by the multiple roles including thermal effect, the effect of thermal electrons, and less heat loss in the inner heating method. The evaluation of energy efficiency will be discussed later. Further work is still required to clearly understand the reforming mechanism in G-ECR process."
10,Stability of catalyst,"3.4 Stability of catalyst As shown in Fig. 7, the different stabilities of the NiCuZnAl catalyst during the direct steam reforming of the crude bio-oil, the G-CSR mode and the G-ECR mode were all tested by measuring the hydrogen yield as function of the time on stream. For the direct steam reforming test, the hydrogen yield initially increased for about 20min as the bio-oil was fed into the reactor. The yield quickly decreased to ∼70 % of the maximal value for 1h, finally dropped to about half of the maximal yield at the time of 100min. For the G-CSR mode and the G-ECR mode, however, the obvious plateau region appeared for initial 2.5–3.0h reforming. A sequential slow decrease in hydrogen yield was observed, dropping to ∼80% of the maximal value for 6h in the G-ECR mode. The results clearly show that the catalyst deactivation during the direct steam reforming of the crude bio-oil is much serious than that in the two integrative gasification-reforming modes. It is well known that the catalyst deactivation is a troublesome problem in the process of hydrogen production from crude bio-oil. The deactivation of the catalysts occurring in the above three processes may be attributed to several factors, including the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) and the structural changes of the catalyst and/or the content decreases of the active compositions in the catalyst [23]. And the problem of carbon deposition has the most significant influence for the direct reforming of the crude bio-oil, which can be greatly improved in the integrative gasification-reforming processes. From all the above results and discussions, it can be concluded that: (1) Low H2 yield and low H2 content in the product gas were obtained in the single gasification of the crude bio-oil; (2) The H2 yield and H2 content in the product gas can be obviously improved via the integrative G-CSR process. Particularly, the resulting product gas derived from the crude bio-oil was a (H2 +CO2)-rich mixture with very low total amount of CO and CH4 (<1vol%); (3) The H2 yield and H2 content in the product gas as well as the duration time of hydrogen production can be further upgraded by applying the current through the downstream catalyst (i.e., the G-ECR mode); (4) Additionally, the lifetime of the NiCuZnAl catalyst was significantly prolonged via the integrative G-CSR and G-ECR processes, comparing to the direct reforming of the crude bio-oil over the catalyst."
11,Characterization of the reforming catalysts,"3.5 Characterization of the reforming catalysts The alterations of the structure characteristics of the catalysts and their changes under G-CSR and G-ECR modes were investigated by the XRD measurements. Fig. 8 shows the typical XRD spectra for (a) the fresh NiCuZnAl catalyst; (b) the used catalyst under G-CSR for 6h; (c) the used catalyst under G-ECR for 6h; and (d) the treated catalyst via a current passing through the catalyst in pure argon ambience for 10h, respectively. For the fresh catalyst (Fig. 8(a)), the dispersed diffraction structure was mainly assigned to the NiO phase at 2θ =37.1°, 43.4° and 62.9°. The CuO and ZnO phases were not observed due to high dispersion in the prepared NiCuZnAl catalyst. For the samples of b and c, almost all of the NiO phase was converted into the metallic Ni (i.e., the Ni(111), Ni(200), Ni(220) peaks at 44.2°, 51.4° and 75.6°). In addition, the diffraction peaks of the metallic Cu (at 2θ =44.2°, 51.4°, and 75.6°) and Zn (at 2θ =44.2° and 37.5°) can be also identified. This means that some amounts of metal oxides (i.e., NiO, CuO, and ZnO) were reduced into the metallic phase (i.e., Ni, Cu, and Zn) during both G-CSR and G-ECR processes. The reduction from M2+ to M0 under G-CSR should be attributed to the reaction of MO+H2 →M+H2O, where H2 was produced by the gasification of the crude bio-oil and the organic intermediates' reforming. It is noticed that the reduction level of the NiCuZnAl after G-ESR is higher than the value from G-CSR for both 6h. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the relative intensity of the Ni0, Cu0 and Zn0 diffraction peaks became remarkably stronger, compared with their intensity in Fig. 8(b). This may be explained that the MO (M=Ni, Cu and Zn) phase was reduced into the metallic M0 partly by hydrogen (i.e., M2+ +H2 →M0 +H2O) together with the additional reduction by the thermal electrons (i.e., M2+ +2e− →M0) when the current supplied into the catalyst bed in the G-ECR process. This explanation was supported by two facts: (1) the desorption of the thermal electrons from the electrified catalyst was directly observed and collected; and (2) the reduction behavior was also observed when a current was passed through the catalyst under the pure argon (Fig. 8(d)). XPS measurements were also employed to investigate the atomic states on the catalysts' surfaces under both G-CSR and G-ECR modes. Fig. 9A–C show typical Ni/Cu/Zn XPS spectra from the four samples mentioned above. As can be seen from Fig. 9A(a), the bind energy at about 855.5eV and 861.7eV were observed for the pristine catalyst, which were assigned to the main line of Ni2+ (2 p3/2) and its satellite [54,55], respectively. A new peak at about 852.7eV was observed after the catalyst was applied under G-CSR mode for 6h, corresponding to the peak of the metallic Ni0 (2p3/2) [54,55]. This peak became stronger when a current of 3.0 A was added for 6h (the G-ECR mode). The same reduction behavior of Ni2+ to Ni0 was also observed when a current passed through the catalyst in the pure argon ambience (Fig. 9A(d)). These observations were in agreement with the XRD results (see Fig. 8(b–d)), indicating that the crystalline phases of the metallic Ni appeared after the electrochemical catalytic reforming and after adding a current into the catalyst in argon ambience. In addition, the shift of the Cu and Zn XPS peaks in Fig. 9(B) and (C) from higher bind energy (at about 934.7eV and 1022.2eV respectively) to lower bind energy (at about 932.7eV and 1021.3eV respectively) was also identified, indicating that the reduction of the oxide states to the metallic states occurred in the above processes. Fig. 10 presents the profile of H2-TPR (hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction) for the fresh NiCuZnAl catalyst. The sharp H2 consumption peak (peak A) around 270°C in the lower temperature region is due to the reduction of CuO [56] in the catalyst. The TPR peak centering at about 500°C (peak B) is attributed to the reduction of Ni2+ to metallic Ni [57], and also a contribution of Zn2+ to Zn0 [54,58]. The tenting zoon near 600°C (peak C) in the higher temperature region is also attributed to the reduction of NiO to Ni [59], reflecting the interactions between the NiO and the support. At the temperature over 700°C, three main metal oxides in the NiCuZnAl catalyst can be nearly full reduced. Generally, the catalyst deactivation during the reforming process of bio-oil or other hydrocarbons are mainly caused by the deposition of carbon (coke-formation) on the catalyst [23]. Table 3 shows the amounts of the carbon deposition on the catalyst measured by TGA (Thermogravimetry Analysis) for different operating processes, including (1) the bio-oil's direct reforming, (2) the G-CSR process, and (3) the G-ECR process, as described in detail in the experimental section. The data presented in Table 3 are the ratio of the carbon weight deposited on the catalyst for a given duration time to the catalyst weight (15g). For example, the amount of the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface was about 10.3wt.%, corresponding to the ratio of 1.54g carbon deposition to the catalyst weight during direct bio-oil's reforming at 700°C for 1.7h. The results indicate that the amount of the carbon deposition during the crude bio-oil's direct reforming (i.e., single catalyst bed) was obviously larger than those in the G-CSR and G-ECR processes (i.e., gasification-reforming dual beds), which agreed with the tested results of the catalyst stability (Fig. 7). Moreover, according to the TGA investigations, the current did significantly reduce the amount of carbon deposition, comparing the value of 1.7% (I =3.0A for 6h) in the G-ECR process to the value of 3.9% (I =0A for 6h) in the G-CSR process. In the G-CSR and G-ECR processes, the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) is a very important reaction that affects the equilibrium of both CO and CO2. The changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for WGS reaction have been calculated in the temperature range from 200 and 700°C. It can be noted that WGS reaction is an exothermic process, with ΔH ranging between −40.1 and −35.3kJ/mol. The Gibbs free energy change (−21.4 to −4.1 kJ/mol) shows that the reaction is favorable at all temperatures investigated. The equilibrium constant for WGS increases as temperature decreases [60]. Additionally, WGS is believed to be thermodynamics and kinetics limited process depending on the specified operating conditions and its reaction rate will be increased with increasing temperature [61]. It should be pointed out that the WGS reaction is an encouraged elementary step for the production of hydrogen from the bio-oil, because it can enhance the hydrogen yield. To investigate the WGS activity over the NiCuZnAl catalyst, the conversion of CO to CO2 was tested by using a model mixture of H2O/CO/Ar (56: 8: 36 in mol% ratio). As shown in Fig. 11 , the conversion of CO increased with increasing temperature at the lower temperature range (<300°C), reaching a near complete conversion (about 100%) at 400°C. Further increasing temperature over 600°C led to a slight decrease of the CO conversion. In addition, CO mainly converted into CO2 with a selectivity of 91%–100% through the WGS reaction ( CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2 , Δ H 298 Θ = − 41.1 kJ / mol ) , accompanied by the formation of a small amount of methane around 400°C through the reaction of methane formation ( CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O , Δ H 298 Θ = − 205.9 kJ / mol ) . The above results suggests that the NiCuZnAl catalyst shows a much high activity in WGS reaction in the range of 300–700°C, which agreed with the results that the CO content in the final products gases is much lower than that of CO2 in the integrative processes (see Figs. 5 and 6)."
12,Evaluation for G-CSR and G-ECR,"3.6 Evaluation for G-CSR and G-ECR The energy efficiency and the energy balance for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil have been evaluated for the following two modes, i.e., the G-CSR mode and the G-ECR mode. Energy efficiency (η Energy) is defined as total heating value of the gases produced (E output) divided by the energy consumed by the experimental system (E input) per hour. Total energy consumption for the G-ECR mode included: (1) the energy used for the bio-oil gasification provided by outside heater, (2) the energy used for the downstream ECR reforming provided by inside electrified Ni–Cr wire and outside heater, and (3) the energy used for producing and preheating the steam from the steam generator. For the G-CSR mode, total energy consumed included: (1) the energy used for the bio-oil gasification, (2) the energy used for the CSR reforming provided by outside heater, and (3) the energy used for producing and preheating the steam. The hydrogen productivity (mol H2/h) formed from the gasification-reforming process was derived from the dry gaseous volume collected per hour and the content of hydrogen in the product gas. As shown in Table 5 , the energy efficiency in the G-ECR process ranged from 40.5% to 44.9%, which was higher than that in the G-CSR process (26.4–31.5%). Higher energy efficiency in the G-ECR process may be attributed to the electrified Ni–Cr wire installed in the reactor, playing a dual role both in heating the catalyst and providing the thermal electrons onto the catalyst at the same time. The thermal electrons can be used for promoting the dissociation and the reforming reactions of some oxygenated organic compounds [46,47]. In addition, as shown in Table 5, the energy balance (ΔE = E output − E input) was always negative because the production of hydrogen from the bio-oil gasification-reforming is an endothermic process. Finally, Table 6 shows a comparison and evaluation for various thermochemical technologies (including the present work) used for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil. As can be seen, the hydrogen yield and the hydrogen content in the product gas derived from pyrolysis and gasification processes (without adding catalyst), were much lower than those from the catalytic reforming of the crude bio-oil. The catalytic steam reforming using noble mental-based catalysts such as Pt-based or Rh-based catalyst seems to give higher hydrogen yield (∼50–70%) as compared with using non-noble mental-based catalysts. However, these noble catalysts may not be suitable for extensive production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil due to their expensive cost. Present G-ECR route using NiCuZnAl catalyst shows the following advantages including (1) higher hydrogen content (about 73 vol%) in the product gas which was about 9–40% higher than those from other reforming routes, and (2) higher hydrogen yield (about 81%) which was about 16–76% higher than those from other reforming routes. In particular, the deactivation of the catalyst was significantly depressed by using the integrative gasification-reforming mode, comparing to the direct reforming of the crude bio-oil (see Fig. 7)."
13,Conclusions,"Present work reports an efficient approach for production of hydrogen from the crude bio-oil via the integrative G-ECR reforming process. The NiCuZnAl catalyst was used in the downstream reforming bed. Higher hydrogen yield (81.4%) and carbon conversion to gases (87.6%) were obtained via the integrative G-ECR process, comparing to the single gasification of crude bio-oil and the integrative G-CSR process. The resulting product gas derived from the crude bio-oil was a (H2 +CO2)-rich mixture with a composition of ∼73 vol% H2 and ∼26 vol% CO2 together with a trace amount of CO and CH4. In particular, the deactivation of the catalyst was significantly depressed by using the integrative gasification-reforming method, comparing to the direct reforming of the crude bio-oil. The integrative G-ECR process with high hydrogen yield and carbon conversion, potentially, would be a useful route to produce hydrogen from the crude bio-oil."
