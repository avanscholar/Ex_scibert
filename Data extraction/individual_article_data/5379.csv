0,Introduction,"Since the production of aerogels through the innovative sol-gel and drying process by Kistler in 1931 [1], this family of substance has attracted a great deal of attention for various applications including supercapacitors, phase change material, absorbents and thermal insulation, owing to their low thermal conductivity and density as well as high porosity and specific surface area [2–6]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is regarded as one of the most important water-soluble vinyl polymer. In particular, PVA composites have attracted enormous interest due to their satisfactory performance, film forming characteristics, non-toxicity, high hydrophilicity, biodegradability, ease of processing, proper chemical resistance, excellent mechanical properties, and biocompatibility. These superior features have resulted in a myriad of industrial applications among which hydrogels, aerogels, films, fibers, adhesives and coatings have been mentioned [7–12]. These fascinating applications are however restricted by the PVA’s intrinsic flammability associated with their molecular structure and chemical composition, which urgently necessitates the development of flame-retardant PVA. Concerning the flame retardant PVA, the majority of studies have addressed the flame retardancy of PVA through use of halogenated compounds. Despite the proper flame retardancy, incorporation of conventional halogenated flame-retardants may lead to several disadvantages, including toxins release during decomposition [13]. Development of halogen-free flame retardants is therefore of crucial importance [14–16]. To improve the flame retardancy of PVA, a series of layered double hydroxide structures were synthesized and applied in the PVA matrix as synergistic agents [17]. Very recently, Guo et al. [9] succeeded in production of hydroxyapatite/PVA composite aerogels; they revealed a decline in the thermal conductivity of the composite aerogels upon hydroxyapatite incorporation. Furthermore, the specimen with hydroxyapatite/PVA mass ratio of 1:1 demonstrated significantly improved flame resistance and self-extinguishing properties during the vertical burning test. Chen et al. prepared PVA-based aerogel composites containing nano-scaled silica, halloysite, montmorillonite, and laponite (at mass ratio of 1:1) [18]. The combustion test results indicated a slight decrease in the time to ignition (TTI) upon nanofiller addition. Heat release rate (HRR) and CO production also revealed a significant decline, far less than those of expanded polystyrene. A subtle enhancement was detected in the limiting oxygen index (LOI) from 22% to 25%, whereas it failed to pass the V-0 rating in the UL-94 test. Kang et al. reported synthesis of PVA/laponite/fly ash aerogel [19]. They observed that for samples containing more than 63.6 wt% fly ash, the LOI grew up to more than 60%; while HRR, THR, smoke production rate (SPR) and total smoke production (TSP) of PVA/laponite/fly ash aerogels showed a significant reduction by fly ash incorporation. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) also revealed the enhancing role of fly ash in the thermal stability of PVA/laponite/fly ash aerogel. Moreover, an enhancement was observed in thermal conductivity of aerogels with incremented density. As a new class of nano-materials, metal organic framework can be formed through the self-assembly of coordination bonds between metallic ions and organic binding ligands [20]. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) refers to a class of metal organic framework material with improved thermal stability compared to most of the other kinds of metal organic frameworks [21]. Owing to their rich structure, convenient synthesis, large specific surface area and high porosity, ZIF has been extensively applied in various fields including photoelectric materials, catalysis and gas adsorption [22–25]. Recent efforts have been dedicated to investigation of the use of ZIF in flame retardant applications. Shi et al. found an improvement in the flame retardancy of polylactic acid (PLA)/ZIF-8 composites in terms of an increase in the LOI from 20.5% for pure PLA to 26% for PLA with adding 3 wt% ZIF-8 [26]. Xu et al. reported that the addition of 2 wt% ZIF-8 into epoxy resin significantly declined the PHRR and TSP by 58% and 23%, respectively, compared to the unmodified epoxy observed in cone calorimeter measurement [27]. These studies convince us that ZIF is one promising flame retardant filler in polymeric materials. However, the flame retardant achievements are not satisfactory, for example, no UL-94 V-0 classification was achieved in these studies [26,27]. There is still room for further improvement of the flame retardant effect of ZIF. Additionally, ZIF can form hydrogen bonding with several polymer matrices containing abundant hydrogen atoms. Thus, PVA is selected as polymer matrix that is expected to form strong interaction with ZIF. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no reports so far on the utilization of ZIF in flame retardant aerogel materials. In the current study, ZIF-8-modified PVA hybrid aerogels were fabricated by a freeze-drying approach and their microstructure, flammability, thermal stability and mechanical characteristics were studied. A mechanism was also proposed for improvement of their flame retardancy."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials PVA (Mowiol® 8-88 type, Mw ~ 67000), 2-methylimidazole (mIM), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), and ammonia were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., LTD (Shanghai, China). All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without purification."
3,Synthesis of ZIF-8,"2.2 Synthesis of ZIF-8 A total of 1.64 g of mIM in 18.8 mL of ammonia and 2.97 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 16 mL of distilled water were dissolved. Subsequently, both solutions were mixed and stirred at room temperature for 60 min. The final product was rinsed with distilled water three times to remove the residual reactants, and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h [28]."
4,Synthesis of ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels,"2.3 Synthesis of ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels A series of ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogel with different ZIF-8/PVA mass ratios was prepared by a simple freeze-drying method. Typically, 5.0 g of ZIF-8 particles was dispersed with 45 mL of deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to obtain a 10 wt% ZIF-8 aqueous suspension. 5.0 g of PVA was dissolved in 45 mL of deionized water at 80 °C to obtain a 10 wt% PVA aqueous suspension. Subsequently, 5 mL of 10 wt% ZIF-8 aqueous suspensions was mixed with 15 mL of 10 wt% PVA aqueous suspension under stirring for 30 min to obtain uniform slurry. The mixture obtained was immediately frozen at −80 °C for 12 h followed by freeze-dried in a SCIENTZ-12N freeze dryer (Ningbo SCIENTZ Biotechnology Co., Ltd) for another 48 h. The ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogel obtained was denoted as ZP1 (The mass ratio of ZIF-8 and PVA was 1:3). The ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels with a ZIF-8/PVA mass ratio of 1:2 and 1:1 were fabricated by a similar procedure which was encoded as ZP2 and ZP3, respectively. The un-modified PVA aerogel was prepared by a similar method just without adding ZIF-8 particles."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization The Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected by a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) using KBr disc method. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) for the samples were recorded on a Rigaku Dmax/rA diffractometer (Japan) using Cu Kα source (λ = 1.542 Ǻ) at 40 kV, 35 mA, and a scan range of 5°–60°. The morphology of the samples was observed on a JSM-6700F field emission microscope (JEOL, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The samples were sputtered with a gold layer before scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation to improve the electrical conductivity. TGA of the samples was conducted using a Q5000 thermal analyzer (TA, USA). Approximately 5.0 mg of the sample was heated from ambient temperature to 800 °C at a linear heating rate of 20 oC·min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed at 77 K using an ASAP 2460 surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instruments, USA). The specific surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore size was obtained by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method applied on the desorption branch of the isotherm. The eq (1 − ρ*/ρ) × 100% was used to determine the porosity of the composite aerogels, where ρ* is the density of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogel and ρ is theoretical density of PVA aerogel. The thermal conductivity was measured by a TC 3000E Thermal Analysis System (Xiaxi technology, China) at ambient temperature. Five tests were repeated for each sample, and the average value was reported. The compression tests were performed on a CMT6104 electromechanical universal testing machine (MTS Systems Co., China) according to the ASTM D3575-14 standard. The cylindrical aerogels with the height and diameter of 15 mm and 15 mm were used and the compression strain rate was set at 2 mm min−1. Five tests were repeated for each sample, and the average value was reported. The LOI value was obtained by Oxygen Index Meter (Jiangning, China) according to the ASTM D2863-2008 method. The vertical burning test was performed in a burning test chamber (Jiangning, China). The bottom of cylindrical aerogel samples with the height and diameter of 100 mm and 15 mm were exposed to the flame for 10 s, and then the flame was removed. The HRR was detected using a micro combustion calorimeter (MCC) (Fire Testing Technology, UK). Approximately 5.0 mg of the sample was pyrolyzed at 900 °C in a nitrogen flow (flow rate: 80 mL min−1), and then the pyrolysis volatiles were imported into the combustor where the volatiles were mixed with an oxygen flow (flow rate: 20 mL min−1). The HRR was calculated according to the oxygen consumption principle."
6,Result and discussion,"Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra of ZIF/PVA hybrid aerogel (ZP3), PVA aerogel and ZIF-8. The characteristic peaks of PVA aerogel were observed at 1036, 1383, 2923 and 2855 and 3432 cm−1 which could be assigned to COC stretching, CH bending, saturated CH2/CH3 groups stretching and hydroxyl groups OH stretching vibrations, respectively [28]. The absorption bands of ZIF-8 were observed at around 421 cm−1 (ZnN stretching vibrations), 1177 and 994 cm−1 (CN stretching vibrations), 600–1500 cm−1 (bending vibration mode of the imidazole ring), 1350–1500 cm−1 (stretching vibration of imidazole ring), 1574 cm−1 (CN stretching vibrations of the imidazole ring), 2926 cm−1 (CH stretching), 3133 cm−1 (CH stretching) and 3200–3430 cm−1 (stretching of the NH group) [27]. The characteristic peak of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels at 3421 cm−1 could be assigned to the OH group of PVA, and the bands at 3025 and 2922 cm−1 were attributed to the aromatic and aliphatic C–H stretch of the imidazole in ZIF-8 and PVA, respectively. Moreover, the FTIR spectrum of the ZP3 hybrid aerogels exhibited some bands at 1450–1300 and at 1200–950 cm−1 corresponding to OH and CO bonds, respectively. Moreover, the band position of the OH stretching vibration of the ZP3 aerogel shifted to lower frequency compared to that of either ZIF-8 or PVA aerogel, suggesting the presence of hydrogen bonding interaction between ZIF-8 and PVA matrix [29]. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of ZIF-8, PVA aerogel and ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels. The typical diffraction peaks of ZIF-8 particles were found at 7.3° (0 1 1), 10.3° (0 0 2), 12.7° (1 1 2), 14.7° (0 2 2), 16.4° (0 1 3), 18.0° (2 2 2), 24.6° (2 3 3) and 26.7° (1 3 4). The intensity and the position of the diffraction peaks are consistent with the previously reported values [28,30]. A broad diffraction peak centered at 22.6° in PVA aerogel is indicative of an amorphous phase created by the freeze-drying procedure. The intensity of the characteristic diffraction peaks associated with ZIF-8 gradually increased with enhancement of the ZIF-8 content. Based on the XRD results, the crystal phase of ZIF-8 was not destroyed during the formation of the three-dimensional networks of ZIF-8 and PVA. The morphology of ZIF-8, PVA aerogel, and ZP3 hybrid aerogel were assessed by SEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 3 . The SEM images of the ZIF-8 showed the nano-scaled crystals with flower-like morphology which tended to aggregate (Fig. 3a, b and c). The PVA aerogel displayed an interconnected, irregular and highly porous structure (Fig. 3d, e and f). In fact, the cells represented the traces of ice during the unidirectional freezing process. Furthermore, the precursor viscosity significantly increased due to the strong internal interaction and flexibility of PVA, which hindered the formation of ice crystals and hence the subsequent ice growth-induced orientation of the substances [31]. The ZP3 hybrid aerogel showed a porous microstructure similar to that of PVA aerogel but with much rougher cell walls (Fig. 3g, h and k) which can be due to the attachment of ZIF-8 particles onto the surface of PVA aerogel cells. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was employed for elemental analysis of ZIF-8. In this content, elemental mapping of C, N, Zn and O is depicted in Fig. 3j to p. According to the figures, the mentioned elements had uniform distribution throughout the ZP3 hybrid aerogel with no evident aggregation, reflecting the feasibility of the present method in production of highly homogeneous hybrid aerogels. TGA was used to examine the thermal stability of the samples through monitoring their weight variation upon heating. Fig. 4 shows the TGA thermograms of ZIF-8, PVA aerogel, ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 aerogels. The gradual 18% weight loss up to 200 °C in ZIF-8 can be associated with the decomposition of substituted and unsubstituted 2-methylimidazole molecules and evaporation of the surface-entrapped solvent. The structural degradation and decomposition of organic ligands occurred at 250–750 °C giving rise to 35% weight loss [32]. Regarding the TGA curves of aerogels, the weight loss occurred below 100 °C can be related to water loss as all the components of aerogels are rich in surface hydroxyl groups which can easily absorb water [33]. The major weight loss at 250–350 °C can be explained by decomposition of the hydroxyl group in PVA. The PVA backbone decomposition caused a third stage of weight loss at 400–500 °C in the pure PVA. A three-step degradation behavior was therefore observed in the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels as well. A slight weight loss was detected in hybrid aerogels at temperatures below 180 °C which can be associated with the moisture loss. The decomposition temperatures of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels were reduced compared to that of pure PVA aerogel and the second stage occurred in 180–240 °C due to decomposition of PVA hydroxyl groups and 2-methylimidazole molecules of ZIF-8. The collapse of the ZIF-8 structure and decomposition of the PVA backbone caused the third step at 240–500 °C. The PVA aerogel rapidly decomposed at 313 °C. The maximum thermal degradation temperatures of PZ1, PZ2 and PZ3 aerogels were measured to be 250, 249, and 249 °C, respectively. The residues of PVA, ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 aerogels at 800 °C were 5.3%, 17.3%, 19.3%, and 30.2%, respectively. Due to uniform distribution of ZIF-8 particles in PVA aerogels, the amount of residues slightly increased in comparison with that of the PVA aerogel. With the gradual increase of ZIF-8 content in the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels, a dense and continuous protective layer of zinc oxide could be observed which can be assigned to ZIF-8 pyrolysis. The mentioned protective layer could effectively delay the mass loss and prevent further thermal decomposition of PVA by fire. Therefore, the ZIF-8 particles can increase the residue yield in the PVA aerogels. The pore structure of the samples directly determines their mass transport behavior [34–36]. The nitrogen absorption and desorption isotherms were studied to determine the specific surface area through BET method. Isotherms of the PVA aerogel and the ZP3 hybrid aerogels are presented in Fig. 5 a. Both samples exhibited type II with an H3 hysteresis. The specific surface area was calculated to be 604.7 and 190.94 m2·g−1 for the PVA aerogel and ZP3 hybrid aerogel, respectively. The decrease in the surface area could be due to filling of the PVA aerogel cell with the ZIF-8 particles. The total pore volume of the PVA aerogel and the ZP3 hybrid aerogel were 0.4633 and 0.0905 cm3·g−1, respectively, in less than 74.4036 nm and 89.4044 nm at P/P0 = 0.97. The BJH method was also employed to determine the distribution of the pore size as shown in Fig. 5b. The BJH analysis suggested a mesoporous structure with diameter range of 5–40 nm. The thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters of aerogel materials. The aerogel density can theoretically affect the thermal conductivity of aerogel [37]. Table 1 lists the thermal conductivity of the samples. The thermal conductivity of the PVA aerogel was 0.0414 W m−1 K−1. Incorporation of ZIF-8 reduced the thermal conductivity of ZP1 to 0.0327 W m−1 K−1. Giorgio et al. investigated the impact of microstructural voids on the thermal conductivity of fractal porous media and described the effect of pore size, geometry of the structure and its porosity complexity on the thermal conductivity. Based on their results, the presence of “pore walls” and higher number of small pores had a declining impact on the thermal conductivity [37]. Further increase of ZIF-8 content led to an enhancement in thermal conductivity of the samples, as any rise in the density of hybrid aerogel will increase the thermal conductivity [38]. Noteworthy, the thermal conductivity of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels was comparable or even better than the common thermal insulating materials such as cellular glass (λ = 0.041 W m−1 K−1), cellulose (λ = 0.04–0.05 W m−1 K−1) and wood (λ = 0.04–0.4 W m−1 K−1), fiberglass (λ = 0.033–0.044 W m−1 K−1), and polystyrene foams (λ = 0.033–0.044 W m−1 K−1) [39]. The mechanical characteristics of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels were measured and compared with those of the PVA aerogel. The compressive stress-strain curves of PVA, ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 aerogels are depicted in Fig. 6 , suggesting the linear elastic behavior at low strains followed by a decrease in the collapse-related cell stress at moderate strain levels. Table 1 summarizes the modulus and the specific modulus of the samples. It can be found that the compressive modulus showed a gradual increase with the growth of the ZIF-8 content due to the intrinsic rigidity of the ZIF-8 particles. The specific modulus was calculated as the ratio of compressive modulus to density whose trend was similar to the modulus. In particular, the specific modulus of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel was approximately 3.19 times higher than the PVA aerogel which can be attributed to addition of rigid ZIF-8 particles as well as the formation of hydrogen bonding. As an important parameter for the characterization of the flame retardancy of polymeric materials, LOI values were measured and listed in Table 2 . The LOI of the PVA aerogel was just 19.5%, indicating an easily-igniting material. By contrast, the LOI of ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 aerogels increased to 21.5%, 23.0% and 24.0%, respectively, with the increase of the ZIF-8 content. The flame retardant effect of the samples was also evaluated by the UL-94 vertical burning test. Fig. 7 displays the snapshots of the PVA aerogel and its hybrid aerogels in the UL-94 vertical burning test. As can be observed, the PVA aerogel was quickly ignited, as the flame rapidly propagated and vigorously burned up to the clamp within 30 s. Such behavior could be due to its air-filled porous structure. The ZP1 hybrid aerogel exhibited a similar burning behavior, this implies that low content of ZIF-8 failed to form an effective barrier and stop the flame propagation. For the ZP2 hybrid aerogel, the flame self-extinguished by removal of the Bunsen burner at the first time, but the flame burned up to the clamp within 30 s for the second ignition. The ZP3 hybrid aerogel shows self-extinguishing behavior for both the first and the second ignition, suggesting high flame retardancy. These results indicate that the presence of the ZIF-8 can significantly improve the flame retardancy of the PVA aerogel. The MCC has been widely employed to evaluate the flame retardancy of polymeric materials. This method can offer several important parameters including THR and PHRR. Fig. 8 displays the HRR curves of the PVA aerogel and the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels, and their corresponding data are listed in Table 2. The PHRR and the THR values of the PVA aerogel were 387.6 W·g−1 and 41.3 kJ g−1, respectively. Compared to the PVA aerogel, the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels showed two distinctive heat release peaks, which is consistent with the DTG curves. The first heat release peak corresponds to the combustion of the decomposition volatiles derived from the collapse of the ZIF-8 structure and decomposition of the PVA backbone, while the second one is attributed to the combustion of the decomposed volatiles due to thermal degradation of the residues. The PHRR and THR exhibited a gradual decline with increase of ZIF-8 content. Specifically, the PHRR and THR of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel decreased to 216.2 W·g−1 and 36.0 kJ g−1, respectively, corresponding to 44.2% and 12.8% reduction relative to PVA aerogel. Degradation of ZIF-8 to ZnO enhanced the barrier effect of the residues, which can explain the suppressed PHRR and THR values. Fig. 9 a shows the FT-IR spectra of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel (in the range of 400–4000 cm−1) after the vertical burning test. The peak at 3400 cm−1 can be assigned to the OH bond stretching vibration of the adsorbed moisture. The absorption band at 433 cm−1 can be also attributed to ZnO stretching vibration. The peaks at 2925 and 1458 cm−1 are indicative of CH2 group [40,41]. The characteristic absorption at 1589 and 1004 cm−1 are respective signs of CC and COC groups [42]. In order to obtain deeper insight on the combustion properties of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels, microstructure of their residues was investigated via SEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 9b. A char layer was formed on the sample's surface. SEM images also demonstrate zinc oxide particles in different flake morphologies, which functioned as effective physical barrier in the flame. Fig. 9c presents the XRD profile of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel after the UL-94 vertical burning test. The XRD profile of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel residue revealed a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 24° (marked with star) belonging to the characteristic band of the graphitized carbon [27]. Except this peak, the other characteristic diffraction peaks (marked with circle) were assigned to ZnO, suggesting the conversion of the ZIF-8 particles to ZnO during combustion [43]. Because ZnO is a thermally stable metal oxide, the thermal oxidative resistance of the residue will be thus enhanced which in turn will protect the underlying PVA matrix from degradation by oxygen and heat."
7,Conclusion,"In this study, ZIF-8 was synthesized and characterized using SEM, TGA/DTG, FTIR and XRD analyses. ZIF-8 was then added to PVA to enhance its flame retardancy. Moreover, the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels exhibited low thermal conductivity (0.0327–0.0363 W m−1 K−1), Young’s modulus of 0.309–0.316 MPa and a relatively low density of (0.155–0.159 g cm−3). The ZP3 achieved LOI value of 24.0% and UL-94 V-0 rating, demonstrating excellent flame retardancy. The MCC results further confirmed the enhanced flame retardancy of ZIF-8. Specifically, the PHRR and THR of the ZP3 hybrid aerogel reduced to 216.2 g cm−3 and 36.0 kJ g−1, respectively, corresponding to 44.2% and 12.8% reduction relative to the PVA aerogel. The improvements in the flame retardancy of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels can be attributed to formation of ZnO upon ZIF‐8 decomposition which enhanced the thermal oxidative resistance of the char residues. The combustion of PVA aerogel was thus restricted by the thermally-stable char residues through protecting the underlying PVA aerogel and restricting the release of combustible gases and heat transfer between aerogel and flame. According to the FT-IR, XRD, SEM, BET and TGA/DTG results, the strong interaction of ZIF-8 with PVA resulted in low thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, low peak and total heat release of the ZIF-8/PVA hybrid aerogels."
