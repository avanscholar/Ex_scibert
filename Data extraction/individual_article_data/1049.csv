0,Introduction,"With the increasing demand of food safety, the indicator film, which can provide real-time freshness information about dynamically changing food system, has been attracted much attention [1]. Synthetic chemical dyes have been widely applied in preparation of indicator film owing to their pH-responsive ability [2–4]. However, those dyes may be harmful to human health due to potential carcinogenicity [5]. Thus, natural colorants are in a high demand. Moreover, compared with other natural pigments like chlorophyll and curcumin, anthocyanins can exhibit more variety discolorations. Roselle is a non-toxic, environment friendly and ideal source for anthocyanins [6]. The roselle anthocyanin can perceive and present pH changes through visible color variations by its configuration change. Despite of its excellent pH-dependent property, few studies have developed indicator film incorporating roselle anthocyanin extracts (RAE) [7–9]. Since anthocyanins are sensitive to environmental factors [10], biodegradable polymers have been reacted as film-forming substrates to immobilize and protect pH-sensing dyes [11–13]. It is believed that the film characteristics are mainly determined by film matrix. Indicator film with outstanding performances is more highly acceptable, and researchers tend to obtain these films by blending modification [14,15]. However, blending may destroy certain film properties owing to incompatibility of film-forming components sometimes. Zhai et al., [7] and Zhang et al., [8] prepared RAE/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) indicator films incorporated with starch or chitosan, both films presented excellent hydrophobic properties, but relatively weak mechanical characteristics. Our previous study [9] confirmed the positive effects of hydroxypropyl methylecellulose (HPMC) on functional properties enhancement of PVA/RAE-based film. Although this study investigated the influences of different PVA/HPMC ratios on film performances, the interaction behaviors of different RAE contents on PVA/HPMC, which was important for film characteristics, were not fully understood. Generally, it is believed that natural anthocyanins can exert significant influences on properties of film matrix. Qin et al., [16] reported the generation of hydrogen bonds between cassava starch and Lycium ruthenicum Murr anthocyanins would significantly enhance the mechanical properties of indicator films. Jiang et al., [13] revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions among carboxymethyl-cellulose/starch and purple sweet potato anthocyanins would improve film tensile strength but decease the moisture contents, similar results were reported by Wu et al., [17]. Moreover, it is reported that different amounts of anthocyanins contents can exert different influences on film characteristics owing to the various force intensities [18–20]. Based on this, investigating interaction behavior and mechanism of anthocyanins on film matrix is critical for better functional film characteristics obtained. Recently, indicator films are usually prepared for qualitative freshness monitoring [2,8,10,11,18]. However, the monitoring effect which depends on the single film color variation is inaccurate. Because the minor film color changes (total color difference <5) caused by slight spoilage process cannot not be identified by naked eyes easily, leading to the delay or misjudgment of freshness. Therefore, the qualitative monitoring only can classify spoilage degree from a wide range, but cannot figure out accurate fresh stages and related spoilage chemical indexes (SCIs). Based on this, multiple mathematical models combined with qualitative and quantitative monitoring together are needed. Furthermore, investigating the statistical relationship between film color and certain packaged food can not only monitor freshness efficiently and accurately, but also provide a basic reference for other tested foods when monitored by similar indicator films. Nevertheless, studies on the establishment of mathematical models for qualitative and quantitative monitoring are limited. Therefore, in this study, an indicator film based on HPMC/PVA and RAE was prepared. The film structural properties were characterized, and the film-forming mechanism as well as inter-molecular interactions were illustrated. The interaction behaviors of RAE contents on functional properties, including physical, indication and active characteristics were studied. Moreover, the HPMC/PVA/RAE (PHR) films were applied to real-time shrimp freshness monitoring with the help of establishment of mathematical models."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Roselle and fresh vannamei (Penaeus vannamei, 12 ± 1 g), were purchased from local market (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China). Polyvinyl alcohol (CAS number 9002-89-5), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (substitution degree = 1.4, CAS number 9004-65-3) and other chemical reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were analytical grade."
3,Extraction of roselle anthocyanins,"2.2 Extraction of roselle anthocyanins Anthocyanins were extracted from roselle calyx according to Zhang et al., [8]. Roselle calyx (50 g) was dried at 25 °C for 4 h and pulverized into powders by a grinder, which were sieved through a 40-mesh screen. Then, the roselle powders were mixed with 500 mL of 50% ethanol in a water bath for 4 h at 30 °C. The solution was filtered and above extraction process was repeated twice again. Subsequently, the alcohol solution of roselle anthocyanins was concentrated by a rotary evaporator at 40 °C in dark. Finally, the solution was freeze-dried using a vacuum freeze dryer (Labconco, Beijing Light Ace HK Limited, China) to obtain RAE. The pH-differential method was applied to determine anthocyanin contents of RAE according to Merz et al., [11]. The average absorbance value of the extract was 0.213 and 0.062 at A520 nm and A700 nm (pH = 1.0), respectively, as well as 0.045 and 0.000 at A520 nm and A700 nm (pH = 4.5), respectively, and the total anthocyanin content was calculated to be 11.08 ± 0.57 mg/g. Furthermore, the obtained RAE was preserved at −20 °C in dark."
4,Preparation of PHR films,"2.3 Preparation of PHR films The ratio of PVA to HPMC was selected on the basis of our previous study, in order to obtain better functional properties of film matrix [9]. PVA (1.0 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water with magnetic stirring at 75 °C for 30 min firstly. Subsequently, 3.0 g of HPMC was added and stirred for 2 h under 30 °C to prepared films with the film-forming substrate concentration of 4% (w/v). RAE was added into the HPMC-PVA solution with different contents of 0.12%, 0.18% and 0.24% (w/v), followed by a constant stirring for 2 h. The PHR solutions were degassed by ultrasonic treatment, cast into a culture dish (diameter of 9 cm) and dried in an oven under 30 °C for 24 h. The obtained films were labeled as PHR-0.12/0.18/0.24, respectively, while the PVA-HPMC (PH) film was prepared as the same as above to be control group. All films were stored in a dark and dry place for further use."
5,Structural characterization of PHR films,"2.4 Structural characterization of PHR films A scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-8010, HITACHI Co., Ltd., Japan) was applied to observe film surface morphology. Films were broken in liquid nitrogen and coated with a layer of gold, then were observed with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) was carried out to investigate the intermolecular interactions by a spectrometer (AVA TAR370, NICOLET Co., Ltd., America) with a resolution of 2 cm−1 in the range from 4000 to 500 cm−1. To characterize the crystal phase of films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker AXS Co., Ltd., Germany) equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The XRD pattern was obtained from 5 to 80° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 5°/min."
6,Physical properties determination of PHR films,"2.5 Physical properties determination of PHR films 2.5.1 Thickness and mechanical properties Thickness was measured by a digital micrometer (CHY-C2A, Labthink Technology Co., Ltd., China) at 6 points of each film selected randomly. A tensile analyzer (XLW-M, Labthink Technology Co., Ltd., China) was applied to determine the mechanical properties, including tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB). The film strip (8 cm × 1 cm) was fixed with an initial grip distance of 40 mm and a strain speed of 25 mm/min. Each film was taken five replicates. 2.5.2 Hydrophobic properties The moisture content (MC) was determined by drying the film (initial weight was M1) to a constant weight (M2) at 105 °C and calculated as the following equation: (1) MC % = M 1 − M 2 / M 1 × 100 To determine the water solubility (WS), films (recorded initial weight Wi) were immersed into 50 mL of distilled water with constant shaking at 25 °C for 24 h. The distilled water was removed subsequently, and then the films were dried in an oven at 105 °C until reached constant weight (Wf). The WS was calculated as the following equation: (2) WS % = W i − W f / W i × 100 The Water contact angle (WCA) was determined by a video contact angle measuring equipment (OCA20, DATAPHYSI Co., Ltd., German). The distilled water was regarded as the test medium, and the one droplet volume was set to 3.5 μL. 2.5.3 Optical properties Light transmittance spectrum was investigated by a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The films were cut into strips (1 cm × 2 cm) and scanned in the range from 300 to 750 nm. The opacity was determined as the absorbance value of PHR film (at 600 nm) divided by film thickness."
7,Indication properties of PHR films,"2.6 Indication properties of PHR films 2.6.1 Color response ability Color response to ammonia: The responsive ability to ammonia was measured according to Kuswandi et al., [22] with some modifications. After adding 50 mL of NH3·H2O (8 mmol/L) into a flask (250 mL), the film (2 cm × 2 cm) was suspended above the ammonia solution about 1 cm for 24 min at 25 °C. The color indexes were obtained by a portable colorimeter (CM-3500d, Konica Minolta Co., Ltd., Japan) every 2 min. The control group was performed under the same condition while without the contact of ammonia compounds. Each group has three samples and the measurement was carried out six times for one group. The total color difference (∆E) was calculated as the following equation: (3) ∆ E = L − L 0 2 + a − a 0 2 + b − b 0 2 where L, a, b were the color indexes of film, while the L0, a0 and b0 were the initial values. Color response to pH changes: The films were cut into 2 cm × 2 cm, and after being immersed into different pH buffer solutions (pH 3–11) for 10 min, the color parameters were measured by a portable colorimeter. Each group has three samples and the measurement was carried out six times for one group, while the ∆E was calculated as Eq. (3). 2.6.2 Color stability The color stability was investigated based on the total color difference of films. To simulate the commercial storage environment, the films were stored with a humidity of 75% at different temperature (4 °C and 25 °C) for 20 d. The color indexes were collected every two days, each group has three samples and the measurement was carried out six times for one group, while the ∆E was calculated as the Eq. (3)."
8,Active properties of PHR films,"2.7 Active properties of PHR films The active properties were characterized by antioxidant and antibacterial activities, which were determined by DPPH scavenging ability and inhibition zone, respectively, according to our previous study [23]."
9,Application of PHR films on shrimp freshness monitoring,"2.8 Application of PHR films on shrimp freshness monitoring Indicator films (1 cm × 1 cm) were attached to the inner surface of petri dish (diameter 9 cm) containing one fresh shrimp, while control group was served as the PHR film without shrimps in the petri dish. To simulate commercial preservation environment, the samples were stored at 4 °C with 50% RH for 10 d. The color parameters and spoilage properties were measured every two days. Sensory evaluation was determined using a 9-point scale by 12 experienced panelists according to Azizi-Lalabadi et al., [24], and the sensory grades were as follows: 7–9: fresh, 4–6: onset of spoilage, 1–3: extremely spoilage. The pH values were measured by a pH meter (EF20K, Mettler Toledo Co., Ltd., China) according to Ezati et al., [21], and the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) contents were measured according to Wu et al., [23] with a semi-micro Kjeldahl distillation instrument."
10,Statistical analysis,"2.9 Statistical analysis All measurements were carried out in triplicate at least and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 (Statistics 20, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US). Statistical significance was estimated at P < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan test. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to distinguish the freshness grades according to film colors. Regression fitting model was applied to investigate the static correlation between film colors and spoilage degrees."
11,Results and discussions,
12,The microstructure properties analysis of PHR films,"3.1 The microstructure properties analysis of PHR films The microstructure properties were characterized by SEM, and the results were shown in Fig. 1 . As the Fig. 1 presented, the surface of PH film was smooth, suggesting the compatibility between PVA and HPMC. In addition, the PHR-0.12/0.18 films exhibited similar smooth surfaces, suggesting RAE could be distributed uniformly in the polymer matrix. It could be concluded that the addition of RAE would enhance the compatibility of film matrix, and the reason was related to the formation of strong interaction and adhesion between RAE and film-forming substrates. However, when the RAE concentration was up to 0.24%, the film presented a slight rough surface, which might be due to the formation of RAE agglomerates. The negative effects of high concentrations of anthocyanins were also reported in recent studies [16,25]."
13,The molecular interaction analysis of PHR films,"3.2 The molecular interaction analysis of PHR films The molecular interactions of film matrix were investigated by FT-IR, and the FT-IR spectrum were shown in Fig. 2(a) to demonstrate the substantial interaction in film matrix. The characteristic bands of PVA appeared at 3423 cm−1, 2941 cm−1 and 1092 cm−1, corresponding to the OH, CH and CO stretching, respectively, and the CH-CH2 stretching located at 1435 cm−1 could be associated with the basic carbon skeleton bending [7]. The typical band at 2932 cm−1 (CH stretching) in HPMC spectrum was ascribed to the presence of methyl group [14]. As for FT-IR spectrum of RAE, the absorption bands at 1740 cm−1, 1633 cm−1 and 1095 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of CO, CN and CO, respectively. In addition, a relative weak band was identified at 1791 cm−1, which was related to the stretching of pyran ring of flavonoid compounds. Meanwhile, the characteristic band at 1633 cm−1, which was assigned to the aromatic rings stretching, was observed in RAE and all RAE-based films, suggesting the well incorporation of RAE. Generally, the band positions would not be altered significantly due to the extremely low contents of anthocyanins introduced, and the slight changes might be related to the generation of new interactions in the film matrix. Notably, compared with characteristic band at 3405 cm−1 (OH stretching) in control group, the band in experimental groups moved to a higher wave number (3443 cm−1), owing to the generation of hydrogen bonds between RAE and polymers. The position variations of OH stretching band, which was resulted from the addition of anthocyanins, were also reported in many studies [13,16,25], indicating the formation of intermolecular interactions between indicators and substrates. Above results demonstrated that RAE was well immobilized in the PVA-HPMC film matrix by the generation of new interactions."
14,The crystalline structure analysis of PHR films,"3.3 The crystalline structure analysis of PHR films The XRD was performed to investigate the crystalline structure, and the patterns were shown in Fig. 2(b). PVA presented a diffraction peak around 2θ = 19.33°, which was resulted in the characteristic peak in PH films, corresponding to its semi-crystalline structure [26]. The diffraction peaks at 20.11° and 7.65° of HPMC profile were the symbol of its cellulose typeIIamorphous structure. The RAE exhibited a broad peak at 19.71°, which was also due to its amorphous structure. Notably, the diffraction peak at 7.65° of HPMC was not identified in PH and PHR films, suggesting the highly compatibility of PVA and HPMC, which was consistent with FT-IR analysis. In addition, the decreased peak intensities indicated that the crystalline degree decreased with the increasing amounts of RAE, which was attributed to the generation of hydrogen bonds between RAE and polymers, leading to the disordered internal structure. Qin et al., [16] also demonstrated the decrease of crystalline degree after the addition of red pitaya peel extract, owing to the disruption of polymer rearrangement by the formation of new interactions. Based on the structural characterization mentioned above, the formation mechanism and internal interaction of PHR films could be illustrated in Fig. 3 . That was, the -OH of HPMC would combine with the H on the molecular chain of PVA, forming a stable and ordered film-forming matrix network. Then, the RAE introduced would be immobilized into the matrix by the hydrogen bonds between the phenolic hydroxyl on itself and hydroxyl of HPMC or PVA."
15,Thickness and mechanical properties of PHR films,"3.4 Thickness and mechanical properties of PHR films The thickness, TS and EB of indicator films were shown in Table 1 . Thickness is one of the critical factors to determine the mechanical and other physical properties of films. The thickness varied from 15.90 ± 0.14 μm to 23.20 ± 3.35 μm with the increasing amount of RAE, indicating the generation of complex film matrix. As for the reason, the higher contents of RAE would contribute to higher solid contents in film-forming solution, leading to thicker films. In addition, the interaction between RAE and polymers was able to enhance the film density [14]. The similar phenomena were also reported in several films containing anthocyanins, such as blackberry pulp-based [27] or lycium ruthenicum murr anthocyanins-based films [16]. As the Table 1 shown, the RAE contents had significant influences (P < 0.05) on TS values. With the increasing RAE contents, the TS exhibited a dramatic growing tendency, which was due to the formation of hydrogen bonds, contributing to the stronger interfacial interaction. The results were accordant with the structural characterization results. However, studies reported that excessive anthocyanins contents would lead to a slight decrease of TS because of the disruption of structural network [16,17], suggesting the RAE contents chosen in this study were reasonable. On the contrary, EB were inversely proportional to the RAE contents, the value decreased by 27.27% with the increasing amounts of RAE from 0% to 0.24%. This downward tendency was related to the rigidity of natural anthocyanins, restricting the polymer chain movement. Generally, the decline in flexibility of film would contribute to more sensitive discoloration due to the fuller perception of films to pH changes."
16,Hydrophobic properties of PHR films,"3.5 Hydrophobic properties of PHR films As exhibited in Table 1, there was no significant difference among the MC of PH and PHR films. However, with the increase amounts of RAE contents, the slight decrease might be related to the formation of tighter network between RAE and film-forming substrates, limiting the ability of RAE to bind water. In addition, comparing starch-PVA-RAE-films, whose MC was varied from 18.50% to 25.21% [7], the MC in our study is relatively lower, suggesting the positive effects of HPMC to improve hydrophobic properties by the generation of new interactions. Water solubility, which was affected by various factors such as water diffusion, structural changes of films, could reflect water resistant capacity of film material [28]. The WS increased significantly from 14.71 ± 2.19% to 26.88 ± 3.91% (P < 0.05) as the increasing amount of RAE, which was accounted for an increase in the number of hydrophilic group for water absorption. Water contact angle was an intuitive indicator to evaluate film surface wettability, and it was generally considered that the larger WCA, the weaker hydrophilicity. As the data shown in Table 1, the larger amounts of RAE would contribute to lower WCA, indicating stronger hydrophilic properties. The results were accordant with water solubility, which might be associated with the structure of RAE. Roselle anthocyanins could exert an influence on film hydrophilic characteristic enhancement, owing to the extreme hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on its molecular chain. The similar results were also obtained in indicator films incorporated with red cabbage and purple sweet potato anthocyanins [25]."
17,Optical properties of PHR films,"3.6 Optical properties of PHR films The UV–vis spectra of film light transmittance were shown in Fig. 4 . The obvious bend of PHR film at the range from 500 nm to 600 nm was attributed to the flavylinm positive ions structure of RAE, contributing to the absorption behavior. Comparing PH and PHR films, the transparency was significantly reduced when RAE was introduced in the film matrix. Similar results were also investigated by Freitas et al., [10] and Ge et al., [11], indicating the significant influences of anthocyanin on the light transmittance performance. Furthermore, the light transmittance was remarkably decreased with the increased RAE contents, while the reason for the decrease was related to the aromatic rings in phenolic compounds of RAE, which could present well light absorption ability. In addition, the incorporation of RAE would alter the crystalline structure of PHR films, which was consistent with the XRD results, leading to light reflection and scattering [29]. In addition to the light transmittance, the opacity was also an effective way to evaluate film optical properties, and the results of opacity value for PHR films were exhibited in Table 1. As the Table 1 shown, as the increasing of RAE contents, the opacity value increased from 1.16 ± 0.23 to 15.48 ± 2.06, which was accordant with the light transmittance. It was believed that higher film opacity could prevent packaged food from visible and ultraviolet light, leading to the reduction of nutrition loss and the inhibition of oxidation process [5,10]."
18,Color response ability of PHR films,"3.7 Color response ability of PHR films Owing to the production of volatile basic compounds during the shrimp spoilage process, the discoloration of indicator film was associated with its ammonia response ability, thus the ability was critical for indication properties and evaluated by the total color difference (∆E). As the Fig. 5(a) shown, with the increasing contents of RAE, ∆E increased gradually and reached 49.04 ± 2.67, 51.67 ± 1.32 and 56.67 ± 1.32 for PHR-0.12, PHR-0.18 and PHR-0.24, respectively, and the time to reach the stage where the film color remained stable was more, ranging from 10 min to 12 min. In addition, as the Fig. S1 exhibited, the color differences of PHR films without ammonia contact remained similar levels, which were closely 0, indicating the discoloration was accounted for the production of ammonia compounds rather than the degradation of PHR film itself. Generally, an excellent indicator film possessed quick response ability. In comparison, the time was longer in RAE-based film incorporated with PVA and starch (16 min) [8], indicating the higher sensitivity to ammonia of PHR films. While the differences in sensitivity might be due to the various pH of film-forming substrates. As for the color variations, the color was red initially, and converted to green-blue finally. Notably, the discoloration degree was related to the ammonia amounts, if there were larger amounts of ammonia, the color would turn to yellow furthermore. The discoloration of ammonia-response assay was consistent with the pH-response assay (Fig. 5(b)), in which the film color changed from red to green as the increasing of pH values."
19,Color stability of PHR films,"3.8 Color stability of PHR films Considering the monitoring mechanism of indicator films was related to the film discoloration, the maintenance of original film color might influence the detection accuracy. Therefore, it was important to investigate the color stability of indicator films, and the results were presented in Fig. 6 . The ∆E continuously increased during the whole storage process because of the slight degradation of RAE, and the ∆E for films stored under 4 °C was lower than 25 °C, indicating the refrigerator environment could preserve anthocyanin properties better. Films with higher contents of RAE exhibited lower ∆E, suggesting its strong ability to maintain film color, which was attributed to the phenolic compounds of RAE [30]. As shown in Fig. 6, the color changes could not be identified by naked eyes because the ∆E values of all films were below 5 [31], indicating the well color stability of PHR films. The reason for color maintenance was associated with the compatibility between PVA and HPMC as demonstrated in structural characterization results, entrapping RAE into film matrix well, resulting in preservation of RAE properties."
20,Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of PHR films,"3.9 Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of PHR films Well antioxidant ability of packaging materials could protect food from oxidation and maintain food quality. The results of antioxidant capacity were exhibited in Fig. 7(a). The PH films presented the lowest DPPH radical scavenging of 5.44 ± 2.18%, indicating the negligible antioxidant capacity of film-forming substrates. The cellulose-derivative [32] or PVA [33] based films were reported to have slight antioxidant ability. As the Fig. 7(a) shown, the addition of RAE would significantly improve the antioxidant capability of PHR films, and the DPPH radical scavenging activity was proportional to contents of RAE. With the increase of RAE, the scavenging activity increased by 205.70%, 273.71% and 494.49%, respectively. Generally, the antioxidant capacity was related to the phenolic compounds [34]. The large amounts of RAE consisted of abundant phenolic hydrogen group structures, which were able to supply hydrogen atom to capture free radicals, contributing to the enhancement of antioxidant ability [32]. Additionally, the great compatibility of films could exert positive influences to the release of active compounds in RAE [35]. As the structural characterization results exhibited, the generation of new interaction and tight network could preserve the activity of RAE to some extent. The antibacterial ability was determined by the size of inhibitory zone against common foodborne pathogenic bacteria, such as S. aureus (Gram-positive) and E. coli (Gram-negative). The PH films exhibited minimal inhibitory zone, however, the appearance of inhibitory zone was attributed to the oxygen barrier property of PVA, leading to the inhibition of bacterial growth. The similar results were also recently reported [36], suggesting the PVA and HPMC did not possess outstanding antibacterial ability. As the Fig. 7(b) shown, the addition of RAE could efficiently enhance the antibacterial ability, indicating the antibacterial ability of films was mainly related to the functions of anthocyanins in RAE. As for the reason, anthocyanins would damage the cell membrane of microorganisms and disrupt the bacterial metabolisms, contributing to the release of bacterial contents and the decomposition of bacterial [37]. In addition, the RAE concentration-dependent antibacterial activity might be also related to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic property of film matrix. The higher the water solubility, the larger content of RAE was released, leading to the stronger antimicrobial property as a result. Notably, compared with E. coli, the PHR films displayed stronger antibacterial ability against S. aureus, which might be due to the differences in cell wall structure and metabolic mode of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial, and the different film antibacterial ability against different bacterial was also investigated in other researches [38,39]. Above results suggested that PHR films could be applied as intelligent films to preserve quality of packaged food."
21,Application of PHR films for shrimp freshness real-time monitoring,"3.10 Application of PHR films for shrimp freshness real-time monitoring To check the effects of real-time monitoring, PHR films were acted as indicator films and applied on shrimp freshness monitoring. Spoilage degrees were characterized by three chemical indexes firstly, and the results were shown in Table S1. Considering the limitation of freshness monitoring by single indicator, we applied hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to comprehensively analyze above chemical spoilage indexes to achieve classification of freshness grades. As the Fig. S2 exhibited, the freshness degrees could be identified as three main clusters, that were, freshness (0–2 d), onset of spoilage (4–6 d) and completely spoilage (8–10 d). The application of PHR films on freshness monitoring and discolorations of PHR films were shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2 . The PHR-0.12 could not exhibit obvious color changes after 4 d, while the PHR-0.18/0.24 presented similar tendency of color variations. As the Fig. 8 shown, both films displayed rose-red colors initially, then turned to light green colors at 4 d and light-yellow colors at 8 d, corresponding to the freshness degrees distinguished by HCA. Notably, the PHR films did not present visible color changes in blank control group (Fig. 8), suggesting the film discoloration was associated with the release of volatile compounds during shrimp spoilage rather than degradation of RAE. The Fig. 9 demonstrated the monitoring mechanism of PHR films. During the spoilage, shrimp would produce large amounts of total volatile basic nitrogen, including ammonia, trimethylamine (TMA) and diemethylamine (DMA). Those volatile nitrogen compounds were absorbed by PHR films and combined with the water restricted in the films to form NH3·H2O. The NH3·H2O was subsequently hydrolyzed to generate hydroxyl ions (OH−) and amine ions (NH4 +). Then the deprotonation of hydroxyl ions was responsible for the structural changes of RAE, contributing to color variations of films. As the Table S2 exhibited, the strongest correlation between film color indexes and SCIs was observed in PHR-0.24 (P < 0.05), suggesting its advantages in freshness real-time monitoring. Furthermore, in comparison to our previous study [9], we applied PCA which was developed on the basis of color indicators (L*, a*, b*, R, G, B) to achieve qualitative monitoring (Fig. 10 ). The data of PHR-0.12 could be divided into two groups, one is day 0, and the other one is days 2–10, however, this classification made no sense. The poor monitoring ability of PHR-0.12 was also confirmed by correlation analysis, which might be due to the lower contents of RAE. Compared with PHR-0.18, which could distinguish freshness degrades into “fresh” (0–2 d) and “spoilage” (4–10 d), the PHR-0.24 was able to present more diverse groups, that was, “fresh” (0–2 d), “onset of spoilage” (4–6 d) and “completely spoilage” (8–10 d), respectively, and the freshness grade classification was consistent with the results of HCA. Moreover, several mathematical models, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), were established to monitor freshness quantitatively, and we chose PHR-0.24 to carry out further analysis due to its better monitoring effects. As the Table 3 exhibited, the RMSE values of calibration and prediction set were relatively low, suggesting the outstanding predictive ability of constructed models. Meanwhile, the linear correlation regression of measured and predicted SCIs was also established. Most of the prediction values obtained by above multiple mathematical models were close to measured values, with higher R2 (nearly 1.0) and smaller RMSE values, indicating the feasibility of PHR films for freshness monitoring that all the constructed models could monitor and predict SCIs quantitatively and effectively according to the film color indexes."
22,Conclusion,"In this study, indicator films incorporated with HPMC reinforced PVA and RAE were developed and applied for shrimp freshness monitoring. In addition, the interaction behaviors of RAE on PVA/HPMC film matrix were also studied. The results of SEM, FT-IR and XRD indicated the RAE was well immobilized and dispersed in the film matrix by the formation of hydrogen bonds. Owing to the formation of hydrogen bonds between RAE and polymer matrix, the introduction of RAE could significantly enhance film thickness, mechanical properties, light barrier ability and color stability, while dramatically decreased the hydrophobic characteristics. In addition, the PHR film exhibited higher antioxidant and antibacterial activities with the increasing content of RAE. Considering the PHR films were sensitive to ammonia, they were applied on shrimp freshness monitoring. The observed distinguishable film colors of different spoilage degrees would contributed to the achievement of qualitative monitoring. Furthermore, the mathematical models were established between PHR film color and spoilage degrees for monitoring quantitatively. Therefore, the PHR films with well functional characteristics, could be applied on real-time shrimp freshness monitoring."
