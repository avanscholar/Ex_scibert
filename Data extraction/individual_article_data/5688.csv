0,Introduction,"Air pollution is a significant environmental risk to public health given industrial growth, expansion of urban area populations, and the related increase in motor vehicle use [1]. Over 90% of the world population was living in areas where ambient air quality levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) limits [2]. One major air pollutant is particulate matter (PM), which is a mixture of small solid particles and liquid droplets. It contains both organic and inorganic compounds, and some components can be cytotoxic and carcinogenic [3]. Exposure to elevated levels of PM, especially PM2.5 (particle aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 µm), can cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, since finer PM can penetrate deeply into lungs and bronchi [4,5]. It was estimated that ∼ 4.2 million premature deaths were attributed to PM2.5 in 2015, globally [6]. Besides, PM2.5 exhibit longer residence time in air than coarse particle, which enlarges its hazardous. Therefore, control and reduce PM level, especially PM2.5 level, is a pressing task [7]. To protect individuals from PM2.5 exposure, numerous studies have been conducted to develop air filters focusing on achieving higher filtration performance [8–17]. Among those studies, electrospinning is a technique commonly used to produce ultrafine nanofibrous filter [18,19]. Smaller fiber diameter could provide large surface area to capture PM2.5 [20,21], and also allows air molecules pass through due to slip-effect [22–24]. However, most filters have to be disposed once the filters are clogged, to avoid the high pressure drop resulted energy waste [25]. Non-reusable air filters have higher costs given one-use which requires more cumulative raw materials and the related energy consumption during the manufacturing process. Additionally, inappropriate disposal of waste filters may cause environmental issues as well [26,27]. Therefore, developing high-performance air filters with reusability has received increasing interests [28–34]. But most reusable air filters were prepared involving organic solvents. The flammable or toxic organic chemicals utilized during the manufacturing process could be harmful to both human health and environment [35]. Thus, it is necessary to further develop an environmentally friendly method to fabricate PM2.5 filters which can meet the requirements of both high filtration-performance and reusability. Our previous study successfully developed an electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) air filter with high PM2.5 removal efficiency and low air resistance [36]. Unlike other nanofibrous filters with ultrafine diameters, PVA/CNCs filters do not require additional mechanical support [37–39] due to the strength enhanced by CNCs [40,41]. The presence of CNCs also promoted the formation of finer fibers because CNCs increased the surface charge density of electrospinning solution [36,42,43]. The fabricating process is environmentally friendly because both PVA and CNCs are nontoxic, fully biodegradable and water-soluble. However, one common problem of air filters made from water-soluble polymers is that the filter is not stable in high-humidity environment and cannot be regenerated by water-washing after use. To improve the aqueous stability, maleic anhydride [38,44], formaldehyde [45] and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid [46] were used to crosslink PVA and CNCs. But the cross-linkers may create new environmental concerns [47,48]. The aim of this study is to develop a simple and green method to improve the aqueous stability of PVA/CNCs air filter without adding any new additives. In this study, a facile heat treatment method was investigated to convert the water-soluble electrospun PVA/CNCs air filter into water-resistant. Despite many studies have shown that water stable PVA materials could be prepared after heat treatment due to the increased crystallinity [49,50], few researches have been conducted to investigate the effect of heat treatment on water resistance of electrospun PVA/CNCs fibers. Since CNCs may act as nucleating agent and promote crystallization of PVA [51–53], it is expected that a water-proof PVA/CNCs filter could be obtained under a milder heating condition comparing with reported studies [49,50]. This study investigated the mechanism systematically and demonstrated the feasibility of regenerating the used electrospun PVA/CNCs filter for PM2.5 removal. It may provide a guidance on the cleaning and recycling strategies of CNCs-based electrospun filter for long-term usage."
1,Experimental section,
2,Materials.,"2.1 Materials. PVA (Mw 85000–124000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with degree of hydrolysis > 99%. CNCs (∼12 wt%, 5–20 nm in width, 150–200 nm in length, prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis) were obtained from the University of Maine (Orono, ME). Commercial window screens with 0.25 mm wire diameter and 1.2 mm × 1.2 mm mesh size were purchased from Saint-Gobain ADFORS (Clear Advantage). All chemicals and materials were used as received."
3,Electrospinning of PVA and PVA/CNCs nanofibrous filters.,"2.2 Electrospinning of PVA and PVA/CNCs nanofibrous filters. The suspensions of PVA and PVA/CNCs were electrospun to form nanofibrous filters as described in our previous work [36]. Briefly, PVA solution was prepared and specified amount of CNCs was added to obtain a CNCs percentage of PVA content is 20% (wt/wt), while total concentration was kept at 7 wt%. The amount of CNCs added into PVA was determined based on previous study to achieve best filtration performance [36]. PVA/CNCs suspension was mixed by a sonicator (VCF-1500, Sonics) in an ice bath for 2 min under 600 W of power. For comparison purposes, neat PVA solution was also prepared at 7 wt% and sonicated for 2 min. The obtained suspension was then loaded into a 5 mL plastic syringe with a 22-gauge needle. The flow rate of suspension was controlled at 0.5 mL h−1 by a syringe pump (NE-1800, New Era Pump System). Window screen was covered over a metal circular cylinder as a collector and placed at a working distance of 10 cm from the needle tip. The needle was connected to a voltage generator (Series EK, Glassman High Voltage) while the cylinder was grounded, and the operating voltage was set at 22 kV. The diagram of electrospinning set is shown in Fig. S1. Electrospinning was performed at room temperature and 50 ± 5% relative humidity. Electrospinning time of 6 min was applied to control the basis weight of the electrospun fibers to 60 mg m−2 [36]."
4,Heat treatment of electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs filters.,"2.3 Heat treatment of electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs filters. The heat treatment was conducted in an oven (Isotemp, Fisher Scientific). The prepared PVA and PVA/CNCs filters were heated at temperatures of 80, 100, 120 and 140 °C for 5 min, respectively. Then the samples were taken out to cool down at room temperature."
5,Morphology characterizations.,"2.4 Morphology characterizations. The morphology of all the heated and unheated filters was studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Auriga crossbeam workstation) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. All samples were gold coated by SPI sputter coating system before observation. Diameters were measured via SEM images and 50 fibers were evaluated for each filter."
6,Water resistance tests.,"2.5 Water resistance tests. The heat-treated filters were immersed in 20 °C deionized water for 8 h. Then the samples were transferred out and dried at room temperature. For comparison, the electrospun filters without heat treatment were also tested with the same procedure. All water immersed samples were then characterized by SEM."
7,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.,"2.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD analysis was carried out using a diffractometer (Empyrean, Panalytical) equipped with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected between 10 and 40° with a 0.05° step size. The degrees of crystallinity were calculated using the method of Hermans: X c = A c/A t (1) where X c is the crystallinity degree, A c is the sum of the signal areas of crystalline regions and A t is the total area of the diffractogram [51,54]. The crystal sizes (L) were estimated by Scherrer’s equation: L = Kλ/Bcosθ (2) where K = 0.94, λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm), θ is the Bragg angle and B is the full width at half maximum intensity of the diffraction peak [51]."
8,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).,2.7 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermal properties of prepared PVA and PVA/CNCs filters were analyzed by a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. The samples were placed in an aluminum pan and heated from 30 to 600 °C with a 10 °C min−1 heating rate.
9,Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)analysis.,"2.8 Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)analysis. All the electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs filters, before and after heat treatment, were analyzed by a FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum Two, Perkin Elmer) over a wavenumber range of 4000–500 cm−1. All spectra were collected with a resolution of 4 cm−1 after 16 scans."
10,Filtration performance of heated electrospun PVA/CNCs filters for PM2.5.,"2.9 Filtration performance of heated electrospun PVA/CNCs filters for PM2.5. The experiment setup for PM filtration is shown in Fig. S2. The filtration test followed the method described in our previous study [36]. Briefly, the fabricated filter was clamped between two Adams & Chittenden customized bottles with a sealing ring. PM particles were generated by burning incense, which are considered to be soft PM, due to its larger content of carbon and water than that of rigid inorganic PM [8]. The inflow concentration of PM2.5 was controlled to > 500 μg m−3 and the PM2.5 concentration was measured by a particle counter (DT-9851 M, CEM). Removal efficiencies (E) were calculated as: E (%) = (1 - C t /C 0) × 100 (3) where C t and C 0 are the measured outflow PM2.5 concentrations with and without filter, respectively. The air flow was generated by an air compressor and the flow rate was controlled at 0.2 m s−1 via flow meter. Pressure drops across the filters were measured by a Testo 510 differential pressure gauge. All tests were conducted in triplicate. To evaluate the overall performances of electrospun filters in terms of both removal efficiency and pressure drop, a quality factor, Q f, was used as an indicator. Q f is defined as: Q f = -ln(1-E)/ΔP (4) where E is PM removal efficiency and ΔP is pressure drop across the filter."
11,Regeneration of clogged filters.,"2.10 Regeneration of clogged filters. After recording the removal efficiency and pressure drop of the first filtration test, the inflow concentration of PM2.5 was elevated ∼ 400 times of 500 μg m−3. Therefore, the filters were clogged quickly and the reusability of the heated electrospun PVA/CNCs filters could be evaluated efficiently. The heavily fouled filters were then cleaned by immersed into 20 °C water and waggled mildly for 30 s. After drying at room temperature, the filters were applied for second filtration performance evaluation. This filtration-wash-dry cycle was repeated 5 times. All tests were conducted in triplicate."
12,Statistical analysis.,"2.11 Statistical analysis. The significance tests for the effect of heat treatment and water immersion on fiber diameter, effect of heat treatment on fiber crystallinity, and the effect of regeneration times on filter pressure drop, were evaluated by t-test using JMP software (version 14, SAS Institute). The differences between group means with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant."
13,Results and discussion,
14,Effect of heat treatment on water resistance of electrospun filter.,"3.1 Effect of heat treatment on water resistance of electrospun filter. The morphologies of the electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers are shown in Fig. 1 a and 1b. The average diameters of PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers are 207.6 and 130.7 nm, respectively (Table S1), indicating the addition of CNCs favored the formation of smaller-diameter fibers, which is consistent with our previous study [36]. After 140 °C heat treatment, the morphological features of both PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers remained unchanged (Fig. 1c and 1d). In addition, PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers treated at all the heating temperatures (80, 100, 120 and 140 °C) showed no significant diameter changes (Table S1). Therefore, the morphology and size of the electrospun fiber were not significantly changed by the heat treatment. All the prepared filters were then immersed in water for 8 h to evaluate their aqueous stability. Both the as-spun PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers were completely dissolved due to the hydrophilicity (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 2 , the PVA fibers became more water-resistant as heating temperature increased from 80 to 140 °C. Similar trend has also been observed for PVA/CNCs fibers. This could be attributed to that the heat treatment facilitated the mobility of polymer chains, and then the amorphous region of chains can align and fold to form crystallites [50]. With the increased crystallinity, the accessibility of infusion water to polymer structure is reduced and the water resistance of polymers is expected to be improved [55]. Although neither PVA nor PVA/CNCs fibers were completely dissolved after they were treated at 80 °C, their water stability is very limited and most of the air filter-morphological features were lost (Fig. 2a and 2e). Similarly, the 100 °C treated samples did not exhibit good water resistance either. The fibers were fused into membranes and bundles, though the PVA/CNCs fibers appeared to retain part of the characteristics of electrospun fibers (Fig. 2b and 2f). For the filters heated at 120 and 140 °C, the cylindrical feature of fibers was observed and the average diameter were measured to quantify the aqueous stability (Tables S1-S3). The average diameters of PVA fibers treated at 120 and 140 °C are 771.1 and 393.2 nm, respectively, after immersed in water. This swelling is due to absorption of water. However, with the addition of CNCs, the fibers were less swelled after water immersion, and the average diameters of PVA/CNCs fibers heated at 120 and 140 °C are 258.1 and 127.5 nm, respectively. From the t-tests, there is no significant diameter change between PVA/CNCs fibers before and after water immersion, as heated at 140 °C. As shown in Fig. 2h, the morphology of the PVA/CNCs fibers was completely conserved. Therefore, the water resistance of water-soluble electrospun filter is considerably enhanced by adding CNCs and heating at 140 °C for 5 min."
15,Characterizations of electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs filters.,"3.2 Characterizations of electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs filters. The XRD patterns of PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers heated at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 . The peak at 2θ = 19.5° is corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane of PVA (Fig. 3a). For the PVA/CNCs fibers, the new shoulder peak appeared at 2θ = 22.2° is due to the (2 0 0) plane of CNCs (Fig. 3b) [56]. The small signals at 14.8° and 16.8° also indicate the presence of CNCs, which are attributed to the (1 0 1) and (10 1 - ) planes, respectively (Fig. 3b) [51]. Since CNCs are primarily consist of crystalline domain and have restricted chain mobility, their crystallinity degrees and crystal sizes are considered relatively unchanged at each heat treatment level. The average crystallinity degree of the unheated PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers were 54.7% and 59.6%, respectively. By applying heat treatment and increasing the heating temperature from 80 to 140 °C, the crystallinity degree of PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers both increased gradually and achieved the highest value of 73.7% and 85.4%, respectively (Table 1 ). This is consistent with previous results of water resistance test. Higher heating temperature provided more polymer chains mobility and facilitated the formation of crystallinities (Tables S4 and S5). The crystal sizes calculated in Table 1 were based on the peaks of PVA (1 0 1) plane. As shown in Table 1, the crystal size of PVA in PVA fibers was increased from 3.3 ± 0.1 nm to 4.9 ± 0.1 nm after a 140 °C heat treatment. This additionally proved that heat treatment effectively promoted the crystallization of PVA (Table S6). Similarly, the heat treatment also significantly promoted the growth of PVA crystals in PVA/CNCs fibers (Table S7). By adding CNCs into the PVA, the crystallinity degree of as-spun fibers increased ∼ 5%. As the heating temperature increased from 80 to 140 °C, the differences of crystallinity degrees between PVA/CNCs and PVA fibers at each heat treatment level are 4.8 ± 1.6%, 7.6 ± 1.8%, 10.8 ± 2.1% and 11.7 ± 0.9%, respectively. This rising tendency of the difference of crystallinity degrees implied a combined effect of heating and CNCs, indicating CNCs promoted the crystallization of polymer matrix (Table S8). Comparing the crystal size between PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers (Table 1), it also shows that the presence of CNCs significantly promoted the growth of PVA crystals under same heating condition (Table S9). This could be explained by the nucleating effect. The CNCs could act as nucleating agents and provide additional nucleation sites for PVA crystallization [51–53]. It is noticed that several previous researches stated that adding CNCs into PVA could cause decrease of crystallinity degree [57–59]. Two mechanisms were proposed: (1) randomly distributed CNCs may decrease the PVA nucleation and disorder the polymer chains; (2) CNCs may connect to each other and form a percolating network, which prevents the growth of polymer spherulites. These researches may provide evidence that CNCs in this study are not aggregated and are well dispersed in the PVA matrix. Since electrospinning process could facilitate the orientation of CNCs along the PVA/CNCs fiber axis and increase the alignment of both PVA and CNCs [36,60], it is feasible that well aligned CNCs could effectively promote the crystallization of PVA. To further investigate the effect of heat treatment on electrospun PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers, thermogravimetric tests were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4 , PVA/CNCs fibers started losing weight at 150 °C, which is lower than 190 °C of PVA. This initial mass loss (∼5 wt%) could be attributed to the degradation of hydroxy groups and sulfate groups of CNCs [61]. The onset temperature of first decomposition region of PVA fibers is 210 °C and the peak temperature is 255 °C (Fig. 4b). This stage of decomposition is mainly corresponding to elimination reactions; and the second stage of degradation occurred above 400 °C involving carbonaceous matter decomposition caused by chain-scission reactions [56]. By adding CNCs, the onset and peak temperatures of decomposition of PVA/CNCs fibers both shifted to higher temperatures (225 °C and 330 °C, respectively), indicated that CNCs enhance thermal stability of the composite material. According to previous studies, the enhanced thermal stability of the composite was resulted by the hydrogen bond formed between PVA and CNCs [56,62,63], which is consistent with the results of XRD analysis. The PVA/CNCs fibers lost more weight than PVA fibers under 400 °C could be attributed to the decomposition of CNCs [62,64]. For both PVA and PVA/CNCs fibers, no obvious weight loss was observed before 140 °C. This indicated that bound water is less contained after electrospinning, and the increased degree of crystallinity was not caused by eliminating the water molecules within the amorphous region of polymers. The FTIR spectra collected for PVA and PVA/CNCs filters with different heat treatment are shown in Fig. 5 . In the spectra of PVA filters, the strong absorption peak at 1094 cm−1 is due to C-O stretching and O–H bending; the peaks at 2942 and 2910 cm−1 are the typical C–H stretching from alkyl groups; and the broad band from 3200 to 3550 cm−1 is corresponding to the stretching of O–H from intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5a) [64,65]. For PVA/CNCs filters, the additional peak observed at 1059 cm−1 is assigned to the C-OH stretching of cellulose (Fig. 5b) [66]. By adding CNCs, there is no shift in the PVA peaks. It was noticed a change in shape of band from 3200 to 3550 cm−1 was caused by the presence of CNCs. This could be attributed to the formed hydrogen bond between PVA and CNCs [58]. As heating temperature increased from 80 to 140 °C, the intensity of peak at 1143 cm−1 in the spectra of PVA filters increased gradually (Fig. 5a). This peak is assigned to the stretching of the C–O associated with the crystalline parts of the polymeric chain [67,68]. The increased peak intensity indicated an increase in crystallinity degree, which is consistent with the previous XRD results. Similar results have also been observed for PVA/CNCs filters. For all the FTIR spectra, no newly formed C-O-C or C = C bonds were observed [44]. The FTIR analysis results indicated there is no intermolecular or intramolecular etherification occurring with heat treatment under 140 °C [69]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the enhanced water resistance of heat-treated filters is achieved solely due to the increased crystallinity. The inference based on FTIR results can be further proved by immersing the heated filters in hot water. The 140 °C heated PVA/CNCs filter was dissolved completely after immersion in 80 °C water for 8 h, demonstrating there is no strong chemical bond (e.g. C-O-C, C = C) formed between PVA and CNCs. The elevated temperature promoted the infusion of water and facilitated the accessibility of water molecules to polymers structure. It is worth mentioning that the 140 °C heated PVA/CNCs filter could be dissolved after placed in 60 °C for 10 min with vigorous stirring. This feature might be an advantage for recycling the window screen substrate since the procedure is simple."
16,Regeneration of clogged electrospun PVA/CNCs filters.,"3.3 Regeneration of clogged electrospun PVA/CNCs filters. To evaluate the capability of repetitive usage of heated PVA/CNCs filter, the 140 °C treated PVA/CNCs filter was used for the test of PM removal. For the first filtration test, the removal efficiency for PM2.5 was ∼ 96%, and the pressure drop was ∼ 60 Pa. As our previous study demonstrated, the addition of CNCs dramatically improved the overall filtration performance of PVA/CNCs filter. The fiber diameter was reduced as CNCs increased the surface charge density of electrospinning solution. Therefore, the thinner fibers increased the specific surface area to volume ratio of the filter and improved the PM removal efficiency. In addition, filters with smaller fiber diameter possess higher filter medium porosity, which allows air molecules to pass through more easily. After a filtration of ultra-high concentration of PM (∼400 times of 500 μg m−3), the filter was clogged by ‘oily substance’ (Fig. 6 a). Since burning incense produces PM, volatile organic compounds and gaseous pollutants [70,71], the generated PM contains large amount of carbon and water. This type of PM is considered as soft PM, which is more difficult to be captured than rigid inorganic PM [8]. The PM deformed and wrapped around the nanofibers after contact, and then formed bead-shaped particles on the fibers [36]. Besides, the PM particles can also directly attach to the PM already captured on the fiber and merge together. As the captured PM became bigger and filled the pores, it formed a membrane-like structure and clogged the air filter (Fig. 6a). Regeneration of the PVA/CNCs filter was then managed by a water washing for 30 s. As shown in Fig. 6b, most of the attached particles were washed off and the morphological features of the filter was clear and well maintained. As shown in Fig. 6c, small amount of particles remained on the fibers after water washing. These residuals could be explained by the affinity between the carbon content of PM and fiber surface. Considering the captured organic PM is more difficult to be cleaned than inorganic PM [32], our electrospun filters is promising for removal of PM generated from different sources. The pressure drop of the PVA/CNCs filter was significantly increased to ∼ 1000 Pa from 60 Pa, when the filter was clogged with massive PM (Fig. 6a). After first cleaning, the pressure drop was recovered to 77 Pa (Fig. 6b). As shown in Fig. 7 a, the removal efficiency for PM2.5 was maintained consistently (>95%) after 5 filtration cycles, indicating the filtration efficiency was not affected by regeneration. However, the pressure drop was significantly increased to 94 Pa (Table S10). This could be attributed to the accumulated residual PM on the fibers. Since the PM concentration was elevated ∼ 400 times for quick filter blocking in this regeneration evaluation, the lifetime of this PVA/CNCs filter is expected to be considerably long. The quality factor (Q f) was also employed to evaluate the overall performance of fabricated air filter after each filtration cycle. Although the pressure drop was increased by 156.7% after 5 cycles, it was still less than 100 Pa. The Q f of regenerated filter after 5 cycles remained above 0.035 Pa−1, which is comparably superior [36]."
17,Conclusions,"In this study, a reusable PVA/CNCs filter with outstanding PM2.5 filtration performance was developed via electrospinning and facile heat treatment. Without adding any crosslinking agent, the environmentally friendly water-soluble filter was converted to be completely waterproof in room temperature water by heating at 140 °C for 5 min. The CNCs and heat treatment synergistically improved the crystallinity of PVA polymers. Given that the amount of added CNCs is small, the heating temperature is low, and the heating time is short, the results imply a cost-effective manufacturing process for the production of electrospun PVA/CNCs nanofibrous filters. A thirty second immersion in water at room temperature also effectively recovers its filtration capability, which is an easy and low-cost solution for household use. This PVA/CNCs filter is promising for PM removal with its low cost and superior reusability. Furthermore, the filter can be strategically dissolved with 60 °C water, which means the filter substrate can be easily recycled. With proper treatment, the dissolved PVA and CNCs might be reutilized as well."
