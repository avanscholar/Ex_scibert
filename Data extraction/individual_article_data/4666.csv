0,Introduction,"As the most important and widely used metal oxide materials, ceria, zirconia and their solid solutions have a variety of applications as catalysts or catalyst supports [1–4], owing to unique structure, thermal and chemical stability, corrosion resistance, ion exchange capability and tunable acid−base property. Usually, the type of supports can play a crucial role in heightening catalytic performances of catalysts by the enhancement in both the dispersion of active components and the interactions between active species and supports [5]. Specially, it was reported, when an optimum amount of zirconium was introduced into the lattice structure of ceria, that ceria-zirconia solid solutions formed possessed significantly enhanced properties including redox behavior, thermal stability, structural defects, and mobility/storage capacity of oxygen [6,7]. Up to now, many efforts have been made to prepare tetravalent metal oxide nanocrystals (e.g., CeO2, ZrO2) by means of various approaches including sol–gel procedure [8], templating route [9], hydrothermal/solvothermal method [10,11], and microemulsion process [12]. However, in most cases, complex procedures and equipment, as well as expensive or deleterious organic reagents, need to be provided, which is disadvantageous to their practical applications in terms of economical and environmental sustainability. Additionally, these oxides often present low specific surface areas and irregular or broad particle size distributions. Currently, we have explored the synthesis of ZrO2 with high surface area of ∼275m2/g by a solution-phase approach involving rapid nucleation and following hydrothermal process [13]. On the other side, selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to produce unsaturated allylic alcohols (UAA) is an important process for the production of a variety of fine chemicals including cosmetics, flavors, spices and pharmaceuticals [14]. From the point of view of thermodynamics and kinetics, the hydrogenation of CO bond is more difficult than that of conjugated CC bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes because of higher activation barriers. Therefore, highly selective production of UAA still remains a challenge [15–17]. Typically, industrially important unsaturated cinnamyl alcohol (COL) can be produced by selectively hydrogenating cinnamaldehyde (CAL) having degree of unsaturation (i.e., aromatic ring, CO and conjugated CC double bonds). For the hydrogenation of CAL, the realization of the improvement in the selectivity toward the CO bond rather than the CC bond in the side aliphatic chain bears a realistic and research significance. Commonly, precious metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh) are considered as catalysts of choice for hydrogenating α, β-unsaturated aldehydes [18–20]. However, the selectivity toward the CC bond using hydrogen as a reducing agent always is high. Among them, Pt-based catalysts are most deeply and extensively investigated, due to relatively higher activity and selectivity to UAA. To further improve the selectivity toward CO bond, various catalyst systems also have been screened widely, either by finely turning the particle sizes and morphologies of catalysts [21,22] or by incorporating a second metal as an electronic or structural promoter, despite the decrease in the activity [23,24]. In addition, the interactions between metals and supports play crucial roles in governing catalytic performance [25,26]. The problems often arising are the low UAA selectivity attained at high conversion levels and the poor stability of catalysts originating from the agglomeration of metal nanoparticles (NPs) during the reaction. In most cases, alkali additives (e.g., NaOH) are added into reaction medium to suppress side reactions or promote the adsorption of carbonyl group in reactant molecules [25]. Additional alkali may bring out several disadvantages, such as environmental pollution, the difficulties in separation and recycling, and corrosion issue. Therefore, designing and developing a satisfactory supported catalyst with both high activity and high UAA selectivity has become an important issue in the field of selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Inspired by previous pioneering researches, herein, we reported the synthesis of high-surface-area CeO2-ZrO2 composites with micro/mesoporous structures by a low temperature solution-phase method without the use of any additional templates and surfactants. The resulting supported Pt catalysts over CeO2-ZrO2 composites were employed in the base-free selective hydrogenation of CAL to produce COL. Furthermore, a deep insight on the influence of surface structures on the catalytic behavior of catalysts was investigated in detail."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of supported Pt catalysts,"2.1 Synthesis of supported Pt catalysts Ceria-zirconia composites were prepared by a low-temperature solution-phase method developed by our group [13]. Typically, solution A: Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O with the Zr/(Ce+Zr) molar ratio of x:3 (x =1, 1.5, 2) and a total metal concentration of 0.05M were dissolved into deionized water (80mL). Solution B: NaBH4 with the NaBH4/(Ce3++Zr4+) molar ratio of 15:1 was dissolved in deionized water (80mL). Then, above two solutions were rapidly added to a colloid mill at a rotor speed of 3000rpm and mixed for 2min. Subsequently, the resulting suspension was transferred into 250mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclaves and aged at 150°C for 24h, and then filtered and washed several times with deionized water until pH value reaches 7.0. At last, obtained ceria-zirconia composites (denoted as CeZrO2-x) were dried at 70°C overnight. In addition, pristine CeO2 (or ZrO2) was prepared according to the above same procedure without the addition of Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (or Ce(NO3)3·6H2O). Supported Pt catalysts with the Pt loading of about 5.0% were synthesized by liquid-phase reduction method. First, H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.066g) was dissolved in 50mL of deionized water containing the support (0.5g) and poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP, 0.03g). Then, the resulting mixture was stirred for 30min. Subsequently, NaBH4 with the NaBH4/Pt molar ratio of 15:1 was added into the above suspension and maintained for 4h at 25°C under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, supported Pt catalysts were collected by filtration, washed and dried at 70°C overnight under vacuum. For comparison, CeZrO2-1.5 supported Pt catalyst (Pt/CeZrO2-1.5-NP) was also synthesized in the absence of PVP."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of samples were gained from a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with the applied condition of 40mV and 30mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.15418nm). Elemental analysis data was acquired using a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL 2100 instrument with the accelerating voltage of 80–200kV. The size distributions of metal particles were estimated from more than 200 particles. The average particle size of particles (D) was deduced based on the following Eq. (1): (1) D = ∑ i n i d i 3 ∑ i n i d i 2 where ni is the number of particles with the diameter of di. Low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorptometer apparatus. The specific surface areas were evaluated by the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Pore size distributions were determined by the nonlocal Density Functional Theory (NL-DFT) model for micropores and the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method for mesopores applied to desorption isotherms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected from a VG ESCALAB 2201 XL spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation (1486.6eV) at the vacuum of 6.7×10−8 Pa. Binding energies were calibrated according to graphite C 1s peak at 284.6eV. Carbon monoxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD) experiments were conducted on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). First, reduced sample (100mg) was sealed in the quartz tube reactor in the mixture gases of CO and Ar (1:9, v/v) and heated at 400°C for 1h. Subsequently, the sample was purged in Ar at 500°C for 30min, and then cooled down to 25°C. Finally, the sample was degassed by heating up to 500°C under an Ar environment (40mLmin−1) at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. Based on the CO chemisorption capacity, the apparent dispersion of Pt (Dis, %) was calculated. The Pt/CO stoichiometric factor is taken as 1:1. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were tested on ChemiSorb 2720 with a TCD. First, the reduced sample (100mg) was heated to 200°C in He flow (40mLmin−1) and held for 1h. When the temperature was cooled down to 25°C, NH3 was introduced into the quartz tube reactor for 1h. Subsequently, the sample was purged in He flow for 1h. Finally, the temperature was increased to 800°C at a rate of 5°Cmin−1. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were conducted on a Thermo Fisher TPDRO-1100 chemical adsorption instrument with a TCD. The reduced sample (30mg) was heated to 200°C in He flow (40mLmin−1) and held for 1h. TPO was performed in a stream of 10% v/v O2/He at a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 from 30°C to 700°C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies of CO adsorbed on catalysts were performed on a Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR instrument spectrophotometer. The sample powder was pressed into a self-supporting wafer (50mg) and mounted into IR cell. The cell was purged with a N2 flow and heated to 70°C and maintained for 1h. After cooling down to 25°C, pure CO was continuously introduced into the chamber at 10ml/min for 2h. FT-IR spectra were collected under vacuum. In situ FT-IR spectra of CAL adsorbed on catalysts were obtained from Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR instrument spectrophotometer. Firstly, the sample powder was pressed into a self-supporting wafer (50mg) and dried at 80°C for 12h under vacuum. Then the wafer was soaked in pure CAL liquid and kept for 24h. Subsequently, the wafer was dried again at room temperature for 12h under vacuum. Finally, the wafer was mounted into IR cell, which was purged with a He flow and maintained for 4h. The FT-IR spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400cm−1."
4,Selective hydrogenation of CAL,"2.3 Selective hydrogenation of CAL Liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of CAL was conducted in a 100mL stainless steel autoclave with a magnetic stirrer, where was charged with CAL (2.8mmol), ethanol (10mL), and the catalyst (0.02g). Firstly, air was flushed out of the reactor with nitrogen. Subsequently, the reactor was placed in an oil bath and heated to a certain temperature under atmospheric pressure. Finally, H2 was fed into the reactor at 1.0MPa and the reaction was initiated by starting stirring. In the course of hydrogenation, the pressure was kept constant by supplying hydrogen continuously from a gas cylinder through a pressure regulator, and the external particle mass transfer limitation was negligible when conducting the above experiments at an agitation speed above 900rpm. The liquid products were analyzed by an Agilent GC7890B gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector and HP-5 capillary column (30.0m×0.25mm×0.25μm) using benzyl alcohol as an internal standard. In all cases, the carbon balance was above 97%. The products were further identified by Shimadzu QP 2010 GC–MS detector with a DB-5 column (30.0m×0.32mm×0.25μm). The used catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, washed with acetone for three times and then with distilled water for several times. Finally, the recovered catalyst was dried at 70°C overnight and employed for the next test."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Structural characterization,"3.1 Structural characterization According to the XRD patterns of supported Pt samples (Fig. 1 ), a cube fluorite-type CeO2 phase (JCPDS No.43-1002) is found in the case of Pt/CeO2 [27], while a tetragonal ZrO2 phase (JCPDS No.42-1164) is formed in the case of Pt/ZrO2 [28]. With the gradual incorporation of smaller Zr4+ ions, the diffractions for (220) and (311) planes of CeO2 phase gradually shift toward higher 2θ values, due to the lattice contraction. Accordingly, the XRD patterns of ceria-zirconia composites formed show typical characteristics of a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases, due to the formation of CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions in the form of different crystalline structures. However, no characteristic (111), (200) and (220) diffractions related to metallic platinum are found, as a result of the highly dispersive nature of Pt species, as well as the small crystalline size. Fig. 2 shows TEM and HRTEM images of supported Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2 samples. Obviously, some dark NPs of around 4–6nm in size are dispersed on the support. Note that the average size of Pt NPs was about 4.6nm for Pt/CeO2 and 4.7nm for Pt/ZrO2. Further HRTEM observations depict the clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.310nm and 0.293nm for the (111) plane of cubic CeO2 phase and the (101) plane of tetragonal ZrO2 phase, respectively. Meanwhile, in two cases, another lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of about 0.226nm are indexed to the preferentially exposed (111) plane of metallic Pt. Fig. 3 depicts TEM and HRTEM images of representative Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 sample. Similarly, a large number of Pt NPs of around 4.3nm in size are highly dispersed on the support. Besides the clear lattice fringes for the (111) plane of metallic Pt phase, the lattice fringes for the (101) plane of composite phase can be observed. The textural properties of supported Pt samples were studied through nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements (Fig. 4 A). Obviously, all samples present a combined isotherm of I-type and IV-type with a hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.4–0.8, indicative of the presence of both micropores and mesopores in samples. Compared with single oxides supported samples (Table 1 ), CeO2-ZrO2 composites supported ones possess higher specific surface areas, as a result of the formation of porous network composed of small nanocrystals. Especially, Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 has a remarkably high specific surface area of ∼399m2/g. Furthermore, the pore size distributions of samples reveal that most of the pores originating from the interparticulate voids locate in the pore diameter range of 1–10nm (Fig. 4B). Here, high surface area of CeO2-ZrO2 composites, as well as abundant porous structure, greatly facilitates the dispersion of Pt NPs on the surface. XPS were examined to gain insight into the electronic structures of Pt species in supported Pt samples (Fig. 5 ). In each case, Pt 4f region corresponding to two spin-orbit components of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 core levels is deconvoluted into two pairs of doublets, which are associated with metallic Pt0 species and cationic Pt2+ species, respectively [25,29]. Table 2 summarizes the binding energy (BE) and relative abundance of different Pt species. One can note that the there are similar value of about 3.2eV for the spin orbital splitting and the peak area ratio of Pt 4f 5/2 to Pt 4f 7/2 (0.75) in each case, well consistent with those previously reported in the literature. The high proportion of surface Pt0 species demonstrates that most of Pt species are reduced, and Pt atoms can interact with surface oxygenated groups and the other sites of the support to form stable Pt2+ species [30]. In addition, with the increasing Zr content, the BE value of Pt0 species presents a large negative shift of about 0.8eV from Pt/CeO2 to Pt/CeZrO2-2, indicative of the occurrence of the electron transfer from the support to Pt0 species due to strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), thereby leading to the formation of electron-rich Pt0 atoms. Fig. 6 A presents fine Ce 3d spectra of supported samples, where two broad “V” and “U” regions corresponding to 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 core levels can be deconvoluted into four pairs of spin–orbit doublets [31–33]. The labeled three pairs of doublets (Vo, Uo), (V″, U″) and (V′″, U′″) are associated with Ce4+ species representing different unoccupied 4f0 configurations in the final state [34], while another pair of doublets (V′, U′) are ascribed to Ce3+ species representing 4f1 states [35,36]. Correspondingly, surface Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) molar ratios based on the integral areas of Ce 3d spectra are also listed in Table 2. Noticeably, with the addition of Zr, the proportion of Ce3+ species increases gradually and reaches the maximum (0.37) in the case of Pt/CeZrO2-1.5. As the Zr content further increases, the proportion of Ce3+ species inversely reduces to 0.26. It indicates that more Ce3+ species exist on the surface of CeZrO2-1.5. As shown in Fig.6B, fine Zr 3d spectra present two diversified peaks at about 181.3eV and 184.6eV, respectively, which correspond to 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 core levels of Zr4+ species. The gradual decrease in the BE value of Zr 3d signals with the increasing Ce content in samples can be ascribed to the formation of Zr-O-Ce bonds. As for ZrO2 supported sample, the BE value of Zr 3d 5/2 is much smaller than that for pure ZrO2 phase (182.9eV) [37], reflecting the presence of a large amount of oxygen vacancies as electron donors. Further, the O 1s core level was analyzed to identify surface defects. As shown in Fig. 6C, the fine O 1s spectra can be fitted with two components centered at about 530.3eV (referred as OI) and 532.2eV (referred as OII), which are ascribed to lattice oxygen and defect-oxide or surface oxygen-containing species (i.e., oxygen vacancies or hydroxyl-like group), respectively [38–40]. It is interesting to note that the intensity ratios of surface OII species to total oxygen species increases gradually from 0.21 to 0.37 with the increasing Zr content, indicative of the increased amounts of defect-oxide or surface hydroxyl-like species. As a result, it is expected that both oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ defects as electron donors are beneficial to the formation of electron-rich Pt0 atoms in supported samples. Surface acidity of supported Pt samples was analyzed by NH3-TPD (Fig. 7 ). It is well known that in the NH3-TPD profiles, the position and the area for NH3 desorption peak are related to the strength and the amount of surface acid sites. In each case, there are three desorption regions centered at approximately 127–160°C (I), 300–390°C (II) and 443–551°C (III), respectively, which are assigned to NH3 desorption from weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, moderate strength Lewis acid sites and strong Lewis acid (SLA) sites [41]. It is seen that the densities of total acid sites and SLA sites based on unit mass of samples increase in the order Pt/CeO2 <Pt/CeZrO2-1<Pt/CeZrO2-1.5<Pt/CeZrO2-2<Pt/ZrO2 (Table 1). Noticeably, the density of total acid sites for Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 based on unit BET specific surface area of samples is lower than those for other four samples, mainly due to its much higher surface area. Nevertheless, the change in the density of strong Lewis acid sites for samples based on unit surface area shows the same trend as that in the density of strong Lewis acid sites based on unit mass of samples, which is correlated with the presence of more surface Zr4+ species with the increasing Zr/(Zr+Ce) molar ratio in samples. Interestingly, the densities of total acid sites based on unit mass of present supported samples are almost four times larger than those of other similar samples previously reported [28], which should be associated with the high surface area of present composite supports and uniform distribution of Zr4+ species in the structure of composites."
7,Catalytic performance of supported Pt catalysts,"3.2 Catalytic performance of supported Pt catalysts Due to the presence of concomitant CC group and conjugated CO group in CAL, there exists several reaction pathways in the course of selective CAL hydrogenation, thus typically generating diverse hydrogenation products (Scheme 1 ). Firstly, the CO group and the CC group in CAL can be hydrogenated to COL and hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL), respectively. Subsequently, further hydrogenation of COL and HCAL forms hydrocinnamyl alcohol (HCOL). However, in some cases, other small amounts of undesired by-products can be formed by aldol condensation of acetals. Supported catalysts were investigated for the selective hydrogenation of CAL under the identical reaction conditions. Fig. 8 depicts the evolution of the CAL conversion and the product selectivities as a function of reaction time over the representative Pt/CeZrO2-1.5. Notably, the reaction profile presents a sharp increase in the CAL conversion in the initial reaction period. The CAL conversion reaches about 95% after 30min and then slowly increases to 98% at 2h. Meanwhile, the COL selectivity decreases gradually in the total reaction period of 2h. A high COL selectivity of 94% at 95% CAL conversion is achieved after 30min. However, the selectivity to saturated HCOL also increase rapidly to 25% after 2h, reflecting a thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of the CC bond. Table 3 summaries the catalytic hydrogenation results over different catalysts. It is noted that composite supports affect both the CAL conversion and the product selectivities. In each case, high COL selectivities (>79%) can be achieved. Noticeably, a high COL yield of 89.3% is delivered over the Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 after 30min. As for other CeO2-ZrO2 composites supported catalysts, the CAL conversion reduces to 85% for Pt/CeZrO2-1 and 81% for Pt/CeZrO2-2, respectively. And, single oxides supported catalysts show low CAL conversions of 80% for Pt/CeO2 and 59% for Pt/ZrO2. Compared with Pt/CeO2 and Pt/CeZrO2-1, Pt/CeZrO2-1.5, Pt/CeZrO2-2 and Pr/ZrO2 yield high COL selectivities (>94%) at 30min. The above results demonstrates that in spite of the same conversion levels over Pt/CeZrO2-2 and Pt/CeO2, hydrogen molecules more easily access to the CO bond in the case of Pt/CeZrO2-2, thereby resulting in an increased COL selectivity. On the other hand, as listed in Table 3, Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 yields a very high TOF value of 10423h–1, which is about 2.3 times higher than that for Pt/ZrO2. Compared with other Pt-based catalysts previously reported [16,25,42–47], the present Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 delivers much higher catalytic activity and better COL selectivity. In addition, it is found that Pt/CeZrO2-1.5-NP sample exhibits a lower catalytic performance under the identical reaction conditions, with a 78% CAL conversion and a COL selectivity of 94%, compared with Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 catalyst. It suggests that the addition of a small amount of PVP in the course of catalyst preparation may facilitate the uniform dispersion of Pt NPs on the support. Further, in order to determine the presence of carbon on the catalyst surface, TPO experiments of Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 and Pt/CeZrO2-1.5-NP samples were conducted (Fig. 9 ). Noticeably, only oxygen consumption is observed in two cases, due to the oxidation of surface metallic Pt species. No CO2 peaks related to the decomposition of residual carbon from PVP are found in the case of Pt/CeZrO2-1.5-NP, indicating that the carbon deposit is negligible. In addition, as for Pt/CeZrO2-1.5-NP, the temperature for the initial oxygen consumption peak is clearly decreased to about 209°C, which is much lower than that for Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 (263°C), demonstrating that the Pt component in the Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 has a lack of affinity towards O2 probably due to the presence of stronger interaction between the support and highly dispersed metallic Pt species. For selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, it is well-documented that the particle size of active metal species or the metal dispersion can exert vital impacts on their catalytic performance [21,48]. Generally, the decrease in the metal particle size leads to both the increased activity and the decreased UAA selectivity, due to more active sites on small-sized metal particles having low-coordinated surface sites and higher adsorption strength of CC bond than CO bond. In the present catalyst system, although the sizes of Pt NPs and the metal dispersions are almost identical (see Table 1), Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 shows the best catalytic performance. Due to similar size of Pt particles, there is no size dependence of hydrogenation activity among these catalysts. The above results demonstrate that both the Pt particle size and the metal dispersion alone cannot be considered as key reasons explaining the difference in the catalytic performances. To further investigate electronic structures of surface Pt species, in situ FT-IR of CO adsorbed on catalysts was examined. As shown in Fig. 10 , there are two main absorption bands for CO vibrations in the range of 2100–1950cm−1 and 1900–1780cm−1, respectively, which are assigned to CO linearly bound to a single Pt atom and CO bridging on two or more Pt atoms [49]. Much stronger band at 2100–1950cm−1 reflects a preferential adsorption of CO on Pt in a linear way. In addition, it is interesting to note that the linear adsorption of CO shifts from around 2045–2051cm−1 for single oxides supported catalyst to smaller wave numbers of 2032cm−1 for Pt/CeZrO2-1, 2027cm−1 for Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 and 2034cm−1 for Pt/CeZrO2-2. The decreased frequency is correlated with the increased back-bonding from the metal adsorption site to the π∗ orbital of CO molecule, reflecting the electron-rich character of Pt NPs. The result is well consistent with the Pt XPS results. Such electron-rich Pt0 species easily interact with the oxygen atom of carbonyl groups in CAL, probably improving the COL selectivity in the CAL hydrogenation. To study the adsorption of CAL on supported catalysts, in situ FT-IR of CAL adsorption were examined. As shown in Fig. 11 , as for pure CAL, there are two prominent absorption bands: the one at about 1629cm−1 is related to the stretching vibration of CC bond (υC C); the other one at 1680cm−1 is assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration of CO bond (υC O) [50,51]. However, for CAL adsorbed on single oxides supported catalysts, the intensities of two absorption bands, especially that of the υC O, are dramatically reduced, suggesting the weak adsorption of CAL. Additionally, compared with that for pure CAL, the band of υC C slightly red-shifts a little or keeps almost constant for Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2, implying weak interaction between Pt atoms and the CC double bond. Surprisingly, in the cases of composite oxides supported catalysts, the absorption bands of υC O and υC C all red-shift to smaller wave numbers of about 1672cm−1 and 1621cm−1, respectively, reflecting the significant increase in the CO and CC bond length due to the formation of strong interactions between Pt NPs and CO/CC moieties in CAL [52]. The above results confirm the activation of the CO/CC bonds in CAL adsorbed on composites supported Pt catalysts, which is advantage to the improved catalytic performance. The different adsorption behaviors of CAL on supported catalysts should be associated with the electronic structures of Pt NPs [53], as well as the nature of catalyst supports. In the present catalyst system, firstly, electron-rich Pt0 species may induce an enhanced oriented chemisorption of carbonyl group through the backbonding interaction of π∗ C O with the Pt surface with a higher electron density [54]. Secondly, surface Ce3+ species with one electron occupying a high energy state probably bind with oxygen atom of carbonyl group in CAL. Meanwhile, surface oxygen vacancies on supports possess unpaired electrons and thus act as electron donors to attract electronegative oxygen atom in carbonyl group. Consequently, surface defects (e.g., Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies) on catalysts also can interact with carbonyl group in CAL, thus leading to the activation of CO bond. Such interactions of carbonyl group with electron-rich Pt0 atoms and surface defects not only makes the carbonyl group easily reducible by dissociative hydrogen on catalytically active Pt0 species near surface defects through spillover effect but also inhibits the CC hydrogenation, thus giving rise to both high activity and high COL selectivity over the Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 with more negatively charged Pt0 atoms and an relatively larger amount of Ce3+ species. Although the CAL conversion on the Pt/CeO2 is quite comparable to that on the Pt/CeZrO2-2 (Table 3), the TOF value over the Pt/CeO2 is smaller than that over the Pt/CeZrO2-2. That is, the instinct catalytic activity of Pt/CeZrO2-2 is higher than that of Pt/CeO2, due to both the poorer electron-rich nature of Pt species and less oxygen vacancies on the surface of Pt/CeO2, probably leading to the weaker adsorption of CAL (Fig. 11). And, despite the similar adsorption character of CAL on Pt/CeO2 and Pt/ZrO2, Pt/ZrO2 exhibits a smallest TOF value among these catalysts, mainly due to the absence of Ce3+ defects on the surface. In addition, surface Lewis acid sites on catalysts may polarize the CO bond via the lone pair electron on the O atom in the nodal plane of the CO π bond. Further, the formation of the CO π bond may facilitate the nucleophilic attack of H to the positively charged carbon in carbonyl group [55]. In a way, surface Lewis acid sites can enhance the reactivity of carbonyl group. As a result, in the present catalyst system, both electron-rich Pt0 species originating from the SMSI effect and surface defects, as well as favorable surface acidity, which can greatly promote the chemisorption of CO bond and thus its activation, should be responsible for their enhanced catalytic performance. Fig.12 A shows the effect of the reaction temperature on the CAL hydrogenation over the Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1.0MPa in 30min. Notably, the CAL conversion presents a continuous increase from 81 to 100% with the elevated temperature from 50°C to 70°C, along with a decrease in the COL selectivity from 97 to 79% due to deep hydrogenation of COL to HCOL at higher reaction temperatures [56]. Further, the effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the CAL hydrogenation was investigated (Fig. 12B). Clearly, the CAL conversion increases from 81 to 95% by the improvement in the hydrogen partial pressure from 0.5MPa to 1.0MPa, whereas the COL selectivity only decreases by about 1%. Usually, high hydrogen pressure can improve the solubility of hydrogen, thus making hydrogen molecules easily accessible to substrates and active sites. When the hydrogen partial pressure is further increased to 1.5MPa, a decrease in the COL selectivity is observed besides the increase in the conversion. Obviously, higher hydrogen pressure is preferential to the hydrogenation of CC bond. The catalyst reusability, which would be one of the most important characters of heterogeneous catalysts, was investigated through consecutive hydrogenation reactions (Fig. 13 ). After each successive reaction, Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 could be retrieved by simple centrifugation, washed with ethanol for three times and dried at room temperature under vacuum. Noticeably, after five cycles, the CAL conversion decreases by only 5%, while the COL selectivity still is above 94%. Elemental analysis of the reaction filtrate by ICP-AES shows that the leaching loss of Pt species are less than 0.05ppm after five consecutive cycles, indicative of the extremely high stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, TEM analyses of used Pt/CeZrO2-1.5 catalyst reveal that no obvious aggregates of Pt NPs are observed after five consecutive runs (Fig. 14 A) and the XRD patterns shows unchanged microstructure of the used catalyst (Fig. 14B). Such excellent structural stability of Pt/ CeZrO2-1.5 is ascribed to the presence of SMSI originating from abundant porous network of the support."
8,Conclusions,"In summary, high-surface-area CeO2-ZrO2 composite supports were successfully fabricated via a low temperature solution-phase method in the absence of any additional templates and surfactants. The resulting supported Pt catalysts were employed in base-free selective hydrogenation of CAL to produce COL. Our results demonstrated that a significantly high COL selectivity of 94% at 95% CAL conversion, together with a high TOF value of 10423h–1, could be achieved over as-formed CeO2-ZrO2 composite supported Pt catalyst with the Ce/Zr molar ratio of 1:1. Such excellent catalytic performance was superior to those of most known supported Pt-based catalysts previously reported. The incorporation of zirconium into the lattice structure of ceria enhanced surface acidity of CeO2-ZrO2 composite supports and facilitated the formation of electron-rich Pt0 species and surface defects. In the present catalyst system, highly dispersed electron-rich Pt0 species and abundant surface defects, as well as favorable surface acid sites, greatly promoted the chemisorption and activation of carbonyl group in CAL, thus leading to enhanced catalytic hydrogenation performance. Moreover, the catalyst exhibited high structural stability due to the SMSI. The present findings open a promising route for designing new recyclable supported precious-metal-based catalysts using high-surface-area CeO2-ZrO2 composite supports for applications in a broad range of heterogeneous catalytic processes."
