0,Introduction,"Due to the continuous expansion of global industrialization, the world economy has made considerable progress. However, a series of environmental and energy problems seriously hinder economic development [1,2], and human beings cannot continue to sacrifice the ecological environment for temporary economic development [3,4]. The emergence of photocatalytic technology provides a new way to balance ecological and economic development.[5–7] Solar energy has become one of the most attractive energy sources on earth because it is inexhaustible, highly clean, and pollution-free [8–10]. With appropriate functional materials, water can be decomposed to produce hydrogen by using photocatalytic technology, which is of great significance in the field of sustainable energy [11–13]. Transition metal sulfides (MxSy; M = Co, Mo, W, Cu, Cd, Zn, Ag) have been widely studied as new semiconductor photocatalytic materials [14–22]. Due to their excellent photoelectric performance and special band gap, they have great potential in the field of photocatalysis. However, photocorrosion and rapid recombination of electron holes still limit the development of photocatalysis to a certain extent. As typical functional materials, layered double hydroxides LDHs with high tunability and multiple functionalities have recently triggered extensive research interest. The chemical formula for LDH is [M2+ 1-xM3+ x(OH)2]x+ [(A n -)x/m·H2O], where M2+ represents a divalent metal cation, M3+ represents a trivalent metal cation, and A n - represents an interlaminar anion [23–25]. Due to their unique two-dimensional layered structure, bimetallic layered hydrotalcites can effectively shorten the ion-electron diffusion pathway and expose densely distributed active sites. Additionally, the highly conductive nature of bimetallic layered hydrotalcites can effectively improve electron-proton transfer [26–28]. In addition, special photosensitive metal elements such as Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Ti, and Ce can be introduced into the interlayer to further improve catalytic performance. At present, LDH-based materials have been widely used in the fields of radionuclide adsorption [29], water oxidation [30], capacitive deionization [31,32], PMS activation catalysts, etc. [33,34]. The construction of S-scheme heterojunctions is applied not only in the field of photocatalysis but also extensively applied in other fields. For example, the S-Scheme heterojunction constructed by Wu et al. through the combination of BiOCl and CuBi2O4 was used for the degradation of diclofenac and the removal of nitric oxide [35]. Xiao et al. used CeO2/BiOI to construct a heterojunction to remove the heavy metal ions of mercury [36]. He et al. constructed an S-scheme heterojunction for carbon dioxide reduction and obtained excellent results [37]. Wang et al. constructed an S-scheme heterojunction for the degradation of Congo red by combining sulfur-doped C3N4 with TiO2 [38–40]. Based on the principle that urea easily decomposes and releases alkaline gas in aqueous solutions at high temperature, a solution containing metal cations is quickly mixed with the urea-containing solution and then transferred to a high-pressure reactor for nucleation crystallization to prepare double bimetal hydroxides. Additionally, adding CoSx nanoparticles to the above solution can promote its perfect growth into the folds of hydrotalcites. The method is easy to perform, and the obtained product has favourable and uniform crystallinity. Moreover, a series of characterization methods were used to confirm the successful construction of the S-scheme heterojunction. It is anticipated that this research can provide new ideas for the application of double metal hydroxides in the field of photocatalytic water splitting."

Ammonium fluoride (NH4F, AR, 96.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

Nonahydrate sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, AR, 98%) and anhydrous cobalt acetate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, AR, 99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd."
3,Preparation of Nickel-aluminium layered double hydroxides,"2.2 Preparation of Nickel-aluminium layered double hydroxides The synthesis of NiAl-LDH was based on the following method: 0.48 mmol of nickel nitrate hexahydrate, 0.16 mmol of aluminium nitrate nonahydrate, 1.28 mmol of ammonium fluoride, and 3.2 mmol of urea were accurately weighed and dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. After half an hour of ultrasonication, the above solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. The resulting product was washed several times with alcohol and deionized water and then dried in an oven [41]."
4,Preparation of cobalt sulfide and heterojunction catalyst,"2.3 Preparation of cobalt sulfide and heterojunction catalyst The CoSx nanoparticles were prepared according to previous work [42]. The heterojunction catalyst CL-X (X is the mass of the added CoSx nanoparticles) was prepared using a solvothermal method (as shown in Scheme 1 ). During the preparation of CL-X, the presynthesized CoSx nanoparticles were added to a solution containing the experimental reagents for the synthesis of NiAl-LDH. After ultrasonication, the above mixture was transferred to a reactor, and the reaction conditions were kept the same as those for the synthesis of pure NiAl-LDH."
5,Photocatalytic hydrogen production measurements,"2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production measurements The hydrogen evolution experiment was conducted by periodically and quantitatively extracting gas from a reaction flask under specific lighting conditions. Pumping nitrogen to replace the air in the bottle was enough to ensure atmospheric pressure in the bottle. The reaction was then illuminated with 5 W white light equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter. The mixture was stirred continuously during the reaction. The sampling needle manually extracted 5 mL hydrogen per hour, and the hydrogen content was determined by gas chromatography (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13X column, N2 as the carrier)."
6,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was tested by electrochemical workstations (VersaSTAT4-400, AMETEK Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc), including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), transient photocurrent response (TPR), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Mott-Schottky (MS). The electrochemical test was performed on a three-electrode electrochemical workstation, where a Pt electrode was the counter electrode, the reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode, and the working electrode was made of a conductive glass coated with catalysts. The manufacturing method for the working electrode is as follows: 5 mg catalyst was dissolved in a mixture of 1 µL alcohol and Nafion solution (alcohol: Nafion = 9:1). The solution was then coated on conductive glass with an effective area of 1 × 1 cm2 and air-dried for 12 h. EIS was measured at a voltage amplitude of 5 mV. The Mott-Schottky test frequency was 1.0 kHz, and the voltage range was −1.2 to 0.4 V. The scanning frequency of LSV was 0.05 V s−1. The voltage range was controlled within −1 ∼ 1 V. The photocurrent response was controlled within 520 s under a 300-W xenon lamp as the light source, and the wavelength was adjusted to above 420 nm through a longpass filter."
7,Characterizations,"2.6 Characterizations Specific characterization methods, including field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were used to observe the microstructure and morphology of the catalysts. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements were utilized to analyse the surface area, pore volume, and pore distribution. The crystal structure, elemental composition, and valence state of the catalysts were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties of the catalyst were analysed by ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis) and photoluminescence (PL). Photochemical characterization was performed on an electrochemical workstation with a 0.2-M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The model information and operating parameters of each instrument are as follows: TEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL, accelerating voltage 300 kV), SEM (German Zeiss SIGMA 500), XRD (Thermo Scientific ESCALAB-Xi+ electron spectrometer using an Al Ka X-ray source), XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi), UV–vis (PerkinElmer Lambda-750S), BET (ASAP 2460), and photoluminescence detector (FLUOROMAX-4)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structure and morphology analysis,"3.1 Structure and morphology analysis 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction analysis The X-ray diffraction patterns of NiAl-LDH, CoSx, and CL-X are shown in Fig. 1 . For NiAl-LDH, all the diffraction peaks are sharp, and no other impurity peaks are included. All XRD peaks are well matched with the peaks of a standard card PDF#15-87. The diffraction peaks at 11.70°, 23.60°, 35.17°, and 39.80° correspond to the crystal planes of (003), (006), (012), and (015). The diffraction peaks at 17.28°, 61.29°, and 62.65° correspond to the (018), (110), and (113) crystal planes [43]. In contrast, for the CoSx diffraction pattern, there is no sharp diffraction peak, and an obvious upwards tilt occurs between 25°-45°, indicating the amorphous nature of the CoSx nanoparticles. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of the CL-X products obtained by compounding different amounts of CoSx nanoparticles. As shown in the figure, with the increase in amorphous CoSx nanoparticles, the position of the NiAl-LDH diffraction peak does not shift, and no other diffraction peaks appear. As the addition of CoSx nanoparticles is increased from 5 to 30 mg, the XRD diffraction curves of CL-X become increasingly skewed within the range of 15° to 45°. This result indicates the successful physical combination of CoSx and NiAl-LDH instead of chemical doping of Co and S in NiAl-LDH. The experimental results show that the one-step hydrothermal method can realize physical combination without destroying the lattice structure. 3.1.2 Morphology and structure analysis The morphology and microstructure of the NiAl-LDH, amorphous CoSx nanoparticles, and CL-15 composite were further analysed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), the nanoflower-like NiAl-LDH has a diameter of approximately 3 µm, and flower-like folds on its surface are formed by the irregular stacking of ultrathin nanosheets. The irregular arrangement of nanosheets provides not only plenty of space but also provides support for the tight anchoring of amorphous CoSx nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2 (d, e), the CoSx nanoparticles are uniformly embedded into the folds of the NiAl-LDH nanoflowers and firmly anchored on the nanosheets without obvious agglomeration. As a result, more heterojunctions could be constructed in such a unique nanostructure. Fig. 2(c) shows the SEM image of pure CoSx nanoparticles. It is obvious that the CoSx nanoparticles are severely agglomerated. The EDX spectrum in Fig. 2(f) confirms the presence of Co, S, Ni, Al, C, N, and O in the CL-15 composite, indicating the successful combination of the CoSx nanoparticles and NiAl-LDH. TEM and HRTEM were used to further analyse the structure of the CL-15 composite catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3 (a, b), we can see that there are some aggregations in the outer folds of NiAl-LDH, which are attributed to the CoSx nanoparticles. These CoSx nanoparticles are located at the edge of the folds and the deep layer of the folds. The HRTEM image of CL-15 is shown in Fig. 3(c, d). The results indicate that the amorphous CoSx nanoparticles are successfully anchored onto the nanoflower-like NiAl-LDH. In addition, the crystal region was further analysed. The measured areas in Fig. 3(c) correspond to the (012), (015), and (018) crystal planes of NiAl-LDH, and the lattice stripes in Fig. 3(d) correspond to the (012), (104), and (101) crystal planes. TEM and HRTEM images confirm that the interface contact between the two catalysts is intimate, which is favourable for electron transfer. 3.1.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis To further study the surface chemical valence of the prepared photocatalysts accurately, XPS characterization was carried out. Fig. 4 shows the full XPS spectra of various samples and the high-resolution XPS spectra of different elements. As shown in Fig. 4(a), Co, S, O, Ni, Al, N, and C elements can be detected in the composite catalyst of CL-15, among which the Co and S come from the CoSx nanoparticles, while O, Ni, Al, N, and C come from the NiAl-LDH. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the characteristic peaks of Co can be divided into six peaks, among which the characteristic peaks at 802.9 and 786.25 eV are a pair of satellite peaks, and peaks at 798.6 and 794.00 eV correspond to the Co 2p1/2 orbital peaks for Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. The peaks at 781.35 and 778.85 eV correspond to the 2p3/2 orbitals in Co2+. In Fig. 4(c), the XPS peak of S can be divided into two peaks of 162.9 and 161.75 eV, which correspond to the Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals, respectively. After fitting, the XPS peak of C (Fig. 4(d)) can be divided into three peaks at 288.85, 286.2, and 284.7 eV, which correspond to CO, CO, and nonoxygen ring C (CC/CC), respectively [44]. A characteristic peak at 74.1 eV in Fig. 4(e) is attributed to the Al3+ ion in Al(OH)3 [26,45]. Fig. 4(f) shows the high-resolution XPS diffraction pattern of Ni, in which the characteristic peaks at 879.95 and 862.4 eV belong to the two satellite peaks of Ni, and the characteristic peaks at 873.75 and 856.6 eV are the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals of Ni, respectively. 3.1.4 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis The specific surface area and pore structure of the photocatalyst determine the size of the exposed active area in the photocatalytic reaction and have a certain influence on the reaction rate of water splitting to produce hydrogen. According to the classification rules of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Chemistry, all isotherms in Fig. 5 possess IV- and H3-type hysteretic loops, indicating a mesoporous structure [32,46]. Additionally, according to the illustration in Fig. 5 and the data in Table 1 , the specific surface area data were analysed. The specific surface areas of CoSx, NiAl-LDH, and CL-15 are 33, 59, and 67 m2·g-1, respectively. The results show that the specific surface area and pore size of the CoSx/NiAl-LDH catalyst increase. Combined with the morphology analysis, the larger pore volume is conducive to the diffusion of sacrificial agents in catalysts and the exposure of more active regions of the photocatalytic reaction. Additionally, it contributes to effectively separating the photoelectron-hole pair, thus further improving the efficiency of hydrogen evolution."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance The photocatalytic hydrogen splitting effect of CoSx, NiAl-LDH, and CoSx/NiAl-LDH (CL-15) was tested under simulated sunlight with triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial reagent and 15 mg eosin Y (EY) as the electron donor. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), the hydrogen evolution rate of CL-15 increases by 22 and 83.74 times those of CoSx and NiAl-LDH, respectively. In addition, the trend in the hydrogen production rate of the CoSx/NiAl-LDH heterojunction shows a “volcano” shape, indicating that CoSx loading influences the photocatalytic efficiency of the CoSx/NiAl-LDH heterojunction (Fig. 6(b)). When the load of CoSx was excessive, the CoSx nanoparticles agglomerated on the surface of the flower-like NiAl-LDH, resulting in a decrease in the surface wrinkles of NiAl-LDH and thus blocking the internal diffusion of the sacrificial reagent. In addition, excessive CoSx nanoparticles may become recombination centres for electron-hole pairs, thus reducing the photocatalytic reaction rate. In contrast, a small amount of CoSx nanoparticles will make the interface between the CoSx and NiAl-LDH too limited to transfer and separate the photogenerated electron pairs, which cannot effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Then, we explored the adaptability of CL-15 to TEOA at different pH values. Hydrogen evolution in the TEOA solution at pH = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 is shown in Fig. 6(c). As the solution changes from pH = 7 to pH = 12, the amount of hydrogen evolution also shows a “volcano” pattern. Hydrogen evolution is the highest at pH = 9. This is because the decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is adverse to hydrogen evolution in terms of thermodynamic kinetics, and the electrostatic repulsion between the deprotonated dye molecules and CoSx increases. In the dye sensitized system, EY molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts so that these EY molecules can participate in the photocatalytic reaction process. Consequently, it is essential to investigate the optimal amount of dye involved in the photocatalytic system. As shown in Fig. 6(d), with the addition of EY, the amount of hydrogen evolution increases gradually until the amount of EY reaches 15 mg. After that, the hydrogen evolution reaction is gradually inhibited with increasing EY. This indicates that all the dye molecules in the solution can be adsorbed by the catalysts and effectively utilized when the quantity of EY is appropriate. Once the amount of EY exceeds 15 mg, excess dye molecules accumulate in the solution, preventing effective electron transfer and photon adsorption of the photocatalyst and thus reducing the number of photons on the photocatalyst surface and resulting in reduced hydrogen production activity. To explore the stability of catalysts, a hydrogen evolution cyclic test was carried out. As shown in Fig. 6(e), the amount of hydrogen produced in the second cycle was significantly lower compared with that in the first cycle. When 15 mg EY was added again, the amount of hydrogen produced was significantly higher, indicating that the degradation of EY was the main reason for the decrease in hydrogen evolution. At the end of the cyclic test, the XRD pattern of the catalyst was recorded again. As shown in Fig. 6(f), the positions of the XRD characteristic peaks before and after cycling do not change, indicating that the catalyst has excellent cyclic stability."
11,Transfer kinetics of charges,"3.3 Transfer kinetics of charges 3.3.1 The photoluminescence spectra To further investigate the charge separation and transfer efficiency of the photocatalysts, a PL test was performed. Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra of EY, CoSx, NiAl-LDH, and CL-15 under 480 nm excitation. As seen from the figure, all samples reach their peak value at 536 nm, and the fluorescence intensity of EY is the highest. When NiAl-LDH and CoSx were added to the solution, the fluorescence intensity decreased slightly. However, when the prepared CL-15 composite catalyst was added, the fluorescence intensity was greatly reduced. Fluorescence intensity can indicate the degree of recombination of electrons and holes. When the fluorescence intensity is high, it indicates that the number of excited electrons converted into the ground state is large, and the rate of electron-hole recombination is high. In contrast, a low fluorescence intensity indicates that the recombination of electrons and holes in the catalyst is inhibited [47]. 3.3.2 Photoelectrochemical experiments EIS, LSV, and TPR were measured to characterize the electrochemical properties of the samples. First, in the TPR results shown in Fig. 8 (a), CL-15 shows a stable and rapid photocurrent response at the moment the xenon lamp irradiation was initiated, while the light response of CoSx is relatively weak and shows a certain degree of attenuation within the test time range. The excellent photocurrent density of CL-15 indicates that more carriers are generated during the photocatalytic process and effectively separated [48]. In addition, the enhanced TPR performance of CL-15 also means that the carrier life is prolonged. Second, the LSV test results are shown in Fig. 8(b). CL-15 has the highest overpotential, which is approximately −1.17 V, larger than those of the CoSx (−1.34 V) and NiAl-LDH (−1.43 V). This result indicates that the recombination rate of electrons and holes in CoSx and NiAl-LDH is relatively fast, and the carrier migration efficiency is low [49]. The EIS results of the catalysts were simulated by an equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. 8(c)), where Rs is the equivalent series resistance, CPE is the constant phase element, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The value of Rct can be reflected by the semicircle radius of the EIS curves. The smaller the radius is, the lower the carrier transfer resistance at the interface. After fitting, the Rct value of the composite catalyst of CL-15 (14.33 Ω) is less than those of CoSx (24.35 Ω) and NiAl-LDH (57.13 Ω), indicating that the carriers in the CL-15 composite catalyst can transfer rapidly at the electrode/electrolyte interface and that the separation of electrons and holes is efficient [50,51]."
12,Optical properties,"3.4 Optical properties Fig. 9 shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the catalysts. First, NiAl-LDH has three distinct absorption bands in the test wavelength range, among which the absorption band located at 200–300 nm is attributed to charge transfer from the 2p orbital of the O atom of the ligand to the 3d orbital of Ni [52]. The absorption band located at 300–800 nm is caused by the d-d transition of Ni2+ [53]. It is not surprising that the black catalyst of CoSx shows full-band absorption. When it is combined with light green NiAl-LDH, the final grey–green product of CL-15 also shows full-band absorption. In addition, the light absorption intensities of the catalysts, including pure NiAl-LDH and CL-15, were significantly improved. The increased light absorption capacity is also responsible for the significant improvement in the photocatalytic performance of CL-15."
13,Reaction mechanism,"3.5 Reaction mechanism The conduction band and valence band positions of CoSx and NiAl-LDH were then investigated. Combined with other characterization results, a possible electron migration route is proposed, which can be utilized to speculate the possible photocatalytic mechanism. First, the band gap values were obtained by the Kubelka-Munk method (Fig. 10 (a) and (b)). The band gaps of CoSx and NiAl-LDH are approximately 1.68 and 2.45 eV, respectively [54]. Additionally, the flat band potentials of the n-type semiconductors of CoSx and NiAl-LDH at different frequencies are −0.67 and −0.57 V, respectively. It is generally believed that the conduction band position will be 0.1 or 0.2 eV more negative than the flat band potential, so the conduction band positions of CoSx and NiAl-LDH under saturated calomel as the electrode are −0.77 and 0.67 eV, respectively. Then, the equation ENHE = ESCE + 0.241 is used to convert the corresponding conduction band positions for the saturated hydrogen electrode (-0.529 and −0.429 eV). The valence band position of the semiconductor is studied by the formula EVB = ECB + Eg [55]. After calculation, the valence bands of CoSx and NiAl-LDH are 1.151 and 2.021 eV, respectively. Therefore, combined with the above analysis and calculation, a possible electron transfer route is proposed based on the mechanism of the S-scheme heterojunction. First, when the CoSx nanoparticles make contact with the NiAl-LDH, the Fermi energy level of the CoSx is higher than that of the NiAl-LDH, which results in the spontaneous transfer of electrons from the Fermi energy level of the CoSx to the Fermi energy level of the NiAl-LDH until a new Fermi energy level of electron equality is formed. Moreover, a spontaneous internal electric field is formed at the contact surface between the CoSx and NiAl-LDH through electron transfer, and the bands of CoSx and NiAl-LDH are also bent accordingly. As shown in Fig. 11 (c), the band of CoSx is bent upwards, while the band of NiAl-LDH is bent downwards, which prevents electrons from transferring from the conduction band of CoSx to the conduction band of NiAl-LDH and prevents the hole from transferring from the valence band of NiAl-LDH to the valence band of CoSx. In contrast, the existence of an internal electric field and the bending of the energy band promote the electrons located in the conduction band of NiAl-LDH to positively transfer to the valence band of CoSx and combine with the holes from the valence band of CoSx to be quenched [56,57]. The electrons on the CoSx will combine with the protons in the water to release hydrogen, and the holes will be captured and consumed by the hole trapping agent TEOA. For the photosensitizer eosin and the hole trapping agent TEOA in the solution, when the system is exposed to light, the ground state of EY is rapidly excited by light and transformed into the excited state EY1*, which is then converted to a more stable triple-excited state (EY3*) by an inter-system leap. At this time, TEOA molecules in the solution will transform the stable triple excited state into EY-· via their strong reducing ability. The electrons of EY-· transfer to the active surface of the composite catalyst of CL-15 and then participate in the reduction reaction to generate hydrogen in the conduction band of CoSx. The charge transfer mechanism based on the synergistic action of the photosensitizer and hole trapping agent provides a reasonable explanation for the dramatically increased efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [58]."
14,Conclusions,"In conclusion, amorphous CoSx nanoparticles were anchored in situ on the folds of flower-like NiAl-LDH by a facile wet chemical method to form a novel CoSx/NiAl-LDH interface heterostructure. The photocatalytic efficiency of CoSx/NiAl-LDH was significantly improved compared with that of CoSx and NiAl-LDH. Compared with the heterojunction constructed by previous scholars, this work is more excellent for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of catalysts [59–61]. Additionally, the possible electron migration mechanism in the S-scheme heterojunction of CoSx/NiAl-LDH was systematically analysed using a series of characterizations, such as XPS, MS, PL, and MS. This work not only successfully transferred NiAl-LDH from other fields to the field of photocatalysis, but also significantly improved the transfer rate of charge while maintaining its beautiful flower structure [62], which provides a promising strategy for expanding the application field of hydrotalcite materials and high-performance photocatalytic splitting of water."
