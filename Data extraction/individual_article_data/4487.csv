0,Introduction,"Petrochemical-based polymers and other synthetic materials continue to dominate the production of packaging for foods and pharmaceuticals. Despite the increasing attention to biodegradable/renewable packaging, their production is yet to match the efficiency and superior functionality (e.g., flexibility, strength, impermeability, and stability) of the non-degradable/non-renewable counterparts (Liu, Cai, Sheng, Ma, & Xu, 2019). With the current technological developments in biodegradable films, biopolymeric materials can be adapted to suit specific packaging functions such as separating layered foods, lamination coating, disposable pouches, and thin layers for the primary product contact in multilayer packaging. Composite biodegradable films from naturally available biopolymers have gained increasing attention as potential alternatives in sustainable packaging (Falguera, Quintero, Jiménez, Muñoz, & Ibarz, 2011). The use of protein and polysaccharides or their composites as ingredients for biodegradable films has risen in recent years, due to their biodegradability and non-toxic nature. However, adoption of these materials is faced with many challenges, including poor mass transfer properties, reduced strength, and reduced stability under various handling environments (McHugh, 2000). The attractiveness of protein-polysaccharide composite lies in the synergy of interactions and microstructural development potential when subjected to modification conditions. They are also collectively biocompatible with other natural or synthetic biopolymers required for improved functionality (Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016). Development of composite biomaterials from zein (ZN), a prolamin protein extracted from the corn endosperm and chitosan (CS), a copolymer of α-(1 → 4) glucosamine obtained from the deacetylation of chitin, has been reported (Cheng, Wang, & Weng, 2015; Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2019; Li et al., 2018). Prolamin proteins, such as ZN, have good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and sustainability. Compared to other proteins, zeins' amphiphilic nature supports unique polymerization characteristics, bioconjugation, and complex development. However, it exhibits poor functional and structural properties such as flexibility and brittleness (Arcan & Yemenicioğlu, 2011; Senna, Salmieri, El-naggar, Safrany, & Lacroix, 2010). The propensity of the amino acid side chains of ZN to covalently react with the glucosamine from CS in a spontaneous manner enables robust structures with improved water resistance, mechanical strength, and encapsulation efficiency (Giteru et al., 2019; Senna et al., 2010). Other interactions between ZN and CS occur through electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and van der Waals forces (Li et al., 2018; McClements, 2006; Turgeon, Beaulieu, Schmitt, & Sanchez, 2003). Nevertheless, ZN-CS complexes still experience incompatibility and instability in the colloidal state (Zhang et al., 2019). Firstly, instabilities in the dispersions can be caused by phase separation either through thermodynamic incompatibility or complex coacervation (Turgeon et al., 2003), owing to the substantial hydrophobic property of ZN and the cationic polymer properties of CS (high molecular charge density of −NH3 +). After that, the assembly of phase-separated dispersions leads to poor microstructural development in the resulting matrix. Manipulating the surface activity of one or more components is a critical factor in fine-tuning protein-polysaccharide interactions for targeted applications (Kim & Xu, 2008; Sun, Dai, & Gao, 2017). Simple alterations, such as changes in solvent concentration, pH adjustments, conjugation reactions, or electrolytes, can be employed to manipulate the surface charge of biomacromolecules (Kim et al., 2008). Accordingly, the behavior of protein-polysaccharides composites under various conditions, including various biopolymer concentrations, solvent properties (pH, ionic strength), hydrostatic pressure, temperature, and the presence of denaturants and crosslinkers, continues to attract interest (Turgeon et al., 2003). Pulsed electric fields (PEF) processing has the potential to modify biomacromolecular interactions, an essential requirement in the development of composite bio-based films (Mazurkiewicz, Kołoczek, & Tomasik, 2015; Perez & Pilosof, 2004). The identified mechanisms of PEF, including the generation of free radicals through electrochemical reactions and polarisation of biomacromolecules, coincide to produce ions that can alter the local pH around the electrodes (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020; Giteru, Cridge, Oey, Ali, & Altermann, 2020; Zhao et al., 2012). Aided by the charge of surface residues, PEF-induced depolymerization of biomacromolecules and migration of ions was reported to facilitate intermolecular interactions and establish networks, including favoring crosslinks, and bioconjugation (Perez et al., 2004). The potential to modify ZN (Kim et al., 2008), CS (Luo, Han, Zeng, Yu, & Kennedy, 2010), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), and polyethylene glycol (PEG400) (Abu Ghalia & Dahman, 2015; Giteru, Oey, & Ali, 2018a) by use of external energy has been reported. Molecules of these biopolymers can quickly undergo a transformation of the surface residues, depolymerize or unfold to yield a high density of exposed active sites (Giteru, Cridge, et al., 2020). So far, most of the investigations on PEF applications have focused on individual biomacromolecule systems. Also, fewer studies have explored the utilization of useful modification behavior after PEF as a pre-treatment technique to advance the applications of PEF-treated biomacromolecules. It was recently demonstrated that specific energy and electric field strength of PEF processing were the dominant parameters affecting rheological properties of chitosan-zein-polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol (CZPP) dispersion system (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). The study reported changes in the properties of thin films obtained after PEF treatment of the dispersions, but it is not well understood how the flow behaviour properties resulting from the treatment affected the films' microstructure and functional properties. Taking these previous results into account, this work aims to understand better how PEF processing affects CZPP composite colloidal dispersions and how the PEF-induced alterations affect the properties of composite films produced from these dispersions. The previously applied analytical techniques (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020), namely rheological, particle size, and zeta potential measurements, were used in the current study to evaluate non-PEF and PEF treated colloidal dispersions in order to ascertain the repeatability of the reported phenomena. Afterwards, the composite films were further characterized using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), crystallinity, and tensile properties. The water vapor permeability and wet properties of the composite films in water and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) were also determined."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Zein (ZN) (Z 3625, molecular weight (Mw) 22–24 kDa) with an approximate 98% protein content (w/w), poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVOH), (Mw 89,000–98,000 Da, 99+ % hydrolyzed), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Chitosan (CS) (Mw 890 kDa, 91% degree of deacetylation (DD) was obtained from Waseta Int’ l trading company (Shanghai, China). All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade, and all supplies were used as received."
3,Preparation of composite dispersions,"2.2 Preparation of composite dispersions A composite dispersion with a total solid of 1.85 w/w% (dry basis) was prepared from CS, ZN, PVOH, and PEG (CZPP) using a previously optimized method (Giteru et al., 2019). The optimal formulation comprised of 0.39, 0.25, 0.13, 0.23 wt fraction CS, ZN, PVOH, and PEG400, respectively, dispersed in a solvent mixture containing 60% aqueous ethanol and 0.6% acetic acid (pH 5.3 ± 0.3). The dispersions were allowed to form inter/intramolecular interactions for 6 h at 20 ± 1 °C before processing under pulsed electric fields (PEF). Table 1 shows the PEF system settings of specific energy (Q P ) (kJ/kg) and electric field strength (E P ) (kV/cm), which were applied and monitored, as documented by Giteru, Ali, and Oey (2020). Briefly, 40 g of CZPP composite dispersions were filled into a 40 mm gap stainless steel batch electrode and treated using a PEF system (ELCRACK-HVP 5, German Institute of Food Technologies, Quakenbrück, Germany). Following the treatment, the dispersions were allowed a further period of network reformation at 20 °C for 3 h before further analysis."
4,Rheological measurements,"2.3 Rheological measurements Steady shear rheological measurements were conducted with a HAAKE Rheostress 1 rheometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) using a double cone (6 cm diameter, 0.052° angle) and plate geometry as described by Giteru, Ali, and Oey (2020). All measurements were performed in triplicate using three independent samples."
5,"Z-average, polydispersity, and zeta-potential measurements","2.4 Z-average, polydispersity, and zeta-potential measurements Particle size measurements for non-PEF and PEF treated dispersions were performed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (HPPS Malvern, UK) (Rodrigues et al., 2015). Measurements were conducted on 1 mL of undiluted dispersions at 20 ± 0.5 °C using the actual sample viscosity obtained at a shear rate of 40 s−1 ( η 40 s − 1 ) during each run. The Z-average particle diameter calculated from the Stokes−Einstein equation was obtained directly from the instrument. Reported values were averaged from at least five replicates of each treatment from three independent samples. The surface zeta (ζ) potential was determined at 20 °C with a Laser Doppler velocimetry (Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments, UK) using 1 mL of undiluted sample (Folded Capillary Cell – DTS1060, Malvern, UK). Measured mobility was converted to ζ-potential using the Smoluchowski theory (Eq. (1)). (1) υ E = 4 π ε 0 ε r ζ 6 π μ ( 1 + κ r ) where υ E is mobility, ε 0 is the relative dielectric constant, and εr is the electrical permittivity. ζ represents the zeta potential, μ is the liquid viscosity, κ is the Debye–Hückel parameter and r is the particle radius. The ζ-potential values were the average of at least three samples obtained from three independent treatments."
6,Preparation of CZPP composite films,"2.5 Preparation of CZPP composite films Composite films of non-PEF and PEF treated dispersions were degassed for 2 min in an ultrasonic system (Elmasonic S30H, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany), followed by casting 0.05 g/cm2 (total solids) on 10 cm × 10 cm polystyrene Petri dishes (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). The films were placed under a fume hood at 20 ± 2 °C for 18 h to allow evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA), a non-equilibrium process that promotes self –organization of nanostructure during solvent removal. Dried films were then conditioned in a vacuum desiccator containing magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg (NO3)2·6H2O) (53 ± 3% RH) for a minimum of seven days at room temperature."
7,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),"2.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Fourier transform spectra of dried films were recorded using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer (ALPHA D, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) using a platinum/diamond crystal. Interferograms of whole films were recorded by scanning 3 random locations on 1 cm × 1 cm film pieces using 64 scans acquired at 4 cm−1 spectral resolution over the region of 4000–400 cm−1 (Figueira, Miguel, de Sa, & Correia, 2016). A background scan obtained before scanning the sample was used as the baseline for each measurement. The spectra of each compound, i.e., ZN, CS, and PVOH, were also determined for comparisons. Three measurements were conducted for each treatment, and then the spectra were normalized using OMNIC software version 9.2.86 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. MA, USA)."
8,Glass transition and thermal stability of CZPP composite films using DSC and TGA,"2.7 Glass transition and thermal stability of CZPP composite films using DSC and TGA Phase transition properties of the films were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), whereas thermostability was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis as described by Giteru et al. (2019). Both DSC and TGA analyses were performed with TA Instrument DSC-Q100 and TGA-500 (New Castle, DE, USA), respectively. The measurements were performed in duplicate for three independent samples."
9,Tensile properties of CZPP films,"2.8 Tensile properties of CZPP films The films' thickness (T) was measured using a hand-held digital micrometer (Thorlabs, NJ, USA) to the nearest 0.01 mm at six random locations for use in tensile properties and water vapor permeability measurements. Tensile properties were determined on the conditioned films using a universal testing machine TA-HD plus (Stable Micro Systems Ltd, Godalming, UK), as described by Giteru et al. (2019). Film strips were cut into a dumbbell shape (overall length (L0) 63.5 mm, gage length l = 7.62 mm, the width of the narrow section W = 3.18 mm), and initial grips separation was 25.4 mm. A load cell of 50 N was applied at a cross-head speed of 5 mm/min, a pre-test speed of 4.8 mm/min, and a post-test speed of 8 mm/min with a target distance of 30 mm. The maximum stress (tensile strength, TS) (MPa), Young's modulus of elasticity (EM) (MPa) from the stress-strain curves, and film extensibility (elongation at break, %EAB) from the force-distance curves were determined using Eqs. (2)–(4), respectively. The test was conducted at 20 ± 1 °C and 45 ± 3% RH with at least six film samples for each treatment. (2) T S ( M P a ) = F m a x / A o (3) E A B ( % ) = [ Δ l / l 0 ] × 100 (4) E M = L O ( F 2 − F 1 ) A O ( δ 2 − δ 1 ) where, F m a x is the maximum load for breaking the film (N), A o is the initial specimen cross-sectional area (T × W (mm2)), Δl is the change in length from the original length (l o) of the specimen between the grips. The force (F 1 , F 2 ) and displacement ( δ 1 , δ 2 ) values were obtained from the linear portion of a plot of displacement against the force. 2.8.1 Stability in wet environments and water vapor permeability of PEF-treated CZPP composite films The films' swelling behavior in deionized water and tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) was determined as described by Gutiérrez and Álvarez (2016). Circular discs (10 mm diameter) of films were immersed in tubes containing 10 mL of either deionized water or Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) at 20 ± 1 °C. Sodium azide (0.02% w/v) was added to the solutions to prevent microbial growth. The tubes were covered and left undisturbed at 25 °C for 24 h. The swelling behavior (S index ) was determined, according to Eq. (5). Erosion properties of the films were investigated in water and Tris-HCL buffer (pH 7.8) as described by Li, Guo, and Heinamaki (2010). Film samples (~150 mg) were weighed (W0) into 15 mL centrifuge tubes, and the tubes were filled with 10 mL deionized water or Tris-HCL buffer containing 0.02% sodium azide to restrict microbial growth. The tubes were then sealed and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 96 h with shaking (100 rpm). The samples were then centrifuged (3000 g for 15 min, 20 °C) to remove dissolved material, followed by washing the residue two times with deionized water. The weight of dry residue (W1) taken after drying at 50 °C was used to calculate the films' erosion index (Eq. (6)). The water vapor permeability (WVP) was determined following a standard method (ASTM E96/E96-10) (ASTM, 2013) at 25 °C and as stated by the method of Giteru et al. (2019). (5) S i n d e x ( % ) = [ ( D 2 − D 1 ) / D 1 ] × 100 (6) E r o s i o n % = W 0 − W 1 W 0 × 100 where D 1 and D 2 are the diameters of the films before (ø = 10 mm) and after immersion in the standard solutions; w 0 and w 1 are the initial and final weight of degraded films, respectively."
10,Microstructural morphology and crystallinity of CZPP composite films,"2.9 Microstructural morphology and crystallinity of CZPP composite films The films' morphology was determined with a scanning electron microscopy (Leo 435 VP, Leo Electronic Systems, U.K). Film samples were gold-coated (2 min, 2 mbar), and the micrographs were observed at 10 kV in a vacuum of 9.75 × 10-5 Torr. The crystalline behavior was evaluated with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD PW3040/60 diffractometer (Malvern PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) in the range of 5°< 2θ < 35° diffraction angles as described by (Giteru et al., 2019). The equipment was equipped with a Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) irradiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA."
11,Statistical analysis,"2.10 Statistical analysis Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and posthoc analysis using Tukey correction to separate the means. All data were processed using IBM SPSS software (ver. 25, NY, USA)."
12,Results and discussions,
13,Characterization of colloidal properties,"3.1 Characterization of colloidal properties 3.1.1 Rheological properties of CZPP composite dispersions The steady shear properties were determined by a stepwise increase of shear rate from 0.018 to 700 s−1 for both non-PEF and PEF treated CZPP dispersions. Fig. 1 a-(b) shows the viscosity dependence of shear rate for specific energy (Q P ) and electric field strength (E P ) treatments, respectively. Generally, PEF treatment resulted in high viscosity, which suggested higher interparticle interactions due to increased electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions Ma, Yu, Zhang, and Wang (2012). Perturbations during PEF can induce disaggregation of the initially established CZPP complexes exposing reactive moieties, which increased the particles' solvent affinity (Li, Chen, & Mo, 2007; Wu, Zhao, Yang, Yan, & Sun, 2016). The flow of the dispersions transitioned from Newtonian to shear-thinning, which was suitably described by Carreau Yasuda mathematical model (CYM) (r2 > 0.99) at a shear rate ( γ ˙ ) >10 s−1 (Eq. (7)) (Xie, Halley, & Avérous, 2012). For the CYM parameters, η 0 is the zero-shear viscosity (Pa·s), n is the flow behavior index (n = 1 for Newtonian fluids, n > 1 for shear thickening and n < 1 for shear-thinning fluids), λc is a time constant related to the relaxation times of the polymer in solution (Table 2 ). (7) η a | γ | ˙ = η o 1 + λ c γ ˙ a 1 − n / a Subjecting the dispersions to Q P (60–400 kJ/kg) and E P (0.8–3.4 kV/cm) led to higher viscosity, suggesting a higher level of network formation and more prominent solvent-macromolecule interactions. Even though the rate of disintegration of the network (flow behavior index (n) ≈ 0.94) remained constant for the various intensities of Q P , the values of relaxation time constant (λc) increased with increasing intensity, which was consistent with the observed increase in the viscosity (Fig. 1c). Higher λc suggested establishing molecular chain entanglements, which can hinder the changes in the shear thinning behavior (Ramkumar & Bhattacharya, 1998). PEF-induced modification of the surface residues could increase bioconjugation reactions through hydrogen bonding and chain entanglements such as the molecular chain unfolding and exposure of amino and carboxyl groups on CS and ZN, could increase bioconjugation reactions through hydrogen bonding and chain entanglements (Rao, 2014; Xiang, Simpson, Ngadi, & Simpson, 2011). The findings imply that perturbations due to electric fields could accelerate particle disaggregation and subsequent reassembly into new structural formations. PEF-induced viscosity modifications have previously been reported in soymilk, where the viscosity increased from 6.62 (10−3 Pa s) to 7.46 (10−3 Pa s) and bovine skimmed milk from 2.12 (10−3 Pa s) to 4.25 (10−3 Pa s) using E P of 15–20 kV/cm (Xiang et al., 2011). Through prediction models, another study demonstrated that significant viscosity increases were expected due to the quadratic and interaction functions of Q P and E P (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). These studies attributed the changes in viscosity to enhanced inter-/intramolecular associations caused by either partial or complete unfolding, denaturation of proteins (Perez et al., 2004), enhanced ionization, polarisation, and ordering of polysaccharides polymer chains (Sung, Choi, Sohn, & Jhon, 2003). The unfolding of the protein and depolymerization of CS increased the reactivity of exposed amino and carbonyl groups, respectively, availing more protonated side groups for interaction with the cationic sites on other polymer chains (Turgeon, Schmitt, & Sanchez, 2007). However, excessive surface ionization of macromolecules occurring at high PEF intensity, for example, at E P > 2.4 kV/cm and Q P > 300 kJ/kg, can lead to the impairment of nucleation, aggregation, and network formation (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). This finding might explain the low viscosity curves observed when CZPP dispersions were exposed to an E P of 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg). The empirical Coz-Merz rule (CMR) was used to examine the nature of interactions and CZPP composite colloidal dispersions' microstructure. Curves obey CMR if the log-log plots of apparent viscosity (η a ) against the shear rate ( γ ˙ ) occur as a continuation or overlay of dynamic viscosity (ηʹ) against the angular frequency (ω). Polymer systems that follow CMR indicate that interactions are established by entanglement and not aggregation or specific physical interactions (Cox & Merz, 1958). Fig. 2 Shows that non-PEF dispersions failed to conform to CMR, with a dynamic viscosity ηʹ|(ω) that was always higher than the apparent viscosity ηa|(for the range of shear rate and angular frequency applied. The dispersions complied with CMR on varying the Q P at intensities 60–70 kJ/kg and 150–160 kJ/kg, notwithstanding the departures at low shear rates where ηʹ (ω) dominated over η a |( γ ˙ ) and the high deformation region (>200 s−1) when ηʹ|(ω) entered into the power-law, shear-thinning behavior. Conformity with CMR after subjecting the dispersions to PEF treatment suggested some extent of aggregate disintegration or molecular unfolding that aided the formation of entanglements, for example, through hydrogen bonding (Giteru, Cridge, et al., 2020; Nep et al., 2016; Taheri, Stanssens, & Samyn, 2016). The unfolding/depolymerization of protein and polysaccharide during PEF could promote extended chain conformation and exposure of multiple reactive sites heightening intermolecular entanglements that dominate over electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). The dispersions exhibited deviations from CMR when subjected to E P at 0.8–1.6 kV/cm, with the domination of either ηʹ|(ω) or η a | ( γ ˙ ) , respectively, implying that the number of weak macromolecular entanglements declined in favor of stronger particle-particle associations and aggregate formation via covalent interactions (Nep et al., 2016; Taheri et al., 2016). A further increase in E P to 3.4 kV/cm, however, resulted in compliance with the rule (Fig. 2b). Deviations from CMR have been reported in tragacanth gum/tragacanth gum-guar intermix (1 wt%) (Silva, Torres, Chenlo, & Moreira, 2017) and carboxymethyl guar gum (0.018–1 wt%) (Gao & Grady, 2018). Based on the authors', the departures from CMR are related to the presence of high-density molecular entanglements, such as those established by specific polymer/polymer interactions. Other possible causes of non-compliance include structured inter- and intramolecular associations, physical or chemical interactions (Calero, Muñoz, Ramírez, & Guerrero, 2010; Rao, 2014). In this study, interactions causing non-compliance with CMR could result from electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding, establishing the crosslinks between ZN, CS, PVOH, and PEG400 (Gao et al., 2018). The non-compliance at low shearing rates (<10 s−1) suggested structural decay from the strain applied due to weak and rapidly degrading interactions (Calero et al., 2010). 3.1.2 Z-average diameter and polydispersity index of CZPP composite dispersions Table 2 shows the Z-average (d. nm) and polydispersity index (PDI) of non-PEF and PEF-treated CZPP dispersions. The approximate range of the Z-average diameter in the non-PEF dispersions was 143.73 nm, with a PDI of 0.39. Compared to the non-PEF dispersions, larger diameters appeared when Q P of 150–400 kJ/kg was applied (p < 0.05). The increased particle diameter at Q P > 150 kJ/kg was attributable to the higher density of surface-active particles and particle-particle interactions through electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, causing stronger reaggregation of PEF-disaggregated units. The high PDI indicates smaller particles alongside large aggregates, perhaps contributed by the strong covalent intramolecular interactions among ZN molecular chains after partial/complete unfolding during PEF (Rodrigues et al., 2015). The Z-average diameter of the dispersions at 0.8 kV/cm did not differ from the non-PEF dispersions. However, increasing the E P from 0.8 to 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) caused significant intensity-dependent increases in the diameters, perhaps due to a higher level of aggregation. As this increase in diameter was accompanied by higher PDI (~0.54), it signaled the random nature of reassembly after PEF-induced disintegration. The particle size findings can be related to the observed PEF induced effects on rheological properties of the dispersions. Altogether, these results explain the observed deviations from CMR, where the large Z-average diameters at different Q P explains the source of molecular entanglements and hydrogen bonding. In earlier studies, the particle sizes of pectin, potato, konjac glucomannan, and corn starch have been reported to increase by elevating the PEF intensity (Ma et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2011). The authors interpreted the increase as reaggregation through hydrogen bonding after PEF-induced disintegration. The zeta (ζ) potential values of non-PEF and PEF-treated CZPP dispersions were summarised in Table 2. Native dispersions gave a ζ-potential of +28.74 mV, which was in the range of reported values (+31.1 mV for CS-ZN nanoparticles) (Li et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2019). As the ζ-potential depicts the magnitude of interparticle repulsion between adjacent molecules, the values obtained imply complexes' stability during the experiment. These values further depict that polymer-polymer interactions existed between CS, ZN, and PVOH, and PEG400. At the pH of the dispersions (pH 5.3), the protonated amino groups (NH3 +) of CS chains presented numerous sites for covalent and hydrogen bonding with the carbonyls and hydroxyl groups on ZN, PVOH, and PEG400 to develop complex coacervates (Li et al., 2018). Generally, subjecting the dispersions to PEF treatment resulted in higher ζ-potential, most probably related to the developed complexes dissociation. For instance, varying Q P from 60 kJ/kg to 400 kJ/kg resulted in significant increases in the ζ-potential to +32.75 mV at the highest intensity. A remarkable increase to +34.39, +37.94, +36.1 was realized in the ζ-potential when E P was varied between 0.8, 1.6 and 3.4 kV/cm respectively (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg). The findings indicate that E P and Q P were significant factors in modifying the dispersions' interfacial properties and portrayed a positive interaction between the two factors. Sharma, Oey, and Everett (2015) observed significant increases in the ζ-potential of milk, from −13.7 mV to ~ −15 mV by increasing E P from 20 to 26 kV/cm (continuous PEF system). The ζ-potential of egg white proteins increased marginally (−7.76 mV–9.9 mV) when subjected to PEF treatment at E P of 25 kV/cm (time of PEF exposure 200–800 μs, continuous PEF system) (Wu, Zhao, Yang, & Chen, 2014). These studies affirm the impact of PEF treatment on the interfacial properties of the composite biological systems. The current study shows that the impact of PEF on ζ-potential was proportional to the increase in PEF intensity, with Q P showing a higher impact than E P . From these findings, it was demonstrable that system perturbations during PEF could significantly cause disaggregation of molecular chains, enabling redistribution of surface-active moieties that participate in intermolecular interaction interactions with other molecules (Wu et al., 2014). Following Smoluchowski's theory (Eq. (1)), the ζ-potential is directly proportional to the sample viscosity, implying that an increase in surface charge density causes limited electrostatic repulsion between particles, which forms a particle network that yields the high viscosity observed during variations of both Q P and E P ."
14,Evaluating changes in physicochemical properties of films developed from non-PEF and PEF-treated CZPP dispersions,"3.2 Evaluating changes in physicochemical properties of films developed from non-PEF and PEF-treated CZPP dispersions 3.2.1 Changes in the functional groups using FTIR ATR-FTIR spectra of individual compounds (ZN, CS, and PVOH) and films developed from non-PEF and PEF-treated dispersions are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The spectra of ZN depict characteristic absorption bands at 3294, 3062–2872, 1650, 1536, 1449–1368, and 1457-1436 cm−1 representing O–H stretch (amide-A), N–H/C–H overlap, CO (amide-I), N–H (amide –II), -C-CH3 (amide-III) and C–N stretching/C–C due to the proline-rich segments respectively. The bands depicting chitosan occurred at 3340–3287, 2928–2882, 1635, and 1557 cm−1 representing O–H stretching/N–H overlap, C–H stretching, CO stretching/CN deformations, and CO of the acetylated units (–CO-NH2). The bands depicting PVOH occur at 3503–3420, 2941–2910, 1734–1717, 1660, and 1457 cm−1 representing O–H, C–H, aldehydes (H–CO)/C–O from acetate group, adsorbed water, and CH2 groups, respectively. The assignments of major peaks to functional groups were summarised in Table 3 . Films developed from non-PEF dispersions evidenced the contribution of individual compounds to the overall film structure. The Amide-A absorption band of the non-PEF films at ~3300 cm−1 (-N-H, O–H stretching overlap) increased relative to ZN and CS, perhaps due to the OH contributed by PVOH. However, it broadened to cover ~3000 cm−1 depicting carboxyl groups (COO−) contributed by ZN. Similarly, the bands at ~2920 cm−1 and 2880 cm−1 (C–H stretching of CH2 aliphatic group) in the composite film broadened, and the absorption intensified compared to individual ZN and CS , despite the slight increase observed due to the C–H from PVOH. These findings suggested crosslinking action for network development in the film. The peaks in the amide regions (I, II, III) at 1652-1250 cm−1 showed the shifting of vibration frequencies and variations in the absorption intensities in the assembled films, suggesting various conjugation interactions of different molecules. For instance, the CO peak at 1648/1634 cm−1 in the films (CS/ZN) shifted to 1652 cm−1 suggesting the release of the alpha-helical structures for bioconjugation reactions (Barth, 2007). Similarly, the prominence of the band at 1095 cm−1 and smoothening of adjacent regions suggested the enhancement of ester linkages (C–O–C and C–OH stretching). The CC at ~1600 cm−1 and 1500 cm−1 from the PVOH spectra disappeared in the developed films, which confirmed CS-PVOH-ZN interactions. Composite dispersions subjected to Q P (kJ/kg) (Fig. 3a) displayed weaker absorption bands at ~ 2920 cm−1, relative to the non-PEF films. The lobe at ~2870 cm−1 (-C-H-) showed marginal enlargement (higher absorption), which was also reflected in the amide region. However, at Q P = 60–70 kJ/kg, the bands' absorption in the amide region decreased, suggesting structural disintegration of the ordered chains. The region at ~1095 cm−1 (-C-O-H- stretching of inter-/intramolecular hydrogen bond) shows that new ester linkages developed during the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), a confirmation provided by the new peaks at 1076 cm−1. Increasing the energy to 150–160 kJ/kg and 385–400 kJ/kg resulted in a more intensified peak at 1095 cm−1 and migrated it to the vibration frequencies of ~1076 cm−1 and 1074 cm−1 and a split between a second peak at ~1031 cm−1 and 1032 cm−1 respectively. These findings indicate the formation of C–O–C (ester) linkages between the amines and the carboxyl units exposed during PEF, a reliable indicator of the disintegration of macromolecules during PEF and subsequent bioconjugation reactions. The establishment of new peaks at 1471 cm−1 (N–H deformation) in the PEF treated samples evidenced interactions between ZN, CS, PVOH, and PEG400. Bioconjugation of ZN can occur due to higher reactivity of exposed residues of tryptophan (Trp) and Tyrosine (Tyr) from the unfolding of the protein during PEF treatment (Liu, Ma, McClements, & Gao, 2017). Similar trends were observed when E P was varied between 0.8 and 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) (Fig. 3b). The peak at 1095 cm−1 shifted to lower vibration frequencies, 1088, 1072, and 1068 cm−1 on treatment at 0.8, 1.6, and 3.4 kV/cm, respectively, and established a secondary peak at ~1031 cm−1. These shifts implied an enhancement of C–O stretching vibration (C–O–C, C–O–H, and CH2OH of the ester linkages) due to interactions between the components. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2017), such enhancement suggested glycosylation of ZN, which acquired higher levels of C–OH during covalent interactions with CS. The signaling attribute of PEF-induced changes in the secondary structure was the amide-I peak position where the native film gave a peak at 1651.7 cm−1 (CO of the peptide, hydrogen bonding in the α-helix of the protein secondary structure). Increasing Q P and E P shifted the peaks to 1655-1654 cm−1 and 1655-1656 cm−1, respectively. Typically, hydrogen bonding to the CO group lowers the amide-I vibration frequency (Barth, 2007), but our data show an increase in the vibration frequency after PEF indicating a decrease in the α-helix and random coil fractions. In part, these results evidence the destruction of α-helices (secondary structure) of ZN and CS in the film after PEF treatment, resulting in a disaggregated matrix. Another notable effect of PEF on the structure-function relationship in the film was the change in hydration properties of the proteins and other structural units. This finding was evidenced by an upward shift of the peak at 1542 cm−1 in non-PEF films to 1544 cm−1 and 1545 cm−1 (Núñez-Flores et al., 2013) under Q P and E P variations, respectively. While limited associations can be drawn concerning the effects of the observed changes in FTIR spectra on the dispersions' colloidal properties, impacts of functional groups interactions on the physicochemical properties of films have been reported. A study by Chen, Dong, Zhao, Li, and Chen (2019) found that cold plasma treatment of zein could increase the exposure of hydrophilic groups and that this then resulted in the higher surface hydrophilicity of ZN-CS composite films. The authors also found that an increase in the ordered secondary structure (α- and β-helices) caused improvement in the films' thermal stability, moisture barrier, and mechanical properties. 3.2.2 Thermal stability of CZPP composite films using DSC and TGA The complex formation and crosslinking properties of CZPP composite films under PEF treatment were investigated using DSC and TGA. The melting profiles of the films on subjecting to various Q P and E P were summarised in Supplementary Table S1. For non-PEF films, multiple glass transition temperatures (Tg) at 85–141 °C were attributable to the existence of a heterogeneous system (Sun, Dai, Liu, & Gao, 2016). The transition at 141 °C represented dissociations of some hydrogen bonds that may have originated from the transitions of CS and its derivatives, whereas those at 85–125 °C transitions could emanate from the loss of moisture and degradation of PEG400 and ZN (Yang, Su, Leu, & Yang, 2004). PEF treatment at Q P of 60–160 kJ/kg persevered these transitions but increasing the intensity to 385–400 kJ/kg led to the disappearance of the peak at 112 °C. When subjected to E P (0.8 kV/cm), the films showed higher temperatures at second and third Tg and Tg (Supplementary data, Table S1), but a further increase in intensity to 1.6 kV/cm or 3.4 kV/cm resulted in the disappearance of the peaks at 112.61 °C. These findings were attributable to the PEF-induced disruption of pre-existing interactions and reestablishment of intermolecular linkages to form thermal-stable and homogenous matrices. For the non-PEF films, the overall melting peak (TM) (204 °C) and enthalpy (ΔHM) (230.23 J/g) suggested the establishment of a composite film matrix through inter-/intramolecular interactions and crosslinking reactions (Senna et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2004). Subjecting the dispersions to Q P at 60–400 kJ/kg resulted in lower TM (184.58 °C–197.91 °C) and ΔHM (202.83–228.17 J/g), which could be attributed to the development of an amorphous film matrix resulting from the changes in solution properties. These findings reaffirmed the loss of the crystalline regions observed in XRD and suggested disrupting the film development process due to modifications of interfacial properties. These can be related to the destruction of the crystalline phases and established coacervates. Besides, the thermal transition data corroborates the SEM microstructural images depicting amorphous structure at E P of 3.4 kV/cm. Thermal stability determined using TGA corresponded to the dissociation potential of CZPP-films Fig. 4 . (a)-(b). The decomposition proceeded in two stages (~175 °C–~520 °C) with peaks at 290 °C (peak 1) and 400 °C (peak 2). The mass plateau region during the second degradation cycle indicated the presence of multiple components in the films. PEF treatments at different Q P did not modify the onset of degradation. However, increasing the energy to >160 kJ/kg resulted in a higher degradation peak. A similar trend was observed in the overall rate of degradation (increase to 5.49 from 5.37%.min/°C) (Supplementary data, Table S2), which implied that PEF-induced modifications of the functional groups resulted in strong covalent interactions (Wu, Sakabe, & Isobe, 2003). Of the CZPP films developed from the dispersions treated at varying E P , 0.8 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) resulted in higher onset temperatures of degradation. These films' higher perceived thermal stability was perhaps due to the high level of hydrogen bonding and covalent interactions during the assembly of biomacromolecules. There was a delayed onset of the first and second degradation phases for the E P treatments, which suggested strong inter-/intramolecular interactions and a compact film matrix formation. 3.2.3 Mechanical properties of CZPP composite films Mechanical properties, including tensile strength (TS), modulus of elasticity (EM), yield stress (YS), and elongation at break (EAB %), were characterized to understand the films' integrity during handling and storage. The moisture content (MC) of the films (12.02–14.46%) and thickness (40–51 μm) (Table 4 ) did not differ (p > 0.05) among the treatments. However, the observed moisture levels were significant due to the critical role of sample hydration in maintaining structural stability and its effect on the plasticization of the film matrix (Bouman et al., 2015). The determined MC was within the range of previously observed levels in protein or polysaccharide films (Yuan et al., 2016). The obtained values of tensile properties ranged from 19.02 to 29.96 MPa (TS), EM ranged from 377.74 to 503.53 MPa (EM), 18.20–23.04 MPa (YS), and 12.48–31.75% (EAB), which were comparable with previously reported values of ZN/CS composite films (Arcan & Yemenicioğlu, 2013; Giteru et al., 2019). Generally, the treatment of CZPP dispersions with Q P of 60–70 kJ/kg enhanced the films' mechanical properties, suggesting enhanced polymer-polymer inter-/intramolecular interactions, which enabled the formation of a more compact film matrix. Increasing Q P to 150–400 kJ/kg decreased the films' stiffness (EM) but did not affect TS, YS, and EAB. The stiffness may have reduced due to higher protein-/polysaccharide-plasticizer interactions and enhanced macromolecule-water complexes established during intensified perturbations at the high-intensity PEF. The role of PEF in grafting reactions between the proteins' carboxyl and (COO−) and the polysaccharides' amine (NH3 +) moieties among other OH− interactions was earlier demonstrated in ZN–CS–PVOH (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020; Giteru et al., 2018a) bovine serum albumin-dextran (Guan et al., 2010) and whey protein isolate-dextran intermix (Sun, Yu, Zeng, Yang, & Jia, 2011). The α-helix of zein, which has previously been reported to exhibit high stability against modification conditions, was shown to yield rigid structures (Hsu, Weng, Liao, & Chen, 2005). Thus, the decrease in EM after the treatment of the CZPP dispersions at 385–400 kJ/kg underpins the observed destruction of the secondary structure in the ATR-FTIR findings. Besides, the increase in hydratable functional groups observed in ATR-FTIR could trap more water into the network structure of the composite film leading to lower stiffness (Escamilla-García et al., 2013). As expected, the delivery of higher Q P (585–633 kJ/kg) at varying levels of E P (0.8, 1.6, and 3.4 kV/cm) increased the TS, EM, and YS of the composite films, which was attributable to an increase in polymer-polymer chain bindings due to enhanced ZN-CS covalent bonding under heightened levels of perturbation over prolonged durations. These observations can also relate to the effect of PEF on the functional groups reported in ATR-FTIR, where stronger ester linkages (C–O–C) were established between the amines and the carboxyl units of the protein and polysaccharide, which had been exposed during PEF. Modification of ZN and exposure of buried functional groups, for example, the release of α-amino groups of N-terminal amino acids and ε-amino groups of lysine in the protein (Giteru, Cridge, et al., 2020). The previous study demonstrated the potential of PEF to increase the reactivity of ZN surface residues by dismantling aggregates and some covalent linkages, allowing bioconjugation with CS, PVOH, and PEG 400 to occur. These observations were also manifested in the high thermal stability observed in TGA. Moreover, the more robust interpolymer bonding experience at E P varying from 0.8 kV/cm to 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) resulted in a remarkable decrease in the flexibility of the films (EAB = 12.48–17.06%), p < 0.05. This decrease in EAB may be related to the high-density interactions between ZN, CS, and PVOH via hydrophobic, electrostatic, or hydrogen bond interactions that reduced the film matrix's molecular chain mobility. 3.2.4 Stability in wet environments and water vapor permeability of PEF-treated CZPP composite films The stability of bio-based materials in wet environments depicts their microstructural development level, hydration potential, and flaws occurring during biomacromolecular assembly. The ability of the film to withstand swelling in wet environments was investigated by submerging the films in deionized (DI) water or Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) at 20 °C (Fig. 5 ). The swelling index of the films in water (~253%) decreased to 235–240% (p < 0.05) when CZPP dispersions were submitted to Q P (60–400 kJ/kg) (Fig. 5a). Similarly, increasing the E P from 0.8 kV/cm to 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the swelling capacity of the composite films in water. Swelling capacity is a consequence of the interactions between ionizable groups of macromolecules and free ions of water. Thus, the swelling index can be reduced by modifying macromolecules' interfacial properties to reduce water-macromolecule interactions (Yang et al., 2017). The observed differences in the films' swelling capacity could be attributed to PEF induced reduction of interactions between the film components and water. Generally, biomacromolecules present significantly low swelling capacity in buffer at or near-neutral pH (7.0–8.0) (Giteru et al., 2019; Wang, Jiang, Duan, & Shao, 2013). CZPP films exhibited remarkably low swelling capacity in the buffer (4.23–13.4%), with significant decreases (p < 0.05) occurring after PEF treatment at Q P of 60–160 kJ/kg or E P of 0.8–1.6 kV/cm. A study by Kim et al. (2008) found that the orientation of surface residues (charged heads) of molecules or aggregating units depended on the nature of the surrounding environment. The buffer at pH 7.8 reduced the degree of ionization of CS and ZN (isoelectric point ~ pH 6.2) while increasing the surface residues' tendency to express negative charges (Sağlam, Venema, de Vries, & van der Linden, 2013). Coupled with the PEF-induced conformational changes and subsequent exposure of previously buried hydrophobic units, the reduced degree of ionization could promote inter-/intra-molecular hydrophobic, covalent (sulfhydryl-disulfide), or electrostatic interactions, resulting in the development of a more compact film structure. Moreover, the excessive perturbations exerted at E P of 3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) caused disaggregation of developing aggregates in the dispersion (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020), perhaps disrupting the process of network formation during evaporation induced self-assembly hence a higher swelling capacity in the buffer. The films’ ability to withstand degradation in wet environments was investigated using water (control) and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) at 25 °C. The erosion index of the films indicates affinities to the solvent environment and the strength of interactions. A high erosion index suggests a rapidly degrading material, making it a critical parameter to consider when evaluating potential applications of the material (Laohakunjit & Noomhorm, 2004). For instance, delivery materials for bioactive substances are required to remain intact after hydration and swelling to allow gradual and slow-release profiles (Arcan et al., 2011). In general, PEF treatment resulted in higher stability (p < 0.05) of the films against degradation in water and buffered medium at pH 7.8 (Fig. 6 ). The higher stability in the buffered medium (pH 7.8) compared to water (Fig. 6b) could be related to the enhancement, as mentioned earlier, of inter/intermolecular interactions under reduced ionization conditions for both CS and ZN molecular chains. As shown under thermal stability, the low erosion ratio could be attributed to the increase in the density of active surface hydrophobic residues, which increased the strength of interactions during the assembly into the compact and continuous matrix (Han, Zeng, Yu, Zhang, & Chen, 2009). Although the films presented a high swelling ratio in the buffered medium (Fig. 5 (b)–(c)), they did show exceptional stability against degradation in the medium, which demonstrated the significance of the synergistic relationship of PEF-induced inter/molecular interactions and hydrophobicity of ZN molecules. The WVP values of non-PEF and PEF treated CZPP composite films were between 0.26 and 0.30 g mm/m2·h·kPa, which agreed with previously reported values (Cheng et al., 2015; Giteru et al., 2019). Typically, PEF-treated films showed lower (p < 0.05) WVP (0.26–0.29 g mm/m2·h·kPa) compared to the non-PEF counterparts, confirming that PEF modified interactions gave higher particle-particle associations and formation of denser film matrices. Potentially, the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds through bioconjugation of ZN with CS suppressed hygroscopic moieties, for instance, amino and carboxyl groups, reducing the affinity of the films towards the water molecules (Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Giteru, Oey, & Ali, 2018b). PEF-induced protein unfolding and subsequent exposure of the initially buried surface free sulfhydryls (SH) and hydrophobic groups have been reported (Li et al., 2007). The freed SH groups are precursors for physical interactions (e.g., hydrophobic and electrostatic) and covalent disulfide (S–S) interactions. The study by Li et al. (2007) reported a decrease in the swelling index of soy protein isolate treated using PEF (time of PEF exposure = 72–288 μs, E P = 30 kV/cm), which they attributed to the protein denaturation and aggregation via covalent (S–S) and hydrophobic interactions. In our study, the synergy between PEF-induced interactions and the hydrophobic nature of zein could decrease the affinity to water molecules and suppress the diffusion across the film matrix."
15,Crystallinity and microstructural morphology of CZPP composite films,"3.3 Crystallinity and microstructural morphology of CZPP composite films The structural formations of the composite films were analyzed using the diffraction effect of X-rays (scanning range 5° ≤ θ ≤ 35°) on the crystalline components. Typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of films cast using non-PEF and PEF treated dispersions are shown in Fig. 7 . The crystalline properties of individual compounds (CS, ZN, and PVOH) and their cast matrices have been reported (Giteru et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2017). In the current study, characteristic peaks for ZN appeared at ~8.5° and 20.5° (2θ), CS at 11.6° (2θ) and 18.9° (2θ), and polyvinyl alcohol at 19° (2θ). The distinct appearance of the peaks suggested a degree of incompatibility of the macromolecules constituting the films. The low intensity of the peaks compared to PEF treated samples show that the films acquired amorphous character. Increasing Q P from 60 kJ/kg to 400 kJ/kg resulted in higher crystallinity of the films, with new peaks appearing at 9.5°, 10.5°, and 16° (2θ). The higher crystallinity in PEF-treated films could result from higher intermolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions during the film assembly (Escamilla-García et al., 2013; Souza et al., 2010). Similarly, increasing E P led to higher crystallinity, which agreed with earlier reports showing enhanced crystallinity of films developed after dispersions were subjected to electric fields (Balau, Lisa, Popa, Tura, & Melnig, 2004; Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020; Souza et al., 2010). Balau et al. (2004) observed an increase in the crystallinity of CS films with development of peaks at 9°, 17°, 20°, and 23° (2θ) when the films were annealed (180 °C for 30 min) at E P of 20 kV/cm (alternating current, AC, 50 Hz). In another study, the processing of biomacromolecules at too high PEF intensity potentially damaged the crystalline regions of ZN/CS/PVOH/PEG films by increasing the number of hydrophilic sites disrupted the packing of polymer-chains (Giteru, Ali, & Oey, 2020). Senna et al. (2010) demonstrated a gradual increase in the crystallinity of CS films with new peaks appearing at 8–10° (2θ) at an increasing intensity of E P (0.1–0.2 kV/cm, ohmic heating, AC, 50 Hz, 60 °C, 2 cm electrode gap). These results indicate that E P at varying intensities could modify biomacromolecular interactions and influence their crystallinity. The cross-sectional morphologies of non-PEF films and PEF treated samples represented by those submitted to E P 0.8–3.4 kV/cm (Q P = 585–633 kJ/kg) are shown in Fig. 8 . The surface morphology depicts the fusion of two phases forming the continuous film matrix. The roughness may be attributed to aggregates of zein and composites of biomacromolecules formed during the removal of the solvent. The mechanisms involved in the fusion of zein macromolecules to form a continuous film matrix were reported by Wang and Padua (2010). In a three-stage EISA process, nucleation occurs and grows to form spheres during the initial stages of the solvent removal. In the subsequent stages, the spheres grow in an onion-like manner and fuse to form aggregates that eventually coalesce into a continuous film. Fig. 8 depicts a reduction in the surface roughness with increasing E P , where smoother matrix appeared at 1.6 and 3.4 kV/cm, clearly showing thermodynamic incompatibility (mutually segregated interactions) in non-PEF and PEF intensity of 0.8 kV/cm. Examining the cross-sectional morphology from the non-PEF and PEF treatment at 0.8 kV/cm depicts an amorphous-like structure and layers of loosely connected sheets. It was evident that increasing the PEF intensity to 1.6 kV/cm, and 3.4 kV/cm could modify the surface properties of biopolymer, allowing more interactions through complex coacervation (associating biopolymers with the exclusion of the solvent) (Turgeon et al., 2003). Thus, both the surface and cross-section of the films developed from the dispersions subjected to E P of 1.6 and 3.4 kV/cm established continuous and regular structural formations, which was strongly correlated with the observed viscosity, particle size, zeta potential, and crystalline formations. These findings reaffirm that energy delivered during PEF caused the disintegration of molecular chains and pre-existing aggregates, inducing modification of the sphere environment in the dispersions (Morren, Roodenburg, & de Haan, 2003). This influenced the manner of molecular aggregation and subsequent coalescence of the aggregates into continuous films."
16,Conclusions,"This study elucidates the potential interactions between ZN, CS, PVOH, and PEG400 when subjected to treatment under PEF at various intensities. Based on the combination of PEF parameters investigated, the study provides scientific evidence showing that the dispersions and films' characteristics were affected differently. The zero-shear viscosity was increased on the application of specific energy ≥150–400 kJ/kg (3.4 kV/cm, 50 Hz) and electric field strength ≥1.6 kV/cm (585–633 kJ/kg). Similarly, the zeta potential increased significantly across the whole range of PEF parameters applied, which showed the contribution of PEF towards depolymerization and conformational alterations of surface residues. FTIR data showed changes to the films' secondary structure related to bioconjugation reactions between ZN, CS, and PVOH. The development of new ester linkages and glycosylation of zein were also observed when various PEF conditions were applied. Enhancement of intermolecular interactions at the specific energy of 150–400 kJ/kg and electric field strength of 1.6–3.4 kV/cm resulted in higher crystallinity and regular morphology as observed using XRD and SEM, respectively. Furthermore, the tensile strength and stiffness also increased with the increasing crosslinking level after the treatments. This study demonstrates that PEF processing can exert a dual effect on ZN–CS–PVOH-PEG400 dispersions and films; on the one hand, it can establish a new conformational arrangement between macromolecules allowing polymerization reactions. On the other hand, severe disintegration of macromolecules can occur under high-intensity PEF leading to poor development of a film matrix."
