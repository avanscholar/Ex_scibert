0,Introduction,"The diversified glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family includes enzymes from Archaea to Eukaryotes that are dependent of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a prosthetic group [1,2]. The GMC members show diverse catalytic activity oxidizing a broad range of substrates such as aryl-alcohols (AAOx), methanol (MOx), pyranose (POx) and glucose (GOx) or acting as dehydrogenases of cellobiose (CDH) or glucose (GDH) [3]. Aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAOx; EC 1.1.3.7) are monomeric, two-domain oxidoreductases that catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of primary alcohols from aromatic or aliphatic unsaturated alcohols to aldehydes using oxygen as a final electron acceptor with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [4–6]. These enzymes can also oxidize some aromatic aldehydes (p-nitrotrobenzaldehyde) to acids [7,8]. In Pleurotus sp., H2O2 is generated continuously by AAOx in the redox cycling of the most abundant extracellular fungal metabolite, p-anisaldehyde [9,10]. On the other hand, in lignolytic fungi the H2O2 produced by AAOx can be used by lignin and manganese-dependent peroxidases (LiP and MnP) or in synergy with laccases increasing the ·OH radical production [9,11]. Lignin degradation is a fundamental process necessary to enhance biomass accessibility and decrease the inhibition of cellulases by lignin degradation products [9,12]. “In situ” and “in vivo” production of H2O2 generate hydroxyl radicals that directly attack biomass structural components through Fenton chemistry [13,14]. Oxygen activation to H2O2 via oxidases is considered a common mechanism employed by fungi in biomass degradation [15]. Apart from intracellular enzymes, glyoxal oxidase, pyranose-2-oxidase and aryl-alcohol oxidase are the only enzymes reported to be involved in lignin degradation [16,17]. Moreover, oxidation of aromatic monomers released from biomass degradation processes could reduce their toxic effect on fungal growth [18]. AAOx has been classified by the carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org), into subfamily AA3_2, one of the Auxiliary Activity (AA) superfamily that also includes glucose oxidases and dehydrogenases [19,20]. Other reported biotechnological application of AAOx is the conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), a derived product from glucose/fructose dehydration and a strong inhibitor of fermentation processes, to chemicals such as 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) or 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA) [21]. Both DFF and FFCA are intermediates in the 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) synthesis pathway. FDCA can be polymerized to poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate), a bioplastic and potential substitute for polyester based materials [21,22]. The first and currently the only crystal structure of AAOx family members, the enzyme from Pleurotus eryngii, revealed an elongated structure with two structural domains: a conserved FAD binding domain and a variable substrate binding domain [23]. The N-terminal canonical FAD binding domain is composed by an ADP-binding β-α-β-fold motif with a similar overall architecture shared by all GMC oxidoreductases [3]. On the other hand, the substrate binding domain varies in structure among AA3 members [23]. Site-directed mutagenesis studies supported the structural data and mapped two histidine residues (H502 and H546) close to FAD co-factor and two aromatic residues (Y92 and F501) essential for catalysis [6,16,24]. The catalytic mechanism of AAOx occurs in two half-reactions: (a) the reductive step involving a two-electron oxidation of the primary alcohol by FAD, yielding the aldehyde product and the reduced flavin, and (b) the oxidative step involving a two-electron reduction of O2 by FADH2, releasing H2O2 and regenerating FAD [4,24]. Thermothelomyces thermophilus M77 (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila) is a thermophilic ascomycete and a source of many glycoside hydrolases and oxidative enzymes assisting the breakdown of lignocellulosic materials [25–27]. This fungus has been used as a host for the expression of homologous and heterologous thermostable enzymes [25,28,29]. These enzymes were discovered by collaborative projects of whole genome sequencing (Genome Portal, Joint Genome Institute, University of California) and are corroborated by transcriptome and proteome data [25,26,30]. Notably, no lignin or manganese peroxidase where identified in T. thermophilus genomic and secretomic studies performed in cellulolytic conditions [26] compared with P. eryngii [31], suggesting another pathway for lignin degradation. Moreover, MtAAOx has been used as a reporter enzyme in Aspergillus nidulans in order to define growth conditions to prevent melanin formation. The production of this pigment consumes carbon sources and reduces enzyme production [32,33]. Since 1960 when the first AAOx was initially characterized [34], only two crystal structures of aryl-alcohol oxidase, both from P. eryngii, were reported [23,35]. Although this enzyme was also expressed in Aspergillus nidulans [36], the protein used for crystallization assay was produced in a prokaryotic expression system that required a refolding process. Therefore, there is a need for new and novel biochemical and structural data for enzymes such as the oxidases from subfamily AA3_2 [8,37]. In this study, we elucidated the first glycosylated and non-refolded crystal structure of an AAOx from T. thermophilus at 2.6 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. MtAAOx shows previously undescribed structural differences in the catalytic tunnel which could have an impact on the enzyme specificity. Our biochemical and structural data reveal the stabilizing effect of Ca2+ ion on enzyme temperature resistance and activity."
1,Material and methods,
2,Bioinformatic analysis,"2.1 Bioinformatic analysis The putative AA3 genes were automatically annotated on T. thermophilus genome sequence using the Homology to Peptide Patterns (Hotpep) tool [38]. The amino acid sequence of 38 members of AA3 family were obtained from CAZy database [19,39]. Other 14 characterized enzymes were included in this set [20,40]. The sequences were submitted to multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE [41]. Protein sequence analysis of AAOx was performed using the neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA software v6 [42]. The consensus tree was inferred using a bootstrap of 1000 replicates."
3,Chemicals and reagents,"2.2 Chemicals and reagents Chemicals, biochemicals and enzymes were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), Invitrogen, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) was purchased from New England Biolabs. All chemicals were grade or equivalents."
4,Fungal strains,"2.3 Fungal strains Aspergillus nidulans A773 cell factory (pyrG89; wA3; pyroA4) was obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Culture (FGSG, Manhattan, Kansas, USA). T. thermophilus M77 was also obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC# 26436). T. thermophilus M77 was maintained at 45 °C on potato dextrose agar (PDA)."
5,Molecular cloning of MtAAOx,"2.4 Molecular cloning of MtAAOx The MtAAOx gene (MYCTH_2299749) from T. thermophilus M77 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA without the original signal peptide. The PCR product was amplified using the oligonucleotide primers forward (5’-gggttggcaGCAAGCATCC CACGTCCCCATGCCAAGCG-’3) and reverse (5′- gtcccgtgccggttaTCACTGCTCCTTGTCCATCCACTCC-’3) in 50 μL using the Phusion high-fidelity polymerase (Thermo Fisher) with the following components: 10 μL 5× GC buffer, 2.5 μL 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μM each primer, 1 μL gDNA, 0.5 μL Phusion polymerase. PCR cycle conditions were 98 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 72 °C for 10 min for the final extension. The 1917 bp gene product was cloned into the pEXPYR vector that contains a wild-type pyrG complementing gene [43] using the Ligation-Independent Cloning protocol (LIC) [44]. That construct allows to express the target gene using a glucoamylase promoter and signal peptide to obtain the secreted enzyme. The plasmid was transformed in A. nidulans A773 and the oversecreting clone were further selected by their ability to grow in the absence of uracil and uridine [43] and for the production of the recombinant enzyme."
6,Expression and purification of the recombinant enzyme,"2.5 Expression and purification of the recombinant enzyme MtAAOx expression strain was grown at 37 °C on solid minimum medium containing 9.0 g/L glucose, 50 mL/L of 20× Clutterbuck salt solution (120 g/L NaNO3, 10.4 g/L KCl, 10.4 g/L MgSO4, 30.4 g/L KH2PO4), 1 mL 1000× trace element solution (22 g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 11 g/L H3BO3, 5.0 g/L MnCl2·7H2O, 5.0 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 1.6 g/L CoCl2·5H2O, 1.6 g/L, CuSO4·5H2O, 1.1 g/L Na2MoO4·4H2O, 50 g/L Na2-EDTA), 1 mg/L pyridoxine and 15% (w/v) agar. The pH was adjusted to 6.5. Approximately 107 spores/mL produced were inoculated in 3 L of liquid minimal medium replacing glucose by 5% (w/v) maltose for expression and maintained in static culture at 37 °C for 48 h. MtAAOx was purified from total secreted proteins using three chromatographic steps. The culture medium was filtered using Miracloth membrane (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) with a pore size of 22–25 μm and the secreted enzyme was concentrated by tangential flow filtration using hollow fiber cartridge (5000 Da cut-off) (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and immediately applied onto a 10 mL DEAE-Sephadex column. MtAAOx was eluted with a stepwise gradient (200, 300, 400 and 500 mM) NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The purified samples were concentrated using centrifugal filter concentrator 30,000 MWCO (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with salt adjusted to 20 mM and applied onto a Q-Sepharose High-Performance column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The enzyme was eluted using a linear gradient to 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M sodium chloride, pH 8.0. The fractions containing MtAAOx were combined, concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Sephadex75 size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) with a running buffer consisting of 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0. The purified protein was quantified spectrophotometrically at 280 nm according to the Lambert-Beer law using a molar extinction coefficient of 96,050 M−1 cm−1 provided by ExPASy ProtParam [45]. The protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE [46] stained with Coomassie blue G-250 and the protein identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry."
7,Deglycosylation reaction,"2.6 Deglycosylation reaction MtAAOx deglycosylation was performed using EndoH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 6 mg of pure MtAAOx was incubated with 500 U of EndoH overnight at 37 °C. The deglycosylated MtAAOx was separated from EndoH by size exclusion chromatography. The deglycosylation was checked by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry."
8,Spectral characterization,"2.7 Spectral characterization All spectral measurements were performed at room temperature in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 using an Infinite M200 Pro (Tecan) spectrophotometer. Reduction of 163 μM MtAAOx was performed using 1 mM veratryl alcohol after 1 min of incubation at room temperature and the changes monitored by far-UV absorption spectrum. To determine FAD:MtAAOx stoichiometry, MtAAOx was denatured by boiling for 10 min to release FAD. The sample was centrifuged to remove denatured protein and the supernatant absorbance at 450 nm was measured. For calculation of FAD concentration in solution, the extinction coefficient of 11,300 M−1 cm−1 at 450 nm was used [47]."
9,Mass spectrometry analysis,"2.8 Mass spectrometry analysis The peptide mass fingerprint was performed by in-gel digestion. The Coomassie stained protein band was removed from the SDS-PAGE 12% gel and submitted to in-gel trypsin (20 ng/μL) digestion after its reduction and alkylation. An aliquot of digested product (1 μL) was desalted by a ZipTip C18 column and mixed with 1 μL of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (HCCA) matrix at 10 mg/mL and was allowed to dry over the sample plate. The measurement was done in the linear positive-ion mode at room temperature within a range of 400–3300 m/z. Average masses were assigned and processed using flexAnalysisTM software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The mass fingerprint search was done using BioToolsTM (Bruker Daltonics) and the peptide m/z list generated in silico by computational tryptic digestion of protein amino acid sequence. The intact mass analysis of glycosylated and deglycosylated profiles of MtAAOx were performed by cocrystallization with sinapinic acid matrix (10 mg.mL−1) in 50% acetonitrile (v/v)/1% TFA (v/v) in the ratio of 1: 1. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded in the range of m/z 25,000–100,000 in the positive linear mode. Around 10 mass spectra were recorded by averaging 500 laser shots. Mass calibration was carried out using Protein Standard II (Bruker Daltonics). All measurements were taken using Microflex LT MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics)."
10,Substrate specificity and the enzyme kinetics,"2.9 Substrate specificity and the enzyme kinetics The oxidase activity of MtAAOx was measured at 30 °C in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0. The enzymatic assay was monitored following the production of H2O2 measured using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-couple assay with Amplex Red reagent (Invitrogen). The oxidation of 60 μM Amplex Red by 6 U/mL HRP in presence of H2O2 was measured in a kinetic mode at 560 nm. Alternatively, the enzymatic activity was followed spectrophotometrically (520 nm) using 0.2 mM 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCPIP) as a final electron acceptor when the substrate inhibited horseradish peroxidase activity. All measurements were performed using the Synergy™ HTX Multi-Mode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France). The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were determined using 25 mM veratryl alcohol as a substrate in citrate-glycine-phosphate buffer. The temperature stability of the enzyme was measured by determining its residual activity after incubating MtAAOx at 50, 60 and 70 °C followed by cooling on ice. The activity measurement was performed following the DCPIP reduction for the above experiments. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The kinetic constants were estimated in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 at 30 °C using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-couple assay with Amplex Red and the following substrates: 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (anisyl alcohol), veratryl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) in a range of 0.025–40 mM. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using a non-linear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The kinetic data were fitted using OriginPro 8 (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA, USA)."
11,Effect of additives,"2.10 Effect of additives The effects of 1 mM K+, Ba2+,Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Sr2+ and Zn2+ or 20% (v/v) ethanol, 0,1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (v/v) Tween 20 on enzyme activity were evaluated. Reaction mixtures consisted of 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0, 0.5 μM MtAAOx and 0.2 mM DCPIP, were incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. Reaction was started with the addition of 5 mM veratryl alcohol, and the absorbance at 600 nm was followed at 30 °C."
12,Identification of oxidized products,"2.11 Identification of oxidized products The oxidized products of MtAAOx on 5-HMF were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm × 7.8 mm) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Chromatography was carried out at 65 °C with 5 mM sulfuric acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Eluted peaks of 5-HMF, 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA) were detected by UV absorption at 276 nm. The oxidation of 5-HMF (1 mM) by MtAAOx (5 μM) was performed in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 for 24 h at 50 °C. The reaction was diluted with 300 μL water and 60 μL 1 M HCl. The solution containing denatured protein was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for injection onto the column. Purified 5-HMF, DFF, FFCA and FDCA (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as standards."
13,Circular dichroism,"2.12 Circular dichroism Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed with Jasco J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (JASCO Inc., Maryland, USA) using 0.2 mg/mL MtAAOx in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The measurements were performed using a 0.1 cm path length quartz cell. The far-UV spectra were recorded in a wavelength range of 200–260 nm, 0.2 nm bandwidth, at the speed of 50 nm/min. The data were obtained by signal averaging six spectra before subtracting the buffer spectrum and are reported as mean residue ellipticity (MRW). The final data were obtained by signal averaging six spectra before subtracting the buffer spectrum and are reported as a mean residue ellipticity (MRW). The thermal denaturation experiments were performed following the ellipticity (θ) at 222 nm wavelength at a constant rate of 1 °C/min with 0.2 mg/mL of MtAAOx in a temperature range from 25 to 90 °C."
14,ThermoFluor assay,"2.13 ThermoFluor assay The ThermoFluor assay (TSA) was carried out in an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Reactions with 22 μM MtAAOx, SYPRO Orange dye (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), with or without 100 mM additives, were prepared in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 on a 96-well plate. The plate was sealed with Optical-Quality Sealing Tape (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and heated from 25 to 90 °C, with stepwise increments of 1 °C per minute and a 30 s hold step for every point, followed by the fluorescence reading with excitation/emission wavelengths at 490/530 nm."
15,Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements and glycosylation modeling,"2.14 Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements and glycosylation modeling Small-angle X-ray scattering data measurements were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (Campinas, Brazil) at D01B-SAXS1 beamline using a Pilatus 2 M detector (Dectris, Baden-Daettwil, Switzerland) covering momentum transfer range of 0.01 Å−1 < q < 0.49 Å−1 (q = 4πsinθ/λ, with 2θ being the scattering angle and the λ the wavelength). Ten SAXS data frames were collected with a short exposure time (each collected frame with 30s exposure). The frames were spherically averaged, scaled and merged using the in-line pipeline and the FIT2D program [48] followed by radiation damage and buffer subtraction analysis. Additionally, the Guinier approximation was used to estimate the radius of gyration (Rg) of protein molecules in the reciprocal space [49] and SAXS_MoW 2.0 web-tool was used to evaluate the molecular weight of the protein in solution [50,51]. The pair-distance distribution function of the particle P(r) and maximum dimension Dmax were evaluated using GNOM program through indirect Fourier transform of SAXS intensity [52]. The ab initio modeling of MtAAOx in the native and deglycosylated states were performed against SAXS data using the bead modeling program DAMMIF [53] implemented in the ATSAS package [54]. Ten individual models were generated and submitted to spatial alignment and averaged using DAMAVER [55]. The N-glycan moieties were modeled and added to MtAAOx structure using AllosMod [56]. All comparisons with experimental data were performed using FoXS [57]. Furthermore, the Kratky and Porod-Debye analyses were used to evaluate changes in the protein thermostability induced by binding of calcium. Briefly, for a compact and well-folded protein, the Kratky plot (q 2 I(q) vs. q) shows a well-defined baseline along high q-values [58,59] while for the Porod-Debye power-law (q 4 I(q) vs. q 4 ) the scattering intensity decays as q −4 reaching a clear plateau at high q [60]."
16,Crystallization and data collection,"2.15 Crystallization and data collection The MtAAOx enzyme concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 50 mM Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 6 and 150 mM NaCl was submitted to crystallization trials. Crystallization screens were set up using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method in 96-well plates with 1 μL protein solution plus 1 μL reservoir solution. The commercial screening kits Crystal Screen, Index HT, PEG II and PACT (Hampton Research; Molecular Dimensions) were used to search the initial crystallization condition. The crystallization plates were incubated at 18 °C and the conditions were monitored periodically using the Rock Imager 1000 (Formulatrix, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA). The best crystallization condition was refined using the hanging-drop set up. The crystals in P22121 space group were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.0; 15% (w/v) PEG6000; 0.2 M CaCl2. The MtAAOx crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% (v/v) ethyleneglycol before flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of cold nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected using Pilatus2M detector and synchrotron radiation with the wavelength of 1.4586 Å on W01B-MX2 beamline (Brazilian National Synchrotron Light Laboratory – LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). The diffraction data sets were processed and scaled using XDS [61] and AIMLESS [62], respectively."
17,Structure determination and refinement,"2.16 Structure determination and refinement MtAAOx structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser [63] using the tridimensional structure from P. erygii (PDBid: 3FIM) [23] as a search model. Automatic model building was performed using Autobuild on Phenix suite [64]. Model completion, co-factors addition and refinement were performed with Coot [65] and REFMAC5 [66]. Model quality was evaluated using Molprobity [67]. The atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code 6O9N. The validation of the calcium binding site was done with CheckMyMetal web server [68]. Comparison of cavities and structural accessibility were performed with CAVER 3.0 [69]. The structural figures were produced using PyMOL (Schrodinger LCC, http://www.pymol.org)."
18,Results,
19,Protein sequence analysis,"3.1 Protein sequence analysis In order to evaluate the number of putative fungal AA3 genes in T. thermophilus genome, we used the Homology to Peptide Patterns (Hotpep) tool [38] to mine for this CAZyme family. T. thermophilus revealed eleven putative AA3 family members (Table S1). The MtAAOx gene (MYCTH_2299749), non-classified a priori as AA3, shows eleven unique peptide patterns for this CAZy family and was identified and reported by secretome studies [25,26]. Protein sequence analysis of 52 biochemically characterized members of the AA3 family (http://www.cazy.org/AA3_characterized.html [20]) was performed to classify MtAAOx (Fig. 1 ). MtAAOx clustered with AA3_2 and AA3_3 subfamily that also includes alcohol oxidases, glucose oxidases, glucose dehydrogenases and pyranose dehydrogenases. Interestingly, MtAAOx together with the previous characterized U. maydis AAOx group with glucose active enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and dehydrogenase (GDH) (Fig. 1). MtAAOx shares 30/97%, 29/96% and 28/96% (sequence identity/coverage) with the biochemically characterized AAOx from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, Ustilago maydis and Pleurotus eryngii, respectively."
20,"Expression, purification and characterization of MtAAOx","3.2 Expression, purification and characterization of MtAAOx T. thermophilus AAOx was expressed and secreted heterologously in A. nidulans A773 as a highly soluble enzyme. Around 8.4 mg of MtAAOx per liter of culture media was obtained after three chromatographic steps. The identity of MtAAOx was confirmed by MALDI-ToF-MS analysis with 30% coverage (Fig. S1). Moreover, intact mass analysis using the same technique identified MtAAOx as a monomeric and unique glycoform with a molecular mass of 79.5 kDa suggesting 14% (w/w) glycosylation compared with the theoretical MW (68.3 kDa) (Fig. S2B). The glycosylation profile was also confirmed by the increased electrophoretic mobility of MtAAOx after deglycosylation with EndoH and mass spectrometry (Fig. S2). The far-UV spectrum of MtAAOx shows two absorbance maxima for FAD co-factor at 392 and 461 nm showing its oxidized state (Fig. S3A). The reduction of MtAAOx with veratryl alcohol substrate leads to the complete disappearance of the absorption peaks (Fig. S3B). Moreover, the UV absorption spectrum changed after enzyme denaturation, indicating that the FAD group dissociated and diffused in solution, and was not covalently linked to the protein structure (Fig. S3C). The absorbance at 450 nm was used to determine the concentration of the free FAD in solution. This measurement revealed a molar ratio FAD:MtAAOx of 0.69 showing a high flavin incorporation in the purified enzyme."
21,Biochemical characterization,"3.3 Biochemical characterization The oxidative activity of MtAAOx towards common substrates of AA3 members such glucose, cellobiose, veratryl alcohol and methanol were assayed using two different electron acceptors (O2 and DCPIP). The oxidative activity was just detected using the aromatic alcohol as substrate (Fig. S10). The optimum pH and temperature of MtAAOx were determined using veratryl alcohol as a substrate. MtAAOx has an optimum pH of 7.0 and a peak activity at 50 °C (Fig. 2A, B). MtAAOx substrate specificity was determined using a set of three different aromatic substrates and 5-HMF (Table 1 ). The catalytic activity was monitored by a spectrophotometer using a hydrogen peroxide production assay coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Interestingly, MtAAOx showed the same specificity towards cinnamyl alcohol, an aromatic substrate with a propene tail, and veratryl alcohol (Table 1). To better access the enzymatic activity, steady-state kinetic parameters for all substrates were obtained. From Table 1 it can be noticed that MtAAOx showed also the same catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for cinnamyl and veratryl alcohols (Table 1). Moreover, MtAAOx is active on 5-HMF, a component derived from hexoses, although with a lower conversion rate. 5-HMF was converted to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA) showing that MtAAOx acts preferentially on alcohol groups (Fig. S4). The influence of metals as well as other chemicals on the relative activity of MtAAOx is given in Table 2 . MtAAOx enzymatic activity is negatively affected by Cu2+ and Ba2+ and positively by other divalent ions such as Ca2+, Co2+ and Sr2+. The enzyme is stable in the presence of 1% SDS and 20% ethanol."
22,Effect of divalent ions on protein thermostability,"3.4 Effect of divalent ions on protein thermostability The structural stability of MtAAOx in the presence of divalent ions was initially evaluated using ThermoFluor assay and far-UV circular dichroism (CD). Protein denaturation curves were measured using the reporter dye SYPRO Orange and showed 15 °C increment in the transition midpoint temperature (Tm,app) from 60 to 75 °C (Fig. 3A, B) in the presence of Ca2+ ions. The effect of calcium binding on the thermostability of MtAAOx was monitored following the secondary structure using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3C, D). Analyses of the far-UV spectrum scans of MtAAOx in the absence of Ca2+ revealed that the secondary structure is heat stable to temperatures up to 50 °C (Fig. 3C). This heat stability was increased upon calcium binding following the CD signal at 222 nm which yielded an increment of 5 °C on the Tm,app of 64 °C. The effect of Ca2+ ions on protein thermostability was further analyzed and confirmed based on residual activity. MtAAOx bound to calcium maintained the enzymatic activity at 60 °C for 2 h compared with a half-life of ~10 min without calcium (Fig. 3E, F)."
23,SAXS,"3.5 SAXS Aiming to obtain structural insights into molecular shape of MtAAOx in solution as well as the effect of Ca2+ ion binding on thermostability of the enzyme, we applied Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) technique. MtAAOx was also measured in its native and deglycosylated forms to map orientations of the glycosylation moieties. Experimentally determined SAXS parameters are summarized in Table 3 . Primary analysis of the scattering curves and Guinier plots (Fig. 4A) indicates structural differences between glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of the enzyme. The P(r) distribution function showed a significantly longer Dmax for the native form of MtAAOx (108 Å) as compared with the deglycosylated form (85 Å) (Fig. 4B). Theoretical curve computed from the crystal structure was compared with the experimental scattering data using FoXS [57] and showed a relatively poor fit to the experimental data of native enzyme as judged by a χ2 of 2.52 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the crystal Rg of 23.98 Å is below the experimental value of 29.35 Å suggesting missing modeled structures corresponding to more ramified N-glycosylations. These flexible and disordered post-translational modifications which are commonly introduced by the heterologous host A. nidulans, are rarely modeled using X-ray crystallography due to a poor electron density. Structural alignment of the crystal structure and the ab initio envelope showed an extra unoccupied volume in FAD binding domain close to the N302 glycosylation position. The same volume was absent in the envelope corresponding to the deglycosylated form of the enzyme. To confirm this observation, the N-glycosylation at N302 was modeled in different possible conformations. The final ensemble filled the unoccupied volume which led to an improvement in the final fit of the X-ray scattering data (χ2 = 1.81) (Fig. 4C, D). These results suggest the presence of one major glycosylation site at N302 observed using low resolution SAXS data. MtAAOx SAXS data were also measured with and without an addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 ) to validate its effect on thermostability of the enzyme. The monomeric state and low-resolution shape of MtAAOx remained the same with two concentrations of Ca2+ (50 and 100 mM) (Fig. S5) and Rg values of 29.21–30.62 Å, according to Guinier analysis. Stabilization of protein structure by Ca2+ was evaluated from SAXS data using a temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 70 °C. The Kratky plots relative to MtAAOx with (Fig. S6, blue) and without Ca2+ (Fig. S6, green) show a local maximum corresponding to a well-folded protein (Fig. S6AB) between 20 and 50 °C. However, at the absence of Ca2+ this maximum is weaker in Kratky plot measured at 60 °C (Fig. S6C) and almost disappeared at 70 °C (Fig. S6D) accompanied by a concomitant increase in Rg values. This indicates that the protein electron density contrast becomes more diffuse, which is consistent with the enzyme denaturation. On the other hand, the maximum in the Kratky plot of MtAAOx bound to Ca2+ remained constant within the temperature range 20–60 °C used in the SAXS measurements. Additionally, the Porod-Debye plots are also consistent with the observations (Figs. S6EF) obtained from our analyses of the Kratky plots. MtAAOx with and without Ca2+ showed a clear plateau at 20 °C (Fig. S6E), whereas at 50 °C the Porod-Debye plot for the protein without Ca2+ slowly increased at relatively wide angles correspondent to q 4 > 1.17 × 10−5 (Fig. S6F) and become more evident at q 4 > 3.96 × 10−5. In line with the Kratky and Porod-Debye analyses, the obtained T m derived from SAXS data for MtAAOx with and without Ca2+ was 64.5 °C and 60.6 °C (Fig. 5), respectively. These results suggest that Ca2+ binding to MtAAOx imprints conformational changes in its molecular structure that lead to enhanced thermostability of the enzyme."
24,Crystallographic structure,"3.6 Crystallographic structure MtAAOx crystals have been obtained only in crystallization conditions which included divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Interestingly, usable X-ray diffraction data sets were obtained only from crystals grown on the condition in which Ca2+ was present, showing its impact on the structural stabilization and resulting in well-shaped yellow crystals (Fig. S7). The crystal structure of MtAAOx was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of AAOx from P. eryngii (PDBid: 3FIM, 28% sequence identity) [23] as a template and refined to 2.6 Å resolution with final R work /Rfree values of 20.3/25.2, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4 . The structure was solved in the space group P22121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Both molecules are similar with 0.095 Å Cα RMSD for residues 32–644. MtAAOx structure has a RMSD of 2.5 Å (computed for all residues) when compared to the PeAAOx (PDBid: 3FIM) [23], the only other AAOx crystal structure solved to date, suggesting a considerable structural diversity of AA3_2 family. MtAAOx is composed by two domains: FAD and substrate binding domains with two disulfide bridges stabilizing an elongated structure (Fig. 6A). Out of six putative N-glycosylation spots predicted using NetNGlyc tool [72], four (N107, N302, N380 and N504) were confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The FAD domain is highly conserved in the structures of GMC oxidoreductases and presents the canonical βαβ motif involved in binding to ADP moiety of FAD. This domain includes a consensus G-X-G-X-X-G-(X)18-E fingerprint sequence near the N-terminus and found in the core of FAD domain (Figs. 6A and S8). The prosthetic group FAD is noncovalently bound to MtAAOx in an extended conformation and parallel to the major axis (Fig. 6B). The FAD group interacts with MtAAOx through hydrogen bonds with main-chain of Ser46, Tyr68, Val117, Gly126, Phe128, Val274 and Met612, side chain of Glu67 and Asn125, and main chain and side chain of Thr45, Ser121 and Ser624 (Fig. 6B). The adenine moiety is found buried in the protein structure whereas the isoalloxazine ring is exposed to solvent environment with a water molecule interacting with the N5 atom (Fig. 6B). This interaction is also conserved in the crystal structure of PeAAOx [23]. On the other hand, the substrate binding domain is composed by one β-sheet (5 anti-parallel strands) flanked by a long α-helix (522–540), paving the catalytic site from the isoalloxazine ring until entrance (Fig. 6A). The base of this domain is surrounded by short α-helices. The FAD group and the substrate binding domains are connected by four structural elements: three extended segments (67–95, 347–358 and 492–504) and a long-structured segment (93–120) composed by two anti-parallel strands that forms the top of the tunnel entrance (Fig. 6A). Comparative analysis of the overall structures of MtAAOx and PeAAOx revealed an extra segment (421–467) composed by two longer α-helices from substrate binding domain touching laterally the FAD domain (Fig. 7A). This structural element is absent in PeAAOx (volume = 85,160 Å3) and confers larger dimensions for MtAAOx (volume = 90,410 Å3). These molecular volumes were calculated based on the theoretical scattering curve expected for the protein without glycosylations (Fig. 7A). This molecular volume is also corroborated by the Porod volume of 93,000 Å3 determined experimentally for the deglycosylated MtAAOx in solution using SAXS. Moreover, comparative analysis of the MtAAOx and PeAAOx catalytic site openings showed differences in FAD accessibility (Fig. 7B). The catalytic site of MtAAOx is completely solvent accessible and the hydrophobic cavity highlights the conserved His579 and His622 reported as central residues for AAOx catalysis [16] (Figs. 7 and S8). Inspection of MtAAOx crystal structure also reveals a unique Ca2+ binding pocket located near the catalytic site entrance (Fig. 8A). This structural feature has not been reported previously for AA3_2 enzymes. Ca2+ divalent ion is coordinated by the side chain carboxyl of Asp79, and the backbone carbonyl of Thr77, Phe78, Tyr400 and Leu402 in both monomers (Fig. 8B). These residues are not conserved in other characterized members of AA3_2 family (Fig. S8). The binding site adopts an octahedral geometry with an average coordinating distance of 2.4 Å (Fig. 8B). The unstructured element 67–115, found to connect the FAD and the substrate binding domains, provides a site for Ca2+ binding and is stabilized by it (Fig. 8A). This interaction leads to a local mean B factor of 27 Å2, lower than the overall protein B factor of 28.68 Å2 (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, this region is structured and shorten in PeAAOx leaving no room for a Ca2+ binding site in addition to a strict group conservation of Asp79/Glu45 (Fig. S9). Moreover, the stabilization of the calcium binding region was essential for the crystallization process and can be observed in the inter-dimer interactions between the symmetry-related mates (Fig. 8D)."
25,Discussion,"Aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAOx) are attractive targets for lignocellulose degradation and organic chemistry studies [73]. This member of AA3_2 subfamily catalyzes the oxidation of polyunsaturated alcohols to its correspondent aldehyde, with the parallel production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This by-product has been suggested to feed extracellular peroxidases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in ligninolytic fungi [74]. Only few AAOx have been characterized [40,75–78], among them the well-studied AAOx from Pleurotus eryngii being the only one with crystallographic structure determined so far for AA3_2 family. In this study, a new extracellular AAOx from the thermophilic fungus T. thermophilus was heterologously expressed, purified and biochemically characterized. We also determined the 3D structure of MtAAOx using X-ray crystallography and retrieved the enzyme envelope from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. MtAAOx is the only extracellular AA3_2 enzyme, among four annotated in the genome, which was identified in the secretome of T. thermophilus grown on alfalfa, barley straw and cellulosic substrates [25,26]. MtAAOx has better activity at neutral conditions with optimum pH 7.0 as opposed to the optimum pH 6.0 previously reported for AAOx from Pleurotus eryngii [75,79], Pleurotus pulmonarius [37] and Ustilago maydis [40]. MtAAOx also has the highest thermostability, maintaining enzymatic activity after up to 2 h of incubation at 50 °C. In order to characterize the substrate specificity of this new AAOx, three aromatic alcohol substrates were tested, including 5-HMF. The KM values were compared with AAOx from B. adusta [77], P. eryngii [75], P. cinnabarinus [76] and U. maydis [40]. Value for cinnamyl alcohol was just slightly lower as compared with P. eryngii (708 μM) and higher than B. adusta (73 μM), U. maydis (35 μM) and P. cinnabarinus (275 μM). On the other hand, KM obtained for veratryl alcohol was close to that of P. eryngii AAOx (540 μM) but was higher than that of U. maydis (120 μM). Interestingly, the absence of the propene group substituent found in cinnamyl alcohol did not lead to changes of catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of the enzyme when compared with veratryl alcohol. This suggests that the propene tail did not introduce steric constraints and was stabilized in the catalytic tunnel. In order to obtain structural insights into the enzyme mechanism, we compared available crystal structures of T. thermophilus and P. eryngii AAOx. Structural comparison revealed that the FAD domain is strongly conserved between MtAAOx and PeAAOx. However, the substrate binding domain structure as well as active-site accessibility were significantly different, with MtAAOx having a wider substrate access tunnel connecting the active-site cavity to the solvent. This explains similar enzymatic activity of MtAAOx for small and bulky substrates such as veratryl and cinnamyl alcohols. These differences in substrate accessibility to the active site could explain why PeAAOx shows higher catalytic efficiency against veratryl alcohol (210 s−1. mM−1) as compared with cinnamyl alcohol (78 s−1. mM−1) [75]. The access to the inner cavity close to FAD co-factor is proposed to be regulated by three aromatic residues in PeAAOx: Tyr92, Phe397 and Phe501 [6,35,80], none of them conserved in the crystal structure of MtAAOx. Moreover, the PeAAOx narrow tunnel has been proposed to be important to conduct O2 molecule to the active site [6]. The low O2 reactivity of MtAAOx with a turnover rate 202-fold lower than PeAAOx [7] might be also attributed to the fully accessible catalytic tunnel and the substitution of Phe501 in PeAAOx by Met578 in MtAAOx. This result is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis of Phe501Ala reported to strongly reduce O2 reactivity in PeAAOx [6]. MtAAOx was also shown to oxidize 5-HMF, a toxic product for fermentation process and derived from thermal-chemical treatment of biomass [81]. This activity was previously reported for AAOx from P. eryngii [21] and P. ostreatus [82]. The detected products of MtAAOx 5-HMF oxidation were 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA) revealing that MtAAOx follows the same oxidation pathway as PeAAOx does. PeAAOx oxidizes 5-HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) via 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and its alternative precursor 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) [21]. However, no FDCA was detected for MtAAOx. This partial oxidation of 5-HMF was also described for PeAAOx and related to the inhibitory effect of the produced H2O2 [83]. Curiously, an alternative pathway is followed by PoAAOx that also produces FDCA but via 2,5-hydroxymethylfuran carboxylic acid (HMFCA) [82]. As observed with other substrates, MtAAOx has 10-fold lower catalytic efficiency against 5-HMF (0.02 s−1. mM−1) as compared with PeAAOx (0.21 s−1. mM−1) [21]. Taken together, crystal structure and SAXS data of MtAAOx, revealed a highly glycosylated protein. The post-translational modifications account for approximately 14% of total mass and are mostly concentrated in the FAD binding domain. This structural feature could be also responsible for enzyme thermal stabilization and could be related to overexpression profile of A. nidulans as an expression host. For comparison, PeAAOx expressed in E.coli and submitted to in vitro refolding demonstrated smaller optimum pH activity and thermostability [36]. Moreover, the expression of PeAAOx in S. cerevisae confirmed that thermostability and kinetic parameters are affected by different degrees of glycosylation [84]. Another factor related to MtAAOx thermostability was a calcium-binding pocket revealed by the crystal structure. The Ca2+ ion was found near the catalytic site entrance, stabilizing the extended segments (amino acid residues 67–95) and positively influencing the crystallization process. Ca+2 binding resulted in a drastic increase in thermostability by as much as 15 °C in transition midpoint temperature. We demonstrated that MtAAOx shows unique structural and biochemical features among AA3_2 enzymes so far described. Three features of the enzyme structure, a fully accessible catalytic tunnel, heavy glycosylation and Ca2+ binding site, are responsible for its thermostability. MtAAOx structure also sheds light on its substrate specificity. This biochemical and structural information might be useful for designing of more thermostable enzymes."
