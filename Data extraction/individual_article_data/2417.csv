0,Introduction,"Since the discovery of photoelectrochemistry water splitting by using rutile TiO2 anode coupled with a dark cathode [1], development of new and efficient photocatalysts to convert solar energy into chemical fuels, such as hydrogen generation from water [2] and reduction of carbon dioxide [3], has become a rapid expanding research area [4–6]. It is well known, besides the width of band gap and the levels of the conduction and valence bands, the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs could also limit the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor materials for watering splitting. As reported in Ref. [7], the internal field formed between an n-type and a p-type semiconductors could be used to accelerate the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers, thus, improving the photocatalytic activity accordingly. Recently, various highly efficient n-type semiconductor photoanodes have been reported [8,9], whereas p-type metal-oxide semiconductors, such as Cu2O, Ag2O, Co3O4, CuAlO2, CuNbO3 and CuNb3O8 [10–17], are relatively less explored. To date, the layered metal-oxide semiconductors, for example, Sr2Ta2O7, H/KCa2Nb3O10, K4Nb6O17, Rb4Nb6O17, and KNb3O8 [18–21], have shown promising photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production, but only with ultraviolet activity. However, most notably layered oxides are interesting semiconductors due to their interlayer reaction. For example, ion-exchange reactions can be used to deposit noble metal co-catalysts at specific interlayer sites [22,23]. As stated above, a layered KNb3O8 and a p-type CuNb3O8 with a narrow band gap (~1.26eV) were chosen to expect to achieve an improved photocatalyst performance under visible light. Hence, we firstly reported a rod-like heterojunction with composition of the H3ONb3O8 and CuNb3O8 semiconductors as well as its photocatalytic activities under visible light. Furthermore, an energy band structure model was proposed to explain for the improved hydrogen production process."
1,Experimental,"A representative experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 1. Rod-like KNb3O8 was prepared by using a molten salt method [24–26] with stoichiometric K2CO3 and Nb2O5, together with KCl as molten salt. 0.1g rod-like KNb3O8 powder was mixed with 2.5g CuCl (melting point of 430°C) in alcohol till the alcohol evaporated completely. The mixture was then heated at 450°C for 3h in N2 environment. Followed that the resulting powder was washed several times with 3M NH3·H2O and HCl aqueous solution in order to remove the copper chloride/oxide (including a centrifugal sedimentation separation process). Finally, the precipitation was washed by DI water until neutralised and then dried at 80°C, thus, the final HN–CN powders were obtained. In addition to, as a comparison, the H3ONb3O8 was obtained via ion-exchange reaction of 0.1g KNb3O8 and 50ml HCl aqueous under stirring for 24h, and the CuNb3O8 was prepared via a solid state reaction method with stoichiometric Nb2O5 and Cu2O mixtures under 750°C in the N2 environment."
2,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns of the KNb3O8 powders prepared by using the molten salt method and the HN–CN powders are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that single phase KNb3O8 has been obtained, because all the diffraction peaks can be indexed according to PDF #75-2182. Interestingly, after annealing at a lower temperature (450°C), a new phase of CuNb3O8 is produced due to the K+–Cu+ ion-exchange reaction, since the diffraction peaks can be indexed and are consistent with PDF #71-1927. However, the original KNb3O8 disappears, while a new phase, which can be indexed as H3ONb3O8 [PDF #44-0672], is detected in the final compound. This phenomenon is due to another ion exchange reaction (H3O+–K+) in the last step of the photocatalyst preparation (the washing process as shown in Fig. 1) [27]. Such a reversible ion exchange reaction can be expressed as follows: (1) KNb 3 O 8 ⇆ K aq + H aq + H 3 ONb 3 O 8 Furthermore, an obvious shift of the peak (020) to low angle has resulted from the difference in ionic radius, that is, H3O+ in size is larger than K+, and a new phase H3ONb3O8 is thus obtained due to ion-exchange reaction. Tauc plots of the UV−vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the H3ONb3O8, KNb3O8 and HN–CN powders are shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting information). It can be seen that the HN–CN powder has two absorption edges, which can be attributed to the two-phase composition, and the absorption edge positions are 1.55 and 3.58eV, which correspond to those of CuNb3O8 and H3ONb3O8 respectively [15,28]. Pure KNb3O8 and H3ONb3O8 have a similar band gap [28] as shown in Fig. S1(a). In addition, the XRD pattern of the CuNb3O8 powders and the band gaps of Tauc plots are shown in Fig. S2, which are consistent with those as reported in Ref. [15]. Fig. 3 shows SEM and (HR) TEM images of the rod-like KNb3O8 and HN–CN powders. As observed in Fig. 3(a), the KNb3O8 powder prepared using the melting salt method consists of the crystal with fine rod-like morphology. Most of the rod-like crystals have a width of ~500nm and a length of >3μm. Moreover, the layered morphology of KNb3O8 can be clearly observed in the cross-view TEM image as shown in Fig. 3(b), and shows a layer thickness of about 50nm. More importantly, the HN–CN sample has same layered rod-like structure as the KNb3O8, as observed in the top-view TEM image of Fig. 3(c). It can be seen from the HRTEM image as shown in Fig. 3(d) that the (060) and (020) crystal planes of the H3ONb3O8 have a d-spacing of 3.74Å and 11.22Å, respectively, while the (410) crystal plane of the CuNb3O8 has a d-spacing of 2.97Å. Hence, the H3ONb3O8 crystal is in contact with the CuNb3O8 crystal, indicating the formation of a heterojunction structure between H3ONb3O8 and CuNb3O8. The crystal structure of KNb3O8 is orthorhombic with space group Amam (no. 63) and cell formula units Z=4, which means that there are 4 K (=4×1/2+2×1), 12 Nb (=12×1/2+6×1) and 32 O atoms in a primitive cell. However, the crystal structure of CuNb3O8 is monoclinic with space group P21/a (no. 14) and cell formula units Z=4 (same as that of KNb3O8), which includes 4 Cu (=4×1), 12 Nb (=12×1) and 32 O atoms in a primitive cell (31994-ICSD and 14099-ICSD, respectively). A transition of the crystal structure from orthogonal to monoclinic is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that two steps are involved in the formation of the new phase, CuNb3O8: (1) K+–Cu+ ion-exchange process and (2) orthogonal to monoclinic (O–M) transition in the crystal structure. On one hand, due to the ion exchange effect, all K+ ions are substituted by Cu+ ions, thus orthogonal CuNb3O8 is formed. On the other hand, because the radius of Cu+ ion (0.077nm) is smaller than that of K+ ion (0.138nm), Cu+ ions of (200) plane experience displacement in such a way that half of the Cu+ ions are above the original plane, while the other half of Cu+ ions are below the original plane. Therefore, a new equilibrium position is achieved. Crystallographic parameters, a, b, c and β, which are involved in the O–M crystal structure transition, are listed in Table S1. In addition, Nb ions also undergo displacement accordingly, i.e., 6 Nb ions shift from face to interior of the cell. Furthermore, the displacement magnitudes of Cu and Nb ions are shown in Fig. S3. Photocatalytic activities of the H3ONb3O8, HN–CN and CuNb3O8 samples for hydrogen production under visible light are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the H3ONb3O8 exhibits no photocatalytic effect under visible light, because its light absorption is in the ultraviolet region. Due to the overpotential for hydrogen formation, the HN–CN sample without loading Pt also has no hydrogen production. However, the HN–CN sample loaded with 1wt% Pt shows an obviously improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production as compared with the CuNb3O8 loaded with 1wt% Pt sample under visible light. This improvement in performance could be attributed to the formation of the p–n junction [7], which promotes the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from p-type semiconductor (CuNb3O8) to n-type semiconductor (H3ONb3O8) under the action of the electric field as shown schematically in Fig. 5. In other words, the improved photocatalytic activities can be attributed to the effective separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. It is necessary to mention here that there are various factors, such as the relative amount of KNb3O8 and CuCl, the annealing temperature and time, as well as the use of other special morphological KNb3O8, for improving the photocatalytic activities of such heterostructured photocatalysts."
3,Conclusions,"A p-type semiconductor CuNb3O8 has been successfully obtained from the KNb3O8 rod-like particles through the ion-exchanging process, and a possible formation mechanism of the CuNb3O8 phase has been also proposed, which is the transition of the crystal structure from orthogonal to monoclinic (O–M) due to ion-exchange. Results indicate that the as-prepared rod-like HN–CN heterostructure photocatalyst exhibits an improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production as compared with pure CuNb3O8 photocatalyst, which can be attributed to the formation of the p–n heterostructure. It is believed that the preparation technique may provide a new way to the preparation of the p–n heterostructure for efficient hydrogen production under visible light."
