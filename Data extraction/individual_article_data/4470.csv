0,Introduction,"Semiconductor-based photocatalysis is considered to be an attractive strategy in solving the current worldwide energy crisis and the serious environmental problems since it can utilize the abundant and ubiquitous solar light for production of hydrogen from water [1–6], degradation of organic pollutants, reductions of CO2 to organic fuels and organics transformations [7–14]. To make an efficient absorption of the solar light, it is ideal that the semiconductor-based photocatalyst should possess a narrow band gap. However, to be thermodynamically beneficial for the redox reactions between the reactants and the photogenerated electrons and holes, it is preferred that the semiconductor should have a more negative conduction potential and a more positive valence potential, which should broaden the band gap of a semiconductor-based photocatalyst and results in its poor absorption toward solar energy. These two requirements on the semiconductor photocatalysts for efficient photocatalysis are mutually exclusive and for some applications, are difficult to be compromised over single-component semiconductor-based photocatalyst [15–19]. An efficient strategy for the development of semiconductor-based photocatalysts which simultaneously possess wide light-absorption range as well as strong redox ability is to mimic that in the natural photosynthesis to design artificial Z-Scheme photocatalytic systems, which are comprised of two semiconductor-based photocatalysts with or without the electron mediator [20]. IO3 −/I−, Fe3+/Fe2+ and several other acceptor/donor (A/D) pairs as well as some solid conductors including noble metal nanoparticles (Pt, Au) and RGO [21–25], have all been used as the electron mediator to construct the artificial Z-Scheme photocatalytic systems, which have been used in a variety of photocatalytic applications. Among all the electron mediators that have been investigated, RGO is extremely appealing due to its high electrical conductivity, stability and tunable surface properties [26,27]. In particular, the rich surface functionalities in RGO enables it to optimize the contact interface with the semiconductor-based photocatalysts for a facile transfer of the photogenerated electrons from one semiconductor to combine with the photogenerated holes in another semiconductor via the RGO as the mediator, which is essential to realize an efficient photocatalysis [28]. In this manuscript, Cu2O and BiVO4 were chosen to construct a Z-Scheme photocatalytic system using RGO as an electron mediator. Cu2O is a narrow band gap semiconductor (ca. 2.0–2.2 eV) well responsive in the visible light region. Since the bottom of its conduction band is more negative than those required for CO2 and proton reduction, photocatalytic CO2 reduction to form hydrocarbon fuels and hydrogen evolution can occur over Cu2O. However, the photo-generated holes in Cu2O cannot oxidize water to produce oxygen [27,29]. Although BiVO4 is also a visible light responsive semiconductor based photocatalyst, unlike that in Cu2O, the photocatalytic reduction of the protons and CO2 is not thermodynamically favorable over BiVO4 even though it has a strong oxidation capability due to its more positive valence band potential [30,31]. The Z-Scheme Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite was obtained via a thermal treatment of Cu precursor in the presence of the pre-obtained RGO/BiVO4. As compared with bare Cu2O and RGO/BiVO4, the as-prepared Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for simultaneous CO2 reduction and benzyl alcohol oxidation under visible light irradiation, ascribed to the presence of the Z-Scheme charge transfer pathway in the nanocomposite."
1,Results and discussion,"RGO/BiVO4 was obtained via a facile solvothermal method from Bi(NO3)3 and NH4VO3 in the presence of GO. It is well known that the surface of GO possess lots of hydrophilic functional groups (e.g. OH, COOH), which can act as the anchoring sits for Bi3+. These surface adsorbed Bi3+ can react with VO3 − to form BiVO4 nucleus, while in the meantime GO is reduced to RGO in the presence of the organic solvents [32]. The as-obtained product shows 2θ peaks at 18.9°, 28.9°, 30.5°, 34.4°, 35.2°, 39.7°, 42.4°, 45.8°, 47.3°, 50.3°, and 53.4°, which corresponds to the diffraction from (011), (121), (040), (200), (002), (211), (051), (132), (042), (202) and (200) crystallographic planes of monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS 14-0688) (Fig. 1a). Probably due to its low content and relatively low weight diffraction intensity, no diffractions peaks corresponding to either GO or RGO is observed on the XRD patterns of the as-obtained product [33]. However, the existence of RGO in the as-obtained RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite can be confirmed by the TEM and HRTEM images in Figs. S1 and S2. The TEM image of RGO-BiVO4 shows olive-shaped BiVO4 with length of 1.0–1.2 μm and width of 0.6–0.8 μm distributed on RGO nanosheets (Fig. S1). Lattice fringe of 0.31 nm can be assigned to the (121) crystallographic plane of monoclinic BiVO4 (Fig. S2). As shown in Scheme 1 , the as-obtained RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite was used in the synthesis of ternary Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite using Cu(CH3OO)2·H2O as the precursor for Cu2O. To form ternary Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite, Cu2+ was first adsorb on the surface of RGO in the as-prepared RGO/BiVO4 owing to the existence of electrostatic interactions between Cu2+ and the negative RGO [34]. In alkaline condition, Cu(OH)2 is spontaneously formed through the reaction between the surface adsorbed Cu2+ ions and OH− ions on the surface of RGO/BiVO4. During the hydrothermal process, Cu(OH)2 nuclei were reduced to Cu2O, which grow to form Cu2O nanoparticles on the surface of RGO/BiVO4 [35]. The existence of plenty of anchoring sites on RGO ensures Cu2O to be well distributed on RGO surface and have strong interaction with RGO/BiVO4 [36]. In addition to the diffraction peaks assignable to monoclinic BiVO4, the XRD of the ternary product also shows 2θ peaks at 36.6° and 42.5°, which can be attributed to (111) and (200) crystallographic planes of cubic Cu2O (JPPDS NO. 78-2076), indicating that cubic Cu2O had been obtained by a thermal treatment of Cu(CH3OO)2 in the presence of RGO/BiVO4 (Fig. 1b). The Raman spectrum of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 shows characteristic peaks at 1353 cm−1 and 1602 cm−1, corresponding to D and G bands of RGO respectively (Supporting Fig. S3). The ratio of ID/IG over the Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 is determined to be ca.0.88, a little higher than that observed over the original GO (0.81), indicating a successful reduction of GO to RGO and its incorporation in the nanocomposite since the ratio of ID/IG is an indicator of the graphitization degree of carbonaceous materials. The TEM image shows that, in addition to the olive-shaped BiVO4, small nanoparticles of Cu2O with a dimension of 40–50 nm are also observed on the surface of RGO (Fig. 2a). Lattice-fringe of 0.26 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) crystallographic plane of cubic Cu2O, is also observed on the HRTEM image of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 (Fig. 2b). To study the surface chemical composition and electronic state of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4, XPS analyses were carried out. The XPS spectrum of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 in Cu 2p region shows peaks at 952.1 eV and 932.4 eV, attributable to Cu(I) in Cu2O according to the reported binding energy of Cu2O (Fig. 3a) [37]. The XPS spectrum in C 1s region shows three peaks at 284.8, 285.6 and 288.5 eV, which can be attributed to sp2-hybridized carbon (CC), epoxy/hydroxyl carbon (CO) and carboxyl (CO) respectively (Fig. 3b). As compared with the original GO, the intensity of the peak at 285.6 eV (CO) and 288.5 eV (CO) in the Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite decreases dramatically (Fig. S4a), indicating that GO has been reduced to form RGO [38]. The XPS spectra show peaks at 159.5 eV and 164.6 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f, as well as peaks at 516.9 eV and 524.1 eV, attributable to V 2p (Fig. 3c–d). As compared with those of bare Cu2O (Fig. S4b) and BiVO4 (Fig. 3c–d), the peaks of Cu 2p, Bi 4f and V 2p in Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite shift, indicating the existence of strong electronic interaction between the components in Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 [35]. The BET specific surface area of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 was determined to be 12.50 m2/g (Supporting Fig. S5). Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite shows a strong and wide absorption between 200 nm and 540 nm (Fig. 4 ). Due to the existence of RGO, the light absorption of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite in the region of 520 nm to 800 nm is slightly enhanced. Such an enhancement in light absorption can make full utilization of solar light and is believed to be beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction [39]. To inhibit the oxidation of Cu+ by the photo-generated holes and complete a whole photocatalytic cycle over Cu2O, photocatalytic CO2 reduction over Cu2O was carried out in the presence of benzyl alcohol (Fig. 5 ). However, as already reported in our previous studies, bare Cu2O showed low activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction even in the presence of benzyl alcohol [37]. Actually in our system, only 0.05 μmol of HCOOH as well as 0.06 μmol of hydrogen was obtained after irradiated for 24 h (Fig. 5a and b), together with 0.13 μmol of benzaldehyde (Fig. 5c). On the contrary, the ternary Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite showed a much higher yield to HCOOH (0.65 μmol) and hydrogen (0.73 μmol), in addition to 2.16 μmol of benzaldehyde. Although 1.52 μmol of benzaldehyde was detected over RGO/BiVO4, almost no HCOOH and hydrogen was detected over RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposites after irradiation for 24 h under visible light (Fig. 5d). This result is reasonable if we consider that BiVO4 has its conduction potential located at 0.05 V vs. NHE, which is not negative enough to reduce CO2 or H+ to produce HCOOH and hydrogen. Therefore, the obviously improved performance observed over Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite as compared with RGO/BiVO4 and bare Cu2O should be ascribed to the existence of the Z-Scheme charge transfer pathway between Cu2O and BiVO4 via RGO as an electron mediator (Scheme 2 ). Since Cu2O and BiVO4 have band gap of ca. 2.0 eV and 2.4 eV respectively, both of them can be excited to generate electron-hole pairs under visible-light irradiations [36]. Based on the Mott−Schottky plots (Supporting Fig. S6), the conduction band and the valence band of BiVO4 can be estimated to be 0.05 V and 2.45 V vs. NHE, while the conduction band and the valence band of Cu2O can be calculated to be −0.39 V and 1.61 V vs. NHE. The energy band schematic diagram of BiVO4 and Cu2O is shown in Scheme 2. When Cu2O and BiVO4 is contacted, the photo-generated electrons on the conduction band of BiVO4 can migrate through RGO to the photo-generated holes of Cu2O. Since RGO is a material with good electrical conductivity, the incorporation of RGO can promote the charge transfer in the system, which is beneficial for the photocatalysis [40]. The photo-generated electrons on Cu2O are used to reduce CO2 and protons to generate formate and hydrogen, while the photo-generated holes left on BiVO4 are used for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In this way, the reduction of CO2 and proton and benzyl alcohol oxidation can be achieved simultaneously under visible light [41]. The existence of the Z-Scheme charge transfer pathway in Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 can also be confirmed from the DMPO-trapped ESR spectra (Fig. 6 ). Since the bottom of the conduction band of BiVO4 locates at 0.05 V vs. NHE, less negative than E(O2/O2 −) (located at −0.33 V vs. NHE), the generation of O2 − over irradiated BiVO4 is not possible. In the meantime, the valence band of Cu2O locates at 1.61 V vs. NHE, which is less positive than E(HO−/OH) (2.38 V vs. NHE). Therefore, it is not possible to generate OH over Cu2O. However, when irradiated, four characteristic peaks of DMPO-OH can be obviously observed in the suspension of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4, while peaks for DMPO-O2 − species can also be observed in a methanolic dispersion of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4. The evidence that both DMPO-OH and DMPO-O2 − are produced on Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 provides a solid indication that Z-Scheme charge transfer pathway exists in the Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4. In addition, the photocorrosion of Cu2O can also be inhibited. The as-obtained Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 was stable in the photocatalytic reaction. No obvious decrease in the amount of the produced products was observed (Supporting Fig. S7). In addition, the XRD of the used catalyst is similar to that of the fresh one (Supporting Fig. S8)."
2,Conclusions,"In summary, olive-shaped RGO/BiVO4 obtained solvothermally was used for assembly of Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite, which acts as a Z-Scheme photocatalytic system for simultaneous reduction of CO2 and benzyl alcohol oxidation. Due to the presence of the Z-Scheme charge transfer pathway, the as-obtained Cu2O-RGO/BiVO4 nanocomposite shows obviously enhanced photocatalytic performance as compared with bare Cu2O and RGO/BiVO4 under visible-light irradiation. The existence of the strong interaction between Cu2O and BiVO4 facilitates the electron transfer from BiVO4 to Cu2O, with RGO acting as a good electron mediator. The study provides an effective method in the fabrication of the Z-Scheme nanocomposite to improve photocatalytic performance, which can also extend to other photocatalytic applications. This study also provides some guidance for the development of Z-Scheme photocatalytic systems."
