0,Introduction,"The need for fresh water has been increasing up to seven times with the fast growing world’s population [1]. The estimates of World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that 1100 million people are facing water shortage globally [2]. Climate change and lack of adequate infrastructure are the two major causes of water scarcity. Accordingly, millions of humans die annually due to unhealthy drinking water [3–5]. At present, the biggest challenge of developing countries is to provide healthy, clean and sustainable drinking water to their citizens. The highest consumption of water takes place in manufacturing sector especially in paper and pulp industry, which require fresh water in every stage of processes [6]. Water is mainly used for transporting chemicals and fibers in production process of paper. The conservation of water can be achieved by using wastewater recycle technique in water management of paper mills. Membrane separation is the most widely used low-cost, energy-saving and highly efficient technology for wastewater treatment. Due to these features, membrane technology is playing a prominent role in the treatment of wastewater, brackish and seawater, chemical and dairy industry [7–10]. The fouling of accumulated undesirable pollutants on membrane pores is the main obstacle in its operation, and almost half of the cost consumes in fouling control or prevention [11]. A membrane is a physical barrier used for separation of desirable solutes and unwanted solvents [12]. Separation membranes are majorly divided into two categories: polymer and inorganic membranes. Polymeric membranes were widely used due to their high selectivity, mechanical strength, chemical resistance, low cost and flexibility but there are some problems associated such as fouling. To resolve these issues, researchers are more focused on nanocomposite membranes since last ten years. In nanocomposite membranes, inorganic nanofiller was incorporated into polymer membranes for enhancing separation features of pure polymer membranes [13–15]. Nanoparticles as organic fillers in composite membranes enhance antifouling potential, permeability, selectivity, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, antimicrobial features and thermal stability in polymeric membranes due to high aspect ratio [16,17]. Polyvinyl alcohol is one of the most used polymers for membranes fabrication. It is a semi-crystalline polymer having high hydrophilicity, completely hydrolyzed [18], chemical, thermal and environmental stability and mechanical strength. It is highly soluble in water and insoluble in organic solvents [19]. The widely used areas of polyvinyl alcohol are membrane separation technology, photoluminescence and fuel cell electrolytes [20–22]. The crystal structure depends on the hydrogen bonding between molecules [23]. It is used in synthesis of polymer membranes for application in pressure-driven processes like microfiltration [24,25], ultrafiltration [26–32], nanofiltration, reverse osmosis as well as gas separation [32–34] and pervaporation [35]. The chemical structure of PVA in hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed form shown in Fig. 1 . The nanoparticles are being used for enhancing separation efficiency and properties as well as improving its life time. It has been reported that various nanoparticles incorporated in polymer membranes for mitigating fouling such as TiO2 [36–38]. TiO2 nanofiller has gained much attention due high UV-resistance, chemical stability, photocatalytic action, antimicrobial properties and transparency [39–41]. On the other hand, the biggest challenge is the formation of aggregates of inorganic nanofillers [42,43]. Polydopamine (PDA) is an environment-friendly neurotransmitter hormone having strong adhesiveness and absorbability. Its coating increase antimicrobial potential [44] and separation efficiency of membranes. A considerable amount of research has already been done on coating of nanoparticles. A biomimetic coating of polydopamine was done by alkaline dopamine solution for incorporation into thin films. The resulting films showed photocurrents and photodegradation [45]. An investigation was also done on solar photocatalytic oxidation of paper mill wastewater by titanium dioxide. This study concluded that photocatalytic degradation can be used as an effective pretreatment process in biological post-treating of paper industry pollutants [46]. In order to overcome the challenges of paper mill wastewater, our objective was to fabricate highly efficient novel dopamine coated polyvinyl alcohol nanofiltration membranes for improving antifouling ability and solving environmental issues associated with paper and pulp industry. As per our knowledge, dopamine coated titanium dioxide core shell nanoparticles have not been incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol membranes for application in paper and pulp mills wastewater treatment. The effect of coated TiO2 nanoparticles on the mechanical properties, surface morphology, crystal structure, fouling resistance, physicochemical features and thermal stability of membranes was analyzed. The synthesized PVA nanocomposite membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis(TGA), Tensile testing, Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD). The pollutants removal efficiency was examined using wastewater of Security Papers Limited, Pakistan in filtration experiments. The manufactured paper used in educational boards and universities degree certificates, banknotes, prize bonds, saving certificates, financial instruments and other applications."
1,Experminetal,
2,Materials and reagents,"2.1 Materials and reagents Polyvinyl alcohol (lab grade resin, MW = 85000−124000 g/mol, 99 % hydrolyzed), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and dopamine monomer were purchased from Siga-Aldrich (USA). Anatase titanium (IV) oxide(98 %) from Daejung Chemicals and Metals Co., Ltd. (South Korea). Deionized (DI) water was used directly in experiments without any further purification."
3,Membrane synthesis,"2.2 Membrane synthesis The nanocomposite Polyvinyl alcohol membrane was prepared by solution casting method. PVA aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 15 wt % PVA in 100 mL of water at 85ᴼC using magnetic stirrer until a clear, transparent and homogeneous solution formed. PVA/TiO2 solution was obtained by mixing 15 wt % PVA and 5 wt % TiO2 in water by the same procedure, as stated previously. PVA/TiO2/Dopamine solution was made by first dissolving 1 g dopamine methacrylate in 10 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide (pH = 13.8) alkaline solution [47,48], then 5 wt % TiO2 was dissolved by continuously stirring for 12 min and a desired time is provided for drying. The obtained highly controlled thickness was ∼20 nm. The resulting PDA coated TiO2 mixture was added with 15 wt % PVA and 100 mL demineralized water and heated at 85ᴼC for 60−90 min. The preparation method of PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane is shown in Fig. 2 . The three prepared solutions were poured onto glass plates using a casting knife and then immersed for 10–15 seconds in coagulation bath composed of 4 g Na2SO4, 8 g NaOH in 100 mL of water. Finally, the membranes were dried at room temperature for 24 h."
4,Sample characterization,
5,X-Ray diffraction (XRD),3.1 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) The X-ray diffraction analysis was performed for analyzing the crystal structure. XRD patterns of fabricated membranes were obtained by Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer operating at 40 kV to 25 mA with kα radiation source of Cu having wavelength (λ = 1.542 Aᴼ) and a nickel filter. The patterns were recorded in the angle range (2Ө) of 0−80ᴼ.
6,Field emission scanning Electron microscopy (FESEM),3.2 Field emission scanning Electron microscopy (FESEM) The elemental composition and surface morphology of the synthesized membranes were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Model- Evo 18 Carl Zeiss) images. The samples were viewed at 10 kV accelerating voltages under a high vacuum.
7,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal stability of membrane samples was determined by thermal analyzer (Model- Shimadzu DT-60H, Japan). The 5−10 mg samples were heated in aluminum pans at 800ᴼC with a heating rate of 10ᴼC/min."
8,Tensile testing,"3.4 Tensile testing The tensile strength and elongation of membrane samples were examined by Universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell, Germany) by ASTM D882−02 standard. The specifications used in this testing are: Gauge length = 2 in., Dimensions = 1 in. width x 5 in. length Testing speed=25 mm/min"
9,Filtration experiments,"3.5 Filtration experiments The wastewater filtration experiments were carried out in a nanofiltration system shown in Fig. 3 . The pretreatment of paper mill wastewater is the most prominent technique for removal of foulants before the membrane process. The pretreatment method will minimize requirement for frequent cleaning and will ultimately prevent the drop in flux. The adsorption and ultrafiltration pretreatment was done for reducing the TSS, COD and color prior to nanofiltration. The total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total colony count (TCC) were determined by conventional filtration method, TDS meter, calorimeter technique, 5 day BOD5 test and agar diffusion test respectively. Table 1 . Illustrates the measured composition of wastewater of Security Papers Limited, Pakistan. The permeate flux (J) of the synthesized membranes was calculated after every 25 min for 5 h using the following equation: J = V ( A Δ t ) Where, V is the volume of permeate, A is the area of membrane and Δt is the permeation time of the sample. The rejection percentage of the water samples can be described by the following equation: R % = 1 - C p C f × 100 Where, Cp and C f are the permeate and feed concentrations respectively."
10,UV–vis Spectrum analysis,3.6 UV–vis Spectrum analysis The UV–vis spectra of water samples was recorded by Shimadzu UV-1800 Visible spectrophotometer. The change in absorbance was measured as a function of wavelength. The filtered water samples were dispensed between a detector and UV–vis light by using cuvette.
11,Results and discussion,
12,XRD analysis,"4.1 XRD analysis The XRD pattern of the developed membranes is shown in Fig. 4 . Generally, amorphous polymers give broad peaks and the crystalline polymers depicts high intensity and sharp peaks [49] It is well known that a semi-crystalline peak is shown by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at 2Ө = 20° [50–52] at a diffraction spacing of 4.5 A°. The PVA/TiO2 membrane exhibited many distinct diffraction peaks at 2Ө values of 20°, 25.25°, 34.5°, 53.84°, 62.67°, 68.89° and 74.84°. In reference with JCPDS Card No. 21-1274, the peaks at 25.25°, 34.5°, 53.84°, 62.67° and 68.89° were matched with crystal planes of (101), (004), (105), (204) and (116) respectively, which confirms the incorporation of Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. In PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane, a prominent peak of polydopamine was observed at 2Ө of 12.75° with diffraction spacing of 6.95 A°, which validates the successful polymerization and coating on anatase nanoparticle. The TiO2 peak only appears at 25.25° which confirm that crystallization is not similar in all directions of the membrane sample. The other peaks of TiO2 disappear because the crystals have grown only in (101) direction due to less crystalline phase and impurities as well as high PVA and dopamine concentration."
13,Morphological studies of membranes,"4.2 Morphological studies of membranes The surface morphology of the developed nanocomposite membranes was recorded in FESEM micrographs shown in Figs. 5–7 . The small size and high specific surface area caused the TiO2 nanoparticles to segregate and agglomerate during dispersing in the polymer matrix. For overcoming this problem, TiO2 NPs need to be surface functionalized by modifying with polydopamine to enhance their covalent bonding to the polymer matrix. The magnified images confirmed that the polydopamine coating on anatase nanoparticles improved the uniformity in dispersion. The SEM images of anatase titanium dioxide nanoparticles and dopamine coated anatase nanoparticles confirmed the successful coating of polydopamine on anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. In both images of cross-sectional view, the top dark layer was a catalyst layer and the light layer on bottom surface shows transparent porous structure of membranes. The PVA/TiO2 membrane has slightly lower thickness of 34.8 μm–36.0 μm in comparison with PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane of 35.7 μm–37.7 μm, which shows that effect of dopamine on thickness of membranes."
14,Mechanical properties,"4.3 Mechanical properties The mechanical strength and elongation at break of synthesized membranes is represented in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that by the addition of anatase nanoparticles, the tensile strength improved from 5.5 N to 13.3 N but elongation slightly decreased by 1%. The TiO2 molecules filled the gaps between PVA polymer chains and increased the tensile strength [53]. The coating of dopamine on TiO2 enhanced the elasticity of PVA membrane to 156 %. When uniaxial stress applied, the particles which were debonded caused shear yielding and showed voids in the matrix. Therefore, the plastic deformation ability and high toughness reduced the hardness which ultimately causes low tensile strength and less dispersion."
15,Thermal degradation,"4.4 Thermal degradation The thermogravimetric analysis was performed to determine the effect of membranes structure on the degradation behavior. According to Fig. 9 , it was evident that all three synthesized membranes exhibited thermal degradation in three steps: - In the first region, the evaporation of volatile matter/ moisture takes place which accounts for 19.4 %, 28.3 % and 19.2 % weight loss in three different membranes. - The second step revealed that PVA, PVA/TiO2 membrane showed degradation from 200 to 400ᴼC with weight loss of 64 % and 70.5 %. The decomposition in PVA/TiO2 starts from 200 up to 600ᴼC. - The third region represents the cleavage of carbon backbone in PVA and carbonization of degraded elements to ash in three membranes. The final degradation temperatures of PVA, PVA/TiO2 and PVA/TiO2/Dopamine observed are 660, 725 and 1000ᴼC respectively. The thermal stability of PVA polymer increased by the addition of nanoparticles [54] due to strong interaction between polymer matrix and TiO2 [55]."
16,Filtered water analysis,"4.5 Filtered water analysis 4.5.1 Total suspended solids (TSS) removal Conventional filtration technique was applied for determining total suspended solids (TSS) concentration through 4 μm filter paper. The untreated wastewater had TSS value of 80 mg/L. The poly(vinyl alcohol) membrane decreased the TSS concentration from 80 to 30 mg/L. The incorporation of dopamine coated TiO2 NPs decreased the pore size and enhance the quality of filtered water. Therefore, the addition of nanoparticles reduced TSS value, as they act as nanofillers by blocking the penetration of suspended contaminants into the filtrate. This is the reason why both PVA/TiO2 and PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membranes showed TSS removal efficiencies of 80 % and 87.5 % respectively. TiO2 would also function as a self-cleaning material to prevent the pollutants from attaching with membrane and will eventually enhance the chemical stability and antimicrobial resistance. Due to the highly functional nature of PDA, some of its quantity got removed with biodegradable organics present in wastewater. Therefore, we were not be able to get 90 % removal efficiency. Fig. 10 . shows the removal efficiencies of membranes. 4.5.2 Total dissolved solids (TDS) removal The TDS meter was used for finding the total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration. The TDS value of paper mill wastewater was 1100 mg/L. The PVA membrane reduced the TDS to 1000 mg/L and PVA/TiO2 membrane showed 940 mg/L with removal efficiency of 14.55 %. The water treated with PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane had highest removal percentage due to the hydrophilicity of polydopamine. The overall TDS removal percentage was considerably low because dissolved impurities could not be removed by nanopores of fabricated membranes. The results indicated that these membranes were not much effective for removing dissolved salts and impurities. Therefore, coagulation-flocculation aided clarification and primary-settling [56] was needed before nanofiltration. The TDS removal percentage of nanofiltration membranes were given in Fig. 11 . 4.5.3 Effect on Chemical Oxygen demand (COD) Calorimeter technique was used for finding the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of treated water samples. The COD of untreated water was found to be 326 mg/L. The recorded TDS value of wastewater treated with PVA membrane was 264 mg/L with removal percentage of 19.03 %. The highest removal efficiency of 62.05 % was obtained from PVA/TiO2 membrane due to the advanced action of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles which enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater contaminants. The reaction of catechol hydroxyl in PDA with hydroxyl groups present on TiO2 NPs formed a hydrogen bonding and susceptible to produce an organic thin coating on TiO2 surface and reduces the agglomerates formed by NPs. However, dopamine is highly sensitive to oxygen and liable to direct oxidization by reacting with oxygen or other oxidants present in wastewater and yield quinones and many free radicals [57], thus the layer formed by PDA broken and the agglomeration of TiO2 took place. Consequently, the highly reactive properties of polydopamine in PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane caused it to react with inactive organic matter [58] which increased the COD value to 652 mg/L. The antimicrobial action of dopamine also decreased the rate of bacterial growth in wastewater which take part in the degradation of organic matter and consequently COD value increased. Table 2 . illustrates the COD removal percentage of treated water samples. 4.5.4 Effect on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) A 5 Day BOD5 analysis test was applied for measuring the values of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration of the water treated with developed nanofiltration membranes. The wastewater sample found to had a BOD concentration of 128 mg/L. The water treated with PVA membrane showed 104 mg/L BOD value with removal percentage of 19.54 %. The PVA/TiO2 membrane reduced the BOD value to 65 mg/L, showing a reduction of 50 % in initial BOD concentration. The dopamine coating in PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane increased the BOD concentration to 182 mg/L. The experiments were conducted at 30ᴼC but in PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane, the reaction of PDA with organic contaminants and dissolved salts raised the temperature of wastewater which caused decrease in oxygen content [59] and lowers the microbial activity, therefore the potential to remove the contaminants decreased [60]. As a result, the BOD value became high in PVATiO2/Dopamine sample. The BOD concentrations of treated water samples are given in Table 3 . 4.5.5 Total colony count (TCC) removal The agar diffusion technique was used for measuring the total colony count (TCC) of treated water samples. The untreated paper mill wastewater showed TCC value of 3000 cfu/mLx103. The pure PVA membrane decreased the initial TCC concentration by 50 %. The incorporation of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles caused the TCC to get reduced from 3000 to 1100 cfu/mLx103, showing microbial removal percentage of 63.35 %. The TCC concentration of PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane was found to be 600 cfu/mLx103, which the lowest value. The dopamine coating on TiO2 nanoparticles improved the microbes removal efficiency by 30 %, due to the presence of catechols which help in its strong bonding with organic/inorganic surfaces [61] for enhancing the adhesive and antimicrobial properties of polydopamine. The microbial removal efficiencies of membranes are shown in Fig. 12 . 4.5.6 Permeate quality of the water samples The salt rejection, conductivity of the fabricated membranes was measured and the quality of the treated water was determined for characterizing their performance. Table 4 . presents the recorded average values of different parameters. The quality of obtained permeates by the different membrane samples was analyzed by comparing with the actual wastewater sample of Security Papers Limited, Pakistan. The permeate removal percentage was calculated from the initial feed concentration and the final concentration of the permeate for the evaluation of salt rejection and separation performance. The membrane containing dopamine coated TiO2 NPs showed the highest removal rate of CaCO3, sulphate and chloride and the resulted conductivity was 340 μS/cm. Therefore, this membrane is most suitable in terms of quality. The salt removal study concluded that the obtained permeate sample was colorless and had less suspended solids and total hardness. Furthermore, the resulting sulphate, chloride and conductivity removal efficiency of PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane were achieved as >85 %, 70 % and 75 % respectively. The flux of paper mill wastewater passing through the pores of nanocomposite membranes containing TiO2 and dopamine coated TiO2 was lower as compared to pure PVA membrane as recorded in Fig. 13 . The decline in flux caused by the lower pore sizes because NPs acted as fillers and decreased the permeability. The TiO2 agglomerates blocked the pores of membrane [62]. The PVA membrane showed high flux but the quality of permeate was not good. Moreover, PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane exhibited lower values of flux but the rejection rate of salts and other contaminants were much better than other two membranes. 4.5.7 UV–vis Spectrum The absorption spectra of water samples was recorded between 200 nm–750 nm wavelength and shown in Fig. 14 . It was clear that the absorption intensity of wastewater was obviously the highest due to the presence of aliphatic, aromatic and organic constituents. The UV–vis spectrum analysis showed the absence of colored constituents in the water. The obtained results imply that PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane was the most effective membrane for the removal of contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry. The values of maximum absorbance (λmax) of all the water samples are given in Table 5 ."
17,Conclusions,"The nanofiltration membranes were prepared by the incorporation of dopamine coated anatase core shell nanoparticles in poly(vinyl alcohol. The addition of nanoparticles improved the mechanical and thermal stability as validated by Tensile and TGA testing. The FESEM and XRD results confirmed that the added particles were anatase TiO2 and their successful coating with polydopamine. The dissolved pollutants and microbes removal rate was enhanced by the advanced action of anatase nanoparticles and PDA due to which PVA/TiO2/Dopamine membrane exhibited highest removal percentage of TSS, TDS and microorganisms removal. They showed high COD and BOD values due to highly functional nature of dopamine so it got removed with organic matter. Although, the flux was lower due to blockage of pores by NPs but the quality of permeate was better as compared to other synthesized membranes. The overall results indicated that these membranes have low cost, easy operation and high potential to remove waste contaminants from wastewater of paper and pulp industry but a suitable technique should be applied for the removal of dissolved TiO2 nanoparticles, as they may pose threat to humans and aquatic ecosystems."
