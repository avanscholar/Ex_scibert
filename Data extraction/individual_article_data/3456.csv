0,Introduction,"Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with fully cross-linked open framework structures made up of corner-sharing SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra and have been widely used in catalytic field due to their particular frameworks, small pore size and high internal surface area [1,2,3]. In recent years, there has been an extended utilization of zeolites in photocatalytic transformation [4,5,6]. Since zeolites are often considered as a kind of insulator with extremely large band gap, the combination of them with semiconductor or organic photosensitiser is a common but effective strategy to achieve better photocatalytic performance [7]. In this case, its photochemical activity is mainly derived from the excited guest photocatalysts being loaded on zeolite matrix. Alternatively, introducing some heteroatoms such as Ag [8], V [9], Cu [10], Ti [11] and other transition metals [12,13] into the framework of zeolites will bring to a family of metal-doped zeolite photocatalysts with the generation of new metal oxo species (MO). These MO units distributed in framework favour the single electron transfer from the adjacent lattice oxygen to metal atom under light excitation, providing the potential for chemical reactions [14]. Anpo et al. [10,15] reported that the isolated metal oxo species [M(n−1)+ O2−]∗ can be excited by UV light to initiate charge transfer, which is similar to the photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor. Sharing a similar exciting process to metal oxo species, the commercial HZSM-5 was also found to show photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of bromomethane, ethylene or methyl orange due to the existence of impurities such as Fe in the zeolites [16]. In these photocatalytic systems, zeolite acts as either a functional support to promote the dispersion of photoactive components or a framework to coordinate with newly introduced elements, leading to an improved photocatalytic activity. However, no much attention is paid to the photocatalytic transformation on Si-Al zeolites themselves without the involvement of additional reactive elements. The origin of the photocatalytic reactivity of zeolites is still a puzzle and short of convincing chemical evidence. The removal of aluminum from the zeolite framework by thermal treatment results in the formation of extra-framework aluminium (EFAL) species with different coordination environment, such as AlO+, AlOH2+, Al(OH)2+, AlOOH and Al(OH)3 [17,18,19]. The presence of EFAL species is benefit for the catalytic performances of zeolites in the thermal catalytic system. However, the effect of these species on photocatalytic activity has attracted little attention. Yoshida et al. [20] reported highly isolated framework AlO units as the direct active sites of zeolites for the photoinduced non-oxidative coupling of methane, but the influence of the coordination environment of Al on catalytic activity of zeolite is still unclear. Aluminium atoms at specific locations of zeolites, such as edges, surfaces, corners, or clusters, can make their coordinative oxygen surroundings distorted and undergo an internal electron transfer process from O to Al. Some parameters, such as charge density of Al and O, distance of AlO bond and crystallographic position of Al, may have an impact on the frequency and intensity of the transition in such AlO species [21]. Thus, obtaining the chemical relationship between Al-coordinating environment and photocatalytic behaviour of zeolite is of fundamental importance in understanding the catalytic mechanism of this special photocatalysts and its further application. Here, we report that the coordination environment of Al in HZSM-5 plays an important role in modulating its photocatalytic behaviours. The selective oxidation of isopropyl alcohol was used as a probe reaction. By simple calcination process to tune the coordination environment of zeolites, we can obtain various transformation paths of isopropyl alcohol towards different target products (acetone or CO2) over modified HZSM-5 samples."
1,Experimental section,
2,HZSM-5 modification,"2.1 HZSM-5 modification The parent sample of HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50/1 was obtained via ion exchange of commercial NaZSM-5 (Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd.). Specifically, the NaZSM-5 zeolites were converted into ammonium forms (NH4ZSM-5) by ion exchange with the NH4NO3 aqueous solution at about 95 °C for 1 h. The NH4ZSM-5 sample was further heated from room temperature to 120 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and maintained at 120 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the sample was heated up to 500 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, and maintained at 500 °C for 6 h to obtain parent sample of HZSM-5. The parent HZSM-5 was further calcined at 800 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min for 10 h under H2 atmosphere. Finally, the obtained product was labelled as Z-8H and kept in the glove-box. Other samples, such as Z-8O, Z-8N, Z-7H, and Z-9H, were prepared using similar procedures to that of Z-8H, except for some changes in atmosphere (O2 or N2) and temperature (700 or 800 °C)."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The spectra of 29Si MAS NMR and 27Al MAS NMR were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer equipped with a 4 mm magic-angle spinning probe (MAS) with resonance frequencies of 299.78 and 104.26 MHz for 29Si and 27Al, respectively, and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm. The 29Si and 27Al chemical shifts were referenced to kaolinite (−91.5 ppm) and 1 M Al(NO3)3 aqueous solution (0 ppm), respectively. The structure and crystalline nature of HZSM-5 and the modified HZSM-5 samples were measured by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at a respective voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) investigation was carried out on a Hitachi SU8010 with accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The specific surface area properties are evaluated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorption instrument at 77 K. The total acid sites and acid strength distribution on the surface of zeolite samples are determined by ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements using a FINESORB TPD/TPR 2900 (AutoChem 2920) chemisorption instrument with a TCD detector. The Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (BAS and LAS, respectively) were characterized by FT-IR of pyridine adsorption measurements performed on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 instrument at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Typically, the dried sample was pressed into a self-supported thin wafer and placed into the sample holder. Then, the catalyst sample was first degassed in dynamic vacuum (10−2 Pa) at 723 K for 2 h. After cooling down to 313 K, the background spectrum was recorded. Sufficient amount of pyridine was introduced to the infrared cell and held for 1 h to allow equilibrium. After the excess of pyridine was eliminated under vacuum at 473 K for 2 h, the background spectrum was recorded. The spectrum of adsorbed pyridine was obtained after the cell cooled to room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to determine the chemical bonding states and the element content on the surface of samples using a ULVAC-PHI 1800 ESCA system with Al Kα radiation (X-ray power 350 W). The binding energy (BE) was calibrated based on the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The Al content of the obtained zeolite samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Plasma 300). The UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of catalyst samples were obtained with a Varian Cary 500 Scan spectrophotometer equipped with an integrator sphere and BaSO4 (100%) was used as a reflectance reference. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker A300 instrument with the DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, 0.1 mmol) as the radical scavenger."
4,Photocatalytic tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic tests The oxidation of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was conducted in a self-designed fixed-bed continuous-flow mode system equipped with a tubular quartz reactor (L = 150 mm) and four ultraviolet lamps (8 W, 254 nm). The reaction temperature is maintained by air-conditioning. Initially, the continuous oxygen gas flow containing a certain amount of isopropyl alcohol substrate pass through a reactor charged with 0.2 g HZSM-5 catalyst. The pressure of O2 is 0.2 MPa, and the flow rate is 20 mL/min. The initial concentration of isopropyl alcohol is 150 ppm. After irradiation, the effluent gas products are analysed every 30 min using online gas chromatography (GC, 6890, Agilent Co.) equipped with TCD and FID detectors and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, 6890-5973, Agilent Co.). The IPA conversion, product selectivity and yield can be calculated, respectively, using the Eqs. (1a), (1b), (1c) below: (1a) IPA c o n v e r s i o n % = IP A in - I P A out / I P A in ∗ 100 (1b) Product s e l e c t i v i t y % = P r o d u c t out / IP A in - I P A out ∗ 100 (1c) Product y i e l d % = P r o d u c t out / I P A in ∗ 100 where IPAin is the initial concentration of IPA, IPAout is the post-reaction concentration of IPA, and Productout is the concentration of product."
5,Computational methods,"2.4 Computational methods For theoretical calculations, a 51T cluster model (Si50AlO71H62) was selected as a standard structure of zeolite which was extracted from the crystal structure data [22]. In order to explore the structures of penta-coordinated and hexa-coordinated extra-framework aluminum species generated via calcination, the penta-coordinated (AlO5 7−, AlO4OH6−, AlO3(OH)2 5−, AlO2(OH)3 4−, AlO(OH)4 3−, Al(OH)5 2−), tetra-coordinated (AlO4 5−, AlO3OH4−, AlO2(OH)2 3−, AlO(OH)3 2−, Al(OH)4 1−) and tri-coordinated (AlO3 3−, AlO2OH2−, AlO(OH)2 1−, Al(OH)3) extra-framework aluminum species were added into the 51T zeolite model to construct initial models, respectively. To keep the integrity of zeolite during the calculation, the constrains calculations were applied during the geometry optimization process, only the adsorbed isopropyl alcohol molecule and the nearest four SiO or AlO species were relaxed while the rest of atoms were fixed as their crystal data. The Dmol3 package [23,24] were applied to our calculations based on the Density Functional Theoretical (DFT) approach. The exchange-correlation term was considered using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). The double numeric quality basis set with polarization functions (DNP) [23,25,26] was adopted, which was comparable to 6-31G (d, p) [27,28]. The numerical basis sets can minimize the basis-set superposition error [27,29]. A Fermi smearing of 0.005 hartree was utilized. The tolerances of the energy, gradient and displacement convergence were 2 × 10−5 hartree, 4 × 10−3 hartree per Å, and 5 × 10−3 Å, respectively. The formation energy (ΔE form) of the HZSM-5 with FAL and EFAL species was calculated as Eq. (2a), the interaction energy (ΔE int) between isopropyl alcohol molecule and the HZSM-5 with FAL (or FAL with EFAL) species was evaluated according to Eq. (2b) (2a) Δ E form = E ab - E a - E b (2b) Δ E int = E complex - E ab - E IPA where E ab is the energy of the HZSM-5 with FAL and EFAL species, E a is the energy of HZSM-5 with FAL species, E b is the energy of the EFAL species. E complex is the energy of the complex containing isopropyl alcohol and HZSM-5 with FAL (or FAL with EFAL) species. E IPA is the energy of isopropyl alcohol molecule."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Catalytic activity of zeolite samples,"3.1 Catalytic activity of zeolite samples The oxidation of isopropyl alcohol over HZSM-5 catalyst was examined under UV light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1 , the HZSM-5 affords 94% conversion of isopropyl alcohol with a 80% selectivity to acetone and a 8% selectivity to CO2. Control experiments show that, almost no product was detected under dark conditions or in the absence of HZSM-5 (Table S1). These results indicate that, the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol over HZSM-5 is a typical photocatalytic process and HZSM-5 is responsible for the transformation of isopropyl alcohol. In contrast to HZSM-5, a distinctly different photocatalytic behaviour was observed when a series of modified zeolites such as Z-8H, Z-8N and Z-8O were also employed as the photocatalysts. All the calcined HZSM-5 catalysts exhibit slightly higher isopropyl alcohol conversion (∼100%, Fig. 1a), lower selectivity of acetone (Fig. 1b) and higher selectivity of CO2 (Fig. 1c) than HZSM-5. The acetone yield follows an order of HZSM-5 (103 ppm) > Z-8O (64 ppm) > Z-8N (47 ppm) > Z-8H (23 ppm), while the order of CO2 yield is HZSM-5 (36 ppm) < Z-8O (62 ppm) < Z-8N (208 ppm) < Z-8H (247 ppm). This suggests that calcination treatment results in an increased yield of CO2 at the expense of acetone yield and the best calcination atmosphere for CO2 formation was H2. We further compare the effect of calcination temperature on CO2 selectivity of modified HZSM-5 catalysts by employing Z-7H, Z-8H and Z-9H as the model catalysts (Fig. S1). The average CO2 yield over the Z-8H catalyst is 249 ppm, which is 2.5 times higher than that of the Z-7H (91 ppm). However, when the calcination temperature was increased up to 900 °C, the prepared zeolite catalyst shows a slightly decrease of CO2 selectivity (220 ppm), probably due to the destruction of molecular sieve framework at such a high temperature. In terms of CO2 selectivity, the most appropriate calcination temperature for HZSM-5 is 800 °C. These results imply that calcination could enhance the photocatalytic activity of zeolite catalysts and affect the transformation pathways of isopropyl alcohol, possibly due to the structure change of HZSM-5. This encourages us to further study the effect of zeolite structure on its photocatalytic performance for the oxidation reaction of isopropyl alcohol."
8,Physicochemical properties,"3.2 Physicochemical properties The as-obtained HZSM-5 zeolite photocatalysts calcined under different atmosphere of H2, N2 and O2 with a calcination temperature of 800 °C (denoted as Z-8H, Z-8N and Z-8O) are used as three model catalysts with raw HZSM-5 as the reference to explore the influence of calcination on the physicochemical properties of zeolites. All these catalysts exhibited UV light response in the wavelength range of 200–350 nm in UV–Vis spectra (Fig. 2 a). These absorption bands were contributed by Al-O unites via the charge transfer from Al3+ to O2− in zeolite catalysts [30]. Especially for Z-8H, a small decrease occurred in the band around 226 nm corresponding to the tetrahedral framework aluminium (FAL) bonded to oxygen [31]. Meanwhile, the band centred at 276 nm contributed by EFAL increased [32]. This indicates that a small fraction of FAL species are removed from the framework to form EFAL species [31,33]. We reason that AlO unites as the active sites are responsible for the activation of isopropyl alcohol under UV light irradiation and the changes in chemical environment of AlO unites may affect the transformation paths of isopropyl alcohol. Thus, understanding this change will help us to design suitable HZSM-5 catalyst for photocatalytic redox reactions. Initially, the coordination environments of Si and Al are analysed by 29Si MAS NMR and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2b and c). As demonstrated in the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of HZSM-5, two typical peaks centred at about −112 ppm and −105 ppm correspond to the framework Si connected to 4 other Si (denoted Q4 (0Al)) and the framework Si bound to 3Si and 1Al (denoted Q4 (1Al)), respectively (Fig. 2b) [34]. After calcination treatment, the Q4 (0Al) signals of catalysts increase significantly in their intensity, indicating a decrease of FAL content. All these results suggest the removal of Al species from the framework [35]. Fig. 2c shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectra for the raw and calcined zeolite materials. For all zeolites, four maxima observed at 93, 48, 26, and −3 ppm can be assigned to tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-coordinated Al species, respectively [36]. The corresponding concentration of tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-coordinated Al of the raw HZSM-5 are 3%, 51%, 28% and 17%, respectively (Fig. 2d). After calcination treatment, the content of penta-, and hexa-coordinated Al species increases, and the intensity of the tetra-coordinated FAL species decreases. For Z-8H, these changes were the most obvious among the three calcined catalysts. This indicates that calcination under H2 atmosphere is more benefit for the formation of EFAL species. The possible reason is that hydrogen molecules and oxygen atoms on the interface of zeolites can combine to form water, resulting in atomic rearrangement to form high-coordinated EFAL at high temperature [37]. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 3 a), all peaks appeared in the modified HZSM-5 catalysts (Z-8H, Z-8N, Z-8O) generally match the standard phase of HZSM-5 zeolite. However, the characteristic peaks at 2θ range of 26.2–26.8° for three calcined catalysts show a slight shift to a larger angle (Z-8H (ca. 0.16°), Z-8N (ca. 0.17°) and Z-8O (ca. 0.18°)) compared to that of the HZSM-5 (Fig. 3b), suggesting a decrease in lattice spacing after calcination [38]. This fact can be explained by the removal of Al from the zeolite lattice which has been tentatively confirmed in the 29Si MAS NMR spectra. For Si and Al species in the zeolite, their binding energy was further monitored by XPS (Fig. 4 ). The survey spectra of the elemental composition for all zeolite samples confirmed that they are predominantly composed of O, Al and Si elements (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, the O 1s core level spectrum of the raw HZSM-5 shows a strong peak at 532.2 eV, which is ascribed to the binding energy (BE) of lattice oxygen in the zeolite framework [39]. For all calcined HZSM-5 samples, an additional peak appears at a higher binding energy of about 534.7 eV due to the appearance of chemisorbed oxygen [40], and the intensity of the corresponding peak increased with the increasing of penta-, hexa-coordinated Al species in these catalysts. The chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of metal oxide is conventionally considered as an important active oxygen species to favor oxidation reaction [41]. This explanation is in accord with the fact that Z-8H having more chemisorbed oxygen exhibits higher mineralization efficiency in the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol. The binding energies of Si 2p and Al 2p of the zeolite samples are 103.5 eV and 74.6 eV, respectively, which is in agreement with that reported in the literature (Fig. 4c, d), [42]. The quantification of Si and Al in catalysts was also analysed. As shown in Table 1 , the calcination, whatever it is in oxidizing atmosphere or in reducing atmosphere, can lead to a significant decrease of near-surface Si/Al ratio in the prepared catalysts, suggesting the increase of the Al species on the surface. The Z-8H shows the minimum near-surface Si/Al ratio, indicating that the use of hydrogen in calcination is benefit for the formation of dealumination species in the calcined catalysts (Table 1, entry 2). The increased Al species on the surface may be derived from the removed Al species which preferentially migrate from the zeolite lattice to the walls of the microspores and the outer surface. The optimized geometry structures of the raw and the calcined zeolite samples with different coordination environment around Al atoms and their formation energy from the ground-state are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in Fig. 5 , the optimized structures for raw HZSM-5 with tetra-coordinated Al species and calcined HZSM-5 samples with penta-, hexa-coordinated EFAL species are all energetic stable. An optimized stable hexa-coordinated aluminium complex with Al(OH)3 unit connected to three O-Si moieties in the framework was successfully obtained, and the formation energy of this complex is calculated to be about −6.64 Kcal mol−1 (Fig. 5b, k). Up to eight stable aluminium complexes models for penta-coordinated cases were also optimized smoothly (Fig. 5c–j). Among them, the one with AlO2(OH)2 3– unit connected to framework aluminium showed the lowest formation energy of −65.88 Kcal mol−1 (Penta-3, Fig. 5e, k). These calculated results coupling with NMR, XPS and XRD evidences provide rational justification for the existence and detailed structural information of EFAL species in calcined zeolites. Generally, the prerequisite adsorption of the target substrate molecule on the surface of catalyst is an important premise for photocatalytic activation [43,44]. Thus, the adsorption ability of raw and modified zeolites for isopropyl alcohol and acetone was tested. As shown in Fig. S2, the HZSM-5 with defined pore framework structure exhibits a longer adsorption equilibrium time than that of TiO2 (P25), a nonporous photocatalyst powder [45,46]. Both the Z-8H and Z-8N catalysts have a similar adsorption equilibrium time for isopropyl alcohol to the HZSM-5, indicating their similar adsorption capability for isopropyl alcohol as the HZSM-5 (Fig. 6 ). The Z-8O presents a lower adsorption capability for isopropyl alcohol and a shorter adsorption equilibrium time (260 min) than the HZSM-5 (Fig. 6a). Different from the isopropyl alcohol adsorption, both the Z-8N and Z-8O catalysts have a lower adsorption capacity of acetone than HZSM-5, while the Z-8H exhibits a similar adsorption capacity to the HZSM-5 (Fig. 6b). NH3-TPD curves of the parent and calcined HZSM-5 catalysts show that the Z-8N and Z-8O catalysts have lower acidity than the HZSM-5 while the Z-8H has the highest acidity (Fig. 7 a). The ratio of BAS to LAS of zeolites samples increases notably because of a more significant decline of LAS than BAS after calcination treatment (Fig. 7b, Table S2). These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between the acidity of the catalysts and their selectivity and activity in this photocatalytic reaction. According to the experimental evidences above, we can conclude that the adsorption capacity and the acidity of Z-8H and HZSM-5 are not the main cause for their distinct reaction routes of isopropyl alcohol towards different target products (acetone or CO2)."
9,Prediction of the interaction energy between isopropyl alcohol and zeolite,"3.3 Prediction of the interaction energy between isopropyl alcohol and zeolite To explore the interaction energy between isopropyl alcohol and zeolite, theoretical calculation models were thus constructed by setting the isopropyl alcohol molecule in the optimized geometries of a series of zeolite samples with different coordinated Al unites. The interaction energy was obtained by Eq. (2b). As shown in Fig. 8 , though the interaction model of adsorptive isopropyl alcohol and tetra-coordinated (or hexa-) aluminium complex can be established in DFT calculations, a rather long distance of about 5.70 Å (or 3.64 Å) between framework Al and the hydroxyl oxygen is required (Fig. 8a, b). This does not allow for an effective fixation of the target isopropyl alcohol molecule at the site of tetra-coordinated (or hexa-) aluminium. The interaction energy between isopropyl alcohol and the tetra-coordinated (or hexa-) aluminium complexes was −15.35 Kcal mol−1 (or 1.72 Kcal mol−1, Fig. 8k). For the optimized geometries of isopropyl alcohol adsorbed on penta-coordinated Al species, we found that the penta-3 complex with isopropyl alcohol adsorbed on AlO2(OH)2 3− moiety by forming a strong hydrogen-bond (1.52 Å) shows the lowest interaction energy of −78.50 Kcal mol−1 (Fig. 8e, k). Even with tetra-coordinated and hexa-coordinated aluminium complexes included, this penta-3 complex model with isopropyl alcohol fixed is the most thermodynamically stable one, suggesting the strongest interaction between molecular isopropyl alcohol and zeolite samples with different coordinated Al species. We reason that this enhanced interaction between the substrate molecule and changed zeolite structure will result in more pronounced polarization and deeper mineralization of adsorbed isopropyl alcohol [47]. Indeed, among all the zeolite samples, Z-8H possessing the highest proportion of penta-coordinated Al species afforded the highest yield of CO2 in the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol as expected."
10,Proposed mechanism for photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol,"3.4 Proposed mechanism for photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol Based on the experimental evidences and previous reports [10,48], a plausible reaction mechanism for photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol over zeolite catalysts is proposed in Fig. 9 . Initially, the isopropyl alcohol molecule as weak ligand was adsorbed on the Al-O unit (FAL or EFAL) of zeolite catalysts (a and a′) spontaneously to form weak HO and OAl bonds (b and b′). Under 254 nm UV light irradiation, an electron transfer from O2− to Al3+ in zeolite catalysts occurred, thus producing an charge-transfer excited state of [Al2+ O−]* (c, d, c′ and d′). The O- site in the excited [Al2+ O−]* unit abstracted the α-hydrogen of isopropyl alcohol to form a carbon radical intermediate (e and e′). Due to the different interactions between the substrate molecule and zeolite catalysts with different Al species (FAL, EFAL), the adsorbed isopropyl alcohol on different zeolite catalysts exhibited different transformation pathways. As for the FAL, after hydrogen abstraction, acetone as the target product was generated and desorbed subsequently. The reduced Al2+ species in zeolite catalysts was then reoxidized to Al3+ species by molecular oxygen via the electron transfer from the Al2+ site to O2, giving a superoxide radical anion (O2 −, f). The combination of O2 − and H+ generated H2O2. However, in the case of EFAL, the carbon radical intermediate anchored on the [Al2+ O2−] unit (e′) tended to react with O2, affording the peroxy-alkyl radical (f′). This peroxy-alkyl radical (f′) is conventionally considered as a key intermediate that can ultimately lead to the formation of inorganic CO2 and H2O [49]. The [Al2+ O2−] unit was transformed to the [Al3+ O2−] unit via O2 oxidation, accompanying the formation of O2 − (g′)."
11,Selective transformation of isopropyl alcohol,"3.5 Selective transformation of isopropyl alcohol For all HZSM-5 catalysts in the photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol, an increase of the FAL content resulted in the production of more acetone, while an increase of the EFAL content led to the formation of more CO2 (Fig. 10 ). That is to say, the selectivity of different terminate products (CO2 and acetone) is closely related to the coordination environment of Al species in the modified zeolites such as the embedding location and the coordination number. Thus, the modified HZSM-5 has potential for selective oxidation of isopropyl alcohol in multicomponent organic compounds. In the isopropyl alcohol-acetone mixture system, the photocatalytic selectivity of HZSM-5 and Z-8H were tested. As an acknowledged photocatalyst with strong mineralization capability for organic compounds, P25 is also used in this work for comparison. Fig. 11 a showed that all these photocatalysts give near to 100% conversion of isopropyl alcohol after irradiation for a certain time when the reaction equilibrium is reached. Obviously, there is a great difference in the distribution of products (acetone and CO2) over these catalysts (Fig. 11b, c). For P25, the concentration of acetone decreases while the concentration of CO2 (420 ppm) increases dramatically, suggesting that isopropyl alcohol and acetone were both mineralized indiscriminately. However, differentially catalytic performances were found when Z-8H and HZSM-5 were employed as the photocatalysts. In contrast to P25, Z-8H showed a moderate but effective mineralization capability for isopropyl alcohol with the concentration of acetone nearly unchanged in the mixture, while the yield of inorganic CO2 still reached up to 210 ppm. This indicated that Z-8H possess unconventionally photocatalytic activity that can recognize isopropyl alcohol in the isopropyl alcohol-acetone mixture system to process deep As for HZSM-5, extremely more acetone (210 ppm) was generated than that of CO2 (60 ppm), suggesting preferentially selective transformation of isopropyl alcohol to acetone. The most similarly photocatalytic behaviour could also be seen in the pure isopropyl alcohol reaction system by using HZSM-5 or Z-8H sample. These results well indicate that by regulating the coordination number of Al species via calcination, the series of HZSM-5 samples can selectively recognize target molecule and efficiently convert it to desired products, while P25 was disabled in the mixed gaseous organic compounds system. It should be a potential strategy to accomplish recognition and selective removal of certain organic molecules in mixture system by artificially regulating the chemical features of the zeolite photocatalyst."
12,Conclusions,"The HZSM-5 has proven to be effective for the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol under UV light irradiation. The AlO units serve as the active sites for photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol. The calcination treatment can modulate the embedding location and the coordination number of Al in zeolites, which results in controllable selectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of isopropyl alcohol. The selectivity toward acetone is associated with the content of FAL species, whereas the formation of CO2 is correlated with the content of newly formed EFAL species. High coordinated EFAL species in calcined zeolite can decrease the interaction energy between the isopropyl alcohol molecule and zeolite, giving a higher CO2 yield in the oxidation of isopropyl alcohol. All HZSM-5 samples can recognize target molecule in isopropyl alcohol-acetone mixture system and efficiently convert it to desired products. The understanding of structure-function relationships in HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is benefit for expanding its application in photocatalytic fields."
