0,Introduction,"In recent years, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have attracted world-wide attention as a sustainable technological solution for the treatment of organic effluents in a wide range of applications [1]. Originally developed for the treatment of wastewater or industrial effluent, anaerobic MBRs also bring about various opportunities and challenges for the co-production of energy (biogas) [2]. MBRs have been used for the intensification of hydrogen (H2) production by the dark fermentation process since the early 2000s [3]. Several implementation strategies of a membrane module have been tested: (i) in a solid/liquid extraction mode either in an ex situ [4,5] or an in situ [6] (Fig. 1 a) configuration, to increase the concentration of bacterial biomass or suspended organic matter by removing the liquid phase, (ii) in a liquid/liquid (L/L) extraction mode, to selectively extract part of the liquid components (organic acids) of the medium in order to limit their negative impacts on fermentation, either in an ex situ [7] or an in situ [8] configuration (Fig. 1b), (iii) in an ex situ gas/gas (G/G) extraction mode, to selectively extract hydrogen from the gas stream leaving the reactor in order to obtain purified/concentrated hydrogen [9,10] and finally in few studies [11-14] (iv) (Fig. 1c), in liquid/gas extraction mode, the membrane module can be directly placed in contact with the reaction medium in order to extract the gases produced therefrom (Fig. 1d). Keeping a low H2 partial pressure in the bioreactor, H2 being an inhibitor of the bacterial H2 production, and avoiding the washout of H2 producing bacteria (HPB) are both essential requirements for efficient continuous production of H2 by dark fermentation with regards to process efficiency. Several strategies aiming to lower H2 partial pressure inside the bioreactor were previously assessed. The use of N2 as a sweeping gas improved H2 yield (HY) from 23 to 88%, and increased H2 production rate (HPR) from 2.6- to 3.7-fold [10,15-17]. However, this strategy triggers the need for a subsequent H2/N2 separation step and increases process costs, which is a major drawback at industrial scale. The recycling of produced CO2 as a sweeping gas has also been envisioned, given that H2/CO2 separation processes are more advanced technologically [18]. For instance, a G/G separation membrane coupled to a dark fermentation bioreactor allowed the retention of produced CO2 and its reintroduction within the reactive medium, enhancing HPR by 25% compared to performance in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) [10]. Also, slight continuous pressure release (via vacuum) in a CSTR reactor enhanced H2 production at low HRTs (4–8 h) [19]. The operation of a liquid/gas MBR in semibatch mode was also proposed, for the submerged H2-permeable flat membrane to mimick H2-consuming microorganisms, but H2 production performances were not reported [13]. Similarly, HY was improved by 9% in a hollow fiber MBR (using a silicone rubber membrane) but at the expense increased process energy cost, as the produced gases were extracted using a vacuum pump [14]. Aiming to decouple HPB retention from hydraulic retention time (HRT), various configurations of immobilized biomass bioreactors were also tested, often taking advantage of the propensity of microbial cultures to progressively form biofilms in presence of a solid support. In continuous MBRs, the substrate is usually pumped at the bottom of a column bioreactor, so the liquid flowing towards an outlet positioned at its top end [20,21]. The instauration of pH and nutrient gradients and the use of a single-use support are main issues of this configuration. An exchangeable cartridge arrangement was proposed to limit the pH and nutrient gradient [22]. The implementation of solid/liquid membrane bioreactors (S/L MBRs) have also been envisaged to increase HPB density and to limit the volume of dark fermentation bioreactors, but membrane fouling resulting from the adhesion of extrapolymeric substances was reported to impede process flow [4,23]. The ability of some HPB to auto-aggregate and form granules was exploited in Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) [24] and Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) bioreactor configurations [25] avoiding the need of neither a solid support nor of a S/L membrane to be retained within the bioreactor. However, preferential flows, hydraulic short-cuts, dead volumes and the extensive length of time to form the granules remain bottlenecks to be addressed [3]. In order to meet both dark fermentation requirements of efficient hydrogen extraction and bacterial biomass immobilization, a continuous liquid/gas membrane bioreactor (L/G MBR) was previously developed in our laboratory [17] (Fig. 1e). A hollow fiber module was used to extract produced gases continuously and to provide a support for the development of a HPB biofilm [11]. The liquid phase circulated outside the hollow fibers, while produced gases diffused to the lumen of hollow fibers. Contrary to S/L MBRs, the L/G MBR was not sensitive to membrane fouling because the biofilm does not limit gas diffusion through the membrane. HPB were retained both via quick biofilm and minimal granule formation, independently of time-consuming formation and stabilization of granules as reported in immobilized biomass bioreactors. In the present article, we report several improvements of the H2 production process by dark fermentation in the L/G MBR. After a one-time initial microbial seeding, long term operation of the L/G MBR was investigated, with multiple process stops and restarts without further seeding. Different strategies of gas extraction were tested. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) were optimized. The impact of these modifications on the production of hydrogen and metabolites, and on the composition of bacterial communities growing in the membrane bioreactor were analyzed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feed solution,"2.1 Feed solution The feed solution was composed of 12 g/L glucose, 0,175 g/L KH2PO4, 3.5 g/L (NH4)2 SO4, 0.25 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.05 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.002 g/L NiCl2·6H2O. The mix was then filtered on a Büchner filter with 40 µm pore size and stored at 4°C until needed. The feed solution was diluted when lower OLR were tested."
3,Bioreactor setup and operation,"2.2 Bioreactor setup and operation The L/G MBR (Fig. 2 a) was constituted of a cylindrical-shaped hollow-fiber membrane module and had a total working volume of 0.5 L. Ultrafiltration polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hollow fibers were sealed at each extremity of the membrane module. The bioreactor was seeded as described previously [12] with fresh activated sludgeintroduced in a stirred tank reactor and went through a thermal treatment at 70°C during 1 h. The temperature was regulated at 37°C. After 5 h of fermentation, the hydrogen production was at its maximum and the reactive medium was transferred in the MBR where the fermentation occurs in continuous and corresponds to the 0-day test. Before each experiment, feed solution was injected into the bioreactor circuit within 30 min using a peristaltic pump. Fermentation starting time was defined as the timepoint when the filling of the bioreactor circuit was completed. During the fermentation test, the system was continuously fed using a peristaltic pump. pH of the liquid outlet was measured using a multi-parameter analyzer and maintained at 5.1 ± 0.3 by the addition of a solution of NaOH 0.5 M into the liquid medium using a peristaltic pump, which speed was adjusted manually. Temperature was maintained at 37°C with heated water circulating within a heating coil placed around the membrane module. The bioreactor was emptied and rinsed with water after each test. HRT was initially set at 12 h and OLR at 0.8 g-glucose-L-medium/h. During HRT/OLR optimization tests, HRT was modified by acting on the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump. OLR was adjusted accordingly to reach its desired value by diluting the feed solution when necessary. By default, sweeping gas (N2) circulated at a flow rate of 11 mL/min within the lumen of the hollow fibers (Fig. 2b). When CO2 was tested as sweeping gas, the same gas flow rate was applied. When no sweeping gas was used, the gas inlet was closed (Fig. 2c)."
4,Chemical analyses,"2.3 Chemical analyses The liquid outlet was sampled at time zero, twice a day during fermentation then centrifuged for 30 min at 4,500 rpm. Supernatants and pellets were stored separately at −18°C. 2.3.1 Gas analysis Gases were analyzed using a gas microchromatograph (T3000, SRA, France) equipped with thermal conductivity detectors, a molecular sieve column of 0.5 nm (10 m × 0.32 mm, 30 mm), and a PoraPLOT U column (8 m × 0.32 mm, 10 µm) for separation of N2, CH4, O2, H2 and CO2. Series of 3 analyses was performed every 10 min during L/G MBR operation. CO2 production could not be quantified when CO2 was used as a sweeping gas. 2.3.2 Analysis of organic acids, glucose and alcohols Organic acids (citrate, pyruvate, succinate, lactate, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and isovalerate) and glucose were analyzed simultaneously in culture supernatants by high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a variable wavelength detector and a refraction index detector. Supernatants were thawed, centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm and filtered at 0.2 µm. Resulting samples were injected (20 µL) onto a chromatographic HiPlex-H column (8 μm, 7.7 m × 300 mm, Agilent Technologies, USA) placed in an oven heated at 65°C. The mobile phase was composed of a solution of aqueous H2SO4 (5 mM) circulating at 0.4 mL/min. Each sample was analyzed twice. Alcohols (ethanol, butanol and propanol) were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (7890A GC, Agilent Technologies). Helium (0.6 mL/min) was used as vector gas. Supernatants were centrifuged during 15 min at 15,000 rpm, filtered at 0.2 µm and diluted with an internal standard. Resulting mixtures were injected (0.5 µL) in split mode into a chromatographic HP-INNOWax column (0.5 µm, 30 m × 0.25 mm, Agilent Technologies, USA) heated at 45°C for 4 min then oven temperature ramped up at 10°C/min until it reached 200°C. Each sample was analyzed 4 times."
5,Microbiological analyses,"2.4 Microbiological analyses 2.4.1 DNA sequencing DNA was extracted from culture pellets previously stored at −18°C using the Fast DNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals), following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer, and stored at −18°C. Concentration of extracted DNA was determined fluorometrically with the Qubit® dsDNA HS assay kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Variable regions V4-V5 of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced using a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina Inc., USA). The identification of bacterial taxa was performed using the online software NCBI Nucleotide Blast and the 16S rRNA sequences database. The sequences presenting more than a 97% identity were considered as belonging to the same phylotype. Bacterial diversity was estimated using the Simpson index, tending towards 0 in datasets of high diversity and towards 1 in datasets of low diversity [26]. 2.4.2 Quantitative PCR Analyses of the 16S rRNA gene by qPCR were performed with the TaqMan system as described previously [27], with 0.5 μL each of primers BAC338F (0.1 μM), BAC805R (0.25 μM) and labeled fluorescent TaqMan Tamra probe BAC516F (0.05 μM) in 20 μL final volume per reaction. Two-step amplification of target DNA was performed by 40 cycles of 7 s at 95°C and 25 s at 60°C after the enzyme activation step (2 min at 98°C). 2.4.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) A fermentation test was operated and hollow fibers were sampled and analyzed by SEM as described previously [12]."
6,Results and discussion,"In this work, we sought to enhance the efficiency of a novel H2 producing L/G MBR process [11,12]. One-time initial seeding with thermally-treated Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) sludge was followed by long-term operation without re-inoculation. Different strategies of gas extraction were evaluated, and several combinations of HRT and OLR to determine an optimum in H2 production performances were tested."
7,H2 production without initial seeding of the membrane module,"3.1 H2 production without initial seeding of the membrane module A first 4-day long test was performed with initial seeding of the membrane module with thermally treated WWTP anaerobic sludge (0 day), followed by other tests performed without reseeding, which were started 365, 418 and 432 days thereafter, respectively (Fig. 3 ). Efficiency of H2 productions were compared (Table 1 ) and analyzed as a function of produced metabolites and bacterial composition profiles. 3.1.1 Hydrogen production In all tests, a brief lag phase (<6h) was followed by an exponential increase of HPR up to a maximum of 2.5–3.0 mL-H2/L-medium/min at 13–25 h. Then, a pseudo-stable state was reached as HPR stabilized at 1.6–2.3 mL-H2/L-medium/min (Fig. 3a), during which HPR of all three tests operated more than a year after seeding the membrane module remained close (≈1.7 mL-H2/L-medium/min) and slightly lower than HPR of the seeding test. The pseudo-stable state was maintained, with some pH variations (4.8–5.5, Fig. 3b). Average HY and HPR (Table 1) of the three tests performed after a year without reseeding the membrane module were consistent (0.97 ± 0.09 mol-H2/mol-glucose added, 106.5 ± 10.6 mL-H2/L-medium/h), despite an 8-month complete interruption in bioreactor operation. The hydrogen yield observed, lower than the in vivo theoretical maximal yield of 4 mol-H2/mol-glucose, could be explained by different phenomenon described previously [28]: (i) occurrence of the butyrate pathway, lowering the maximal HY that could be reached (2 mol-H2/mol-glucose), (ii) presence of hydrogen consuming bacteria (suspected due to the production of propionate) and (iii) presence of other bacteria consuming the substrate without coproducing hydrogen (production of acetate by homoacetogenesis, ethanol or lactate). Therefore, robust continuous hydrogen production by dark fermentation in the L/G MBR was demonstrated, despite several bioreactor drainings and no HPB reseeding during the start-up phase. Such an operating mode had previously been tested in a trickling biofilter bioreactor inoculated with a pure culture of Clostridium butyricum [29] with successful restoration of bioreactor performances after draining. However, contamination of the pure culture was observed, an issue no longer relevant in our process strategy which implements a mixed culture. In our study, the development of a thin bacterial layer was observed on hollow fibers by SEM (Fig. 4 ). This bacterial community might have stayed active during fermentation and after draining and rinsing the membrane module, thus serving as a bacterial reservoir. H2 production performances of the L/G MBR were compared with those from previous reports (Table 2 ). Under close feeding conditions, HY and HPR of the L/G MBR were close to those obtained by Lee et al. [30] but lower than those of Shen et al. [23] which used a S/L MBR aiming to concentrate the bacterial biomass. Highest HPRs (>750 mL/L/h) were obtained as expected in studies using higher OLRs (5 g-glucose/L-medium/h) than in our study (0.8 g-glucose/L-medium/h) [5,31]. The MBR described in Noblecourt et al. [31] operated close to semi-batch conditions and was therefore not directly comparable to our continuous process. Remarkably, high values obtained in the study of Park et al. [5] using liquid/liquid separation to remove organic acids from the medium suggests that performances might be improved by increasing OLR. Worthy of note and in contrast to previously reported studies with S/L MBR, membrane fouling was not an issue with our L/G MBR, and additional cleaning of the membrane was not required; this allows to reduce the operational cost of the process [32]. In an industrial production scenario, the scale up of the L/G MBR process can benefit from the flexibility associated with the use of hollow fiber membrane modules, as previously documented for other processes [33]. Indeed, the size of the L/G MBR unit at pilot scale can be defined according to the flow of gas extracted, and multiple small-size modules can be implemented in parallel or in series, thus minimizing the HY loss due to the use of a single bigger unit. Also, in order to maximize substrate consumption, L/G MBR units can be added in series according to the quantity of biomass to be treated over a defined period of time. Compared to reference CSTR processes, an additional cost item would be the initial investment in membrane modules, which would depend on the number of membrane modules required [33]. Then, the other process costs would be the same: chemical inputs (e. g. sodium hydroxide) to compensate pH variations over time due to the coproduction of organic acids, electrical consumption to pump the liquid into the system and to regulate the temperature in the membrane modules. 3.1.2 Production of soluble metabolites Glucose conversion was almost complete and metabolite distribution profiles (Fig. 5 ) were close in all tests. Acetate (0.8–1.6 mmol/L/h), butyrate (1.1–2.2 mmol/L/h) and ethanol (0.8–1.3 mmol/L/h) were the main compounds produced as expected, due to their association with H2 production, in acetate-butyrate and acetate-ethanol metabolic pathways [34]. Low levels of formate (<0.5 mmol/L/h) were occasionally observed and represent as yet unexploited potential source of H2, as formate can be further transformed to H2 and CO2 [28]. Other metabolites unrelated to H2 production (isovalerate, lactate, propionate, succinate) were found in low quantities (<0.1 mmol/L/h). Ethanol productivity decreased over time (Fig. 5), and the butyrate/acetate (B/A) molar ratio tended to increase (from 1.1 (365 days) to 2.0 (432 days)), suggesting a metabolic shift from acetate-ethanol to acetate-butyrate metabolism [35]. The observed high production of acetate may explain the low average HY (0.97 ± 0.09 mol/mol), due to homoacetogenesis, thereby consuming potential H2 [36]. 3.1.3 Bacterial community composition Bacterial compositions of the L/G MBR liquid outlets of the test performed after seeding the membrane module with heat-treated activated sludge and the test performed 418 days after the initial seeding were compared (Fig. 6 ). In both cases, samples of the liquid outlet were collected at 68 h of fermentation (i.e. during the pseudo-stable state) operation. Total bacterial diversity was lower in the experiment performed without microbial reseeding (Simpson index of 0.20 at 418 days, compared to 0.03 at 0 day). In both experiments, Firmicutes (mostly genera Clostridium, Ethanoligenens and Sporolactobacillus) predominated in the liquid outlet, especially in the experiment after 418 days without reseeding (81% of total genus-level taxa, compared to 55% in the 0-day experiment, Fig. 6). The phylum Proteobacteria was slightly more abundant without initial reseeding (19% against 12%, mainly including the hydrogen producing genus Enterobacter. Clostridium was the most abundant genus (21% and 50% for the 0 day- and 418 days-experiments, respectively). In the 418 days-experiment, initially minor or undetected Ethanoligenens (24%), Enterobacter (19%) and Ruminococcus (3%) appeared at significant levels. The higher bacterial diversity observed in the experiment following the initial microbial seeding suggests that a lot of bacteria from the WWTP sludge used as inoculum were still present after thermal treatment and 68 h of bioreactor operation. After repeated draining and rinsing of the L/G MBR, selective pressure from storage and operating conditions of the bioreactor led to the decrease in bacterial diversity reported. We hypothesize that living and active bacteria remained attached to hollow fibers after each process stop, including well-known HPB such as strict (Clostridium, Ethanoligenens) and facultative (Enterobacter) anaerobes. Indeed, the taxa detected were linked to different roles in H2 production [28,37]: as major H2 producers (Clostridium, Enterobacter, Ethanoligenens), in improving H2 production via microbial granule formation (Ethanoligenens [38,39] and Clostridium [40,41]), in maintaining an anaerobic environment by O2 scavenging (Enterobacter [42]), and in increasing H2 production by digestion of complex substrates (Ruminococcus, [43,44]). Notably, the association of Clostridium with Enterobacter was observed repeatedly in past studies of biohydrogen production [45-47]. Only one genus-level taxon described to have a negative impact on H2 production (Sporolactobacillus) was abundant in both samples and was significantly present in the initial test only. Sporolactobacillus is known to produce bacteriocins affecting HPB [48], which could contribute to explain the relatively low HPR at the beginning of this test (Fig. 3), despite otherwise good performances during the pseudo-stable state phase. Thus, without reseeding of the L/G MBR, the selection over time of a robust and resilient functional with regard to H2 production ecosystem was favored, in non-sterile conditions. An efficient start-up strategy of a L/G MBR dark fermentation process was thereby successfully implemented."
8,"Effect of sweeping gas (N2, CO2) and gas free extraction on biohydrogen extraction","3.2 Effect of sweeping gas (N2, CO2) and gas free extraction on biohydrogen extraction In order to improve the L/G MBR process, different approaches for gas extraction were also evaluated. The L/G MBR was operated with either N2 or CO2 as a sweeping gas circulating in the lumen of the hollow fibers. The latter was considered as a potential approach to recycle produced CO2 as sweeping gas to avoid H2 dilution by N2 [10]. Moreover, the L/G MBR was operated without sweeping gas (no sweeping gas (NSG)) to produce biogas (H2 and CO2) without any dilution. In this series of experiments, HRT and OLR were set at 13 h and 0.8 g-glucose/L-medium/h respectively. 3.2.1 Gas production Globally, the extraction strategy impacted H2 production (Table 3 ), while glucose conversion was similar and high (>97%) in all cases. The largest difference in HPR concerned lag time before hydrogen production, which was longer when the L/G MBR was operated without sweeping gas. We suppose that H2 production started earlier than the lag phase measured, but was analyzed only when a sufficient transmembrane pressure was reached for the biogas to be transferred towards the lumen of the hollow fibers. However, in NSG conditions, lag time decreased with the number of experiments performed, possibly thanks to an increase of the wetting of membrane pores, resulting in a lowered transmembrane pressure threshold for the biogas transfer to happen. HY, HPR and H2/CO2 ratio were often significantly higher without sweeping gas than with N2 sweeping, whereas sweeping with N2 yielded slightly higher HY and HPR in the pseudo-stable state than sweeping with CO2. These results markedly differ from previous reports of dark fermentation in bioreactors with other configurations. For example, HY increased by 88% and HPR 2.6-fold in a semibatch bioreactor swept with N2 [17], and HY was improved by 23% in a CSTR with N2 sweeping [15]. The difference observed can readily be explained by the fact that in these alternative bioreactor configurations, the sweeping gas bubbled through the liquid culture medium, whereas it circulated in the lumen of the hollow fibers in our L/G MBR configuration with controlled contact with the reactive liquid phase. Thus, the intensification of the process with an in situ L/G membrane separation in our design was a substitute for a sweeping gas. Notably, no apparent resistance to mass transfer was associated with our bioreactor configuration in steady state. Produced gases were therefore efficiently extracted without dilution by a sweeping gas, while preserving both HY and HPR. In this operating mode, HPR was always equal to or higher than CO2 production rate, unlike when N2 sweeping was used (Table 3). 3.2.2 Production of soluble metabolites Metabolite production was compared in the pseudo-stable state phase (Fig. 7 ) for three experiments performed either with N2 sweeping (432 d), CO2 sweeping (439 d) or no sweeping gas (551 d). Total metabolite productivities were similar (4.1 ± 0.4 mmol/L/h), but slightly higher with N2 sweeping (4.5 mmol/L/h), and lower with CO2 sweeping (3.7 mmol/L/h), as a smaller HPR was also observed for the latter (Table 3). Distribution of soluble metabolites was also similar under all conditions, the main metabolites being butyrate (~50%), acetate (~30%) and ethanol (~8%). Ethanol production was quite absent without sweeping gas. Other analyzed metabolites (butanol, propanol, succinate, propionate, lactate, isovalerate and formate) were produced at lower levels (<0.1 mmol/L/h). 3.2.3 Bacterial community composition Samples of the liquid outlet of the three tests were collected at 68 h operation. Simpson diversity index was similar without gas sweeping (0.38) and with CO2 sweeping (0.42), and higher than when N2 sweeping was used (0.20). Thus, N2 sweeping was associated with higher bacterial diversity within the membrane module. Clostridium, Enterobacter and Ethanoligenens, well-known HPB, were the major genus-level taxa identified (Fig. 8 a), and irrespectively of gas extraction mode (91% to 96%). Strikingly, Clostridium beijerinckii was dominant (>57%) in the liquid outlet of the tests without gas sweeping and with CO2 sweeping, and much less abundant with N2 as sweeping gas (14%) (Fig. 8b). Conversely, Clostridium pasteurianum was much twice abundant with N2 (28%) than without gas sweeping (14%), and was almost absent with CO2 sweeping (0.4%). Similarly, Ethanoligenens harbinense was abundant with N2 sweeping (24%) and almost absent without gas sweeping or with CO2 (<2%). Finally, Enterobacter sp. was abundant with CO2 (26.1%) and less so with N2 or without sweeping (19% and 16% respectively), possibly explaining the observed slightly lower HPR and total metabolite production by using CO2 as sweeping gas. Thus, bacterial diversity differed more between the different extraction approaches that were tested than the very similar distribution of produced metabolites (Fig. 7) would suggest. Moreover, bioreactor operation without sweeping gas favored the development of HPB Clostridium beijerinckii (57%), Clostridium pasteurianum (14%) and Enterobacter sp. (16%) while limiting the diversity of secondary taxa. The slightly lower HPR obtained with CO2 sweeping could be related to the absence of Clostridium pasteurianum and a higher abundance of Enterobacter sp.. Without sweeping gas, bioreactor operation was thereby oriented towards H2 production, with slightly better HPR and low production in ethanol and in secondary metabolites. The L/G MBR design, substituting to other gas extraction strategies such as a sweeping gas which implies an additional dilution of the biogas, is therefore a valuable approach to facilitate subsequent gas purification."
9,Optimization of OLR and HRT,"3.3 Optimization of OLR and HRT Glucose was almost to fully converted in our dark fermentation experiments, suggesting that HRT and OLR could be optimized in order to enhance HPR. In several previous studies of HRT impact, the experimental conditions applied resulted in simultaneously increasing the OLR and lowering the HRT, as the concentration of the feed solution was not modified [49-52]. Furthermore, this usually resulted in HY decrease due to inhibition of hydrogen-producing pathways [50]. Our objective in this study was (i) to determine the impact of HRT independently of the OLR and vice versa, (ii) to specify the operating limits of the L/G MBR configuration (decrease the HRT and find the optimal OLR for different HRT) and finally (iii) to follow the effects of the variation of HRT and OLR on the metabolism and the microbiology of the reaction medium. To do so, experiments were conducted between 538 and 733 days after seeding the L/G MBR, keeping constant either HRT (2–14 h) or OLR (0.6–2.1 g-glucose/L-medium/h) by adjusting the feed concentration in the latter case. 3.3.1 Hydrogen production Firstly, the L/G MBR was operated within a HRT range between 2 and 10 h at a constant OLR of 1.4 g-glucose/L-medium/h (Table 4 ). Remarkably, no HPB washout occurred even when a HRT of 2 h was applied (Fig. 9 ), even though the reactive medium was renewed>26 times after having reached the steady state without any HPR drop. This result differs with what was reported in a previous S/L MBR study [5], where a higher flow rate was applied. However, it might be due to the difference of configuration and volume of bioreactors (5.5 L compared to 0.5 L in our study) and a higher flow rate possibly leading to biofilm removal [5]. In addition, glucose conversion remained high (91%) in our study under these conditions (HRT = 2 h), while glucose conversion was previously reported to drop from 90% to 78% when HRT was lowered from 8 h (OLR = 1.3 g-glucose/L-medium/h) to 6 h (OLR = 1.7 g-glucose/L-medium/h) in a CSTR [49]. Overall, HPR ranged between 66.5 and 253.7 mL/L/h (Table 4). HPR increased for higher OLR values, for each series of HRT values (Fig. 10 a). Maximal HPR was obtained for a HRT of 8 h and an OLR of 2.1 g-glucose/L-medium/h. However, this did not correspond to maximal HY (1.16 mol/mol), which was obtained with a lower OLR (1.4 g-glucose/L-medium/h) and the same HRT (Table 4). A double optimum in terms of HPR and HY was also reported previously [50], with maximal HPR of 187 mL/L/h for a HRT of 6 h (OLR = 2.5 g-glucose/L-medium/h) and HY of 1.62 mol/mol-glucose added for a HRT of 18 h (OLR = 1.2 g-glucose/L-medium/h). HY ranged between 0.60 and 1.16 mol-H2/mol-added glucose (Table 4). Experimental data of HY related to glucose concentration in the feed (mol-H2/mol-glucose consumed) were interpolated with a second order equation (Fig. 10b). Best-fit parameters predicted an optimal glucose concentration of 13.1 g/L for a maximal HY (1.22 mol/mol) in close agreement to the experimentally observed optimal HY obtained by combining a HRT of 8–10 h and an OLR of 1.4 g-glucose/L-medium/h. In contrast, the lowest HY (with minimal glucose conversion, 78.1%) was obtained for an OLR of 1.7 g-glucose/L-medium/h and a HRT of 14 h, i.e. at the maximal glucose concentration that was tested (23.8 g/L). Notably, HY was 1.5-fold superior with a slightly higher OLR (2.1 g-glucose/L-medium/h) and 2-fold lower HRT (8 h), i.e. corresponding to a glucose concentration of 16.8 g/L closer to the optimal glucose concentration, at equivalent glucose conversion (78.4%). Both HY (1,13–1,16 mol-H2/mol-glucose) and HPR (210–225 mL/L/h) of the optimized L/G MBR process (TSH = 8–10 h, OLR = 1.4 g/L/h) compared to the performances obtained in a CSTR study realized under similar operating conditions. For instance, using glucose as a substrate, Kumar et al. [50] obtained a HPR of 139 mL/L/h and a yield of 0.67 mol/mol applying a HRT of 9 h and an OLR of 1.67 g/ L/h. Globally, glucose conversion in our experiments varied between 78.1% and 100% (Table 4). There seemed to be a limit of the amount of substrate that could be converted into hydrogen by the HPB in the L/G MBR since HY dropped when the glucose concentration was increased. Indeed, when the HRT was increased from 2 to 8 h and the OLR from 0.6 to 1.4 g-glucose/L-medium/h (with glucose concentrations of the feed solution remaining inferior to 13 g/L), glucose conversion was higher than 92%. On the other hand, glucose conversion was below 82% when the HRT was set to longer times, i.e. between 8 and 14 h, and OLR between 1.4 and 2.1 g-glucose/L-medium/h (glucose concentration of the feed solution superior to 13 g/L). Thus, it seems that the lowest limit of operation of the L/G MBR was not reached in terms of glucose conversion to hydrogen. Therefore, it would potentially be possible to further lower the HRT while increasing the OLR to enhance the HPR while maintaining the HY. This mode of operation might result in an increase of HPR, as observed previously [6], while avoiding issues of membrane fouling at high OLR, as reported e.g. with a S/L MBR [53]. In a majority of our tests, the H2/CO2 ratio did not vary much (from 0.87 to 1.09). When the HRT was increased, the H2/CO2 ratio decreased (Table 4). Indeed, for the lowest HRT tested (2 h) with an OLR of 1.4 g-glucose/L-medium/h, the H2/CO2 ratio was 35% higher than the average value of all experiments. This might be explained by the larger NaOH amendment to maintain pH under this condition, as CO2 transfer is enhanced when OH– increases in the medium ( C O 2 g + O H - ↔ C O 2 l i q + O H - ↔ H C O 3 - ) [54]. Moreover, in order to reduce the HRT, the liquid flow rate was increased. As a result, a higher content of dissolved CO2 was evacuated via the liquid outlet, thus reducing the proportion of gaseous CO2 in the lumen of the fibers, which resulted in an increase of the measured H2/CO2 ratio. 3.3.2 Production of soluble metabolites Butyrate and acetate were the dominant metabolites under all tested conditions (Fig. 11 a). Formate, lactate, succinate and ethanol were also produced in smaller quantities. In the experiments generating the highest HY (HRT = 8–10 h and OLR = 1.4 g/L/h) with a high HPR, high butyrate productivity (>50 mol% of all metabolites produced) was observed. At this OLR (1.4 g/L/h), both HY and HPR increased with HRT (Table 4), while metabolites productivities and distributions remained close, except for a rise in butyrate production at 10 h HRT and production of acetate at 5 h HRT (Fig. 11a). It might be possible that improved H2 extraction at high HRT limited acetate production by homoacetogenesis. For an equivalent HRT (8 h), the total quantity of metabolites produced (mainly acetate and butyrate) was directly proportional to the OLR (Fig. 11b) and therefore to the concentration of glucose in the liquid medium. The butyrate/acetate molar ratio varied between 1.5 and 2.5 and increased with the ORL whatever the HRT (Fig. 11c). 3.3.3 Bacterial community composition Samples were collected at the liquid outlet after 68 h dark fermentation for the following five HRT and OLR combinations: 2 h and 1.4 g/L/h, 8 h and 1.0 g/L/h, 8 h and 1.4 g/L/h, 8 h and 2.1 g/L/h, 14 h and 0.8 g/L/h. Samples were analyzed by sequencing of PCR amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and by qPCR. Simpson index was similar for all samples, suggesting similar bacterial diversity for all conditions. Independently of HRT, a positive correlation (R2 = 0.90) was found between OLR and 16S rRNA gene copy number used as a proxy of bacterial biomass (Fig. 12 a). Thus, bacterial density increased when the higher OLR were applied. Therefore, further increasing the OLR, thus the bacterial concentration in the liquid medium and potentially HPB, might be a potential solution to enhance HPR. There was no correlation between the HRT and the concentration of bacteria of the liquid medium. The abundance of Clostridium pasteurianum increased when the glucose concentration was augmented, unlike that of Clostridium beijerinckii, which was more abundant at low glucose concentration (Fig. 12b) with linear regression coefficient of R2 = 0.98 and R2 = 0.94, respectively for Clostridium pasteurianum and Clostridium beijerinckii (HRT = 14 h OLR = 0.8 g/L excluded). Clostridium, Ethanoligenens and Enterobacter were the major genera detected in all experiments (Fig. 13 a). Notably, Lactococcus, which is not a HPB, developed at both minimal and maximal glucose concentrations (2.8 and 16.8 g/L) showing a derive in bacterial growth (less oriented toward H2 producers) for glucose concentration away of the optimum (13.1 g/L) previously determined.Indeed, the modeled optimal HY seemed highly correlated with a maximal abundance of HPB in the liquid outlet (Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium carbodixivorans, Ethanoligenens harbinense and Enterobacter sp., Fig. 10b). The maximal HPR was obtained at the highest OLR applied (2.1 g/L/h), which corresponded to a glucose concentration of 16.8 g/L in the field (slightly higher than the glucose concentration for optimal HY), despite a drop in glucose consumption (78.4%). In this condition, Clostridium pasteurianum (58%) and Enterobacter sp. (13%) were the main detected HPB (Fig. 13b). Analysis of bacterial composition evidenced that such optimal conditions favored development of Clostridium pasteurianum (74.8% of analyzed sequences), representing>4.5.107 16S rDNA copies in the liquid outlet of the L/G MBR (Fig. 12b, Fig. 13b). We hypothesize that this taxon was responsible for the favorable HY and HPR obtained in the range of 11.2 to 16.8 g/L glucose. Conversely, at low glucose concentrations (2.8 g/L), lower HY (-25% of the optimal HY) was obtained. Clostridium pasteurianum was less abundant in this condition (1.1%), at the benefit of Clostridium beijerinckii and the non-HPB Lactococcus sp. (Fig. 13b) going with the lower hydrogen performances observed. At a HRT of 2 h, significantly higher production of bacterial biofilm and granules were observed (data not shown). Future experiments with a low HRT for a longer operating time and a higher OLR could determine whether HPB taxa would be favored under these conditions."
10,Conclusions,"An innovative L/G MBR configuration for H2 production by dark fermentation, using a hollow fiber membrane module, was successfully implemented and its operation strategy was improved on several aspects. The intensification of the hydrogen production process in this bioreactor is twofold: in situ hydrogen extraction and immobilization of a hydrogen-producing biofilm, serving as a bacterial reservoir during the process in operation and shutdown phases. Indeed, after seeding with anoxic thermally treated WWTP activated sludge, the L/G MBR was repeatedly operated over a year under similar conditions (HRT = 12 h and OLR = 0.8 g/L/h), and without further bacterial reseeding. Despite repeated draining and rinsing, consistent HY of 0.97 ± 0.09 mol-H2/mol-glucose added, and HPR of 106.5 ± 10.6 mL-H2/L-medium/h, were reached. Acetate, butyrate and ethanol were the main metabolites produced. The diversity of the bacterial community of the liquid outlet was lower during the operation of the L/G MBR without reseeding compared to its operation right after the WWTP seeding stage. Moreover, it was mainly composed of HPB. Reseeding was successfully suppressed, thus greatly simplifying the L/G MBR process operation for subsequent H2 production. Several biogas extraction strategies were tested with sweeping gas (N2 or CO2) circulating in the lumen of the fibers or without sweeping gas. In the last situation, metabolism and bacterial development were oriented towards H2 production, and a slightly better HPR (128.1 ± 27.4 mL-H2/L-medium/h) was reached. Therefore, gas purification from the mixture of H2 and CO2 gases produced was greatly facilitated in the L/G MBR configuration since sweeping gas diluting the biogas produced was no longer required. Unlike most of the continuous dark fermentative studies reported in the literature, we aimed to decouple the effect of the hydraulic residence time of the substrate (HRT) from that of the substrate feed rate (OLR) to describe the impact of these two key parameters. Thus, a range of HRT (2–14 h) were tested for the same OLR (1.4 g/L/h), and conversely, several OLR (1.0–2.1 g/L/h) were tested for the same HRT (8 h). Increasing OLR enhanced the HPR, but was detrimental to the HY at a glucose feed concentration above 13.1 g/L. An optimal hydrogen yield of 1.22 mol/mol-glucose added for a glucose concentration in the feed of 13.1 g/L was predicted by modelling of the experimental data, which was close to the experimentally determined optimum at experimental HRTs of 8–10 h combined with an OLR of 1.4 g/L/h. Under these conditions, the development of hydrogen-producing bacteria (Clostridium, Enterobacter and Ethanoligenens) was enhanced. Clostridium beijerinckii developed preferentially at low glucose concentration and HRT without washout, while Clostridium pasteurianum dominated when higher glucose concentration and HRT were used. Thus, the development of hydrogen-producing bacteria in the L/G MBR was successfully controlled by the relevant choice of operational conditions to apply. To sum up, the original hollow fiber L/G MBR configuration enabled the testing and selection of fermentation strategies that greatly simplified the implementation of the dark fermentation process by addressing its key operational bottlenecks. Indeed, the L/G membrane surface served as a support and reservoir for the hydrogen producing bacteria. At the same time, in situ extraction without any apparent resistance to the gas transfer was enabled."
