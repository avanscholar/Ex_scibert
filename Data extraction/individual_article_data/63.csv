0,Introduction,"Biomass, as a renewable carbon resource, has attracted much attention in recent years as feedstock [1,2] for production of the fine chemicals such as levulinic acid (LA) [3,4]. LA has been recognized as a platform chemical to prepare other varied types of fine chemicals [5–7]. This is due to the two tunable functional groups, carbonyl group and carboxylic acid group in LA [8,9], which could be transformed via i.e. hydrogenation coupled with acid catalysis to produce other value-added compounds, such as γ-valerolactone [10,11] (GVL), levulinic esters [12], 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PeD) [13], β-amino levulinic acid [14], α-angelicalactone [15], acrylic acid [16,17]. Among these chemicals, the production of GVL has received much interest [18] as GVL has low toxicity, high boiling point (207°C), high flash point (96°C) and low vapor pressure (3.5 kPa at 80°C) [19]. It can be used for production of food additives, green solvents and cosmetics [20,21]. Generally, there are two routes for the synthesis of GVL from LA. One is the reduction of the carbonyl group of LA to produce an intermediate, 4-hydroxyvaleric acid (4-HVA), and subsequent lactonization of 4-HVA to form GVL [10], as shown in Scheme 1 . Ethyl levulinate (EL), the product from esterification of LA with ethanol [22], could also be used as an alternative starting feedstock for production of 4-HVA and further to GVL and 1,4-PeD. The other is the dehydration of LA to angelica lactone, the further hydrogenation of the CC double bond of which forms GVL [23]. Both routes involve the hydrogenation and the acid or base catalysis. In addition, with presence of the catalytic sites such as hydrogenation and base sites, GVL could be further converted via the opening of the furan ring to form the diols such as 1,4-PeD that is also a value-added chemicals for the production of biodegradable polymers and other chemicals such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran [24,25]. The selectivity of GVL and 1,4-PeD depends on the relative abundance of the hydrogenation sites, acid/base sites of the catalysts. Both noble-metals and transition metals could be used as the hydrogenation sites for catalyzing the hydrogenation of carbonyl functionality in LA or EL [26–28]. However, the noble metal-based catalysts have a high cost, which limits their industrial application [20,29]. In contrast, the transition metal such as Cu-based catalyst with low manufacturing cost also shows reasonable catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of C=O, which has been widely used in the hydrogenation of the organics with carbonyl functionalities such as ethyl levulinate (EL), 1,3-butadiene and dimethyl oxalate [30–32]. Since Cu has a low thermal stability, it is generally dispersed on a porous support [33–35]. The support of Cu catalyst could have varied abundance of acidic sites or basic sites, which has proved to affect the conversion of the reactants and the selectivities of the products [36]. Thus, tailoring the relative abundance of hydrogenation sites and acidic/basic sites is an important strategy to regulate selectivity of the targeting products [37]. Since both GVL and 1,4-PeD are the fine chemicals with added value, it would be of importance for developing the catalyst with the tunable active sites for production of either GVL or 1,4-PeD or both with the controllable flexibility. In this study, CuMg catalysts with the tunable hydrogenation sites and basic sites were developed for the selective conversion of EL, the ester of LA, to GVL or 1,4-PeD via adjusting the relative abundance of hydrogenation sites and basic sites by changing Mg/Cu molar ratio. Our results indicated that the yield of GVL and 1,4-PeD depended on the availabilities and the balance distribution of the hydrogenation sites and the basic sites, respectively. Besides, the reaction medium not only significantly impacted the production of 1,4-PeD for their varied hydrogen solubility, but also drastically altered the migration and aggravation behaviors of metallic copper species in CuMg catalysts."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Cu(NO3)2•3H2O, Mg(NO3)2•6H2O, NaOH, Na2CO3, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and diethyl ether were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. EL and isopropanol was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. The regents used in this paper were of analytical grade and used directly without further pretreatment."
3,Catalysts synthesis,"2.2 Catalysts synthesis The copper-based catalysts were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. Five catalysts were obtained by adjusting Cu/Mg molar ratio at 0.2: 1, 0.4: 1, 0.8: 1, 1.6: 1 and 3.2: 1, which were defined as Cu0.2Mg, Cu0.4Mg, Cu0.8Mg, Cu1.6Mg and Cu3.2Mg, respectively. The variation of the molar ratio of Cu and Mg was based on the consideration to change the relative abundance of the hydrogenation sites and the basic sites in the catalysts. Typically, two nitrates, Cu(NO3)2•3H2O and Mg(NO3)2•6H2O, were dissolved in water to form a mixed solution, and NaOH (4.0 mol L−1) solution was used as the precipitation agent. For the preparation of the catalysts, the nitrate solutions were slowly dripped into Na2CO3 (0.1 mol L−1) solution at 40°C to form the precipitant. During the process, the pH value was maintained at ca. 10. After the completion of the precipitation, the temperature was raised to 65°C and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min for crystallization, which was then transferred to an oven at 65°C for 24 h to age. The obtained precipitant was washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral. After the washing, the precipitant was further dried at 100°C overnight, and then the dried samples were ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace at 400°C for 4 h. The calcined samples were reduced at 300°C for 2 h in a mixture of hydrogen/nitrogen (H2: 60 mL/min; N2: 60 mL/min) before the catalytic experiment."
4,Catalysts characterization,"2.3 Catalysts characterization The Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD) with Cu target (Kα-radiation source, λ = 1.5406 Å) was used to analyze the phase structure of copper-based catalysts. The scope of scanning range was from 5 to 80° with a scanning rate of 20°/min. The particle size was calculated by using Debye-Scherrer equation. The surface area, pore volume and pore size of the calcined catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K with a Biaode SSA-6000 instrument, and calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Before the analysis, the samples were degassed at 120°C for 2 h to remove the physically adsorbed water and other adsorbents. The distribution of basic sites in the copper-based catalysts was obtained by temperature programmed desorption with CO2 as the probing molecule (CO2-TPD). Before the CO2 adsorption, the sample (about 100 mg) was degassed at 120°C for 30 min in a helium atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 mL/min to remove the physically adsorbed components. After the pretreatment, the samples were cooled to 50°C, and then CO2 was introduced for further adsorption for 1 h. Next, helium with a flow rate of 20 mL/min was introduced for 30 min to remove the CO2 that was physically adsorbed on the surface of catalyst. Finally, the samples were heated from 50 to 800°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min in helium gas with a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A BIAODE PCA-120 instrument was used to perform temperature programmed reduction in hydrogen (H2-TPR) to characterize the reduction behaviors of copper oxides in the catalysts. Firstly, 20 mg of catalysts was pretreated in a constant Ar flow (20 mL/min) at 120°C for 1 h, and then was cooled to room temperature. Next, the catalysts were heated to 600°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min and in the meantime 5% H2/Ar mixed gas with a flow rate of 40 mL/min was introduced to perform the characterization by using Vodo vdSorb 91x. The signals of hydrogen consumption were recorded by a TCD, and the reduction degree can also be calculated with the external standard method for the reduction of a certain amount of pure CuO. In order to characterize the distribution and surface area of Cu species, N2O chemisorption and H2-TPR reverse titration was conducted. Generally, 30 mg of samples was pretreated at 120°C for 1 h in an Ar flow, and then a 5% H2/Ar flow (40 mL/min) was introduced for the reaction. The sample was heated from room temperature to 300°C and maintained for1 h and the consumed hydrogen was denoted as A. Ar gas with a flow rate of 40 mL/min was then used to flush the samples for 30 min. After cooling to 60°C, N2O gas (40 mL/min) was introduced to oxidize the surface Cu species to Cu2O with the duration time of 1 h. Next, the samples were heated from 60 to 300°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min and H2/Ar mixed gas was introduced simultaneously to reduce the surface Cu2O of catalysts to Cu. By subtracting the sum of remaining unsaturated hydrogen pulses from the total hydrogen injection volume to obtain the consumed hydrogen and denoted as B. Cu dispersion (DCu) was calculated by using the below equation: D ( % ) = 2 × B A × 100 . The morphology of catalysts was observed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with JEOL 2010plus. Before starting the test, a small amount of samples were dispersed into ethanol solution. Then a small amount of sample was added on the copper mesh for further test. In addition, in order to obtain the elemental compositions of fresh copper-based catalysts, scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry (FEI QUANTA FEG 250) was carried out."
5,Catalytic experiment,"2.4 Catalytic experiment An autoclave with a volume of 10 mL was used as the reactor to perform the catalytic experiments. The reactant, catalyst and solvent (about 4 g) were mixed at room temperature and added into reactor vessel. In order to remove the residual air in the reactor, H2 was introduced to purge the reactor for three times and then the reactor was pressurized with H2 to a certain value that will be specified in the text. After that, the reactor was heated from room temperature to the specific reaction temperature with a stirring rate of 500 rpm. After reaching the desired reaction temperature, the reactor was maintained at the setting temperature for specific reaction time for the reaction to take place. After finishing the reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature and then the liquid product was centrifuged to separate the used catalysts. The liquid products were collected for further analysis and the used catalysts were washed with ethanol for several times and dried for further recycling tests or characterizations."
6,Analysis of the liquid products,"2.5 Analysis of the liquid products The liquid products were identified by a gas chromatography coupling with a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu GC−MS−QP 2020) with WAX column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of internal diameter, 0.25 nm of film thickness). For the analysis, the liquid products were diluted to about ca. 2 wt% using acetone as a diluent solvent, and then the mixed liquid (about 0.5 µL) was injected into injection tube with a split ratio of 50: 1. During the process of testing, the initial temperature of column was maintained at 50°C for 3 min and then the temperature was increased to 250°C with a ramping rate of 20 °C/min and held at 250°C for 10 min under helium atmosphere. The targeting products were identified through a standard library database named National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2014). The yield of the products and the conversion of EL were calculated by using the equations below: (1) Yield ( % ) = Mole of pro duct prod uced Mole of reac tant load ed × 100 % (2) Conv ersi on ( % ) = Mole of reactant conv erted Mole of reac tant load ed × 100 % Besides, when GVL was used as the reactant and the conversion was controlled low, the turn over frequency (TOF) of the conversion of GVL and the production of 1,4-PeD was obtained shown in Fig. S1. The TOF value reflected the number of converted reactants per active site in unit time with the equation shown below: (3) TOF ( h − 1 ) = Mole of reactant conv erted Mole of metal Cu on the surf ace of cata lyst × reac tion time"
7,Results and discussion,
8,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 XRD The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the precursors of the copper-based catalysts, and the catalysts after calcination, reduction and the use in the recycle tests were displayed in Fig. 1 . For the precursors of the catalyst with the spectrum shown in Fig. 1a, the Cu(OH)2 phase with diffraction peaks at 2θ = 16.7°, 23.8°, 34.1°, 35.9°, 39.8° and 53.4°, which were respectively assigned to (020), (021), (002), (111), (130) and (132) crystal planes (JCPDS 80-0656), were observed. The twisted octahedral structure Cu(OH)2 was the main form when the molar ratio of Cu2+/Mg2+ in the catalyst formulation was higher than 1. However, when the Cu2+/Mg2+ molar ratio was lower than 1, the hydrotalcite phase (JCPDS 35-0965) was formed, as evidenced by the spectra in Fig. 1a. After the calcination at 400°C, the hydroxides were transformed into oxides. The crystal structures of Cu(OH)2 and hydrotalcite disappeared and instead MgO and CuO became the major phases (Fig. 1b). When the copper content was low, MgO phase was the major one as CuO species were highly dispersed. With the increase of Cu content, the diffraction peaks (2θ = 35.7° and 38.9° (JCPDS 74-1021) related to CuO was intensified, while the characteristic diffraction peaks of MgO became much milder as the relative content of MgO decreased. The crystal phase of metallic Cu species was observed in catalysts with high copper content while MgO phase was observed in catalysts with low copper content, as shown in Fig. 1c. The diffraction peaks at 2θ= 43.3°, 50.4° and 74.1° were respectively assigned to (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of metallic Cu (JCPD 85-1326) and the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.8°, 42.9° and 78.5° were belonged to (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of MgO (JCPDS 74-1225). Magnesium species was still detected in the form of MgO, as it was difficult to be reduced. With the increasing molar ratio of Cu/Mg, the phase of metallic Cu was more intensified. The copper particle sizes were calculated and the result was shown in Table 1 . The increase of the content of Cu remarkably increased the particle sizes. The aggregation of the metallic Cu species took place during the reduction process. The dispersion of Cu species in the support is also related to the pore structures of the catalyst, which was further characterized with N2 adsorption/desorption method. 3.1.2 N2 physical adsorption/desorption Table 1 shows the results for the BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size of calcined copper-based catalysts characterized with the N2 physical adsorption/desorption. In general, a decrease in both BET surface area and pore volume with the increase of copper content was observed. As shown in Fig. 1a, with the increase of the Cu content, the hydrotalcite structure was destroyed, which was responsible for the remarkable decrease of the specific surface area of the catalysts. The low specific area of the catalyst with a higher copper content could also contribute to the larger particle size of Cu and the higher crystallinity of the catalyst (Table 1, Fig. 1c). Besides, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of copper-based catalysts indicated the formation of type IV isotherms with a H3-type hysteresis loop (Fig. 2 a). The characteristic of the H3-type hysteresis loop suggested that the corresponding material was the pore structure formed via a lamellar granular accumulation. Fig. 2b showed the pore radius of copper-based catalysts. The pore radiuses of the catalysts with high copper content dispersed in a wide range, while the pore radiuses of the catalysts with low copper content were concentrated in the range of 50 to 80Å. Among the catalyst, the Cu0.4Mg catalyst had the narrowest distribution of the pore radius, which correspondingly had the least pore size, the highest BET surface area and the biggest pore volume (Table 1). The varied porous structures of the catalysts would not only affect the dispersion of Cu, but also the interaction of Cu species with the catalyst support, which was further investigated with the H2-TPR characterizations. 3.1.3 H2-TPR The reduction profiles of the copper-based catalysts were shown in Fig. 3 . Obviously, the peak temperature of hydrogen consumption varied from 246 to 313°C for the copper-based catalyst and increased with the increase of copper content. In general, the reduction peak of CuO in the low temperature regions indicated that CuO had a weaker interaction with MgO support. The higher reduction temperature of CuO in the CuMg catalyst with the higher loading was mainly due to the consumption of more hydrogen for the reduction of the CuO with the prolonged reduction process, which shifted the reduction temperature to the higher temperatures. The reduction degree of the CuMg catalysts was shown in Table 1. The reduction degree of CuMg catalyst was generally higher than 80%, due to the weak interaction of CuO with the support. The relatively lower reduction degree at the lower Cu content was mainly due to the relatively low mass transfer limitations for hydrogen to access the small particles of CuO. The morphologies and metal dispersion of the catalyst were further characterized. 3.1.4 TEM and N2O chemisorption As shown in Fig. 4 , the microstructure of catalysts was characterized by TEM. The sheet structures were observed in all CuMg catalysts. However, with the increase of copper content in catalysts, Cu particles agglomerated to some extent, which was consistent with the results of XRD (Table 1). In addition, the differences between Cu particle size and copper content would lead to the differences in the surface DCu and surface area (SCu). Therefore, N2O chemisorption was further carried out and the results were shown in Table 1. The results showed that with the increase of copper content, the DCu and SCu were decreased gradually, which was because that the increase of Cu content led to the aggregation of metallic Cu species. EDX was performed to characterize the abundance of Cu, Mg and O on surface of the catalyst. The elemental composition was shown in Table S1. Cu0.2Mg had the lowest copper loading and correspondingly the copper content on the surface was the lowest. In comparison, the highest copper loading of Cu3.2Mg catalyst possessed the highest content of copper while with the lowest content of magnesium. The exposure of the varied atom densities of especially Cu on surface of the catalyst would significantly impact the capability of the Cu for catalyzing the hydrogenation reactions, which was discussed below. In addition, the exposure of the Mg with the varied concentration on surface of the catalyst could also affect the distribution of the basic sites on surface of the catalysts, which was further investigated with the CO2-TPD characterization. 3.1.5 CO2-TPD The desorption profiles of CO2 on surface of the catalyst were shown in Fig. 5 . With the change of magnesium content, the desorption temperature of CO2 varied remarkably. For the Cu0.2Mg, Cu0.4Mg and Cu0.8Mg catalysts, the desorption of CO2 even did not reach the completion at the temperature as high as 700°C, indicating the presence of the basic sites with the strong strength. In comparison, the desorption peaks for the Cu1.6Mg and Cu3.2Mg catalyst mainly located in the low to middle temperature regions. The results for the quantitative characterization of surface basicity of copper-based catalysts are shown in Table 2 . As copper content increased from 0.4 to 3.2 (molar ratio) in the CuMg catalysts, the overall amount of the basic sites decreased gradually. The decrease in the abundance of the basic sites was mainly due to the decrease of the amount of the basic sites with the medium to strong strength. MgO is an alkaline oxide, and the decrease of the proportion of MgO in catalyst formulation with the increase of Cu content would inevitably lead to the decrease of the abundance of the basic sites. The above characterizations showed that the change of the relative ratio of the Cu and Mg content in the CuMg catalysts could change the porous structures, exposed surface area of metallic Cu, and the distribution of the basic sites, impacts of which on their catalytic performance in the conversion of EL to GVL and 1,4-PeD were further investigated."
9,Catalytic activity,"3.2 Catalytic activity Figs. 6 and 7 showed the product distributions in the hydrogenation of EL over CuMg catalysts. Initially, water was chosen as the reaction medium and the catalysts were evaluated at the different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6. At 110°C, from Cu0.2Mg to Cu3.2Mg with the increase of Cu content, the yield of GVL increased monotonously to 99.0%, with little 1,4-PeD generated. From EL to GVL involves the hydrogenation and lactonization reactions [38]. The availability of hydrogenation sites was conductive to the production of GVL, while the high alkalinity of the catalyst with the low Cu content such as Cu0.2Mg did not favor the lactonization that involves the dehydration reaction [39]. With the increase of the reaction temperature to 170°C, the yields of GVL increased over the CuMg catalysts with the low Cu content. The relationship between the yield of GVL and Cu content was shown in Fig. 8 a. The yields of 1,4-PeD were also increased to some extent, indicating that the higher temperature could promote the opening of ring of GVL to generate 1,4-PeD. However, the yield of 1,4-PeD was rather low over the catalyst with the low copper content, with the highest of 9.2% over the Cu0.4Mg. The ring opening reaction of GVL and the subsequent conversion to 1,4-PeD involves the hydrogenation reactions. The solubility of hydrogen in the reaction medium is an essential parameter determining the hydrogenation efficiency. In order to aid the opening of the ring of GVL and the hydrogenation reactions, the reaction medium was changed to the alcohols that have much higher solubility to hydrogen [40]. With ethanol as the reaction medium, the yield of 1,4-PeD increased significantly (Fig. 7a). Further to this, the yield of 1,4-PeD could increase further if the solvent was switched to isopropanol (Fig. 7b). Isopropanol not only has even higher solubility to hydrogen than ethanol, but also superior in donating hydrogen [41,42]. In addition, the basic sites in the CuMg catalysts played important roles in the formation of 1,4-PeD. In either ethanol or isopropanol medium, the yields of 1,4-PeD were higher over the Cu0.2Mg. The yields of 1,4-PeD generally decreased with the increase of copper content and the decrease of the magnesium content with isopropanol as the reaction medium. The abundance of copper sites did not necessarily lead to the high yields of 1,4-PeD, but the abundance of basic sites did favor the production of 1,4-PeD. Besides, the variation of the yield of 1,4-PeD with the basic site was shown in the Fig. 8b. The high solubility of hydrogen might also be a prerequisite for the production of 1,4-PeD, which was further investigated via screening the selectivity of the catalysts in other solvents. As shown in Fig. 9 , among the solvents investigated, the yield of GVL was the highest in water. Apparently, the further opening of the ring of GVL to 1,4-PeD was difficult. The hydrogen solubility was the lowest in water, which was not favorable for further hydrogenation of GVL. In comparison, the solubility of hydrogen in the alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol), THF, diethyl ether and toluene are much higher than that in water [43,44], which was shown in Table S2 and the yields of 1,4-PeD was also much higher. Among the solvents, isopropanol performed the best as it also has the superior capability to donate hydrogen, especially over the catalyst with the basic sites. The blank runs without catalysts were conducted and the results were shown in Table S3. The results showed that the EL could not be converted in the absence of catalyst and thus catalyst is essential for its effective conversion. In addition to the change of solvent, another method to increase the solubility of hydrogen in solvent is to increase the pressure. To further confirm the positive effects of hydrogen solubility on the production of 1,4-PeD, the conversion of EL to 1,4-PeD in isopropanol was further performed at higher hydrogen pressures. As shown in Fig. 10 a and b, the yield of 1,4-PeD indeed increased with the increase of hydrogen pressure to the maximum of 97.4% over again the Cu0.2Mg catalyst that had the most abundant basic sites. The result herein again proved the importance of the basic sites on the selective conversion of EL to 1,4-PeD. Besides, the experiment without hydrogen and using alcohols as hydrogen donor was also performed over Cu0.2Mg catalyst to explore the necessity of hydrogen. As shown in Table S4, only 43.5% GVL while no 1,4-PeD was obtained in ethanol. In isopropanol, there was 1,4-PeD formed but the yield was only 12%, which not only proved that the H2 solubility of isopropanol is better than that of ethanol (Fig. 9), but also proved that, in the absence of hydrogen, using alcohols as hydrogen donor could not make the reaction take place effectively. In addition, the prolonging the reaction time favored the production of 1,4-PeD (Fig. 10c). In summary, for the conversion of EL to GVL and 1,4-PeD, the catalytic performances of the copper-based catalysts in this study was similar with noble metal [45] and higher than some other copper-based catalysts reported [45–49], as shown in Table S5. In order to compare the intrinsic activity of the catalyst in this work, TOF values of other reported catalysts were compared, as shown in Table S6 [50,51]. The comparison showed that the CuMg prepared in this study exhibited the superior activity. In addition to measure the catalytic activity, the recyclability of the catalysts was also investigated as the stability of the copper-based catalyst is an issue at hydrothermal conditions. H2 solubility in mole fraction at 298 K and 1 atm."
10,Catalytic reusability,"3.3 Catalytic reusability The recycle tests were conducted at optimal experimental condition (170°C, 3 h, PH2 = 6 MPa) with Cu0.2Mg and Cu3.2Mg as the catalysts. Both isopropanol and water were used as the reaction medium with the aim of production of 1,4-PeD and GVL, respectively. After finishing each reaction, the catalyst was collected by centrifuging, washed using ethanol for three times and dried overnight for next recycle reaction. The results were shown in Fig. 11 . With isopropanol as the solvent, 1,4-PeD was the main products over either the Cu0.2Mg or Cu3.2Mg catalyst. However, the Cu0.2Mg catalyst exhibited the superior stability as the yields of 1,4-PeD remained above 90% and did not change much with the accumulation of the cycles of the test. In comparison, over the Cu3.2Mg catalyst, the yields of 1,4-PeD decreased progressively while that of GVL increased correspondingly. The Cu3.2Mg catalyst lost the capability to further hydrogenate the GVL to 1,4-PeD, which was a sign of deactivation. In water, although GVL was the major product, a significant amount of 1,4-PeD were also produced initially at the higher pressure of hydrogen employed. However, with the progress of the reaction, the yields of 1,4-PeD decreased remarkably over both Cu0.2Mg and Cu3.2Mg catalysts, while correspondingly the yields of GVL increased. Nevertheless, the increase of the production of GVL did not mean that the catalyst maintained the catalytic stability as both of the catalysts were losing the capability to further hydrogenate GVL to 1,4-PeD. The used catalysts after the four cycles of tests were characterized by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. 1d. After the four cycles of reuse with water as the reaction medium, the diffraction of the Cu phase became much more intensified while the peak intensity did not change much with isopropanol as the reaction medium. Besides, the Cu0.2Mg in water exhibited obvious the crystal phase of Cu2O (JCPDS 99-0041) and the Cu particles sizes were calculated and the results were shown in Table 3 . For Cu0.2Mg catalyst in isopropanol, the particle size of metallic copper only increased from 3.6 to 3.9 nm after the recycle tests, which explained its superior catalytic stability. The particle size of metallic copper in the Cu3.2Mg catalyst, however, increased from 12.0 to 16.4 nm with isopropanol as the reaction medium, which was responsible for the partial loss of the capability for the further hydrogenation of GVL to 1,4-PeD. In water, the particle sizes of metallic copper, however, increased very significantly for both the Cu0.2Mg and Cu3.2Mg catalysts, which led to the loss of the catalytic activity progressively in the recycle tests. In water medium the metallic copper species had a very high tendency to aggregate while in isopropanol the metallic copper species were much more resistant to migration and aggregation, especially over the Cu0.2Mg with the highly developed porous structures. This was the main reason for the distinct catalytic stability of the Cu0.2Mg and Cu3.2Mg catalysts in the hydrogenation of EL to GVL or 1,4-PeD with isopropanol or water as the reaction medium."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, the results herein demonstrated that the physiochemical properties of the CuMg catalyst and the reaction medium significantly impacted the selectivity in the production of GVL and 1,4-PeD. The increase of the relative content Cu in the CuMg catalyst destroyed the hydrotalcite structure of catalyst precursor, which further led to remarkable decrease of the specific surface area, enlarged pore radiuses, aggregation of the metallic Cu species, and decreased dispersion of Cu species and abundance of the basic sites with the medium to strong strength. However, the formation of GVL was favored over the Cu3.2Mg catalyst with the high Cu content, while was unfavorable over the Cu0.2Mg with the abundant basic sites. The abundant basic sites in the CuMg catalyst with the low content Cu were essential for opening of the furan ring in GVL to form 1,4-PeD. In addition, the availability of hydrogen also facilitated the production of 1,4-PeD, as 1,4-PeD formation was promoted at the higher hydrogen pressure and in the alcohol solvent especially isopropanol with the higher hydrogen solubility. In isopropanol, the Cu0.2Mg catalyst with highly developed porous structures exhibited the superior catalytic recyclability for the production of 1,4-PeD. However, in water medium, the copper species in both the Cu0.2Mg and Cu3.2Mg catalysts showed a very high tendency to aggregate, leading to the progressive deactivation of the catalysts. Copper content, abundance of the basic sites and reaction medium are the three key factors that are closely related to the selectivity and stability of the CuMg catalysts."
