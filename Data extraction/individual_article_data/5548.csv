0,Introduction,"Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure, is diagnosed based on (i) prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation; (ii) craniofacial abnormalities, including microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, and a deficient philtrum (Wattendorf and Muenke, 2005); and (iii) central nervous system dysfunction. FAS is the severe end of the spectrum of congenital abnormalities that alcohol can cause; the entire range of problems is referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD has been estimated to affect 8–10 of 1000 newborns per year (Sampson et al., 1997). Thus, it is a major public health concern. Although scientists have performed many studies on FASD, the mechanisms causing the damage are not yet elucidated. Furthermore, there is no known effective strategy for prevention (other than ethanol abstention) or treatment. Oxidative stress has been linked to the development of FASD (Henderson et al., 1995). Studies demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in the fetuses of ethanol-consuming mothers and in neonatal animals fed with ethanol (Heaton et al., 2002; Henderson et al., 1995). Our previous studies showed that the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) played a critical role in ethanol-induced brain damage (Peng et al., 2005; Long et al., 2010). Astaxanthin (AST), known as a carotenoid pigment, is a strong antioxidant which protected membranous phospholipids and other lipids against peroxidation (Palozza and Krinsky, 1992). Evidence showed that AST had up to several-fold stronger free radical antioxidant activity than vitamin E and carotene (Kurashige et al., 1990; Guerin et al., 2003). In double-blind, randomized controlled trials, AST was found to lower oxidative stress in several human health conditions (Kidd, 2011). Moreover, it is known that ROS up-regulate proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6. High levels of these cytokines are associated with neurotoxicity. Whereas, AST has been found to reduce makers of inflammation, e.g., TNF-α. Thus, AST has been deemed to be safe and has potential as a therapeutic antioxidant and anti-inflammation agent for further testing in human diseases (Fassett and Coombes, 2009). In this study, we explored the protective effect of astaxanthin on maternal ethanol induced embryonic deficiency, and investigated the underlying mechanisms."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Animals,"2.1 Animals Wild type C57BL/6 (WT) mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. And they were maintained in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources, a facility accredited by the Association of the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free environment on a 12-h light/dark cycle (8:00–20:00) with access to chow and water ad libitum. Female mice selected for the experiment weighted from 18 to 22 g. All aspects of the animal care and experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Research Committee protocols of Sun Yat-sen University. Pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug and this was considered as gestational day 0 (E0). To evaluate the effect of ethanol on embryonic development, successfully mated female mice were randomly divided into 4 ethanol (EtOH) groups and one control group. There were 6 mice in each group (3 for morphology assessment and 3 for RT-PCR and western blotting). Mice in the ethanol groups were given intraperitoneal ethanol (25%, v/v, dissolved in lactate Ringer's injection [LR]) at 10:30 on G8, at a dose of 0.02 ml/g body weight. Mice in the control group were injected with 0.02 ml/g of LR."
3,Experimental treatment,"2.2 Experimental treatment We obtained astaxanthin from Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). Along with intraperitoneal EtOH (0.02 ml/g, on G8), pregnant mice were given intraperitoneal AST (10 mg/ml, dissolved in normal saline buffer [NS]) at 10:00 on G7 and G8, at a dosage of 1.0, 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Mice in the control group were given intraperitoneal NS (0.02 ml/g on G7 and G8) and intraperitoneal LR (0.02 ml/g on G8). There were 6 mice in each group (3 for morphology assessment and 3 for RT-PCR and western blotting). The embryo numbers for each group were: 64 in control group, 43 in EtOH group, 44 in EtOH + 1.0 mg/kg d AST group, 50 in EtOH+10 mg/kg·d AST group, 52 in EtOH + 50 mg/kg d AST group, 52 in EtOH + 100 mg/kg d AST group."
4,Morphology assessment,"2.3 Morphology assessment On G10.25, 3 pregnant mice in each group (randomly selected) were sacrificed, and the embryos were explanted using an anatomical microscope with the removal of the maternal decidua in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Photos of whole embryos were taken by a digital camera under an anatomical microscope at a fixed magnification, and head length (HL, distance between the anterior end of the telencephalon and the posterior end of the midbrain), head width (HW, distance between the 2 sides of the telencephalon), and crown rump length (CRL) were measured. We photographed a transparent ruler at the same magnification, and all the measurements (HL, HW, and CRL) were calculated by comparison with the ruler image by use of Adobe PhotoShop CS3 extended (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA)."
5,Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),"2.4 Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Embryos were dissected from pregnant mice on G9.25, and brains were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a Reaction Ready™ first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation). After incubation at 70 °C for 3 min and cooling down to 37 °C for 10 min, RT cocktail was added to the annealing mixture and further incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Two microliters of 1:2 diluted cDNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR using Bio-Rad iCycler iQ Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed in a 25 μl volume using SYBR GreenER qPCR Super Mix for iCycler (Invitrogen). All primers were purchased from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation. All PCR assays were performed in triplicate. The reaction conditions were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Beta-actin was amplified from all samples on each plate as housekeeping genes. The reaction mixtures without template cDNA were used as negative controls."
6,Western blot analysis,"2.5 Western blot analysis Embryos were dissected from pregnant mice on G9.25, and brains were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Tissue was lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer. The lysates were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature in 5% milk blocking buffer solution for 1 h, followed with the blocking solution containing first antibody overnight at 4 °C. Otx1, Sox2, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, or β-actin was detected with specific primary antibodies (anti-Otx1 antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon; anti-Sox2 antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon; anti-TLR4 antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon; anti-MyD88 antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon; anti-NF-κB antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon; anti-β-actin antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Chemicon;). After washing three times with Tris buffer solution (TBS) for 5 min, the blot was incubated with a second antibody at 1:2000 dilution (Chemicon). The blot was again washed three times with TBS before being exposed to the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Pierce)."
7,Determination of oxidative stress indexes and inflammatory reaction indexes,"2.6 Determination of oxidative stress indexes and inflammatory reaction indexes On G9.25, embryo brains were collected and homogenized in NS and tested for H2O2 content with the BIOXYTECH H2O2-560 kit (Oxis International Inc., Portland, OR), for MDA with the BIOXYTECH MDA-586 kit (Oxis International Inc., Portland, OR), and for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) with the BIOXYTECH GPX-340 kit (Oxis International Inc., Portland, OR), according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Total protein was extracted and protein concentration was determined. Also, the tissue lysates were detected for TNF-α and IL-1β levels with ELISA kits (ASSAYPRO EMT 2010-5, EMI2200-1, MO, USA)."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Descriptive results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.0. One-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons. Post hoc analyses, when appropriate, were performed using LSD. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of two variants. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
9,Results,
10,"Retardation of embryonic growth and down-regulation of neural marker genes were induced by ethanol, and were antagonized with AST","3.1 Retardation of embryonic growth and down-regulation of neural marker genes were induced by ethanol, and were antagonized with AST To investigate the underlying mechanisms and to further explore antagonists, we treated pregnant mice with ethanol and AST, and examined the embryonic growth indexes and the neural marker gene expression. A maternal treatment of 0.02 ml/g ethanol caused significant decreases of HL, HW, and CRL in embryos (Fig. 1 ). An intraperitoneal treatment of 50 or 100 g/kg/d AST antagonized ethanol-induced embryonic abnormalities. No significant differences were shown in embryo growth with the treatment of 0.02 ml/g ethanol and 100 g/kg/d AST as compared with the controls. Otx1 and Sox2 are neural marker genes that increase in expression during neural development (Papanayotou et al., 2008; Simeone et al., 1993). We detected Otx1 and Sox2 expression by RT-PCR and western blotting in embryos with a maternal treatment of 0.02 ml/g ethanol, and found significant down-regulations (Fig. 2 ). An intraperitoneal treatment of AST antagonized reduced ethanol-induced down-regulation of Otx1 and Sox2 expression. Our results indicated that AST as an antagonist, protected against ethanol-induced embryonic damage."
11,Maternal administration of AST inhibited ethanol-induced embryonic oxidative stress,"3.2 Maternal administration of AST inhibited ethanol-induced embryonic oxidative stress We detected the levels of H2O2, MDA and GPx in ethanol-administrated embryos with or without AST pretreatment. Maternal ethanol at a dose of 0.02 ml/g on G8 caused a significant increase in H2O2 and MDA, and a significant decrease in GPx, as compared with the control embryos (Fig. 3 ). These changes of oxidative stress indexes were reversed by a pretreatment of AST on G7 and G8 with a dose–response relation. This data confirmed that FASD was mediated by oxidative stress, and suggested that AST protected the embryos from ethanol-induced neurotoxicity via ROS inhibition."
12,AST blocked ethanol-induced embryonic inflammatory reaction,"3.3 AST blocked ethanol-induced embryonic inflammatory reaction Ethanol modulates cytokine secretion in fetuses (Ahluwalia et al., 2000). To investigate whether TLR4 signaling plays a role in ethanol-induced embryonic neurotoxicity, and to further determine the effect of AST, we examined the levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β in ethanol-treated mice embryos with or without AST. TLR4 in mRNA and protein levels were significantly up-regulated following 0.02 ml/g ethanol treatment compared to the controls (Fig. 4 ). And this resulted in significant increases in the levels of MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β (Figs. 4 and 5 ). A pretreatment of AST suppressed the ethanol-induced TLR4 signaling up-regulation and cytokine secretion. These results indicated that TLR4-mediated inflammatory damage might be involved in the mechanisms of ethanol-induced embryonic toxicity, which was suppressed by AST pretreatment."
13,Discussion,"The data presented herein demonstrated a protective action of AST against maternal ethanol-induced embryonic developmental retardation. Maternal exposure to ethanol causes FASD, and preventive or curative treatments for this disorder is still underdetermined. AST, as a carotenoid, has the properties of scavenging free radicals, anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation (Santos et al., 2012). We found in this study that prenatal ethanol treatment induced embryonic growth retardation and down-regulation of neural marker genes. AST pretreatment antagonized ethanol-induced neurotoxicity, and reversed ethanol-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory damage. Our results indicated the potential protective effect of AST on FASD due to oxidative and inflammatory damage. Carotenoids are ubiquitous and found in high concentrations in plants, aquatic animals and microorganisms. Human and other animals can not synthesize these chemicals by themselves. AST is a xanthophyll carotenoid containing two oxygenated groups on each ring structure, which are responsible for its enhanced features, e.g. anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation. Synthetic forms of AST have been manufactured, and as such people could source AST in other methods besides their diet (Santos et al., 2012). The transport of AST in human plasma is conducted by lipoproteins, and the proportion of AST was significantly higher in the very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons plasma lipoprotein fraction than in the high density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins fractions (Østerlie et al., 2000; Coral-Hinostroza et al., 2004). Thus, AST is a very lipophilic compound and has a low oral bioavailability. This criterion limited its potential to target human diseases. Several studies have been reported to solve this issue. Mercke et al. showed that incorporation of lipid-based formulations can enhance oral bioavailability in humans (Mercke-Odeberg et al., 2003; Hussein et al., 2006). In our study, AST was administered intraperitoneally to the animal models. Injection approaches might improve the bioavailability, but tend to trigger a concern about its safety. According to previous evidence, oral AST administration for 8 weeks can be safe for healthy adults, and no adverse events have been reported (Spiller and Dewell, 2003). Animal and clinical studies so far have shown excellent safety and tolerability of AST. The safety, bioavailability and effects of AST on oxidative stress and inflammation pointed to its ability to treat several health conditions, e.g. cardiovascular diseases, UV-light protection, and have been assessed in a small number of clinical studies (Fassett and Coombes, 2011). We found that AST inhibited ethanol-induced embryonic oxidative stress and inflammatory response. AST pretreatment protected embryos from maternal ethanol-induced neurodevelopmental retardation and down-regulation of neural marker genes. Our results supported the assumption that protecting embryos from ethanol-induced neurodevelopmental damage with daily administration of AST might be a practical and beneficial strategy. Inflammatory dysfunction is often associated with alcohol-related medical conditions (Vallés et al., 2004). This effect is well known to affect the liver, but the brain is also a target. The central nervous system contributes to anti-inflammatory regulation through neuroimmunoendocrine actions, and is particularly susceptible to the effects of alcohol and toxicity. Alcohol modulates inflammatory mediators and activates signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in inflammatory responses in glial cells, demonstrating a direct effect on the brain (Vallés et al., 2004; Blanco et al., 2004). Alcohol also impairs multi-organ interactions, leading to brain damages and nervous diseases (Wang et al., 2010). It is well recognized that alcohol passes through the placenta and affects the fetal immune system. Ahluwalia B et al. investigated the effect of maternal alcohol use on synthesis and secretion of cytokines in the human fetus. Sample tests of fetal cord blood and mother's blood showed that the alcohol-induced decrease in cytokine synthesis was proportional to the level of alcohol in the media, suggesting a direct effect of alcohol on cytokine synthesis (Ahluwalia et al., 2000). Our results showed that maternal ethanol caused a significant increase of cytokine level in embryos, and that the anti-inflammatory agent, AST, antagonized ethanol-induced inflammatory responses and neurodevelopment deficiency. This suggested that inflammation played a role in mechanisms of FASD. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in initiating innate immune response. TLR4 is pivotal for the innate immunity in central nervous system (CNS) (Tanga et al., 2005). Activation of TLR4 leads to NF-κB activation and subsequent induction of proinflammatory cytokines (Vabulas et al., 2002). Although a pivotal role of TLR4 receptors in alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and brain damage is demonstrated, little is known about its role on FASD, and the effects of fetal ethanol exposure on embryonic inflammatory environment, especially in early and middle gestation (Sozo et al., 2009). Studies have revealed that TLR4 is distinct expression in embryos and related to inflammation and apoptosis (Michailidis et al., 2010). Furthermore, TLR4 have been shown to regulate neurogenesis (Mallard et al., 2009). In our study, maternal ethanol treatment caused significant up-regulation of TLR4 and downstreaming MyD88, NF-κB in embryos. Thus, up-regulation of TLR4 in ethanol-treated embryos might cause an imbalance of neurogenesis and apoptosis in embryos, and lead to a risk of developmental retardation. On the other hand, the teratogenicity of alcohol might be amplified by dysfunction of maternal–fetal environments, and influence the risk of FASD."
14,Conclusions,"Our results demonstrated a protective effect of astaxanthin on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and suggested that oxidative stress and toll-like receptor signaling associated inflammatory reaction were involved in this process."
