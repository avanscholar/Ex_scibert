0,Introduction,"Currently, the process of oxidation is most widely sought in industries for environmentally benign research using the approach of green chemistry [1]. The highlight is to avoid the formation of irremovable toxic materials as the process uses conventional transmission metal or a halogen oxo- such as bromate, chromate and permanganate solution [2]. Besides the environmental impact, conventional oxidants are very expensive. Previous research that used nitric acid due to its low cost, but with the formation of its nitrogen oxide by-product, was undesirable and is considered a potential hazard to the environment [3]. In addition, poor benzaldehyde selectivity was also a disadvantage to these processes. To overcome these problems, alternative green chemistry related oxidation processes are currently being developed. In the catalyst-driven oxidation process, the alcohols are oxidized to their corresponding aldehydes and other by-products that can be easily removed from its aldehyde through separation techniques. The use of heterogeneous catalysts in these processes gave rise to problems, hence many types of research have been dedicated to the development of these processes using reliable and reusable catalysts [4]. A gold supported metal oxide was reported to catalyze hydrogenation oxidation reactions [5], combustion of methane [6,7,8], alcohol to aldehyde (or ketone) oxidation [9–14], aldehyde-to-carboxylic acid oxidation [15] and epoxidation of propylene [16,17]. Studies have shown the ability of palladium as a catalyst in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol [18]. Moreover, studies have shown that gold with palladium dispersed on the metal oxide as a catalyst is an excellent catalyst in vinyl chloride production from the hydrochlorination of acetylene [19], propene epoxidation utilizing hydrogen as a sacrificial reductant [20,21], hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes [22], and CO oxidation [23]. Among all the heterogeneous catalysts reported for the oxidation of alcohols, Pd has been the most promising one because its high activity and selectivity is gained simultaneously [24–26]. Kaneda et al. reported that the active sites of oxidation coordinated at the surface of the nanocluster Pd [27]. Concerning the on-going research on benzyl alcohol oxidation, the type of oxidant to be used in the oxidation is of great importance in maintaining the green chemistry concept and to reduce the processing cost. Up to the present date, TBHP has shown to be a promising oxidant that is used in several studies in oxidation processes such as oxidative desulfurization [28], water-oxidation [29], oxidation esterification [30], oxidation of alkyl aromatics [31], and Wacker oxidation [32], as well as alcohol oxidation [33,34]. TBHP has also received considerable attention in recent years due to the report made by Mahdavi et al. [33], where the abilities of oxidants such as H2O2, molecular oxygen and TBHP were compared and TBHP was proven to be a better oxidant due to its weaker OO bond peroxide that yields a greater conversion. The efficacy of alcohol oxidation can be further improved by using TBHP and modifying the catalyst to give higher activity in the reaction. This work focuses on the effect of bimetallic ratio of Au and Pd nanoparticles loaded on titania on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Preparation catalysts nanoparticles,"2.1 Preparation catalysts nanoparticles An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (5 g of HAuCl4.H2O solid diluted with 250 mL of distilled water) and an aqueous solution of PdCl2 (5 g of PdCl2 with 25 mL of distilled water) were prepared (35). Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) with PVA/metal of 1.2 (wt/wt) was added to the solution above and kept aside for 5 min. NaBH4 solution (0.1 M, 0.04 g in 10 ml distilled water) with NaBH4/metal ration of 5 (mol/mol) was introduced to the mixture to form a dark-brown sol. After 30 min of sol formation, the colloid was immobilized by introducing the TiO2 support followed by few drops of sulfuric acid to adjust the pH at 1–3, with stirring for 2 h. Next, the catalyst was separated by filtration, and then washed with 2.0 L of deionized water. It was then dried at 116 °C. This experiment was repeated using the same procedure for monometallic Au or Pd catalyst with PVA/metal 0.65 (wt/wt). The catalyst prepared consists of different metal loading which is 1 wt% Au/TiO2, 1 wt% Pd/TiO2, 0.5 wt% Au 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2, 0.6 wt% Au 0.4 wt% Pd/TiO2, 0.4 wt%, and Au 0.6 wt% Pd/TiO2. The catalyst was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, XRD (Shimadzu XRD 6000), BET, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and TEM (Hitachi H1700)."
3,Performance evaluation,"2.2 Performance evaluation The benzyl alcohol oxidation was performed in glass flasks that were charged with benzyl alcohol (40 mL) fitted with a Graham condenser and heated in a silicone oil bath. An amount of calculated catalyst and TBHP as an oxidant with ratio 10:1 was added to the solution and stirred using the stirrer set between 200 and 300 rpm. Once the mixture reached the required temperature (80 °C), the reaction time was considered as the starting point. Samples from the flask were taken periodically. Furthermore, the reaction time was prolonged for up to 24 h to ensure that the reaction was completed. After the complete oxidation benzyl alcohol reaction, the product was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-FID (Shimadzu Gas Chromatography GC-14B) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (QP5050A SHIMADZU). The reusability product was analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, an AAS (Thermo Scientific S series Spectrometer), and a GE712405."
4,Results and discussion,
5,The characterization,"3.1 The characterization Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the AuPd supported on TiO2. Pure TiO2 has the characteristic of different peaks ascribed to anatase (JCPDS 01-078-2486) and rutile (JCPDS 01-072-4812). As can be seen from the XRD pattern, sharp and intense peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 53.9°, 62.8°, 70.3°, were assigned to TiO2 anatase and the peaks at 2θ = 27.5°, 56.8°, 67.0° were assigned to pure rutile. For the monometallic 1 wt% Au/TiO2 and 1 wt% Pd/TiO2, non-crystalline Au and Pd could be highly dispersed on the support [35]. Apparently, no addition peaks could be observed from the pattern that corresponds to the existence of the metals Au and Pd. The results were further supported by Hutching et al. who reported a great control Au and Pd particle size and good dispersion on the support as achieved by sol-immobilization method [36]. This shows that the metals Au and Pd have been successfully distributed on the TiO2. To show the existence of Au and Pd in the catalyst a set of the different ratios for bimetallic catalysts was prepared. The peaks were expanded within the range of 37° to 40° in Fig. 1(b). For all of the bimetallic catalysts, the pattern broadened weakly at 2θ = 39.1 and the peaks are slightly shifted to the right, indicating the presence of the AuPd alloy [37]. Furthermore, as more Au was added to the catalyst, the peak became broader, suggesting that Au appeared to be a smaller size like nanocrystallite when incorporated with the TiO2. Thus, the dispersion of the particle on the TiO2 support was enhanced [38]. It is believed that this great control of metal dispersion for catalysts makes a large contribution to the catalytic activity to achieve the highest conversion of the reaction. The average particle diameter obtained was within the range of 50–250 nanoparticles as observed through the TEM images in Fig. 2 . According to the sizes and morphology, all the catalysts consist of two structures: a round shaped structure with a large size >40 nm attributed to TiO2 and a small round shape with a size <10 nm ascribed as a AuPd alloy. From Table 1 , the average particle size obtained for each ratio of the bimetallic AuPd catalyst is within the range of 4.5–3.1 nm, including the monometallic of the Au and Pd catalyst which has a value of 3.6 nm and 4.5 nm, respectively. By comparing both monometallic metals, the pure palladium has a larger particle size compared with Au. However, the monometallic size is much bigger than the bimetallic catalyst (0.5 wt% Au-0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2). These results are based on the fact that the chemical combination of both metals forms a bimetallic catalyst that is better than the physical combination [36]. Researchers claim that this supposedly bimetallic catalyst was much smaller than both the monometallic Au and Pd. Thus, this explains the size difference between the monometallic and the bimetallic catalyst. From the results in Table 1, it can be seen that the ratio of AuPd nanoparticles (by maintaining 1 wt% metal) has given a different size of the catalyst. As the Pd percentage increased (0.6 wt% Pd), the size of the particle became smaller (3.53 nm). However, after the addition of more Au (0.6 wt% Au), the size of the alloy AuPd slightly increased (3.89 nm). These results indicate bimetallic system behavior changes with the effect of metal loading as a function of the particle diameter of the catalyst. In other words, the concentration of AuPd plays an important part in adjusting the particle size of the catalyst. 0.5 wt% Au 0.5 wt% Pd /TiO2 were well combined and dispersed on titania as indicated by TEM analysis. With relevance to the catalytic performance, the smallest average particle size was expected to be the most active catalyst. The 0.5 wt% Au and 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 were observed to be the smallest, hence providing a better catalytic activity performance in this study. The main active species in the catalytic process are the active sites of oxidation coordinated at the surface of the nanocluster Pd and Au. From the BET results in Table 1, the 1 wt% Au/TiO2 has the largest surface area (66.2 m2/g) compared to the 1 wt% Pd/TiO2 catalyst (24.5 m2/g). As we know, the larger surface area produces a smaller particle size of the catalyst on the surface. Then, most of the active site from the metal was exposed on the surface. This is probably due to the TEM images which show TiO2 as metal oxides that have a bigger size which suggests that a low surface area was obtained in contradiction with the large surface area from the result. Following the ratio of AuPd (Table 1), the BET results are within the range of 49.0–53.0 m2/g. Previously, the researcher stated that the BET is not the only factor controlling the catalytic activity [37], but a detailed discussion on the size of metal and its association to the area of the active site are worth understanding. Apparently, the embedding of Au and Pd into the microspores of TiO2 shows less contribution to the surface area, although the surface area of the catalyst was maintained in the range above. It also indicates that the metals have almost similar sizes to those that were exposed to the surface. More importantly, indistinguishable differences in surface morphology from the TEM results complemented the statement."
6,Catalyst tests,"3.2 Catalyst tests Benzyl alcohol was used for its catalytic oxidation to prove the theory that the particle size was derived during characterization with catalytic activity. The target oxidized product is benzaldehyde but other by-products such as toluene, benzoic acid, and benzyl benzoate can also be formed based on the reaction conditions and catalyst. 3.2.1 Influence of mono Au or Pd catalyst on the benzyl alcohol oxidation Table 2 lists the results of solvent-free oxidation with TBHP over the Au-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. The reactions of the benzyl alcohol oxidation produced benzaldehyde as the main product, along with the toluene, benzoic acid and benzyl benzoate as its by-product. 0.5 wt% Au with a 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits the highest conversion of 19.1% and TOF 399.6 h−1 at 80 °C which is twice the conversion value of the monometallic catalyst. These monometallic Au and Pd catalysts have a lower selectivity towards benzaldehyde due to the high production of toluene as a by-product. As compared to the Pd/TiO2, Au/TiO2 has a lower conversion but higher selectivity of benzaldehyde, thus suggesting that Au can effectively reduce the production of toluene. In various metal loading, the benzyl alcohol oxidation increases with Pd loading to Au metal and reaches 19.1% over 0.5 wt% Au with 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 at TOF 399.6 h−1. This suggests that the number of active sites increases with the addition of Pd in the reaction. Previously, there were some improvements in the catalytic activity of several AuPd bimetallic systems [38–40]. The addition of Pd to Au draws the density of Au away from the Pd and attributes a positive synergistic electronic. Thus, the interactions of the Pd atoms were enhanced with the benzyl alcohol [38,39,41]. However, when Pd was added up to 0.6 wt%, the % conversion started to decline slightly. This implies that the metal loading content for Pd may lead to the agglomeration of Pd or Au metal. The formation of a large cluster can decrease the number of available active sites for the reaction, as suggested by Lee et al. [42]. The quantity of the reactants consumed, and the products produced was calculated as conversion and selectivity using Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) Conversion % = Moles of benzyl alcohol reacted Total moles of benzyl alcohol × 100 (2) Selectivity % = Moles of product formed Moles of benzyl alcohol reacted × 100 Through catalytic experiments, there are several important subjects to be focused on. Firstly, the highly dispersed Au in contact with Pd shows high selectivity in benzyl alcohol oxidation. As can be seen from the previous result of TEM, the size of the AuPd alloy decreased slowly as the Au metal concentration is more than the Pd metal concentration. Consequently, the data obtained by Tiruvalam and co-worker shows that Au metal has a high tendency to control the size of the catalyst. As the small particle size is controlled by Au sites, there is a possibility that the distribution of the small particle size of Au on the surface is responsible for the high selectivity. Secondly, when more Pd loading was added the conversion improved, although, the selectivity of benzaldehyde was marginally diminished. With this observation, possibly due to captivation on most of the Au sites by the Pd metals, there is the possibility that Au sites are more responsible for the high selectivity of benzaldehyde. This is due to their large size on the surface of the active sites compared to another catalyst, as reported in Table 1. Also, the presence of Pd aids in the formation of toluene as a by-product in the reaction which explains the high conversion of benzyl alcohol oxidation. From the reaction, it is important to intermix AuPd to study the behavior of the metal on the reaction activity. Specifically, 0.5 wt% Au with the 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 catalyst shows the highest conversion with high benzaldehyde selectivity (>80%). Therefore, the TEM results with a reasonably consistent size clarify the effects of the interaction on metal-metal and metal-support in oxidation reactions. Another important practical implication of heterogeneous catalysts is their stability to perform the reaction. The reaction of benzyl alcohol and TBHP was performed under optimal conditions using 0.5 wt% Au with 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 to evaluate the reusability test after the first reaction was completed. After five cycles, the catalyst was successfully recovered and reused with a low activity loss of about 2%. As observed in Fig. 3 , the products were tested using AAS and the amount of metal leaching was lower. By comparing the concentration of Au and Pd, no leaching of the palladium metal was observed for all cycles. However, a small amount of Au concentration (<0.05 mg/L) was leached from the catalyst after the first cycle. The conversion was decreased as the Au leached from the reactions after the recycled catalyst was used [43]. The significant minute changes in the concentration of metal Au show that both Au and Pd are highly recommended for catalyst oxidation processes. 3.2.2 Mechanism study for benzyl alcohol reaction The next reaction is to study the catalyst ability on the benzyl alcohol for the oxidation reaction. The support does not directly influence the dehydrogenation step but affects the adsorption, activation, and transfer of oxygen, which gives strong effects on the catalytic activity. Chen et al. [46] stated that a catalyst with a metal oxide possesses a higher abundance of oxygen vacancies, which contributes to the short-lived oxygen transfer O2−. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , metal acts as the sole catalytic center where benzyl alcohol coordinates onto metal, forming then M-alcoholate species [44]. The removal of a secondary H atom is indeed the rate-controlling step. These results point to an electron-deficient carbon center in the intermediate formed in the rate-determining step [45]. The metal-alcoholate transforms into carbonyl compounds, hence forming the M-hydride species. The adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the support dissociates to the chemisorbed oxygen species O2 – and O−, which diffuses to the support lattice vicinity, and thus it is activated at the oxygen vacancies and converted to lattice O2−. Finally, the M-hydride types can be oxidized with the presence of adsorbed oxygen to get the initial metal sites [46]. Benzaldehyde is easier to convert to benzoic acid as benzaldehyde is an intermediate product when compared to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The presence of TBHP increases the % conversion of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. The homolytic thermal decomposition of TBHP to form tBuO and OH radicals in the absence of a catalyst is a possible transformation. This reaction is a radical chain process. Fig. 5 illustrates the possible chemical reaction or bath for the formation of carboxylic acid. The radical tBuO surface radical abstracts H from the carbonyl groups forming the RCO species with subsequent oxidation by the OH radical to form RCOOH. Based on the proposed mechanism above, it was possible to clarify the importance of TBHP and the Au-Pd/TiO2 catalyst towards the oxidation benzyl alcohol reaction."
7,Conclusion,"The catalytic efficiency of the prepared AuPd supported TiO2 was evaluated for the production of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol with TBHP as an oxidant. The conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde reached up to 19.1% after 4 h with a catalyst loading of 0.5 wt% Au 0.5 wt% Pd/TiO2 and the molar ratio of benzyl alcohol to TBHP 10:1 at 80 °C. The highest selectivity of benzaldehyde (>80%) was achieved using these catalysts by linking most of the exposed active sites in the AuPd catalyst. The synergistic effect of these metals on the surface of the support also plays an important role. Due to the lack of evidence regarding the interpretation of the reaction mechanism using TBHP, such as the activation of oxygen from TBHP and the effect of TiO2 as a support to the metal, more research needs to be conducted for better understanding. However, the bimetallic catalyst can be recovered and reused in consecutive catalytic processes with a slight loss of activity under optimized conditions. Interestingly, the concept of green chemistry was observed as there weren't any environmentally hazardous products produced, even though TBHP was used as an oxidant. Moreover, the stability of these catalysts was manifested by recycling and reusing them, hence, endowing them with industrial value."
