0,Introduction,"The reduction of ketones and aldehydes is of great relevance for organic synthesis, as well as industrial application in the production of flavours, fragrances, fine chemicals and pharmaceutical compounds [1]. Typically, the stoichiometric amount of toxic reducing agents such as NaBH4, boranes, and LiAlH-(OR)3 are used for this transformation [2], and a large number of environmentally unfriendly by-products are produced in these reactions. The catalytic hydrogenation has been realized as an excellent method that resolves this problem by using H2 gas as a clean and green reagent. A wide variety of highly productive catalysts based on metals ions (Ru [3], Rh [4], Ir [5], Fe [6], and Co [7]) have been developed for this purpose. However, these hydrogenation reactions were achieved using an inorganic/organic base and high-pressure H2 gas. A facile self-aldol side reaction unavoidably occurred under the basic conditions limits application of the catalytic hydrogenation. In addition, the specialized experimental setup was required for security with the presence of high-pressure H2 gas. Recently, Hanson [8] and Do5b reported two catalysts for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes under 1 atm H2 pressure and base-free conditions. However, only a few examples were reported in this condition, and high-pressure H2 gas, higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time were required for aliphatic aldehydes. Thus, the development of an efficient and general organometallic catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes at atmospheric pressure of H2 as well as under base-free conditions is highly desirable. Recently, a series of metal-ligand bifunctional iridium complexes containing a functional bipyridine or a bipyridonate ligand were reported by Fujita and Yamaguchi [9]. It was demonstrated that they are very active catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols and the dehydrogenative cyclization for the construction of quinazolinones [10a,10b]. More recently, we developed the highly efficient transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes with isopropyl alcohol under neutral conditions using [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] complexes [10c]. Within this context, to further explore the catalytic activity of the metal-ligand bifunctional iridium complexes, we applied this kind of catalysts to catalytic hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes under 1 atm H2 pressure and base-free conditions."
1,Results and discussion,"The reaction conditions were optimized by using acetophenone (1a) as the model substrate (Table 1 ). Various catalysts were initially evaluated in the model hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone (1a) in tert-amyl alcohol for 12 h at 30 °C. When [Cp*IrCl2]2 (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) (cat. 1), [Cp*Ir(H2O)3][OTf]2 (cat. 2), [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl)][Cl] (cat. 3) and [Cp*Ir(6,6′-(OMe)2bpy)(H2O)] [OTf]2 (cat. 4) were screened, the desired product 2a was only obtained in ≤20% yield. Interestingly, it is clear from Table 1, that the yield of 2a could be obviously increased with the presence of [Cp*Ir(2-(OH)py)]Cl2 (cat. 5), [Cp*Ir(6,6′–(OH)2–2,2′-bpy)(H2O)] [OTf]2 (cat. 6) and [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 7) bearing a functional pyridine, bipyridine or bipyridonate ligand. The yield of product 2a could reach up to 96%, when the hydrogenation reaction was performed in the presence of cat. 7. From the above results, it can be inferred that the functional ligands play a crucial role in improving the activity of catalysts. When the reaction was performed in the presence of [Cp*Rh(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 8) or [(p-cymene)Ru(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] (cat. 9) as an alternative catalyst, we obtained only 35% and 6% yields of the target product 2a, respectively. However, the yield of 2a is lower in the presence of cat. 7 with a loading of 0.2 mol %. The optimized condition (Table 1, entry 7) was then applied to various ketones to extend the scope of the method. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The reactions with aromatic ketones bearing electron-donating substituents at the aromatic ring, such as methyl and methoxy, proceeded to give the corresponding products (2b-2e) in good to excellent yields (entries 1–4). Halogen atoms were well tolerated, as demonstrated by high yields of the fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-substituted aromatic alcohols (2f-2k, entries 5–10). Furthermore, the strong electron-withdrawing phenyl rings in 1l and 1m survived from the reduction in 97% and 96% yields (entries 11–12). 2-acetylpyridine (1n) and 2-acetonaphthone (1o) also underwent hydrogenation readily and delivered excellent yields of alcohols in 96% and 95% yields (entries 13–14). For the reaction of butyrophenone (1p), the corresponding product 2p could be obtained in high yield (entry 15). Fused aliphatic ketones 1q and 1r also underwent the hydrogenation to yield the desired products in 89% and 87% yields (entries 16–17), respectively. Under the same conditions, hydrogenation of various aldehydes was carried out using complex 7 as the catalyst (Table 3 ). In addition to benzaldehyde (3a), other electron-rich aldehydes such as 3-methylbenzaldehyde (3b), 4-methylbenzaldehyde (3c), 3,4- dimethylbenzaldehyde (3d), 4-isopropylbenzaldehyde (3e), and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (3f), were readily reduced to corresponding alcohols efficiently in 92–96% yields (entries 1–6). Similarly, fluoro, chloro and bromo substituents were tolerant in this catalytic system and the desired products 4g-4j were obtained in 83–97% yield (entries 7–10). Strong electron-withdrawing substituents, such as cyano and ester group, were also converted to the corresponding primary alcohols (4k-4l) in 94% and 95% yields (entries 11–12). Other aromatic aldehydes such as 2-naphthaldehyde (3m) and 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (3n) could be also used as suitable substrates and the corresponding products 4m-4n were obtained in 94% and 96% yields, respectively (entries 13–14). The present catalytic system was also applicable to aliphatic aldehydes, such as decanal (3o) and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (3p), and the yields of corresponding aliphatic alcohols were high (entries 15–16). Furthermore, when the unsaturated aliphatic aldehyde 3q served as a substrate, the CC bond remained unreacted and the product 4q was obtained in 92% yield (entry 17). On the basis of the above results, chemoselectivity was investigated with aromatic substrates containing two ketone groups or one aldehyde and one ketone group in the presence of cat. 7 (Scheme 1 ). The hydrogenation of 4-acetylbenzaldehyde (5) was accomplished, but only product 6 was obtained in 94% yield (Scheme 1, a). Both of aldehyde and ketone groups were hydrogenated to alcohols. Interestingly, while 1,3-diacetylbenzene (7) with two ketone groups was tested, only one ketone group was selectively hydrogenated and the corresponding product 8 was obtained in 92% yield (Scheme 1, b). Considering the above experimental results, a plausible mechanism was proposed for the present hydrogenation of ketones or aldehydes with H2 catalyzed by cat. 7 (Scheme 2 ). This mechanism is closely related to the proposed mechanism of the transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes with isopropyl alcohol [10c]. The initial step of the reaction involves elimination of H2O from the catalyst cat. 7 to afford an unsaturated species A bearing a 2-pyridonate-based ligand. Then, the reaction of H2 with the species A would occur to afford iridium hydride species B. Finally, the simultaneous transfer of the hydride on iridium with the hydroxyl proton on the functional ligand to CO bond of ketones or aldehydes would occur to give the corresponding alcohols accompanied by the regeneration of A."
2,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have developed an efficient iridium catalyst [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)] bearing a functional bipyridonate ligand for the hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes in tert-amyl alcohol under 1 atm H2 at 30 °C. It does not require base or high-pressure hydrogen condition, offering an operationally simple and green procedure. Of significance is the good tolerance of a wide variety of functional groups, such as electron-rich or deficient groups, cyano, ester, and halide groups. Notably, the research exhibits new potential of metal-ligand bifunctional catalysts for hydrogenation."
