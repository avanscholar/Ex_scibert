0,Introduction,"Nowadays, fossil fuels have been used to produce nearly 80% of the energy utilized in the world and hence a rising number of environmental and supply problems have been emerged. To overcome these problems, all types of eco-friendly and renewable energy sources are classified as essential in all prospective studies about the evolution and development of energy systems. Hydrogen is an interesting energy vector to store and distribute the intermittent and diluted renewable solar energy source. Among the different processes to obtain hydrogen from renewable resources (biological conversion, direct photolysis, electrolysis/photoelectrolysis and thermochemical water splitting) [1‒3], the photocatalytic solar production of hydrogen from water or alcohols derived from biomass over semiconductor materials appears as a simple and promising way to generate renewable hydrogen efficiently [4]. Among the bio-derived products to be photoreformed, glycerol is an interesting sacrificial agent taking into account its worldwide availability and low price as by-product of bio-diesel production processes [5]. The active semiconductors reported for the generation of hydrogen are mainly based on TiO2 as their photostability and low cost [6–8]. Though, the relatively high energy gap (Eg) of TiO2 (3.2 eV) and the great recombination rate of the photoinduced charges limits their photoefficiency and thus great efforts are made to find alternatives to TiO2-based photocatalysts [9–11]. Among the alternatives to TiO2, the graphitized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) received considerable attention in last years as a 2D semiconductor having an adjustable electronic properties Eg~2.7 eV) that allow its photoactivity in the visible spectrum [12,13]. In addition to its interesting optical properties, the g-C3N4 shows other characteristics including its excellent chemical stability, non-toxic nature, structural versatility and low cost [14,15]. Repeated units of N-bridged tri-s-triazine units forming 2D planes stacked via Van Der Waals interactions form the g-C3N4. The conduction (CB) and valence (VB) band are located at relative energy positions −1.13 and + 1.52 eV versus NHE, respectively. This bands allow the hydrogen formation by photoreduction of organic amalgams like glycerol. Although the g-C3N4 has great potential as photocatalyst, it also has two main drawbacks related with its low surface area for light absorption and the squat competence for the departure of the photo charge carriers that limit its photocatalytic efficiency [14–16]. The incorporation of metal or nonmetal co-catalysts on g-C3N4 exterior, or the synthesis of porous g-C3N4 structures and combination with another nanosemiconductor were some of the alternatives planned in the previous works to improve the limited competence of the pristine g-C3N4 [17–20]. Among the methods that can be employed to enhance the superficial progression of g-C3N4, the synthesis of mesoporous g-C3N4 by nanocasting using different silica templates and the exfoliation (thermal, mechanical or chemical) of g-C3N4 in nanosheets are two of the most effective methodologies [21,22]. In the present study we will produce mesostructured g-C3N4 sheets with improved surface texture by nanocasting using mesoporous silica as hard template [23]. Another important strategy for improving the efficiency of g-C3N4 is related with the coupling with other nanosemiconductors having balancing Egs like TiO2, Co3O4, Bi2O4, Ag2MoO4, perovskites,… [24–29]. This strategy is based on the construction of suitable heterojunctions which facilitates the movement of the photo-generated electrons and holes minimizing its recombination and increasing its lifetime. Among the semiconductors proposed to couple with g-C3N4, the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is an interesting candidate because of its a pnature with direct Eg (~2.2 eV) and high optical absorbance of visible light [30–33]. The combination of Cu2O with g-C3N4 has been shown to improve the photocatalytic competence in several works related with photodegradation of organic contaminants as well as in production of hydrogen by photoreforming of aqueous organic molecules [34–36]. However the reported photocatalytic efficiencies in these studies are still very low due to the low surface area of the Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites which limits its light absorption. The catalytic behaviour of the Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites is derived from the efficient spatial parting of the photocharges associated with the formation of heterojunctions between both semiconductors. Therefore, the photoactivity of the nanocomposites depends on the Cu2O-g-C3N4 coupling degree because it controls the development of interfaces between them which are responsible of the internal charge–transfer processes in the composites. For that reason methodologies of synthesis which allows the close connection among Cu2O and g-C3N4 with well-developed interfacial nanostructures are desirable. Conventional routes to prepare Cu2O include the use of inert atmospheres or capping agents and lead to low surface area oxides [37,38]. A simple method to obtain nanocomposites with good contact between Cu2O and g-C3N4 is based on the use of mesoporous Cu2O and g-C3N4 prepared individually from soft and hard-template sol–gel respectively and combined via facile ultrasonication assisted mixing method [23]. This method allows the establishment of Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanostructures with close contact and homogenous interfaces between Cu2O and g-C3N4 phases. This kind of nanocomposites with close contact and homogenous interfaces is expected to have enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. In this scenario and considering that the development and type of contacts between Cu2O and g-C3N4 are strongly dependent on the Cu2O-g-C3N4 ratio, in this work we studied the effect of the Cu2O loading on the physicochemical characteristics and photoactivity of Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites prepared by ultrasonication assisted mixing method. The nanostructural properties of the composites were determined combining N2 isotherms, TEM, UV–vis spectroscopy, XRD, and XPS. While the optical and optoelectronical progressions study the luminescence and photocurrent measurements to examine the separation and recombination of the charge carriers in the Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites. The mechanism for the hydrogen production from glycerol aqueous solutions over the mesoporous Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites is proposed."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Polymeric F127 (EO106-PO70EO106, average MW 12,600 g/mol) surfactant was utilized as a mediator. Acetic acid (CH3COOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethanol (CH3CH2O), urea (CO(NH2)2) and dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) were applied deprived of more refinement and from Sigma–Aldrich. Copper (I) tert-butoxide (C16H36Cu4O4) was purchased from Triveni Chemicals (India). A Millipore Milli-Q apparatus was labored to purify the water."
3,Formation of mesostructured g-C3N4,"2.2 Formation of mesostructured g-C3N4 Mesoporous silica (HMS) (ca. 500–1000 m2 g−1) prepared according the literature [39] was casted as hard-template to prepare g-C3N4 with high surface area. For the preparation, 1 g of HMS was detached in 50 mL of Milli-Q water by ultrasonication for 30 min. A mixture of urea (5 g) and dicyandiamide (3 g) were gradually added to the suspension of HMS. The stirred suspension was then heated 80 °C for 12 h until dryness. The dried mixture was calcined for 4 h at fixed 550 °C-heated furnace to form the pyrolysis-polymerization of dicyandimide and grow the carbon nitride sheets. The calcined precipitates were immersed in NH4HF2 (2 M, 50 mL) with vigorous stirring for the whole day to eradicate the HMS. The filtrated g-C3N4 was washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove any contaminants attached to the surface and dried at 100 °C for 12 h to gain the mesoporous g-C3N4."
4,Synthesis of mesoprous Cu2O,"2.3 Synthesis of mesoprous Cu2O A soft sol–gel template method was used to prepare mesoporous Cu2O using the F127 tri-block copolymer structure pointing mediator. Molar fractions of reagents and solvents used in the oxide synthesis were C16H36Cu4O4/F127/C2H5OH/HCl/CH3COOH = 1:0.02:50:2.25:3.75 respectively. F127 (1.6 g) was thawed in ethanol (30 mL) under stirring for 60 min followed by the addition, under strirring, of HCl (0.74 mL) and CH3COOH (2.3 mL). Then, the required amount of copper (I) tert-butoxide was incorporated to the former solution and preserved in forceful rousing for 60 min. The gelification of the solution was archived after removal of ethanol at 40 °C for 12 h in humidity-controlled chamber. Then, the gel formed was aged for 24 h at 65 °C and finally it was calcined at 3 50◦C in midair to confiscate the F127 surfactant and to produce the final mesoporous Cu2O."
5,Formation of Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"2.4 Formation of Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites The Cu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites were prepared through utrasonication-assisted mixture method. The mesoporous g-C3N4 (0.2 g) was mixed with variable amount of mesoporous Cu2O (0.5–3% molar) and dispersed in deionized water (400 mL) by ultrasonication under 40 KHz for 3 h. The ultrasonication process allows the separation of g-C3N4 nanosheets in contact with Cu2O forming thin layered Cu2O-gC3N4 composites. The Cu2O-gC3N4 composites were collected by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C. The nanocomposites were labeled as x Cu2O-gC3N4, as “x” denotes the weight content of Cu2O (0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3%)."
6,Physicochemical depiction,"2.5 Physicochemical depiction A Bruker AXS D8 Endeavour X diffractometer was used to detect the X-ray diffraction patterns for the new materials. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) was leisurely in KBr dispersal in the assortment of 400–4000 cm−1 using PerkinElmer apparatus. The texture properties of the prepared specimens applying N2-adsorption measurements were recorded and investigate by a Nova 2000 series (Chromatech apparatus). The transmission electron microscopy images (TEM) were examined by a JEOL JEM-1230 (Japan) at 200 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) was studied at 25○C by a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (RF-5301, Japan). A Zahner Zennium electrochemical system was labored to spectacle photocurrent intensity. A conducting glass Indium-tin-oxide slices (ITO) with the diameters (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) was used to transient photocurrent measurements via deposition process. The V-570 spectrophotometer of Jasco, Japan was used to display the UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer. The Eg values were intended from the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS)."
7,Photoactivity experimentation,"2.6 Photoactivity experimentation The hydrogen generation experiments were achieved through engaging a pre-known amount of prepared samples in an aqueous solution containing 10% vol of glycerol under visible light illumination. The reaction was carried out at ambient temperature and pressure in a pyrex photoreactor (volume of 400 mL) equipped with a top window cell and recirculation refrigeration system. Before measurement, the reactor was purged with nitrogen to ensure complete air removal. The reactor was irradiated at the top with light from a Xe arc lamp (500 W) with UV cutoff filter (>420 nm). Samples of the evolved gases were analyzed periodically (every 1 h for a total reaction time of 9 h) and injected in a gas chromatograph (Agilent GC 7890 A system) to quantify the hydrogen produced."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Structural analysis,"3.1 Structural analysis The crystal phase analysis of bare g-C3N4, pure Cu2O, and Cu2O-gC3N4 composites were determined by XRD and the diffractograms are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The XRD profile of the pristine g-C3N4 parades a solid diffraction feature at 27.4° (3.25 A) and a second smaller peak at 13.0° (6.74 A) corresponding to the inter-layer sheet distance ((002) plane) and in-planar distance between graphitic layers of carbon nitride planes ((100) plane), singly [19,20]. Oppositely, the XRD profile of the pure Cu2O reveals diffraction peaks at 29.7°, 36.6°, 42.5° and 61.6° assigned to the corresponding (hkl) the cubic Cu2O phase (JCPDS No. 05–0667) as indicated in Fig. 1 [37,38]. The diffractograms of Cu2O-gC3N4 composites only show the diffraction peaks at 27.4° and 13.0° already observed on the g-C3N4, indicating no noticeable changes in their graphitic layer structure by the presence of Cu2O. No additional peaks related to Cu2O phases were observed in any of the composites due to the lower oxide heaping. The strength of the (002) peak corresponding to g-C3N4 in the composites decreases upon increasing the Cu2O loading. As indicated above, the intensity of this peak is characteristic of the inter-layer sheet distance (π–π stacking) and therefore its decrease in intensity indicates large exfoliation of graphitic layers of g-C3N4 produced by the intercalation of Cu2O in the layers. The liquid ultrasonic mixing used in the preparation of the composites facilitates this fact [40]. The textural properties of g-C3N4, Cu2O and Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites (represented by the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 sample) were determined from its adsorption–desorption isotherms of N2 (Fig. 2 ) and the surface specific areas determined from them are collected in Table 1 . The pristine g-C3N4 shows an IV-type isotherm with H2 hysteresis feature that indicated a complex mesoporous network. The specific surface area developed by the bare g-C3N4 170 m2/g (Table 1) and considerably superior than the reported literature values for the conventional graphitic carbon nitrides (5–15 m2/g) [41]. The pure Cu2O also unveils great explicit surface area as in Table 1 and mesoporous structure as derived from the similar isotherm type and hysteresis. The N2 isotherm of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite is similar to that displayed by the bare g-C3N4 (type IV) that indicates that the nanocomposite maintains the mesoporous network of g-C3N4. However the hysteresis loop of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 composite is wider, indicating stacking of flaky particles probably formed during the exfoliation process used for the preparation of the nanocomposites. The xCu2O-gC3N4 composites develops higher specific BET surface area than the bare g-C3N4. The surface area of composites increases with the Cu2O loading (Table 1). These facts point to the contribution of both the copper oxide species that exfoliate the g-C3N4 layers in the composite structure. The mesoporosity and high surface area of the xCu2O-gC3N4 composites are elements that facilitate the absorption of light and transport of reactants for the photocatalytic application. The nanomorphology of pristine g-C3N4 and pure Cu2O and the nanostructure of xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites (represented by the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 sample) were determined from TEM and HRTEM (Fig. 3 ). The TEM image of bare g-C3N4 (Fig. 3A) shows nanosheets of graphitic planes partially aggregated with some nanoporosity derived from the nanosilica used as hard-template. The pure Cu2O (Fig. 3B) consists of large aggregates (>100 nm) of homogeneous rounded particles of 15–20 nm in size with a porous structure formed between aggregates. The TEM image of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite (Fig. 3C) shows irregular nanoparticles of Cu2O with different size (range of 5–25 nm) decorated on the exterior of g-C3N4 nanolayers. In line with the previous XRD results, the g-C3N4 nanosheets in the composite show less aggregation than in the case of the bare counterpart as consequence of the ultrasonication that facilitates the segregation, intercalation and dispersion of the Cu2O nanoparticles on the exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets. The nanostructure of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite, with particular attention to the interaction and contacts between Cu2O and g-C3N4, was studied by HRTEM (Fig. 3D). The HRTEM image of 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite exhibited a lattice fringe with d spacing of 0.32 nm corresponding to (0 0 2) facet of g-C3N4 and a second lattice fringe of 0.24 nm ascribed to the (1 1 1) plane of Cu2O nanoparticles [20,21,30,31]. The HRTEM image also spectacles a local connection between the interfaces of Cu2O and the surface of g-C3N4 indicating the incorporation of Cu2O nanoparticles on the g-C3N4 outward with formation of nanoheterojunctions between both components in the composites."
10,Chemical and optical properties,"3.2 Chemical and optical properties Superficial functional clusters on Cu2O-gC3N4 composites were studied by FTIR and compared to the parent Cu2O and g-C3N4 as exposed in Fig. 4 . The parent g-C3N4 sample exhibits a peak at about 808 cm−1 associated to the stretching mode of the triazine units. The peaks at 1639 cm−1, 1567, 1407, 1319, and 1240 cm−1 ascribed to the elongating vibration of the CN and CNH heterocycles [42,43] and finally, a broad band around 3300 cm−1 characteristic of the terminal –NH/–NH2 stretching vibration modes. The spectra of the xCu2O-gC3N4 composites exhibited the characteristics peaks already observed in the bare g-C3N4, which indicates that the original graphitic layers were not altered after the incorporation of Cu2O. The FTIR spectra of the composites also show a small additional peak at 6641 cm−1 related with the Cu(I)–O bridging vibration of Cu2O which is a probe of the existence of Cu2O on the graphitic layers of the composite [44]. The intensity of the distinguishing peaks of g-C3N4 in the composites decreases upon increasing the Cu2O loading corroborating this fact the presence of Cu2O interacting with the surface functional groups (–NH–, =N-, –NH2) of the graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets [45]. The chemical state of Cu, C and N species on the surface of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite were inspected by XPS as in Fig. 5 . The high resolution Cu 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 XPS core level (Fig. 5A) shows two major peaks at ~952.1 and ~932.3 eV assigned to Cu1+ ions. These binding energies are slightly shifted respect the values reported in literature for Cu1+ ions, which may be due to the surface interaction of Cu2O with g-C3N4 [46]. The weak satellite peak at 945 eV and the small 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks around 954 and 934 eV probe the very scarce occurrence of Cu2+ on the exterior of the nanocomposite. The O 1s core level (Fig. 5B) shows an intense component at 531.4 eV confirming the presence of O2− ions in the lattice of Cu2O. The C 1s core level spectra given in Fig. 5C shows three peak contributions around 284.8, 286.1 and 287.6 eV which can be indorsed to adventitious C–C bond, C–NH and N–CN, respectively [47,48]. The intensity of the last two contributions for the composite was lower than that of the bare g-C3N4, which evidences the decoration of g-C3N4 with Cu2O nanoparticles. The N 1s core level spectra (Fig. 5D) of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite shows a main component at about 398.4 eV which is allocated to the sp2of the triazine group of g-C3N4 [49]. The above XPS results confirm the presence of Cu2O nanoparticles in contact with the surface of the g-C3N4. The optical absorption properties of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites compared to the parent materials was studied by UV–vis DRS as presented in Fig. 6 ). The spectrum of the pristine g-C3N4 had an absorption edge at 438 nm that corresponds to its intrinsic band gap, while the pure Cu2O exhibits an intense absorption in the visible expanse with the edge located at 550 nm. The absorption edges of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites show an increase in intensity and a redshift respect to the bare g-C3N4. The shift in the absorption edge becomes more wide as the content of Cu2O in the composite increase up to 2 wt.%. The further loading did not change the edge. The redshifting in the photo-absorption spectra of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites is attributed to the adjacent connection amid Cu2O and g-C3N4 nanosheets that contributes to enhance the photons absorption at the visible range [50]. The electronic (indirect) Eg of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites premeditated by the Tauc Plot is exposed in Fig. 6B (Table 1). The Eg values show a significant decrease respect to the bare g-C3N4. Thus, the Eg of the nanocomposites depends on its Cu2O content, resulting in band gap narrowing proportional to the increase of the Cu2O loading up to 2% mol. This fact suggests that the contacts and heterojunctions formed between the Cu2O with the g-C3N4 are homogeneous at low loading (up to 2%) and they do not improve for higher loading."
11,Photocatalytic activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic competence of the xCu2O-gC3N4 heterojunctions were evaluated in the photoreforming of glycerol aqueous solutions (10% vol) under visible light to produce hydrogen (Fig. 7 ). As expected, the bare g-C3N4 and pure Cu2O show individually very low photoactivity, ~400 and 900 μmol/g respectively, in line with their fast recombination of charge carriers that limits their photoefficiency [51]. On the contrary, all the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites show enriched photocatalytic production of H2 associated with the specific Cu2O or g-C3N4 counterparts. Remarkably, the photocatalytic efficiency over the most active 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite (15,150 μmol/g) increases by 38 and 17 times the efficiency achieved on the individual g-C3N4 and Cu2O counterparts. The photoactivity of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites depends on the Cu2O content. Until the Cu2O loading in the composite achieves the 2 mol %, there is no effect on the efficiency (2400, 10,500, 15,150 and 15,075 μmol/g for the Cu2O content at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mol % respectively). This result implied that Cu2O content in the nanocomposites is a very important factor in the photocatalytic activity because, as shown by the characterization results above, the Cu2O-g-C3N4 ratio determines the number and efficiency of the heterojunctions formed between both seminconductors which are involved in the effective separation of photogenerated charges in the nanocomposites as will be discussed below. To evaluate the effect of the photocatalyst concentration on the photoefficiency, photocatalytic tests with different photocatalyst loading (0.5–3.0 g/L) of the most active 2Cu2O-gC3N4 sample were performed as in Fig. 8 A. The findings indicate that hydrogen production was promoted by increasing the photocatalyst concentration from 0.5 to 2.5 g/L (from 9000 to 20,000 μmol/g). Then, for higher photocatalysts concentration (3.0 g/L), the hydrogen production was reduced (16,500 μmol/g). This outcome because the surge in the count of photocatalysts particulates in the reactor dissipates the light permeation inside the photocatalyst suspension [52–55]. The stability of the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite was also tested in five consecutive reaction runs (after each run, the photocatalyst was separated, washed and loaded again for a new test). As it can be seen in Fig. 8B, the 2Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposite exhibits excellent stability and reusability with only small decrease in the H2 production (<3%) after five consecutive runs associated with the small loss of photocatalyst after each separation/reload cycle."
12,Photoefficiency and structure of xCu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites,"3.4 Photoefficiency and structure of xCu2O-g-C3N4 nanocomposites Physicochemical characterization of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites demonstrated that Cu2O nanoparticles were effectively dispersed on the shallow of exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets and the nanoheterojunctions established between them mainly affects the light absorption ability of the g-C3N4, generation, and transporting the photocarriers involved in the photoreduction of glycerol. Therefore, the observed differences in the photoactivity of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites must be investigated in view of the changes in the photophysical properties derived from the alterations of the Cu2O content. The UV–vis spectra of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites (Fig. 6A) demonstrated a wide absorption of the visible spectrum respect to the pristine g-C3N4 depending on the concentration of Cu2O in the composites. The comparison of the photoactivity of the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites (Fig. 7) with its energy band gap (Table 1) shows a clear parallelism, which indicates that the photoefficiency is partially related to its ability to absorb a wide range of the visible light. Additionally, the transport and separation of the photogenerated charges are also fundamental factors that determine the final photoefficiency of the nanocomposites. For that reason the spatial separation of photocarriers on xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites were studied by PL emission spectroscopy (Fig. 9 A). The bare Cu2O and g-C3N4 display intense emission mountains at 462 and 511 nm respectively, conforming to transitions between their band gap states and indicative of high electron–hole recombination. The PL emission peaks in the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites gradually shift and decrease in intensity with the Cu2O introduction, attaining the lowest intensity for the samples loaded with 2 and 3 mol %. The decrease in the PL emission peaks of the Cu2O-gC3N4 compared with the pure g-C3N4 signposts inhibition of the recombination processes of the photo-generated carriers. The creation of junctions between the Cu2O and the g-C3N4 are responsible for this inhibition as they facilitate the electron–hole transportation between them. The efficient separation of photocharges in the nanocomposites requires an optimum in Cu2O loading (2 mol %) below which few junctions are formed and above which the excess does not subsidize to creating new effective heterojunctions. The efficiency in the crescendos of the produciton and parting of the photocharges on the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites were confirmed measuring their photocurrent response for repeated cycles under intermittent visible light irradiation (Fig. 9B). Transient photocurrent of Cu2O and g-C3N4 show low photocurrent density while the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites show a significant increase in the photocurrent density, which confirms the higher separation efficiency of electrons and holes in the heterojunctions. Likewise the PL, the photocurrent values increase with the Cu2O loading achieving the maximum when Cu2O is incorporated at 2 mol % (4 folds compared to bare g-C3N4) and proving again that the efficient separation of photo carriers requires an optimum expansion of Cu2O-g-C3N4 heterojunctions in the nanocomposites. The PL and photocurrent response results on xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites are consistent and proportional to their activity results (Fig. 7) which indicates that the lessening in the recombination of the photocharges associated to the formation of heterojunctions greatly contributes to the advance in the photoefficiency observed on the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites."
13,Suggested mechanism operating on Cu2O-g-C3N4 heterojucntions,"3.5 Suggested mechanism operating on Cu2O-g-C3N4 heterojucntions In view of the nature of the Cu2O (p-type) and g-C3N4 (n-type) semiconductors, form II p-n heterojunctions could be hypothesized as contrivance for the separation and transfer of charges between them [56]. The comparative position of the VB and CB of Cu2O and g-C3N4 can be theoretically determined using the next equalities: (1) E C B = X − 0.5 E g + E 0 (2) E V B = E g + E C B where the absolute semiconductor electronegativity is given by X and the hydrogen scale-free electron energy to the absolute vacuum scale is given as E 0 (E 0 = −4.5 eV). The relative CBs energies of Cu2O and g-C3N4 are −0.69 and −1.16 eV respectively, while the location of the VBs are +1.31 and + 1.47 eV, respectively (Fig. 10 ). Apparently, the straddling energy band-structure of C3N4 and Cu2O is unsuitable to construct the p-n heterojunctions. However, g-C3N4 is a characteristic n-type semiconductor. The location of its Fermi level (Ef) is close to CB (Ef = −0.96 eV). Whereas the Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor and the location of its Ef is near to VB (+1.13 eV) [56‒58]. Therefore, after the contact, the Ef of both materials are aligned, founding a p-n heterojunction with a new band structure in the boundary state (Fig. 10). The created electric field at Cu2O-gC3N4 heterojunction facilitates, after illumination, the electron flow from Cu2O to g-C3N4 along the CB, while holes could flow oppositely from g-C3N4 to Cu2O along the VB. According to this mechanism, the electrons accumulated in the CB of g-C3N4 are combined with H‏+ to produce H2 while simultaneously the accumulated holes in VB of Cu2O react with glycerol to oxidize it (Fig. 10). The photocatalytic enhancement the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites over the individual Cu2O and g-C3N4 photocatalysts is therefore derived from the creation of nanojunctions among the g-C3N4 and Cu2O that increase the absorption of visible light and effectually supress the recombination of photocharges which results in enhanced photocatalytic H2 production."
14,Conclusions,"Mesoporous Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites were synthetized by utrasonication-assisted combination of mesoporous Cu2O and g-C3N4. Physicochemical characterization of the Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites demonstrated that Cu2O nanoparticles were effectively dispersed on the shallow of exfoliated g-C3N4 sheets. The established nanojunctions improve the ability of the g-C3N4 to enhance the visible light response, generate, and transport the photogenerated carriers. The Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites exhibited higher photoefficiency for H2 production from glycerol than individual Cu2O and g-C3N4 parent materials. The photocalytic efficiency of the Cu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites depends on the Cu2O loading, achieving the maximum efficiency at 2 mol % of Cu2O (17 and 38 times higher than on bare Cu2O and g-C3N4, respectively). The photoactivity enhancement the xCu2O-gC3N4 nanocomposites is derived from the construction of heterojunctions amongst the g-C3N4 and Cu2O that increase the absorption of visible light and efficiently supress the recombination of the photocharges which results in enhanced H2 production. The development of heterojunctions on the nanocomposites is controlled by the concentration of Cu2O which achieves the maximum efficiency when Cu2O is incorporated at 2 mol %."
