0,Introduction,"As a clean energy source, hydrogen (H2) has attracted considerable attention due to its high energy density, non-polluted and storable advantages. Among various technologies to produce hydrogen, photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting is intensively pursued by researchers [1–3]. Yet, the efficiency of H2 production is significantly limited by the high activation energy, slow kinetics, and low value of the oxygen evolution half-reaction [4,5]. To tackle this problem, most reports take the strategy of using hole sacrifice agents to increase H2 production, such as methanol, triethanolamine, sodium sulfite/sodium sulfate, etc. Nevertheless, the utilization of sacrifice agents not only causes a waste of solar energy in oxidation half-reaction, but also increases the reaction cost and produces unwanted pollutants in liquid. Therefore, it is highly desirable to construct a novel H2 generation pathway by replacing the oxidation half-reaction with efficient reaction rate and value-added products. Very recently, photocatalytic H2 production by water reduction coupled with organic oxidative dehydrogenation has received much interest of scientist owing to its advantages of mild conditions, pollution-free and value-added organic chemicals produce [6,7]. Lin et al., [8] reported a surface nickel-modified ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for highly efficient photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) integrated with proton reduction for hydrogen evolution. Besides, Liu et al., [9] reported to address the issue of sluggish photocatalytic oxidation reaction by coupling the H2-producing half reaction with value-added benzylamine oxidation using metal–organic framework (MOF) composites. Up to now, the study of water reduction coupled with organic oxidative dehydrogenation is still in the initial stage, there has not reach a consensus on the reaction mechanism of molecules change process, and the comparative study with different sacrificial reagent systems is blank. In addition, the reaction activity is limited by the inefficient separation and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. To this end, rationally designing a Step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction with fast interfacial charge transfer and high redox potential is an effective strategy to realize high-efficient solar to hydrogen photosynthesis process [10–12]. However, it is worth noting that the S-scheme heterojunction is usually composed of two n-type semiconductors. The small Fermi level difference between two components results in weak electric field driving forces for interfacial charge transfer, which severely restricts the charge separation efficiency and the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Therefore, a well modified energy band alignment with lager interface potential difference is the key to promote S-scheme charge separation and enhance activity. In this regard, defect and doping engineering are considered to be effective in regulating energy band structure, boosting charge separation and optimizing active sites [13–15]. For instance, Fu et al., [16] fabricated an assembly of TiO2 ultrathin nanosheet with abundant surface point defects by hydrogenation treatment, this distortion of the surface lattice causes the decrease of band gap and the upshift of the conduction band, giving the photocatalyst a strong light absorption and effective charge transfer for photocatalytic reactions. Besides, Du et al., [17] reported that the N doping in ZnIn2S4 can induce an elevated Fermi level and energy band structure, thus providing more reductive photogenerated electrons for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Since TiO2 is known as the most promising material for practical applications in the field of photocatalysis because of its low cost, stability, and non-toxic feature [18,19]. In this context, it is highly meaningful to develop an efficient TiO2-based S-scheme heterojunction with smart design on band structure and interface potential difference according to the synergistic effect of defect and doping modification, leading to simultaneous promoted water reduction and oxidative dehydrogenation for hydrogen production. In addition, using oxygen defect and doping engineering for band structure and interface potential difference modification has not been reported yet in S-scheme heterojunction Here, we designed a S-scheme O-ZnIn2S4/TiO2- x (O-ZIS/TiO2- x ) heterojunction for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production by water reduction coupled with organic oxidative dehydrogenation for the first time. The coupled reaction system outperforms the pure water splitting and sacrificial reagent systems with superior H2 evolution activity. More importantly, based on the theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the oxygen defects in TiO2- x nanoparticles and oxygen doping in O-ZnIn2S4 nanosheets can synergistically tailor the energy band structure with higher redox potentials and much larger interface potential difference, leading to well promoted S-scheme interfacial charge transfer efficiency, and thus casting superior photocatalytic activity of the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. Further quenching and electron spin resonance experiments reveal that both water and organic aromatic molecules provide protons for H2 production. This work aims to provide new sights for enhancing photocatalytic H2 production performance in path of rational design of reaction system and photocatalysts."

3,Synthesis of oxygen vacancies modified TiO2 (TiO2-x ) nanoparticles,"2.2 Synthesis of oxygen vacancies modified TiO2 (TiO2-x ) nanoparticles The TiO2- x was prepared by a NaBH4 chemical reduction route [20,21] . In detail 4.0 g of TiO2 powder (commercial P25) and 2.0 g of NaBH4 were fully ground for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the ground powder was transferred into a porcelain boat with a lid and placed in a tube furnace, heated from room temperature to 380 °C under an Ar2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and then held at the designated temperature for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was simply washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times to remove unreacted NaBH4 and dried under vacuum at 60 °C to obtain dark blue TiO2- x ."

After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained products, labeled as O-ZnIn2S4 (O-ZIS), were collected by centrifugation, then washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in air. The procedure of the ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) is similar to that of the oxygen-doped ZnIn2S4, except that the raw material of TAA was added in solution with 1.6 mmol and without the addition of PVP."

7,Photocatalytic H2 generation by water reduction coupled with oxidative dehydrogenation,"2.6 Photocatalytic H2 generation by water reduction coupled with oxidative dehydrogenation The experiments of photocatalytic H2 generation by water reduction coupled with oxidative dehydrogenation were performed in a Pyrex top-irradiation photoreactor connected to a closed gas-circulation system and evacuation system (Prefectlight, LabSobar-IIIAG). Typically, 30 mg photocatalyst powder was added into 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 1 mL benzyl alcohol, and sonicated for 5 min. Subsequently, the system was evacuated to completely remove air and dissolved oxygen, then the solution was irradiated under 300 W Xe lamp (Prefectlight, PLS-SXE300C) with a 420 nm cut-off filter at 5 °C. The amount of produced hydrogen was in situ monitored by a Techcomp GC 7900 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector. The reaction solution was centrifuged to obtain the supernatant, and the production of benzaldehyde was detected by a separated gas chromatograph (FULI GC-9790 Plus). Meanwhile, photocatalytic H2 generation experiments with other organic reactants like p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-chlorobenzyl alcohol and m-methoxybenzyl alcohol were also conducted for oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
8,Photocatalytic H2 generation with TEOA or Na2SO3/Na2S,"2.7 Photocatalytic H2 generation with TEOA or Na2SO3/Na2S The reaction procedure was performed almost the same as that in 2.6 section, except for using 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S or 100 mL of deionized water/TEOA (4:1, V/V) mixture as a hole sacrificial agent."
9,DFT computational details,"2.8 DFT computational details All the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed via the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package (VASP), and the projector-augmented plane wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used for the elements involved. The projector augmented wave used to describe electron–ion interaction with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) of functional for exchange correlation energy. The cut off energy and Gaussian smearing width were respectively set to 500 eV and 0.05 eV. The electronic energy was considered self-consistent when the energy change was smaller than 10-6 eV and the geometry optimization was considered convergent until the forces on all atoms were smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The slabs were used to module the TiO2 (101) surface structure and the mono-layer structure of ZnIn2S4. In order to avoid the effect of periodic mirroring, a vacuum region of > 15 Å was add in the Z direction of the slab. In this paper, we applied GGA + U method to properly calculate the electronic structure of the TiO2 (101) surface and the mono-layer structure of ZnIn2S4. For the DFT + U calculations, we used the value of U = 6.2 eV for 3d states of Ti elements, and the value of U = 10.5 eV for 3d states of Zn elements."
10,Results and discussion,
11,"Morphology, crystal structure and composition","3.1 Morphology, crystal structure and composition The microstructure and morphology of obtained photocatalysts were directly observed by TEM, SEM, AFM and EDX-mapping. As shown in Fig. S1a and Fig. 1 a, the catalysts of TiO2 and TiO2- x present a typical cage-like nanoparticle structure with a size of about 50–60 nm, the morphology and particle size did not change before and after NaBH4 treatment, and it is consistent with their SEM images (Fig. S2a-b). Meanwhile, the HRTEM images of TiO2 (Fig. S1b) and TiO2- x (Fig. 1b) show a lattice plane distance with 0.35 nm, which can be assigned to the anatase TiO2 (101) plane. However, compared with pristine TiO2, the lattice fringes of TiO2- x appear fuzzy and disordered regions, suggesting that TiO2 is reduced by active-hydrogen decomposed from NaBH4 at high temperature [20,24–26]. Besides, ZIS exhibits a nanoflower structure (Fig. S1c and Fig.S2c). However, when PVP was added in the hydrothermal synthesis process, the stacking of the O-ZIS layered structure was weakened. A morphology of ultrathin nanosheets can be observed for O-ZIS catalysts (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2d), and the thickness of the obtained O-ZIS nanosheets was tested to be 2.4–2.8 nm by AFM image (Fig. S3) [27]. This flexible ultrathin 2D nanostructure of O-ZIS can ensure the easy contact with TiO2- x nanoparticle and have fast in-plane charge transfer capabilities, which could potentially promote photoexcited charge carriers transfer to reach the interface of the heterojunction [28]. Moreover, as exhibited in Fig. 1d and Fig. S1d, the interplanar crystal spacing of 0.33 nm is assigned to the (100) plane of O-ZIS. Different from the clear and continuous lattice fringes of ZIS sample, the blurred and discontinued lattice fringes of O-ZIS indicate the existence of structure distortion after oxygen doping. Meanwhile, the STEM and corresponding EDX element mapping images of O-ZIS (Fig. S4) directly confirm the uniform distribution of O element in O-ZIS nanosheets, which could be attributed to the substitution of surface S atoms by O atoms in the solvent under the presence of the PVP surfactant [22]. Furthermore, the SEM and TEM images of the synthesized O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction were displayed in Fig. 1e-f and Fig. S2e, the TiO2- x nanoparticles are tightly attached to the O-ZIS nanosheets, which assembled together under the electrostatic attraction as proved by zeta potential (Fig. S5). The STEM and elemental mapping images (Fig. 1g-l) also showed the well-defined spatial distribution of Ti, O, Zn, In and S elements in the nanocomposite, further proving the successful synthesis of O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. Besides, the BET test of the samples were also conducted, the results well matched with their structural characteristics (Fig. S6 and Table S1). The crystal structures of obtained photocatalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As illustrated in Fig. 2 a-b and Fig. S7, the diffraction peaks of TiO2 and TiO2- x are assigned to a mixture of anatase (PDF NO. 02–0406) and rutile (PDF NO. 88–1174). While the peak of TiO2- x at 25.4° is slightly weaker and wide, which may be related to the occurrence of crystal lattice deformation and the formation of surface oxygen vacancies [29,30]. Besides, the diffraction peaks of prepared ZIS are well indexed to the standard spectrum of hexagonal phase ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No. 65–2023). Notably, the diffraction peak at 27.8° of the O-ZIS (100) plane is obviously wider and gradually shifts towards higher degree in comparison to the undoped ZIS sample. This originates from the substitution of doped oxygen with sulfur, which can reduce the crystal radius and d-spacing because of the smaller ionic radius of O2– [23,31]. In the XRD pattern of O-ZIS/TiO2- x nanocomposite, the main diffraction peaks are matched with TiO2- x , while the wide peak feature and signal positions in the range of 27.0° ∼ 30.4° and 46.3° ∼ 49.0° demonstrates the existence of O-ZIS in the heterojunction. The compositions of oxygen vacancies in TiO2- x and doped oxygen in O-ZIS were further detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2c, no signal was found in pristineTiO2 nanoparticles, whilst TiO2- x and O-ZIS/TiO2- x present strong EPR signals at g = 2.002, attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies containing a single electron and surface Ti3+ [32,33]. Apart from which, as displayed in Fig. 2d-e, the two prominent peaks at 458.2 and 464.0 eV in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum of TiO2 are assigned to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, which are typical features of Ti4+ in TiO2. Besides, the peaks at 530.0 and 531.7 eV are ascribed to the lattice oxygen of TiO2 and the adsorbed oxygen on the surface [34]. After removing oxygen atoms by NaBH4 reduction, the increased electron cloud density causes the shift of Ti 2p peaks of TiO2- x to 458.0 and 463.8 eV with lower binding energy [24,32]. Moreover, the new weak peaks at 456.9, 462.7 and 531.2 eV in Ti 2p and O 1 s spectra of TiO2- x indicate the appearance of surface Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies [33,35,36], which is same for O-ZIS/TiO2- x and in accordance with the EPR results. And the little peak shift of the adsorbed oxygen in three samples is because of the different surface state after NaBH4 treatment. In addition, as presented in Fig. 2f, the peaks at 531.1 and 533.4 eV can be attributed to the hydroxyl and adsorbed water signal [22], respectively. Compared with the pristine ZIS, a new peak appears at 530.1 eV in the spectrum of O-ZIS, which is consistent with the binding energy of lattice oxygen (O2–) in the metal oxide, indicating that oxygen has been doped into ZnIn2S4 successfully by substituting sulfur atoms. The lattice O content in O-ZIS is about 6.1 mol% by the analysis of O atoms in XPS spectrum (Table S2). Meanwhile, in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p (Fig. 2g-i), ZIS and O-ZIS exhibit the same binding energies of In 3d, which indicates the stable structure of [In-S] layers during the doping process. However, it is worth noting that the binding energies of Zn 2p and S 2p states in O-ZIS shift to higher values compared to that in ZIS sample, which suggests that oxygen is doped into the [Zn-S] layer and causes the change of chemical environment due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen atom. The results provide confirming evidence for oxygen defects and doping modification in the prepared photocatalysts. Apart from which, the binding energies of Ti 2p and O 1 s spectra in O-ZIS/TiO2- x are obviously decreased in contrast to TiO2- x , while the corresponding binding energy of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p in O-ZIS/TiO2- x are increased compared with O-ZIS, which indicates a strong interaction between the two materials and electrons transfer from O-ZIS to TiO2- x . According to the above analyses and exposition, the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared successfully by defect and doping engineering."
12,Photocatalytic activity and stability for H2 production,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity and stability for H2 production The photocatalytic H2 production activities of all samples were evaluated under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), and the H2 production rate of water reduction coupled with benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidative dehydrogenation is firstly investigated as shown in Fig. 3 a and Fig. S8a. The pristine TiO2 exhibits a poor H2 evolution rate of 49.2 μmol g-1h−1 and benzaldehyde (BAD) production rate of 43.4 μmol g-1h−1. Meanwhile, the H2 and BAD production rates of ZIS are about 596.6 μmol g-1h−1 and 649.8 μmol g-1h−1, respectively. Upon the oxygen defects and doping modulation, the TiO2- x can deliver better H2 and BAD production rates of 153.4 μmol g-1h−1 and 190.2 μmol g-1h−1, which are 3.1 times and 4.4 times higher than those of TiO2. Correspondingly, the H2 and BAD production rates of O-ZIS are increased to 1319.6 μmol g-1h−1 and 1438.6 μmol g-1h−1, which are both 2.2 times higher than those of ZIS. Inspiringly, the O-ZIS/TiO2- x photocatalyst displays remarkably enhanced production rates of 2584.9 μmol g-1h−1 and 2880.5 μmol g-1h−1 for H2 and BAD generation, which are approximately 52.5 and 66.4 times as high as those over blank TiO2, respectively. Notably, O-ZIS/TiO2- x also outperforms ZIS/TiO2, O-ZIS/TiO2 or ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunctions with higher photocatalytic activity. These results further confirm the significant synergistic effect of defect and doping modification in O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. Meanwhile, as illustrated in Fig. 3b and Fig. S8b, the best loading amount of O-ZIS in O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction is tested to be 35 wt%. The photocatalytic H2 production has been further investigated under different conditions in oxidizing half-reaction for comparison (Fig. 3c and Table S3). Negligible H2 production is observed for pure water splitting owing to the limitation of oxygen evolution half-reaction. Besides, O-ZIS/TiO2- x displays the H2 production rates of 1125.8 μmol g-1h−1 and 1951.5 μmol g-1h−1 with existence of Na2SO3/Na2S and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial agents. To our delight, it is exciting to found that the H2 production by using BA is greater than that of the sacrificial agent systems, which indicates the advantage of oxidative dehydrogenation effect for efficient H2 production and its great potential to eliminate the use of sacrificing agent in photocatalysis. Moreover, taking this one-step further to couple photocatalytic dehydrogenation of different aromatic alcohols (m-methoxybenzyl alcohol, p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-chlorobenzyl alcohol and p-methoxybenzyl alcohol) have also been attempted. As shown in Fig. 3d, it can be observed that O-ZIS/TiO2- x still maintains excellent photocatalytic H2 and aldehyde production when using different aromatic alcohols, and the photocatalytic activity is related to the molecular structure of reactants due to its different proton giving capacity [37,38]. As displayed in Table S3, it can be seen that the O-ZIS/TiO2- x nanocomposite in this study exhibits outstanding photocatalytic performance toward H2 production and BA oxidation compared with related references. The results indicate the great advantages and universality of our approach for photocatalytic H2 generation by coupling water reduction and organic oxidative dehydrogenation over O-ZIS/TiO2- x catalysts with defect and doping engineering. The stability and reusability of O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterostructure were evaluated by repetitive photocatalytic experiments. According to Fig. S9a, the H2 production performance of the O-ZIS/TiO2- x photocatalyst was stable enough during three cycle experiments, indicating the excellent activity stability during the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the catalyst used in the cycle test was further characterized by XRD, TEM and STEM, respectively. It can be observed that XRD patterns (Fig. S9b) of O-ZIS/TiO2- x sample display almost the same peaks before and after the cyclic experiment, and there is no obvious difference in the morphology of O-ZIS/TiO2- x (Fig. S9c-e), which implies the sufficient structure stability of the as-prepared photocatalyst."
13,Optical properties and energy band structure modulation,"3.3 Optical properties and energy band structure modulation The influence of oxygen defect and doping engineering for optical absorption properties of the prepared photocatalysts was evaluated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the pure TiO2 exhibits a 425 nm absorption edge with almost no absorption for visible light. However, the corresponding UV–vis spectrum of TiO2- x clearly depicts a widely absorption from the ultraviolet to visible and near infrared region, indicating that the oxygen vacancy can greatly enhance the light capture ability of TiO2- x across the solar spectral wavelength range [39]. Besides, the absorption edge of O-ZIS is obviously extended from 560 nm to 590 nm compared with ZIS as a result of oxygen doping for band gap modulation. As expected, after combining the O-ZIS with TiO2- x , the O-ZIS/TiO2- x nanocomposite shows the optimal absorption intensity in full-spectrum region, which is also in agreement with the color change of the corresponding samples. According to the above photocatalytic experiments, it is found that photocatalytic H2 evolution activity is closely related to the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction construction and synergistic effect of oxygen defect and doping. Besides, it is well known that the energy band structure is an important factor for the improvement of catalytic activity, thus the analyses of the energy band alignment and the corresponding changes become the key to reveal the enhancement mechanism of O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the band gaps of TiO2, TiO2- x , ZIS and O-ZIS are calculated to be 3.3, 3.2, 2.5 and 2.4 eV, respectively, according to the formula of αhv = A(hν﹣E g)n/2 [40], respectively. Besides, the related valence band potentials (E VB) of TiO2, TiO2- x , ZIS and O-ZIS are measured by XPS-VB characterization (Fig. 4c), which are estimated to be 2.95, 2.95, 1.73 and 1.25 eV, respectively. Therefore, the corresponding conduction band positions (E CB) can be calculated to be −0.35, −0.25, −0.77 and −1.15 eV. The relative energy band alignment of photocatalysts were drawn in Fig. 4f and i. It can be found that the oxygen defect and doping can not only decrease the band gaps for extending light response range, but also change the energy band position with stronger redox potential. Moreover, in order to clarify the effect of oxygen vacancies and doping on electronic band structure, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further employed. The corresponding structural model, calculated band structure and density of states (DOS) were displayed in Fig. S10 and Fig. 4d-i. An increased DOS at the edge of TiO2- x conduction band can be observed compared to that of TiO2, and a defect level of oxygen vacancy is introduced at the bottom of the CBM, thus causing the downshift of conduction band position for TiO2- x . On the contrary, the existence of O orbital by doping is contributed to the VBM of O-ZIS, resulting in the upshift of valence band position, which has been detected by XPS-VB. As a result, increased valence band width and elevated reduction potential of conduction band is obtained for O-ZIS, which is beneficial for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Therefore, the oxygen defect and doping exhibit great influence on the energy band structure of photocatalysts and will promote the S-scheme interfacial charge transfer as discussed below."
14,Charge transfer mechanism for S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2-x heterojunction,"3.4 Charge transfer mechanism for S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2-x heterojunction The successful construction of S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction with strong interface driving force is extremely important for effective charge separation and efficient photocatalytic redox activity. In this regard, the Fermi level (EF) difference between two components was firstly investigated by DFT calculations and Mott-Schottky tests. As shown in the Table 1 , the calculated work function of TiO2- x (7.240 eV) is enlarged than that of TiO2 (7.175 eV), and the work function of O-ZIS (6.546 eV) is decreased than that of ZIS (6.654 eV), which is consistent with the above changes in energy band structures. It is worth noting that O-ZIS exhibits a smaller work function than that of TiO2- x , which means the EF of O-ZIS is higher than that of the TiO2- x . This variation trend was also confirmed by Mott-Schottky tests (Fig. 5 ), the flat-band potentials (Efb) of TiO2, TiO2- x , ZIS and O-ZIS were determined to be −0.45, −0.38, −0.64 and −0.76 V, respectively, which is in accord with the result of theoretical calculation. It is well known that the Efb can be approximated to EF for the n-type semiconductors [41], hence the O-ZIS has a higher Fermi level than TiO2- x . More importantly, as illustrated in Scheme 1 , owing to the defect and doping engineer, a larger EF interface potential difference of 0.694 eV between TiO2- x and O-ZIS is formed compared with the original EF difference of 0.521 eV between TiO2 and ZIS, which can promote the interfacial charge transfer efficiency with stronger driving force. The charge density difference at the heterojunction interface of O-ZIS/TiO2- x is simulated and shown in Fig. 6 a, where the yellow and blue regions indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. This calculation visually indicates that electrons migrate from O-ZIS toward TiO2- x to induce a space-charge region between the heterojunction. Actually, this phenomenon has already been proved in the XPS results. Obvious negative shifts of bind energy were observed in Ti 2p and O 1 s high-resolution XPS spectra, while Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p of O-ZIS/TiO2- x show larger binding energy than that of O-ZIS, confirming the electrons transfer from O-ZIS to TiO2- x . This behavior is intuitively displayed in the illustration of Scheme 1. Owing to the large EF potential difference and higher Fermi level of O-ZIS, spontaneous charge transfer happens at the interface. The electrons are accumulated near the TiO2- x side, while holes are accumulated near the O-ZIS side. Then the energy bands of TiO2- x will bend upward, while the energy bands of O-ZIS will bend downward until reaching a new EF equilibrium, inducing a strong built-in electric field with direction from O-ZIS to TiO2- x , which will provide intensive driving force for the S-scheme photogenerated charge separation in the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. In order to further confirm the S-scheme charge transfer route of photo-generated electrons and holes in the O-ZIS/TiO2- x photocatalyst under irradiation, the samples were subjected to surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement, in-situ XPS and photo-deposition experiments [42]. As shown in Fig. 6b, all samples generate positive SPV signals after illumination, TiO2- x and O-ZnIn2S4 exhibit a higher signal intensity compared with TiO2 and ZnIn2S4, indicating the increased concentration of surface photogenerated holes. However, the signal intensity of O-ZIS/TiO2- x is weaker and the peak shape is similar to that of O-ZIS, which suggests that the photoexcited electrons in TiO2- x transfer to the surface of O-ZIS, and it is in line with the charge transfer model of the S-scheme heterojunction. The in-situ XPS spectra of O-ZIS/TiO2- x under darkness and ultraviolet light illumination were further conducted. As revealed in Fig. 6c-e and Fig. S11, after light irradiation, the binding energies of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p are negatively shifted by 0.6, 0.3 and 0.4 eV relative to the darkness. Conversely, the binding energies of Ti 2p and O 1 s are positively shifted by 0.4 and 0.3 eV, respectively. The anastrophic shift of binding energies proved that the photoexcited electrons in TiO2- x transferred to O-ZnIn2S4 under light irradiation, supporting the S-scheme charge transfer route. Moreover, as depicted in Fig. S12-13, the Pt nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the surface of O-ZIS nanosheets under irradiation, and the MnO x nanoparticles are selectively deposited on the surface of TiO2- x , the results convincingly confirm that O-ZIS and TiO2- x work as the reductive and oxidative active sites in photocatalytic reactions, respectively. Therefore, according to the theoretical analyses and experimental results, the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction is proved to display a S-scheme charge transfer mechanism as illustrated in Scheme 1. Under photoexcitation, O-ZIS and TiO2- x are excited to produce photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of TiO2- x and holes in the VB of O-ZIS are inclined to recombine at the interface under the attraction of built-in electric field, band bending, and coulombic attraction [43,44]. Consequently, the powerful photogenerated electrons in CB of O-ZIS with stronger reducibility are preserved to engage in protons reduction for H2 evolution, and the remaining photogenerated holes in VB of TiO2- x are consumed in the organic oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. Meanwhile, owing to the modification of oxygen defect and doping, a stronger electric field is formed for driving interface charge transfer more efficiently, and higher reductive and oxidative potentials can be achieved, thus resulting in the strongest photocatalytic redox properties of the O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction. Except the strong redox ability, the promoted charge kinetics efficiency is another advantage for S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. The facilitation of photogenerated charge separation efficiency was further examined by PL spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response as shown in Fig. 7 . Obvious decrease of PL intensity and remarkable enhanced photocurrent can be observed according to the defect and doping engineering and S-scheme heterojunctions construction. Especially, O-ZIS/TiO2- x exhibits minimum PL intensity and maximum photocurrent compared to monomer catalysts, O-ZIS/TiO2 and ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunctions, which confirms its superior charge separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes owing to the existence of strong interface electric field with large driving force. Meanwhile, the results are in agreement with the photocatalytic H2 production activity, it is suggested that the construction of S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction based on band structure and interface potential difference modulation can significantly improve photogenerated charge separation, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance."
15,Proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanism,"3.5 Proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanism In order to get insightful understanding on the molecular conversion mechanism of H2 evolution and organic oxidative dehydrogenation over O-ZIS/TiO2- x photocatalyst, several control experiments were performed. Herein, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), triethanolamine (TEOA), and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were used as quenchers for photogenerated electrons (e-), holes (h+) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), respectively [8]. As shown in Fig. 8 a, when 5 mmol/L CCl4 is added into the reaction system, the H2 production is in a decline from 2584.9 μmol g-1h−1 to 924.5 μmol g-1h−1, this implies that photogenerated electrons are the major active species for the reduction of protons to H2. Meanwhile, the yield of BAD is increased significantly due to the rapid removal of photogenerated electrons, which allows more photogenerated holes to survive and participate in the oxidation reaction of BA. Besides, when 1 mL TEOA is added to quench photogenerated holes, a noticeable inhibition for BAD production (614.1 μmol g-1h−1) can be observed, demonstrating that photogenerated holes are responsible for the oxidation reaction of BA to BAD. Additionally, the addition of TBA has a negligible influence on the production of benzaldehyde, which excludes the oxidation pathway of benzyl alcohol by •OH. To further reveal the dehydrogenation process of benzyl alcohol, we used the acetonitrile (MeCN) as the reaction solvent instead of deionized water. It can be found that the BAD production almost has no change, but H2 production is seriously decreased owing to the lack of protons from water, which indicates that the H2 evolution mainly comes from water reduction. However, it still has a H2 yield of 632.2 μmol g-1h−1, confirming that part of hydrogen is derived from the dehydrogenation process of benzyl alcohol. In addition, the carbon-centered free radical intermediates in the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol were further detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trapping agent. As depicted in Fig. 8b, no EPR signal is detected under dark condition, but there is an evident response after 5 min light irradiation. The six EPR signal peaks with similar intensity can be classified as •CH(OH)Ph free radicals [45], confirming that the BA oxidation occurs via α-H dehydrogenation mechanism. Importantly, it can be observed that the EPR signal intensity of O-ZIS/TiO2- x is much stronger than that of TiO2- x , which suggests that more •CH(OH)Ph free radicals can be generated by O-ZIS/TiO2- x in the photocatalytic reaction, and it is consistent with the results of photocatalytic performance. Based on the above analyses, a probable reaction mechanism for hydrogen production by water reduction coupled with oxidative dehydrogenation over S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction was proposed in Scheme 2 . Owing to the synergistic effect of oxygen defect and doping engineering, the energy band structure and interface potential difference of O-ZIS and TiO2- x are tailored, the light absorption and charge separation efficiency of O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction are remarkably promoted, and O-ZIS/TiO2- x exhibits an efficient S-scheme charge transfer mechanism with stronger interface driving force, all of which are beneficial for photocatalytic activity. During the photocatalytic reaction, the S-scheme charge transfer can hold more separated photogenerated electrons of O-ZIS and holes of TiO2- x with highest redox potential. Subsequently, the C–H bond at the α position of benzyl alcohol is oxidized and broken by photogenerated holes of TiO2- x , forming a •CH(OH)Ph free radical and H+. Then, the hydroxyl in •CH(OH)Ph can be further oxidized and fractured to produce an additional H+. As a result, benzaldehyde is produced after electron rearrangement, and the protons from water and the abstracted protons from BA are reduced by photogenerated electrons of O-ZIS to produce H2. Consequently, benzyl alcohol oxidation has excellent hole consumption capacity and dehydrogenation capacity, which can provide more photogenerated electrons and hydrogen protons for the reduction reaction, thus resulting in better H2 production than Na2SO3/Na2S and triethanolamine sacrificial systems."
16,Conclusion,"In summary, a well-design S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction was successfully constructed for photocatalytic hydrogen production by water reduction coupled with organic oxidative dehydrogenation for the first time. Based on the DFT calculations and series of characterizations, the oxygen vacancies in TiO2- x and doped oxygen in O-ZIS can synergistically tailor the energy band alignment of heterojunction with higher redox potentials and larger Fermi level potential difference. The O-ZIS/TiO2- x heterojunction was proved to display an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism with superior charge separation efficiency. Thanks to these advantages, the S-scheme O-ZIS/TiO2- x hybrid can significantly promote the photocatalytic transformation of water and aromatic alcohols to produce hydrogen and value-added aldehydes. Finally, it was found that both protons from water and abstracted protons from benzyl alcohol contribute to the production of H2. This work proposes to provide a new effective strategy for high-performance photocatalytic hydrogen production through reaction path optimization and rational photocatalysts design."
