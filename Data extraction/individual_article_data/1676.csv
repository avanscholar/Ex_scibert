0,Introduction,"Clean and renewable energy resources are increasingly important to deal with global issues of energy shortage and environmental deterioration (Chen et al., 2022). Among diverse alternative renewable and clean energy sources, hydrogen (H2) is considered as the most up-and-coming green fuel owing to its sustainability, high energy potential, and conversion efficiency, as 1 kg of H2 contains the energy of about 120 MJ, surpassing most traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels (Chen et al., 2021; Sarkar et al., 2021). More importantly, the major by-product is only water after energy consumption (Ma et al., 2021). Hydrogen can be produced by different approaches such as thermochemical conversion of solid fuels or natural gas, green chemical reactions, and water hydrolysis or electrolysis (Mona et al., 2020). It is important to guarantee economic feasibility, low energy consumption, and carbon neutrality for sustainable production of H2 (Anto et al., 2020). Currently, 95% of industrial accumulated H2 derives from the traditional reforming and non-reforming transformation techniques (Balachandar et al., 2020). Although most commercial H2 production technologies are based on thermochemical processes, they usually involve substantial fossil fuel consumption and require combining H2 production with carbon capture and storage to guarantee the target of carbon neutrality, therefore, the biological pathways of H2 production attract high attention (Balachandar et al., 2020). Biohydrogen is produced by biological methods, involving a variety of microorganisms, for example, dark fermentative bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, and green microalgae in diverse metabolic pathways (Bhatia et al., 2020). In recent years, a number of green systems have concentrated on microalgae to produce energy (Limongi et al., 2021). Microalgae have higher environmental tolerance, growth rate, and biomass production compared to conventional energy crops (Xie et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021). Accordingly, microalgae were initially introduced as potential alternative sources for fossil fuels in the 1970s amidst the gas shortage (Li et al., 2008). Microalgae are of high interest in the generation of biohydrogen owing to high biomass production, high lipid content, high flue gas (CO2 and NOx) bioremediation, adaptability to variable water sources, and no competition with arable land (Zhang et al., 2018; Ubando et al., 2021). Furthermore, biological H2 generation was first noted by Gaffron (1939) in green microalgae. Recently, some other strains of green microalgae, for example, Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii, have been subsequently evidenced on capacity of H2 production (Fan et al., 2016). Biological H2 has received high attention as clean and sustainable fuel energy for carbon neutrality and nature sustainability (El-Dalatony et al., 2020a). However, its application is still limited at present because of some bottlenecks such as distribution, capture, storage, and transformation techniques which inhibit industrial processes for biohydrogen generation. In the open literature, many studies are focusing on biohydrogen production (Azwar et al., 2014; Usman et al., 2021). However, there is a knowledge gap in the mechanism of algal biohydrogen production. Besides, the rapid development of new technologies has led to a sharply rising flow of new data that supply novel understanding into the evolution and diversity of algal biohydrogen. Thus, this review aimed to summarize the latest information on the production of biohydrogen from microalgae, focusing on clarifying the mechanism of H2 generation from microalgae, the potential algal strains for H2 generation and enzymes involved in H2 generation, factors affecting the proportion of H2 production and advanced technologies for biohydrogen production. In addition, the challenges and perspectives in current H2 generation from microalgae are highly emphasized through this review."
1,The mechanism of H2 production from microalgae,"Algal H2 production can be achieved directly or indirectly, depending on sunlight, or by the fermentation process and thermochemical techniques through biomass conversion (as described in Fig. 1 A) (Limongi et al., 2021). For instance, anaerobic H2 generation in green microalgae of C. Reinhardtii can be normally divided into three different pathways: fermentation pathway associated with carbohydrate catabolism, as well as two specific photosystem related pathways of photosystem II (PSII)-independence and PSII-dependent (Posewitz et al., 2009). To further elaborate, four main biohydrogen production mechanisms by microalgae have been discussed in detail as follows."
2,Direct biophotolysis,"2.1 Direct biophotolysis In a direct biophotolysis system, microalgae can transfer solar energy into chemical energy (direct biophotolysis from water): 2H2O + light energy → 2H2 + O2 (Fig. 1B). The reaction was first proved with an acellular chloroplast-ferredoxin-hydrogenase process, although this reaction was earlier proposed in green microalgae (Benemann et al., 1973). In brief, direct biophotolysis is an essentially transitional reaction in green microalgae, which generally occurs for only a short period of time, the light energy fixed by PSI and PSII reduces H2O by transferring electrons to ferredoxin, thus embarking on oxygenic photosynthesis to produce H2 (Benemann, 2000). This accounts for the H2 “burst” observed in the first few minutes after shining light on dark anaerobic cultures. The advantage of this process is environmentally accessible and highly available in nature, for example, as an energy source, sunlight does not accumulate CO2 and high solar energy efficiency is more than 80% (Mona et al., 2020). However, it is still a long-term process for practical application owing to the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase reactions and complex uncontrollable pathways, as it has been for the past 50 years (Mona et al., 2020)."
3,Indirect biophotolysis,"2.2 Indirect biophotolysis To avoid the difficulty of O2 inhibition in direct biophotolysis, so-called “indirect biophotolysis” process has been explored, where CO2 is first fixed into carbohydrates and then used in separate steps to generate H2: 6H2O + 6CO2 + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (Fig. 1C) (Benemann, 2000). Sustained H2 production was demonstrated in indirect biophotolysis, where two-stage processes were used for the transitory segregation of H2 evolution and photosynthesis (Nagarajan et al., 2020b). For example, the first stage is photosynthesis and production of biomass, and in the second stage, sulfur-deficient C. reinhardtii subsidized with acetate can maintain H2 segregation for several days until the negative effects of sulfur consumption begin to emerge (Melis et al., 2000). Therefore, indirect biophotolysis processes include the divorce of H2 and O2 evolution reactions into different stages, coupled via CO2 fixation and evolution (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Although it was initially claimed that this was an indirect biophotolysis process, this is actually a direct biophotolysis process, with respiratory absorption of the O2 produced (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). The development of microalgae in the first stage is influenced by various parameters, such as light, temperature, pH, nutrients, carbon source, and type of bioreactor (Rashid et al., 2013). These factors are also equally significant in the second stage. It was found that transient H2 generation and adverse effects of sulfur deprivation lead to low H2 yield (Nagarajan et al., 2020b). High-yield indirect biophotolysis may be feasible if the light transformation efficiency could achieve 10–15% (Show et al., 2019). Furthermore, the amount of accumulated biomass during the growth phase could also limit the indirect biophotolysis H2 generation from microalgae (Corrêa et al., 2017)."
4,Photo fermentation,"2.3 Photo fermentation The efficiency of direct H2 production from microalgae is low, and to conquer this drawback, researchers have investigated the application of algal biomass and residual algal biomass as raw materials for microbial fermentation to generate biohydrogen: CH3COOH + 2H2O + light → 4H2 + 2CO2 (Fig. 1D) (Bhatia et al., 2020). Hydrogen through the biological route can be generated via light-driven fermentation process. Light facilitates the microalgae to produce energy through photosynthesis, thus avoiding pyruvate degradation and restricted problems of respiratory ATP generation. Photo fermentation only occurs in the presence of light. Tapping on light energy, electrons are extracted by photo catabolism of organic substrate coupled with the metabolism of oxidative carbon (Show et al., 2019). The efficiency calculations of photoconversion to H2 normally show values of nearly 100%, but these evaluations usually neglect the energy content of the organic substrates (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). In the ideal (low) light conditions, the practical photosynthesis efficiency is much lower. Although hydrogenases are present in photosynthetic microorganisms, the photoproduction of H2 by these microorganisms is mainly by nitrogenase (Basak and Das, 2007)."
5,Dark fermentation,"2.4 Dark fermentation Biohydrogen generation from organic substrates is of interest as a promising method in the development of sustainable energy (Zhang et al., 2021b). In contrast to the above approaches where energy comes from sunlight, microalgae can also produce H2 anaerobically via dark conversion of organic substrates without sunlight (Show et al., 2019). Fermentative routes significantly differ in light and darkness and the information has been tabulated in Table 1 . During dark fermentation, the involved organic substances are converted via diverse stages (Fig. 1E), e.g., hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis (Show et al., 2019). Dark fermentation for H2 production has attracted additional attention because of its advantages of high energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and favorable carbon balance. However, it is important to enhance biological activity as well as improve electron transfer of the microbial fermentation to avoid the kinetic and thermodynamic constrains of the microbial anaerobic fermentation reactions (Cheng et al., 2020). Recently, some researches have illustrated that biohydrogen generation can be dramatically enhanced with the presence of metal or metallic oxide nanoparticles (NPs), e.g., Ni0, Fe0, Fe2O3, and NiO, considering they may improve the bioactivity of ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase as well as electron transfer (Gadhe et al., 2015). Additionally, it is required to pretreat the substrate before anaerobic fermentation to increase H2 production. Pretreatment techniques for substrates, such as physical (bead milling, ultrasonication, microwave, pulse electric field, hydrodynamic cavitation), chemical, thermal (autoclaving, steam explosion, freeze thaw, hydrothermal treatment), biological pretreatment (enzymatic hydrolysis, bacterial enzymes, fungal enzymes), and combinative of those, have demonstrated to be effective for improving H2 yields (Mandotra et al., 2021). For example, acid-hydrogen peroxide induced microwave (AHMW) strategy could improve disintegration, biohydrogen production by Ulva reticulate of 92.5 mL H2/g COD was obtained in AHMW pretreatment (Dinesh Kumar et al., 2019)."
6,Summary of potential microalgae for H2 production,"Microalgae are attractive in H2 production because of their autotrophic, fast growth rate, and environmental sustainability (Tan et al., 2020). Previous work by Kessler (1974) summarized the capacity of many algal species to generate molecular H2. As shown in Table 2 , diverse microalgae have the potential to generate biohydrogen including Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., Monoraphidium sp., Platymonas sp., Anabaena sp., Tetraspora sp., Coelastrella sp., Micractinium sp., and Chlamydomonas sp. (Khetkorn et al., 2017; El-Dalatony et al., 2020a). In total, promising green microalgae are Botryococcus, Chlorella, Chlamydomonas, Chlorococcum, Scenedesmes. Besides, favorable cyanobacteria are Synechocystis, Anabaena, Synechococcus. Additionally, Nostoc are some advantageous candidates of organisms containing hydrogenase (Deviram et al., 2020). In the following parts, biohydrogen produced from green microalgae and cyanobacteria have been discussed, respectively. Green microalgae have high potential as a source of renewable fuels (Wang et al., 2017a, 2017b). However, there had only about 70 species from more than 30 genera been studied since the finding of green microalgae producing H2 in the 1930s (Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020). Among diverse microalgae, Chlorella sp. was the most favorable for a high H2 production potential ranging from 6.1 to 31.2 mL H2/g microalgae (Lin and Shei, 2008), such as the species of C. vulgaris var. vulgaris, C. pyrenoidosa, C. sorokiniana, C. fusca, C. lewinii, C. homosphaera, C. protothecoides, C. salina, Parachlorella kessleri, and C. vacuolate (Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020). Moreover, C. reinhardtii is a model microalgae to investigate H2 metabolism in photosynthetic eukaryotes, apart from Scenedesmus obliquus and C. fusca for H2 generation. For example, Tsygankov et al. (2006) revealed that in the absence of acetate or any other organic substrates in the medium, sulfur-deprived C. reinhardtii could produce H2 continuously (56.4 mL/L culture) under strictly photoautotrophic conditions. It is noted that a high-yield H2 rate could be detected for short periods of time in the light (Khetkorn et al., 2017). For instance, in the cultivation of dark-adapted C. vulgaris, the H2 production rate reached the maximum value within 2.5 s after presenting cells to light density of about 0.03 W/m2 as well as the kinetics model was linear for at least 1 min (Khetkorn et al., 2017). Although H2 generation in green microalgae is a short-term event, its H2 transformation performance is generally more efficient than that in cyanobacteria (Khetkorn et al., 2017). Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, e.g., cyanophytes or cyanophyceae, are also of interest in producing H2 and achieving oxygen-containing photosynthesis. More specifically, cyanobacteria are filamentous nitrogen organisms containing special cells named heterocyst (Mona et al., 2020). Anabaena, Calothrix, Nostoc, and Oscillatoria are classic nitrogen fixing genera. The anaerobic environment is supplied through the heterocysts for nitrogen fixation where H2 could be also produced, as shown in Equation (1). The ability for H2 production in cyanobacteria was initially founded in an Anabaena sp. in the late 19th century. As pointed out by Malek Shahkouhi and Motamedian (2020), although the genus Anabena has attracted interest in its biohydrogen production during nitrogen fixation, its metabolic models have not yet been utilized to further study the production of biohydrogen. Even so, A. variabilis ATCC 29413 is one of the highest H2 yield microalgae in cyanobacteria and has been a popular candidate for generating biohydrogen products (Tiwari and Pandey, 2012). In addition, although H2 generation in cyanobacteria has been disclosed to enhance effectively under nitrogen starvation owing to stimulated heterocyst development, there is no close relationship between heterocyst frequency and H2 production (Mona et al., 2011). Furthermore, H2 is also generated through a few non-nitrogen fixing genera of cyanobacteria viz., Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Gloebacter, which possess two different categories of hydrogenases with numerous functions and properties (Mona et al., 2020). (1) N2 + 8e− + 8H+ +16ATP → 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP +16Pi"
7,Hydrogen synthesizing enzymes in microalgae,"Each biohydrogen generation approach bases on the hydrogen-producing enzymes formed inside the distinctive microorganism (Mathews and Wang, 2009). Hydrogenase and nitrogenases are the two major enzymes that participated in biohydrogen generation from various microalgae (Bhatia et al., 2020). Another enzyme associated with H2 metabolism is the Hup uptake hydrogenase, which absorbs H2 rather than produces H2 (Wang et al., 2020b). This review only describes hydrogenase and nitrogenase, and mainly focuses on the biosynthesis and localization of these two enzymes in microalgae. More information on other hydrogen-producing enzymes could refer to a previous review on the challenges of biohydrogen from microalgae (Show et al., 2019)."
8,Hydrogenase,"4.1 Hydrogenase Hydrogenase, a crucial enzyme of the H2 production pathways, catalyzes proton reduction to H2: 2H++2e− ↔ H2, acts as the eventual electron acceptor without O2. Currently, the gene of hydrogenase has been found in the Chlorococcales and Volvocales (Chlorophyceae), for example, S. obliquus, C. moewusii, C. Reinhardtii, and C. fusca (Mona et al., 2020). Among oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms, only cyanobacteria and some genera of green microalgae (including Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, and Scenedesmus) have active hydrogenases (Petrova et al., 2020). Its enzyme maturity, activity, and structural variants can vary in different species. Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes with iron (Fe)-sulfur (S) clusters at the active sites for the reversible oxidation of electrons and protons (Nagarajan et al., 2020b). One of these contain the universal [2Fe–2S], [3Fe–4S], and [4Fe–4S] iron-sulfur clusters. These classical metal sites shuttle electrons between the H2 activation sites and the redox partners of hydrogenase (Vignais et al., 2001). Base on the metal composition present at the active site, the hydrogenase enzyme is divided into [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase, [Ni–Fe] hydrogenase, and the metal-free hydrogenase (Gadhe et al., 2015). As known, [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase catalyzes reversible H2 activation at very high rates by their unique prosthetic group (Fig. 2 A), which are attractive objectives of bioengineering efforts to combine microbial H2 production with aerobic photosynthesis. According to Swanson et al. (2015), the proton reduction reaction in [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase exists at a complicated bridged FeS cluster called the H cluster. The H cluster exists as a conventional [4Fe–4S] subcluster bridging to organometal 2Fe subclusters via protein cysteine thiolates. The 2Fe subcluster is coordinated by particular non-protein ligands containing CO, CN, and dithiomethylamine (Swanson et al., 2015). As reported by Azwar et al. (2014), [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenases contain the center of various metals, such as Ni–Fe bimetallic active sites, Mg2+ ions, and iron-sulfur. As shown in Fig. 2B, the bidirectional [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenase of cyanobacteria contains five subunits. The Large one is the center of the catalytic subunit of pentameric hydrogenase HoxH, and it contains Ni and Fe atoms related to the ligands CO and CN, as well as sulfur atoms. While the small subunit hydrogenase, HoxY, consists of a cluster [4Fe–4S] that needs to transport electrons to the large catalytic subunit. For the remaining three subunits that compose part of the complex are HoxF diaphorase, HoxU, and HoxE, respectively, working together in the role of an electron channel between the NAD(P)H and the active sites of hydrogenase. In summary, [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenases are efficient H2 producers while [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenases are more proficient in H2 oxidation (Lu and Koo, 2019). Reduced ferredoxin from PSI is applied to transfer electrons decomposed from the carbohydrate straightforwardly to the active site of the [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenase (Posewitz et al., 2004). While, [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenases produce H2, which can also be used as uptake hydrogenases, using the electrons from H2 and applying them to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)) (Mathews and Wang, 2009). The algal [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase plays a major role in light fermentation, which is manifested by the vigorous increase in H2 release after illumination. In addition, many [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenases are reversibly repressed by O2 and could be reactivated after O2 elimination (Lu and Koo, 2019). In contrast, [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenases are even irreversibly inactivated by a small amount of O2 (Kubas et al., 2017). As previously reported (Horner et al., 2002), the most powerful hydrogen-producing enzymes are [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenases, which have an activity nearly 10–100 times better than [Ni–Fe]-hydrogenases and 1000 times better than nitrogenases."
9,Nitrogenases,"4.2 Nitrogenases Nitrogenase is a two-component protein structure that applies low-potential electrons derived from reduced flavodoxin or ferredoxin and MgATP (2ATP/e−) to reduce various substrates (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002), especially in the presence of N2 gas. In the midst of microalgae, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) are the only with these enzymes because of the existence of specialized cells called heterocyst. Hydrogen generation by these enzymes is an irreversible reaction that hydrolyzes at least 4 ATP for each H2 produced, which could result in a lower energy reaction efficiency (Benemann, 1997). As reported by Hallenbeck and Benemann (2002), in the absence of any other substrates, nitrogenase continues to convert, reducing protons to H2. This is the foundation for producing H2 based on nitrogenase systems. At each cycle, MgATP complexed Fe-protein combined with MoFe-protein, and 2ATP are hydrolyzed with the transmission of one electron to MoFe-protein and the involved dissociations (Hallenbeck and Benemann, 2002). Considering the low turnover number, a large amount of input energy is essential for biosynthesis and necessity for ATP for catalysis. In total, nitrogenase is not a very efficient metabolic approach to generate H2. Considering that O2 is a by-product of photosynthesis, organisms containing nitrogenase have advanced the following space-time methods to preserve the enzyme from inactivation by O2: (1) cyanobacteria containing heterocyst physically divide O2 evolution from nitrogenase activity by separating oxygenic photosynthetic activity in algal cells and nitrogenase activity in heterocysts with reduced permeability of O2; (2) non-heterocystous cyanobacteria divide O2-evolution from nitrogenase activity via displaying these functions in the course of light and dark periods, respectively (Ghirardi et al., 2000)."
10,Biosynthesis and localization of enzymes in microalgae,"4.3 Biosynthesis and localization of enzymes in microalgae Hydrogenases are encoded in the nucleus of the unicellular green microalgae (Florin et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the mature proteins lie in the chloroplast stroma and function (Melis and Happe, 2001). The structural genes of algal hydrogenases are normally represented by several paralogues (Petrova et al., 2020), for example, the HYDA1 and HYDA2 genes in C. Reinhardtii, which encode two enzymes with similar structures and have different contributions to H2 generation (Forestier et al., 2003). HYDA1 is a 49 kDa protein with 497 amino acids, while HYDA2 encodes a 49 kDa protein containing 505 amino acids with a similarity of 73% to HYDA1 (Wang et al., 2020b). RNA silencing of hydrogenase indicated that HYDA1 catalyzes in vitro hydrogenase activity, but there is no evidence that HYDA2 plays a substantial role in microalgae H2 production (Godman et al., 2010). In another study, Meuser et al. (2012) demonstrated that HYDA1 is the main hydrogenase, representing 75% of H2 segregation, while HYDA2 is an auxiliary hydrogenase, representing about 25% of H2 segregation. It was found that [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase is highly sensitive to molecular oxygen and requires hypoxia conditions to maintain high performance as reported in a previous study (Meuser et al., 2012). In general, molecular oxygen generally inhibits hydrogenase activity in microalgae by restraining the expression of the HYD genes and enzyme maturation, and by inhibiting catalytic sites. In addition, as reported by Razu et al. (2019), Hox-hydrogenase is a bidirectional heteropentameric which encoded by the hoxEFUYH gene and produces NAD + -reductase. It consists of two protein complexes: diaphorase complex (HoxE, HoxF, and HoxU) and hydrogenase complex (HoxY and HoxH). The bidirectional Hox-hydrogenase is generally present in all cyanobacteria, which catalyzes the absorption and production of molecular H2 (Razu et al., 2019). Nitrogenase is a polyprotein complex with two parts: one is dinitrogenase reductase (Fe protein) and the other is dinitrogenase (MoFe protein). By way of comparison, those two proteins of nitrogenase are encoded by three structural nif genes (Mathews and Wang, 2009). The first protein is the MoFe protein encoded by nifD and nifK, and the second protein is the Fe protein encoded by nifH (Tamagnini et al., 2002). The dinitrogenase is an α2β2 heterotetramer. The α subunit is encoded by nifD gene, while, the β subunit is encoded by nifK gene. And the derived proteins have molecular weights of nearly 220–240 kDa. It is responsible for reducing the N2 bonds leading to the ammonia (NH3) formation (Razu et al., 2019). The heterotetramer consists of two ATP binding sites and a [4Fe–4S] cluster. The dinitrogenase reductase belongs to a homodimer of nearly 60–70 kDa, and the subunit is encoded via nifH, which contributes to convert electrons from the ferredoxins or flavodoxins (as external electron donors) to dinitrogenase (Wang et al., 2020b)."
11,Factors affecting H2 production from microalgae,"Biohydrogen production is a multi-parameter complex operation. Some theoretical and practical factors, show to limit the generation of H2, including microalgae stains, nutrients (macro- and micronutrients), pH, temperature, substrate concentration, aeration, agitation, and bioreactor configuration (Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020). In this section, parameters affecting energy conversion efficiency and O2 sensitivity of hydrogen-producing enzymes were discussed as follows, respectively."
12,Energy conversion efficiency,"5.1 Energy conversion efficiency Different operational parameters such as temperature, pH, C:N ratio, hydraulic retention time, and microbial community proliferation affect the performance and efficiency of photo-fermentation and dark fermentation process (Habashy et al., 2021). As mentioned in the above sections, dark-fermentation is a microbial-mediated process promoted by vital enzymes, for example, hydrogenases. Among various factors, pH is one of the main chemical parameters for biohydrogen production that involving any chemical reactions (Lee et al., 2002). Higher H2 productivity was observed when the pH remained around 6 compared to the near-neutral pH, but high acid pH (<4.5) is negative to H2 yield because it inactivates the acetate-producing bacteria (Bharathiraja et al., 2016). Additionally, one of the fundamental factors in producing H2 is temperature, which plays a significant role in improving H2 generation capacity. Similar to the effects of pH, temperature also dominates metabolism by mediating enzymatic reactions (Bolatkhan et al., 2019), clearly, each enzyme has its own optimal temperature range, within which the activity can reach the highest performance. In addition, noting that hydrogenases are metalloproteins, to improve the activity of these enzymes and thus increase H2 generation, fermentation medium supply with metal ions as co-factors will be beneficial (Srivastava et al., 2019). Photosynthetic energy transformation efficiency can be up to 10% (Kovács et al., 2006), and such a high efficiency has been observed under low O2 partial pressure and low-light conditions. Optical absorption of photosynthetic devices is essential for H2 production because light energy promotes the H2O molecules oxidation, the discharge of electrons and protons, and the endergonic transport of these electrons to ferredoxin (Melis and Happe, 2001). In general, H2 production is relatively low at lower light intensities. It has been found that brief exposure to high light intensity could increase H2 production rates by inhibiting photosynthetic O2 evolution (Jeffries et al., 1978; Markov et al., 2006). Kaushik and Anjana (2011) observed that maximum H2 concentration (15.2 × 10−3 ± 0.5 × 10−3 mol/h kg dry wt.) was generated under a 24 h dark period without light intervention. However, this process is not renewable because photosynthesis is not carried out in dark conditions, so the final biomass and internal substrates will lessen after some time taking the culture into a non-renewable point (Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020). Moreover, proper configuration of photoreactor is important to the most efficient use of light and surface area (Show et al., 2019). Photoreactor configurations are depended on the light and surface area used by the microalgae. According to the configuration, reactors are primarily divided into: vertical, horizontal, floating, flat or tubular, biofilm, manifold or serpentine, inclined, and mixed reactors (El-Dalatony et al., 2020b). To improve the photon transformation efficiency, photoreactors could be designed to lead the amount of light intake. For example, the non-motile C. reinhardtii mutant, CC-1036 pf 18 mt+ was grown fixed to fiber glass, and located in a rectangular photobioreactor (160 mL volume). H2 (45 mL/d) was generated by continuous flow (10 mL/h) of Tris-acetate-phosphate medium containing 10–20 μM sulfate by the photobioreactor or through periodic re-additions of sulfate (Laurinavichene et al., 2006). Besides, argon was also flowed through the photobioreactor (Laurinavichene et al., 2006). The electron transmission pathway of green microalgae and cyanobacteria is similar, in addition that in cyanobacteria, the reduced ferredoxin (Fd) provides electrons to [NiFe]-hydrogenase rather than [FeFe]-hydrogenase through FNR reaction (Akhlaghi and Najafpour-Darzi, 2020). It was noted that electrons were produced either upon the photochemical oxidation of H2O by PSII, which leads to the simultaneous generation of O2 and H2, or upon the oxidation of the endogenous substrate, bring electrons into the thylakoid membrane with the concurrent discharge of CO2 to the medium (Melis and Happe, 2001). Since the presence of PSII inhibitors 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (or called DCMU) inhibits electron transmission from PSII to the PQ pool, the proportion of molecular H2 and CO2 produced by the photosynthetic process is 2:1 (Bamberger et al., 1982). Generally, electrons derived from residual H2O decomposition activity of PS II (60–70%) and fermentation-derived electrons in the plastoquinone pool (20–30%) promote hydrogenase through PS I and ferredoxin (Williams and Bees, 2014)."
13,O2 sensitivity of hydrogen-producing enzymes,"5.2 O2 sensitivity of hydrogen-producing enzymes Redox metalloenzymes are normally exceedingly sensitive to the inactivation of O2, CO, CN, high temperature, and diverse other environmental factors (Kovács et al., 2006). These characteristics are not conducive to biotechnology applications. As mentioned above, O2 is a potent inhibitor of hydrogenase. Methods to reduce O2 in culture contain the use of O2 absorbers, reversible (e.g., hemoglobin), and irreversible (glucose/glucose oxidase, dithionite) (Rosenkrans and Krasna, 1984), or addition of O2 scavengers such as chromous chloride. For example, Manoyan et al. (2019) revealed that the addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), protonophores, and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNF) increases H2 generation in P. kessleri RA-002. Their results indicated that in the existence of 15 μM CCCP and 50 μM DNF, the maximal H2 production of approximately 2.20 and 2.08 mM was obtained, respectively (Manoyan et al., 2019). However, present technical developments in this field have not yet successfully overcome this mutually limited nature of the O2 and H2 photoproduction reaction (Melis and Happe, 2001). The available nutrients have a tremendous impact on microalgal cells. The absence of necessary nutrients can easily lead to a stress state of microalgal cells (El-Dalatony et al., 2020a). Photosynthetic organisms, for example, green microalgae, in sulfur deficiency, react by lowering the photosystem-II complicated and evolution of O2 (Happe et al., 2002). The endogenous O2 concentration declines due to the continuation of respiration. More specifically, sulfur deprivation hinders the composition of the sulfur-containing D1 polypeptide chain, which is the PSII reaction center, causing a rapid decline in the synthesis of O2 and fixation of CO2 (Levin et al., 2004). As previously reported, in the existence of acetate and in the absence of sulfur, the cells close most (but not all) O2 release activity, respire all measurable remaining O2 in the enclosed environment, and cause the hydrogenase expression (Ghirardi et al., 2000). Additionally, there are significant similarities between the N deprivation and sulfur deprivation methods, but the aerobic phase of the N-deprivation strategy is relatively longer, causing delays in H2 production (Wang et al., 2020b). Moreover, similar to sulfur deprivation, phosphorus deprivation limits the evolutionary activity of O2 in algal cells and leads to other metabolic changes in favor of H2 photoproduction (Batyrova et al., 2015). Less common element deprivations, such as magnesium (Mg), were also conducted. As reported by Volgusheva et al. (2017), the authors present a comparative study of H2 photoproduction induced by Mg and S shortage, and the results show that the prolonged time of H2 generation upon Mg-deprivation is owing to the less negative effects that Mg-depletion had on the growth and metabolic properties of the cells. Unlike S-deprivation, the reactions of photosynthetic light and dark in Mg-deprived cells kept active throughout H2 production (Volgusheva et al., 2017). In summary, the most practical method of biohydrogen generation was S-deprivation compared with phosphorus, nitrogen, and Mg deficiency (Wang et al., 2021). To reveal the O2 sensitivity mechanism, achievements have been made via theoretical and experimental study on hydrogenases over the past 30 years (Lu and Koo, 2019), such as molecular dynamics simulation, volumetric solvent accessibility maps, density functional theory calculations, and some other computational evaluation. Moreover, to form effective O2-resistant hydrogenases, operations to the active sites on the O2 diffusion channels could be considered (Liebgott et al., 2010). The [FeFe] hydrogenase can be purified under air in an oxygen stable inactivate state named H ox air (Rodríguez-Maciá et al., 2018). The production of the H ox air state in vitro approves the handling of hydrogenases in air, making their performance in biotechnological applications more practical. Rodríguez-Maciá et al. (2018) used a basic chemical treatment to form the H ox air state, that is, oxidation of the enzyme in the existence of Na2S. This method could protect [Fe–Fe]-hydrogenases from O2 damage."
14,Advanced technologies in biohydrogen production from microalgae,"Alga is an up-and-coming feedstock for the generation of next-generation biofuels and has attracted increasing attention as its capability for carbon capture, conversion, and utilization (Nagarajan et al., 2020a). Up to now, several methods have been carried out to advance the H2 production, for example, enhanced pretreatment processes to increase the bioavailability of simple sugars from complicated organic substrates, optimize process factors to enhance the H2 yield, and apply synthetic biological and genetic engineering methods to improve H2 production rate. One of the traditional methods is to place algal cells in nutrients (sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and Mg, etc.) depletion medium and the underlying mechanism has been intensively studied recently (Antal et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2016). In this review, four advanced approaches were emphasized and separately discussed in the following sections: 1) genetic engineering to improve H2 production; 2) microalgae-bacteria consortia as a strategy to advance H2 production; 3) electro-bio-hydrogenation as a new method for algal biohydrogen; and 4) nanomaterials for increasing enzyme stability and hydrolytic efficiency."
15,Genetic engineering to improve H2 production,"6.1 Genetic engineering to improve H2 production Aforementioned, the O2 sensitivity of enzymes is the main bottleneck in commercializing the microalgae H2 generation platforms. Considering that, the Chlorella sp. HYDA from the DT strain (CsHydAc.DT, encoded by CshydAc.DT) was genetically engineered to alter the amino acid residues A105I, G113I, V265W, or V273I around the gas tunnel to inhibit O2 from entering the enzyme active site, thereby increasing H2 production up to thirty-fold times (Yang et al., 2019). As reported by Hankamer et al. (2007), gene manipulation or modification of H2-producing microorganisms by knock-in or knock-out may play a critical role in solving the problem of low H2 production. In another study, H2 yield increased four to seven folds by a genetically modified Anabaena (knocked out hupL gene) in comparison to wild strains (Masukawa et al., 2002). Inhibition of PsbO gene expression induces the suppression of O2 discharge and the induction of HYDA in the PSII system as PsbO is involved in the O2 evolution of the PSII system. Lin et al. (2013) reported that the biological H2 yield of the mutants has improved by nine times by knocking out the PsbO gene. In addition, it is also suggested to modify the hydrogenase structure to improve tolerance toward O2 of hydrogenase (Wang et al., 2021). Recently, researchers changed the hydrogenase gas channels by replacing particular amino acids to inhibit O2 from passing through the channel and protecting the active center (Khosravitabar, 2019; Yang et al., 2019). Another method is the overexpression of specific genes, which increases the H2 yield in microalgae. For example, Wu et al. (2011) expressed codon optimization genes in lba and hemA in C. reinhardtii, which led to a 20% increase in direct photolysis H2 generation and 6.8 folds enhancement of hemH-lba protein expression in the codon-optimized transgenic microalgae. Genetic engineering is an effective technology for modifying specific pathways to increase H2 production (Fig. 3 A) (Goswami et al., 2021). Genetic engineering along with metabolic engineering are among core techniques for enhancing the yield of biological H2. Hydrogenases obtain electrons from PSI through the photosynthetic electron transport ferredoxin. However, the primary receptor of photosynthetic electrons is FNR. Thus, the main challenge to be solved is that the HYDA is less competitive with NADPH formation catalyzed by ferredoxin-NADP+-reductase (FNR). Considering that, Eilenberg et al. (2016) investigated the in vivo H2 generation efficiency of Fd-HYDA, wherein the electron donor ferredoxin (Fd) was fused with HYDA and expressed in the model microalgae C. reinhardtii. The results showed that once the Fd-HYDA fusion gene was expressed in C. reinhardtii cells, the fusion enzyme can intercept photosynthetic electrons and apply them to effective H2 generation (Eilenberg et al., 2016). Several other engineering targets were successfully achieved to bypass FNR competition, such as photosynthetic electrons deliver ferredoxin and FNR genetic modifications (Rumpel et al., 2014). Moreover, the application of C. reinhardtii with Moc 1 gene mutation has been disclosed in an open patent (Akhlaghi and Najafpour-Darzi, 2020). It was pointed out that H2 generation was improved by transferring electrons via a respiratory electron transfer chain (Akhlaghi and Najafpour-Darzi, 2020). Atmospheric and room-temperature plasma (ARTP) is a freshly advanced whole-cell mutagenesis technology depended on helium radio-frequency atmospheric-pressure glow discharge plasma, which displays more benefits than conventional chemical mutagens or UV radiation (Ottenheim et al., 2018). Considering that, Ban et al. (2019) aimed to increase the H2 production of microalgae by utilizing ARTP mutagenesis to truncate the Chl antenna of C. reinhardtii. After the choice, an algal mutant was detected to have 2.7–3.1 times (356.5–405.2 mL/L) and 1.8–5.2 times (28.5–84.1 mL/L) higher H2 generation than wild-type in the course of the algal subcultures grown in co-cultures and pure-cultures, respectively (Ban et al., 2019)."
16,Microalgae-bacteria consortium as a strategy to enhance H2 production,"6.2 Microalgae-bacteria consortium as a strategy to enhance H2 production Despite great interest in microalgae as a potential biofuel source for alternative fossil fuels, there is still limited investigation on the impacts of bacterial symbionts in large-scale microalgae cultivation systems (Zhang et al., 2021a). Moreover, co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Azotobacter, and Bradyrhizobium) has also been proposed as a feasible approach to obtain anaerobiosis through the bacterial partners' respiration (Ban et al., 2018). Watanabe et al. (2005) had isolated four bacterial strains and one fungal strain from the culture of C. sorokiniana and demonstrated that bacterium Microbacterium trichotecenolyticum and fungi Acremonium-like hyphomycete could improve the growth of Chlorella. Recently, Luo's group (Ban et al., 2018) has proved that the bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain D was a major partner in enhancing photolysis-mediated H2 generation from C. reinhardtii and contributing to the production of H2 from the green microalgae Chlorella and Scenedesmus. In another study (Xu et al., 2017), microalgae C. reinhardtii cc124 and bacteria A. chroococcum were co-cultured and the maximal H2 yield reached 255 μmol/mg Chl, which was nearly sixteen fold of the control. Besides, authors speculated that the reasons for the higher H2 yields include reduced O2 content, increased microalgae growth, and enhanced H2ase activity and starch content in the combined system (Xu et al., 2017). Compared with monocultures, co-cultures could enhance H2 productivity and affect the parameters of yield, rate, and duration, which contributed to a three-fold enhancement with the presence of many consortia (Fakhimi et al., 2020). In a recent study, Fakhimi and Tavakoli (2019) investigated the effect of bacterial co-culture on H2 production from Chlamydomonas at low light intensity. The results showed that co-culture of P. stutzeri, E. coli, and P. putida decreased the Chlamydomonas growth, and increased H2 production up to 46%, 24%, and 32%, respectively, because of the higher respiration rate in the bioreactors at low light intensity. In another study, Li et al. (2013) expressed that co-cultivation of C. reinhardtii with isolated bacteria could improve H2 production. It was found that the maximum H2 yield was about 4 times higher than that of single algal culture. Moreover, sugars supplementation could improve algal H2 generation in co-cultures. For example, Fakhimi et al. (2019) reported that algal H2 photoproduction can be achieved in sugar-containing media only when the green microalgae C. reinhardtii was co-cultured with E. coli (35.1 mL H2/L), P. putida (40.8 mL H2/L), and Rhizobium etli (16.1 mL H2/L). The results also demonstrate that this cooperation depended on the performance of the microalgae to consume the discharged bacterial acetic acid, which favored the H2 generation from bacteria and microalgae (Fakhimi et al., 2019). Moreover, the microalgae-bacteria syntrophic interaction also retarded Chl reduction, improved starch accumulation, and maintained protein composition, which appeared to be the major factor for improving microalgae H2 production (Show et al., 2019). There is still a gap in the field of biohydrogen generation in microalgae-bacteria consortia. However, the microalgae-bacteria consortium show great potential as a promising strategy for improving H2 production."
17,Electro-bio-hydrogenation as a new approach for algal biohydrogen,"6.3 Electro-bio-hydrogenation as a new approach for algal biohydrogen Biological H2 production, apart from the above-mentioned traditional approaches, a novel hybrid biological H2 generation approach has recently been proposed by utilizing the electrochemical process. Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) have great promising to develop into green and sustainable energy producers through oxidizing organic matters catalyzed by electroactive biofilms (Hua et al., 2019). These processes contain the electrolysis established on the theory and practice of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) (Azwar et al., 2014). More specifically, microorganisms produce electrons and protons via the biological oxidation of organic substances (Fig. 3B). Various organic products can be converted into energy resources in MECs (Wang et al., 2020a). Protons and electrons are produced by the microorganisms on the anode and reach the cathode through the reactor solution and the external circuit, respectively. The electrons and protons associate to form H2 at the cathode (Hua et al., 2019). As the H2 generation process itself does not occur inside the microalgal cell, strictly speaking, MECs are not conventional biohydrogen generation platforms (Oey et al., 2016). A previous study has indicated that the yield and efficiency of biohydrogen could be improved by the integration of waste water and microalgae with photosynthetic and non-photo synthetic bacteria in fermentation with the participation of electricity (Kim et al., 2018)."
18,Nanomaterials for enhancing enzyme stability and hydrolytic efficiency,"6.4 Nanomaterials for enhancing enzyme stability and hydrolytic efficiency Nanotechnology has a high potential for improving biohydrogen production due to its effects on the intracellular electron transfer, growth of microorganisms, and the metalloenzymes activity involved in H2 generation (Shanmugam et al., 2020). Many kinds of research have shown that Fe2+ could enhance the hydrogenase activity, because Fe2+ is a key element of its active center (Wu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Yang and Wang (2018) reported that zero-valent iron (Fe0) NPs could stimulate electron transfer between hydrogenase and ferredoxin, and promote the activity of key enzymes through the discharged Fe2+ (Fig. 3C). In this study, the maximal H2 production rate was 12.1 mL/h at Fe0 NPs dosage of 400 mg/L, which was 128.3% higher than that of without NPs (Yang and Wang, 2018). In another study, Nath et al. (2015) showed that the percentage and yield of H2 in FeNPs addition were significantly higher than the control group (not added), the maximum H2 yield of 1.9 mol/mol glucose was observed in 100 mg/L FeNPs addition, with two-fold increase in glucose transformation efficiency. In addition to Fe2+ ions, nickel ions (Ni2+) were also found to be significant cofactors in the active site of [Ni–Fe] hydrogenase (Shanmugam et al., 2020). Co-cultivation with Ni ions could enhance the activity of dehydrogenase enzyme. Elreedy et al. (2017) demonstrated that maximum H2 yields of 24.73 ± 1.12 mL/g CODinitial were obtained at a dosage of 60 mg/L for Ni NPs, which was higher compared with the control without NPs addition. Furthermore, researchers have paid more attention to the catalysis with gold NPs and novel catalytic systems for diverse reactions. For example, Zhang and Shen (2007) revealed that gold NPs could highly enhance the bioactivity of hydrogen-producing microorganisms. And the performance largely relied on the size of gold particles. Considering that the presence of O2 sensitive hydrogenase in H2 generation hinders its large-scale application. Recently, with the advent of nanotechnology, it is possible to improve the hydrogenase efficiency and make the process more efficient (Shanmugam et al., 2020). For example, Pandey et al. (2015) observed that titanium (TiO2) NPs could enhance the activity of hydrogenase, this property can be used for biophotolytic H2 generation. Although some work has been conducted on NPs for bacteria, there are few studies on H2 production from microalgae with the involvement of NPs. In summary, genetic engineering along with metabolic engineering are among core technologies for improving the yield of biological H2. Investigations on the impacts of bacterial symbionts in large-scale microalgae cultivation systems are still limited. The novel hybrid biological H2 generation approach through the electrochemical process has been proposed, but further research is required about the yield and efficiency of biohydrogen. Nanotechnology could enhance biohydrogen production by involving the intracellular electron transfer, growth of microorganisms, and the metalloenzymes activity involved in H2 generation, however, large-scale application is still restricted."
19,Conclusions and future perspectives,"Up to date, biohydrogen production from microalgae has attracted high attention owing to its advantage in carbon neutrality and energy sustainability. The promising bioprocessing routes and technical challenges for cleaner production of biohydrogen from microalgae are summarized in Table 3 . Hydrolysis efficiency is affected by the firmness and rigidity of the microalgae cell walls in the processes of photo fermentation and dark fermentation (Salakkam et al., 2020). Besides, there are some technical challenges for the large-scale production of the algal-derived biohydrogen such as biomass pretreatment, substrate conversion efficiency, amplification operations, mass storage, and overall production cost (Mandotra et al., 2021). In general, dark fermentation of microalgae for biohydrogen production is relatively better than photo fermentation, biophotolysis, and microbial electrolysis, because it is able to consecutively generate H2 and is not reliant on energy supplied by natural sunlight (Shobana et al., 2017). Although there have been many kinds of research focusing on the enhancement of H2 yield through microalgae, the present level of H2 generation from microalgae is still insufficient as a commercially competitive energy carrier (Wang et al., 2020b). The main conclusions and future outlook have been summarized as follows. (1) It is of high importance to focus on the investigations of enhancing the amount of hydrogenase in algal cells, lessening the O2 sensitivity of the enzyme, and improving the photosynthetic performance to further increase the rate of H2 production by microalgae. (2) The microalgae-bacteria syntrophic interaction could retard the reduction of Chl, promote the starch formation and maintain protein formation, which appears to be the major factor in improving H2 production in microalgae. (3) It is recommended to alter the hydrogenase structure to enhance tolerance toward O2 of hydrogenase via genetic strategies (synthetic biology and genetic engineering). (5) Photolysis involves biohydrogen generation from H+, therefore bases on the photon transformation efficiency. (6) Apart from providing optimum light intensity, the intervention of technological methods and the configuration of reactors could also help optimize conditions to achieve higher photosynthetic efficiency (El-Dalatony et al., 2020b). (7) In order to scale up algal hydrogen production for sustainability, life cycle assessments may be critical, however, existing life cycle assessments are mainly inferences of laboratory-scale studies, cannot give accurate assessments, and therefore further studies are required."
