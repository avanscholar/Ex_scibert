0,Introduction,"Although food packaging materials based on synthetic fossil-derived plastics are not environmentally friendly, they are inexpensive, exhibit high strength and good barrier properties, and can be thermally processed and converted into different packaging forms. By contrast, biopolymers (e.g. polysaccharides and proteins) are environmentally friendly because they degrade without creating environmentally dangerous residues; however, they are more expensive, exhibit weak mechanical properties, and are hydrophilic (Shariatinia and Fasihozaman-langroodi, 2019). One alternative is blending natural, highly available polymers with synthetic polymers with good degradability. The second most abundant biopolymer in nature is chitin, which consists of repeated 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-d-glucose units; its deacetylated form for the use in food packaging materials has been widely studied owing to its biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, good film-forming properties, and low permeability to oxygen. Both forms are included in the ‘Environmentally Degradable Plastics List’ (Shamshina et al., 2019). Chitin and its derivatives can be extracted from the massive amount of biowaste accumulated by marine capture fisheries (up to 250 billion tons/year) (Morganti et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the full potential of chitin has not been exploited mainly owing to its insolubility. Chitin has a high degree of acetylation and hydrogen bonds, which makes it insoluble in water and conventional solvents (Priya et al., 2016; Salaberria et al., 2015). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic, water-soluble polymer with excellent film-forming, emulsifying, and adhesive properties; PVA films show high tensile strength (TS) and biodegradability, and their use for packaging meat and poultry products has been approved by the USDA (Arruda et al., 2015). When chitosan (CS) is blended with PVA to develop films, intermolecular hydrogen bonds are created between CS and PVA. Moreover, PVA contributes to plasticisation, enhances the elasticity, elongation, TS, and improves the water and oxygen barrier properties of films (Wang et al., 2018). Different methods for fabricating PVA/CS composite films have been proposed, such as crosslinking, graft copolymerisation, chemical modification, and polymer blending. However, PVA/CS films prepared by chemical crosslinking may constitute a potential risk factor in food packaging (Wu et al., 2018). Polymer blending, which is a simple and effective method, is widely applied to obtain PVA/CS composite films (Liu et al., 2018). In general, any composition of CS and PVA is well miscible owing to the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the amine and hydroxyl groups of the two polymers (Kumar et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2018). For example, different ratios of CS and PVA were mixed to obtain biodegradable films (PVA/CS: 90/10, 80/20, 70/30) (Bonilla et al., 2014). The film cross-sections of all mixtures showed a continuous, homogeneous phase, which indicates a high compatibility between the two polymers (Bonilla et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2009). In addition, the CS addition greatly reduced the extensibility of the PVA films, while increasing their rigidity and strength, and the water vapour permeability (WVP) did not decrease (Bonilla et al., 2014). One strategy for improving the limited vapour water barriers in CS-based films is including nanoparticles (NPs); NPs have a tortuous effect on films owing to the hydrogen bonds between them and the film matrix. Depending on the NP type, the WVP can decrease by up to 50% compared to those of films without NPs. In addition, NPs affect the mechanical properties less than lipids (Medina et al., 2019). The addition of 3%–5% bentonite nanolayers to PVA/CS films decreases the WVP (Koosha and Hamedi, 2019). In this study, the effect of β-chitin microparticles (MPs) and NPs obtained from jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) pens on the WVP of PVA/CS films was investigated. The extraction of β-chitin from squid pens is simpler than the extraction of α-chitin from shrimp and crab shells because no demineralisation and decolouration processes are required. In contrast to α-chitin, β-chitin from jumbo squid pens contains loose arrangements of polymeric chains and thus a lower crystallinity index, which leads to higher moisture absorption. In addition, the parallel orientation of the polymeric chains in β-chitin leads to weaker interactions and a more open structure (Jung and Zhao, 2014; Montroni et al., 2019a). Owing to the strong molecular interactions and the resulting difficult solubilisation and processing, chitin is not widely used. An alternative is the top–down production of dispersed chitin nanofibres, which can be obtained from squid pen β-chitin by mechanical grinding and high-power ultrasonication (Wu et al., 2014). For instance, Montroni et al. dispersed squid pen β-chitin nanofibres in water by a simple mechanical treatment under acid conditions; a pH adjustment of the squid pen β-chitin/water slurry to 3–4 was required to achieve transparent dispersion by ultrasonication (Montroni et al., 2019b). In this study, PVA/CS films loaded with β-chitin MPs and NPs were prepared to evaluate their mechanical and water vapour barrier properties. To evaluate the vapour barrier of the film was used the wet cup method under high RH of 85% and a low temperature of 5 °C to mimic the storage conditions of fresh fruits. The β-chitin was obtained from jumbo squid pens, and the MPs were extracted by knife milling. Subsequently, NPs were obtained from MPs by ultrasonication."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The squid pen (Dosidicus gigas) originated from Nippon Meat Packers Inc. (V region, Chile) and the PVA from Sigma-Aldrich (USA; viscosity of 2% (w/v) solution at 21 °C: 10 ± 0.1 mPa s according to Brookfield Model DV-II + Spindle 61 viscometer); in addition, high-molecular weight CS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with a degree of deacetylation of >75% and a viscosity between 800 and 2000 mPa s was applied; the sodium hydroxide and glacial acetic acid (ACS grade) were supplied by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany."
3,Extraction of β-chitin MPs and NPs from squid pen,"2.2 Extraction of β-chitin MPs and NPs from squid pen Fig. 1 shows the workflow for the chitin MP (MpQ128; left) and NP extraction. The squid pen was manually cleaned, washed with cold water, and then grinded to pieces with sizes between 0.5 and 0.7 cm in a grinder (Ad6011 Moulinex, France). The deproteinisation step was conducted in a reactor (Juchheim Laborgeräte GmbH, Bernkastel-Kues, Germany) at 280 rpm with a 10% (w/w) sodium hydroxide solution at a mass ratio of 1:10 (chitin: NaOH) for 2 h at 60–75 °C. Subsequently, the pH of the mixture was neutralised with successive washing cycles (six to seven washing cycles) in distilled water in a basket centrifuge (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Afterwards, the product was treated in an oven (Heraeus Instruments UT6200, UK) at 25 °C for 48 h to remove excess water. The dry β-chitin was milled for 30 min in a knife mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany), and the product was subjected to a granulometric analysis on a battery of ASTM Hebro sieves (Thomas Scientific, US) with 20, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 mesh for 20 min in a stirrer at 125 rpm (Erweka AR-400, Germany). The mean weight diameter of the MPs was 128 μm (MpQ128). The β-chitin NP (NpQ) procedure reported in (Fan et al., 2008) was used. Briefly, the pH of the chitin water dispersion of MpQ128 (1 mg/mL) was adjusted to 3–4 with acetic acid 1% (v/v). Subsequently, the dispersion was subjected to ultrasound (Qsonica Model Q700, USA) for 20, 30, and 40 min at an amplitude of 40% in a work cycle of 50% (pulsing cycles: 10 s ‘on’ and 10 s ‘off’) with a titanium probe (diameter of 12.7 mm). The container with the sample was placed in a beaker precipitated with water and salt to decrease the heat generation during the process (Lu et al., 2013). Subsequently, the dispersion was filtered with 0.45 μm filters (Durapore PVDF Millipore, Germany). The resulting β-chitin NPs (NpQ) were dried in an oven (Heraeus Instruments UT6200, UK) at 25 °C for 48 h to remove excess water."
4,Preparation of PVA/CS films and addition of MPs and NPs,"2.3 Preparation of PVA/CS films and addition of MPs and NPs The method proposed by (Bonilla et al., 2014) was used (Fig. 1; columns of PVA and CS in flowsheet). The PVA was diluted in 1.5% (w/w) distilled water under magnetic stirring at 90 °C for 3 h, and 0.15% CS (w/w) was diluted in aqueous acetic acid (1% v/v) under magnetic stirring at 40 °C for 12 h. Films were obtained by mixing different ratios of PVA and CS (gradual incorporation of CS solution into PVA solution). The following three formulations were prepared: 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 (PVA/CS, respectively). All formulations were prepared with ultrasound at 20 kHz and 700 W (Qsonica Model Q700, USA) with 40% amplitude for 5 min, at room temperature, and pulsations of 10 s ‘on’ and 10 s ‘off’ with a titanium probe (diameter of 12.7 mm) (Lu et al., 2013). To remove bubbles in the solution, a vacuum pump was used. The formulations were spread onto Petri dishes (sizes of 145 × 20 mm), which were treated in a stove at 40 °C with 40% relative humidity (RH) (Labtech, Korea) for four days. Finally, 1% and 5% MpQ128 and NpQ (with respect to CS amount) were added into the PVA/CS mixtures (90/10, 80/20, and 70/30) by suspending the MPs and NPs in the PVA solution under stirring with a vortex (Fig. 1; dotted lines between MpQ128 and NpQ and vortex dispersion)."
5,Characterisation of NPs,"2.4 Characterisation of NPs 2.4.1 Zeta potential, polydispersity index, and hydrodynamic particle diameter The zeta potential (Z-potential), polydispersity index (PDI), and hydrodynamic particle diameter (Z-average) at 25 °C were determined with a Zetasizer Nano ZS-20 (Malvern Instruments) at 4.0 mW, 633 nm, and with a fixed scattering angle of 173°."
6,Evaluation of mechanical properties of films,"2.5 Evaluation of mechanical properties of films 2.5.1 Thickness Nine measuring points on each film were chosen with a micrometre (Mitutoyo, Japan). Measurements of tensile stress (TS) and percentage of elongation (%E). The Official Chilean Standard Nch1151.Of.76, which is equivalent to the international standard ISO R1184-1970, was used with some modifications. The test was performed on at least three samples per formulation; therefore, samples of 10 mm width and 50 mm length were cut (cell load of 50 N). The cells were placed between two clamps at a distance of 4 cm and then stretched; only those that were split in the middle area were measured by considering the force versus the elongation distance to the breakpoint of the cell (Lloyd Instruments Limited, Lloyd LR-5K. Hampshire, England); the %E and TS were calculated as follows:"
7,Percentage of elongation (%E) at break,"2.6 Percentage of elongation (%E) at break (1) % E = D f − D i D i ∗ 100 where: Df = elongation distance to fracture (mm); Di = distance between reference lines (mm). Tensile stress at break (TS): (2) T S = L A C where: TS: tensile stress at break (N/mm2); L: maximal load at break (N); AC: initial cross-sectional film area (mm2): (3) A C = ε ∗ W where: ε: film thickness (mm); W: film width (mm). Water vapour permeability (WVP). The wet cup method was used according to the Official Chilean Standard Nch2098.Of2000, which is equivalent to the standards ASTM D1653-93 and DIN 52615. The cups were filled with distilled water up to 6 mm from the top edge. Subsequently, filter paper of the same diameter and a film were mounted on the edge, and the contact edge between the film and cup was sealed with silicone. The cups were treated in a cold chamber at 5 °C and 85% RH for 21 days, and their weight changes were recorded every 24 h with an electronic scale (Chyo, MJ-300 model, Japan). To determine the water vapour transmission (WVT), the slope of the water mass change of the cup versus the time was determined; it represents the stabilisation of the water vapour diffusion through the films per unit of time; the values were normalised by the film area. The WVP was estimated considering the pressure differences generated on the opposite sides of the film (inside the cup; 100% RH; in cold chamber: 85% RH; measured in kPa): (4) W V P = Δ m x ε t x A x Δ p where: WVP (mm g kPa−1m−2h−1); ε: film thickness (mm); t: time between measurements (h); A: sample area (m2); Δp: S (R1-R2). S: water vapour saturation pressure at test temperature (kPa); R1 is the RH (%) of the part with the highest vapour pressure, and R2 is the RH (%) of the part with the lowest vapour pressure."
8,Statistical analysis,"2.7 Statistical analysis Each experiment was conducted at least three times, and the analyses were conducted in triplicates. The experimental data were subjected to a variance analysis, and the significant differences between the mean values were evaluated by Tukey's multiple range method (Statgraphics, Version 5.0; Statpoint Technologies, Inc., Warrenton, Virginia). A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterisation of NPs,"3.1 Characterisation of NPs The hydrodynamic size, Z-average, PDI, and Z-potential at different treatment times of the NPs obtained by ultrasound according to the procedure described by Fan et al. (2008) are shown in Table 1 . The ultrasound treatment results in a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of the Z-average and PDI of NPs. More specifically, the Z-average decreases from 761 nm after 20 min to 290 nm after 30 min; when the treatment is extended to 40 min, the size does not decrease significantly. The same effect was observed for the PDI value; it decreases from 0.64 after 20 min to 0.46 after 30 min. The Z-potential at 20 min is 40.9 mV, which remains constant with prolonged treatment. The high-intensity ultrasonication treatment breaks the chitin interfibrillar hydrogen bonds, which leads to the gradual disintegration of the nanofibres. Fan et al. (2008) demonstrated that chitin nanofibres can be obtained from squid pen β-chitin/water slurry (pH 3–4) and not from crab α-chitins because pen β-chitins exhibit a weaker intermolecular force than α-chitins. By adjusting the pH of the solution to 3–4, the repulsive forces of the nanofibres increase, which optimises the cavitation work and leads to transparent dispersion because it allows the protonation of the C2 of chitin (pKa 6.3). The cavitation energy of approximately 500 kJ (30 min treatment at 280 W) reduces the size to approximately 300 nm. Moreover, the Z-potential varies between 40 and 42 mV owing to the ultrasound treatment. This positive value is expected for β-chitin, which contains a low amount of C2 amino groups (pKa value of 6.3). Thus, it becomes fully protonated in the chitin/water slurry at pH 3–4, which allows a stable dispersion by electrostatic repulsion (Fan et al., 2008, Aklog et al., 2016). The Z-potential values are lower than those reported by Fan et al. (2008): 60 mV and Aklog et al. (2016): 54 mV for α-chitin). In addition, the stability of the NPs (30 min treatment) during four weeks was assessed (Table 2 ). The Z-average, PDI, and Z-potential of the NPs do not change significantly (p < 0.05) during the study period. Therefore, the NPs generated by ultrasound can be incorporated into the films."
11,Film characterisation,"3.2 Film characterisation The PVA/CS films (ratios of 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30) were combined with β-chitin MPs (average diameter of 128 μm; MpQ128) and β-chitin NPs (average diameter of approximately 290 nm; NpQ) at 1% and 5% mass ratios (β-Chitin/CS), which resulted in 12 formulations. In addition, PVA control samples were prepared with 1% and 5% MPs and NPs with respect to the PVA mass. Fig. 2 shows the thickness and mechanical properties of the control films (PVA 100), PV/CS (90/10, 80/20, 70/30) films, and β-chitin films with MpQ128 (1% and 5% MP contents relative to CS mass). The thickness of the film does not increase significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing CS content (from 0.030 ± 0.006 mm in PVA 100 to 0.042 ± 0.003 mm in PV/CS 70/30). The MP addition only increases the thickness of the PV/CS 90/10 film; at a higher CS proportion, these films and control films show no differences. The increase from 1% to 5% of the MpQ128 amount in the three studied formulations does not increase the film thickness. Furthermore, the MP-free control samples exhibit no significant differences between the TS values; however, the increase in the CS amount decreases the %E significantly. It is known that the addition of CS in a PVA matrix reduces the elongation at break of PVA/CS films relative to those of PVA films (Kumar et al., 2010). According to Liu et al., the CS addition changes the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the amine groups of CS and hydroxyl groups of PVA (Liu et al., 2018). This behaviour reinforces the cohesion of the polymer network and limits the slippage of polymer chains during the tensile test, thus reducing the film stretchability (Bonilla et al., 2014). Furthermore, the addition of 1% and 5% MpQ128 increases significantly the TS of the PVA/CS 90/10 film; this effect cannot be observed for the film with 80:20 ratio, whereas it occurs for 5% MPs in the 70:30 mixture. The increase from 1% to 5% MpQ128 does not affect the TS in all formulations. More specifically, the addition of 1% MpQ128 in the PVA/CS 70/30 film increases the %E, and the increase from 1% to 5% does not lead to an additional increase in %E. Considering that WVT depends on the materials and presents different behaviours, it is important that this property decrease to lower water vapour permeability to be used as biopackaging for fruits. The WVT is a two-step process (water sorption and water diffusion), and the WVT through films intended for packaging is a crucial property, and. (Leceta et al., 2015). The kinetic water loss behaviour of the PVA and PVA/CS films is presented in Fig. 3 . The PVA film exhibits biphasic water loss kinetics; when 10%, 20%, and 30% CS is added, a three-phase behaviour can be observed. In hydrophilic films (e.g. PVA, CS, and their mixtures), water interacts with PVA and CS through hydrogen bonds, which increases the free volume and flexibility of the films by modifications of the film permeability. Thus, the presence of water in these films influences the way in which the gas is absorbed and diffused. Water sorption is usually a nonideal process with complex sigmoidal isotherms (Cazón et al., 2020; Despond et al., 2001). As other hydrophilic polymers, CS exhibits WVP variations relative to the aw. At low aw values, the film permeability is relatively low because the water solubility is low. An increasing aw value leads to an increasing film moisture content (sigmoidal moisture sorption isotherm), which increases the water transferability. At a high aw value, the extensive swelling of polysaccharides with increasing water absorption enhances the diffusion of water molecules (Kittur et al., 1998). Srinivasa et al. (2003) reported that the moisture content in PVA/CS films increases with increasing PVA concentration. In addition, they reported the existence of three phases in the sorption isotherm curves for different concentrations of PVA/CS blends. Region A (aw values up to 0.2) is related to the adsorption of a monomolecular film of water, region B (aw values of 0.2–0.7) corresponds to the adsorption of additional layers over the monolayer, and region C (aw values over 0.7) corresponds to the condensation of water in the pores of the material followed by dissolution. The triphasic behaviour of the water loss kinetics observed for the PVA/CS films can be explained based on Srinivasa et al. (2003). The effect of the CS addition to the PVA was studied with three different proportions and the different periods (Table 3 ). The WVP values of the different PVA/CS ratios for each period exhibit no significant differences. However, the WVP in the second period (7–15 days) is significantly lower than during the first 1–6 days and 16–21 days. Despond et al. (2001) reported that the water sorption process in CS films is governed by a Fickian mechanism for relative pressures below 0.4. For a higher RH, the plasticisation effect varies the permeability coefficient as a function of the pressure gradient applied to the membrane. In addition, this plasticisation effect affects the gas permeation because a decrease in the gas barrier is observed for an RH over 0.8. From the molecular point of view, at low water concentrations, CS chains forming extended twofold helices are stabilised by intramolecular hydrogen bonds including the stabilising water molecules between CS sheets formed by these chains. When the water content increases, liquid crystalline mesophases and three-dimensional hydrogel networks are formed (Murugaraj et al., 2011). Based on this description, during the first period (1–6 days) the CS addition has no effect on the WVP of the PVA film because the water sorption is controlled by the diffusion and CS does not form a complex network. In the second period (7–15 days) in which the addition of CS in the PVA films decreases the WVP value significantly, a complex network is formed owing to the high water content (this helps to decrease the WVP). In the third period (16–21 days) in which the water content in the film structure is higher, the effect of the CS addition on the WVP is weaker owing to the increasing water mobility in the film structure. Fan et al. (2012) suggested that β-chitin fibrils can be applied as bio-based nanofibres or fillers to reinforce polymer composites. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the 1% and 5% chitin NP (NpQ) additions in the PVA/CS mixture (70/30) on the thickness and mechanical properties of the films compared to those of the films with 1% and 5% MpQ128 and the control films. The PVA/CS 70/30 ratio was chosen because the addition of MpQ128 does not increase its thickness; however, it increases the TS and %E, which indicates an improvement of the resistance and flexibility of the films (Fig. 2). Fig. 4a shows the weak effect of the NP addition on the film thickness. The same can be observed for the MpQ128 addition. Such as with MpQ128, the TS increases significantly with the addition of NPs with respect to the value of the control sample (Fig. 4b), and no difference between the effects of the MPs and NPs can be observed. In addition, the %E increase due to the addition of NPs is significantly higher than that with MpQ128. Peesan et al. (2003) reported that the TS of β-chitin/PVA films increases with increasing β-chitin content. Table 4 compares the WVP of the PVA/CS 70/30 films loaded with 1% and 5% NPs and MPs and the control films during 21 days. The addition of MPs or NPs does not significantly decrease the WVP compared to that of the control sample. Although, there is a tendency to diminish the WVP when Npq at 1% or 5% are added into the films. In addition, the use of NPs with a Z-average of approximately 300 nm is more efficient for decreasing the WVP than the use of MPs with diameters of 128 μm. The effectiveness of β-chitin NPs in reducing the WVP can be potentially improved by avoiding the aggregation of NPs in the hydrophilic PVA/CS film. In (Caro et al., 2016), the aggregation of CS NPs was avoided by adding 20% (v/v) glycerol to a mixture of CS and quinoa proteins. It is difficult to compare the WVP results published for PVA/CS films owing to the different experimental conditions. For instance, Bonilla et al. reported (Bonilla et al., 2014) a WVP value of 2.4 mg mm/m2hkPa for PVA/CS 70/30 films (10 °C, 58%–100% RH, ASTME96-95, wet cup method, period of study not specified, thickness of 0.31 mm). This result is nine times lower than the result measured in this study at 5 °C and 85%–100% RH (ASTME96-95 norm, wet cup method; Table 4). Koosha and Hamedi studied (Koosha and Hamedi, 2019) the effect of bentonite additions in PVA/CS films. For PVA/CS (83/17) films, the WVP was estimated according to the ASTME 96–95 and desiccant method at 75% RH for three days. The measured WVP was 1.14 mg mm/m2.h.kPa, and the added 3% and 5% bentonite reduced the WVP to 0.5620 and 0.3515, respectively. In this study, no significant reduction in the WVP with added chitin NPs was observed (Table 4). However, the addition of NPs (in the PVA/CS 70/30 produced a significant increase of its mechanical properties (TS from 13.2 to 28.3 N/mm2, and %Elongation from 54.6 to 159.5)."
12,Conclusion,"In this study, MPs and NPs were extracted from jumbo squid pen by milling and ultrasonication. Subsequently, 1% and 5% MPs (diameters of 128 μm) and NPs (diameters of 300–400 nm) were added to PVA/CS 70/30 films. Under the investigated experimental conditions (wet cup method, high RH of 85%, low temperature of 5 °C), which simulate the storage conditions of fresh fruits (possible application for PVA/CS films), the WVP of the films did not decrease significantly. However, the addition of NPs produced a significant increase of its mechanical properties. Future work will examine how the addition of a surfactant agent to the CS solution with NPs during the preparation of PVA/CS films. Here, the objective will be to increase the solubility of the NPs and avoid their aggregation; which will in turn decrease the WVP of the film and make it more suitable for commercial use in fruit packaging."
