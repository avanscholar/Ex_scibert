0,Introduction,"Biomass has been received much attention as renewable organic resources. Converting biomass into high-quality transportation fuels and valuable chemicals is called biorefinery, which is expected to be substituted for petrorefinery in the future [1–6]. While electricity generated from various renewable resources such as wind and solar power can be utilized for transportation, organic chemicals cannot be produced from most renewable resources except biomass. Therefore, development of the production systems of chemicals, especially monomers for plastics with large demands, is critically important for sustainable society. Carbohydrates including starch, cellulose and hemicellulose are widely available. Because these materials contain higher amount of oxygen than most plastics, reactions that can remove oxygen atoms from substrates are essential in the sugar-based biorefinery [7]. These reactions include dehydration and CO hydrogenolysis. While direct CO hydrogenolysis of sugars is very difficult, dehydration of sugar monomers gives furan derivatives over acid catalysts (Fig. 1 ) [8–12]. In particular, dehydration of xylose, which can be obtained from hemicellulose, into furfural is a well-known reaction and is currently carried out in an industrial scale. Dehydration of hexoses such as fructose and glucose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural has been extensively studied in these years. Hydrogenation of furan compounds into the tetrahydrofuran derivatives such as furfural into tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) can be achieved over nickel-based catalysts [13–15]. Therefore, tetrahydrofuran derivatives, THFA in particular, can be regarded as renewable building blocks. This review concerns the recent developments of the selective hydrogenolysis of THFA into valuable alcohols by our and some other research groups. Very high selectivity to 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PeD) can be obtained over Rh-based catalysts modified with transition metals. The structure of the active sites and the reaction mechanism are also discussed."
1,Reaction network of THFA hydrogenolysis,"The reactions involved in THFA hydrogenolysis are displayed in Fig. 2 . There are three CO bonds in THFA molecule, and the primary products of CO hydrogenolysis are 1,5-PeD, 1,2-pentanediol (1,2-PeD) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. Overhydrogenolysis gives 1-pentanol (1-PeOH) from both 1,2- and 1,5-PeDs and 2-pentanol (2-PeOH) from 1,2-PeD. CC hydrogenolysis (d5/30/2012 degradation) gives C4 or lower compounds. We calculated the energetics of these reactions in the gas phase with G2MP2 level theory (Table 1 ). All the hydrogenolysis reactions have large negative ΔG values, showing that the reactions are essentially irreversible. The formation of 1,2-PeD is more exothermic than that of 1,5-PeD. Therefore, if the formations of 1,2- and 1,5-PeDs proceed in the same mechanism over an essentially nonselective catalyst, the selectivity to 1,2-PeD may well be higher than that to 1,5-PeD. The selective formation of 1,5-PeD requires the use of very selective catalysts. The formation reaction of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran has a larger change in free energies than those of PeDs because the formation of PeDs decreases the number of molecules. Therefore, too high reaction temperature may hinder the formation of PeDs. One typical mechanism of CO hydrogenolysis is the multi-step one composed of dehydration catalyzed by acid and hydrogenation catalyzed by metal [7]. The hydrogenolysis of glycerol into 1,2-propanediol over the combination of Ru/C and acidic Amberlyst is a typical example [16–19]. In the case of THFA, one system composed of three separated steps has been known: dehydration of THFA to dihydropyran, hydration of dihydropyran to δ-hydroxyvaleraldehyde, and hydrogenation of δ-hydroxyvaleraldehyde to 1,5-PeD (Eq. (1)) [20]. (1) This ‘indirect’ system requires the isolation and purification of the intermediates and the overall yield was 70%. Other types of mechanism may proceed depending on the types of catalysts and reaction media used. In the hydrogenolysis of glycerol, the proposed mechanisms include the two-step dehydration–hydrogenation mechanism as mentioned above, the three-step dehydrogenetaion–dehydration–hydrogenation mechanism over copper catalysts and the direct mechanism where hydride species on noble metal directly attacks the adsorbed substrate [21]. However, the mechanism of each system is still under debate, and in some cases different mechanisms have been proposed to very similar systems by different research groups."
2,Rh-based catalysts,
3,Performances of supported RhMO x catalysts,"3.1 Performances of supported RhMO x catalysts Rhodium is a catalytically active element for CO hydrogenolysis under the conditions of high pressure H2 (≤10MPa) and temperature around 373K. Our group has tested various monometallic supported noble-metal catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of aqueous glycerol [22]. Rh/SiO2 showed the highest activity and selectivity to CO dissociation in the catalysts tested (Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt supported on SiO2, C and Al2O3). Performances of Rh-based catalysts for THFA hydrogenolysis are summarized in Table 2 [23–26]. Rh/SiO2 catalyzes hydrogenolysis of aqueous THFA [23,24]. The main product is 1,2-PeD (62% selectivity) at 5.7% conversion at 393K. The selectivity to 1,5-PeD is 18%, and that to degradation products is 14%. Commercial Ru/C, copper chromite, and Raney Ni showed less activity and much higher selectivity to degradation products [23], while copper catalysts including copper chromite have been known to be active in the hydrogenolysis of CO bond in the side chains of furan compounds such as furfural, furfuryl alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to give alkyl-substituted furans such as methylfuran and dimethylfuran [27,28]. Modification of Rh/SiO2 with Re, Mo or W is very effective to enhance the catalytic performance [24]. The modified catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation method using RhCl3, NH4ReO4, (NH4)6Mo7O24 and (NH4)4W10O32 as precursors. The catalytic activity is increased almost one order by addition of the optimized amount of the modifier. The modification also drastically changed the selectivity: 1,5-PeD is produced as a main product in ≥80% selectivity and 1,2-PeD is not produced at all even when Rh/SiO2 is modified with 0.06mol/mol-Rh of additive. The degradation side-reactions are also suppressed by the modification. The optimum amount of the modifier is 0.50, 0.13 and 0.13mol/mol-Rh for Re, Mo and W, respectively. Higher or lower amount of the modifier than these values decreases the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of the optimized catalysts decreases in the following order: RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.5)>RhMoO x /SiO2 (Mo/Rh=0.13)≫RhWO x /SiO2 (W/Rh=0.13). However, in the conditions of very dilute THFA (1% aqueous solution), RhMoO x /SiO2 is rather higher activity than RhReO x /SiO2. Therefore, in terms of obtaining high yield of 1,5-PeD, RhMoO x /SiO2 is not inferior to RhReO x /SiO2. Lower reaction temperature and longer reaction time is favorable to the higher 1,5-PeD yield. Higher temperature leads overhydrogenolysis of 1,5-PeD to 1-PeOH. The maximum yield of 1,5-PeD is 86% over RhReO x /SiO2 at 373K using 5% THFA aqueous solution. The comparable yield of 85% is obtained over RhMoO x /SiO2 at 373K in shorter reaction time (about 2/3 of the time required for RhReO x /SiO2). Without Rh, monometallic ReO x /SiO2, MoO x /SiO2, and WO x /SiO2 show almost no activity, indicating the synergy between Rh and the additive metal. The stability of the catalysts was checked by the reuse experiments. The used catalyst was recovered by centrifugation and reused. RhReO x /SiO2 shows slight decrease in activity during reuses (79 and 65% conversion (12h reaction at 393K) in the first and fifth runs, respectively) while selectivities are not changed. Slight Re leaching was observed by ICP analysis. On the other hand, RhMoO x /SiO2 can be reused without loss of activity (53.5% and 53.0% conversion in the first and fifth runs, respectively). The XRD patterns and EXAFS spectra of fresh RhMO x /SiO2 (M=Re and Mo) after reduction are almost identical to those of used catalysts. The combination of Rh and Re can be applied for carbon-supported catalysts [25]. We prepared RhReO x /C by impregnating aqueous NH4ReO4 on commercial Rh/C. The optimum amount of Re is Re/Rh=0.25. The RhReO x /C (Re/Rh=0.25) shows slightly less activity than RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.5) and very high selectivity to 1,5-PeD (≥95% in initial stage). The highest yield of 1,5-PeD is 94%. Chia et al. prepared RhReO x /C catalyst by sequentially impregnating XC-72 carbon with aqueous RhCl3 and NH4ReO4 [26]. The RhReO x /C (Re/Rh=0.5) catalyst shows very high selectivity to 1,5-PeD (97% selectivity at 47% conversion) at 393K, similar to our catalysts. They also prepared RhMoO x /C from XC-72, RhCl3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24. The RhMoO x /C (Mo/Rh=0.1) has slightly less activity and selectivity to 1,5-PeD than RhReO x /C. Supports other than C and SiO2 are less explored."
4,"Characterization of supported RhMO x (M=Re, Mo) catalysts","3.2 Characterization of supported RhMO x (M=Re, Mo) catalysts We characterized RhReO x /SiO2 and RhMoO x /SiO2 with various techniques [23,24,29–31]. The TPR profiles of calcined Rh/SiO2, RhReO x /SiO2 and RhMoO x /SiO2 show that the reduction is stopped below the temperature for the catalytic reaction (≥373K). The amount of H2 consumption of Rh/SiO2 agrees with the stoichiometry of the reduction of Rh2O3 to Rh metal. The amount of H2 consumption of RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.13, 0.5) and RhMoO x /SiO2 (Mo/Rh=0.13) corresponds to the partial reduction of ReO x and MoO x to the valence of around +3 and around +4, respectively, in addition to the total reduction of Rh2O3 [31]. The peak temperature is below the temperature range where the reduction of ReO x /SiO2 and MoO x /SiO2 proceeds (533–553K and 708–713K, respectively). These data suggest that all the added Re or Mo is affected by the presence of Rh species and the reduction of Re and Mo species is promoted probably via spilt-over hydrogen species from Rh to Re and Mo. In the case of RhReO x /SiO2, we also performed Re L 3-edge XANES to determine the average Re valence [29]. The first peak in the L 3-edge XANES is called as a white line, and the white line area in the L 3-edge XANES is known to be an informative indication of the electronic state. The larger white line intensity is due to greater electron vacancy in d-orbital, indicating the high valence state. The ionic valence of Re species on RhReO x /SiO2 can be determined by the relation between the ionic valence and the white line intensity of the reference compounds such as metallic Re and various rhenium oxides. The average valence of reduced RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.5) determined from the relation is +2.2. In the XRD patterns of Rh/SiO2, RhReO x /SiO2 and RhMoO x /SiO2 after the reduction or catalytic use, a peak around 2θ =41° assigned to Rh metal is detected [23,24,29]. The Rh metal particle size is around 3nm and is hardly influenced by the presence of ReO x and MoO x . The peak due to Re and Mo species is not detected, indicating that the Re and Mo species is highly dispersed. TEM analysis also shows the presence of particles with average size of about 3nm in all of these catalysts. The number of surface Rh atoms can be determined by the measurement of the amount of adsorbed CO because CO is adsorbed more preferably on the surface of Rh atoms than of oxide species at room temperature [23,24,29,31]. The number of surface atoms determined by XRD and CO adsorption is shown in Table 3 . In the case of reduced Rh/SiO2, the amount of adsorbed CO well accords with the number of surface Rh atoms determined by XRD peak width and Scherrer's equation. On the other hand, the amount of adsorbed CO on RhReO x /SiO2 and RhMoO x /SiO2 is significantly lower than that of Rh/SiO2 although the average Rh metal particle sizes are similar. This behavior indicates that the CO adsorption is suppressed by the presence of ReO x or MoO x . The suppressed amount of CO adsorption agrees with the additive amount of Re or Mo when the additive amount is low (M/Rh≤0.13). This suggests that one Re or Mo atom inhibits the adsorption of approximately one CO molecule. At the same time, this means that all added Re and Mo atoms interact with Rh metal surface. In the cases of RhMO x /SiO2 with M/Rh>0.13 (M=Re, Mo), the suppressed amount of CO adsorption is lower than the additive amount, suggesting that a part of added Re and Mo does not contribute to the suppression of CO adsorption by the way such as the formation of multilayer structure and the location on the support. In order to characterize the interaction of Re or Mo species with Rh metal particles, Re L 3-edge, Mo K-edge and Rh K-edge EXAFS analyses were carried out (Table 4 ) [23,24,31]. The data of reduced fresh catalyst and the one after use is essentially identical [29,30]. In the case of Re L 3-edge EXAFS, it is easy to distinguish between Rh and Re as a backscattering atom. The curve fitting of the spectra of RhReO x /SiO2 indicates the presence of ReO, ReRh and ReRe bonds. The fitting of the spectra using only two different bonds (ReO+ReRh and ReO+ReRe) cannot give a good fit. The presence of the ReO bond indicates that Re species is in the partially oxidized state, which is supported by the TPR and Re L 3-edge XANES results. The presence of ReRh bond demonstrates the interaction between Re species and Rh metal particles. The bond length of the ReRh bond (0.266–0.268nm) is similar to that of RhRh bond in Rh metal (0.268nm) and it is shorter than that of RhORh bond in Rh2O3 (0.301nm). The bond length of ReRe bond (0.271–0.273nm) in RhReO x /SiO2 is comparable to that of the ReRe bond in Re metal (0.274nm). These results indicate that no oxygen atoms are located between Re atoms or between Rh and Re atoms. The coordination number (CN) of the ReRh bond (3.3–3.8) can be explained by the adsorption of Re atoms at three-fold hollow site of (111) surface and/or at four-fold hollow site of (100) surface. The CN of ReRe bond (2.0–2.8) is due to the clustering of adsorbed Re species on the surface of Rh metal particles. The almost constant CN of the ReRh bond in the range of Re/Rh≤0.5 suggests that the ReO x clusters have 2-dimensional structure on the Rh metal surface. In the EXAFS analysis, it is impossible to distinguish between Mo and Rh as a backscattering atom because the atomic number of Rh and Mo is similar. Curve fitting of Mo K-edge EXAFS of RhMoO x /SiO2 shows the presence of MoO and MoRh (or Mo) bonds. The distance of MoRh (or Mo) bond (0.262–0.265nm) is comparable to those of MoMo bond in Mo metal (0.267nm) and RhRh bond in Rh metal (0.268nm). This represents that the Mo atoms are directly interacted with Rh or other Mo atoms, unlike the MoORh or MoOMo, although the MoO bond is present. The small CN of MoRh (or Mo) bond can be interpreted by the isolated Mo species on Rh metal surface, for example, three-fold hollow site of Rh (111) surface. Rh K-edge EXAFS analyses of Rh/SiO2 and RhMO x /SiO2 (M=Re, Mo) give results consistent with those discussed above. RhO bond is not detected in these catalysts after use. The CN (9.8) of RhRh bond in Rh/SiO2 is very smaller than that of bulk Rh metal with fcc structure (CN=12), supporting the formation of small metal particles. The CN of RhRh (or Mo) in RhMoO x /SiO2 catalysts is nearly equal to that of Rh/SiO2. In the case of RhReO x /SiO2, RhRe and RhRh bonds are present and the interaction between ReO x species and Rh metal surface is verified from the side of Rh. The CN of RhRh on RhReO x /SiO2 with various Re contents is almost the same as that of Rh/SiO2, suggesting the similar size of Rh metal particles. Based on the above characterization, a model structure of RhMoO x /SiO2 (Mo/Rh=0.13) and RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.13) is depicted (Fig. 3 ) [31]. The surface Rh atoms with adjoining Mo or Re atom are represented by gray circles and those without adjoin Re are represented by open circles. The former type of Rh site is considered to be a catalytically active site, and the latter type is not. Formation of ReO x cluster in the case of RhReO x /SiO2 lowers the number of Rh atoms adjoining additive atom than in the case of RhMoO x /SiO2, which may cause the larger optimum amount of Re (Re/Rh=0.5) than Mo (Mo/Rh=0.13)."
5,"Reaction mechanism of the selective hydrogenolysis of THFA to 1,5-PeD","3.3 Reaction mechanism of the selective hydrogenolysis of THFA to 1,5-PeD As shown in Section 2, the indirect process of the conversion of THFA to 1,5-PeD via dihydropyran and δ-hydroxyvaleraldehyde has been developed. In order to check the contribution of this reaction route, we evaluated the reaction of dihydropyran over RhReO x /SiO2 (Re/Rh=0.5) under the presence of H2 [32]. The result shows that the formation of 1,5-PeD dehydration accompanies the tetrahydropyran formation (12% selectivity). However, the formation of tetrahydropyran is actually below the detection limit in the THFA hydrogenolysis over RhReO x /SiO2. Therefore, the reaction route over RhReO x /SiO2 is different from the indirect route via dihydropyran. (2) We proposed the reaction mechanism of the hydrogenolysis of THFA over RhReO x /SiO2 based on the data of the reactivity of various relating substrates (Table 5 ) and the reaction kinetics [32]. The hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran hardly proceeds over RhReO x /SiO2. Rh/SiO2 shows rather higher activity for these substrates than RhReO x /SiO2. Therefore, the presence of CH2OH group in the substrate is very important. In addition, the position of the CH2OH group is also important. Hydrogenolysis of tetrahydro-5-methylfurfuryl alcohol and tetrahydropyran-2-methanol smoothly proceeds over RhReO x /SiO2 to form 1,6-hexanediol. 2-Alkoxyethanol without tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydropyran ring can be also converted to ethanol and the corresponding alcohol. On the other hand, hydrogenolysis of 3-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran hardly proceeds. These reactivities show that the CO bond neighboring CH2OH group is selectively dissociated over RhReO x /SiO2. The reaction order with respect to the THFA concentration (20–60wt%) over RhReO x /SiO2 and Rh/SiO2 is almost zero and 0.4, respectively. The reaction order indicated that RhReO x /SiO2 more strongly adsorbs THFA than Rh/SiO2, suggesting that ReOx species is responsible for the strong adsorption of THFA on RhReO x /SiO2. Since it has been known that adsorbed methoxy species is formed by the interaction between methanol and ReO x [33], THFA is thought to be adsorbed as a Re-alkoxide. It has been established that molybdenum oxides adsorb alcohol to form Mo-alkoxide species which serves as an intermediate of the oxidation of alcohol [34]. The reaction order with respect to H2 pressure (2–8MPa) is +1. The first reaction order with respect to H2 means that the activation of H2 is an important step. Generally, H2 molecule is dissociated to two hydrogen atoms on the metal surface (H2 →2H). In this case, it is known that the reaction order with respect to H2 pressure is 1/2 in the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism when the reaction of the hydrogen atom with the substrate is a rate-determining step. Another possible H2 activation is heterolytic activation (H2 →H+ +H−) [35]. The nature of the active hydrogen species was also investigated using ketone hydrogenation, which has been known to proceed by hydride transfer [36,37]. The RhReO x /SiO2 shows high catalytic activity in the acetol (=hydroxyacetone) hydrogenation and gives 1,2-propanediol as a main product (Eq. (3)). (3) On the other hand, Pd/C, which is known to activate H2 to two hydrogen atoms, has no activity in the same reaction conditions, and Rh/SiO2 also showed very low activity in the hydrogenation of acetol. From the results of acetol hydrogenation, it is suggested that hydride-like species are formed by the activation of H2 over RhReO x /SiO2 catalyst. The formation of hydride species means the heterolytic H2 activation which co-produces a proton. The presence of neighboring positively charged Re atom may induce the formation of hydride(-like) species on the Rh atom. In the case that the hydrogenolysis reaction can proceed by the attack of proton and/or hydride, the product selectivity is strongly influenced by the stability of cation and anion reaction intermediates. One typical reaction scheme is SN1-type one that consists of protonation of oxygen atom, dissociation of CO bond to form carbocation intermediate, and hydride transfer (proton→hydride mechanism). In the THFA hydrogenolysis, this proton→hydride mechanism can explain the product distribution. As shown in Eq. (4), 1,5-PeD is formed via more stable secondary carbocation. (4) However, in fact, this proton→hydride mechanism cannot explain the product distribution in the hydrogenolysis of tetrahydro-5-methylfurfuryl alcohol and 2-isopropoxyethanol. In the case of tetrahydropyran-5-methylfurfuryl alcohol, the carbocations formed by the proton attack are both secondary ones, suggesting the formation of both 1,5-hexanediol and 1,2-hexanediol (Eq. (5)). (5) However, in fact, the formation of 1,2-hexanediol is not detected. Furthermore, in the hydrogenolysis of 2-isopropoxyethanol by the proton attack, the formation of ethylene glycol and propane could be more preferable than that of ethanol and 2-propanol judging from the secondary cation intermediate as shown in Eq. (6). (6) This is completely opposite to the experimental result that RhReO x /SiO2 catalyzes the selective hydrogenolysis of 2-isopropoxyethanol to ethanol and 2-propanol. This discussion denies the proton→hydride mechanism. In addition, the effect of acid addition to the catalytic system is very small, also indicating the hydrogenolysis mechanism is not the proton→hydride one. It also suggests that the proton-transfer step is located after the rate-determining step. In contrast, the mechanism via the anion intermediate formed by the regioselective attack of hydride from the side of CH2OH group and subsequent protonation of the anion can explain the product distributions (Eqs. (7) and (8)). The attack of hydride produces alkoxide intermediates, and the difference of the stability of alkoxide intermediates is thought to be small, and the product distribution is not determined by the stability of the intermediates. (7) (8) The proposed regioselective hydride attack mechanism of RhReO x /SiO2-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of THFA is shown in Fig. 4 . First, THFA is adsorbed on ReO x cluster to form alkoxide species (i). Next, H2 is activated on Rh metal surface, and adsorbed hydride species and proton are formed (ii). The substrate bound on the interface between Rh and ReO x reacts with the adsorbed hydride species (iii). Reactions of the produced alkoxide with proton and another substrate release products (iv). The step (iv) also produces the alkoxide of substrate, followed by step (ii) of the next cycle. The mechanism of RhMoO x /SiO2-catalyzed hydrogenolysis can be similar. The product distributions in the hydrogenolysis of THFA and 2-alkoxyethanol and the reaction orders with respect to substrate (THFA) and H2 pressure over RhMoO x /SiO2 are essentially the same as those over RhReO x /SiO2 [24,31]. Chia et al. proposed another mechanism for hydrogenolysis of polyols and cyclic ethers including THFA catalyzed by RhReO x /C [26]. Based on the explanation, the presence of surface acid sites, which is confirmed by NH3 TPD, is important. The acidic hydroxyl groups on Re associated with Rh donates proton to the substrate, leading to the formation of carbenium ion transition states. The authors argued that the reactivity trends observed experimentally such as the higher selectivity to 1,5-PeD than 1,2-PeD are consistent with the DFT-calculated stabilization of resulting carbenium ion structures that can be formed on ring-opening or dehydration."
6,Miscellaneous systems,"3.4 Miscellaneous systems Buntara et al. use the combination of RhReO x /SiO2 with solid acid catalysts to convert tetrahydrofuran-2,5-dimethanol, which is the total-hydrogenation product of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, to 1,6-hexanediol [38]. RhReO x /SiO2 itself can catalyze the hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofuran-2,5-dimethanol to 1,2,6-hexanetriol. The combination with solid acid catalyst and long reaction time enables the one-pot conversion to 1,6-hexanediol and the highest 1,6-hexanediol yield is 86% using Nafion SAC-13 (Eq. (9)). Other solid acids such as zeolites show similar activities but lead to slightly lower selectivities to 1,6-hexanediol. Application of the RhReO x /SiO2-catalyzed hydrogenation directly on 5-hydroxymethylfurfural gave the formations of 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione as a main product (81% selectivity at full conversion) and 1,6-hexanediol with only 7% selectivity. (9) Chatterjee et al. use supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as reaction media in the THFA hydrogenolysis (Table 6 ) [39]. The use of scCO2 leads a high concentration of reactant gas such as H2, which allows kinetic control of reactions as opposed to limiting of reaction rates by the transport of the gaseous reactant across the gas–liquid interface. In addition, scCO2 is a well-established ecologically benign reaction medium. Without any additive, the Rh/MCM-41 catalyst shows high selectivity to 1,5-PeD (max. 91.2% at 80.5% conversion). The authors hypothesize that the presence of Rh2O3 and Rh0 particles on Rh/MCM-41 as confirmed by XRD can be the reason behind the selective formation of 1,5-PeD. Rh/Al2O3, Rh/C and Rh/SiO2 show less activity and selectivity to 1,5-PeD than Rh/MCM-41."
7,Catalysts based on other active metals than Rh,"Although Rh-based catalysts are the most active in the hydrogenolysis of aqueous THFA in simple monometallic catalysts, there are some reports using catalysts with another active metal to obtain good results. Xu et al. reported the development of Pt/Co2AlO4 catalysts and their performance in the direct conversion of furfural to 1,5-PeD [40]. The best catalyst is prepared by co-precipitation method and modified with small amount of Li. The 1,5-PeD yield reaches 34.9% (Eq. (10)). The time course of the reaction shows that 1,5-PeD is produced by the hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol intermediate and the reaction route via THFA to 1,5-PeD is negligible. The authors proposed that Co3+ site is mainly responsible for the adsorption of CC and the opening of the furan ring, and Pt works for the following hydrogenation (Eq. (11)). (10) (11) While palladium is usually a less active element in CO hydrogenolysis [22], Pd/C is reported to be active and very selective (>99% at 49% conversion) to 1,5-PeD in scCO2 (Table 6) [39]. Because the activity of Pd/C is lower than Rh/MCM-41 (conversions of 48.9% vs. 80.5% in the same conditions), Pd/C was not chosen for further study by the authors. Iridium lies just under rhodium in the periodic table. It has been known that iridium complexes, as well as rhodium counterparts, can activate H2 to give hydride complexes. We have very recently reported that IrReO x /SiO2 catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of glycerol into 1,3-propanediol with much higher selectivity than RhReO x /SiO2 [41,42]. The proposed mechanism based on the catalyst characterization, product distributions in the hydrogenolysis of related substrates, and the kinetic analysis is essentially the same as the mechanism proposed by us for RhReO x /SiO2 as discussed in Section 3.3. The application of the iridium-based catalysts to the hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofuran derivatives is now in progress."
8,Conclusions and outlook,"Tetrahydrofuran derivatives, especially THFA, are promising sources of organic chemicals that are currently produced from fossil fuels. Recent developments in catalysts such as rhodium-based ones modified with another metals have enabled the conversion of THFA to 1,5-PeD in high yields (≥85%). The formation of metal bond between Rh metal particles and partially reduced modifiers is a key to the high selectivity. Hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofuran-2,5-dimethanol, which can be produced from hexoses via 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, to 1,6-hexanediol is an also very promising reaction route in the conversions of biomass. Similar catalyst systems to those for THFA hydrogenolysis can be applied to the hydrogenolysis of tetrahydrofuran-2,5-dimethanol in combination with solid acid co-catalyst. To commercialize these processes, further developments in terms of the catalyst life and cost may be necessary. Design of the reaction systems including the reaction media may be also important since the separation of the reactant and products, both of which have rather high boiling points, are rather difficult. However, this research field is young and growing very rapidly, and the difficulties will be overcome in the near future."
