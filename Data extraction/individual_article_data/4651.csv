0,Introduction,"Ethanol and biodiesel have been thought of as the market–leading gasoline alternative due to the strong environmental appeal and to its mass production methods [1]. However, some limitations of these biofuels as a direct substitute to petroleum have inspired the development of alternative chemical catalytic transformation products and furfural and 2–methylfuran (furan type biofuel) are some examples [2]. Furfural is a raw material for production of furfuryl alcohol [3], a compound which in turn can produce biofuels additive [4]. Furfural can be produced either as a principal or secondary product from lignocellulose bio–refineries through dehydration of pentoses [5]. Besides, 2–methylfuran is considered better than ethanol in terms of production efficiency, energy density, handling and storage. It is particularly very attractive due to its physical and chemical properties, such as the research octane number (RON = 103) and its motor octane number (MON = 86) that are similar to those of gasoline [6]. Additionally, it is not soluble in water and can be used directly or blended with gasoline in motor vehicles [2]. 2–methylfuran is obtained from carbohydrates or cellulosic biomass and through reaction between furfural and hydrogen [7,8]. Its production process involves separation from the synthesis (hydrogenolysis) of HMF over a CuRu catalyst, extracting solvent and unreacted intermediates. Several solvents have been tested in the 2–methylfuran and furfural production and purification, among them 1–butanol, 2–butanol, 1–hexanol, methylisobutylketone and toluene [9,10]. In order to explore furfural and 2–methylfuran production processes and their applications as fuels and fuel additives, it is necessary to study excess thermodynamic properties of their mixtures with solvents [8,11–14]. The knowledge of thermodynamic properties of binary liquid mixtures is very important to process design and scale up and can be used as compound content monitoring tool for chemical process streams including mixing, reaction, separation and storage equipment. Such information are required, for instance, to obtain excess Gibbs energy of activation and excess molar enthalpies [11,15–17]. From a practical point of view, the ability of different available models to predict volumetric properties can be tested using such values [18]. A survey of the literature shows that densities and volumetric properties data available for {furfural or 2–methylfuran} + alcohols are scarce. 2–methylfuran binary mixtures with solvents were investigated previously employing 1,1,2,2–tetrachloroetane a solvent [19]; and furfural were investigated with 1–propanol, 2–propanol, 1–butanol and 2–butanol at 308.15 K [20]. The excess molar volumes of binary liquid mixtures of furfural + 1–butanol/2–butanol as function of the composition were measured by Bendiaf et al. [21] at 283.15, 293.15, 303.15 and 313.15 K, but no data were founded at 298.15 K. Volumetric behavior of solutions is commonly obtained through density measurements and molecular interactions between solute and solvent can be qualitatively investigated using excess and partial molar volumes [12,22–25]. Nature of such intermolecular interactions can be studied through FTIR analyses, such as those determined by Hasan et al. [26] for n–butyl acetate + primary alcohols systems. Thus, the study of excess thermodynamic properties with FTIR analyses for binary liquid mixtures containing furfural/2–methylfuran and alkanols is of considerable interest to understanding the behavior of intermolecular interactions, such as H–bonding interactions, presented in such systems. In this work, densities, excess molar volumes, partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes were determined for binary liquid mixtures of furfural + 1–propanol /1–pentanol/1–hexanol/2–propanol/2–butanol/2–pentanol and 2–methylfuran + 1–pentanol/1–hexanol/2–propanol/2–butanol/2–pentanol at T = 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. Furthermore, FTIR investigations for some mixtures were carried out to get information regarding the nature of molecular interactions between component molecules. To the best of our knowledge, these data were not reported before."
1,Experimental,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals All substances were degassed for 2 h by an ultrasonic method before each experiment and the glass vials were washed with detergent, water, methanol and doubly deionized water, and dried before use. The 2–methylfuran, furfural and alcohols utilized were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (USA). The purities of all reagents are given on the certificate by the manufacturer as shown in Table 1 . As can be observed in Table 1, the combined standard uncertainties for the density of 1–propanol (0.997 of mass fraction purity) was 0.3 kg.m−3 or 0.0003 (relative uncertainty), while for 1–hexanol (0.985 of mass fraction purity) was 1.4 kg.m−3 or 0.002 (relative uncertainty), indicating that, the largest contribution to the density measurement uncertainties can be impurities presented in the sample, as reported by Chirico et al. [39]. These authors estimated roughly the relative uncertainty for densities of a sample with 99% of purity to be u r ρ = 0.001 or 0.1%. Therefore, for the present article, the relative uncertainty results for the density were satisfactory. On the other hand, the relative deviations (RD) between the experimental densities and those found in the literature are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, most deviations are within the range from 0.003 to 0.146% and the average absolute relative deviation was 0.052%, which indicates the good quality of the experimental data."
3,Experimental apparatus and procedures,"2.2 Experimental apparatus and procedures 2.2.1 Density measurements Liquid mixtures with known composition were prepared by mass directly in glass vials using an analytical balance (Shimadzu AS200 Japan), with an accuracy of ±0.1 kg. The liquid mixture was then collected using a syringe and immediately introducing into densimeter. Time spent between the preparing and handling of the mixture for density measurement was 30 s approximately for each individual binary solution sample. Experimental densities for pure compounds and binary liquid mixtures were measured at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa using a DMA 5000 densimeter (Anton Paar, Austria) with an accuracy of 0.05 kg.m−3. Density determination was based on measuring the period of oscillation of a vibrating U–shaped tube filled with sample fluid, which is directly related to the sample fluid density. During the operation, temperature was kept constant within ±0.01 K. The apparatus was calibrated with daily density measurements using Millipore quality water (Milli–Q Synthesis, France), i.e., ultrapure reagent grade type 1 water (deionized, doubly distilled and degassed) and dry air at atmospheric pressure according to the manual instructions. In order to minimize errors in mixture composition due to preferential evaporation, the liquid with higher vapor pressure at 298.15 K was weighed first. Vapor pressure for all substances used in this work are shown in Table 1. Thus, for system with 2–methylfuran, alcohols were weighed first; for systems with furfural, it was weighed first. Methodology used here was tested by measuring experimentally the density of binary system composed for water + ethanol at 298.15 K. The densities, the excess molar volumes and the Redlich–Kister parameters are presented in Tables S1 and S2 and graphically in Figs. S1 and S2 (available in Supplementary Data). As can be seen, there is a very satisfactory agreement between our experimental densities and those reported in the literature for water + ethanol at 298.15 K [40–42]. Combined standard uncertainties ( u c ) for densities of pure compounds and mixtures were calculated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [43] and Eurachem [44] following a similar approach used by Dalmolin et al. [45]. The equations for the assessment of the combined standard uncertainty for densities, excess molar volumes, partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes data, using purity of the compounds, accuracy of the experimental apparatus and propagation of the uncertainties from the variables and constraints to the excess thermodynamic property in question are provided also as Supplementary Data. 2.2.2 FTIR analyses FTIR measurements for pure compounds, furfural/2–methylfuran + alcohols binary liquid mixtures (x 1 = 0.5 solute molar fractions) and furfural/2–methylfuran + 1–hexanol (all composition range) were carried out with a ReactIR 45 spectrometer (Mettler–Toledo)."
4,Excess molar volumes and Redlich–Kister correlation,"Density measurements were utilized to determine excess molar volumes, V m E , for binary liquid mixtures, through Eq. (1): (1) V m E = ∑ i = 1 2 x i M i 1 ρ - 1 ρ i = x 1 M 1 1 ρ - 1 ρ 1 + x 2 M 2 1 ρ - 1 ρ 2 where xi is molar fraction of ith component; Mi is the ith component’s molar mass (kg.kmol−1); ρ is the mixture’s density (kg.m−3); ρi is the ith component’s density (kg.m−3); x 1, M 1 and ρ 1 are molar mass and density of solute (kg.m−3), respectively; and x 2, M 2 and ρ 2 are molar mass and density of solvent (kg.m−3), respectively. Excess molar volume data were submitted to mathematical modeling with Redlich–Kister equation [46]: (2) V m E = x 1 1 - x 1 ∑ i = 0 n A i 1 - 2 x 1 i where A 0 , A 1 , A 2 and A 3 are the Redlich–Kister parameters (m3.mol−1), determined in this work using non–linear fit tool of Microcal Origin® 9.1; n is the number of parameters utilized. Correlated excess molar volumes were compared to experimental ones utilizing average of absolute deviations, δ V m E , given by Eq. (3): (3) δ V m E = 1 N ∑ i V m E exp , i - V m E calc , i where subscripts exp and calc refers to experimental and correlated with Redlich–Kister equation excess molar volumes, respectively; N is number of experimental points. Partial molar volumes (m3.mol−1) of solute, V m , 1 , and solvent, V m , 2 , could be obtained from excess molar volumes calculations through Eqs. (4a) and (4b) [11], respectively: (4a) V m , 1 = V m E + V 1 ∗ + 1 - x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P (4b) V m , 2 = V m E + V 2 ∗ - x 1 ∂ V m E ∂ x 1 T , P where V 1 ∗ and V 2 ∗ are the molar volume for pure solute and solvent (m3‧mol−1), respectively. The derivative presented in Eq. (4a) and (4b) were determined through differentiation of Eq. (2). In order to find minima and maxima for excess molar volumes determined, the derivative is equal to zero after fitted parameters were determined. Excess partial molar volumes were obtained from partial molar volumes using Eqs. (5a) and (5b) [11]: (5a) V m , 1 E = V m , 1 - V 1 ∗ (5b) V m , 2 E = V m , 2 - V 2 ∗"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Furfural + alcohol systems,"4.1 Furfural + alcohol systems Densities, excess molar volumes, partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes determined for furfural (1) + alcohols (2) liquid mixtures at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa are shown in Table 2 . Results presented for the furfural + alcohol liquid mixtures shown a higher combined standard uncertainty for furfural mass fraction uc (x 1) equal to 0.65%. For these mixtures, the combined standard uncertainty of V m E increased from 0.9 to 2.2 × 10−7 m3.mol−1. The higher combined standard uncertainty of V m E , mainly caused by impurities, is attributed for the furfural + 1–hexanol mixtures. Excess molar volumes determined for systems with furfural are shown for primary and secondary alcohols in Fig. 1 a and c, respectively. For furfural + secondary alcohols, V m E and V m . 1 are presented in Fig. 1b and d, respectively. Redlich–Kister fitted curves are presented together with experimental data in Fig. 1. The adjusted parameters are presented in Table 3 . In Fig. 1a, it can be verified that for 1–propanol + furfural mixtures presented negative excess molar volumes, and they become positive as alcohol carbon chain increased for 1–pentanol and 1–hexanol. Considering the first derivative equal to zero and applying adjusted parameters, maximum and minimum values for excess molar volume and the respective furfural molar fraction are found equal to (in increasing order for V m E ): V m E = −0.2325 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.4393) for 1–propanol, V m E = −0.2100 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.3826) for 2–propanol, V m E = 0.1358 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.3536) for 2–butanol, V m E = 0.0643 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.2668) for 1–pentanol, V m E = 0.1440 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.5763) for 2–pentanol, V m E = 0.2525 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.4408) for 1–hexanol. Negative excess molar volumes indicate attraction interactions or volume contraction, as pointed out by Aman–Pommier and Jallut [25], or a closer molecular packing, as mentioned by Lehmann et al. [47], are presented in systems with 1–propanol. This attraction gives place to repulsion interactions for systems with 1–pentanol and 1–hexanol. Such interactions can be explained by stronger attraction H–bond between furfural carbonyl group and 1–propanol hydroxyl group, and breaking of these bonds joined with steric hindrance due to an increase in alkyl group in 1–pentanol and 1–hexanol [22]. Furfural + 2–butanol system presents higher excess molar volumes than furfural + 2–pentanol for furfural molar fraction smaller than 0.4395, and the opposite occurs for higher concentrations. This effect was observed by Iloukhani et al. [33], and can be explained by a decrease in H–bond followed by an increase in van der Waals forces due to higher –CH2– groups in furfural + 2–pentanol system. As x 1 is greater than 0.4395, H–bond interactions between furfural and 2–butanol are greater than van der Waals forces presented for furfural + 2–pentanol, due to the high alcohol content. Moreover, the excess molar volumes for furfural + 2–butanol mixture at 298.15 K was compared with furfural + 2–butanol mixtures at 293.15 K and 303.15 K reported previously in the literature by Bendiaf et al. [21]. There is an agreement until 0.3 furfural mass fraction as can see in Fig. 1b, even though that the density at 298.15 K is very consistent as showed in Fig. 2 . Comparing furfural + 1–propanol and furfural + 2–propanol mixtures, propyl and isopropyl groups give almost similar H–bond attraction effect in excess molar volume with furfural molecule, but for 2–butanol this effect no longer occur, giving rise to repulsion of furfural molecule by isoalkyl groups. Furfural partial molar volumes in systems studied in this work (Fig. 1c and d) indicate that, for primary alcohols and furfural molar fractions smaller than 0.8, V m . 1 increases as alcohol chain length increases; for secondary alcohols this also occurs, except for furfural + 2–pentanol."
7,2–Methylfuran + alcohol systems,"4.2 2–Methylfuran + alcohol systems Densities, excess molar volumes, partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes determined for 2–methylfuran (1) + alcohols (2) liquid mixtures at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa are shown in Table 4 . For 2–methylfuran + primary alcohols, excess molar volumes and 2–methylfuran partial molar volumes are presented in Fig. 3 a and c, respectively. For 2–methylfuran + secondary alcohols, V m E and V m . 1 are presented in Fig. 3b and d, respectively. Results reported for the 2–methylfuran + alcohol mixtures in Table 4 show a higher combined standard uncertainty for 2–methylfuran mass fraction uc (x 1) determined to be 0.85%. For these mixtures, a higher combined standard uncertainty of V m E was found to be 2.1 × 10−7 m3.mol−1 for the 2–methylfuran + 1–hexanol mixtures, this is mainly caused by the impurity of 2–methylfuran (1%) added to the impurity of 1–hexanol (1.5%). It can be verified in Fig. 3a and b that system with 2–methylfuran presented positive values of excess molar volumes, indicating that 2–methylfuran and alcohols molecules tend to repulse each other, diminishing system’s density compared to ideal mixing behavior. Another observation is that as alcohol chain length increases excess molar volumes also increase, possibly indicating that an increasing in alcohol aliphatic character provided by the addition of a methyl group diminishes H–bond strength with 2–methylfuran molecule. Besides, H–bond between oxygen atom of 2–methyl furan and hydroxyl group of alcohols seems to be the main interaction here, since –CH3 group in 2–methyl furan molecule could only contribute to increase van der Waals interactions with –CH2– groups of alcohols. As pointed out for furfural systems, taking first derivative equal to zero and fitted parameters, maximum values for excess molar volume, in increasing order for V m E , and the respective 2–methylfuran molar fraction are found equal to: V m E = 0.2665 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.7091) for 2–propanol, V m E = 0.4196 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.6365) for 2–butanol, V m E = 0.1136 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.5212) for 1–pentanol, V m E = 0.4884 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.5574) for 2–pentanol, and V m E = 0.2580 × 10−6 m3.mol−1 (x 1 = 0.5949) for 1–hexanol. 2–Methylfuran + 1–pentanol presented smaller positive excess molar volumes than 2–methylfuran + 2–pentanol possibly because greater aliphatic character of 1–pentanol increases van der Waals interactions with 2–methylfuran, approximating these molecules and resulting in higher density than furfural + 2–pentanol. Moreover, for 2–methylfuran + 1–pentanol where x 1 = 0.0266, V m E = −0.0019 × 10−6 m3.mol−1, showing for very low 2–methylfuran molar fraction this system presented a decrease volume after mixing, probably due to an attraction caused by these van der Waals forces. 2–Methylfuran partial molar volumes (Fig. 3c and d) determined indicate that, for alcohols studied, V m , 1 increases as alcohol chain length increases, for primary and secondary alcohols. The results obtained for V m , 1 are all positive at all compositions."
8,Excess partial molar volumes,"4.3 Excess partial molar volumes Excess partial molar volumes determined in this work and presented in Tables 2 and 4 indicate that when V m , 1 E = V m , 2 E maximum or minimum V m E values are obtained for all systems. As an example, {furfural or 2–methylfuran} + 2–propanol systems are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be verified in Fig. 4 that when lines calculated through Redlich–Kister for V m , 1 E cross the ones for V m , 2 E the molar fraction where excess molar volumes are minimum or maximum as shown in Figs. 1b and 3b, for furfural and 2–methylfuran systems, respectively, are obtained."
9,FTIR results,"4.4 FTIR results FTIR results obtained for all solvents and binary systems studied with solute molar fraction equal to 0.5 are shown in in Fig. 5 a, where it is verified that, since alcohols are protic they highly associated through hydrogen bonding (band at 3330 cm−1) and this association decreases with an increase in alkyl chain length in 1–alkanol [26,48]. Furfural and 2–methylfuran present different spectra when mixed with same alcohols. When furfural is mixed, intermolecular H–bond presented by pure solvents are shifted from 3330 cm−1 to 3430 cm−1; when 2–methylfuran is utilized such interactions are between 3370 and 3330 cm−1. Moreover, binary systems present bands at 3135 cm−1 and 3122 cm−1 for furfural and 2–methylfuran, respectively, which do not exist in pure solvents and are due to C–H stretching of five–membered heterocyclic molecules [49]. Bands between 2970 and 2860 cm−1 are shown for pure solvents and binary mixtures and are due to C–H bond. The effect of type of solute, furfural or 2–methylfuran, in excess molar volumes show that intensity of intermolecular H–bond can be the main cause for smaller V m E values in furfural systems compared with 2–methylfuran systems. Exception should be made when 1–hexanol is utilized, since excess molar volumes curves have a similar maximum V m E value for different solute molar fractions as shown in Fig. 6 . It can be stated that for x1 < 0.5, intermolecular hydrogen bonds are greater for 2–methylfuran, as shown by ≈3330 cm−1 bands with greater intensity in Fig. 5b. As concentration increases, such intensity are decreased and became almost equal for 80 mol%. In this concentration, excess molar volumes for furfural + 1–hexanol are smaller than 2–methylfural + 1–hexanol, which can be explained by the intensity of 3135 cm−1 band in furfural systems, which can be attributed to a greater interaction between aromatic heterocycles in furfural than 2–methylfuran."
10,Conclusions,"Densities were experimentally measured for {furfural or 2–methylfuran} + {1–propanol or 2–propanol or 2–butanol or 1–pentanol or 2–pentanol or 1–hexanol} at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. Such data were used to obtain excess molar volumes, solute and solvent partial molar volumes and excess partial molar volumes. Excess molar volumes were correlated with Redlich–Kister equation presenting average of absolute deviations smaller than 0.0164. Systems with furfural + 1–propanol or 2–propanol presented negative values for excess molar volumes, indicating strong H–bond interactions lead to a close molecular packing in these compared to other systems studied. Besides, all other systems presented positive excess molar volumes. Furfural or 2–methylfuran partial molar volumes increase as alcohol carbon chain length increase, except for furfural + 2–pentanol, which show smaller values than 2–butanol for molar fractions below 0.2. Maximum and minimum points were detected when V m , 1 E = V m , 2 E . FTIR analyses were used to explain the intermolecular interactions and excess molar volumes presented in systems studied here, where furfural shifted –OH stretching wavenumber from 3330 cm−1 to 3430 cm−1 and band presented at 3135 cm−1 and 3122 cm−1 indicate the influence of five–membered heterocycle, showing excess molar volumes are smaller for furfural systems than for 2–methylfuran."
