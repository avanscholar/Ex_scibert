0,Introduction,"Alcohol consumption and its related toxicity have shown to be third most communal cause of morbidity and it occupies fifth most public cause of disease burden worldwide [1,2]. World Health Organization has stated that over the 2014, 3.3 million deaths were recorded due to excess intake of alcohol [3]. On the other hand, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (2020) has reported that, about 88,0005 deaths were recorded every year due to abnormal alcohol intake [4]. However, the risk of alcohol consumption has a pivotal factor that could be involved in molecular and cellular mechanisms of tissue injury [5]. Moreover, overconsumption of alcohol can cause an augmented disease burden which distressing several more organs such as liver, eye, brain, kidney, reproductive system and heart etc., [6,7]. The liver is a more important target organ of ethanol mediated toxicity that can cause inflammation, steatosis and oxidative stress [8]. The onset of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been linked with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulation of cellular signaling molecules in the liver [9]. Primarily, the elevation of ROS could cause pathogenesis in alcohol associated hepatotoxicity. The overproduction of ROS includes superoxide anion, nitric oxide, hydroxyl radicals, etc., consequently resulted in oxidative stress in macromolecules and resultant in the ultimate synthesis of lipid peroxidation [10]. Antioxidant enzymes and nonenzymes are involved to protect and/or safeguard cells from the ROS and lipid peroxidation mediated oxidative damage [11]. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly preserved serine therionine kinaseses which include JNK, ERK, and p38 involved in oxidative stress and apoptosis [12]. These MAPKs family proteins are subsequently phosphorylated by overproduction of ROS during the exposure of ethanol ensuing cellular damage in hepatocytes [13]. The nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factors (Nrf2), a crucial antioxidant gene transcription factor may over regulate the array of downstream target genes in order to make cytoprotection [14]. There are numerous studies were documented that Nrf2 activation has been implicated as a possible therapeutic invention for the treatment of alcoholism depended hepatic disease [15]. Besides, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) also shown as an attracted biomarker, which was over expressed during the stress in hepatocytes and it is also participating in several biological activities. The cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) has shown to be critically involved in ROS overproduction during the ethanol metabolisms that result in liver injury [16]. The transcriptional role of Nrf2 positively regulates the HO-1 and negatively regulates MAPKs related proteins and CYP 2E1 protein in hepatocytes [17]. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the most critical and sensitive biomarkers to understand the liver function and it can protect the liver from the toxic substances and/or radicals. The failure of these enzyme activities is directly implicated in hepatic cell apoptosis [18]. p-Coumaric acid (PCA), belongs to the hydroxycinnamic acid family of a phenolic derivative. PCA has been extensively found in plants and mushrooms and it has the strongest antioxidant in nature. PCA is widely dispersed in fruits and vegetables (e.g. Apples, berries, pears, grapes, oranges, tomatoes, beans, potatoes, and onions) [19]. Huge investigations have found that PCA display various biological functions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, antitumor, anti-ulcer, antiplatelet and atherosclerosis; PCA also protects cardiac damage, UV-induced ocular tissue damage, neuronal injury and diabetes [20]. Our earlier study, stated the PCA nullifies the toxic effect of alcohol on the reproductive system of rat [19]. Interestingly, PCA was also studied for its efficiency in inhibiting alcohol induced nephrotoxicity in rat kidney cells by blocking NF-kB transcription [20]. However, the role of PCA and the molecular mechanism behind the alcohol induced hepatic cells has not been understood yet. Therefore, we took the first stand to examine the role of the PCA on ethanol exposed hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress mediated MAPKs signaling, apoptosis and Nrf2 signaling in rat liver tissue."

3,In vitro cell culture,"2.2 In vitro cell culture In this experiment, we used normal human hepatocells (L-02) and human hepato carcinoma cells (HepG2) for the studies of ethanol induced hepatotoxicity. L-02 cells were procured from Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China and HepG2 cell lines were procured from NCCS, Pune, India. Both L-02 and HepG2 cells have been plated in DMEM culture and maintained at 37 ֯C temperature, 5% CO2 and 95% air environment."
4,MTT assay,"2.3 MTT assay MTT assay was performed to determine the nontoxic concentration of PCA and ethanol on L-20 and HepG2 cells [21]. The cells were equally distributed in the well with 100 μl of DMEM as final concentration. Further, the plates encompassing cells were incubated for 24 h in incubator. Following incubation, the cells were subjected to PCA treatment with varying concentration ranging from 10 to 100 μM. After 1 h cells were treated with ethanol and again incubated for another 24 h. Further 100 μg of MTT solution was added to the wells and incubated for 4 h to determine the viability of the cells. Finally, the cells were treated with DMSO (100 μl) to dislodge the purple formazan crystals. The plates were read at 570 nm in Multimode reader."

8,Animals and experimental design,"2.7 Animals and experimental design Male Wistar rats were used for determining the ethanol induced hepatotoxicity. All the experimental animals were maintained in fixed temperature (23 ± 2 °C), humidity (40 ± 5%) with an appropriate day/night cycle, and provided with nonrestricted admission to water and diet inside each respective cage. The experimental study was carried out in Bharathidasan University, Ethical Committee of the Experimental Animals under the registration number (BDU/IAEC/2017/NE/03/dt.21.03.2017). The entire experiments and the study were done with the guidelines of care and use of laboratory Animals. The experimental design was adopted from our previous study [19,20]. 30 Wister Albino rats were used for the study and grouped into five groups with 6 in each individual group. Group-1 served as control where rats remained untreated with regular diet with distilled water. Whereas, once in a week all the animals in group-2, 3, 4 and 5 were orally administrated with increased dose of ethanol 25% v/v (5,8,10 and 12 g/kg body weight in each group) for the period of 28 days [25]. During 3rd and 4th week, the experimental groups-3, 4 and 5 rats were orally administrated with PCA with three varying concentrations ranging from 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg b. wt; 1 h prior to ethanol treatment. Finally, at the end of the experiment animals were killed after overnight fasting and liver samples from each group were collected for performing various experiments."
9,Activities of liver marker enzymes,"2.8 Activities of liver marker enzymes The liver marker enzymes such as AST, ALT, and ALP were measured by using the method of King & Armstrong, (1954) [26]. Whereas, the enzymes GGT (γ glutamyl transpeptidase), LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) were measured by using the following methods Rosalki and Rau., (1972) [27] and King, (1965) [28]."
10,Estimation of antioxidants and lipid peroxidations,"2.9 Estimation of antioxidants and lipid peroxidations Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and conjugated dienes (CD) are considered as a product of lipid peroxidation and were studied by previous methods Niehaus et al., 1968 [29]; Klien et al., 1984 [30]. Non enzymatic antioxidants like reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C and vitamin E were measured by standard biochemical estimation, previously described Ellman, 1959 [31]; Omaye and Turnbill, 1979 [32]; Baker and Frank, 1968 [33]. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione reductase (GR), Glutathione-s-transferase (GST), and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are enzymatic antioxidants which was measured by the standard method, previously described Kakkar et al., 1984 [34]; Sinha, 1972 [35];. Mannervik, 1999 [36]; Habig et al., 1974 [37]; Rotruck et al., 1973 [38]."
11,Immunoblot analysis,"2.10 Immunoblot analysis After the proper treatment rat liver tissues were collected and the clear protein was extracted by the use of RIPA buffer with protease cocktail inhibitor. The exact protein concentration has been tested by Bradford assay. The protein expression pattern of MAPKs families' markers (p-ERK1, p-JNK, and p-p38) and Nrf2 signaling markers (Nrf2, CYPE21, and HO-1) were demonstrated by western blotting analysis. The interest of proteins has been normalized to β-actin, a respective normal control. Following the protein estimation, the treated test samples were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and the proteins from the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and treated with interest of primary antibodies with dilution range of 1:1000 and secondary antibodies with dilution of 1:5000 to detect the interest of protein markers as per the method, described previously [39]."
12,Immunohistochemistry,"2.11 Immunohistochemistry The protein expression of apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-9 and caspase 3 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Appropriate antigens present in the kidney tissue sections were observed by exposing with a specific type of primary antibodies. Immunohistochemical images of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 3 protein expressions were studied as per the protocol, described previously [19]."
13,Histology,"2.12 Histology The protective role of PCA on ethanol mediated liver injury was tested by standard histopathological studies. After the treatment, rat liver tissues were collected and it was fixed with 10% formaldehyde to embedded in tissue paraffin. Then, the liver tissue sections were stained with standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The stained slides were analyzed by bright field microscope (Olympus CH20i, Japan) and the brief methodology was described previously [40]."
14,Statistical studies,"2.13 Statistical studies In the statistical studies, we used mean ± standard deviation (S.D). Moreover, significant differences between the control animals, ethanol treated animals, and PCA treated animals were statistically proved by Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) using with SPSS 11.0 version software package. The value p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant."
15,Results,
16,PCA protects ethanol induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells,"3.1 PCA protects ethanol induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells The nontoxic concentration of PCA was assessed by cytotoxic MTT assay. The nontoxic concentrations 10–100 μM of PCA were analyzed in both L-02 and HepG2 cells. As Fig. 1 A shown that PCA up to 80 μM concentrations in normal L-02 cells and up to 60 μM concentrations in HepG2 cells viability has not been reduced significantly. However, the PCA above 80 μM concentration substantially reduced cell viability in L-02 cells. In addition, above 70 μM concentration also produced toxicity in HepG2 cells. In addition, PCA on ethanol exposed cytotoxicity was assessed in both L-02 and HepG2 cells. Ethanol at 100 mM concentration has been used for the induction of liver toxicity. There are several reports are stated that ethanol (100 mM) produces liver cell toxicity in both L-02 and HepG2 cells [41]. We also performed dose dependent ethanol cytotoxicity in both L-02 and HepG2 cells by MTT assay (Data not shown). Fig. 1B shows that PCA (80 μM) significantly protects ethanol induced toxicity compared with PCA (40, 60 and 90 μM) other concentrations in L-02 cells. Moreover, Fig. 1C reveals that in HepG 2 cells PCA (60 μM) significantly prevents ethanol induced toxicity compared with PCA (20, 40 and 80 μM) other concentrations. Based on the results, nontoxic concentration of PCA has been used for further experiments."
17,PCA inhibits ethanol induced ROS production in both L-02 and HepG2 cells,"3.2 PCA inhibits ethanol induced ROS production in both L-02 and HepG2 cells Overproduction of ROS has been involved in damaging of cells which have considered as oxidative stress. As Fig. 2 illustrated that PCA on ethanol exposed overproduction of ROS in both L-02 and HepG2 cells was analyzed by DCFH-DA staining. Fig. 2AB shows increased ROS generation was observed in ethanol (100 mM) treatment of L-02 cells by observing a high level of DCFH staining was found. PCA (80 μM) significantly quenches intracellular ROS by observing diminished fluorescence intensity in ethanol exposed L-02 cells. Moreover, PCA treatment also impedes ethanol persuaded ROS production in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2CD). In this study, the significant protection dose of PCA was found to be80 μM and 60 μM in L-02 and HepG2 cells respectively."
18,PCA inhibits ethanol induced mitochondrion membrane alteration and apoptotic damage in both L-02 and HepG2 cells,"3.3 PCA inhibits ethanol induced mitochondrion membrane alteration and apoptotic damage in both L-02 and HepG2 cells The overproduction of ROS causes oxidative stress by damaging mitochondrion membrane potential and nuclear fragmentation. We noticed that ethanol exposure causes increased alteration of mitochondrion membrane potential in both L-02 and HepG2 cells. On the other hand, PCA (80 μM) treatment inhibits the ethanol mediated depolarization of membrane potential in L-02 cells by observing increased fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3AB). Moreover, PCA (60 μM) also protected the ethanol induced alteration of mitochondria in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 CD). In addition, ethanol induced nuclear fragmentation has been thought to be a hallmark event for apoptosis and it was analyzed by Hocheast staining (Fig. 3E). In this study, ethanol exposure causes increased nuclear fragmentation and brighter Hocheast staining in the nuclear portion of both L-02 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3E). However, the PCA treatment decreased ethanol induced nuclear fragmentation and there was no brighter Hocheast staining in the nuclear portion of both L-02 and HepG2 cells."
19,PCA protects ethanol induced hepatic damage in rat liver tissue,"3.4 PCA protects ethanol induced hepatic damage in rat liver tissue PCA on ethanol exposed liver damage was analyzed by Histopathological studies. In this experiment, we found that ethanol exposure caused a higher amount of microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in the rat liver tissue section compared to that the normal control rat (Fig. 4 ). However, the concentration dependent PCA administration showed reduced lipid accumulation and an extensive improvement in hepatic morphology in ethanol exposed rat liver tissue. Altogether, we found that PCA at 200 mg/kg b.wt exhibits higher protection on ethanol induced hepatic injury when compared to other doses of PCA such as 50 and 100 mg/kg b.wt."
20,PCA attenuates ethanol mediated liver injury in experimental rats,"3.5 PCA attenuates ethanol mediated liver injury in experimental rats Table 1 illustrated that liver marker such as AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and LDH were significantly enhanced in an ethanol feeding group as compared to control rats. Conversely, PCA treatment could reduce the activities of AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and LDH in dose dependent manner. On the whole, we found that PCA at 200 mg/kg bw) showed a remarkable activity when compared to other doses of PCA such as 50 and 100 mg/kg bw."
21,PCA restores ethanol induced enhanced lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidants in rat liver tissue,"3.6 PCA restores ethanol induced enhanced lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidants in rat liver tissue There was a significant elevation of lipid peroxides by-product TBARS, CD were detected in ethanol exposed rat liver tissue when compared to the control rat liver (Table 2 ). On the contrary, when the treatment of PCA with 3 different concentrations such as 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg bw magnificently reduced the levels of lipid peroxides, TBARS, CD in ethanol exposed rat liver tissues. SOD, catalase, Gpx, glutathione-s-transferase, GSH are enzymatic antioxidants; nonenzymatic marker such as reduced glutathione, vitamin C, E and A were significantly depleted in ethanol exposed rats’ tissue as compared to normal control. In addition, we have observed the depletion of both anti-oxidants markers were restored in animals, those treated with PCA (50,100 and 200 mg/kg b.wt) following ethanol exposure. Specifically, there has been splendid activity was observed in animals treated with PCA (200 mg/kg b.wt)."
22,PCA inhibits ethanol induced MAPKs signalling in rat liver tissues,"3.7 PCA inhibits ethanol induced MAPKs signalling in rat liver tissues PCA on ethanol mediated phosphorylation of ERK1, JNK and p38 in rat liver tissue was analyzed by western blotting (Fig. 5 ). There were tremendous overexpression of p-ERK1, p-JNK and p-p38 were noted in ethanol exposed rat liver tissues. On the other hand, ethanol induced over expression of p-ERK1, p-JNK and p-p38 were slightly down regulated by the treatment of PCA in rat liver tissues. Altogether, we have found that the PCA (200 mg/kg b.wt) showing remarkable ameliorative activity against when compared to other doses."
23,PCA modulates ethanol induced NrF2 signalling in rat liver tissues,"3.8 PCA modulates ethanol induced NrF2 signalling in rat liver tissues The potential role of PCA on ethanol mediated Nrf2 and its depended proteins were analyzed by Western blot. As Fig. 6 , shown CYP2E1 protein expression was highly increased in rat liver tissue treated by ethanol. There was inhibition in the overexpression of CYPSE1 in PCA treated animals on dose dependent manner. Moreover, the treatment of PCA following ethanol exposure has enhanced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in rat liver tissues. Hence, we found that PCA (200 mg/kg b.wt) shows remarkable protective activity when compared to other doses."
24,PCA protects ethanol induced apoptosis signalling in rat liver tissues,"3.9 PCA protects ethanol induced apoptosis signalling in rat liver tissues PCA on ethanol exposed apoptotic protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 7 , ethanol exposure causes apoptosis in rat liver tissue by observing overexpression of Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3 and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 compared to normal control rat liver tissue. However, PCA treatments inhibited the ethanol mediated Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3 downregulation and increased Bcl-2 expression in ethanol exposed apoptosis of rat liver tissue than ethanol exposed animal alone."
25,Discussion,"Consumption of excess alcohol induces several illnesses which include nephrotoxicity, infertility, cardiovascular, hepatotoxicity, and hepatocarcinoma etc [42]. Amongst, hepatotoxicity considered as major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. ROS mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis are known to be two key elements in the expansion and progression of alcohol mediated liver injury [43]. There are chemical based drugs are used for liver injury treatment, but it produces numerous toxicities to cells. Therefore, phytonutrients-based drug remedies are safe against toxicity. Furthermore, these drugs stimulate immune systems and it provides antioxidants to the health [44]. For that reason, we demonstrated the role of p-coumaric acid as strongest antioxidants in nature and protect ethanol exposed hepatic injury via Nrf2 mediated inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat liver tissue. Firstly, we examined the protective effects of PCA in alcohol mediated hepatic cells such as L-02 and HepG2. Our results highly demonstrated that PCA protects hepatocytes and inhibits in ethanol (100 mM) induced cytotoxicity in both L-02 and HepG2 cells. The amount of alcohol can cause elevated production of ROS in the liver which leads to several liver related disease such as chirrhosis, fibrosis, steatohepatitis and possible to develop hepatocarcinoma [45]. Alcohol exposed elevated ROS generation in the hepatic cells alters the mitochondrion membrane potential that leads to apoptotic cell death [46]. In this study, PCA prevents the ethanol exposed ROS generation, mitochondrion membrane alteration and hepatic nuclear fragmentation in both human L-02 and HepG2 cells. Generally, phenolic drugs play an essential role in the regeneration of normal liver cells, which is accelerating the healing process of several liver associated disorders [47]. Also, there are several previous reports documented that plant derived phytonutrients protect alcohol exposed hepatocytes [48–50]. The liver is considered as metabolically active organ, which is vulnerable to the generation of ROS and toxic radicals that results in cell detoxification and oxidative stress [51]. There is a wide range of safeguarding antioxidants that have been involved in scavenges ROS and toxic radicals, which rapidly destroyed the toxic radicals [52]. In this study, significant elevation of lipid peroxides such as TBARS and CD; both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were observed in ethanol exposed rats tissue. This ethanol mediated elevation of lipid peroxides and depletion of antioxidants could lead to oxidative stress and alters the liver metabolisms. Numerous reports also documented that the ethanol can cause oxidative damage by enhancing lipid products and depletion of antioxidants in the liver [51,53]. Previously, resveratrol, a natural polyphenol inhibits ethanol exposed oxidative stress by inhibiting lipid markers and depletion of antioxidants in rat liver [50,54]. As like us, we found that the PCA restores ethanol mediated depletion of both anti-oxidants markers in liver tissue. Overproduction of ROS and depletion of antioxidants during the exposure of ethanol leads to oxidative stress by activating and phosphorylation of MAPK family associated proteins such as JNK, ERK and p38 [55]. In our current study, we found that PCA administration was inhibited the ethanol induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in rat liver tissue. When examining our antioxidants markers data with MAPKs signaling, PCA is the effective remedy in alcohol induced oxidative stress. Accumulation of lipids and ROS mediated depletion of antioxidants play a pivotal role in the development of alcohol mediated hepatic liver damage [43]. Scientific evidence has been shown in Nrf2 activation and it involvement enhances the safeguard antioxidants thereby prevents alcohol mediated oxidative stress in the liver [51]. Hence, activation of Nrf2 signaling has been thought as a probable therapeutic target for alcohol induced liver disease. Previous studies have been documented that livers of Nrf2-null experimental mice were more vulnerable to several stress mediated pathologies than other wild-type mice [56]. Natural phytonutrients are more capable to induce Nrf2 signaling by binding with Keap1 via covalent linkages, lead to the initiation of detoxifying enzymes to protecting cells against toxic radicals and stress [57,58]. Surprisingly, in this study; PCA was boosted the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in ethanol exposed rat liver tissues. Moreover, PCA activated the Nrf2 expression and thereby suppressed the ethanol induced CYP2E1 expression in rat liver tissue. Previously, lucidone and curcumin the strongest antioxidants inhibit chronic ethanol-mediated liver injury by suppression of oxidative stress through MAPKs and Nrf2 in experimental models [59,60]. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) are oxidative stress markers that have three distinct types such as JNK, ERK, and p38. The overexpression or phosphorylation of these markers involved in oxidative stress. The previous reports are accounting that MAPKs regulation is diminished by the overexpression of Nrf2 proteins and antioxidants [61]. There was a cause of oxidative stress by the overexpression of MAPKs related proteins in ethanol exposed rat liver tissue. But it has been suppressed by overexpression of Nrf2 in PCA treated rat. Thus, PCA has the strongest phenolic antioxidants that enhance Nrf2 thereby prevents MAPKs phosphorylation in the rat liver tissue. The most common hepatic injury was initially estimated by serum biochemical markers and histochemical analysis. Serum AST, ALT, ALP GGT, and LDH are the most important biochemical markers to assess the liver function [62]. These markers normally expressed in the liver cells and maintain liver metabolisms. However, uncontrolled over-expression of these markers could cause hepatic damage and or apoptosis [63]. In the present study, exposure of ethanol to rats was aggravated liver damage as observed by elevation in the serum AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and LDH levels that could state that severe hepatic injury was matching with previous reports [64]. Histological studies also confirmed the higher amount of microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis was found in the ethanol exposed rat liver tissue section. However, the treatment of PCA could attenuate liver marker expression and liver histological changes in rat liver tissues. Xie et al., 2014 reported that Ananas comosus L. leaf phenols and p-coumaric acid maintains fat liver metabolism by modulating the expression of PPAR-α and CPT-1 expression in HepG2 cells [65]. In our results seems to protect ethanol induced liver injury. The cell suicidal pathway or programmed cell death is called apoptosis, tightly regulated by Bcl-2 family members, Bax, and caspases [66]. In this experiment, induction of ethanol noticeably enhanced apoptosis by the diminished expression of Bcl-2 thereby stimulates the proapoptotic genes such as Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in the hepatocytes. The liver cell apoptosis has been recognized as an important feature of hepatic cell that characterized by the collapse of Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, the extent activation of several caspases completed the apoptosis process [67]. Here we observed PCA protected the ethanol induced Bcl-2 expression thereby diminishes the several proapoptotic gene expressions in the rat liver tissues. Similarly in a report, Quercetin has been shown to protect normal hepatocytes in ethanol induced stress and apoptosis and it may be used as a natural therapy for the alcoholic liver disease [68]."
26,Conclusion,"Thus, we concluded that PCA has strongest antioxidants and it protects ethanol induced hepatic damage in both L-02 and HepG2 cells. In addition, PCA inhibits ROS, lipid peroxidation and depletion of antioxidants in ethanol exposed rat liver tissue. Moreover, PCA attenuates ethanol induced oxidative stress, phosphorylation of MAPKs related proteins and apoptosis, which regulated by PCA mediated overexpression of Nrf2 in rat liver tissue. PCA also regulates liver regulating biomarkers. Hence, PCA can be considered a potent Nrf2 regulator and alternative therapeutics for alcohol related disease."
