0,Introduction,"Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) has received extraordinary attention owing to its outstanding physical and chemical properties [1-6]. nZVI has tiny particle size, large specific surface area, significant catalytic activity, and high reaction rate [4]. Moreover, nZVI exhibits a excellent magnetic property, which is favorable for facile separation and rapid recovery from the suspension with an external magnetic field [2,4]. Thus, nZVI has been widely used in water treatment, including the degradation of organic containments, the removal of heavy metal ions, and the removal of inorganic anions [1-6]. Over the past few years, heterogeneous Fenton-like processes using nZVI have been developed for degrading effectively organic contaminants [7-20]. Wang et al. [11] found that chlorpheniramine (10 mg/L) was almost completely degraded after 45 min with an H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mmol/L in the presence of nZVI (22.4 mg/L) at pH 3 and 25 °C. Zha et al. [16] revealed that the degradation efficiency of amoxicillin (50 mg/L) was about 87% at 21 min with an H2O2 concentration of 6.6 mmol/L in the presence of nZVI (500 mg/L) at pH 3 and 30 °C. As described by Eq. (1) [7,16], in acidic solutions, nZVI can be a slow-releasing source of dissolved Fe2+ [7,16], which activates H2O2 to favor the production of HO• [7,16], in accordance with Eq. (2) [7,16]. Hence, the main advantage of the nZVI/H2O2 process is the utilization of nZVI instead of common iron salts that are typically adopted in traditional Fenton processes [7]. Furthermore, Fe3+ can be recycled fast into Fe2+ over the surface of nZVI [7], consistent with Eq. (3) [7,16]. (1) F e 0 + H 2 O 2 + 2 H + → F e 2 + + 2 H 2 O (2) F e 2 + + H 2 O 2 → F e 3 + + O H − + HO • (3) 2 F e 3 + + F e 0 → 3 F e 2 + Sulfamethazine is a sulfonamide with sulfanilamide and para-amino groups [21]; it can limit the growth of most Gram-positive and many Gram-negative bacteria [22]. Sulfamethazine is extensively utilized in animal husbandry [21] for treating infectious diseases and facilitating animal growth [23-26]. However, sulfamethazine is incompletely metabolized following its uptake by animals, and up to 90% of it is released into aquatic environments through urine and feces [23-26]. Therefore, the detection frequency of sulfamethazine in aquatic environments is high and the relevant concentration of sulfamethazine in aquatic environments ranges from ng/L to μg/L [23,25,27,28]. Since sulfamethazine is resistant to biodegradation, conventional water treatment with a biological process may have a low degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine [24-26]. Therefore, efforts have recently been made to develop diverse effective H2O2-based methods to degrade sulfamethazine [21,22,25,28]. Lin and Wu [25] used the UV/H2O2 process to degrade sulfamethazine (5 mg/L) with an efficiency of 100% that was obtained in 10 min at pH 6 and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 10 mmol/L under UV-254 nm. Therefore, further investigations on the degradation of sulfamethazine using other effective H2O2-based methods still need to be done. In our earlier work [29], a rotating packed bed (RPB) with blade packings was used to mass-produce nZVI using the reductive precipitation method. This novel process was the first to be proposed for mass-producing nZVI [29]. An RPB with blade packings and the reductive precipitation method can mass-produce nZVI (RPB-nZVI) that had an mean particle size of about 45 nm [7,29] and a BET surface area of about 17 m2/g [29]. Moreover, our group used RPB-nZVI to degrade polyvinyl alcohol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide [7]. Our results revealed that the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol (20 mg/L) was 94% after 1 min with an H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mmol/L in the presence of nZVI (5 mg/L) under aeration at pH 3 and 25 °C, but the corresponding degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol using commercial nZVI from Alfa-Aesar was 1% [7]. Thus, RPB-nZVI had a very powerful activity in the nZVI/H2O2 process. Additionally, the degradation of sulfamethazine using the nZVI/H2O2 process with RPB-nZVI has not been reported upon. Accordingly, to enhance the application of RPB-nZVI, this investigation examines the performance of the nZVI/H2O2 process with RPB-nZVI in the degradation of sulfamethazine in water."

2,Mass-production of nZVI,"2.1 Mass-production of nZVI An RPB with blade packings was adopted to mass-produce nZVI using the reductive precipitation method, according to Eq. (4) [29]. The specifications and utilization of an RPB with blade packings and the method for mass-producing nZVI in an RPB with blade packings were described in our previous work [29]. nZVI was mass-produced herein using a rotational speed of 1400 rpm, flow rates of 0.6 L/min, an FeCl2⋅4H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar) concentration of 0.1 mol/L, and an NaBH4 (98%, Alfa Aesar) concentration of 0.2 mol/L. A TEM (JEOL, JEM-1200 EXII) was used to obtain the mean particle size and particle size distribution of nZVI. (4) F e 2 + + 2 BH 4 − + 6 H 2 O → F e 0 ↓ + 2 B ( OH ) 3 + 7 H 2 ↑ An XRD (Bruker, D2 PHASER) was used to analyze the crystalline structure of the mass-produced nZVI. Fig. 1 indicates that the main peaks of the mass-produced nZVI were consistent with the characteristic peaks in the standard XRD pattern of Fe (JCPDS 87–0722), revealing that the mass-produced nZVI comprised crystalline Fe. Moreover, this result confirms that nZVI can be mass-produced in the RPB with blade packings using the reductive precipitation method."
3,Degradation of sulfamethazine,"2.2 Degradation of sulfamethazine According to previous studies [21,22,25], 10–50 mg/L of sulfamethazine is reasonable to be used for elucidating the effectiveness of different H2O2-based methods in the degradation of sulfamethazine in water. Additionally, the concentration of sulfamethazine in the wastewater may be 10–50 mg/L. Therefore, initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10–50 mg/L was used in this investigation. The nZVI/H2O2 process was performed to degrade sulfamethazine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a wide-mouth glass bottle, which contained 0.5 L aqueous sulfamethazine. In the degradation of sulfamethazine, the bottle was placed in a temperature-controlled water bath for keeping the temperature of the aqueous sulfamethazine at 25 °C. The pH of the aqueous sulfamethazine was adjusted using concentrated aqueous HNO3 (65%, Scharlau) or NaOH (99%, Mallinckrodt). The mass-produced nZVI at a desired dosage and H2O2 (30%, Sigma-Aldrich) at a specified concentration were added after the temperature and pH of the aqueous sulfamethazine had reached steady values. The H2O2 concentration and nZVI dosage were varied. To enhance the homogeneity of the suspension, an agitator was used in the center of the bottle. The degradation of sulfamethazine continued for 20 min. During the degradation of sulfamethazine, a pH meter (Trans Instruments, TI9000) and a DO meter (EZDO, PDO-408) were used to measure the pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), respectively. In each sampling interval, a sample with a volume of 1 mL was extracted from the suspension. Next, the sample was filtered by a 0.2 μm membrane syringe filter to remove nZVI. To stop the degradation of sulfamethazine, 1 mL methanol (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), which is a notable agent for quenching free radicals [13], was added instantly into the filtered sample. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was adopted to estimate the sulfamethazine concentration in the sample. The HPLC (Jasco) system included a Shimadzu Shim-pack VP-ODS column and a UV–Vis detector. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of acetonitrile (99.9%, J.T.Baker) and deionized water (Merck Millipore) in a ratio of 35%/65% (v/v) [25,26,30]. The mobile phase flowed at 1 mL/min [25,26,30]. The injection volume for the sample was 50 μL. Sulfamethazine concentration in the sample was measured at a wavelength of 266 nm [25,26,30] with a calibration curve that was linear with a coefficient of determination (r2) above 0.999. The degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine (E) is defined as (5) E ( % ) = C 0 − C C 0 × 100 % where C0 is the initial sulfamethazine concentration and C is the sulfamethazine concentration at time t."
4,Results and discussion,"To evaluate the effectiveness of the nZVI/H2O2 process, the degradation of sulfamethazine by different processes was performed: (1) H2O2, (2) nZVI, and (3) nZVI/H2O2. These experiments were conducted at pH 3 and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L. An H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L was utilized in the H2O2 and nZVI/H2O2 processes. An nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L was utilized in the nZVI and nZVI/H2O2 processes. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the degradation of sulfamethazine using the H2O2 and nZVI processes was not significant. At 20 min, the E values in the H2O2 and nZVI processes were 7% and 14%, respectively. In the nZVI/H2O2 process, the E value rose noticeably in 1 min and was 99% at 5 min. A similar result was observed in the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol using the nZVI/H2O2 process [7]. The degradation efficiencies of polyvinyl alcohol (20 mg/L) using the nZVI/H2O2, nZVI, and H2O2 processes were 71%, 4%, and 2%, respectively, after 20 min at pH 3 and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 0.025 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 5 mg/L [7]. Another similar observation was found in the degradation of amoxicillin using the nZVI/H2O2 process [16]. The degradation efficiencies of amoxicillin (50 mg/L) using the nZVI/H2O2, nZVI, and H2O2 processes were 86.5%, 25.2%, and 0.2%, respectively, after 21 min at pH 3 and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 6.6 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 500 mg/L [16]. Fig. 3 indicates the results obtained when the degradation of sulfamethazine in the nZVI/H2O2 process was conducted at pH 3 with an H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L, an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L, and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L in the presence of n-butanol, which is a scavenger of HO•. After adding 1, 3, and 5 mmol/L of n-butanol (99%, Alfa Aesar), the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine decreased to 40%, 24%, and 7%, respectively, after 20 min. Compared to the result without the addition of n-butanol, the decrease in the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine was significant after adding n-butanol. Therefore, it can be concluded that HO• played a major role in the degradation of sulfamethazine using the nZVI/H2O2 process. A similar observation was found in the degradation of 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol using the nZVI/H2O2 process [20]. The degradation efficiency of 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol (0.7 mmol/L) decreased from 100% to 21% after 60 min when excess n-butanol (350 mmol/L) was added at pH 6.1 and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 3 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 500 mg/L, implying that 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol was mostly decomposed by HO• [20]. Therefore, the nZVI/H2O2 process provided the highest degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine as a result of Eq. (6). HO• was produced by activating H2O2 by Fe2+ (Eq. (2)), and it directly degraded sulfamethazine in water (Eq. (6)). Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, more degradation of sulfamethazine was obtained in the presence of both H2O2 and nZVI because more HO• was produced. (6) HO • + sulfamethazine → degradation products To investigate the dependence of the degradation of sulfamethazine on pH, the degradation of sulfamethazine was performed at pH values of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Fig. 4 indicates the results that were achieved with an H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L, an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L, and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L. At 20 min, the E values for pH 3, pH 5, pH 7, pH 9, and pH 11 were 100%, 10%, 4%, 3%, and 2%, implying that the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine exhibited the order pH 3>pH 5>pH 7>pH 9>pH 11. Lin and Hsu [7] adopted the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade polyvinyl alcohol (20 mg/L) at different pH values (3–11) and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 0.05 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 5 mg/L. Their results indicated that the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol increased as the pH was decreased, and was highest at pH 3 with 86% degradation after 20 min [7]. Li and Zhu [17] used the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade p-chloronitrobenzene (60 mg/L) at various pH values (2–11) and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 4.9 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 358 mg/L. Their results demonstrated that the degradation of p-chloronitrobenzene increased as the pH was declined, and was greatest at pH values of 2 and 3 with approximately 100% degradation within 20 min [17]. These observations were consistent with the results herein. According to Li and Zhu [17], the much lower degradation efficiency at a higher pH (especially at alkaline conditions) had the following three causes; (i) the formation of Fe2+ over the surface of nZVI was retarded under alkaline conditions [7,17], as described by Eqs. (1) and (7) [29]. Fe2+ and OH− reacted to form Fe(OH)2 over the surface of nZVI under alkaline conditions [7,17], which occupied the reactive sites thereon, reducing the degradation of sulfamethazine; (ii) a higher pH disfavored Eq. (2), reducing the amount of HO• produced [17]; (iii) the rate of self-decomposition of H2O2 (Eq. (8) [31]) under alkaline conditions exceeded that under acidic conditions, so less HO• was produced [17,31]. (7) F e 0 + O 2 + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 + F e 2 + (8) 2 H 2 O 2 → 2 H 2 O + O 2 Fig. 5 presents the degradation of sulfamethazine using the nZVI/H2O2 process with various H2O2 concentrations at pH 3 with an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L. As presented in Fig. 5, the E values that were achieved with H2O2 concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/L were 34%, 49%, 64%, 58%, and 42%, respectively, at 1 min. The corresponding E values were 75%, 99%, 100%, 99%, and 89%, respectively, at 20 min. This behavior reveals that the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine increased with the H2O2 concentration from 0.1 to 1 mmol/L mostly owing to more production of HO• Eq. (2)). However, the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine fell as the H2O2 concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mmol/L, suggesting that excess H2O2 limited the degradation of sulfamethazine. According to Eqs. (9) and ((10) [7], excess HO• can react with H2O2 to form HO2• and O2•−, whose reactivities with sulfamethazine may be lower than that of HO•, causing less degradation of sulfamethazine. Therefore, the optimal H2O2 concentration for degrading sulfamethazine in this investigation was 1 mmol/L. (9) H 2 O 2 + HO • → H O 2 • + H 2 O (10) H 2 O 2 + HO • → O 2 • − + H + + H 2 O Zhang et al. [9] adopted the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade norfloxacin (100 mg/L) at different H2O2 concentrations (5–80 mmol/L), pH 3, and 25 °C with an nZVI dosage of 100 mg/L. Their results demonstrated that the degradation efficiency of norfloxacin increased from 15% to 90% after 10 min as the H2O2 concentration was increased from 5 to 20 mmol/L, but the degradation efficiency of norfloxacin after 10 min decreased and was less than 90% at the H2O2 concentrations of 40 and 80 mmol/L [9]. Thus, the optimal H2O2 concentration for degrading norfloxacin was 20 mmol/L [9]. Wang et al. [11] used the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade chlorpheniramine (10 mg/L) at various H2O2 concentrations (0.01–0.2 mmol/L), pH 3, and 25 °C with an nZVI dosage of 22.4 mg/L. Their results proposed that the degradation efficiency of chlorpheniramine for H2O2 concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mmol/L were about 22%, 43%, 100%, and 90%, respectively, after 60 min [11]. Hence, the optimal H2O2 concentration for degrading chlorpheniramine was 0.1 mmol/L [11]. These findings were consistent with the results herein. Fig. 6 shows how nZVI dosage affected on the degradation of sulfamethazine using the nZVI/H2O2 process at pH 3 with an H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L. As shown in Fig. 6, the E values that were achieved with nZVI dosages of 5.6, 11.2, 28, 56, and 280 mg/L were 21%, 32%, 64%, 78%, and 92%, respectively, at 1 min. The corresponding E values were 71%, 97%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, at 20 min. Wang et al. [10] adopted the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade N-nitrosodimethylamine (100 μg/L) at different nZVI dosages (5.6–112 mg/L), pH 3, and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 2 mmol/L. They presented the result that increasing the nZVI dosage from 5.6 to 112 mg/L increased the degradation rate of N-nitrosodimethylamine from 0.029 to 0.146 min−1 [10]. Li et al. [14] used the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade 2,4-dichlorophenol (100 mg/L) at different nZVI dosages (500–2000 mg/L), pH 3, and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 10 mmol/L. They obtained the result that increasing the nZVI dosage from 500 to 2000 mg/L enhanced the degradation efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenol from about 76% to 89% after 180 min [14]. These results were consistent with those herein. Increasing the dosage nZVI favored the formation of Fe2+ in water, and therefore considerably accelerated the decomposition of H2O2 and, subsequently, produced more HO• [14]. In this investigation, neither the scavenging effect of HO• by an undesirable reaction, according to Eq. (11) [7], nor the agglomeration of nZVI detectably inhibited the degradation of sulfamethazine. Since complete degradation of sulfamethazine was obtained at nZVI dosages of 28, 56, and 280 mg/L at 20 min, an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L was chosen to minimize the amount of nZVI used. (11) F e 2 + + HO • → F e 3 + + O H − Wang et al. [11] adopted the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade chlorpheniramine (10 mg/L) at different nZVI dosages (11.2–28 mg/L), pH 3, and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. Their results indicated that the degradation efficiency of chlorpheniramine increased from about 62% to 100% after 60 min as the nZVI dosage was increased from 11.2 to 22.4 mg/L, but it decreased to about 90% after 60 min as the nZVI dosage was increased to 28 mg/L [11]. Zha et al. [16] used the nZVI/H2O2 process to degrade amoxicillin (50 mg/L) at various nZVI dosages (200–2000 mg/L), pH 3, and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 6.6 mmol/L. Their results revealed that the degradation efficiency of amoxicillin increased from about 71% to 87% after 21 min as the nZVI dosage was increased from 200 to 500 mg/L, but it decreased to about 78% after 21 min as the nZVI dosage was increased to 2000 mg/L [16]. However, in this investigation, the inhibition of degradation of sulfamethazine owing to excess nZVI was not observed in the present range of nZVI dosage. Because the undesirable reactions for the scavenging of HO• (Eq. (11)) didn't occur and the mixing was enough for eliminating the agglomeration of nZVI, the inhibitive effect of excess nZVI was not found in the degradation of sulfamethazine using the nZVI/H2O2 process. Determining the effect of initial sulfamethazine concentration on the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine is essential. Fig. 7 plots the effect of initial sulfamethazine concentration on the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine at pH 3 with an H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L. As plotted in Fig. 7, the E values at initial sulfamethazine concentrations of 10, 20, and 50 mg/L were 64%, 37%, and 16%, respectively, at 1 min. The corresponding E values were 99%, 84%, and 65%, respectively, at 5 min. Obviously, the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine declined as the initial sulfamethazine concentration was increased. Wang et al. [11] found that increasing the initial chlorpheniramine concentration from 5 to 30 mg/L decreased the degradation of chlorpheniramine using the nZVI/H2O2 process at pH 3 and 25 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 0.1 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 22.4 mg/L. They posited that the adsorption characteristics of chlorpheniramine affected the formation of HO•, which further affected its degradation [11]. Xu and Wang [20] asserted that the degradation of 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol using the nZVI/H2O2 process at pH 6.1 and 30 °C with an H2O2 concentration of 3 mmol/L and an nZVI dosage of 500 mg/L was affected by its initial concentration. The degradation of 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol decreased as its initial concentration was increased from 0.35 to 1.05 mmol/L [20]. They claimed that more molecules of 4‑chloro-3-methyl phenol were adsorbed onto the surface of nZVI, occupying more reactive sites, so less Fe2+ could be produced to activate H2O2; therefore, less HO• was produced over the surface of nZVI [20]. However, despite the fact that the adsorption characteristics of sulfamethazine affected its degradation, the amounts of H2O2 and nZVI were not enough to degrade sulfamethazine as the sulfamethazine concentration in water was increased. To compare the reactivity of nZVI that had been mass-produced using the reductive precipitation method in an RPB with blade packings (RPB-nZVI) with that of commercial nZVI from Sigma-Aldrich (SA-nZVI) in the nZVI/H2O2 process, sulfamethazine was degraded at pH 3 with an H2O2 concentration of 1 mmol/L, an nZVI dosage of 28 mg/L, and an initial sulfamethazine concentration of 10 mg/L. As indicated in Fig. 8 , at 5 min, the degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine using RPB-nZVI was 99%, which was much higher than that (4%) using SA-nZVI. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), in the degradation of sulfamethazine using RPB-nZVI, the DO declined to its lowest value of 5.4 mg/L at 4 min, before increasing to 6.3 mg/L at 20 min. However, as shown in Fig. 9(a), in the degradation of sulfamethazine using SA-nZVI, DO was almost unchanged. RPB-nZVI consumed more DO than did SA-nZVI and so produced more Fe2+, consistent with Eq. (7). Therefore, more HO• was produced, in accordance with Eq. (2), facilitating the degradation of sulfamethazine. As indicated in Fig. 9(b), when RPB-nZVI was used, the pH increased to 3.20 at 20 min, but when SA-nZVI was used, it remained 3.02. These findings confirm that more production of HO• was obtained using RPB-nZVI, in accordance with Eq. (2). Fig. 10 displays TEM images of RPB-nZVI and SA-nZVI. According to TEM images, the mean particle size of nZVI was calculated by analytic software. As displayed in Fig. 10(a), the mean particle size of RPB-nZVI was about 47 nm and the particle size distribution of RPB-nZVI was considerably narrow. However, as displayed in Fig. 10(b), the mean particle size of SA-nZVI was about 68 nm, and the particle size distribution (32–143 nm) of SA-nZVI was wider than that (29–69 nm) of RPB-nZVI. The size of iron particles in the nZVI/H2O2 process is critical: smaller iron particles are more reactive, as stated by Zhou et al. [13]. RPB-nZVI exhibited much greater reactivity in the nZVI/H2O2 process due to its larger surface area, in which more reactive sites were emerged. An ICP-OES analyzer (Varian, 710-ES) was used to determine the concentration of iron ions in the degradation of sulfamethazine. Fig. 11 demonstrates that the concentrations of iron ions in the degradation of sulfamethazine using RPB-nZVI and SA-nZVI were 19.2 mg/L and 0.3 mg/L, respectively, at 20 min. Hence, owing to its more reactive sites, RPB-nZVI consumed more DO and then released much more Fe2+, consistent with Eq. (7), and so produced much more HO•, in accordance with Eq. (2), leading to a much higher degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine, as shown in Fig. 8."
