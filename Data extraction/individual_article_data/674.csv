0,Introduction,"Energy demand is heavily dependent on the population and economic growth. In addition, more attention are being given to the environmental protection. Due to the double threats of energy concerns and environmental crisis, developing clean and renewable energy source becomes urgent. In consideration of low-carbon and environmental friendliness, biological hydrogen generation is considered as one of the most promising methods. Among the biohydrogen production methods, dark fermentation is more widely studied for low energy consumption, high hydrogen generation rate, and easier operation with ready-made facilities for biomethane production [1–4]. To enhance the environmental sustainability as well as reduce the operation cost, a wide range of biomass and wastes have been explored as substrates. Like the energy crops (sorghum, sugarcane etc.), forestry and agricultural residuals (stalks, straws) and various wastes [5–8]. However, energy crops were concerned for the land competition with food crops, while application of biomass and wastes rich in lignocellulose was heavily restricted by the difficult hydrolysis. Nowadays, algae biomass was brought forward as the third-generation feedstock [9]. It is rich in polysaccharides, amino acids and various vitamins. It requires no cultivable land and free in lignin. Furthermore, algae can grow very fast by fixing CO2. As a promising energy feedstock, algae has been extensively used in producing biodiesel [10]. With the continuous decline of petroleum price, and evolving markets for biogas as automotive fuel, applying algae in dark fermentative hydrogen production owns more economic and environmental benefits [11]. Nowadays, application of algae as substrate in dark fermentation is still at its infancy, both algae hydrolysis and energy conversion efficiencies are too low to meet the practical requirement [12]. Organic matters and nutrients in intact algae cells can hardly be used efficiently, hydrolysis of high polymers limits the rate of whole fermentation reaction. Thus, disruption of algae cells and decreasing the degree of polymerization are essential in converting algae biomass to bioenergy. Studies have found that appropriate pretreatment can significantly improve the energy recovery efficiency from algae biomass [13]. Jung et al. enhanced hydrogen yield by 0.6 times from macroalgae with heat treatment [14], and the hydrogen production was further increased to 159.6 mL/g TS with optimized heat-acid pretreatment [15]. Jeong et al. obtained hydrogen yield of 102.7 mL/g TS from electric treated mixed algae biomass, which was 1.7-fold compared with control test [16]. Liu and Wang found that heat, acid, alkaline and ultrasonication pretreatment all led to a better hydrogen production than control test, achieved 66.68 mL/g TS [17]. However, hydrogen production and energy recovery obtained in different studies varied a lot. Great differences are due to the different algae species, treatment methods and conditions adopted in different studies. Thus, it is hard to conclude the most suitable pretreatment method in enhancing the energy recovery from algae biomass. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of different pretreatment methods on macroalgae biomass hydrolysis, and their subsequent effect on bioenergy and biomaterials generation. Macroalgae Saccharina japonica was used as substrate, biohydrogen, organic hydrolysate and metabolites were targeted as gas and liquid products. Pretreatment methods explored include heat, acid, base, heat-acid and heat-base pretreatment. Dark fermentation fed with pretreated algal biomass was conducted to achieve a couple generation of both bioenergy and biomaterials."
1,Material and methods,
2,Macroalgal biomass,"2.1 Macroalgal biomass Macroalgae biomass Saccharina japonica was used as substrate for anaerobic fermentation. Purchased S. japonica biomass was washed by fresh water to remove the sand, salt as well as mannitol adhered on the surface. Then, S. japonica biomass was dried at 80 °C for 24 h, milled and sifted by an 18-mesh screen. Powders of biomass were sealed and kept at 4 °C until being used. Moisture was 80.01% of wet macroalgae, volatile solids (VS) was 82.81 ± 1.42% of total solids (TS), total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) were 998 ± 18 mg/g TS and 267 ± 5.30 mg/g TS. Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen were 5.5 ± 0.03%, 40.1 ± 0.29%, 2.5 ± 0.02%, and 45.6 ± 0.20% of VS, respectively."
3,Pre-treatments,"2.2 Pre-treatments Different pretreatment methods were adopted to disrupt S. japonica cells, releasing organic matters, and turning complex molecules to smaller ones. Pretreatment was conducted in 500 mL flasks, S. japonica powders were mixed with distilled water, making TS = 30 g/L. The adopted pretreatment methods and corresponding treatment conditions were referred to Ref. [13]. To make a comparison of different pretreatment methods, processing time of all treatment methods in this study were normalized to 30 min. Details of the treatment conditions are displayed in Table 1 ."
4,Dark fermentation,"2.3 Dark fermentation Digested sludge from sewage wastewater treatment plant was gathered. Before inoculation, it was treated by 5 kGy ionizing irradiation to inactivate the hydrogen consumers, and pre-cultured for 24 h to enrich hydrogen producers. Details of inoculum preparation are given in Ref. [18]. 150 mL Erlenmeyer flasks were used as reactors for dark fermentation, with 80 mL treated macroalgae (equal to 2.4 g TS), 10 mL nutrient solution and 10 mL inoculum. For the control test, 2.4 g macroalgae powder was used as substrate, besides 20 mL nutrient solution and inoculum, distilled water was added to make the total volume to 100 mL. Components of pre-culture medium and nutrient solution were as depicted in Ref. [19]. All the tests were set in duplicate."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Characteristics of macroalgae biomass were analyzed by standard method [20]. Elements contents were measured by an elemental analyzer (Exeter Analytical CE 440, UK). Organic matters in liquid phase were measured before filtering the samples through 0.45 μm membranes. Polysaccharides and protein were analyzed by phenol-sulfuric acid [21] and modified Lowry method [22], respectively. Sugars, acids and alcohols were determined by a HPLC. Biogas volume was measured by Mariotte’s water displacement method, composition of hydrogen was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC). Detailed information of HPLC and GC is same as ref. [23]. Modified Gompertz model was applied describing the change of cumulative hydrogen production (CHP). Hydrogen yield (HY) was defined as the CHP from each gram of TSadded. Dehydrogenase activity was determined according to the method given in Ref. [24], it was expressed as the amount of triphenyl formazan (TPF) (mg) came from each gram of VSS. Energy conversion efficiency refers to the ratio of energy present in products to the energy in added macroalgae biomass. All the energy values used in this study were determined from the standard combustion enthalpy. Energy values of the products are as follows: hydrogen 286 kJ/mol, glucose 2804 kJ/mol, xylose 2339 kJ/mol, arabinose 2338.8 kJ/mol, glycerol 1682 kJ/mol, acetic acid 874 kJ/mol, butyric acid 2184 kJ/mol, propionic acid 1527 kJ/mol, lactate 1362 kJ/mol, citrate 1972 kJ/mol. Energy value of macroalgae biomass was determined by the modified Dulong formula (Eq. (1)) [25], and the energy value of macroalgae biomass Saccharina japonica was determined to be 13.288 kJ/g VS. (1) Energy value ( kJ/g VS ) = 0.337 C+1 .419 ( H − 0 .125O ) + 0.02326 N The energy conversion efficiency (%) was defined as the ratio of the total heating value in hydrogen (kJ) and soluble metabolic products (kJ) to the total heating value of the added substrates (kJ). Calculations were conducted based on the quantities and the higher heating values."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Solubilization of organic matters from S. japonica,"3.1 Solubilization of organic matters from S. japonica Since biological reactions are faster in liquid phase than solid phase, macroalgae S. japonica was pretreated to solubilize the organic matters restrained in algal cells. Five different pretreatment methods including heat, acid, heat-acid, base, heat-base were adopted to explore their effects on the solubilization of S. japonica. Fig. 1 shows the characteristics of differently pretreated macroalgae biomass. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, except for the acid pretreated group, concentrations of SCOD in pretreated groups were all higher than control test, indicating these pretreatment methods were helpful in disrupting macroalgal cells and releasing the organic matters. SCOD concentration obtained from combined pretreatment methods were significantly higher than single pretreatment. Indicating the combination of different pretreatment methods obtained the synergistic effects in breaking macroalgae cells. During the heat pretreatment, chemical bonds were disrupted at high temperature, especially for the cell wall and membrane, thus resulting in the solubilization of cell components. As to the acid and base pretreatment, change of pH can change the electric charge on the cell membrane, led to the cell death and disruption [26]. During the combined pretreatment process, different working mechanisms worked together, led to the disruption of different polymers and releasement of more various kinds of organics. Both highest concentrations of SCOD and polysaccharides were obtained from heat-acid pretreatment, which were 22.7 g/L and 7.9 g/L, respectively. Followed by 22.6 g/L SCOD obtained from heat-base pretreatment and 4.3 g/L polysaccharides obtained from heat pretreatment. The content of polysaccharides in heat-base pretreated group was lower than single base pretreated group, while the content of protein presented an opposite trend. This may because polysaccharides are more easily decomposed than protein, conditions suitable for proteins dissolution and accumulation may result in the degradation of polysaccharides. Highest concentration of 3.8 g/L protein was achieved from heat-base pretreatment, followed by 2.6 g/L obtained from heat-acid pretreatment. Indicating combined methods are more preferable for protein releasement. Fig. 1B establishes the concentration of reducing sugars and volatile fatty acids (VFA) after different pretreatment. For the heat pretreated test group, the result was consistent with Fig. 1A, concentrations of reducing sugars including glucose and xylose showed little change, indicating that single heat treatment can hardly result in the hydrolysis of high polymers like cellulose or hemicellulose. Glycerol and VFA were formed in all the other test groups, VFA was mainly composed of acetic acid and lactic acid. Which means pretreatment with acid or base can induce the hydrolysis of triglyceride [27]. Heat-base pretreated groups showed the highest glycerol and VFA concentration of 669.8 mg/L and 991.2 mg/L, indicating that alkaline conditions were more preferable for the degradation of triglyceride. Significant increase of xylose and arabinose were detected in only heat-acid and heat-base pretreated groups, which were the hydrolysates of hemicellulose. Indicating the hydrolysis of hemicellulose can only be achieved with acid or base pretreatment at high temperatures. Highest concentrations of xylose and arabinose were obtained in heat-acid treated group with 1645.2 mg/L and 1003.7 mg/L, respectively. Since hemicellulose is always bound with pectin to cellulose, forming cross-linked fibers. Significant higher xylose and arabinose concentration in heat-acid treated group than heat-base treated group may because acidic environment was more preferable for decomposing the structures of cross-linked fibers, thus contributed to the further hydrolysis of hemicellulose."
8,Effect of pretreatment on hydrogen generation,"3.2 Effect of pretreatment on hydrogen generation To explore the effects of the studied pretreatment methods on hydrogen generation, mixtures of pretreated macroalgae biomass were used as substrate for dark fermentation. Fig. 2 depicts the change of CHP and hydrogen production rate (HPR) along with fermentation time. Generation of hydrogen all terminated in 10 h, and heat-base pretreated group showed the highest CHP and HPR, followed by heat-acid pretreated group. Based on the change of CHP along with time in Fig. 2A, kinetic analysis was conducted by modified Gompertz model, the obtained hydrogen production potential (P), maximum hydrogen production rate (Rm) and lag time (λ) were demonstrated in Table 2 . Heat-base pretreated group obtained the highest P, Rm and shortest λ. As shown in Fig. 1B, heat-base pretreated group has the highest concentration of glucose and high variety of reducing sugars present in liquid phase. Quick degradation of glucose at the startup phase contributed to a short λ, and simultaneous utilization of various sugars by mixed cultures contributed to a significant high HPR of 90 mL/L/h at the beginning of the fermentation process (Fig. 2B). Although the carbon sources in heat-base treated group were various, their concentrations were all lower than 800 mg/L, resulted in a continuous decrease of HPR in following 8 h. By contrast, heat-acid pretreated group showed lower P, Rm and longer λ compared with heat-base pretreatment. This may because little glucose was present in heat-acid pretreated group. Nevertheless, highest xylose and arabinose concentration was obtained in heat-acid pretreated group, resulted in a stable HPR of 60 mL/L/h in first 6 h. Besides heat-base pretreated group, pretreated groups all showed longer λ than control test, indicating these pretreatment methods caused restrictions to the hydrogen production process. The restrictions may come from two aspects. On the one hand, too serious pretreatment conditions can result in the decomposition of organic matters, especially for the easier degradable molecules (polysaccharides). If the decomposition effect of the pretreatment exceeds the dissolution effect, less hydrogen production can be obtained comparing with untreated control test. On the other hand, inhibition may come from the side effect of pretreatment. For example, during the pretreatment, some polysaccharides may be decomposed, forming volatile fatty acids, which may restrict the hydrogen production process. For the heat pretreatment at high temperatures, Maillard reaction may happen, converting sugars and proteins to non-degradable polymers. Our previous study adopted low-pressure wet oxidation treating waste activated sludge for hydrogen production, formation of inhibitory polymers was observed, which affected the hydrogen production efficiency [28]. As to the test groups added with acid or alkali, to neutralize the system, quite amount of NaCl was formed. Na+ is a kind of micronutrient for microbial metabolism, and it may influence the fermentation process by affecting osmotic pressure on microbial cell membranes [29]. Formation of Fdred in cells can be stimulated by Na+, which is favorable for the generation of hydrogen molecules [30]. However, high Na+ concentration can cause toxic inhibition, leading to fatty acids formation other than hydrogen [31]. The most significant inhibition was observed in base pretreated group, although CHP was slightly enhanced compared with control test, it showed the lowest Rm and longest λ. Indicating base pretreatment alone was not efficient in releasing organics to promote the hydrogen production, but demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect. Thus, it is crucial to choose proper pretreatment conditions to achieve the best solubilization of biomass, accumulate the biodegradable organic maters to the maximum degree, and minimize the side effect of various pretreatment methods. During the dark fermentation, hydrogen molecules are formed through the reduction of protons, while protons were generated through the redox reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenase [32]. Thus, dehydrogenase activity was considered as an indicator displaying the activity of the hydrogen production system. Fig. 3 A shows the dehydrogenase activity of differently pretreated groups. Dehydrogenase activity in all pretreated groups were all higher than control test, indicating all the test pretreatment methods have positive effect on microbial activity in the fermentation systems. Heat-base pretreated group obtained the highest dehydrogenase activity of 13.1 μg/g-TS/d, followed by 12.1 μg/g-TS/d achieved from heat-acid pretreated macroalgae. High microbial activity in these two groups may due to the rich organic nutrients present in substrate. Fig. 3B depicts the correlation between dehydrogenase activity and hydrogen yield. Hydrogen yield was positively correlated with dehydrogenase activity. Mohan and Badu [33] also found that dehydrogenase activity as consistent with CHP and HPR. Sundara et al. [34] enhanced hydrogen yield from glucose by overexpressing the dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli. Mathematical fitting shows that both linear and exponential fitting can describe the relationship between hydrogen yield and dehydrogenase activity (R2 = 0.995). Differently, Yang and Wang [23] revealed an exact exponential increase of hydrogen yield with dehydrogenase activity (R2 = 0.999), which may because of the different substrate adopted."
9,Change of organic matters during fermentation,"3.3 Change of organic matters during fermentation During the dark fermentation, the mixture used for substrate contained both pretreated biomass in solid phase and solubilized organic nutrients. Fig. 4 shows the change of organic matters in liquid phase after the hydrogen production. For the control test, little change of SCOD and protein was observed (Fig. 4AB), while polysaccharides concentration was slightly increased (Fig. 4C). Indicating the fermentation process induced the hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass, and this process mainly disintegrated glucose-based polymers, like cellulose and laminarin (Fig. 4D). Similar phenomenon was also observed in heat pretreated group, while more polysaccharides degradation was obtained. Indicating the heat pretreatment enhanced the polysaccharides degradation during the fermentation. As to acid or base pretreated groups, concentrations of SCOD, protein and polysaccharides all demonstrated a significant increase. This may due to the hydrolysis of macroalgal biomass by the extracellular enzymes or microbial metabolism present in the system, and the hydrolysis effect was more significant than degradation during the fermentation [35]. More polysaccharides was obtained than protein from the microbial hydrolysis, indicating sugar-based polymers are more biodegradable than protein-based tissues. In heat-acid pretreated group, organic matters all showed a significant decrease, which means efficient solubilization was achieved during the pretreatment in this group, and degradation of organics was dominant during fermentation. Fig. 4D shows that glycerol, xylose and arabinose all decreased after the fermentation, while glucose was significantly increased, indicating that lots of glucose-based polymers became ready for a further degradation after the pretreatment, and the microbial hydrolysis during fermentation was active in decomposing glucose-based polymers, which had no obvious influence on disintegrating hemicellulose or triglyceride. Different from heat-acid pretreated group, concentration of SCOD and protein all decreased while polysaccharides increased in heat-base pretreated group. An increase in arabinose was observed, while glycerol was decreased, and glucose was completely degraded. Indicating after the heat-base pretreatment, microbial hydrolysis of arabinose-based polymers became possible, but disintegration of glucose-based polymers was not stimulated. It worth mentioning that lots of reducing sugars remained in both heat-acid and heat-base pretreated groups, indicating soluble organic nutrients in these two groups were surplus, pretreatment was not the limiting step for hydrogen production. As mentioned before, sodium inhibition happened in acid or base pretreated groups. Thus, sodium resistant microbes may be adopted to further degrade the solubilized organic nutrients and enhance the hydrogen {{}}production. As a biological process, a series of complex metabolisms were happened during dark fermentation, generating hydrogen as well as acids. As displayed in Fig. 5 , acids detected in this study mainly included C2-C4 VFA and lactic acid. Acetic acid and butyric acid were dominant in both control and heat pretreated test, indicating these two groups went through acetate-type and butyrate-type fermentation. As more glucose was present in heat pretreated substrate (Fig. 1B), higher hydrogen yield and acetate/butyrate ratio was obtained. As to the groups pretreated with acid or alkali, a large amount of lactic acid was detected, and little butyric acid was detected. Indicating sodium inhibition was happened in these groups. Kim et al. reported that with an increase of Na+ from 0.27 g/L to 12 g/L, butyrate-type hydrogen production was inhibited, while lactate production became dominant (65.6%) [31]. In this study, 8.6 g/L Na+ was formed with the addition of HCl and NaOH, and produced lactic acid accounted for 50.7–58.7% of the total organic acids. Otherwise, acetate-type fermentation was not inhibited by high Na+, and these groups were all achieved better hydrogen production than control test. Furthermore, inhibitory effect of high Na+ can be relieved by acclimating inoculum or long-term operation. Thus, pretreatment methods with acid or alkali are promising in enhancing hydrogen production from macroalgal biomass."
10,Energy conversion efficiency,"3.4 Energy conversion efficiency After the fermentation process, concentrations of various sugars and VFA were determined. Based on the standard combustion enthalpy of various products and their concentration present in the liquid phase, energy values of each product in each test group were determined. Energy conversion efficiency (ECE) was calculated based on the energy present in products to added substrate (macroalgae). As mentioned before, formation of VFAs and releasement of various organic nutrients are accompanied with hydrogen generation during fermentation. Organics present in liquid phase can be further applied in many fields, like extracting valuable chemicals, being used as additional carbon source for wastewater treatment and so on. Thus, the total ECE was defined as the sum of ECE of hydrogen and detected organics in liquid phase. Fig. 6 shows the ECE of each product in differently pretreated test groups. Highest ECE of hydrogen was determined to be 2.03% from heat-base treated macroalgae, which was 2.7-fold of control test. Highest total ECE of 35.42% was obtained from heat-acid treated group, which was 2.9-fold of control group. Indicating heat-base treatment showed advantage in enhancing hydrogen production, while heat-acid pretreatment was more efficient in enhancing total energy recovery from macroalgae. According to the latest technology review concerning algae bioenergy from International Energy Agency Bioenergy, macroalgae cultivated for bioenergy could achieve a yield of 5–30 tonnes/ha/yr [36]. Taking highest total energy recovery of 4.7 kJ/g VS obtained from heat-acid treated group in this study, the total energy recovery potential can achieve 3.9–23.2 GJ/ha/yr. However, it worth mentioning that over 60% of energy in substrate were undetected or remained in macroalgae biomass in solid phase, and over 30% of energy remained in liquid phase. To further enhance the ECE in gas phase, two stage dark-photo fermentative hydrogen production or fermentative hydrogen-methane production can be conducted. For example, Zhang et al. [37] increased hydrogen yield by 1.4 times with an additional photo fermentation system converting effluent from dark fermentation system to hydrogen. Ding et al. [38] enhanced ECE from mixed algae biomass from 4.6 to 6.6% for hydrogen to 57.0–70.9% for hydrogen and methane. To improve the total ECE, the solubilization and hydrolysis still need to be further developed. From the perspective of pretreatment process, mechanical pretreatment can be adopted ahead of the thermal or chemical treatment, stimulating the pretreatment efficiency by disrupting the physical structures in advance. For example, studies found that by applying ultrasonication before heat-shock, acid/alkaline or advanced oxidation, the releasement of cellulose or hemicellulose from lignocellulosic biomass can be significantly enhanced [39]. Besides, during the fermentation process, enzymes can be applied to promote the hydrolysis process, such as cellulase and hemicellulose. Besides the energy benefits, cultivation of algae also owns great environmental benefits. Algae can help to improve water quality by adsorbing heavy metals [40] or fixing pollutants [41]. Besides, macroalgae plays an important role in marine ecosystem by stabilizing inorganic nutrients and bottom sediments [42]. Furthermore, wide cultivation and fast growth of algae biomass can make a great contribution to CO2 fixation. Thus, developing algae biomass based energy recovery system has good prospects for acquiring great value in both energy and environment field."
11,Conclusions,"Different pretreatment methods were adopted to enhance the bioenergy recovery from macroalgae Saccharina japonica. All the studied pretreatment methods showed enhancement in macroalgae solubilization and hydrogen generation, while combined pretreatment showed significant advantage over the others. Highest CHP was achieved from heat-base pretreated group, while heat-acid pretreated group obtained the highest ECE. Considering the sodium inhibition observed in acid or base pretreated groups, dark fermentation process can be further enhanced by inoculating high Na+ resistant microbes or microbial acclimation."
