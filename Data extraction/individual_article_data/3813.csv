0,Introduction,"With continual increase in energy demands, gradual depletion of fossil fuels reserves (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) and hence rises of oil price and stringent environmental legislations stimulated intense research on exploration of energy from renewable feedstock. Hydrogen, derived from renewable feedstock, is an attractive alternative and cleaner energy source and can be used in hydrogen based fuel cells for electrical power generation to meet future global energy needs. In addition, hydrogen is an important feedstock in chemical industry; for example, production of ammonia, fertilizers, and liquid fuels via the Fischer–Tropsch process. Over last few decades, biomass has been gaining importance as a source of renewable fuel and hydrogen. Several ways of producing synthesis gas from biomass have therefore been investigated like gasification and fast pyrolysis followed by SR. The technology of gasification by air, however, suffers from the drawback of low heating value (4–6MJ/m3) of resulting synthesis gas with 8–14 volume% hydrogen content only [1]. This makes it unsuitable for its direct use as fuel, chemical feedstock or in fuel cell. Although the second route has potential to produce synthesis gas with improved heating value and hydrogen contents; the economics however favors the use of hydrocarbons (natural gas, C2–C5, and naphtha) and inexpensive coal as feedstock. On the other hand, the vegetable oils are another promising renewable feedstock for fuel because of ready availability, ease of transportation, low sulfur and aromatic content, and higher heat content (about 88% of diesel fuel) [2]. However, the direct use of such vegetable oils in engines has been found to be unsatisfactory because of their high viscosity, reactivity due to unsaturated molecules, and low ignition quality that leads to coking on injectors and plugged orifices [3,4]. The methyl/ethyl esters of fatty acids present in such oils have proved to be promising enough as diesel called bio-diesel. The significant research effort has been made in the past two decades on trans-esterification of vegetable oils with methanol/ethanol in presence of NaOH/KOH to produce bio-diesel suitable for blending with petroleum based diesel and a few commercial plants have already been installed and are in operation throughout the world. The vegetable oils are also promising feedstock to produce synthesis gas because of its low oxygen content and high potential yields of hydrogen [5]. The technology of steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation, and the combination of SR and partial oxidation commonly known as autothermal steam reforming (ATSR) [6–10] have been regarded as the efficient processes for the production of synthesis gas. The SR is an endothermic reaction and the large amount of heat is to be supplied from outside. The partial oxidation on the other hand is an exothermic reaction and can lead to deactivation of catalysts due to the formation of a hot spot. The ATSR, where partial oxidation acts as an internal heat source to the endothermic SR, has been attracted a lot of research interests in recent times because of the improvement in reactor temperature control, reduction of hot spots, and avoiding catalyst deactivation [11,12]. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is an important tool to obtain equilibrium products composition and identify thermodynamically favorable operating window of the process. In the past, extensive studies on thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of SR and ATSR of methane [13–17], methanol [18–21], ethanol [21–28], propane [29–31], dimethyl ether [32], coke-oven gas [33], glycerol [21,34–41], butanol [21,42,43], bio-diesel [44], various components of bio-oil [45,46], and diesel [47] have been published. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of dry reforming of various oxygenated compounds such as ethanol, butanol, glycerol and hydrocarbons such as propane was also reported in open literatures [48–51]. However, the thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of any form of reforming of vegetable oils was not attempted in the past because of its complex chemical composition and unavailability of thermo-physical properties. The present work was therefore undertaken to explore the thermodynamic understanding of SR and ATSR of vegetable oils."
1,Methodology,"The vegetable oils (triglycerides) are fatty acids ester of glycerol. The three fatty acids groups present in a triglyceride molecules may be same or different and are expected to be distributed statistically in triglyceride molecules present in vegetable oils depending upon the fatty acids composition of the vegetable oil. Therefore, the vegetable oils are a complex mixture of wide range of chemical compounds. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of such a complex mixture is therefore very difficult because of unknown chemical composition and unavailability of physical and chemical properties of the triglycerides present in the vegetable oils. In the present thermodynamic equilibrium analysis, the vegetable oils are considered as a mixture of triglycerides consisting of three same fatty acid groups in their backbone for simplicity of analysis. The aliphatic hydrocarbon backbone of fatty acids present in the vegetable oils generally vary from 8 to 24 carbon atoms with majority of 16 and 18 carbon atoms (Table 1 ). As observed from the table, the palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid are the major fatty acids constituents of most of the vegetable oils. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider the vegetable oils as a mixture of tripalmitin, tristearin, trioleate, and trilinolein. However, in the present investigation, the vegetable oils are considered as a mixture of tripalmitin, tristearin, and trioleate only because of unavailability of physical properties of trilinolein. The tristearin, tripalmitin, and trioleate are however non-databank compounds of Aspen Plus. The chemical structure, molecular weight, normal boiling point, standard enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy of formation of these compounds required for regression of property method were obtained from different literatures as shown in Table 2 . However, the standard enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of tripalmitin are not available in literature and calculated using Aspen Plus as shown in Table 2 [52]. The temperature dependent properties such as heat capacity and vapor pressures of these compounds required for regression of property method were also taken from open literatures [53,54]. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was performed using R-Gibbs reactor with UNIF-LBY as property method. The property method, UNIF-LBY was first regressed using available physical and chemical properties of the considered triglycerides. The regressed property method was then used to calculate the equilibrium products composition based on minimization of total Gibbs free energy of the system. The thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of SR by minimization of Gibbs free energy was reported in detail by various groups [19,28,30,34,40,41,43,51,55]. The total Gibbs free energy (Gt ) of a system consisting of N number of chemical species is given as follows: (1) G t = ∑ i = 1 N n i μ i = ∑ i = 1 N n i G i 0 + R T ∑ i = 1 N n i ln f i f i 0 where ni is number of moles of species i, μi is chemical potential of species i, f i is fugacity of species i. The superscript ‘0’ denotes a standard thermodynamic quantity. At low pressure and high temperature, the system can be considered as ideal. For reaction equilibria in gas phase, f i = φ i y i P and f i 0 = P 0 and since G i 0 is set equal to zero for each chemical elements in its standard state, Δ G 0 = Δ G f i 0 for each components is assumed. The minimum Gibbs free energy of each gaseous species and that of the total system can be expressed by Eqs.(2) and (3) respectively with the Lagrange’s undetermined multiplier method. (2) Δ G f i 0 + R T l n φ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k = 0 (3) ∑ i = 1 N n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T l n φ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) = 0 with the constraints of elemental balances: (4) ∑ i = 1 N n i a i k = A k where Δ G f i 0 is standard Gibbs free energy of formation of species i, P0 is standard-state pressure of 101.3 kPa, yi is gas phase mole fraction, ϕi is fugacity coefficient of species i, λk is Lagrange multiplier, aik is the number of atoms of the kth element present in each molecule of species i, and Ak is total mass of kth element in the feed. When solid carbon (graphite) is involved in the system, the vapor–solid phase equilibrium is applied to the Gibbs free energy of carbon as given by Eq.(5). Substituting Eq.(1) by Eq.(2) for gaseous species and by Eq.(5) for solid species gives the minimization function of Gibbs free energy as given by Eq.(6): (5) G ¯ c ( g ) = G ¯ c ( s ) = G c ( s ) = Δ G f c ( s ) 0 = 0 (6) ∑ i = 1 N − 1 n i ( Δ G f i 0 + R T l n φ i y i P P 0 + ∑ k λ k a i k ) + ( n c Δ G f c ( s ) 0 ) = 0 where G ¯ c ( g ) , G ¯ c ( s ) , G c ( s ) , Δ G f c ( s ) 0 , and nc are the partial molar Gibbs free energy of gaseous carbon, that of solid carbon, molar Gibbs free energy of solid carbon, standard Gibbs free energy of formation of solid carbon, and mole of carbon respectively. The equilibrium calculations employing the method of Gibbs free energy minimization were done using Aspen Plus®, Aspen Tech™."
2,Results and discussions,"In the present thermodynamic equilibrium analysis, the vegetable oil was considered as mixture of tripalmitin (30 mol %), tristearin (25 mol %), and trioleate (45 mol %) with an average molecular composition of the mixture as C55.2H103.7O6. The key chemical reactions involved of SR and ATSR based on the average molecular composition are represented by the Scheme 1 . The reported heat of reaction of SR (Eqs.(i) and (iii) of Scheme 1 and Eqs.(i) and (ii) of Scheme 2 ) and partial oxidation (Eq.(v) of Scheme 1) of vegetable oil was calculated using Aspen Plus [52]. The most of the previous groups presented the results of thermodynamic equilibrium analysis in terms of products composition. However, a rational definition of the progress variables of SR and ATSR is desirable one and essential for complex and high molecular weight compounds like vegetable oils. The generalized definition of progress variables of vegetable oils reforming, hydrogen yield, selectivity of CO and methane, used throughout the present article are therefore defined as follows. (7) Hydrogen yield , % = 100 × ( moles of H 2 formed moles of vegetable oil reacted ) / ( moles of H 2 formed moles of vegetable oil reacted ) s t o i c h i o m e t r i c = moles of H 2 formed 156.25 × ( moles of vegetable oil reacted ) × 100 (8) Selectivity of CO , % = ( moles of CO formed ) ( moles of CO 2 + CO + CH 4 formed ) × 100 (9) Selectivity of CH 4 , % = ( moles of CH 4 formed ) ( moles of CO 2 + CO + CH 4 formed ) × 100 The two process variables of reforming of vegetable oils, steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR) and oxygen-to-carbon ratio (OCR), are defined as follows. (10) Steam - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of steam moles of vegetable oil ) / ( moles of steam moles of vegetable oil ) s t o i c h i o m e t r i c = ( moles of steam ) 104.4 × ( moles of vegetable oil ) (11) Oxygen - to - carbon ratio = ( moles of oxygen moles of vegetable oil ) / ( moles of oxygen moles of vegetable oil ) s t o i c h i o m e t r i c = ( moles of oxygen ) 24.6 × ( moles of vegetable oil ) The stoichiometric hydrogen yield and SCR used in the definition of Eq.(7) and Eq.(10) respectively are defined based on the Eq.(iii) of Scheme 1 and the stoichiometric OCR of the Eq.(11) are defined based on the Eq.(v) of Scheme 1."
3,Equilibrium products composition,"3.1 Equilibrium products composition In the present study, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrocarbons and various alcohols of up to seven carbon atoms, and coke (graphite forms) were considered as possible products in SR and ATSR. The compositions of the products formed in both form of reforming are shown in Table 3 . As observed from the table, the mole fraction of compounds containing two or more carbon atoms and coke formed under equilibrium were very small and decreased with increasing SCR. Marquevich et al. [5] also reported the formation of only a trace amount of C2 and C2 + compound for the SR of sunflower oil using a hydrotalcite type of nickel catalyst. Therefore, further thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was performed considering CO, CO2, H2, and methane as only products."
4,Effect of pressure,"3.2 Effect of pressure From the stoichiometry of SR reactions (Eqs.(i) and (iii) of Scheme 1), it is expected that there might be a significant effect of pressure on equilibrium products distribution. However, the simulation study revealed that effect of pressure on SR and ATSR of vegetable oil is negligible unless there is a significant change in pressure. Moreover, the elevated pressure has negative influence on the yield of hydrogen and hence the SR processes are usually operated close to atmospheric pressure in the temperature range between 773 K and 1173 K. Therefore, all subsequent simulation experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure."
5,Steam reforming,"3.3 Steam reforming Effect of triglyceride compositions. The fatty acid compositions of vegetable oils generally vary depending on type and source. The effect of triglyceride composition was therefore studied to understand the behavior of SR of different vegetable oils. The complete equilibrium conversion of vegetable oils were observed under the range of temperatures and SCRs studied. The effect of triglyceride compositions on hydrogen yield at different SCR and temperature was studied at three different mole fractions of tripalmitin, tristearin, and trioleate, 0.15/0.15/0.7, 0.3/0.25/0.45, and 0.7/0.2/0.1 with an average molecular composition of the mixtures as C56.1H104O6, C55.2H103.7O6, and C52.8H101O6 respectively as shown in Fig. 1 . The overall SR reaction based on average molecular compositions of these triglyceride mixtures are represented by Eq.(i) of Scheme 2, and Eq.(iii) of Scheme 1, and Eq.(ii) of Scheme 2 respectively. The stoichiometric hydrogen yield and SCR require to define the hydrogen yield of Eq.(7) and SCR of Eq.(10) for the triglyceride mixtures were obtained from the respective overall SR reaction. The hydrogen yield was found to increase with increasing SCR for fixed feed composition as observed from the figure. The variation of hydrogen yield with triglyceride composition is due to the fact that the potential yield of hydrogen for the mixtures decreases in the order of C56.1H104O6, C55.2H103.7O6, and C52.8H101O6 as observed from Eq.(iii) of Scheme 1 and Eqs.(i) and (ii) of Scheme 2. On the other hand, the trilinolein (C57H98O6) has lesser potential yield of hydrogen compared to tristearin and trioleate as one can observe from their chemical formula (Table 2). Therefore, the increase in trilinolein concentration in vegetable oils relative to tristearin and trioleate is expected to decrease the hydrogen yield. However, the trilinolein has higher potential yield of hydrogen than tripalmitin and hence increase in mole fraction of trilinolein relative to tripalmitin will increase the hydrogen yield. All subsequent studies were performed using the mixture of tripalmitin (30 mol %), tristearin (25 mol %), and trioleate (45 mol %). Hydrogen yield. The effect of SCR and temperature on hydrogen yield are shown in Fig. 2 . The hydrogen yield was found to increase with increasing SCR at a fixed temperature as observed from the Fig. 2a. With increase in SCR, the number of moles of water in reactant side of Eqs.(i-iii) of Scheme 1 increases and hence the equilibrium of SR and water gas shift reaction (WGSR) shifts towards the products side resulting in increased hydrogen yield. The increase of SCR also promotes the reverse methanation reaction of Eq.(iv) of Scheme 1 resulting in further increase in hydrogen yield. The effect of temperature on hydrogen yield is shown in Fig. 2b. The hydrogen yield was found to increase with increase in temperature, reaches a maxima, and then decreases a little as observed from the figure. This is because of the fact that SR reaction is endothermic one and equilibrium shifts towards products side with increasing temperature resulting in increased hydrogen yield. WGSR and methanation reactions on the other hand are exothermic in nature and equilibrium shifts towards reactant side with increasing temperature. At lower temperatures, the methanation reaction is dominating one resulting in low hydrogen yield. The reverse methanation reaction increases with increase in temperature resulting in increase in hydrogen yield. However, at sufficiently high temperature the concentration of methane becomes very small (Fig. 4 ) and reverse WGSR dominates over reverse methanation reaction resulting in decrease in hydrogen yield with further increase in temperature. The similar trends of hydrogen yield with temperature were also observed experimentally for the SR of sunflower oil over a commercial nickel-based catalyst [3]. Selectivity of CO. The effects of SCR and temperature on selectivity of CO are shown in Fig. 3. The CO selectivity was found to decrease slightly with increasing SCR because of increase in WGSR with SCR as observed from the Fig. 3a. At low temperature, the CO selectivity was found to be quite low and the selectivity was found to increase with increase in temperature as observed from the Fig. 3b. This is because of the fact that the low temperature favors exothermic WGSR and methanation reactions leading to low CO selectivity. The reverse methanation reaction and reverse WGSR favors with increase in temperature resulting in increase in CO selectivity. Selectivity of methane. The effect of SCR and temperature on selectivity of methane are shown in Fig. 4. The selectivity of methane was found to be very high at low temperature and decreased with increase in temperature as observed from the figures. This is because of the fact that the methanation is an exothermic reaction and favors at low temperature. The selectivity of methane was also found to decrease with increase in SCR. It was further observed from the Fig. 4a that the change in selectivity of methane with SCR was very sharp at higher temperatures. This is because of the fact that methane reforming is an endothermic reaction and favors with increase in SCR and temperature."
6,Optimum conditions for steam reforming,"3.4 Optimum conditions for steam reforming The production of high purity hydrogen gas with low proportions of methane and CO from SR is desirable one for its application as chemical feedstock, fuel or in fuel cell for electrical power generation. As observed qualitatively from the Figs. 2–4, the hydrogen yield increases with increase in the SCR and temperature. The selectivity of methane decreases with increasing temperature and SCR. It is also observed from the figures that the increase in SCR and decrease in temperature resulted in decreases of CO selectivity. On the other hand, the high SCR for SR is desirable to prevent coke formation on the surface of the catalyst. The energy requirement of the process will however increase by use of excessively high amount of steam and hence operation at optimum SCR and temperature is very much important to improve the economics of the process. The maximum hydrogen yield was observed in the temperature range of 875–925 K depending upon SCR. In order to operate the steam reformer at temperature of maximum hydrogen yield, the SCR of above 5 is required to maintain very low methane selectivity. Therefore, the optimum operation window of SR of vegetable oils is 875–925 K and SCR of 5–6. The SR of vegetable oils can also be operated at SCR in the range of 2–3 to reduce the heat duty and hence improve the economics of the overall process. The use of SCR lower than optimum value will however force the operation at temperature somewhat above the maximum hydrogen yield (950–1000 K) to minimize the selectivity of methane (Figs. 2b and 4b)."
7,Auto-thermal steam reforming,"3.5 Auto-thermal steam reforming The ATSR was studied for various OCRs to understand the effect of OCR on hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane as shown in Fig. 5 . The trend of results for ATSR was found to be similar to that of SR as observed from the figures. However, the hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane in ATSR were found to be less compared to SR and decreased with increasing OCRs. This is because of the fact that the increased amount of feed utilized for partial oxidation reaction (Eq.(v) of Scheme 1) with increase in OCR resulting in reduction in the hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane. As the trends of results of SR and ATSR are same, it may also be concluded that SR and ATSR proceeds independently and the optimum temperature and SCR for ATSR also remains same to that of SR."
8,Thermoneutral condition for autothermal steam reforming,"3.6 Thermoneutral condition for autothermal steam reforming The operation of ATSR at thermoneutral condition requires no external energy for cooling or heating, which makes it valuable from energy consumption point of view. The study was therefore extended to the energy balance to evaluate thermoneutral condition for ATSR of vegetable oils. Fig. 6 shows the variation of heat duty with temperature at different OCR. The analysis of heat duty was performed considering feed consisting of vegetable oils, steam, and oxygen entered into the reactor at the temperature of reactor. The intersection of heat duty curves with thermoneutral line (corresponding to zero heat duty) represents the thermoneutral temperature. It is observed that the process exothermicity increases with increase in OCR and decreases with increase in temperature. As observed from the figure, the OCR of 0.53 and 0.55 is to be used for thermoneutral operation of ATSR at 900 K and SCR of 3 and 6 respectively."
9,Conclusions,"Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of SR and ATSR of vegetable oils was studied by Gibbs free energy minimization method considering vegetable oils as a mixture of triglycerides consisting of three same fatty acid groups in their structure. The available physical and chemical properties of the considered triglycerides were used to regress the property method, UNIF-LBY. The regressed property method was then used to evaluate plausible products and to understand the effect of temperature and SCR on hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane for SR of vegetable oils. The mole fraction of compounds containing two or more carbon atoms and coke formed under equilibrium was found to be very small. The hydrogen yield was found to increase with increase in SCR and temperature. It was observed that the selectivity of methane decreased with increasing temperature and SCR. The increase in SCR and decrease in temperature resulted decrease in selectivity of CO. The optimum condition of SR of vegetable oils for maximum yield of hydrogen with very low selectivity of methane was determined to be about 875–925 K and SCR of 5–6. The hydrogen yield and selectivity of CO and methane in ATSR of vegetable oils was observed to be less compared to SR although the trends of results were similar to that of SR. The study was further extended to determine the thermoneutral conditions for various operating conditions."
