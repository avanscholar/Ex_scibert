0,Introduction,"Palm oil is one of the most important commercial oils used widely for industrial purposes. In south-eastern Asian countries, large-scale plantations for oil palm trees (Elaeis guineensis) were developed during the last century. These trees can be harvested throughout the year, but they must be replanted every 20–25 years for maintaining harvest efficiency of palm oil. The estimated replanted area of the oil palm plantation in Malaysia and Indonesia amounted to 4.5 billion square meters to 5.6 billion square meters per year and approximately 142 oil palm trees are usually planted in one hectare (Kosugi et al., 2010; Murata et al., 2013). Large amounts of the felled palm trunk have high potential as an important biomass resource. However, they are not suitable for use as lumber because of their low strength (Kosugi et al., 2010). The physical properties of oil palm vary throughout the trunk due to their nonuniform structures (Srivaro, Matan, & Lam, 2018). Therefore, many efforts to find new applications for oil palm trunk have been reported; these include plywood manufacturing (Hoong & Paridah, 2013; Sulaiman, Hashim, Wahab, Samsi, & Mohamed, 2008) and ethanol or lactic acid production using sugars in sap (Kosugi et al., 2010; Murata et al., 2013; Yamada et al., 2010). Recently, the production of cellulose nanoﬁbers (CNFs) and their application in composite materials have gained signiﬁcant interest due to their high Young’s modulus, high strength, low coeﬃcient of thermal expansion, low weight, biodegradability, and renewability (Prakash Menon, Selvakumar, Suresh kumar, & Ramakrishna, 2017; Siró & Plackett, 2010). The production of CNFs from oil palm residues is of great interest for the eﬀ ;ective utilization (Fahma, Iwamoto, Hori, Iwata, & Takemura, 2010; Jonoobi, Khazaeian, Tahir, Azry, & Oksman, 2011; Solikhin, Hadi, Massijaya, & Nikmatin, 2019). Our previous study revealed that CNFs could be produced from all parts of the oil palm: mesocarp, empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), and trunk. The morphology and mechanical properties of the CNF sheets obtained from the trunk had advantages over CNF sheets from other wastes (Okahisa et al., 2018). A high reinforcement effect can be achieved when CNFs produced from oil palm trunk are used as nanofillers. Among a variety of polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was studied herein because of its water solubility, semi-crystallinity, nontoxicity, transparency, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. PVA is expected to be applied to the biomedical and optoelectrical fields (El-Bashir, Yahia, Binhussain, & AlSalhi, 2017; Paradossi, Cavalieri, Chiessi, Spagnoli, & Cowman, 2003). In many cases, however, reinforcement with some nanofillers including CNFs is required due to the low mechanical properties of PVA (Han et al., 2017; Liu, Sun, Tian, Maiti, & Ma, 2013; Qua, Hornsby, Sharma, Lyons, & McCall, 2009; Wang, Qiao, & Sun, 2018; Wu et al., 2019; Xiao, Gao, Gao, & Li, 2016). The hydrophilicity of PVA leads to interfacial compatibility with CNFs, resulting in improved mechanical properties and thermal stability. Many researchers have studied the production of nanocomposites using PVA and CNFs from various biomass materials including oil palm residues such as EFB (Fahma, Hori, Iwata, & Takemura, 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). However, no study has reported on nanocomposites using PVA and CNFs isolated from oil palm trunk. Moreover, solution casting has been employed as a fabrication method using PVA solution and CNF suspension. The well dispersed CNFs in PVA solution result in hydrogen bonding between CNFs and PVA, thereby improving the tensile strength and Young’s modulus, but not the strain. Therefore, existing PVA/CNF nanocomposites are brittle and not ductile. Originally, CNF sheets have high tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and strain. This is because microﬁbrillation enhances the tensile strength when the ﬁlm is dried owing to the stronger hydrogen bonding on the large surface areas of the microﬁbrils (Taniguchi & Okamura, 1998). Further, the CNF networks have been shown to suppress crack propagation in the brittle matrix resin when the bacteria cellulose sheets were impregnated into neat acrylic resins, resulting in composites that could be bent without damage (Nogi & Yano, 2008). In this study, CNF sheets derived from oil palm trunk were impregnated to PVA in solution, resulting in ductile nanocomposites. The mechanical properties of the PVA/CNF nanocomposites were examined and compared to the casting method at different concentrations of the CNF sheets. X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine the microstructure of the nanocomposites. The impregnating method could add a new dimension for the application of PVA/CNF nanocomposites based on waste materials, oil palm trunk and lead to the resolution of environmental problems."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Oil palm trunk (Elaeis guineensis) grown in Thailand were ground into a fine powder using a mortar and dried under reduced pressure at ambient temperature. The CNF suspension was obtained by a grinding treatment after the purification of oil palm trunk with organic solvent (toluene/methanol) extraction, bleached with an acidiﬁed sodium chlorite, and alkaline extraction according to literature (Okahisa et al., 2018). The average diameter of CNFs measured by atomic force microscopy was 40 nm. PVA powder (DP = 1500–1800) and other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan."
3,Preparation of PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"2.2 Preparation of PVA/CNF nanocomposites The process for preparing the PVA/CNF nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 1 . In the impregnating method, CNF sheets obtained by ﬁltration and drying were submerged in a PVA solution. In the casting method, the CNF suspension and PVA solution were mixed together and stirred to form PVA/CNF nanocomposites. To obtain different concentrations of CNFs in the nanocomposites, CNF sheets with various densities were prepared by different drying methods (Nogi, Iwamoto, Nakagaito, & Yano, 2009; Park, Yook, Goo, Im, & Youn, 2020). First, wet CNF sheets were prepared by filtrating 0.5 % CNF suspension. Then, densely packed CNF sheets having a low void ratio and a density of 1.1 g/cm3 were obtained by press drying under vacuum conditions. CNF sheets having a moderate void ratio and a density of 0.8 g/cm3 were obtained by immersing wet CNF sheets in an ethanol solvent for more than 12 h and then press drying under vacuum conditions. Finally, CNF sheets having a high void ratio and a density of 0.2 g/cm3 were obtained by immersing wet CNF sheets in ethanol for more than 12 h, followed by immersion in a tert-butyl alcohol solvent for more than 12 h and freeze drying. Nanocomposites with 70 wt%, 50 wt%, and 30 wt% of CNFs were prepared by impregnating low, middle, and high-void-ratio CNF sheets with 10 wt% PVA solution (Impreg-70, Impreg-50, Impreg-30) and drying at 30 °C. The thickness of Impreg-70, Impreg-50, and Impreg-30 were 134, 142, and 128 μm. Nanocomposites of the same ratios were prepared using the casting method by blending the CNF suspension and PVA solution and casting into films at 30 °C (Cast-70, Cast-50, Cast-30). The thicknesses of Cast-70, Cast-50, and Cast-30 were 167, 172, and 168 μm."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization Nanocomposites fabricated by the impregnating and casting methods were analyzed using attenuated total reﬂection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy (Spectrum One, PerkinElmer, Inc., USA) ATR-FTIR spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to investigate the cross-sectional morphology of nanocomposite films with S-3400 N SEM (Hitachi High-Tech Science Co., Japan) at 10 kV after coating with platinum using an ion sputter coater. X-ray diﬀ ;raction (XRD) patterns of the nanocomposites were recorded by Geigerflex (Rigaku Co., Japan). The imaging plate was chosen as a detector. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on DSC-60APlus (Shimaszu Co, Japan) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from ambient temperature to 300 °C. Thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative TG (DTG) analyses were conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (STA7200 RV, Hitachi High-Tech Science Co., Tokyo, Japan) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from ambient temperature to 600 °C after initial heating at 110 °C for 20 min to dehydrate the samples. The analyses were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere with a 60 mL/min ﬂow rate. The tensile moduli of the nanocomposites were evaluated using a universal material testing machine (EZSX, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) for dumbbell-shaped specimens (ISO 527-2:2012, model 5B) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The average values and standard deviations of the Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and strain at break were evaluated using ﬁve independent specimens. The specimens were completely dried in vacuum at 40 °C for over 12 h before use, and the tensile tests were conducted at 23 °C and 33 % relative humidity."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Fourier transform infrared spectra of PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"3.1 Fourier transform infrared spectra of PVA/CNF nanocomposites The FTIR spectra of neat PVA, CNFs, and the nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 2 . The absorption peak of 1420, 1321, 1081, 919, and 838 cm−1 in neat PVA film were attributed to CH bending, CH bending, CO stretching, −CH 2 bending, and −CH rocking, respectively (Liu et al., 2013; Qua et al., 2009). The CNF sheet shows peaks at 1020 and 895 cm−1 associated with CO stretching vibration and anomeric carbon of β-d-glucopyranosyl of cellulose (Liu et al., 2013). The peak absorptions for Impreg-70 and Impreg-50 were similar to that of neat PVA; this signifies the existence of the PVA layer in the outer surface of the nanocomposites because ATR was used. In ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, infrared light is reflected in internal reflection elements (i.e. a crystal). The interaction between the sample and infrared light is made possible by the presence of a standing wave, termed evanescent wave, inside which a disturbance beyond the internal reflection element surface is created (Gaigneaux & Goormaghtigh, 2013). The depth of penetration (dp ) of the evanescent wave is given by the well-known Eq. (1), where λis the wavelength, nc is the refractive index of crystal, ns is the refractive index of the sample, and θ is the angle of incidence (Götz, Nikzad-Langerodi, Staedler, Bellaire, & Saukel, 2020). (1) d p = λ 2 π n c sin 2 θ - n s n c 2 Thus, the spectra obtained by ATR-FTIR analysis show the information only from the surface of the samples, at a few micrometers of depth. In this study, KRS-5 crystal (nc = 2.4) was used as the internal reflection element. The dp at 1000 cm−1 is 2.01 μm with θ = 45° and ns = 1.5. It was suggested that the sandwich construction (i.e., the CNF layer nested between PVA layers) was formed by Impreg-70 and Impreg-50. However, the peak band around 1081 and 1020 cm−1 attributed to CO stretching vibration in PVA and CNFs in Impreg-30 was different from those of Impreg-50 and Impreg-70, suggesting the sandwich construction was not formed in Impreg-30. On the other hand, the intensity ratio of the band peak at 1020 cm−1 to 1081 cm−1 increased with the ratio of CNFs in the nanocomposites fabricated by the casting method. This indicated the existence of both CNF and PVA at the surface of the samples and suggested the expected interaction of hydroxyl groups of PVA with the hydrophilic surfaces of the CNFs (Liu et al., 2013)."
7,Morphology of PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"3.2 Morphology of PVA/CNF nanocomposites SEM micrographs for the cross section of nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 3 . Impreg-50 and 70 had a trilaminar structure. Laminated white areas were clearly observed in the center (Fig. 3c, e; black arrows) and black clayish areas were observed at the surface of Impreg-50 and Impreg-70 (Fig. 3c, e; white arrows). The black area at the surface of the samples was considered PVA because FTIR analysis indicated the existence of PVA on the surface of Impreg-50 and 70 (Fig. 2). A sandwich construction centered on CNF layers could be formed by the impregnation method. The trilaminar structure was not observed in the center of Impreg-30, which corresponded with the results of the FTIR analysis. The PVA could penetrate the CNF layers in Impreg-30 because it was fabricated by the impregnation of the low density, freeze-dried CNF sheet into the PVA solution. In contrast, no flat and smooth PVA layers (Fig. 3h) or aggregates were observed in Cast-30, 50, and 70. These results indicate that the CNFs in Cast-30, 50, and 70 were well dispersed in the nanocomposites, thus agreeing with the results of FTIR analysis."
8,Crystallinity of PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"3.3 Crystallinity of PVA/CNF nanocomposites XRD patterns of neat PVA film, CNF sheet, and PVA/CNF nanocomposites are compared in Fig. 4 . The neat PVA film showed a single scattering peak at 2θ = 19.4° attributed to the orthorhombic lattice structure of semi-crystalline PVA (Krumova, López, Benavente, Mijangos, & Pereña, 2000). The peaks for the CNF sheets belonged to cellulose I, which is a typical natural plant cellulose. The main peak at 2θ = 22.5° was assigned to the (200) diﬀ ;raction plane of cellulose I (Nobuta et al., 2016). There is a relative decrease in the intensity of the peak at 2θ = 19.4° and increase at 2θ = 22.5° associated with the increase of CNF concentration in nanocomposites fabricated by both impregnating and casting methods. The crystallinity of the nanocomposites fabricated by the casting method increased with the increase in CNF content as previously reported (Liu et al., 2013). Moreover, the crystallinity of the nanocomposites fabricated by impregnation showed the same tendency as that of the nanocomposites fabricated by casting. To clarify the difference in the relative degree of crystallization of the PVA in nanocomposites based on the fabrication method, the relative areas of PVA and CNFs were calculated after peak separating. The calculated areas of Impreg-30, Cast-30, Impreg-50, Cast-50, Impreg-70, and Cast-70 were 1.41, 1.37, 1.07, 1.10, 0.88, and 0.76, respectively. No differences were observed in the relative degree of crystallization of PVA between the fabrication methods."
9,Thermal behavior of the PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"3.4 Thermal behavior of the PVA/CNF nanocomposites DSC thermograms of PVA and PVA/CNF nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 5 . A melting temperature (T m) of neat PVA appeared at 223 °C, as previously reported (Han et al., 2017). With the addition of CNFs, the T m and the apparent crystallinity (apparent Xc) of nanocomposites were decreased due to the decrease in the volume fraction of PVA as expected by previous report (Abdel Bary & Harmal, 2019). While the T m of the nanocomposites fabricated by the impregnating method were higher than the casting method (Table 1 ). When adding a small amount of microfibrillated cellulose, less than 5 wt%, the PVA crystallinity increased (Lu, Wang, & Drzal, 2008) because the amount of PVA contained in the nanocomposite was simply lower, thus decreasing the apparent crystallinity. When corrected for the CNF content, the real crystallinity of PVA increases. This suggests that CNFs behave like a crystal nucleating agent, indicating a very large number of strong interactions between PVA and CNFs. However, the T m and enthalpy (ΔH m) of nanocomposite films were was also reported to decrease when adding more than 2 wt% CNFs (Asad et al., 2018). It is possible that the CNFs were sufficiently dispersed in the PVA solution by the casting method to prevent the alignment of the PVA chains, thereby decreasing the crystal size of PVA and lowering T m. On the other hand, the small interfacial region between PVA and CNFs in the nanocomposite produced by the impregnation method is considered to not significantly disturb the ordering of the PVA chain; thus, this nanocomposite has almost the same T m as that of PVA alone as this interface does. Typical TG and DTG curves of the neat PVA, nanocomposites, and CNF sheets are shown in Fig. 6 . The weight loss at 210–380 °C and 380–550 °C observed in neat PVA film originated from the decomposition of the side chain and the main chain of the PVA (Liu et al., 2013). The onset thermal degradation temperatures of nanocomposites containing 30 % CNFs remained the same as those of the neat PVA film, while those of the nanocomposites containing 50 % and 70 % CNFs increased with the addition of CNFs. No clear differences were observed between the impregnating and casting methods. Two main peaks of DTG were observed at 240–360 °C in Impreg-30 and Cast-30, which was attributed to the PVA decomposition and CNF degradation. The maximum mass loss weight of the nanocomposites shifted to a higher temperature when adding 50 wt% and 70 wt% CNFs. It has been reported that the thermal stability is enhanced at a certain PVA/CNF ratio (Lu et al., 2008; Voronova, Surov, Guseinov, Barannikov, & Zakharov, 2015; Zhang et al., 2014). It was also reported that there is no impact or decrease in the thermal stability of nanocomposites at low concentrations of CNFs (Rowe, Tajvidi, & Gardner, 2016; Srithep, Turng, Sabo, & Clemons, 2012). The nanocomposites fabricated by the casting method had higher thermal stability due to the presence of the crystal structure and thermal stability of CNFs (Liu et al., 2013). The fibril network formation from self-entanglement through hydrogen bonding might be inhibited when CNFs are present in low concentrations such as 30 % in PVA. Higher concentrations of CNFs such as 50 % and 70 % might allow fibril network formation, increasing the thermal stability (Rowe et al., 2016). In this study, it was revealed that the nanocomposites fabricated by the impregnating method also achieved higher thermal stability as well as casting method."
10,Mechanical properties of PVA/CNF nanocomposites,"3.5 Mechanical properties of PVA/CNF nanocomposites The tensile strength and modulus of neat PVA film, PVA/CNF nanocomposites, and CNF sheet are listed in Table 2 . Typical stress-strain curves of the PVA/CNF nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 7 . The tensile strength and Young’s modulus were increased by adding CNFs for both the impregnating and casting methods except for Impreg-30. Impreg-30 was fabricated by impregnating a freeze-dried CNF sheet into the PVA solution. The freeze-dried CNF sheet contains voids and infilling with PVA could be incomplete in the impregnating method. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites were higher for the casting method compared to the impregnating method. This indicated good dispersion of CNFs into the PVA matrix and adhesion between PVA and CNFs by the casting method (Fahma et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013; Zimmermann, Pöhler, & Geiger, 2004). On the other hand, the tensile strain and toughness of Impreg-50 and Impreg-70 were higher than those of Cast-50 and Cast-70, respectively. The CNF sheet achieved improved mechanical properties because of its strong hydrogen bonding and high crystallinity (Iwamoto, Nakagaito, & Yano, 2007; Okahisa et al., 2018; Taniguchi & Okamura, 1998). It was suggested that the Impreg-50 and Impreg-70, as confirmed by the FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 2, have sandwich structures with a stiff CNF sheet and good adhesion between the CNFs and PVA. The CNF networks, through the strong hydrogen bonding formed by sheet making, could inhibit crack propagation of the nanocomposites, resulting in composites that could tolerate higher strain without damage. However, in this study, the tensile test was conducted under the conditions of 23 °C, 33 % RH. It is well known that composites based on PVA and natural fibers show high water sensitivity (Chiellini, Cinelli, Imam, & Mao, 2001). The ultimate tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites decreased and the elongation increased at higher moisture content. The mechanical properties of CNF sheets are also greatly affected by humidity (Barhoum, Samyn, Öhlund, & Dufresne, 2017). For overcoming this problem, more processes such as cross-linking, grafting, and /or coating with hydrophobic substances will be needed. The expected applications of PVA/CNF nanocomposites have been expanded in packaging and/or biomedical field (Niu et al., 2018; Zheng, Cai, Ma, & Gong, 2015). These ductile PVA/CNF nanocomposites obtained by impregnation could be widely used in such industries. This should lead to the growth of this high value-added industry in south-eastern Asian and major palm oil-producing countries (Dungani et al., 2013)."
11,Conclusion,"CNFs derived from oil palm trunk were incorporated into PVA by casting and impregnating methods. CNFs were dispersed well in the PVA film by the casting method. In contrast, at high concentration of CNFs, a sandwich construction with CNFs and PVA was obtained by the impregnating method. ATR-FTIR spectra indicated the formation of the sandwich construction in the PVA/CNF nanocomposite formed by impregnation. There were no obvious differences in the XRD diffraction pattern between the PVA/CNF nanocomposite films obtained by the impregnating and casting methods, suggesting that the crystallization of PVA was not affected by either method. Nevertheless, the addition of CNFs increased the crystallinity of PVA in both cases. Thermal stabilities of the nanocomposites were increased by the addition of CNFs. At 50 wt% and 70 wt% of CNFs, the nanocomposite films fabricated by the impregnating method shows higher thermal melting temperature and higher tensile strain and toughness values compared to the casting method. These ductile PVA/CNF nanocomposites could be promising materials for packaging and/or biomedical applications, suggesting a possible economical use of oil palm trunk."
