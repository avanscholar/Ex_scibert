0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as an ideal fuel for the future has received much attention because of its high-energy capacity and environmental friendliness [1]. Hydrogen fuel can be produced from clean and renewable energy sources, thus its life cycle is clean and renewable [2]. Especially, photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen as a renewable energy carrier is a possible avenue, which utilizes the two most abundant resources of solar energy and water. Since the discovery of photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972 by Honda and Fujishima [3], water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts has been widely studied as a promising and useful way to produce hydrogen [4–8]. However, the hydrogen production efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting over bare nano-sized TiO2 remains quite low, mainly due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes [9]. In order to improve the efficiency of H2-production, noble metals, such as Pt [10], Au [11] and Pd [12], were conventionally used as co-catalysts loaded onto the surface of TiO2 to promote the separation of charge carriers and transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the loaded noble metals where H2O was reduced to hydrogen molecules. However, these noble metals are very scarce and very expensive. Thus, seeking low cost and highly active non-precious metal has also been widely conducted. For example, Yu et al. [13,14] successfully fabricated highly active and non-noble metal CuO and Cu(OH)2 cluster as a co-catalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for H2-production. However, the separation of CuO–TiO2 or Cu(OH)2/TiO2 nanoparticles from water is too difficult for the large-scale practical application. Compared with TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanotubes arrays (TNAs) not only have three-dimensional tubular structure and large specific surface area, but also can be used repeatedly and conveniently [15,16]. Therefore, inspired by this, in this work, TNAs were firstly prepared by electrochemical anodic oxidation of titanium sheet, and then Cu(OH)2 particles were deposited on the TNAs through chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The obtained Cu(OH)2/TNAs, as a novel immobilized and easy separated photocatalyst, showed excellent activity and reusability for hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation and characterization of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation and characterization of photocatalysts TNAs film was firstly prepared by an electrochemical anodization method as described in our previous report [17,18]. Ti foil (99%) with thickness of 0.1 mm was immersed in 0.5% hydrofluoric acid for 10 s, and then was degreased by sonicleaning in absolute alcohol and deionized water, respectively. The anodization process was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt mesh as the cathode and a pretreated Ti foil (2 cm × 3 cm) as the anode. The electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving H2O (15 vol.%) and NH4F (1.0 wt.%) in 1,2,3-propanetriol. The anodization potential was controlled at 25 V for 2 h in 30 °C water bath. The as-synthesized TNAs film was then annealed in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in air. Cu(OH)2 particles were deposited on TNAs by CBD method. Briefly, a certain volume of 2.5 M NaOH aqueous solution was dropwise added into 50 mL 0.05 M CuSO4 under stirring until the copper ions formed insoluble Cu(OH)2 precipitation. Then ammonia (vol. 25%) was dropwise added until all Cu(OH)2 precipitation was dissolved and transformed into [Cu(NH3)4]2+ solution. The as-prepared TNAs film was soaked into the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ solution for a few seconds, and then was rinsed with deionized water and dried in air at 80 °C for 10 min. The [Cu(NH3)4]2+ solution on TNAs was decomposed into Cu(OH)2. Such process was repeated several times until the desired deposition of Cu(OH)2 was achieved. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The resulting sample was labeled as Cu(OH)2/TNAs-X (X denotes the repeated deposition time). The morphologies of the prepared samples were obtained in a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, LEO 1530VP). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (D/max-IIIA, Japan) using Cu Ka as the radiation source. The UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–Vis DRS) were carried out with a UV–vis spectrometer (U3010, Hitachi). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 Fluorescence spectrohpotometer (Hitachi, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 260 nm, the scanning speed was 1200 nm min−1, the PMT voltage was 700 V, and the widths of the excitation slit and emission slit were both 5.0 nm."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production The photocatalytic experiments for hydrogen production were performed in a 100 mL Pyrex flask at an ambient temperature. The reactor was connected to a closed-cycle circulation system. PLS-SXE300UV Xe lamp (Changtuo, Beijing), which was positioned 10 cm away from the reactor, was used as a simulated solar sources to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 4 cm2 of Cu(OH)2/TNAs film photocatalyst was immersed in 80 mL mixed solution of 0.09 M ethylene glycol and water. Prior to irradiation, nitrogen was bubbled into the reactor for 40 min to completely remove the dissolved oxygen and the reactor was in an anaerobic condition. 0.4 mL gas was intermittently sampled through the septum, and hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, with nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column)."
4,Results and discussions,"Fig. 1 A shows the average inner diameter of TNAs is ca. 100 nm. Fig. 1B–F shows the evolution of Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles deposited on TNAs under different repeated deposition times. The FESEM reveals that the amount of Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles loaded on TNAs increases with the increment of deposition times. From the cross-sectional view of the Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15 (Fig. 1E), it can be seen that the length of TNAs is ca. 900 nm and the size of Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles is ca. 40 nm. Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles were loaded into the TNAs structure, including the surface, the external and internal walls of the TNAs. These results show that the nanotubes are well-aligned and vertically oriented on the titanium substrate and the Cu(OH)2 particles were loaded into the TNAs structure. After 20 times repeated deposition, Cu(OH)2 particles congregated on TNAs severely and almost covered all the nanotube pores. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that the pure TNAs consist of a large amount of anatase and a small amount of rutile. There are four peaks at 2θ values of 16.7, 23.8, 34.1 and 35.9°, corresponding to (020), (021), (002), and (111) crystal plane of pure Cu(OH)2 [JCPDS No.12–420, Orthorrhombic, space group: Cmcm (63)], respectively. Fig. 2A also exhibits that with the increment of the deposition times, the intensities of the Cu(OH)2 characteristic peaks increase, which suggesting the increased size and amount of Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles. The characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase and rutile TiO2 were unchanged obviously, indicating that there was no significant change in phase structure and crystallite size of TiO2 during the whole precipitation. Also no evident shift in the peak positions is observed for the as-prepared Cu(OH)2/TNAs samples, suggesting that the deposited Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles did not incorporate into the lattice of TiO2, and were probably attached on the surface of TNAs. Fig. 2B shows that TNAs film has visible region absorption, which can be assigned to the scattering of light caused by pores or cracks in the nanotube arrays [19,20]. While the absorption intensities of Cu(OH)2/TNAs reduce in the range of 410–700 nm with the increase of the deposited Cu(OH)2. This can also be seen from the color change of their optical photographs (insets in Fig. 2B), in which the colors of the samples change from dark blue to light blue with the increase of deposition time, indicating that the deposition of Cu(OH)2 strongly influenced the visible light absorption of the TNAs but had slightly impact on UV light absorption. Compared with the pure TNAs, no great changes in the absorption edge of Cu(OH)2/TNAs samples are observed, which further implies that Cu(OH)2 was not incorporated into the lattice of TNAs, but only deposited on their surface. The PL emission spectra have been widely used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping and transfer, and to understand the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes in the semiconductor since the PL emission results from the recombination of free carriers [14,21]. Fig. 2C presents the PL spectra for pure TNAs and Cu(OH)2/TNAs samples with an excitation wavelength of 260 nm. The well-resolved peaks at 409, 451 and 468 nm are observed. All of these peaks are attributed to the radiative recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [14]. Obviously, the intensities of PL signals of Cu(OH)2/TNAs are much weaker than that of bare TNAs. In addition, for Cu(OH)2/TNAs, the PL peak intensities decrease with the increasing amount of the deposited Cu(OH)2. The reason is that the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 migrate to Cu(OH)2, decreasing the direct recombination of electrons and holes. Compared with TNAs, Cu(OH)2/TNAs composites have lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, expecting higher photocatalytic efficiency for hydrogen production. Photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production on various samples were evaluated under simulated solar light irradiation using ethylene glycerol as scavenging agent [14,22]. In comparison, the control experiments indicated that no appreciable hydrogen production was detected in the absence of either irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrogen was produced by photocatalytic reactions on photocatalyst. Fig. 3 A shows that TNAs have a very low photocatalytic activity because of the relatively rapid recombination of electrons and holes in pure TNAs. After loading a small amount of Cu(OH)2 nanoparticals, the photocatalytic activity of Cu(OH)2/TNAs-5 for hydrogen production is remarkably improved. The photocatalytic activity of the samples further increases with increasing the repeated deposition time from 5 to 15, but further increasing the deposition times to 20 times leads to the degradation of the photocatalytic activity. The highest hydrogen production rate is 6.5 μmol h−1 cm−2 on Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15, which is 20.3 times that of the pure TNAs (0.32 μmol h−1 cm−2). The reusability of photocatalyst is a key issue for practical application. Fig. 3B shows the reusability of Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15 for hydrogen production. After five cycles, the photocatalytic efficiency for hydrogen production decreased only 5.8%, suggesting that the Cu(OH)2/TNAs photocatalyst is stable and has good reusability. In order to explain the reason for the increased efficiency of Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15 catalyst, XPS analysis was carried out. Fig. 4 A shows the XPS spectra of Cu 2p of Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15 before and after five runs of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Fig. 4Aa shows typical Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks with the measured binding energy of 935.3 and 955.0 eV, respectively, as well as their concomitant shake-up lines at 944.1 and 963.0 eV [23]. This result shows that copper exists on the surface of TNAs in the form of oxidation state (Cu2+), which is also in good agreement with the above XRD results. Fig. 4Ab illustrates that the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p changed significantly after five runs. Two shake-up lines almost disappeared and the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks shifted to 932.7 eV and 952.6 eV, respectively, indicating the formation of metal Cu due to the reduction reaction of photogenerated electrons. This result confirms the electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to Cu(OH)2 and formation of metal Cu during the photocatalytic reaction, which is consistent with the result reported by Yu [14]. Fig. 4B schematically illustrates photocatalytic hydrogen production on Cu(OH)2/TNAs. The well-ordered structure of TNAs provides a the large surface area and good electronic conductivity, accordingly, the photo-induced electrons under UV–vis light irradiation can quickly transfer into Cu(OH)2 to produce the reduction of partial Cu(OH)2 clusters as the potential of Cu(OH)2/Cu (−0.224 V vs. SHE, pH = 0) is slightly lower than the CB level of anatase TiO2 (ca. −0.26 V) [14]. That is to say, the transferred electrons in Cu(OH)2 can cause the reduction of partial Cu2+ to Cu0 atoms to form Cu clusters at the beginning of light irradiation. These Cu clusters as a substitute for noble metals co-catalyst promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to the Cu(OH)2/Cu, and then effectively reduce protons to produce H2. Consequently, high photocatalytic hydrogen production activity is achieved over Cu(OH)2/TNAs. When X was more than 15, the size and amount of Cu(OH)2 particles markedly increased and the surface of TNAs was almost covered, resulting in the effective surface area and the UV–vis light absorption decreased and the photocatalytic activity reduced. In conclusion, Cu(OH)2 nanoparticles as effective co-catalysts have been successfully loaded onto TNAs to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TNAs for hydrogen production. The hydrogen production rate of Cu(OH)2/TNAs-15 is 20.3 times that of the pure TNAs. This work exhibits a facile method to fabricate highly active and stable photocatalyst for hydrogen production."
