0,Introduction,"Energy crisis and water pollution, resulting from the rapid increase in population growth and industrialization, are two of the greatest problems in our daily life [1–3]. Current energy demands worldwide are mostly supplied from the combustion of fossil fuels (such as natural gas, oil and coal), resulting in the depletion of limited fossil fuels reservoirs in the near future [4]. Moreover, the combustion of fossil fuels causes serious environmental pollution and global warming (the emission of greenhouse gases, mainly CO2) [1,3,5]. Hence, the use of alternative energies for fossil fuels, which should be sustainable, renewable, eco-friendly and clean, is of great urgency. Accordingly, hydrogen (H2) has been broadly suggested as an alternative fuel to overcome energy shortages and environmental pollution because of its fascinating advantages, i.e., being renewable, eco-friendly, clean, recyclable, and with high-energy density [3,6]. Presently, several technologies have been developed to produce hydrogen for direct utilization in domestic/residential consumption or for applying as fuel in different fields, such as petrochemicals, cosmetics, food processing, electronics, fuel cells, energy storage, engines/turbines, etc. [1,6,7]. However, the present technologies (i.e., fossil fuel-based and renewable-based methods) used for hydrogen production are facing great challenges to deal with global sustainable development because they might be environmentally toxic, expensive or requiring external energy [6,7]. Therefore, the development of green technologies to produce hydrogen is highly needed. Water pollution is another significant challenge in these days, since it has harmful impacts on humans, animals, plants, and even whole ecosystem all over the world [8,9]. For example, people are suffering and even dying from dangerous diseases because of water pollution [10]. Lately, emerging pollutants (EPs), non-regulated organic compounds, which are currently not subjected to any discharge limitations and with unknown adverse impacts, have been recognized as dangerous contaminants presenting in water [11–13]. The pharmaceutical compounds are one of the most serious EPs because of their unique physicochemical and biological characteristics [2,14–18]. They might decline water quality by decreasing the operating efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and thus having toxic effects on all living organisms [14,17,18]. Moreover, they could also accumulate in aquatic organisms (e.g., fishes and invertebrates) and transfer into their offspring, and thus causing transgenerational toxic effects on both parents and offspring [19]. Various pharmaceutical compounds have been continually detected (with low concentrations ranging from ng L-1 to µg L-1) in diverse environments worldwide, such as sediments, soils, biota, wastewater (treated and untreated), surface water, groundwater, and even drinking water [2,14,19]. Among them, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory diclofenac (DCF; 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino] phenyl acetic acid), usually used as its sodium salt ( Fig. 1), acts extensively as an anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic, antipyretic, potent analgesic, and antirheumatic agent, and being used for treatment of several diseases via injections or oral, ophthalmic and topical administrations [20,21]. The presence of DCF and its metabolites reduce obviously the water quality, decrease the efficiency of WWTPs, and might also cause toxicological impacts on humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms [20–22]. It has been shown that DCF has harmful impacts on human livers, kidneys and other organs even at very low concentrations, breaking DNA and causing genotoxicity [22]. To address these threats, various technologies, such as adsorption, filtration, flocculation, sedimentation, coagulation, disinfection, chemical oxidation, chlorination and microbial degradation, have been developed to remove pharmaceutical residues from water. However, these technologies are not effective from the viewpoint of cost and process efficiency. Moreover, either toxic sludge (solid waste with metabolites/byproducts) or concentrated wastewater is simultaneously created that requires further treatment [20]. Therefore, it is highly required to develop a promising and high-effective technology to remove pharmaceutical EPs from water. The semiconductor-based photocatalysis is considered as one of the most promising technologies for effective H2 generation and degradation of DCF [22–24]. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda first discovered TiO2-based photocatalysis for H2 generation under UV light irradiation [25]. Since then, great attention has been paid to preparation, property-governed activities, mechanism clarifications, activity improvements and possible applications of heterogeneous photocatalysts, especially TiO2-based materials [2,26–47]. Titanium(IV) oxide (titania, TiO2) is considered to be the most recommended photocatalyst for various applications, especially for degradation of organic pollutants, because of its simple preparation, non-toxicity, low cost, high stability and high efficiency [24,48]. Titania exists naturally in three polymorphs, i.e., thermodynamically stable rutile (R; tetragonal, P42/mnm) and metastable anatase (A; tetragonal, I41/amd), and brookite (B; orthorhombic, Pbca) [24]. It has been found that all polymorphs might exhibit good photocatalytic activity, depending on their physicochemical characteristics (i.e., crystalline properties, specific surface area, the content of surface hydroxyl groups, the density of defects, morphology, and nano-architecture), which could be highly affected by the conditions of their preparation (time, temperature, pressure, pH value, atmosphere, reagents, modifiers, complexing agents, solvents) [24,49]. The multi-phase TiO2 shows usually higher photocatalytic activity than single-phase TiO2 because of the possible transfer of photogenerated charges between different TiO2 polymorphs (with different electronic band levels), leading to effective charge carriers’ separation, and hence suppressing the electron-hole recombination [24,50–53]. Accordingly, exceptionally high photocatalytic activity of commercial P25 photocatalyst from Evonik/Degussa/Aeroxide has been explained by the co-existence of anatase and rutile, and thus either charge migration between phases hindering their recombination [54–57] or intrinsic high activity of different phases in different reactions, i.e., anatase and rutile for oxidation and reduction, respectively [58,59]. Indeed, much attention has been devoted to the synthesis of binary-phase TiO2 photocatalysts. However, the mixed-phase titania samples containing brookite (i.e., BA and BR), which in many cases have higher activity than single-phase and AR titania, have attracted less attention than AR samples, because of the difficulty of brookite synthesis [24,60]. Moreover, there are only very few reports on the preparation of mixed-phase TiO2 nanostructure with tunned ratio of brookite in the titania mixtures [24,60,61]. In addition, titanium alkoxides, TiCl4 and titanium bis(ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) have mostly been used as TiO2 precursor in the synthesis of binary-phase (BA) photocatalysts. However, TALH is neither cheap nor ecofriendly (causing a release of ammonia), and the use of both TiCl4 and titanium alkoxides is not convenient as they are very sensitive to moisture [62,63]. Therefore, the challenge remains to prepare binary-phase (BA) TiO2 photocatalyst with a tailored B/A ratio via facile one-step synthesis. Furthermore, the correlation between the structure/composition and photocatalytic activity of BA photocatalysts has not been investigated in detail yet. It should be also pointed out that the mechanism of interaction between anatase and brookite has not been clarified yet. Usually, similar to AR composites, the charge migration between polymorphs have been suggested. In this study, binary-phase (BA) TiO2 photocatalysts with different B/A ratios, have been successfully synthesized from Ti2(SO4)3 by a facile template-free hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal method has been selected because of its many advantages, such as simple operation, low cost, and environmentally friendly. Ti2(SO4)3 has been used as titania precursor because of good solubility in water (no need to use alcohol-based solution) and stability at room temperature. The B/A ratio has been easily tuned by changing the glycine concentration during the preparation of alkaline precursor solution, as already discussed in previous papers [62,64]. The obtained samples, characterized by various analytic methods [64], have been used for degradation of diclofenac and hydrogen generation to find the key factors governing the photocatalytic activity and to understand/clarify the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Titanium(III) sulfate (Ti2(SO4)3, Fisher, 15%), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Koch-light laboratories Ltd., 98%), glycine (H2N-CH2-COOH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Sigma-Aldrich, 25%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, LobaChemie, Pellets, 98%), DCF-Na (C11H15 N4O4Na, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), methanol (CH3OH, FUJIFILM, 99.5%), ethanol (C2H5OH, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), silver nitrate (AgNO3, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA-Na2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), benzoquinone (BQ, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and isopropanol (IPA, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) were used without further purification."
3,Facile hydrothermal synthesis,"2.2 Facile hydrothermal synthesis The binary-phase (BA) TiO2 photocatalysts with different B/A ratios were prepared according to the procedure described previously [64]. In brief, NaNO3 powder was suspended into Ti2(SO4)3 solution, and then subjected to a gentle stirring to obtain a colorless and transparent suspension. Then, an aqueous solution of glycine with different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 3.2 mol L-1) and NaOH (with glycine/NaOH volume ratio of 1/3) was added dropwise to the suspension, and then stirred for 30 min to complete the reaction. Finally, the milk-like suspension (75 mL) was transferred to the 100-mL Teflon-lined tube and heated at 473 K for 20 h. The as-obtained solid was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and finally dried at 333 K. The pure brookite was prepared with the same manner, but in the absence of glycine, and named as B. Additionally, the replacement of NaOH with NH4OH results in the preparation of the pure anatase TiO2 (A). The mixed samples prepared with 0.5, 1.0, and 3.2 mol L-1 glycine were named as BA1, BA2 and BA3, respectively."
4,Characterization,"2.3 Characterization The crystalline properties of titania photocatalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), carried out on Brukeraxs D8, Germany (using Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15405 nm, and a secondary monochromator). The phase contents were calculated using Zhang’s equations [65]. The average crystal sizes were estimated by Scherer’s formula [66]. The Raman spectra were recorded on a Senterra Dispersive Micro Raman, Bruker, Germany (using a doubled Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm and 10 mW) as an excitation source). The surface morphology was characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, QUANTAFEG 250, Netherlands) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-JEM-1230, Tokyo, Japan; with an acceleration voltage up to 200 kV, magnification up to 600 kX and resolution down to 0.2 nm). The elemental analysis was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis at 77 K, using Quanta Chrome Instruments, NOVA 2000 series, UK. The photoabsorption properties were characterized by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis–DRS), recorded on the UV-2501 PC, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan (with BaSO4 used as a reference). In order to separate the extent of light absorption from scattering, the diffuse reflectance mode (R) was converted into the Kubelka-Munk function (F(R)), where F(R)E1/2 = ((1-R)2/2 R x E)1/2. The F(R)E1/2 was plotted against energy (E) to determine the bandgap values [67]. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded on Shimadzu RF-5301PC to investigate the charge carriers’ separation efficiency (λex = 380 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was recorded on JASCO 3600 Tokyo, Japan to investigate the functional groups and surface characteristics. Although, sample characterization has already been published in previous papers on anatase-brookite mixed-phase titania [64], here, the summary is presented as this is important for understanding the property-governed activity and the mechanism clarification."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic activity was evaluated for two reaction systems: (1) anaerobic dehydrogenation of methanol (H2 system; H2 generation) under UV/vis irradiation, and (2) photodegradation and mineralization of DCF-Na under UV-A irradiation. As already mentioned in the Introduction, TiO2 P25 shows one of the best photocatalytic activities among various TiO2 samples in diverse photocatalytic reactions [68–70], and hence is usually used as a “standard” TiO2 sample. Accordingly, in this study, the photocatalytic performance of P25 was also analyzed, and obtained data were compared to those obtained by B, A and BA samples. For H2 generation tests, methanol and in-situ deposited platinum were used as a sacrificial reagent and a co-catalyst, respectively. In a typical experiment, 50 mg of TiO2 photocatalyst was suspended in 5 mL aqueous suspension of 50 vol% methanol in a 35-mL Pyrex test tube. After that, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (2 wt% Pt in respect to TiO2) was added to the titania suspension, followed by sonication for 10 min, and pre-bubbling with argon for 30 min in the dark to remove oxygen. Then, the test tube was sealed with a rubber septum, and the suspension was continuously stirred in a thermostated water bath (temperature ⁓ 298 K) and irradiated with UV–vis irradiation source (Hg lamp, λ > 290 nm). During the photocatalytic reaction, the amount of evolved-H2 gas was analyzed (every 15 min) using a Shimadzu GC-8A chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Porapak Q column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The photocatalytic experiments of the degradation and mineralization of DCF were carried out under UV-A irradiation. The photocatalyst was suspended in 100 mL (1 g L-1) of an aqueous suspension of 10 mg L-1 DCF-Na in a 110-mL double jacket round quartz reactor. Before illumination, the suspension was stirred for half an hour in the dark to attain the adsorption-desorption equilibrium [71–73]. Then, the suspension was irradiated from the top of the reactor (λmax = 365 nm, intensity = 2 mW cm−2) under continuous stirring. The temperature was maintained at room temperature with the circulation of thermostated water around the reactor. In order to estimate the DCF concentration during reaction, the samples were taken every 20 min, filtered by a 0.22-μm filter membrane, and then the absorbance of the filtrate was measured by the UV–vis spectrophotometer. The calibration curve was used to determine the DCF concentration during the photocatalytic reaction, applying the Beer’s law. The recycling tests were carried out for the re-used photocatalyst, i.e., the photocatalyst after the reaction was recovered by facile centrifugation, washing, and drying at 333 K. The recycling experiment was repeated two times, and thus finally four activity data were obtained, i.e., for fresh sample and after first, second and third re-use. It is well known that degradation of organic compounds does not mean that these compounds are completely mineralized (to CO2 and H2O). Therefore, it is essential to test simultaneously the mineralization efficiency (M%) during decontamination process. Accordingly, M% was investigated by measuring the total organic carbon (TOC 5000 A, SHIMADZU), which represents the quantity of carbon in water as organic pollutant [74]. The decrease in TOC level reflects the mineralization, since the total concentration of organic compounds in the solution is related to TOC value. The photodegradation rate of DCF was estimated and fitted with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood first-order kinetic model [71–73]. The kinetic photodegradation rate constants (K) for DCF photodegradation tests were calculated from the Langmuir−Hinshelwood first order formula (Eq. 1) [75]: (1) -ln (Ct/C0) = Kt, where, C0 and Ct are the DCF concentration before and after irradiation (at a certain time), respectively. The photodegradation rate (r0) for the degradation of DCF was determined using Eq. (2) [76,77]: (2) r 0 = − d A dt = K c 0 n , where K is the rate constant, C0 the concentration of the pollutant before irradiation, and n the order of the reaction (here, n = 1; first-order). The degradation efficiency (ƞ%) of DCF was determined using Eq. (3): (3) Ƞ% = (1- (Ct/C0)) × 100 The mineralization efficiency (M%) of DCF was investigated using Eq. (4) [74]: (4) M% = (1-(TOCt/TOC0)) × 100, where, TOC0 and TOCt are the TOC before and after irradiation (at a certain time), respectively."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Physicochemical properties,"3.1 Physicochemical properties The characterization of samples has already been reported [64], but the most important data are presented here (for discussion on the property/composition-governed activity). XRD patterns of pristine brookite (B), pristine anatase (A) and mixed-phase samples (BA1-BA3) are shown in Fig. 2(a). It was confirmed that single-phase titania, i.e., brookite or anatase was formed when only NaOH or NH4OH, respectively, was used for titania synthesis without glycine addition. In contrast, binary-phase (BA) samples were obtained in the presence of NaOH and glycine. Obviously, B sample exhibits the diffraction peaks of pure orthorhombic brookite structure (JCPDS no. 15-0875) at 2θ angles located around 25.3°, 25.7°, 30.8°, 32.8°, 36.2°, 37.4°, 40.1°, 42.3°, 46.1°, 48.2° 49.3°, 54.2°, 55.2° and 57.3°, corresponding to (120), (111), (121), (200), (012), (201), (022), (221), (032), (231), (132), (320), (241) and (113) planes, respectively. Moreover, the intensity ratio of brookite IB(121)/IB(120) is larger than 0.9, confirming the formation of a high-quality brookite without overlapping with any other polymorphs [78]. It has been proposed that sodium cation (Na+) plays a crucial role in the formation of brookite structure [60,79,80]. In the presence of NaOH, the sodium titanate (Na2Ti2O5·H2O) is formed at the initial step of hydrothermal treatment by strong electrostatic interaction between Na+ ions and negatively-charged 2D-layered titanate (H2Ti2O5·H2O). After that, sodium titanate undergoes slow dissolution under hydrothermal treatment (473 K), and hence releasing the Na+ from the titanate interlayer, driving the formation of brookite in the alkaline medium. The XRD patterns of BA1, BA2, and BA3 samples are attributed to the diffraction peaks of both tetragonal anatase and orthorhombic brookite structures, indicating the formation of binary-phase (BA) TiO2 structure with different phase compositions. This could be explained by the role of glycine and Na+, as Ti bonds to two functional groups of glycine (CO and NH2), resulting in the formation of five-membered ring complexes [Ti(OH)x(C2H5NO2)y]z- [80]. These complexes could combine with each other through sharing equatorial edges and get arranged in zigzag chains, leading to the formation of anatase structure, and Na+ presence results in the formation of brookite structure (as discussed above). Therefore, an increase in the glycine concentration during synthesis causes an increase in the content of anatase in the final product ( Table 1). A sample displays the diffraction peaks of tetragonal anatase (JCPDS no. 84–1286) at the 2θ angles around 25.3°, 37.1°, 37.8°, 38.6°, 48.2°, 54.2°, and 55.2°, ascribed to (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), and (121) planes, respectively. It has been proposed that NH4 + is responsible for the formation of pure anatase during hydrothermal process [64]. Here, the ammonium titanate ((NH4)2Ti2O5·H2O) is formed at the initial step of hydrothermal treatment (from the aqueous suspension of Ti2(SO4)3 and NH4OH) by an electrostatic interaction between NH4 + ions and 2D-layered titanate. Finally, the ammonium titanate undergoes fast dissolution under hydrothermal treatment (473 K), and thus releasing NH4 + ions from the titanate interlayer, which drives the formation of anatase. The summarize data of XRD analysis, showing crystalline composition and crystallite sizes, are presented in Table 1. The crystallite size of brookite (B sample; 59.0 nm) is only slightly larger than that of anatase (A sample; 57.8 nm), but the crystallite sizes of both phases are significantly reduced for mixed-phase samples, especially for larger content of glycine, reaching 51.0, 47.0 and 46 nm for brookite and 43.9, 43.0 and 24.8 nm for anatase for BA1, BA2 and BA3, respectively. Therefore, it might be concluded that crystal growth is inhibited when two phases are formed simultaneously during synthesis. Additionally, it has been confirmed that Na+, NH4 +, -OH and glycine, play an important role in the tailoring of the composition of BA mixed-phase samples. The Raman spectra have also confirmed the co-existence of two polymorphs of titania in mixed-phase samples, i.e., BA1, BA2 and BA3, and only one phase in B and A samples, as clearly shown in Fig. 2(b). Four Raman active modes, i.e., A1g (152.5, 248.9, 399.1, and 636.4 cm-1), B1g (215.8, 323.3, and 500.9 cm-1), B2g (367.3, 464.8 and 586.7 cm-1), and B3g (286.1 and 544.9 cm-1), corresponding to the brookite structure [81], are clearly observed in B spectrum (Fig. 2(b) and Table 2), and three Raman modes of anatase structure, i.e., Eg (144.4, 199.4, and 641.0 cm-1), B1g (399.2 and 517.8 cm-1), and A1g (517.8 cm-1), assigned to anatase structure [82], are displayed in the spectrum of A sample. Obviously, spectra of BA1, BA2 and BA3 samples exhibit the features of both polymorphs (i.e., brookite (A1g (198–199, 247–249, 398.6–411, and 638–639 cm-1), B1g (215–217,322–325,456–459, and 515–518 cm-1), B2g (356.1–368 cm-1), and B3g (286.4–288 cm-1)) TiO2 structure [81], and anatase (i.e., Eg (145–145.5, 198–199, and 638–639 cm-1), A1g (515–518 cm-1), and B1g (398.6–411 and 515–518 cm-1)) [82], proving the formation of binary-phase (BA) titania structure. Slight shift in the main Raman peak of Eg mode (around 145 cm-1) is observed for mixed-phases, as a result of the overlapping between signals from anatase and brookite, whereas other peaks that are only related to brookite appear almost at the same position, confirming previous findings on anatase-brookite photocatalysts [64,83]. Table 2 summarizes all data of the Raman band positions and their modes. The morphology of single phase (B and A) and mixed-phase (BA3) photocatalysts is presented in Fig. 3(a–d), whereas EDX data for BA3 sample are displayed in Fig. 3(e). Nano-spindle-like structures with a diameter of ca. 25 nm and length of ca. 110 nm have been formed in the case of brookite sample (B) with a high uniformity and a clean surface, as shown in FE-SEM image in Fig. 3(a). In contrast, anatase sample (A) is characterized by higher polydispersity in NPs’ shape (spherical, elongated and octahedral-faceted) and size (20–100 nm), with most nano-quasi-spherical-like structures (FE-SEM image in Fig. 3(b)). Anyway, the clear surfaces with exposed facets (well-define crystal planes) confirm high crystallinity of both polymorphs. Interestingly, the morphology of mixed-phase sample is not a simple reflection of both polymorphs i.e., spindle-like (brookite) and spherical (anatase) NPs, but the sample contains mainly rod-like (brookite) and fine spherical (anatase) NPs, as shown in Fig. 3(c–d). Accordingly, it might be confirmed that glycine works as morphology-control agent, resulting in elongation of brookite NPs and inhibition of crystal growth for anatase. The electron diffraction (ED) pattern, shown as an inset in Fig. 3(d), reveals the formation of binary-phase (BA) titania structure in BA3 sample. Moreover, the EDX spectrum confirms the high purity of BA3 sample, containing only titanium and oxygen (Fig. 3(e)). Therefore, though Na+, NH4 + and glycine plays a crucial role in the formation of photocatalyst, they are not present as impurities in the final product. The data of nitrogen adsorption-desorption are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table 3. As expected (based on crystallite size analysis and microscopic observation), the mixed-phase photocatalysts exhibit larger specific surface area (SSA) than single phase samples. The highest SSA of 62.3 m2 g-1 has been obtained for BA3 sample with the smallest crystallite sizes of both brookite and anatase, being ca. two times larger than that by pure brookite (32.3 m2 g-1) and anatase (27.9.3 m2 g-1). Considering porous characteristics of packed materials (during measurement of SSA), it has been observed that all samples show a typical type IV isotherm (according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) classifications) [84–86]. The narrow hysteresis loops at around 0.85–0.95, 0.86–0.95, and 0.85–0.94 P/Po, with pore size (PS) and pore volume (PV) of ca. 0.1–1.5 nm and 0.07 cm3 g-1, 0.5–1.5 nm and 0.08 cm3 g-1, and 0.95 nm and 0.12 cm3 g-1 have been obtained for brookite-rich samples, i.e., B, BA1 and BA2, respectively, revealing the formation of microsporous structure [86,87]. Contrastingly, anatase-rich samples, i.e., BA3 and A exhibit broad hysteresis loops located at around 0.75–0.99 and 0.82–0.99 P/Po with PS and PV of ca. 34.5 nm and 0.32 cm3 g-1, and 5.5–24.5 nm and 0.19 cm3 g-1, respectively, evincing the formation of mesoporous structure [88,89]. The photoabsorption properties of obtained samples are shown in Fig. 4(b). Both single-phase samples exhibit similar photoabsorption properties, with slightly higher light-harvesting ability by anatase (Eg = 376.7 nm) than brookite (Eg = 374.4 nm). Interestingly, light-absorption ability has been enhanced by the formation of binary-phase (BA) structures, with absorption edge shifted towards longer wavelengths, i.e., 385.0, 386.0 and 399.0 nm, for BA1, BA2 and BA3 respectively. This is quite surprising since usually mixed-phase titania exhibits photoabsorption properties similar to the properties of major component or average value, e.g., photoabsorption properties of P25 are between those of single phases separated from it, i.e., anatase and rutile [58,59]. It is possible that slight shift of photoabsorption towards vis range could be caused by either glycine (or its decomposition products) or the presence of defects. It is well known that carbon-containing compounds might modify the surface of titania or be doped inside titania lattice during synthesis, which results in photoabsorption shift [90–92]. Similarly, defects formed during synthesis might result in bathochromic shift of photoabsorption [93–95]. The lack of shift in anatase peak in XRD patterns (Fig. 2(a)) indicates that doping (both by self-doping and with foreign atoms) could be rather excluded. Moreover, the possible content of impurities would be very low, as only titanium and oxygen have been detected by EDX. Another possibility of bandgap narrowing could result from interparticle charge transfer excitation (ICTE), i.e., an electron excitation from the valence band (VB) of one phase to the conduction band (CB) of another phase (as discussed in the Section 3.2.3). The PL spectra for all samples after UV excitation (λex = 380 nm) are shown in Fig. 4(c). It is obvious that photoluminescence occurs for all samples at practically same position of ca. 472 nm, which correlates with the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) [96]. However, PL intensity is much different among samples. Interestingly the highest intensities are observed for single phase samples, and thus suggesting the fastest charge carriers’ recombination. In contrast, PL intensities of binary-phase (BA) photocatalysts (BA1, BA2 and BA3 samples) are weaker, indicating fast separation of charge carriers, as already reported for mixed-phase titania [60,97–102]. Accordingly, it is expected that mixed-phase titania, especially BA3 sample, should exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than single phase photocatalysts. Indeed, corresponding data have been obtained, as discussed further. To check the purity (or impurity) of synthesized samples, FT-IR spectra have been taken, and obtained data are shown in Fig. 4(d). Similar characteristic FT-IR bands with vibration modes in the range of 4000–400 cm-1 have been obtained for all samples. The broad stretching band in the range of 3600–300 cm-1 and the sharp bending band centered around 1630 cm-1 might be ascribed as the vibration modes of Ti-OH bonds and physically adsorbed water, respectively [103–106]. Moreover, the low energy bands located in the range of 900–400 cm-1 might be attributed to the stretching vibration modes of Ti–O bond and Ti–O–Ti bridge [103–105]. Therefore, it might be concluded that synthesized titania photocatalysts consists of only Ti and O elements, and thus it has not been doped/modified by other elements/compounds, confirming EDX data (Fig. 3(e)). From the above results, it might be concluded that Na+, NH4 +, -OH, and glycine play an important role in controlling the physicochemical properties of the as-prepared TiO2 photocatalyst. For example, with an increase in the glycine concentration: (1) the brookite content decreases, whereas anatase content increases (Table 1); (2) the crystallite sizes of both phases decrease (Table 1); (3) the specific surface areas increase (Table 3); (4) the absorption edges shift to longer wavelengths, the bandgap values decrease (Table 3); and (6) PL intensities are reduced. It has been expected that the best sample, i.e., with the largest specific surface area, smallest crystallites, lowest PL, etc. is BA3 sample (38.2% nano-rod-like brookite/61.8% nano-quasi-spherical-like anatase), prepared with 3.2 mol L-1 glycine/NaOH (1/3 vol ratio). Indeed, this sample is also the most active as discussed in the next section."
8,Photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Photocatalytic activity 3.2.1 H2 generation The data of photocatalytic generation of H2 under UV/vis irradiation on the synthesized samples and the reference commercial titania (P25) are shown in Fig. 5. It is clear that single-component photocatalysts exhibit the lowest photocatalytic activity, with brookite (B) being slightly more active than anatase (A), despite its smaller specific surface area (27.90 m2 g-1 for brookite and 32.30 m2 g-1 for anatase). This could be explained by the possibility of slightly more negative CB bottom of brookite than that of the anatase [60,63], and thus larger ability of proton reduction. P25 shows much higher activity than both polymorphs, which could be caused by rutile presence, being reported as more active than anatase for hydrogen evolution [59]. Interestingly, mixed-phase samples exhibit similar or even higher activity than that by P25. It is thought that activity improvement, especially for BA3 sample with clear synergistic effect (much higher activity than the sum of activities by single phases), could not be explained only by possible charge migration between phases. It should be reminded that in this system, platinum was deposited in situ, working as electron scavenger, and thus already inhibiting charge carriers’ recombination. Therefore, few factors could be responsible for activity increase: (i) bandgap narrowing, resulting in efficient light harvesting, (ii) an increase in the specific surface area, providing more hydroxyl groups on the titania surface, and thus promoting adsorption of methanol molecules on the photocatalyst surface (through hydrogen bonds), (iii) migration of charge carriers between phases (heterojunction type II), (iv) existence of shallow electron traps (possible reason of bandgap narrowing), causing longer lifetime of charge carriers, and (v) possible interparticle charge transfer excitation (ICTE), i.e., VB electrons in brookite or anatase being excited to CB of anatase or brookite, respectively, as already proven for anatase-rutile mixed-phase photocatalysts [107]. It is thought that the last possibility (ICTE) could be responsible for high activity enhancement, as discussed in the Section 3.2.3. 3.2.2 Degradation and mineralization of DCF The photocatalytic degradation of DCF over synthesized photocatalysts and P25 was performed under UV-A irradiation. Prior to that, the possible degradation of DCF by direct photolysis (absence of photocatalyst) and its adsorption ability (in the dark) on the photocatalyst surface were investigated, and obtained data are shown in Fig. 6(a). It is obvious that sole irradiation does not cause the degradation of DCF. On the other hand, the adsorption ability on B, BA1, BA2, BA3, A and P25 reaches 3.2%, 9.0%, 11.1%, 25.0%, 6.8% and 14.2%, respectively, after 30-min stirring in the dark, and then remains constant (Fig. 6(a)), indicating that the adsorption-desorption equilibrium has been achieved [71–73]. Obviously, the specific surface area plays an essential role in efficient adsorption of DCF molecules on the photocatalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 6(b). However, it must be underlined that both adsorption and direct UV photolysis are not sufficient for complete removal of DCF from water. Therefore, it is proposed that photocatalysis is necessary for the efficient removal of DCF from water. Indeed, DFC could be removed completely by the most active mixed-phase photocatalyst (BA3) during 2 h of irradiation ( Fig. 7). The activity of single-phase photocatalysts is the worst, similar to H2 evolution data. However, here the activities of the samples differ significantly, where brookite is much less active than anatase. It might confirm that VB level of anatase is more positive than that by brookite, and thus anatase has larger oxidation ability. Similar observation has been found by Buchalska et al. for anatase/rutile photocatalysts with anatase being more active than rutile for oxidation reaction via photogenerated holes [108]. Moreover, lower activity of brookite than that by anatase could be explained by faster charge carriers’ recombination, as proven by PL experiments (Fig. 4(c)). Mixed-phase photocatalysts exhibit much higher activity than single-phase ones, which could be explained similarly to data obtained for H2 evolution, i.e., more efficient light harvesting, larger specific surface area, longer lifetime of charge carriers (resulting from possible migration of charges between phases (heterojunction type II) and shallow electron traps), and possible ICTE. The kinetic analysis (ln (Ct/C0) vs. illumination time) is shown in Fig. 8. Of course, BA3 sample shows the highest rate constant (K = 0.060 min-1), which is 2.3, 3.2, 4.0, 6.0, and 10.0 times higher than those by P25 (0.026 min-1), BA2 (0.019 min-1), BA1 (0.015 min-1), A (0.010 min-1), and B (0.006 min-1) samples, respectively. Fig. 8(b) presents the rate of DCF degradation against irradiation time. It should be pointed out that degradation of organic compounds does not unequivocally mean the purification since in some cases the degradation products could be more harmful and toxic than original compounds. Therefore, complete oxidation, i.e., mineralization, should be achieved. Fortunately, the most active photocatalyst (BA3) results in complete decomposition of DCF during 3 h of UV-A irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7, and the mineralization efficiency (M%) correlates well with degradation efficiency ( Fig. 9). 3.2.3 Photocatalytic stability and reaction mechanism It is well known that besides high activity, the stability of photocatalyst is very important for the practical application. Therefore, the stability of best photocatalyst (BA3) has been checked during recycling, and obtained data are shown in Fig. 10(a). It is clear that photocatalyst could be repeatedly used without losing its activity, indicating the high stability of the as-synthesized BA titania. Although the synergism between brookite and anatase has been proven, its origin is unknown without further studies. Of course, there are some literature reports that could help to understand the mechanism. For example, it has been reported that CB levels of anatase and brookite are different reaching −0.48 and −0.57 V vs NHE (at pH = 7) [60] or −0.35 and −0.54 V vs NHE at pH = 7) [83]. The CB levels of both polymorphs are more negative than the potential of O2/•−O2 (−0.33 V), and thus oxygen could be effectively reduced to •−O2 on the surface of brookite and anatase, but usually anatase shows to be more active to form •−O2 (Eqs. 5–6, 8) [102]. Moreover, the VB potentials of both anatase and brookite are obviously more positive than the potential of -OH/•OH (1.99 V) and H2O/•OH (2.34 V) [102], and thus the photogenerated holes in the VB of both anatase and brookite phase could react with H2O and –OH to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH, Eqs. 5, 7–8). (5) TiO2 + UV-A → e− (CB) + h+ (VB), (6) e− (CB) + O2 → •−O2, (7) h+ (VB) + H2O/-OH → •OH, (8) h+/•−O2/•OH + DCF → CO2 + H2O, Moreover, the position of CB levels of anatase and rutile could suggest that in the case of ICTE, electrons should be excited from brookite (VB) into CB of anatase. To check this, the experiments with scavengers have been performed for anatase, brookite and mixed-phase sample (BA3), and the obtained data are shown in Fig. 10(b–d). Different scavengers, i.e., AgNO3, Na2-EDTA, BQ and IPA, have been used as trapping agents for e−, h+, •−O2 and •OH, respectively. Interestingly, completely different behavior has been observed for anatase and brookite samples. In the case of brookite, the activity is significantly decreased in the presence of BQ and AgNO3, indicating that the most active are photogenerated electrons (similarly to rutile case). In contrast, hydroxyl radicals and photogenerated holes are the most active species in the case of anatase. However, the scavenger tests for mixed-phase photocatalyst indicate that all scavengers decrease the activity significantly, almost same as those in single-phase photocatalysts, i.e., photogenerated holes and electrons seem to be responsible for activity of brookite and anatase, respectively. Therefore, it might be proposed that the opposite position of CB and VB levels could be expected for mixed samples, i.e., anatase with more negative CB than that in brookite. Accordingly, it is proposed that during ICTE, photogenerated electrons in VB of anatase are directly excited to CB of brookite, and thus the main redox species are located respectively on anatase (holes) and brookite (electrons), as shown in Fig. 11(c). Moreover, type II heterojunction would be also possible with electrons’ transfer from CB of anatase to brookite and holes’ migration from brookite to anatase, as shown by doted lines in the scheme (c). It is though that both ICTE and type II heterojunction could be responsible for synergistic effect between anatase and brookite, and thus significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity."
9,Conclusions,"The mixed-phase titania (BA) could be successfully prepared by a facile template-free hydrothermal method, using Ti2(SO4)3 in an alkaline solution of glycine/Na+. The B/A ratio is easily tuned by changing the glycine concentration. The green H2-fuel might be generated and DCF toxic pollutant can be completely removed from aqueous solution over binary-phase (BA) titania photocatalyst under UV irradiation. It has been found that mixed-phase photocatalysts exhibit the synergistic effect for both tested reactions, due to efficient charge carriers’ generation and separation, probably due to ICTE and heterojunction type II. Although mixed phase photocatalysts show high activity for both hydrogen generation and DCF mineralization under UV irradiation, only slight narrowing of their bandgaps (even considering the ICTE mechanism) is the main limitation for broad commercialization, especially for world regions with low intensity of solar radiation. Accordingly, the further development of materials with more efficient light harvesting (vis-response) is highly needed. Even though the mixed-phase BA titania samples do not exhibit vis-response, the high activity enhancement in comparison to single-phase titania indicates that ICTE could be highly profitable also for other mixed-phase photocatalysts, and thus is worth further investigations."
