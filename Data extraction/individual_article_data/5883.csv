0,Introduction,"The substantial decrease in fossil fuels has resulted in the search for alternative and low-cost methods of energy production (Kakarla and Min, 2014). In this respect, bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have gained immense attention for generating electricity and biofuels with the simultaneous treatment of organic waste and wastewater (Kondaveeti et al., 2014). The potentiality of BES application for biofuel production has been evaluated for hydrogen, methane (Cheng et al., 2009; Logan et al., 2008), and other value-added products (Rabaey and Rozendal 2010) using a bioelectrocatalyzed cathode electrode. In the process of biofuel generation using BES, an external power supply serves as the energy source that drives the microbial electrochemical reduction of proton ions, carbon dioxide (CO2), and volatile fatty acids (Sharma et al., 2013). However, biofuel production in BESs is still in the beginning stages, and requires improvement in several areas to make it commercially available (Srikanth et al., 2014). In general, biofuels production from organic sources is limited to complex substrates such as lignocelluloses and wheat straw hydrolysate, which are further reduced to simple substrates (Acetic and butyric acid) (Srikanth et al., 2014). In this aspect, anaerobic digestion (AD) effluent with volatile fatty acids such as acetic and butyric acid can serve as organic compounds for biofuel production (Spirito et al., 2014). In typical wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), the effluent from AD is subjected to activated sludge systems or recycled for further treatment processes (Appels et al., 2008). These biofuel generations from AD effluent can be enhanced using exocellular mediators to modify energy metabolism. Mediator compounds cycle between oxidized and reduced states and play a vital role in bacterial metabolism by creating an additional electron flow and thereby enhancing biofuel production. Mediators such as neutral red (NR), methyl viologen (MV), methylene blue (MB), and anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS) are used in ABE (Acetone–Butanol–Ethanol) fermentation systems and in BES to shift fermentative metabolism to biofuel (bioalcohol and biogas) synthesis and to limit organic acid synthesis (Steinbusch et al., 2009; Yarlagadda et al., 2012). Although the exact mechanism of how mediators regulate fermentative pathways is not fully understood, the supplementation of mediators is an attractive method for enhancing the electron flow from organic acids to biofuels. The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion effluent to generate biofuels (bioalcohol and biogas) in bioelectochemical systems (BES) with the help of an external power supply. A bioelectrochemical cell (BES) operation was performed using an abiotic anode electrode and biocatalyzed cathode electrode for the formation of biofuel in a cathode chamber. The production of biofuel from anaerobic digestion effluent was tested at various external power inputs (1.0, 1.5 and 2 V), and the effect of mediators (Neutral red; NR) was also evaluated. The presence of NR has been known to influence the bacterial exocellular electron transfer metabolism with elevated current generations. Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) were pursued for a better understanding of BES operation with AD effluent and in the presence of mediators."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial inoculum and electrolyte,"2.1 Microbial inoculum and electrolyte Inoculum for the microbial consortium and anaerobic digestion (AD) effluent for the cathode compartment were obtained from Yongin Respia Wastewater Treatment Plant (Yongin-si, Korea). The initial concentrations of VFAs in AD effluent were 0.5 ± 0.04 (Acetic acid) and 1.84 ± 0.19 g/l (Butyric acid), respectively. The electrolyte for BES operation in the absence of planktonic cells (suspended culture) was pursued using growth media (GM). The GM consisted of a vitamin and mineral solution and was prepared as described in previous studies (Kakarla and Min, 2014)."
3,Mediator for microbial redox reactions,"2.2 Mediator for microbial redox reactions The external supplementation of mediators can provide an alternative electron flow by enhancing the production of biofuel, and also can accelerate power generations due to variations in the physiology of bacteria. NR was selected based on certain characteristics such as high solubility, complete reversibility, stability and lack of combination with other molecules (Fultz and Durst, 1982). Moreover, one of the primary biocomponents involved in microbial redox reactions is NADH, with a redox potential of −320 mV, as similar to NR (−325 mV). NR was demonstrated to be biologically active in anaerobic conditions; mediator was used in concentrations (1 mM) similar to those used in other research studies (Steinbusch et al., 2009)."
4,Bioelectrochemical system set-up and operation,"2.3 Bioelectrochemical system set-up and operation A double chamber “H” type BES cell with two compartments was chosen and operated in fed-batch mode by varying the external cell voltages. Each compartment cell consisted of 200 ml as a working volume with a total volume of 250 ml. Platinum-coated carbon paper (0.5 mg/cm2) with a surface area of 40 cm2 was used as an anode, and a carbon brush (3 × 2.5 cm) was used as cathode. The carbon brush cathode was prepared by twisting the carbon fibers with stainless steel wire. The electrical connections on the electrode were established using copper wire and by sealing the contact area with non-conductive epoxy resin. The anode and cathode compartments were separated using pretreated Nafion-117 (PEM; Dupont Co., USA). The membrane and cathode electrode (carbon brush) pretreatment were pursued as described in previous literature (Feng et al., 2010; Moon et al., 2015). To avoid membrane swelling when placed in BES, pretreated membranes were stored in deionized water and taken out prior to being used. Ag/AgCl (sat'd NaCl) from bio analytical instruments (USA) was used as a reference electrode in the cathode chamber during the electrochemical analysis and for noting cathode potentials. The anode and cathode electrodes were connected to a DC power supply and various external energy inputs (1.0, 1.5 and 2 V) were supplemented (Huang et al., 2013). Catholyte consists of either AD effluent or GM, as per requirements. Prior to supplementation, the cathode influent pH was adjusted to 6 using either 1 M HCl or NaOH. In both cases, the anode chamber of the reactor consisted of GM (pH 6). The cathode and anode solutions were continuously stirred for effective mixing and operated in a temperature-controlled incubator at 30 ± 2 °C. BES reactors were sealed using silicone gel to ensure strict anaerobic conditions. Prior to sealing of the BES reactors, headspace and solutions were purged with nitrogen gas for 15–20 min, minimizing the effect of dissolved oxygen. The anolyte and catholyte were replaced when a decrease in cell voltage was noticed. After 94 days of operation with AD effluent, the electrically-active biocathode electrode was transferred to fresh growth medium and operated at 1.5 V with similar concentrations of acetic and butyric acid. Along with BES, three additional sets of reactors were operated as a control. The first control reactor was operated similar to the BES with the exception of sterilization (autoclaving) of the cathode solutions (Anaerobic digestion effluent). The second control reactor was operated by maintaining abiotic cathode (no inoculums) conditions with an external supplement of acetic and butyric acids. The third control reactor was operated without supplementation of external energy (open circuit conditions). These control experiments were pursued to illustrate the importance of biological catalyst (biofilm), as well as the influence of external cell voltage to crossover thermodynamic barriers for product formation. All experiments and analysis were pursued in replicated (duplicate or triplicate) cycles to maintain consistency."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods For liquid analysis, 10 ml of samples were collected at the end of operation (4–6 days) using a sterile and nitrogen-purged syringe. The collected samples were filtered using an acrodisc (0.2 μm) syringe filter. VFA concentrations in the liquid phase were measured using an ion chromatogram (IC-861, Metrohm, USA) equipped with an organic acid column (model: Metrosep 250/7.8, Metrohm, USA). Head-space biogas analyses were pursued using a gas chromatograph (Younglin Instruments, Korea) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and carboxen column (Supelco, USA). The oven temperature was maintained at 150 °C, whereas the injector and detector temperatures were 100 and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen gas was used as a carrier at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Sampling was performed with a sterile gas-tight syringe (Hamilton, USA) and analyzed immediately. Bioalcohols such as ethanol, methanol, proponol, acetone, glycerol, butanol etc. were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC; Agilent, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and fitted with an HP innowax column (Agilent, USA). The injector, oven, and detector temperatures were 150, 220, and 230 °C, respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. All analytical systems (GC and IC) were calibrated with standard chemicals in a range of sample concentrations. The GC and IC sample preparations were pursued as described in previous studies (Merzougui et al., 2011)."
6,Electrochemical measurements and calculations,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements and calculations External energy inputs of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 V were applied to test the effect of voltage on product formation. The desired external voltage was applied to the circuit using a DC power supply. The negative lead of the power source was connected to the cathode with an external resistance of 15 Ω and the positive lead of the circuit was connected directly to the anode. The voltage was measured across an external resistor with a 5 min time interval using a data acquisition system in a personal computer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses were pursued to analyze the effect of mediators in BES using a potentiostat (Versa Stat 3, Princeton Applied Research, USA). CV measurements were evaluated within a range of −0.9 to 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The Coulombic efficiency (CE) of BES, using a bioelectrocatalyzed cathode for the reduction of VFAs (Acetic and Butyric acid), was calculated by dividing the Coulombs of the product (Ca) by the total coulombs (CI). Total Coulombs were obtained by integrating the area under the current vs. time (I–t curve). The amount of Coulombs (Ca) distributed in the moles of individual products (ni) by BES in the process of the bioelectrocatalyzed reduction of VFAs was calculated by following Equations included in the body of the text should be punctuated accordingly. (Marshall et al., 2012): (1) C a = F b i n i , where bi is the number of electrons in the product; F is Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol); and n is the number of moles of product. Capacitance and energy calculations were performed by analyzing the CV data (Raghavulu et al., 2012) using the following equation: (2) C = Q 0 V 0 , where C is the capacitance (F), Q0 is the charge obtained (C), and V0 is the maximum applied voltage (V)."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Current generation in the bioelectrochemical reduction process,"3.1 Current generation in the bioelectrochemical reduction process Reductive biocatalytic current generations were observed in BES at various applied voltages (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 V) by measuring the cell voltage across the external resistor (Fig. 1 , Table 2 ). Based on other studies (Sharma et al., 2013; Srikanth et al., 2014), it is presumed that the applied voltages used in this study were sufficient to reach activation energy. Initial current generations without mediator were observed after 18 days of operation with an applied voltage of 1 V, and the applied voltage was further increased to 1.5 and 2 V. At 1 V, the current generation and cathode potentials (vs Ag/AgCl) were −0.48 ± 0.03 mA and −0.45 ± 0.02 V, respectively. The current generations and cathode potentials were further enhanced to −0.64 ± 0.02 mA and −0.68 ± 0.018 V, with operation at 1.5 V. Reductive current appeared to increase with increases in applied voltages; at 2 V the BES current generation and cathode potentials were −0.78 ± 0.01 mA and −0.84 ± 0.032 V, respectively. After 63 days of operation, 1 mM of neutral red was added to the cathode chamber as a mediator for the bioelectochemical reduction. Increased current generation and cathode potentials were noticed in the presence of the mediator. The variation of external cell voltage (1, 1.5, and 2 V) with neutral red mediator resulted in enhanced cell voltages of −0.52 ± 0.016, −0.7 ± 0.021, −1.1 ± 0.018 mA and cathode potentials of −0.51 ± 0.014, −0.69 ± 0.016, and −0.89 ± 0.018 V, respectively. Elevated current generations were observed in the presence of mediator due to the enhanced extra cellular electron transfer metabolism of biocatalytic activity. Steinbush et al., demonstrated similar results of increased current generation in the presence of mediators (Steinbusch et al., 2009). In their study, initial current generation of 7.8 mA was amplified to 18.5 mA using methyl viologen (MV) as a mediator. The bioelectochemical cell operation at 1.5 V with synthetic growth media supplemented with acetic and butyric acid and in the absence of planktonic cells exhibited an immediate (0.8 d) reduction current of −0.78 ± 0.032 mA (Fig. S1). This result suggests that the bioelectrochemical reduction was obtained via the biocatalytic activity of microorganisms attached to the cathode electrode. No current generation and biofuels formation were observed in the BES control reactors (Fig. S2)."
9,Bioalcohol and biogas production from the bioelectrochemical reduction of anaerobic digestion effluent,"3.2 Bioalcohol and biogas production from the bioelectrochemical reduction of anaerobic digestion effluent The product profiles represented here were drawn after examination in replicated cycles, and the results obtained were within the border of experimental errors. The characteristics of AD effluent used in the BES reactor were analyzed using standard methods (APHA, 2005), as presented in Table 1. The initial concentrations of acetic and butyric acids in anaerobic digestion effluent were 0.5 ± 0.04 and 1.84 ± 0.19 g/l, respectively (Fig. 2 ). Bioelectrochemical reduction at 1 V revealed no bioalcohol generations (Fig. 2a), which might be due to a smaller cathodic potential (−0.45 V) (Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). By increasing the applied voltages (1.5 and 2 V), the bioelectrocatalyzed synthesis of bioalcohols was observed as represented in Fig. 2a. At 1.5 V, the concentration of ethanol and butanol were 31 and 57 mg/l, respectively. The ethanol concentration (31 mg/l) at 1.5 V in this study was smaller than the value (50 mg/l) from the other BES operation (Sharma et al., 2013). This difference in ethanol production may be due to different initial concentration of acetic acid (100 mM vs 8.3 mM in this study) and butyric acid (100 mM vs 20 mM in this study). By increasing the cell voltage to 2 V, amplifications in product profiles were observed. Butanol (91 mg/l) and proponol (60 mg/l) were the main products observed, and other alcohols were in range of 50 mg/l. Although ethanol production was observed at 1.5 V, it was not observed at 2 V, possibly due to the further reduction of ethanol to other products or the usage of ethanol as a bacterial substrate (Müller, 2001; Sharma et al., 2013). Several researchers reported that oxidation of ethanol in ABE fermentation favored the synthesizing of butyrate and propionate (Agler et al., 2011). The product profiles observed in this study at 2 V with a cathode potential of −840 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) were similar to other studies operating with a working electrode (cathode) potential of −850 mV (Sharma et al., 2013). In their study, the concentrations of butanol and proponol were 100 and 87 mg/l, respectively. BES operation at various external cell voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 V resulted in hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) as predominant headspace biogas products (Fig. 2b). No methane generation was noticed with applied voltages of 1 V and 1.5 V; whereas at 2 V, methane generation was observed at 11 ± 2.1%. An increase in hydrogen generation was noticed with increase in applied voltages. The percentages of hydrogen in the headspace at 1, 1.5, and 2 V were 3.7 ± 0.5, 7.2 ± 0.8 and 25.4 ± 1.3% respectively. No bioalcohol and current generation were detected in the BES control reactor, suggesting that product formation was solely due to bioelectrocatalytic activity on the cathode electrode. The hydrogen gas concentrations in the control at various voltages (1, 1.5, and 2 V) were 1.6 ± 0.4 2.0 ± 0.1, and 5.9 ± 1.1%, respectively."
10,Cyclic voltammogram of bioelectochemical reduction of anaerobic digestion effluent both with and without mediator,"3.3 Cyclic voltammogram of bioelectochemical reduction of anaerobic digestion effluent both with and without mediator Cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques help to determine the ability of biocatalysts on an electrode surface to drive reductive reactions. In the present study, CV was used to pinpoint the influence of extra cellular mediators on the biocatalyst to show a charge transfer phenomenon. The CV profiles indicated variations in electrochemical behavior in the presence of mediators (Fig. 3 ). The catalytic currents were similar with variation in the supplementation of mediators; however a significant variation in peak current was noticed with increases in mediator concentration (0–1 mM). This might be due to the unidirectional pass of electrons from electrode to NR and NADH (Park and Zeikus, 2000). The reductive peak potential with various concentrations (0, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 mM) of an exocellular mediator was noticed at around −410 to −450 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) with variations in peak current. The bioelectrochemical reduction of fumarate to succinate in the other study exhibited a redox potential of about −520 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the presence of NR mediator (Park and Zeikus, 1999). BES operation without mediators and with various concentrations of mediators (0.5, 0.75, and 1 mM) resulted in peak currents of −0.11, −0.14, −0.19, and −0.28 mA, respectively. This redox-coupled reaction of NR with NADH might increase the synthesis of ethanol and butanol, which was also indicated by enhanced alcohol formation with mediator, as shown in Fig. 4 . The charge and capacitance were calculated based on the voltammetric profiles. Charge is an indicator of the number of electrons available at an instant during an electrochemical reaction (Kondaveeti and Min, 2013). The bioelectrochemical reduction processes without and with NR mediator (1 mM) exhibited 3.1 × 10−3and 7 × 10−3 C, respectively. This result suggests that the presence of mediator in BES for bioelectrochemical reduction processes can increase the availability of electrons for favorable reductive reactions. Capacitance is a measurement for the amount of electrical charge stored at a maximum applied potential. These charges stored in capacitive electrodes are directly proportional to the migration of electrons towards the electrode. Higher capacitance values were noticed in BES with the presence of mediator (7.7 mF) in comparison to without mediator (3.5 mF). These results suggest that the enhanced holding capacity of charge with mediator can increase biofuel synthesis as shown in previous studies (Srikanth et al., 2014)."
11,The effect of mediator on biofuel (bioalcohol and biogas) production,"3.4 The effect of mediator on biofuel (bioalcohol and biogas) production In the presence of mediator (NR), the formation of biofuel production was detected with the consecutive initiation of electron utilization (Fig. 4). Accordingly, it is assumed that product synthesis was the consequence of electro-catalyzed biofilm reductive reactions. At 1 V (Cathode potential: −0.51 V), ethanol, proponol, and butanol appear in concentrations of 19.8 mg/l, 30 mg/l, and 31 mg/l, respectively (Fig. 4a). These concentrations were lower in comparison to other studies (Steinbusch et al., 2009) carried out by Steinbusch et al., where acetic acid was used as an electron acceptor (Cathode potential: −0.55 V). In their study, ethanol concentration of 83 mg/l was noticed using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor inoculum; with methyl viologen as an external cellular mediator. The different concentrations of ethanol generation might be due to variations in reactor configuration (flat plate vs. double chamber), type of mediator (methyl viologen vs. neutral red), concentration of substrate, and biological activity on the cathode electrode. Enhanced ethanol productions were observed with increases in applied cell voltage. At 1.5 V; ethanol (50 mg/l) and butanol (70 mg/l) were noticed as predominant bioalcohols, where as the propanol concentration was 40 mg/l. Bioelectrochemical cell operation at 2 V (cathode potential: −0.9 V) exhibited butanol and ethanol formations in concentrations of 130 mg/l and 49.8 mg/l, respectively. The concentration profile observed at 2 V (Cathode potential: −0.9 V) was higher in comparison to recent studies pursued by Sharma et al., where mixed cultures of sulfate reducers were used as the predominant bacteria on a working electrode (Cathode potential: −0.85 V). In their study, they produced up to 50 mg/l of ethanol and 100 mg/l of butanol as bioalcohols. The amplified production of butanol in comparison to other studies might be due to the usage of redox mediators (Girbal et al., 1995; Yarlagadda et al., 2012). Proponol (41 mg/l) and butanol (47 mg/l) were prevalent bioalcohols recorded in BES by transferring the electrocatalyzed biofilm electrode into growth media with similar concentrations of acetic and butyric acids as in anaerobic digestion effluent (Fig. S1, Table 2). The presence of neutral red (mediator) enhanced the generation of biogas (hydrogen and methane) (Fig. 4b). The hydrogen production of 15.1 ± 1.7, 26.3 ± 2.1, and 31.8 ± 2.4% was observed at cell voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 V, respectively. The overall concentration of methane was less than 9.4 ± 1.6% in the headspace. The absence of bioalcohol formations and current generations was noticed in the BES control reactors. The hydrogen gas concentrations at external supplemented voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 V were 5.9 ± 0.7, 8.7 ± 1.4, and 10.9 ± 1.4%, respectively. During BES operation with AD effluent and in the presence of NR at various cell voltages; the initial catholyte pH of 6.0 was decreased to 4.9 ± 0.2. The decrease in catholyte pH might be due to an increased concentration of biofuels (Nevin et al., 2010; Rabaey and Rozendal, 2010). No variation in pH was observed in BES control reactors at various applied voltages."
12,Coulombs distribution in synthesized products from anaerobic digestion effluent,"3.5 Coulombs distribution in synthesized products from anaerobic digestion effluent The Columbic efficiency (CE) is defined as the percentage of supplied electrons to final products in a cathode. The CE was calculated at both operational conditions (the presence and absence of mediator) with various applied voltages (1, 1.5 and 2 V) using anaerobic digestion effluent as catholyte. The distributions of Coulomb into biofuels and end products were calculated and are depicted in Fig. 5 . BES operation at various cell voltages (1, 1.5 and 2 V) with anaerobic digestive effluent (Fig. 5a) exhibited total Coulombs (supplemented electrons) of 77,165, 2,77,055, 1,75,525 C and total CE of 20, 4.9, and 9.8%, respectively. The total Coulombs from current generation were higher in the BES operation with the supplementation of mediators, due to variations in bacterial extra cellular activity. The presence of mediator (Fig. 5b) and operation with various external cell voltages (1, 1.5 and 2 V) resulted in total coulombs (supplemented electrons) of 80,051, 1,77,870, and 2,43,493 C, and CE of 15, 8, and 7.8% respectively. Total Coulombs were distributed to diversified products of biofuels (bioalcohols and biogas) in both operational conditions. The BES operation with anaerobic digestion effluent at various external cell voltages (1, 1.5 and 2 V) for biofuel production resulted in Coulombs of 22.3, 4064, 7426 C, and CE of 0.029, 1.5, and 4.2%, respectively. With the supplementation of mediator, the Coulombs of biofuels at voltages of 1, 1.5, and 2 V were increased to 2811, 5226, and 8279 C, respectively, and the CEs were 3.5, 2.9, and 3.5%. BES operation at 1.5 V with GM containing acetic and butyric acids exhibited a total Coulombs (current) of 89,116, 4130, and a CE for biofuels of 4.6%. The CE observed in this study were slightly smaller (11–24%), in comparison to other studies of BES operation for VFAs reduction at −0.85 V (Sharma et al., 2013, 2014). The product recovery (conversion) percentage based on the Coulombs of VFAs supplemented (45,923 C) in the BES operation using AD effluent at various external cell voltages (1, 1.5, and 2 V) were 28, 29, and 34%, respectively. These values were amplified with the supplementation of mediators, due to increased biofuel concentrations. During BES operation in the presence of mediators, the recovery (conversion) percentages based on Coulombs of VFAs supplemented (46,698 C) at various external cell voltages (1, 1.5 and 2 V) were 30, 31, and 40%, respectively. By changing the catholyte solution from AD effluent to GM media, the recovery (conversion) percentage based on Coulombs VFAs supplemented (43,688 C) was decreased to 13%, due to decremented biofuels concentration. The recovery percentages noticed in this study were similar to other BES (30%)studies using CO2 to generate value-added products (Annie Modestra et al., 2015). Lactic and formic acids were observed as major byproducts of BES operation with anaerobic digestion effluent and in the presence of mediator. The coulombic efficiency of lactic acid as a byproduct at various cell voltages (1, 1.5, and 2 V) and with anaerobic digestion effluent were 6.6, 2.9, and 4.6%, respectively. In the presence of mediator, the coulombic efficiencies of lactic acid were 8.2 (1 V), 4.1 (1.5 V), and 3.5% (2 V). The generation of lactic acid in BES from reductive substrates such as acetic and butyric acids can be detrimental to biofuels formation. Although the production of large amounts of lactic acid compared to the other alcohols could not be clearly understood in this study, some operational conditions such as pH, dissolved solid, and temperature may be used as the controlling factor to enhance biofuel production by eliminating lactic acid-producing bacteria (Narendranath and Power, 2005). Alternatively, lactic acid can be used for the synthesis of bioplastics, and also used as acidulant, favoring and preservative in food industry (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013; Venkateswar Reddy et al., 2014). Recent studies carried out by Sharma et al., using VFAs (acetic and butyric acids) as electron acceptor, also observed lactic acid (1.5 g/l) as a predominant byproduct (Sharma et al., 2013). The major interference noticed in the conversion of electrical energy into organic chemicals using BES was nonselective transformations of product at consistent kinetic rates in biocathodes. BES operation was pursued with a simple combination of acetic and butyric acids from anaerobic digestion effluent; however, the biofuels (bioalcohols and biogas) were diversified. Moreover the presence of mediator did not alter the biofuel formation, but enhanced the end product concentration. This was possibly due to the presence of various microorganisms in the cathode biofilm or the various metabolic pathways of bacteria (Wu et al., 2012). Therefore, further research in biocathodes using advanced cell configuration is needed to achieve higher conversion rates and specificity of product formation at low cost. This is also essential in the separating and recovery of fermentation products. Recently, Lu and his co-workers (Lu and Li 2014) developed a gas-stripping process for the extraction of solvents from fermentation processes. This is of special interest because products synthesized in the BES process can be easily coupled to their system, with the simultaneous synthesis and recovery of products."
13,Conclusion,"The bioelectrochemical reduction of anaerobic digestion effluent at various applied cell voltages was evaluated for biofuel production. Increases in current (−0.48 to −0.78 mA) generation and biofuels concentration were noticed with increased applied voltages (1, 1.5, and 2 V). Ethanol, butanol, and proponol were determined to be predominant bioalcohols. Hydrogen and methane were present in the headspace biogas. The concentrations of biofuels were amplified with the supplementation of mediators due to increases in current generation and capacitance. Enhanced biofuels and specificity in biofuels can be resolved in further optimized bioelectrochemical reduction processes."
