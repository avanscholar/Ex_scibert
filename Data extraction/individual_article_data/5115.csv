0,Introduction,"Hydrogen as an energy carrier can replace fossil fuels and address issues of environmental emissions and energy security [1,2]. Among the various hydrogen production processes, hydrogen production from biomass by anaerobic fermentation is an energy-saving and environmentally friendly process. Hydrogen is produced from starch biomass and cellulose biomass using similar processes: complex organic polymers are hydrolyzed to glucose by fermentative bacteria which ferment the glucose to a mixture of low-molecular-weight organic acids and alcohols. These fermentation products are further oxidized to acetic acid and hydrogen by obligatory hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria through a process called acetogenesis. Thus, it is essential to use glucose as the substrate to analyze the characteristics of hydrogen production. In most systems for the biological production of hydrogen, glucose can be metabolized to pyruvate through several pathways, often involving the Embden–Meyerhoff–Parnas (i.e. glycolysis) or the Entner–Doudoroff pathways. Both of these pathways produce 2mol of pyruvate and 2mol of NADH for every mole of glucose that is transformed [3]. Therefore, most researches' results are about 2molH2/molglucose [4–7]. If the hydrogen partial pressure is sufficiently low (<60Pa), the NADH that is produced may also be used to generate hydrogen (at best, an additional 2mol of hydrogen per mole of glucose). It is obvious that decreasing the hydrogen partial pressure largely influences the process of fermentation. In this study, a unidirectional gas collection container with a negative pressure of 0.5–0.7m water column was adopted to collect biogas whilst keeping the hydrogen partial pressure in the bioreactor as low as possible. Hydrogen production by fermentation has been widely studied [8–11]. The low theoretical energy efficiency of about 33.5% (C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CO2 +2CH3COOH) is the main bottleneck in hydrogen production by fermentation which greatly limits its development and industrial application. How to increase energy conversion efficiency in the hydrogen production process is a key and difficult problem. Our previous studies indicated that the residual solutions derived from hydrogen production are volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols, which can be continually used in producing methane. Thus, we proposed a novel two-phase anaerobic process cogenerating hydrogen and methane (C6H12O6 +2H2O→4H2 +2CH4 +4CO2) to solve the low energy efficiency problems of hydrogen fermentation. This is an ideal technique to utilize waste, and can continually reduce the quantity of organic compound in the waste and produce hydrogen and methane, which largely improves the energy efficiency to about 89% for the whole process [12]. In this paper, a two-phase cogeneration of hydrogen and methane from glucose in a 4-l bioreactor was studied. The operation conditions such as substrate concentration, weight ratio of inoculation to substrate, nutrient medium, and pH, which are the key factors that influence the hydrogen production process, were studied in this paper."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Hydrogen-producing bacteria,"2.1 Hydrogen-producing bacteria Activated sludge from marsh gas plant was boiled for 30min to inactivate methanogenic bacteria and harvest anaerobic spore-forming bacteria such as genera Bacillus and Clostridium [13]. Then, in order to inhibit the bacteria that use hydrogen, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria [14] and denitrifying bacteria [15], the boiled sludge was domesticated in a nutrient medium which contained trypticase, vitamin liquid and microelement liquid. One liter of the vitamin liquid contained the following: glutamic acid, 0.01g; ascorbic acid, 0.025g; riboflavin, 0.025g; citric acid monohydrate, 0.02g; folic acid, 0.01g; p-aminobonzoic acid, 0.01g; and creatine, 0.025g. One liter of the microelement liquid contained: MnCl2, 0.01g; ZnCl2, 0.05g; H3BO3, 0.01g; CaCl2, 0.01g; Na2MoO4, 0.01g; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.2g; AlK(SO4)2, 0.01g; and NiCl2·6H2O, 0.01g [12]. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of the inoculation was 3.5% determined according to the standard methods [16]."
3,Methanogenic bacteria,"2.2 Methanogenic bacteria Activated sludge from marsh gas plant enriched by the substrate was used as methanogenic bacteria. The substrate contained (g/l): nitrilotriacetic acid, 10; trypticase, 2; yeast extracts, 2; L-cysteine, 0.5; MgCl2, 0.1; K2HPO4, 0.4; vitamin liquid, 10ml; microelement liquid, 10ml; and resazurin (0.2%), 2ml. The vitamin liquid and the microelement liquid used for methane production were the same as those used in the substrate of the hydrogen-producing bacteria."
4,Experimental design,"2.3 Experimental design The main reactor of the experiment was a 5-l bioreactor with a leavening volume of 4l in which temperature, rotation speed and pH value were controlled at 35±1°C, 120r/min and 6, respectively. Nitrogen gas was introduced into the reactor for 20min before fermentation. A unidirectional gas collection container with a negative pressure of 0.5–0.7m water column was used to decrease the hydrogen partial pressure in case the hydrogen was used by other bacteria. The experimental scheme is shown in Table 1 . The influence on hydrogen production of substrate concentration, weight ratio of inoculation to substrate, pH value and nutrient medium (nitrogen source, vitamin liquid, and microelement liquid) was studied to explore the maximum hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate. Methane was produced from the residual solutions derived from hydrogen production. The energy efficiency of the combined process was calculated."
5,Analytical methods,"2.4 Analytical methods Hydrogen and methane were determined by a gas chromatograph (GC) (SP-3400, China, 5A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The operation temperatures of the injection port, oven, and detector were 50, 50, and 100°C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The concentrations of the VFAs were determined using a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 2m glass column packed with Unisole F-200 (30/60 mesh). The operation temperatures for the injection port, oven, and FID were 200, 240, and 280°C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30ml/min. The specific hydrogen/methane yield (mol/molglucose) was calculated by dividing hydrogen/methane production (mol) by initial glucose (mol). The maximum hydrogen/methane production rate (ml/ld) was the maximum data recorded each day."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Results of hydrogen production from glucose,"3.1 Results of hydrogen production from glucose 3.1.1 Effect of substrate concentration (SC) on hydrogen production The results show that the initial concentration is one of the key factors that influence hydrogen production. In the experiments, four glucose concentration levels of 1% (40gglucose in a 4-l bioreactor), 2%, 5%, and 10% were investigated. As shown in Fig. 1(a), 1% is the optimal initial concentration under the same conditions. For example, with the same inoculation of 40ml of hydrogen production bacteria, the hydrogen yields are 1%>2%>5% and a similar result of 1%>5%>10% is found when the weight ratio of inoculation and glucose is 1:1. It could be concluded that the specific hydrogen yield (molH2/molglucose) is in inverse proportion to the input concentration, ranging from 1% to 10%. This is similar to the finding by Shin et al. that hydrogen yield peaked at a glucose concentration of 0.6% [17]. This result may be due to the excessive substrate concentration, resulting in an accumulation of VFAs, a fall in pH, and an increase in the partial hydrogen pressure, in which case the microflora would inhibit hydrogen production [18]. Yet the hydrogen production rate (mlH2/ld) is in proportion to the input concentration. As shown in Fig. 1(b), a maximum specific hydrogen production rate of 5.92lH2/ld is obtained when the initial concentration is 10%. Thus, a high glucose concentration is more available in continuous industrial operation. 3.1.2 Effect of weight ratio of inoculation to substrate (I/S) on hydrogen production The weight ratio of inoculation to substrate also clearly influences the production of hydrogen in respect of both the specific hydrogen yield (molH2/molglucose) and the specific hydrogen producing rate (lH2/ld). The specific hydrogen yield (molH2/molglucose) increases from 2.20 to 2.75 (as shown in Fig. 1(a)) and the specific hydrogen producing rate also increases rapidly (as shown in Fig. 1(b)) when the weight ratio of inoculation to substrate increases from 1:1 to 2:1 with an initial concentration of 1%. Group #4 (as shown in Fig. 1(c)), in which the initial weight ratio of inoculation to substrate is 1:5, shows a similar result. In this group, when another 200ml inoculation was added into the bioreactor on day 68 when it stopped producing hydrogen, another peak appeared and the final specific hydrogen yield was more than for the other two groups in which the weight ratio of inoculation to substrate was 1:2. The obtained maximum specific hydrogen yield of 2.75molH2/molglucose is 68.8% of the theoretical yield. It is uneconomical to improve the hydrogen yield by further increasing the weight ratio of inoculation to substrate, but it is economical to do so by decreasing the pressure of H2 as much as possible. So 2:1 is the optimal weight ratio of inoculation to substrate. 3.1.3 Effect of nutrient medium on hydrogen production When glucose is used as the sole carbon source, the hydrogen production rate is influenced greatly by the reduction in the amount of hydrogen-producing bacteria due to the lack of a nitrogen source. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a comparison of group #1 with group #5 clearly indicates that the fermentation period can be shortened from 13 days to 4 days by adding a nutrient medium which includes a nitrogen source, 4g; vitamin liquid, 4ml; and microelement liquid, 4ml, into 40ml of hydrogen-producing bacteria. However, the specific hydrogen yields of these two groups (2.2 and 2.1mol H2/molglucose, respectively) are mainly influenced by the initial concentration of glucose and the weight ratio of inoculation to substrate rather than by the nutrient medium. 3.1.4 Effect of pH on hydrogen production Most researchers have studied the effects of pH values above 4 [6,19]. We set up a group of experiments to study the exact pH value under which the hydrogen production process is fully restrained. Fig. 2 illustrates that the pH value decreases rapidly from 6 to 4 due to the accumulation of fatty acids during the hydrolysis phase of fermentation. The process of hydrogen production is absolutely restrained when pH decreases below 3.19. This pH value is much lower than when pure bacteria are used as inoculum as reported by Oh et al., who observed no H2 production activity at pH 4.0 [20]. This means that mixed cultures have a stronger antacid capability than pure bacteria, and thus are more suitable for hydrogen fermentation. Hydrogen production continues to be restrained during the following 4 days when the pH value is controlled at 4.5. When the pH value is kept at 6 another peak appears, and as shown in Fig. 1(a), the specific hydrogen yield (molH2/molglucose) increases from 0.25 to 0.87. However, this is still much less than the 1.15molH2/molglucose obtained from the control group with the pH value controlled at 6."
8,Results of combined methane production,"3.2 Results of combined methane production In the methane production phase, the residual solutions derived from hydrogen production were used as substrate. The quantity of methane production bacteria inoculated was equal to the quantity of initial glucose that was added in the hydrogen production phase. The initial pH value was adjusted to 8 and the temperature was controlled at 35°C. The liquid analysis results are shown in Fig. 3 . The residual solutions derived from hydrogen production mainly contain ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and a little propionic acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid. No glucose was detected. The utilization rate of VFAs during the methane production phase is shown in Table 2 . The utilization rates of ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid are all above 90%, especially for ethanol, which is completely degraded. However, the utilization of propionic acid is unstable, although its production can almost be omitted. As shown in Fig. 4 , the specific methane yields of each group are 1.34, 1.04, 1.15, 1.91, 2.03, 2.13, 1.81 and 1.95molCH4/molglucose, respectively. The group with the highest specific methane yield (2.13molCH4/molglucose) also obtains the maximum specific hydrogen yield (2.75molH2/molglucose). The specific hydrogen yield is in proportion to the VFAs that were produced in the hydrogen production phase, especially the content of acetic acid and butyric acid. The specific methane yield is in proportion to the utilization rate of VFAs."
9,Energy efficiency,"3.3 Energy efficiency The results of the cogeneration of hydrogen and methane, the energy efficiency of hydrogen production and the energy efficiency of the cogeneration process are shown in Table 3 . The energy efficiency of hydrogen production is calculated by dividing the heat value of hydrogen yield by the heat value of glucose. The energy efficiency of the cogeneration process is calculated by dividing the heat value of hydrogen and methane yield by the heat value of glucose. In which, the heat value of glucose, hydrogen, and methane is 2888, 242, and 801kJ/mol, respectively. The energy efficiency of hydrogen production is relatively lower due to the low heat value of hydrogen with mole as unit. Energy efficiency can be improved from about 23% (in the hydrogen production process) to 82% when the cogeneration process is adopted. This result is 37% higher than that of a cogeneration of H2 and CH4 process from potatoes (about 60%) [12], which indicates that the process of degrading from potatoes to glucose is a main limiting factor for hydrogen production. Although the energy efficiency of this study (82%) is close to the theoretical value (89%), the ratio of specific H2 yield to specific CH4 yield is only 2.75/2.13=1.29, which leaves much room for development when compared with the theoretical value (2:1). The lower hydrogen yield is a major bottleneck of the cogeneration process that must be improved to enable commercial advancement. It is reported that the H2 yield can increase to 3.4mol/molglucose through the mutagenesis of Enterobacter cloacae by blocking its alcohol and acid formation pathways [21]. Modifications of the fermentation process by maintaining a low partial pressure of hydrogen [22,23] to make the reaction thermodynamically favorable, efficient product removal, optimum bioreactor design [24,25] and integrating the fermentative process with that of photosynthesis [26] are some of the other methods that can be adopted to improve hydrogen productivity [27]."
10,Conclusions,"Cogeneration of hydrogen and methane from glucose by two-phase anaerobic fermentation is feasible and can increase energy efficiency from 23% (hydrogen only production) to 82%. The cogeneration of hydrogen (2.75molH2/molglucose) and methane (2.13molCH4/molglucose) is achieved in this study. In the hydrogen production phase, the maximum specific hydrogen yield is 2.75molH2/molglucose when the initial glucose concentration is 1%, the weight ratio of inoculation to substrate is 2:1 and the pH value is 6. The liquid analysis results show that the main constituent of the VFAs was acetic acid, and therefore the hydrogen partial pressure can be decreased efficiently by using the unidirectional gas collection container with a negative pressure of 0.5–0.7m water column. The residual solutions derived from hydrogen production were reused to produce methane by methanogen in another reactor. The maximum specific methane yield is 2.13molCH4/molglucose when the reutilization rates of ethanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, and caproic acid are all above 90%. It has therefore been shown that the cogeneration process has good potential for application when glucose is used as the model compound. Whether it is applicable to other cases (such as the production of bioenergy from waste water, straw or food waste) merits further study."
