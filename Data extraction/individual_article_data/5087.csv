0,Introduction,"Understanding and controlling the near-surface environment is of critical importance in the field of catalysis. One recently developed strategy involves the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to tune the surface chemistry of catalysts [1,2]. Self-assembled monolayers and similar modifiers have gained recent interest because of their enhancement of catalytic selectivity and activity [3–7]. Recent studies have sought to extend these SAM strategies to metal oxide catalysts and supports using silane [8] and phosphonate modifiers [9,10]. However, these efforts focused only on Al2O3 and TiO2. Phosphonic acids have been shown to form SAMs on a wide variety of metal oxides, providing potential opportunities to expand this SAM strategy to a broad set of reaction chemistries. In this work, we explored the effect of phosphonate SAMs on the reactivity of alcohols on a wide variety of metal oxide catalysts functionalized with alkyl phosphonic acids. We found that phosphonates were able to form organized and robust SAMs on many metal oxides. Activity toward decomposition of linear alcohols was promoted on anatase phase TiO2, SnO2 and CeO2, but not other oxides. In fact, most oxides demonstrated a significant reduction in catalytic activity for all reaction pathways. Through correlations with bulk properties, we propose that phosphonates acted as surface level dopants, tuning the activity of alcohol dehydration, for a specific set of oxides."

3,Catalyst characterization,"2.2 Catalyst characterization Atmospheric diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed on a Praying Mantis system (Harrick Scientific). Reported DRIFTS results represent the raw spectra, and are not normalized between samples. Surface area measurements were performed using nitrogen physisorption (30% nitrogen, balance helium, Airgas), unless surface areas were reported by the manufacturer. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to measure phosphorous and cation content of native and functionalized materials. Temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) were performed using a custom quartz tube (6.35-mm inner diameter) vapor phase reactor. The effluent was monitored with a Pfeiffer mass spectrometer. For TPD experiments, functionalized catalysts were sandwiched between two 125 mg slugs of quartz wool with either ultra-high purity (UHP) helium (Airgas), or 7 torr water vapor in UHP helium as a carrier gas. Temperature programmed desorption started at 100 °C and ended at 550 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. For TPRS experiments, catalysts were sandwiched between 125 mg of quartz wool and pretreated in UHP helium for 1 h at 250 °C. After pretreatment, samples were cooled to 50 °C, then saturated with 1-butanol vapor in UHP helium for 10 min. The system was then purged for 25 min before beginning the 20 °C/min ramp rate to 550 °C."
4,Catalyst performance,"2.3 Catalyst performance Reactions of 1-butanol were conducted on a custom pyrex-tube (6.35-mm inner diameter) packed bed vapor phase reactor with an Agilent gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity and flame-ionization detector measuring effluent concentrations of reactants and products. A DB-WAX (30 m x 0.250 mm x 0.50 μm) column was used to separate components. The reactant, 1-butanol (≥99%, for molecular biology, Sigma-Aldrich), was delivered to the catalyst by bubbling an inert carrier (helium, ultra high purity, Airgas) through the liquid phase reactant, which was temperature controlled with a water bath set to 14 °C. Reactions were performed at 250 °C with data reported for data acquired from 180 to 210 min (time-on-stream) then averaged with two other sample replicates. Experimental uncertainty is represented as the standard error from triplicate samples."
5,Results,
6,Catalyst characterization,"3.1 Catalyst characterization Metal oxide powders (Table 1 ) were functionalized with octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) and methylphosphonic acid (MPA). Here, we used ODPA modification as a method to test whether relatively close-packed monolayers were formed on the various surfaces. Functionalization of materials with long-chain alkyl SAMs like ODPA can be thoroughly studied and the organization of these SAMs is often characterized using asymmetric and symmetric vibrational modes of methylene functionalities [10]. The frequencies for these vibrations redshift as the SAM molecules become more organized. Fig. 1 shows the infrared spectra of the ODPA-functionalized metal oxides. All modified oxides studied here demonstrated an asymmetric methylene vibrational frequency typical of organized SAMs. Organization does appear to depend to some extent on the metal oxide; while many metal oxides have clear peaks at 2920 cm−1 or lower, V2O5, ZrO2, TiO2 rutile showed more blue-shifted peaks associated with decreased organization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the functionalization of CeO2, CuO, MgO, SnO2, and V2O5 with phosphonic acids. Functionalization of Al2O3 [11–13], Fe2O3 [14], TiO2 [11–13,15], WO3 [16], ZrO2 [11,12,17], and ZnO [18–21] has been reported previously, however. An important criterion for the use of SAM-modified catalysts is that the coating must remain stable at reaction temperatures of interest. Few studies have focused on the thermal stability of phosphonic acid functionalized metal oxides with a couple exceptions [13,22]. McElwee et al. utilized thermogravimetric analysis to demonstrate no degradation of ODPA-functionalized γ-Al2O3 and TiO2-anatase powders below 430 °C. Bhairamadgi et al. noted no degradation of ODPA-functionalized porous alumina below 500 °C. We expanded the range of oxides investigated and explored the stability of ODPA functionalized γ-Al2O3, TiO2-anatase, ZrO2, and ZnO using DRIFTS of the CH stretching region (Supplementary information, Fig. S1) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) (Supplementary information, Fig. S2). Temperature programmed desorption in helium and 1% water vapor in helium demonstrated no production of volatile decomposition products below 400 °C. We also investigated the organization of the ODPA tail functionality using temperature- and atmosphere-controlled DRIFTS. In a helium atmosphere, little degradation of asymmetric or symmetric methylene vibrations was measured after heating the sample to ∼400 °C and returning to ambient conditions. These results were in line with previous studies of reactions of alcohols on phosphonic acid functionalized TiO2- and Al2O3-based catalysts, which showed no loss of functionality after exposure to reaction conditions. [9,23,24] We noted that there were subtle shifts in peak frequency and intensity after the thermal treatment; as shown in Fig. S1, for example, the peak intensity for methylene stretching in some cases increased after heating. Such changes have previously been interpreted in terms of reorganization of the monolayers to adopt different orientations (e.g., with different degrees of tilt) during annealing [25]. Though these SAMs were found to be stable to 400 °C in inert environments and in the presence of low levels of water vapor, it should be noted that harsher (especially oxidizing) conditions may lead to degradation. Although the DRIFTS results are generally consistent with a relatively complete monolayer, some coverage variations between the different oxides are expected. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques have been used to estimate the coverage of several phosphonic acids on Al2O3 to be approximately 3–4 molecules nm−2, and analysis of benzyl phosphonic acids on TiO2 have indicated a similar coverage [9,13,24]. Attempts to accurately measure coverage changes across different oxides with ICP in this study were hampered by the low surface areas of many of the tested materials. In addition to the possibility of changes in surface coverage, it is important to note that different oxides have been reported to yield different modes of phosphonate attachment [17]."
7,Catalyst performance,"3.2 Catalyst performance Previously, we demonstrated that there was a weak inverse dependence of alkyl tail length and dehydration activity, where shorter chain lengths (e.g., methyl) led to higher dehydration activity compared with decylphosphonic- and ODPA-functionalized TiO2 [9]. With these findings in mind, we sought to determine which oxides demonstrated maximal dehydration activity, by focusing on MPA functionalized materials. Metal oxide powders functionalized with MPA were compared to their native counterparts in the vapor-phase decomposition of 1-butanol at 250 °C using a helium gas carrier. Primary alcohols are known to react via dehydration, dehydrogenation, and condensation on metal oxides. Condensation is often a minor pathway, with selectivities typically below 15%. However, γ-Al2O3 is a notable exception to this trend, since the ether made up nearly 60% of the products at these reaction conditions, as expected [26]. After functionalization with MPA, significant selectivity changes (>15%) occurred for five materials: γ-Al2O3, TiO2-anatase, CeO2, V2O5, and SnO2 (Fig. 2 ). The greatest changes (>30%) occurred for γ-Al2O3, TiO2-anatase, and SnO2. Anatase-phase TiO2 and SnO2 demonstrated increases in dehydration selectivity (>50%) and decreases in dehydrogenation selectivity (>50%), while γ-Al2O3 exhibited decreases in condensation (>30%) and increases in dehydration (>30%). Ceria and V2O5 also saw a respective 13.6% and 20.5% decrease in dehydrogenation selectivity and 15.6% and 17.1% increase in dehydration selectivity, with a difference between these pathways coming from a change in condensation selectivity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary information Fig. S3). All other oxides showed little to no change in reaction selectivity beyond experimental error. The selectivity trends showed that γ-Al2O3, TiO2-anatase, V2O5, SnO2 and CeO2 were outliers in performance after functionalization with MPA. However, upon closer examination of reaction rates, a new and more surprising trend emerged (Fig. 3 ). Gamma-alumina demonstrated a decrease in activity for dehydration, dehydrogenation, and condensation. In fact, activities for all pathways decreased by nearly 99%, indicating that the phosphonates were highly effective surface poisons. Activity for each pathway also decreased for coated V2O5, but to a lesser extent. For CeO2, SnO2, and TiO2-anatase, dehydration activity increased, while dehydrogenation and condensation activity decreased. In fact, dehydration activity increased by 110%, 210% and 810% while dehydrogenation activity decreased by 26%, 92% and 99% for CeO2, TiO2-anatase, and SnO2, respectively. Because of the high selectivity to the dehydrogenation product for uncoated CeO2 and SnO2, the significant increase in dehydration rates was not accompanied by high selectivities. For example, native SnO2 had a 99.7% selectivity toward the dehydrogenation product; modification with MPA therefore only improved the dehydration selectivity to approximately 50%. Overall, these results raised two questions: (1) Why is the dehydration pathway promoted while dehydrogenation and condensation decrease in activity? and (2) What oxide properties are associated with an increase in dehydration activity after MPA functionalization?"
8,Influence of phosphonates on surface chemistry,"3.3 Influence of phosphonates on surface chemistry Previous studies of reactions of 1-propanol on anatase TiO2 demonstrated a 13 kJ/mol decrease in the apparent activation energy for dehydration and a 42 kJ/mol increase for dehydrogenation for the MPA functionalized material [9]. This suggested a significant shift in the energetic landscape of the dehydrogenation mechanism with a moderate shift in the dehydration mechanism. Dehydrogenation is thought to require two Lewis acid sites, the first capable of binding the alcohol and the second abstracting a hydride alpha to the alcohol carbon [27–29]. The functionalization with phosphonic acids would be expected to reduce the number of two adjacent Lewis acids, thus lowering selectivity to dehydrogenation. The argument is similar for condensation, a bimolecular reaction. For condensation to occur two alcohols must adsorb near to one another; having a high concentration of phosphonic acids on the surface likely reduces the probability for such an occurrence. The phosphonic acid surface coverage was consistent with the decrease in dehydrogenation and condensation activity, but did not explain the varying response in dehydration activity. More explicitly, dehydration activity appeared to have no correlation with surface coverage. Using temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) (Supplementary information Figs. S4–S5) we noted a significant reduction in the total adsorption of alcohols on all materials, again, consistent with high surface coverage of phosphonic acids. Moreover, the available alcohol binding sites appeared to have comparable adsorption strength to the native counterpart. It therefore appears the phosphonic acids must increase intrinsic activity of the remaining sites for dehydration, but only for specific oxides. We sought to explain this result by correlations to bulk material properties."
9,Discussion,"It is useful to consider results from previous studies that have sought to identify the relationship between metal oxide properties and reaction performance. Previous studies have provided an in-depth analysis of metal oxide properties as they impact dehydrogenation activity of simple alcohols like ethanol [30,31]. Idriss et al. investigated correlations of dehydrogenation activity with bulk metal oxide properties such as electronegativity difference between the metal and oxygen, metal oxygen bond strength, oxygen partial charge, oxygen Madelung potential, and oxygen electronic polarizability, and concluded that the oxygen electronic polarizability was the best predictor for dehydrogenation activity. We sought to utilize similar material properties: differences in electronegativity between the metal and oxide, polarizability of the cation, polarizability of the oxide, band gap, and metal oxygen bond strength, as possible descriptors for the change in dehydration activity of these materials after functionalization with phosphonic acid modifiers. Differences in metal oxide electronegativities and polarizability of the cation and oxide did not demonstrate a significant correlation (Supplementary information, Figs. S6–S9). Use of the metal-oxygen bond strength as a descriptor resulted in a “volcano” type relationship (Fig. 4 ), with strong and weak metal oxygen bond strengths having the most suppression in dehydration activity after functionalization with phosphonic acids, while moderate metal-oxygen bond strength materials had improved activity levels. The use of metal-oxygen bond strength as a predictor does have a connection to the mechanism of dehydration, since metal-oxygen bond cleavage is thought to occur during the E2-like surface mediated reaction [32,33]. As discussed in more detail below, there are a few key outliers in this relationship, suggesting that other factors likely play a role in dictating how phosphonate dopants influence catalysis. The complex response of dehydration activity and functionalization with phosphonic acids appears to be correlated with electron mobility and energetics. Though phosphonic acids have not be used for this express purpose (i.e., tuning catalytic properties of surface atoms), phosphonic acids have been understood to tune the work function of electronic materials like zinc oxide [19,20] and indium tin oxide [35–38]. Metiu et al. [39] demonstrated that surface-level cation exchange in metal oxides can provide a means to control Lewis acid and base properties. For example, by replacing a surface level cation with one of higher valance, the surface can become more of a Lewis base, hypothetically enhancing activity toward elimination of the beta hydrogen of the alcohol [32]. This newly doped surface will result in stronger binding of Lewis acids, but weaker binding of Lewis bases. Interestingly, this type of analysis of our materials highlights one critical common factor among the three oxides, CeO2, SnO2, and TiO2: all oxides have the same bulk metal oxidation state. Binding of the phosphonic acids on the surface of these oxides could be seen as a type of surface doping with phosphorous being the cation of higher oxidation state. With this hypothesis in mind, according the rules developed by Metiu et al., phosphorous would act as a high valence dopant, resulting in a surface with weaker binding to Lewis bases. Since alcohols are Lewis bases, this hypothesis suggests a significant weakening in the adsorption energy of alcohols. Unfortunately, attempts to investigate surface acidity using ammonia TPD were complicated by very low yields observed (Supplementary information Table S1); we also were unable to resolve trends in surface hydroxyl stretching modes on the various oxides (Supplementary information Fig. S10). One obvious outlier in our trends is the comparison of anatase and rutile phase TiO2. Rutile demonstrated a decrease in dehydration activity of 69% while anatase phase TiO2 demonstrated an increase of over 200%. Though these two materials appear to share many similar qualities, there is precedent for significant variation in catalytic activity of these materials related to electronic structure differences, as well as major differences in the interaction of surface dopants. [40,41]"
10,Conclusions,"Phosphonic acid monolayers are capable of forming robust monolayers on many different metal oxide powders. However, the change in catalytic activity, specifically for alcohol dehydration, was limited to TiO2-anatase, CeO2 and SnO2. We speculate the reason is due to electronic doping by the phosphonic acid monolayers. The bulk properties that seem important to this process relate to metal-oxygen bond strength of a certain range and oxidation state. Clearly more studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanistic understanding of this phenomena, but this study does highlight the use phosphonic acid monolayers as robust dopants for certain thermochemical conversions of oxygenates by metal oxide catalysts."
