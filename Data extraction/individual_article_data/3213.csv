0,Introduction,"Interest in developing hydrogen (H2) energy based economy is on rise to counter the extensive reliance on the depleting fossil fuels [1]. H2, as an energy carrier with a high calorific value of 122kJg−1 (2.75 times greater than hydrocarbon fuels) is clean and renewable [2]. Contrast to hydrocarbon fuels, the byproduct of H2 combustion is just water vapor. Such an economy needs to have an efficient process to produce H2 by an economical and renewable route. Recently, hydrogen production from biological products using photosynthesis has received great attention. Photosynthetic process in the presence of natural sources such as water, air, carbon dioxide and sunlight is cheap and renewable [3–7]. Various biomimetic approaches to artificial photosynthetic systems were designed for the photo catalytic oxidation of water to produce hydrogen [8]. However, currently the main production of hydrogen comes from steam reforming of natural gas, consuming natural resources and generating carbon dioxide as an undesired byproduct [9,10]. Central to the success of hydrogen technology is the efficient generation of hydrogen from a renewable energy source such as solar-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting [11]. Such photo-generated H2 combines the advantages of hydrocarbons with that of solar energy. The design of efficient PEC electrode including suitable photoanode and cathode materials for the harvest of solar energy has become one of the foremost challenges in the development of solar H2 economy [12–16]. In particular, effectiveness and stability of photoanodes are the key factors for H2 generation using a PEC cell. Artificial photosynthetic metal catalysts were also employed for photoanodes in PEC water splitting, such as TiO2, SnO2, WO3, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, Fe2O3 and ZnO [17–22]. Among them, the TiO2 is the most promising materials due to the powerful oxidation properties, superior charge transport properties and chemical and optical stability. It attracted considerable research interest since after the first report on H2 production from the flame synthesis of TiO2 in 1972 by Fujishima and Honda [23]. A suitable material system should satisfy criteria such that the appropriate band gap and flat-band potential, low electrical resistance, and good corrosion resistance in aqueous electrolyte [24–26] for efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion. TiO2 of different shapes and morphologies offering advantages over their bulk counterparts as photoanode materials due to their large surface area, short lateral diffusion length and low reflectivity [27] have been studied. TiO2 have large band gap energies (3.0 and 3.2eV for rutile and anatase, respectively), leading to inadequate light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, which imposes a basic limitation on the overall photo-to-hydrogen efficiency. Many efforts have been used to increase the optical absorption of TiO2 by varying the chemical composition with metal or non-metal doping or self-impurity. In the recent past, Nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) nanoparticle synthesized and proved that they were photocatalytically active in the visible region [28]. The highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs) and double wall nitrogen-doped nanotube array electrodes have proven high surface area [29,30] and it implies a good photoconversion efficiency. A novel rice grain-like TiO2 nanostructures produced by the electrospinning is reported by our group [31,32], and suggest that these nano structures have a higher surface area (∼70m2/g) and proven better performance for dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis applications. Our motivation for studies is that the higher surface area can enhance the photoconversion efficiency, which is increased about ∼14m2/g compared with commercial TiO2 particles of Degussa P25 (∼56m2/g) [33]. This paper, we prepared N-TiO2 rice grain-like structures for PEC water splitting. TiO2 is a direct band gap semiconductor with an absorption edge at 380nm, and the introduction of N in the crystal lattice of TiO2 will result in intermediate energy levels in the band gap and reduce the absorption energy. Earlier studies of N-doped TiO2 (n-type) materials have shown a significant improvement in the visible light PEC H2 production [34]. Our interest here is to investigate this novel nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanostructure as a material for efficient PEC hydrogen production."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials and methods,"2.1 Materials and methods Poly (vinylacetate) (PVAc, M w =1.0×106), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TiP, 97%) (TiP), N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc, anhydrous 99.8%), and urea were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and used as received. Acetic acid (99.7%) was obtained from LAB-SCAN Analytical Sciences, Thailand. A mixture of urea and titanium (IV) isopropoxide was used as nitrogen and TiO2 precursors, respectively. About 2.4g of PVAc was added to 20mL DMAc solution and stirred for about 12h at room temperature is followed by the addition of 4mL of acetic acid and 2mL of TiP under stirring, respectively. Required amounts of urea was added to the above solution and kept for stirring about 12h to get homogenous solution. The transparent pale yellow solution thus obtained was taken in a 10mL syringe and subjected to electrospinning using a 27 G1/2 gauge needle with a flow rate of 1mL/h. The detailed procedure for producing nanofibers by electrospinning has reported previously [35–39]. The distance and applied electrostatic field between the needle and counter electrode (rotating drum) were maintained at 10cm and 30kV, respectively. As the polymer jet travels toward the counter electrode, the jet splits further into several fine strands due to mutual repulsion. Then the jet solidifies and gets collected in the form of nanofibers on the substrate (aluminum foil). The as-spun fibers were collected from the aluminum foil which is wrapped with an rotating drum. FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) conducting glass (2cm×2cm) was ultrasonically cleaned with water and ethanol and finally with isopropyl alcohol. A 2nm TiO2 layer was deposited using ALD (atomic-layer deposition). Atomic-layer controlled films were obtained from alternate exposures of the substrate to vapors of two precursors, TiCl4 (Merck, ≥99%) and deionized H2O, at 170°C. These glass plates were fixed on top of aluminum foil over rotating drum. The fibers were collected on the FTO plates and aluminum foil as well. The as-spun fibers get collected as a freestanding membrane and prior to spinning some portion of the FTO glass plate were masked to have electrical contact points through. Nanofibers on FTO plate and membranes from aluminum foil were sintered at 450°C for 1h (in air) with 5°C/min ramp rate to remove out the polymer and also to obtain the anatase TiO2 phase. The continuous fiber structure breaks down into rice grain structures during this sintering process and the sintered material was characterized by spectroscopy and microscopy as described below. The nanofiber-coated FTO plates were used further in electrochemical characterization. The amount of N precursor in the electrospinning solution was varied (3 and 5% (w/w)) to have different N concentration in TiO2."
3,Photoelectrochemical study,"2.2 Photoelectrochemical study Fig. 1 shows the photograph of a typical N-TiO2 photocatalyst coated 2nm TiO2/FTO plate. Photocurrent was measured in a standard three-electrode configuration controlled by a Potentiostat/Galvanostat (273A EG & G Princeton Applied Research) was used. N-TiO2/FTO as working electrode, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as reference electrode, and platinum mesh as counter electrode, respectively. A potentiostat was used to measure and control the photocurrent and the applied potentials of the cell. The working electrode surface was illuminated with an oriel 150W Xenon lamp solar light simulator with an approximate 1.3sun due to the AM1.5G filter installed (i.e. 100mW/cm2). The TiO2 nanostructure coated FTO plates were suspended in 0.5M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature."
4,Results and discussion,"The morphology of the nanostructures was observed in a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). For a typical SEM sampling, nearly 1mg of the sample was mounted on an SEM sample holder and 5–10nm thick platinum was sputtered prior to analysis for better conductivity of the sample. Fig. 2(a) shows the FE-SEM image for the as-spun nanofibers of TiO2, as one can see from the figure, the fibers are continues and uniformly distributed throughout the specific area. The diameters of fibers are in the range of approximately 90–120nm (std.dev: 30nm). Upon sintering, the continuous fibers break up results in the formation of rice grain shaped nanostructures as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c) with 3 and 5% (w/w) of N-doping levels, respectively. The dimensions of the N-TiO2 nanostructures calculated using the Image Tool 3.0 software are of length of approximately 0.8–1.2μm and diameters ranging from ∼60 to 80nm (std.dev: 15nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Hitachi H8100 machine to study the size, shape and crystallinity of the material. The typical TEM sample is prepared as follows: 10mg of rice grain shaped N-TiO2 was dispersed in 10mL of methanol and sonicated for about 1h to achieve a homogeneous white suspension. One or 2 drops of this solution was dropped on top of a carbon-coated TEM grid, and then subsequently dried in vacuum for about 10min. The sample was observed under a TEM, is shown in Fig. 2(d) for 5% of N-doped TiO2. As could be seen from the TEM image, the rice grain-like nanostructures were made up of spherical particles of approximately 12–20nm diameters. The presence of N did not create any significant change in the morphology. The lattice-resolved image shown in Fig. 2(e) further substantiates the anatase nature of TiO2 with the lattice spacing of 0.35nm corresponding to the most prominent (101) plane. The crystal structure of materials was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα (1.5406Å) radiation. The XRD pattern of TiO2 and N-TiO2 with 5% (w/w) of N is shown in Fig. 3(a). XRD analysis revealed that the pure TiO2 (0% of N) and the N-TiO2 consist of a mixture of mostly anatase and a negligible quantity of rutile phase. The crystallinity of the TiO2 does not change with the doping of N and the crystallite sizes (D = Kλ/(β cos θ)) and d-spacing (3.52Å) of the nanostructures were calculated to be 18, 14.4, and 12.2nm for 0, 3 and 5 wt% compositions of N, respectively. As there is no change in the d-space value at anatase (101) plane, this indicates that the N has been introduced into the lattice without changing the dimension of the unit cell. Raman spectra acquired using a high-resolution microscope (JY LabRam HR) at an excitation wavelength of 488nm is shown in Fig. 3(b). One can see from Fig. 3(b), the modes A1g (518.7cm−1), B1g (399.2, 519cm−1) and Eg (144.5, 197, 640cm−1) are the six Raman active modes for anatase which are consistent with literature [40]. However, we do not observe any Raman active modes for rutile phase for all the compositions of N in TiO2. The observed peak at 144.5cm−1 can be attributed to the characteristic anatase phase, which indicates that the anatase is the predominant phase structure. The high intensity Raman band at low frequency (144.5cm−1) of all N compositions shows that the peak intensities and widths are broadened after nitrogen doping which is shown in the inset-1 of Fig. 3(b). It is possible to determine the nanoparticle size since the particle size can cause large shifts in the location of the scattered confinement effect. This indicates that the crystallinity is enhanced and the particle size is decreased, which is consistent with the results of the XRD results. From the Fig. 3(b) inset-2 shows the low intensity peak at 327.04 which is attributed to the vibration of Ti–N bonds. The low frequency scattering around 200cm−1 is caused by acoustical phonons, while the high-frequency scattering around 527cm−1 is due to optical phonons. In general, the vibrational characteristic band of Ti–N can be clearly found in the Raman spectra, which indicates that nitrogen assuredly substitutes for some oxygen atoms in the titania lattice [41]. However, there is a peak shift toward lower frequencies shown in inset-1 in Fig. 2(b), can be attributed to the smaller size of the grains in TiO2. The low intensity peak observed from inset-3 in Fig. 3(b) is also attributed to the N-doping. The UV–vis absorbance of TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 with 3 and 5% of N were studied in the energy range 1.5–4.5eV. The TiO2 rice grain-like structures show an absorption threshold at less than 3.2eV. In general, the absorption coefficient for TiO2 is found to follow the relation [42]. (1) ( α h υ ) m = h υ − E g where α is the absorption coefficient, hυ is the photon energy, E g is the band gap energy, m =1/2 or 3/2 for indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions, and m =2 or 3 for direct allowed and direct forbidden transitions. The band gap energy was estimated by plotting (αhυ)2 of TiO2 against the photon energy (hυ), as shown in Fig. 4 . The band gap energy was determined by extrapolating the absorption coefficient (α) to hυ axis of the plot. The absorption (A) is converted to the absorption coefficient using the following relationship [43]: (2) α = ( 2.303 × 103 ) A ρ / l c where A is the absorption of the sample, ρ is the density of TiO2 (3.98g/cm3), l is the length (1cm), and c is the concentration of the TiO2 in aqueous methanol solution (∼31g/cm3). Band gap energy of 3.19eV was obtained for the pure TiO2 (0% of N-doping). The on-set band gaps are 3.19, 3.02, and 2.83eV for 0, 3, 5% (w/w), respectively. It is observed that with increasing nitrogen content, the band gap was narrowed. This narrowed band gap will facilitate excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in the doped oxide semiconductor under visible light illumination, which can result in higher photocatalytic activities. Moreover, this band gap narrowing probably involves color centers associated with oxygen vacancies created during the doping of TiO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the presence of N in the N-TiO2. The analysis of the sample was carried out using a VG ESCA 220i-XL Imaging XPS. The N-doped TiO2 samples were mounted onto a sample holder using a conductive Cu double-sided tape, and were loaded immediately into XPS system for analysis. The measurement was carried with standard software and methodology. The maximum analysis depth lay in the range of 4–8nm. Survey scans were acquired for elemental identification while high-resolution spectra were acquired for surface composition analysis. The survey spectrum is shown in Fig. 5(a), but we are unable to judge the doping level of N from the survey spectrum and hence, high-resolution spectra of the N 1s (∼400eV), and O 1s (∼530eV) was carried for different compositions of N-doped TiO2. However, one cannot observe any nitrogen peaks from Fig. 5(b) for the 0% of N-TiO2. Fig. 5(c) shows the N 1s for 5% of N-TiO2, the binding energy peak of observed at about 399.9eV which is consistent and is attributed due to substitutional N-doping [44–46]. Another peak at 400.6eV higher binding energies was detected and is consistent with literature [4,47,48]. From the Fig. 5(d), O1s can be seen and it will be useful in identifying core levels. An additional peak for N-TiO2 traced at about 531.3eV is attributed to the presence of Ti–O–N bonds [49–51]. This feature is due to the formation of oxidized Ti–N, which led to the Ti–O–N structure and coincides with the fact that the presence of oxidized nitrogen should appear at higher binding energy (≥400eV). Electrospun TiO2 nanostructures coated FTO glass plates were used to study photocatalytic degradation of MB. Visible light photocatalysis was carried out with Oriel 150 Watt solar simulator (USA). This visible light-assisted photocatalysis by N-TiO2 was performed for the MB dye degradation and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . Higher catalytic activity has observed for N-TiO2 compared to pure TiO2 and could be mainly due to the doping by N. The degradation and kinetic plots are presented in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. The degradation rate (C 0/C) of the MB dye with TiO2 and N-TiO2 after visible light irradiation for about 4h is 0.2×10−3 and 1.8×10−3 min−1, respectively, where C 0 is the initial concentration of the dye and C is the concentration at a time t. The first order rate constant k, derived from the plots is shown in Fig. 6(b), the values of which are shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b). The increased kinetic rate constants also confirm for the N-TiO2 showed an increased value and hence it is confirmed that the N-TiO2 has superior photocatalytic activity compared to the TiO2 rice grains. The dependence of the photocurrent as a function of applied potential for the samples is shown in Fig. 7 . The I–V characteristic of rice grain shaped nanostructures is presented in Fig. 7(a). The potential was swept linearly at a scan rate of 10mV/s between 0.2 and 1.5VAg/Agcl. In dark condition, typically all samples showed insignificant current of approximately 10−6 A/cm2, indicating the absence of any electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. Under illumination, at 1V, the current densities were 1.4, 0.6 and 0.2mA/cm2 for the 5%, 3% and 0% N-TiO2, respectively. As the potential rises, a steady current flow is seen under the visible light irradiation. It is seen that the current density is approximately 3 times higher for the 5% N-doped samples compared to 3% N and an order of magnitude higher when compared to TiO2. These results implied that the increased N-doping results in improved PEC hydrogen production by rice grain-like nanostructures. The intensity of the incidence light and the inner structure and surface area of the electrode remarkably affect the photocurrent. Once the light is switched on, the material can absorb the photons whose energies are equal or larger than the band gap which could produce photocurrent. Stronger the photocurrent, better the photocatalytic performance. The charge carriers for 3 and 5% of N-doping have improved the photocurrent activity notably and all these results are consistent with reported values [52]. Fig. 7(b), shows the Amperometric I − t measurements performed to examine the photoresponse of the samples over cycles of light on/off. As shown in Fig. 7(b), good photoresponses were recorded for all three samples under conditions of light on and light off, and this photocurrent pattern was reproducible for many on–off cycles. Ag/Agcl the photon-to-hydrogen efficiency was calculated via the following equation. PCE = ( η % ) = ( J p ( E rev ° − | E app | ) / I light ) × 100 where PCE (η%) is the photoconversion efficiency, J p is the photocurrent density (mA/cm2), I light is the incident light irradiance, E rev° is the standard reversible potential which is 1.23 V, and E app is the applied potential which is E app = E meas − E aoc, where E meas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode and E aoc is the open circuit electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under illumination. Plots of photoconversion efficiency vs. applied potential for 5, 3 and 0% N-TiO2 are shown in Fig. 8 . With N-doping, the photoanode delivered higher PCE. Five, 3 and 0% N-doped samples show a maximum efficiency of 0.8% and 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively at 1 V Ag/Agcl, respectively. The inset in figure shows in bar chart form the calculated volume of hydrogen produced based on faraday’s law of electrolysis. This amount determined is consistent with reported values in literature [53]."
5,Conclusions,"N-TiO2 rice grains like structures were prepared by electrospinning followed by the annealing at high temperatures. Band gap energy gets reduced with N-doping compared to the pure TiO2 nanostructures proven by the UV spectral analysis. This is resulted in their visible light-driven photocatalytic activity for PEC hydrogen production with improved performance by N content. The visible light-driven photocatalysis showing a first order kinetic behavior in degrading Methylene blue (MB) dye with a kinetics constant of 1.8×10−3 and 0.2×10−3 min−1 for 5 and 0% N-TiO2, respectively. The 10-fold improvement has found for PEC photoconversion efficiency from 0.09 to 0.8% for N-TiO2 as compared to the TiO2.Therefore, the superior hydrogen evolution capability of N-TiO2 promises application of these materials in PEC hydrogen production applications. Further, studies to improve the PEC performance by increasing the N-doping content and yet with maintaining the rice grain structures are being carried out."
