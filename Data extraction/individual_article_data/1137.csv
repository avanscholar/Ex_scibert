0,Introduction,"With the continuous consumption of fossil fuels, the energy crisis and environmental problems have become increasingly severe, making the urgent improvement of sustainable energy and protection of the environment [1–4]. The photocatalytic technology with semiconductor materials as the core can use solar energy to not only split water to produce green energy hydrogen, which can alleviate or partially solve the energy crisis [5,6], but also degrade NO or other pollutants to improve our environment effectively [7]. However, it is still a considerable challenge to find an efficient catalyst that can be used to both produce hydrogen from the “source control” method and treat NO from the “end-of-pipe treatment” approach. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), a catalyst consists of only isolated single atoms dispersed on a carrier, have recently become a new type of promising catalyst [8], which can maximize the use of active metal sites, and exhibit ultra-high activity in various reactions such as water gas conversion, dehydrogenation, and photocatalysis [9–12]. Most of the SACs obtained often via a series of methods such as atomic layer loading, defect engineering, and space constraints are easy to migrate and aggregate due to their higher surface energy, further resulting in low metal loading, which would limit their practical application to a certain extent [13]. In order to obtain highly dispersed single atoms, we choose metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as an ideal carrier, which can not only improve ultra-high load capacity but also avoid aggregation for the single atoms. MOFs are a novel type of porous organic–inorganic hybrid supramolecular materials with ultra-high surface areas [14] and abundant coordinated unsaturated sites [15]. Wang et al. selected NH2-UiO-66 as the substrate to obtain stable single-atom modified MOFs (Ru-NU) through a simple post-mixing method for photocatalytic NO oxidation [16]. Jiang et al. introduced single-atom Pt into the highly stable aluminum-based porphyrin MOFs (Al-TCPP) via the strong interaction of the pyrrole N atom in porphyrin rings to anchor the single-atom Pt for photocatalytic hydrogen production [17]. However, as far as we know, there is no report that MOFs-based SACs could both improve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic NO removal. As a natural photosynthetic center with a broad visible light-harvesting ability in green plants, especially it is accessible to implant single-atom in the center of the rigid skeleton, porphyrins are primarily served as the building blocks for various MOFs [18]. At the same time, Ti-oxo clusters occasionally have been employed as an alternative to the very famous TiO2 photocatalyst, and the transition-metal ion Ti4+ can not only form a highly stable framework with carboxylate, but also can be used as an active center for rapid electron transfer via Ti3+/Ti4+ process [19]. Therefore, it is very expected to fabricate porphyrins as the linkers with Ti-oxo clusters as the metal nodes as well as introduction of single-atom active sites into an integrated whole to construct highly efficient MOFs photocatalysts. In our work, through embedded PtII tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrins (PtTCPP) as the linking groups via the strong interaction between the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms in the rigid porphyrin framework to anchor a single-atom Pt and the Ti-oxo molecular clusters as the metal nodes, we firstly fabricated the robust and efficient TMF-Pt with uniformly distributed single-atom Pt to improve excellent hydrogen production (15456 µmol·g−1·h−1) and NO removal (70.3%) under visible light irradiation (Scheme 1 )."

3,Catalyst synthesis,"2.2 Catalyst synthesis 2.2.1 Synthesis of Platinum(II) tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin complex (PtTCPP): The Platinum(II) tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin complex (PtTCPP) was synthesized according to the previously reported procedure with slight modifications [20] (Scheme 2 ). (1) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin (TMCPP). ethyl 4-formylbenzoate (14.410 g, 0.086 mol) was completely dissolved in propionic acid (250 mL) in a 500 mL round-bottom flask, pyrrole (6.09 mL, 0.086 mol) dissolved in 20 mL propionic acid was added slowly, then the mixture was refluxed at 150 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained residue was washed with a large amount of ethanol, ethyl acetate and a small amount of THF, successively. The collected purple residue was dried at 70 °C for 12 h. (3.7 g, 4.3 mmol, yield 20%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 8.82 (s, 8H), 8.45 (d, 8H), 8.29 (d, 8H), 4.11 (s, 12H), −2.81 (s, 2H) (Scheme 3 ). (2) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin-Pt (PtTMCPP) PtCl2 (226 mg, 0.854 mmol) and TMCPP (362 mg, 0.427 mmol) were fully dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous benzonitrile, and refluxed for 36 h under N2 atmosphere. After removing the solvent, the obtained solid was purified by column chromatography using CH2Cl2/n-hexane as the eluent, and then the obtained solid was recrystallized with CH2Cl2/n-hexane to obtain PtTMCPP. (300 mg, 0.354 mmol, yield 41%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.72 (s, 8H), 8.43 (d, 8H), 8.23 (d, 8H), 4.10 (s, 12H) (Scheme 3). (3) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin-Pt (PtTCPP) The obtained PtTMCPP (300 mg, 0.354 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of 26 mL (THF/MeOH = 1:1), to which KOH aqueous solution (13 mL, 2 mol/L) was added and refluxed at 90 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, part of the solvent was removed, then filtered to obtain a clear solution. Subsequently, the solution was acidified with 1 M HCl until no more precipitate was formed (pH≈2). Finally, the collected precipitate was obtained via centrifugation, washed with water several times, and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 8 h. (178 mg, 0.181 mmol, yield 51%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO‑d 6): δ 13.31 (s, 4H), 8.75 (s, 8H), 8.35 (d, 8H), 8.29 (d, 8H). 2.2.2 Synthesis of Ti-MOF-Pt A mixture of 105 μL Ti(OBu)4, 50 mg PtTCPP and 2.700 g benzoic acid were dissolved in 8 mL N, N-diethyl formamide (DEF) under stirring at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 5 days. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone several times to obtain a solid orange Ti-MOF-Pt (denoted as TMF-Pt). 2.2.3 Synthesis of Ti-MOF Follow the same process as TMF-Pt, just only need to use 5,10,15,20-tetra-carboxyphenyl-porphyrin (H2TCPP) instead of PtTCPP and label it as TMF."
4,Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments,"2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was carried out in the photocatalytic hydrogen generationsystem provided by Beijing China Education Au-light Company. Generally, a magnetic stirrer dispersed 5 mg of the photocatalyst in a 50 mL solution containing ascorbic acid (AH2, 1 M) as a sacrificial electron donor, and exhausted air by blowing for 15 min under N2 atmosphere. A constant temperature cooling circulating pump was used to maintain the test temperature at 10 °C, and in a closed system illuminated by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter, a gas chromatograph (GC 7920, Nitrogen was used as carrier gas) was used to detect the formation of H2 online every hour. The cycle stability test was carried out under the duration of each cycle of 5 h."
5,Photocatalytic NO removal experiments,"2.4 Photocatalytic NO removal experiments The photocatalytic NO removal activity was evaluated by measuring the efficiency of Ti-MOFs materials to remove ppb-level NO in a continuous flow reactor at room temperature. Typically, 200 mg of the photocatalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in a certain amount of ethanol, the suspension was evenly coated in two clean petri dishes made of glass, dried in a 60 °C drying oven, and then placed in a volume of a 4.5 L (L × W × H, 30 cm × 15 cm × 10 cm) glass reactor, two 12 W LED lights were placed on the top as a light source. An air stream containing 520 ppb NO (humidity level:50%) flowed through the catalyst at the rate of 2.4 L/min. When the adsorption balance improved, the light turned on, and a chemiluminescence NOx analyzer (Thermo Scientific, 42i-TL) was used to continuously monitor the NOx (where NOx represents NO + NO2) concentrations. In the cyclic experiment, the sample prepared according to the above steps was first subjected to a NO removal reaction, and then to dark adsorption again. After the adsorption equilibrium, the sample was subjected to the second light NO removal reaction, a total of 5 cycles. The NO removal ratio (η) was calculated as the following equation: η (%) = (1 - C/C0) × 100%, where C0 represents the concentration of NO adsorption equilibrium, and C represents the concentration of a specific time in the photocatalytic reaction."
6,Electrochemical measurements,"2.5 Electrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical test was measured on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) with a three-electrode system, where the reference electrode was saturated Hg/HgCl2, and the Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode. Typically, 2 mg catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol solution containing 10 µL of Nafion reagent by ultrasonic, 100 μL of which was absorbed and daubed evenly on the ITO glass as a working electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as the light source, and 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte for photocurrent and electrochemical impedance tests."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural and morphological characterizations,"3.1 Structural and morphological characterizations The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1 a) of TMF and TMF-Pt showed a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.02°, and broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = 18.48°, 29.77°, 44.89°, which were attributed to the successful synthesis of Ti-MOFs as the previously reported literature [21]. In addition, no characteristic diffraction peaks belonging to the Pt nanoparticles (PDF#87-0646, 2θ = 39.79°, 46.28°, 67.53°) were observed in TMF-Pt, which suggested that there was no apparent Pt aggregation in TMF-Pt. More importantly, the Pt content in TMF-Pt was 8.9 wt% measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1b) showed that the absorption peaks at 1700–700 cm−1 were the characteristic absorption bands of the macrocyclic porphyrin skeleton [22]. Usually, the peak near 1415 cm−1 was the stretching vibration of the C = N bond in the pyrrole ring, the peak near 1600 cm−1 was the vibration of the benzene ring outside the pyrrole ring [23]. The peak near 796 cm−1 was the characteristic of benzene ring substitution [24], and the peak around 1700 cm−1 was the C = O stretching vibration of the carboxyl group [24]. The specific surface area and porosity of the as-prepared materials were studied using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm. As shown in Fig. 1c, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area calculated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis for TMF and TMF-Pt were 331.7 m2/g and 380.4 m2/g (Table S1), respectively. The BET specific surface area of TMF-Pt was larger than that of TMF, which may be caused by Pt embedded in the porphyrin center. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) determined the pore size distribution based on the data obtained from N2 adsorption curves. Fig. 1d showed the pore size distribution of TMF-Pt was similar to that of TMF, indicating that single-atom Pt was not stacked together. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image and transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of TMF-Pt clearly showed the uniform size of the sample (Fig. 2 a and b) and the pore morphology of the sample surface observed in the enlarged SEM image (Fig. S1). The large pores could provide more effective contact interfaces and exposed more surface-active sites [25], and promote mass transfer in the catalytic process. No periodic lattice patterns of Pt nanoparticles were observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, which suggested that the single-atom Pt in TMF-Pt had not yet been aggregated (Fig. 2c). The element mapping (Fig. 2d) showed the uniform distribution of C, N, O, Ti, and Pt in the selected area, which further proved the uniform compositions in the TMF-Pt material. As mentioned above in Fig. 2c, no obvious periodic lattice patterns of Pt nanoparticles were observed in the HRTEM image. Furthermore, uniformly distributed small bright spots could be observed via aberration-corrected high-angle dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) in Fig. 3 a. At the same time, the particle size distribution chart showed the size mainly ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 nm in Fig. 3b, which further proved that Pt existed as isolated single atoms [26]. In addition, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to study the specific local electronic structure information of Pt catalysts and their interaction with support materials [27,28]. It could be found that the white line intensity of TMF-Pt was between Pt foil and PtO2 (Fig. 3c) through the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectrum (XANES) of the Pt L3-edge, indicating that the single-atom Pt was in the oxidized forms (Ptδ+) [29], which wasinlinewith the below XPS results (Fig. 4 b). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrum (EXAFS) revealed no obvious Pt-Pt (≈2.7 Å) bond in TMF-Pt, but there was a prominent peak at ≈1.5 Å attributed to the Pt-N bond [30], which confirmed nitrogen atoms had stabilized single-atom Pt, and there were almost no Pt particles or clusters in TMF-Pt. The result could be further proved by the prominent Pt-N peak in the fitted curve (Fig. S2), and was very consistent with the above HAADF-STEM results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface element states of the sample. As shown in the XPS spectrums (Fig. 4a), a clear Pt peak appeared at 74.1 eV in TMF-Pt, which confirmed the successful introduction of Pt atoms into TMF. The Pt 4f spectrum (Fig. 4b) exhibited two peaks at binding energies of 76.4 and 73.1 eV, corresponding to the levels of 4f5/2 and 4f7/2, respectively. The peaks position between Pt(II) and Pt(0) indicated that the single-atom Pt carried a positive charge could efficiently realize the electron transfer through the enhanced interaction between the porphyrin linker and the embedded Pt atom [31]. Furthermore, we also collected the N 1 s spectra of TMF and TMF-Pt (Fig. 4c and 4d). The peaks at 400.2 eV were attributed to –NH in the porphyrin-free-base units in TMF, while the obviously different peaks at 399.3 eV further confirmed the successful coordination of Pt-N bonds in TMF-Pt [29]."
9,Optical properties and electrochemical evaluation,"3.2 Optical properties and electrochemical evaluation The optical properties were first evaluated via UV–vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the TMF materials had strong absorption bands with an apparent Soret band at about 400 nm and a Q band at around 500–700 nm due to the characteristics of porphyrin ligands [32]. It could be found that the Soret bands of TMF-Pt and TMF were located at 395 nm and 407 nm, respectively, in which TMF-Pt was blue-shifted after the single-atom Pt was introduced [33]. Incomparisonwith TMF, the phenomenon that the number of absorption peaks in the Q bands of TMF-Pt decreased from 4 to 2 could be due to that one Pt atom coordinated with the four N atoms of the porphyrin ring, which led to the molecular orbital split decreased in degree and increased in degeneracy as the result of increased symmetry of the metalloporphyrin molecule and closer energy level [34]. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrums revealed that the TMF-Pt exhibited a far lower PL intensity than TMF (Fig. 5b), which indicated that the electrons could rapidly transfer from the porphyrin ligands to the isolated Pt atoms or the Ti-oxo clusters, further effectively avoiding the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also studied to reveal the charge separation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5c, TMF-Pt had a more robust photocurrent response, which indicated the recombination of charge carriers was significantly inhibited and an effective charge transfer occurred under visible light irradiation. EIS tests displayed (Fig. 5d) TMF-Pt had a smaller radius, confirming the faster charge transfer efficiency in accordance with the photocatalytic performance."
10,Photocatalytic hydrogen production and NO removal activity,"3.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production and NO removal activity The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance via water splitting was evaluated under visible light irradiation through ascorbic acids as sacrificial agents and water as solvents. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the original TMF exhibited almost no photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, which could be caused by rapid charge carriers recombination without co-catalysts. After implanting single-atom Pt into the center of porphyrin molecules, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of TMF-Pt was significantly improved to 15456 µmol·g−1·h−1. For comparison, a similar Pt content of H2PtCl6·6H2O was added to the above hydrogen evolution system, which exhibited a moderate photocatalytic activity with the H2 generation rate of 1563 µmol‧g−1‧h−1. The very high hydrogen release rate of TMF-Pt than that of TMF could be due to the efficient single-atom Pt utilization, which could facilitate the faster photo-generated electrons transfer, further improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. In addition, it could be seen that the photocatalytic hydrogen release rate of TMF-Pt hardly decreased after several continuous cycle experiments (Fig. 6b), which demonstrated that the TMF-Pt with single-atom Pt embedded could act as an effective and stable photocatalyst to produce hydrogen in practical application in the future. The photocatalytic NO removal performance of TMF and Ti-MOF-Pt were also evaluated in a continuous flow reactor under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the NO removal rate of TMF-Pt was as high as 70.3%, while the NO removal rate of TMF was only 57.4%, which indicated that the single-atom Pt implanted in the center of the porphyrin linker had a good electron transfer effect in the entire TMF, further achieving better photocatalytic activity to eliminate NO. Moreover, the photochemical and structural stability of the photocatalyst was essential for practical applications. The stability test of TMF-Pt was studied through multiple photocatalytic NO removal reactions. It was worth noting that the photocatalytic activity hardly changed after multiple cycle experiments (Fig. 7b), which suggested that the TMF-Pt was a very stable photocatalyst for eliminating NO."
11,Electron spin resonance,"3.4 Electron spin resonance 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a trapping agent to capture the superoxide (‧O2 –) radicals and hydroxyl (‧OH) radicals generated during the NO removal process via the electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. As shown in Fig. 8 , the TMF almost hardly produced ‧O2 – and ‧OH radicals under dark conditions after adding DMPO reagents. However, after irradiating with visible light for 10 min, the characteristic peaks of ‧O2 – radicals with about 1: 1: 1: 1 intensity ratio and ‧OH radicals with approximately 1: 2: 2: 1 signal intensity ratio were detected to further confirm the main intermediate species. At the same time, the ESR signal peaks detected by TMF-Pt were significantly higher than that of TMF, which could be attributed to the higher charge separation efficiency resulting from the single-atom Pt introduction [35]."
12,In-situ DRIFTS spectra,"3.5 In-situ DRIFTS spectra An in-situ DRIFTS study was conducted to understand NO adsorption and oxidation reaction pathways in TMF and TMF-Pt. The adsorption spectrums showed several peaks related to nitrite (NO2 –) (1340 cm−1, 1419 cm−1) [36,37], monodentate nitrate (1603 cm−1) [38], chelated bidentate nitrate (1518 cm−1) [39] and bridging nitrate (1694 cm−1, 1707 cm−1) [40], and most of these peaks intensity enhanced with the adsorption time increased (Fig. 9 a and b). When the light was turned on, the adsorbed substances on the catalyst surface began to obviously change (Fig. 9c and d), particularly various types of nitrates and nitrites increased significantly. A new band N2O3 (911 cm−1) [41] can be observed obviously in TMF, which was attributed to the reaction of NO with ·OH [39]. Moreover, these new characteristic peaks of N2O3 (911 cm−1) [38], monodentate nitrate (1016 cm−1) [42], linear nitrites (1070 cm−1) [43], chelated nitrite (1178 cm−1) [44] were clearly observed in TMF-Pt. In addition, the most peaks intensity of TMF-Pt was significantly higher than that of TMF, which indicated that TMF-Pt had a better activation ability."
13,Possible photocatalytic mechanism,"3.6 Possible photocatalytic mechanism Based on all the above discussion results and related reported literature, we proposed a possible photocatalytic mechanism (Scheme 4 ). Porphyrin organic ligands were excited by visible light to generate electron-hole pairs. In the photocatalytic hydrogen production system, photo-generated electrons were rapidly transferred from the LUMO level of excited porphyrin ligands to the single-atom Pt, where H2O molecules were reduced to generate H2 [13]. However, it could not be ruled out that some of the electrons were transferred to the Ti-oxo cluster to further produce H2 [45]. In the photocatalytic NO removal system, the photo-generated electrons on the single-atom Pt reduced the O2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface to ‧O2 – or further converted to ‧OH, which acted as the real active species to convert NO to NO2 – or NO3 –. At the same time, the photo-generated holes could oxidize the hydroxide (OH–) adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to hydroxyl (‧OH), and further converted NO to NO2 – or NO3 –. In the photocatalytic process, the presence of single-atom Pt could promote the effective separation of electron-hole pairs to further improve the photocatalytic performance."
14,Conclusion,"In conclusion, we firstly manufactured the dual-functional material TMF-Pt with ultra-high loading of single-atom Pt implanted into the center of planar porphyrin unite, which not only improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution but also enhanced NO removal. The high concentration of single-atom Pt active centers with high atom-utilization efficiency could remarkably promote the charge transfer and separation rate, making TMF-Pt exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency in both hydrogen production and NO removal. This new material was suitable for the removal of low-concentration NO. In addition, it was also suitable for photocatalytic production of green hydrogen, renewable energy without carbon dioxide in the production process, which was in line with the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutralization proposed. The current research highlighted the vast potentials and advantages of using porphyrin MOFs as a template to load ultra-high single-atom active centers to further boost photocatalytic performance. However, the material (TMF-Pt) was that the single-atom active sites Pt is a kind of precious metal and the high cost limited the large-scale use of TMF-Pt in photocatalytic hydrogen production and NO removal. Therefore, we will also use non-precious metal embedded porphyrin centers for future research to pursue high efficiency and take into account its economy."
