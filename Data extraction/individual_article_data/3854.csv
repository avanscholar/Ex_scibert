0,Introduction,"Derived from the non-centrosymmetric nature of the materials [1], piezoelectricity is a phenomenon that electron-hole pairs in the materials can be separated and accumulate in the electric dipoles to build up an electric field upon the application of external mechanical forces [2,3]. Given the versatility and ubiquity of piezoelectricity, materials with this property have been widely used in industries as transducers, actuator and sensors [4–6]. Recently, piezoelectric materials find wide applications in catalysis [7–9]. The capability to transfer mechanical force such as ultrasonic vibration or mechanical stirring into chemical energy enables piezocatalysts to be an alternative for photocatalysts and electrocatalysts, potentially cutting the cost of energy consumption. Piezocatalysis was previously achieved by the utilization of ZnO microfibers and BaTiO3 microdendrites to trigger water splitting and produce O2 and H2 [10]. Since then, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) [11,12], molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) [13], lead zirconate titanite (PZT) [14] and other piezocatalysts [15–18] were intensively investigated. However, development of novel piezocatalysts with high efficiency and low toxicity is still a challengeable task. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an essential green oxidizing agent that has been commonly used in advanced oxidation processes, especially in Fenton and Fenton-like reactions, since it can be activated to form hydroxyl radicals ( OH, 2.7 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) for pollutant degradation [19–21]. However, typical Fenton reactions require H2O2 addition, which means an increase in H2O2 transportation and storage cost. The utilization of in-situ generated H2O2 is a promising option to overcome this problem. Currently, in-situ H2O2 generation has been achieved in some photo-Fenton systems via O2 reduction. With the addition of ferric or ferrous ions, the photo-generated H2O2 can be effectively utilized through Fenton reaction to achieve organic contaminants degradation or inorganic ions oxidation [22,23]. However, there are few reports about in-situ utilization of piezo-generated H2O2. Piezocatalytic H2O2 production (PHOP) can take place because oxygen can be reduced by free electrons generated in the piezocatalytic processes. Previously, BiOCl and g-C3N4 were reported to produce 28 μmol/h and 34 μmol/h H2O2 under ultrasonic vibration (150 W, 53 kHz), respectively [17,18]. Lv et al. [24] observed the production of H2O2 in the piezocatalysis of BiTiO3 microcrystals, and developed a piezo-Fenton process by the addition of ferric ions. Nevertheless, the potential application of this process is impaired because of the addition of chemical reagents. Therefore, it exhibits great application prospects to build a piezo-Fenton system for in-situ H2O2 utilization by immobilized iron species but not adding ferric or ferrous ions. Monoclinic BiVO4 is known as a photocatalyst with visible light response and low toxic property [25,26]. It can be easily synthesized for a large scale by a homogeneous precipitation method. Meanwhile, BiVO4 also possesses inherent ferroelectricity due to the distortion of VO4 tetrahedron. Significant H2O2 accumulation was previously observed during the piezocatalytic of BiVO4, which was utilized for concurrent p-chlorophenol and Cr(VI) removal [27]. This provides an option for H2O2 production through piezocatalysis of BiVO4. On the other hand, Fe loaded BiVO4 has been investigated in some photocatalysis systems, since Fe can be the electron trapping centers as well as active sites for H2O2 activation [28–31]. In this contribution, the syntheses and piezocatalytic performance of Fe-loaded BiVO4 (Fe/BVO) was investigated, and the in-situ H2O2 generation and activation mechanism was discussed."

Mott–Schottky plots were obtained via electrochemical analysis (CHI 760E Chenhua Instrument Company, China). Details of analytic methods are shown in Supplementary Material."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Characterization of catalysts,"3.1 Characterization of catalysts The XRD patterns of catalysts were measured to investigate their crystalline structures as shown in Fig. 1 . For both materials, the characteristic peaks at 18.7°, 28.8°, 30.5° and 53.2° match with the standard card of monoclinic bismuth vanadate (JCPDS 14-0688). Compared with pristine BVO, the invisible changes on the XRD pattern of Fe/BVO can be explained by the relatively low content and highly dispersive of the loaded Fe species [28]. The electronic states and chemical composition of the elements in Fe/BVO were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2 ). The Bi 4f region shows deconvoluted peaks at 159.5 eV and 164.8 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of Bi3+ ions, respectively (Fig. 2a) [37,38]. The characteristic peaks at 517.1 eV and 524.6 eV in V 2p spectrum (Fig. 2b) represent V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2, respectively [39]. In O 1 s spectrum, three peaks at 530.1 eV, 531.8 eV and 532.2 eV demonstrate the presence of lattice oxygen (O2−) from metal-oxygen bonds, chemisorbed hydroxyl groups (OH−) and chemisorbed water (H2O), respectively (Fig. 2c) [37,40]. Fig. 2d exhibits the spectrum of Fe 2p3/2. The deconvolution of Fe 2p3/2 spectrum consists of two main peaks at 711.2 eV and 714.4 eV, which are consistent with Fe(III) and Fe(II), respectively [41–43]. As a typical fingerprint, the satellite peak at 719.1 eV also reveals the presence of Fe(III) [40,44,45]. Therefore, it can be inferred that Fe is successfully loaded on the surface of BiVO4 and presents a mixed valence states (Fe(II) and Fe(III)), which might play a significant role for H2O2 activation in the piezocatalytic reactions [40]. SEM and TEM images are utilized to determine the microstructure and morphology of as-synthesized materials. According to the SEM images, both BVO and Fe/BVO exhibit aggregated spherical structure with a diameter around 11–12 μm (Figs. S1 and 3a). Besides, there are many observable floccules on the surface of Fe/BVO, which correspond to the immobilized Fe impregnation. Furthermore, TEM image (Fig. 3 b) provides a more detailed vision of the synthesized Fe/BVO. Small BVO nanoparticles (100–200 nm) aggregate, with the decoration of flocculent iron compounds on the surface. The iron loading can be further proved by EDS mapping images (Fig. 3c). Fe species are successfully decorated on BVO surface in a homogeneous way. The piezoelectric response of Fe/BVO was characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) measurement. As shown in Fig. 4 a, by applying a 10 V DC bias field, a localized phase hysteresis loop is observed for Fe/BVO and the phase angles present a 180° change, indicating a 180° switch of polarization from its original orientation [46]. Moreover, the displacement-voltage curve exhibits a “butterfly” shape (Fig. 4b), which is also the evidence for the piezoelectricity of Fe/BVO [47]."
8,Piezocatalytic performance for p-CP degradation,"3.2 Piezocatalytic performance for p-CP degradation The piezocatalytic activity of Fe/BVO was demonstrated via p-CP removal and H2O2 generation (Fig. 5 ). In the presence of Fe/BVO catalyst but without ultrasonic, about 12% of p-CP is removed and negligible H2O2 is detected within 120 min. It indicates that Fe/BVO exhibits a certain p-CP adsorption performance, which is conducive to its piezocatalytic removal. In the absence of the catalyst but with the application of ultrasonic, p-CP reduction is only 5%. However, the p-CP removal efficiency reaches up to 85.6% and the accumulated H2O2 is 67.3 μmol/L by the joint application of Fe/BVO and ultrasonic vibration for 120 min. This result confirms that the piezocatalysis of Fe/BVO can be achieved by applying ultrasonic vibration. The role of Fe was investigated by comparing the piezocatalytic performance of pristine BVO and Fe/BVO. It can be seen from Fig. 5a and b that only 43.6% of p-CP is reduced with the catalysis of BVO, while H2O2 accumulates and reaches up to 199.9 μmol/L at 120 min. By contrast, in the presence of Fe/BVO, 85.6% p-CP reduction is achieved. The kinetics of p-CP removal fit with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The rate constants (k) for BVO and Fe/BVO are 0.005 min−1 and 0.016 min−1, respectively (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that Fe loading can enhance the removal rate of p-CP to more than triple. However, H2O2 concentration decreases to 67.3 μmol/L in the piezocatalysis of Fe/BVO, about one-third of that produced in the BVO system. The decreased H2O2 in the piezocatalysis after Fe loading may be attributed to either the inhibited H2O2 generation in piezocatalysis or the accelerated H2O2 consumption through a Fenton-like process. The effect of reaction conditions on the piezocatalytic performance of Fe/BVO was explored (Fig. 6 ), and the rate constants of p-CP degradation were compared in Fig. S2. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, temperature exhibits significant influence on the catalytic performance of Fe/BVO. When the temperature rises from 25 °C to 45 °C, p-CP degradation decreases from 84.6% to 34.5% within 120 min. It is as a result of the decreased dissolved oxygen concentration at the elevated temperatures (from 8.25 mg/L at 25 °C to 5.75 mg/L at 45 °C), which would limit the oxygen supply for electron scavenging and H2O2 generation [27]. The initial concentration of target contaminates can affect the p-CP degradation rate as well (Fig. 6c). Among the three concentrations, the highest degradation rate is achieved when p-CP concentration is 0.1 mM. When it increases to 0.2 mM, the degradation efficiency decreases significantly (only 18% in 120 min). It can be explained by that the excessive contaminates are adsorbed on Fe/BVO surface, resulting in a deficiency of active sites. However, when the p-CP concentration drops down to 0.05 mM, the piezocatalytic performance of Fe/BVO also decreases. This can be attributed to that as a hole (h+) scavenger, the low concentration of p-CP would impair electron-hole pairs separation, resulting in the suppressed H2O2 generation, which decreases from 67 μmol/L to 42 μmol/L (Fig. 6d) [48]. The degradation of p-CP can also be affected by the dosage of catalyst (Fig. 6e). With the increased Fe/BVO dosages, p-CP degradation and H2O2 accumulation show significant increase (from 28% to 91% and 16 μmol/L to 247 μmol/L within 120 min, respectively). This is on the grounds that the increased Fe/BVO dosage can provide more active sites for this piezocatalytic process. Moreover, the effect of pH and Fe loading contents on p-CP degradation were also investigated (Fig. S3). The piezocatalytic activity of Fe/BVO is relatively low under acidic condition (34% in 120 min), while the degradation efficiency is significantly improved under near neutral (pH = 6.22) to alkaline conditions (pH = 9.81). The decreased piezocatalytic activity of Fe/BVO in acidic solutions can be ascribed to the superfluous leaching of iron ions, resulting in the decrease of active sites [49]. Fe/BVO achieves the highest catalytic activity when Fe loading content is 0.4 wt%. The lower Fe loading content will reduce the active sites of Fe/BVO. However, as the trapping centers of both electrons and holes, a higher Fe loading content will increase the recombination efficiency of electron-hole pairs, hence inhibiting the catalytic performance of Fe/BVO [28,50]. To evaluate the application prospects of Fe/BVO piezocatalysis in actual water, the effects of co-existed anions (Cl-, SO4 2- and CO3 2−) and humic acid (HA) on p-CP degradation were explored, respectively. As shown in Fig. S4a and b, the presence of Cl- or SO4 2- will inhibit p-CP removal since they can quench the generated radicals. But when the concentration of Cl- or SO4 2- is low (2 mM), the effect of inhibition is slight. The suppression of p-CP degradation by CO3 2− is more obvious (Fig. S4c) than Cl- or SO4 2-. This can be explained by that the presence of CO3 2− will not only quench the generated radicals but also increase the pH of the solution to more than 10, which is unfavorable to Fe/BVO piezocatalysis. Furthermore, humic acid, a representative natural organic matter, exhibits negligible influence on p-CP degradation (Fig. S4d), suggesting the application potential of Fe/BVO piezocatalysis in practice. Leaching of Fe ions were measured at the typical pH of 6.22 to evaluate the stability and security of the Fe/BVO catalyst. For both samples before and after reactions, leaching Fe ions are below the detection limitation of the AAS measurements, indicating high stability of iron species in the catalysts. The result also proves that the enhanced p-CP degradation is attributed to the heterogeneous Fenton-like process, but not to the homogenous reactions originated from the leaching Fe ions."
9,Mechanism discussion on the role of Fe loading,"3.3 Mechanism discussion on the role of Fe loading The free carriers in the piezoelectric materials are essential for piezocatalytic reactions [14,51]. To ascertain whether Fe loading will affect the density of free carriers in the piezocatalyst (Fe/BVO), Mott-Schottky tests were performed. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , both BVO and Fe/BVO curves slope positively, indicating their n-type semiconducting nature. The x-intercept represents the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the materials. The Vfb of BVO is −0.32 V vs. NHE, which is consistent with the previous records [52,53]. When BVO is loaded with Fe, the Vfb negatively shifts to −0.50 V vs. NHE, indicating the enhanced reduction capability of electrons [54]. Meanwhile, the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots represent the carrier density in semiconductors. According to the Mott–Schottky equation (Eq. (1)) [52,55], the carrier densities can be compared via the slopes of the curves. For n-type semiconductors, a smaller slope represents a higher carrier density [56]. Therefore, Fe loading can increase the carrier density of BVO, which favors the piezocatalytic performance as well as the piezocatalytic generation of H2O2. Accordingly, it can be indicated that the decreased H2O2 concentration in Fe/BVO piezocatalytic system is due to the accelerated H2O2 consumption through a Fenton-like process instead of the inhibited H2O2 generation (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the higher carrier density of Fe/BVO can also benefit the Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle [57]. Consequently, the piezocatalysis of Fe/BVO can result in a higher p-CP removal efficiency by in-situ utilizing the produced H2O2. (1) 1 / C 2 = ( 2 / e ε ε 0 N d ) [ V a - V fb - k T / e ] To determine the production pathway of H2O2, the influence of oxygen on the piezo-Fenton reaction was studied in Fig. 8 . Both p-CP removal and H2O2 accumulation are negligible when the suspension was purged by N2, demonstrating that O2 is critical to the piezo-Fenton process. Moreover, since water oxidation is the only pathway to generate H2O2 in the absence of O2 (Eq. (2)) [18], it can be concluded that the piezo-generated H2O2 in the BVO-based system mainly comes from O2 reduction (Eqs. (3) and (4)) instead of H2O oxidation. (2) 2 H 2 O + 2 h + → H 2 O 2 + 2 H + (3) O 2 + e - → O 2 ∙ - (4) O 2 ∙ - + e - + 2 H + → H 2 O 2 To further understand the H2O2 activation mechanism in piezo-Fenton processes via Fe/BVO, the removal of p-CP by H2O2 without ultrasonic vibration was investigated. With the addition of the Fe/BVO catalyst and 200 μmol/L H2O2, negligible p-CP reduction is observed (Fig. S5), indicating that H2O2 cannot be activated directly by Fe/BVO. Thus, in the Fe/BVO piezocatalytic process, ultrasonic is not only important for H2O2 production, but also for its activation. It is reported that the mixed valence of Fe can induce Fenton-like reactions since the Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle can lead to the activation of H2O2 [40,42,58,59]. Similar transformation can be assumed in the piezocatalytic system of Fe/BVO. As shown in Fig. S6, compared with fresh Fe/BVO, the proportions of Fe(III) (711.2 eV) for Fe/BVO after reaction decreases from 66.31% to 62.46%, while that of Fe(II) (714.4 eV) increases from 22.03% to 26.62%. This result confirms that charge transfer during piezocatalytic processes can induce the reduction of Fe(III) and increase Fe(II) percentages in the samples , which favors H2O2 activation and p-CP degradation [60]. To ascertain the active species involved in this piezo-Fenton process, quenching tests were conducted. Tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and benzoquinone (BQ) are added to scavenge OH and O 2 ∙- , respectively. As shown in Fig. 9 , p-CP is negligibly degraded in the presence of either TBA or BQ, suggesting that OH and O 2 ∙- serve as the dominated active species for the piezo-Fenton reaction [61–64]. To further confirm the production of OH during the piezocatalytic process, a coumarin-FL probe test was carried out. For both BVO (Fig. 10 a) and Fe/BVO (Fig. 10b), emission peaks at 425 nm are detected and the emission intensity continues to increase as the reaction proceeding, demonstrating OH are generated and accumulated in the BVO-based piezocatalytic system. Besides, Fe/BVO performs a higher fluorescent intensity than the pristine BVO, suggesting that the loading of Fe can enhance OH production, leading to an increased p-CP removal efficiency. On the other hand, NaF was selected to determine the contribution of surface-bound OH, since F− can inhibit the generation of surface-bound OH [65]. As shown in Fig. S7a, the presence of NaF can dramatically inhibit p-CP degradation, indicating that the generated OH are mainly surface-adsorbed. This result also explains why the DMPO-OH signals were failed to be detected in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test (Fig. S7b). The results of ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analyses suggest that the main by-products of p-CP piezocatalytic degradation are 4-chlorocatechol and 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (Fig. S8). Both are typical reaction products of p-CP and OH, further confirming that p-CP is decomposed into oxidized products by OH [66]. Therefore, it can be speculated that surface-bound OH are produced from piezo-generated H2O2 via a Fenton-like reaction under the catalysis of Fe/BVO (Eqs. (6)–(8)) and serve as the main active species for p-CP degradation (Eq. (9)). (5) B i V O 4 + V i b r a t i o n → e - + h + (6) Fe(II) + H2O2 → Fe(III) + OH + OH− (7) Fe(III) + H2O2 → Fe(II) + H+ + HO2 (8) HO2 + H2O2 → O2 + H2O + OH (9) OH + 4-CP → Oxidized products Scheme 1 exhibited the proposed mechanism of the piezo-Fenton process. The loading of mixed valence iron promotes charge transfer in the catalyst. As a consequence, the piezocatalytic production of H2O2 is expected to be improved. Simultaneously, the Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle leads to H2O2 activation for p-CP degradation. The reaction pathway can be summarized in two main steps. In the first step, Fe/BVO can generate an electric field in response to the ultrasonic vibration. Electrons and holes are separated and migrated to the surface of the catalyst via the piezo-generated internal electric field (Eq. (5)). By accepting electrons, oxygen is reduced to H2O2 that accumulates in the system (Eqs. (3) and (4)). Then in the second step, piezo-generated H2O2 is involved in the Fenton-like process by the loaded mixed valence iron species to produce surface-bound OH (Eqs. (6)–(8)), and p-CP is oxidized by OH (Eq. (9)). As a result, the in-situ utilization of piezo-generated H2O2 for p-CP degradation is achieved."
10,Conclusions,"In conclusion, Fe/BVO was synthesized to achieve in-situ catalyzation of piezo-Fenton reactions. The piezoelectricity of Fe/BVO is proved, and the mixed valence Fe species exist on the surface of the catalyst. The Fe loading BVO displays significantly improved piezocatalytic performance for p-CP degradation by in-situ consuming the generated H2O2. The loading of Fe can improve charge density in the BVO, accordingly improving the piezocatalytic performance. The mixed valance Fe can favor the in-situ decomposition of piezo-generated H2O2 into OH for p-CP degradation. This work presents a novel piezo-Fenton system by loading Fe on the surface of bismuth vanadate and provides insight for the application of in-situ H2O2 utilization during piezocatalysis."
