0,Introduction,"Plant biomass is a major renewable and sustainable energy resource for the production of reducing sugars and can be converted into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by process optimisation, which can be used as precursors for biogas and value-added products (Himmel et al., 2007). However, degrading crop residues by physical and chemical pretreatment procedures prior to use is difficult because of rich lignin resistance (Zhao et al., 2012). Pretreatment strategies may facilitate the degradation of lignin and enhance enzymatic hydrolysis and methane yield (Yuan et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Lignin and hemicellulose form a strong barrier that reduces enzymatic approach (Ding et al., 2018; Yang and Wyman, 2004; Shimizu et al., 2018; Kumar and Wyman, 2009). Alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment, which withdraws a major portion of lignin and some amounts of hemicellulose and maintains or enhances cellulose component, is generally utilised in the papermaking industry (Liu, 2003; Sun and Sun, 2002). Hydrogen peroxide pretreatment in alkaline condition has drawn considerable attention because of its role in the biotransformation of linocellulosic material into value-added products and enhancement of the access of enzymes to polysaccharides for maximum sugar yield (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2019a). This pretreatment procedure is inexpensive and has high practicability and symbiotic affiliations with enzymatic degradation phenomena (Banerjee et al., 2012). However, several selective influential microbes carrying catalytic enzymes are still needed for enzymatic saccharification despite AHP pretreatment (Zhang et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2015, 2019a). An enzyme's catalytic potential and cost are the limiting factors for cellulosic biofuel commercialisation. The efficiency of cellulose degradation enzymes is restricted by the crystalline nature of cellulose (Zhao et al., 2012). Converting crystalline cellulose into amorphous and restructured cellulose can enhance hydrolysis rate five times by improving the catalytic activity of cellulase-carrying microorganisms (Chundawat et al., 2011). The crystalline form of cellulose is difficult to degrade by chemical pretreatment methods, such as hydrogen peroxide, hydrothermal method and the use of low-concentration acids (Yuan et al., 2018). Pretreatment with ionic liquid enhances the degradation of cellulose by eliminating lignin and dismantling cellulosic crystalline structures (Goshadrou and Lefsrud, 2017; Carneiro et al., 2017). However, the main hindrance of using ionic liquid pilot scale is its high cost (Zhang et al., 2017). Lithium chloride/N,N-dimethylacetamide (LiCl/DMAc) solvent system is an effective resource for deconstructing cellulose beyond derivatisation and is inexpensive (Alexandridis et al., 2018). This ionic solvent system is barely utilised in pretreatment for biomethane production (Zhang et al., 2014). Qi et al. (2017) used wheat stalks as feedstock and pretreated stalks with low-concentration acid prior to the use of the LiCl/DMAc solvent system and enzymatic saccharification, and this process led to the excessive loss of lignin content. Han et al. (2019) regenerated cellulose fibres from corn stalk (CS) using the LiCl/DMAc solution system and successfully dissolved fine cellulose into biopolymeric films. The combined pretreatment of AHP and a strong ionic solvent system (LiCl/DMAc) can enhance the digestion of cellulose in CS. The dissolution of AHP-pretreated biomass that includes a noticeable quantity of xylan is rarely studied, whereas the dissolution of cellulose in LiCl/DMAc solvent system has been extensively reported. Xylan blocks cellulose content through strong hydrogen bonds that inhibit the access of hydrolytic enzymes to cellulose (Penttila et al., 2013). Adding a strong ionic solvent system is needed to make cellulose more accessible to selective microorganisms carrying cellulose catalytic enzymes for the production of bio-based products, including biomethane, and for the production of the maximum concentration of reducing fermentable sugars (Song et al., 2016). Anaerobic digestion comprises four steps, namely, hydrolysis, fermentation, acetogenesis and methanogenesis (Sandoval et al., 2009). Different kinds of selective microorganisms that carry lactate dehydrogenase, butyrate kinase, acetate kinase, methyl-coenzyme M reductase, adenosine monophosphate and several significant gene profiles are engaged in anaerobic fermentation for the generation of biomethane (Guo et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2019b). These bacteria generate several potential enzymes that accelerate lignocellulosic biomass saccharification for biomethane production. A newly identified method, pretreatment with AHP and LiCl/DMAc was performed on CS for the enhancement of the biomethanation process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used in investigating physicochemical changes in untreated and pretreated CS samples. In addition, the delignification consequences of CS on glucose and fatty acids and on biomethane production were analysed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CSs were collected from Qingdao City, People's Republic of China. The stalks were ground into fine powder (80–100 mm) by a grinding instrument (FE130, Staida Co., Tianjing, China), and water particles were removed through heating in an oven at 65 °C for 24–48 h prior to experimental use. Approximately one-third of the dried CSs were sterilised and used in pretreatment, and two-thirds were packed and stored in a plastic bag for the next round of experiment. The total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) contents of the CSs were 91 ± 0.17% and 79.4 ± 1.78% (based on TS), respectively. The cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents of untreated CS were 39.31% ± 0.003%, 23.4% ± 0.002% and 16.5% ± 0.003%, respectively. Microbial fluid for anaerobic digestion was collected from a local water treatment plant in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. The TS and VS contents of the microbial fluid were 1.91 ± 0% and 70.2 ± 0.2% (based on TS), respectively."
3,AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment,"2.2 AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatment A 3% AHP solution with pH range of 10.5–11.5 was utilised for the delignification of CS in a glass reactor. Concentrated NaOH (5 M) was used for pH adjustment. A solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:25 (g/mL) was reacted at 70–75 °C for 3 h. Solid biomass residues were washed and filtered using tap water. The AHP pretreatment procedure was repeated using the same protocol. The washed and filtered biomass residues were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 24 h and milled with a mini-grinding machine (TJE10C-150, Supor, Zhejiang, China). An ionic solvent system of LiCl/DMAc (8%, w/w, 200 mL) was poured into 5 g of AHP-treated delignified samples, which were then incubated in a heated stirring water bath at 100 °C (LKTC-B1-T, Jiangsu, China) for 3.5 h and at room temperature for 24 h. The disintegrated samples were reconstructed and regenerated using the ionic solvent system and used for subsequent experiments."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods Standard methods (Eqs. (1) and (2)) were used in determining the TS and VS contents of CS (American Public Health Association, 2005). Total biogas volume was analysed through the water displacement method (Xu et al., 2018). The intensity of biomethane was detected by gas chromatography (GC; GC-7820, Lunan Analysis Instruments Co., Ltd., Tengzhou, China) linked to flame ionisation and thermal conductivity detectors and equipped with a TDX-01 column (2 m length, 3 mm inner diameter), and high-purity argon was used as carrier gas. The total gases were sampled in air bags during anaerobic digestion and injected into the GC system with an air-tight syringe. The hydrolysates were used for glucose and fatty acid measurement through centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and 0.22 μm filtration. A biosensor analyser (SBA-40D, Shandong, China) was used to detect glucose concentration. High-performance liquid chromatography (1260, Shimadzu, Japan) was used in determining VFAs, including ethanol, acetate and butyrate, using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio Rad) at 50 °C coupled to a UV (210 nm) detector. Approximately 0.5 mM H2SO4 was used as eluent at 0.7 mL/min. An FTIR spectrophotometer (Tensor 27) was used in performing infrared spectrum absorption. Morphological characterisation was performed using SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The crystallinity index (CrI) of the treated CS samples was calculated by the Segal method (Segal et al., 1959).

5,Structural change analysis,"2.4 Structural change analysis Cellulose and hemicellulose degradation potentials were determined by the APH method (Mustafa et al., 2017), and lignin loss was investigated by the acetyl bromide method, which is a fast and simple method for lignin measurement and recovery (Moreira-Vilar and Wanderley, 2014), for the analysis of component variations in CS pretreatment. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iN10 FTIR microscope (Thermo Nicolet Corporation, Madison, US) linked to a mercury–cadmium–telluride detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. Approximately 250 mg of the samples were coated into zirconia rotors for investigation. Morphological variations in the pretreated CS samples were studied by SEM. The dried samples were coated with gold plate (E-1010, Hitachi, Japan) and photographed from different distances (in μm) with a scanning electron microscope (S-3400N, Hitachi, Japan) at 10 kV acceleration voltage. CrI was investigated using an XRD-6000 diffractometer (Shimadzu, Japan) according to the method used by Hsu et al., in 2010 (Eq. (3)). The efficiency of the degradation of CS components, such as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, was analysed before and after pretreatment according to Eqs. (4)–(6) (Xu et al., 2018; Moreira-Vilar and Wanderley, 2014), where L final, C final are H final are the fractions of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose after pretreatment, respectively, and L initial , C initial and H initial are the fractions of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose before pretreatment, respectively. All the experiments were performed in triplicate. The figures were shaped using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

6,Biochemical methane potential assay,"2.5 Biochemical methane potential assay Biochemical methane potential analysis was executed in closed 500 mL air-tight bottles in am anaerobic environment (Angelidaki et al., 2009). The untreated, AHP-treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated CS samples (100 mL) were used for biomethane production. A range of one VS substrate was mixed with one VS inoculum for the anaerobic digestion in each bottle. Approximately 30 mL of micronutrient was added to attain a 0.1 L volume in 500 mL air-tight fermentation bottles. Two to three rounds of treatments were performed for accuracy. The same concentration of inoculum, micronutrient solution and substrate ratio were utilised in the follow-up experiments. The pH of the anaerobic digestion system was regulated to 7.4 with 2.0 M NaOH and HCl. for An anaerobic environment was created, and a balanced air pressure after vacuumisation was maintained by sealing all the bottles with rubbers toper after pH adjustment and flushing in high-purity nitrogen for 5 min. Anaerobic digestion was executed at 35 °C at an agitation rate of 120 r/min (Xu et al., 2018). The concentration of biomethane (mL/g VS) produced from the untreated, AHP-treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated CS samples was calculated based on Eq. (7) (He et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2013). The anaerobic digestion experiments were performed in triplicate. (7) CH 4 ( mL , biomass + Inoculum ) − CH 4 ( mL , inoculum ) Biomass ( gVS ) = CH 4 ( mL / gVS )"
7,Results and discussion,
8,AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatments influence degrading components,"3.1 AHP and LiCl/DMAc pretreatments influence degrading components Table 1 illustrates the CS degradation efficiency of AHP and AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment systems. The components of the untreated CS were 39.31% cellulose, 23.4% hemicellulose and 16.5% acetyl bromide (AB) lignin (AB lignin extraction method). Cellulose content was enhanced to 69.47% because of the 81.27% AB lignin loss from CS samples post AHP pretreatment. This result proved that AHP pretreatment is an encouraging method for cellulose retention and lignin elimination, which can substantially improve the efficiency of the degradation of crop residues into biomethane (Li et al., 2018). The disintegration ratio for acid, dilute acid and untreated wheat stalk, dilute acid and ethanol-dilute acid-treated wheat stalk were reported 51.50%, 71.50% and 37.90%, respectively, in LiCl/DMAc solvent in previous published reports (Qi et al., 2017). The AHP-treated delignified CS samples were dissolved completely in the LiCl/DMAc solvent. This result indicates that lignin is the major obstacle that hinders lignocellulose decomposition in LiCl/DMAc. Tap water can precipitate and regenerate LiCl/DMAc-treated delignified samples. The contents of the reconstructed samples were 73.3% cellulose, 15.82% hemicellulose and 2.09% AB lignin, reflecting a negligible effect to the AHP-treatment delignified CS samples. This result shows that LiCl/DMAc pretreatment markedly influenced the AHP-treated delignified CS samples."
9,Structural characterisation,"3.2 Structural characterisation All the treated and untreated CS samples were characterised by FTIR spectroscopy as configured in Fig. 1 . The peak at 1730 cm−1 is due to C–O vibrations in acetyl groups associated with xylan, whereas the peak at 1511 cm−1 is due to lignin's C–C span (Li et al., 2018). Several peaks in the untreated samples, such as those at 897, 1511 and 1730 cm−1, were not observed in the treated CS samples. This finding suggests that the chemically treated samples underwent deacetylation and delignification. However, minute chemical modifications were observed in the AHP-LiCl/DMAc treatment, and identical peaks were examined in both chemically treated samples. These minute modifications can be attributed to structural dissolution procedures and are consistent with the results reported in the chemical configuration assay. Cellulose consists of amorphous and crystalline regions, and a crystalline region has a forceful hydrogen bond response that is hard to degrade compared with the amorphous region (Zhao et al., 2012). Cellulose I was observed in the untreated and AHP-treated samples (Fig. 2 ), and thus the crystalline building block of cellulose could not be modified by AHP. The CrI of the untreated and AHP-treated samples were 46.75% and 63.51%, respectively. The CrI increased in the AHP-treated sample because of the removal of amorphous structures, such as hemicellulose and lignin. The restructured sample displayed one broad peak, which revealed the alteration of crystalline cellulose into an amorphous structure during the restructuring procedure after LiCl/DMAc pretreatment. The internal morphological variations in both chemically treated samples were analysed by SEM (Fig. 3 ). A hard-lined rigid surface could be viewed in the untreated CS samples at different radii (50 and 10 μm distances). The microfibrils of the AHP-treated samples were disfigured and disconnected and showed improved cellulose display; thus, the structures of the CS samples were destroyed. Such kind of modification was observed in alkali-treated bamboo biomass with recombinant cellulases (Ali et al., 2015; Kim and Lee, 2005; Xu et al., 2007). The histology reported a prominent change in AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated CS samples, which displayed a flat, regenerated and homogeneous macrostructure. These analyses determined that cellulose tissues disconnected from xylan can be diffused in the LiCl/DMAc solvent and reorganise after regeneration procedures (Lu et al., 2013)."
10,Glucose and VFA concentrations,"3.3 Glucose and VFA concentrations Glucose is considered the principal product of the degradation of plant biomass (Giwa et al., 2019). Glucose is the final hydrolysate for fatty acid production in the biomethanation process (Giwa et al., 2018). Therefore, glucose concentration is the decisive factor for the efficiency of plant biomass pretreatment. Fig. 4 shows glucose concentrations in the untreated, AHP-treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated samples. The maximum glucose concentration was recovered from the AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated group, which was 9.44% higher than that from the AHP-treated group and 82.78% greater than that from the untreated group. The AHP-treated group had an acetate production that was 80.99% larger than the untreated group. The acetate production potentials of both treated groups were remarkably high because of their high glucose concentrations compared with the glucose concentration in the untreated group. The members of order Halanaerobiales, especially Halothermothrix, which can degrade polymers into monomers, such as glucose, by their catalytic enzymes and transfigure solid residues into soluble substances in the first step of fermentation, are the dominant microflora in anaerobic digestion (Ali et al., 2019b). The VFA (acetate) concentrations released from the treated and untreated groups are shown in Fig. 5 . The lag phases of both treated samples were similar and higher than the lag phase of the untreated sample until 96 h of pretreatment. Acetate was prominently enriched in both chemically treated groups compared with that in the untreated group. The acetate produced from AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated, AHP-treated and untreated groups were 2851.5, 2635.0 and 1531.5 mg/L, respectively, after 18 days of anaerobic digestion. Increasing VFA (acetate) production is an encouraging route for biomethane enhancement (Ali et al., 2019a; Guo et al., 2015). The highest acetate concentration was obtained from the AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated group, which was 7.5% and 47% higher than the acetate concentrations of the AHP-treated and untreated groups, respectively. The AHP-treated group had a 41.5% larger acetate production than the untreated group. Acetic acid, isobutyrate and butyrate are crucial fatty acids that improve methane production (Wang et al., 2014). The methane generation efficiency of the AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated group was noticeably higher because its acetate quantity was higher than the other groups. Acetogens, such as Clostridia class and the Bacteroidaceae family, convert the initial fermentation products to acetate via the CO2 reducing pathway with acetyl-CoA synthase as key enzyme (Guo et al., 2015). About 20 bacterial genera contain hindered acetogenic species (Ragsdale and Pierce, 2008)."
11,Pretreatment impact on methane yield,"3.4 Pretreatment impact on methane yield The cumulative methane yields of the treated and untreated groups for 24 days are shown in Fig. 6 . The yields were steady and smooth for 0–13 days, then suddenly escalated on the 18th day and became stable until the 26th day. The cumulative methane yields of the untreated, AHP-treated and AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated groups until the last minute were 190.9 ± 6.3, 286.41 ± 8.1 and 318.6 ± 17.85 mL/g VS, respectively. Both treated groups generated more methane than the untreated group, and the marginal difference was substantial. The maximum yield was exhibited by the AHP-LiCl/DMA-treated group, which is 40.08% larger than the untreated group, followed by the AHP-treated group (33.34%). The cumulative methane yield of the AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated group was 10.10% higher than the AHP-treated group. These results showed that the ionic solvent LiCl/DMAc enhanced cellulose dissolution and improved enzymatic saccharification in fermentative bacteria without structural modifications (Han et al., 2019). Biomethane (278.7 mL/g VS) was generated from hydrogen peroxide-treated Miscanthus floridulous (Katukuri et al., 2017). Biomethane (270 mL/g VS) was also generated from CS in aerobic conditions (Xu et al., 2018). However, the biomethane production using different chemical pretreatment methods (Sun et al., 2015; Michalsk and Ledakowicz, 2014; Ramadoss and Muthukumar, 2015; Shen et al., 2014) were less efficient than the biomethane production in the current study. Methanogens are the key microbes for methane generation, which is the final step in anaerobic digestion for biomethanation. Phylogenetically, methanogens are a broad diversified group affiliated to Archaea. Based on taxonomic analysis, methanogens are categorised into five orders, including Methanosarcinales, Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales, Methanococcales and Methanopyrales. Two genera among these order were classified as methanogens, namely, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, which remarkably use acetate as precursor for methanogenesis (Ali et al., 2019b). Methanosaeta is a specialist for acetate conversion in biomethane using kinase and reductase enzymes, wereas Methanosarcina has been less specific in the acetoclastic pathway because of the use of acetate, methylamine, methanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide for biomethanation (Liu et al., 2008)."
12,Mass balance for pretreatment and biomethanation,"3.5 Mass balance for pretreatment and biomethanation Fig. 7 shows the schematic illustration of the mass balance of CS composition as a result of AHP and AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatments and the biomethanation process. Approximately 54.85 g of total residues, which comprised 38.05 g of cellulose, 9.28 g of hemicellulose and 01.67 g of AB lignin, were retrieved after AHP pretreatment from 100 g of CS. The sum total glucose concentration, acetate concentration and methane yield of the AHP-pretreated CS on the 20th day of anaerobic digestion were 230.82 mg/100 g CS, 14.66 g/100 g CS and 28.641 L/100 g, respectively. The constituents of AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated CS (52.45 g) were 38.45 g cellulose, 8.30 g hemicellulose and 01.10 g AB lignin. Its sum total glucose concentration was 261.65 mg/100 g CS; its acetate concentration was 15.95 g/100 g CS; and its methane yield was 31.86 L/100 g on the 20th day of anaerobic digestion. Adding LiCl/DMAc had minute consequences compared with the AHP-treated samples but greatly enhanced glucose and methane yields, and improved the bioconversion rate from the amorphous region of cellulose than crystalline cellulose. Our results supports the statement that hydrolysis rate is enhanced in the presence of hydrogen bond in cellulose (Chundawat et al., 2011). However, amorphous cellulose was detected as an extensive part of AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated CS. The substrates were rendered favourable for degradation by removing the recalcitrant and reconstructing the hydrogen bond using AHP-LiCl/DMAc. The purpose was to maximize the yield of reducing sugars and enhance methane generation with low expenses. LiCl/DMAc is less costly than other ionic solvents, but its recovery process is extremely expensive (Morgenstern and Kammer, 1996). Dupont (American company), which was initially involved in thebiotechnology and manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, declared an overcoming recovery technology for recycling these ionic solution through the chloroform separation strategy, which has an achievable economic potential (Turbak, 2001). In addition, adapting novel methodologies, such as the AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment strategy, are important in restoring and recycling ionic solvents. Alcohol could be utilised instead of H2O2 (solvent-free) in the regeneration process, where it can be easily recovered after precipitate elimination from the pretreatment system (Seoud et al., 2000), and subsequently, the ionic solvent can be reprocessed and reutilised for pretreatment strategy. In addition, there are certain positive effects of these pretreatment methods on functional communities to different ions, such as Fe from Fenton-based oxidation model. The Fenton reaction mechanism is a non-selective degradation procedure originated from reducing and oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (OH·) produce during the splitting of AHP in the presence of Fe2+ ions (Fe2+ + H2O2 + H+ → Fe3+ + OH· + H2O). The Fe3+ could be converted again to Fe2+ (Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + HO·2 + H+). The higher concentration of these radicals enters in further reaction: (Fe2+ + HO· → Fe3+ + OH‒), and (H2O2 + HO· → H2O + HO·2), and converted into natural radical scavengers (Ali et al., 2020). Furthermore, the Fenton's reaction's significance is its low cost, and easy availability to boost up the pretreatment approach in anaerobic fermentation process."
13,Conclusions,"The biomethane potential of CS was promptly improved through the sequential treatment of AHP and LiCl/DMAc. AHP-treated CS can be thoroughly disintegrated in LiCl/DMAc solvent. Our findings revealed that AHP-LiCl/DMAc pretreatment improved the accumulative methane yield by forceful delignification and the effective destruction of cellulose. A maximum methane yield of 318.6 ± 17.85 mL/g VS was obtained in the AHP-LiCl/DMAc-treated group, which was 40.08% and 10.10% higher than the methane yields of the untreated and AHP-treated groups, respectively. This finding shows that the ionic solvent LiCl/DMAc enhanced cellulose dissolution and improved enzymatic saccharification in fermentative bacteria without structural modifications. Glucose yield, acetate content and biomethanation were enhanced by the combined pretreatment strategy through practical delignification and the restructuring of the crystalline region of cellulose. Overall, this investigation contributes an encouraging pretreatment approach for the potential degradation of CS into fermentable sugars and for biomethanation."
