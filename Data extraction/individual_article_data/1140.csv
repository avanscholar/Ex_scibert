0,Introduction,"Semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted enormous attention due to their effective utilization of solar light to cause a photocatalytic reaction [1]. Since Fujishima and Honda's work on water splitting [2], a variety of photocatalysts have been developed and used in a wide range of reactions such as the production of green fuels (hydrogen or light chemicals) [3], CO2 reduction [4], oxidation of hydrocarbons [5], and organic synthesis [6]. Despite the aforementioned applications, these materials have their inherent limitations. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a photoactive semiconductor has attracted remarkable attention due to its remarkable properties [7]. However, pure g-C3N4 same as any other photocatalyst suffers from defects such as low range of visible light absorption, low visible-light harvesting, and fast recombination of electron-hole [8]. To overcome the challenges that g-C3N4 faces, there are four main strategies which consist of doping metal or non-metal elements [9], using copolymerization [10], construction of heterojunctions with semiconductors, carbon nanomaterials, or polymers [11–13], and dye-sensitization [14]. The unique structural properties of g-C3N4 such as the primary and secondary amine groups that can be manipulated to make covalent hybrids [15], the capability of hydrogen-bond motif formation [16], and coordination of the heptazine units to metal ions [17] enable scientists to take advantage of these strategies. Among these methods, the dye-sensitization process is applied when a photocatalyst is either inactive or less active in the visible region of sunlight [18]. The dye-sensitization process often refers to immobilization of a dye on a semiconductor [19]. Covalently attachment of a well-suited dye to a semiconductor will promote stability and photocatalytic performance of fabricated photocatalysts [20]. Covalently bonded nature of dye-semiconductor hybrids influences the structure, which leads to changes in the electronic structure [19]. For instance, Erythrosine B immobilized on g-C3N4 displayed a greater hydrogen evolution rate compared to the bare g-C3N4 or a mixture of them [20]. Many of porphyrins and phthalocyanines are also investigated for dye semiconductor hybrids. Lu et al. reported that a zinc-phthalocyanine complex attached to g-C3N4 has superior performance in the photodegradation of Rhodamine B dye [21]. In addition, porphyrin functionalized g-C3N4 has been studied by Chen and co-workers, in which the porphyrin/g-C3N4 nanoparticles operate as an effective water-soluble nanoprobe for photodynamic therapy [22]. Rose Bengal (RB) in the beginning has been celebrated as an organic dye for dyeing cotton fabrics, but later, further aspects of this magical dye were discovered. RB acts as a photostable sensitizer with a high quantum yield for the singlet oxygen (1O2) generation [23]. The purpose of this study was to immobilize RB covalently at the edges of CN and CCN to improve the photostability of RB and enhance the photocatalytic activity. Actually, the existence of binding sites as a characteristic of intact g-C3N4 is a self-assistance for attachment of various photosensitizers. The uncondensed amine groups of carbon nitride are complementary to carboxylate substituent. However, the photo-dehalogenation of RB is inevitable [18], but chemical incorporation of RB into the support structure could decelerate the rate of degradation [20,24]. It's a win–win outcome for both components. An enhanced Photostabilization of the dye is achieved, while on the other side, a low absorption in the visible light region as the inherent weakness of g-C3N4 has been resolved up to a certain level by the RB conjugation. The prepared catalysts presented greater photocatalytic performance toward oxidation of benzyl alcohol compared to the bare RB, CN, CCN, or a mixture of them."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Rose Bengal and methanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Urea, triethylamine (TEA), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), benzyl alcohol, ammonium thiocyanate, and silica gel were obtained from Merck. Acetonitrile, ethanol, thionyl chloride, and nitric acid were provided from Daejung. The characterization methods and related apparatuses are described in the supporting information."
3,Catalysts preparation,"2.2 Catalysts preparation 2.2.1 Preparation of g-C3N4 (CN) 30 g urea in an alumina crucible was placed inside a furnace. In an hour, the temperature reached up to 550 °C, and it was maintained for an additional 3 h [25]. The obtained pale yellow powder is abbreviated as CN (view Fig. S1). 2.2.2 Preparation of carboxylated g-C3N4 (CCN) 1 g of CN was added to 100 mL nitric acid (5 M) and then refluxed at 125 °C for 24 h. The colloidal suspension was washed with distilled water until pH reached 7. The resultant powder dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven [26]. Finally, the carboxylated g-C3N4 (CCN) was obtained. 2.2.3 Preparation of RB/g-C3N4 hybrid (RB–CN) 150 mg RB was dried in vacuum and transferred into a two-necked round bottom flask. 20 mL thionyl chloride was gently added to RB and it was allowed to cool to room temperature, since pouring thionyl chloride into RB caused an exothermic reaction [27]. The reaction mixture was refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere, and then thionyl chloride was distilled under vacuum. RB-acyl chloride was thoroughly dried under vacuum. Next, 150 mg CN was dried in a high vacuum, added to 20 mL dry DMF, and sonicated at 500 W for 2 h. The obtained mixture along with 2 mL triethylamine was added to RB-acyl chloride, and then the mixture was refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere at 130 °C for 72 h. Upon completion, the mixture was poured into 300 mL diethyl ether to precipitate the product. Since some of RB molecules were adsorbed on the CN sheets, the obtained solid was sonicated in methanol several times to remove the physisorbed species. After that, the solid was washed with methanol and ethanol to remove the residue. To remove triethylamine hydrochloride salt, the solid was washed with deionized water [28]. The obtained red-brown powder (RB–CN) was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C (Fig. S1). 2.2.4 Preparation of RB/carboxylated g-C3N4 hybrid (RB–CCN) Firstly, 80 mL thionyl chloride along with 3.5 mL DMF was added to the dry CCN powder. The mixture was refluxed at 70 °C for 24 h. The excess thionyl chloride was removed by distillation at a reduced pressure. CCN-acyl chloride was dried under vacuum by purging nitrogen into the system. After that, 150 mg RB was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 20 mL of DMF. The RB solution with 2 mL triethylamine was added to the CCN-acyl chloride produced in the first stage. The reaction was refluxed at 130 °C for 72 h under nitrogen atmosphere [28]. The final product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and named RB–CCN."
4,Computational details,"2.3 Computational details The optimized structures, frontier molecular orbitals, and the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps (H-L energy gap) of CN (a monolayer of three heptazine units), RB (disodium salt), and RB–CN were obtained using Gaussian 09 program [29] at DFT/B3PW91 level [30–33]. The 6–31 + G (d) basis set was employed for all atoms except iodine atom, while the LANL2DZ effective-core potential was applied to the iodine atom. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) was applied to stimulate the solvent (acetonitrile) effects. Visualization of some of the HOMOs and LUMOs was performed using Multiwfn software [34]."
5,Photocatalytic activity,"2.4 Photocatalytic activity The catalytic tests were performed in a cylindrically shaped vial using a CFL 60 W lamp as the irradiation source, which was fixed at 2.5 cm away from the vial. An oxygen balloon was put on the vial to supply sufficient oxygen during the oxidation reaction. For the first test, 1 mg of the photocatalyst with 0.1 mmol benzyl alcohol and 3 equivalent of ammonium thiocyanate (23 mg) was added into 2 mL acetonitrile. The resulting mixture was irradiated for 10 h by purging oxygen into the system (Scheme 1 ). Next, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to recover the catalyst and remove the yellow-orange polymer known as polythiocyanogen [35]. Silica gel column chromatography with hexane/ethyl acetate mixture was applied to purify the solution. Finally, the purified solution was analyzed by GC–MS."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Synthesis route,"3.1 Synthesis route Attachment of RB to CN was accomplished by the activation of the sodium carboxylate functional group of RB. Acyl chloride is a highly labile intermediate and will easily react with the primary or secondary amines at the edges of CN, which generates the amide bonds (Scheme 2 ). In contrast, the RB–CCN fabrication was achieved via the conversion of carboxylic acid groups of CCN to the corresponding acyl halide. As a result, this acyl halide was expected to react with the phenoxide group of RB to form an ester bond (Scheme 3 )."
8,Assessment of photocatalytic activity,"3.2 Assessment of photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic performance of the catalysts was evaluated by selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The RB immobilized on the supports, along with ammonium thiocyanate as a promoter, improve the selectivity through a photocatalytic mechanism. In the beginning, a certain amount of each prepared catalyst (1 mg) with RB (5 mg) was introduced to a mixture of solvent, benzyl alcohol, and promoter. The conversion of benzyl alcohol, the selectivity of benzaldehyde, and the benzaldehyde yield were calculated by equations (1) to (3), respectively: (1) Conversion(%)=((C0–CBA)/C0)) × 100 (2) Selectivity(%)=((CBAL/(C0–CBA)) × 100 (3) Yield(%) = CBAL/C0×100 where C0: initial concentration of benzyl alcohol CBA: concentration of benzyl alcohol CBAL: concentration of benzaldehyde The results are summarized in Table 1 . The CN and CCN samples display low catalytic activity even in the presence of the promoter (entries 3–6, Table 1), while RB illustrates a moderate yield of 50% in the presence of NH4SCN (entry 2, Table 1). The hybrid catalysts (entries 11 and 12, Table 1) are more effective for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol compared to the mixture of RB and CN or CCN (entries 7 and 8, Table 1). After the examination of the catalysts, RB–CCN was selected due to the highest yield of benzaldehyde production (84%). Several parameters, including the amount of RB–CCN, the equivalent of NH4SCN, and irradiation time, were chosen to be optimized. Various amounts of the hybrid were considered (entries 1, 2, 3, and 4, Table 2 ) and 1 mg of RB-CCN hybrid showed the maximum conversion. Therefore, it was selected as optimum RB–CCN weight. The amount of photocatalyst (RB–CCN) is defined as a parameter should be surveyed in several ways. The amount of heterogeneous catalyst can affect the catalytic activity. The use of excess catalyst can increase the reaction rate and cause byproduct formation or decomposition of the main products. The amount of RB–CCN is a determining factor in the production of singlet oxygen, superoxide, or hydroxyl species pushing forward the oxidation reaction to form the acid. The agglomeration of particles at concentrations more than the optimum weight of catalyst is a phenomenon tend to decrease the exposed surface area of the catalyst active sites. To optimize the ammonium thiocyanate equivalent, three additional measurements were performed and the optimum equivalent was achieved (entries 1, 5, 6, and 7, Table 2). The concentration of NH4SCN has a saturation limit meaning when the thiocyanate radicals reach that point, they will combine together and deactivate. The promoter in excess (more than optimum amount) doesn’t affect the yield of the reaction. The optimization of the reaction (irradiation) time is necessary since the catalyst loses its initial performance over time. After 15 h of exposure to CFL lamp irradiation, the conversion isn’t changed considerably relative to 10 h. RB an organic dye (xanthene) is susceptible to the photodegradation by CCN [36], due to this, its photostability and overall photocatalytic performance were evaluated by recycling the RB–CCN hybrid at the optimized condition. To accomplish this, in five sequential cycles, the catalyst was reused and after each run was washed with a mixture of ethanol/deionized water (1:1) and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. After five cycles, the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst is almost preserved (Fig. 1 )."
9,Photophysical properties,"3.3 Photophysical properties The IR absorption bands at 810 and 889 cm−1 of g-C3N4 are related to the breathing mode of the heptazine units and out of plane bending vibrations, respectively. The bands at 1236, 1315, 1405, 1571, and 1638 cm−1 are assigned to the C–N and C = N stretching vibrations. The broad band between 3200 and 3500 cm−1 is representative of the primary amines at the terminal edges, uncondensed secondary amines, and water adsorbed on the surface [37]. The IR spectrum of the carboxylated g-C3N4 (CCN) possesses all g-C3N4 bands with a shoulder at 1695 cm−1 due to the C = O stretching vibration of carboxylic acid (Fig. 2 ). The RB aromatic ring has stretching vibration bands at 1340, 1449, 1492, and 1546 cm−1. The bands at 1235 and 1044 cm−1 are related to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C–O–C. The carboxylate carbonyl band is at 1612 cm−1. Also, the bands around 400 to 800 cm−1 are due to the C–Cl and C–I vibrations [38–40]. Two bands at 2853 and 2924 cm−1 are likely the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of C–H. The reaction of RB with thionyl chloride results in the appearance of a new band at 1779 cm−1, which is related to the carbonyl group of acyl chloride. This new band proves the formation of RB-acyl chloride [27] ( Fig. S2 ). Although the IR spectrum of RB in the main regions overlaps with the spectra of g-C3N4 and carboxylated g-C3N4 (CCN)), there are some evidences for the existence of RB in the hybrids. It can be clearly seen that the vibrations of C–H bonds of RB are still observed in the IR spectra of the hybrids (Fig. 2). The expected stretching and bending vibrations of amide carbonyl in RB-CN cannot be observed due to the overlap with the strong bands of tri-s-triazine units [27,41,42]. The vibration band of carbonyl group in − COOH at 1695 cm−1 is shifted to a higher frequency (1710 cm−1) in the RB–CCN spectrum, which suggests that the carboxylic acid groups are converted into ester groups. The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded in DMF due to a better dispersion of the hybrids and the supports (Fig. 3 ). RB has an intense absorption peak at 564 nm and a shorter band at a higher energy (524 nm). The intense red color of RB is due to the quinoid chromophore ring along with the phenoxide and carboxylate functionalities acting as auxochrome groups. This sharp peak is attributed to the π → π* transition [43]. The absorption peaks corresponding to the CN and CCN supports are at 324 and 276 nm, respectively, which are assigned to the π → π* transition of the heptazine units [44]. The conjugation of RB to the supports causes a moderate blue-shift in its main absorption peak, while the peaks attributed to the CN and CCN supports have slightly red-shifted (14 and 6 nm, respectively). RB is a p-type semiconductor and an efficient photosensitizer [45], therefore, it plays a crucial role in two different paths. As a p-type dye alongside an n-type CN (or CCN), there would be a p-n heterojunction. The creation of a p-n heterojunction avoids the recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs [46]. At the same time, RB, as a photosensitizer, promotes the light harvesting efficiency and activity of CN (or CCN) in the visible region of the solar spectrum in a dye-sensitization process (surface photosensitization). The UV–Vis absorption spectra of CN, CCN, RB, RB–CN, and RB–CCN obtained from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) are shown in Fig. 4 . Both CN and CCN exhibit an absorption edge lower than 450 nm, which leads to the intrinsic weakness of these photocatalysts that are not able to operate efficiently in the visible light range. While both RB-CN and RB-CCN display a broad absorption peak around 540 nm, which is related to the conjugation with RB. Fig. 5 displays the Tauc plot of the samples. The band gap of the hybrids is decreased compared to the bare RB, CN, and CCN. The absorption edges of the hybrids are shifted to a higher wavelength at 648 nm, which is related to a band gap of 1.96 eV.Fig. 6. The samples were excited at 360 nm to survey the electronic interactions of the hybrids in the excited state [47]. The maximum emission wavelength of CN is observed at 458 nm. The emission peak of CCN demonstrates a blue-shift by 22 nm, which confirms a greater band gap of CCN [48]. The excitation of the hybrids results in intense quenching, which shows the strong electronic interaction between RB and CN (or CCN). This phenomenon hinders the recombination of electron-hole pairs, which helps to improve the charge separation and eventually, the enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency [49]. One possible mechanism for this luminescence quenching is the photo-induced charge transfer from the excited singlet state of RB to the supports [28]."
10,Elemental analysis,"3.4 Elemental analysis The elemental analysis data are collected in Table 3 . The samples were dried in 100 °C for 24 h and 4 mg of each one was combusted at 1150 °C in pure oxygen. In RB–CN, the nitrogen content is reduced to 10.18% relative to the CN sample due to the lack of nitrogen found in RB, whereas the carbon and hydrogen contents are increased. In CCN, due to the oxidation by acid treatment, a higher oxygen content is observed compared to CN (6.27%). In RB–CCN, the nitrogen content is also decreased."
11,FE-SEM and TEM images,"3.5 FE-SEM and TEM images The morphology of the samples was investigated by FE-SEM. Fig. 7 a demonstrates that the bulk g-C3N4 (CN) is composed of 2D slate-like layers. In CCN, due to the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface and the edges, the layers are denser packed, as shown in Fig. 7 b. By the attachment of RB to CCN, the morphology of the sheets is preserved (Fig. 7 d). The EDX-mapping images of RB–CN and the RB–CCN are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . Based on the elemental mapping, besides nitrogen and carbon as the main elements of the supports (i.e., CN and CCN), Cl and I elements are contributed by RB. It is also observed that Cl and I atoms of RB are homogeneously dispersed on CN and CCN. According to the EDX elemental analysis, in Fig. 9, oxygen accounts for more than 22% of the chemical composition of RB–CCN. The average C/O weight ratio in RB–CN is 5.58, while the respective ratio in RB–CCN is 1.14. The TEM images of CN, CCN, RB–CN, and RB–CCN are presented separately in Fig. 10 . CN consists of stacking flat platelet like particles, whereas RB–CN is composed of porous thinner sheets. The microstructure of CCN displays stacked graphitic layers similar to what was observed in the FE-SEM images. After the fixation of RB on CCN, the sheets are torn apart and slightly separated from each other, so that they form irregularly shaped sheets."
12,XRD characterization,"3.6 XRD characterization The X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared samples are depicted in Fig. 11 . Two peaks can be seen for CN at 2θ = 13.1 and 27.4°, which are attributed to the (100) plane of the inter-layer structural packing and the (002) plane of the graphitic-like layers, respectively [37]. In CCN with 2θ = 27.8°, the interlayer distance is decreased due to the presence of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the surface and edges. The hydrogen bond formation through these functional groups causes the layers to move closer to each other [48,50]. An additional point to note is that the interlayer distance of the hybrids (RB-CN and RB-CCN) is almost same as their bare supports (CN and CCN)."
13,Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA),"3.7 Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) The thermal stability of the samples was investigated by TGA analysis (Fig. 12 ). CN starts to lose weight from 470 °C, and it accelerates until the maximum weight loss is observed at 735 °C. RB–CN shows a similar thermal behavior, but the initial decomposition temperature (Tonset) is 370 °C. Whereas, Tonset of RB is 280 °C. The thermal stability of RB is improved through a covalent linkage to the CN support. The TGA analysis gives an understanding of the RB–CN covalent nature. Assuming that RB is adsorbed on CN, the beginning of RB thermal decomposition must be around 280 °C or slightly higher, however, there is no degradation until 370 °C. It implies that RB is covalently linked to the CN sheets, which can be considered as a unified structure. For CCN, two steps of thermal decomposition exist, as shown in Fig. 12. The first stage is attributed to the removal of the carboxylic groups and CO2 release [51]. The second stage is due to the thermal decomposition of heptazine based structure [52]. RB–CCN decomposes in three steps. The initial weight loss from 30 to 130 °C is due to the removal of the adsorbed water. The second weight loss from 220 to 530 °C is presumably due to the unreacted carboxyl residues. Finally, the decomposition of graphitic sheets takes place by the elimination of heptazine rings."
14,Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms,"3.8 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms The nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis was employed to obtain the BET surface area and pore diameter of the samples (Fig. 13 ). The samples have a type IV isotherm corresponding to a mesoporous material with a H3 hysteresis loop [53]. This loop confirms the aggregation of plate-like particles and formation of slit-shaped pores [54]. The immobilization of RB brings a decrease in the specific surface areas of the supports (Table 4 ).Table 5. In addition, Table S1 summarizes several published articles and compares them to our results. The morphology of C3N4 is almost similar in all catalysts. The comparison of the pure g-C3N4 and its modified form in Table S1 shows that the surface area of a catalyst is an effective parameter in the conversion percentage, but no direct relation can be found between the selectivity and surface area (or shape). In general, the pure g-C3N4 (entries 1, 3, and 9 in Table S1) with a low surface area compared to its modified forms (with greater surface areas in entries 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 in Table S1) acts as a selective catalyst in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, although, the conversion is low. In comparison, the metal doped C3N4 catalysts are much more active towards the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. The addition of various metals as the co-catalysts improves the selectivity to benzaldehyde (entries 4 and 7 in Table S1). Nevertheless, our modified and metal free g-C3N4 based catalysts show high performances for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (entries 16 and 17 in Table S1)"
15,Mechanism of the oxidation reaction,"3.9 Mechanism of the oxidation reaction In the case of RB, along with NH4SCN as the promoter, the detailed mechanism was described by Pradeep Singh et al. [35]. Upon the photoexcitation, the RB's singlet ground state is transformed into its excited one, then the intersystem crossing (ISC) generates an excited triplet state (3RB*). A single-electron transfer between 3RB* and thiocyanate anion generates an RB radical anion (RB•−) and a thiocyanate radical (SCN•) (Fig. 14 ). Next, the RB•− radical anion is relaxed to its ground state and the thiocyanate radical is captured a benzylic hydrogen from benzyl alcohol. In the next step, the resultant radical is reacted with oxygen to produce benzaldehyde. The oxidation mechanism in the presence of CN and CCN was reported by Wang et al [55]. The relaxation of RB in the first mechanism is generated a superoxide radical anion (O2 •−), which likely participates in the oxidation mechanism in the presence of CN (or CCN). The two mechanisms operate independently and result in an increase of the reaction yield. In addition, a higher potential of photogenerated valence band holes (+1.4 V vs. NHE) [55] in CN and CCN can oxidize SCN− to SCN• (E·SCN/SCN – = +0.85 V vs. NHE) [35]. As a result, besides RB and the support cooperation, we observed that the SCN− anion plays a synergistic role with CN in the photoredox reaction in the absence of RB, which increases the actual yield of the oxidation reaction. The oxidation potential of the excited state of RB is −1.33 V (vs. NHE), while the oxidation potential of the ground state is 0.83 V [56]. The higher energy level of the excited state of RB initiates the transfer of electrons from the excited singlet state to the conduction band of CN (-1.30 V vs. NHE) [55].Fig. 15."
16,Theoretical calculations,"3.10 Theoretical calculations To view the combination between the molecular orbitals of RB and CN, a small part of a CN sheet containing three tri-s-triazine units (forming a cavity in nanosheets), is used. Figs. S3 and 15 show the optimized structures of RB, CN, and RB-CN in their ground electronic states in the gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases, respectively. As demonstrated, the RB moiety in the optimized structure of RB–CN folds on the supported CN nanosheet. The calculated H-L energy gap of RB–CN is lower than both RB and CN, which confirms the trend of the experimental data obtained from the DRS spectrum (Figs. 16 and S4). As shown in Fig. 16 , the HOMO of RB-CN is composed by the RB moiety and is primarily π in character in the solvent phase. The DFT calculations reveal that the localization of LUMO on RB-CN differs from what was seen in HOMO. A relatively significant contribution to the LUMO orbitals is also clear from the CN part. This shows that there is a probability of the electron excitation in RB from its HOMO to the LUMO of the CN moiety, which leads to additional photocatalytic activity of RB–CN compared to the bare CN nanosheet due to the prolonged lifetime of the excited electron. These results have a direct relation with the oxidation reaction mechanism, which both parts of RB-CN are involved in the reaction. It is crucial to note the following points: (a) The lower energy of LUMO of CN compared to RB is not a necessary condition for the transition of an electron from LUMO of RB to LUMO of CN. The LUMOs of RB and CN have energy levels close together, therefore, this causes mixing of the LUMOs and distributing the electron density on both RB and CN. (b) Our calculations predict a higher H-L energy gap for the CN nanosheet compared to its experimental value. This energy gap can be reduced by increasing the number of tri-s-triazine units as the elemental building blocks, as investigated by Zhai et al. [57] To obtain further insight on the electronic structure of the hybrid, the five highest occupied orbitals (HOMO –4 to HOMO) and the five lowest unoccupied orbitals (LUMO to LUMO + 4) of RB–CN were acquired (Fig. 17 ). Clearly in RB–CN, the RB moiety contributes more to the HOMO and less in the LUMO. The excitation will result in the localization of the LUMO on the CN sheet. According to the UV–Vis spectrum of RB–CN (Fig. 4), it explains the activity of RB–CN at both higher and lower wavelengths."
17,Stability test,"3.11 Stability test The kinetic of oxidation reaction through plotting the conversion percentage vs. time is displayed in Fig. 18 . Using the linear regression to fit the data shows that the photocatalytic reaction follows a first-order kinetics for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. From the kinetic plot of ln (Ct/C0) vs. time (Fig. 19 ) and comparing the rate constants, it can be observed that the efficiency of the catalyst decreases quite slowly. The slow deactivation of RB–CCN can be explained by the enhanced stability of RB moiety due to the strong linkage between RB and the functionalities in the support. Owing to the nature of the covalently linked network with the catalytic sites, the catalyst maintains its structure well and allows for a robust recycling capability with well-retained activity up to five cycles. To evaluate the photostability of the dye attached to CCN, extra analyses, including SEM and EDX, were conducted for the fresh and used catalyst to monitor how much of RB will degrade or leach. The elemental analysis (from EDX) and SEM were utilized to evaluate and compare the changes in the structure of the fresh and used catalyst. After 50 h of irradiation, the weight percentage of iodine and chlorine was decreased, showing RB is still present in the hybrid structure, but its content is reduced as expected. The structure and morphology of the hybrid are retained well, which follows the durability of the catalyst (see Figs. S16 and S17)."
18,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,"3.12 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS experiments were carried out to investigate the covalent interaction between RB and CN. The deconvoluted XP spectra of C 1 s for CN, RB, and RB-CN are shown in Fig. 20 . The main peaks of C 1s at 284.8 (C–C) and 288.2 eV (N–C = N) representing CN, remain dominant in RB–CN. The O 1 s spectra of the samples show mostly contributions from C–O/C = O (Fig. S18). The N 1s signal of CN consists of three components located at 399.0, 402.0, and 404.5 eV attributed to the sp 2-bonded nitrogen, the bridging nitrogen connected to tri-s-triazine rings, and the uncondensed amino groups, respectively. Further, the N 1s signal of RB–CN (Fig. 21 ) demonstrates a peak at 401.1 eV, which proves the amidation reaction [21,49]."
19,Conclusion,"In summary, two dye-sensitized semiconductor hybrids based on carbon nitride (C3N4) were designed and synthesized through the construction of covalent bonding. Two C3N4-based supports are used herein, including pure g-C3N4 (CN) and carboxylated g-C3N4 (CCN). The loading of Rose Bengal (RB) is a significant factor that affects the efficiency of the photocatalytic activity. The covalent bonds formed between RB and the support (CN or CCN) boost the electron transfer process compared to the adsorbed RB on the support surface. By applying the hybrids in room temperature, benzyl alcohol was converted to benzaldehyde with high yields and high selectivity using O2 and SCN− as the oxidant and the promoter, respectively. Among the hybrids, RB–CCN catalyzed the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol with a higher conversion than RB–CN, which could be due to its higher surface area. The characterization of RB in the hybrids was obtained from CHNS, SEM-EDX, TEM, DRS, and FT-IR analyses. The elevated efficiency of the catalysts can be attributed to multiple factors, such as p-n heterojunction, which brings charge separation, expanded light harvesting due to the presence of RB as a visible-light responsive dye, and raise of the electronic interaction through a covalent attachment. In addition, the computational details indicated that the HOMO orbitals are localized on the RB moiety, while a significant contribution to the LUMO is composed by the CN support. The spectacular optical properties of these hybrids make them excellent candidates for the accomplishment of various organic reactions, photodynamic therapy, and photodegradation of pollutants."
