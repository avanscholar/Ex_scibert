0,Introduction,"In the recent past, the research and development of inexpensive, earth-abundant, and effective electrode solids are worth innovative electrochemical applications. The rising energy-related demand, environmental pollution and decreasing fossil fuel resources need clean and maintainable energy conversion and storage setups. In particular, environmental water pollution because water is the most important for public life and production. In this case, hydrogen peroxide is a significant chemical these days because this chemical is used in various fields frequently such as fields are mineral process, clinical laboratory, food process, pharmaceuticals, environmental analysis, textile industries, bleaching agent in the paper and pulp industries, oxidizing agent in research, disinfect and antiseptic agents, etc (Chen et al., 2013; Khorablou et al., 2021). In addition, this hydrogen peroxide is the by-product in some biochemical oxidase reaction events such as oxalate oxidase, lactate oxidase, lysine oxidase, urate oxidase, ammonic acid oxidase, alcohol oxidase, glutamate oxidase, etc (Chen et al., 2012). Therefore, hydrogen peroxide sensing is important for academic and industrial purposes, so the researchers recently focus on developing more accuracy with low-cost electrochemical sensors. Hence, there is a huge need and task to attain high electrocatalytic activity with highly innovative electrode solids. It is well-documented that oxides of transition metals have been extensively employed in sensors as electrode materials, and oxide of ruthenium element is known as the best electrode solid owing to its highly conducting nature with huge pseudocapacitance (Kang et al., 2014; Wang, 2006). Though this material is costly, toxicity has sited enormous hindrances for producing it on a huge scale. Hence, much research and development have been focused on finding out substitute electrode solids for electrochemical sensor usages. In a recent scenario, the layer structured molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) has been considered as some substitute electrode materials in storing the energy due to its high theoretic capacity of ~1005 C/g. Nevertheless, it possesses lower conductivity and restricted electrochemical reaction kinetics; its extensive use is very limited. The different forms of MoO3 like 1D and 2D nano-systems display consistent/reliable electrochemical characteristics compare to bulk counterparts owing to higher surface-volume proportion and electrical conductivity (Prakash et al., 2018). So, the development of MoO3 in several forms along with 1D/2D nanostructures of diverse morphologies/shapes like nanoparticles (NPs), nanoflowers (NWLs), nanoplates (NPLs), nanobelts (NBLs), nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs), nanosheets (NSs), nanotubes (NTs), etc. is in process. Moreover, as MoO3 exists in 3-different oxidation states it can eagerly contribute to redox reactions and show outstanding electrical conductivity. Hence, MoO3 NPs can function as better electron redox intermediaries and efficiently contribute to the sensing of H2O2. Along with supercapacitive usages the MoO3 in different forms, it is also highly applicable in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection as reported by several researchers like Rashmi et al. developed MoO3 NPs via combustion process using leaf powder and investigated their H2O2 detection performance (Rashmi et al., 2020), Zhao et al. prepared the graphene/CNT/MoO3 nanocomposites and studied them as a non-enzymatic H2O2 sensor (Zhao et al., 2017), Sharma et al. reported the α-MoO3-x nanoflakes synthesis for detecting the H2O2 in biological fluids (Sharma et al., 2018), Wei et al. investigated the H2O2 detection capability of α-MoO3 (Wei et al., 2018), Zhong et al. documented the H2O2 detection through quantum dots of MoO3-x (Zhong et al., 2020), etc. These reports clearly displayed that the properties of MoO3 are highly dependent on the morphology/shape of the prepared nanostructures as it is an anisotropic material that can have diverse crystallographic axis during the synthesis using different routes and growth rates and still a challenging task for the scientist working on this material. Morphology dependent properties of several materials are reported in literature like Ma et al. reported the hydrothermal route for developing the Ni0·85Se with different morphologies and noticed its high performance as an electrochemical device for flower-like shape (Ma et al., 2017), Zhang et al. documented the synthesis of Honeycomb & microrod like NiMoO4 as electrodes (Zhang et al., 2020), Li et al. reported the battery performance of VS4 dependent on morphologies (Li et al., 2020), Zhang et al. prepared ZnHCF with diverse morphologies via co-precipitation route electrochemical applications (Zhang et al., 2015), Abi Jaoude et al. hydrothermally developed the MnO2/G and fully-investigated the electrode performance based on diverse morphologies (Jaoude et al., 2020), etc. Hence these reports reveal that the electrochemical activities of materials are improvable with the development of electrode materials with suitable morphology/shape/structures, and developing a good electrochemical sensor with asymmetries is a significant route. Based on the thorough literature of MoO3 based electrodes, we noticed that there is no report on its morphology-dependent electrochemical sensing performance so far. Hence, herein we aimed to develop diverse morphologies of MoO3 through three different routes, and a comparative study on its detailed electrochemical sensing activities is presented here and discussed."
1,Experiential procedure,"The source materials used for the preparation of MoO3 nanostructures are ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24･4H2O), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), succinic acid (C4H6O4), ammonia solution (NH4OH), and ethanol (C2H5OH) purchased from Merck chemicals. Deionized (DI) water has been used throughout the experiment."
2,Chemical precipitation (CP)–MoO3 synthesis,"2.1 Chemical precipitation (CP)–MoO3 synthesis The chemical precipitation technique was used to prepared the MoO3 cubic sheet-like structure. To synthesize the MoO3 nanostructure 0.1 M of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT) was used to prepare the AMT solution in 50 ml of DI water. Also, 3.5 ml of HCl was drop-wise added in AMT solution, which is stirred at the ambient temperature for 48 h. After the precipitation, the product was obtained, which product was washed several times with DI water and ethanol to avoid impurities in the product. The obtained product was dried using a hot air oven at 70 °C for 24 h. Finally, the prepared material was annealed at 600 °C for 2 h."
3,Hydrothermal (HT)-MoO3 synthesis,"2.2 Hydrothermal (HT)-MoO3 synthesis The MoO3 ribbon-like structure was prepared via the hydrothermal technique. A 0.1 M AMT solution was prepared using ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, which is dissolved in 80 ml of DI water. This solution was stirred at the atmospheric temperature for 1 h. Then, the 10 ml of HNO3 has been added drop-wise to the AMT solution at the stirring condition. Finally, the products were transferred into the 100 ml of Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, then stored in a hot air oven at 120 °C for 15 h (Fig. 1 ). Then, the resultant product was collected and washed, dried at 70 °C for 48 h. Furthermore, the product was annealed at 600 °C for 2 h due to avoid the organic residuals."
4,Sol-gel (SG)-MoO3 synthesis,"2.3 Sol-gel (SG)-MoO3 synthesis The sol-gel technique was used to synthesis the hexagonal sheet-like MoO3 structure. The AMT and succinic acid were taken 1:1 ratio (0.1 M), dissolved in the ethanol, and stirred for 2 h. During the preparation, the ammonia solution using to adjust the pH of the AMT solution. Then the obtained solution was continuously stirred and heated to form a gel. Finally, the gel dried at 70 °C for 48 h, and the product was further annealed at 600 °C for 2 h."
5,MoO3/Ni–F electrode preparation,"2.4 MoO3/Ni–F electrode preparation The electrochemical working electrode (WE) was fabricated by mixing with 7 mg MoO3 nanopowder (70%), 2 mg acetylene black (20%), and 1 mg polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (10%). In order to make a homogenous mixing slurry, 2 mL of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were added to the previous mixture and then grinded and sonicated over a period of 30 min. The mixed slurry was drop-casted into the well-cleaned Ni foam. This active material coated Ni foam was dried using an oven at 80 °C for 8 h. After the drying process, the MoO3/Ni–F electrode has used for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensing measurement."
6,Characterization techniques,"2.5 Characterization techniques The morphology dependant MoO3 nanostructure structural properties were analyzed using a MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation). The optical properties of MoO3 were determined using a UV–Vis spectrometer. The morphology of the prepared MoO3 is determined by ZEISS Sigma 500 VP FE-SEM. (Thermo Fisher Scientific Theta Probe, Al Kα x-ray source) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the MoO3 electronic states. The electrochemical properties are analyzed using a CHI 614C electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode system. The three-electrode system contained a modified MoO3/Ni–F as a working electrode, the Pt-wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Structural analysis,"3.1 Structural analysis The morphology-dependent MoO3 nanostructures XRD patterns are depicted in Fig. 2 (a–c). In these MoO3 nanostructures, XRD results confirm the single-crystalline nature of the prepared materials. The recorded patterns sharp diffraction peaks positions on 2θ (°) = 12.76°, 23.32, 25.70, 27.33, 29.29, 33.12, 33.72, 35.49, 38.97, 46.28, 49.23, 52.71, 55.16, 58.79, 64.53 and 69. 45°, which are matched up as (020), (110), (040), (021), (130), (101), (111), (041), (060), (210), (002), (211), (112), (081), (062), and (202) (hkl) planes for orthorhombic crystal phase. The obtained patterns are well-matched with the standard JCPDS, card no: 05–0508. The predominant orientation plane was observed along with the (021) and (110) directions at all spectrums. While altering the morphology of the MoO3, the intensity of the (040) plane is noticeably varied. Moreover, the obtained results recommended that the predominant peak growth varied in the (021) and (110) directions, shown in Fig. 2. The recorded spectra showed no secondary phases in the prepared MoO3 nanostructures prepared by various facile synthesis techniques. Furthermore, based on the morphology, the peak (041) (2θ = 35.49°) intensity increased without disturbing the crystalline phase. So the results imply that the nanomaterial synthesis techniques effectively depend on the MoO3 morphology. To determine the morphology impact on the microstructural properties were attained by the following equation (1) (Mohanraj et al., 2018, 2019). (1) D = 0.89 λ β cos θ where λ, β, θ, and D denoted the incident wavelength of X-ray, FWHM, diffraction angle, and crystallite size. The estimated predominant peak (021) crystallite size 86.96 to 72.66 nm is a noticeably varied form while varying the morphology of the prepared materials. The CP- MoO3 revealed a smaller crystallite size with higher FWHM compared to the other preparation technique. Finally, the XRD results showed that the excellent crystallinity of the prepared MoO3 nanostructures."
9,Optical study,"3.2 Optical study The morphology-dependent MoO3 nanostructures absorption spectra have been recorded from 250 to 900 nm, and the observed spectra are displayed in Fig. 3 (a). The MoO3 nanostructures prepared with different morphology have shown an optical absorption edge were recorded around 280 nm. Notably, the CP–MoO3 cubic nanosheets reveal maximum absorption values relative to other prepared materials. Fig. 3b transmission spectra illustrated the prepared MoO3 various morphology materials have a transmittance of around 60%. These transmittance results indicate the MoO3 cubic nanosheets have an excellent optical transmittance in the visible region compared with the hexagonal nanosheets and nanoribbons. Moreover, the prepared MoO3 nanostructures have an excitation wavelength of not less than ~290 nm. The co-efficient to absorption (α) was obtained from this relation α = -log(T)/d. The optical bandgap of the morphology dependent on the MoO3 was calculated from Tauc's relation as detailed in equation (2) (Marnadu et al., 2021). (2) (αhʋ)2 = A (hʋ - Eg) Where α, A, and Eg represent the absorption coefficient, constant, and the optical bandgap of the prepared materials. Fig. 3 (c) depicts the (αhʋ)2 versus photon energy graph, and the extrapolated linear section gave the optical bandgap of the prepared materials. The attained optical bandgap values are 3.38, 3.17, and 2.94 eV, which show that the morphology of nanomaterials impacts the optical bandgap. These results suggest that the morphology of the material is closely related to the MoO3 composition and microstructure. The positively charged structural defects can absorb up to one or two electrons. These centers are found below the conduction band in the forbidden gap, forming small-donor band differences. Low optical band gap values may be due to variations in the MoO3 micrograph. Fig. 4 shows FESEM micrographs which demonstrate that some of the prepared MoO3 have a columnar form, but the grains have comprehensive and smooth surfaces. At the same time, the bandgap of the prepared material has potential for photocatalysis applications."
10,FESEM analysis,"3.3 FESEM analysis The field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) technique was used to analyze the prepared CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3 micrographs. The captured MoO3 nanostructures morphologies are shown in Fig. 4a-c. Fig. 4 (a) depicts the FESEM images of CP-MoO3 nanostructures, which is revealed cubic nanosheet-like morphology on all magnification micrographs. These magnified images show the agglomerated irregular arrangements of the prepared materials and the images all in the cubic sheet-like morphology. Fig. 4 (b) shown the HT-MoO3 micrographs, which show the hydrothermally prepared materials have a ribbon-like shape. The obtained ribbon-like shape have been columnar form, and some of them in irregular agglomeration. Fig. 4 (c) illustrates the SG-MoO3 different magnification image. These recorded images are clearly shown the hexagonal sheet-like structure along with some aggregation. Comparing all the obtained results clearly depicts the prepared materials with different morphologies depending on the preparation techniques. Compared with the microstructural studies, these results have obtained different morphologies without disturbing the crystalline phase. Moreover, these kinds of structured materials have the potential for photocatalyst and sensing applications."
11,TEM analysis,"3.4 TEM analysis The prepared MoO3 nanostructures microstructural examination were recorded using TEM analysis. The captured CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3 TEM images are illustrated in Fig. 5 (a–i). Fig. 5(a–c) reveals the CP-MoO3 nanostructures TEM, HRTEM, and SAED pattern, confirming the cubic nanosheet-like structure. Moreover, the CP-MoO3 TEM results confirm the particles non-uniformity and polycrystalline nature with the recorded particles size around ~10–30 nm. The HRTEM (Fig. 5b) results depict the cubic nanosheet-like particles are interconnected, and the multiple domains denote the marked cubic shape with continuous lattice fringes. Fig. 5c highlighted spot shows the (021) 3.264 Å lattice fringes of MoO3, which confirms the orthorhombic crystal phase. Further, the inset Fig. 5c SAED patterns bright diffraction rings demonstrate the polycrystalline nature. Fig. 5(d–f) HT-MoO3 TEM images show the ribbon-like nanostructures with single-crystalline nature. These ribbon-like shapes are non-uniforms, interconnected, and the particles size around ~40–50 nm. The HT-MoO3 HRTEM images show the lattice spacing of 3.263 Å for the (021) plane, and SAED patterns bright spots indicate the single crystalline nature. Moreover, Fig. 5g-i SG-MoO3 TEM images are illustrated the hexagonal sheet-like shape, and the recorded images show the asymmetrical shape with the particles size approximately 10–25 nm. Fig. 5(h&i) HRTEM images marked spot displays the multiple domains with continuous lattice fringes, and the lattice spacing value is 3.263 Å the corresponding plane is (021). In addition, the inset Fig. 5 (i) SAED patterns bright circle shown the polycrystalline nature. These TEM morphologies have closely matched with FESEM results."
12,Elemental analysis,"3.5 Elemental analysis Figs. 6 and 7 show the recorded EDS spectra and the elemental mapping of morphology-dependent MoO3 nanostructures. These EDS spectra describe the presence of Mo and O elements in the formed nanostructures, which clearly indicates the formation of MoO3. The Mo and O compositions are confirmed by mapping analysis shown in Fig. 7a-c. In these figures, corresponding atomic percentage values are inserted in Fig. 6a-c. The measured atomic percentages described the hydrothermally prepared ribbon-like shape contain the high Mo content compared to the other preparation method. Finally, these results are good evidence of the MoO3 phase formed without any foreign impurities."
13,XPS analysis,"3.6 XPS analysis The prepared MoO3 nanostructured material electronic state and chemical composition were analyzed using the non-destructive XPS technique. The recorded XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 8 (a–d). Fig. 8a displays the MoO3 survey spectrum, which confirms the formation of Mo and O presences with additional carbon C (1s) peak that appeared on 283.69eV. This carbon C (1s) (Fig. 8d) represents the hydrocarbon that is from the instrument. Fig. 8b shows the deconvoluted spectrum of Mo 3d. In this Mo 3d core level, peaks appeared at 232.0 eV, and 235.09 eV correspond to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 spin-orbit components representing the Mo6+ species (Datta et al., 2017; Reddy et al., 2001; Murugappan et al., 2018). Also, the survey spectrum depicts some of the additional peaks at 397.68 eV, 416.34 eV, and 509.77 eV are corresponding to Mo3p3, Mo3p1, and Mo3s states. Fig. 8c shows the deconvoluted spectrum of the O1s component, which is appeared at 531.23 eV. Hence, the XPS results are confirmed the MoO3 formation without any impurities."
14,TGA-DSC analysis,"3.7 TGA-DSC analysis The recorded MoO3 nanostructures thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) spectra are depicted in Fig. 9 a and b. These TGA-DSC curves were measured under the nitrogen atmosphere, and the recorded spectra range is 25–1000 °C. Fig. 9a and b spectra are distinguished the CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3 TGA-DSC, which depicts the two-weight loss on the ~765 °C and ~900 °C. In Fig. 9a TGA curve shows the CP-MoO3 weight loss ~768 °C and ~919 °C. Fig. 9b DSC curve shows the corresponding endothermic peak ~780 °C and the exothermic ~930 °C, representing the two stages of decomposition. Fig. 9a&b HT-MoO3 TGA-DSC curve illustrated the two-weight loss around ~763 °C and ~886 °C, the corresponding decomposition peaks are attributed at ~784 °C and ~894 °C. The Fig. 9 a&b SG-MoO3 TGA-DSC spectra depicted the two-stage weight loss is ascribed at ~753 °C and ~864 °C, the corresponding thermal decomposition stages are ~780 °C and ~910 °C. Overall, the thermal analysis depicts the CP-MoO3 has good thermal stability compared with the other preparation methods, and the electrode can be used up to ~768 °C."
15,BET analysis,"3.8 BET analysis The prepared MoO3 nanostructures N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, surface area, and pore width distribution were analyzed using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and BJH technique, and the recorded spectra are illustrated in Fig. 10 (a&b). The obtained N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms depicted the type IV isotherms, and it represents the mesoporous structure. The determined BET surface area is 2.4668 m2/g, 1.1950 m2/g, and 0.7157 m2/g, corresponding to the CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3 nanostructures. Fig. 10b displays the pore volume and pore diameter of the MoO3 nanostructures. The adsorption total pore volume is 0.013865 cm³/g, 0.002823 cm³/g, and 0.000417 cm³/g represent the CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3. The measured pore diameter is 430.439 Å, 102.801 Å, and 23.322 Å, corresponds to the CP-MoO3, HT-MoO3, and SG-MoO3. The obtained results show that the CP-MoO3 has a higher surface area and has more active sites, so it is a suitable structure for electrochemical sensing applications."
16,Electrochemical studies,"3.9 Electrochemical studies 3.9.1 Impedance spectroscopy (ESI) analysis The morphology-dependent MoO3 impedance spectra (Z″ vs. Z′) were analyzed by CH instruments model 614C. Fig. 11 shows the recorded impedance spectra (Nyquist plot or Cole-Cole plot) of the different morphology MoO3 samples at the range of 0.1 Hz to 1 × 105 Hz. These complex impedance spectra are recorded at room temperature. The observed MoO3 impedance spectra depict the different MoO3 morphologies such as cubic sheet, ribbon, and hexagonal sheet-like shapes. In these impedance spectra, each semi-circle can be represented by the equivalent circuit, made up of a single parallel resistor (Rp) and a series resistor (Rs) with a parallel capacitor (Cp). This RC equivalent circuit can be explained by complex impedance formula (Z*) (3) (Buyukbas-Ulusan and Tataroglu, 2020; Ahmet Muhammed Akbas et al., 2021), (3) Z ∗ = R s + R p 1 + i ω R p C p = Z ′ + iZ ″ = Re Z + iImZ where Z′ and Z″ have denoted the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance. The real (Z′) and imaginary (Z″) parts of impedance are given in the following relation (4 and 5), (4) R e Z = [ R s + R p 1 + ( ω R p C p ) 2 ] (5) I m Z = [ ω R p 2 C p 1 + ( ω R p C p ) 2 ] The measured impedance spectra denoted the resistance value varied with respect to the MoO3 morphologies, and semi-circle can be observed at the lower range. Moreover, the prepared (CP–MoO3) cubic nanosheet-like morphology has a low resistivity compared to the other prepared morphologies, clearly shown in the impedance spectra (Fig. 11). These recorded semicircular arcs are slightly shifted to the real axis, indicating the non-Debye type relaxation phenomenon of the prepared nanostructures. Also, the lower frequency component is caused maybe by the phase boundary between Mo and MoO3 (Chithambararaj et al., 2016; Pehlivan et al., 2019). Fig. 11b depicts the real part of impedance (log Z′) concerning the function of log frequency at different MoO3 morphologies. Fig. 11c shows the imaginary part of impedance (log -Z″) with respect to the log frequency. Further, that Z′ has a slight difference in the low-frequency region confirms the morphology-dependent resistance behaviour of this material. These lower region impedance value variations imply the existence of (ion, electron, oxygen vacancies, etc.) free charge carriers in the prepared nanostructures. Also, the higher frequency region attains a saturated value which means the low resistivity due to the dipole relaxation process in the nanostructures. This behaviour indicates the prepared materials have semiconducting characteristics. Fig. 11d describes the Bode plot of the morphology-dependent MoO3 nanostructures. This Bode plot reveals that the pseudocapacitive nature and the electrolytes ionic resistance have gradually changed the high-frequency region's phase angle (Srinivasan, 2019; He et al., 2017; Halder et al., 2019). Therefore, the electrochemical impedance results suggest that the CP-MoO3 has a low resistivity compared to the other prepared morphologies. So these prepared nanostructures can be applied in photocatalysts and electrochemical sensing applications. 3.9.2 Electrochemical sensing analysis The electrochemistry-based sensor provides the chosen nanostructures of interest with high sensitivity, selectivity, and inexpensive. Because electrochemical reactions give a direct electrical signal, electrochemical processes are appropriate for sensors (Selvi et al., 2020). The prepared CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrochemical characteristics such as cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry and impedance were measured by the three-electrode cell with a 1 M KOH electrolyte. In the CV performance, the modified MoO3/Ni–F was used as a working electrode, Pt-Wire as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. The factor of pH is one of the most important components in CV performance. The modified MoO3/Ni–F electrode CV curves were measured with different pH, and the effects of CV curves are depicted in Fig. 12 . These CV curves display that pH 13 has a higher peak current value. So, this pH medium is chosen for further electrochemical sensing analysis. The measured MoO3/Ni–F CV curves are illustrated in Fig. 13 . These figures depict the scan rate dependent operation in the 1 M KOH electrolyte, with the performed scan rate was increased from 10 to 200 mV/s at the potential range of −1 to +1 V. The modified electrode CV curves show the redox peaks, which Ipa increased and shift towards the negative potential side due to the diffusion control process (Dung et al., 2013). This peak current increases due to the higher number of protons that help the electro-oxidation process. Moreover, these broad Ipa peaks indicated the modified electrode's good electrocatalytic properties. The modified electrode sensing performance was recorded by the cyclic voltammetry method at 9 μM H2O2 in 50 ml of 1 M KOH. The recorded cyclic voltammetry curves are depicted in Fig. 14 , which reveals that the different scan rates such as 10–200 mV/s. The reduction peaks current increases accordingly with increased scan rates. The peak is relocated to a more negative potential, indicating that the reduction procedure at the electrode surface is diffusion-regulated and irreversible (Wang et al., 2010). Fig. 15 illustrates the plot of anodic peak current versus root of the scan rate of the 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH/9 μM H2O2. The determined linear regression equation and correlation coefficient are y = 0.0141x + 0.0133, R2 = 0.9877 for 1 M KOH with different scan rates and y = 0.0144x + 0.0153, R2 = 0.9872 for 9 μM H2O2 in 50 ml of 1 M KOH with different scan rates. This plot depicts that the peak current and scan rates have a linear relationship that confirms the diffusion-regulated electron transfer process of the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode surface (Tavakkoli et al., 2020; Joseph et al., 2021). Moreover, the Fig. 16 CV curves clearly show the variation peak current of the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode in the absence and presence of 9 μM H2O2 in 1 M KOH in the potential range −1.0 to +1.0 at the 200 mV/s. In addition, the linear sweep voltammetry and impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to determine the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrochemical sensing at various H2O2 concentrations. The different H2O2 concentrations recorded LSV curves are displayed in Fig. 17 . These LSV curves imply the anodic current linearly increased with increasing the H2O2 concentrations. So, the Fig. 17 indicates the H2O2 anodically reduced in the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode surface, which is maybe owing to the direct 2e− and 2H+ contained at the reduction reaction. This reduction reaction leads to forms the water (Cai et al., 2018; Maduraiveeran and Ramraj, 2007). In the reduction reaction (Fig. 18 ), the initial adsorbed ( OH ad ‾ ) hydroxide ions are formed in the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode surface, and this reaction can be written as following equation (6), (6) H 2 O 2 + H + + e − → O H ( a d ) + H 2 O ( I ) the formation of water can be written as the following equation (7) (7) O H ( a d ) + H + + e − → H 2 O The anodic peak current is enhanced with increasing the concentration, which is shown in Fig. 19 . From the Fig. 19, the calculated linear regression equation and correlation coefficient are y = 0.0080x + 0.0743, R2 = 0.9933 for 0.072–1.086 μM and y = 0.0003x + 0.0849, R2 = 0.9994 for 2.25–74.856 μM. These anodic peak current was remarkably enhanced to the H2O2 reduction. Because of the amplification of electron transfer kinetics, the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode is exhibited remarkable direct electrocatalytic activity. Further, the limit of detection (LOD) calculated from the following equation (5) (Tseng et al., 2020; Vishnu et al., 2019), (8) LOD = 3SB/s The SB has denoted the standard deviation of the blank peak, and s represents the slope value determined from Fig. 19. The obtained limit of detection value is 1.2 μM. These calculated parameters are compared with the previous literature electrodes that are depicted in Table 1 . This comparison table shows that the prepared electrode has a very low detection level compared with the literature value. So, the prepared CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode has better electrochemical activity, and hence these CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode is more potential for the electrochemical sensing of H2O2. Further, the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode H2O2 sensing performance was conducted by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. This technique is a more effective way to examine the electrocatalytic processes above the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode surface. The recorded H2O2 sensing electrochemical impedance spectra are depicted in Fig. 20 . These EIS spectra illustrated the semicircle, which denotes the electron transfer resistance and is pointed on the electrode surface by the redox-probe electron communication kinetics (Ansari and Alam, 2021). Moreover, the semicircle is decreased while increasing the H2O2 concentration may be due to the more radical ions formed in the electrode surface, which indicates the conductivity of the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode is increased. The addition of H2O2 increases electron transport towards the electrode surface, resulting in a change in semicircle radius or electron transfer rate. In addition, the prepared CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode's long-term stability and reproducibility were tested by the LSV technique. The recorded LSV curves are depicted in Fig. 21 . The tests recorded on the first day and after 20 days showing the electrode were stored in the same condition. These LSV curves show a small variation in the peak current, so the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode has good stability and reproducibility, which can be potential for practical application. Fig. 22 bar diagram illustrated the relative error (%) vs. oxidation peak response of interfering compounds. This effect of interference is one of the most significant parameters of a real-time application. From these results, the prepared CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode is well suitable for selective determination of H2O2. Consequently, the obtained results reveal that the proposed CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode provides excellent routes between electrode and electrolytes and can be a viable platform for electrochemical sensing."
17,Conclusion,"The surface morphology-dependent MoO3 nanostructures were successfully prepared by various preparation approaches. The XRD results have exhibited the all nanostructures formed without disturbing the single crystalline phase. The TEM and FESEM studies are confirmed the prepared MoO3 nanostructures and crystallinity, and the obtained morphologies are cubic sheet, ribbon, and hexagonal sheet, respectively. The elemental mapping analysis confirms the formation of MoO3, and XPS confirms the electronic states. The obtained MoO3 optical band gaps are 3.38, 3.17, and 2.94 eV, revealing that the optical bandgap depends on the MoO3 morphology. The thermal analysis revealed the cubic-like shape has good thermal stability compared to the other nanostructures, and this CP-MoO3 thermal stability is ~768 °C. The BET results confirm the CP-MoO3 has a higher surface area and more active sites. Further, the electrochemical impedance (EIS) results suggest that the CP-MoO3 has good conductivity. The interference species results depict that H2O2 has a higher response than the other compounds. The CP-MoO3/Ni–F modified electrode provides a good H2O2 sensing performance, long-term stability, reproducibility, and a low detection limit is 1.2 μM. Therefore, these outcomes suggest that the CP-MoO3/Ni–F electrode is a potential candidate for sensing various pollutants."
