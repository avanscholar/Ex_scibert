0,Introduction,"The development of integrated energy efficient systems built with renewable sources and hydrogen technologies can play an important role in reducing the energy use from fossil fuels and pollution emissions. Moreover, the diffuse structures of residential energy demand may be appropriate to implement distributed generation systems from local renewable energies, where the sun is a preferred resource because of its ready availability. However, the intermittent nature of solar radiation makes it challenging to generate reliable energy with photovoltaic (PV) modules alone. Thus, the continuous supply of power to off-grid electricity consumers depends on energy storage, where chemical carriers such as hydrogen (H2) have the advantage of not losing their energy content while not in use [1–4]. The overall configuration of a PV-H2 hybrid system for a grid of an independent house is shown in http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319912024639 Fig. 1 . The main advantage of the hybrid system compared to a separate PV array is the possibility of surplus energy storage by transforming it into H2 that can be used in fuel cells (FC): if the power generated by the primary system (PV) is higher than the electrical demand, the surplus energy is used in an electrolyzer to produce H2; if the PV is not sufficient to meet the loading, the energy required is provided from the H2 storage and is used in the FCs. Thus, the hybrid system consists of PV modules coupled to an electrolyzer (EL) and FCs that must meet certain requirements: • The system should supply a minimum voltage to the electrolyzer to carry out the splitting of water (theoretically 1.23 V and experimentally around 1.4–2 V). • Each subsystem (PV and EL) should work near to their maximum power points (MPPs) at a given irradiance and temperature in order to maximize efficiency. • The nominal capacity of each subsystem should be carefully selected to satisfy the electricity demands but without oversizing the system. • The system should contain a minimum of auxiliary devices (e.g., power conditioning, batteries and others) so that the global efficiency and costs are optimized. Numerous hybrid systems based on renewable energy and H2 for building locations have been discussed previously, including the solar inputs and load dynamics, the trade-offs between primary energy rates, load profiles and storage capacity, the coupling of PV-EL without MPP trackers (MPPT) and power converters, the operation and efficiency of EL, and the cost reductions required to compete with conventional energy systems [5–16]. Several studies have been carried out in an attempt to find the size and operation of directly coupled PV-EL systems to optimize the energy transfer. For a directly connected system, the EL operates at the intersection points between the PV output and EL input curves for different irradiance levels, although there are no definitive concepts to guide the method for the connection of PV and EL without the use of MPPTs [17–23]. The work described here concerns a comprehensive methodology to size, analyze and assess PV-H2 systems. The model considers the weather data and the electrical variables of the components to perform energy balances and calculate the efficacy of the system in terms of the levels of energy stored and the loading requirements. The hybrid system design is dependent on the performance of individual components, which were modelled first. The combination of these components was then evaluated to meet the demand reliably. As far as the PV-EL analysis was limited in other studies to simpler systems in which the entire PV output is fed into the EL at all times, we attempt to find the optimal arrangement in the most desirable configuration shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the purpose of this study is not a detailed operational description of the entire electrical topology of the systems, but a new procedure for hybrid system analysis based on the direct coupling of PVs and ELs; within this purpose, two electrolytic sub-systems (conventional water splitting and electrochemical reforming of ethanol) are investigated, which represents another novel contribution of this work in an effort to find the best compromise between the minimum voltage and the size of the electrolyzers. The hybrid system was studied without complex power electronics or batteries, showing that a good knowledge of PV and EL behavior allows the optimization of a stand-alone energy system that fulfills the electricity needs in full operation over time. There is a FC in the system playing the role of a power regeneration device which is not constantly in operation to support the stand-alone system. But it is not considered in detail how the topology of the grid -including the loads-is formed inside the system and how they are sustained no matter the changing operating points of the various devices. When the FC is turned off a battery could provide the minimum power that can form the electrical bus and can respond to rapid changes in current and voltage before the FC is activated to cover the power loads without a blackout even for some seconds. Bearing all the above objectives, limitations and considerations in mind, the manuscript is organized as follows: - Section 2 deals with the primary energy of the system (i.e., the solar radiation converted into electrical energy), in which the PV cells are simulated by means of power curves at different radiation levels and temperatures in the solar modules. - In Section 3 the electrolytic processes are described by means of their power curves, which were obtained from research into conventional and novel ethanol electrolyzers. - In Section 4 the hybrid system is fully modelled by the solar inputs, the PV array and its coupling to the electrolyzers, the H2 production and the FC to meet the power loads. - In Section 5 the results of simulations are discussed, including the optimal design and sensitivity analysis in order to compare the systems studied and other alternatives. - Finally, the main findings and conclusions of this study are summarized in Section 6."
1,Solar radiation and characterization of PV cells,
2,Primary energy,"2.1 Primary energy The primary energy source is the solar radiation available at the site which is converted into electrical energy with a set of PV cells, where the electricity generation depends on the insolation level, temperature and properties of the cells [24,25]. The radiation (G) and temperature (T) profiles in the solar-PV modules can be modelled with the following expressions for simulation purposes: (1a) G = ½ Gm [1 – cos (2πt / Δt)] (1b) T = Ta + G·(NOCT – 20)/800 where Gm (W/m2) is the highest solar power density, t is the time between sunrise (t1) and sunset (t2) (Δt = t2 – t1) and NOCT is a parameter of PV cells; e.g., Fig. 2 shows the daily radiation profile and cell temperature for Gm = 1000 W/m2, with dawn and sunset at 8 and 18 h, respectively, NOCT 47 °C and ambient temperature: Ta = 5 + 15 G/103. This profile depends on climatic conditions, geographic latitude, season of the year and inclination of the modules, but it can be considered as base day for preliminary design of facilities; hence, calculations could be properly extended to annual periods with full-year-daily-average data or actual measurements from local meteorological stations."
3,Photovoltaic (PV) cells,"2.2 Photovoltaic (PV) cells The most common solar cells are made from doped silicon films and they are classified as mono- and polycrystalline. PV modules are arrangements of cells with different sizes in such a way that they allow the generation of electrical power to operate the loadings. The PV array utilized in this study is formed by modules of monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) interconnected in a configuration at 34.8 VDC (106 W each); these are the most suitable silicon modules for the installation of solar trackers and they are also more efficient than polycrystalline cells, with better results obtained in cold climates. The energy production of the solar array is determined by the current-voltage curves of the PV cells. These curves depend on the radiation levels (G), the temperatures (T) and parameters such as the short-circuit current (Isc,r, μIsc), the open voltage (Voc,r, μVoc), the intensity and voltage at the maximum power point (IMPP,r, VMPP,r), the energy gap (Eg) and the number of cells in series/parallel (Ns, Np). The problem of finding model circuit parameters for solar cells is crucial for performance evaluation, control, efficiency computation and MPP tracking of the PV systems [26,27]. The model presented by Duffie & Beckmann [28], which is the most widely cited in the literature [29], was selected for PV characterization in this study (eq. (2)), along with the relations to work out the parameters [30] in Table 1 and the information datasheet for the PV (c-Si) technology shown in Fig. 3 . (2) V = ɑ·ln [(Isc – I)/Io + 1] – I·Rs,r The power vs. voltage characteristics of the PV cell show a maximum and this depends on the cell temperature and insolation. The current-voltage (I-V) curves are shown in Fig. 3 along with MPP (IMPP, VMPP) estimations for different values of solar irradiance and temperatures, which correspond to the daily profile outlined in section 2.1."
4,Investigation and characterization of the electrolyzers,"The hydrogen subsystem consists of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, a tank for H2 storage and a fuel cell (PEM-FC). PEM-type electrolyzers offer advantages such as H2 purity, small size, stable electrolyte, pressurized operation and lower energy consumption without the requirement to maintain a voltage, unlike in alkaline cells. The electrolyzer receives the electrical energy from the PV modules and the production of hydrogen will be determined by the properties of these components. Therefore, the I-V behavior of the EL must be known so that both subsystems are coupled as closely as possible to the maximum PV power (MPP) through an optimum array arrangement. For this purpose, we start from the characteristic curves of two PEM-type electrolytic systems (with water and ethanol) that fit a concise model of three parameters (eq. (3)), where the current density is the electrical intensity per unit of electrode area (J = I/S). (3) V = [J + 2K (J·R + Eo) + (J2 + 4K·Eo J)1/2] / 2K This model describes electrolysis by means of three parameters: the thermodynamic voltage (Eo), which is related to the water dissociation potential, the kinetic parameter (K), which reflects the overall electrochemical kinetic effect of both electrodes, and the ohmic parameter (R), which accounts for the total electrical resistance of the cell [31]."
5,Water electrolysis,"3.1 Water electrolysis The characteristics of a conventional water electrolyzer are based on the research of Millet et al. [32] on PEM cells with low resistance and high operating current density at a temperature of 90 °C. In this case, when platinum is used in the cathode and iridium is employed in the anode, the water dissociation potential is 1.40 V, the cell resistance is 0.15 Ω cm2 and the kinetic parameter is 27.8 Ω − 1cm−2 (Fig. 4 a)."
6,Ethanol electrolysis,"3.2 Ethanol electrolysis Production of H2 by water electrolysis and biomass reforming can be combined using the electroreforming concept (e.g. with bioethanol). It is a recent alternative to optimize the process as the energy contained in the organic compounds supplies a part of power requirements, thus enabling current density at low anode potentials (<1.3 V) [33–36]. The electrochemical reforming of ethanol (EtOH) for hydrogen production in a PEM cell was reported by De Lucas-Consuegra et al. [37]. Moreover, these authors prepared a novel Pd anode with high electro-catalytic activity (up to 700 mA/cm2) to produce very pure faradic H2 with a low energy demand. The most effective electrolyte in the fuel solution was KOH and an increase in temperature enhanced the activity up to 90 °C [38]. The curves with 2 M EtOH and 1 M KOH at 80 °C were chosen for this work, showing an electrochemical potential of only 0.40 V, but a higher cell resistance (0.30 Ω cm2) and much lower kinetic activity (1.2 Ω − 1cm−2) than conventional water electrolysis (Fig. 4b). The output of the hybrid system is then determined from the I-V curves, which represent the PV and EL operational characteristics for a given set of conditions. However, even if the PV-EL were perfectly coupled for one set of conditions that would not necessarily be applicable to another depending on the dynamics of the PV and EL: this is the case in next sections, where they are initially well coupled for the sunny conditions (Gm). Finally, the H2 is stored in a tank and transformed into electrical energy in a PEM-FC with efficiencies up to 60% [39]. To fill the H2 deposit, the PEM-EL may be designed to provide enough gas pressures (>14 bar) with very little additional power consumption (BOP) [6]."
7,Setting the electrical loads and modeling the hybrid system,"The power loads and their typical hourly profiles were estimated for the whole day – as shown in the case outlined below – before proceeding to model the hybrid systems, where calculations are based on the same solar and temperature profiles, to perform a comparative design of the equipment with an optimal size and load coverage."
8,Electrical loads,"4.1 Electrical loads Representative electric devices within a typical residence were considered to estimate the loads (including power and hours of daily operation): five luminaires (20 W, 5 h), a washing machine (600 W, 1 h), a television (120 W, 2 h), a stereo (50 W, 1 h), a computer (115 W, 3 h), a climatizer (110 W, 10 h) and a refrigerator (200 W, 24 h), amounting to an electricity demand of C = 7.635 kWh/day. On the basis of the above appliances a distribution of the loads was prepared according to Table 2 . These loads occur mainly in the morning and evening when there is low solar availability; most of the PV output is unused during midday and this time offset between supply and demand leads to only 36.5% (2.790 kWh) of the residential load demand possibly being met directly by the PV, with 63.5% (4.845 kWh) of the demand requiring the hydrogen storage devices: i.e., the H2 that has been produced by the electrolyzer and stored in a gas cylinder is used in the fuel cell to meet the simulated residential load dynamics shown in the last column of Table 2."
9,Hybrid system modeling,"4.2 Hybrid system modeling The primary energy generation and the production of hydrogen are determined by the characteristics of the solar radiation, the PV cells and their coupling to the electrolyzers. As an example, the coupling of ELs to the MPP at the time of maximum daily radiation is shown in Fig. 5 along with the curves of the PV module for different insolation levels. On using this approach, the relative position and shape of the electrolyzer (EL) curve is determined by the number (NEL) and surface (SCEL) of EL cells in series connected to the PV modules to achieve the best coupling in each case: for conventional electrolysis this can be achieved with NEL-1 = 18 and SEL-1 = 3.41 cm2 per module (PV1), as shown in Fig. 5a for the maximum solar radiation, which is close to MPPs for other conditions (Fig. 5b); for ethanol electrolysis these values are much higher, e.g., NEL-2 = 40 and SEL-2 = 16.1 cm2, and the coupling is worse (Fig. 5a and b) because of the different I-V characteristics that make these electrolyzers run at low current densities (J). This initial selection of the number and areas of the electrodes allows the following procedure to be proposed to optimize the relative sizing of PV-EL for direct coupling: 1. The electrical intensity of the PV module coupled to the electrolyzer according to the radiation and temperature profiles (eq. 1a & b) is determined by solving equations (2) and (3) simultaneously: (4) IPV1,t (Gt, Tt) = 0 2. The power generation is then summed and compared to daily consumption in order to estimate the number of modules required using a suitable sizing factor (f): (5a) PPV1 = Σ (I·V)PV1,t (5b) NPV = f·C/PPV1 3. The joint generation of the photovoltaic field is reduced with the consumption during the hours of sunlight to impute the excess hourly power destined for the electrolyzer: (6a) PPV = Σ NPV·PPV1,t (6b) PEL = Σ ∣PPV,t – Ct∣ 4. The total current of the PV modules connected to the electrolyzer is obtained with PEL,t = (I·V)EL,t (eq. (3)), together with the electrode area for the maximum (nominal) power: (7a) IEL,t = f (PEL,t) (7b) SCEL = SEL·(PEL/PPV1)max 5. The hydrogen production is estimated by Faraday's law (ℑ = 96.5 kC/gH2), using a net current efficiency (ηEL = 0.90) [6] to account for small faradic losses and additional energy consumption outside the electrolyzer stack (BOP): (8) QH = Σ NEL 3,6·ηEL IEL,t /ℑ 6. The hydrogen for fuel cells (FCs) is finally taken into account to withstand the power deficits (eq. (9a)), with a performance e.g. ηFC = 0.60 (LHV), as well as the availability of H2 in terms of power differences (SOC): (9a) PFC = Σ ∣Ct – PPV,t∣ (9b) SOC = Σ ∣QH,t – PFC,t/ηFC ∣ The spreadsheet for a simulation scenario with the ethanol electrolyzer (EL-2) over the 24 h day is shown in more detail in Fig. 6 : column B shows the daily consumption of the house (Wh/h) and columns C to G include radiation, temperature and PV module parameters, the current intensity of which is calculated with a solver in columns H-I; columns J to L thus yield the hourly powers, estimate the number of modules with the chosen sizing factor (cells F2 and F3) and obtain the total power and power surplus for electrolysis; a second column pair (M-N) calculates the current to the electrolyzer from which the production of hydrogen (O) is finally obtained for the FC (Q) or for storage (R); the electrode area per cell and total (I2 and I3), as well as the maximum and minimum current densities (L2 and L3), are determined from the extreme hourly average values in columns L and M; finally, the efficiency rate (LHV) and the specific energy consumption of the electrolyzer are calculated in cells R2 and R3 using the outputs from L30 and O30. The solar input amounts to 5 kW/m2day with a PV generation of 0.444 kWh/module; on entering the factor (f = 2.0) the number of modules is 35, the total generation is 15.5 kWh and the power surplus is 12.9 kWh; the total current to EL-2 is 1600 kC/day and the electrode area is 2.036 m2, leading to an operation range of 0.545–1.825 kA/m2; the H2 production is 597 g/day, of which 41.9% is consumed by the FC for home power and the remainder (SOC = 11.6 kWhH2) can be used for other applications."
10,"Results from simulations, cost analysis and discussion","The optimum design of the hybrid systems requires the identification of the size and configuration of the solar field and the electrolyzer in order to minimize the total costs of the installations while ensuring the load coverage [i.e., SOC (Wh/d) ≥ 0], in addition to other limitations on the operating conditions of the equipment (e.g., Jmin and Jmax). The spreadsheets of the cases studied allow a detailed appreciation of the data sets, the simulated variables and results obtained. This allows the design to be discussed from a techno-economic point of view and to obtain relevant conclusions regarding modeling, simulation and optimization of hybrid hydrogen and solar energy system coupling. The power outputs from the modules (PFV), the power loads of the house (C), the inputs to the electrolyzer (PEL), the hydrogen produced by the EL or utilized in FC (SOC), the FC generation (PFC), and the cumulative state-of-charge of the storage system throughout the day (WhH2/day) are shown in Fig. 7 according to the spreadsheets (Fig. 6), the main results of which are summarized in Table 3 . Both systems are simulated to cover the power loads of the house while producing and storing almost the same amount of H2 (ca. 11.6 kWh/d, as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3), but their operation is rather different in terms of primary energy requirements, current densities and size of the electrolyzers. Therefore, an economic estimate of the systems based on the equipment size, the specific costs of the components and consumption of reagents was obtained as depicted in Table 4 . The technology, manufacture and marketing of many components are in early stage of development and, as a consequence, the costs of the hybrid systems are still uncertain. The price of PV modules is taken as 1.3 €/Wp with a lifetime of 25 years and O&M of 2% per year [40], the EL is purchased at 4075 €/Nm3 H2h−1 and this price may be scaled by an exponent of 0.7 based on electrode area with a lifetime of 20 years and O&M of 1%, the deposit for 15 days storage (H2-FC) at 38 €/Nm3 in 20 years and 0.5% [41], the cost of FC 3000 €/kW in 10 years and 2.5% [42] and the consumption of EtOH at 0.50 €/l [43]; finally, the hydrogen surplus is assumed to be sold in the energy market at 4.0 €/kgH2. The use of H2 eliminates the need for high number of short-term storage units, although there should be a small battery -to overcome problems like start-up and fast ramp rates-considering the slow response of FCs in stand-alone application (to make it sustainable). It is difficult to analyze the load dynamics of this battery without operational experience with the system, but we can approach the battery using a size value: PB = ½ PFC = 2.52 kWh (i.e. half the power back-up that is enough capacity for daily operations) and a cost value of 100 €/kWh (15 years and O&M 3%) [44], which give: 100·2.52·(1/15 + 3/100) = 24 €/a, i.e. a very low cost contribution corresponding to a small auxiliary battery unit. The system has the potential of seasonal hydrogen storage but it was sized in this study for 15 days autonomous FC generation; e.g. for PFC = 5034.9 Wh/day (Fig. 6) the amount of H2 to be stored is: 15·(PFC/ηFC)/LHVH2 = 42.0 Nm3 = 1.42 m3 (at 30 bar), i.e. as PEM-EL are capable to operate at such output pressures, it can be appropriate for home volume deposits without additional pressure. There are other potential uses of H2 like heating or refilling a car (as shown in Fig. 1), but they are not considered in the economic analysis that focuses on hybrid power subsystems; however, we can estimate a compressor using the values of 1000 €/kWH2 (lifetime 10 years and O&M 2%) [44], being the size equal to the H2 surplus (i.e. 11.6 kWh/d = 0.48 kW) and the cost: 1000·0.48 ·(1/10 + 2/100) = 58 €/a; the energy consumption from 30 to 350 bar is: W ≈ nℜT·ln(P/Po)/ηc ≈ 1.2 kWh/kgH2, that represents a small energy contribution compared with the main electrolytic process (Ce) and it can be embedded in ηBOP using the calculation approach summarized in Fig. 6. The economics of PV-H2 systems will be determined by the cost of components, their capacity factors and efficiency. One must also take into account competing technologies and therefore the main contribution of economic analysis is to establish a baseline of technologies to meet residential loads, i.e., the costs and lifetimes of PV, EL and FC for comparison with current energy alternatives (electricity and fuels) or other storages. The battery and compressor have minor contributions to system economies, while their sizes and costs are basically independent of system configurations (see Table 4); thus, for simplicity, these components are not included in the subsequent sensitivity analysis as they represent only about 6% of annual cost for conventional electrolyzer system and do not introduce practical differences for comparative purposes with other systems. It can be observed that the electrochemical reforming system with alcohol has an initial investment and annual costs higher than conventional electrolysis, because the former requires a much larger surface area of electrodes, as well as consumption of ethanol; however, the conventional process requires a much higher sizing of the solar field as a consequence of its greater voltages (1.45–1.75 V) when compared to the organic based process (0.58–0.79 V), which has much more favorable specific energy yield (kWh/kgH2); the power efficiency (ηe = QH·LHV/PEL) is 155% using ethanol -higher than 100%- because it only considers PEL and not the chemical energy contained in the organic compound. The current densities can be maintained in both cases within the limits for their proper operation and both systems allow self-sufficiency in electrical energy in the home as well as a surplus of 0.35 kgH2/d, which would provide benefits of ca. 500 €/a. Sensitivity analysis.- Three simulation cases for coupling the organic electrolyzers with different I-V lines converging on Gm (MPP), but having different numbers and areas of electrodes, are presented for an initial parametric study of the main variables (Fig. 8 a). Three new cases in which the number of EL cells with the same area were modified are simulated in Fig. 8b; these give lines that intersect the PV at points apart from Gm (MPP). The sizing factors of the PV arrays were scaled in all cases to produce similar hydrogen surpluses (SOC variation is 11.5–11.7 kWhH2/day) in order to make them comparable. As expected, increasing EL sizes in series reduces the PV size as the coupling throughout the G (MPP) space is improved (i.e., the EL runs at lower intensity with better energy use) but these gains are rather limited and also occur at the expense of larger electrolyzers. As indicated 2above, the sizing factors for the solar field have to be modified in each case to achieve a similar SOC value. However, if this factor had been set as in case 0 (f = 2.0) to keep the number of modules approximately constant, the results in case 1 represent savings in electrode area and a lower hydrogen surplus (0.77 m2, 7.1 kWh/d), whereas case 2 follows the opposite trend (5.4 m2, 15.8 kWh/d). The energy efficiency and Jmax of the electrolyzer are not modified, even if the Jmin is (1.102 and 0.251 kA/m2). The results summarized below clearly show that as EL coupling improves, the required PV solar fields are reduced, but in turn the sizes of electrolyzers become much larger. Therefore, in economic terms it would not be particularly advantageous to operate near to the `maximum power points' (which require lower current densities), even if they give rise to more favorable specific energy consumptions. On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that the most important criterion for system optimization is the reduction of the electrolyzer sizes as opposed to primary energy transfer from solar modules, due to the cost of the components and the voltage characteristics of the electrolyzer. Thus, case 0 is considered as an optimal configuration bearing in mind the dynamics of operation, the efficiency of the energy conversion, the sizes of the components and the resulting costs. Furthermore, perhaps the most interesting issue for parametric analysis is to anticipate the `breakeven' values of the operating and cost variables of the organic electrolyzers that match them to conventional systems and to ensure that their hybridization with a solar (PV) source is cost-effective compared to other energy solutions. For this analysis the water electrolyzer (a) can be compared to the ethanol reforming electrolyzer (b) using the base configuration to couple the hybrid system (i.e., case 0), which means the sizes of units as shown in Table 4. The unit costs of the components are then simulated so that the annual costs of both systems are equivalent: the critical components are the PV and EL only as the FC and H2 deposit have in practice the same dimensions and costs. The composition of costs for the different scenarios are shown in Fig. 9 : (A) corresponds to hybridization of the organic EL (NEL-2 = 40), which amounts to 2242 €/a, with 11% of cost due to PVs, 44% EL, 17% FC, 4% H2 deposit and 24% from EtOH consumption; this is 74% more expensive than using a conventional water EL (1290 €/a), due to the lower current density but also to the EtOH consumed in the electro-reforming process, with 39% of cost due to PVs, 25% EL, 29% FC and 7% the H2 deposit; finally, there are two cases in which the costs of organic ELs are matched to the costs of a water EL: the simulations showed that the unit cost of the organic EL should drop to 5740 €/m2 (i.e., a 43% cost reduction) even if an inexpensive organic substrate can be used (case B); but, if the organic EL is coupled using a lower number of cells (NEL-2 = 23) the cost of EL is reduced near 60% (by the increase of J) and this – it's important to be noted – matches the same annual costs as using conventional EL if an inexpensive substrate is used (case C); that would hopefully promote the use of residual biomass products, which in turn would provide both energy and environmental advantages. It should also be noted that the price of PV modules was taken on the basis of the cost reduction rates of these technologies, which are now quite favorable. Therefore, this factor hardly compensates for the reduction of the solar field that is achieved with the implementation of the hybrid energy systems. In this sense, the electricity supplied by hybrid systems such as the ones described in this paper costs 31 c€/kWh after deducting H2 sales (i.e. approx. the same as current electricity prices for home consumers in Spain, which include taxes, levies and other regulated costs due to grid connection). However, the hybrid system has the merit of being autonomous and the H2 has the capacity for seasonal energy storage, thus avoiding electrification constraints in off-grid locations as well as limitations of batteries, which are only capable of short-term power storage; this was assessed in recent communications where authors show that hydrogen is the most effective carrier for storage of stochastic renewable energy in the long-term, as the costs of electric accumulators increase much faster than the costs of the hydrogen systems when the time of energy storage rises [44,45]. These results indicate that although the technology is in the early development stages and the costs are still very uncertain, the integrated systems built with PV and H2 can play an effective role in implementing a distributed energy supply in applications that require long-term storage with compact, long life and low maintenance devices. The hydrogen storage sub-system is economically beneficial if its lifecycle cost is less than the costs of additional PV cells, the short-term storage (e.g. batteries) or a fuel generator (or both), that would be necessary if there was no hydrogen storage; this was also assessed in another study showing that it becomes economically-viable at given solar ratios (latitudes) for round-trip efficiencies lower than what are already achievable with present-day technology [46]. Hybrid systems with direct connection of PV and batteries to smooth the power supply to EL have also been analyzed to operate in better operation points and increase the full load hours (due to discrete EL sizes and minimum energy requirements); however, one key finding is that the use of batteries is currently more expensive than building more electrolyzer capacity [47]. Moreover, the most fragile elements in PV hybrid systems are batteries and electronic devices that often fail unpredictably and are sensitive to temperature; hence, the direct coupling PV-EL allows to avoid these problems, while reducing the overall costs [48]. Thus, the use of hydrogen eliminates the need for high number of solar cells and battery units with low life span, although there may also be an additional small-sized storage unit consisting of battery, ultra-capacitor, etc. -as a buffer of fast variations in load demands-considering the relatively slow response of FC technology [49]. As the direct coupling design is focused on a system in which the PV output is fed to the EL or home demands at different rates, it also requires real-time control of parallel interconnections wiring to keep the PV at its operation points when it is hooked up to the loadings. Additionally, under variable loads, a minimum input current must be guaranteed to accomplish with quality standards, whereas below that minimum current the EL should be switched off and the rate of change of the supply current is kept bounded to reduce internal wear. The power loss was not considered as the excess power produced by the PV array is never more than the nominal power input of the EL. Finally, the safety threats of the hybrid systems, especially the hydrogen storage tanks, should not be ignored for a proper deployment of the technology in residential applications."
11,Concluding remarks,"It can be concluded that the integration of hydrogen and solar energy technologies by the hybridization of photovoltaic panels coupled to hydrogen generators is a viable option – with reasonable capital and operating costs – to satisfy energy requirements in a location that is isolated from the electricity grid. The main advantage of PV-H2 hybrid systems for an independent home grid, when compared with a separate PV array, is the possibility of surplus energy storage by means of an EL, which transforms the electricity into H2 that can be used in FCs. The study presented here concerns a novel procedure to analyze and design PV-H2 systems that considers the weather data and performs effective energy balances to assess the hybrid system by the load requirements, the levels of energy stored and the resulting costs. A good knowledge of PV & EL characteristics allows the optimization of stand-alone energy systems that fulfill power needs in full operation over time. Two electrolytic systems were analyzed (conventional water and ethanol reforming) and this represents another contribution of this work in the search for the best trade-off between the minimum sizes and voltages of the electrolyzers. The results show that as PV-EL coupling is improved, the solar field is reduced while the size of EL becomes much larger; therefore, it would not be particularly advantageous to operate near to the maximum power points (which require lower current densities), even if they imply more favorable specific energy consumption. Organic electrolysis has the advantage of significantly lowering the primary energy requirements, although it should be accompanied by developments to improve current densities at the electrodes and reduce the costs of the electrolyzer. The use of other organic substrates that allow for cheaper reagent costs should also be investigated. The breakeven prices were determined for the organic electrolyzers that match them to conventional systems and ensure that hybridization with PV sources is cost-effective compared to non-autonomous energy solutions."
