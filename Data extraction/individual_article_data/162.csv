0,Introduction,"The search for economic and environmentally viable energy sources has stimulated the growth of energetic plantations throughout the world and has put the biofuels (alcohol and biodiesel) in a privileged position. The Brazilian government launched in 2006 the Agroenergy National Plan, the purpose is to stimulate the production of sugar cane, since the country is a great producer of biomass and the use of sugar cane bagasse on the plants provides the necessary energy for the industrial process and generates an amount of exceeding electric energy which can be used for other purposes. The hydrogen can be used in fuel cells for the production of energy, as well as stored in cylinders, commercialized or made available as an energetic vector [1]. One possible solution is to use an electrolyzer to convert this exceeding electric energy in hydrogen through water electrolysis, a process by which the water molecules are disassociated in order to obtain hydrogen and oxygen gases. There are several ways of obtaining hydrogen, but when considering its extraction from renewable sources, some stand out, the biomasses, solar energy, eolian, hydraulic and geothermal among others, allowing clean and abundant energy Garman [2]."
1,Biomass from sugar cane and cogeneration,"One fifth of all energy in the world is generated from renewable resources, approximately 13–14% from biomass. The adequate use of biomass brings environmental and social benefits such as: better use of land, jobs creation, use of available agricultural areas, supply modern energy alternatives to rural communities and reduction of the CO2 emission levels [2]. The energy resources from biomass may be classified in three main groups: the biofuels from wood; agrofuels (energetic plantations) and urban residues [3]. The sugar cane and alcohol agroindustry sector in Brazil stands out among the possibilities of distributed generation (DG), since the amount of biomass derived from this sector is larger than the needs of the alcohol and sugar production plants [4,5]. The energy matrix has 271 biomass enterprises in operation, from which 228 refer to enterprises that use sugar cane bagasse as fuel and a total of 18 cogeneration plants that use sugar cane bagasse as fuel, regulated by ANEEL [6]. The Brazilian production of sugar cane for the 2006/2007 crop reached a total of 425 million tons, that is, a quarter of the world production. The plants produce approximately 70% of sugar cane in their own land, rented or agricultural partnerships. The 30% left are supplied by nearly 45 thousand independent producers [7]. The production of sugar cane in large scale presents a great unexplored potential regarding the residuals [8]. Studies point that using only the bagasse, it is possible to generate about 3GW of electric energy in the country. According to the National Energy Balance BEN [9], the thermal consumption of the sugar cane bagasse grew 4.6%, reaching 106.5 million tons. On most agroindustries the use of energetic residues contributes for the reduction of the dependency on purchased energy, by generating steam or electricity. The sugar cane bagasse is an example of energy resource used in sugar, alcohol, meat packing, paper and cellulose industries among others [4]. As an example, the cogeneration has become an attractive alternative, since it combines an efficient use of energy with technological, environmental and economic advantages [10]. The high productivity achieved by the sugar cane culture, along with the successive earnings resultant from the transformation processes of the biomass from alcohol and sugar industries has made available a huge amount of organic matter in the form of bagasse in sugar cane plants and distilleries, which, interconnected to the main electrical systems, attend large consumption centers from regions south and southeast of Brazil. The creation of a governmental program called Program of Incentive for Alternative Sources of Energy (PROINFA) and the Law 10.848, regulated the DG in Brazil, boosted the generation of energy, awarding the undertakings based on biomass, qualified cogeneration, solar energy and wind power sources, with power under or equal to 30MW ANEEL [11]. The plants that explore the commercialization of exceeding energy more intensively, plan the future expansion of the sugar cane and alcohol activity, increasing the offer of energy. As there is no feasible way of storing large quantities of electrical energy, it must be used immediately or transferred to the power lines [12]."
2,Hydrogen,"The electrolysis is the cleanest way of obtaining hydrogen, mainly if the electricity is obtained from a renewable source, as the energy derived from the biomass. The world production of hydrogen uses 15% of biomass resources and 85% of fossil fuels [28]. The production of hydrogen through water electrolysis is a technology known for over a century, it provides advantages such as the use of electrical energy available, reduction of CO2 emissions and interaction with renewable sources [13], with widely spread technologies [29]. Brazil has a significant production of hydrogen for industrial consumption. In 2002, it has produced 425 thousand tons in order to supply oil companies, food, fertilizers and steel industries. In 2004, Petrobrás produced 180 thousand tons of hydrogen in its refineries, amount sufficient to generate over 2.4TWh of electrical energy. The country is the biggest busses producer in the world, with approximately 19 thousand units per year. Only in metropolitan area of São Paulo there are nearly nine thousand busses that run on diesel. These vehicles contribute significantly to elevate the atmospheric pollution. In case those engines were replaced by hydrogen ones, there would be considerable environmental benefits [14]. The study of the exceeding electrical energy potential of the sugar cane bagasse to generate electrolytic hydrogen Souza showed that one plant with crushing capability of 4 thousand tons per day could produce 1351kgday−1 of hydrogen, quantity that would be enough to fuel up 45 busses with autonomy of 200–300km, same autonomy of conventional busses using an average of 2.7l of diesel fuel in the city of São Paulo [15,32]. The Brazilian Hydrogen Bus Project, developed by the Brazilian Ministry of Mining and Energy since 2000 in partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Projects and Studies Financing (FINEP), foresees hybrid electrical traction (cell plus battery). The prototype is being manufactured and its performance will be monitored during the course of 2008. Based on the results obtained, other units will be manufactured in 2009 MME [16]. The production of hydrogen in large scale involves subjects as the way of storing it. Among the solutions used at present are, the compression of the hydrogen in cylinders or its cooling to the temperature of −253°C, when this gas becomes liquid, process that corresponds to 25 or 30% of its total energy and requires special materials and handling. In order to cool approximately 0.5kg of hydrogen, 5kWh of electrical energy are necessary [33]. Hydrogen can also be stored in a gaseous form or in intermediate compounds. Regarding the storage technology, the use of pressurized vessels for hydrogen in gaseous and liquid form; liquefaction and compression processes are consolidated, besides, there are also researches for the use of underground tanks. The applications for the hydrogen may be industrial ones (synthesis of chemical products, hydro processing, ammonia production, fertilizers, hydrogenated fat); transport fuel (vehicles, rockets and spaceships); thermal fuel; and electricity generation (fuell cells) [34]. In a research carried out in 2004, comparing the price of the electrical energy kWh provided by the energy companies in the city of São Paulo, for homes, the price of US$ 0.21 was obtained. The option of buying hydrogen is more expensive because the Nm3 of this gas costs in average US$ 0.43, price which varies according to the production cost, methods of payment, transport and volume used [35]."
3,Hydrogen production,"3.1 Hydrogen production For the production of hydrogen in large scale, high investments are necessary, such as the acquisition of electrolyzers, rectifiers, water coolers among others. There is also the cost with infrastructure or plant installation place. These costs are denominated as investment capital costs or fixed cost and depend generally from the production scale of the plant. It is also considered the electricity cost which is the main input for the production of electrolytic hydrogen [17]. The more economical way of producing hydrogen, according to [17] is using the coal gasification process, which presents environmental disadvantages, since during this process, pollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), azote oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) are emitted. In Spain [30] a study was made about energy good use by employing a photovoltaic solar generator, the conclusion was that it's possible to obtain cheaper hydrogen, without the emission of pollutants, by using solar energy, with technical means for production, currently available in the market [30]. In Germany [31] analyzed the production of hydrogen via water electrolysis by using eolian energy. The results of this study showed that the production of hydrogen by using renewable energy exceeding is an alternative for the solution of local problems, since hydrogen can be reconverted in electricity [31]."
4,Material and methods,"For the calculations of the potential for hydrogen production via exceeding energy, it was verified which plants cogenerate and which are regulated by the ANEEL, located in the central and south regions of Brazil. The calculations were made based on the total of sugar cane processed in the 2006/2007 crop, the average of total operation time, the electricity cost and the hydrogen production costs were calculated for each plant. The main references adopted to calculate the total of bagasse generated and exceeding energy, among others are found on Table 1 below."
5,Electricity costing,"4.1 Electricity costing Electricity is the main input, for the production of hydrogen, the electricity cost can be calculated by Eq. (1) [17]: (1) C e = C g E g + C bagaço where, (2) E g = P ot × t (3) P ot = B g × Q e The total cost of the investment is calculated by using Eq. (4): (4) C g = C Pcog × P ot × ( Frc + OM ) where: C Pcog - specific cost of the cogeneration plant (US$kW−1); P ot - power (kW); OM - operation and maintenance rates; Frc - capital recovery factor. For the calculation of the cogeneration plant cost (CPcog), it's used the equation below that estimates the investment on the cogeneration plant [21]. (5) C Pcog = 3315.1 × ( P ot ) − 0.2227 In order to calculate the capital recovery rate, it was considered the time necessary for the recovery of the investment costs, represented by Eq. (6) [22]: (6) Frc = d ( 1 + d ) n ( 1 + d ) n − 1"
6,Electrolysis plant costing,"4.2 Electrolysis plant costing The calculation of the specific cost of the electrolysis plant (C EL), is represented by the price of the electrolyzer and it varies according to the size of the plant, as shown in Eq. (7) [17,23] Based on the price of the electrolyzers, the specific cost of electrolyzers with different capacities is estimated according to the Eq. (7): (7) C EL = 1905.1 × ( C P ) − 0.2697"
7,Hydrogen production costing by using exceeding energy,"4.3 Hydrogen production costing by using exceeding energy The hydrogen cost is expressed by the ratio between the sum of the annual costs, the OM investment, electricity and the total of hydrogen produced during the year, it is obtained according to the equation [17,24]: C h = ( C 1 + C 2 + C 3 ) C 4 where: C h - hydrogen theoretical cost (US$Nm−3); C1 - investment capital cost (US$ano−1); C2 - operation and maintenance annual cost – OM (US$year−1); C3 - electricity annual cost (US$year−1); C4 - hydrogen annual production (Nm3 year−1); It's obtained the equation: (8) C 1 + C 2 = ( Frc + OM ) C EL P ot where: Frc - Annual capital recovery factor for the plant life span and annual operation and maintenance rate, according to Eq. (6); C EL - electrolysis plant cost (US$kW−1); P ot - power of the electrolysis plant (kW); (9) C 3 = P ot t C e ( 1 η r ) where: C3 - electricity annual cost (US$year−1); C e - electricity cost (US$kWh−1); t - plant availability (hyear−1); η r - electrical equipment efficiency. The annual production of hydrogen (kWhyear−1) is determined by the Eq. (11): (10) C 4 = P ot η el t where: C4 - hydrogen annual production (Nm3 year−1); P ot - power of the electrolysis plant (kW); η el - electrolyzer efficiency; t - Plant availability (hyear−1). By using Eqs. (6), (9)–(11), the cost of hydrogen is represented by the equations: (11) A = ( Frc + OM ) × C EL ( t η el ) (12) B = C e ( η el η r )"
8,Results and discussions,"Based on the information from the plants, a medium period of 202 days (4848h) was defined for the 2006/2007 crop, according to the Table 2 . Studies about the sugar cane processing in Brazil point that for each ton of sugar cane processed, 250kg correspond to the total of bagasse generated [20]. Based on the daily processing of sugar cane from each plant, it was calculated the quantity of bagasse produced. In order to calculate the amount of energy generated in each plant, it was established that for each ton of sugar cane, it is produced 132kWh−1, by using only the bagasse for energy generation [18]. With the quantities of sugar cane bagasse found in Table 2, it's calculated the power of each plant and then the total of energy generated in a year. Assuming that 7% of the total bagasse produced is considered as leftover [19], the amount of exceeding energy was obtained according to the processing of sugar cane in each plant. According to the electrolyzers models available on the market [25–27], it is needed, in average, 5.2kWh to produce 1Nm3 of hydrogen. For values analysis, the hydrogen total was transformed from Nm3 h−1 to kgh−1, that is to say, 1Nm3 is equivalent to 0.08988kg. Fig. 1 presents the data obtained by the calculation of the total energy generated and quantity of exceeding energy of each plant. These values are necessary to calculate the hydrogen production in kgh−1, it allows estimating the total of buses fueled, having autonomy from 200 to 300km daily. With the calculations of the production cost of hydrogen, it was verified that the transport cost of a hydrogen powered bus with autonomy from 200 to 300km is US$ 260Nm−3, for plants with processing capacity of 5 thousand tons of sugar cane daily. So, for a conventional bus, powered by diesel, assuming that the price of the fuel commercialized is US$ 1.27 per liter, it was verified that the transport average cost is US$ 143 keeping the same autonomy. Fig. 2 presents the costs of the electricity in US$kW−1, according to the price of the sugar cane bagasse on the plants analyzed. The calculation of the electricity cost in US$kWh−1 was based on the dollar commercial value on October, 2007. It was considered that US$ 1.00 is equal to R$ 1.80 and, according to information obtained from the plants, it was admitted that the price of the bagasse was US$ 9.00. As the capacity of processed sugar cane increases, the electricity cost decreases. This means that, in plants with larger quantities of processed sugar cane, the electricity cost becomes stable from 28 thousand tons of sugar cane processed daily. Larger quantities of bagasse result in lower prices per ton of bagasse. According to some data from a cogeneration plant (personal communication), the electricity price was calculated between US$ 0030kWh−1 and US$ 0025kWh−1. The transportation costs of the sugar cane to the plant were not considered on these values. According to the prices of the electrolyzers and the average of energy consumption to produce hydrogen, the specific cost of the plant was calculated (C EL), as shown on Fig. 3 . It is observed that the specific cost of the electrolysis plant decreased from US$ 2510kW−1 to US$ 1555kW−1. By increasing the production, there's a better use of the capacity, so, the variable and fixed costs are distributed through larger quantities of product that results in a lower cost of the electrolysis plant by kW−1. In accordance with [17] who studied the cost of the electrolysis plant from the secondary hydroelectric energy to produce hydrogen, it was verified that they depend on the size of the plant, that is to say, they get lower with the increase of the plant's production capacity. On Fig. 4 , it is verified the total of hydrogen that could be produced in Nm3 h−1 for each plant and the hydrogen cost in US$Nm−3. It is observed that the alcohol and sugar plants have potential to produce from 260 to 2155Nm3 h−1 of hydrogen and the production costs between US$ 0.50Nm−3 and 0.75 US$Nm−3. For [17] that analyzed the production cost of hydrogen via water electrolysis, by using secondary hydroelectric energy to produce hydrogen, it was verified that the costs obtained were US$ 0.17Nm3 for plants with production capacity of 1000Nm3 h−1. The author highlighted that, for the same production capacities, the cost via naphtha reforming is cheaper, varying between US$ 0.12 and US$ 0.14, although the hydrogen derived from the naphtha, coal and steam reforming of natural gas, emit CO2, which involves additional environmental costs [17]. For [1,23] that studied the production costs of hydrogen via electrolysis by using energy from hydroelectric plants, demonstrated that the minimum cost to produce hydrogen using secondary hydroelectric energy vary between US$ 0.4Nm−3 and US$ 0.09Nm−3 of hydrogen. On Fig. 5 , the hydrogen production costs are shown in relation to the hydrogen production capacity in Nm3 h−1, by using exceeding energy resultant from the sugar cane bagasse, with a discount annual rate variation of 8%, 12% and 20% per year. By altering other constant parameters, however varying the discount annual rate, it's observed that the hydrogen cost varies and tends to become constant as the sugar cane processing capacity increases. Although the production costs of the electrolytic hydrogen via secondary energy from hydroelectric power plants are lower than the hydrogen production costs using exceeding electrical energy in sugar and alcohol plants, it's noted that this would be an interesting alternative because there are growth perspectives for the Brazilian production of sugar and alcohol, with offer of larger quantities of exceeding electrical energy. As the possible forms and application of hydrogen were not studied in this paper, it would be interesting to analyze: the environmental benefits resultant from the substitution of the vehicles that use fossil fuels for the vehicles powered by hydrogen, acquisition of larger quantities of bagasse and sugar cane leaves to generate electrical energy, as well as analyze what the costs of hydrogen and oxygen resulting from the electrolysis process storage are, and the possible markets for the hydrogen produced in plants with potential to generate exceeding energy."
9,Conclusion,"In the sugar and alcohol plants there is a considerable volume of sugar cane bagasse, which leftovers are transformed in exceeding electrical energy. This energy can be used to generate hydrogen. The potential for the generation of exceeding electrical energy is 113MWh of energy, which would produce 21.738Nm3 h−1 of hydrogen. This amount is enough to supply 1563 busses with autonomy ranging from 200 to 300km on a daily basis. The potential for the production of hydrogen on the plants ranges from 260 to 2155Nm3 h−1 with costs between US$ 0.55Nm−3 and US$ 0.75Nm−3 which may become an attractive option for the cogeneration plants that produce exceeding energy."
