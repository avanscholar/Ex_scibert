0,Introduction,"Tobacco use (smoking) and chronic alcohol consumption are very common in the current culture and this significantly increases the risk for morbidity and mortality. Chronic alcoholism leads to various neurological, cognitive and psychiatric disorders such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, central pontine myelinolysis, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, pellagra, and cerebellar degeneration [1]. Interestingly, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is one of the most common chronic neurological complications in alcoholism [2,3]. Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is clinically characterized by cerebellar ataxia predominantly in the lower extremities [4]. Alcohol consumption often starts very early during the teens and typically continues throughout life. Current evidence indicates that there is currently a relatively high rate of alcohol consumption among pregnant women [5]. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with wide range of physical, mental, behavioral, and/or learning disabilities with possible lifelong implications in the offspring and this association is termed as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The proportion of pregnant women who smoke is estimated to be 20–25%, resulting in birth of several thousands of babies exposed to prenatal tobacco smoke annually in the United States of America [6]. The adverse effects caused by toxic substances from tobacco range from reduced placental function to long-term neurobehavioral alterations in the offspring [7]. Our previous study showed that prenatal nicotine exposure resulted in deficits in spatial memory, reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, and decreased basal synaptic transmission and synaptic currents gated by AMPARs [8]. Due to the protracted developmental pattern of the cerebellum, it is vulnerable to the effects of prenatal exposure over a relatively long period [9,10]. The intrauterine environment during the period of pregnancy is very critical, as alterations during this time may contribute to development of cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and mental illnesses in the offspring. Stress and toxic insults from extrauterine environment can significantly affect the intrauterine development of the fetus. Prenatal maternal cigarette smoking and/or consumption of alcohol carries several risks to the developing fetal brain. Thus, the cigarette smoking and/or consumption of alcohol can induce toxic insults to the major areas of the brain, cerebrum, medulla oblongata, pons and cerebellum. At the molecular level, alcohol and/or nicotine induces biochemical and neurochemical alterations in the developing brain of the fetus resulting in cognitive and motor impairment [8,11–15]. Reduced frontal lobe, total brain gray matter fusiform gyrus and temporal volume are commonly reported among individuals with prenatal exposures of alcohol and nicotine [16–19]. Prenatal nicotine exposure is believed to cause neurodegeneration and morphological changes in the amygdala and hippocampus [14]. Additionally, decrease in the cerebellum and temporal regions also has been reported [20]. There are several scientific evidences pointing towards cerebellar neurotoxicity in the case of chronic alcoholism [73,74]. However there are few studies which have elucidated the cerebellar neurotoxic effects and molecular mechanisms of combined alcohol and nicotine prenatal exposure. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the neurotoxic effects of nicotine in the cerebellum in a rodent model of FASD. In this current study, we evaluated the behavioral changes, markers of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase superoxide dismutase, catalase, monoamine oxidase), apoptosis (caspase-3), and mitochondrial functions (Complex-I and Complex-IV activity) in the cerebellum."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Animals,"2.1 Animals Time pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and osmotic mini pumps (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) were implanted, under isoflurane anesthesia, to deliver subcutaneous dose of nicotine at a rate of 6mg/kg/day. After 2days of recovery, 10% (v/v) alcohol prepared with 95% ethyl alcohol and tap water was administered for 12h per day during the dark cycle until delivery. Mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet Corp) were implanted by trained investigators under the supervision of veterinary staff following implantation methods as previously described [21]. We used model 1004 which is designed to deliver drugs at a rate of 0.11μl/h for duration of 4weeks. The pumps were filled as calculated and described by the Alzet mini-osmotic pump calculator on Alzet website. Based on the Alzet specification, we filled the reservoir with appropriate concentration and volume which are based on the animal weight. Osmotic pumps were implanted in all dams and either contained nicotine (6mg/kg/day) or saline. Mini-pumps were implanted on day-3 of pregnancy after conception to confirm that the pregnancy had taken place and the pups were dosed equally. The control rats received pumps containing vehicle. Osmotic mini pumps were removed 24h after the pups were delivered. The control rats received pumps containing vehicle. Auburn University IACUC approval was obtained for this study. Four time pregnant rats per group were used in the present study. The various groups were: (i) Control: tap water was administrated orally and subcutaneous saline via mini pump (ii) Alc: alcohol 10% v/v in tap water was administrated orally and subcutaneous saline via mini pump (iii) Alc+Nic: alcohol 10% v/v in tap water was administrated orally and subcutaneous nicotine dissolved in sterile saline to deliver 6mg/kg/day via mini pump After birth, five male offspring/group were used to elucidate the neurotoxic effects of nicotine in prenatal alcohol exposure in the cerebellum. The offspring were sacrificed six weeks postnatally. The dose for the present study was based on our publication [22] and other previous studies [23,75]. The dams consumed around 20ml of alcohol solution (equivalent to 6g/kg/day) which is comparable to 1–2 drinks per day for a human adult. The consumption rate of 6mg/kg/day is the most commonly studied dose for prenatal nicotine exposure in rats. This is thought to give plasma levels comparable to moderate to heavy smokers. Alcohol was administered during dark cycle, and then replaced by water during light cycle to prevent dehydration of the dams. Alcohol was administered during dark cycle because the animals are more active and usually drink the maximum amount. Food was administered ad libitum. In this experimental design the pumps were removed immediately after birth, so that offspring were not exposed to the drugs during the lactation period. Animals were housed in a vivarium maintained on a 12h:12h light:dark cycle (lights on at 6:00am) and at a temperature of 22–24°C. Pregnant dams were housed in single cages. Pups were housed in groups of three per cage. Pups were sacrificed by carbon dioxide euthanasia following the approved Auburn IACUC protocol. There was no significant difference in the number of pups per litter or body weight observed among groups. There were no significant changes in the weight of the cerebellum and whole brain in the Alc and Alc+Nic treated groups as compared to the Control."
3,Chemicals,"2.2 Chemicals All the chemicals used in the current study were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Behavioral studies: Rats were monitored constantly by examiners who were trained in evaluating different animal behavior. Straub tail, tremor and ataxic behaviors were monitored. The behavioral testes were preformed based on our previous studies with the neurotoxin, MPTP [24]."
4,Biochemical studies,"2.3 Biochemical studies Animals from each group (Control, alcohol only-Alc and alcohol+nicotine-Alc+Nic) were sacrificed in the morning to avoid diurnal variations of endogenous amines, enzymes, and other antioxidant molecules. Cerebellum from each brain was dissected out, immediately flashes frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The cerebellar homogenate for the biochemical tests was prepared by homogenizing the tissue in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH7.8), using a glass-Teflon homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 60min at 4°C and the supernatant was isolated [25]. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS): Spectrofluorometric method was used to determine ROS in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The mechanism associated with ROS generation was the conversion of the non-fluorescent chloromethyl-DCF-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, DCF-DA) dye to fluorescent DCF. The ROS generated was measured at 492nm (excitation) and 527nm (emission). ROS (fluorescence units) measured was normalized to total protein content as relative fluorescence intensity/mg protein [25]. The results are expressed as (%) change as compared to the control."
5,Assessment of lipid peroxidation,"2.4 Assessment of lipid peroxidation Spectrophotometric method using thiobarbituric acid was used to assess lipid peroxidation in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The index of lipid peroxidation was estimated by the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) at 532nm. TBARS was normalized to total protein content as TBARS formed/mg protein [25]. The results are expressed as (%) change as compared to the control."
6,Glutathione (GSH) content quantification,2.5 Glutathione (GSH) content quantification Spectrofluorometric method (327nm-excitation and 423nm emission) was used to determine GSH using OPT. GSH measured was normalized to total protein content and reported as relative GSH content (μM)/mg protein [25].
7,Glutathione peroxidase activity,"2.6 Glutathione peroxidase activity Spectrophotometric method was used to measure glutathione peroxidase activity in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The glutathione peroxidase activity was expressed as NADPH oxidized/mg total protein [25]."
8,Superoxide dismutase activity (SOD),"2.7 Superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) Spectrophotometric method using pyrogallol was used to measure superoxide dismutase activity in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The superoxide dismutase activity refers to inhibition of pyrogallol autoxidation/mg total protein [25]."
9,Catalase activity,"2.8 Catalase activity Spectrophotometric method using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate was used to measure catalase activity (240nm) in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The catalase activity refers to hydrogen peroxide oxidized/mg total protein [25]."
10,Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity,"2.9 Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity Spectrofluorometric method using kynuramine as a substrate was used to measure MAO activity (315nm-excitation and 380nm emission in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals). MAO activity refers to 4-hydroxy quinolone (μM)/formed/mg protein [25,26]."
11,Complex-I activity,"2.10 Complex-I activity Spectrophotometric method using NADH as a substrate was used to measure Complex-I activity (340nm) in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The Complex-I activity refers to NADH oxidized/mg protein [26]."
12,Complex-IV activity,"2.11 Complex-IV activity Spectrophotometric method using cytochrome c as a substrate was used to measure Complex-IV activity (550nm) in the cerebellum of the Control, Alc and Alc+Nic treated animals. The Complex-IV activity refers to cytochrome c oxidized/mg protein [26]."
13,Western blot analysis,"2.12 Western blot analysis Total protein was isolated using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (P 5726, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein concentration was measured using the Thermo Scientific Pierce 660nm Protein Assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Western blot analysis was performed as per our previously established procedures [22,25]."
14,Protein quantification,2.13 Protein quantification Protein was assayed using the Coomassie plus protein assay reagent kit. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard for protein measurement.
15,Statistical analysis,2.14 Statistical analysis The results are presented as means±SEM. Statistics were performed using the Prism-V software. The experimental data were analyzed using ANOVA following Dunnett's test for the comparison between various groups. Statistical differences were considered significant at p <0.05.
16,Results,"Prenatal exposure to alcohol alone and Alc+Nic did not induce straub tail, tremor and ataxic behaviors as compared to the controls. Alcohol alone and Alc+Nic exposure increased the ROS significantly in the cerebellum compared to the control (Fig. 1a, +51 & 77% respectively, p <0.05). Due to increased production of ROS, alcohol alone and Alc+Nic exposure significantly increased lipid peroxidation respectively compared to the control (Fig. 1b, +25 & 35% respectively, p <0.05). Furthermore, to counteract the increase in ROS, exposure to Alc+Nic significantly increased the glutathione content and catalase activity (Figs. 2a, 3b , +10 & 56% respectively, p <0.05). With regard to the other antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, prenatal exposure to alcohol alone and Alc+Nic did not affect the glutathione peroxidase (Fig. 2b) and superoxide dismutase activity compared to the control (Fig. 3a). With reference to the mitochondrial functions, prenatal exposure to alcohol alone and Alc+Nic did not affect the Complex-I and Complex-IV activity compared to the control (Fig. 4a, b). However, prenatal exposure to alcohol alone and Alc+Nic significantly increased the monoamine oxidase activity as compared to the control (Fig. 5 , +56 & 99% respectively, p <0.05). With respect to molecular mechanisms associated with the neurotoxicity, alcohol alone and Alc+Nic significantly decreased the expression of GluR1 (Fig. 6 , −15 & −43% respectively, p <0.05), ILK (Fig. 6, −19 & −21% respectively, p <0.05), and PSD-95 (Fig. 6, −10 & −20% respectively, p <0.05) compared to the control. However, there was no statistically significant change in the GSK-3β expression in both alcohol alone and Alc+Nic group compared to the control. Similar to ROS, alcohol alone and Alc+Nic exposure caspase increased expression compared to the control (Fig. 6, +7 & 21% respectively, p <0.05)."
17,Discussion,"The cerebellum controls numerous functions including motor skills, speech, cognition, emotion and eye movement. The motor cerebellum is linked with the motor cortex that governs movements; whereas non-motor regions of the cerebellum are linked with cerebral cortical “association” areas important for thought, reasoning, motivation, memory and feelings. The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome is the set of problems that arises when the non-motor cerebellum is damaged. It includes impairments in executive function, visual-spatial analysis and selected deficits in language skills as well as changes in personality and behavior. Moreover, the role of the cerebellum in dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, developmental delay and panic disorder, is under active investigation. Thus, cerebellum plays an important role in the etiopathology of the above neurological disorders. In general, the brain processes large amounts of oxygen in relatively small mass and has a high content of substrates (polyunsaturated fatty acids and catecholamines) available for oxidation in conjunction with low antioxidant activities [27]. Interestingly, the developing brain has significantly lower antioxidant enzymes and molecules as compared to the adult brain [27]. Alcohol is extensively metabolized into cytotoxic acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver. The acetaldehyde must be further oxidized to acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is present in the brain and is capable of producing reactive oxygen species [28]. Glutathione peroxidase is the most important antioxidant enzyme in the brain that metabolizes peroxides and protects cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. McCray et al. [29] indicated that glutathione peroxidase activity inhibits lipid peroxidation in cell membrane by preventing ROS attack on the polyunsaturated lipid membrane [29]. Decreased glutathione peroxidase activity can result in lipid peroxidation. Low brain MAO content and MAO inhibition by smoking may contribute to smoking decreasing the risk of Parkinson's disease [30]. However, there was an increased rate of smoking in depression [31] and in addictions associated to alcohol and other substances of abuse [32]. There was greater prevalence of smoking in psychiatric illnesses [33]. Increased MAO activity can increase the hydrogen peroxide content and ROS production. In the current study, we found that alcohol exposure significantly increased MAO activity, ROS content, lipid peroxidation in the cerebellum. Thus, the current literature and our study has confirmed the role of oxidative stress in developmental alcohol-mediated neurotoxicity, possibly via the formation of free radicals and/or decreased antioxidant levels [34–37]. Therefore, oxidative stress is a persuasive neurotoxic mechanism for the alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. One of the earliest effects of alcohol consumption on the liver is a change in the structure of mitochondria. The mitochondria are often enlarged and distorted, appearing either as swollen or elongated structures, with the cristae often disrupted or without normal organization [38]. Mitochondria are intimately involved in the generation of ATP and defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are themselves targets of oxidative stress and also contribute to mechanisms by which oxidative stress-related signals control cell fate. These cellular and molecular changes induced by prenatal alcohol exposure have resulted in some behavioral changes. The behavioral changes include anxiety [39,40]. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an intracellular protein kinase that regulates various cellular processes, including migration, adhesion, differentiation and cell survival [41,42]. Several studies have shown that hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex highly express ILK and plays an important role in neurite outgrowth, dendritic morphogenesis and neuronal survival [43–45]. To validate the above role of ILK, targeted deletion of ILK in mice forebrain displays cortical lamination and dentate gyrus defects during development [46,47]. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that impaired ILK in the hippocampus due to prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with memory deficits and synaptic plasticity alterations [22]. Furthermore, these altered ILK levels have been are associated with changes in downstream signaling molecules which results in cognitive impairment. PSD-95 can regulate neuronal synaptic plasticity through the trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, by interacting directly or indirectly with AMPA receptors and thereby providing links to transport motors, cytoskeletal elements, and/or regulatory kinases and phosphatases [48–50]. Over expression of PSD-95 has been known to increase synaptic localization of AMPA receptors and stabilize AMPA receptors at post synaptic sites thereby driving GluR1 containing AMPA receptors to synapses [51]. PDZ domain of PSD-95 binds to AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and interaction appears to be a critical event mediating long-term synaptic changes such as long-term potentiation and depression [52,53]. PSD-95 has been identified also as an important regulator of early neurite outgrowth and dendritic pattering [54]. Various studies have demonstrated association between GluR1 subunit of AMPARs and ILK expression [55,56]. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluR1 is required for synaptic plasticity and retention of spatial memory. Likewise in the cerebellum, AMPARs are also involved in neuronal/glial communication and regulate synaptic activity [57,58]. Thus, changes in the levels of PSD-95 and phospho-GluR1 may reflect the role that ILK plays in regulating these postsynaptic proteins. Furthermore, ILK has been shown to form a complex with PSD-95, GluR1 and phospho-GluR1 and synapsin. In our study, downstream to ILK, we found that alcohol alone and Alc+Nic significantly decreased the expression of both PSD95 and the GLuR1 subunit of AMPA receptor. This indicates that there is altered pre and post synaptic changes which might impair motor coordination, induce cognitive deficiency, and impair cerebellar function. Glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β) plays a role in psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases [59]. The involvement of GSK3 dysregulation in a variety of brain abnormalities strongly supports its pivotal role as a metabolic crossroads for controlling basic mechanisms of neuronal function from brain bioenergetics to establishment of neuronal circuits, modulation of neuronal polarity, migration, neuronal proliferation, and survival [60]. In the brain, GSK3 regulates developmental processes, including neurogenesis, migration, axon growth and guidance, and synaptic plasticity [61], and its activity is controlled through several signaling pathways activated by growth factors, wingless (Wnt) proteins, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), β-arrestin, among other proteins [62]. Phosphorylation at the Tyr216 site is necessary for optimal activity, while phosphorylation on the Ser9 residue inactivates the kinase [63]. GSK-3β has also been reported to be phosphorylated at Thr43 and Ser389 which are suggested to increase Ser9 phosphorylation [64,65]. Alcohol induces dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 and the activation of Bax as well as caspase-3 in the developing mouse brain and these alcohol-induced alterations were ameliorated by the pretreatment of a GSK-3β inhibitor [66]. In addition, alcohol has been known to drastically induce caspase 3 activation and apoptosis in neuronal cells indicating high levels of GSK-3β or the active form of GSK-3β increased cellular sensitivity. Hence, GSK-3β may be a mediator of alcohol neurotoxicity, and its expression status in a cell may determine alcohol vulnerability. Our results indicate that alcohol alone and Alc+Nic showed a trend towards decreasing pGSK-3β/GSK-3β ratio though the results were not statistically significant, suggesting a possible increased constitutively active GSK-3β activity. Similar results have been demonstrated in our previous study in FASD, where GSK-3β remains highly active (reduced Ser9 phosphorylation) leading to altered neuronal dysfunction [22]. In addition, Caspase 3 levels were higher both in alcohol alone and Alc+Nic group suggesting there is increase in apoptosis in the cerebellar neuronal cells. Nicotine has been clearly established as a neuroteratogen that compromises the development of critical neural pathways in the developing brain. Prenatal nicotine exposure in rodents causes postnatal hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, increased anxiety, somatosensory deficits, persistent neurochemical alterations, changes in sensitivity to nicotine, alterations in nicotine self-administration and altered patterns of neural cell survival, and synaptogenesis [67–69]. Prenatal nicotine has been shown to increase in ROS and activation of NF-κB by activating signal responsive to induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation [70,71]. Osmotic mini-pumps were removed within 24h following delivery and no ethanol exposure occurred after delivery; therefore exposure to these substances during lactation period was likely limited. However, it is possible that exposure during pregnancy period contributed to the deleterious effects of nicotine and alcohol exposure. Nicotine and alcohol are readily absorbed into the breast milk. Therefore, lactation may have deleterious effect. However, breast milk contains neuroprotective substances which can reduce the toxic effects of alcohol and nicotine. In our previous studies, we have shown that increased cholinergic and monoaminergic neurotransmission is associated with tremor and straub tail [24,72]. Based on our earlier findings, prenatal alcohol and nicotine exposure might not increase the cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Thus, they may not induce tremor and straub tail at this dose and duration of prenatal Alc+Nic exposure. In conclusion, our results show that prenatal exposure to combined alcohol and nicotine is relevant to the neurotoxic effects of cerebellum. Further research to discover new evidence regarding long lasting effects may inspire awareness and lead to decreased exposure and development of novel and potent therapeutic avenues."
