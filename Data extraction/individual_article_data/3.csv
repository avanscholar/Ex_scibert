0,Introduction,"Hydrogen, as a green energy resource, has been widely considered as a most ideal alternative to fossil fuel, which can effectively relieve the increasing energy and environmental pressure brought by population growth [1–5]. Aromatic aldehydes, as an important organic chemical raw material, have been widely used in agricultural and pharmaceutical industries [6–10]. Nevertheless, the traditional conversion of aromatic alcohols usually involves toxic oxidants that are harmful to the environment [11,12]. In our previous work, we designed a coupling system employing the inexhaustible and cheap solar energy for the photocatalytic conversion of aromatic alcohol into aromatic aldehydes and H2 [13,14]. In the bifunctional system, the photoinduced h+ oxidizes aromatic alcohols into the corresponding aromatic aldehydes and hydrogen proton (H+), then photoinduced e− reduces the formed H+ to generate H2. Obviously, the construction of the above-realize is beneficial to the synergistic utilization of photoinduced e− and h+ and undoubtedly possesses a broader prospect to relieve the energy and environmental pressure [15–17]. In this regard, many semiconductor photocatalysts have been widely used in the selective conversion of aromatic alcohols to aromatic aldehydes and hydrogen [13–17]. Among them, one–dimensional (1D) CdS is an extensively concerned binary metal chalcogenide because of its longing visible-light absorption, appropriate band gap and high-aspect-ratio structure [18,19]. Unfortunately, the high recombination of photoactivated e− and h+, insufficient active sites and seriously photo-corrosion depress the photocatalytic performance of blank CdS [20]. Therefore, it is ineluctable to discover an effective modification method to break through the barrier, among which the combination of cocatalyst with good conductivity and CdS to construct hybrid photocatalyst is a good strategy [21–23]. The introduction of noble metals (M = Pd, Pt, Au, Ru, etc.) as cocatalysts on the surface of CdS can effectively deal with aforementioned problems as photogenerated carrier separation and photo-corrosion, thereby enhance the photocatalytic performance of CdS [24–26]. Thereinto, Pt exhibits the strongest enrichment and transfer capability to photoactivated e− because of its highest work function, the best conductivity and the lowest overpotential [27–33]. Less desirable, such the earth-scarcity and high-cost of Pt restrict its extensive application in catalysis fields to some extent. However, this deficiency has been gradually overcome through optimizing the Pt dosage [10,13]. Therefore, it remains to be expected that the introduction of Pt on the surface of CdS will greatly boost the photocatalytic efficiency of selective organic transformation. In this work, we report a low-cost composite photocatalysts composing of 1D CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) and ultra-low-content 0D Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) prepared through simple hydrothermal and solvothermal methods. The as-obtained Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts exhibit excellent performance for the visible-light-driven selective conversion of aromatic alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and H2, which realize simultaneous utilization of photoexcited e− and h+. In Pt/CdS samples, Pt with high work function can not only enrich the photoexcited e− from CdS to promote effective separation of photoexcited charges and the reduction of H+ to H2, but also act as the active sites of H+ adsorption to improve the selectivity for H2 production because of its low overpotential. In addition, the photoexcited h+ left on CdS can selectively convert aromatic alcohols into high value-added aromatic aldehydes and provide H+. It is expected that this study will stimulate further interest in the reasonable modification of classic semiconductor for regulating the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of selective organic conversion and hydrogen production in one system."

2,Preparation of Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts The 3–4 nm Pt NPs were prepared according to the previous reported method. [34,35]. 36 mL deionized water was first added into a clean 100 mL three-necked round-bottom flask and heated to boiling, followed by the addition of 27 μL of 0.4 M aqueous solution H2PtCl6 and 880 μL mixed aqueous containing 0.05% citric acid and 1.0% sodium citrate. After 30 s vigorous stirring, 440 μL 0.08% NaBH4 solution was rapidly injected into the flask. After 10 min, the colloid solution of 3–4 nm Pt nanoparticles was obtained and cooled to room temperature. Pt/CdS samples with different mass percentage were synthesized by the following solvothermal method as shown in Fig. 1 . Firstly, 3.0848 g Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 1.5026 g thioacetamide (TAA) were dissolved in ethylenediamine (EDA, 60 mL) in a 200 mL beaker. After stirring for 10 min, a certain volume of as-obtain 3–4 nm Pt NPs colloid solution was slowly added to the beaker. After 20 min stirring, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 24 h. The prepared sample was eluted alternately with water and ethanol until the eluent was neutral, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts with different mass percentage of Pt (0.010%, 0.032%, 0.045%, 0.061%, 0.081%) were obtained and denoted as 0.010%, 0.032%, 0.045%, 0.061%, and 0.081%-Pt/CdS, respectively. In addition, CdS was also synthesized without the introduction Pt NPs for control experiments."
3,Instruments used for sample characterization,"2.2 Instruments used for sample characterization X-Ray powder diffraction patterns of the prepared samples were performed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, BrukerD8 Advance) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (UV–Vis DRS, UV 3600, Hitachi Co, Japan) was applied to measure UV–vis absorption spectrum with BaSO4 as reflection standard. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of samples were checked by specific surface and porosity analyzer (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2460). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Quanta 650) images were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The morphologies and microstructures of the photocatalysts were conducted by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), elemental mappings were obtained by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) attached to the TEM instrument. A photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Al Ka X-ray beam (1486.6 eV) was employed to conducted the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The binding energies were corrected by referring to the C1s peak of the surface adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were actualized by an EPR Spectrometer (A300, Bruker, Germany). Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were detected on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO FP-6500). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TR-PL) was recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh FS5)."
4,Photochemical and electrochemical analysis,"2.3 Photochemical and electrochemical analysis The photocurrent (It) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were implemented on a CHI-660E electrochemical workstation (CHI instruments) with a standard three–electrode cell to investigate the charge separation and the transfer resistance of the pure CdS and the Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts. The composition of the standard cell is as follows: the thin 5 mm × 5 mm Pt/CdS films prepared on FTO by drop coating and drying method is the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode filled with 3 M KCl aqueous solution is the reference electrode, and a Pt wire is the counter electrode. The electrolytes of It and EIS experiments are 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution and 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution containing K3[Fe(CN)6] (0.01 M) and K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.01 M), respectively. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300C, Beijing Perfect light Co. Ltd.) system equipped with a UV-CUT filter (λ > 420 nm) was used for visible light irradiation. The Mott-Schottky (M-S) analyses of Pt/CdS and pure CdS were implemented to evaluate the flat band positions (Vfb) of the as-prepared Pt/CdS samples, where 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution served as the electrolyte."
5,Study on photocatalytic activity and stability of samples,"2.4 Study on photocatalytic activity and stability of samples The photocatalytic hydrogen production was carried out in a commercial reaction system (Lab Solar 6A, Perfect Light Co) consisting of a top-irradiation reactor and a glass-enclosed gas circulation system. A xenon lamp of 300 W with a long-pass filter of 420 nm (λ > 420 nm) was used as the visible light source. A water-cooling system was applied to keep reaction temperature at 5 °C. Briefly, 100 mg prepared photocatalyst, unless otherwise notes, was dispersed in the mixed solution composed of 90 mL deionized water and 10 mL benzyl alcohol. Then the commercial reaction system was evacuated to dislodge air before visible light irradiation. An online gas chromatograph (GC-7806, shiweipx) with N2 as carrier gas was employed to detect the generated H2. After the reaction, 30 mL of ethanol was added to the reaction system, and the two-phase system was transformed into a single-phase system by stirring at 500 rpm for 5 min. The reaction solution was first centrifuged and filtered by polyether-sulfone aluminum membrane, and then detected by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters e2695 and PDA 2998). The mobile phase consists of 30% deionized water and 70% acetonitrile with a flow rate of 1 mL/min."
6,The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) analysis,"2.5 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) analysis The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.045%-Pt/CdS was calculated according to Eq. (1): (1) AQE ( % ) = 2 × r H 2 × L × h × c / ( I × λ ) × 100 where r H2, L, h, c, Ι, and λ are the number of generated H2 molecules, Avogadro constant, Planck constant, speed of light, and power and wavelength of incident light, respectively."
7,Results and discussion,
8,Photocatalyst characterization,"3.1 Photocatalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been employed to investigate the crystallographic structure of the prepared Pt/CdS and pure CdS samples. As shown in Fig. 2 a, pure CdS exhibits its basic diffraction peaks at 24.9, 26.5, 28.2, 36.7, 43.8, 47.9, and 51.8°, which correspond to (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3) and (1 1 2) crystal planes of CdS (JCPDS No. 77-2306). Pt/CdS composite samples exhibit almost the same diffraction pattern as blank CdS, indicating that the modification of Pt had no effect on the crystal structure of CdS, which can be attributed to the ultra-low content and high dispersion of Pt [10]. The UV–Vis DRS technique has been employed to evaluate the light absorption properties of pure CdS and x%-Pt/CdS samples. From Fig. 2b, the CdS shows a strong absorption threshold at around 540 nm. The corresponding band gap (Eg) of CdS is calculated to be about 2.30 eV according to the formula Eg = 1240/λ, which is very close to the result (ca. 2.30 eV) obtained from the Tauc plots (the inset of Fig. 2b). As the amount of Pt increase, the absorption in the 600–800 nm region (Fig. 2b) has no significant change and the Eg (2.30 eV) of 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample is almost equal to that of pure CdS, which indicates that the introduction of ultra-low content Pt has little effect on the light absorption performance and Eg of CdS. Significantly, the slight color changes (from bright yellow to dark yellow) of photocatalysts precisely confirm the successful load of ultra-low content Pt, as shown in the photos (middle inset) of Fig. 2b [10]. Moreover, the small change of the band-gap suggests that the modification of Pt is only a surface deposition process rather than an intrinsic doping process [33]. The microstructures and the morphology information of Pt NPs, CdS NRs and 0.045%-Pt/CdS were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The obtained Pt NPs show good dispersion and uniform size of ~3–4 nm as depicted in Fig. 3 a. Moreover, the d-spacing value of 0.23 nm corresponding to the (1 1 1) crystal plane of Pt indicates the highly crystalline characteristic of the prepared Pt NPs (inset in Fig. 3a). The prepared CdS NRs exhibit a rod-like shape with length and diameter of 300 nm and 50 nm respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b. With 0.045%-Pt loading, the CdS still maintained its rod-like structure with small particles along the edges of the rods, which can be attributed to the deposition of 3–4 nm Pt NPs (Fig. 3c). The HRTEM image of 0.045% Pt/CdS in Fig. 3d presents further evidence of Pt NPs deposition. HRTEM image near the spots area states clearly that CdS has a d value of about 0.36 nm corresponding to a typical CdS (1 0 0) plane, while the Pt NPs intimately covered the surface of CdS NRs possess a d value of about 0.23 nm, which is similar as that of Pt in the inset of Fig. 3a. The EDX mapping (Fig. 3e) shows that Cd, S and Pt elements are uniformly distributed in the sample. All the results verify the successful preparation of Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was employed to further investigate the surface elemental composition and the chemical valence states of the CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS. The survey spectra (Fig. 4 a) indicate that, with the exception of amorphous C and O, the obtained CdS semiconductor consists of Cd and S with an atomic ratio of 50.8%:49.2%, which is close to the theoretical values of 1:1. The survey spectrum of 0.045%-Pt/CdS is similar to that of pure CdS, but no Pt peaks were found, which can be attributed to ultra-low Pt content. As can be seen from the high-resolution XPS spectra in Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c, the Cd 3d peaks at about 411.4 (or 414.3) and 404.7 (or 403.6) eV are attributed to the Cd 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 state of Cd2+ (Fig. 4b) in pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS, respectively [37,38]. Meanwhile, the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 state of S2− in pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS are located at about 161.1 and 162.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 4c) [36–39]. Compared to pristine CdS, no shifts of Cd 3d and S 2p to high binding energy in 2.0%-Pt/CdS sample were found, indicating that the hybrid of Pt NPs and CdS NRs was only a simple deposition of Pt NPs on CdS NRs, that is to say the chemical states of CdS did not change because of Pt deposition. The high-resolution XPS spectra (lower image) in Fig. 4d did not confirm the existence of Pt because of the ultra-low Pt content, but two obvious Pt 4f peaks in the high-resolution XPS spectra of 2.0%-Pt/CdS were found at around 71.2 and 73.9 eV, corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 of Pt0, as shown in the upper image of Fig. 4d [10,19,33]. Therefore, according to the forementioned results, it can be demonstrated that the successful construction of Pt(0)/CdS photocatalyst can be realized through the established synthesis method."
9,Evaluation of production activity,"3.2 Evaluation of production activity To estimate the photocatalytic properties of pure CdS NRs and x%-Pt/CdS composite photocatalysts, the coupling redox system integrated the H2 production and the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) into benzaldehyde (PhCHO) was designed under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) for 4 h. Firstly, the photoactivities of the composite samples with different Pt loadings were examined to find the optimal dosage of Pt. As exemplified in Fig. 5 a, the pure CdS exhibits an exceedingly lower photoactivity for H2 production (6.0 μmol) and PhCHO generation (8.0 μmol) within 4 h. Significantly enhanced photoactivities of both H2 production and PhCHO generation can be observed when introducing Pt on CdS. With increasing Pt dosage, the photoactivities towards both reactions first increase and then decrease with a maximum H2 production (1.949 mmol) and PhCHO generation (2.215 mmol) achieved with 0.045% Pt loading, which are approximately 325 and 277 times as high as those over pure CdS, respectively. As we all know, Pt is an effective cocatalyst for photocatalytic splitting of H2O into H2 by reducing the overpotential of H2 production [13,19,40]. The molar ratio of H2 and PhCHO was used to check the effective utilization of photoinduced e− and h+. These suggest x%-Pt/CdS can availably promote the coupling photocatalytic system of the H2 production and the selective conversion of PhCH2OH to PhCHO under mild conditions, and the approximate 1:1 M ratio of H2 to aldehydes provides a good explanation for the efficient and synergistic utilization of photoinduced e− and h+, the atomic economy and the green chemistry. In addition, two other 0.045%-Pt/CdS photocatalysts were prepared by photo-deposition method [13] and solid–liquid self-assembly method which are denoted as 0.045%-Pt/CdS-G and 0.045%-Pt/CdS-P, respectively. It can be seen from (upper portion of the dotted line) Fig. 5a that the photocatalytic activity for H2 production and benzaldehyde generation of 0.045%-Pt/CdS-G and 0.045%-Pt/CdS-P are comparable, and are both much higher than that of pure CdS but much lower than that of 0.045%-Pt/CdS fabricated by our developed methods. It demonstrates that the performance of Pt/CdS highly depends on the synthetic method and the strategy of introducing pre-prepared Pt by thermal solvent method is a strong competitor to replace other construction methods for photocatalytic H2 production and PhCHO generation. The lower photocatalytic performance of Pt/CdS-G and Pt/CdS-P perhaps be respectively attributed to the uncontrollable morphology of Pt particles and the Pt particle shedding caused by the weak force between Pt and CdS. On the one hand, the preparation of solvothermal 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample was accomplished by introducing as-synthetized Pt nanoparticles into the process of CdS preparation, which better guarantees the homogeneity and size of Pt nanoparticles and immobilizes them uniformly and firmly on the CdS surface. These provide more reduction active sites, shorter electron transport distances and wider electron transport channels, thus effectively improving the transfer efficiency of photogenerated charges and photocatalytic reaction efficiency. On the other hand, the very small Pt nanoparticles densely loaded on the surface of CdS can effectively reduce the overpotential of the hydrogen production reaction, which will be beneficial to the overflow of the generated hydrogen, and then make the coupling reaction in the system forward. Furthermore, specific surface area and pore size distribution of the 0.045%-Pt/CdS and pure CdS were analyzed by BET, as shown in Fig. S2. The results imply that the inside structure of CdS NRs is not influenced by the modification of Pt and the enhanced photoactivity of 0.045%-Pt/CdS is indeed caused by the aforementioned properties of Pt. To verify the universality of 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample for the photocatalytic conversion of aromatic alcohols into H2 and aromatic aldehydes, the expansion experiments of different substrates (PhCH3CH2OH, XPhCH2OH (X = NO2 , Me, MeO, OH, F)) were conducted, as shown in Fig. 5b. Obviously, of all reactants, only FPhCH2OH exhibits higher photocatalytic performance for H2 production and aromatic aldehydes generation than those of PhCH2OH, while the other reactants display much lower photocatalytic performance than that of PhCH2OH. The possible reason is that F atoms with strong electronegativity can show strong electron absorption ability and promote the fracture of OH bond in FPhCH2OH. While PhCH3CH2OH and XPhCH2OH have the lower photocatalytic performance on 0.045%-Pt/CdS because of their weaker electronegativity [41–44]. Meanwhile, the miscibility of substrates with photocatalysts and water may also be an important factor affecting their photocatalytic performance [45]. Thus, compared with the solid PhCH3CH2OH and XPhCH2OH, the liquid FPhCH2OH is more convenient to mix evenly with water and photocatalyst and exhibit higher photocatalytic activity. However, it is clear in Fig. 5b that for all the reactants, the selectivity of converting aromatic alcohols into H2 and aldehyde is up to 90% or more because of the successful Pt modification (see the mechanism explanation of enhanced photocatalytic activity) [13]. Moreover, to verify the scope of application of the prepared x%-Pt/CdS samples, the hydrogen production experiments of HCOOH and DL-lactic acid as substrates have also been implemented, as shown in Fig. S3 and Fig. S4. The results indicate that the prepared x%-Pt/CdS samples also have excellent photocatalytic activities for the hydrogen production of HCOOH and DL-lactic acid, of which 0.045%-Pt/CdS samples is the best. A good photocatalyst should also maintain the good stability. To this end, we conducted the time extension experiments on the conversion of PhCH2OH into H2 and PhCHO over the 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample. As depicted in Fig. 5c, with increasing reaction time, the amount of both H2 and PhCHO increased gradually given that PhCH2OH is in excess, and their production rate reached up to 4.87 and 5.54 mmol·gcat −1·h−1 at 4 h, respectively. The molar ratio of H2 to PhCHO is approximately 1:1, suggesting a stoichiometric photocatalytic redox reaction in 18 h continuous testing and achieving the simultaneous and effective utilization of photoexcited h+ and e− in one reaction system. The selectivity of all the photocatalytic PhCH2OH splitting reaction under different extending time are greater than 93.0%, which is in line with those in Fig. 5b. Furthermore, to optimize the excitation wavelength, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) under different excitation wavelengths was also investigated, as displayed in Fig. 5d (orange dots). Under the light excitation of 450 nm, the highest AQE of 28.9% can be achieved. It is obvious that the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) is 28.90% when the wavelength of light is 450 nm."
10,Photoelectrochemical performance and possible reaction mechanism,"3.3 Photoelectrochemical performance and possible reaction mechanism The performance of a photocatalyst is often affected by many factors, such as the excitation, transmission and recombination of photogenerated charges [46–51]. Therefore, some photoelectrochemical methods were employed to investigate the enhanced photocatalytic activity of pure CdS and x%-Pt/CdS for splitting PhCH2OH into H2 and PhCHO. The photocurrent response experiments were first performed to analyze the charge transport performance. In Fig. 6 a, it is obvious that x%-Pt/CdS photocatalysts displayed quick, reproducible and stronger photocurrent responses than that of pure CdS during several intermittent irradiation cycles. Among of them, the 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample showed the strongest photocurrent responses, which was about 3 times higher than that of pure CdS, indicating the promoted separation and transportation of photoexcited charges and the photoelectric current intensity and the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. It can be attributed to the enrichment of Pt for photoexcited charges from CdS nanorods. In addition, it is known that the EIS plots under high frequency with smaller radius means the faster photoexcited charge migration. The fitted EIS plots in Fig. 6b displays that 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample possesses a smallest radius of the arc corresponding to the smallest charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to the typical metallic property of Pt. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were carried out to gain further insight into the recombination rate of photoexcited charges. Generally, the weaker fluorescence intensity represents the lower recombination rate of photoexcited charges. As displayed in Fig. 6c, the 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample shows a weaker fluorescence intensity than pure CdS, obviously illustrating that the recombination of photoexcited charge can be more effectively suppressed on 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample. Apparently, the aforementioned photocurrent, EIS, and PL experimental consistently indicate that the introduction of metal Pt is beneficial to the improvement of photocatalyst performance. It can be ascribed to the fact that Pt nanoparticles with good homogeneity and uniform dispersion on CdS nanorods can act as the enrichment centers of photogenerated electrons and promote the effective separation of photogenerated charges. The selective oxidation of PhCH2OH to PhCHO is determined by the appropriate valence band position. In other words, the valence band position of pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS samples should be between the oxidation potential of PhCH2OH (ca. 1.60 V) and PhCHO (ca. 2.02 V) [9,10]. Therefore, the band structures of pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS were investigated by the Mott-Schottky (M-S) analysis. In Fig. 6d, pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS samples show n-type semiconductor characteristics with positive slopes for the curve of 1/C2 versus potential. The flat band potential (Efb) of both pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS is measured to be about −0.68 V (νs. Ag/AgCl) by intercepting the tangent intercept of the x-axis in the M-S plots, indicating that the introduction of Pt has negligible effect on the Efb of pure CdS. In other words, the conduction band potential (Ecb) of pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS is around −0.68 V (equivalent to −0.48 V νs. NHE) because the Efb is approximate to the Ecb. The DRS (inset in Fig. 2b) indicated that the Eg value of both pure CdS and 0.045%-Pt/CdS was 2.30 eV. Consequently, the corresponding valence band potentials (Evb) of them can also be calculated to be about 1.82 V, which can achieve the conversion of benzyl alcohol to PhCHO (1.60 V νs. NHE) and avoid the deep-oxidation of PhCHO to PhCOOH (2.02 V νs. NHE). In addition, the Ecb potential (ca. −0.48 V νs. NHE) of 0.045%-Pt/CdS and pure CdS is more negative than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (0 V νs. NHE). Nevertheless, considering the weaker electrical conductivity of the CdS and the more serious photogenerated electron recombination, the performance of CdS for the selective oxidation of PhCH2OH to produce the corresponding PhCHO and H2 is much weaker than that of the 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample, which is consistent with the results of the photocatalytic experiment. In view of the above analysis, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic selective conversion of PhCH2OH to PhCHO and H2 on Pt/CdS under visible light irradiation was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Firstly, in the Pt/CdS samples prepared by the solvothermal method, the close and uniform loading of small and homogeneous Pt nanoparticles on CdS surface provide more reduction active sites, shorter electron transport distances and wider electron transport channels, thus effectively improving the transfer efficiency of photogenerated charges and photocatalytic reaction efficiency. Owing to the Schottky barrier formed at the intimate junction of Pt NPs and CdS NRs, the photoexcited e− in the conduction band (CB) of CdS NRs can rapidly transfer to Pt NPs, leaving the photoexcited h+ in the valence band (VB) of CdS. Secondly, PhCH2OH is deprotonated to generate PhCH2O−, and then h+ oxidizes PhCH2O− to form PhCH (O−), which is immediately oxidized by another h+ to generate PhCHO. Two released H+ are adsorbed on the surface of Pt NPs and reduced by the enriched photoexcited e− to generate H2. Finally, the Pt/CdS photocatalyst recovers to its original state and participated in the next photocatalytic coupling reaction. It should be noted the oxidation of PhCH2OH to PhCHO and the reduction of H+ to H2 take place in sequence."
11,Conclusion,"In summary, we have developed a bifunctional photocatalytic system to selectively oxidize aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes and simultaneously produce H2 under visible light irradiation. Compared with pure CdS, the photocatalysis performance of CdS modified with ultra-low content of Pt was significantly improved. With optimized Pt loading, the 0.045%-Pt/CdS sample exhibited enhanced H2 evolution rate and aromatic aldehyde production rate of 4.87 and 5.54 mmol·gcat −1·h−1 respectively, which is 325 and 277 times higher than those of pure CdS. All x%-Pt/CdS samples displayed outstanding stability within 18 h extending time experiments and excellent selectivity up to 90% or more. In addition, the substrate expansion experiments verified that the bifunctional photocatalytic system have excellent universality, especially for splitting aromatic alcohols with more negative substituents into corresponding aldehydes and H2. This work emphasizes the importance of anchor-structured photocatalysts and the advantages of bifunctional system for the photocatalytic selective organic transformation."
