0,Introduction,"The need for energy has been increasing globally because of the socio-economic growth of a country and the way that society consumes energy depends on the availability of energy resources [1]. Most developing countries have imported crude oil to satisfy the increasing energy demands; therefore, they have spent a large portion of their fixed earnings on purchasing petroleum-based products [2]. In addition, the issues of energy demand, air pollution, market competitiveness, constantly increasing fuel costs and the decrease in oil reserves in the world have encouraged the countries to search intensively for an alternative, efficient and renewable fuels replacing fossil-based fuels [3]. In this context, biofuels such as vegetable oil, biodiesel, and alcohol from renewable resources have been appealing alternative remedies in order to compensate for the increased energy requirements and to decline the emissions [4]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) presented that energy consumption has been rapidly increasing all over the world and it will raise about 53% by 2030 [5]. According to the United States Energy Information Administration projects, the liquid fuel consumption will reach from 86.1 million barrels per day to 110.6 million barrels per day by 2035 [6]. The high fuel efficiency, low operating cost, high durability, high power output and reliability of diesel engines have made these engines a leader in the vehicle market worldwide [7]. Diesel engines have been preferred especially in road, sea, and rail transportation sectors, agriculture industry, manufacturing industry, mining, military, and electricity generation sectors [8,9]. Furthermore, they have shown lesser exhaust emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) than that of gasoline engines [10]. Although there are different types of alternative fuels for the compression ignition (CI) engines, vegetable oils stand out as a promising and alternative candidate instead of diesel fuel. With this purpose in mind, the vegetable oils have been tried in the CI engines for a long time [11–13]. For instance, Shehata and Abdel Razek [14] showed the usage of neat sunflower oil and 20% jojoba oil-80% diesel fuel in the direct-injection diesel engine with evaluating the exhaust emissions, performance, cylinder pressure, and engine wall temperature. Additionally, Mat et al. [15] comprehensively reviewed the engine performance and emissions of straight vegetable oil and its blends with diesel fuel or alcohol-diesel blends as fuel in CI engines. However, vegetable oils have led to possible problems in the engine if the engines are not modified and also they possess several disadvantages. Short-term trials on the use of vegetable oils as direct fuels have exhibited that the solid particles are formed in the lubricating oils and that the lubricating oil deteriorates. The others can be regarded as follows: (i) carbon deposits on the injectors, cylinder walls, piston rings, and valve seats, (ii) reduction in the injector nozzle hole diameter, (iii) deterioration of spray characteristics and poor atomization owing to high viscosity, (iv) incomplete combustion, (v) difficulties of first movement and clogging of oil filter, and (vi) losses in the power and engine efficiency [16–18]. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the high viscosity of oil can be decreased before using in the diesel engines. For that, the preheating method could be suggested by researchers [19–21]. Also, it has been concluded that a diesel engine can run on a 20% vegetable oil-80% diesel fuel mixture without any engine alteration [22]. But, Agarwal and Rajamanoharan [23] tested karanja oil and its blends (10%, 20%, 50%, and 75% by volume) with diesel fuel in a single-cylinder agricultural diesel engine with and without preheating technique. They revealed that up to 50% of karanja oil blends with preheating as well as without preheating method could be used instead of net diesel fuel with improving performance and reducing exhaust emissions. Another study conducted by de Almeida et al. [24] performed heated palm oil as a fuel in a diesel generator to observe the performance and exhaust emissions. They noted that specific fuel consumption and temperature of the exhaust gas augmented with the increasing concentration of oil in the blends while decreasing in nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions as compared to diesel fuel. The other method to decrease the viscosity of the oil is to apply a chemical reaction. Though dilution, pyrolysis, micro-emulsion, and transesterification are the common chemical methods so as to decrease the viscosity of oils [25], the most preferred method is transesterification reaction for producing biodiesel [26,27]. Technically, biodiesel can be defined as mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or cooking grease. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, clean, biodegradable, renewable, sustainable and alternative fuel for diesel engine applications [28,29]. It has not contained sulfur and aromatics [30]. However, it comprises approximately 10–11% oxygen [31]. Further, biodiesel fuel exhibits similar combustion behaviors to diesel fuel. Therefore, biodiesel can be utilized compression ignition engines directly or by mixing with diesel fuels at any proportions [32]. In addition to the advantages mentioned above, there are some unfavorable fuel characteristics [33]. Some of them are high viscosity, poor low-temperature properties, high density, and low volatility [34]. Thus the pure biodiesel usage has been limited all over the world. In other words, most of the researchers have recommended the diesel–biodiesel fuel blends instead of pure biodiesel for the compression ignition engines [35–37]. The physicochemical properties of the fuel are very significant parameters for the engines throughout the atomization process. For instance, the viscosity of biodiesel is a very influential property in the dispersion of the fuel droplet size, mixture uniformity and the atomization quality [38]. As seen, the most important fuel characterization is the viscosity; therefore, the viscosity of fuel blend must meet the global biodiesel standards such as EN 14214 and ASTM D6751. On the other hand, most of the biodiesel’s viscosity cannot satisfy the requirement of the standards. The other technique for the reduction of viscosity and density of fuel sample is the addition of various alcohols which enhances the fuel properties of the fuel blend samples [33]. Although alcohols may not be used directly in the compression ignition engines, they are the most suitable fuel additives for diesel and biodiesel fuels owing to their fuel characteristics [39]. On one hand, the alcohols can be also considered to be efficient additives so as to decline the exhaust gas emissions and develop the combustion process due to the higher oxygen content. On the other hand, there is a limitation on the usage of alcohol as an additive because of low miscibility and low cetane number results in a larger ignition delay period in the combustion process [40]. For this reason, the utilization of ternary and quaternary fuel blends of vegetable oil, biodiesel, alcohol and diesel fuel in the diesel engines can be taken into consideration a possible choice to decrease the inconvenience of biofuels as mentioned above. However, the recent literature has shown that there are a lot of studies on the impacts of binary fuel blends include diesel fuel-biodiesel, diesel fuel-alcohol, or biodiesel-alcohol and ternary fuel blends include biodiesel-diesel-alcohol on the engine performance, and combustion characteristics as well as exhaust emissions such as CO, carbon dioxide (CO2), HC, NOX and smoke intensity. For instance, Emiroglu and Sen [10] used 20% cottonseed oil biodiesel, 70% diesel fuel, 10% alcohol (methanol, ethanol, and butanol) in a single-cylinder diesel engine in order to investigate the performance, emissions and combustion characteristics at different engine loads (0.09, 0.18, 0.27, and 0.36 MPa). Sayın [41] studied the influences of the methanol and ethanol–diesel fuel blends on the performance and exhaust emission profiles. The results revealed that CO, HC, smoke emissions as well as brake thermal efficiency (BTE) reduced while NOX emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased with using alcohol blended fuels. Jazair et al. [42] tested neat rapeseed oil as a direct fuel in the four-stroke, single-cylinder, and direct injection diesel engine at no load up to full load conditions under 1800 rpm fixed speed conditions. The straight vegetable oil gave higher NOX while lower smoke emission compared with diesel fuel at high load. Gumus et al. [43] performed the effects of fuel injection pressures (18, 20, 22 and 24 MPa) on the exhaust emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine running on biodiesel-diesel fuel blends. Atmanli et al. [44] studied the impacts of n-butanol-diesel fuel-cottonseed oil on the phase stability as well as performance and exhaust emissions in a compression ignition engine. They concluded that n-butanol was a very competitive alternative substitute for use in a diesel engine because of having many benefits. Tosun et al. [45] researched the impacts of various alcohol (methanol, ethanol or butanol) additions into the peanut oil biodiesel on the performance and emissions of a four-cylinder, four-stroke, and direct-injection diesel engine. Li et al. [46] investigated the emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine operated with diesel-pentanol and diesel–biodiesel-pentanol blends. Their results noted that the simultaneous decrements in NOX and soot emissions revealed at low partial loads. But NOX emissions were increased under the higher engine load conditions compared to the diesel fuel. Nanthagopal et al. [47] tested higher alcohols (1-butanol and 1-pentanol) blended Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel fuels at 40–60% concentrations by volume in the diesel engine in order to determine the combustion, performance and exhaust emissions. They noticed that the higher alcohol caused to decrease CO, HC and smoke emissions. Interestingly, the NOX emission of alcohol-biodiesel blends reduced due to the cooling effect of alcohol. Also, the combustion behaviors were trailed the identical pattern. Ashok et al. [48] prepared fuel blends higher alcohol-Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel by varying the proportions of n-octanol between 10% and 50% by volume and tested the effects of the fuel blends on the diesel engine characteristics. They indicated that the addition of a lower amount of n-octanol into the biodiesel fuel led to improve the engine performance outputs and to mitigate the NOX emissions with a remarkable penalty in HC and CO emissions. Thiyagarajan et al. [49] intended to investigate the impact of methanol and n-pentanol pre-injection into the inlet manifold by 10% and 30% on a mass basis along with safflower oil biodiesel as a prime fuel instead of conventional diesel fuel. The researchers observed that the efficiency was increased with 10% n-pentanol injection whereas the trend was reversed when 30% alcohols were tested because of the higher heat release rate with methanol for its latent heat of vaporization is largest. Besides that, carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and oxides of nitrogen emissions raised with the injection of alcohol while the smoke intensity decreased. Huang et al. [50] prepared n-pentanol/biodiesel/diesel fuel blends since biodiesel has a high viscosity value resulting in limitations in its compression ignition applications. They conducted an experimental study to determine the effect of the aforementioned ternary fuel blend on the performance and particulate emissions of a diesel engine under various engine loads (0.8 MPa and 1.0 MPa) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) (0–30%). The results showed that the heat release rate, maximum in-cylinder pressure, and brake thermal efficiency rose with the increase of load for the same EGR rate. The addition of 20% n-pentanol into 16% biodiesel/64% diesel fuel blend caused to increase heat release rate meanwhile peak in-cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency of ternary fuel blend were close to those of diesel fuel and B20. Jiao et al. [51] performed a simulation study to reveal the influences of biodiesel/diesel fuel blends on the exhaust gas emission patterns at several altitudes (0 m, 3500 m, and 5500 m). The researchers indicated that the NOX emissions were augmented while the particulate emissions were found to be lesser than that of neat diesel fuel under the same altitude. Atmanli and Yilmaz [52] analyzed comparatively higher alcohols like n-butanol and 1-pentanol blends with diesel fuel in the diesel engine. They found that higher latent heat of evaporation of both alcohols decreased the efficiency of the combustion takes place inside the engine cylinder owing to the quenching effect of the alcohols and increased the CO and unburned HC emissions in comparison with the pure diesel fuel. Also, higher brake specific fuel consumption and lower brake thermal efficiency occurred because the alcohols have lower energy content than that of diesel fuel. However, both alcohol-infused fuel samples exhibited favorable impacts on NOX emissions. Shrivastava and Verma [53] studied the effects of five different fuel injection pressures (180 bar, 200 bar, 220 bar, 240 bar, and 260 bar) and four different engine loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) on the engine characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel produced from Roselle oil. According to the experimental results, ignition delay period, smoke intensity, brake thermal and indicated efficiency values decreased while the increase in the in-cylinder pressure, peak pressure rise rate, exhaust gas temperature, brake specific fuel consumption, CO and NOX emissions were recorded with the increasing of injection pressure. Atmanli and Yilmaz [54] evaluated the semi-low temperature combustion behaviors of a compression ignition engine running on the waste oil biodiesel/C3-C5 alcohol blends at four engine loads (0 kW, 3 kW, 6 kW, and 9 kW) with a fixed engine speed of 1800 rpm. The addition of propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol into the waste oil biodiesel led to increasing the brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature whereas brake thermal efficiency reduced. Overall, they concluded that the above mentioned higher alcohols with biodiesel have positive effects on the reduction of harmful exhaust gas emissions, on the other hand, this caused to lesser engine performance. Zheng et al. [55] examined an experimental research on a single-cylinder diesel engine to understand the differences between the reactivity controlled compression ignition mode and blended combustion mode operating with n-butanol/biodiesel blends at various alcohol concentrations (20%, 50%, and 80%), EGR rates (0%, 30%, and 50%), injection timings, and loads (low, medium, and high). The outcomes exhibited that the ignition delay duration of a blended mode was extended than that of the first mode, and also had more precision to the alcohol percentage and EGR rates. Killol et al. [56] researched the influences of different n-butanol ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) in the Karanja oil biodiesel on engine performance and exhaust emissions of a DI compression ignition engine. According to the results, 15% n-butanol/85% biodiesel blend was found to be the most suitable fuel blend. Celebi and Aydin [57] prepared binary blends of butanol/safflower oil biodiesel and ternary blends of butanol/biodiesel/ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel including 5%, 10%, and 20% alcohol on a volume basis and tested these blends on a diesel engine generator set having the four-cylinder- four-stroke, DI diesel engine at 50% engine load with a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. Based on the results, ternary blends had lesser emissions and higher brake thermal efficiency values up to 1.5%. They marked that low percentages of butanol with biodiesel can be taken into consideration to be morepromising alternative fuels for diesel engine applications. Due to the harmful NOX problem of the utilization of neat biodiesel in the diesel engine, Mishra et al. [58] tested di-tert-butyl peroxide and ethanol-based fuel additives with waste cooking oil biodiesel in the single-cylinder diesel engine to report the engine performance and emission characteristics. They observed that maximum reductions in NOX, CO, HC, and smoke were 13%, 30%, 43%, and 45% respectively when the engine fuelled with blended fuel samples. As mentioned above, there is a limited number of works related to the quaternary fuel blends (biodiesel, vegetable oil, diesel fuel, and alcohols) using in the compression ignition engines. Although the utilization of biodiesel, bio-alcohol, and vegetable oil mixture in the diesel engine can raise fuel consumption, diesel fuel consumption will sharply decrease. Moreover, this would let to accomplish most of the deficiencies of using pure biodiesels and neat vegetable oils. The effects of various alcohol-vegetable oil-biodiesel-diesel fuel blends on the engine performance, exhaust emission characteristics, and combustion behaviors of the diesel engine have been presented and discussed below. Yilmaz and Vigil [17] studied the quaternary fuel blends consisted of 70% diesel fuel, 5% vegetable oil, 20% used cooking oil biodiesel, and 5% alcohol (ethanol, methanol or butanol) in a two-cylinder diesel engine in order to examine the performance and emission characteristics. According to the experimental results, the quaternary blends led to increasing CO and HC emissions while declining NOX emissions in comparison to the diesel fuel. They also indicated that the vegetable oil improved the lubricity. Yilmaz et al. [59] investigated the effects of biodiesel-vegetable oil-alcohol-diesel fuel blends on the engine performance and exhaust emissions of a four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine generator set under the four different engine load and at a constant engine speed of 1800 rpm. The fuel blends consisted of 10% alcohol (propanol or pentanol), 10% soybean oil, 40% waste oil methyl ester, and 40% diesel fuel. The results indicated that the quaternary blends caused to increase exhaust gas temperature, CO and HC emissions while NOX decrease. The brake specific fuel consumptions of pentanol added blends reduced slightly whereas propanol treated blends increased by 5.02% as compared to the neat diesel fuel. Appavu et al. [60] examined the varying pentanol (10–40%) and jatropha oil biodiesel (35–5%) proportions with constant jatropha oil (5%) and diesel fuel (50%) concentrations on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a single-cylinder diesel engine. Based on the results, brake specific fuel consumption and brake specific energy consumption were interestingly decreased with the increase of pentanol addition. Further, the reductions were observed in CO, HC, and smoke while NOX was increased with higher pentanol proportions. As a result, the quaternary blend having 40% pentanol concentration could be considered to be a suitable fuel blend choice in order to improve the performance and emission profile. As mentioned above, the literature survey exhibits that a number of works have been performed on the compression ignition engines in order to investigate the engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics of alcohol-biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel quaternary blends. Studies regarding combustion characteristics of these quaternary blends in the published papers are reasonably insufficient meanwhile compared to works concerning exhaust emission and engine performance unaccompanied. As far as we know that there is a necessity for conducting studies concerning the quaternary fuel blends, thus, this experimental investigation was handled in order to fill the gap somewhat. The aim of the study is to simultaneously and systematically investigate and compare the performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, and direct-injection diesel engine operating with diesel fuel, diesel–biodiesel (safflower oil methyl ester), diesel–biodiesel-vegetable oil (safflower oil), and biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel-alcohols under the various engine loads (0–1250 W) and at a constant engine speed of 3000 rpm. In this context, 80% diesel-20% biodiesel, 70% diesel-20% biodiesel-10% vegetable oil and 60% diesel-20% biodiesel-10% vegetable oil-10% lower alcohol of ethanol-C2 and isopropanol-C3 or higher alcohol of n-butanol-C4 and isopentanol-C5 on a volume basis were prepared and experimented."
1,Materials and methods,"In the present study, the influence of various alcohol additives into the biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel blend on the performance, combustion behaviors, and exhaust emission characteristics were comprehensively investigated. To this end, safflower oil biodiesel, safflower oil, diesel fuel, ethanol (>96.5% purity), isopropanol (99.7% purity), n-butanol (99% purity), and isopentanol (>98% purity) were used. Safflower oil was purchased from a local supplier located in Kırıkkale, Turkey. Safflower oil biodiesel (B100) was produced through the transesterification method using a laboratory-scale biodiesel production unit in Biofuel Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yozgat Bozok University, Yozgat, Turkey. The reaction conditions were given as 0.6 wt% of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 6:1 of methanol to oil molar ratio, 60 min of reaction time and 60 °C of reaction temperature. The transesterification can be defined as a process where an organic alkyl group R″ of an ester is switched by an organic group R’ of alcohol in the presence of a catalyst and hence, the formation of glycerol and fatty acid alkyl ester occurs [61]. The transesterification process was begun with the help of a clean beaker so as to store the safflower seed oil. This oil sample was heated up to 130 °C for 2 h to evaporate the excess water droplets in the oil and also reducing the viscosity of the oil. This pretreatment process will decrease the density of the oil and therefore the suspended carbon particles can be easily taken out from the sample by using a fine cloth filter having 0.1 mm mesh size [62]. Afterward, the safflower seed oil was filtered thanks to the qualitative filter paper prior to the using in biodiesel production to eliminate any undesirable impurities. The reaction was performed in a 2 L reaction flask mounted with a magnetic stirrer (Scilogex brand MS7-H550-Pro model), and reflux condenser. The thermometer was placed in the reaction flask to monitor the reaction temperature. First of all, the aforementioned amount of catalyst and methanol were mixed in the sealed glass bottle at room temperature (~20 °C) till entire the NaOH was dissolved in the methanol resulting in methoxide solution. The prescribed percentage of the safflower seed oil was taken into the reaction flask and then the temperature of the oil was increased up to 60 °C with the assistance of the heating magnetic stirrer. The transesterification reaction was realized at a constant temperature. The main reason for choosing this temperature is the boiling point of the alcohol which is 64.7 °C. Additionally, the reflux condenser system was used to avoid losing the methanol from the reaction. The transesterification reaction was carried out at 600 rpm stirring speed. When the temperature of the safflower seed oil was reached to the desired temperature, the prepared methoxide solution was poured into the reaction flask and the reaction time was started. The process follows a single-step reaction. After 1 h, the reaction was stopped and the sample was taken into a separation funnel for resting 8 h to sink the glycerol thanks to the gravity effect. During this period, the mixture was cooled down subsequently whereby separation of two phases was observed, i.e., glycerol and methyl ester [63]. The glycerol phase was discharged from the separation funnel through a drainage valve. A method followed by Singh and Verma [64] were implemented for further purification of the methyl ester. The upper phase of methyl ester was again sent to the reaction flask and heated up to 70 °C for 1 h to evaporate the excess amount of alcohol in the methyl ester. Then, the temperature of the crude safflower seed oil biodiesel was decreased to 55 °C so as to execute a purification process and this methyl ester was washed with warm distilled water till the biodiesel became neutral. The wastewater was removed with the helping of the separation funnel. In the end, the washed methyl ester was dried at 130 °C for 2 h to eliminate the excess amount of water in the methyl ester. Finally, the obtained biodiesel was again filtered with a qualitative filter paper. The yield of safflower seed oil methyl ester has been calculated using the Equation (1) [65]. As a result, the final yield of the methyl ester produced from the safflower seed oil was found to be at 97.2%. (1) Biodiesel y i e l d = Weight o f b i o d i e s e l p r o d u c e d Weight o f o i l p r o c u r e d × 100 Commercially available low sulfur No: 2 diesel fuel was procured from a local petroleum station in Yozgat, Turkey in order to use as a reference fuel. Table 1 tabulates the basic fuel properties of the biodiesel, vegetable oil, alcohols and diesel fuel used in the experiments. The fatty acid profile of the safflower seed oil and its biodiesel product were also determined using Shimadzu brand QP2010 model (Kyoto, Japan) Gas Chromatograph (GC) system equipped with DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm). The results were presented in Table 2 . It can be seen that the minimum and maximum values of fatty acids for both vegetable oil and its biodiesel is found in linoleic acid (62.39% and 61.20%) and stearic acid (2.69% and 3.73%), respectively. In the present study, six different fuel blends and one reference diesel fuel was tested in the compression ignition engine to investigate the performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics of this engine. First of all, the binary blend of safflower oil biodiesel and diesel fuel was prepared by adding biodiesel into the pure diesel fuel at the blend ratio of 20% (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel fuel) and labeled as B20. The main reason for selecting 20% biodiesel blend is a good balance of price, performance, exhaust gas emissions as well as capability of acting as solvents. Besides that, there is no modification required up to 20% biodiesel content in diesel fuel, thus, 20% concentration was selected as biodiesel content in the blends [63]. Then the ternary fuel blend of safflower oil biodiesel, crude safflower oil, and diesel fuel was formed at the ratios of 20%, 10%, and 70%, respectively on a volume basis. This ternary blend was called as B20VO10. Afterward, ethanol (C2 alcohol), isopropanol (C3 alcohol), n-butanol (C4 alcohol), and isopentanol (C5 alcohol) were separately blended with a ternary fuel blend, respectively. In other words, the quaternary fuel blends contained 20% biodiesel, 10% vegetable oil, 60% diesel fuel, and 10% alcohol. Namely, the obtained quaternary fuel samples were as follows: B20O10E10 (20% biodiesel + 10% vegetable oil + 60% diesel fuel + 10% ethanol), B20O10Pr10 (20% biodiesel + 10% vegetable oil + 60% diesel fuel + 10% isopropanol), B20O10Bt10 (20% biodiesel + 10% vegetable oil + 60% diesel fuel + 10% n-butanol), and B20O10Pt10 (20% biodiesel + 10% vegetable oil + 60% diesel fuel + 10% isopentanol). The biodiesel and vegetable oil concentration were kept constant in all prepared fuel blends. In order to prepare the tested fuels, the splash-blending method was chosen because of the most frequently practiced and inexpensive technique. It can be observed that all of the test fuels have not shown phase separation during the applications of the tests. The basic physicochemical properties of the test fuel samples used in the present experimental research were estimated with the assistance of the Kay’s mixing rule [67]. The general equation of the Kay’s mixing rule was represented underneath. The basic fuel properties of the test fuel samples were tabulated in Table 3 . (2) y = ∑ i k c i φ i where; y is the predicted fuel property, c is the blending ratio, and φ is the respective property of each component. The engine tests were performed at five different engine loads of 0 W, 500 W, 750 W, 1000 W, and 1250 W at a fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm. Moreover, the experiments of the tested fuel blends were realized under the identical engine operating conditions in order to compare with the reference fuel of diesel. Fig. 1 demonstrates the schematic layout of the test installation. The engine tests were achieved on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, naturally-aspirated, direct-injection diesel engine. Table 4 presents the technical specifications of the diesel engine and generator. The engine can produce a peak power of 6 hp at a fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm and it has a compression ratio of 18:1. For loading the engine, a series of electrical resistance units were implemented. The tests were also performed without any modification on the engine. All records were taken when the engine reached the steady-state conditions. The crank angle (CA), engine speed and top dead center (TDC) were recorded thanks to an incremental optic rotary encoder (Opkon brand PRI 50 model) connected to the crankshaft of the test engine. The gas pressures inside the cylinder were measured using a fiber-optic pressure transducer (Optrand brand H32294-Q model) having a measurement range between 0 and 3000 psi uses 1.80 mV/psi. The in-cylinder pressure data were measured in each work cycle up to 720°CA at a resolution of 1°CA. The pressure data was observed and recorded with the help of a digital oscilloscope (Rigol brand DS1064B model). The technical properties of the pressure sensor and encoder were shown in Table 5 . The exhaust gas emissions and smoke opacity were analyzed using an Italo Plus-Spin type exhaust gas analyzer and opacimeter. The technical specifications of the exhaust gas analyzer and opacimeter were given in Table 6 . Before the tests, the exhaust gas sensors were calibrated with the standard gases in order to avoid the experimental errors. A K-type thermocouple was also placed to the exhaust line for measuring the exhaust gas temperature. The fuel consumptions of the tested fuels were determined with the help of electronic precision scale and a stopwatch in comparison to the mass of fuel initial and final each 15 min trial at each load conditions for each of the test fuels. The measured emissions were converted into g/kWh according to the equations proposed by Pilusa et al. [68] after the completing the experiments. In order to get a consistent measurement from the test setup and avoid errors, the diesel engine was operated for 15 min prior to each experiment. Furthermore, exhaust gas emissions and exhaust gas temperature were measured three times to secure each emission data at the identical period and the averages were received. In addition, in order to eliminate the noise and reduce the cycle errors from the in-cylinder pressure data, a suitable filtering method was applied using Matlab software considering at least 20 cycles. Eq. (3) was used to obtain the heat release rate (HRR) according to the first law of thermodynamics. The wall heat losses were not considered while the HRR was calculated. (3) dQ n d θ = γ γ - 1 P dV d θ + 1 γ - 1 V dP d θ where; dQn (J) indicates to the energy amount passing through the cylinder wall and combustion chamber wall at the end of combustion, θ (°) is the crank angle, γ denotes the constant polytrophic exponent and is considered as 1.35, P (Pa) refers to the cylinder pressure and V (m3) is the cylinder volume. The start of combustion (SOC) corresponds to the point where the HRR diagram crosses over the zero transition [69].” The start of injection (SOI) can be found like the CA at which the injector opens the injector pressure set at 200 bar. The ignition delay (ID) is the difference between SOI and SOC. The possibility of errors forming in any investigation is high throughout the process of every examination. By all means, some of the errors occur from the researcher’s side even though most of them are formed randomly. The uncertainty of the study is generally figured out applying repetition the number of experiments in most cases. However, there is no chance to repeat the experiment because in specific cases in which there has high-cost involvement. Therefore, the researchers have to be careful to provide that the outcomes include a minimum error. When the uncertainties of the used equipment in the study such as pressure sensor, temperature sensor, exhaust gas sensors, etc. were taken into consideration, the overall uncertainty result of the present experiment can be calculated using Equation (4) [61–65]. The percentage uncertainty values of all the measured parameters were presented in Table 7 . (4) w R = ∂ R ∂ x 1 w 1 2 + ∂ R ∂ x 2 w 2 2 + ⋯ + ∂ R ∂ x n w n 2 1 / 2 where; R is the dependent factor and it is a function of independent variables x1, x2, x3,…, xn, wR is the uncertainty value of the results, w1, w2, …, wn is the uncertainties of the independent variables. The overall uncertainty value from the instruments being used in the experiment was found to be at ±2.66% using the following formula.

2,Results and discussion,"In the present study, the influence of quaternary fuel blends of diesel, safflower oil biodiesel, safflower oil, and alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or isopentanol) on the diesel engine performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion characteristics were investigated under five different engine loads (0 W, 500 W, 750 W, 1000 W and 1250 W) at a fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm. The outcomes as a function of engine load were portrayed and discussed comprehensively in the light of recent literature for brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOX), smoke opacity, in-cylinder pressure, HRR, and ignition delay period."
3,Effect of alcohol addition on the engine performance,"3.1 Effect of alcohol addition on the engine performance In this part, the influence of all prepared test fuels on the parameters of engine performance like BSFC, BSEC, BTE, and EGT was presented and discussed taking into account the recent literature. 3.1.1 Brake specific fuel consumption The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) may be defined as the amount of fuel required for generating one kW of power in an hour. Moreover, it indicates the efficiency of fuel for any engine and therefore presents a crucial role in the choice criteria of any fuel [73]. The BSFC values of the tested fuels accounted for the different engine loads at the fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm can be portrayed in Fig. 2 . From the graph, it can be observed that the BSFCs of the tested fuel samples were found to be at minimum values under the medium engine loads. Moreover, the BSFCs of the test fuel samples exhibited similar trends all the engine loads, as can be seen in Fig. 2. The alternative fuel additives such as vegetable oil, biodiesel, and alcohols caused to increase the BSFC. The aforementioned conditions may be owing to the calorific values of the test fuel (see Table 3). In this context, the required amount of fuel injected inside the combustion chamber in order to compensate for a specified amount of the loss of brake power accordingly [74]. Additionally, latent heat of evaporation, calorific value and the flash point of the fuel samples can be accounted for substantial indicators in the performance and combustion characteristics of an engine. The minimum BSFCs were determined with the reference diesel fuel at all engine loads because of its high brake thermal efficiency and heating value while the maximum was measured with B20O1E10. In other words, the test engine consumed comparatively lesser net fuel than the other tested fuels. The minimum BSFC values of diesel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were noted to be at 322.64 g/kWh, 343.09 g/kWh, 356.96 g/kWh, 417.09 g/kWh, 408.96 g/kWh, 370.73 g/kWh, and 365.35 g/kWh, respectively at the engine load of 750 W. The average BSFCs of the test fuels were increased between 4.54% and 27.82% as compared to diesel fuel. It is also evident from the figure that, pentanol addition into the ternary fuel blend led to decrease the BSFC according to the other alcohol types. This is because of the lower heating value of pentanol is higher than those of ethanol, propanol, and butanol, as can be seen in Table 1. These findings represent that the pentanol addition into the diesel–biodiesel-vegetable oil ternary blend can be implemented as an effective replacement fuel additive with regards to the fuel economy. Atmanli et al. [75] mentioned in their experimental study that the lower cetane number leads to becoming a longer ignition delay period and hence increases the quantity of fuel accumulation inside the cylinder prior to the initial ignition case along with the remarkable rising in the BSFC values. Yilmaz et al. [59] calculated the mean BSFC values for diesel fuel, biodiesel, B50, B40O10Pr10, and B40O10Pt10 as 443.78 g/kWh, 475.50 g/kWh, 461.28 g/kWh, 489.22 g/kWh and 460.22 g/kWh, respectively. They determined that the quaternary fuel blends consumed more fuel than that of diesel fuel owing to the lower energy content of alcohols. 3.1.2 Brake specific energy consumption In essence, the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) can be elaborated as the measurement of generated effectual energy from the combusted fuel that which gives a unit brake power per unit time. It is also well known that BSEC directly relates to the BSFC values of the fuel samples. An evaluation of BSEC rather than BSFC is taken into consideration as a more reasonable parameter in order to appreciate the capacity of any engine running on fuel samples which have dissimilar heating values, densities as well as other fuel characteristics [76]. The comparison of BSEC values for the test fuels with respect to the engine load was illustrated in Fig. 3 . As can be seen in the figure, it could be monitored that the mean BSEC value for the diesel fuel was found to be at a minimum as compared to the other tested fuel samples. In spite of the fact that the lower heating value and brake thermal efficiency of the baseline diesel fuel were observed as the highest, the alive and small BSFC values deactivated in the next. Similar findings were reported by Babu and Anand [77] and Ramesh et al. [73]. B20O10E10 fuel blend showed the highest BSEC values all the engine loads among the other fuel samples. This is because the peak BSFC figures of this fuel mixture as seen in Fig. 2 and lower calorific value (see in Table 1) as well as poor atomization characteristics, and extended ignition delay period due to the lower cetane number as compared the other tested fuel blends. Besides that this could be led by the larger oxygen content of the ethanol that is higher than those of other alcohols as seen in Table 1. Similar results were found in the recent literature published by Ashok et al. [78]. The BSEC values for diesel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were found to be at 17.99 MJ/kWh, 17.88 MJ/kWh, 18.65 MJ/kWh, 22.02 MJ/kWh, 20.35 MJ/kWh, 18.05 MJ/kWh, and 17.85 MJ/kWh, respectively under the highest engine load of 1250 W and a constant engine speed of 3000 rpm. In addition, the BSEC values for any certain fuel blend decreased up to 750 W while increasing after this engine load and the highest values were reached at the maximum engine load. The aforementioned happens can be owing to the decrement of the fuel consumption then increase after as seen in the BSFC graph. On one hand, the excess amount of oxygen content possesses a significant influence on the temperature of the combustion chamber interestingly and hence increasing consumption of fuel to generate a similar power outcome. On the other hand, the calorific value and atomization behaviors of higher alcohols improved the BSEC even though the diesel fuel concentration was decreased. In this context, the additives of higher alcohols like butanol and pentanol caused to have almost identical BSEC trends as compared to the neat diesel fuel the entire engine loads. It is also noted that the similar findings for BSEC can be accounted with the assistance of the earlier expressions. 3.1.3 Brake thermal efficiency The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) can be described as the ratio of the output power from the engine to the amount of energy procured by the fuel. In other words, the BTE is a substantial indicator of fuel conversion efficiency. The effects of different combinations of diesel, safflower oil biodiesel, safflower oil, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol on the BTE as a function of engine load (ranging between 500 W and 1250 W) at the fixed engine speed of 3000 pm were depicted in Fig. 4 . The diesel fuel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 gave the mean BTE values of 22.28%, 21.76%, 21.25%, 18.69%, 19.58%, 21.52%, and 21.63%, respectively. It could be observed from the graph that there was an increment in the BTE with a rise in the engine load however dropped vaguely from 1000 W to 1250 W. This inconsiderable dip could be led because of the less air–fuel ratio under the higher engine load operating conditions resulting decreased combustion output [78]. At the maximum engine loads, the temperature inside the cylinder increases and hence results in the enhancement of the vaporization which causes to improve mixing of air with fuel that aids to reduce the ignition delay period. In addition, at this engine load, the BTE reduced due not to have enough time for the complete combustion process of the fuel that is being injected inside the cylinder. According to the experimental measurement results, it can be pointed out that the conventional diesel fuel had higher BTE values than the B20 blend. This is owing to the higher heating value of the diesel fuel resulting in more energy being emitted and thus has larger BTE as compared to B20 as seen in Table 1. The matter of the fact that the comparatively lower BTE value occurs because of the lesser energy content of the fuel. Due to the same case, it could be also noticed that the lower BTE of the diesel–biodiesel-vegetable oil-ethanol and propanol quaternary blends in comparison with both the diesel fuel and B20 that have gradually higher heating capacity than the lower alcohols. In other words, higher alcohols additions caused to increase the BTE values as compared to the quaternary fuel blends contains lower chain alcohols owing to the calorific value differences. Accordingly, the minimum BTE values were observed in the ethanol-blended fuel combination of B20O10E10 among the other alcohol blends because of the lower calorific values of all tested fuels (see in Table 1). Among the quaternary fuel blends, B20O10Pt10 gave the best BTE values because of the larger heating value of B20O10Pt10 as compared to other fuel combinations. Additionally, a nearly completed combustion process is confirmed due to the higher oxygen content and results in the increasing BTE has been observed in comparison with the blends with lower chain alcohols. This situation was also declared by Wei et al. [79], who observed solely a lesser amount of difference in BTE when using pentanol addition as compared to the diesel fuel under all of the engine loads. Campos-Fernández et al. [80] reported that there were statistically no considerable variations in the BTE values with respect to the pentanol addition into the neat diesel fuel. However, Yilmaz et al. [59] found that the average BTE of B40O10Pr10 quaternary blend was similar to that of diesel fuel while B40O10Pt10 gave better results by 4.51% as compared to the diesel fuel. 3.1.4 Exhaust gas temperature The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) may ensure an attributive knowledge regarding the combustion progression in the engine [81]. The variety of EGT for the tested fuel samples at different engine loads was appeared in Fig. 5 . It can be noted that EGT is a vital role in the variation of the emissions released from the exhaust gas. Also, EGT heavily depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of fuel samples such as viscosity, density, cetane number, calorific value, etc. as well as engine working conditions like injection pressure, injection timing, compression ratio, etc. [82]. The measured EGTs of the tested fuel samples increased with the increased engine load. This caused to produce more heat because of more fuel being injected in the chamber of combustion resulting in higher in-cylinder temperatures. As a result, the maximum EGTs of the tested fuels were happened at the maximum engine load of 1250 W. The maximum EGTs for diesel fuel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were found to be at 430 °C, 340 °C, 382 °C, 315 °C, 308 °C, 266 °C, and 260 °C, respectively. The highest EGT values were measured as 215 °C-430 °C in the diesel fuel. The EGT with B20 was lower when compared to that of diesel fuel all of the engine loads. In Fig. 5, the quaternary fuel combinations show lower temperature distribution at each load of the test engine than the diesel, B20 and the ternary blend of diesel–biodiesel, vegetable oil. At this time, there is no substantial difference distinction between the EGT results of the quaternary blends, i.e. EGT of alcohol blended fuels were observed vaguely lesser than those of diesel fuel and B20. Among the alcohols, the addition of pentanol caused to becoming the lowest EGT values at all the loads of engine. It can be clearly said that the alcohols resulted in decreasing the EGT slightly due to the fact that the alcohols having high latent of evaporation can draw away the heat from the environment. It is worth mentioning again that the latent heat of evaporation of ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol are 918.42 kJ/kg, 727.88 kJ/kg, 581.4 kJ/kg, and 308.5 kJ/kg, respectively (adopted from Ref. [39]). Furthermore, the end temperature of the combustion reduces when any compression-ignition engine powered by the fuel, having a higher content of oxygen molecules in the structure and lower calorific value. The high oxygen content of the alcohol leads to reduce EGT with the aid of improving the rate of combustion as well [83,84]. In addition, EGT is function the ignition delay period and hence it may become a marker of the end temperature of the combustion. Another reason for decreasing the EGT using alcohol additives could have been due to the cooling effect of the alcohols. Yilmaz and Sanchez [85] stated that the cooling effects of the alcohols caused to decrease the gas temperature inside the combustion chamber. Similar findings in the descending of EGT when the alcohol addition were reported by the majority of the researchers. For instance, Cheung et al. [86] resulted in the diminishing of EGT values for the alcohol-treated fuel samples because of the lower heating value and larger latent heat of evaporation of alcohol. Although they presented that the smaller EGT led to descend the NOX emissions, this case would be elaborately clarified in the following section. Venu and Madhavan [87] indicated that the cooling effect of alcohol reduced the temperature inside the cylinder and led to becoming incomplete combustion resulting in higher total unburned hydrocarbon emission. The comprehensive relationship between EGT and exhaust gas emission were also discussed in the light of the current literature in the exhaust emission section. Otherwise, the opposite outcomes were found by Yasin et al. [88] and Yilmaz and Atmanli [89], who argued that the higher EGT values observed because of the higher oxygen content of alcohol resulting in more complete combustion process."
4,Effect of alcohol addition on the exhaust emissions,"3.2 Effect of alcohol addition on the exhaust emissions The various exhaust emission parameters such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, unburned hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, and smoke opacity are presented and further discussed in the light of the recent literature in order to make a deep analysis of the ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol infused blends with safflower oil biodiesel-safflower oil-pure diesel fuel. 3.2.1 Carbon monoxide emission Carbon monoxide, colorless, odorless and slightly denser than atmospheric air, is an exceedingly toxic gas for the human body in nature. The change of the CO emission level according to the various engine loads at the fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm was illustrated in Fig. 6 . The emission level of CO for all of the tested fuel samples increases with the increase of engine load. Therefore the maximum CO emissions were found to be at the maximum engine load of 1250 W. It can be noted from the graph that neat diesel fuel has the largest emission level of CO among the others at all engine loads. The elevated calorific value and higher temperature during the combustion process owing to the enhanced brake thermal efficiency can be the result of the high level of CO emission releasing from the exhaust. The CO emission also represents the loss of chemical energy via the emitting exhaust gases. In addition, the emission of CO footprints in the exhaust gases can be explained with the incomplete combustion process inside the cylinder of the compression ignition engines. This could have been caused by insufficient oxygen ratios in the chamber of combustion, i.e. the dearth of the surplus oxygen molecule in the medium further forecloses the transformation of CO to carbon dioxide along with assisting the CO emissions significantly. For this reason, the amount of oxygen molecule is a prominent parameter in order not to emit the CO emission within the exhaust gases. As seen in Table 1, both biodiesel and alcohols contain much more oxygen molecule in the chemical structure than that of pure diesel fuel. It can be concluded that it is not difficult to indicate that far lower of CO emission will be released from the exhaust when the compression ignition engine operating with fuel samples that involve these oxygenated fuel additives. Another reason is the cetane number of fuel to influence on the formation of CO emission. Biodiesel fuels have a higher cetane number than diesel fuel. In this context, it improves combustion efficiency. The cetane numbers of the tested fuel samples were also presented in Table 1. On top of it, safflower oil biodiesel as well as safflower oil which have native oxygen molecules in the structure release much smaller carbon monoxide emissions than that of pure diesel fuel at all engine loads. In addition, unsteady intermediate ketones and aldehydes occurred throughout the process of combustion and oxidize the carbon monoxide and nitrous molecules in order to generate carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions [73]. At the maximum engine load of 1250 W, the CO emissions were observed to be at 67.03 g/kWh meanwhile the CO footprints of B20 and B20O10 were found to be at 64.10 g/kWh and 53.15 g/kWh, respectively. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of alcohols into the ternary blends of biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel has caused to reduce the emission of CO remarkably beyond the B20 blend. The mean CO emissions of B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 quaternary blends were found to be higher than that of pure diesel by 32.71%, 33.86%, 40.43%, and 47.09%, respectively and further higher than that of B20 blend by 28.98%, 30.19%, 37.12%, and 44.15%, respectively. In other words, regardless of the kind, the addition of alcohol to the blend substantially decreased the CO emissions at all engine loads according to the diesel and B20 blend. However, higher alcohol of pentanol addition into the blend showed better characteristic for decreasing the CO emission than the others. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, the alcohols have much lower C atoms in the chemical bond (see Table 1) and hence lesser emission of CO formed. Similar outcomes were reported by the majority of the researchers. For instance, Li et al. [46] obtained decreased emission pattern of CO with using diesel-pentanol, diesel–biodiesel, and the diesel–biodiesel-pentanol blends in contrast to the diesel fuel. Akar [90] detected decrements of CO emissions when using diesel–biodiesel-butanol blend as compared to the pure diesel fuel. Sharon et al. [91] also found that the CO emissions of the compression ignition engine fueled with diesel-used palm oil-butanol blends were decreased. But, in the recent work of Yilmaz et al. [59] conducted on a stationary constant speed diesel engine generator set running on quaternary blends as mentioned above, the emissions of CO increased by 19.61–29.87% compared with diesel fuel. 3.2.2 CO2 emission One of the important indicators for understanding the complete combustion process inside the cylinder is the presence of the carbon dioxide emission in the exhaust gases. The comparison of CO2 emission values in g/kWh as a function of the engine load at the constant engine speed of 3000 rpm can be appeared in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in the graph, it can be clearly said that as the engine load increased the emission levels of CO2 increased strongly. The aforementioned in the diminishing of the BTE of the tested fuel samples can be related to the decreasing of CO2 emissions with an increase in the engine load. Among the tested fuel samples, safflower oil biodiesel-diesel fuel blend designates the highest mean CO2 emissions. The baseline diesel fuel, which has higher calorific value as well as lower kinematic viscosity than those of other fuels (see in Table 1), improved the BTE and descended the size of fuel droplet. Thus better atomization occurred and led to reducing the CO2 emissions. Furthermore, alcohols owing to their inherent molecules of oxygen in the chemical structure have reacted smoothly with carbon monoxide and revealed the carbon dioxide formation. On account of this, the alcohols have a very important influence on the formation of CO2 emissions in the exhaust gases. The mean CO2 emissions for diesel fuel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were noted to be at 372.06 g/kWh, 431.09 g/kWh, 267.78 g/kWh, 284.35 g/kWh, 356.13 g/kWh, 381.65 g/kWh, and 395.42 g/kWh, respectively. It can be found that the CO2 emissions for pure diesel fuel and B20O10Bt10 and B20O10Pt10 which contain higher alcohol of butanol and pentanol are almost similar and the difference is less than 7%. Consequently, the alcohol addition has led to a decrease in the CO2 emission in contrast to both diesel fuel and B20 blend. Akar [90] obtained the declining graph of CO2 emission level with using butanol as an additive into the diesel–biodiesel fuel blends. Randazzo and Sodré [92] found that the augmentation of the ethanol proportion in the B20 blend caused to diminish the CO2 emission level owing to the lesser C/H ratio for the ethanol molecule. This outcome is also in agreement with that found by Alptekin et al. [93] who indicated that CO2 emission of 60% diesel fuel-20% bioethanol-20% waste oil biodiesel dropped up to 7.1 in contrast to the neat diesel fuel at the engine load of 600 Nm. They explained the reason as the low C/H ratio of bioethanol. In this respect, C/H ratios of ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol were calculated as 4.001, 4.501, 4.802 and 4.999, respectively. Accordingly, there is a necessity to show far lower CO2 emissions of the ethanol-blended fuel than the other alcohol-treated fuel samples. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the minimum CO2 emissions were observed with B20O10E10 quaternary blend and following B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and lastly B20O10Pt10. When comparing with another perspective the pentanol addition to the fuel blend formed more CO2 emission than the others since pentanol has 5 carbon atoms but the others have 2–4 atoms. The quite different reason is due to the prevention of alcohols to the occurrence of a homogeneous mixture of fuel inside the combustion chamber. The carbon and oxygen atoms to which they did not have enough time to react decreases the speed of combustion and therefore a small amount of CO2 can form in the exhaust gases [82]. It is worthwhile to emphasize as the last word on about the outcomes that the prepared and tested quaternary fuel blends might be evaluated as a significant candidate to combat global warming all over the world. 3.2.3 HC emission The generation of unburned hydrocarbon emissions during the combustion process in the exhaust of the compression ignition engine is meant as the characterization of the combustion efficiency output. The HC emissions are evidently depended on the several parameters, for example, cetane number, air–fuel ratio, latent heat of evaporation and amount of the oxygen molecules of the fuel. In other words, the HC emissions are a significant indicator for the partial combustion of fuel [94]. In general, it is well known that the HC emissions have occurred from the burning of the heterogeneous air–fuel mixture in the cylinder throughout the combustion process. Besides that, the HC emissions are also formed because of the integrated impact of the various determinants such as fuel specifications, engine operating conditions and fuel injection [78]. In the present experimental work, the comparison of HC emission values for all the tested fuels according to the engine load at fixed engine speed can be observed in Fig. 8 . From the Fig. 8, the HC emissions of the tested fuels are found higher at high engine loads than lower engine loads and the maximum formation of HC emissions were measured at the highest engine load of 1250 W. The addition of biodiesel in the diesel fuel has led to a decrease the HC emissions. Meanwhile, the addition of alcohol as an oxygenated additive has caused to reduce HC emissions drastically at all engine loads. In contrast to the conventional diesel fuel, the diminishing in the HC emission for B20 blend was observed to be as between 1.72% and 4.46%. This is mainly due to the inherent oxygen content in the safflower oil biodiesel as presented in Table 1. The HC emissions for B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 decreased at an average of 39.15%, 51.81%, 26.00%, 32.73%, and 41.17%, respectively according to the pure diesel fuel. At the same time, the reduction ratios of HC emissions of them were calculated as in the order of 24.55%, 40.18%, 9.43%, 17.21%, and 27.66%, respectively as compared to the B20 fuel blend. When the outcomes were evaluated, the ethanol and pentanol addition has led to more decreasing the HC emissions than the other alcohols. These results are in good agreement with the findings of Atmanli [95] that noted that the pentanol was the most effective higher-order alcohol to decline the formation of HC emissions among the propanol and butanol. Mahalingam et al. [96] highlighted that the addition of 10% and 20% of pentanol into the neat biodiesel caused to decrease the HC emissions at ratios of 2.1% and 3.6%, respectively in comparison with the B100 at all the engine loads. In the recent literature, El-Seesy et al. [97] investigated the HC emissions of the diesel engine operating with the ternary fuel blend of biodiesel-n-butanol-diesel fuel and observed that n-butanol led to reducing the HC emissions owing to the lower density and viscosity values of the ternary blends. This case may be caused to improve atomization efficiency. The similar reductions were also compatible with the other researches performed by Deverajan et al. [98,99]. But, dissimilar results were observed from Yilmaz et al. [59] that the mean HC emission values of B40O10Pr10 and B40O10Pt10 quaternary blends were higher than that of B50 blend by 12.52% and 22.01%, respectively. This case was based on the lower cetane number of pentanol which was explained by Yilmaz and Atmanli [100]. Because it causes to the deep penetration of fuel opposite to the cylinder wall throughout the long period of ignition delay resulting in a quenching influence which concludes in higher HC emission formation. Sharon et al. [91] found this increment for diesel-used palm oil-butanol blends. 3.2.4 NOX emissions The sum of nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) refers to nitrogen oxides (NOX) in the exhaust of the internal combustion engine. The generation of NOX emission in the engine are heavily depended on the various parameters like the amount of oxygen, temperature inside the cylinder and residence time of the gases at that temperature [78]. The variation of brake specific NOX emission results for the tested fuels across the different engine loads with a constant engine speed of 3000 rpm was depicted in Fig. 9 . In general, the NOX emissions portray increments with the rising engine load for all tested fuel samples owing to the augmentation of the temperature in the combustion chamber [101]. The conventional diesel fuel showed the least NOX emission patterns with respect to all engine loads amongst the tested fuel samples. Safflower oil biodiesel, as literature recommend figures larger emissions level of NOX in contrast to the baseline diesel fuel because of the existence of native oxygen molecules in the chemical structure of fuel [102]. As a result of the combustion process, biodiesel occurs by-products such as aldehydes and ketones. They decrease the oxides of carbon and nitrogen. However, diesel fuel depicts the lowest emission of NOX. Other reasons for helping the lower concentration of NOX emissions in the diesel fuel could have been considered as follows: higher temperature of the combustion chamber, the existence of inherent oxygen molecules, better thermodynamic efficiency as well as higher calorific value [73,103]. In this respect, since B20 fuel is prepared from the blend of 20% safflower oil biodiesel and 80% pure diesel fuel, there is a necessity that it will have closer mean NOX emission level with each other. When Fig. 9 was examined, B20 portrayed similar NOX trend with the diesel fuel even though it has a much higher level of NOX emissions. This is mainly due to the cetane number and poor atomization characteristics of the biodiesel fuel. Addition of vegetable oil into the diesel–biodiesel fuel blend has not shown a significant effect on NOX emissions. However, the addition of alcohol to the ternary blend of biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel blend improves the oxygen concentration in the fuel blend resulting in poor combustion situations at the lower temperature of the combustion chamber. The aforementioned parameters conclude the reduction of NOX emissions as compared to the B20 blend even at the maximum engine load of 1250 W. The compatible results were found by Ashok et al. [104] that the oxygen contents of the fuel samples were improved by the addition of alcohol (hexanol and decanol) resulting in decreased NOX emissions as compared to the pure biodiesel while increased in comparison with diesel fuel. However, Kumar et al. [39] indicated that NOX emission level either rose or mitigated according to the influence of either heat of evaporation or cetane number. It is well known that the nitrogen needs higher temperatures in order to combine with the oxygen in the atmosphere forming NOX emissions. The excess amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber provides the temperature under control and thereby decreases the NOX emission levels. The mean NOX emissions for B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were observed as 1.52 g/kWh, 1.99 g/kWh, 2.25 g/kWh, and 2.43 g/kWh, respectively. As can be seen in the graph, the B20O10E10 blend figures the minimum NOX emissions among the other quaternary fuel blends. On the other hand, this fuel combination demonstrates slightly higher NOX emission than that of pure diesel fuel. In other words, the maximum NOX emission difference for pure diesel fuel and B20O10E10 is approximately 20.39% while this gradient dips to 2.56% at the maximum engine load of 1250 W. It can be noted that the alcohol addition into the fuel blends has led to decrease the NOX emission in contrast to the B20 blend. This can be explained by the cooling effect of the alcohols because this effect caused to the decrease in combustion chamber temperature resulting in lower NOX emissions [77]. The second reason is the higher latent heat of evaporation of alcohols (as seen in Table 1), and it indicates their transformation from liquid to vapor and therefore, NOX formation decreases. Ashok et al. [48] highlighted that the influence of the quenching regarding higher latent heat of vaporization of alcohol (n-octanol) has led to drop the emission of NOX formation. Ashok et al. [105] also reported that the large latent heat of evaporation lead the cooling impact concluding reduction in the temperature of the combustion process which assists to mitigate the NOX emission level because the NOX emission generation has a relationship both the oxygen content and the temperature in spite of the fact that the excessive concentration of oxygen molecule finds in the alcohol. 3.2.5 Smoke opacity Smoke formation in the compression ignition engines follows because of the desperately fueling that lead surplus fuel to be taken into the combustion chamber and on account of this generating a large number of rich fuel region in the cylinder. This excess fuel is not adequately combusted in the cylinder and thereby the burned in part. As a result, this case leads to becoming smoke emission in the exhaust. At the same time, lacking oxygen molecules, atomization quality, injection timing of fuel and improper air–fuel mixing are the other parameters that affect the formation of smoke. Smoke opacity has been measured as the degree where the smoke obstructs light. In essence, there is basically a need to determine the amount of smoke releasing from a compression ignition engine. The variation of smoke opacity values for the tested fuels across the engine loads can be observed in Fig. 10 . As seen in Fig. 10, the smoke opacity was measured to be as rising almost linearly with the increase in engine loads for all tested fuel samples because the quantity of fuel provided from the fuel tank ascended according to the load. In contrast to the pure diesel fuel, both biodiesel-diesel fuel blend and biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel blend forms formed the smaller amount of smoke from the exhaust. This is mainly because of the being of the excessive amount of oxygen molecules available in the chemical structure of fuel to which aids assisting the nearly complete combustion inside the cylinder. When the smoke opacity figure is evaluated, the mean smoke emission of B20 blend was observed as 1.07% lesser than that of pure diesel. In the case of quaternary blends of biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel-alcohol, tested fuel samples B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 produced 69.20%, 69.50%, 68.10%, and 68.44%, respectively at the maximum engine load. Within the all engine load range, it was noted that smoke emission is lower for the tested fuel samples including alcohol as compared to the same of diesel fuel. This can be clarified taking into account of the ignition delay periods of the alcohol added fuel samples and this can be an evidence for decreasing smoke emission. This case would have been also discussed in the following section. However, it is worth going through an overview in here that the alcohol addition into the fuel blends has led to increasing the ignition delay period due to the lower cetane number of alcohols. The extended ignition delay period supplies over time in order to obtain more mixing of fuel with products at elevated temperatures causing pyrolysis and hence generation of soot. The soot oxidation has been mitigated by the cooling effect because of the higher latent heat of evaporation of alcohols as seen in Table 1. It has led to forming a higher amount of soot emission. In other words, the higher alcohol-treated fuel samples showed lower smoke emissions than those of lower chain alcohol added fuel samples due to the fact that higher alcohols have larger latent heat of evaporation amongst the lower chain alcohols. In addition, butanol and pentanol have more carbon atoms in the chemical structure and hence brings forth carbon-rich regions resulting in more smoke emissions in the exhaust. Ilkilic et al. [102] detected that the smoke emission was decreased when the safflower oil biodiesel concentration increased in the blends. Kumar et al. [106] reported that the smoke emission of compression ignition engine could be controlled by the higher-order alcohol addition in the fuel blends. In similar kind of research work conducted by Ashok et al. [104] noticed that the smoke emission for diesel–biodiesel-higher-order alcohol ternary blends was lower than both diesel and B50 fuels owing to the existence of inherent oxygen content result in the reduction of smoke. Ashok et al. [105] also found that the addition of n-pentanol into the Calophyllum inophyllum oil biodiesel caused to decrease the smoke emissions as compared to the pure diesel fuel."
5,Effect of alcohol additive on the combustion characteristics,"3.3 Effect of alcohol additive on the combustion characteristics The combustion behaviors were analyzed by measuring the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate is calculated from this pressure data. The comprehensive discussions regarding the combustion characteristics are presented in the following section. 3.3.1 In-cylinder pressure The in-cylinder pressure is a substantial parameter that should be observed throughout the combustion process in order to investigate the performance characteristics of the internal combustion engine. It depends on the amount of fuel involved in uncontrolled combustion. The change of the gas pressure inside the cylinder according to the crank angles for all the tested fuel samples at various engine loads can be appeared in Fig. 11 . In order to better understanding the case of in-cylinder pressure of the tested fuel blends, the graphs were portrayed separately for the engine loads. From the graphs, the peak in-cylinder pressures were extracted and also presented in Fig. 12 . As can be seen in Figs. 11 and 12, the mean maximum in-cylinder pressures for diesel fuel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were observed to be at 70.59 bar, 71.82 bar, 69.87 bar, 66.17 bar, 71.51 bar, 75.51 bar, and 76.29 bar, respectively. In the case of the rigorous analysis of the pressure profile in the cylinder, it can be monitored that the maximum in-cylinder pressures for the tested fuel blends were found to be around 9–15° crank angle close to the top dead center (Fig. 12). In the present study, the expectation is that the peak in-cylinder pressure of the biodiesel fuel at different engine loads would be seemed to be lower than that of reference diesel fuel due to the low calorific value and poor fuel atomization properties. In other words, the diesel fuel, on the other hand, would be concluded the larger in-cylinder pressure pattern than that of biodiesel fuel because of high calorific value and atomization characteristics. But, the addition of biodiesel had an intermediate influence on the blend and improved the oxygen concentration in the fuel blend that causes to becoming better efficiency of the combustion and therefore increases the pressure inside the cylinder. At the same time, the addition of different alcohols to the biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel blend resulted in an increase in the maximum in-cylinder pressure except for ethanol. The mean peak in-cylinder pressure of B20O10E10 decreased slightly between 1.77% and 12.64% than those of diesel fuel. This aforementioned decline is briefly due to the highest latent heat of evaporation and lower calorific value of ethanol. However, the higher-order alcohols such as butanol and pentanol led to dramatically increase in the in-cylinder pressure owing to the high calorific value and low latent heat of evaporation amongst the other alcohols. Additionally, the ignition delay period was increased because of the higher latent heat of evaporation values of alcohols than diesel fuel. In that case, it can lead to reducing the temperature in the cylinder results in a delay in the ignition. The detailed information was also found in Section 3.1.4. to better understanding. However, a brief explanation should be presented here. When looking at Fig. 5, the reduction in the EGT values of alcohol added fuel samples were observed in the diesel engine. It can be said that the pressure curves were shifted towards the right when the blends infused with alcohols. In addition, the start in the combustion decelerates because of the small cetane number of alcohols and its blends with safflower oil biodiesel and therewith the shifts to the right for the alcohol-treated tested fuel blends. So, a higher amount of fuel was combusted in the premixed stage of the combustion, and hence the increment the in-cylinder pressure was appeared with the tested fuel samples. Babu and Anand [77] resulted with compatible outcomes and their experimental work presented that the test fuel contains 85% Karanji biodiesel, 5% diesel fuel and 10% hexanol showed the peak in-cylinder pressure of 64.2 bar at 10° crank angle after the top dead center under the engine load of 100% and it was close to that of diesel fuel results. Interestingly, Qi et al. [107] reported the reason as less cetane number of alcohols than diesel fuel and hence the ignition delay period extended and supplied to the more combustible mixture set by within the delay period concluded in higher cylinder pressure. Another reason was found by Anbarasu et al. [108] that the lower density and viscosity values ıf alcohol have led to improving the spray properties and hence, the better air–fuel mixture may be provided in the combustion chamber results increased in-cylinder pressure. In their experimental study, Ors et al. [109] found that more fuel burned on a sudden at the end of the ignition delay period since it kept back at the stage of start of combustion due to the lower cetane number. As a result, the in-cylinder pressure rose with the alcohol addition into the fuel blends. 3.3.2 Heat release rate The heat release rate (HRR) is a fundamental parameter in order to better understanding the combustion process taking place inside the cylinder of the internal combustion engine. It has been descriptive of the combustion stages as follows: (i) premixed combustion, (ii) rapid combustion, (iii) controlled combustion, and (iv) period after burning. In fact, the HRR presents an opinion regarding the net or total heat emitted in accordance with the engine crank angle [78]. All of the experimental trials for reference diesel fuel, binary blend, ternary blend and quaternary blends have been achieved at a standard fuel injection timing of 31° bTDC and fuel injection pressure of 200 bars. The variation of heat release rate with respect to the crank angle at different engine loads for all the tested fuel samples was presented in Fig. 13 . However, Fig. 14 was also portrayed the peak heat release rate values for the test fuels across the engine loads due to the restriction of the Fig. 13 graph space. Based on Fig. 13, the HRR values were progressively ascended with the increasing of crank angle thereafter reduce, and then further rise. The combustion characteristics of diesel fuel gave in larger HRR in contrast to the biodiesel blend at all the engine loads because of its higher energy content. When Table 1 was examined, the diesel fuel was approximately 10.03% higher calorific value than that of safflower oil biodiesel. The HRR values were found to be between 15.51 J/degree and 27.88 J/degree for diesel fuel and between 8.07 J/degree and 26.06 J/degree for B20 blend. This could be accounted for biodiesel fuel begins the combustion process earlier than unmodified diesel fuel because of the higher cetane number as seen in Table 1. In addition, the excess amount of oxygen molecules in the biodiesel chemical structure caused to improve combustion efficiency. In general, the ternary blend of safflower oil-safflower oil biodiesel-diesel fuel blend exhibited even lower HRR than diesel fuel and B20 blend. The HRR of B20O10 was observed as a 19.97 J/degree at the highest engine load. This is mainly due to the higher kinematic viscosity and density values of the safflower oil. Because the aforementioned fuel properties directly affect the combustion process. The higher kinematic viscosity and density have led to becoming poor atomization characteristics inside the cylinder [110,111]. The addition of lower and higher alcohols into the ternary blend of biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel results in comparatively lower HRR than that of diesel fuel at all the engine loads; except for ethanol-blended fuel sample. Due to the higher energy content resulting in better combustion characteristics, the diesel fuel showed better HRR. The mean peak HRR values of B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were found to be at 19.67 J/degree, 18.02 J/degree, 16.87 J/degree, and 16.44 J/degree, respectively, i.e., they were lower between 3.42% and 19.30% than that of diesel fuel. As seen in Table 1, the cetane numbers of ethanol, propanol, butanol, and pentanol were 8, 12, 17, and 20, respectively. Therefore, alcohol-treated fuel blends lead to a longer ignition delay period than that of the B20 blend. Furthermore, vegetable oil addition into the B20 binary blend resulted in poor atomization characteristics owing to the higher kinematic viscosity and hence even more time need to initiate the combustion process taking place inside the cylinder. As shown in Figure 14, B20O10E10 gave higher HRR than that of the other tested fuel samples at the higher engine load operating conditions. This may be clarified as the higher oxygen content, lower kinematic viscosity and lower cetane number. Namely, ethanol (34.78 wt%) has the highest oxygen amount in the bonds amongst the other tested alcohols. It is noted to be that the oxygen molecules inside the combustion chamber causes to enhance the combustion efficiency resulting better performance characteristics. As seen in Table 3, the kinematic viscosity outcomes of the quaternary fuel blends were analyzed, the least kinematic viscosity was found to be at 6.236 mm2/s for B20O10E10 and therefore this may lead to improve the quality of atomization process in the combustion chamber and even more fuel accumulated thanks to the ethanol. So, the sudden combustion process might occur and more heat released. The last reason can be the lower cetane number of ethanol. The cetane number is the most important fuel property that affects the combustion process. The lower cetane number causes to boost the ignition delay period in the cylinder. The detailed information about the ignition delay period was also presented in the following subsection. However, some important and necessity knowledge should be reported in here. As far as we know that the combustion characteristics of the compression-ignition engine operating with the quaternary fuel blends (biodiesel, vegetable oil or animal fat, diesel fuel, alcohol) have not been studied earlier even if the limited number of experimental works in the literature. Therefore, the discussion was not made in this section. However, it can be concluded that the present study can give an idea for the reader and further investigations. Fig. 15 was illustrated in order to investigate the correlation between peak heat release rate and the final NOX formation for each of the tested fuel samples under various engine loads. It can be monitored that the infusion of the short-chain alcohols and long-chain alcohols into the safflower oil biodiesel/safflower oil/diesel fuel ternary blend caused to become lesser peak heat release rate figures comparatively than that of pure diesel fuel at all the tested engine loads, nevertheless, ethanol-treated quaternary fuel blend exhibited opposite side. The conventional diesel fuel showed better HRR among the tested fuel samples because of the higher calorific value resulting in preferable combustion behaviors inside the combustion chamber of the engine. At the highest engine load, the peak HRR values for diesel fuel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were obtained as 27.88 J/deg, 26.06 J/deg, 19.97 J/deg, 30.26 J/deg, 26.55 J/deg, 26.31 J/deg, and 24.99 J/deg, respectively. B20O10E10 generated larger HRR than those of tested fuel samples under the higher engine loads. As mentioned above, one of the main reasons for increasing the HRR is the higher oxygen content of the ethanol which has 34.78% oxygen content in its molecular structure while isopentanol possesses only 18.18% oxygen content. The others are lower kinematic viscosity and cetane number. The alcohols have a considerably lesser cetane number than those of diesel fuel and biodiesel. In addition to this, the cetane number of ethanol is the least amongst the tested alcohols, as observed in Table 1. Probably, the oxygen molecules in the combustion chamber develop the efficiency of the combustion resulting in higher HRR figures. Due to the lower cetane number, the ignition delay period of the ethanol-blended fuel sample was extended and henceforth, an excess amount of fuel samples was accumulated inside the cylinder. Then, this fuel burned suddenly and a higher amount of heat was released. Therefore, the peak HRR of the ethanol infused fuel samples can be found the highest. In this context, the formation of NOX emission was examined for all the tested fuel samples, B20O10E10 blend fuel resulted in lesser NOX emissions amongst the other quaternary fuel blends. No doubt that the maximum NOX emissions would expect the ethanol-blended fuel samples because it has the highest HRR outcomes. But, the opposite findings appeared. Based on the emission results, quaternary fuel blend combinations exhibited slightly higher NOX formation in the exhaust. At the maximum engine load, the difference between B20O10E10 and diesel fuel is about 2.56% that was quite low. From a different perspective, it can be concluded that the alcohol addition caused to reduce the formation of NOX in comparison with the binary blend of biodiesel/diesel fuel. This case can be clarified with the quenching impact of the alcohol since this influence has led to reducing the temperature of the combustion chamber resulting in a lesser amount of NOX emission. In this regard, the exhaust gas temperature which is the main indicator for the combustion chamber temperature can play an important role in the NOX emission. The other parameter that affects NOX emissions is the latent heat of vaporization. Table 1 presents that latent heat of vaporization values of ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and isopentanol have 918.42 kJ/kg, 727.88 kJ/kg, 581.4 kJ/kg, and 308.5 kJ/kg, respectively. It means that they identify the exchange from liquid to vapor, and thus, NOX descends. On the other hand, there is necessary to perform more study on this subject to generalize the findings and to handle the combined effect of the fuel characteristics. Interestingly, there is a second-degree polynomial relationship between the peak heat release rate and NOX emissions. When the regression coefficient (R2) values were examined, the minimum and maximum results were found to be at 0.85649 for B20O10Pr10 and 0.97960 for B20O10E10, respectively. It has been well-known that R2 has to be close to being 1 for a better correlation. 3.3.3 Ignition delay period The ignition delay (ID) period in the compression-ignition engines can be described as the duration from the start of injection and the start of combustion process in the cylinder. The ignition delay period comprises physical delay and chemical delay. The atomization, evaporation and fuel–air mixture are eventuated in the physical delay period in the meantime; the pre-combustion process can associate with the chemical delay period. The ignition delay is depended on a number of parameters such as viscosity, latent heat of evaporation, cetane number, surface tension, etc. [112] The variation of ignition delay period values for the tested fuel samples across the engine loads (ranging from no load to 1250 W) at fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm is plotted in Fig. 16 . The standard fuel injection timing of the test engine was set at 31° bTDC for extracting the ignition delay period. The zero transition after the start of the injection process has been assumed as the start of combustion [69]. The ignition delay period decreased gradually when the engine load. This is due to the temperature of cylinder wall and temperature of the residual gases in the cylinder. The mean ignition delay periods of diesel fuel, B20 binary blend, and B20O10 ternary blend were found to be at 15.44°, 10.01°, and 14.46°, respectively. It is noted to be at a higher heating value of diesel fuel provide a clean and a smoother combustion process in the cylinder. But the ignition delay periods of B20 and B20O10 were 63.42% and 69.11%, respectively lower than that of diesel fuel at the maximum engine load. Since the safflower oil biodiesel has a higher cetane number than that of the unadulterated diesel fuel where the difference is approximately 7.12% as seen in Table 1, the binary blend of safflower oil biodiesel-diesel fuel blend exhibited lesser ignition delay period than that of diesel fuel at the full load condition. Interestingly, B20O10 blend shows in delay period in par with diesel fuel and B20 blend because of the distinction in kinematic viscosity, density and mixing capability of diesel fuel and B100. The addition of alcohol into the blends has led to decrease the ignition delay period at several ratios. The cetane numbers of the alcohols were presented above. The cetane numbers of the quaternary fuel samples were reduced with the addition of alcohol. Therefore this leads to delay the start of combustion process inside cylinder. However, the current experimental work results opposite outcomes in the ignition delay period viz the ignition delay period was decreased with the addition of alcohol in accordance with the diesel fuel. On the other hand, the ignition delay period of the quaternary blends were observed close to that of the B20 binary blend. Because the alcohol in the blends has led to enhance the density, kinematic viscosity, surface tension and oxygen amount resulting in the improvement of the atomization quality and weak engine operation followed by a lesser ignition delay period [113]. The lesser density value caused to improve the atomization process resulting in better combustion behaviors. As a result, it can be concluded from the below graph that the addition of alcohol in to the blend has caused to becoming in comparatively lower ignition delay period. Namely, the enhancement of the burning characteristics of the blends leads to prior the start of the combustion process in the cylinder particularly in accordance with the B20 blend. It could be basically assigned to the higher latent heat of evaporation properties of the alcohols showing from Table 1. The second reason can be the lesser carbon chain molecules in their molecular structures. As can be seen in Table 3, the C/H ratios were calculated as 6.700 for B20, 6.688 for B20O10, 6.405 for B20O10E10, 6.452 for B20O10Pr10, 6.480 for B20O10Bt10, and 6.501 for B20O10Pt10. On the other hand, in the recent study performed by Koivisto et al. [114] reported that the ignition delay period would be extended with using higher alcohols wherein up to 16 carbon atoms."
6,The contribution of the present experimental work to the literature,"The motivation of the present experimental work is to examine the effects of the various alcohols such as ethanol-C2, isopropanol-C3, n-butanol-C4, and isopentanol-C5 addition into the safflower oil biodiesel-safflower oil-diesel fuel ternary blends obtaining quaternary fuel blends as an additive at the constant concentration of 10% on a volume basis on the engine performance, exhaust emissions and combustion characteristics under five different engine loads (from no load to 1250 W) and at fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm. The percentages of biodiesel, vegetable oil, and alcohol in the blends were kept constant as 20%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. All the fuel samples were tested in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, naturally-aspirated, direct-injection diesel engine mounted with the generator for loading. The experimental findings of the present study were compared with other similar researches performed in the recent dates. For this purpose, Table 8 was prepared in order to do a better comparison of the outcomes obtained in this investigation with earlier studies. However, there is no doubt that a limited number of investigations were found in the technical literature to the best of the authors’ knowledge. When Table 8 was analyzed, several types of alcohol were implemented as an oxygenated additive and the vegetable oil content was not exceeding the 10% in the blend because of the higher viscosity and density values. At the present time, the ternary blends of biodiesel-alcohol-diesel fuel blends have been investigated by the majority of the researchers. On the other hand, there is a big gap in the literature adopting the quaternary fuel blends as an available mixture for the compression-ignition engine applications. In addition, the combustion behaviors of the quaternary fuel blends have not been performed in detail. As seen in Table 8, the current work and the previous studies indicated that the quaternary fuel blends caused to improving the exhaust emission characteristics in general while increasing the brake specific fuel consumption due to the lower energy content of alcohol. Furthermore, the results showed that the compression-ignition engine could be fueled with the quaternary fuel blends out of any major modifications on the engine. It can be pointed out that the present study might exhibit supplementary knowledge for using quaternary blends of safflower oil biodiesel-safflower oil-alcohol-diesel fuel in the unmodified diesel engines in the short term enforcement thanks to the experimental outcomes. Noticeably, this study will provide a perspective regarding the implementation of the quaternary fuel blend concentration to the new researchers so as to desire better engine performance, emission patterns, and combustion characteristics. However, there is a necessity that the stability of the quaternary fuel blends of biodiesel-vegetable oil-alcohol-diesel fuel has to be conducted with the help of a suitable testing procedure before the implementation for a long term application. By the way, there is no experimentation taking into account the long term durability and material compatibility as far as we know. Thus, we believe that these studies should be included in the literature."
7,A short evaluation of commercial impediment on biodiesel,"Nowadays, the production of biodiesel fuel from edible vegetable oils such as soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, safflower, peanut, and palm named as the first generation feedstocks has been exhibited serious problems; owing to the food versus fuel dispute. Particularly, they have caused to increase the starvation in developing countries. In addition, the other socio-environmental issues based on the usage of more cultivable areas and the displacement of rural populations from their marginal holdings can occur [115]. But, the biodiesel has been mostly produced from the aforementioned feedstocks; because of the presence in the countries. The economic feasibility of biodiesel heavily depended on the cost of raw material, biodiesel production method, technology, and type of alcohol and catalyst. Although the raw material of biodiesel is cheap, they have led to many problems owing to its high free fatty acid content resulting in an additional pre-treatment phase prior to the direct production of biodiesel [116]. In this context, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) seed oil is the most ideal preference to overcome the above-mentioned problems because safflower seed oil has not been consumed by humans at the desired level though it has a crucial potential as an edible oil source for Turkey. Therefore it can be evaluated in different areas. The overall, it is able to unlock the large working chance in different areas such as plantation, collection, extraction of oil and production of biodiesel. Besides that, in 2017, Kazakhstan took first place with 32.5% of the world’s safflower production. Kazakhstan was followed by Russia with a share of 14.7%, the USA with a share of 11.8% and Mexico with a share of 10.2%. Turkey was ranked five in the world rankings with a 7.2% share. It is to be noted that the safflower plant production in Turkey has followed a fluctuating course. The main reason for this is the biodiesel policies in our country in those years. During the years in which biodiesel production was promoted, the farmers increased their production areas. The uncertainty in the following years led to a decline in the cultivation area. As a result, safflower seed oil can be evaluated in the biodiesel production industry and hence, the pressure on the biodiesel cost can be mitigated gradually."
8,Conclusions,"The present experimental study deals with the influence of various types of alcohols such as short-chain (ethanol and isopropanol) and long-chain (n-butanol and isopentanol) with safflower oil biodiesel, safflower oil and diesel fuel blends on the compression-ignition engine performance, exhaust emissions, and combustion characteristics under different engine loads (ranging from no load to 1250 W) and at constant engine speed of 3000 rpm and the outcomes from the trials have been compared with the unmodified diesel fuel and B20 binary blend. The following findings were observed from the experimental study; • The quaternary fuel blends concluded in lesser brake thermal efficiency as compared to the diesel fuel and B20 blend due to their lower energy content than those of diesel and biodiesel fuel. Among the quaternary blends, B20O10Pt10 resulted in better brake thermal efficiency since isopentanol has higher energy content and cetane number than those of other tested alcohols. • Even though the minimum brake specific fuel consumption of the quaternary fuel blends were higher than those of diesel fuel and B20 blend, isopentanol added fuel sample showed better results owing to the aforementioned characteristics. The least brake specific fuel consumption values were found to be at 322.64 g/kWh for diesel fuel, 343.09 g/kWh for B20, 356.96 g/kWh for B20O10, 417.09 g/kWh for B20O10E10, 408.96 g/kWh for B20O10Pr10, 370.73 g/kWh for B20O10Bt10, and 365.35 g/kWh for B20O10Pt10, respectively at the engine load of 750 W. • The brake specific energy consumption values for diesel, B20, B20O10, B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were noted to be at 17.99 MJ/kWh, 17.88 MJ/kWh, 18.65 MJ/kWh, 22.02 MJ/kWh, 20.35 MJ/kWh, 18.05 MJ/kWh, and 17.85 MJ/kWh, respectively under the highest engine load. • The addition of alcohol into the ternary blends reduced unburned hydrocarbon emissions in contrast to the diesel fuel (which produced the highest HC emission) and B20 blend at all engine loads because of the lower density and viscosity values resulting in better atomization efficiency. The results showed that the ethanol and isopentanol caused to more reducing HC emissions than the other alcohols. • In parallel, the alcohol addition into the fuel blends caused to decrease the NOX emission when compared with B20 blend. The mean NOX emissions for B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were observed as 1.52 g/kWh, 1.80 g/kWh, 2.05 g/kWh, and 2.07 g/kWh, respectively. On the one hand, this is mainly due to the quenching influence of the alcohols resulting in decreasing the temperature of the combustion chamber. On the other hand, the higher latent heat of evaporation of alcohols and it indicates their transformation from liquid to vapor and therefore, NOX formation decreases. • On the contrary, the average CO emissions of the quaternary fuel blends were observed as a higher than those of diesel fuel and B20 blend. These followed a similar order of (lowest to highest): B20O10E10 < B20O10Pr10 < B20O10Bt10 < B20O10Pt10 < B20O10 < B20 < diesel fuel. • The addition of lower and higher alcohols into the ternary blend of biodiesel-vegetable oil-diesel fuel results in comparatively lower HRR than that of diesel fuel at all the engine loads owing to the lower energy content except for ethanol-blended fuel sample. • The addition of alcohol into the blends has led to decrease the ignition delay period at several ratios because the alcohols caused to improve the density, kinematic viscosity, surface tension and oxygen amount resulting in the improvement of the atomization quality and weak engine operation followed by a lesser ignition delay period. • While the average peak in-cylinder pressures for B20O10E10, B20O10Pr10, B20O10Bt10, and B20O10Pt10 were found to be at 66.17 bar, 71.51 bar, 75.51 bar, and 76.29 bar, respectively, diesel fuel, B20, and B20O10 achieved as 70.59 bar, 71.82 bar, 69.87 bar, respectively. In addition to this, it can be monitored that the maximum in-cylinder pressures for the tested fuel blends were found to be around 9–15° crank angle close to the TDC. In brief, it could be recommended that the lower and higher alcohols may be evaluated as an available oxygenated additive to the safflower oil biodiesel because of their enhanced characteristics. Also, alcohols showed critical reductions in the NOX emissions in the compression-ignition applications. However, isopentanol could be stood out among the alcohols when the overall performance was taken into consideration."
