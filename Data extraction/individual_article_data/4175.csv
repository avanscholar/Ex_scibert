0,Introduction,"In recent decades, the continuous development and promotion of industrialization, modernization, urbanization, and globalization have extremely increased natural resource expenditure and fossil fuel consumption, leading to vast quantities of CO2, SO2, and NOx release and significant amounts of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere (Mofijur et al., 2013a). Subsequently, an array of grave problems have arisen, such as acid rain, air pollution, ozone layer loss, global warming, and desertification, posing a serious threat to public health and environmental sustainability (Lee et al., 2020). However, the emergence of sustainable and environmentally friendly biofuels has the potential to alleviate this situation by diversifying the global energy portfolio, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigating negative influences on the environment (Goh et al., 2020). The International Energy Agency (2011) reports that 27% of transport fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels, will be substituted by biofuels by 2050. Accordingly, many researchers are undertaking studies in this field, mainly focusing on the selection of feedstocks, optimization of reaction conditions, equipment improvement, process design, conversion methods, and economic assessment, and have been achieving fruitful results. Fig. 1 depicts the chief biomass types, conversion methods, and final products of biomass conversion process. The two primary method categories of biomass conversion, thermochemical and biochemical conversion, currently include six individual conversion techniques. While only pyrolysis can generate various high-value products, such as biochar, bio-oil, biogas, and chemicals (Salama et al., 2018). Biofuels can be classified into three broad generations based on the different raw materials and sources. First-generation biofuels are derived mainly from animal fats or edible crops like fish oil, corn, sugarcane, sorghum, and potato, which contain high fat, sugar, and starch content. Nevertheless, the application of first-generation biofuels has caused a series of problems, including cultivated land occupancy, water crises, and fuel versus food feuds (Sipra et al., 2018). Second-generation biofuels are primarily produced from agricultural, industrial, and municipal waste, including lignocellulosic biomass, plastic waste, medical waste, and food waste. This can not only generate valuable products, but also provides some social, environmental, and economic benefits. However, some problems have impeded the development, promotion, and commercialization of second-generation biofuels, especially the high transportation and pretreatment cost (Chen et al., 2020). Third-generation biofuels originate from photosynthetic microbes such as microalgae, cyanobacteria, and algae (Siddiki et al., 2022). Photosynthetic microbes exhibit numerous overriding advantages like high oil content, exponential growth rates, good CO2 capture ability, and non-selective growth conditions (Enamala et al., 2018). However, the huge cost of cultivating and harvesting and the low productivity are still key bottlenecks (Ahmed et al., 2022). Meanwhile, a typical second-generation feedstock has attracted increasing attention globally because of its economic viability, wide availability, low price, and outstanding characteristics. Waste oils, which are degraded or contaminated liquid products, mainly come from industrial production, agricultural production, and daily life. Typically, they are hazardous substances that jeopardize the existence and development of human being without proper management (Jung et al., 2018). Waste oils like waste cooking oil and waste lubricant oil are cheap and abundant sources of carbon (Khodadadi et al., 2020). It is estimated that over 16.54 million tons of waste cooking oil and approximately 39 million tons of waste lubricant oil are produced globally every year (Hamdan et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017a). In China alone, about 5 million tons of waste cooking oil are generated annually (W. Zhang et al., 2020). However, the direct application of waste oils as fuels is inhibited by some of their undesirable properties like high acidity, low volatility, and high viscosity, which can result in coking and carbon deposition in the injector or engine corrosion (Kraiem et al., 2017). Consequently, many technologies have been studied and developed to tackle such problems and upgrade waste oils, including gasification, hydrotreating, transesterification, solvent extraction, and membrane technology (Enagi et al., 2018). Gasification of waste oils can produce useful gas products with high calorific value like H2, CO, CH4, and CnHm, which has huge potential as a substitute for natural gas in urban and industrial applications. Nevertheless, the high reaction temperature (1600 °C) and accompanying massive energy consumption impede the development of this technology (Chang et al., 2016). Hydrotreating utilizes hydrogen gas to reduce the impurities (N, S, and O) and increase the cetane number in biofuels, but its high operating cost due to the usage of large amount of hydrogen gas is the major bottleneck (Sani et al., 2017). Transesterification (alcoholysis) transforms ester compounds with the help of catalysts or enzymes into biodiesel with fatty acid methyl ester as the primary component (Mofijur et al., 2021). However, long processing times and the high cost of additives are the main challenges of this technology (Wang et al., 2021). Solvent extraction employs organic solvents to separate the unwanted components and facilitate the oxidative stability of waste oils, but the hazardousness of the solvent and low efficiency hinder its promotion (P. Li et al., 2019; F. Li et al., 2019). Membrane technology is an emerging technology that utilizes various kinds of polymer hollow fiber membranes to treat waste oils by filtration to remove metal particles and carbon soot. The process does not require a high temperature or pressure; thus, the treated waste oils have excellent liquidity and flashpoint. However, the membrane is expensive and nondurable and the frequent replacement of the membrane greatly increases the operating cost (Zhuang et al., 2018). Compared with the above techniques, pyrolysis, the thermal degradation of organic materials by breaking chemical bonds under anaerobic conditions, has been perceived as the most promising waste disposal technology and the best energy recovery method due to its feedstock flexibility, non-restrictive conditions, high conversion efficiency, limited environmental impact, and compatibility with available engines and fuel standards (Su et al., 2021). Furthermore, advanced pyrolysis technologies like co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis have been explored and comprehensively developed to enhance the properties of biofuels (Chen et al., 2021). Co-pyrolysis with different materials can modify the existing pyrolysis process and promote bio-oil properties effectively (Gouws et al., 2021). The accession of catalysts can further ameliorate pyrolysis selectivity and bio-oil properties by reducing activation energy, decreasing acidity, limiting product distribution, and cutting down oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds (Ong et al., 2019). The addition of the fitting catalyst can induce certain desirable reactions like aromatization, dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, and cracking, thereby enhancing the shape selectivity, directing the reaction pathway, and facilitating the production of the desired compounds (Ahmed et al., 2020). Given the tremendous advantages of waste oils and pyrolysis, the pyrolysis of waste oils will have a significant influence on the energy market and play an essential role in the near future. Wang et al. (2021) have provided a concise review of the pyrolysis of waste oils and introduced microwave pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis technology, catalysts, and reactor types. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive review of waste oils pyrolysis, especially advanced pyrolysis, is still lacking. As mentioned above, the rising amount of waste oils and the resulting environmental problems have become increasingly serious with the population explosion and growth in living standards. Therefore, a full understanding of the characteristics of waste oils and their conventional and advanced pyrolysis will provide a firm foundation for the scientific disposal and sustainable management of waste oils. Reducing the amount of waste oils and producing valuable products via pyrolysis are coincident with the principle of the circular economy, thereby playing a role in the realization of the harmonious development of human being and the environment. This review concentrates on peer-reviewed journal articles published from 2000 to 2021 with keywords relevant to waste oils pyrolysis. “Waste oil” and “pyrolysis” were used as field tags in ScienceDirect and Google Scholar searches, yielding 25,686 and 116,000 articles, respectively. 87 eligible papers were selected after a systematic screening process. Two filters were applied: (a) read the title and abstract and delete irrelevant articles; (b) evaluate the full text of the article based on relevance, significance, contribution, and influence. Based on those data, a systematic review has been conducted to provide a meticulous summary of all available previous research, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of pyrolysis and emphasizing the merits of pyrolysis in the disposal of waste oils. Consequently, this paper provides a critical and comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of waste oils by presenting the characterization of waste oils and their products, systematically introducing conventional and advanced pyrolysis of waste oils, and discussing the economic viability, prospects, and future challenges of waste oils pyrolysis."
1,Characterization of waste oils,"Cooking oil is the oil residue from cooking, primarily consists of triacylglycerols with tiny amounts of diacylglycerols, comes from households, restaurants, hotels, and caterers. The main raw materials are plant-based lipids or animal-based lipids, including soybean oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, coconut oil, butter, and fish oil (Bhatia et al., 2020). During the frying process, the oil is heated at a range of 160–200 °C and reacts with moisture and oxygen repetitively. It undergoes several degradation reactions like hydrolysis, oxidation, and polymerization and experiences many physiochemical changes. During the hydrolysis reaction, the moisture content in the food breaks the double bond in the oil to improve the degree of saturation and free fatty acid content (Yu et al., 2020b). These reactions generate a series of products like dimeric and polymeric acids, dimeric acylglycerols, and polyglycerols, which induce the increment of viscosity, density, total polar material, specific heat, and saturated fatty acid content and a decline in iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, antioxidants, smoke point, volatile components, and the content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated acids (Zahoor et al., 2021). Lubricant oil is extensively employed in industry and transportation to decrease oxidation, prevent rust and dust, and reduce wear and heat loss caused by the contact of surfaces in motion (Abomohra et al., 2020). The oil undergoes several chemical and physical changes due to the effect of oxidation and contamination, its composition varies with contaminants such as sulfur, oxides, and metals. Lubricant oil contains a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and is a promising feedstock for the production of high-value fuel or chemicals (Lam et al., 2012). Meanwhile, numerous mineral waste oils, gutter oil, and animal fat are produced by industry, agriculture, and daily life, unsustainable management of these waste oils is contributing severe damage to ecological security and human health (Al-Salem et al., 2017). To obtain high-quality products from the pyrolysis process, effective hydrogen index (EHI) is introduced to evaluate the relative hydrogen content of different specimens, as shown in Eq. (1) (Bertero et al., 2019). (1) EHI = (H−2O−2S−3N)/C The H, O, S, N, and C are the moles of hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon, respectively. Biomass with an EHI of less than 0.3 is extremely deficient in hydrogen. Co-feedstock with a high EHI can be introduced to gain a high-quality bio-oil, leading to hydrogen transfer and remarkable synthetic effects during the co-pyrolysis process. Table 1 displays the elemental and proximate analyses of waste oils and other materials. Waste oils have a high carbon and hydrogen content, low oxygen content, and high heating value (HHV). The nitrogen and sulfur content is very low, and even cannot be determined in some specimens. Therefore, waste oils have a high EHI, from 1.56 to 2.16, they are ideal hydrogen suppliers. Additionally, the volatile matter content is extremely high but the ash content is near to zero (Peng et al., 2015). Many materials with different properties have been chosen to be co-feedstocks with waste oils, such as waste polyethylene (PE), coal, tires, bamboo residual, and tea residual. Corn cob has the highest oxygen content of 51.79 wt%, sewage sludge has the maximum nitrogen content of 3.78 wt% and minimum HHV of 10.88 MJ/kg, while lignin possesses the highest sulfur content of 9.12 wt% and plastics have the highest EHI. As depicted in Fig. 2, six commonly used raw materials and two kinds of waste oils have been selected to show the difference in properties of waste oils over the other materials. Waste oils are prospective feedstocks for energy recovery because they have better utilization potential than most traditional bioresources. For example, waste motor oil possesses the maximum carbon content and second-highest hydrogen content. Whereas the oxygen content is lower than many materials, its nitrogen and sulfur content is almost zero. Consequently, waste oils have the maximum HHV among all the materials. Additionally, those two kinds of waste oils possess the highest volatile matter and lowest ash content, which means that more bio-oil can be generated from the pyrolysis of waste oils than the other six materials. Based on the above facts, waste oils are indeed the best raw materials to produce biofuels."
2,Conventional pyrolysis of waste oils,"Pyrolysis has been extensively explored and developed in the bioenergy field due to its remarkable potential in the co-production of energy and chemicals. It is deemed to be the most suitable method for the disposal of waste oils since it can efficiently convert waste oils into various valuable products within oxygen-limited conditions, which is the predominant characteristic that distinguishes pyrolysis from other treatment techniques or thermochemical conversion methods (Gouws et al., 2021). A feeding system, heating reactor, separation device, and downstream upgrading equipment are the main physical components of a pyrolysis system. Generally, inert gases (N2, CO2, He, and Ar) are extensively utilized throughout the pyrolysis zone and condenser to create the anaerobic environment or a vacuum pump is employed to establish a negative pressure environment (Wan Mahari et al., 2020)."
3,Optimal parameters and bio-oil properties of waste oils pyrolysis,"3.1 Optimal parameters and bio-oil properties of waste oils pyrolysis Waste oils are heated to a set temperature exceeding the thermal stability threshold under anaerobic conditions and experience several chemical reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, and dehydrogenation to form carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and other functional groups. During the pyrolysis process, some volatile hydrocarbons are recondensed into bio-oil, heavy components are transformed into char, while non-condensable gases are collected or just released into the air (Kumar et al., 2017). The pyrolysis process is prone to the effect of various parameters, such as temperature, heating rate, residence time, inert gas sweeping rate, and particle size, and tailoring the upper factors is conducive to the optimization of target products (Luo et al., 2014). Based on these conditions, pyrolysis is divided into slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis, product distribution and properties are enormously affected by different pyrolysis modes (Y. Zhang et al., 2020). Consequently, numerous studies have been devoted to achieving the optimal pyrolysis result through the adjustment of parameters. Table 2 summarizes the relevant results and observations from the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils. Most waste oils are pyrolyzed at temperatures between 400 and 800 °C, the fluctuation of the pyrolysis temperature significantly influences the bio-oil properties. Nevertheless, the optimal pyrolysis temperature to maximize the bio-oil yield is in the range of 500–600 °C in most cases. Wang et al. (2019) pyrolyzed waste clay oil and reported that the bio-oil yield presented an upward trend firstly with the increase in temperature, reaching a peak of 91.7 wt% at 550 °C. Kraiem et al. (2017) obtained 63.87 wt% bio-oil at 500 °C via the pyrolysis of waste frying oil. Adebanjo et al. (2005) gained a maximum bio-oil yield of 37.00 wt% at 600 °C. Some researchers have reported that a high temperature is beneficial in raising the biomass conversion rate, but hard to improve the bio-oil yield because harsh conditions promote the secondary cracking of condensable gases into non-condensable gases (Chiaramonti et al., 2017). Furthermore, the heating rate, carrier gas flow rate, feeding rate, and residence time have considerable impacts on the bio-oil properties (Pourkarimi et al., 2019). In a sense, those parameters are positively correlated as a low heating rate, carrier gas flow rate, and feeding rate all provide a relatively long retention time for pyrolysis, which promotes the secondary cracking of volatiles and enhances the formation of non-condensable gases (Hu and Gholizadeh, 2019). However, a high heating rate, carrier gas flow rate, and feeding rate, or a short pyrolysis time, may lead to a decline in pyrolysis degree or incomplete degradation, also impeding the generation of bio-oil (Lee et al., 2020). Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the reaction conditions to reach the optimal result. Trabelsi et al. (2018) found 15 °C/min was the optimum heating rate for the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil. Ling et al. (2016) detected that the highest bio-oil yield of 86.69 wt% was reached at a heating rate of 20 °C/min during the pyrolysis of cottonseed oil. Simultaneously, considerable quantities of light compounds were determined under a low heating rate (3–5 °C/min), illustrating that a slow heating rate or long residence time favor the generation of low molecular weight products. Additionally, Lam et al. (2012) found that a 0.25 L/min N2 flow rate and 5 kg/h feeding rate were optimal for obtaining the maximum bio-oil yield of 88 wt% via the pyrolysis of waste engine oil. Adebanjo et al. (2005) investigated flash pyrolysis of waste lard and concluded the ideal conditions were 600 °C, 1.2 s, and 1.7–2.4 mm particle size, based on the bio-oil yield. While the conditions of 600 °C, 1.8 s, and 0.7–1.4 mm were optimal to obtain a high-quality bio-oil, which was very close to gasoline. There is no doubt that bio-oil is the primary product obtained during the pyrolysis of waste oils. Because of its high volatile matter content and low ash content, around 80 wt% bio-oil can be obtained from non-catalytic sole pyrolysis of waste oils under optimal conditions. Table 3 displays the main chemical compositions of bio-oil produced from the non-catalytic pyrolysis of waste oils. Bio-oil consists of hydrocarbons, acids, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters. Hydrocarbons and acids are the primary components of bio-oil. Table 4 shows the physicochemical properties of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of waste oils. The bio-oil generated from the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils has a high HHV of between 30.39 and 46.60 MJ/kg, a viscosity in the range of 2.30–8.95 mm2/s, and density of around 860 kg/m3. All these parameters are very close to those of diesel or gasoline. Nevertheless, the acid value is about 120 KOH/g, which is extremely high and can cause problems like corrosiveness, instability, and reduce engine service life (Mofijur et al., 2013b). However, the addition of catalyst or co-feedstocks is a feasible method to solve this issue."
4,Byproducts of waste oils pyrolysis,"3.2 Byproducts of waste oils pyrolysis Table 5 displays the properties of byproducts from the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils. Many studies have proved that various conditions, including temperature, reactors, and inert gas type and flow rate, affect the yield and quality of byproducts. Trabelsi et al. (2018) found the composition of syngas varied with the pyrolysis temperature. CO, CO2, CH4, H2, and CnHm were the main constituents of syngas produced from the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil, the content of CO, CH4, and CnHm presented an upwards trend with the growth of temperature, leading to a high lower heating value (LHV) of 8.32 MJ/Nm3 at 700 °C. Wu et al. (2016) also used a novel pyrolysis technique of aerosol rotating gliding arc discharge-assisted pyrolysis (ARGA) and detected that pyrolysis conditions influenced biogas properties. Firstly, the biogas yield increased with the increment of temperature and reached a maximum value of 63.1 wt% at 800 °C. As for the biogas composition, CO content decreased from 36.5 to 19.2 wt%, whereas C2H4 increased gradually. Moreover, the growth of voltage played a vital role in the formation of biogas, the growth of applied voltage decreased C2H4 content, while raised CO and C2H2 content. Adebanjo et al. (2005) acquired high-quality biogas during the pyrolysis of animal fat, which was mainly composed of C1-C3 hydrocarbons, CO, CO2, and H2. The increase in temperature cut down the LHV, reduced the concentrations of C3+, but improved the content of H2. As summarized in Tables 2 and 5, biochar with low yield and quality was obtained during the non-catalytic pyrolysis of waste oils due to the low ash content. Trabelsi et al. (2014) gained only 1.10, 1.80, and 1.50 wt% biochar from the pyrolysis of lamb fat, poultry fat, and swine fat, respectively. The quality of biochar from the pyrolysis of waste oils was also poor. Moreover, Trabelsi et al. (2018) reported that the biochar yield declined with the rising of pyrolysis temperature, reaching the minimum at 800 °C, the high temperature induced the secondary decomposition of biochar. This conclusion was supported by Wang et al. (2019) that high temperature decreased the biochar yield to 3.67 wt% during the pyrolysis of waste clay oil. In addition, Lam et al. (2012) only obtained 7 wt% biochar during the pyrolysis of waste automotive engine oil. Simultaneously, the increment of N2 purge rates inhibited the generation of biochar because it created high pressure in the reactor, resulting in a rapid flow rate of pyrolysis volatiles. Table 6 displays the elemental analysis of biochar obtained during the pyrolysis of waste oils. The biochar generated from the conventional pyrolysis of waste oils is of poor quality, since the carbon and hydrogen content is as low as 12.90 and 0.30 wt%, respectively, but oxygen content is as high as 58.20 wt%, leading to an extremely low HHV."
5,Mechanism of waste oils pyrolysis,"3.3 Mechanism of waste oils pyrolysis The pyrolysis mechanism for waste oils has been systematically explored by many researchers. One typical reaction pathway of the pyrolysis of unsaturated triglycerides is shown in Fig. 3. Unsaturated fatty acid radicals are first separated from triglyceride molecules, then cleaved along their carbon chains to form carboxyl groups, leading to smaller fatty acid radicals, paraffin, and olefins. Chain hydrocarbons are formed by the absorption of hydrogen atoms by fatty acid radicals. CO2 molecules are removed to form alkanes. Another suggested mechanism is that butadiene molecules are formed at the bond cleavage around the unsaturated carbon chain. Butadiene is then transformed into aromatics by the Diels-Alder reaction with ethylene (Srivastava and Prasad, 2000). Another recommended reaction scheme for the pyrolysis of saturated triglycerides is presented in Fig. 4. The process consists mainly of 16 reaction steps. Firstly, triglycerides are converted into ketenes, acrolein, and fatty acids. Then, after decarboxylation and ketonization, fatty acids are transformed into hydrocarbons, ketones, CO2, and H2O. Ketenes, ketones, and acrolein further crack into hydrocarbons, alkanes, and olefin. Eventually, olefins, diolefins, paraffin, aromatics, acetylenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and coke are generated after a series of reactions (Kubátová et al., 2011; Seifi and Sadrameli, 2016)."
6,Advanced pyrolysis of waste oils,"Co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis are the most widely applied advanced pyrolysis techniques because both of them can positively influence the pyrolysis process and end products with no or little modification of existing equipment (Abnisa and Wan Daud, 2014). However, other technologies like hydro-pyrolysis, solar pyrolysis, or ARGA need additives or equipment updates, which substantially increase the cost (Sun et al., 2020). The use of advanced pyrolysis techniques promotes the formation of target products, raises conversion efficiency, and reduces the pyrolysis process cost."
7,Co-pyrolysis of waste oils,"4.1 Co-pyrolysis of waste oils Co-pyrolysis has two distinguishing features: effectiveness and simplicity. It is analogous to traditional pyrolysis, which is conducted in a closed reactor system with a moderate operating temperature and oxygen-deficient environment, but involves two or more different materials as feedstocks (Zhao et al., 2020). While the conversion from pyrolysis to co-pyrolysis is feasible and straightforward without modification of existing equipment, it has a huge effect on the pyrolysis process and final products (Wu et al., 2017). As mentioned above, the pyrolysis process is prone to the effect of various parameters like temperature, heating rate, atmosphere, residence time, and particle size. Co-pyrolysis has an additional and important interfering factor, the blending ratio of raw materials (Zhao et al., 2015). The nature of the biomass is the primary factor influencing the pyrolysis process and product distribution and properties. Generally, co-feedstocks with a high volatile matter content are conducive to the generation of bio-oil, whereas co-feedstocks with a high ash content hinder the process, but enhance the formation of biochar and biogas (Dhyani and Bhaskar, 2018). Furthermore, biomass with a high EHI is favorable for improving product quality, which is the reason waste oils are extensively utilized in co-pyrolysis as co-feedstocks with other materials. Table 7 lists the relevant results and observations of co-pyrolysis of waste oils with other materials, including corn cob, plastics, tires, coal, and sewage sludge, which covers a wide range of biomass categories. The addition of other materials has a tremendous impact on the pyrolysis process, product distribution and properties. 4.1.1 Application of lignocellulose biomass in waste oils co-pyrolysis Lignocellulose biomass is the cheapest and most abundant carbon source and has been widely applied in the production of biofuel. The bio-oil generated from the pyrolysis of lignocellulose biomass has undesirable properties like high acidity, low caloric value, instability, and corrosiveness due to its high oxygen content. However, the inclusion of waste oils with a high EHI can effectively alleviate this situation (Ong et al., 2020). Chen et al. (2014) conducted an experiment on co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil with corn cob, where the addition of waste cooking oil changed the main composition of the bio-oil from phenols, furans, and ketones to carboxyl acids, alkanes, and alkenes, reduced the acid value from 58 to 25 mg KOH/g, and increased the bio-oil HHV to 32.78 MJ/kg. Additionally, an increase in the waste cooking oil ratio decreased the biogas yield but improved the biogas quality by raising the CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 content, leading to a high LHV of 20.54 MJ/Nm3 at 600 °C. Moreover, co-pyrolysis of lignin with waste cooking oil was performed. An increase in the ratio of waste cooking oil in the sample influenced the bio-oil composition immensely. The aromatics content firstly increased and reached the maximum with 50% lignin in the mixture, and then declined, while oxygenated compounds showed the opposite trend, with aliphatic content increasing and phenolics content decreasing continuously (Fan et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2017c) pyrolyzed waste cooking oil and tea residual in the presence of HZSM-5. The increment of waste cooking oil provided sufficient hydrogen to tea residual and enhanced the thermal chemical conversion, thus leading to a continuous rise of aromatics content in the bio-oil. Moreover, the oxygenated compounds obtained from the pyrolysis of residual tea promoted the chain breaking and long-chain organic compounds cracking in the waste cooking oil, further improving the bio-oil quality. Another lignocellulosic solid marine waste Posidonia oceanica was utilized as a co-feedstock in the pyrolysis of waste frying oil. Co-pyrolysis altered the relationship between product distribution and temperature, with the highest bio-oil yield (35 wt%) obtained at 450 °C, while that of sole pyrolysis of marine waste (40.75 wt%) was attained at 550 °C (Abnisa and Wan Daud, 2015). Meanwhile, co-pyrolysis lowered the biochar quality and raised the content of CH4 and H2, resulting in a high LHV of 18.69 MJ/kg at 500 °C. It was due to the fatty matter in waste frying oil promoted the liquefaction of Posidonia oceanica solid fraction and volatilization of bio-oil and biogas, respectively (Zaafouri et al., 2016). 4.1.2 Application of plastic waste in waste oils co-pyrolysis Plastics play an essential role in daily life due to their low cost, lightweight, and wide application. Generally, plastics possess a high content of carbon and hydrogen and an extremely low content of ash, they can produce clean distillates and are the optimum feedstocks for pyrolysis (Suriapparao et al., 2020). The synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of waste oils with plastic waste can shorten the reaction time, raise bio-oil yield, and reduce oxygenated compounds. Wan Mahari et al. (2018a) pyrolyzed used frying oil and plastic waste in a microwave oven and detected strong synergistic effects. Firstly, synergistic effects positively influenced the heating rate, reduced the reaction time, and saved energy utilization. The highest bio-oil yield (81 wt%) was achieved using 50% plastic waste at 550 °C, which was the best balance to generate condensable steam, but it did not facilitate secondary or tertiary cracking (Dewangan et al., 2016). Additionally, synergistic effects broke down heavier carbon components to lighter carbon components (C20–C24 hydrocarbons), the bio-oil was mainly composed of aliphatic hydrocarbons with a small number of single-ring aromatics, aldehydes, and ketones. Meanwhile, the lowest oxygen content was obtained with 50% plastic waste, which indicated that the synergistic effects favored the deoxidation process (Y. Wang et al., 2017). The same research team performed another experiment on the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil with waste polyolefins (PO) under an N2 atmosphere or vacuum environment. Similarly, different proportions of each material had a significant effect on the product distribution, with the highest bio-oil yield gained with 33.33% plastic waste. More bio-oil was generated in vacuum environment, as negative air pressure cut down the boiling points of compounds produced from the decomposition of feedstocks, which promoted the vaporization and converted these compounds into volatiles, volatiles then flowed out of the reactor to be condensed into bio-oil (Ma et al., 2017). The bio-oil generated in vacuum environment exhibited a better quality and contained aliphatic hydrocarbons including alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons with a short carbon chain, but no oxygenated compounds. Triglycerides in waste cooking oil were converted into alkanes, alkenes, or cycloalkanes, probably by deoxygenation reactions. Therefore, bio-oil with a high HHV of 49.03 MJ/kg and remarkable quality was formed in vacuum environment and was qualified to be used as a conventional fuel (Wan Mahari et al., 2018b). Uçar et al. (2016) conducted an experiment on the pyrolysis of waste motor oil with PE and PP and reported that synergistic effects positively influenced the bio-oil yield. The highest liquid yield of 97 wt% was reached at the PP/waste motor oil ratio of 1:1, which was far more than the corresponding calculated values. However, only PE/waste motor oil (1:1) presented a decent bio-oil quality, other combinations did not improve the bio-oil quality efficaciously. Moreover, synergistic effects had an insignificant impact on the biogas yield but influenced the biogas quality positively and led to a growth of biogas LHV. 4.1.3 Application of other biomass in waste oils co-pyrolysis Except for lignocellulosic biomass and plastic waste, other materials like tires, sewage sludge, and coal have been employed in the co-pyrolysis of waste oils and achieved some positive results. The number of waste tires is increasing with the rapid development of transportation. Tires consist of rubber, carbon black, metal, textile, zinc oxide, sulfur, and other additives, and are optimal raw materials for pyrolysis due to their high carbon and hydrogen content (Lewandowski et al., 2019). Usually, sewage sludge contains oils, water, feces, plant residues, microbes, and inorganic constituents, and is characterized by high moisture, heavy metal, and organic pollutant content. However, the addition of other materials during pyrolysis can reduce the impact of heavy metals on the environment (Deviatkin et al., 2019). As another essential and widely available biomass with high reactivity and low price, coal is mainly composed of minerals and organics (Xia et al., 2020). While low-rank coals have other toxic elements like nitrogen and sulfur, toxic gases can be released via direct combustion. However, co-pyrolysis is an efficient technique to upgrade low-rank coals and reduce pollution (Wu et al., 2019). The addition of waste lubricant oil into tires strongly influences product distribution and composition. Firstly, according to Uçar et al. (2005), bio-oil yield saw a remarkable growth with the addition of waste lubricant oil, which increased from 47.4 to 67.4 wt% and 55.6–72.2 wt% for the pyrolysis of passenger car tires (PCT) and truck tires (TT), respectively, whereas biochar experienced an obvious decline. Meanwhile, synergistic effects greatly decreased the aromatics content but substantially increased the paraffin content and bio-oil HHV. Nevertheless, the combination of waste cooking oil and sewage sludge induced negative synergistic effects on bio-oil and biogas yield. Even though the bio-oil yield increased by 41.2 wt% with the addition of waste cooking oil, it was still less than the corresponding calculated value. The H2 and CH4 content benefited from synergistic effects and increased largely, leading to a high LHV of 27 MJ/Nm3 at 700 °C (L. Wu et al., 2020). Mineral waste oils and low-rank coal were pyrolyzed in a fluidized-bed reactor by Lázaro et al. (2002). Due to the high ash content, the inclusion of coal enhanced the char yield while reducing the bio-oil yield. However, synergistic effects positively affected the bio-oil composition and improved the bio-oil quality with the production of light olefins, benzene, toluene, and xylene. Meanwhile, the synergistic effects exerted a significant impact on the distribution of metals in the products by decreasing all metal concentrations in the bio-oil and increasing all metal concentrations in the biochar, except Cr. Based on Table 5, six common materials have been chosen to compare the synergistic effects of non-catalytic co-pyrolysis with waste oils on the bio-oil yield and HHV. As displayed in Fig. 5, most of the materials have a minimal positive impact on the improvement of bio-oil yield and HHV owing to the high volatile matter and EHI of waste oils. Specifically, for typical lignocellulose biomass, the bio-oil yield and HHV were reduced by 11.4 wt% and 6.71 MJ/kg, respectively. Owing to their low volatile matter, the use of waste tires as co-feedstock during co-pyrolysis did not achieve a satisfactory result and saw a reduction in the bio-oil yield of 14.70 and 19.10 wt%. Additionally, the improvement in the bio-oil HHV was also unremarkable. However, co-pyrolysis with waste plastic materials like PO, PE, and PP influenced the bio-oil HHV positively because of their quite high EHI (2.07–2.12), the addition of PO raised the bio-oil HHV by 9.54 MJ/kg. Furthermore, the use of PE also had a promoting effect on the bio-oil yield owing to its exceptionally high volatile matter content. Hence, waste plastics are optimal raw materials for use with waste oils to generate positive synergistic effects on bio-oil yield and HHV without using catalysts."
8,Catalytic pyrolysis of waste oils,"4.2 Catalytic pyrolysis of waste oils Bio-oil originated from waste oils usually has a high acid value, which severely hinders the development and application of waste oils as raw materials for pyrolysis. However, the accession of catalysts is a practical approach to address this issue and brings other strengths, such as optimizing product distribution, enhancing product quality, and improving compatibility with engines (Ooi et al., 2019). Moreover, the usage of catalysts during pyrolysis can also reduce energy consumption and remove impurities like O, S, N, and P in the bio-oil (F. Li et al., 2019). The zeolite-type, metal-type, carbon-type, or mixture of various types of catalyst have been extensively applied in the pyrolysis of waste oils to ameliorate the pyrolysis process and final product properties (Rahman et al., 2018). Additionally, the catalytic mode plays a significant role during the biomass conversion process, which includes in-situ and ex-situ methods. For the in-situ method, feedstocks are mixed with catalysts before pyrolysis, while for the ex-situ process, the pyrolyzed vapors pass through the catalyst at a fixed temperature (Yu et al., 2019). Table 8 tabulates the physicochemical properties of catalysts. BET surface area refers to the total surface area of materials per unit of mass, which indicates the adsorption capacity of the material. Usually, materials with high BET surface area possess high adsorption capacity. Catalysts including AC, MCM-41, SBA-15@MgO@Zn, and HZSM-5 have remarkable BET surface area, which suggests that they can offer more reaction sites to support the cracking of waste oils and increase the conversion rate of waste oils. The pore size distribution of catalysts describes their porosity, denoting the space that supplies channels in the material to absorb molecules of an equal or smaller size. Based on the classification of pore size from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the diameter of macropores is greater than 50 nm, the diameter of mesopores is between 2 and 50 nm, while the diameter of micropores is less than 2 nm. The absorption of small molecules usually occurs in micropores, while macropores and mesopores provide channels for the absorbent to reach the micropores. Moreover, macropores and mesopores can be used as transport arteries, so that the inner part of the catalyst is easily contacted by absorbed molecules (Lam et al., 2017). The pore size of AC, HZSM-5, and PC is in the micropore range, while SBA-15@MgO@Zn, MCM-41, ZSM-5/MCM-41, AC, and HZSM-5 possess high pore volume, which can provide many absorption sites to assist the cracking of waste oils. Table 9 summarizes the catalytic effects on the pyrolysis of waste oils, many studies have proved that the presence of catalysts positively influences the pyrolysis process and product properties. 4.2.1 Zeolite-based catalytic pyrolysis Currently, over 230 zeotype frameworks and unique zeolites are available with particular characteristics and porous structures (Lee et al., 2020). As highly tailorable silica-based materials, zeolites can be modified into different catalyst forms with aluminosilicate as a framework, such as ZSM-5, SBA-15 zeolite, MCM-41 zeolite, Y zeolite, and β-zeolite (Chang et al., 2015). Zeolites have the advantages of strong electric fields, adequate capacity of adsorption, and high hydrothermal stability, and are capable of separating reactants from products and regulating electronic characteristics of active sites (Liu et al., 2020). It is reported the addition of zeolite in pyrolysis has a massive impact on the distribution of functional groups in the bio-oil due to the existence of pore sizes, channel structure, and acidity (Mihalcik et al., 2011). Because many functional groups like alcohol, acid, aldehyde, ketone, and furan can easily diffuse into channels and participate in a series of reactions including dehydration, decarbonylating, decarboxylation, and aromatization to produce oxygen, aromatic hydrocarbons, and coke (Li et al., 2017). Currently, many zeolites like Zeolith 5 A, HZSM-5, MCM-41, and SBA-15 have been utilized in the pyrolysis of waste oils and yielded fruitful results. Based on Table 9, HZSM-5 is the most extensively utilized zeolite because of its outstanding deoxygenation and aromatization capacity. Omar and Robinson (2014) conducted the pyrolysis of virgin rapeseed oil and waste rapeseed oil in the presence of HZSM-5. HZSM-5 raised the light bio-oil yield from 11.20 to 15.30 wt% and the light bio-oil was mainly composed of alkene, alkanes, aliphatic alkenes, and acids. The authors elucidated the phenomenon that the accession of HZSM-5 was favorable for breaking medium-chain fatty acids and converting them into alkane and alkene hydrocarbons. Wang et al. (2020a) also proved that HZSM-5 could increase the aromatic hydrocarbons content via the pyrolysis of vegetable oil soap stock, which increased the content of aromatic hydrocarbons from 6.68 to 73.36 wt% while reducing the content of oxygenated compounds from 35.53 to 19.93 wt% and decreasing the content of alkenes from 38.17 to 1.19 wt%. This was because the primary soap stock volatiles diffused into the three-dimensional pore of HZSM-5 to generate the precursor of a hydrocarbon pool with the active sites, aromatic hydrocarbons were generated via dehydration, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and polymerization reactions. Meanwhile, oxygen was removed via the formation of CO2, CO, and H2O during the pyrolysis. HZSM-5 enhanced the Diels-Alder reaction to promote the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) through several transformations. It is undoubtedly the catalyst dosage that has a tremendous effect on the final products. Fan et al. (2020) explored the effect of HZSM-5 dosage on the composition of bio-oil during the co-pyrolysis of 1:1 mass ratio of lignin to waste cooking oil. Mono-aromatics and poly-aromatics increased with the rising of the HZSM-5 dosage, reaching the maximum at the mass ratio of 3:1 (catalyst to feedstocks) and then showing a descending tendency, aliphatics went up first and then declined. HZSM-5 with strong acidic sites facilitated the cracking of the feedstock, which enhanced the decomposition of aliphatics to light olefins and further converted them into aromatics via the Diels-Alder reaction. However, a further growth in the HZSM-5 dosage cracked those pyrolysis products into gases. Additionally, phenolics and other oxygenated compounds declined continuously, the strong deoxygenation ability of HZSM-5 promoted the formation of a hydrocarbon pool and then converted those oxygenated compounds into aromatics. Furthermore, HZSM-5 can improve the reaction activity by accelerating the reaction rate and reducing the activation energy. Zheng et al. (2018) pyrolyzed waste rubber seed oil and Yunnan pine in the presence of HZSM-5 and reported that the conversion ratio increased to 95.88%, the activation energy of co-pyrolysis decreased from 62.44 to 50.80 KJ/mol after adding HZSM-5. The combination of HZSM-5 with metal oxides is also a research emphasis. Synergistic effects generated from HZSM-5 and metal oxides can influence the yield and composition of bio-oil remarkably (Zhang and Grant, 2013). Q. Wu et al. (2020) explored the feasibility of integrating HZSM-5 with six metal oxides (CoO, NiO, ZrO2, SrO, CeO2, and CaO) in the co-catalytic pyrolysis of waste oils to impede the generation of undesired and toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and promote the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, benzenes, toluene, ethylbenzenes, and xylenes (BTEXs) in the bio-oil using three kinds of catalytic modes (ex-situ mixed (ESM), ex-situ separate (ESS), and in-situ separate (ISS)). Sole use of HZSM-5 had the hindering effect on the bio-oil yield, while the combination HZSM-5/CaO further decreased the yield to 18.50 wt% due to its strong cracking ability. As for the chemical composition of the bio-oils, the addition of HZSM-5 significantly increased the hydrocarbons and reduced the acids. However, the presence of metal oxides did not promote this tendency, except for CaO which increased the content of hydrocarbons from 87.58 to 91.36 wt%. Moreover, HZSM-5 enhanced the MAHs yield to 64.5 wt%, but unfortunately also promoted the PAHs yield to 8.5 wt%. Nevertheless, the accession of metal oxides did not alter the trend, rather worsened it, especially for CaO, which decreased the MAHs content to 52.5 wt% but raised the PAHs content to 34.8 wt%. Furthermore, catalytic modes also played a significant role in pyrolysis. The highest bio-oil yield was reached in the ISS mode in the presence of CaO and HZSM-5. Moreover, the highest hydrocarbon content and lowest acid content were obtained in the ESS mode in the presence of CaO and HZSM-5, with the ESS mode facilitating the formation of MAHs. In contrast, ISS mode presented an inhibitory effect on the generation of PAHs. Subsequently, research on the effect of the ratio of HZSM-5 to CaO on pyrolysis was conducted, and 2:1 was the optimum ratio based on the concentration of hydrocarbons and BTEXs in the bio-oil. Additionally, the catalytic effect of using dual catalysts HZSM-5 and MgO in the co-pyrolysis of waste lubricating oil and bamboo residual was explored by Wang et al. (2017a). Firstly, the application of each catalyst reduced the acid yield, MgO showed a better deacidification effect. Simultaneously, ketones experienced a prominent increase in the presence of MgO owing to its strong basicity, which transformed the acids into ketones via ketonization reactions as shown in Eq. (2). The most intensive ketonization reaction was achieved with the dual catalysts. This indicated that the application of dual catalytic stages to integrate alkalinity and acid sites could achieve better catalytic performance during the pyrolysis process. HZSM-5 induced a notable increment of aromatics, while the highest aromatics yield was achieved with 50% MgO. This was ascribed to volatile matter were firstly ketalized and deoxidized via the MgO catalyst bed to form intermediate precursors, such as ketones and furans. Subsequently, aromatic compounds were formed on the second HZSM-5 bed due to the existence of acid sites. (2) Image 1 A technique using modified HZSM-5 via chemical liquid deposition during the pyrolysis of waste oils to improve the aromatics selectivity and prevent coke formation has also been investigated. Wang et al. (2017b) pyrolyzed waste cooking oil with the aid of modified HZSM-5. An appropriate mesoporous structure was formed and a hierarchical micro-mesoporous system was achieved in the HZSM-5 after the alkali and hydrothermal process. The aromatics content rose to 58.56 wt% with the presence of HZSM-5 after 4 h alkali treatment, the modified HZSM-5 in a combination process showed better catalytic performance demonstrated by high yields of desired products. The HZSM-5@SiC ceramic foam was added in the pyrolysis of vegetable oil soap stock and displayed good performance in the prevention of catalyst deactivation and the growth of aromatic hydrocarbons selectivity. After adding the catalyst, the aromatic hydrocarbon content increased from 25.18 to 100 wt%, while coke formation was significantly inhibited (Wang et al., 2020b). Furthermore, other zeolite-based catalysts, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, have been employed in the pyrolysis of waste oils. Wang et al. (2019) and Lam et al. (2017) used MCM-41 as a catalyst to conduct the pyrolysis of waste clay oil and used frying oil, respectively. The addition of MCM-41 during the pyrolysis of waste clay oil did not show a good performance, reducing the bio-oil yield from 91.58 to 89.22 wt% (in-situ), raising the hydrocarbon content from 18.21 to 21.77 wt%, and decreasing the acid content from 62.67 to 60.69 wt%. As for the used frying oil, the usage of MCM-41 also showed an unsatisfactory result, failing to improve hydrocarbon content and reduce acid content. Synthesized catalyst based on SBA-15 was applied in the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and obtained an excellent result. The presence of catalysts, SBA-15@MgO@Zn in particular, improved the bio-oil yield and conversion rate and hindered coke generation efficaciously. SBA-15@MgO@Zn increased the bio-oil HHV from 30.39 to 45.23 MJ/kg and decreased the acid value from 129 to 38.68 mg KOH/g (Yu et al., 2020a). 4.2.2 Metal-based catalytic pyrolysis Generally, bio-oil generated from waste oils has a high acid value, which has a huge negative impact on cold flow properties and the corrosion value, restricting the direct application of bio-oil in diesel engines. Based on the ASTM D664 standard, the maximum allowable acid value is 0.8 mg KOH/g (Qu et al., 2020). The presence of metal-based catalysts can significantly reduce the acid value, upgrade the bio-oil, and improve the compatibility with engines (Xu et al., 2010). Metal oxides consist of positive metal ions and negative oxygen ions, possessing Lewis acid and Brønsted base. Therefore, metal oxides have acid-base or redox properties (Guan et al., 2020). Many typical metal oxides, including CaO, NaOH, MgO, ZnO, and SiO2, have been utilized to enhance bio-oil properties during the pyrolysis of waste oils (Bhoi et al., 2020). These metal oxides have been divided into basic metal oxides (CaO, NaOH, and MgO) and acidic metal oxides (SiO2). In general, the basic metal oxides are desirable for aldol condensation and ketonization of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acid, while the acidic metal oxides demonstrate better catalytic activity during the process of deoxygenation (Chan and Tanksale, 2014). Basic metal oxides show remarkable performance in the deacidification of bio-oil. Mrad et al. (2013) employed nine kinds of catalysts for the pyrolysis of industrial fish oil residue to decrease the acid value and optimize the yield. The hybrid catalyst of MgSO4 and Na2CO3 was the most efficient in reducing the acids, decreasing the acid value from 22.00 to 8.75 mg KOH/g. In contrast, the sole presence of Na2CO3 increased the bio-oil yield to 69.25 wt%. The phenomenon of acid reduction due to the addition of metal oxides was also witnessed by Chang et al. (2017), who conducted fast pyrolysis of waste cooking oil with the help of catalyst pellets with a binder (bentonite) loaded with 25 wt% active materials such as CaO, NaOH, Al2(SO4)3, and Na2CO3. NaOH reduced the acid value from 115.73 to 0 mg KOH/g due to its strong alkalinity, while CaO was the optimal catalyst because it could convert the fatty acids to ketones and aldehydes and enhance the saturated fatty acid content of the bio-oil. As displayed in Fig. 6, catalyst type and catalytic mode largely influence the chemical composition of the bio-oil. Firstly, the bio-oil originated from the non-catalytic pyrolysis of waste clay oil is of poor quality, which has high acid content and low hydrocarbon content. However, the presence of MCM-41 did not achieve a more remarkable result in either catalytic mode. However, CaO exhibited excellent performance on bio-oil modification, decreasing the acid content to 3.48 wt% and 3.72 wt% and raising the hydrocarbon content to 68.85 wt% and 87.64 wt% in the two modes, respectively. Furthermore, CaO had an inhibitory effect on the formation of alcohols. Thus, CaO can significantly enhance the production of hydrocarbons and hinder the formation of acids and alcohols (Wang et al., 2019). Fig. 7 presents the possible mechanism underlying the formation of hydrocarbons and the reduction of acids during the pyrolysis of waste clay oil using two different types of catalysts. Glyceride is firstly decomposed into acrolein and fatty aldehyde. Then, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and dehydration reactions are enhanced by MCM-41, reducing acids and carbonyl compounds and generating more hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. Owing to its strong alkalinity, CaO shows better performance on the reduction of acids and improvement of hydrocarbons and leads to a high bio-oil HHV, which converts those acids into hydrocarbons CO, CO2, and CH4. 4.2.3 Carbon-based catalytic pyrolysis Carbon-based catalysts play a vital role in the pyrolysis of waste oils and are available in the form of activated carbon (AC) or biochar (Norouzi et al., 2016). High carbonaceous content and special surface area make carbon-based catalysts show good catalytic performance, while metals and minerals also promote catalytic activity (Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, carbon-based catalysts are extensively applied in microwave-assisted pyrolysis as absorbents with remarkable microwave absorptivity (Lewandowski et al., 2019). Many typical carbon-based catalysts, including metallic-char, AC, and particulate carbon (PC), have been used in the pyrolysis of waste oils and achieved fruitful results. Lam et al. (2015) performed pyrolysis of waste engine oil with metallic-char and observed that the growth of metallic-char reduced the bio-oil and biochar yield but significantly enhanced the biogas yield. As for the composition of the bio-oil, the catalyst increased aromatics content and decreased aliphatic content. Meanwhile, it increased H2, CO, C2H4, and C3H6 content and led to a higher biogas LHV. This was because the metallic char absorbed the microwave energy quickly, resulting in a high temperature offering more reaction sites that promoted the cracking and heterogeneous reactions, thereby transforming waste engine oil into lighter hydrocarbons and non-condensable gases. Moreover, the research team utilized AC as the reaction bed and microwave absorber to recover the desired products from waste palm oil. The addition of AC promoted the cracking of the waste palm oil and reduced the reaction time to 25 min. Additionally, the usage of catalyst impeded the generation of undesirable oxygenated and sulfur compounds, carboxylic acid, and triglycerides. It also enhanced the production of light C10–C15 hydrocarbon content in the bio-oil, resulting in a high HHV of 46 MJ/kg, which was very close to that of diesel fuel (Lam et al., 2016). Moreover, they employed PC to pyrolyze the waste palm oil, PC caused a slightly higher heating rate as a reaction bed than AC, PC and AC presented a similar product distribution. As for the chemical composition, PC displayed a slightly lower aliphatic hydrocarbon content than AC, PC had a weak performance on deacidification and deoxidation, leading to relatively high oxygen content and low HHV (Lam et al., 2017). Fig. 8 shows the catalytic effects of eleven kinds of catalysts on the pyrolysis of waste cooking oil, concentrating on three main indicators: deacidification ability and the improvement of bio-oil yield and HHV. Basically, the accession of catalysts had a positive impact on increasing the bio-oil HHV and reducing the acid value of bio-oil but had an adverse effect on enhancing the bio-oil yield. Na2CO3 and alkali metal oxides such as CaO and NaOH showed the best deacidification performance, NaOH even reduced the acid value to zero due to its excellent redox properties and strong alkalinity. Additionally, a series of derivatives based on SBA-15 exhibited the best performance, especially SBA-15@MgO@Zn, which raised the yield and HHV of bio-oil by 16 wt% and 14.84 MJ/kg, respectively, and decreased the acid value by 90.32 mg KOH/g. This was attributed to SBA-15@MgO@Zn possessed medium-strength basicity and acidity, which could solve the single acid or base problem. The higher acid amount enhanced the cracking of waste cooking oil, but could simultaneously boost the formation of coke (Xu et al., 2016). In contrast, the higher base amount can accelerate the decarbonylation reaction and inhibit the production of coke. This acid and alkali coexisting bifunctional catalyst provides a solution to the problems of coke formation and high acid value in the bio-oil. Meanwhile, the catalyst effectively reduces oxygenated compounds due to its favorable deoxidation effect, which simplifies the pyrolysis process and improves the bio-oil quality. As bio-oil possesses the highest economic value, its production on an industrial scale is the key to realizing the commercialization of related industries. Thus, the coexisting bifunctional catalyst will play a crucial role in the pyrolysis of waste oils and needs to be further studied and developed in the future."
9,Economic viability of waste oils pyrolysis,"The wide application of the pyrolysis of waste oils can be mainly decided by the cost competitiveness of its fuel and chemical products compared with traditional fossil fuels and chemicals. The promising economic and social values of waste oils pyrolysis are the key to stimulate the development and application of related industries (Tao et al., 2017). At first, the pyrolysis process has significant economic advantages in comparison with other conversion methods. Based on three conversion platforms, including pyrolysis, gasification, and biochemical conversion, the capital and operational costs of six near-term biomass to biofuels technologies scenarios were analyzed and compared by Anex et al. (2010). Corn stover was chosen to be the feedstock and plant capacity was set as 2000 tons/day. The total capital investment in gasification was the highest but that in pyrolysis was the least. It was estimated that production cost were in the range of $2.00–5.50 per gallon, while the hydrogen purchase pyrolysis scenario was the lowest owing to the low capital and operational cost of pyrolysis and high product revenue. Additionally, some studies have proved that co-pyrolysis is economically superior because it can positively affect the pyrolysis process and final products without virtually additional cost. Meyer et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the conversion of eleven biomass feedstocks to produce biofuels through fast pyrolysis, including an upgrading process via hydrodeoxygenation. Firstly, woody biomass like pine, tulip poplar, and hybrid poplar generated more biofuels than herbaceous biomass but faced the problem of high feedstock costs. However, blending woody biomass with herbaceous biomass was an effective method to resolve this issue, guaranteeing the output and reducing production costs. Among those eleven feedstocks, a mixture of pine and oriented strand board was the most economically attractive due to its lowest minimum fuel selling price. The conclusion that co-pyrolysis exhibits more advantages than pyrolysis alone was also supported by Kuppens et al. (2010). They performed an assessment of the profitability of co-pyrolysis of willow with biopolymers and figured out the net present value of cash flow increased by 0.405 MEUR owing to the growth of valuable crotonic acid. Waste oils have certain economic advantages because of local availability and low price. Wang (2019) selected seven kinds of oils and five kinds of fats to evaluate their economic potential to produce sustainable and renewable jet fuel. Yellow grease derived from waste cooking oil showed the lowest minimum aviation fuel selling price of $0.91/L due to the low feedstock price ($0.23/kg). The authors provided a suggestion that greases from waste cooking oil were the best option to produce biofuels because of local availability, which directly decided the price of raw materials and transportation costs. Therefore, in this scenario, each nation or region should choose the optimal raw materials according to their local situation (Wang and Tao, 2016). Compared with inert gas mode, the usage of vacuum pump exhibits better economic superiority. This technique is valuable because more validates are formed and condensed into bio-oil under negative pressure and the cost is reduced due to the absence of inert gases (Li et al., 2018). Lam et al. (2019) explored and compared the technical and economic feasibility of microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis and conventional co-pyrolysis using waste plastic and used cooking oil as the feedstocks. Capital and operating costs, including consumables, utility costs, labor costs, and maintenance costs, were considered. Microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis with the aid of AC generated an 84 wt% yield of bio-oil with a high HHV of 49 MJ/kg and contained a high content of light hydrocarbons and a lower content of oxygenated compounds. The cost of bio-oil from microwave pyrolysis in N2 environment was USD 2.54/L, while that under vacuum mode was USD 2.02/L. Moreover, the economic value of byproducts cannot be ignored, as they have wide application for industrial production (Uddin et al., 2018). Large-scale production can achieve economies of scale. van Schalkwyk et al. (2020) analyzed bio-oil production from forest residues using pyrolysis and the minimum selling price of the crude bio-oil produced was $1.09/L, dropping to $0.71/L in the scale production mode. Lam et al. (2019) found the cost of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of waste plastic and used cooking oil rapidly decreased from USD 2.02/L to USD 0.25/L in the scaled-up mode due to the sharp increase in the production of bio-oil, the cost was much lower than the price of diesel fuel in Malaysia. Hence, microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and used cooking oil has excellent potential to be scaled up for industrial application. However, the key to reaching an economy of scale is to improve the scalability and duplication of the facility, which involves the optimization and standardization of equipment and technological processes. A comprehensive design framework is needed to incorporate many proposals for pyrolysis synergy into the synthesis and analysis of the whole process. It is necessary to develop an energy-saving waste oils pyrolysis process, treat waste oils at a low cost, generate as many valuable products as possible, recover valuable resources, and reduce the impact on the environment (Rezvani et al., 2016)."
10,Prospects and challenges of waste oils pyrolysis,"There are still many challenges to the promotion, application, and commercialization of waste oils pyrolysis. An insufficient supply of waste oils is one of them. The primary collection of waste oils is from households, factories, and small restaurants, the lack of a perfect waste recovery system is a significant barrier. Accordingly, the low recovery rate of waste oils increases the cost of raw materials and inhibits the mass production of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of waste oils. Take China as an example, no more than 40% of waste cooking oil is recycled legally as a consequence of the short of technical and administrative supervision (Liu et al., 2018). All around the world, more than 0.5 million tons of waste cooking oil are discharged into the environment every year (Yacob et al., 2015). This problem is even more prominent in developing or underdeveloped countries. Waste oils are conveniently poured into the drain in most cases without the complete recycling system, posing a deleterious effect on cultivated land, rivers, and the marine environment (Tsoutsos et al., 2016). In view of the decentralized distribution of waste oils resources, small distributed waste oils collection and recycling centers can be scattered in various centers of human activity. This type of plant can lower the capital investment and economic threshold, simplify transportation and logistics, and ease the environmental burden, which will be well received in developing or underdeveloped countries. Furthermore, the development of related industries for recycling waste oils is inseparable from government support and guidance. Fortunately, national governments have introduced policies to regulate and incentivize waste oils as clean power resource (Liu et al., 2018). The Chinese government has promoted the recycling and harmless treatment of waste oils by establishing special funding schemes and recycling trials in 33 cities. For instance, biodiesel enterprises can obtain a subsidy of 16.77 USD/t of biodiesel from the Suzhou municipal government (Yang et al., 2018). The US government provides subsidies to biodiesel enterprises at 0.50 USD/gallon of biodiesel and increases the recovery rate by approaching 100% (Zhang et al., 2014). Moreover, the conversion of waste oils through pyrolysis will offer numerous social, economic, and environmental benefits, and will benefit from government support like tax breaks, financial support, and subsidies for production and infrastructure. This support will significantly stimulate the development of relevant industries (Smeets et al., 2009). Nevertheless, only some countries and regions have formulated and implemented related policies, which indicates that the potential of waste oils as raw materials for biofuels production still has room for improvement. The promulgation and implementation of relevant policies and regulations will further accelerate the resource utilization of waste oils in other countries. Additionally, intelligent modeling methods including a least-squares support vector machine or artificial neural networks can be utilized to predict the target parameters like bio-oil or biochar yield and quality based on the input parameters such as raw materials, mixing ratio, and processing conditions. However, accurate experimental data is of critical importance to clarify these complicated processes and validate established models. Therefore, the first key step in chemical recovery research is to improve the accuracy, completeness, validity, and completeness of the experimental data. Despite some important achievements that have been made in experimental and characterization techniques, there is still room to improve experimental data sets to a higher quality. It should be noted that there is still a need for broader product characterization and a 100% mass balance (Dogu et al., 2021). Meanwhile, quantitative analysis of bio-oil is needed to optimize the pyrolysis process and the subsequent bio-oil upgrading process. The identification of individual compounds and the quantification of the overall content of compounds with characteristic functional groups are the major challenges. Advanced technologies like ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry need to be developed and applied to solve these problems (Staš et al., 2020). Mass production of bio-oil from conventional or advanced pyrolysis of waste oils is the necessary approach and method to realize the industrialization and commercialization of bio-oil. Accordingly, a massive scale-up of research on the pyrolysis of waste oils needs to be conducted. As most current studies are carried out at the gram level or lower, expanding the scale of research is crucial to the development of successful industrial-scale production and the subsequent market application of bio-oil generated from the pyrolysis of waste oils. Fig. 9 presents the process of waste oils collection and biofuels production. Waste oils are collected from factories, restaurants, and homes and transported to the collection center. The collected waste oils are delivered to the pyrolysis process after pretreatment. The addition of co-feedstocks and catalysts can ameliorate the pyrolysis process and product properties, biogas, biochar, and bio-oil will be produced. Biogas can be applied in the pretreatment and pyrolysis processes to cut down transportation costs and energy input. Bio-oil can be sold for profit as a substitute for fossil fuel. Biochar can be utilized as a catalyst in pyrolysis or sold for many industrial applications. The control system monitors the entire biofuels production system based on the market or customer requirements, thereby helping the company to effectively decrease production costs and increase profits."
11,Conclusions,"This review concentrates on the conventional and advanced pyrolysis of waste oils to produce biofuels. The literature has indicated that waste oils are suitable feedstocks for pyrolysis due to their high EHI and volatile content. Moreover, clean and safe pyrolysis technology is the best method to dispose of waste oils and generate valuable products, owing to its vast advantages of high efficiency, sustainability, low cost, and extensive applicability. Meanwhile, co-pyrolysis with other materials, waste plastics in particular, makes a considerable contribution to the enhancement of final products and the reduction of operational costs. Additionally, coexisting bifunctional catalyst, especially SBA-15@MgO@Zn, has embodied its superiority and become a future development trend, which can simultaneously reduce the high acid value, prolong the catalyst service life, and improve the properties of target products. Thus, catalytic co-pyrolysis will further promote the development and commercialization of waste oils pyrolysis. Based on the economic perspective, waste oils pyrolysis possesses remarkable economic and social values, which can benefit from product revenue, waste oils disposal fee, and government support. Consequently, pyrolysis has broad prospects and will play a vital role in the waste oils recovery industry."
