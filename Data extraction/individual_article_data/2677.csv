0,Introduction,"Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an alternative technology to overcome the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems [1,2]. Many semiconductor photocatalysts with visible light response have been studied and developed aiming to effectively harness solar energy [3–6]. Ternary metal sulfides have been extensively regarded as visible-light active photocatalysts owing to their relatively narrow band gaps when compared with the relevant oxide-based photocatalysts [7,8]. Among the ternary metal sulfides, ZnIn2S4 – the only semiconducting material with a layered structure in the AB2X4 family [9] – is a promising candidate as a photocatalyst for various organic transformations [6,10], degradation of organic compounds [11,12] and water splitting for H2 evolution [13,14]. Unfortunately, a fast recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs and photocorrosion restrict its photocatalytic efficiency and therefore furtherpractical applications [15,16]. Forming a heterojunction from two or more materials with compatible band alignments is considered as a facile strategy to decrease the e−/h+ recombination rate and enhance the e−/h+ pair separation between their individual constituent materials, which results in enhanced photocatalytic efficiency [17]. As reported [18–21], fabrication of the bismuth-based ZnIn2S4 heterojunctions by combining ZnIn2S4 with the optimum amounts of bismuth-related materials such as Bi2S3, BiVO4, Bi2MoO6 and BiOCl can considerably improve the photo-efficacy in comparison to the single materials. Bi2WO6 is also one of the attractive bismuth-related photocatalysts due to its the high oxidation ability, enabling a considerable efficiency in the photodegradation of organic compounds [22,23]. As a consequence of these properties and the compatibility of band potentials between Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 [5,20,24], Bi2WO6 is considered as a good co-catalyst to combine with ZnIn2S4. Jo et al. [24] reported the fabrication of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 composites with different amounts of ZnIn2S4 in an effort to improve the photoactivity of ZnIn2S4 for the degradation of pharmaceuticals (metronidazole). Nevertheless, the efficacy of this composite is still poorer than that of ZnIn2S4. Furthermore, the other photocatalytic applications, particularly the elimination of organic reagents in wastewater and production of H2 from water splitting were not studied. In terms of the synthesis of Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 powders, many studies have reported the use of a hydrothermal method [4,10,24–26]. However, a major limitation of this approach is the high energy consumption and requirement of long reaction times. Microwave irradiation synthesis – an internal heating method – is an alternative approach for the rapid and economical preparation of several semiconductor materials [18,27]. During microwave heating, heat is generated by the interactions between the electromagnetic radiation and dielectric species in a solution medium. By applying the electromagnetic radiation to the reaction system, these species can orientate with the rapidly alternating electric field by rotation, friction and collision. These phenomena lead to an increase in local temperature, enabling short reaction times and high reaction rates. As a result, thermal gradients can be substantially reduced to obtain an efficient and uniform chemical reaction, and thus the desired materials with narrow size-distributed particles can be formed in a relative short time when compared to the external heating methods [27,28]. In this research study, the direct Z-scheme Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction was applied for degradation of organic pollutants and the production of H2 gas. Salicylic acid and methylene blue were used as models of non-dye and dye organic pollutants. A cyclic microwave irradiation combined with a wet impregnation method was employed to fabricate Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites with different weight percentages of Bi2WO6. The photoactivities of these nanocomposites were investigated in comparison with ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient current response measurements were carried out to further examine a charge transfer efficiency and separation of e−/h+ pairs. The charge transfer mechanisms for the enhanced photo-efficiency of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst in all photocatalytic reactions were proposed based on energy band potentials determined from the Mott-Schottky plot combined with the trapping experimental results and the consideration of the reduction potentials of active oxygen species."
1,Experimental procedure,
2,"Preparation of ZnIn2S4, Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 powders","2.1 Preparation of ZnIn2S4, Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 powders ZnIn2S4 powder was prepared by dissolving Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, InCl3·4H2O and thioacetamide with 1:2:4 mol ratios in ethylene glycol (40.0 mL). The mixture was then placed in the microwave oven (2450 MHz-EMS28205, Electrolux, China) and treated with the microwave radiation at 300 W for different processing cycles (30, 45 and 60 cycles), where one cycle was 30 sec on and 60 sec off. For the preparation of Bi2WO6 powder, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O with 2:1 mol ratios were mixed in DI water (40.0 mL) under vigorous stirring. The mixture was then treated with the microwave radiation (600 W, 30 cycles). The collected powder was dried and further calcined (500 °C, 5 h). The Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites were fabricated using a procedure similar to that in our previously reported study [18]. The fabricated Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 powders were designated as x%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4, where x represents 6.25, 10, 12.5, 18 and 25%wt of Bi2WO6. A physical mixture sample, designated as PM, was also prepared by a physical grinding of the Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 powders together for comparison."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the synthesized powders were recorded by a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer to determine their purity and structure. The JEOL JSM-6335F and JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscopes were used to record the field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the samples. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical Ltd.) were used to analyze elemental compositions in the samples. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum was recorded on a Bruker EMX-Micro spectrometer at room temperature with a modulation frequency of 100.00 kHz. Optical properties were studied by a UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (UV–vis DRS, UV-1800 Shimadzu) with barium sulfate (BaSO4) as a reference material, and an Avantes AvaSpec-2048TEC-USB2 photoluminescence spectrometer. The surface area and porosities of the samples were investigated by N2 adsorption at −196 °C using a NOVA-e, Quantachrome instrument and calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. Prior the analysis, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 3 h under vacuum. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), transient photocurrent response and Mott-Schottky measurements were performed on a PGSTAT128N Autolab Potentiostat/galvanostat instrument (Metrohm Siam Ltd.) with a sample deposited on a FTO coated glass substrate as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as a reference electrode, and Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M, pH ~ 6) as an electrolyte. The EIS spectra were recorded by employing a bias potential of 1.5 V with a frequency in the range of 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz and an amplitude of 0.05 V without light irradiation. The transient photocurrent response was measured in a light on–off process with a pulse of 30 s and an applied potential of 1.0 V. A 50 W LED lamp was used as a visible-light source (Model COB LED CHIP, YNL [29]). The Mott-Schottky plots were analyzed at 10 Hz frequency and 5 mV amplitude."
4,Photocatalytic degradation and H2 production tests,"2.3 Photocatalytic degradation and H2 production tests The photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing an organic substrate (100 mL of methylene blue (MB) or salicylic acid (SA)). The concentrations of MB and SA solutions were 1.25 × 10−4 and 2.0 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively. The suspension was stirred for 30 min in the dark, followed by irradiation under the 50 W LED light (Model COB LED CHIP, YNL [29]) for 300 min. Every 60 min of the reaction, the solution (2 mL) was taken. The concentrations of the residual organic compounds at different reaction times were monitored by the UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer at the wavelength of maximum absorbance. The photodegradation efficiency (%DE) and reaction kinetics were calculated using the following equations: (1) % D E = A 0 - A A 0 × 100 (2) ln A 0 A = k t where A 0 and A represent the initial and the remaining concentrations of MB (or SA) solution, respectively. The k and t represent the initial rate constant and reaction time, respectively. A blank experiment without the addition of the photocatalyst (photolysis) was also conducted under the same experimental conditions to make sure that the degradation of organic compounds certainly takes place due to the photocatalytic reaction. Total organic carbon (TOC) of the supernatant solution after 300 min of irradiation was determined on a TOC analyzer (Multi N/C 3100, Analytik Jena AG). Trapping experiments were performed in the reaction solution containing SA and 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. Various reagents (1 mmol L−1) were used as scavengers, such as ascorbic acid (ASC) [30], isopropyl alcohol (iPrOH) [31], ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) [30], potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) [32], were added into the reaction solution to trap superoxide radicals (O2 −), hydroxyl radicals ( OH), holes (h+) and electrons (e−), respectively. The nitrotetrazolium blue transformation (NBT) method was used to confirm the detection of O2 − radicals generated during the photocatalytic reaction [33]. The test procedures were as follows: the photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of the NBT solution (2.0x10−5 mol L−1) and then the suspension was irradiated under 50 W LED light for 60 min. Finally, the suspension was centrifuged, and the absorption spectrum of the supernatant solution was measured using UV–vis spectrophotometer at 265 nm. The OH radicals can be detected by benzoic acid hydroxylation method [34]. Firstly, the photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of the benzoic acid solution (2.0x10−5 mol L−1) and then the suspension was irradiated under 50 W LED light for 60 min, yields o-hydroxybenzoic acid. Following this, an FeCl3 solution was dropped into the supernatant solution to form a Fe(III)-hydroxybenzoic acid complex. Finally, the complex solution was measured at a wavelength of 520 nm by UV–vis spectrophotometer. For the photocatalytic H2 production test, the photocatalyst (20 mg) was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing methanol (20%v/v). The suspension was stirred in the dark under argon gas flowing for 30 min and then exposed to the 150 W xenon light (Model 6256, Newport [29]) for 180 min. The produced gas (5 mL) was sampled at every 30 min of irradiation and the concentrations of H2 gas were then analyzed using a PerkinElmer Clarus 480 gas chromatograph. Reusability and stability of the photocatalyst for the MB degradation and H2 evolution reactions were examined. After the first run of the reaction, the photocatalyst was recovered from the reaction solution by centrifugation. The recovered photocatalyst sample was then washed with DI water for several times and dried. Three cycles of the photocatalytic reactions were performed under the same conditions. The reused photocatalyst was further characterized by XRD and FESEM."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Photocatalytic activity of the ZnIn2S4 samples synthesized at different microwave irradiation cycles,"3.1 Photocatalytic activity of the ZnIn2S4 samples synthesized at different microwave irradiation cycles The XRD spectra of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 powders are shown in Fig. 1 (a). All of the spectra show diffraction peaks of (006), (101), (102), (103), (104), and (110) planes at 2θ of 21.59°, 26.95°, 27.69°, 28.51°, 30.20° and 47.18°, respectively, corresponding to the XRD pattern of a hexagonal ZnIn2S4 structure (JCPDS No. 01-072-0773). No possible impurities are observed. The peak broadening implies that the crystallite size is in the nanoscale. Their FESEM images are shown in Fig. 1(b)–(d). At 30 cycles, incomplete flower-like microspheresare formed. The powder is composed of mainly aggregated particles and partially collapsed nanosheets. More complete flower-like microspheres are observed after being irradiated for 45 cycles and the perfect flower-like microspheres can be obtained at 60 cycles. The diameterof the flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres increasedwith prolongedprocessing times (0.32, 0.38 µm and 0.53 µm for the 30, 45 and 60 cycles, respectively). The microstructures of these ZnIn2S4 powders shown in the TEM images (Fig. 1(e)–(g)) appear to be the flower-like microspheres that are built up of thin nanosheets with the average thicknesses of 106, 13 and 9 nm for the powders synthesized using 30, 45 and 60 cycles, respectively. These results imply that processing cycles affect the morphology, microstructure and size of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 particles. The SAED patterns (Fig. S1) of all ZnIn2S4 powders were indexed to the (102), (104) and (110) planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 crystalline structure, according to the JCPDS database. The UV–vis DRS spectra of the ZnIn2S4 samples (Fig. 2 (a)) appear in the visible light region. Regarding the direct transition of ZnIn2S4 [18], the band gap energy (Eg) values, estimated from the Tauc’s plots, were 2.42, 2.43, and 2.45 eV for the ZnIn2S4 powders synthesized at 30, 45 and 60 cycles, respectively. There is no significant difference in the absorption edges and Eg values of these samples, suggesting the minor role of the light absorption properties in their photocatalytic activity. However, visible-light absorption ability of the ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 60 cycles is better than those of the others, implying that this sample can effectively utilize visible light, and thus e−/h+ pairs canbeproduced moreefficiently. EDS and XPS analyses can be used to determine the bulk and surface elemental compositions of materials, respectively [35]. The elemental compositions obtained from the EDS and XPS analyses of ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 60 cycles reveal the atomic ratios of Zn, In, and S elements of 1:2.21:3.47 (Fig. S2(a)) and 1:2.49:3.54 (Fig. S2(b)), respectively. These elemental analyses suggest that sulfur vacancies could exist in the synthesized ZnIn2S4 material. EPR measurement of ZnIn2S4 was carried out to further confirm the existence of sulfur vacancies on the surface of ZnIn2S4. The ZnIn2S4 shows a strong EPR signal at g = 2.003 (Fig. S2(c)) which indicates an entrapment of electrons in sulfur vacancies [36–38]. These results infer that sulfur vacancies are generated not only on the surface of ZnIn2S4 but also throughout the bulk ZnIn2S4 porous structure. The formation of sulfur vacancies in the ZnIn2S4 structure is probably attributed to the decrease in the barrier of nucleation and ultrafast crystallization of ZnIn2S4 induced by microwave irradiation [39]. Photodegradation efficiency of all ZnIn2S4 samples for the MB degradation are shown in Figs. 2(b) and S3. Among the other ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts, the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst synthesized using 60 cycles exhibits the highest efficiency (%DE = 59.8% and k values = 0.0033 min−1), which could be attributed to the perfect, flower-like, microstructure of this photocatalyst. This hierarchical three-dimensional structure facilitates the efficient light harvesting and multi–reflections of the incident light within its structure, as evidenced by its visible light absorption ability (Fig. 2(a)). Moreover, the BET analysis reveal that the surface area values of the ZnIn2S4 powders synthesized at 30, 45, and 60 cycles are 77.0, 86.7, and 102.1 m2 g−1 with the total pore volume values of 0.2484, 0.2874 and 0.3434 cm3 g−1, respectively. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding curves of the pore size distribution are provided in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. All ZnIn2S4 samples exhibit type-IV isotherms with recognizable H3 type hysteresis loops in the range of 0.4–1.0P/P0. The shape of the hysteresis loop associated with slit-like mesopores formed by the aggregations of plate-like particles [40,41] that are produced by microwave irradiation route. In addition, the pore size distribution curves confirm that the ZnIn2S4 samples have mesopores with pore diameters in the range of 15–20 nm and the pore volume of the ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 60 cycles is the highest. The larger surface area and greater total pore volume of the ZnIn2S4 synthesized at 60 cycles result in more available sites for the organic molecules to adsorb on its porous structure, which are favourable to the photocatalytic reaction between the adsorbed organic molecules and the charge carriers that are migrated to the surface photocatalyst during the photocatalysis."
7,Photocatalytic activities of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites,"3.2 Photocatalytic activities of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites 3.2.1 Characterizations of the photocatalyst samples Fig. 3 shows XRD spectra of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite powders in comparison with pure Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4. The XRD spectrum of Bi2WO6 reveals the main signals at 28.30°, 32.67°, 47.14°, 55.82° and 58.54°, which are, respectively, indexed as (131), (060), (202), (331) and (262) crystal planes of an orthorhombic Bi2WO6 structure (JCPDS No. 00-039-0256). No possible impurities are observed, suggesting its high purity. For the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites, the major characteristic diffraction peaks of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 and orthorhombic Bi2WO6 phases are observed, indicating that ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 coexist in the nanocomposites. In addition, with increasing weight percentages of Bi2WO6 in the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites, the diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6 gradually strengthen in the intensity while the diffraction peak intensities of ZnIn2S4 gradually decrease. Moreover, the XRD peakpositions for the nanocomposites do not shift compared with those of pure Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4, implying that the crystal structures of these compounds are not destroyed after being fabricated by the wet-impregnation method. FESEM (Fig. 4 (c)) and TEM images (Fig. 5 (a)) of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite reveals that the uniform size distribution of spherical Bi2WO6 nanoparticles with an estimated diameter of around 50 nm (Fig. 4(b)) deposit on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 microspheres (Fig. 4(a)). EDS spectrum (Fig. 4(d)) exhibits the X-ray energies of the Zn, In, S, Bi, W and O elements, verifying that this nanocomposite consists of ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6. The atomic ratio of Zn, In and S in 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 is 1:2.21:2.80. The low content of S element corresponds to the above elemental analyses for ZnIn2S4. The TEM images at high-magnification of the marked area shown in Fig. 5(a) reveal the lattice spacings of 0.320 nm (Fig. 5(b) and 0.193 nm (Fig. 5(c)) which can be attributed to (102) and (202) planes of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 and orthorhombic Bi2WO6 crystalline structures, respectively. This implies that the nanocomposite is highly crystalline, and the ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 particles in the nanocomposite are coupled with intimate contact. Scanning TEM – EDS elemental mapping images of the nanocomposite sample (Fig. 5(d)–(i)) present homogeneous distributions of Zn, In, S, Bi, W and O elements, confirming the successful fabrication of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure. The survey XPS spectrum of 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 6 (a)) contains the appearance of XPS signals of Zn, In, S, Bi, W and O elements which is in agreement with the above EDS analysis. The C 1s signal appeared at 284.6 eV is a result from an adventitious carbon or from the carbon that was used for an energy referencing [10]. The spectrum of Zn 2p for ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 6(b)) exhibits two peaks at 1022.13 and 1045.12 eV, assigning to the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of Zn2+ [24]. After combining with Bi2WO6, these peaks slightly shift to 1022.03 and 1045.05 eV, respectively. The spectrum of In 3d for Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4 is shown in Fig. 6(c). For ZnIn2S4, the peaks appeared at 445.20 and 452.82 eV correspond to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 of In3+, respectively [24]. For the nanocomposite, the binding energies of In 3d peaks shift to higher values (445.35 and 452.93 eV for In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively). In Fig. 6(d), the S 2p region for ZnIn2S4 can be divided into two peaks at 161.94 and 163.17 eV, which are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2− [24], respectively. For the nanocomposite, the S 2p signals positively shift to 162.05 and 163.26 eV, respectively. XPS spectrum of Bi 4f for Bi2WO6 (Fig. 6(e)) shows two strong peaks at 159.63 and 164.91 eV, attributed to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of Bi3+, respectively [26]. After combining with ZnIn2S4, the Bi 4f signals shift to the lower binding energies (159.47 and 164.69 eV for Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively). The XPS spectra of W 4f in Bi2WO6 (Fig. 6(f)) shows two peaks at 35.93 and 38.05 eV, attributed to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W6+, respectively [26]. Introducing Bi2WO6 to form the nanocomposite leads to the negatively shift of the W 4f peaks (35.79 eV and 37.86 eV for W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 peaks, respectively). Besides, the O 1s signals of Bi2WO6 and the nanocomposite are observed at 530.54 eV and 532.15 eV, respectively (Fig. 6(g)) [26]. The shifts in the binding energy values of the elements in this nanocomposite are the result of the change in outer electron cloud density around these elements after the formation of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction. This indicates that a strong interfacial interaction betweenthese two componentsin the nanocomposite is formed rather than a simple physical interaction [24,42,43], corresponding with the results obtained from the TEM images (Fig. 5(a)–(c)). This interaction could allow the transfer of charge carriers during photocatalysis and consequently its photocatalytic activity could be enhanced [44]. UV–vis DRS spectra of Bi2WO6, ZnIn2S4 and 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 shown in Fig. 7 (a) exhibit the absorption of light in the visible-light region, implying their visible-light responsive behavior. The absorption edge of 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 shifts to a longer wavelength position in comparison with that of Bi2WO6, suggesting that Bi2WO6 was successfully coupled with ZnIn2S4. Moreover, the absorption intensity of the nanocomposite is considerably stronger than that of Bi2WO6, implying that the nanocomposite can utilize visible light more efficiently and consequently produces a greater number of photogenerated charges during photocatalysis. The Eg value of Bi2WO6, determined from the Tauc plots (Fig. 7(b)) based on the direct allowed transition in Bi2WO6 [25], was 2.82 eV. The PL emission intensity of 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite shown in Fig. 7(c) is lower than those of ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6, indicating that the recombination probability of e−/h+ pairs in the nanocomposite is efficiently suppressed. An EIS Nyquist plot of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 electrode (Fig. 7(d)) exhibits the smallest arc diameter in comparison to that of the pure Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 electrodes, implying the lowest electron transfer resistance on the electrode’s surface [15]. Moreover, the transient photocurrent response (Fig. S4) shows that the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 electrode provides photocurrent density of 0.52 µA cm−2 which is about 2.4 and 18 times higher than those of ZnIn2S4 (0.22 µA cm−2) and Bi2WO6 (0.029 µA cm−2), respectively. These outcomes result from the effective e−/h+ separation and transportation at the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction interface [43,45–47]. The positive slope in the Mott-Schottky plots of both Bi2WO6 (Fig. 7(e)) and ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 7(f)) indicates their n-type character. The flat-band potentials (Efb), determined from the x-intercept of the curves, are −0.40 and −0.81 V for Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. The potentials in NHE scale (ENHE) were calculated by the following equation: (3) E NHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.21 Consequently, the Efb values of Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 are −0.19 and −0.60 V (vs. NHE), respectively. For the n-type semiconductor, a conduction band potential (ECB) is about 0.1 eV above its Efb level [48]. Thus, ECB of Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 are −0.29 and −0.70 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Combining these values with the Eg values, the valence band potentials (EVB) of Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 are 2.53 and 1.75 V (vs. NHE), respectively. 3.2.2 Photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds Photocatalytic activity results for the degradations of MB and SA are presented in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), respectively. Without photocatalyst, both MB and SA show no apparent changes in concentration, implying that self-decomposition (photolysis) of these organic compounds under visible light irradiation is negligible. ZnIn2S4 alone can degrade 59.8% of MB while Bi2WO6 barely degrades MB (Fig. 8(a)). For the degradation of SA, ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 can degrade 53.2% and 14.0% of SA, respectively. The higher photoactivity of ZnIn2S4 results from its better light absorption ability and electrochemical properties, as mentioned in the above UV–vis DRS, EIS and transient photocurrent response results. After formation of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunctions, photodegradation efficiencies of these photocatalysts towards MB and SA gradually increase with increased amount of Bi2WO6 (6.25, 10 and 12.5%wt). A decline in the photodegradation efficiency is observed when the amount of Bi2WO6 is further increased to 18%wt and 25%wt. This finding can be attributed to covering and shielding of the active site of the surface of ZnIn2S4 particles by the excessive quantity of the less-active Bi2WO6 nanoparticles as observed in the FESEM images (Fig. S5). In addition, a few Bi2WO6 (6.25 and 10%wt) nanoparticles distributed on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 particles (Fig. S5) also decrease the efficiency of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4. Among the heterojunction photocatalysts, 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 provides the highest photodegradation efficiency; 95.0% of MB and 72.0% of SA are degraded within 300 min. The initial rate constant (k) for the MB and SA photodegradations were calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). The k value for the MB degradation over 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst is 9.8x10−3 min−1 which is 3.0 times greater than that for ZnIn2S4 (3.3x10−3 min−1). This nanocomposite photocatalyst can also degrade SA with the highest k value (5.0x10−3 min−1) among the other photocatalysts. The improvement of the kinetic rate for degradation of SA is 1.7 times higher than that of ZnIn2S4. The photodegradation efficiencies, calculated k values and R 2 of the SA and MB degradation for all photocatalysts are summarized in Table S1 and the kinetic plots are presented in Fig. S6. Herein, the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 is maximized after introducing only 12.5%wt of Bi2WO6, which is lower than that stated in the previous report (50%wt of Bi2WO6) [24]. This finding could be due to the nano-spherical shape of Bi2WO6 and the porous structure of ZnIn2S4 particles, synthesized using cyclic microwave irradiation method, which greatly facilitates the intimate interfacial contact between these Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 particles. Consequently, charge separation and migration between the two components are efficiently promoted. Notably, the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 sample obtained from the physical mixing gives lower photocatalytic activity (%DE = 23.1% and 51.0% for MB and SA, respectively) than that of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 sample obtained from the chemically mixing. This result indicates that the enhanced activity results from the formation of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction that has been fabricated by the synthetic strategy used in this work rather than the simple physical mixing. The recyclability of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction towards the MB degradation (Fig. 8(e)) shows no notable decrease in the degradation is observed during the three-run test, even though the MB molecules with intense blue color are adsorbed on surface of the photocatalyst which might suppress its light absorption capability. This finding verifies the recyclability and good stability of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction for use as the photocatalyst in the photodegradation of organic dyes. Usually, the photodegradation reactions of organic dyes containing N-alkyl groups are parallel and/or competitively proceeded by destruction of the chromophore structure and N-de-alkylation processes. The MB degradation mechanism can be monitored by the changes in the absorption spectra of the MB supernatant solutions during the photodegradation reaction in the presence of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst as illustrated in Fig. S7(a). As can be seen, the characteristic absorption band of MB decreases with a concomitant wavelength shift to shorter wavelengths, suggesting that stepwise N-de-methylation and destruction of the chromophore structure pathways would be occurring. However, the dramatically depletion of the absorbance with a slight blue shift during 0–180 min of irradiation imply that the destruction of the chromophore structure predominates over N-demethylation [49]. After being irradiated for 240 and 300 min, the characteristic band of MB significantly shifts to the shorter wavelengths, indicating that the N-de-methylation of MB molecules becomes a considerable pathway. The broad absorption bands in the visible range of 608–655 nm originates from the mixtures of Azure A, Azure B and Azure C intermediates that are derived from the N-de-methylation of MB [50,51]. Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was further performed in order to determine the mineralization of MB during the photodegradation process. Fig. S7(b) shows that 33.4% and 3.2% of TOC are removed after 300 min of the MB photodegradation reaction using 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4 as photocatalysts, respectively. This result implies that the original MB molecules are partly degraded into CO2, water and/or inorganic species and almost transformed to N-de-methylated intermediates as mentioned above. Although the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst cannot achieve complete mineralization, this photocatalyst has a relatively enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity and mineralization ability for MB in comparison to the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. Active species trapping experiments on the photodegradation of SA are presented in Fig. 8(f). The additions of ASC and EDTA-2Na significantly suppress the photodegradation rate. Meanwhile, employing iPrOH or K2S2O8 also reduces the degradation efficiency, suggesting that O2 − and OH radicals as well as h+ and e− are responsible for the degradation reactions. The generation of O2 − can be proved by using the well-known nitrotetrazolium blue transformation (NBT) method, respectively [33]. The O2 − radicals that are generated by O2 reduction during the photocatalytic reaction can react with NBT to form the soluble blue formazan in aqueous solution, which shows an UV–vis absorption spectrum at absorption maximum of 265 nm. The decrease in absorbance at an absorption maximum indicates the higher NBT conversion which correlates to the increase in the generated O2 − radical. The absorption spectra of the NBT supernatant solutions after the O2 − detection test are shown in Fig. S8(a). The 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst exhibits lower intensity of absorption peak when compared to ZnIn2S4. In a similar way, the OH radicals can be detected by the benzoic acid hydroxylation, followed by the complexation with Fe(III) ion [34]. The generated OH radicals can react with benzoic acid to yield o-hydroxybenzoic acid, and the o-hydroxybenzoic acid can form complex with Fe3+ ion added. Thereby, the OH radicals generated during the photocatalytic reaction can be investigated by measuring the absorbance of the Fe(III)-hydroxybenzoic acid complex in the supernatant solution at a wavelength of 520 nm. The increase in the absorption intensity signifies the higher concentration of Fe(III)-hydroxybenzoic acid complex, relating to the increase in the generated OH radical. The absorption spectra of the complex solutions after the OH detection test are shown in Fig. S8(b). The 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst presents the higher intensity of absorption peak when compared to ZnIn2S4. These results confirm that the O2 − and OH radicals are photo-generated during the photocatalytic reactions. Based on the data obtained from the Mott-Schottky plots and UV–vis DRS analysis, the staggered band alignment for the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction are illustrated in Fig. 8(g). With this alignment, two plausible charge transfer mechanisms – “conventional” and “Z-scheme” mechanisms – could be suggested [18,24]. Under visible light radiation, both Bi2WO6 and ZnIn2S4 in the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction produce holes (h+) and electrons (e−) at their VB and CB, respectively. After that, electrons at CB of ZnIn2S4 could move to CB of Bi2WO6 and holes at VB of Bi2WO6 could move to VB of ZnIn2S4 as illustrated in Fig. S9. According to this charge transfer pathway, due to the ECB of Bi2WO6 (−0.29 V) is more negative than the reduction potential of O2/O2 − (−0.046 V vs. NHE) [1], the electrons accumulated at its CB can reduce O2 into O2 − radicals. However, holes at VB of ZnIn2S4 cannot oxidize OH− to form OH radicals because of the less positive EVB of ZnIn2S4 (1.75 V) than the reduction potential of OH/OH− (+2.40 V vs. NHE) [24]. These findings are inconsistent with the results revealed from the trapping experiments (Fig. 8(f)). Therefore, charge transfer pathway in the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction would occur through the Z-scheme mechanism (Fig. 8(h)) rather than the conventional mechanism (Fig. S9). The Z-scheme mechanism can be briefly described as follows: after the heterojunction photocatalyst being exposed to the light, ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 generate e−/h+ pairs. The electrons, accumulated at CB of Bi2WO6 (ECB = −0.29 V), move to the more positive VB of ZnIn2S4 (EVB = 1.75 V). As a result, the e−/h+ pairs are separated and thus their recombination process is hindered as mentioned in the PL and EIS results (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). The O2 − radicals can be generated at CB of ZnIn2S4 which then directly degrade the molecule of SA. At the same time, holes that have high reduction potential, accumulated at VB of Bi2WO6 (EVB = 2.53 V), can preferentially react with SA. In addition, holes can also oxidize OH− to produce OH radicals. 3.2.3 Photocatalytic H2 production The Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts were also applied for the photocatalytic reduction of water, where methanol was used as a sacrificial reagent. The Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 with 6.25, 12.5 and 25%wt of Bi2WO6 can produce 297.5, 395.5 and 175.1 μmol g−1 of H2 gas within 180 min (Fig. 9 (a)). Thehighest amount of H2 productionis achieved on the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction photocatalyst (395.5 μmol g−1) which is about 1.5 times higher than that of ZnIn2S4 (267.5 μmol g−1). For Bi2WO6, H2 gas cannot be produced. This is likely due to the rapid e−/h+ recombination rate of Bi2WO6 as well as the poor e−/h+ migration to its surface as referred in the PL and EIS results. The photocatalytic H2 production rate of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst compared with the previous literatures that relates to ZnIn2S4-based heterojunction photocatalysts including other heterojunction photocatalysts are shown in Table 1 . The variation in the H2 production rates could be caused by the differences in the photocatalytic conditions used such as the light source power and type/concentration of sacrificial reagents. The recyclability of the 12.5%wt-Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst was investigated in three consecutive runs of H2 production reaction. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the photocatalytic production activity shows no significant loss after three runs. Additionally, XRD patterns (Fig. 9(c)) of the photocatalyst samples before and after the recyclability test show negligible changes in the diffraction intensity as well as the diffraction position of both ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 parts. Moreover, as illustrated in the FESEM image (Fig. 9(d)), the morphology of this heterojunction photocatalyst is retained after the recyclability test. These results indicate reusability and excellent stability of the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction which are vital for practical application. The knowledge of ECB and EVB of semiconductors with respect to the reduction potentials of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE) and O2/H2O (+1.23 V vs. NHE) is essential to meet the success in the H2 production. Fig. 9(g) illustrates that the ECB and EVB of ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 in the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction are suitable for photocatalytic water splitting. The photocatalytic process begins when the heterojunction photocatalyst is exposed to visible light. Both ZnIn2S4 and Bi2WO6 in the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction are activated, and thus e−/h+ pairs are generated. Simultaneously, electrons at CB of Bi2WO6 recombine with holes at VB of ZnIn2S4, following the direct Z-scheme mechanism. In this mechanism, H+ is reduced by the highly reductive electrons at CB of ZnIn2S4, in the meantime, the strong oxidative holes at VB of Bi2WO6 are consumed by methanol to form oxidation products (Fig. 9(e)). The step-wise mechanisms are proposed as follows: (4) Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 + visible light → Bi2WO6 (e− and h+) + ZnIn2S4 (e− and h+) (5) Bi2WO6 (e− and h+) + ZnIn2S4 (e− and h+) → Bi2WO6 (hVB +) + ZnIn2S4 (eCB −) (6) 2H+ + 2e− at CB of ZnIn2S4 → H2 (7) methanol + h+ at VB of Bi2WO6 → oxidation products"
8,Conclusions,"The direct Z-scheme Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction, synthesized in this work, significantly enhanced the photodegradation of MB and SA, and also enhanced the production of H2 gas with high stability and renewable performance. The photo-efficacy of the heterojunction was maximized after adding a small amount of Bi2WO6 (12.5%wt). The morphological characterizations of this photocatalyst revealed that the spherical Bi2WO6 nanoparticles were finely distributed on the ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, forming the Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction structure.The optical characterizations and electrochemical measurements of this heterojunction indicated that the UV–vis DRS spectrum shifted towards longer wavelength region in comparison to that of Bi2WO6, and this heterojunction provided the reduction in probability of charge recombination and the enhancement of charge transportation. The enhancement in the photocatalytic activity is derived from the effective utilization of light and the Z-scheme band structure of Bi2WO6/ZnIn2S4 with intimate contact. This heterojunction displays good ability for the applications in wastewater purification and production of renewable energy."
