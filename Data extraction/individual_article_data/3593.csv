0,Introduction,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to abnormal glucose metabolism during pregnancy, which may lead to an increased risk of comorbid polyhydramnios, gestational hypertension, foetal macrosomia, foetal growth restriction, foetal malformation, miscarriage, and premature delivery [1]. GDM is a common but complex gestational complication. Its pathogenesis may involve multiple aspects including insulin resistance [1], chronic inflammatory response [2], and immune regulation [3], and there is still room for improvement of the clinical diagnosis and treatment of GDM. In recent years, an increasing number of studies has pointed out that the occurrence and development of GDM is closely related to intestinal microbes [4], but most of them utilised 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing or whole genome sequencing methods, which are time-consuming and laborious, and difficult to fully promote in clinical application. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as increased density and/or abnormal composition of microbiota in the small intestine [5]. The following clinical symptoms may occur after SIBO comorbidity: abdominal pain, bloating, persistent cramps, steatorrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, and malnutrition as well as generalized symptoms of dyspepsia [6]. The diagnosis of SIBO is based on the lactulose breath test (LBT), which has the advantages of being non-invasive, convenient, sensitive, accurate, and reproducible [5]. Jose C et al. [7] believe that once the intestinal microbial ecological balance is broken, pathogenic bacteria will dominate, leading to a variety of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Studies have also suggested that the mother’s gut microbiota is associated with metabolic diseases, such as obesity and GDM, and improving the intestinal immune system may be a new method for treating such diseases [8]. This study aims to explore the correlation between GDM and SIBO by using the LBT, and to explore the interaction between its results and blood glucose level, inflammatory indicators, vitamin levels, and the outcome of mother and child, to provide a new direction for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
1,Patients and methods,
2,Patients,"2.1 Patients From September 2018 to July 2019, The patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University(Henan ,China) were randomly selected as the experimental group (GDM group), and the normal pregnant women(PCG group) and normal women (PPCG group) were selected as the control group. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the GDM group meets the GDM diagnostic criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [9]. The blood glucose levels should be lower than 5.1, 10.0, and 8.5 mmol/L (92, 180, and 153 mg/dl) before the intake of glucose, 1 h, and 2 h after the intake of glucose, respectively. A blood glucose level at any one of the three time points exceeding the above standard leads to a diagnosis of GDM. 2) Pregnant women without GDM were selected as the pregnant control group. 3) Control group before pregnancy selected women of normal childbearing age without any complications. Subjects who met the following criteria were excluded: 1) subjects younger than 18 years old; 2) subjects with other complications of pregnancy; 3) Insulin users. 4)subjects with diabetes, obesity, or polycystic ovary syndrome before pregnancy; 5) Clinically diagnosed as anxiety, depression; 6) Persistent poor defecation for>3 months [10]; 7) subjects with a medical history of circulatory system, digestive system, etc., conditions; 8) Had been hospitalized for intestinal illness or had intestinal surgery; 9) subjects with long-term use of antibiotics or drugs that regulate intestinal flora; 10) subjects who had used antidiarrheal drugs, probiotics, or antibiotics in the last 2 weeks; 11) subjects with special habits such as taking yogurt or probiotic products every day; and 12) subjects with abnormal stool examination results. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the third affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University."
3,Diagnostic methods of clinical symptoms,"2.2 Diagnostic methods of clinical symptoms (1) Bloating: Must include both of the following:①Recurrent feeling of bloating or visible distension at least 3 days a month in the last 3 months;② Insufficient criteria for FD, IBS or other FGID. Criteria fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis[11].(2) Diarrhoea: Increased stool frequency (>3 times a day) and change of stool consistency (paste liquid) [12].(3) Serious constipation: There are two or more of the following six items:①Straining during more than one-fourth (25%) of defecations; ② Lumpy or hard stools > 25% of the time; ③ Sensation of anorectal obstruction > 25% of the time; ④ Sensation of incomplete evacuation > 25% of the time; ⑤ Manual maneuvers required to aid defecation > 25% of the time; ⑥<3 bowel movement per week[13]。"
4,Experimental method of hydrogen- and methane-based LBT,"2.3 Experimental method of hydrogen- and methane-based LBT The intake of foods that are prone to gas production, and rich in cellulose and carbohydrates, such as dairy products, soy products, artificially sweetened foods and beverages, alcohol-containing preparations, wheat noodles, high-cellulose vegetables, etc., were prohibited within the 24 h before the test, while cooked rice, beef, baked skinless chicken, eggs, and sugar-free water were allowed. Within the 12 h before the test, subjects were only allowed to drink a small amount of boiled water. On the test day, smoking (including second-hand smoke) was prohibited, subjects should brush their teeth, stay awake and quiet, and avoid intense activities [14]. The level of hydrogen and methane in the breath samples were measured using the BreathTracker SC (QuinTron, USA). The baseline level of hydrogen and methane in the fasting state was measured after calibration with standard gas. A total of 10 g of lactulose oral solution (Beijing Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in about 239 ml of warm water, which was quickly consumed by the subject, and the breath of the subject was tested every 20 min for 120 min [15]. The level of hydrogen and methan at each time point was measured and recorded, based on which the Time-Abundance curves for hydrogen and methan were generated."
5,Diagnostic method for SIBO,"2.4 Diagnostic method for SIBO The diagnostic standard of SIBO was defined on the literature [16–18] and the hydrogen and methan LBT of the breath analyser: ① Within 90 min of breath test, if the hydrogen concentration is higher than the fasting basic value by 20 ppm, it is considered as SIBO positive; ② if the methane concentration is higher than the fasting basic value by 10 ppm within 90 min of breath test, it is considered as SIBO positive; ③ if the hydrogen and methane concentrations do not reach the above values within 90 min of breath test, but higher than the sum of the hydrogen and methane fasting basic values by 15 ppm, it is considered as SIBO positive. Methane-predominant overgrowth is known as intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO).[5,14]"
6,"Measurement of levels of blood glucose, inflammatory indicators, and vitamins","2.5 Measurement of levels of blood glucose, inflammatory indicators, and vitamins Measurement of blood glucose was carried out according to the relevant requirements of the GDM diagnostic criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) [9], using the AU5400 fully automatic biochemical analyser (Beckman Coulter) and reagents purchased from Beijing Wantai Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. Routine blood examination was carried out using the BC-5300 automatic blood cell analyser (Mindray). The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was measured by immunoturbidimetry using the AU 5400 biochemical analyser (Beckman Coulter). Measurement of vitamin A, D, and E levels was performed by obtaining 5 ml of venous blood during the fasting state that was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the serum. The vitamin D level was then measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and the levels of vitamin A and E were measured using high performance liquid chromatography, using the IMMULITE2000 chemiluminescence apparatus, high performance liquid chromatograph (Siemens), and supporting kits. All the above operational procedures were carried out strictly following the instrument and laboratory operating standards."
7,Statistical methods,"SPSS 22.0 was used for statistical analyses. The count data are described by the frequency and rate, and the comparison between groups was performed using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact probability method. Normally distributed quantitative data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (x ± s), and the t-test or analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups. Non-normally distributed data are described by the median, and quartiles (P25, P75); the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for comparison between groups..P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The incidence rate of SIBO was the outcome of observation. According to our preliminary results, the treatment rate of group GDM was 48%, the rate of treatment in group PCG was 37%, the rate of treatment in group PPCG was 26%, let α = 0.05 , and the holding rate was 90%. Using SPSS 22.0 software to calculate the total sample size of three groups, n = 366 cases. Considering the situation of loss of follow-up and refusal of follow-up, the final number of subjects needed in GDM group, PCG group and ppcg group was 458, of which at least 153 subjects were needed in each group."
8,Results,"A total of 220 patients with GDM, 160 pregnant control cases, and 160 pre-pregnant control cases were included in the study. As shown in Table 1 , there was no statistical difference in general characteristics, such as age, height, weight, and body mass index, between the three groups."
9,Results of the clinical signs and symptoms,"4.1 Results of the clinical signs and symptoms The comparison of clinical symptoms of subjects in the three groups is shown in Table 2 . During the comparison between groups, we found that the proportion of abdominal distension in the GDM group was higher than that in the other two groups, and the proportion of diarrhea and severe constipation in the PCG group was higher than that in the other two groups. When comparing SIBO + and SIBO- in the three groups, there were no statistically significant differences(P = 0.066、P = 0.078、P = 0.088)."
10,Results of the hydrogen- and methan-based LBT,"4.2 Results of the hydrogen- and methan-based LBT The positive rates of SIBO in the GDM group, pregnant control group, and pre-pregnant control group were 54.55%,27.50%and 14.38%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the mean exhalation methan abundance in GDM group was significantly higher than that in PCG group and PPCG group. As shown in Fig. 1B, the mean exhalation hydrogen abundance in GDM group was significantly higher than that in PCG group and PPCG group."
11,Results of clinical tests,"4.3 Results of clinical tests All patients obtained their informed consent before entering the group, but some patients refused to cooperate with the examination due to personal reasons, asked to withdraw from the project, or did not strictly comply with the requirements of the project group, so they had to be excluded. Eventually, the test data from 111 (94.87%) GDM-P subjects, 98 (95.15%) GDM-N subjects, and 95 (82.61%) PCG-N subjects were included. Blood glucose(as shown in Table 3 ):(1) Fasting blood glucose: The GDM-P group was significantly higher than the GDM-N group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). (2) Regarding the blood glucose level 1 h after a meal: There was no statistically significant difference between GDM-P group and GDM-N group (P = 0.643). (3) Regarding the blood glucose level 2 h after a meal: There was no significant difference between GDM-P group and GDM-N group (P = 0.058).

The vitamin D level in the GDM-P group was significantly lower than that in the GDM-N and PCG-N groups, and the differences were statistically significant (P＜0.001, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in vitamin E levels between that in the GDM-P group and the GDM-N group (P = 0.152); however, there was a significant difference between levels in the GDM-P group and PCG-N group (P＜0.001)."
12,Results of maternal and child outcomes,"4.4 Results of maternal and child outcomes Due to the selection of outpatients, only a small number of patients eventually delivered in The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, accurate pregnancy outcome data can be found. Therefore, 30 cases in each group were selected for analysis. as shown in Table 5 . (1) Neonatal weight: GDM-P group was higher than GDM-N group and PCG-N group (p = 0.000).

(4) Intrapartum blood loss: there was no significant difference among the three groups (p = 0.916)."
13,Discussion,"The genes encoded by human intestinal microbes are called the “second genome” of the human body and intestinal microbes directly participate in the regulation of nutrient absorption, energy supply, and fat metabolism of the human body [19]. Bacteria are involved in the fermentation of disaccharides, and abnormal bacterial flora may increase the production of gas, resulting in abdominal distension and then abdominal pain, while the fermentation of short-chain fatty acids may cause water to permeate the intestinal cavity and cause diarrhea [20]. There is also some evidence that methan production causes constipation by reducing peristalsis [21].Our results showed that the proportion of abdominal distension in GDM patients was significantly higher than that in the control group. The proportion of diarrhea and severe constipation in pregnant women was also higher. During pregnancy, pregnant women may have abdominal depression, tightness, stiffness and other discomfort, which may cover up the symptoms of abdominal distension, so the actual proportion of abdominal distension may be higher. This may mean that if disordered flora is corrected, adverse clinical manifestations can be improved[22]. Lactulose and glucose are the most commonly used substrates in methan and hydrogen-based breath test. However, glucose may cause the risk of hyperglycemia, and people cannot absorb lactulose. Therefore, lactulose is safer as a substrate for GDM patients. All the subjects were detected in a quiet state after rest, and the detection results showed that CO2 was always at a low level, so the gas level did not need to be adjusted by CO2 levels, and it would not affect the results of methane hydrogen. At present, there is no final conclusion on the test time, we consider that the pregnant women's poor hunger and avoid hypoglycemic fainting, and so on, the detection time is limited to 2 h. The basic principle of the lactulose breath test (LBT) is that the human body does not produce hydrogen and methan gas in the molecular state, and the methan and hydrogen in the exhaled breath of the human are derived from the metabolites produced in the glycolysis process of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract [23]. When there is a methanogen in the small intestine, the methanogens consume hydrogen, combining two hydrogen molecules and one carbon dioxide molecule to form a methan molecule. In this case, if only the hydrogen content is measured, a false negative result may occur. Simultaneous measurement of hydrogen and methan can improve the accuracy and sensitivity of diagnosis [24]. The results of this study also confirmed that hydrogen- and methan-based LBT has a better detection rate than the hydrogen breath test alone. In addition,the patients we selected were all outpatients with mild illness, and they did not need insulin. They all controlled blood sugar by adjusting diet and exercise, which also reduced the interference of confounding factors. A large number of studies have shown that GDM is closely related to intestinal microorganisms, but most of the methods used are 16S rRNA sequencing[25]. In this study, we confirmed the close correlation between GDM and SIBO with a rapid detection method: about 53.18% of PATIENTS with GDM had SIBO, which was significantly higher than the control group during pregnancy and before pregnancy. We found that the mean hydrogen exhalation abundance and methan abundance in the GDM group were significantly increased, and the mean hydrogen exhalation abundance and methan abundance in THE GDM combined SIBO at each time point were significantly higher than those in the control group. Our study found that compared with GDM alone, the blood glucose value of GDM patients with SIBO was higher, the weight of newborns was heavier, and the blood glucose of newborns was lower, suggesting that GDM combined with SIBO will aggravate the disease and affect the maternal and neonatal outcomes. The mechanism of interaction between GDM and intestinal microorganisms is not yet clear, and relevant studies support the hypothesis that SIBO may play an important role in the development of GDM by inducing a proinflammatory signaling cascade[26]. Our experiment also showed that CRP in patients with GDM complicated with SIBO were significantly higher than those in the control group. In addition, studies have shown that vitamin A can regulate intestinal flora, reduce inflammatory responses, and strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier[27] . Vitamin D can enhance the intestinal barrier function and innate immune response, but also inhibit the T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, thus reducing the incidence of IBD[28]. Vitamin E may be involved in the development of obesity-related diseases by regulating intestinal flora[29]. In this study, we preliminarily found the correlation between vitamin D level and SIBO combined with GDM, thus opening a new idea for the mechanism of interaction between GDM and SIBO. The advantage of this study is that it combined hydrogen- and methan-based LBT and the diagnosis and treatment of SIBO+ GDM and provided a rapid and concise measurement method for related research, which further opens up new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In addition, this study preliminarily discussed the relationship between SIBO and blood glucose, inflammation indicators, and vitamin levels, providing ideas for studying the mechanism of interaction between GDM and intestinal microbes. Of course, this study also has its shortcomings; due to different eating habits in different regions, the research results have certain geographical limitations. A limited sample size may also limit this study. In summary, this study studied the correlation between GDM and SIBO by using LBT. It was found that the incidence of SIBO in GDM patients was significantly higher than that in the control groups, and the mean abundance of breath hydrogen and methan of SIBO+ subjects with GDM were significantly increased. In addition, we also preliminarily discussed that SIBO may affect the development and the outcomes of GDM through inflammatory indexes, vitamins and other related mechanisms. This not only provides a quick and simple method for studying the correlation between intestinal microbiota and GDM, but also opens up new ideas for protecting the maternal and child health of GDM patients. Of course, further research on the mechanism and development of treatment plans still require the support of a large amount of clinical and scientific data."
