0,Introduction,"Global climate change and energy crisis have brought unprecedented attention to renewable energy [1,2]. Scientists are working hard to replace fossil energy with renewable energy to cope with increasingly severe environmental pollutions, climate abnormalities and energy supply shortages. In the field of renewable energy, biomass energy has a wide range of sources and is considered as one of the important energy carriers [3]. Producing clean hydrogen is one of the utilization methods of biomass energy, which has recently attracted wide attention from scholars [4–6]. Hydrogen production by supercritical water gasification (SCWG) uses the unique physical and chemical properties of supercritical water such as high solubility and diffusion [7,8], and can convert organic matter into hydrogen-rich gas at a lower temperature, and the generated carbon dioxide is directly enriched. Thereby, SCWG can cleanly convert biomass or coal into hydrogen energy and reduce carbon emissions, which has a potential application value. Scientists have used supercritical water to conduct gasification research on chicken manure [9,10], papermaking black liquor [11,12], seaweed [13], food waste [14] and other biomass, which have proved that hydrogen production by SCWG has the advantages of high efficiency and cleanliness, and it is expected to gain scale application in the future. Indole is a key intermediate product in the process of thermal conversion and utilization of biomass, especially high‑nitrogen biomass. Therefore, it is often used as a model compound by researchers to study the conversion mechanism of high nitrogen-containing biomass [15]. Luo et al. [16] studied the hydrodenitrogenation reaction of indole under hydrothermal conditions and found that a precious metal catalyst supported on a porous solid could promote the conversion of indole to hydrocarbons. Guo's team had conducted a series of studies on the conversion of indole in supercritical water, and had obtained important results especially in catalytic gasification and reaction kinetics. They studied the reaction process of indole in a quartz tube reactor, and obtained carbon gasification efficiency of 20% and hydrogenation efficiency of 79% at 700 °C and 20 min residence time [17]. They proposed a reaction network and established a non-catalytic kinetic model of indole conversion to predict the effect of gasification [18]. They also studied the catalytic effect of metal catalysts in a 316 stainless steel reactor and found that the highest carbon gasification efficiency at 500 °C was only 13.9 ± 3.7% [19]. These results are sufficient to prove the structural stability of indole, and its cracking is one of the key rate control steps in the process of biomass thermochemical conversion. Therefore, studying the conversion mechanism of indole in supercritical hydrothermal environment has profound significance for improving the efficiency of biomass gasification and proposing nitrogen control methods. We has conducted experimental and kinetic studies on the hydrogen production by SCWG of indole [20]. The work obtained the high-efficiency gasification of indole under the catalysis of alkali catalysts, and proposed a lumped reaction kinetics model based on the measured intermediate products, which has achieved good prediction results. The harsh parameters of the supercritical water environment have brought difficulties to experimental measurement and sampling. Although experimental analysis methods are sufficiently advanced today, it is not easy to comprehensively observe the changing laws of substances in supercritical water. Fortunately, the rapid development of computer science and quantum theory has allowed us to obtain molecular trajectories and atomic migration paths in supercritical water at the microscopic level [21–24]. Li et al. [25] used the Reaxff method to study the oxidation process of hydrogen in a supercritical H2O/CO2 mixture, which was helpful to develop a continuous-scale kinetic model to accurately predict the behavior of hydrogen oxidation in supercritical systems. Jin et al. [26] studied the dissolution process of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in supercritical water to provide a theoretical basis for inhibiting the coking of organic matter in supercritical water and ensuring the efficiency of gasification. They also studied the process of supercritical water gasification of coal model compound anthracene and biomass model compound furfural to reveal the hydrogen production mechanism enhanced by supercritical water [27–29]. Han et al. [30] used the Reaxff method to study the gasification process of naphthalene in supercritical water with iron oxide catalyst, and found that the synergistic effect of iron oxide catalyst and supercritical water significantly promoted the degradation of napththalene and the generation of H2 and CO, and proved that the Reaxff method was helpful to a deeper understanding of complex SCWG catalytic reactions. Previously, molecular dynamics studies under indole pyrolysis conditions have been reported in the literature. Laskin et al. [31] used a combination of experiments and molecular dynamics to study the pyrolysis process of indole, but the reaction mechanism was still unclear at the quantum level. Zhou et al. [32] used density functional theory to explore the pyrolysis mechanism of indole, especially the indole ring-opening reaction mechanism. It was found that the structure of benzene was more stable than that of pyrrole. Liu et al. [33] studied the conversion mechanism of indole under pyrolysis conditions, and proposed seven reaction pathways including hydrogen transfer reaction and homocracking reaction. They found that HCN and NH3 could be generated, and the pathway to generate HCN had a lower activation energy and was easier to generate. These studies are all carried out under anhydrous conditions, and there are few reports on molecular dynamics studies of indole conversion in supercritical water. The physical and chemical conditions of supercritical water are very different from pyrolysis. Supercritical water has an important influence on the indole conversion, especially the migration mechanism of nitrogen. Based on the previous work, this paper adopted the Reaxff method to study the molecular dynamics simulation of indole gasification in supercritical water. The aim is to visually present the molecular change process from the micro level, clarify the migration mechanism of nitrogen atoms in supercritical water, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent regulation of nitrogen."
1,Computation method,"The calculations in this work were carried out in Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) software supplied by SCM Inc. The Reaxff method was applied for the calculation of chemical reactions in this work. Five system cases of different reaction conditions were designed for comparisons, and the parameters are shown in Table 1 . The partial pressure of water in the case 2 to case 5 should be above 23 MPa to ensure that these cases were in supercritical state. A cubic simulation cell was constructed by the software for each case. The molecular models of indole and water were taken from the ADF database and added to the cubic cell randomly. The carbon and nitrogen atoms were numbered as shown in Fig. 1 to distinguish CC bonds and CN bonds. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions in order to eliminate possible surface effects. Limited by the simulation time, scholars usually choose a high temperature, which is much higher than the experimental one [34,35]. Goddard et.al [36] investigated the difference between experimental and simulation temperatures of pyrolysis of lignite and had proved that increasing the temperature would change the distribution of reaction products while accelerating the reaction rate, but would not change the reaction paths. Therefore, the temperature used in this paper was set to 3000 K, 3500 K and 4000 K in order to observe the reaction process in a short calculable time. Before the Reaxff MD simulation calculation, we relaxed each system to eliminate the initial remaining bad contacts. First, we increased the system temperature from 0 K to 300 K at a rate of 30 K/ps, and then relaxed the simulation cell at 300 K for 20 ps. Subsequently, the equilibrated system was heated to the setting temperature at a heating rate of 100 K/ps. Then, the simulation would last 1000 ps at the setting temperature to collect product distribution and reaction pathways. The time step of the simulation was 0.25 fs, and the temperature was controlled by a Berendsen thermostat with a damping constant of 100 fs. In all calculations, the typical NVT ensemble was adopted. The changes of the cubic cell before and after the simulation are shown in Fig. 2 ."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Nitrogen migration pathway in supercritical water,"3.1 Nitrogen migration pathway in supercritical water According to the opening way of pyrrole ring and the interaction between ring-opening product and the free radicals in supercritical water, the path network of nitrogen migration could be summarized by tracing the transition path of the nitrogen atoms. The path network are shown in Fig. 3 . In the path a, the C(8)-N(1) bond was broken and the pyrrole ring was opened after indole molecule was heated. At this time, the nitrogen atom had spare electrons and was not paired. It was more active and vulnerable to the free radicals in supercritical water. And then the nitrogen atom broke away from the main structure to form radical groups such as NH2, which would generate NH3 subsequently. Meanwhile the main carbon skeleton obtained hydrogen radicals or hydroxyl radicals to generate hydrocarbons or alcohols, which would further broken and gasified into gas products. In the path b, the C(2)-N(1) bond was broken and the pyrrole ring was opened after indole molecule was heated. The nitrogen atom remained on the benzene ring. Similarly, the nitrogen atom was removed from the benzene ring after being attacked by free radicals in supercritical water. The nitrogen atom left away from the benzene ring to form precursor radicals such as NH2, and then generated ammonia. The main carbon skeleton obtained hydrogen radicals or hydroxyl radicals to generate hydrocarbons or phenols, which would further be cleaved and gasified into gas products. Our previous experimental studies have shown that aniline and phenol were important intermediates in the SCWG of indole [20], which was consistent with the results of molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that molecular simulations are reasonable. In addition to these two main paths, the benzene ring in a small amount of structures opened to form a long carbon chain containing the nitrogen atom after the pyrrole ring was opened. This structure was gradually cleaved into several short chains through pyrolysis or reaction with supercritical water, among which HCN was one of the product. Nitriles were considered to be the precursors of ammonia in the thermal transformation of nitrogen under SCW condition [37]. We have also traced the path of nitrogen atoms under pyrolysis conditions. Unlike multiple paths in supercritical water, the pyrrole ring and benzene ring of indole opened in turn under pyrolysis conditions, and then gradually broken into a chain with CN bond. And then HCN becomes the main nitrogen-containing product. Regarding the difference between the two phenomena, we discussed and analyzed further below. In general, most of the nitrogen atoms left the main carbon skeleton after indole opened the pyrrole ring in supercritical water."
4,Bond cracking energy of pyrrole ring opening,"3.2 Bond cracking energy of pyrrole ring opening The molecular reaction path above showed that the first step of indole gasification in supercritical water was the ring-opening reaction of the pyrrole ring. Early studies had mentioned that hydrogen transfer reaction and isomerization could destroy the stability of the pyrrole ring of indole to facilitate subsequent reactions [31,33,38].Tracking the migration of nitrogen atoms during the opening of the pyrrole ring and analyzing the energy barrier of the bond cracking would help us to determine the dominant reaction path in SCW, thereby deepening the understanding of the mechanism of nitrogen migration. We have found two main ring-opening ways, path a and path b，which matched the two main reaction paths in section 3.1. Furthermore, there were two cases in the path b. We defined them as path b-1 and path b-2. The transition states of each way were searched by ADF software using DFT method. The energy trend was calculated under the condition of 250 atm and 800 K and was shown in Fig. 4 . The path a of the ring-opening was as follows: when the indole molecule was heated and vibrated violently, the hydrogen atom connected to the nitrogen atom was transferred to the carbon atom C(8) on the benzene ring and then C(8)-N(1) bond was broken. A more stable product containing CN triple bond was obtained. This process had gone through two transition states. They were transition state of the hydrogen atom transfer and the C(8)-N(1) bond cracking. The activation energies of the two transition states were 215.90 kJ/mol and 149.55 kJ/mol, respectively. The overall activation energy of this path was 316.38 kJ/mol. It was obviously that the hydrogen atom transfer reaction was the control step in the way. The path b-1 of ring-opening was that the hydrogen atom connected to the nitrogen atom was transferred to the carbon atom C(2) connected to the nitrogen atom on the pyrrole ring when indole molecule was heated and vibrated strongly, and then the C(2)-N(1) bond fractured. The nitrogen atom was left on the benzene ring, and a relatively stable aniline precursor was obtained. This process also experienced two transition states, one was the hydrogen atom transfer, and the other was the C(2)-N(1) bond break. The activation energies of the two transition states were 200.58 kJ/mol and 237.36 kJ/mol, respectively. The overall activation energy of this way was 354.70 kJ/mol. The reaction of C(2)-N(1) bond cracking was the control step of the way. The path b-2 of ring-opening was that the indole molecule vibrated fiercely after being heated, and the C(2)-N(1) bond cracked directly. This process had only one transition state, and its activation energy was 439.95 kJ/mol. The path a had a lowest overall activation energy comparing with the other two paths. Thus the path a may be the dominate process for indole opening its pyrrole ring from the view of activation energy. However, the activation energy of the first transition state in path b-1 was lower than that of path a, and the intermediate energy of path b-1 was also relatively low. That was to say, path a and b-1 may be rival, which resulted in some indole molecules would follow path b-1. In previous experiments [20], large quantities of aniline intermediates had shown that partial indoles opened the pyrrole ring along the path b-1, leaving nitrogen atoms temporarily on the benzene ring. So it turns out that the path b-1 was also a critical path."
5,Effect of SCW on indole conversion,"3.3 Effect of SCW on indole conversion Containing a large number of supercritical water molecules was the difference between SCWG and pyrolysis process. In order to compare the effects of the two process on the conversion of indole, cases with different numbers of supercritical water molecules were calculated and simulated. Here, 0 water molecule represented the pyrolysis process. Fig. 5(a) shows the effect of the number of supercritical water molecules on indole consumption. It can be seen that indole molecules of the three cases were consumed within 125 ps. The main difference was that the more supercritical water molecules, the faster the indole molecules was consumed. Under pyrolysis conditions, the consumption rate of indole was slower and fluctuated more. Under supercritical water conditions, when there were 500 water molecules, the indole skeleton structures basically disappeared within 50 ps. And when there were 1000 water molecules, the indole skeleton structures disappeared faster, and the number decreased to less 10 at about 25 ps. The presence of supercritical water greatly promoted the decomposition of the indole skeleton structures. Fig. 5(b) shows the effect of the number of supercritical water molecules on hydrogen generation. With the increase of time, the hydrogen production amount were relatively stable within a certain range. Under pyrolysis conditions, the output of hydrogen molecules was less than 20. When the number of supercritical water molecules was increased from 0 to 500, the output of hydrogen molecules was greatly increased to about 100. When the number of supercritical water molecules increased to 1000, the hydrogen molecules amount reached about 180. Supercritical water significantly promoted the generation of hydrogen because it provided a large number of hydrogen radical clusters, which combined with each other to form hydrogen [28,29]. Fig. 5(c) shows the effect of the number of supercritical water molecules on the production of intermediate HCN. The number of HCN molecules had an obvious process that it grew first and then decreased with the increase of time. Especially under pyrolysis conditions, the number of HCN molecules increased significantly in the first 100 ps, and then gradually decreased and equilibrated. As increasing the number of supercritical water molecules from 500 to 1000, the level of HCN molecules did not change significantly. However, the level was obviously less when supercritical water molecules existed than that in pyrolysis conditions. Fig. 5(d) shows the effect of the number of supercritical water molecules on the yield of NH3 molecules. Under pyrolysis conditions, the yield of NH3 molecules fluctuated greatly. As the number of supercritical water molecules increased from 500 to 1000, the level of NH3 molecules did not change obviously, but was significantly more than that under pyrolysis conditions, and tend to be equilibrated with the increase of time. The above reaction path and the data analysis in Fig. 5(c) and (d) uncovered the mechanism. On the one hand, the presence of supercritical water promoted the rapid and direct separation of nitrogen atoms from the carbon skeleton after indole opened its pyrrole ring, and inhibited the formation of HCN. On the other hand, the presence of supercritical water promoted the break of CN bonds, which in turn facilitated the conversion of HCN to NH3. We counted the nitrogen atom distribution under the three cases in order to better observe the effect of the number of water molecules on nitrogen migration. The average numbers of nitrogen-containing molecules at stable status (400–1000 ps) are shown in Fig. 5(e). With the increase of the number of water molecules, the number of inorganic nitrogen increased gradually, and the small carbon chain structure (C1-C2) containing nitrogen atoms decreased gradually. The inorganic nitrogen here was mainly ammonia, amino or various precursors of ammonia. However, in the absence of water molecules at pyrolysis condition, nitrogen atoms not only existed in inorganic structures and small carbon chain structures, but also existed in the small amounts of longer carbon chain structures (C3-C8 or more than C8). These results showed that the presence of supercritical water molecules can promote the formation of nitrogen atoms from organic structures into inorganic forms and effectively inhibit the formation of tar or coke."
6,Effect of temperature on indole conversion,"3.4 Effect of temperature on indole conversion Temperature is a key factor affecting the reaction rate from the perspective of reaction kinetics. Fig. 6 shows the effect of temperature on the SCWG of indole. The evolution of the number of indole molecules over time at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 6(a). At these three temperatures, the number of indole molecules decreased rapidly. At 3500 K and 4000 K, the indole molecules basically disappeared at 90 ps and 70 ps, respectively. At 3000 K, after decreased rapidly in the first 100 ps, the number of indole molecules oscillated repeatedly and disappeared completely when it approached 400 ps. This indicated that at lower temperature, the indole molecular skeleton was not easy to crack, and very few structures continued to isomerize in the late stage of the reaction until they finally disappeared. While higher temperature promoted the cleavage of the indole molecular skeleton more obviously. Fig. 6(b) and (c) respectively show the effect of temperature on the numbers of water and hydrogen molecules. The evolution of the number of supercritical water molecules and the number of hydrogen molecules over time at the three different temperatures was basically consistent with the law of indole consumption. The number of supercritical water molecules decreased rapidly in the first 100 ps and then tended to equilibrate. Conversely, the number of hydrogen molecules increased rapidly in the first 100 ps and then tended to balance. The higher temperature, the more water molecules were consumed and the more hydrogen was produced, which were consistent with the experimental results [30]. Fig. 6(d) shows the variation of number of HCN molecules with temperature. Higher temperature resulted in a larger number of HCN molecules, but the difference in the number level was not obvious at different temperatures. The possible reason may be that more nitrogen atoms were directly separated from the skeleton after indole ring-opening under supercritical water conditions instead of forming HCN. Thus temperature had little effect on the number of HCN molecules. The evolution of NH3 molecules over time at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 6(e). The number of NH3 molecules at the three temperatures gradually increased with time and then tended to equilibrate. In the first 70 ps of the reaction, higher temperature also resulted in the larger number of NH3 molecules. Conversely, in the middle and late stages of the reaction, the higher temperature, the less number of NH3 molecules was. Based on the analysis of the distribution of nitrogen atoms at different temperatures as shown in Fig. 6(f), it can be seen that in the later stable stages of the reaction, inorganic structures were relatively less at higher temperatures, while small nitrogen-containing carbon chain structures were more. This indicated that a part of nitrogen atoms entered the small carbon chain structure from the inorganic nitrogen structure at high temperature. The reason may be that molecular motion rate was faster and the probability of collision between nitrogen-containing groups and carbon chains was higher under the conditions of reactants with the same molecular composition. All these led to the reduction of inorganic nitrogen at high temperature. This also indicated that the higher temperature could enhance the higher possibility of char formation in SCWG of indole."
7,Conclusion,"As a model compound containing nitrogen of biomass, indole was used to study the mechanism of nitrogen migration during supercritical water gasification. Reaxff combined with DFT method was used to investigate the migration network and ring-opening energy barrier of nitrogen atoms in supercritical water. The conversion characteristics of indole affected by SCW molecules and temperatures were also investigated. This study revealed the mechanism from the view of microscopic atoms, and provided theoretical support for the nitrogen regulation in supercritical water gasification of coal or biomass. The research specific conclusions are as follows: (1). Nitrogen migration network of indole in SCW was tracked and proposed. The pyrrole ring cracking was the first stage of indole conversion in SCW. And then most of the nitrogen atoms left the carbon skeleton to form ammonia precursor radicals after being attacked by H or OH free radicals in supercritical water. (2). Bond cracking energy of pyrrole ring opening was calculated. The overall activation energy of pyrrole ring opening in path a was 316.38 kJ/mol, which was lowest among the two main paths. Thus the path a was considered as the dominant path for pyrrole ring opening of indole. The path b-1 had a competitive relationship with the path a by comparing the activation energies of transition states and relative energies of intermediates. (3). The number of supercritical water molecules had a profound effect on the conversion of indole. Compared with pyrolysis conditions, supercritical water molecules greatly promoted the separation of nitrogen atoms from the carbon skeleton to form NH3 and inhibited the formation of HCN. (4). Higher temperature was conducive to the conversion of indole and the generation of hydrogen, but it also increased the possibility of coking, causing part of the nitrogen to re-enter the organic structure."
