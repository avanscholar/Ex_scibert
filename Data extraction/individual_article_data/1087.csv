0,Introduction,"In agriculture, urea fertilizers have been widely used as nitrogen supplements for plant growth because of their low costs and rich nitrogen contents (up to 46 weight percent Beig et al., 2020; Dimkpa et al., 2020). However, a large amount of urea fertilizer is lost through decomposition, ammonium volatilization, denitrification, and leaching upon the application in soil (Ransom et al., 2019; Ramli, 2019); eventually resulting in the increased usage of fertilizers and serious environmental pollution. The use of slow-release fertilizers (SRFs) is a manner for improving fertilizer use efficiency, minimization of environmental impacts, lowering of application frequency, and meeting the nitrogen requirement of plants (Liu et al., 2019; Azeem et al., 2014). Practically, SRFs are produced by coating or encapsulating conventional soluble fertilizers with water-insoluble and porous membranes, which control water penetration and nutrient dissolution rate (Gil-Ortiz et al., 2020; Qiao et al., 2016; Charoenchai et al., 2020). Moreover, several coating materials have been proposed for SRF encapsulation, including non-degradable polymers (polysulfone (Tomaszewska and Jarosiewicz, 2006; Li et al., 2012), polyacrylonitrile (Jyothi et al., 2018), polyurethane (Wang et al., 2019), polystyrene (Yang et al., 2012), and biodegradable polymers (chitosan (CS) Araújo et al., 2017; Jamnongkan and Kaewpirom, 2010), lignin (Pang et al., 2018), cellulose (Zhang et al., 2020), and starch (Li et al., 2014)). The rate of SRF release strongly depends on the thickness and the number of coating layers. Additionally, the characteristics of coating materials, such as porosity and hydrophilic property, also affect the release behavior of SRF. For instance, the nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK) fertilizer granules sequentially coated by three layers of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), cross-linked CS, and poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) could release 84 ± 18%, 63 ± 12%, and 36 ± 15% of N, P, and K components, respectively, for 30 days in water (Noppakundilograt et al., 2015). A double-coated SRF prepared by using microcrystalline wax and marine polysaccharide derivatives (calcium alginate and CS-glutaraldehyde copolymer) released less than 75% of N component after 28 days and met the European Standard for SRFs. Hence, the SRFs prepared by coating method give a long-term release of nutrients; though, the complexity of processing prevents industrial-scale production. Another type of SRFs is the matrix-type formulation, in which nutrients are dispersed in matrices made from polymers (Iftime et al., 2019; Lum et al., 2013) or inorganic materials (Hermida and Agustian, 2019). Hydrogel-based SRFs (gel-based SRFs) are the matrix-type formulation, which are mixtures of natural and/or synthetic hydrophilic polymers and conventional fertilizers. Gel-based SRFs can absorb water and retain moisture in soil simultaneously. Gel-based SRFs are mainly prepared through the following methods: (1) In the two-step method, the hydrogel is synthesized by polymerization techniques and dried. The dried hydrogel is immersed in fertilizer solutions. The fertilizer-absorbed hydrogel is dried once again, and (2) In the in situ method, the polymerization reaction is conducted in the presence of fertilizer, which is eventually dispersed in a hydrogel matrix. From a technological perspective, the in situ method requires only one step, resulting in lower cost and less time-consuming. However, the reaction must be strictly controlled to adjust the hydrogel structure for fertilizer release. Based on the in situ method, urea was embedded in starch-based superabsorbent polymers (SBSAPs) by adding urea to starch’s chemical modification (Xiao et al., 2017). Urea contents in the SBSAPs can reach fourfold the content of starch, and the slow release of urea in water lasted for more than 45 days. As such, this research proposes a simple and cost-effective technology for producing SRFs based on a functional polymer. On the other hand, CS is a natural polysaccharide, which has been commonly used in hydrogel form for controlling the release of active components applied in food, drug, and agricultural areas (El-Mekawy et al., 2020; Giri et al., 2012; Jamnongkan and Kaewpirom, 2010). To improve the water absorbency and mechanical performance at gel state, CS is blended with other hydrophilic polymers, such as poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Yang et al., 2018; Noppakundilograt et al., 2015). Both CS and PVA have biodegradability and functional groups that can react with many reagents to modify hydrogel’s structure for controlled release applications. It is worth noting that there remains huge room for studying the development of fertilizer formulation which bears characteristics of slow-release. Thus, this research aims to provide a simple method to produce a nitrogen slow-release fertilizer based on environmentally friendly compositions: CS and PVA. In situ hydrogelation was conducted by forming a cross-link between CS and PVA molecules by a glutaraldehyde agent in the presence of urea, targeting the fine dispersion of urea into hydrogels and control of urea release. The influence of the cross-linking agents’ composition (in the range of 4.1 and 12.1 weight percent) and urea (in the range of 40 and 60 weight percent) on release profile was studied. The morphology and structure of the fertilizer formulation were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The release behavior and kinetics of urea from the formulations prepared with different contents of urea and cross-linking agent were examined. Based on the above analysis methods, this study revealed the interaction between urea molecules and CS/PVA hydrogel structure and the influence of CS/PVA hydrogel structure on urea release behavior, which has not yet been mentioned in other previous researches."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials CS (deacetylation degree: 90%, M w = 690 ,000 g/mol) was supplied by Biomaterials Co. (Korea). Glutaraldehyde 25% aqueous solution (w/w) and acetic acid (glacial 99.5%) were purchased from Samchun Co. (Korea). PVA (KURARAY POLVAL™ PVA-205) with a hydrolysis degree in the range of 86.5 and 89.0 mole percent was purchased from Singapore. Commercial urea granule (N ≥ 46.3%) was supplied by Phu My Fertilizer Plant, Vietnam. Double-distilled water was used in all experiments."
3,Preparation of urea/CS/PVA formulation,"2.2 Preparation of urea/CS/PVA formulation A 4 wt% CS solution was obtained by dissolving 0.8 g of CS into a mixture of 17 g of deionized water and 2.2 g of acetic acid under vigorous stirring for 4 h at 50°C. Then, 2.5 g of PVA was added to the chitosan solution under continuous stirring for 2 h at 50°C for the production of a transparent and yellowish solution. The CS/PVA blended solution was cooled to room temperature. Different amounts of urea powder were added to the CS/PVA blended solution, which was then subjected to mechanical agitation for 2 h. Subsequently, different volumes of glutaraldehyde were added dropwise for the production of different hydrogel formulations. The formulations were dark yellow when the amount of glutaraldehyde increased from 2.0 mL to 3.2 mL and the amount of urea decreased from 6.570 g to 4.725 and 2.880 g. Next, the formulations were dried in an oven at 50°C until a constant weight was attained. The CS/PVA hydrogel was prepared by the above process without the addition of urea powder. The CS/PVA hydrogels and urea/CS/PVA formulations were prepared with different urea and glutaraldehyde compositions, as shown in Table 1."
4,Characterization of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"2.3 Characterization of urea/CS/PVA formulations The formation of the cross-linked structure of the CS/PVA hydrogel and the interaction between urea and the hydrogel structure were investigated using FTIR spectra recorded with an FTIR spectrophotometer (NEXUS 670 from Nicolet). The FTIR analysis was conducted by the transmission method in the wavelength range of 800 and 4000 cm −1. The surface morphology of the urea/CS/PVA formulations was investigated by a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6510LV) with a magnification of 1000. The thermal properties of the urea/CS/PVA formulations, including the melting point and latent heat, were measured with a differential scanning calorimeter (NETZSCH DSC204 F1 Phoenix) in a temperature range of 30–180°C. Analyses were carried out at a 10 o /min heating rate under a constant stream of nitrogen and a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The weight percentage of urea in urea/CS/PVA formulations (% wt etp ) was calculated according to the ratio between the enthalpy value of urea/CS/PVA formulations and that of urea as follows: (1) % wt etp = Δ H urea ∕ CS ∕ PVA Δ H urea × 100 where Δ H ure∕CS∕PVA and Δ urea are the measured enthalpies of the urea/CS/PVA formulations and urea when they are melting, respectively. % wt th was the weight percentage of urea in the urea/CS/PVA formulations calculated based on the solid composition used in preparing the formulations. Then, the encapsulation efficiency of urea in the urea/CS/PVA formulations has been calculated using the below formula: (2) Encapsulation efficiency EE % = % wt etp % wt th × 100 The thermal decomposition of the urea/CS/PVA formulations was examined through TGA. The samples were subjected to a thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH TGA209 F1 Phoneix) under a nitrogen atmosphere and at a heating rate of 10 o /min from 30°C to 800°C. The water absorbency (WA) of the urea/CS/PVA formulations was determined through the gravimetric method. The same amount of U4.7/CP/G2.0 and U4.7/CP/G3.2 formulations were immersed into 50 mL of distilled water. At each time interval, water was removed, and swollen samples were collected for weighting. The water absorbency of urea/CS/PVA formulations was calculated using the following equation (Iftime et al., 2019): (3) W A = W S − W d W d × 100 where W d and W s are the weights of the samples in dried and swollen state at different time intervals, respectively. The experiment of water absorbency was repeated three times."
5,In vitro release study of urea from urea/CS/PVA formulations,"2.4 In vitro release study of urea from urea/CS/PVA formulations Release experiments were carried out in static mode in distilled water at room temperature (25 o C) as follows: 0.5 g of each urea/CS/PVA formulation was added into a bottle containing 40 mL of distilled water. At certain times, the bottle was shaken, and 10 mL of supernatant was withdrawn from the bottle and replaced with 10 mL of distilled water. This procedure was repeated once per day for 11 days. The pH value of the supernatant varied between 8.0 and 8.8 during the release experiment. The concentration of released urea at each time interval was determined according to the ammonium concentration in the supernatant because of the hydrolysis and ammonification of urea into ammonium (NH 4 + ) (Elbarbary and Mo, 2017). Ammonium concentration was measured through calorimetric determination with an ammonium high-range colorimeter (HI7310 Hanna Checker). The test is based Nessler method, in which the reaction between ammonium and regents (K 2 HgI 4) in a base medium produces a yellow sample. The optical density of the yellow color formed was measured spectrophotometrically at 470 nm. The instrument displayed the results in mg/L of ammonium ion. The samples were diluted to acquire NH 4 + concentration in a range of 0–99.9 mg/L before measurement. The experiment of release test was repeated three times for each formulation. Because the total amount of nitrogen released from the fertilizer formulation did not be measured, the amount of NH 4 + cumulative release was calculated instead of its percentage. The mechanisms of urea release from the urea/CS/PVA formulations were evaluated under the same physiological conditions. Four mathematical models were employed for the examination of urea release kinetics, which is are described below (Baishya, 2017): (4) First - order model : d C ∕ d t = − K 1 C where C is the amount of urea release and K 1 is the first-order rate constant, expressed in time −1. (5) Higuchi model : Q t = K H t 1∕2 where Q t is the amount of urea released at time t and K H is the Higuchi dissolution constant. (6) Hixson - Crowell model : Q o 1∕3 − Q t 1∕3 = K HC t where Q o is the initial amount of urea in the hydrogels, Q t is the remaining amount of urea in the hydrogels at time t, and K HC is the Hixson–Crowell constant. (7) Korsmeyer - peppas model : M t ∕ M ∞ = K kp t n where M t is the amount of urea released at time t, M ∞ is the amount of urea released after time ∞ , n is the diffusional exponent, and K kp is the Korsmeyer release rate constant."
6,Statistical analysis,2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA in Excel. Significant differences between formulations were analyzed using multiple comparison test and p-values ¡ 0.05 were statistically significant. Error bars represent standard deviations.
7,Results and discussion,
8,Chemical characterization of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"3.1 Chemical characterization of urea/CS/PVA formulations The FTIR spectra of CS/PVA hydrogel and urea/CS/PVA formulations were recorded and used in examining the formation of hydrogel structures and the interaction of urea with CS and PVA in the hydrogel structures. In the infrared absorption spectrum of the cross-linked CS/PVA hydrogel (Fig. 1A), intense broadband at 3311 cm −1 appeared because of the overlapping stretching of OH and NH groups and intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. Absorption bands at 2940 and 1411 cm −1 were assigned to aliphatic CH2 stretching and CH3 symmetrical deformation, respectively. The peaks at 1713 and 1374 cm −1 are related to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CO groups, which are attributed to the residual vinyl acetate repeat units of PVA and the residual acetyl groups in the CS. Characteristic peaks of CS/PVA hydrogel were found at 1650 cm −1 and 1563 cm −1 corresponding to the C=O vibration of the amide I group and N–H bending vibration of the amine group, respectively. It is difficult to determine the imine bond (CN) formed by the reaction between amino groups of CS and aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde due to the overlap of the absorption band of the amide I group at 1650 cm −1. An observed peak at 1249 cm −1 was attributed to C–O–C groups and indicated the formation of acetal bridges through the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde. These results showed that the reaction of glutaraldehyde with CS and PVA occurred and formed a cross-linked CS/PVA hydrogel structure (Bahrami et al., 2003). The peak at 1025 cm −1 was attributed to C–O stretching in CS and PVA molecules. Fig. 1c, d, e shows the FTIR spectra of the urea/CS/PVA formulations, which were cross-linked by glutaraldehyde. The stretching of N–H and O–H bonds separately appeared at 3429 and 3335 cm −1, respectively, and were attributed to the appearance of urea in the formulation. Moreover, the intensities of the absorption bands characterized for CH2 and COC groups at 2940 and 1266 cm −1, respectively, significantly decreased, indicating the dominant urea content in the hydrogels. The absorption bands at 1650 cm −1 and 1563 cm , − 1 respectively characterized by CO and NH bonds in CS/PVA hydrogel (Fig. 1b), disappeared in the FTIR spectrum of urea/CS/PVA formulations. Instead, there are appearances of CO (amide I group) and NH vibrations of urea molecules at 1675 cm −1 and 1589 cm −1, respectively. Moreover, it could not observe the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CO bond in acetate groups at 1713 and 1374 cm −1 in the FTIR spectrum of urea/CS/PVA formulations. Therefore, these analyses suggest the existence of an interaction between urea and the CS/PVA structure. Hydrogen bond may have formed between the H atoms of urea and the O atoms of the amide groups and acetyl groups of CS and PVA molecules, respectively (Sagle et al., 2009), as illustrated in Fig. 2."
9,Morphology of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"3.2 Morphology of urea/CS/PVA formulations The morphology of the CS/PVA hydrogel, urea, and urea/CS/PVA formulations was observed by SEM (Fig. 3), which represented the correlation between the morphology of urea/CS/PVA and the contents of cross-linking agent (Fig. 3c, d, e) and urea (Fig. 3e, f, g). The SEM image of the cross-linked CS/PVA hydrogel (Fig. 3a) showed a smooth surface and dense structure without interconnected pores. Incorporating urea in the cross-linked CS/PVA hydrogels resulted in different surface morphology depending on the contents of the cross-linking agent and urea. At a low cross-linking agent content (1.0 mL), the surface of the formulation showed homogeneous wrinkling, which was caused by the interaction between urea and the polymers. The increase in the content of the cross-linking agent led to the appearance of agglomerates, which were urea crystals embedded on the surface of the formulation. They had lamellar morphology when the content of the cross-linking agent was 3.2 mL, meanwhile, the urea precursor was polygon blocks (Fig. 3e). Fig. 3c, d, and e provide obvious evidence of the correlation between the degree of cross-linking and the morphology of the formulations. In fact, a high degree of cross-linking promoted the formation of tight cross-linked structures between CS and PVA molecules (Iftime et al., 2019). Consequently, the spaces inside the hydrogel structures shrank and pushed urea crystals out through their surfaces. When urea content increased, the amount of urea on the surfaces of the hydrogels increased, and the morphology of urea crystals changed from a lamellar shape to a needle shape because of the influence of polymer chains in the growth of the urea phase. The urea component dispersed in the solution of the CS and PVA blend in the mixing step, and then a portion of urea was incorporated in the cross-linked CS/PVA structure. The remaining urea was exposed to the surfaces of the formulations after the drying step. The correlation between morphology and cross-linking degree and the content of urea was also reported for soil conditioner systems obtained by in situ hydrogelation of chitosan with salicylaldehyde in the presence of urea (Iftime et al., 2019). The high cross-linking degree gave a denser structure, while the low cross-linking degree showed a porous morphology. Their study confirmed the presence of urea crystals for the sample with the high and low cross-linking degree and their absence for those with medium cross-linking density."
10,Thermal properties of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"3.3 Thermal properties of urea/CS/PVA formulations To investigate the effect of urea content on hydrogel structure and calculation of the exact percentage of urea incorporated into the urea/CS/PVA formulations, the thermal properties of urea/CS/PVA formulations containing different contents of urea were measured through DSC. The DSC thermogram of urea and the urea/CS/PVA formulations are shown in Fig. 4. The melting points and enthalpy of the urea/CS/PVA formulations and the weight percentage of urea incorporated into the formulations are listed in Table 2. The DSC thermogram of urea showed a sharp melting peak at 136.96 °C, whereas that of urea/CS/PVA formulations showed broad peaks, indicating the shielding effect of the hydrogel structures on the melting behavior of urea. This phenomenon might be the consequence of the hydrogen bonding between urea and polymer molecules as confirmed by FTIR. The melting point of urea/CS/PVA formulations significantly increased as urea content decreased. At a low urea content, urea crystals were almost locked up in the space between cross-linked polymers, which prevented the melting of urea and resulted in a high melting point. Meanwhile, the quantity of urea crystals embedded on the hydrogel surface increased with urea content in urea/CS/PVA formulation. Thus the crystals easily melted in the same manner as they did at lower melting points. The enthalpy and percentage of urea incorporated in the hydrogels gradually increased in U2.8/CP/G3.2, U4.7/CP/G3.2, and U6.5/CP/G3.2. However, the percentage of urea calculated from DSC data (% wt etp) was lower than that of urea according to the composition of solid precursors (% wt th ). This result might be due to the condensation reaction between urea and glutaraldehyde and the decomposition of urea during the preparation process, especially in the blending and drying steps. The slow-release fertilizer with a higher urea content has been obtained by a coating method, in which urea granule was core (55% w/w) with ethyl cellulose (10%) as the inner shell and starch-based superabsorbent polymer (35%) as the outer shell (Qiao et al., 2016). Some slow-release nitrogen fertilizers prepared by in situ polymerization method had a lower urea content. For instance, fertilizer formulation which was prepared by inverse suspension polymerization of acrylic acid had urea content of 50% (w/w) (Liu et al., 2007), compared to a maximum of 30% (w/w) found in fertilizers based on acrylamide and acrylic hydrogels (Helaly et al., 2005). To investigate the effect of urea on the thermal degradation of urea/CS/PVA formulation, CS/PVA hydrogel and U6.5/CP/G2.0 formulation were analyzed by a TGA. TGA thermogram and a summary of the degradation temperatures and weight loss percentages of the samples are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3, respectively. Fig. 5 indicates that the U0.0/CP/G2.0 formulation underwent degradation in two steps, and U6.5/CP/G2.0 formulation had four degradation steps. The first step was attributed to the evaporation of water and glutaraldehyde residual in the structures of the hydrogels. The weight of the U0.0/CP/G2.0 formulation gradually decreased as a function of temperature in a range of 175–580 °C. In the U6.5/CP/G2.0 formulation, weight loss (61.93%) mostly occurred from 150°C to 350°C, which might be the temperature range for thermal degradation of urea and cross-linked PVA and CS molecules. The third degradation stage with a weight loss of 11.70% could be ascribed to the decomposition of remained PVA chain (Noppakundilograt et al., 2015). The CS molecules and other by-products were degraded at the final step in the range of 500–590°C. This result shows that the presence of urea interfered with the intermolecular interactions of PVA and CS and this interference led to different thermal degradation steps."
11,Water absorbency of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"3.4 Water absorbency of urea/CS/PVA formulations The influence of the degree of cross-linking of the urea/CS/PVA formulations on their water absorbency (WA) is provided in Fig. 6. To eliminate the effect of the urea release on the water absorbency, two formulations having the same urea content (U4.7/CP/G2.0 and U4.7/CP/G3.2) were used to test. The urea/CS/PVA formulations immediately swelled when immersed in distilled water and had the highest WA of 120% and 100% for U4.7/CP/G2.0 and U4.7/CP/G3.2, respectively, in the first 20 min. Afterwards, the WA of both formulations gradually decreased, probably because of the dissolution of urea and polymer molecules, which were not cross-linked. Besides, the hydrolysis of the hydrogel structure was also the reason leading to the decrease in WA. Around the first 90 min, the WA of U4.7/CP/G2.0 formulation was higher than that of U4.7/CP/G3.2 hydrogel, demonstrating that a low degree of cross-linking was attributable to a high water absorption capacity (Iftime et al., 2019). This phenomenon caused by the loose cross-linking structure produced more space for the entry of water molecules. As a result, the quantity of urea crystals dissolved and diffused out U4.7/CP/G2.0 formulation increased, leading to the low WA of U4.7/CP/G2.0 formulation compared with that of U4.7/CP/G3.2 formulation after 5 h of immersion in distilled water. Thus, it can be stated that a higher cross-linked degree showed more hydrolytic stability. The WA of prepared CS/PVA hydrogels containing urea was different in comparison with that of other chitosan hydrogels (Jamnongkan and Kaewpirom, 2010; Xiao et al., 2017), because of the difference in cross-linking degree."
12,In vitro release behavior and release kinetics of urea/CS/PVA formulations,"3.5 In vitro release behavior and release kinetics of urea/CS/PVA formulations Fig. 7 represents the amount (mg) of NH 4 + released from the urea/CS/PVA formulations prepared with different contents of cross-linking agent and urea. The influence of cross-linking degree in release behavior of urea/CS/PVA formulations was reflected in Fig. 7a. Both U4.7/CP/G2.0 and U4.7/CP/G3.2 formulations showed a steady release of NH 4 + in distilled water for 10 days. However, the higher release rate was recorded for the samples with a lower cross-linking degree (U4.7/CP/G2.0). Although the urea/CS/PVA formulation with a lower cross-linking degree showed a smaller amount of urea crystal anchored on the surface (SEM data), its swelling ability was higher (WA data) to more susceptibility to dissolution and diffusion of encapsulated urea to the water medium. In opposite, urea encapsulated in U4.7/CP/G3.2 formulation having dense cross-linking structure was difficultly released. Thus its release rate was not significantly changed within 3 initial days. Meanwhile, it was observed that urea powder quickly dissolved in a few minutes when it was added in the water at room temperature in the range of its solubility (1079 g/L at 20 o C). Other chitosan-based fertilizer formulations showed the burst release of urea in the initial stage. Approximately 45% of urea was released from chitosan hydrogels cross-linked with salicylaldehyde in the first 5 h (Iftime et al., 2019) and from chitosan microspheres crosslinked with genipin in the first 2 days (Hussain et al., 2012) . Compared with the cumulative release of NH 4 + of the three urea/CS/PVA formulations containing different urea contents, each sample showed different release behavior (Fig. 7b). The rate of NH 4 + release increased with urea content. Especially, the amount of NH 4 + released from U6.5/CP/G3.2 formulation was more than fourfold and twofold the amount of NH 4 + released from U2.8/CP/G3.2 and U4.7/CP/G3.2 formulations on the first day, respectively. This result might partially attribute to the abundance of urea on the surfaces of the hydrogels when urea content increased. Meanwhile, the concentration of NH 4 + dramatically increased after 3, 4, and 5 days of release for U6.5/CP/G3.2, U4.7/CP/G3.2, and U2.8/CP/G3.2 formulations, respectively. It can be explained that the urea framework covered the functional group of PVA and CS by the formation of hydrogen bonding and retarded the cross-linking reaction. The high content of urea led to a high reduction in the degree of cross-linking, and thus the hydrogel structure easily degraded and the rate of urea release increased. After day 10, the cumulative amount of NH 4 + released from U6.5/CP/G3.2 formulation slightly decreased. In the case of U4.7/CP/G3.2 and U2.8/CP/G3.2 formulations, the cumulative amount of NH 4 + decreased from day 11, suggesting that there was no more urea released from the formulations into the water medium. The morphology of urea/CS/PVA formulations after the release test was observed in Fig. 8. The number and size of the pore that appeared in hydrogels strongly depended on the urea content. U6.5/CP/G3.2 formulation contained a larger number of pores and bigger pore size compared to other formulations. Therefore, this caused the high diffusion of urea through the pores, resulting in the high amount of NH 4 + released. It can be deduced that the release behavior of all the fertilizer formulations was entirely in agreement with the SEM and WA results. Moreover, in the FTIR spectrum of urea/CS/PVA formulation measured after urea release (Fig. 9), the peaks characterized to chemical bonds of urea at 3425, 3335, 1675, 1589, and 1458 cm −1 were disappeared, indicating that urea incorporated in urea/CS/PVA formulation was completely released. The release mechanism of NH 4 + from the formulations prepared with different degree of cross-linking and urea composition was investigated by fitting different mathematical models on the in vitro release profile. The correlation coefficients (R2) for the fitting of the release data with the first order, Hixson–Crowell, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas models are shown in Table 4. The first-order model provided the best fit to the release data of U4.7/CP/G2.0, U4.7/CP/G3.2, and U2.8/CP/G3.2 formulations with R2 value ranging from 0.930 to 0.966. This result indicates that the amount of urea encapsulated into these formulations played an important role in their release rates. Specifically, their release rate was directly proportional to the amount of incorporated urea in the hydrogel matrix. However, the dependence of release rate on the amount of incorporated urea increased when the structure of the cross-linked hydrogels was loose at high content of urea and low content of glutaraldehyde. Based on the R2 value, the order in terms of the increase was U2.8/CP/G3.2< U4.7/CP/G3.2 < U4.7/CP/G2.0. Moreover, owing to loose structures, the experiment data of U4.7/CP/G3.2 and U4.7/CP/G2.0 formulations followed the Hixson–Crowell models, showing that change in surface area during the process of swelling and dissolution had a significant effect on urea release. The Higuchi model showed the best fit to the release data of the U6.5/CP/G3.2 formulation, which had an R2 of 0.9649, indicating the prime mechanism of urea release is diffusion-controlled release (Baishya, 2017). The characteristics of this hydrogel perfectly followed few assumptions made in the Higuchi model: (1) the initial amount of urea in the hydrogel exceeds the solubility in the matrix medium, (2) perfect sink conditions are maintained, in which the concentration of urea into the release medium is high under saturation concentration, (3) the diffusivity of urea is constant, and (4) the swelling of the polymer is negligible because of its loose cross-linked structure. The best fit of the Korsmeyer–Peppas model was obtained by the U6.5/CP/G3.2 formulation, with an exponent n value of 0.916, which implied that the urea release from this formulations followed the Super case II transport. Therefore, the release kinetics might be involved in more than one mechanisms, which are the contribution of polymer relaxation and erosion. The presence of a high amount of urea in the formulation caused the disentanglement of polymer molecules, facilitating relaxation. In summary, the mechanism of urea release from the urea/CS/PVA formulations depended on the contents of urea and the cross-linking agent, which influenced the degree of cross-linking and the entanglement of polymer molecules. When these formulations were immersed in distilled water, the first stage was the dissolution of urea on the surface of hydrogels, accompanied by the swelling of hydrogels and dissolution of urea that was less anchored to the hydrogel matrix. The second stage was the dramatic release of urea because of the disintegration of the hydrogel matrix. The last stage was the diffusion out of urea crystals, which have hydrogen bonding with the functional groups of polymer molecules, through the dynamic exchange with free water. In general, the release behavior of urea/CS/PVA formulations appears to stay the best fit with the Hixson–Crowell based on the correlation coefficient shown in Table 4. Although the above results indicated the urea slow-release behavior of urea/CS/PVA formulations, there are still some existing issues that need further research: (1) the effect of pH on swelling capacity and urea release behavior should be examined; (2) the performance of the urea/CS/PVA formulation on plant growth also needs to be studied through field experiments; (3) the biodegradability of the urea/CS/PVA formulation needs to be further investigated; and (4) using a low-grade source of chitosan for the urea/CS/PVA formulation merit more study to reduce the product cost."
13,Conclusion,"In the scope of this work, urea/CS/PVA formulations designed as a new type of slow-release nitrogen fertilizer were prepared by a simple process, in which CS/PVA blended solution was mixed with urea and the cross-linking agent. The characterization provided evidence of interaction based on hydrogen bonding between urea molecules and the functional groups of polymer molecules. Hydrogel structure affected the melting of encapsulated urea crystals, while urea influenced the thermal degradation of the hydrogels. The urea/CS/PVA formulations had nonporous surfaces, and the number of crystals embedded on the surface increased with the contents of urea and the cross-linking agent. A high degree of cross-linking resulted in a dense cross-linking structure, high hydrolytic stability, and a low concentration of urea released. The high content of urea reduced the cross-linking degree of formulation, thus increasing the urea release rate. The urea/CS/PVA formulations showed a sustained release of urea during 10 days without burst release in the initial stage. The findings in this study revealed that the formation of the SRF formulation based on urea incorporating cross-linked CS/PVA blend is a feasible process. Therefore, the urea/CS/PVA formulation can be viewed as a potential material for the controlled release of urea and minimizing cost and environmental problems."
