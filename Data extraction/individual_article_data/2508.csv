0,Introduction,"With the rapid development of society, the demand for energy, either in the form of traditional fossil energy or as new green clean energy has experienced a significant growth [1–3]. In particular, hydrogen energy and solar energy are attracting increased attention as clean energy forms due to their excellent performance [4–5]. Consequently, the efficient conversion of solar energy to chemical energy, especially by semiconductor photocatalysis, has become a research hotspot [6]. In this context, a suitable bandgap, efficient charge separation ability, and wide light absorption range are essential criteria to measure the performance of photocatalysts [7–9]. In the filed of photoelectric conversion devices and catalysis, Bi2S3 is a narrow bandgap semiconductor with a layered anisotropic structure (1.2–1.7 eV) [10,11], which can be prepared by various methods such as chemical vapor deposition [12,13], hydrothermal method [14], sonochemical method, microwave irradiation, and solventless techniques [15–17]. Owing to its narrow bandgap, Bi2S3 always used as a light-absorbing in composite systems to enhance the light absorption capacity of the entire system [12]. However, precisely because of its narrow bandgap, the recombination of its electron-hole pairs occurs easily, which is not conducive to the photocatalytic hydrogen production process [10]. Another promising material for photocatalytic hydrogen production with a narrow bandgap is noble-metal-free cobalt sulfide, Co9S8 [18,19]. Zero-dimensional (0D) Co9S8 nanoparticles are known to exhibit short photogenic charge transfer distance, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction process [20]. However, the easy aggregation and the small specific surface area of amorphous Co9S8 nanoparticles are disadvantages that cannot be ignored [21,22]. To increase the contact area of 0D nanoparticles while effectively inhibiting their aggregation, a three-dimensional (3D) structure such as the peanut-shaped 3D structure of Bi2S3 can be used as a support. The presence of 3D peanut-like Bi2S3 not only provides growth sites for 0D Co9S8 nanoparticles, but also reduces the degree of aggregation of the Co9S8 nanoparticles, which results in an increase in the contact area [23,24]. In this work, we envisioned the combination of Bi2S3 and Co9S8, which are both narrow bandgap semiconductor materials, could be beneficial for enhancing their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, which could be achieved by constructing an S-scheme heterojunction between Bi2S3 and Co9S8 and by controlling the morphology to accelerate the charge transfer [25]. On the one hand, to control the morphology, 0D Co9S8 nanoparticles were successfully wrapped on 3D Bi2S3 by an in situ hydrothermal synthesis method. This kind of 0D/3D spatial structure effectively shortened the electron transfer path of this system and slowed down the degree of aggregation of Co9S8. On the other hand, through the construction of S-scheme heterojunction between Co9S8 and Bi2S3, a more effective redox potential was retained and the recombination of nonessential electron-hole pairs was promoted. In addition to their use as light absorbers, this work describes other applications of narrow band gap semiconductors in photocatalysis, such as the construction of heterojunction and the control of morphology."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of photocatalysts,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts All of the chemicals are analytical grade reagent (AR) and could be used without further purification. The source and purity of all chemicals are shown in Table 1 . 2.1.1 Preparation of BiVO4 Bare BiVO4 was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. First, 2 mmol Bi (NO3)3·5H2O was added into 30 mL ethanediol, and the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min until complete dissolution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O. The resulting solution was named solution A. At the same time, 2 mmol NH4VO3 was added into 20 mL hot deionized (DI) water, and the mixture was stirred until NH4VO3 was evenly dissolved, forming solution B. Then, solution B was added dropwise to solution A for 1 h while stirring. The obtained suspension was transferred to a 100 mL autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 15 h. The resulting samples were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with water and ethanol, and dried overnight at 80 °C. The obtained orange sample was named BiVO4 [26]. 2.1.2 Preparation of Bi2S3/Co9S8 First, 0.1 g BiVO4 was dispersed into 30 mL DI water and ultrasonicated for 10 min. Then, the proper amount of C4H6CoO4·4H2O was added under room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min until complete dissolution of C4H6CoO4·4H2O. After that, Na2S·9H2O was added slowly (Co/S mole ratio = 1:5), and the stirring was continued for further 30 min until Na2S·9H2O was totally dissolved. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained Co9S8/Bi2S3 composites were washed three times with DI water and alcohol and collected after drying overnight. Adjust the amount of C4H6CoO4·4H2O was adjusted (30, 50, 70, and 90 mg) to prepare composites with different proportions, which named Co/Bi-1, Co/Bi-2, Co/Bi-3, and Co/Bi-4, respectively. Besides, bare Co9S8 and Bi2S3 were also obtained under the same condition without adding BiVO4 and C4H6CoO4·4H2O, respectively. Scheme 1 exhibits the specific process of preparation, and Table 2 summarizes the different amounts of catalyst added for all the prepared samples."
3,Photocatalytic hydrogen production,"2.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 10 mg catalyst and 10 mg Eosin-Y (EY) were poured into 30 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) with a pH of 10 and a concentration of 15%. The mixture was placed in a 62 mL quartz reaction flask and ultrasonicated for 10 min until the catalyst was evenly dispersed. After that, the flask was deoxygenated by passing nitrogen gas for 10 min to ensure an anaerobic environment. The reactor was put into a multi-channel reaction system (PCX50A Discover, Perfectlight, Beijing) using a 5 W LED as a light source. A sample of 0.5 mL of gas was taken from the bottle every hour to analyze the produced hydrogen by gas chromatography (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13X column, nitrogen as the carrier). Stability tests were performed by conducting four cycles: each cycle was maintained for 2.5 h. After each cycle, the above steps for the hydrogen production reaction were repeated, and 10 mg fresh EY was added, but no sacrificial reagent was added."
4,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements Photoelectrochemical tests were performed proceeding on an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT4-400, AMETEK) with a self-regulating standard three-electrode cell consisting of saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, Pt electrode as a counter electrode, and indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass (1 × 1 cm2) as a working electrode. The transient photocurrent (i-t, 0.2 V potential vs. SCE), electrochemical impedance (EIS, 0.2 potential vs. SCE), polarization curves (LSV, −0.6 V to 0 V vs. SCE) and Mott-Schottky plots (M−S, −1 V to 1 V vs. SCE) were determined. To prepare the working electrode, 5 mg of the catalyst was added into 10 μL Nafion solution and ultrasonicated for 1 h, followed by drip-coating the dispersed catalyst uniformly on the precleaned conductive surface of the ITO glass at room temperature. During the transient photocurrent test, a 300 W Xenon lamp was used as a light source with a cut-off filter of 420 nm. The electrolyte solution was a 0.2 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution, and the irradiation area was 1 cm2."
5,Characterization,"2.4 Characterization Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss evo 10) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2-TF30) analysis was conducted with an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV and 300 kV, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted processing with a tube voltage of 40 KV and a tube current of 40 mA (Rigaku RINT-2000, Cu Kα radiation, scan rate: 10° min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi) was employed to explore the elemental composition. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples were obtained at 77 K using an ASAP 2020 M instrument, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation was used to analyze the results. Pore size distribution images were obtained by the model of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer using BaSO4 as the background reference. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were obtained with a FluoroMAX-4 spectrometer (Horiba, France) at room temperature."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Surface structure characteristic analysis,"3.1 Surface structure characteristic analysis 3.1.1 X-ray diffraction analysis The obtained samples were subjected to an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to determine the material composition and whether there was any crystallinity change after recombination. As depicted in Fig. 1 a, the XRD pattern of bare Bi2S3 matches well with the corresponding standard card (JCPDF# 84-279). The peaks at 15.71°, 22.33°, 25.03°, 28.71°, 31.74°, 45.56°, and 52.35° correspond to the (002), (022), (111), (023), (122), (150), and (231) crystal face, respectively. Apart from these obvious main peaks, other small peaks also match well with the standard card, demonstrating the good crystallinity of Bi2S3. Meanwhile, the absence of any prominent peak in the XRD pattern of bare Co9S8 evidenced its amorphous characteristics. The presence of Co9S8 was verified by an XPS analysis [27]. As shown in Fig. 1b, the intensity of the typical peaks of Bi2S3 decreases upon increasing the mass ration of Co9S8 in the Co9S8/Bi2S3 composites. This phenomenon may be caused by an excess of Co9S8 nanoparticles attaching to the surface of Bi2S3 which influenced its crystallinity eventually weakening its characteristic peaks. Furthermore, because of the amorphous characteristic of Co9S8, no peaks attributable to Co9S8 were observed in the XRD patterns of the Co9S8/Bi2S3 composites. 3.1.2 Morphology and structure Fig. 2 a–d display the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of BiVO4, Bi2S3, Co9S8, and Co/Bi-3. As shown in Fig. 2a, BiVO4 exhibits a clear and regular short rod-like structure similar to peanuts. It is worth mentioning that this peanut-like structure was maintained in Bi2S3, as can be seen in Fig. 2b. Besides, the SEM image of Co9S8 depicted in Fig. 2c shows agglomerated 0D nanoparticles. For the growth of the 0D Co9S8 nanoparticles, the special peanut-like structure of Bi2S3 provides a good supporting framework. Compared with the smooth surface of Bi2S3, the surface of Co/Bi-3 is significantly rougher and decorated with particles, as shown in Fig. 2d. Despite this, the peanut-like, short rod structure of Co/Bi-3 remains unaltered. The presence of Bi2S3 as support for the growth of Co9S8 nanoparticles greatly inhibits their aggregation, which provides more active area for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In addition, the 0D/3D Co9S8/Bi2S3 structure facilitates the separation and transfer of reactant molecules, thereby improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity [23]. Fig. 2e displays a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of Co/Bi-3 in which the peanut-like structure can be more clearly seen. Bi2S3 and Co9S8 can be clearly distinguished from each other, as depicted in the diagram of Fig. 2f. The blue curve region corresponds to Bi2S3, and Co9S8 can be easily observed on the edge of Bi2S3. A magnification of this image is provided in Fig. 2g, in which the Co9S8 nanoparticles appear as a translucent film wrapped around Bi2S3 due to their small size. The lattice spacings of 0.56 nm, 0.35 nm, and 0.28 nm correspond to the (002), (111), and (022) crystal planes of Bi2S3, respectively, which were detected in the HRTEM image of Fig. 2h. This image also shows the amorphous Co9S8 nanoparticles. This result is in accord with that of the XRD analysis (Fig. 1a). In Fig. 2i, the EDX spectrum of Co/Bi-3 demonstrates the presence of Co, Bi, and S elements, which definitely proves the successful combination of Co9S8 and Bi2S3. 3.1.3 Specific surface areas analysis According to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, Fig. 3 a, b, and c display the nitrogen adsorption-desorption plots and pore size distribution curves of Bi2S3, Co9S8, and Co/Bi-3, respectively. All the samples show IV-type isotherms and H3 hysteresis loops, demonstrating the occurrence of mesoporous capillary aggregation [28]. The insert pictures exhibit the pore size distribution curves of Bi2S3, Co9S8, and Co/Bi-3, from which it can be extracted that the pore size of the three specimens is mainly concentrated in the range of 0–50 nm, indicating that the materials consist of a small number of micropores (0–2 nm) and a large number of mesopores (2–50 nm). As summarized in Table 3 , the average pore size of Co/Bi-3, Co9S8, and Bi2S3 is 11 nm, 16 nm, and 14 nm, respectively. The pore volume of Co/Bi-3 (0.03 cm3 g−1) is exactly between Co9S8 (0.18 cm3 g−1) and Bi2S3 (0.04 cm3 g−1). The specific surface area of Bi2S3, Co9S8, and Co/Bi-3 reaches 11 m2 g−1, 42 m2 g−1, and 12 m2 g−1, respectively. Apparently, after the introduction of Co9S8, the specific surface area of the Co/Bi-3 composite has increased compared with that of pure Bi2S3. However, the pore volume and the pore size decreased. This decrease may be caused by the attachment of tiny Co9S8 nanoparticles to the pores of Bi2S3, which affects its pore volume and pore size. Interestingly, it is precisely because of the attachment of Co9S8 that the specific surface area of Co/Bi-3 increases. 3.1.4 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis Fig. 4 a shows the XPS survey spectra of Co9S8, Bi2S3, and Co/Bi-3 for the analysis of their surface chemical element composition. As displayed in Fig. 4a, Bi2S3 and the Co/Bi-3 composite contain S and Bi elements. In addition, the Co element from Co9S8 can be observed in Co/Bi-3. This result demonstrates the successful synthesis of the Co/Bi-3 composite. Fig. 4b exhibits the fine spectra of Bi 4f in Bi2S3 and Co/Bi-3. In the spectrum of Bi2S3, besides the typical peak at 161.04 eV attributed to the S 2p orbital, other fitted peaks corresponding to Bi3+ appear. The peaks located at 164.39 eV and 159.18 eV are related to Bi 4f5/2, and those located at 163.68 eV and 158.38 eV are attributable to Bi 4f7/2 [10,29]. Compared with bare Bi2S3, the peak of Bi 4f in the XPS spectrum of Co/Bi-3 shifts toward a higher energy position. As shown in Fig. 4b, the binding energy of Bi 4f5/2 shifts to 164.44 eV and 159.26 eV from 164.39 and 159.18 eV in Bi2S3, respectively. Moreover, the peak related to Bi 4f7/2 shifts from 163.68 eV and 158.38 eV to 163.70 and 158.40 eV. The peak corresponding to S 2p shifts from 161.04 eV to 161.06 eV. The positive shift in the binding energy is more obvious in the fine spectrum of S 2p as displayed in Fig. 4c. The fitted spectrum of S 2p in Bi2S3 exhibits two peaks located at 163.66 and 164.39 eV from bare Bi2S3, respectively, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. Moreover, the binding energy of S 2p in the Co/Bi-3 composite shifts toward a positive direction, with the peaks related to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 appearing at 163.72 and 164.47 eV, respectively. This change in the binding energy of Bi 4f and S 2p illustrates the close contact between Bi2S3 and Co9S8 after introduction of Co9S8 [30,31], which is further proved by the Co 2p spectra shown in Fig. 4d. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p in Co9S8 splits into two spin-orbit doublets. The first peak at 782.07 eV and the second peak at 798.03 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively [32]. In addition to this, two residual peaks appearing at 786.81 and 803.45 eV are satellite peaks [33]. In the spectrum of the Co/Bi-3 composite, the peaks related to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 shift to a lower position of 781.94 and 797.94 eV, respectively. Moreover, the other two satellite peaks migrate to 786.77 eV and 803.43 eV. It should be mentioned that, compared with the positive shift of the binding energy of Bi 4f and S 2p, the binding energy of Co 2p in the Co/Bi-3 composite undergoes a negative shift. This result is complementary to that extracted from Fig. 4b, illustrating the close interaction between Bi2S3 and to Co9S8 [34]. This shift in the binding energy also demonstrates the formation of a heterojunction between the two specimens. It is worth mentioning that the the high-resolution XPS analysis of Co 2p is more appropriate to prove the existence of Co9S8 than the XRD results."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen production performance,"3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production performance The photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of the obtained samples was tested using TEOA as an electron donor and EY as a sensitizer under visible light irradiation. In contrast with pure Co9S8 and Bi2S3, the hydrogen evolution activity of Co9S8/Bi2S3 was obviously enhanced by 11 and 249 times, respectively, especially at pH = 11. As displayed in Fig. 5 a, the hydrogen production of Bi2S3 was negligible (0.59 μmol). Meanwhile, after being combined with Co9S8 (13.15 μmol), the highest hydrogen production activity of the Co/Bi-3 composite reached 147.17 μmol in 5 h. Fig. 5b exhibits the hydrogen evolution activity of Co9S8/Bi2S3 composites with different rations, measured at every hour, which shows a typical volcanic shape. Upon increasing the Co9S8 content in the Co9S8/Bi2S3 composite, the hydrogen evolution performance increased clearly until a weight of cobalt acetate of 70% that of BiVO4. The hydrogen production of Co/Bi-1, Co/Bi-2, Co/Bi-3, and Co/Bi-4 was 75.08, 88.79, 147.17, 59.99 μmol in 5 h. Undoubtedly, the hydrogen evolution activity was significantly enhanced because of the synergy between the active sites of Bi2S3 and Co9S8, however, excessive Co9S8 nanoparticles cause aggregation at the edge of the Bi2S3, which results in a decrease in the hydrogen evolution activity of Co/Bi-4. Furthermore, compared with other Bi2S3-based catalysts, Co9S8/Bi2S3 possesses better catalytic activity as shown in Table 4 , as a result of the special 0D/3D spatial structure between Co9S8 and Bi2S3 [35,36]. The pH of the reaction is also a very important factor in the hydrogen evolution process. Fig. 5c shows the effect of pH on the photocatalytic performance of Co/Bi-3 in this system. Apparently, at pH = 11, the photocatalytic activity of Co/Bi-3 achieved the best result. Both strongly alkaline (pH = 12) and neutral conditions were not conducive to hydrogen evolution. Under acidic conditions, the existence of excessive H+ causes a serious decrease in the efficacy of the electron donor [37]. Under alkaline reaction conditions, the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen generation is remarkably reduced due to a decrease in the H+ concentration [38]. Apart from that, the pH of the reaction system also affects the adsorbability of EY molecules on the surface of the Co/Bi-3 composite. The hydrogen production was 7.41, 12.11, 147.15, and 66.73 μmol at pH = 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively. Moreover, the stability of the catalyst is another vital factor for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Therefore, the durability of Co/Bi-3 was investigated in a cycle stability test (Fig. 5d). During the whole test, no fresh sacrificial reagent was added, but 10 mg EY was readded in each cycle. It can be seen from Fig. 5d that the hydrogen production activity in each cycle is virtually maintained, which demonstrates the good hydrogen production stability of Co/Bi-3. In addition to this, Fig. 5e exhibits a comparison of the XRD pattern of Co/Bi-3 before and after the hydrogen production reaction. Despite a certain weakening of the intensity of the peak, the typical characteristic peaks of Co/Bi-3 are still well distinguishable after the hydrogen production process. Fig. 5f displays the SEM image of the Co/Bi-3 after use. Compared with the SEM image before hydrogen production, a certain collapse of the structure of Co/Bi-3 can be observed, but the peanut-like structure is still maintained in general."
9,Optical properties,"3.3 Optical properties 3.3.1 UV-visble diffuse reflectance spectra As depicted in Fig. 6 a and the insert picture, a similar trend with the same dark color can be observed in the UV-visble diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of Co9S8, Bi2S3, and Co/Bi-3 in a wavelength range of 400–800 nm, which corresponds to that of the light source used in the hydrogen evolution process (5 W LED). In this wavelength range, the Co/Bi-3 composite shows higher absorption intensity than bare Co9S8 and Bi2S3. This enhanced optical absorption capability means that more photons can participate in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process in Co/Bi-3. The enhanced light absorption ability of the special 0D/3D structure of Co/Bi-3 may be a key factor for improving the hydrogen evolution performance [39] According to the Kubelka-Munk Eq. (1), the bandgap (Eg) of Bi2S3 and Co/Bi-3 was determined to be 1.2 and 1.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 6b) [10]. (1) α h v = A ( h v - E g ) n / 2 Where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Plank’s constant; v represents the light frequency, Eg is the bandgap energy, and A is a constant, respectively. 3.3.2 Photoluminescence and Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra The fluorescence properties of the obtained samples are related with the degree of recombination of photogenic electron-hole pairs, and the separation ability of the photogenic electrons is another criterion to measure the photocatalytic performance of a catalyst. Fig. 7 a shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic patterns of Co/Bi-3 and pure EY, Co9S8, and Bi2S3 in EY solution. The pure EY solution shows the strongest PL intensity at about 530 nm under the 480 nm excitation wavelength. With the addition of Co9S8, Bi2S3, and Co/Bi-3, the peak intensity of the EY solution displays an obvious decrease (Fig. 7a), achieving its minimum value for Co/Bi-3. A higher PL intensity indicates that more excited electrons return to the ground state through the radiation decay, which means a higher rate of e−–h+ pairs recombination [40]. Thus, the decrease in the PL intensity suggests that the recombination of photogenic e−–h+ pairs is effectually restrained in the Co/Bi-3 composite catalyst [41,42]. The 3D peanut-like structure of Bi2S3 provides an excellent supporting framework and attachment site for the growth of 0D Co9S8 nanoparticles. Therefore, compared with pure Bi2S3, after the introduction of Co9S8, the specific surface area of Co/Bi-3 increases. As a result, the adsorption of EY molecules is enhanced, which facilitates the charge transfer and improves the photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity. This result is further proved by the TRPL spectra of Co9S8, Bi2S3, and Co/Bi-3 recorded with a 454 nm lamp and fitted by a three-exponential decay function (2) (Fig. 7b). (2) I ( t ) = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i exp ( - t / τ i ) In Eq. (2), I is the normalized emission intensity, t is the time of pulsed laser excitation, Bi represents the amplitude (preexponential factor), τi is the TRPL decay time. The average lifetime of EY, Co9S8, Bi2S3, and Co/Bi-3 were calculated using Eq. (3) as follows: (3) τ av = ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i τ i 2 / ∑ i = 1 , 2 , 3 B i τ i Where τav is the average lifetime, Bi represents the amplitude (preexponential factor), and τi is the TRPL decay time. Table 5 shows a comparison of the average lifetime of bare EY (0.03 ns) with those obtained after addition of the samples. When Co/Bi-3 was added to the EY solution, the average lifetime was increased (1.15 ns) compared with that of pure Bi2S3 (1.07 ns), which means that the presence of Co9S8 nanoparticles successfully increases the lifetime of the photogenerated charge in the composite. In addition, the lifetime of the radioactive process (τ 2) of Co/Bi-3 (1.40 ns) was longer than that of pure Co9S8 (1.36 ns) or Bi2S3 (1.35 ns), which demonstrated a better effect of electron-hole on separation [43]."
10,Photoelectrochemical experiments,"3.4 Photoelectrochemical experiments The photoelectrochemical properties of Co/Bi-3, Co9S8, and Bi2S3 were investigated in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As displayed in Fig. 8 a, Co/Bi-3, Co9S8, and Bi2S3 show different photocurrent response intensity under the same intermittent light conditions. The photocurrent response intensity reflects the separation performance of photoinduced e−–h+ pairs: higher photocurrent density is indicative of a better separation capacity of photogenic e−–h+ pairs. Co/Bi-3 shows the highest photocurrent density compared with Co9S8 and Bi2S3, which demonstrated the greatest separation efficiency of photogenic e−–h+ pairs, which is conductive to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance [44]. The enhanced photocurrent density of Co/Bi-3 may due to the formation of the heterojunction between Bi2S3 and Co9S8, in which availably accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenic electrons is accelerated. Besides, the special 0D/3D structure between Co9S8 and Bi2S3 also provides a more convenient path for the electron transfer. Fig. 8b displays the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) pattern of Co/Bi-3, Co9S8, and Bi2S3. The circular arc radius of the Nyquist curves is connected with the transfer rate of the charge in the interfacial reaction; a smaller radius of the arc means a faster charge transfer rate and better excellent photoelectric performance [45]. The original measurement curves of Co/Bi-3 shows the smallest semicircular intermediate frequency region (Fig. 8b), which means that Co/Bi-3 exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance [46,47]. These results demonstrate that the construction of heterojunction between the interface of Co9S8 and Bi2S3 promotes the photoinduced charge transfer. The improved charge transferability and the decreased transfer resistance in the interface greatly improve the hydrogen evolution performance. To further explore the hydrogen generation kinetics under high current density on the surface of the photocatalyst, the polarization curves of Co/Bi-3, pure Co9S8, and Bi2S3 were determined (Fig. 8c). Apparently, the Co/Bi-3 composite shows higher photocurrent density and lower hydrogen evolution overpotential under the same potential and photocurrent density than Co9S8 and Bi2S3, which reveals that the Co/Bi-3 composite has an optimal electron transport efficiency as an electrode. Fig. 8d exhibits the Mott-Schottky curves of Co9S8 and Bi2S3 to explore the flat band potential and semiconductor types. Generally, a negative slope of the C-2/E curve represents p-type semiconductors, and a positive slope corresponds to n-type semiconductors [39]. As shown in Fig. 8d, both Co9S8 and Bi2S3 are n-type semiconductors. This is one of the conditions for the formation of a S-scheme heterojunction. When using saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, the Efb of bare Co9S8 and Bi2S3 was −0.89 V and −0.18 V, respectively [10,29,32]. According to the flat band potential obtained from the Mott-Schottky curve, the conduction band potential (ECB) could be roughly estimated. For n-type semiconductors, the ECB value has generally a more negative position than Efb by about 0.1–0.2 V [48,49]. Thus, the ECB of Co9S8 and Bi2S3 were estimated to be −1.09 and −0.39 V vs. SCE, scilicet, −0.85, and −0.14 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). According to the published literature and the measured UV-vis DRS, the bandgap of Bi2S3 and Co9S8 is 1.2 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively [10,32]. Based on the above results, the valence band potential (EVB) of Bi2S3 and Co9S8 was calculated to be 1.06 and 0.4 V vs. NHE from the formula EVB = ECB + Eg [50]. Thus, the S-scheme heterojunction is formed between Bi2S3 and Co9S8 due to the difference in the band structure. The energy bands between Bi2S3 and Co9S8 are intertwined, which is also a prerequisite for the formation of an S-scheme heterojunction."
11,Mechanism of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process,"3.5 Mechanism of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process On the basis of the present staggered energy band arrangement between Bi2S3 and Co9S8, an S-scheme electron transfer mechanism can be inferred from the above results in the EY-sensitized Co/Bi-3 system. As shown in Fig. 9 , the Co9S8/Bi2S3 composite retains the peanut shape structure, although 0D amorphous Co9S8 nanoparticles can be easily observed on the surface. The introduction of Co9S8 does not change the integral morphology of Bi2S3, but the presence of Co9S8 makes the original smooth surface of Bi2S3 rough and more susceptible to adhere sensitized EY molecules. Moreover, the electrons on the CB of Bi2S3 combine with the holes on the VB of Co9S8 because of the band bending and coulomb attraction, thus maintaining a strong redox potential [51]. When the dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of Co9S8/Bi2S3, a single excited state of EY1* is formed, which is then transformed into a more stable triple-excited state EY3* by intersystem crossing (ISC). After that, the EY3* state is quenched, forming an EY-· state with strong reducing ability, when TEOA is used as a sacrificial agent to consume holes [52,53]. The electrons of EY-· are transferred to the active surface of Co9S8/Bi2S3 to participate in the reduction process producing hydrogen. Meanwhile, the dye molecules return to the ground state. The combination of this kind of 0D/3D cladding structure and S-scheme heterojunction between Co9S8 and Bi2S3 improves the hydrogen production performance. This complementarity promotes the recombination of unnecessary e−–h+ pairs, shortening the path for effective charge transfer and retaining higher redox capacity. In addition, the rough surface of Co9S8/Bi2S3 facilitates the adsorption of EY molecules, which also contributes to the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity."
12,Conclusion,"In conclusion, a Co9S8/Bi2S3 composite having a 0D/3D structure was successfully synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method. The 0D/3D structure greatly optimizes the electron transfer path and accelerates the separation rate of photogenic charge, according to the electrochemical characterization results. The construction of an S-scheme heterojunction between Co9S8 and Bi2S3 together with the formation of a structure in which Co9S8 is wrapped in the outer layer of Bi2S3, contributes to increase the hydrogen production activity. Therefore, different from the traditional strategy of narrowing bandgap of semiconductors, this work greatly optimizes the hydrogen evolution performance of narrow bandgap semiconductor materials by constructing an S-scheme heterojunction and a 0D/3D spatial structure, which could also provide new ideas for the application of narrow bandgap semiconductors [19,26,32,36]."
