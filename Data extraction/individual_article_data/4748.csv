0,Introduction,"Fossil fuel exhaustion, increasing global environmental pollution and ever-growing energy demand have promoted the development and utilization of clean energy sources a world-wide focal objective [1]. Because of its high energy density, light weight, producing water during combustion, hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier that play a major role in solving the global energy crisis and environmental deterioration [2–5]. There are a number of transition metal oxides have been examined as HER electrode materials such as Co3O4 [6], α-MoO3−x [7]and NiO [8]. Compared to Co and Ni, Mn has a smaller electronegativity and stronger attraction towards H+, beneficial for the formation of Hads. MnO2 possesses great potential as the active electrode material in electrochemical capacitors [9–13], and finds broad applications in supercapacitors [14–16], electrocatalysts [17–19], and sensors [20,21]. Some research reveals using MnO2 as the HER electrode but with relatively low activity, requiring an overpotential of 197 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 [19].To reach the same current density as a Pt electrode does. The addition of trace amount of precious metals such as Pd to MnO2 can effectively enhance its electrocatalytic activity. Pd/Mn3O4 in hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution [13,22] and Pd/Mn2O3 in hydrogen evolution [23] both demonstrate promising electrocatalytic activities. But the hydrothermal preparation conditions are relatively harsh and time-consuming. TiO2 nanoarrays (TNAs) prepared via the anodic oxidation are a novel type of nanomaterials. The highly oriented tubular structure of TNAs enables them to efficiently collect electrons, induce vector charge transfer, accelerate electron transport, enhance adsorption of reactants and desorption of products, and promote electrochemical transformations [24–26]. However, the charge transfer bottleneck during the electrocatalytic processes results from the less than satisfactory conductivity of TiO2. One approach is to combine TNAs with other nanostructures to improve the electrochemical behavior. MnO2 produced with electrochemical deposition shows high electrochemical reactivity. The reactions occur on the active sites or oxygen vacant sites of high conductivity that afford good contact. When the composite of MnO2/TNAs is used as the support, the conductivity is increased, the charge transfer velocity is augmented, and the active sites are enhanced [27]. In this study, we use TNAs prepared via the anodic oxidation as the substrate and incorporate MnO2 to improve the conductivity. TNAs are decorated with MnO2 and Pd by the two-step electrodeposition treatment and used as the HER electrode in acidic medium. The unique composite structure of Pd–MnO2/TNAs presents greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity, showing excellent electrochemical performance with only 63 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. The good stability of the electrode is displayed by the undiminished performance after 12 h running."
1,Experimental,
2,"Preparation of TNAs, MnO2/TNAs, Pd–MnO2/TNAs, MnO2-Pd/TNAs","2.1 Preparation of TNAs, MnO2/TNAs, Pd–MnO2/TNAs, MnO2-Pd/TNAs TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) were prepared according to our previous work [28,29]. The electrochemical anodization was conducted in ethylene glycol solution with 0.2 wt%HF + 0.5 wt%NH4F + 2 vol%H2O at a constant voltage of 60 V for 4 h at room temperature. A chemically polished Ti foil (99.8%) was used as the working electrode, whereas graphite plates as the counter electrode. The prepared amorphous TNAs were treated at 500 °C in air for 2 h to transform to anatase TiO2, then cleaned with 10 vol% H2O2 under ultrasonication for 10 min. The cleaned TNAs were used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode, graphite plates as the counter electrode, in electrolyte of 0.1 M MnAc2 and NH4Ac. Electrodeposition was conducted under −1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at room temperature for 100 s, the optimized conditions detailed in Fig. S1. After rinse with DI water and alcohol for three times, the MnO2 decorated TNAs were prepared. Deposition of Pd was performed under a constant voltage of –0.75 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 150 s, using MnO2/TNAs as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode, Pt plates as the counter electrode, in the electrolyte of 0.002 M Pd(NO3)2 and 0.1 M KCl [30]. After rinse with DI water and alcohol for three times, the Pd–MnO2/TNAs electrodes were acquired. To compare the electrochemical properties of the fabricated Pd–MnO2/TNAs electrodes, the following materials were also prepared: Pd decorated TNAs, MnO2 decorated TNAs, and the reversed-sequence-deposited Pd/MnO2 decorated TNAs, denoted Pd/TNAs, MnO2/TNAs, and MnO2–Pd/TNAs, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization The samples were analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) to afford the crystal phase composition, using Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5406) scanning in the 20–80° range. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Al Ka radiation to produce chemical composition. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to demonstrate the microscopic morphologies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to characterize surface element composition."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements A CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) was used for all electrochemical measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scanning rate of 10 mV s−1 to measure the hydrogen production activity, cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the electrochemical surface area and the double layer capacitance C dl, combined LSV and CV to analyze the electrode stability, Tafel curves to dissect the hydrogen production mechanism and reaction steps, and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) to provide the resistance values of the equivalent circuit units in order to analyze the reaction kinetics. The three electrode system was constituted of a sample working electrode of 1 cm2, a platinum counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode, except for LSV whereas the counter electrode was graphite. The electrolyte was 0.5 M H2SO4. The voltage conversion between the Ag/AgCl electrode and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is as follows: (1) E R H E = E A g / A g C l + E A g / A g C l ( 0.209 ) 0 + 0.059 p H All LSV and CV curves in this study were not IR-corrected."
5,Results and discussion,"XRD patterns of the samples are displayed in Fig. 1 (a). The diffraction peaks of both anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No.21-1272) and metallic Ti (JCPDS No. 44-1294) substrate can be distinguished in the figure. No new peaks emerged after deposition of MnO2, implying the non-crystalline or very small MnO2 phase [31–33]. The weaker diffraction peak intensity and broader peak width appeared after deposition of Pd, possibly due to the covering of TNAs and Ti substrate surfaces by deposited MnO2 and Pd. To further investigate the attachment of MnO2 and Pd onto TNAs, Raman analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 1(b). The sample peaks at 145, 199, 395, 513, and 637 cm−1 are assigned to the E1g, E2g, B1g, A1g + B2g, and E3g vibration modes of anatase TiO2, respectively. After deposition of MnO2 and Pd, there was no new Raman peak observed. The peak intensity of the substrate was reduced and the absorption edge was slighted blue shifted, combined result of size effect and surface relaxation [34,35]. The results suggest that there was apparent charge transfer between Pd/MnO2 and TNAs. The accelerated charge carrier transfer and transport inside the electrode are beneficial to the catalytic reaction process because of the improved binding between Pd/MnO2 and TNAs. The SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. 2 . The hollow tubular structure of TNAs is demonstrated in Fig. 2(a), illustrating the highly ordered, surface smooth, and tightly arranged tubular array structure of TiO2 nanotubes. After deposition of MnO2, the TNAs structure remained intact, but the surface became more coarse while the tube walls were thicker, Fig. 2(b). The tube structure remained even after deposition of Pd, but showing more coarse tube openings with attached Pd nanoparticles, Fig. 2(c) and (d). From the SEM and EDS results, we can conclude that MnO2 evenly covered the TNAs surface, while Pd nanoparticles of 4–6 nm (Fig. S2) were uniformly dispersed over MnO2 on top of TNAs without aggregation. Fig. 3 shows the morphology and microstructure of Pd–MnO2/TNAs. In Fig. 3(a), a good number of Pd nanoparticles are observed to be dispersed on nanotubes with good contact. Fig. 3(b) is the HRTEM of the sample demonstrating clear lattice stripes, indicating good crystallinity of the samples. The lattice spacings of 0.35, 0.223 and 0.24 nm are assigned to TiO2 (1 0 1), Pd (1 1 1) and MnO2 (2 1 1) facets, respectively. Fig. 3(c) illustrates the EDS mapping, showing that the nanotubes had a diameter of ~150 nm with chemical composition of Ti, Pd, Mn, and O. TiO2 appeared as the support with O and Ti masking the full substrate, while Mn and Pd were much less in content but similar in distribution. The chemical composition and oxidation state were further unveiled by XPS analysis. Ti 2p, Mn 2p, O 1s and Pd 3d are shown in Fig. S4. The fine spectrum in Fig. 4 (a) reveals binding energies of 464 and 458.3 eV, ascribed to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 of Ti4+ in TiO2. In Fig. 4(b), oxygen is observed to exist in two chemical environments, 529.5 eV of lattice oxygen in TiO2 and 531.5–532.5 eV of chemisorbed oxygen from atmosphere [36]. In Fig. 4(c), binding energies of 653 and 641.2 eV are assigned to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2, respectively, and 646.6 eV to Mn4+ satellite that has the same binding energy of MnO2. Plus, the spin separation energy between Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 is 11.8 eV [37], further indicating the component in the prepared electrode material was MnO2. Fig. 4(d) displays the fine spectrum of Pd 3d. The binding energies of 340.93 and 335.73 eV correspond to Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2, respectively, correlated well with Pd0 [38,39]. The combined XRD, XPS, EDS, SEM, TEM/HRTEM, Raman and EDX (Fig. S3) results exhibit the preparation of Pd–MnO2/TNAs composite electrode. The samples were tested on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation with the three-electrode system to determine the HER performance. Fig. 5 (a) shows the polarization curves. The experiments showed MnO2/TNAs electrode needed overpotentials of 225 and 287 mV for current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. After deposition of Pd, the overpotentials of Pd-MnO2/TNAs significantly decreased to reach the same current density, which was only 63 and 92 mV respectively. By changing the order of deposition, the MnO2-Pd/TNAs were prepared when the deposition of MnO2 took place after the deposition of Pd. Their electrocatalytic activity was obviously lower than that of Pd-MnO2/TNAs, and slightly higher than that of Pd/TNAs. The reason why may be that Pd nanoparticles with higher activity were blocked by MnO2 with lower activity. To understand the rate limiting steps for the electrode reaction, the Tafel regions were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Tafel slope of Pd/TNAs is 149 mV dec−1, 120 mV dec−1 for Pd–MnO2/TNAs, and 406 mV dec−1 for MnO2/TNAs. Sample Pd–MnO2/TNAs demonstrated the lowest Tafel slope, indicating the fastest electrochemical kinetics. The commonly accepted theory of the HER mechanism on Pd–MnO2/TNAs is that in acidic medium, the overall reaction (2H+(aq) + 2e− = H2(g)) is consisted of three unit reactions, according to the Volmer or Heyrovsky/Tafel pathways .The Tafel slope value for Pd–MnO2/TNAs is 120 mV dec−1, illustrating that the Volmer reaction was the rate limiting step (H+(aq) + e− → Hads). Stability is a parameter of significant importance when evaluating electrode performance. Fig. 5(c) shows the CV curves of the first and the 1000th cycles and illustrates that there is no change in the two sets of curves. So the structure and composition of the electrode experienced no apparent change after 1000 runs. Fig. 5(d) shows the polarization curves of the first and after the 1000 cycles, which also suggest that there is no diminishing of the electrochemical activity. The column graphs of the overpotentials under different current densities of the samples are presented in Fig. 5(e) and (f). Electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) measures the polarization of an electrode to establish the charge transfer resistance within the electrode. In the Nquist plot, the diameter of the high frequency semicircle describes the electron transport rate in the electrode. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), compared to MnO2/TNAs, Pd/TNAs and MnO2–Pd/TNAs, sample Pd–MnO2/TNAs had the smallest semicircle diameter. Therefore, this electrode possessed smaller resistance that presented low impedance to electron transport. The high electron transport rate in the Pd decorated MnO2/TNAs enabled the electrode high catalytic efficiency [40]. The composite structure in the Pd–MnO2/TNAs electrode provides the collaborative effects with accelerated adsorption and desorption, and enhanced electrode activity. The inset of Fig. 6(b) is the equivalent circuit with the simulated data presented in Table 1 . The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is one important parameter to evaluate electrode performance. The double layer capacitance C dl is the representation of the ECSA which can be calculated using CV data. Fig. 7 (a)–(d) are the CV curves of samples MnO2/TNAs, Pd/TNAS, MnO2–Pd/TNAs, and Pd–MnO2/TNAs at scan rates of 50–175 mV s−1 with step increase of 25 mV s−1, and scan voltage range of 0.1–0.2 V (vs. RHE). Inside the scanning region, the CV curves are ideally square-shaped with good symmetry. The results show that the electrodes were typical double layer capacitors whereas the electrode capacitance was provided solely by the double layer. The simulated C dl from CV curves are presented in Fig. 7(e), whose values are proportional to the ECSA. The C dl value for Pd–MnO2/TNAs was 41.9 mF cm−2, 1.11 times that of MnO2–Pd/TNAs (37.7 mF cm−2), 1.22 times that of MnO2/TNAs (34.4 mF cm−2), and 2.85 times that of Pd/TNAs (14.7 mF cm−2). This is clear evidence that Pd–MnO2/TNAs had the highest ECSA thus the highest electrocatalytic activity, in consistency with the polarization curve results. The unique structure of MnO2/TNAs allows accelerated internal electron transport, and provides more anchoring sites for Pd nanoparticles [27]. The Pd (3d) binding energy in Pd–MnO2/TNAs (335.1 eV) is lower than that of metallic Pd (335.6 eV), displaying the capability of providing more electrons in this electrode. The Mn 2p (641.1 eV) binding energy in this electrode is lower than that of MnO2/TNAs (642 eV), suggesting that the electron transport between Pd and MnO2/TNAs was enhanced [13,41]. MnO2 in the Pd–MnO2/TNAs electrode acts as the intermediate of electron transfer or storage, so that alters the chemical environment of Pd nanoparticles. The electrophilic interaction between Pd and H+ speeds up the Hads intermediates. The collaborative effects of the multilayered structure strengthens electrode activity thus improves the HER process."
6,Conclusions,"We utilize a two-step electrodeposition to prepare a Pd–MnO2/TNAs HER electrode. The method is simple, reliable and rapid, and the preparation process is efficient and environmental friendly that overcomes the harsh conditions employed in hydrothermal conditions. In the three-electrode system using H2SO4 as the electrolyte, the electrode demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance with overpotentials of 63 and 92 mV under 10 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. The stability of the electrode is demonstrated in 1000 cycles and 12 h of CV testing which shows no apparent reduction. The evenly sized Pd nanoparticles combined with MnO2 change the electronic structure of Pd with enhanced electron activity and improved electrode electrochemical behavior. This method affords new insights for the preparation of HER electrodes based on precious metal decorated transition metal oxides or hydroxides. The use of trace amount of precious metal to replace bulk precious metal holds promising future in HER electrode manufacturing."
