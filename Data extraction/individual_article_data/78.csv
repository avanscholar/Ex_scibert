0,Introduction,"The study of hydrogen bonding [1] in complex liquid mixtures [2] shows remarkable difficulties considering the different types of interactions. Intermolecular interactions considering homo (interaction between like molecules) and heteroassociations (interactions between unlike molecules) [3], as well as the possible intramolecular interactions [4] should be considered. The mixtures structuring rises from the competing effects between the different types of interactions and the possible development of networks [5]. These effects change upon mixing as a function of composition [6], as well as with temperature and pressure. Therefore, complex relationships are stablished between the nature of intermolecular interactions (i.e. microscopic fluid's structuring) and the macroscopic physicochemical properties of the considered mixed fluids. Therefore, the understanding of hydrogen bonding properties and characteristics has a pivotal role for the advancement of liquid state theory [7], which is of relevance not only for basic science purposes but also for the development of complex solvents [8] or functional materials [9] with industrial application based on their nanoscopic behavior. The case of alcohol liquid mixtures is of relevance considering the presence of the hydroxyl group in these compounds [10], which may act both as hydrogen donor (H-donor) or hydrogen acceptor (H-acceptor) [11]. Moreover, the inclusion of non-polar groups, highly complex hydrogen bonding networks are formed with their properties largely dependent on the location of the hydroxyl group and the size of hydrophobic chains [12,13]. The extension and dynamics of hydrogen bonding in alcohol [14] liquid mixtures should stand on factors such as the number of hydroxyl groups [15,16], their position in the corresponding carbon chains and branching [17], and the mixtures composition [18]. The available literature shows many experimental and theoretical studies analyzing the properties of hydrogen bonding in alcohols liquid mixtures [19–21], displaying a large variety of behaviors [22], with different degrees of non-ideality behavior, depending on the nature of the involved molecules. A detailed analysis on the nature of alcohol liquid mixtures requires a systematic approach considering different molecular features and their effect on the properties of the liquid mixtures. The available literature shows scarce knowledge on the hydrogen bonding for mixed fluids containing aromatic alcohol molecules [23,24], in which the presence of the bulky aromatic (e.g. phenyl) groups and their trend to develop stacking arrangements leads to very different behavior of interactions in comparisons with alkylic alcohols. Likewise, studies on alcohol – alcohol mixtures are also scarce [25,26] but they are required to understand the nature and properties of hydrogen bonding involving hydroxyl groups in complex molecular geometries and different alcohol structures. The characteristics of hydrogen bonding at the nanoscopic level can be inferred from molecular modelling studies, thus providing information on the structure, topology and dynamics characteristics of these interactions as a function of mixture composition. Molecular modelling has been used for the analysis of hydrogen bonding in alcohol liquid mixtures [27,28], but studies on aromatic alcohols are limited, thus further studies are required for the nanoscopic characterization of these interactions. Therefore, a theoretical study using a combined approach considering quantum chemistry (Density Functional Theory, DFT) and classical molecular dynamics simulations (MD) was carried out in this work for the characterization of hydrogen bonding in alcohol - alcohol liquid mixtures containing aromatic alcohols. The use of DFT and MD simulations for the analysis of intermolecular forces in the selected systems provides different types of information. Although DFT results are limited to a small number of interacting molecules, dimers in this work, because of computational restrictions, they provide accurate characterization of hydrogen bonding in terms of energy and topological properties. Nevertheless, DFT calculations do not consider additional effects by the presence of larger clusters of interacting and neighbor molecules as present in liquid state, which need to be analyzed by MD simulations. Although MD simulations are based in classical forcefield whereas DFT use a different description of systems energy based on quantum chemistry, results from both approaches should lead to similar conclusions for short-range interaction whereas the presence of bulk liquid phases are only described by MD simulations. The relevance of alcohol-alcohol mixtures for the understanding of hydrogen bonding features should be remarkable considering the use of these systems as liquid biofuels [29]. For this purpose, a collection of binary liquid mixtures was selected (Fig. 1 ) considering benzyl alcohol (BA) as the aromatic alcohol, which was mixed with 1-propanol (1PRO), 2-propanol (2-PRO), 1,2-propanediol (12PRO) or phenyl ethanol (PE) as cosolvents (COS). Therefore, the considered binary mixtures, including BA as the common component, allow the study of hydrogen bonding in alcohol binary liquid mixtures including aromatic + alkylic and aromatic + aromatic structures, as well as the study of different spatial distributions of the hydroxyl groups and the competing effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding for the considered diols [30]. The reported results allow to study the nature of the involved hydrogen bonds as a function of mixture composition and molecular functionalities, considering structural and dynamical effects, thus providing a detailed characterization of the intermolecular interactions and the possible formation of microheterogeneities in the considered systems."
1,Methods,"Hydrogen bonding was firstly analyzed by DFT calculations using ORCA program [31] with B3LYP [32,33] functional and 6–311++G(d,p) basis set. Dispersion corrections were calculated by using Grimme's method (DFT-D3) [34]. Monomers and 1:1 dimers were studied by doing structural relaxation. In the case of dimers, homo and heteroassociations were built, and all the possible hydrogen bonding sites were considered. The interaction energy for dimers, ΔE, was calculated as the energy difference between the dimer energy and the sum of the corresponding monomers, considering basis set superposition error as corrected using counterpoise procedure [35]. The topological characteristics of hydrogen bonding were analyzed according to Bader's Atoms in a Molecule theory (AIM [36]) using MULTIWFN software [37]. MD simulations were carried out with MDynaMix v.5.2 [38] software, employing the force field parameterization reported in S1 (Supplementary information). The systems used for MD simulations of BA + cosolvent mixtures are reported in Table S2 (Supplementary information) and were designed to study the binary mixtures in the full composition ranges. Initial cubic simulation boxes were built with Packmol [39] program, considering low density systems (0.7 g cm−3 for all the mixtures). Simulations in the NPT ensemble at 298 K and 1 bar were carried out in two steps starting for a 1 ns equilibration simulation (assured by the evolution of the total potential energy) and followed by 10 ns production runs. The Tuckerman–Berne double time step algorithm [40] (1 and 0.1 fs for long and short time steps) was considered for solving the equations of motion, Ewald method [41] (15 Å for cut-off radius) for the treatment of electrostatic interactions and Lennard-Jones cross-terms (15 Å cut-off) were calculated according to Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. The analysis of MD trajectories to provide insights on the structuring and dynamics of hydrogen bonding was carried out using TRAVIS software [42]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,DFT study,"3.1 DFT study In a first stage of the research, the properties of hydrogen bonds were studied by DFT calculations of 1:1 molecular clusters considering homo (BA – BA and COS - COS) and heteroassociations (BA - COS), for different interaction sites (Figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Information). Previous studies on the conformational distribution of BA have showed prevalence of gauche conformer over other conformers in gas phase [43]. Nevertheless, the energy differences between the available conformers, and thus the torsional barriers among them are lower than 9 kJ mol−1, therefore a freely rotating model for BA is a suitable approach [44]. This is manifested in the development of BA-BA hydrogen bonding, results in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Information) show that hydrogen bonding is developed between two different isomers with O to H distance (1.87 Å) pointing to strong interaction as quantified by the large interaction energy (Table 1 ). The AIM analysis of the interaction shows the formation of a binary critical point (BCP), (3,-1) type according to Bader's [37], in the bond path connecting O and H atoms developing hydrogen bonding. The topological analysis of hydrogen bonding according to AIM theory was done considering the electron density, ρ, and the corresponding Laplacian, ∇2 ρ, at the BCP in the hydrogen bonding bond path, Table 1. Koch and Popelier [45] proposed a group of criteria [46] for quantifying hydrogen bonding strength according to AIM parameters. The first criterion requires the development of a bond path and one BCP along the hydrogen to acceptor oxygen direction, which is fulfilled for the BA-BA interaction. The ρ values for hydrogen bonds are in the 0.002 to 0.034 a.u., with the larger the stronger the interaction, thus ρ value for BA-BA interaction are close to the upper limit of the range, thus pointing to medium to strong interaction as quantified by the large interaction energy for the BA-BA dimer. The positive sign of ∇2 ρ indicates charge accumulation in the region involving hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, thus showing shared-shell interactions, with values for BA-BA in agreement with the strength of hydrogen bonds. In the case of COS-COS homoassociations, interaction energies for 1:1 dimers are large but lower than for BA-BA ones, thus pointing to slightly weaker interactions. Nevertheless, all the considered COS can develop self‑hydrogen bonding (Fig. S1, Supplementary Information) with interaction distances lower than 1.9 Å. Likewise, all COS-COS interactions are characterized by the development of BCPs pointing to hydrogen bonds of medium strength, Table 1. In the case of 12PRO, the presence of two hydroxyl groups leads to several mechanisms of interaction (Fig. S1, Supplementary information), with stronger interactions when bot hydroxyl groups in positions 1 and 2 are simultaneously involved in the development of hydrogen bonds with a neighbor molecule. The DFT analysis of BA – COS hetroassociations (Fig. S2, Supplementary Information) show the development of intermolecular hydrogen bonding with similar characteristics to those for BA – BA. Interaction energies for BA – COS pairs are larger (in absolute value) than those for COS – COS, except for 12PRO-12PRO, and lower than for BA-BA. Likewise, larger binding energies are obtained when BA acts as hydrogen bonding donor (P1 for 1PRO, 2PRO and 2PE) than when BA acts as acceptor, which is justified by smaller O to H distances and lower ρ and ∇2 ρ values. In the case of 12PRO, BA acting as hydrogen bond donor leads to larger interaction energies and the possibility of developing simultaneous interactions with both hydroxyl groups in positions 1 and 2, P4 (Table 1 and Fig. S2, Supplementary information), increases binding energy. For BA – 2PE interactions, although both molecules are very similar, BA acting as donor leads to a stronger interaction. Therefore, the strength of interactions follows the ordering (in absolute value) BA – BA > BA – COS > COS – COS, although the energy difference between the stronger and weaker interaction is just 17 kJ mol−1, which show an almost flat potential energy surface for the hydrogen bonding between all the possible interaction sites, thus presence of the different types of all the intermolecular forces may be expected competing in the studied liquid mixtures."
4,MD simulations,"3.2 MD simulations The MD simulations allow to predict relevant thermophysical properties for BA + COS liquid mixtures as a function of mixture composition. Densities were predicted at 298 K and 0.1 MPa in the full composition range, Table S2 (Supplementary Information) and Fig. 2a. Values for pure compounds are compared with literature data [47–49], thus showing suitable predictions with deviations lower than 2% from experimental data with MD slightly overpredicting density data for pure compounds. The density vs. mixture mole fraction as reported in Fig. 2a shows a non-linear behavior, thus BA + COS systems lead to deviations of ideality in a thermodynamic sense because of the development of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This effect may be quantified through the predicted excess molar volume (V E ), which was evaluated from predicted density data and the corresponding thermodynamic definition, Table S2 (Supplementary Information) and Fig. 2b. The prediction of V E is not a simple task because this property is largely dependent on several factors such as extension and strength of intermolecular forces, molecular packaging and molecular size effects, and their changes upon mixing, thus being very sensitive to force fields parameterizations. Results reported in Fig. 2b show large and negative V E for all the studied systems and mixture compositions, with minima at roughly equimolar compositions. The comparison of these V E MD predicted data with literature experimental data shows reasonable agreement. Ali et al. [50] reported experimental V E for BA +1PRO showing negative values in the whole composition with minimum at x(BA) = 0.4 being −0.42 cm3 mol−1, which is in suitable agreement with results in Fig. 2b (minimum of −0.31 cm3 mol−1). In the case of BA +2PRO, Yeh et al. [48] reported experimental V E at 298.15 K with minimum at x(BA) = 0.45 being −0.62 cm3 mol−1, which agrees with the minimum −0.59 cm3 mol−1 obtained from MD simulations. Therefore, MD predicts V E in the ordering (in absolute vale) 2PRO > 1PRO in agreement with experimental data. Regarding BA +12PRO experimental data are absent in the literature but it may be considered a reasonable prediction that V E follows the 1PRO > 12PRO > 2PRO (in absolute value), Fig. 2b. In the case of BA +2PE, Yeh et al. [48] predicted negative V E value in the whole composition range with minimum at equimolar composition being −0.798 cm3 mol−1 at 298.15 K, which is larger than the −0.45 cm3 mol−1 obtained from MD (Fig. 2b), thus MD simulations underpredicts V E . Therefore, MD simulations prediction of volumetric properties of the studied systems can be considered as reasonably accurate, capturing most of the molecular level features in spite of the transferability of the used force field parameters (Table S1, Supplementary Information). The predicted volumetric properties show that BA + COS mixtures are largely non-ideal system, which points to the development of very efficient intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The molecular level roots of this behavior can be inferred from MD simulations, which allow a detailed nanoscopic description of the structuring in the considered BA + COS mixtures as a function of mixtures composition beyond the 1:1 dimers models used for DFT calculations. Although V E should be strongly dependent on the developed hydrogen bonding, it should be remarked that additional effects, such as steric and molecular packing, should contribute to this property, but they should develop a minor role in comparison with hydrogen bonding, in which the analysis will be centered in the following sections. The molecular arrangements in the mixtures were firstly analyzed by considering radial distribution functions, RDFs. As DFT results have proved the development of homo and heteroassociations, RDFs considering relevant hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor sites were considered for RDFs to analyze interactions. Results in Fig. 3a to e show RDFs for BA – COS interactions considering Ob (BA) and H1 (in OH site of COS) sites, showing the development of a very intense and narrow peak at 1.9 Å for all the COS and mixtures composition, which agree with DFT results confirming BA – COS hydrogen bonding in the full composition range. The first RDF peak for Ob(BA) – H1(COS) interactions is followed by a second weaker one at 3.5 Å, which in spite of being less intense than the first one indicates further interactions beyond the 1:1 direct contacts. Additionally, this second RDF peak will have contributions from the interaction between the oxygen of the hydrogen donor and the hydrogen of the acceptor site [51]. The effect of the type of COS on the Ob(BA) – H1(COS) is almost negligible, with very minor changes in peaks intensity. Results in Fig. 4a show that Ob(BA) – H1(COS) RDFs are equal for 1PRO and 2PRO containing mixtures, which agrees with DFT results in Table 1 that the strength of interaction between BA and both alcohols is almost the same. For 12PRO, the Ob(BA) – H1(COS) peaks intensity is lower than for 1PRO and 2PRO, which agrees with slightly weaker interactions as predicted from DFT. Moreover, the comparison of results in Fig. 3c and d confirms that BA is able to develop equivalent hydrogen bonding both with OH groups in positions 1 and 2 or the alcohol chain, and thus hydrogen bonding through both sites is present in the liquid mixtures. In the case of 2PE, the Ob(BA) – H1(COS) peaks intensity is the largest one, which agrees with the strongest interactions with BA, Table 1. Likewise, the Ob(BA) – H1(COS) peaks are maintained in the whole composition range, thus confirming that BA – COS are hydrogen bonded in the whole composition range. Regarding RDFs corresponding to homoassociations, for BA – BA pairs (Ob-Hb sites, Fig. 3f to i) peaks with shapes and positions analogous to those for BA – COS are inferred. The intensities of BA – BA peaks are lower than those for BA-BA peaks and the effect of the type of COS on RDFs is almost negligible with a slight decrease in peaks intensity for 12PRO, Fig. 4b, thus the presence of COS does not hinder BA self-association in spite of the development of extensive BA – COS hydrogen bonding. The mixture composition has only effect on peaks intensity, as a dilution effect, but BA is self-associated even for highly diluted solutions. For the case of COS – COS interactions, Fig. 3j to n, analogous peaks to those for BA – BA and BA – COS interactions are inferred, although the peaks intensities are larger. The type of COS affects COS – COS interactions, thus RDFs are different specially for 12PRO, which shows the weaker peaks, Fig. 4c. In the case of 12PRO, several types of interactions are inferred and results in Fig. 3l and m show that O1-H1 and O2-H2 interactions show equivalent RDFs, whereas for O1-O2 hydrogen bonding (Fig. S3, Supplementary information) interactions are also developed. The effect of composition in COS – COS RDFs is manifested as a weakening of the corresponding peaks by a dilution effect, as the peaks maxima position are maintained upon dilution. Therefore, the structuring of the considered BA – COS liquid mixtures are characterized by the development of BA -BA, BA-COS and COS – COS Interactions in the whole composition range. The integration of RDFs allows to calculate the so-called solvation numbers, N, i.e. the number of atoms around a central one as a function of distance, Fig. 5 . The composition evolution of N follows a linear trend for all the considered COS and for all the possible molecular combinations, thus pointing to a dilution effect in the local composition around each type of molecule. The solvation shells around BA molecules are rich in BA even for highly diluted solutions, as showed by the larger N values for BA – BA pairs (Ob-Hb) than for BA – COS (Ob – H1), and this enrichment in BA increases with increasing BA content as the COS presence in the BA solvation vanishes. In the case of solvation around central COS molecules, results in Fig. 5 confirm that the first shell is rich in COS and poor in BA in the whole composition range, even for highly diluted mixtures. These results point to a certain heterogeneity at a local level, with the first solvation shells around each type of compound tending to be enriched with the same type of compound, thus developing prevailing homoassociations by hydrogen bonding (BA – BA and COS – COS) with lower presence of heteroassociations with the countermolecule. The heterogeneities were quantified also by excess coordination numbers inferred from calculated N values, which confirm a large excess of BA molecules around a central BA, Fig. S5 (Supplementary Information). This effect is maintained for all the studied COS, following the same trends, and although showing heterogeneity limited to the first solvation shell, i.e. very local effect, it should have a large effect on the nanoscopic properties of these mixtures. RDFs showed the development of strong interactions by hydrogen bonding in the studied mixtures but further details on the mechanisms of interactions may be inferred from Spatial Distribution Functions (SDFs), Fig. 6 . BA and COS compete and occupy distributions around the corresponding interaction sites with similar spatial arrangements. For the case of BA, Fig. 6a to d, SDFs show concentrations around the BA hydroxyl site (Ob) both of neighbor BA and COS molecules, in agreement with RDFs. Nevertheless, the intensity of SDFs for BA around BA is larger than for COS, thus pointing to larger presence of BA molecules. It should be remarked that the average structure of BA (the one reported in Fig. 6a to d) shows the prevailing presence of gauche conformer, which is the lowest energy conformer [44], and the presence of two separated high density spots for SDFs above the Ob atom indicates that OH group is able to rotate for accommodating the development of hydrogen bonding both with BA and COS molecules. In the case of COS, Fig. 6e to h, distribution around the available OH sites is inferred, with larger concentration of COS molecules, thus pointing to COS – rich solvation shells. Highly structured fluids are inferred and the real time motion of molecules was quantified through the van Howe correlation functions (VHF), which measures the probability for an atom at r = 0 at t = 0 to find another atom at distance r and at time t. The VHF results for BA(Ob) – COS (H1) pairs are reported in Fig. 7 . The time evolution reported in Fig. 7a to d shows peaks evolving to unity as expected but with merging of first and second peaks, thus showing how both peaks are dynamically coupled. The 2D results in Fig. 7e to h confirm the dynamical coupling between first and second neighbor molecules around a central BA one, the spots corresponding to first neighbor (red one) and the one corresponding to the second peak are connected by another spot (blue one), thus pointing to dynamically replacement of the solvation sphere, i.e. once a BA molecule loses its first neighbor it is immediately replaced by the second neighbor, which becomes then first neighbor, to develop a new BA – COS hydrogen bond. This dynamical behavior is maintained for all the considered COS with analogous characteristics. The extension of hydrogen bonding was quantified in Fig. 8 for the most relevant interacting pairs. BA-BA, BA-COS and COS-COS hydrogen bonding is produced in the whole composition range. For COS rich mixtures (x(BA) < 0.5) the prevailing trend of COS to be self-associated is maintained but accompanied by a large number of BA-COS interactions. In the case of BA rich mixtures (x(BA) > 0.5), there is a large trend of BA molecules to self‑hydrogen bonding with lower extension of BA-COS interactions. Therefore, there is a large trend of BA molecules to develop self-association whereas when BA molecules are in low concentration, they can develop efficient interaction with COS. The behavior is almost independent of the position of the hydroxyl group in COS, analogous results for 1PRO and 2PRO (Fig. 8a and b), and also the presence of two hydroxyl groups in 12PRO (Fig. 8c). In the case of 2PE, Fig. 8d, as both BA and PE are very similar molecules there are not remarkable differences between PE and BA rich mixture, thus an almost linear evolution of the number of hydrogen bonds is inferred with mixture composition. The characteristics of BA – COS hydrogen bonding was analyzed in detail by the so-called combined distribution functions (CDFs), which consider evolution of radial and angular distribution functions for donor and acceptor sites, Fig. 9 . A first spot (red in Fig. 9) corresponding to the first peak in RDFs (Fig. 3) at roughly 1.9 Å, paired with a donor-acceptor angle of 175°, thus this interaction corresponding to the hydrogen bonding of BA with its first neighbor is characterized by an almost linear hydrogen bond. A second spot in Fig. 9 correspond to the next neighbor placed at 3.5 Å, with a donor – acceptor angle of roughly 45°. Therefore, the dynamic coupling between first and second neighbor inferred from VHF in Fig. 7 should be accompanied by a rotation of the second neighbor when BA lost its contact with the first neighbor to develop a new hydrogen bonding. The distance and angle criteria inferred from results in Fig. 9 allow to calculate the Dimer Autocorrelation Functions (DACF) for BA – COS pairs, i.e. the possibility of a particular hydrogen bond being intact at time τ when it was intact at time 0, Fig. 10 . The intermittent dynamics being slightly dependent on the type of COS, with faster reforming dynamics for 1PRO/2PRO than for 12PRO/BE, probably because the reorientational dynamics inferred from CDFs in Fig. 9 hinders larger and bulkier 12PRO/BA to leave positions around a central BA molecule. Likewise, results in Fig. 10 shows fast dynamics for BA – COS hydrogen bonds for all the considered COS. The dynamics and characteristics of hydrogen bonds in BA – COS should stand on the strength of each possible intermolecular interactions, which are quantified in Fig. 11 for the mixtures composition evolution of intermolecular interaction energies, E inter . The reported E inter follow a parallel pattern to the number of hydrogen bonds in Fig. 8, with large values for E inter corresponding to BA – COS in COS rich mixtures and BA rich mixtures dominated by BA – BA self-association. Larger values for BA-COS E inter are inferred for 12PRO, because of hydrogen bonding both with hydroxyl groups in 1 and 2 positions, and also for BA-PE interactions because the similarities between both molecules allow efficient interactions by hydrogen bonding. The strength and extension of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the studied mixtures should largely affect the molecular mobility of the involved molecules, which is quantified through the self-diffusion coefficients, D, calculated from mean square displacements and Einstein's equation, Fig. 12 . D values for pure compounds inferred from MD simulations are in good agreement with experimental literature data, Table 2 , thus providing a further validation of the proposed MD methodology and forcefields. The D vs x behavior reported in Fig. 12 follows non-linear patterns for all the considered COS. Although the D values for BA are slightly larger, Fig. 12a, than for all the COS, Fig. 12b, the differences are very minor and thus confirm the paired diffusion because of the development of BA – COS hydrogen bonding. A similar behavior for 1PRO and 2PRO is established, providing the larger diffusion rates among the studied COS, followed by 12PRO, which agrees with the larger E inter as reported in Fig. 11, and then for PE, which shows the slower diffusion rates, which is reasonable considering E inter and steric effects hindering molecular mobility. Therefore, although the extension and nature of the developed hydrogen bonding in BA-COS systems follows similar trends for all the considered COS, the strength of these interactions is COS-dependent, thus leading to different molecular mobility in spite of the presence of extensive hydrogen bonding, especially considering BA-COS interactions, and to non-ideal behavior as reported in Fig. 2."
5,Conclusions,"The properties and intermolecular forces in benzyl alcohol + (1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1,2-propanediol or 2-phenylethanol) mixtures were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. DFT study quantified the strength and topological properties of the different types of hydrogen bonding, and showed similar characteristics in terms of energy for homo and heteroassociations, thus predicting competing behavior in the liquid state. The reported results showed the nature of intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the development of extensive intermolecular interactions both homo and heteroassociations, being largely dependent on the type of cosolvent. The trend to develop heteroassociations prevails for benzyl alcohol poor mixtures whereas for benzyl alcohol rich mixtures homoassociations are prevailing. The nature of hydrogen bonding is largely dynamic with quick replacement of neighbor molecules in interaction sites upon reforming for maintaining the interaction, thus coupling consecutive solvation shells. The composition evolution of the hydrogen bonding extensions as well as for the interaction energies lead to the non-ideality of the considered mixtures, which show negative deviations from Raoult's law because of the efficient and extensive heteroassociations between the involved molecules."
