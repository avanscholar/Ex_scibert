0,Introduction,"Coal, oil, natural gas-based fossil fuel resources have been the cornerstone of human development. Fig. 1 illustrates the world's total primary energy supply in 2018. The current world is primarily fueled by fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, and oil, all non-renewable sources. Moreover, nuclear energy contributes to some extent. Biofuel and waste, as the leading resource other than non-renewable energy, accounted for 9.29% in 2018. However, the over-exploitation and use of fossil resources have led to the massive emission of greenhouse gases, thus causing a rise in global temperatures in the past decades. In response to the critical issue of global climate change, the concept of zero carbon emissions has been widely accepted by academia and industry worldwide. Hence, wind and solar energy as the representative of zero-carbon, renewable energy have been developed significantly. However, organic chemicals and high-performance fuels remain produced from carbon-based feedstocks [1,2]. Since the beginning of 2020, COVID-9 has swept the world, hitting the global economy hard. Since then, countries around the world have announced development strategies and policy measures related to the energy sector in the process of economic recovery, like promoting the decarbonization process, accelerating the withdrawal of fossil fuels, promoting the development of new industries, and using clean, sustainable energy as the engine of economic recovery. Plant-based biomass is an abundant carbon-neutral and renewable organic carbon resource, which as a part of alternative fossil materials, shows a good application prospect. Hierarchically utilizing or studying must be one way to use biomass. It can be separated into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin fractions. Cellulose and hemicellulose consisting of D-glucopyranose monomer units are the sources for various platform chemicals like levulinic acid (LVA), 5-hydroxymethylfuran (HMF), and furfural to be derived. Furthermore, lignin is cross-linked phenolic polymers in the form of phenylpropanoids, can be the source of hydrocarbon compounds like olefins or aromatic derivatives (Fig. 2 ). Compared to fossil sources, the organic carbon in biomass is of much higher oxygen content. Therefore, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a common strategy to convert biomass feedstocks to high-value products, enabling them to perform the properties of petroleum-based products. Owing to the complex composition of natural lignocellulosic biomass, research on the catalytic hydrogenation of model compounds such as (hemi)cellulose, hexose, furans, organic acid, lignin, and other bio-derivatives contribute to the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and provide an excellent theoretical basis for the industrialization of raw lignocellulosic hydroprocess. Moreover, the molecular structures and the containing groups of model compounds are different, resulting in a massive challenge for selective synthesis of desired HDO products. Thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) with heterogenous catalysts is a conventional upgrading method for HDO of oxygenated chemicals in the petrochemical industry, which is also applied to the HDO process of biomass compounds. Typically, TCH reaction can be simplified to the following processes: reactant molecules including biomass compounds and H2 are activated after adsorption on the catalyst surface; afterwards effective collision between these activated intermediates occur to yield desired products. Therefore, in addition to the influence of reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, solvents, etc., designing specific catalysts is critical to improving the activity and selectivity of TCH reaction. Electrochemical hydrogenation provides much-needed insights into the electron transfer mechanisms and synthesis of selective chemicals. Recently, electrochemical technology has received great attention. The electrochemical method is the process either caused or accompanied by the movement of electric current and involving the passage of electrons between two substances (electrode and electrolyte). The electrochemical process has broad applications in various fields such as fuel cells, chemical synthesis, photocatalytic, energy storage, and gas production. The advantages of electrochemical technology include mild operating conditions, being environmentally friendly, and low cost. The challenge to improve electrochemical hydrogenation of biomass should be considered at the same time, the issue as following features: (1) the relationship of electro-interaction of an organic molecule; (2) effect of the transformation of electrons between the electrode surface and biomass molecule; (3) the external potential was applied for a chemical reaction; (4) the controlling effect of specific substrates (such as surface area, particle size, etc.) that are active in aqueous and organic compounds; (5) less stringent requirements for catalysts, electrocatalysts (catalysts can be deposited on working electrode) have better reactivity and catalytic efficiency; (6) the chemical redox species are provided internally [3]. Thus, electrochemical is one of the promising technologies that can expand the use of renewable electrical energy in a chemical process and practical in use for industry. In addition, this technology aims to reduce energy climate by synthesis biomass feedstock coupling electrocatalytic reduction via renewable energy such as lignocellulose biomass. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of biomass is a technology for synthesizing valuable chemicals via reductive processing [4]. In this review paper, we explained on electrocatalytic hydrogenation reaction of biomass such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and their derivatives. Furthermore, the recent researches in this field were included as well as summarized for perspective in future research."
1,Thermal catalytic hydrogenation of lignocellulosic biomass,
2,The conversion of lignocellulose and derivatives,"2.1 The conversion of lignocellulose and derivatives Cellulose, a macromolecular polysaccharide composed of D-glucose with β-1,4 glycosidic bonds, is a major component of plant cell walls and accounts for 40–60% of lignocellulosic biomass, making it one of the essential biomass resources [5]. The high polymerization degree of raw cellulose ranges from 6000 to 8000, leading the poorly water solubility, which increases the difficulty of cellulose utilization. Thermal decomposition, including pyrolysis and liquefaction, is a typical method for depolymerizing cellulose to produce gaseous fuels and bio-oils. In general, the composition of thermally treated products is complex and has a reasonably high oxygen content [6,7]. Therefore, HDO is highly desired for upgrading these oxygenates. So far, a variety of catalysts have been used for catalytic pyrolysis of biomass, such as zeolites, molecular sieves, metal oxides, nonporous materials, and their composites, and the addition of catalysts has substantially enhanced the rate of pyrolysis and improved the selectivity for a particular product [8–10]. In addition to thermal depolymerization methods, hydrolysis of (hemi)cellulose into monosaccharides (C5 and C6 sugars) is a prevalent strategy. Compared to polymers, monosaccharides exhibit higher reactivity benefiting from good water solubility. Thus, further conversion of monosaccharides can lead to a series of high value-added platform compounds, including but not limited to polyols, furans, organic carboxylic acids, etc. As representatives of monosaccharides, glucose and xylose contain hydroxyl groups and aldehyde group with polyol and aldehyde properties. Alcohols are value-added chemicals with a wide range of applications in the food, cosmetic and polymer industries. Owing to the similarity of chemical structures, conversion of glucose and xylose into polyols such as sorbitol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, ethylene glycol, etc., through catalytic hydrogenation is in the route relatively easy to achieve [11,12]. In addition, employing an acid-catalyzed dehydration process, glucose (xylose) can be converted to 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural, which are furans with a basic structure of oxygenated five-membered heterocycles. They are essential biochemical platform compounds that can be selectively converted into a wide variety of high-value-added chemicals [13]. For instance, 1,2-pentanediol and 1,5-pentanediol can be selectively synthesized via tuning the catalytic hydrogenolysis C-O bond in the ring of furfural. The aldehyde group in furfural is readily hydrogenated to yield furfuryl alcohol (FA). The further hydrogenation of the ring of furan in FA would produce tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA). Moreover, HMF and FA with hydroxymethyl groups can be hydrolyzed or alcoholized to produce levulinic acid (LVA) and corresponding esters. The existence of acetyl and carboxyl groups allows LVA to have good reactivity. Therefore, γ-valerolactone (GVL) is the major hydrogenation product. Lactic acid (LA) is an active cellulose-derived hydroxy carboxylic acid, the feedstock for biodegradable plastic manufacturing. Regulating the hydrogenation and hydrolysis processes of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, LA can be converted into 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) and propionic acid (PA) [12,14]. Lignin has a rigid polymer cross-linked 3D irregular structure, which constitutes three main phenolic units, including guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S) and p-coumaryl (H)[15]. Fig. 3 demonstrates the typical structure of lignin and three primary monomers units. The central units are connected randomly by C–O linkage bond (β-O-4, α-O-4, 4-O-5) or C–C bond (β-5, β-1, β-β, 5–5). [16]. The β-O-4 bond is the most abundant bond (especially in hard wood) due to its labile nature [16]. Through pyrolysis of lignin model compounds, Drage et al. concluded that the C-O bond of β-aryl ether type being cleaved is prior to the side of aryl methoxyl groups [17]. Ether bond is a key reason for the liquefaction of lignin. Lignin consists of 69% of β-O-4 ether bonds, which could theoretically yield a maximum of 36% of monomers [18]. However, the amorphous structural, compositional features of lignin and different types of lignins are dominant factors for the degradation process. The industrial applications of lignin are limited critically due to its complex nature and chemical structure."
3,Catalytic hydrogenation,"2.2 Catalytic hydrogenation 2.2.1 Hydrogenation of cellulose and glucose Since the products of direct pyrolysis and liquefaction of cellulose are highly complex, hydrogenation is an effective way for selective synthesis of combustible fuel or high value-added chemicals, which has attracted wide attention [19] (Table 1 ). Cellulose can be converted into combustible gas by hydrogenation, and methane is one of the ideal products. Hydrothermal gasification mainly uses the unique fluid properties of supercritical water or subcritical water, in which cellulose with complex structure can be degraded rapidly, causing a continuous reaction. Water exists as the solvent and produces in-situ H to provide hydrogen sources [20,21]. Cellulose could be hydrothermally converted into methane, CO2, H2 at 380 °C with Ni/Al-SiO2 as catalyst (entry 1). In general, the main problems are the wide distribution of products, poor selectivity, and more by-product CO2 [22–24]. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement with extra hydrogen donors. The process for cellulose hydrogenation, including hydrolysis, hydrogenation, decarbonylation etc., is complex. To enhance the cellulose methanation, catalytic cleavage of C-C and C-O bonds via hydrogenolysis is pivotal. Wang et al. reported that cellulose was hydrogenated using Ru/C as a catalyst and achieved 88.1% methane yield at 220 °C with 1 MPa H2 [25,26] (entry 2). The hydrolysis of cellulose was suggested as a rate-determining step. Consideration of the cost-effectiveness, Ni-based catalyst is the substitute for methane production. Williams et al. adopted a two-stage pyrolysis-catalytic hydrogenation reactor for cellulose methanation [27] (entry 3). The feedstock was first pyrolyzed at a high temperature to generate gaseous products, and then H2 was injected to conduct the hydrogenation process with Ni/Al2O3 as the catalyst. This strategy is also applicable to catalytic hydrogenation of lignin for the synthesis of methane. Moreover, in light of the safety risks of gaseous H2 during transportation and use, non-combustible, eco-friendly and renewable H2 donor is highly desired [28]. Our group reported that in-situ hydrogen production from water decomposition would be enhanced via Zn as a reductant. Thus cellulose was available to be hydrogenated, which was catalyzed by Raney Ni at 325 °C. 73.8% yield of methane was achieved [28](entry 4). In contrast to the methanation of cellulose, inhibition of over hydrogenolysis of C-C bond benefits the selectivity of polyols. Hydrolysis and hydrogenation are significant processes for polyols production (Fig. 4 ). Sels et al. combined Cs salts of heteropoly acids (HPA) and Ru/C as a bifunctional system for hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose to hexitols. 90% yield of hexitols was obtained at 170 °C The role of Cs-HPA is not only to catalytic hydrolyze cellulose but also to suppress hydrogenolysis side reaction [29] (entry 5). Ru/hyper crosslinked polystyrene catalyst was developed and gave a 50% yield of hexitols in subcritical water [30] (entry 6). The authors suggested that the appropriate H3O+ and OH− concentration improve the hydrolysis of cellulose and promote the selectivity of hexitols. In order to combine acidic and metallic sites, Liu et al. developed a bifunctional Ru/CCD-SO3H. The synergistic effect between metallic Ru and sulfonic groups was considered to promote the production of sorbitol, 63.8% yield was obtained at 180 °C [31] (entry 7). In addition, the synthesis of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) and ethylene glycol (EG) derived cellulose has been widely studied. Apart from the cellulose hydrolysis process, regulating the breakage of the C-C bond and suppressing humin formation make the synthesis of diols a vast challenge [32]. A breakthrough work was conducted via Zhang and coworkers. They reported a Ni-W2C/AC catalyst exhibiting 49.8 wt% yield of EG derived from hydrogenation of cellulose [33] (entry 9). Since then, a series of W-based catalysts were developed, such as Ni-WO3/SBA-15 [34], Raney Ni-H2WO4 [35], Ru/AC-WO3 [36] for EG production (entries 10–12). The role of W species was confirmed to tune the retro-aldol condensation (RAC) of hydrolysis intermediates which is the degradation step to yield C2-C4 small molecules [37]. Because the acidic and basic sites in the catalyst benefit from the RAC, Fu et al. prepared a weakly basic Co/CeOx, and achieved 55.2% yield of EG and 33.9% yield of 1,2-PDO [32] (entry 8). The Con+-Ox-Ce3+ base-acid pairs not only balanced the hydrolysis and RAC steps, but also hindered the humins formation. Liang et al. reported that CuCr catalyst was combined with Ca(OH)2 as cocatalyst showed good catalytic activity, 42.6% and 31.6% yields of 1,2-PDO and EG were achieved, respectively [38] (entry 13). Solid base Ca(OH)2 as a promoter facilitated the cleavage of C-C bond via RAC process. Our group was also carried out 1,2-PDO production from glucose with Pd/C as catalyst and water as hydrogen donor. Zn as metallic reductant to decompose water to provide H2. The synergistic effect between Pd/C and in-situ formed ZnO was observed to promote isomerization of glucose, 33.3% yield of 1,2-PDO was obtained [39] (entry 14). 2.2.2 Hydrogenation of furan-based compounds As the main dehydration products of hexoses and pentoses, furfural and HMF containing oxygenated five-membered heterocyclic structures are important chemical platform intermediates. Hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis of the furan ring, aldehyde, or hydroxyl group enables the synthesis of a range of high value-added chemicals from furan-based compounds [9] (Table 2 ). Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) is a fully hydrogenated product that is a versatile solvent in the chemical industry [40]. In general, the synthesis of THFA requires two steps, hydrogenation of aldehyde to hydroxy group first, then hydrogenation of furan ring. Cu-Cr catalyst and supported precious catalysts were used, respectively [41]. Our group developed a Ni-Al hydrotalcite-derived alumina-loaded Ni catalyst using NaBH4 as a hydrogen source to convert FA to THFA at a mild condition of 60 °C [40] (entry 1). The added Al species tuning the size of Ni particle, accelerating the hydrogenation of FA. One-step hydrogenation from furfural to THFA is preferable. The cleavage of C-O and C-C resulting from over-hydrogenation is to be avoided. Nakagawa et al. reported a bimetallic PtIr/SiO2 catalyst which afforded a 94% yield of THFA at 2 °C with high pressure of H2 (8 MPa)[42] (entries 2&3). Although Pd/SiO2 showed good activity for C=O hydrogenation, monometallic Ir was suggested the strong adsorption of C=O, which inhibited the hydrogenation of FA. It is worth noting that PdIr alloy exhibited the highest TON for THFA yield. Supported Ni and Cu-Ni catalysts were designed by Chen and coworkers [43]. Bimetallic alloy exhibited better performance than that of supported Ni at 130 °C (entry 4). Moreover, the authors believed that the influence of the supports on the catalytic effect is obvious. Therefore, the synergistic effect of supports and active metal was also investigated. For example, UiO-66 [44], hydroxyapatite [45], MgO modified montmorillonite [46] were prepared to support Pd and Ni particles, which showed a high yield of THFA at mild conditions (entries 5&6). The intense interaction between the metal carriers (SMSI), the high dispersion of the active metal, regulating the acidity of supports is what improve the catalyst stability and activity. In addition to the hydrogenation of furan ring and aldehyde group in furfuran and HMF, cleavage of C-O bond and ring-opening via hydrogenolysis to afford 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-hexanedione (HDN), 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one (3-MCO)[47,48], which has a wide range of applications as biofuels and important intermediates. Dumesic et al. was firstly proposed a two-step approach to produce DMF via hydrolysis of fructose with HCl and hydrogenolysis of HMF over CuRu/C catalyst [49]. Since then, a series of precious Ru and Pd-based catalysts have been developed and have shown good performance, including Ru/Co3O4 [50], Ru/C [51], Pd-Zn/C [52] (entries 8–10). Authors suggested that CoOx species in Ru/Co3O4 and Lewis acidic Zn component played an important role in facilitating the hydrogenolysis of C-O bond to yield DMF. Considering the contribution of support and acidity, the principle was also adopted in designing nonprecious metal catalysts, including Ni and Cu-based catalysts. For example, Ni/ZSM-5 [53], Ni-CoOx/C [54], Cu-Co/Al2O3 [55] exhibited comparable performance to precious catalysts (entries 11–13). For ring-opening products derived from HMF and furfural, Pd/C with CO2 assisted [56], Pd/ZrP [57] were developed to open the ring of furan to synthesize HDN via catalytic hydrogenolysis (entries 14&15). As reported, although Pd0 particle possessed excellent catalytic hydrogenation ability, the suitable acidity provided by CO2 and acidic ZrP is one of the major factors to improve the selectivity of the desired product. Authors believed that the specific Brønsted acidity on ZrP support effectively accelerated the cleavage of the C-O bond in a furan ring [57]. Interestingly, our group constructed a metallic Zn and a high-temperature water system. Water affords hydrogen source via reacting with Zn to convert HMF to HDN and 3-MCO simultaneously with yields of 27.3% and 30.5%, respectively [58] (entry 16). The in-situ hydrogen generated and activated on the surface of ZnO plays an important role. Further, water with a high temperature is a suitable acid/base medium due to its high Kw (ion constant for water) value, which contributed to the hydrogenolysis of the C-O bond. 2.2.3 Hydrogenation of levulinic acid and lactic acid Levulinic acid (LVA) and its corresponding esters are the main products via hydrolysis or alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol and HMF, which contains active acetyl and carboxyl (ester) groups. The hydrogenation process effectively upgrades LVA into biofuels and high value-added chemicals [59,60] (Table 3 ). Thereinto, hydrogenation, and cyclization of LVA to γ-valerolactone (GVL) is the most favourable research area [61,62]. Converting levulinic acid to biofuel GVL requires two steps: hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to produce hydroxyl group, and then esterification of the hydroxyl group with the original carboxyl group to produce GVL with a five-membered ring structure by dehydration [63]. Supported Ru-based catalysts have been extensively employed in GVL production. For example, Ru/ZrO2 was prepared by Shiju et al. by the impregnation method, Ru nanoparticles with 3–4 nm were dispersed homogenously on ZrO2, 99% yield of GVL was obtained at 130 °C, which was contributed by the small particle size of metallic Ru and high loading acidic sites on the surface of ZrO2 [64] (entry 1). Weckhuysen et al. reported that Ru/TiO2 achieved nearly 100% yield of GVL at 150 °C, while the deactivation occurred after the first test [65], which is attributed to the partial reduced TiO2 during the reaction (entry 2). MOFs-derived Ru catalyst was also investigated by Chen et al., the prepared Ru/MIL-101(Cr) not only afforded 99% yield of GVL at 70 °C but also displayed high turnover frequencies (TOFs). The leaching of active Ru species was believed as the critical factor for catalyst deactivation [66] (entry 3). Recently, a single-atom Ru catalyst (RuTiO2@CN) was developed by Han and coworkers, which was prepared via NH2-MIL-125(Ti)[67] (entry 4). 100% yield of GVL was achieved at room temperature, and TOFs of single atom Ru were much higher than that of commercial Ru/C. Fang's study showed that the electron-rich Ru0 could effectively adsorb molecular hydrogen and C=O. The distribution and strength of the acid-base sites can be regulated by modulating the ratio of Zn and Al in the catalyst, which affects the reaction activity and selectivity. The same finding was also confirmed in the use of other multiple catalysts [68] (entry 5). Other precious metal catalysts such as Pd and Ir-based catalysts are also reported. Pd/AlMCM-41 gave 88.5% GVL yield at 240 °C, highly dispersed Pd and acidic sites offered by Al modified MCM-41ensure the excellent performance of hydrogenation of LVA [69] (entry 6). Single-atom Ir@ZrO2@C synthesized from Ir@UiO-66 reached >99% GVL yield in an acid solvent at 180 °C [70] (entry 7). Therefore, the performance of supported precious metal catalysts depends mainly on the well-dispersed active metal sites and the acidity of supports. Similar effects have been observed on nonprecious Cu and Ni-based catalysts. Rode and Hengne investigated Cu/ZrO2 and Cu/Al2O3 for hydrogenation of LA; both the catalyst achieved 99.9% GVL yield at 200 °C [71] (entry 8). However, an obvious metal leaching was observed on Cu/Al2O3 during the reaction, which results in loss activity of the catalyst. At the same time, ZrO2 supported Cu with strong interaction between metal and oxides, to some extent suppressing the leaching process. Ni/montmorillonite was used as catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) catalyst to reduce LVA into GVL with isopropanol as a hydrogen donor at 200 °C [72] (entry 9). Ni loading of catalyst is an overriding factor for the selectivity of GVL. In contrast to LVA, lactic acid (LA) with a C3 molecular structure is prone to synthesizing 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) by hydrogenation to C=O and deoxygenation. In fact, hydrogenation of LA into 1,2-PDO is one of the important steps for diols production from cellulose feedstocks. Hence, the catalysts used in the two hydrogenation processes are comparable. Ru, Cu, and Co-based materials as major catalysts were widely investigated. Hensen et al. prepared a series of Ru catalysts with different supports, including activated carbon, γ-Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and CeO2 [73], in which TiO2 supported Ru nanoparticle gave the highest yield of 1,2-PDO. The authors suggested that the difference in the size of metallic Ru and the Lewis acid sites on the supports influence the hydrogenation process. Tomishige et al. constructed a bimetallic Ru-MoOx/C catalyst for hydrogenation of LA, 95% yield 1,2-PDO was achieved at 120 °C [74] (entry 10). The Mo-modified Ru catalyst displayed 4 times higher TOF than that of Ru/C, but the activities of Mo-modified Rh, Pd, Pt catalysts were deficient. Li et al. developed a Ru-B/TiO2 catalyst for hydrogenation of ethyl lactate, which exhibited over 95% yield 1,2-PDO at 90 °C [75] (entry 11). Dumesic et al. conducted vapour-phase hydrogenation of LA over Cu/SiO2 at 200 °C to achieve 1,2-PDO with 88% yield [76] (entry 12). Dissociative adsorption of LA and hydrogenation of absorbed species on Cu/SiO2 were considered as rate-determine steps. Our group converted LA to 1,2-PDO under hydrothermal conditions using commercial copper oxide as the catalyst and water as the hydrogen source and obtained a high yield of 1,2-PDO of 93%[77] (entry 13). Copper oxide would be reduced to metallic Cu, which is considered a real active site for hydrogenation. Co/SiO2 was prepared to give a 98% selectivity of 1,2-PDO with 90.2% conversion of ethyl lactate [78] (entry 14). A higher percentage of bulk-like Co3O4 in Co/SiO2 presented higher catalytic activity. Du et al. reported a CoB amorphous catalyst fabricated by a simple NaBH4 reduction process [79] (entry 15). Introduction B tuning the charge distribution of the CoB alloy, positive B and negative Co site were responded to the activation of C=O and generate H species, respectively. 2.2.4 Hydrogenation of Lignin and derivatives K. Kashima et al. started to work on lignin liquefaction and discovering catalysts in 1964. After the hydrogenolysis process, they found a mixture of C6-C9 mono-phenolic products that can reach as high as 40% of yield and published on Canadian Patents. A co-catalyst of iron sulfide with another metal sulfide (like Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, or Mo) was used on lignin tars and phenols. The reaction was conducted at 523–723 K with an initial hydrogen pressure of 15.2–45.6 MPa, and around 21% yield of lignin-derived phenol was obtained. While this demonstrates the variant of such research directions, the reproducibility of the experimental results was not well achieved because the composition of lignin was too complex and inconsistent [80]. The conversion of biomass or lignin in particular to BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) is the source of the un-functionalized aromatics, which produce 60% of all aromatic compounds and therefore deserve more attention [81,82]. Regarding lignin depolymerization, the emphasis of the reported studies is mainly on producing chemicals and upgrading bio-oils by catalysts. In 1938, the catalytic reaction was conducted on hardwood lignin by Harris and co-workers [83]. The lignin was reported to react with hydrogen gas with copper-chromium oxide as a catalyst. After that, the catalytic hydrogenation process is used to tailor the functional groups, improve lignin's property, and control the product's distribution [84–86]. Hydro process (including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation) is a common technology for depolymerizing lignin, in which hydrogenolysis is the main reaction on lignin. The summary of thermal catalytic hydrogenation of different types of lignin is presented in Table 4 . For the catalytic hydrogenation of lignin by heterogeneous catalysts, there are several main types of catalysts, like non-metallic catalysts, nickel-based catalysts, noble-metal catalysts, metal oxides, and multi-metal composite catalysts. The researchers mainly focus on the liquefaction and depolymerization of lignin, using different catalysts to yield higher conversion rates and more bio-oil or phenolic products. Lignin liquefaction yields, calculated by the difference of recovered lignin residue, are generally above 50% (Table 4). Ni-based catalyst has been the most popular catalyst used in integrated hydroprocessing of lignin [87], which is more effective for hydrogenolysis reactions with high conversion rates [88]. Noble metal catalysts (Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) showed a significant catalytic activity for hydrogenolysis of C-O ether bonds [89,90] and hydrogenation of aromatic rings in the liquid product (Table 4, entry 7&8). Pepper et al. also studied several catalysts (Raney Ni, Pd/C, Rh/C, Rh/Al2O3, Ru/C, Ru/Al2O3) for hydrogenation of lignin. A significant amount of the original lignin was converted into the monomeric products 4-propylguaiacol and dihydroconiferyl alcohol, with Rh/C showed a maximum yield [91]. The Pd/C yielded 24% of dihydroconiferyl alcohol, whereas Rh/C resulted in producing 4-propylguaiacol and dihydroconiferyl alcohol accounting for 34% of raw lignin. In the absence of a catalyst, the lignin macromolecules were thermally depolymerized due to bond breaking, which limits the hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis reaction to some extent (Table 4, entry 10). In fact, the catalyst and the temperature have a significant effect on the hydrogenation process. High temperatures and pressures are more favourable for heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions, usually at 200–400 °C and an initial hydrogen pressure of 3–10 MPa [92]. Kumar et al. [93] performed the depolymerization of Kraft lignin via NiMo and CoMo catalysts at 350 °C for 4 h with 100 bar initial H2 pressure, 87% of lignin can be converted, and 26.4 wt% of monomers were obtained. However, severe conditions also lead to the formation of char. It was reported that the formation of coke and oligomers was caused by the repolymerization and condensation of intermediates followed by dehydration under the thermal effect [92,94]. More hydrogenation researches were conducted on model compounds of lignin [103,104]. Although model compounds can illustrate basic units and linkage types in the lignin, they cannot substitute the actual folded structure of lignin in the usual sense. When conducting hydroprocess on lignin, hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation occur on the lignin polymer structure, and hydrogen atoms transfer into the free radicals of lignin fractions [105]. Limited research groups focus on the solid residue from lignin hydrogenation [106,107]. Chio et al. mentioned that a temperature above 240 °C could enhance the repolymerization of intermediates of lignin molecules [108]. Shen et al. reported that the partly degraded lignin-containing abundant aliphatic C-H bonds and thermal decomposition started to occur even in the low-temperature range (200–280 °C)[101]. Long et al. investigated the properties of recovered lignin after catalytic decomposition with the synergic function of NaOH and Ru/C. The recovered lignin possessed a lower molecular weight and lower degree of unsaturation [94]. To minimize the occurrence of repolymerization reactions, a combination of mild conditions and precious metal catalysts is more suitable for lignin hydrogenation. Zhang et al. [109] conducted pretreatment on organosolv lignin (EOLacid) and subsequent hydrogenation. Lignin was first dissolved in THF and carried out the hydrogenation at 250 °C for 7 h using Ru/C catalysts. 57 wt% of solid hydrogenated lignin and 26 wt% of coke were obtained. The characterization of hydrogenated lignin was performed to know the structural change of lignin after hydrogenation. As shown from Fig. 5(a), the spectra intensity of most functional groups decreased, especially oxygenated functional groups like hydroxyl group and carbonyl group, an ether bond, and an ester group. However, the aliphatic group alkane, alkene, and methylene both increased. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the TGA results of raw lignin and hydrogenated lignin. Compared to the TG curves, the hydrogenated lignin-formed oligomers can easily be decomposed at low temperatures, ranging from 150 °C to 300 °C, and the peak at around 350 °C increased severely. It infers that after hydrogenation, the lignin becomes reactive to decompose, more compounds can be converted to useful volatiles. After that, fast pyrolysis was performed on a two-stage tubular reactor coupled with GC-TCD/FID; product distribution has shown in Fig. 6 . Compared with raw organosolv lignin, hydrogenated lignin produced less char from 27.5% to around 15%, and olefins yield increased obviously from 5.1 wt% to 9.94 wt%. Other products like methane, alkane, benzene, toluene have a pronounced increase. From this work, the following deductions were concluded: ✓ Hydrogenated lignin has a high ability of thermal decomposed. ✓ Aliphatic groups increased after hydrogenation. ✓ Olefins yield of hydrogenated lignin has double increased from fast pyrolysis."
4,Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass via electrochemical hydrogenation conversion,"2.3 Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass via electrochemical hydrogenation conversion 2.3.1 Fundamental and mechanism of electrochemical hydrogenation Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) has been explored for over a century. The synthetic organic compounds via the electrochemical method have superior advantages over thermocatalytic hydrogenation (TCH) processes [110–112]. Direct reduction of the organic compounds without adsorption onto the electrocatalyst surface has been speculated by the need for a higher cathodic potential to proceed than the surface hydrogenation route and only happens on electrodes with high overpotentials. Hydrogenolysis and/or hydrodeoxygenation of organic compounds can also happen simultaneously in the ECH process to reduce the oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C ratio), which would be added advantage of the ECH process. 2.3.2 Prospects of electrochemical hydrogenation Some important prospects of the ECH process over traditional TCH processes include (i) mild reaction conditions (lower temperature and pressure, which eliminates the need for high energy-intensive processes), (ii) hydrogen generation (continuously obtained from water splitting, avoiding the supply of external H2 gas), (iii) simple operating conditions (controllable current/voltage input), (iv) cleaner process and easy product separation (higher carbon recovery and improved H/C ratios)[113–115]. Moreover, the power required for the ECH process can be integrated with several renewable electric energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro energy. In this regard, ECH of lignocellulosic biomass proceeds towards a sustainable process that could be integrated with renewable energy, promoting the overall efficiency of the biorefinery process [113]. 2.3.3 Reaction mechanisms in electrochemical hydrogenation The electrochemical hydrogenation was inspired by the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a cathodic reaction via a two-electron transfer mechanism. Generally, the reaction based on HER can be performed in different pH electrolytes based on either the Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel mechanisms [116]. Volmer reaction is the combination of proton and surface of catalysts via electrochemical hydrogen atom adsorption. Heyrovsky reaction is electrochemical desorption between hydrogen atoms with proton and electron. Tafel reaction is a chemical of hydrogen desorption to produce a hydrogen molecule. Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel's reaction mechanism explains the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ECH, highly dependent on the electrolyte used in the reaction, and the following equations describe HER. • Chemisorbed hydrogen generation via proton/water reduction Volmer reactions: (1) Acid media : H + + e − + M → MH ads (2) Neutral and basic media : H 2 O + M + e − → MH ads + OH − • Hydrogen desorption via Heyrovsky reactions: (3) Acid media : MH ads + H + aq + e − → H 2 + M (4) Neutral and basic media : MH ads + H 2 O + e − → H 2 + OH − + M • Hydrogen desorption via Tafel reactions: (5) 2MH 2 → H 2 + 2 M The following equations represent a simplified and plausible ECH reaction mechanism involving the elementary steps: adopted from the reference [117]. • Adsorption of the organic reactant on the electrocatalyst surface (S): (6) R = O + S ↔ R = O . S • Hydrogenation between the adsorbed organic reactant and the chemisorbed hydrogen: (7) R = O . S + 2H ∙ S ↔ RH – OH . A + 2S (8) RH – OH . A + 2H ∙ S ↔ R – H 2 . A + H 2 O + 2S • Desorption of the hydrogenated product: (9) RH – OH . S ↔ RH – OH + S (10) R – H 2 . S ↔ R – H 2 + S . The importance of Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel's reaction with respect to the reaction parameters is essential to know more about the reaction progression. The dependences of the current density and the surface coverage on the overpotential would be evaluated for the Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel routes. The Tafel slopes provide insights on the evaluation of rate-determining steps which generally assume extreme coverage of the adsorbed species, whereas the Volmer equation emphasizes electron transfer kinetics [116]. Chemisorbed hydrogen and adsorbed organic reactants play a crucial role in the ECH process, governing the faradaic efficiency (FE). The applied reduction potential across the reaction system generally affects the rate of ECH and could determine the H2 adsorption, whereas H2 adsorption capacity proportionally varies with negative overpotential [118]. Overpotential is an activity parameter at a defined current density. The potential that is applied higher than the thermodynamic redox potential (The voltage obtained for a redox reaction relative to that of hydrogen at standard state) is termed the overpotential, which drives reaction rates. Moreover, the high overpotential depends on the electrocatalyst that corresponds to morphology and surface area. Thus, choosing appropriate electrocatalysts and electrolyte leads to higher reaction rates and conversions in ECH [118,119]. 2.3.4 Typical of electron transfer mechanisms in electrochemical hydrogenation Electron transfer reaction is an essential redox reaction in the initial energy conversion process, in which electrons along with protons are transferred. Electronation directly happens and is followed by a protonation reaction, which may occur in the bulk solution. In terms of electrons transfer reaction, Birch reduction was proposed in 1944 [119]. Birch reduction is an organic reaction used to convert arenes to cyclohexadiene. The solvated electrons add to the aromatic ring to give a radical anion. The added alcohol supplies a proton to the radical anion. Subsequently, similar electrons transfer and protonation happened on the para position. The Birch reduction is generally carried out at a cryogenic temperature. Pyrophoric metal sodium, lithium, and toxic ammonia are needed to form solvated electrons. This reaction has high selectivity. Benkeser reduction is modified from Birch reduction [120]. Lithium or calcium metal and the low molecular weight of alkyl amines are used as sources of electrons. This modified Birch reduction has high reductivity but low selectivity. In comparison, it needs pyrophoric metal lithium and volatile lower molecular weight amines. Operation temperature depends on the boiling point of the amine. Ammonia-free birch reduction is further modified reduction, as shown in Fig. 7 . Peng et al. proposed using crown ether to replace toxic and corrosive ammonia to perform Birch reduction on aromatic rings [121]. It is easy to operate, and crown ether can be recovered after use. Nevertheless, reduction capacity is limited in specific compounds. The above mention Birch reaction and optimized Birch reactions all belong to the two-electron transfer process. For the two-electron transfer process, consecutively occurring by the chemical step separating mechanism (denoted as ECEC: electron transfer, protonation, electron transfer, and protonation) has been proposed more likely than two subsequent protonation step mechanisms (denoted as EECC: electron transfer, electron transfer, protonation, and protonation)[122]. In addition, two-electron transfer mechanisms in electrochemical hydrogenation are described by Eq. (11)–(15)[117]. The electrons are supplied via an electric energy source to stimulate the proton (H+) from the electrolyte solution, while the organic reactant is reduced to the intermediate phase (denoted as M−). Then, the proton reacts to an intermediate phase of organic reactant through chemical protonation and electron transfer, following the electron transfer process to complete the hydrogenation reaction. The specific electron conversion reactions are shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. 8 ). (11) Hydrogen anion generation : R − H → R − + H + (12) Electron transfer : M + e − ↔ M − (13) Chemical protonation : M − + H + → MH (14) Electron transfer : MH + e − ↔ MH − (15) Chemical protonation : MH − + H + → MH 2 Where R represents the hydrogen donor molecules, M denotes the organic reactants. 2.3.5 The roles of electrocatalyst and electrolyte in electrochemical hydrogenation Electrolyte and electrocatalyst play an essential role in an effective electrochemical hydrogenation process. The electrolyte is attributed to providing electrical reaction conductivity, while the electrocatalyst offers active sites for the reactions (chemisorbed organic reactants and protons). Electrolyte and electrocatalyst together possess strong synergy to effect faradic efficiency (FE). A choice of highly active electrocatalyst and a suitable electrolyte is pivotal for hydrogen evolution and protonation reactions. In order to get significant conversions of ECH, the selection of electrocatalyst and electrolyte is a crucial factor to be considered. As mentioned above, the electrocatalyst determines the overpotential to be applied and is responsible for providing the large surface areas for H2 chemisorption and organic reactants adsorption. The electrolyte helps in providing much-needed electrical conductivity for the water-splitting reaction there by producing electrons. Acidic electrolytes favour ECH due to the generation of high proton concentration, thereby increasing the reactive hydrogen radicals [115]. In this regard, acid-tolerant electrocatalysts are advantageous for effective ECH, and the significance of noble and novel metals have a notable impact on effective ECH. Faradaic efficiency, which describes the prevalent use of electrons for ECH over HER [118], could be maximized by the synergy between electrocatalyst and electrolyte. High organic reactant surface adsorption capacities and chemisorbed H2 are hence crucial for productive ECH. Mainly, HER and proton/water reduction reactions are performed in a wide range of pH electrolyte media solutions, which was represented by the Vomer-Heyrovsky-Tafel reaction mechanism (Eqs. (1)–(5)). In the hydrogen evolution, Eqs. (1) and (2) illustrate the formation of adsorbed hydrogen radicals which play a crucial role in the ECH of organics. Meanwhile, the side reactions which co-occur in the electrocatalytic system as described by Heyrovsky reactions (Eqs. (3) & (4)) or via thermal desorption by Tafel reaction, (Eq. (5)) can produce hydrogen gas. Thus, the ECH efficiency is expected to change accordingly to the applied electrolyte and its properties. Most hydrogenation experiments are performed in acidic solutions with protons as the hydrogen source [123]. However, for the raw feedstock, the solubility in the electrolyte is also an essential factor; the reaction rate will be raised with the high dispersion of the reactant. The model compounds, biomass derivatives, cellulose, and hemicellulose can dissolve well in organic solvents, even in acidic aqueous solutions. However, the complex structure of lignin makes it hard to dissolve in common organic solvents and acidic solutions. The more homogeneously lignin is dispersed in the electrolyte, the more accurate and rapid the reaction will be, so solubility must be considered when choosing an electrolyte for lignin. Alkaline solutions are widely used in lignin treatment techniques [124–126]. This is because the alkaline solution is easier to dissolve most kinds of lignin. On the other hand, alkaline solution is easier to promote the oxidation reaction, and electrochemical oxidation of lignin is also one of the standard techniques for lignin depolymerization. In comparison, a strong alkali medium is supposed to be one of the reasons for consecutive oxidations to undesired organic acids and carbon dioxide [127]. Most ionic liquids (ILs) play an alternative role to solutions in the electrochemical area, and their ionic feature can provide the required degree of conductivity. Different types of lignin were extensively depolymerized in the IL electrolytes, and ILs can be fully regenerated, an efficient and sustainable system for lignin conversion [128]. Ionic liquid ([Et3NH][MeSO3]) was found effective for lignin in the electrochemical reaction due to high dissolution and high chemical stability [129]. Moreover, Reichert et al. have used the protic ionic liquid (triethylammonium methanesulfonate) as an electrolyte to electro-oxidize alkali lignin, which can be easily synthesized. PIL has some features, like low vapour pressure, wide temperature window of liquidity, the high solubility of lignin, high electrochemical stability, good proton, and ionic conductivity, always been treated as a promising electrolyte [130]. However, the high cost of ILs, and the concerns as their toxicity to the environment, debate over their greenness, which might limit their application in the field of Green Chemistry [131]. DESs (deep eutectic solvents) are eutectic mixtures of a quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt or hydrogen bond donor. It is a class of novel green solvents exhibiting low vapour pressure, high polar, low freezing point, high thermal stability, low toxicity, low cost, and biodegradability. These features make them attractive solvents for lignocellulosic biomass processing, especially for lignin valorization. Generally, a mixture of choline chloride and urea (DES) is a novel and efficient reaction medium. Choline chloride as hydrogen-bond acceptors and urea as hydrogen-bond donors. It can be simply prepared and after mixture melting point only 12 °C. Besides that, the choline chloride-ethylene glycol mixture (2:1 molar ratio) proved the best DESs to dissolve lignin with 100 g/L solubilities [127]. Di Marino et al. used DES (choline chloride-urea and choline chloride-ethylene glycol) as electrolytes to perform electrochemical oxidation of lignin."
5,Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of cellulose and hemicellulose derivatives,"2.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of cellulose and hemicellulose derivatives Electrocatalytic conversion of biomass feedstocks and biomass-derived organics would be a suitable conversion technology that can bring down harsh reaction conditions and recycle carbon energy resources. Therefore, this section focuses on electrocatalytic conversion, especially electrocatalytic hydrogenation of biomass feedstocks, biomass-derived furans, and biomass-derived organics, including cellulose, cellulose derivatives, hemicellulose derivatives, lignin, and lignin model compounds. The conversion of the substrate, selectivity of the products, Faradaic efficiency, or current efficiency generally be defined by the following Eqs. (16)–(18), and the results are presented in a table format in respective sections. (16) Conversion = moles of reactant consumed Initial moles of reactant x 100 % (17) Selectivity = moles of the desired product Total moles of product the product x 100 % (18) FE = Electrons consumed by hydrogenation of organic compound Total electrons passed x 100 % 2.4.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of glucose and fructose Glucose or fructose are essential building blocks for numerous platform chemicals and liquid fuels having all three essential elements (C, H, &O), and can be produced from renewable biomass resources such as cellulose hydrolysis by acid catalysts [132]. Catalytic hydrogenation of glucose and fructose on heterogeneous catalysts produces high-value hexitols (especially sorbitol and mannitol, respectively), which have versatile applications in the global market [133]. Due to the limitations of high energy consumption, need for molecular hydrogen, and cost expensive processes for catalytic hydrogenation, this review paper presents a glimpse of ECH of glucose or fructose over different electrocatalysts/electrodes to especially for sorbitol production and the comparison to understand the different conversion technologies. The ECH of glucose reports demonstrated that the reduction preferentially occurred on carbonyl functionality of glucose rather than alcohol functionality. The ECH of glucose and fructose has been performed on various electrodes including Ni [134], Pb [134], Cu [134], Au [134], Pb(Hg) [135], Zn [135], Zn(Hg) [136,137], RaNi [137,138], PtRu/C [139], Zn/CNT [140], and ZnFe/CNT [140] and the results are summarized in Table 5 . Kassim et al. have first reported the steady-state formation of sorbitol by reduction of glucose at amalgamated led (Pb(Hg)) and Zn electrodes in aqueous H2SO4 (pH = 7)[135]. The use of Zn electrode compared to Pb(Hg) is slightly superior in FE. The FE was increased to 21% for Zn electrode where as Pb(Hg) exhibited 15%. This increase was attributed to the active surface area of Zn as Pb showed low specific surface area [135]. Pintauro et al. [136] have obtained 39% of FE and 15% yield of sorbitol results with amalgamated Zn electrode compared to Zn electrode reported by Kassim et al. [135]. The differences for the two reports were: increased applied potential, reactor configuration from batch to flow system, and different electrolytes from aq. H2SO4 to aq. NaBr [135,136]. Lessard et al. have studied the activity of RaNi for ECH with high sorbitol selectivities for both batches (95%) and flow (90%) configurations with moderate FE of 57% and 40%, respectively [138]. Low faradaic efficiency corresponding to Zn(Hg) and RaNi was observed when the electrolyte was changed from H2SO4 to CaBr2 [136–138]. The product selectivity and FE of the ECH were affected by the type of electrolyte. However, the specific role was not distinguished due to the lack of proper results in the literature. Kwon et al. have investigated the ECH of glucose over Ni, Au, Cu, and Pb in neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte, only to find out that Pb was active for the sorbitol production [134]. The targeted product of ECH of glucose, i.e., sorbitol over non-precious metal electrodes such as RaNi, Ni, and Pb, have obtained an excessive of 87% selectivities over a wide range of the pH of the electrolytes (2 < pH < 7) comprised of H2SO4, Na2SO4, and CaBr2. The product selectivity and faradaic efficiency were altered by using flow and batch configurations. However, a consistent relationship has not been observed between faradaic efficiency, the reaction configuration, operating parameters of ECH of glucose, and the selectivity of the product as the changes were subtle accordingly to the tested electrode, and proper literature has been lacking on ECH of glucose. 2.4.2 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5-Hydroxy methyl furan (HMF) 5-Hydroxy methyl furan (HMF), a biomass-derived platform chemical, can be obtained by hydrolysis of fructose/glucose using acid catalysts [142]. Having two different functional groups (alcohol and aldehyde) on its molecular structure makes HMF an alternative commodity chemical to fossil fuel-derived platform chemicals to produce value-added chemicals and liquid fuels [142]. The possible hydrogenation products of HMF are (1) 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF), (2) 5-methylfurfural (5-MF), (3) 2,5-dihydroxy methyl tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF), (4) 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), (5) 2,5-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrofuran (DMDHF) and (6) 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) are represented in Scheme 1 [111]. Having such a range of products formation, electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF has attracted much attention in the recent past. Xu et al. summarized the recent catalytic routes for synthesis and up-gradation of biomass-derived 5-HMF and furfural [142]. Their critical review has well reported the different conversion technologies that explain the catalytic transfer hydrogenation, electrocatalytic conversion, and photocatalytic up-gradation [142]. Sneha A et al. presented a comprehensive review of ECH of biomass-derived organics [118]. This review provides complete insights into the ECH of biomass-derived platform chemicals and the lignin derivatives as well. This review focuses on the up-gradation of biomass-derived organics through electrocatalytic hydrogenation to compare with the thermal catalytic hydrogenation and report the metals' activity in two different technologies. The ECH of HMF was mostly influenced by the cathode and electrolyte pH [143]. The electrochemical reduction of HMF was performed on different metal electrodes comprised of Pt, Pd, Au, Zn, Cu [144], Pd [145], Cu [146,147], Ag [146], Cd, Co, Sn, Sb, Pb, Al, Bi, In [143,148], and as well as Ru and Pd deposited on 3D Vanadium nitride [145]. The experimental conditions and product distributions were reported in Table 6 . Kwon et al. have performed the ECH of HMF in the presence and absence of glucose in a neutral solution (0.1 M Na2SO4) and an acidic solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 [143,148]. The exciting findings of these studies are intrigued by the ECH of HMF as the authors have scanned the activity of the metals mentioned above. It has been observed that the cathode effect was minimal under neutral conditions at an analogous set of potentials in the range of −0.5 ± 0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) mainly due to the activation energy, which was hard to achieve in the neutral conditions. Among the metals active towards the ECH of HMF, Ag has exhibited more than 85% selectivity towards DHMF. In neutral conditions, the product distribution followed different paths selectively on different metals. Hydrogenation was progressed on Fe, Ni, Ag, and Cd to form DHMF, whereas hydrogenolysis products were dominant on Co, Au, Cu, Sn, and Sb. Moreover, tuning the applied potential improved the product selectivity over Pd, Al, Bi, and Pb electrodes. Additionally, the selectivity differed on poor metals (Zn, Bi, Pb, and Sb) as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was progressed simultaneously. The presence of glucose improved the selectivity of DHMF on low active metals (Zn, Cd, and In), whereas, on other metals (Bi, Pb, Sn, and Sb), it was still limited [143]. In contrast to neutral conditions, acidic environment (0.5 M H2SO4) reduced the activation energy barriers of ECH of HMF to distinguish the metal catalysts into three groups: (i) metals mainly forming DHMF (Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pb), (ii) metals forming majorly DMDHF (Pd, Pt, Al, Zn, In, and Sb). (iii) or both DHMF and DMDHF accordingly to the applied potentials (Co, Ag, Au, Cd, Sb, and Bi)[148]. Upon observing the dominant activity of Ag metal in neutral conditions (Borate buffer, pH = 9.2), John J et al. studied the efficient and selective reduction of HMF to DHMF through electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques using Ag electrodes [146]. The authors have demonstrated the HMF reaction mechanism to form DHMF and have achieved near 100% selectivity at a constant applied potential of −1.3 V against Ag/AgCl electrode. Comparing two Ag electrodes prepared on Cu foil by galvanic displacement (99% DHMF selectivity & 99% FE) and sputter coating (84% DHMF selectivity & 99% FE) methods to obtain morphologically different catalysts resulted in the superior activity for the galvanic displacement method. Hence, this study demonstrated that the deposition of the same active metal on Cu foil via different techniques also affects the product formation attributing to the availability of the active sites for organic substrates [146]. Roylance and Choi have illustrated the influence of the electrolyte pH to produce 2,5-hexanedione (HD) from ECH of HMF on the Zn electrode [144]. The synthesis of HMF to HD can be achieved by hydrogenolysis of HMF via DMF, which involves reducing aldehyde and alcohol groups to alkane groups and the furan ring opening. The complete shift in the selectivity of the products from HD to DHMF was observed with a change in pH from 2 (acidic, sulfate buffer) to 7.2 (neutral, phosphate buffer). No HD formation was observed at the pH of 7.2, and the authors have demonstrated that this was happened because of the pH effect, not by the anion effect (Sulfate vs. phosphate) on the Zn surface. The authors have also proposed a plausible reaction mechanism on the Zn surface through the important reaction intermediate 5-MF by the Clemmensen reduction and a ring-opening mechanism [144]. After the effect of catalyst selection and pH of the electrolyte was investigated, Li S, et al. reported the paired electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) and electrocatalytic hydrogenation of HMF over Pd/VN (VN- 3D vanadium nitride) hollow nanospheres in the acidic electrolyte (0.2 M HClO4)[149]. Pd/VN catalyst was successfully achieved more than 88% selectivity of DHMTHF, a further hydrogenation product of DHMF. The HMF conversion was reached more than 98% with 86% FE. Using VN as a counter anode to Pd/VN electrode simultaneously, and the anolyte same as catholyte resulted in 96% selectivity of ECO product 2, 5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with 98% HMF conversion and 84% FE. This study can be a route for developing paired electrosynthesis to produce different products using the other metal electrodes active for the ECH of HMF [145]. The selection of cathode metal, varying the structure of the electrocatalyst, and choosing the pH of the electrolyte have dramatically affected the product selectivity of the ECH of HMF. 2.4.3 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LVA) Levulinic acid (LVA) is one of the important platform chemicals that has the potential to be a building block for valeric biofuels,ℽ-valerolactone (GVL), valeric acid (VA), and α-angelica lactone [150–152]. LVA has a carbonyl, and a carboxyl group embedded in its structure makes it participate in multiple reactions, including reduction, esterification, oxidation, substitution, or condensation reactions that were comprehensively reviewed in the literature [151–154]. This review focuses on the catalytic hydrogenation and ECH of LVA. The reaction pathway of ECH of LVA to form VA and GVL is demonstrated in Scheme 2 [155]. To date, only a few metals as electrodes have been studied for ECH of LVA to produce VA mostly over Pb [156–158] electrode and other metals including Cu, Fe, Ni, and C electrodes by Schroder et al. [158]. The results are summarized in Table 7 . In a recent investigation by Xin et al., a selective ECH of LVA to VA or GVL was performed on Pb electrode in both the half-cell (batch) and single electrolysis (flow) cell in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0) at different applied potentials of −1.5 V and − 1.3 V against RHE respectively [156]. The variation of selectivity towards VA and GVL has been reportedly changed over the applied overpotentials and the pH of the electrolyte. In acidic electrolyte, the selectivity of the VA was 100% and 95%, with 51.3% and 18.6% conversion of LVA in the half-cell (FE = 57.1%) and flow cell (FE = 86.5%), respectively. In contrast, in the neutral electrolyte (H2O/K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5), the observed product was GVL only. However, poor HMF conversions of 1.3% & 4.5% and FEs of 6.2% and 18.2%, respectively, were observed for half-cell and flow cells. Higher overpotentials favoured the formation of VA, whereas lower overpotentials were generated [156]. A similar kind of observation was also reported by Qiu et al. [155]. Qiu et al. illustrated an integrated ECH approach of converting forming acid and LVA in a single flow reactor over Pb electrode at −1.5 V vs RHE using a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The reduction of LVA over Pb electrode has resulted in more than 90% of VA selectivity, with FE being settled at 47%[155]. Nilges et al. have performed a two-step electrochemical conversion of LVA to octane via valeric acid over Pb electrode at −1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M H2SO4 [157]. A VA selectivity of 97.2% was achieved with a Columbic efficiency of 27%. Kolbe-type electrolysis was employed to convert the formed VA to octane further using a Pt electrode in aqueous methanol for almost 23 h [157]. Shrodar et al. depicted the ECH of LVA over a range of electrodes, including Pb, Cu, Fe, Ni, and C [158]. The authors first have performed ECH of LVA to optimize the initial substrate concentration at a constant applied potential of −1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, for 4 h in the range of 0.05–1 M initial LVA concentration. The columbic efficiency was increased continuously from 0.05 M (FE = 6.8%) to 0.5 M (56.4%) LVA concentration and increased even after that for 1 M (65.4%) LVA concentration in acidic conditions. Interestingly, the GVL selectivity decreased from 18% to 13.9% upon increasing initial LVA concentration, while the VA selectivity was changed between 82% to 86% for 1 M concentration [158]. The authors have performed ECH of LVA at an initial concentration of 0.5 M (71.6% conversion, 81.6% VA selectivity, and 56.4% FE) to understand the nature of the electrode material in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and basic (1 M NaOH) conditions especially for Pb and Fe electrodes. For both Pb and Fe electrodes, no formation of VA was observed in the 1 M NaOH electrolyte, while both VA and GVL were formed in the 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Interestingly Fe has shown more LVA conversion (24%) than Pb (19.6%) in 1 M NaOH electrolyte in contrast to the acidic electrolyte (Fe-19.9% conversion, Pb-71.6% conversion) under the same conditions. The use of carbon as an electrode led to GVL formation with 70% selectivity and 39% conversion, whereas no formation of VA was observed [158]. The overpotential and the pH of the electrolyte applied shifted the pendulum between VA and GVL as the main products of ECH of LVA, whereas the Pb electrode was the most active electrode for LVA conversion. 2.4.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of xylose Xylose is a hemicellulose sugar derived from lignocellulosic biomass and sorghum straw via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction, and it is mainly used to produce xylitol, a highly valued product [159,160]. Catalytic hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol has been performed with several metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, in this section, the ECH of xylose to xylitol over Zn amalgamated electrode has been studied by Jokic A et al. [141] would be discussed as the literature on ECH of xylose is scarce, and the results are presented in Table 5. The authors have reported a new electrocatalytic conversion of xylose for simultaneous production of xylitol and xylonic acid or the corresponding xylonate salts in 0.8 M KBr (pH = 8.5) and 0.8 M Na2SO4 electrolytes over Zn amalgamated electrode [141]. Both initial xylose concentration and applied current densities have significantly influenced the FE. At a low reaction rate, 80% of FE has been achieved in sulfate electrolytes, whereas for KBr electrolytes, up to 60% FE has been obtained. The FE has decreased sharply at the critical reaction rate, while at low current densities, FE has decreased linearly. A similar trend of FE has been observed for the concentration change: At increasing concentration from minimum over a low range, FE has increased and then reached a constant. At the same time, at higher current densities (above 20 and particularly at more than 50 mA/cm2) it decreased sharply. The results illustrated that the rate-determining step of xylitol formation limited the reaction mass transport. The xylitol production rate has an adverse effect on increasing current density at high current densities (j), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was dominant over xylitol formation [141]. Thus, for efficient xylitol production, xylose concentration and current densities have substantially affected current efficiency. Spasojevic, M et al. have reported the electrochemical reduction of xylose over amalgamated zinc catalyst [161]. They have found the optimal reduction conditions in 0.8 M KBr electrolyte solution in terms of xylose concentration, reaction temperature, and the current densities to achieve more than 90% of current efficiency. The optimal conditions reported were: Initial xylose concentration > 0.8 M, the reaction temperature > 40 °C, and the current densities in the range of 100 mA cm−2 < j < 400 mA cm−2. Spasojevic, M et al. have examined the kinetics of xylitol production over Zn amalgamated electrode and have proposed the reaction mechanisms of two parallel reactions that occur simultaneously on Zn surface in Na2SO4 electrolyte i.e., HER and xylose reduction reactions [162]. The reaction mechanism involves two consecutive electrochemical and one chemical step. Firstly, the xylose molecules adsorb on metallic Zn. Then adsorbed oxy carbonyl form of xylose slightly restricts the HER within the applied potential range up to −1.25 V. The reduction of adsorbed xylose molecules to xylitol happens with Zn-H at more negative applied potentials than −1.25 V. Further, increasing the negative potentials more than −2.0 V, the HER will become dominant on metallic Zn to reduce both current efficiency and the xylitol production rate [162]. 2.4.5 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of furfural Furfural is a product of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of xylose [163] and building block for producing a wide range of fuels and chemicals by hydrogenation as described in Scheme 3 [164]. The hydrogenation products such as furfuryl alcohol (FA), 2-methyl furan (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), and 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF) have various applications as solvents and fuel blends, especially MTHF with an octane number of 74 and can readily be blended with p-series gasoline fuel [165]. Moreover, THFA as a green solvent has its potential applications in pesticides, coatings, and stripping formulations [166]. The corresponding Gibbs free energies and standard cell potentials for the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and the subsequent reduction reactions are mentioned in Table 8 . It is apparent that water electrolysis reduction needs higher cell potential compared to the use of hydrogen gas; thus greater power input is required. The formation of THFA from FA involves the hydrogenation of the furan ring, whereas the formation of MF involves the hydrogenolysis of the non-conjugated hydroxyl group of FA. The cell potentials required for the formation of THFA and MF from FA are 1.01 and 1.09 V, respectively, indicating that the formation of THFA is marginally favoured over the formation of MF. A similar pattern can be observed for the formation of MTHF from MF (1.5 V) by furan ring hydrogenation and from THFA (2.06 V) by hydrogenolysis of non-conjugated hydroxyl group, respectively. In fact, the formation of MTHF from THFA is highly unlikely possible as the cell the potential required for the hydrogen gas is 1.23 V, and it is thermodynamically favourable and subsequently faster [164]. Many parameters such as different electrocatalysts, electrolytes, reaction conditions, and reactors were investigated in a quest to achieve maximum yields of respective furfural products. The details are summarized in Table 9 . The products formed were significantly influenced by various transition metals Pt [167,165], Pd [112,164], Rh [112], Ru [112], Pb [168,169], Cu [147,170,171], Ni [147,170], Fe [147,], Al [], Zn [169], Cd [169], Co [112], Ti and Hg [169]. Moreover, oxides, alloys, TiO2 [173], La-doped TiO2 [174], , nanophosphides containing Ni or Cu [175], and Zn amalgam [169] were also studied for ECH of furfural. The effect of electrode choice was well-reviewed by Kwon et al. [111] and Andrew et al. [123] presented the strategies to control ECH and hydrogenolysis of furfural to minimize undesired reactions. This review will present the ECH studies of furfural and illustrate the influence of the catalytic materials and the reaction parameters. Zhao B et al. performed ECH of furfural in H-type cell with a platinum sheet as anode using Pt, Pb, Ni, and Cu as electrodes using 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M NaOH electrolytes. Among these metals, despite the low conversion of furfural, about only 8%, Pt showed 99% selectivity of FA, citing the lack of surface area of cathode for the low conversion. By providing sufficient electrode surface area using activated carbon fibers as supporting material that enhanced the ECH due to its high conducting nature, the authors successfully achieved 82% conversion of furfural with 78% current efficiency [167]. Zhenglong Li et al. varied current density and the pH of the electrolytes using a sacrificial Ni electrode [176]. At constant current density (600 mA/dm2) and a pH of 5, the FA yield followed the order of the cathodes, Al < 308 SS ≤ Cu < Ni ≤ Fe. The authors also performed controlled experiments to depict the material balance and current efficiency, which improved with the octane trap. However, the conversion of the furfural was slightly decreased as the furfural was trapped in the octane. Sungyup and Elizabeth J. et al. reported the systematic study of various reaction parameters such as current density, electrolyte, and co-solvent ratio in acidic solutions that affect the ECH and hydrogenolysis of furfural for better understanding the product distribution [177]. Mild electrolytes favoured the formation of FA, while highly acidic electrolytes accommodated both FA and 2-MF. The authors have well presented the variation of reaction parameters concerning the Cu cathode and demonstrated that higher current densities are required for fast charge transfer and short reaction times to avoid undesired side reactions to maximize the yields of ECH of furfural [177]. Nilges and Schroder experimentally depicted the product distribution over Pt, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Al electrodes using highly acidic 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte in a water/acetonitrile mixture using a divided cell [147]. This work also observed that strongly acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) produced more 2-MF than FA over Cu cathode at a constant current density of −10 mA/cm2, a similar observation was reported by Sungyup and Elizabeth J. et al. [177]. At a current density of −10 mA/cm2, the dimer produced from the pinacol coupling was a dominant product over C, Fe, Pb, and Al electrodes and was significantly low for the Ni electrode [147]. Wang and Xu et al. have reported the first use of the Ti/La-doped TiO2 film electrode prepared by the sol-gel method [174]. The authors have achieved a well-dispersed uniform-sized particle on the La+3 doped TiO2 electrocatalyst surface, which showed an excellent reduction yield of 88.6% with a maximum of 85.7% current efficiency. The surface contamination on the electrode surface was not observed for the bulk electrolysis, and this catalyst offers a prominent ECH process for FA production [174]. At neutral pH, Lopez-Ruiz et al. investigated ECH of oxygenates over Pd, Ru, Rh, Cu, Ni, and Co [112]. For all the metals reported for ECH of furfural, FA was the major product, and MF was observed only over Cu, Ni, and Rh. The authors also provided additional insights into the reactivity of the metal, and Pd has shown double the turnover frequency (TOF) compared to the metals studied under the same conditions. In contrast, Rh and Co were barely active for ECH. All the metals have shown a substantial influence on the occurrence of HER with double the TOF that of ECH except for Co, which had a low activity for both ECH and HER [112]. Sara K. et al. demonstrated the use of a continuous-flow electrocatalytic membrane reactor [164]. Before the ECH of furfural, aqueous phase hydrogenation of furfural with hydrogen gas was carried out in a high-throughput reactor at 100 °C, and the activity of the metals followed the trend Pd > Ni > Ru > Pt > Rh. After identifying the most active monometallic catalyst (i.e., Pd), Pd/C was used as a cathode for the ECH of furfural. At a constant power input of 0.1 W, Pd/C was 4.4 times active than Pt/C, with FA being 54% and THFA being 26% selectivity are the significant products of ECH of furfural [164]. The applied voltage has significantly changed product selectivity as the FA selectivity decreased with increasing voltage, consequently increasing THFA selectivity. The current efficiency in the range of 24–30% indicates that the HER was favoured over the ECH of furfural. The authors also varied the reaction temperature from 30 °C to 70 °C, which barely showed any improvement in the reaction rate of furfural conversion. Supplying hydrogen gas at anode instead of water electrolysis slightly improved product formation rates, whereas sparging the H2 gas on the cathode did not affect conversion rate or selectivity [164]. Jung S. et al. synthesized FA and MF by using a Cu foil electrode [178]. The authors have specifically investigated the parallel side reactions, including furanic compounds polymerization and a special emphasis on the HER reactions. Increasing applied potential promoted both HER and ECH as well as the furfural conversion. Lower initial concentrations of furfural diminished the polymerization reaction, but at the same time, the HER reaction was progressed due to the lack of sufficient substrate. In contrast, increasing the furfural concentration, the polymerization reaction was rapidly progressed to form an organic layer around the catalyst, which suppressed HER and ECH reactions. The authors reported an alternative and a direct reaction path for MF production directly from furfural, not through the intermediate FA, and independent of applied potential when using 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with Cu electrode. At a constant applied potential, FA can also be converted to MF given the conditions. These two reaction pathways led to more MF selectivity compared to FA selectivity [178]. Jung S et al. compared the production rate, FE, and selectivity of products of bare Cu electrode with microcrystalline Cu and nanocrystalline Cu prepared by electrodeposition [179]. The improved surface area and the roughness factors of nanocrystalline Cu compared to bare Cu bettered the production rates of combined FA + MF and H2 by 2.4 and 4 times. This could be due to the increased mass transfer limitation of furfural to the electrode, increased active site density, and the interaction between furfural and electrode surface. Additionally, the nanocrystalline Cu electrode prevented the reaction deactivation at higher initial furfural concentrations that occurred with the bare Cu electrode [179]. Chu et al. reported the first use of nanoporous TiO2 having enhanced surface area for the ECH of furfural in an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM]BF4)) with micro-water electrolyte [173]. The reduction of the furfural was occurred on the film surface by Ti(IV)/Ti(III) redox system. At the current density of 38 mA/cm2, 61.7% of both FAL yield and the current efficiency were observed [173]. Zhang et al. investigated the electrocatalytic activity of the nanostructured transition metal phosphides for simultaneous high rate furfural hydrogenation and oxidation [175]. The synthesized catalysts (Cu3P/CFC & Ni2P/CFC) as electrodes has shown the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for four simultaneous reactions in alkaline media: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), furfural hydrogenation reaction (FHR), and furfural oxidation reaction (FOR). The simultaneous use of Cu3P/CFC as cathode and Ni2P/CFC as the anode in a divided cell chamber produces furfuryl alcohol as hydrogenation product in catholyte chamber, and furoic acid as an oxidation product of furfural in the anolyte chamber at the different applied potential in respective chambers. Almost 100% selectivity of the furfuryl alcohol was achieved with Cu3P/CFC with high FE in the range of 92–98% at the applied potential range of −0.05 to −0.55 V, which signifies the substantial activity of Cu3P/CFC towards FHR. The DFT calculations revealed that the activity of Cu3P/CFC was derived from the high hydrogen adsorption capacities, thereby enhancing the FHR. Comparatively, the Ni2P/CFC exhibited higher FOR activity with almost 100% selectivity of FOR product furoic acid along with FE in the range of 90–98% over the applied potential of 1.2–1.7V. The dominant activity of Ni2P/CFC towards FOR was attributed by the formed high valance state active Ni2 species. The authors developed this concept to achieve the simultaneous hydrogenation and oxidation reaction at cathode and anode, respectively, so that the suitable biomass-derived compounds could be applied to produce liquid fuels and fine chemicals in maximum yields [175]. 2.4.6 Parameter selection for the design of ECH of furfural experiment Although the selection of electrocatalyst is crucial to achieving the high selectivity and yield of desired products as well as high faradaic efficiency, other reaction parameters have a significant influence on the product distribution and could determine the selectivities and faradaic efficiencies of the targeted products. The important parameters include the pH of the electrolyte, the applied potential, and the initial concentration of the substrate. The other parameters, such as reaction time which could be attained by the equivalent charge transfer, and the solvent ratio, were found to have a nominal influence on the targeted product distribution. The experimental setup, which could be vital for the reaction performance, selectivity, and the mass balance of the substrate and the products, also an important parameter, needs to be considered. The three types of reactors: Continuous, batch, and semi-batch reactors, have been implemented in various studies. The continuous flow reactors are efficacious for scale-up and for challenging the mass transport limitations. The fundamental studies and the kinetic parameter evaluation could be investigated by the batch and semi-batch reactors. The challenging task of the ECH of the furfural is to account for the MF, which tends to evaporate quickly due to its high vapour pressure [180]. Z. Li et al. [176] used an octane trap and have performed controlled experiments to account for the mole balance of a mixture of substrate and the products: furfural, FA, and MF in an undivided cell without performing ECH. The experiment resulted in a reduced evaporation loss of MF due to the octane layer on the top, yet a considerable, i.e., 35% of MF still evaporated from the system. Nilges and Schroder attached a cold trap reflux condenser to the catholyte outlet that flowed N2 gas through catholyte to trap the evaporated MF in the condenser using an acetonitrile coolant cooled to −15 °C [147]. The important parameter that determines the product selectivity between MF and FA is the pH of the electrolyte being used [147,178,181]. Jung S et al. reported the effect of electrolyte pH on the product selectivity at a constant current density of −10 mA/cm2 using Cu flags in 20 vol% acetonitrile and 80 vol% water solvent [178]. The three electrolytes in the pH range of 0 to 3.4 were: 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH 0), 0.1 M H2SO4 (pH 1.1), and 0.2 M NH4Cl (pH 3.4) tested. The most significant observation was the increasing trend of MF selectivity with decreasing pH of the electrolyte. The MF selectivity followed the pH order of 0.5 M H2SO4 (30%) > 0.1 M H2SO4 (20%) > 0.2 M NH4Cl (less than 2%). A similar trend was observed with HCl electrolyte instead of H2SO4, depicting the pH effect rather than the anion effect [178]. In contrast to MF, the FA selectivity was increased with increasing pH from 0 to 3.4 and was observed to be dominant in the pH range of 6 to 10. Andrew S et al. clearly mentioned the pH of electrolyte effect on MF and FA selectivity in their brief review [123]. Although the formation of furans and hydrofurans above pH 10 has happened, FA was the major product [169,176]. The low selectivities of the furanics and hydrofurans above pH 10 were likely due to the instability of the furanics [167,168]. In summary, both MF and FA have been formed in a strong acidic electrolyte. MF was the primary product, while FA was dominant in mild acidic and high basic electrolytes. Another vital aspect of ECH of furfural is the FE of the process. The amount of electrons passed over the half-cell potential determines the FE, which has a crucial role in determining the efficiency of ECH over HER reaction [177,179,181,182]. The half-cell potential can be a determining factor in the reactions that occur on the catalyst surface. Both ECH and HER involve Volmer reactions (Eqs. 7a and 7b) where the hydrogen would be chemisorbed on the electrode surface and then proceed to ECH and HER simultaneously. In order to increase the ECH efficiency and FE, the chemisorbed hydrogen should react with the organic substrate to produce the respective products, thereby suppressing the protons to promote HER reaction. Increasing applied voltage increases the ECH rate and HER, thereby affecting the total efficiency of the reaction. Jung S et al. observed the increasing rate of HER at an applied voltage of −950 mV compared to −800 mV with Cu electrode using a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte [178]. The combined FE of both FA and MF reached 100% at −500 mV, whereas it was dropped to 76% at −600 mV. However, this drop was not caused by increasing HER but happened due to the progression of side reaction at −650 mV that resulted in the drop of FE of FA. At −800 mV, the combined FE further dropped to 56%, and the authors mentioned that about 27% of FE was neither accounted for the furanic products nor the HER. The provision of excess applied potential necessarily makes it an inefficient use of produced electrons, thereby leading to a drop in the overall efficiency of the ECH system. In addition, FE was greatly influenced by the electrode used, as observed by the reports in which more than 80% was achieved [174,175]. The applied potential should be chosen accordingly to the electrocatalyst, electrolyte, and substrate applied in the ECH system, which could be in a typical range of −500 to −650 mV [123]. The initial substrate concentration has a substantial effect on the FE and ECH of furfural. Zhao B et al. used the initial furfural concentration in the range of 40–120 mM over Pt supported on activated carbon fibres using 0.1 M HCl electrolyte at a constant applied voltage of −500 mV [167]. The FA yield and current efficiency were maximized at 80 mM concentration while below 80 mM HER dominated the ECH. Due to a lack of furfural concentration, the active catalyst sites were preoccupied with chemisorbed hydrogen instead of furfural. Increasing the furfural concentration over 80 mM led to forming an organic layer around the electrode, which decreased both furfural and current efficiencies [167]. Also, the mole balance and production rates were affected by the low initial concentration of 20 mM, a significant challenge of ECH of furfural [176,177]. Jung S et al. also reported forming a thick organic layer around the electrode when 200 mM of initial furfural concentration was used, which inflicted the imbalance in production rate and mole balance [178]. Additionally, the H2 production rate was dropped by 60% when 200 mM of furfural concentration was used due to the saturation of organic compounds on the electrode not providing active sites for H2 adsorption [178]. The initial furfural concentration should be maintained in a range (typically from 20 mM to 100 mM) such that enough active sites should be occupied by furfural and hydrogen to promote ECH more than HER, and should not be exceeded so that the electrode would mop up by the substrate to form a fouling layer on the electrode surface. The solvent ratio and the reaction time have shown the slightest concern effect on the product distribution and could be selected based on the other defining parameters. Thus, parameter selection needs to be defined to design an effective ECH of the furfural system."
6,Electrochemical hydrogenation of lignin and lignin model compounds,"2.5 Electrochemical hydrogenation of lignin and lignin model compounds 2.5.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of lignin model compounds Electrochemical hydrogenation has been intensively studied on lignin model compounds in the recent past, which serves as a cleaner and more efficient way for selective hydrogenation. Table 10 lists the pathways of common lignin model compounds that can cover the most typical functional groups and linkage bonds of lignin. As can be seen from the reaction paths in Table 10, electrochemical hydrogenation can occur very selectively on the aromatic ring without destroying other functional groups (hydroxyl, methyl, and methoxyl). Even for dimers, electrochemical hydrogenation can very effectively happen on diphenyl ether (Table 10, entry 8). The electrochemical hydrogenation reaction, catalyzed by Rh/C, mainly occurs on the aromatic ring and generates di-cyclohexyl and cyclohexyl phenyl ether. At the same time, the ester bonds were also partially broken, which generated a small portion of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. Table 11 lists recent works using electrocatalytic hydrogenation on model compounds, which can be efficiently converted to cycloalkanes with high conversion rates in the presence of catalysts. Anna et al. have investigated various electrodes on electro-reduction of phenol, and the order of catalytic activity is Ru/Ni > Pt/Pt > Rh/Ni. 92% of cyclohexanol product was obtained with 11% current efficiency under a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and NaCl as supporting electrolyte at 60 °C [183]. Song et al. also tested the electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol with Pt/C, Pd/C, and Rh/C. The reaction pathway from phenol to cyclohexanone was proposed, then further hydrogenated to cyclohexanol (like Entry 1)[187]. In their work, Rh/C was led to the highest conversion rate of phenol (50–66%) under different electrolytes, followed by Pt/C and Pd/C. Furthermore, the conversion rate increases with temperature up to 50 °C under exploring Pt/C with −40 mA of current. The noble metal catalysts have been explored in Peng's work [188]. PtRhAu, PtRh, and Pt were prepared as electrocatalysts deposited on carbon felt and compared the effection on electrochemical hydrogenation of guaiacol. Compared with PtRh catalyst, the ternary PtRhAu (further incorporation of Au) was more selectively produced 2MC (2-methoxycyclohexanol) and suppressed the formation of deoxygenated by-products (like methoxy-cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexanol). PtRhAu catalyst was proposed to convert 91% of the guaiacol with a 74% selectivity of 2MC. Moreover, the PtRhAu catalyst maintained over 40% of FE. The performance of this electrocatalytic hydrogenation system on lignin-derived bio-oil was checked in this work. The bio-oil from wood was further electro-reducted in 0.2 M HClO4, and after 3 h reaction, 92% of conversion rate and 68% of selectivity for the 2-methoxy-4-propylcyclohexanol was achieved. The purpose of investigating the behaviour of biomass derivatives or model compounds under different variables is to better understand the electrochemical mechanism, and to allow a visual comparison with conventional thermocatalytic hydrogenation techniques. However, the stubborn and more complex structure of raw biomass or lignin still cannot be completely replaced by the model compounds. And the behaviour of raw materials in the electrochemical hydrogenation process still needs further observation for industrial application. Therefore, a further summary of the electrochemical reactions in raw feedstock will be presented below. 2.5.2 Recent progress in electrocatalytic depolymerization of lignin Based on the research on lignin model compounds, electrochemical technology is also expected to have a large application in raw lignin hydrogenation. However, the molecular irregularity and amorphous structure of lignin is the most severe problem that hinders the industrial use of lignin. Although model compounds can represent the structure of lignin to some extent, the electrochemical hydrogenation of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of lignin is still a challenge. This section summarizes the latest progress about electrocatalytic technology in the field of raw lignin. 2.5.2.1 Depolymerization or valorization of bio-oil via electrocatalytic reaction Biomass oil or lignin-derived oil is usually from the pyrolysis of biomass or lignin, which is enhanced via applying electrochemical hydrogenation technology to obtain high-quality bio-oil with high hydrogen and carbon content. Since the pyrolysis efficiency of biomass, especially lignin, is relatively low, the bio-oil has a low calorific value not to be directly utilized. Electrochemical hydrogenation technology to enhance the oil quality, which is a two-step technology for using lignin. Here is a list of studies on electrochemical hydrogenation to treat bio-oil, as shown in Table 12 . Deng et al. investigated the electrochemical hydrogenation on bio-oil, lignin-derived oligomers, and light compounds. The authors showed that the unsaturated aromatic compounds were hydrogenated with a higher H/C ratio and less double bond equivalent (DBE) with prolonged processing time [189]. Moreover, in carrying out further electrochemical hydrogenation of bio-oil, the interactions between bio-oil molecules could not be ignored due to the formation of radicals. Furthermore, Dick and his group checked the electrochemical hydrogenation on hydrogenolysis lignin-derived oil under electrocatalysts [188]. The authors selectively hydrogenated lignin-derived oil to the oxygenated 2-methoxy-4-propylcyclohexanol (96% of conversion rate after 3-h reaction) and suppressed deoxygenation by using PtRhAu as electrocatalyst. The PtRhAu was deposited on carbon felt and showed good electrochemical hydrogenation by the synergistic effect. Especially, the addition of Au provided a superior performance on upgrading the lignin monomer mixture. Therefore, these works have confirmed that electrochemical hydrogenation could successfully increase the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the bio-oil and selectively convert lignin-derived oil in the presence of electrocatalysts. It provides a well-defined foundation for the electrochemical hydrogenation of raw lignin. 2.5.2.2 Electrocatalytic depolymerization of lignin The electrochemical reactions have also been utilized on lignin (summarized in Table 12). Although the primary lignin model compounds and bio-oils both use electrochemical hydrogenation to obtain high-quality chemicals. The current research on electrochemical lignin is more oriented towards electrochemical oxidation reactions to depolymerize the lignin macromolecular structure for valuable chemicals. Electrochemical depolymerization of lignin generally occurs at the anode, where alkaline solution dissolves the lignin to make it more uniformly dispersed in the reaction solution. Then, the alkaline solution can provide the reactive oxygen source (as ∙OH radicals) via oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to promote the conversion reaction. After the reaction for several hours, the average molecular weights of lignin were decreased, and lignin monomers (like aldehydes, acids, phenolic, and ketones) appeared. It suggested that the main lignin structure was cracked and broken to produce small molecular compounds through an oxidation reaction. To date, from previous research on lignin electrochemical reactions, we can know the alkaline solution was used for commonly electrolyte solutions. Moreover, ILs and DESs were also used as electrolytes due to their excellent conductivity and recyclability. Besides, the electrode is an important factor to improve reaction rate as (1) various substrate materials to support catalyst during the reaction, (2) the conductivity of catalyst, (3) interaction effect between loading of catalyst and substrate. All factors have a significant influence on the electrochemical depolymerization reaction. Electrode structure was investigated by Stiefel and his group [190]. They found that the high porosities of electrode material as fleece> wire> foam> plate and explained the porosities are not related to mass transport coefficients due to mass transport limitation from the bulk molecule to the catalyst surface. It is effectively limiting the reaction rates. For the conditions of electrochemical reactions of lignin, it was proposed that the efficiency decreased with increased current density by Anna et al. [183]. Higher temperature favoured the more aqueous products, like phenols and acids, with oxygen species associated with hydrophilic groups. Moreover, the current density also affected the outcomes; higher current density resulted in more organic products, like aldehydes and ketones [191]. By electrochemical oxidation of lignin, the main products generated were proposed to be monomeric compounds such as anisoles, vanillin, and aldehydes. Additionally, Wang et al. also observed that increasing the temperature could enhance the yield of anisole [192]. In another study, Cai et al. investigated the electrochemical oxidation and electrocatalytic hydrogenation of lignin in alkaline electrolytes [196]. The authors have tested the CV (cyclic voltammograms) curve and AP (anodic polarization) curves under different lignin concentration (10–60 g lignin/L), reaction time (0.5–2.5 h) and NaOH concentration (0.8–1.2 M) electrolyte. The oxidation of lignin on Pb/PbO2 has been observed in CV curves that oxidation potential of Pb/PbO2 in 1 M sodium hydroxide solution was higher than that in other concentrations of NaOH. Furthermore, oxidation potential also raised when the concentration of lignin increased from 10 to 40 g lignin/L. The high oxidation potential provides a better lignin degradation efficiency and a lower degree of side reaction. For the reaction time, the over-potential increased with increasing the reaction time, promoting oxidation efficiency. The author proposed a mechanism of electrochemical oxidation, which was summarized in Fig. 9(b). Hydroxyl radicals were absorbed and interacted with anode from water and further formed oxidic MO through reaction 1. Then oxide MO reacted with the lignin molecule to perform oxidation. Reaction 2 and 4 side reaction, which also exists. Intermediate M(∙OH) were further transferred to M and produced O2 gaseous, or dioxygen that was on MO to generate O2. Hydrogenation performance on Cu/Ni-Mo-Co was also investigated in their work. The hydrogenation ability was proportional to NaOH concentration, reaction time and reached to top under a concentration of 50 g lignin/L. The mechanism of electrocatalytic hydrogenation shows in Fig. 9(a). This time, lignin compounds and hydrogen molecules from water were chemisorbed on the cathode electrocatalyst, and then hydrogenation occurred. At the same time, hydrogen gas (side product) was competitively formed through reactions 2 and 3, which have a negative effect on electrochemical hydrogenation efficiency. Moreover, Fang et al. took advantage of pre-electrolyzed disulfide (2,2′-dithiodiethanol) and a radical inhibitor (BHT) to completely cleave β-O-4 bonds in the dimers and applied this reaction system to DDQ-lignin. They found that more ethyl acetate phase (like phenolic monomers) was improved after the thio-assistant reaction, which improved the efficiency of lignin depolymerization. Only 38–54 wt% of insoluble residuals can be obtained [194]. 2.5.3 Electrochemical hydrogenation of lignin The hydrogenation reaction is an effective technique for increasing the hydrogen and carbon content of the final product, which is particularly important for bio-oils, where high hydrogen to carbon ratio can result in a higher heating value. However, the electro-reduction process has been recognized as an environmentally alternative technology for lignin utilization [197]. A study related to the electrochemical hydrogenation of lignin was done by Zhang et al. [198]. The lignin was added to the cathode compartment. A constant potential was carried out on the reduction reaction. After the reaction, hydrogenated lignin was extracted from the solution by water, and elemental analysis was done for each solid hydrogenated lignin. The authors performed hydrogenation experiments with different solvents, electrolytes, temperatures, and chemical concentrations, and the maximum H/C ratio of hydrogenated lignin can increase from 0.11 to 0.15. Recently, Shen et al. have performed electrocatalytic hydrocracking of lignin by using a 3D structure electrocatalyst (Ti/SnO2-Sb2O3/α-PbO2/β-PbO2) as an anode, Cu mesh as cathode, and ceramic particles were used to fill between the anode and cathode [199]. As described above, the lignin was depolymerized via an electrochemical reduction process at an anode side while the ether linkages were performed hydrogenolysis at the cathode side. Also, the knowledge of model compounds and oxygenated functional groups would accelerate the cleavage of the connection bonds. Especially the aromatic rings close to the ether linkage has a high possibility for the hydrogenation reaction due to the competition of electrons with π bonds [197]. Electrochemical Birch reduction was optimized from traditional Birch reduction. Byron K Peters et al. achieved partial hydrogenation of compounds containing aromatic rings at room temperature reduced the aromatic rings to1,4-cyclohexadienyl selectively [122]. They innovatively added LiBr as a supporting electrolyte under a constant current and found that the crucial role of Li+ was guiding the reaction toward the aimed product. This electrochemical reduction system combines safety, economy, and operability with the high selectivity and conversion rate of Birch reaction and might be a promising method to pretreat lignin. Lignin, containing many aromatic units, has an excellent hydrogen storage potential, while electrochemical hydrogenation of lignin has not attracted much attention yet. Therefore, it would become a high-value energy source if the solid lignin could be effectively hydrogenated and improve the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio. In addition, hydrogenated lignin is used as an alternative for fossil energy and as a raw material for chemicals (such as olefins or alkenes) for the pyrolysis and gasification process."
7,Concluding remarks,
8,Comparison of two technologies,"3.1 Comparison of two technologies This review article provides a detailed description of biomass hydrogenation technology, which has advantages and disadvantages for conventional thermochemical and electrochemical hydrogenation (Table 13 ). Thermochemical hydrogenation is a non-homogeneous reaction, which requires the transfer of gaseous hydrogen into the liquid phase reactants. Moreover, heterogeneous catalysts were used, so the reaction must be carried out at moderate to high temperatures and pressure. It also has a severe impact on the reactor and operating conditions. However, unlike traditional thermochemical hydrogenation, electrocatalytic hydrogenation performs the chemical transfer reaction more gently based on consuming sustainable electrical energy. It can control the reaction effectively by applying current or voltage externally. Using electrocatalysts can make the reaction more efficient and selective, which does not need to consider high-temperature deactivation, but only their corrosion resistance in acidic and alkaline environments. Of course, more intensive research using organic electrolytes such as ILs and DESs has been progressing, which will make the electrocatalytic hydrogenation process greener and more environmentally friendly. This review reported the recent advances, especially in ECH and traditional thermal catalytic hydrogenation (TCH) of biomass feedstocks and biomass organics. In the past few years, TCH has been studied extensively in almost all possible directions, including reductive, oxidative, supportive donor environments, unconventional catalytic routes, and optimized conditions regarding affecting reaction parameters. In this regard, enormous progress has been registered. Most importantly, thermodynamic studies and kinetic parameter evaluation, which are essential to understand the reaction progress, have been in an advanced state for TCH. However, the interest has been shifted to ECH lately, keeping the limitations of TCH such as energy-intensive processes, high temperature, and pressure conditions. If the reaction progress of TCH and ECH follows similar mechanism paths under the given conditions, the understanding of the two technologies vastly improves the hydrogenation rate. Through the review of TCH processes, we can identify the metals that readily reduce the functional groups of organics at elevated conditions, which could also be highly active for the ECH process subjected to the suitable electrolyte. Thence, the need to compare two technologies becomes apparent to make advances in ECH. The typical end products of the glucose reduction with TCH and ECH are distinct on the same metal when used as a catalyst in TCH and as an electrocatalyst in ECH. For example, TCH of glucose on Cu/s-Ac catalyst at 180 °C [200], 4 MPa of H2 gas produced a 72.4% yield of 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PDO) whereas ECH of glucose on Cu electrode in neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte produced sorbitol [134]. In fact, the dominant product of the ECH of glucose is sorbitol, whereas for TCH was 1,2-PDO. Thus, the comparison of TCH and ECH cannot be made towards a particular product in most cases but can be compared with the selectivity and yields of the respective products. The product selectivity in ECH of glucose is affected by multiple parameters (explained in the ECH of glucose section). However, a proper relation between the affecting parameters and the product selectivity could not have been deduced due to a lack of sufficient literature. TCH of biomass-derived HMF and furfural has been studied with hydrogen donor solvents such as 2-propanol, 2-butanol, ethanol, methanol, and glycerol as well through catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) to overcome the use of molecular hydrogen, which makes the plausibility of CTH an effective process in the near future. However, the limitation of this system existed with the simultaneous reaction of H-donor on the catalyst surface. It can make the product separation challenging to reduce the overall efficiency of the CTH process. Considering the ECH of HMF and furfural is a straightforward approach for respective products, nearly 100% selectivity of the products have been achieved with highly active metal electrodes, especially with Cu electrodes traditionally active for furfural hydrogenation FAL. The product selectivity can be tuned with the market values of a particular product by adjusting the electrolyte pH, which substantially affects product selectivity. The importance of ECH has been escalating since its relevance in the conversion of biomass-derived furans and organics to liquid fuels. The main challenge of the ECH process lies with controlling HER that occurs simultaneously at the cathode, which affects the overall F.E. of the ECH process. It is clear that the activity of specific metals as electrodes have particular dependences on the reaction parameters such as applied potential, current densities, and pH of the electrolyte. In addition, the hydrogenation capabilities of the two techniques on the model compounds were also compared by Song et al. [4]. In Table 14 , The comparison of phenolic compounds and diaryl ether conversion via electrocatalytic hydrogenation and thermal catalytic hydrogenation has been shown. For the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons (saturated benzene ring), the functional group has a significant influence on the reactivity, and the conversion rate is increased as follows: diphenyl ether < benzyl phenyl ether <4-methoxy phenol <4-methyl phenol < phenol. Comparing the conversions of the two hydrogenation techniques, the conversion rates from thermochemical hydrogenation were all higher than those from electrocatalytic hydrogenation (Table 14). It should be noted that the concentration conditions in the two technologies are not identical, so differences in hydrogen coverage as shown might be the reason. For all the model compounds listed here, the TOF under catalytic thermochemical conversion is higher than that under electrocatalytic conversion, probably because a thermal catalytic conversion has higher reaction efficiency and requires a shorter reaction time. It is noteworthy that the conversion of phenolic compounds was higher than that of di-aryl ether (diphenyl ether, benzyl phenyl ether). There are three reaction pathways for di-aryl ethers: hydrogenation (yielding hydrogenated ethers), hydrogenolysis, and hydrolysis (yielding monomers). Under the thermochemical conversion, hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and hydrolysis reactions are all more violent, leading to a decrease in the selectivity of the reaction, especially for reactants containing ether bonds. The utilization technologies of lignin are listed in Table 15 . Thio-assist reductive electrolytic is thiolate-based reductive for cleavage of β-O-4 linkages; organic thiol serves as small diffusible redox carriers for decomposing lignin to small-molecule fragments under a milder approach. 38–54% of lignin left as the residue after this method. Catalytic electrolysis performs electrochemical oxidation on kraft lignin with proton exchange membrane (PEM), and polyoxometalate (POM) or FeCl3 was used as a catalyst and charge carrier. Two-step oxidative approach is first oxidizing lignin using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) and tert-butyl nitrite (tBuONO) under O2 and then subjected to depolymerization methods with Au/Li-Al LDH (Au/Li-Al layered double hydroxide) catalyst. After two-step processing, 50–91% of lignin can be recovered as lignin residue. Moreover, aerobic oxidation hydrolysis technology is followed by formic-acid-induced hydrolytic depolymerization, which recovers 47–78% of lignin residue. Thermal catalytic hydrogenation performs hydrogenation on organosolv lignin with Rany Ni, Ru/C, and Rh/C at 200–250 °C. These are all focused on liquefying lignin as much as possible via various techniques and catalysts. However, due to lignin's structural characteristics, lignin residue still makes up most of the product. This work believes that the lignin residue is still valuable for research. Even the solid lignin product can be a valuable feedstock for utilization after a reasonable hydrogenation pretreatment."
9,Future scheme,"3.2 Future scheme A promising strategy for biomass utilization should be put more attention on maximizing the energy density in the aimed product and minimizing the carbon losses due to bio-products. In terms of energy policies and sociopolitical priorities, electrochemical conversion of biomass is well suited to be improved to the forefront of sustainable processes. Thermal catalytic hydrogenation of biomass derivatives fills in with high energy demand and harsh treating conditions as well. Considerable development has been progressed in this field in the past decade. For cutting energy supply and avoiding severe conditions, electrochemical hydrogenation serves as a promising conversion technology of biomass and its derivatives with reference to the ever-growing renewable energy demand and also considering the fact that most of the electrochemical reduction and oxidative electro-process is generally carried out at ambient conditions. Moreover, treating cellulose and hemicellulose electrochemically at room temperature can be a suitable technology to avoid the rapid polymerization of monomer units at high temperatures. Selective reduction of carbonyl functionalities over alcohol functionalities of cellulose and hemicellulose to value-added alcohol such as sorbitol and xylitol could be preferentially monitored in ECH. Furthermore, allowing simultaneous oxidation (at the anode) and reduction (at the cathode) of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and levulinic acid in both electrolytic chambers opportune a variety of product selection and improves the total yield. However, the challenges of electrochemical setup and product separation and analysis are critical to compete with the existing bio-refinery infrastructure. Nevertheless, the scaleup and the industrial applicability of ECH of biomass remain a leading edge. For lignin sources, the integration of pretreatment (electrochemical hydrogenation) and subsequent thermochemical process (fast pyrolysis) is considered a promising scheme for responding to bioenergy demand. There is the benchmark overview of this research, shown in Fig. 10 . As we can see, there are four problems with the utilization of lignin. First, lignin generally suffers from low utilization efficiency. Stubborn structure makes it hard to decompose, and condensation happens simultaneously to be soot. Lignin is a highly polymeric hydrocarbon with many aromatic rings and is very suitable as a raw material for olefins. However, the olefins yield is still relatively low after pyrolysis, which is the target product in this research. Moreover, for all lignin utilization technologies, traditional conversion has no good economy, like fast pyrolysis, even catalytic fast pyrolysis. 5.3% of olefins yield by catalytic pyrolysis can be obtained [204]. In the author's previous work, thermal hydrogenation as a pretreatment method was conducted to modify lignin and subsequently performed fast pyrolysis. This process increased H/C wt. the ratio of lignin by 0.02, and the olefins yield from fast pyrolysis can grow to 9.94 wt%. As for the future perspective, electrochemical hydrogenation will be performed on lignin for more efficient improvement of lignin, making it more suitable for producing olefin products by fast pyrolysis. Here, electrochemical hydrogenation was conducted on raw lignin and found that the hydrogenated lignin has a higher H/C wt. ratio than raw lignin by 0.04 [198]. So, roughly calculation and expectation of the results can be surmised that the olefins yield for the new proposal is greater or equal to 15 wt%. In conclusion, we hope that this review article provides an overview of the actual sophisticated conversion methods of lignocellulosic biomass & its derivatives regarding thermal catalytic and electro chemical/catalytic hydrogenation targeting academic and industrial researchers' interest in the progression of these promising technologies."
