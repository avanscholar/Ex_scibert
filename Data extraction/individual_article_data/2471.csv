0,Introduction,"Large scale palm oil production has been rising concern and criticism among the global community due to its unsurprisingly controversial use, as huge areas of rainforest have been cut down or burned to make way for palm plantations (Comte et al., 2012). However, it is undeniable that the lack of understanding of the ecological and environmental impacts of oil palm is the main reason for this pessimistic view. Studies have shown that the environmental performance of palm oil is comparable to or even better than other temperate crops in terms of global warming, land use, and water consumption (Schmidt, 2015). It is used in thousands of everyday products and is the most widely consumed vegetable oil on the planet (Gan and Li, 2014). Globally, it is estimated that the per capita consumption of palm is 16.7 kg or 20.1 kg, including non-edible use (Corley, 2009). By the year 2050, the demand is expected to double compared to the current annual production of 240 Mt (Corley, 2009). There will be a huge demand in the future for palm oil, implying the generation of several Mt of oil palm by-products and its residues. The palm oil industry produces a wide variety of waste ranging from solid to liquid wastes. Wastewater from the palm oil industry is commonly known as palm oil mill effluent (POME), generated mainly from oil extraction, washing, and cleaning processes (Singh et al., 2010). The solid fraction included leaves, truck, decanter cake (DC), empty fruit branches, seed shells, and fiber from the mesocarp (Loh, 2017; Singh et al., 2010). The critical characteristic of POME is its high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (10250–43750 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (15000–100000 mg/L), oil and grease (4000 mg/L), total solids (11500–79000 mg/L) and suspended solids (5000–54000 mg/L), and total nitrogen (180–1400 mg/L). These high values can cause catastrophic effects and negative consequences on the aquatic and soil environment (Igwe and Onyegbado, 2007; Madaki and Seng, 2013). Interestingly, palm oil accounts for only 10% of the total dry matter of oil palm, leaving 90% being oil palm biomass as waste (Loh and Choo, 2013). This represents a huge opportunity for sustainable biogas production using biomass and processing wastewater as the renewable feedstock. Hydrogen has received the most attention as it is clean in regard to emission, where only water is emitted as a by-product (Acar and Dincer, 2014). Besides, hydrogen is favoured for its high energy (120 kJ/g), which is 2.5 times higher compared to fossil fuel, its production from a wide variety of feedstock under ambient condition, and green fuel characteristics producing near-zero carbon, hydrocarbon, and greenhouses gases (GHG) as illustrated in Figure S1 (Acar and Dincer, 2014; Jayabalan et al., 2020; Sekoai et al., 2019). Hydrogen can be produced from various sources such as fossil fuels via steam reforming, gasification, nuclear energy via thermochemical water splitting, and high-temperature electrolysis (Acar and Dincer, 2014). However, generating clean hydrogen from fossil fuels is not preferred; hence hydrogen production from renewable energies is developed, including electrolysis, solar photovoltaic, and biomass gasification (Acar and Dincer, 2014). However, these methods are relatively energy and cost demanding; for example, solar photovoltaic is approximately 25 times more expensive than typical hydrogen production from fossil fuel (Rand and Dell, 2009). On the other hand, biological hydrogen production processes such as direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo-fermentation, dark fermentation, and hybrid fermentation technology are more economically feasible, able to utilize various feedstock, able to operate at ambient temperature and pressure, and less energy-intensive (Das et al., 2008; Das and Veziroǧ;lu, 2001; Hu et al., 2020). Another interesting fact to point out is that biological hydrogen production processes are recognized as environmentally friendly as well as an inexhaustible sources (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019). Table S1 summarizes the possible hydrogen production methods (Dawood et al., 2020). The development of effective biohydrogen not only able to ease the burden of overconsumption of fossil fuels but also can potentially reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill (Mu et al., 2020). In other words, these technologies enable the recovery of energy or resource simultaneously with the treatment of waste (Jayabalan et al., 2020). Among the different biological methods for biohydrogen production, photo-fermentation has been considered an effective way for biohydrogen production due to its ability to utilize sunlight and the ability to apply waste materials (Budiman et al., 2015). Aside from that, higher substrate conversion efficiency and less pollution emission are the benefits of the photo-fermentation based processes (Hu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2017). However, the major drawback of the photo-fermentation process is its low photochemical efficiency of only 3–10% (Pandu and Joseph, 2012). In contrast to photo-fermentation, biohydrogen production in dark fermentation is relatively simple and an independent reactor technology (Lazaro and Hallenbeck, 2019; Yin et al., 2020). However, it was reported that biohydrogen production from dark fermentation was accompanied by a large amount of volatile fatty acid (VFAs) production causing a lower product yield of only 33% and potential environmental pollution (Lazaro and Hallenbeck, 2019; Sağır and Hallenbeck, 2019; Wong et al., 2014). Apart from these two processes, microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is gaining more attention recently from researchers for its ability to simultaneous remove organic contaminants and biohydrogen production; therefore, it represents a crucial part of future waste biorefineries (Cardeña et al., 2019; Lu and Ren, 2016). MEC is also well known for its high efficiency and low operation temperature compared to conventional hydrogen production processes (Ghasemi et al., 2020). However, the inability to direct the application of certain feedstock such as waste with high lignocellulose content and expensive cathode material remains a major challenge for the application of MEC for biohydrogen production (Call et al., 2009; Rivera et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2020). In order to remedy the shortcoming of each process, integrated or coupled systems were often used for high yield biohydrogen production (Dawood et al., 2020). Typical examples include, dark-photo co-fermentation (Dawood et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), coupled MEC (Jia et al., 2020; Marone et al., 2017), and anaerobic digestion coupled to MEC (Hassanein et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2020). To date, the palm oil industry is a major commodity in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, accounting for 86% of the total worldwide production (Garritano et al., 2018). Thailand, Colombia, and Brazil have also started to emerge as the key producer of palm oil as the global demand increases (Kuss et al., 2015; Nutongkaew et al., 2019; Potter, 2020). Therefore, an overview of waste management with possible resource and energy recovery is important for practising sustainable palm oil production. Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the effect of critical process parameters on biohydrogen production, including temperature, pH, and substrate concentration. Additionally, some research/review papers in the literature have examined various pre-treatment strategies for increasing the accessibility of industrial wastewater and/or biomass/agriculture-based waste matrices for biohydrogen production. Prabakar et al. (2018) provided a concise overview of the significant challenges and constraints associated with developing a biohydrogen economy, the possible reactions and mechanisms involved during wastewater/waste conversion and their beneficial roles, and provided additional examples of pretreated agro-industrial wastes on enhanced biohydrogen production. Lin et al. (2012) discussed the production of biohydrogen from several types of industrial wastewaters and the parameters that affect its rates and yields. The authors discussed the following topics: (i) the role of process parameters in biohydrogen production from wastewaters, (ii) the different inoculum types involved and pre-treatment requirements, (iii) considerations for process reactor design and reactor types, and (iv) advanced integrated bioenergy production in biorefineries. Kamaraj et al. (2020) discussed the influence of various waste materials on biohydrogen production and yield, the technological approaches used worldwide for biohydrogen production (including physico-chemical and biological technologies), the types of inoculum/microorganisms used, and their optimal environmental conditions, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with biohydrogen production. Guo et al. (2010) reviewed the various agricultural wastes that can be used for dark fermentation-based biohydrogen generation and discussed the role/influence of operational parameters such as pH, partial pressure, temperature, and biocatalysts. In comparison to these important review-based studies, this review article focuses entirely on biohydrogen production using oil palm biomass and palm oil mill effluent (POME) as the primary renewable feedstocks and discusses the conversion of its solid and liquid waste components to biohydrogen. The specific objectives of this review were as follows: (i) to give an overview on the characteristics of wastes from rapidly growing palm oil industries, including the liquid and solid fraction, (ii) to assess various approaches of biohydrogen production by employing these waste materials, and (iii) the affecting factors, limitations, pre-treatment, and enhancement strategies of each process will also be discussed."
1,Characteristics of palm oil industrial waste,"The palm oil industry produces an abundant amount of agro-industrial waste, either in the form of solid or liquid. Globally, oil palm plantation was expected to generate more than 295 million tons of waste annually (Dungani et al., 2018). In 2020, Malaysia and Indonesia alone, the largest palm oil producers in the world, are projected to generate about 230 million dry tons of oil palm solid biomass waste (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). The solid waste produced from the palm oil industry consists of biomass residues such as oil palm trunk (OPT) and oil palm frond (OPF), which are generated from oil palm plantation, as well as empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), palm pressed fiber (PPF), and palm oil mill effluent (POME) that are generated as the by-product of palm oil milling process as illustrated in Fig. 1 (Awalludin et al., 2015). In regular practice, approximately 75% of biomass wastes are produced from oil palm cultivation (e.g., OPT and OPF), which is usually left rotten in the plantation for mulching and nutrient recovery purposes, whilst the other 25% is generated from oil palm milling (e.g., EFB, PKS, PPF), which can be utilized in a direct combustion process to produce energy (Awalludin et al., 2015). The production of palm oil starts from the cultivation of oil palm (Elaeis sp.). Typically, a one-year-old seedling will be planted in a plantation and raised until it is 25–30 years old before it is getting replanted (Schmidt, 2007). A mature oil palm tree gets routinely harvested throughout the year at a frequency between 10 and 15 days (Xaviar et al., 2011). Oil palm tree averagely produces 12 fresh fruit bunches (FFB) per year that weigh around 15–25 kg and containing 1000–1300 fruitlets, depending on the plantation site and plant age (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). During harvesting, fronds are pruned and left as waste called OPF, while a huge number of harvested trunks are wasted during the replanting process and referred to as OPT (Awalludin et al., 2015). Palm oil only consists of 10% of the total biomass, while the remaining 90% is disposed of as wastes (Awalludin et al., 2015). FFB harvested from oil palm plantations typically consists of about 25–26% mesocarp oil, 20–22% kernel nuts, 9–10% kernel shells, 28–30% palm EFB, and 14–16% mesocarp fiber (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). For every ton of FFB, 220 kg of EFB, 670 kg of mesocarp fiber, 70 kg of OPS, and 30 kg of palm kernel cake are produced after the palm oil milling process. The characteristics and chemical composition analysis of oil palm biomass, including OPF, OPT, EFB, PKS, and PPF, are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 . Another form of waste that is generated is the liquid effluent, referred to as POME. POME is an acidic, high temperature, high organic content wastewater discharge that may harm the water bodies' ecosystem if disposed of directly (Aziz and Hanafiah, 2017; Poh et al., 2020). These wastes also have high volatile organic content, resulting in a high potential as substrates for biogas production (Mamimin et al., 2019)."
2,Palm oil mill effluent (POME),"2.2 Palm oil mill effluent (POME) Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a viscous dark brownish colloidal wastewater by-product generated from the palm oil milling process. POME basically consists of water (∼95%), residual oil (∼4%), and solid materials (∼1%) (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). The major process that contributes to POME production is water discharge from the sterilization of FFB, slurry from the pressed oil clarification stage, and the wastewater from the hydro-cyclone unit (Poh et al., 2020). The highest contributor to POME generation is the palm oil clarification process wastewater, which accounts for 60% of the POME generated (Schmidt, 2007). The wastewater discharge from FFB sterilization and kernel shell hydro-cyclone separation contribute to about 36% and 4% of the total amount of POME generated in the oil mill process, respectively (Schmidt, 2007). In 2019, approximately a total of more than 180 million tons of POME were generated in Indonesia and Malaysia (Choong et al., 2018). For every ton of crude oil produced, 672.5 kg of POME was generated, which reflects the production of 25.4 tons POME per hectare of palm oil plantation (Schmidt, 2007). Direct discharge of POME without proper treatment in advance is not encouraged due to its high-strength, acidic, and high organic content (Poh et al., 2020; Poh and Chong, 2009). Numerous studies have investigated the physical and chemical characteristics of POME. POME characteristics vary widely depending on the type of FFB, palm oil extraction method, and the high crop season (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013; Poh and Chong, 2009). Table 3 shows the physical and chemical characteristics of POME. Due to continuous heat generation during the oil milling process, POME discharge would have high temperatures of around 60–90°C (Aziz and Hanafiah, 2017; Ma and Yusof, 2005). Even though POME is non-toxic to biological organisms, high COD and BOD of POME can adversely affect the environment (Aziz and Hanafiah, 2017). The nutritive contents of POME have also been reported by Aziz and Hanafiah (2017), where its high concentration of protein (0.83 g/100 g-dry matter), fat (0.71 g/100 g-dry matter), and carbohydrate (1.5 g/100 g-dry matter) can be utilized as substrates in microbial-based processes. POME contains about 2.5% cellulose, 56.6% hemicellulose, and 2.9% lignin on a dry basis (Mamimin et al., 2019). A significant number of the nutrients (e.g., Mg, P, K) in POME show that they are a high potential source of fertilizers for agriculture use (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013)."
3,Oil palm frond (OPF),"2.3 Oil palm frond (OPF) OPFs consist of mature oil palm leaf stalk (about 6–8 m long) and leaf stem (1–2 m long), which bears around more than 200 leaflets at a time (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). OPFs are generated in the oil palm plantation after field management and harvesting and are mostly left to rot in the plantation site (Yusoff, 2006). An oil palm plantation generates approximately 10.40 tonnes of OPF per hectare (Loh, 2017). Typical OPF contains approximately 44.46% cellulose, 23.53% hemicellulose, and 17.20% lignin (Ho and Wu, 2020). The composition of OPF and OPT may vary depending on the maturity and location where the wastes are collected."
4,Oil palm trunks (OPT),"2.4 Oil palm trunks (OPT) After 25 years, oil palm will suffer a decrease in fruit yields and oil production. Thus, replanting is carried out and leaves OPT as biomass waste (Sukiran et al., 2017). Commonly, 1 ha of oil palm plantation can produce about 74.48 tons of OPT. Similar to OPF, OPT contains high lignocellulosic substances with about 50.78%, 30.36%, and 17.87% of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively (Lai and Idris, 2013)."
5,Empty fruit bunch (EFB),"2.5 Empty fruit bunch (EFB) EFB is the stalks that are left after fruitlets are stripped from the fresh fruit bunch (FFB). EFB is the major source of solid biomass waste, which is the by-product of the stripping process during palm oil processing (Poh et al., 2020; Schmidt, 2007). EFB account for about 20–23% weight of FFB and physically consist of the main stalk and numerous spikelet (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). The production of 1 ton of crude palm oil generates nearly 1.3 tons of EFB (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). As the biggest contributor to palm oil waste in the world, Indonesia and Malaysia potentially can produce a total of 34 million tons of EFB annually with 18.8 kJ/kg energy potential (Kalkman et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2019). Similar to other oil palm biomass waste EFB contains high lignocellulosic substance (41.3–46.5% cellulose, 25.3–33.8% hemicellulose, and 27.6–32.5% lignin) (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). EFB is not suitable to be utilized as a boiler fuel due to its high moisture content (up to 88.75%) (Loh, 2017). EFB contains about 78.5% volatile matter content, 1.2% nitrogen, 51.8% carbon, 16.4% hydrogen, 33.2% oxygen (Loh, 2017), while the sugar contents consist of about 2.5% galactose and 33.1% glucose (Khalil et al., 2006)."
6,Palm kernel shell (PKS),"2.6 Palm kernel shell (PKS) PKS is the hard shell (endocarp) surrounding palm kernels that are collected from the cracking process of the palm nut in order to extract the palm kernel (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013). PKS makes up to around 5.5% of FFB, which is considerably smaller in amount compared to the EFB and fibers (Sukiran et al., 2017). PKS contains about 83.5% volatile matter and 3.0% ash content. Their macro chemical composition consists of nitrogen 0.04%, carbon 57.9%, hydrogen 12.6%, and oxygen 50.0 ± 0.6% (Loh, 2017). Due to their dry characteristics, low ash content, and high calorific value (20–22 MJ/kg), PKS is often used as a fuel for oil mill power generation or boiler, either as a single source or mixed with other biomass wastes (Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013; Yusoff, 2006)."
7,Palm pressed fiber (PPF),"2.7 Palm pressed fiber (PPF) PPF is an elongated fibrous solid residue that is left after the oil extraction from the fiber part (mesocarp) of oil palm fruits (Khor et al., 2009; Lee and Ofori-Boateng, 2013; Poh et al., 2020). PPF mainly contains a mix of palm mesocarp fiber, kernel shell, crushed kernel fragments, and little concentration (5–6%) of oil residue after crude palm oil extraction (Neoh et al., 2011; Poh and Chong, 2009). For every ton of FFB, 670 kg of mesocarp fiber is generated, which is estimated to produce about 1.6 tons of PFF per hectare land of oil palm (Khor et al., 2009). This recovered fiber is normally utilized as a fuel to generate energy for the milling process with calorific values of 18.6 GJ/ton (Neoh et al., 2011). In the development, the remaining nutrient in PPF can still be extracted from the remaining oil contained inside (Neoh et al., 2011). PFF is usually used as a boiler fuel in a mixture with another palm oil solid biomass due to its high moisture content (36–40%) (Neoh et al., 2011; Poh et al., 2020). PFF consist of 30.3% lignin, 21.4% cellulose, and 21.7% hemicellulose (Souza et al., 2016). Considering its sugar content on a dry basis, PPF contains pentosan, 1.3% mannose, 2.5% arabinose, 33.1% xylose, 1.0% galactose, and 66.4% glucose (Abdul Khalil et al., 2008). Chemical composition analysis shows that PPF contains about 39.0% fatty acid, 76.0% volatile matter, 12.4% fixed carbon, 5.3% ash, 50.3% carbon, 7.1% hydrogen, 0.4% nitrogen, 0.6% sulfur, and 36.3% oxygen (Azali et al., 2005)."
8,Potential of resources recovered from palm oil industrial waste,"The oil palm tree residue and POME are rich in biomass resources; hence, they must be utilized for more beneficial purposes. It is known that resources such as activated carbon, bio-oil, biochar, biohydrogen, biohythane, biomethane, etc., can be recovered from palm oil industrial waste via various types of physico-chemical and biological processes (Abnisa et al., 2013; Mahat and Shamsudin, 2020; Zainal et al., 2019). Since large quantities of POME are generated during the processing of oil palm, this represents an opportunity to recover a large number of resources from it. The most popular resource recovery from POME is biogas by anaerobic digestion (Sulaiman et al., 2011). Moreover, fertilizer can also be derived from POME and further used in the agricultural sector (Ugoji, 1997). Apart from that, huge quantities of biomass residues such as EFB, OPT, etc., can be utilized to produce various types of products. EFB and OPF have been widely used in the paper and pulp industry in Malaysia for the production of wood-free paper products (Mahat and Shamsudin, 2020). Various types of wood, such as saw-wood and plywood or lumber, can be produced from oil palm trunks, where it can be further used for the production of blackboards and furniture (Mahat and Shamsudin, 2020). The lignocellulosic materials rich oil palm biomass can also be used for the production of carbon molecular sieve that is used as an absorbent for gases and liquids (Ahmad et al., 2008). Despite the potential products mentioned, the most attractive product that can be generated from palm oil industrial waste is hydrogen. Hydrogen can be generated from both the solid and liquid wastes from the palm oil industry. Hydrogen can be used to replace any application that is still relying on fossil fuels. Hydrogen may also be utilized as a feedstock, especially clean vehicle fuels, or as a gaseous fuel for electricity generation (Barbir, 2009). The major advantage of using hydrogen as a transportation fuel is its higher engine efficiencies and zero emissions from its combustion (Neef, 2009). Biohydrogen can also be further processed into biohythane as an attractive alternative fuel due to its prominent advantage of high calorific value from hydrogen that can be stored using current natural gas facilities. Therefore, it justifies the use of palm oil industrial waste for biohydrogen production."
9,Dark fermentation,
10,The general aspect of dark fermentation,"4.1 The general aspect of dark fermentation Dark fermentation is an anaerobic process involving the conversion of organic substrates to biohydrogen and by-products such as VFAs and carbon dioxide (CO2) under light-independent conditions (Hay et al., 2013). The production pathway of dark fermentation is illustrated in Fig. 2 . There are two key enzymes involved in the process, which are [Fe–Fe] hydrogenase and formate hydrogen lyase (Argun and Kargi, 2011). These enzymes are known to be able to be expressed in anaerobic conditions and are oxygen-sensitive (Argun and Kargi, 2011). The most fundamental classification of reactors used for dark fermentation includes batch, continuous, and semi-continuous; whereas, the most commonly used bioreactor configurations are continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR), up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB), anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR), and membrane bioreactor (MBR) (Łukajtis et al., 2018). Unlike biophotolysis of water and photo-fermentation, which are light-dependent processes, dark fermentation does not require light energy and has a low energy requirement (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019). Dark fermentation potentially plays a crucial role in palm oil industrial waste treatment as it can employ a wide range of biomasses as feedstock for biohydrogen production (Chong et al., 2009b; Urbaniec and Bakker, 2015). The main limitation of dark fermentation is its low hydrogen yield, as large quantities of substrates are converted to unfavourable by-products (Dinesh et al., 2018). An experimental study reported that the key by-products usually form included acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which accounted for 80–90% of the VFAs formed (Rajagopal et al., 2014). Theoretically, the maximum hydrogen yield from 1 mol of glucose is 4 mol of hydrogen when acetic acid is the only VFA produced; whereas, the maximum yield of 2 mol-H2/mol-glucose when butyric acid is the only VFA product formed, as shown in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) (Das et al., 2008). However, the hydrogen yield in actual practice is always lower as glucose is required to support and maintain the microbial growth instead of biohydrogen production, as well as the ideal condition will not be easily achieved since other by-products are always prompted to be produced depending on the operating conditions (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009; Hay et al., 2013). Besides, as shown in the equations, the negative Gibbs free energy for both reactions indicated the more favourable thermodynamic formation of both acetic and butyric acids, which implies that both acids would normally be present amongst the final product metabolites and biohydrogen yield is therefore always lower than 4 mol-H2/mol-glucose (Argun and Kargi, 2011). Eq. 1 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 4 H 2 + 2 C H 3 C O O H + 2 C O 2 Δ G ∘ = − 206.0 k J / m o l Eq. 2 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + C H 3 C H 2 C O O H + 2 C O 2 Δ G ∘ = − 254.0 k J / m o l Hydrogen production yield and rate were observed to be controlled by many key operational factors such as pH, temperature, and partial pressure. The development of by-products is known to cause inhibition of hydrogen production as high concentration of VFA is being produced that causes a surge in the pH of the substrate. The influence of pH was studied by van Ginkel and Logan (2005), in which the result showed that the hydrogen yields were inhibited by more than 93% when self-produced acids (acetic and butyric undissociated acid) reach a pH of 5.0 (60 nM). That study also reported that the hydrogen production inhibitory effect of butyric acid is far greater than acetic acid as butyric acid is more toxic than acetic acid in the fermentation processes (Ezeji et al., 2004). The toxic effect of undissociated acids is caused by an increase in the ionic strength of the solution, causing non-polar undissociated acid to penetrate the cell wall at low pH, resulting in extra energy requirement to maintain the internal neutrality (Ginkel et al., 2001). In general, the optimum pH for dark fermentation is reported to be within a range from 6.8 to 8.0 (Sinha and Pandey, 2011). However, the pH commonly used in dark fermentation of POME for biohydrogen production is within the range of 5.5–7.0 (Garritano et al., 2018). For instance, the experimental results by Chong et al. (2009a) showed that the optimum hydrogen production ability occurred at pH 5.5 using Clostridium butyricum for biohydrogen production from POME. Additionally, temperature also affects biohydrogen production by altering the metabolic pathways of the fermentative bacteria population (Sinha and Pandey, 2011). The dark fermentation process is primarily operated at mesophilic (25–40°C), thermophilic (40–65°C) (Madaki and Seng, 2013), and in the few studies using hyperthermophilic (>80°C) temperatures (Abreu et al., 2019). Apart from influencing the metabolic pathways of fermentative bacteria, the temperature can also influence the microbial community in the reactor. Generally, facultative Enterobacteriaceae and strictly anaerobic Clostridiacease were found to be the dominant mesophilic bacteria, whereas the thermophile bacteria belong to the genus Thermoanaerobacterium was also reported in some studies (Lee et al., 2011; Sompong et al., 2008). Researchers have become interested in thermophilic bacteria belonging to the genus Thermoanaerobacterium because of their ability to utilize hemicellulose, either directly or indirectly through the degradation of cellulose (Cao et al., 2014). Additionally, these thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria have proven to be able to grow on a diverse range of complex and simple carbohydrates, including cellulose, xylan, glucose, and xylose (Jiang et al., 2019). Consequently, the application of dark fermentation for the treatment of oil palm solid residue with high levels of cellulose, glucose, and xylose presents a potential opportunity (Loh and Choo, 2013; Zahari et al., 2012). Tanikkul et al. (2019b) reported that the mesophilic condition was more suitable for biohydrogen production in ozonated POME when compared to the thermophilic and extreme thermophilic conditions in a recent study. Furthermore, partial pressure also plays an important role in the hydrogen yield by the dark fermentation process. This occurs due to the thermodynamics of oxidation and the reduction of ferredoxin by hydrogenase. According to recent literatures, a higher partial pressure of hydrogen causes an undesired shift in the reaction, which results in the reduction of ferredoxin production and, as a result, this phenomenon inhibits the conversion of the substrate to biohydrogen (Ghimire et al., 2015; Łukajtis et al., 2018). The effect of hydrogen partial pressure was demonstrated by Lee et al. (2012), in which their result showed that a reduction in pressure increased the hydrogen production by 8% from 0.348 mol/L/d at 760 mm Hg to 0.376 mol/L/d at 380 mm Hg. In addition, the effect of decreasing pressure on increasing hydrogen production has also been demonstrated, but the predominant products were found to be acetate and butyrate, both of which are primary soluble metabolite products. The removal of the produced hydrogen from the system is therefore critical in order to avoid inhibition caused by the high partial pressure of hydrogen (Ghimire et al., 2015; Ukajtis et al., 2018; Ghimire et al., 2018). It is noteworthy to mention that, other methods of lowering the hydrogen concentration in the system have been developed; for example, Mizuno et al. (2000) used nitrogen sparging to increase the rate of hydrogen production and the yield of hydrogen by two-folds when compared to the results of a typical process. However, because of the dilution of the sparging stream, the recovery of hydrogen was rendered ineffective; as a result, a more effective method of reducing the hydrogen partial pressure would be to continuously collect the produced gas phase from the reactor (Ghimire et al., 2015). To circumvent the dilution problem associated with nitrogen use, another purging gas can be used. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a possible candidate because it can be separated from the mixed gas stream using potassium carbonate or mono-ethanol amine MEA absorption. After steam stripping the CO2-rich stream to remove CO2 and obtain a lean absorbing solution, and thereafter, the separation cycle can be repeated. The stripped CO2 can be separated into two streams; one is intended to be purged from the system, while the other is intended to be recycled into the reactor to purify the gases contained within. This strategy may result in a decrease in the solubility of hydrogen within the reaction medium, thereby reducing or eliminating any possible inhibition. Another option is to use a membrane reactor equipped with a vacuum pump to remove the gases from the reaction medium in a controlled manner. Thus, using the aforementioned absorption system, these gases, namely hydrogen and CO2, can be easily separated. A comparative techno-economic analysis will result in the identification of the technically and economically optimal and feasible option."
11,POME treatment via dark fermentation,"4.2 POME treatment via dark fermentation To date, many studies have been focusing on the treatment of POME using dark fermentation of biohydrogen recovery using various types of reactor configurations, as summarized in Table 4 . A completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was applied for biohydrogen production from POME under thermophilic conditions by Ismail et al. (2010). The biohydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield from POME at a temperature of 55°C were 2.64 m3/m3/d and 1.72 mol-H2/mol-hexose, respectively, at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 days. The hydrogen fraction in the biogas was considered high (52% of the total biogas) and the methanogenic activity was not detected over the 60 days of continuous operation. It was inferred that the inhibition of methanogenic activity was successful by controlling the pH at values < 5.5. Besides, the operation performance of an UASB bioreactor for biohydrogen production using nitric acid pre-treated POME as feedstock was tested by Mahmod et al. (2019). The highest hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate of 2.45 mol-H2/mol-sugar and 11.75 L-H2/L-POME/d, respectively, was achieved at a HRT of 6 h. On the contrary, a lengthy start-up time of up to 2–4 months for the growth of microbial granular remains a major disadvantage of UASB reactors for biohydrogen production (Chong et al., 2009a; Mohammadi et al., 2014). Alternatively, an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket-fixed film (UASB-FF) reactor was proposed by Mohammadi et al. (2014). The inoculum for the reactor was from the digested sludge from palm oil mill and it was pre-treated by heating at 100°C for 1 h to enrich hydrogenic microbes. In that study, pre-settled POME was used as a feedstock. A specific hydrogen production rate of 0.514 L-H2/g-VSS d was achieved on day 22 after the start-up period under the operational conditions of 38°C and a pH of 5.5 with an HRT of 24 h. The development of bio-granules was improved due to biomass recirculation and the establishment of fixed-film in the upper section of the reactor, which resulted in higher interaction among the different bacterial consortium (Mohammadi et al., 2014). The utilization of granular activated carbon in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) was tested for biohydrogen production under thermophilic conditions using POME as a feedstock (Jamali et al., 2019). At an optimum pH of 6.0, hydrogen production of 2.8 mmol-H2/L/h and hydrogen yield of 1.24 mol-H2/mol-sugar was obtained. The lower hydrogen yield compared to the findings by Mahmod et al. (2019) might be due to differences in the pre-treatment strategies adopted for POME. Furthermore, different potential microorganisms for biohydrogen recovery from POME were tested for their ability for hydrogen recovery from complex organic matter. Pure culture or mixed cultures can be used for the dark fermentation processes (Garritano et al., 2018). In a study by Mishra et al. (2017), an indigenous mesophilic bacterium, Bacillus anthracis, was isolated from POME sludge and investigated for its ability for biohydrogen production. Under the determined optimum conditions of pH 6.5 and 35°C, a maximum hydrogen yield of 2.42 mol-H2/mol-mannose was achieved. Clostridium butyricum, a potential hydrogen producer, isolated from digested palm oil effluent sludge was tested for its ability to recover hydrogen for POME (Chong et al., 2009a), in which the results showed 3195 mL-H2/L-POME of maximum hydrogen production at the temperature of 37°C and pH 5.5. POME sludge represents a good source of natural mixed culture for the mesophilic production of biohydrogen from POME in the dark fermentation process (Rasdi et al., 2012). Using mixed culture from POME sludge under predetermined optimized conditions of pH 5.9 and temperature 36°C, the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rates of 282 mL-H2/g-carbohydrate and 137 mL/h, respectively, was reported by the authors (Rasdi et al., 2012). Hydrogen production from POME using mixed culture was also tested at a thermophilic temperature of 60°C and pH 5.5 (Atif et al., 2005). The maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield from the batch reactor was found to be 454 mL-H2/L-POME/h and 4708 mL-H2/L-POME, respectively (Atif et al., 2005). In the case of different thermophilic bacteria, the consortia on hydrogen production were analysed by Nitipan et al. (2014). Among the mixed culture in sludge taken from a hydrogen-producing reactor treating POME, Thermoanaerobacterium sp. (∼66%) was found to be dominant, followed by Clostridium and Desulfotomaculum sp. (approximately 28% and 6%, respectively). Batch fermentation was then carried out to determine the hydrogen-producing potential of the Thermoanaerobacterium HPB-2 strain under thermophilic fermentative condition, and the resultsshowed that it was a promising candidate with the capability to produce a hydrogen yield of 2.53 mol-H2/mol-hexose. Using an empirical model, the optimum conditions of pH, temperature and inoculum size for hydrogen recovery from acid-hydrolyzed POME via dark fermentation were determined by Azman et al. (2016). The empirical model suggested the optimum conditions for hydrogen production from pre-treated POME to be at 38°C, pH of 5.9, and an inoculum (C. acetobutylicum) size of 17.61%. While under this condition, the verification experiment showed that a hydrogen yield of 108.35 mL-H2/g-TS (Total sugar) was produced. In a more recent study, the operational and environmental variables on biohydrogen production using POME was investigated by Zainal et al. (2018). Using Response Surface Methodology, the optimum condition found for temperature, inoculum size to substrate ratios and the reaction time were 50 °C, 4:5, and 8 h, respectively. Instead of using dilute POME, the POME was first pre-settled before being subjected to dark fermentation, which results in a hydrogen yield of 28.47 mL-H2/g-COD using a batch reactor. The two main findings confirm that a shorter reaction time can significantly enhance the hydrogen production rate and the inoculum size has a large influence on the hydrogen yield (Zainal et al., 2018). This was confirmed by Mishra et al. (2019), where it was concluded that the substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.5 and initial pH of 5.0 gives the highest hydrogen yield (0.416 L-H2/g-COD) in their study. However, the maximum hydrogen production rate of 14.62 mL-H2/h and 18 mL-H2/h was observed using a substrate-inoculum ratio of 0.4 and 0.6 with a different lag time of 8.2 h and 16.8 h, respectively. 4.2.1 Pre-treatment Although POME was considered as a potential substrate for hydrogen recovery due to the high content of carbohydrates, protein, nitrogenous compounds, lipids, and minerals, it is comparatively resistant to biodegradation (Fakhru'l-Razi et al., 2005). Clearly, pre-treatment is an important process to release the fermentable sugars in POME for biohydrogen production. Many studies have been conducted in order to increase the solubility and release the fermentable monomeric sugar that can be further converted to hydrogen via biological means. Among all the studies reviewed, pre-treatment methods were used to maximize hydrogen recovery from POME, as shown in Table 4. Phosphoric acid at 0.8% (w/v) showed better performance in hydrolyzing POME compared to nitric acid at 1% (w/v), with the hydrogen production rate of 0.18 and yield 1.24 mol-H2/mol-glucose, which greatly improved by 97% compared to untreated POME (Mahmod et al., 2017). It is also worth mentioning that pre-treating temperature can also considerably influence the solubility of sugar content in POME (Mahmod et al., 2017). Aside from acid pre-treatment, the enzyme was proven to be an effective way for pre-treating POME (Garritano et al., 2017). The plant enzyme extracted from dormant castor bean seeds of Ricinus communis L. was used to pre-treat POME prior to dark fermentation. The results showed that the hydrogen yield was successfully increased by 102% to 2.58 mmol-H2/g-COD compared to raw POME. Moreover, the ozonation pre-treatment of POME was verified to significantly improve the performance of hydrogen production under mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic fermentation conditions (Pisutpaisal et al., 2014). It was demonstrated that, ozonation of POME has the ability to increase the degradability of POME constitute and influence the yield and production rate of hydrogen from 28.3 ± 2.1 mL-H2/g-COD to 30.9 ± 2.2 mL-H2/g-COD and 5.0 ± 0.7 mL/h to 12.8 ± 1.3 mL/h, respectively, under mesophilic conditions (Pisutpaisal et al., 2014). This result was also verified by the findings of Tanikkul et al. (2019a). Ozonation pre-treatment was also illustrated to be effective under thermophilic conditions. For instance, in the findings of Tanikkul and Pisutpaisal (2014), the main by-product such as acetic and butyric acids in dark fermentation was found to be accumulated more in the raw POME fermentation than the ozonated POME fermentation. In contrast to mesophilic conditions, it was shown that the hydrogen yield was better when dark fermentation was carried out under thermophilic conditions when ozonation pre-treatment was used (Tanikkul and Pisutpaisal, 2014)."
12,Oil palm biomass treatment via dark fermentation,"4.3 Oil palm biomass treatment via dark fermentation Oil palm biomass characteristics such as its high biodegradable organic content and high nutrient content make them suitable as a potential feedstock for biohydrogen production for sustainable energy resource development as they are abundant and renewable (Chen et al., 2013). Various oil palm biomass have been tested for biohydrogen production, as shown in Table 5 . These characteristics also have made them a perfect co-feedstock for biogas production (Chen et al., 2013). For example, OPF juice has high glucose and nitrogen content, making it a very good co-feedstock for biohydrogen production from sewage sludge to supplement the proper C/N ratio and protein content that can be served as the nutrient source for microbial growth (Yasin et al., 2013). The yield of biohydrogen was observed to be increased from 1.3 to 1.5 mol-H2/mol-glucose. In the same study, a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain was used, and the result revealed that the biohydrogen productivity was 854 μmol/1010 cfu when OPF juice was used as the only substrate. Moreover, the oil palm decanter residue was also revealed as an attractive co-feedstock for biogas production (Kanchanasuta and Pisutpaisal, 2017). The main reason is that various types of bacteria of the indigenous microbes from DC can potentially enhance biogas productivity (Kanchanasuta and Pisutpaisal, 2017). A limited number of bacteria are known to able to convert oil palm sap effectively into hydrogen (Noparat et al., 2012). Comparing studies of dark fermentation of OTP for biohydrogen production, thermophilic bacteria (Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum) showed higher yield compared to mesophilic bacteria (Clostridium sp. and Lactobacillus sp.). According to Noparat et al. (2012), various bacteria ranging from mesophilic to thermophilic bacteria have shown high hydrogen production potential from OP sap as summarized in Table S2. In that study, it was also noted that the presence of Sporolactobacillus sp., lactic acid-producing bacteria, are likely to be responsible for low hydrogen production (Noparat et al., 2012). 4.3.1 Pre-treatment Oil palm biomass, as discussed in the previous section, contains a high amount of lignocellulosic materials. Therefore, the pre-treatment process plays an important role in releasing fermentable sugar for biohydrogen production since the lignocellulosic materials have a rather complex structure and complex composition (Chen et al., 2013). In the following section, the pre-treatment and biohydrogen production potential from oil palm biomass, in particular, oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) and OPT, will be discussed on a per case basis. In one study, before OPEFB was used in fermentative biohydrogen production, it was subjected to 5% (v/v) sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at 10 (w/v) solid-liquid ratio for 60 min (Gonzales et al., 2016), and a peak hydrogen production rate of 2640 mL H2/L/d was obtained using dark fermentation in a batch reactor. The hydrogen yield from oil palm was comparable to those from pine tree wood and slightly lower than the values obtained from rice husk (Gonzales et al., 2016). In the following study by Gonzales et al. (2019), the optimal concentration of dilute acid and enzymatic hydrolysis as pre-treatment of OPEFB for biohydrogen production via dark fermentation was determined. The optimum conditions for pre-treatment of OPEFB for hydrogen production via dark fermentation were a temperature of 120°C for 1 h using 6 vol% of H2SO4, and the resulting hydrogen production rate was 2601.24 mL-H2/L/d and a hydrogen yield of 275.75 mL-H2/g-TS was obtained using response surface methodology optimization. In the subsequent experiment, significant improvement was observed when the acid-treated OPEFB was further treated using a hydrolytic enzyme to enhance the hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rate, where the production rate and hydrogen yield were increased to 283.91 mL-H2/g-TS and 3266.86 mL-H2/L/d, respectively. Using similar H2SO4 acid for hydrolysis of substrate, a relatively similar optimum conditions of 6% H2SO4 concentration (w/v), 121°C with a shorter reaction time of 15 min was proposed by Chong et al. (2013). The results of that study showed hydrogen yield and hydrogen production rates of 1.98 mol-H2/mol-xylose and 2.505 mmol/L/h, respectively. A more sophisticated method was employed by Abdul et al. (2016) using the ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) method, which involved processes such as cleaning, shredding, drying, and grinding. AFEX was carried in a high-pressure Parr reactor by filling OPEFB and ammonia in a 1:1 ratio and heating up to 135°C for 45 min. After that, the substrate was dried and stored at an extremely cold temperature of −20°C. The fermented products were showing higher constitutes of hydrogen and a lower percentage of by-products such as butyric acid, acetic acid, and ethanol compared to the control set of synthesis medium, giving a yield of 1.68 mol-H2/mol-sugar consumed. Apart from that, OPEFB can be utilized for biohydrogen production after processing it into molasses for better accessibility towards its fermentable sugars (Abdul et al., 2013). The processed product underwent dark fermentation using Clostridium butyricum for biohydrogen production. Under optimum conditions, the hydrogen yield of 1.12 mol-H2/mol-pentose was obtained. Also, it is worth mentioning that the optimum pH was unexpectedly alkali than the usual dark fermentation process, where the authors inferred the reason for this high pH was due to the existence of fermentation inhibitors in the OPEFB molasses such as furfural. Pre-treatment involving microwave and H2SO4 acid treatment under the determined optimum conditions for the hydrolysis of OPT was 1.56% (w/v) H2SO4 and 7.5 min reaction time at 450 W was reported to yield 8.95 ± 0.99 g/L-glucose/L, 8.29 ± 0.43 g/L-xylose, 4.57 ± 0.14 g/L-arabinose, and 2.61 ± 0.11 g/L-acetic were successfully extracted from OPT (Khamtib et al., 2011). Using hot spring enriched culture predominant with Clostridium sp. and Lactobacillus sp., hydrogen yield of 1969.26 mL-H2/L-medium was achieved. Furthermore, biohydrogen production from OPT was studied in a two-stage thermophilic fermentation by Sitthikitpanya et al. (2017). The OPT was first subjected to the pre-treatment of lime and enzymatic treatment of hydrolysis at a lime loading rate of 0.2 g-lime/g-OPT for a period of 1 h, at a temperature of 121°C and enzyme loading rate of 35 filter paper units/g-OPT. The concentrations of total reducing sugar, glucose, xylose, and arabinose at the optimum conditions were 24 g/L, 13 g/L, 9 g/L, and 1 g/L, respectively, which is slightly improved compared to the result reported in another study (Khamtib et al., 2011). The product, i.e. the OPT hydrolysate, was subjected to dark fermentation process, under the optimum condition of 16.5 g/L initial substrate concentration, with an initial pH and temperature of 6.7 and 54.5 °C, respectively, which was used as a substrate by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum and it showed a maximum hydrogen production of 2179 mL-H2/L-substrate (Sitthikitpanya et al., 2017). Alternatively, instead of using enzyme in the pre-treatment stage, saccharification and fermentation process was simultaneously carried out under the optimum conditions determined using Plackett-Burman design (substrate loading, enzyme loading, inoculum concentration, initial pH and temperature of 4.6%, 10 FPU/g-OPT, 10%(v/v), 6.3 and 50°C, respectively), resulting in a hydrogen yield of 60.22 mL-H2/g-OPT (Sitthikitpanya et al., 2018)."
13,Enhancement strategy for biohydrogen production,"4.4 Enhancement strategy for biohydrogen production Enhancement of biohydrogen production through co-digestion of solid waste with POME in a two-stage thermophilic fermentation process was proved to be an effective method to increase the production of biohythane (biogas mixture of hydrogen and methane) by 67–114% compared to digestion of POME alone (Mamimin et al., 2019). Interestingly, the combination of both solid and liquid fractions of palm oil industrial wastes, namely OPEFB, DC, PPF, OPF, OPT, and POME was used for biohydrogen production could improve biohydrogen gas quality and enhance its degradation efficiency, which resulted from the high biodegradability of solid waste during the production of biohydrogen under two-stage thermophilic fermentation conditions (55°C). Among the different combinations of solid waste and POME, POME and PPF showed the greatest improvement in terms of biohydrogen production compared to POME alone. The microbial community that was primarily responsible for hydrogen production found for co-digestion of solid waste with POME was dominated by Enterobacter sp., Clostridium sp., and Megasphaera sp. (Mamimin et al., 2019). Besides, hydrogen production using POME and DC under a thermophilic condition was tested in another study, where the results indicate hydrogen production from co-fermentation POME with 5 g/L-DC was far more efficient compared to POME alone with values of 2.6 and 1.7 L-H2/L-POME, respectively (Mamimin et al., 2016). Under long-term continuous hydrogen production experimental conditions, the enhancement was more significant by 3 times, wherein a hydrogen yield of 7.2 L-H2/L-POME and a hydrogen production rate of 18.1 mmol-H2/L/h was achieved (Mamimin et al., 2016). From the studies discussed above, the co-digestion strategy could be a promising method for biohydrogen recovery simultaneously from both liquid and solid residue from palm oil industrial waste. Many studies have been conducted by researchers using nutrient supplement strategies such as carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio adjustment and ferric ion addition to enhance the production of biohydrogen from POME (Abdullah et al., 2020). It was also reported that the optimum C/N ratio was 140, which resulted in a 33.80% increase in hydrogen production when untreated raw POME was used as the substrate, and a 15.53% increase when 100 mg/L of ferric ion was added to the mixture. In contrast, O-Thong et al. (2007) used a longer retention time of 4 days instead of 2 days, resulting in a higher hydrogen yield of 2.24 mol-H2/mol-sugar as opposed to 1.88 mol-H2/mol-sugar. Under thermophilic conditions, using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, the hydrogen yield ranged from 1.6 ± 0.1 to 2.24 ± 0.03 mol-H2/mol-hexose and the hydrogen production rate ranged from 4.4 ± 0.38 to 6.1 ± 0.03 L-H2/L-POME/d after adjusting the nutrient content within POME with ferric ion (257 mg/L), a C/N ratio of 95–74, and a C/P ratio of 650–559. The strategy of nutrient supplementation was shown to have a significant impact on the bacterial diversity in the reactor, resulting in the promotion of a specific growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria such as Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum in the reactor (O-Thong et al., 2007). Apart from the enhancement methods mentioned above, two-stage systems or coupled systems were often used to enhance hydrogen production from various feedstocks (Meky et al., 2020; Mıynat et al., 2020; Varanasi and Das, 2020). Utilizing two different temperature systems was also proven to be able to effectively improve the ability to recover hydrogen from POME (Maaroff et al., 2019). Two-stage temperature conditions of biohydrogen production in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) system was employed as a technique to increase the hydrogen production from POME. Pre-treated POME was first subjected to thermophilic fermentation, and then mesophilic fermentation was introduced in the next stage. The result showed that the hydrogen production rate was improved from 8.54 mmol-H2/L/h in a single-stage reactor to 10.34 mmol-H2/L/h. It was deduced that the improvement in the hydrogen production rate was mainly due to the unutilized sugar from the first thermophilic stage which was further digested in the second stage for biohydrogen production (Maaroff et al., 2019). Another example, two-stage sequential dark and photo-fermentation, have been used to enhance hydrogen production from POME (Mishra et al., 2016). POME was first subjected to treatment via dark fermentation using C. butyricum at conditions of pH 5.5 and 37±1°C in a CSTR reactor, and the hydrogen yield observed was 0.784 mL-H2/ml-POME. The dark fermented effluent was then diluted and treated with photo-fermentation, and the total hydrogen yield increased significantly to 3.064 mL-H2/mL-POME. The combined process of dark and photo-fermentation has also proven to significantly increase the maximum hydrogen yield of water hyacinth feedstock in another study from 76.7 mL H2/g-TVS (dark fermentation only) to 596.1 mL H2/g-TVS (Su et al., 2010). Dark fermentation can produce short-chain organic acids and alcohol, which can be reutilized as substrates if linked with photo-fermentation (Hay et al., 2013). Mishra et al. (2016) remarked that the increasing hydrogen yield from 0.78 mL-H2/mL-POME to 2.86 mL-H2/mL-POME after photo-fermentation was due to the formation of soluble metabolites by-products from dark fermentation, which can be utilized effectively by the photo-fermenter in the second stage. However, research on this method using palm oil waste as feedstock has not been intensively examined. Coupled dark fermentation with MEC was demonstrated by Khongkliang et al. (2019), in which the hydrogen yield was observed to increase from 73 mL-H2/g-COD in dark fermentation alone to 236 mL-H2/g-COD in a coupled system that is approximately 3 times the yield obtained in dark fermentation alone. From the studies and results shown, such application of coupled systems shows a promising way for high yield biohydrogen recovery from POME and a possible application at the industrial scale."
14,Photo-fermentation,
15,The general aspect of photo-fermentation,"5.1 The general aspect of photo-fermentation In photo-fermentation, biohydrogen is being produced by the photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria or purple non-sulfur (PNS) bacteria, like Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These strains of bacteria are capable of reducing protons into hydrogen gas by using extra energy from the photosynthesis electron transport system (Budiman and Wu, 2016; Kirtay, 2011; Mudhoo and Kumar, 2013). Thus, under the nitrogen-deficient and photo-anaerobic environments, PNS bacteria can convert organic compounds into hydrogen and carbon dioxide using its nitrogenase enzyme activity. Different types of bacteria have been reported to have the potential to produce high biohydrogen production yield, for instance, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodopsuedomonas palustris, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Rhodospirillum rubrum, and other mixed culture bacteria (Assawamongkholsiri and Reungsang, 2015; Dinesh et al., 2018; Eroǧ;lu et al., 2008; Jamil et al., 2009; Pott et al., 2013; Seifert et al., 2010; Tawfik et al., 2014). These bacteria use sunlight to convert the different carbon sources, i.e., simple sugar or different volatile fatty acids, into hydrogen and CO2, as shown in Fig. 3 (Manish and Banerjee, 2008; Tian et al., 2019). Eq. 3 C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O → s u n l i g h t 12 H 2 + 6 C O 2 Δ G ∘ = + 3.2 k J / m o l From the equation above, it can be concluded that 1 mol of glucose substrate theoretically can produce 12 mol of hydrogen and 6 mol of CO2; whereas, other carbon substrates will produce different amounts of hydrogen and CO2 based on the chemical characteristics. However, according to the Gibbs free energy showed in Eq. (3), the complete oxidation of glucose into hydrogen and carbon dioxide is not possible thermodynamically (Wong et al., 2014). Concerning the incomplete oxidation of glucose, it is recommended to follow the procedure of the two-stage fermentation process (Reungsang et al., 2018). In the first stage, biomass will be treated using a dark fermentation process, which will result in the production of biohydrogen as well as other volatile acids, such as acetic and butyric acids. During the second stage, in which the photo-fermentation process produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide, it could also be supplied with the acidic products from the first stage. This technique is assumed to theoretically produce the highest hydrogen yield among all the techniques/technologies discussed in this review paper. Furthermore, it was reported that wastewater, such as from olive mill, tofu, dairy industry, etc., is a potential photo-fermentation substrate due to its high organic matter (COD) content (Hay et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). Moreover, photo-fermentation is considered to be one of the most convenient biological processes to produce biohydrogen due to its high theoretical conversion yield, ability to reuse waste materials as substrates, the possibility to use a wide range of the light spectrum, and absence of any oxygen-evolving activities (Budiman and Wu, 2016; Das and Veziroǧ;lu, 2001). The different studies that use photo-fermentation for biohydrogen recovery from palm oil industry wastes are summarized in Table 6 . However, photo-fermentation has low biohydrogen yield due to the poor light-conversion efficiency as it requires high energy during the nitrogenase-catalyzed reaction, which limits its practical feasibility to produce biohydrogen (Veeravalli et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2014). The treatment of feedstock prior to hydrogen recovery is necessary to remove any inhibitor present in the substrate (Wong et al., 2014). In addition, photo-fermentative biohydrogen production is a complex system involving physical, chemical, and biological processes. The performance and yield of the photo-fermentation process are influenced by different factors like temperature, pH, light efficiency (light intensity and wavelength), culture medium, HRT, and ammonia formation (Zhang and Zhang, 2018). In the future, considerable efforts must be made in order to understand the mechanism of the system, in-depth and promote the technology from the lab-scale to the pilot and commercial/full-scale level. As the name of the process suggests, the conversion of hydrogen from different substrates is highly dependent on the presence of light. Androga et al. (2014) suggested that the supplied incident light energy during photo-fermentation was one of the essential requirements in order to meet the high energy demand of the photosynthetic system to trigger the photo biohydrogen production mechanisms. For example, studies were done by Seifert et al. (2010), and Suwansaard et al. (2009), where from their experiment, the influence of light intensity can be compared. Seifert et al. (2010) obtained a maximum biohydrogen production of 2.2 mL-H2/mL-medium with 1.7% light efficiency compared to Suwansaard et al. (2009) who achieved 2.2 mL-H2/mL-medium with 1.07% light efficiency. The concentration of olive mill wastewater was improved/adjusted by diluting the wastewater with distilled water. Likewise, according to Wu et al. (2013), the pre-treatment of certain wastewaters, typically by dilution, was an important step in the photo-fermentation process as the biohydrogen production yield may get affected by the opacity of the wastewater. After the different studies reported in the literature, it was found out that the most favourable temperature for photo-fermentation was in the range of 28°C to 32°C (mesophilic condition), while the optimum pH was around the neutral (7.0) environment (Tian et al., 2019). Besides, HRT was found to be an important parameter that is needed for the continuous operational mode in order to accomplish an optimum balance between the production rate, the substrate conversion efficiency, and the light energy in the photo-fermentation process. Previous studies have found that the HRT of most photo-fermentation experiments was lasting longer than that of dark fermentation due to the slower metabolic rate of photosynthetic bacteria, which can last up to five days, compared to dark fermentation bacteria (Tian et al., 2019). However, for effective photo-fermentation, mesophilic conditions are preferred because they are the most favourable for nitrogenase enzymes to function and catalyze hydrogen production (Reungsang et al., 2018). Higher temperatures can inhibit the enzyme's activity and cause it to lose its activity during long term bioreactor operation. Hydrogenase enzymes, on the other hand, are more tolerant to heat and more thermophilic in nature. Operating under thermophilic conditions can significantly improve the reaction kinetics and, as a result, the rate at which the biohydrogen is produced. Therefore, it is recommended that, future research studies should focus on developing a more resistant genetically engineered nitrogenase bacteria that is capable of withstanding higher temperatures. On the other hand, the photosynthetic bacteria have limited abilities to capture sunlight or light in general, yet they have a higher energy demand and activation energy requirement than other bacteria (Hitam and Jalil, 2020). As a result, future genetic engineering-based research will be required in order to improve the performance of the nitrogenase and hydrogenase bacteria, as well as the enzymes involved in the biochemical reactions. These improved new bacteria should have a greater ability to capture light, consume less energy, and withstand harsh thermophilic and transient state conditions."
16,POME treatment via photo-fermentation,"5.2 POME treatment via photo-fermentation Biohydrogen production from POME via photo-fermentation was far less investigated compared to the dark fermentation (see Table 6). This might be due to the low production rate that makes the method not interesting for further research. The highest yield reported was only 1.45 L-H2/L-medium/h, wherein the substrate was combined with pulp and paper mill effluent (Budiman and Wu, 2016). Despite its high theoretical hydrogen yield, the practical application of photo-fermentation indeed is limited by its light energy conversion efficiency (Veeravalli et al., 2019). A popular application of the photo-fermentation process is the recovery of hydrogen from dark fermentation effluent. As mentioned in section 4.4., dark fermentation process can provide more readily available substrates required for the photosynthetic and PNS bacteria. Therefore, it is commonly integrated with photo-fermentation for handling various types of waste (Mishra et al., 2016; Niño-Navarro et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Optimization of this POME treatment using photo-fermentation can be affected by several factors. Mishra et al. (2018a) reported that the optimum conditions for light intensity and agitation rate are 250 W/m2 and 200 rpm, respectively,-where a hydrogen yield of 2.8 mol-H2/mol-acetate was obtained. Moreover, that study also reported a negative impact on hydrogen production when high light intensity was used, implying the need of limiting excessive illumination in the photo-fermentation process. Jamil et al. (2009) reported high hydrogen production rates when a higher concentration of POME was used. From a microbiological viewpoint, other than Rhodopseudomanas palustris (Jamil et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2018a), the use of Chlorella sp. as a potential inocula for photo-fermentative biohydrogen production was proven to be feasible due to its short growth cycle (Liu et al., 2020). 5.2.1 Pre-treatment Pretreatment can help the photo-fermentation process by increasing the light penetration capacity. Photo fermentative bacteria are highly dependent on light for the generation of energy required for the growth and maintenance and subsequently, its conversion to hydrogen from the substrates (Wong et al., 2014). Therefore, light penetration through the medium is important for the recovery of hydrogen via photo-fermentation. As the efficiency of light penetration plays a vital role during photo-fermentation, the use of POME without any dilution or pre-treatment may affect biohydrogen production rate since the dark colour and high turbidity of the wastewater will reduce the light penetration. Dilution is one of the simple yet beneficial pretreatment strategy. Dilution of POME might be as simple as adding demineralized water, but the influences on the hydrogen yield can be large than expected (Cheng et al., 2015). About 30% dilution was found to be the optimum dilution volume for dark fermented POME (Mishra et al., 2018a). Apart from light penetration related factors, dilution is important to get the initial desired medium concentration for bacterial growth, which also influences hydrogen production (Mishra et al., 2018a; Özkan et al., 2012). Besides, dilution can help to reduce the nitrogen content, which can interfere with the nitrogenases enzyme and the volatile fatty acid content in the feed that might be otherwise harmful to the photo-heterotrophic microorganisms (Azbar and Cetinkaya Dokgoz, 2010). Moreover, ultrasonication can also be implemented as a pretreatment step to increase the substrate availability. The application of ultrasonication as a pre-treatment step in a batch photofermentative biohydrogen production was introduced by Budiman and Wu (2016). A mixture of 25:75 (v/v) of POME, pulp and paper mill effluent (PPMF) were used as substrates for R. sphaeroides under 4000 lux illumination. After pre-treatment under ultrasonication with an amplitude of 70% and for 45 min duration, the biohydrogen yield at 30°C was 8.72 mL-H2/mL-medium, while the biohydrogen yield without pre-treatment was 4.67 mL-H2/mL-medium. The result shows that ultrasonication at an amplitude of 70% and 90% can enhance biohydrogen production up to 86.8% and 88.4%, respectively (Budiman and Wu, 2016). The enhancement in biohydrogen production can be explained by the disruption of lignocellulosic materials and the reduction of particle size that makes the substrate more bioavailable for the photosynthetic bacteria."
17,Oil palm biomass treatment via photo-fermentation,"5.3 Oil palm biomass treatment via photo-fermentation Similar to POME, the application of oil palm biomass in photo-fermentation biohydrogen production was only done in a few studies. The hydrogen production rate in several previous studies ranged from 0.024 L-H2/L-POME/h to 51.6 L-H2/L-medium/h, depending on the operational condition and pretreatment strategies adopted (Table 6). The hydrogen production may also be influenced by several factors, especially the light illumination. The most important parameter that plays a role in oil palm biomass conversion to hydrogen by photo-fermentation is the light source and its intensity. A study was been made by Palamae et al. (2018a), where biohydrogen production in a continuous tubular photobioreactor was tested. The photoreactor was illuminated by natural outdoor sunlight and indoor artificial light with an approximate light intensity of 0.15–66 Klux and an intensity of 10 Klux, respectively. The acid hydrolysate of OPEFB (containing 10.4 mM glucose, 129.6 mM xylose, 96.5 mM acetic acid, 7.08 mM furfural, and 0.48 mM hydroxymethylfurfural) was used as carbon sources for Rhodobacter sphaeroides metabolism at 35°C. The optimum substrate feeding rate was 48 L/h, where the feeding rate above that caused a washout of biomass from the reactor. Hydrogen production rate at steady state for outdoor and indoor lighting conditions were 36 mL-H2/L-medium/h and 43 mL-H2/L-medium/h, respectively. The cumulative hydrogen production under the outdoor light (430 mL H2/L medium) was proven to be lower than the indoor lighting assisted reactor (517 mL H2/L medium). However, further analysis showed that sunlight-based photo-fermentation is still preferred in regards to its energy efficiency (Palamae et al., 2018a). The biohydrogen production of photo-fermentation under the different shapes of the photobioreactor vessel was also investigated and reported (Palamae et al., 2018b). Rhodobacter sphaeroides were cultured and added with OPEFB hydrolysate as a carbon source under conditions of 35°C and light intensity of 14.6 W/m2 (10,000 lux) in a batch system. The results showed that a tubular photobioreactor with a high surface area to culture volume ratio (S = 181.7 m−1) was proven to be able to yield a higher hydrogen rate with 51.6 mL-H2/L-medium/h. Another cylindrical bottle with a lower surface area to volume ratio (S = 52.3 m−1) could only yield hydrogen at a rate of 37.4 mL-H2/L-medium/h. The research remarked on the importance of the surface-to-volume ratio of the bioreactor to maximize the irradiance level in order to optimize/enhance biohydrogen production. 5.3.1 Pre-treatment Oil palm biomass with its high lignocellulosic content can serve as a suitable feedstock in a photo-fermentation process for enhanced biohydrogen production. Cellulose and hemicellulose, in particular, contain pentose and hexose that can act as substrates for photosynthetic bacteria (Mamimin et al., 2019). However, making these substrates available for photofermentative bacteria is crucial for the production of biohydrogen. Pattanamanee et al. (2012) investigated the application of photo-fermentation using oil palm waste. OPEFB, in particular, was first subjected to pre-treatment with dilute sulfuric acid at a temperature of 120°C for 15 min. The hydrolysate was analysed with xylose (23.51 g/L), acetic acid (2.44 g/L), and glucose (1.80 g/L) as the major carbon components. Using a batch reactor, under control laboratory conditions of 35°C and an initial pH of 7.0 with 14.6 W/m2 illumination, the hydrogen volumetric production rate was 22.4 mL-H2/L -medium/h where the conversion ratio was 0.29 using an optimized liquid media for cultivation (Pattanamanee et al., 2012)."
18,Enhancement strategy,"5.4 Enhancement strategy The development of photobioreactor design can enhance light optimization for photo-fermentation based biohydrogen production. An increase in light intensity received by purple non-sulfur bacteria can stimulate the nitrogenase enzyme synthesis and subsequently enhance the metabolism of hydrogen production (Hay et al., 2013). However, it is important to point out that excessive light intensity is not preferred, as it may cause an inhibitory effect (Dasgupta et al., 2010). For example, Mishra et al. (2016) experiment demonstrated a decrease in hydrogen yield from POME feedstock at light intensities > 7 Klux. The maximum yield was observed at 7 Klux (2.3 mL-H2/ml-POME), while the lowest yield was found at 9 Klux (1.7 mL-H2/ml-POME). Likewise, in the experiment by Mishra et al. (2018a), high intensity of light showed an adverse impact specific to photo fermentative bacteria, Rhodopseudomanas palustris, on its hydrogen production capacity. Therefore, determining the optimum light intensity can effectively enhance biohydrogen production while saving the unnecessary waste of energy required to achieve high light intensity. It was observed that the surface/volume of the reactor can also influence the light homogeneity, which subsequently influences the photoheterotrophic biomass growth (Argun and Kargi, 2011; Palamae et al., 2018b). In regard to bioreactor geometry, the tubular shape is favourable as it provides a high ratio of irradiated surfaces, yielding up to 4.1 to 4.5 mol-H2/mol-substrate (Basak and Das, 2009; Palamae et al., 2018b). Light intensity in the range of 50–200 μE/m2/s was generally found to be optimal for the photo-fermentation process (Dasgupta et al., 2010). Similar to dark fermentation, the supplement of nutrients has proven to be effective in enhancing biohydrogen production from photo-fermentation. This was demonstrated by Chen et al. (2010), where additional yeast extract and glutamic acid as nutrients were shown to improve the hydrogen production performance. This was agreed by the findings of Pattanamanee et al. (2012), where the yeast extract and glutamic acid were acting as the source of vitamin and inorganic nitrogen source, respectively. In another study, it was shown that, mixed carbon sources fermentation by Rhodobacter sphaeroides could significantly yield higher biohydrogen rates (1–3 times) compared to single carbon sources, presumably because of the alteration of bacteria cultures mode of metabolism (Hakobyan et al., 2019). Moreover, the addition of the micronutrients, namely molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe) is important for nitrogenase enzyme synthesis, while magnesium (Mg) work as a cofactor in bacteriochlorophyll, which subsequently can promote biohydrogen yield if dosed in optimum concentrations (Hay et al., 2013; Pattanamanee et al., 2012). As a part of the enhancement strategy for photo-fermentation, Guo et al. (2011) had come up with an innovative system to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production by using a photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) biofilm in a photobioreactor. The biofilm technique was based on using an optical fiber that showed an increase in the biomass as well as the bioactivity of PSB. It also helped in eliminating the light attenuation capacity of the photobioreactor. The innovative biofilm was composed of SiO2 solution, chitosan solution, a culture medium that was concentrated 200 times with 12.5 g/L glucose, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris CQK 01 attached on a microslide (Lin et al., 2018). The experimental results have shown a high increase in the hydrogen production rate by, ∼1.8 times as compared to using a regular PSB biofilm reactor (Lin et al., 2018). The authors also added GeO2 to the previous biofilm and coated it with hollow optical fiber (HOF), for the intensification of side glow purposes. It was evident that the hydrogen production rate was 0.6 times higher as compared to the use of the traditional solid optical fiber (Lin et al., 2018). Generally, immobilization of photoheterotrophic bacteria on a solid matrix is reported to be able to enhance the biohydrogen yield compared to suspended culture (Argun and Kargi, 2011). A scale-up of Rb. Spheroids culture on activated glass can potentially yield a 3.6–4.0 L-H2/L culture per hour, which corresponds to 0.145–0.161 mmol-H2/L per hour (Levin et al., 2004)."
19,Future perspectives,"Due to the ever-increasing demand for palm oil products in the foreseeable future, there will be an opportunity for sustainable biohydrogen production from the industry's by-products. This has the potential to alleviate the burden on fossil fuel reserves, while also contributes to a solution/strategy to climate change. When compared to conventional methods of hydrogen production, biological treatment can significantly reduce both the cost and the energy requirement. The pre-treatment of oil palm wastes also has an impact on the performance of subsequent processes involved in the production of biohydrogen, which are discussed further below. Till date, the majority of research has concentrated on chemical and physical treatment methods such as lime treatment, acid hydrolysis, dilution, ozonation, and ultrasonic treatment. Due to the high cost of pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, there has been some speculation that hydrogen recovery from lignocellulosic biomass via biological pathways may not be economically feasible (Zhang and Zhang, 2018). The development of an appropriate pre-treatment step/strategy, on the other hand, can significantly reduce the cost of operation while also improving the quality of hydrogen production. For example, the advantage of biological pre-treatment includes the absence of the production of a toxic compound and the absence of a fermentation inhibitor (Sindhu et al., 2016). Consequently, it is recommended that biological pre-treatment could be used as part of the hydrogen recovery process from palm oil industrial waste in future studies. Apart from that, even though a great deal of research has been done to date on various types of enhancement strategies, there is still a good chance that improved biohydrogen production performance using POME and oil palm biomass as a feedstock from technologies such as MEC will be achieved. MEC has demonstrated that, it is capable of increasing the yield of biohydrogen production from a variety of biomass-based sources (Lu and Ren, 2016). For example, the combination of dark fermentation and the MEC process has the potential to increase the hydrogen yields to ∼8–9 mol/mol-glucose when compared to hydrogen production from dark fermentation alone, which is only capable of producing 2-3 mol-H2/mol-glucose on a practical basis (Liu et al., 2005). Only a few studies have been conducted to determine the applicability of MEC for the recovery of hydrogen from palm oil industrial waste. Further investigation into different biohydrogen production methods is needed in order to determine the feasibility of each system for recovering biohydrogen from palm oil industrial waste, particularly photo-fermentation and MEC, before they can be implemented on a commercial scale. Another important aspect that should be investigated further in the case of using POME as a biohydrogen feedstock is the use of nanomaterials as additives during the synthesis process. This field of study is already attracting the attention of researchers; for example, nano-metal oxides, such as nano-nickel oxide and nano-cobalt oxide, have been used to improve the quality and yield of biohydrogen production from polymerized organic matter (POME) (Mishra et al., 2018b). The yields obtained with nano-nickel oxide and nano-cobalt oxide were 0.563 L H2/g CODremoved and 0.487 L H2/g CODremoved, respectively. This strategy has the potential to improve the manufacturing process, both technically and economically (Kumar et al., 2019). From a technical standpoint, the addition of these materials can accelerate the production of hydrogen, resulting in a shorter residence time or reaction time and a smaller reactor volume. Because of the lower capital and operating costs, the process's feasibility should be improved in the future by considering the techno-economics of the process. Besides, there is a scarcity of techno-economic assessments of biological hydrogen production from palm oil milling effluent (POME) and/or palm oil biomass in the literature. On the basis of these efforts, as well as new ones involving the use of nano-sized enhancers, detailed techno-economic analysis studies should be carried out in the future in order to develop a comprehensive picture of the process scale-up and a wider application in the real world (Sen et al., 2013). It should be noted that various studies have been conducted in the past to evaluate the technical and economic aspects of biohydrogen production from a variety of different feedstocks using both dark and photo fermentation methods, respectively (Lee, 2020; Li et al., 2012; Urbaniec and Grabarczyk, 2014). For example, the techno-economic feasibility of using a continuous mixed immobilized sludge reactor for the production of biohydrogen from molasses via dark fermentation has been investigated (Han et al., 2016). Very few studies have investigated the effect of changing the volume of the reactor on the process profitability as a first step towards scaling up the process in this study. The entire fermentation process was found to be infeasible when small volume reactors, such as 10 m3, were used, with a return on investment of −37.2% being achieved. Larger volumes, on the other hand, demonstrated a more profitable profile, with the return on investment (ROI) increasing to 47.3% when using a 50 m3 fermenter. Furthermore, the payback period was shortened from 9.7 to 6.9 years as a result of the use of a 50 m3 fermenter rather than a smaller one with a volume of 40 m3. Finally, based on the findings of that study, it was concluded that scaling up can have a positive impact on the process economics. Based on the results of the existing reports on techno-economic analysis, different routes of biohydrogen synthesis should be compared with other production routes, such as gasification and the reforming of bio-oil (Zhang et al., 2013), in order to determine which is the most cost-effective method of production to pursue. Furthermore, another method of comparison should be used to include the other possible products that can be obtained from POME processing, such as biogas (Nasution et al., 2019), in order to develop a rigorous decision on the best strategy to valorize these wastes."
20,Conclusions,"Palm oil industrial wastes are promising raw materials for biohydrogen production. Numerous studies have been conducted on dark fermentation and photo-fermentation using palm oil industrial wastes for sustainable and high yield hydrogen gas production. Each process has its own limitations and advantages; the proposed development and implementation of a coupled system or a two-stage system can be an answer to this problem. Besides, the different enhancement strategies such as nutrient supplements and co-digestion of different wastes are feasible to promote hydrogen yield. It is also important to note that pre-treatment of POME and oil palm biomass prior to biohydrogen production is a crucial part of the system. Different researches are mainly focusing on methods such as ozonation, acid hydrolysis, dilution, and lime treatment. Finding alternative and effective methods such as biological treatment can potentially reduce the cost of production and yield higher biohydrogen production. Furthermore, MEC, as a novel technology for the production of biohydrogen, should be evaluated for their ability to apply palm oil industrial wastes as a feedstock; thus, a more optimum treatment system can be developed and applied at the industrial scale after undergoing pilot and semi-industrial scale performance evaluations."
