0,Introduction,"Climate change imposes the requirement to change the way we supply our energy. A potential solution to this problem is the “hydrogen economy”. Hydrogen is attractive as a mass energy carrier because it can be oxidised without production of CO2 and theoretically its re-supply from water is facile. Its major limitation as a sustainable fuel is the lack of commercially viable production routes from renewable sources. Microbial production, or bio-hydrogen, is an attractive solution, offering sustainable hydrogen generation from biomass or solar energy (Manish and Banerjee, 2008). A variety of bio-hydrogen technologies are under development, which include direct fermentation of biomass, photo-fermentation, bio-photolysis (Manish and Banerjee, 2008) and electrohydrogenesis (Cheng and Logan, 2007). All these approaches employ microbes expressing hydrogenase enzymes to catalyse hydrogen production from different electron sources, and all have limitations imposed by the native capabilities of these organisms. Metabolic engineering offers a framework to overcome these limits (Alper and Stephanopoulos, 2009), and has increased yields in Escherichia coli and other organisms (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). However, the available hydrogenase apparatus imposes boundaries on the magnitude of these improvements, through thermodynamic (Veit et al., 2008) and kinetic restrictions (Agapakis et al., 2010), and substrate availability (Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). To engineer microbes beyond these limitations, non-native enzymes are required that can accept alternative electron donors, and are amenable to protein engineering to channel electron flow (Agapakis et al., 2010), and to improve properties such as oxygen tolerance. Broad range heterologous hydrogenase expression systems are therefore important tools to enhance bio-hydrogen yields using metabolic engineering. The vast majority of known hydrogenases have bimetallic active sites and fall into two classes, [NiFe] and [FeFe], of which the [NiFe] are better studied, more common, have a broader range of substrate specificities (Vignais and Colbeau, 2004) and have lower (and reversible) oxygen sensitivity (English et al., 2009). [FeFe] hydrogenases can be heterologously expressed in E. coli (King et al., 2006), and are capable of introducing a hydrogen producing phenotype when coupled to host electron transfer systems (Akhtar and Jones, 2009; Agapakis et al., 2010). Expression of heterologous [NiFe] hydrogenases outside of a closely related host is challenging (English et al., 2009), and efforts to express genes from several organisms in E. coli have resulted in inactive enzyme (Voordouw et al., 1987; Mura et al., 1996; Grzeszik et al., 1997; Maeda et al., 2007). This difficulty arises from the complexity and specificity of the assembly process for the remarkable [NiFe] active site, an intricate structure containing cyanide (CN-) and carbon monoxide (CO) ligands which requires at least seven maturation factors for assembly (Blokesch et al., 2002). Some systems have now been developed for production of [NiFe] hydrogenases in distantly related hosts, but activity is only reported in vitro, and in vivo hydrogen production is not shown: an Alteromonas hydrogenase sequence isolated from meta-genomic DNA has been expressed in Thiocapsa roseopersicina (Maroti et al., 2009) and a hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha has been expressed in Pseudomonas stutzeri (Lenz et al., 2005). The [NiFe] hydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus has also recently been expressed in E. coli using a system of four vectors encoding 13 heterologous genes (Sun et al., 2010), again with recombinant hydrogenase activity only reported in vitro. Introduction of a hydrogen producing phenotype to any organism via a non-native [NiFe] hydrogenase has not been demonstrated, preventing characterisation of the physiological properties of these systems in non-native hosts, and limiting opportunities for forward engineering in vivo. E. coli is an exemplar of the challenges facing metabolic engineering for fermentative hydrogen production, where maximum yields through engineering of the native pathway are limited to 2mol H2 per mol glucose (Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). Equivalent limits exist for other substrates, for example the yield from glycerol is limited to 1mol H2 per mol (Shams Yazdani and Gonzalez, 2008). The native pathway uses formate (Sawers, 2005), and the limitation arises from stoichiometric limits on formate production. To overcome this limitation, additional hydrogen production functionality is required. We therefore chose to introduce such functionality by introducing a non-native [NiFe] hydrogenase into E. coli (see Fig. 1A), and thereby to demonstrate the practicality of using [NiFe] hydrogenases to provide non-native hydrogen production routes. The applicability of such a system as a metabolic engineering component should be versatile given E. coli's high genetic tractability and broad use in biotechnology (Alper and Stephanopoulos, 2009). The [NiFe] hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is a well-studied representative of the bi-directional hydrogenases. These cytoplasmic enzymes function reversibly in their physiological setting, coupling hydrogen uptake or emission, to oxidation and reduction of cellular coenzymes, such as NADH (Vignais and Colbeau, 2004). The expression of this particular enzyme in E. coli is a desirable goal for two reasons. Firstly, it produces hydrogen from NADH and NADPH (Schmitz et al., 2002), and so has the potential to introduce this alternative hydrogen production pathway into E. coli, in addition to the pre-existing pathway (see Fig. 1A). Secondly, the enzyme is well suited to biotechnological applications because its inactivation by oxygen is rapidly reversible (Germer et al., 2009). There is a significant body of published work investigating this enzyme in vivo in its native host, and in vitro. Purification has revealed it to be a complex containing five different subunits, HoxEFUYH, though the stoichiometry is uncertain (Schmitz et al., 2002; Germer et al., 2009). Mutational analysis of the native maturation pathway has identified seven essential maturation factors, designated HypA1, HypB1, HypC, HypD, HypE, HypF and HoxW (Hoffmann et al., 2006). Detailed analysis of the native [NiFe] hydrogenase maturation pathway in E. coli (Casalot and Rousset, 2001; Blokesch et al., 2002) has led to the generation of a model of active site assembly (see Fig. 1B). Building on this knowledge, we have reconstituted the maturation pathway to allow for functional expression of this hydrogenase in the biotechnology platform organism E. coli, and characterised its properties in vivo and in vitro. Further, we assess the species specificity of the maturation machinery, and investigate coupling of the hydrogenase to host electron donors. Finally, the prospects and limitations for future additional metabolic engineering of this system are discussed."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Design and construction of pSynHox and derivatives,"2.1 Design and construction of pSynHox and derivatives The synthetic sequence was designed using the software Gene-designer (Villalobos et al., 2006) and codon usage in all of the twelve ORFs was optimised for expression in E. coli using this software. The codon optimised sequence generated was then screened for translational termination sequences using the software Transterm (Kingsford et al., 2007), and 9 potential terminator sequences with scores over 60 were removed by silent modifications to the sequence. Each of the twelve ORFs was preceded by an optimal ribosome binding site (RBS), AAGGAG, followed by an (A)8 spacer sequence before the start codon. A second stop codon with the sequence TAA was included at the end of each ORF, incorporated where possible into the RBS for the following gene, to give the sequence TAAGGAG (A)8 ATG (Fig. 1). Certain features were also included in the sequence to facilitate future work, as described in Supplementary Table 1. Gene synthesis and sub-cloning of the synthetic sequence at the NcoI and AvrII sites of pACYC Duet, was carried out by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA). The pACYC vector was chosen because of its low copy number, which will aid the stability of the very large insert (Wild et al., 2002). To construct the ΔhoxW, ΔhypA1, ΔhypB1 and ΔhypE variants, large (14–15kb) PCR fragments, with the relevant gene deleted, were prepared from the pSynHox template. The fragments were then ligated to form circular constructs via the EcoRI sites that were included in the PCR primers. To construct the ΔhypC, ΔhypD, ΔhypF variants, synthetic sequences were prepared by DNA2.0 and sub-cloned into the pSynHox sequence. The coding regions of all constructs were sequenced."
3,Construction of pETHox,"2.2 Construction of pETHox A PCR fragment containing the hoxEFUYH operon was prepared from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA using the following primers: CAATCATGGATCCTGCTGTATTGCTCCTTTTTGAGG (forward) and GGATTACTGAATTCCCGTCTGAATGTTTTTTG (reverse). The fragment was then cloned in the vector pET17b (Novagen) at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The ribosome binding sites for hoxF, hoxY and hoxH were then modified via site directed mutagenesis to read AAGGAG, CTGGAC and CAGGAA, respectively, giving the construct pETHoxEFUYH. A PCR fragment containing the hoxW gene was then generated using the following primers: GCGAATTCGTAGGTTTCCCCTAAATTACCCCAG (forward) and GCCTCGAGGTTTCCCTTGGCTTTATCTCTCCC (reverse). This fragment was then cloned into pETHoxEFUYH at the EcoRI and Xho I sites to produce the final pETHox construct, containing the six genes hoxEFUYHW in that order under the control of a T7lac promoter."
4,Preparation of strains,"2.3 Preparation of strains The genes encoding the large subunits of each of the four hydrogenases were deleted from the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) star (Invitrogen). Firstly, a ΔhycE strain was produced by Avantgen (San Diego, CA). The genes hyaB, hybC and hyfG were then deleted sequentially in house. Scar-less gene deletions were achieved via P1 phage transduction from the Keio collection strains (JW2962—ΔhybC767::kan, JW0955—ΔhyaB787::kan and JW2472—ΔhyfG735::kan), followed by removal of the selection marker by expression of Flp site specific recombinase from the plasmid 706-FLP (Gene bridges GmbH, Dresden, Germany) according to the supplier's instructions. The success of each step was confirmed by colony PCR. The ΔpflB::kan strain was also generated by phage transduction from a strain supplied by Professor Jeff Green (University of Sheffield, UK), and confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing."
5,Hydrogenase expression in E. coli,"2.4 Hydrogenase expression in E. coli Starter cultures were inoculated from fresh transformants and grown overnight aerobically at 37°C in 5mL LB medium. A semi defined medium was prepared containing 10gL−1 tryptone and 5gL−1 yeast extract supplemented with 10gL−1 glucose, 2mM MgSO4, 50mLL−1 of 20×P (1M Na2HPO4, 1M KH2PO4 and 0.25M (NH4)2SO4) and 5mL of a trace metals solution (60mM FeCl3, 10mM CaCl2, 5mM MnSO4, 5mM ZnSO4, 2mM NiSO4 and 1mM each of CoCl2, CuSO4, (NH4)6 Mo7O24, Na2SeO3, H3BO3 and Al2(SO4)3 in 60mM HCl). Selection was maintained with 20μgmL−1 chloramphenicol. The starter cultures were used to inoculate 100mL of the semi defined medium in 250mL Duran type bottles. These cultures were grown aerobically at 37°C until the OD at 600nm exceeded 0.5, when IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1mM. The bottles were sealed with caps modified to include a gas sampling port and containing an inlet and outlet for sparging (Supplementary Fig. 1). The cultures were then sparged with argon and growth was continued under anaerobic conditions."
6,Synechosystis sp. PCC6803 cultures,"2.5 Synechosystis sp. PCC6803 cultures Cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were grown at 25°C in 100mL of BG-11 media in a shaker incubator, under an illumination cycle of 12h on and 12h off. When the OD at 730nm exceeded 1.4 the cultures were transferred to anaerobic conditions under argon, using the same system as described above and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 22h before harvesting."
7,Hydrogenase activity assays,"2.6 Hydrogenase activity assays Cell pellets from 3mL of fermentation culture were harvested by centrifugation in 15mL tubes and stored at −80°C. Pellets were re-suspended in 2mL of lysis buffer containing 0.8%w/v CHAPS, 20mM HEPES pH 6.8, 10mM MgCl2, 10mM Na2S2O4, 1mgmL−1 lysosyme, 50μgmL−1 DNAse and 50μgmL−1 RNase. A stirrer bead and 0.4g 100μm glass beads were added, and the tube was sealed with a rubber septum and filled with argon. The lysis was carried out over one hour at room temperature with continuous stirring and periodic vortexing. The protein concentration in the lysed samples, and the lysis buffer was determined by a Bradford assay. 1mL of 15mM methyl viologen in 20mM HEPES pH 6.8, 10mM MgCl2 and 60μL 1M Na2S2O4 were then added to the sample. The headspace was again filled with argon and the sample was immediately transferred to a temperature controlled water bath at 55°C, on a magnetic stirrer. The headspace was sampled with a gas syringe at 10min intervals, and analysed for hydrogen content. The recombinant enzyme was stable up to 55°C, where maximal rates were observed, and assays were therefore carried out at this temperature. Separation of lysates into soluble and insoluble fractions was carried out by centrifugation of the lysis reaction under argon at 4500g for 10min. The insoluble fraction was washed in lysis buffer, centrifuged again and then re-suspended in lysis buffer for the assay."
8,Hydrogen measurements,"2.7 Hydrogen measurements Gas samples were analysed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a packed inlet, a molecular sieve 5A packed column (40/60 mesh) and fitted with an additional 250μL gas sampling loop. The oven temperature was 70°C, the injector temperature was 100°C and the detector temperature (TCD) was 200°C. The carrier gas was argon (BOC) at a flowrate of 20mLmin−1. The detector reference was 30ml/min and the retention time of hydrogen was approximately 0.41min. The instrument was calibrated using hydrogen standard gases of various concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 30% hydrogen (BOC)."
9,Protein purification and in-gel digestion,"2.8 Protein purification and in-gel digestion Cultures of E. coli BL21 Star carrying the plasmids pSynHox (CmR) and/or pETHox (AmpR) were grown as described above, in LB supplemented with trace metals (as above) and the appropriate antibiotics (20μgmL−1 chloramphenicol and/or of 100μgmL−1 carbenicillin). Cell pellets from approximately 100mL of the culture were frozen at −20°C and then re-suspended in 10mL of lysis buffer (20mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 130mM NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 1mgmL−1 lysosyme, 50μgmL−1 DNAse and 50μgmL−1 RNase, 0.5mM AEBSF). The cell suspension was incubated at room temperature for one hour and then sonicated for 2min on ice. The soluble fraction was then loaded onto a 1mL gravity fed T7 affinity column (Novagen) pre-equilibrated in 20mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 130mM NaCl, 1% Tween 20 and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluent fractions were precipitated by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 15%w/v. SDS-PAGE of the fractions was carried out and gel bands covering the appropriate size ranges were excised. Gel pieces were digested with modified trypsin after reduction (10mM DTT for 30min at 56°C) and alkylation (55mM iodoacetamide and 50mM ammonium bicarbonate for 20min in the dark at room temperature) of the proteins. Gel pieces were dried before adding trypsin, at a 1:50 mass ratio. After overnight digestion at 37°C, the digested peptides were extracted. Dry digests were stored at −20°C and samples were diluted with 0.1% formic acid and 3% ACN prior to LC-MS/MS analysis."
10,LC-MS/MS and database searches,"2.9 LC-MS/MS and database searches An LC Packings Ultimate 3000 system (Netherlands) coupled with a QStar XL Hybrid ESI Quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used for protein identification. Each sample was injected at a 300nLmin−1 flowrate. Separation was performed using a 0.075×150mm2 reverse-phase capillary column (C18 PepMap100, LC Packings) at a 300nLmin−1 flowrate. HPLC–ESI solvents contained 0.1% formic acid and either 3% ACN (solvent A) or 97% ACN (solvent B). Separation of the peptides was performed by a linear gradient from 5% to 55% solvent B over 30min. The electrospray fused silica PicoTip™ needle (New Objective, Inc., USA) was operated with a voltage differential of 5.5kV. Doubly and triply charged ions were selected in the full scan for MS/MS. The ion source gas was set to 50psi, survey scans were acquired from 350 to 1800 m/z, MS/MS scans from 65 to 1800 m/z, and the collision energy and collision gas were set to zero volts and 4.0psi, respectively. MS profile data was acquired using Analyst QS 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). MS/MS data was submitted to an online database using the Mascot (version 2.2 Matrix Science Inc.) search engine, which gives the number of unique peptides identified, peptide coverage percentage and Mowse score (Pappin et al., 1993). E. coli K12 sequences were obtained from the NCBI database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/) (downloaded 26th August 2008) and a FASTA file was created and merged with a database containing relevant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 sequences. The peptide tolerance was set to 100ppm, the MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.6Da, +2 and +3 charged ions were considered and carbamidomethyl (C) and oxidation (M) were also set as fixed and variable modifications, respectively. The enzyme was set to trypsin and 2 missed cleavages were allowed. ESI-QUAD-TOF was the set instrument. Only confidently identified proteins are reported, that is proteins with a Mowse score (P>0.95) above the threshold (Perkins et al., 1999), and with two or more peptides identified."
11,Results,
12,Overview and validation of expression system,"3.1 Overview and validation of expression system Current knowledge suggests that co-expression of at least twelve genes would be necessary to express the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 bi-directional hydrogenase in E. coli, five structural subunits and seven maturation factors (Fig. 1B). A single synthetic operon was conceived as the simplest approach for co-expression of these genes. Although such an operon would be very large, at around 12kb, there are examples of larger operons in the E. coli genome (Archer and Elliott, 1995) and this was thus considered a viable approach. Gene synthesis provides a relatively simple method for the production of such a construct, which would be difficult using conventional molecular biology methods. An 11.7kb codon optimised sequence was designed containing the twelve Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 open reading frames (ORFs) in order: hoxE, hoxF, hoxU, hoxY, hoxH, HypA1, hypB1, hypC, hypD, hypE, hypF and hoxW. The synthetic sequence was expressed under the control of a T7 promoter from a construct known as pSynHox (Fig. 1B), the principal features of which are summarised in Supplementary Table 1. Further characterisation of the expression system is described in Supplementary Results 1."
13,Activity of recombinant hydrogenase,"3.2 Activity of recombinant hydrogenase To unambiguously determine if the pSynHox construct produced active bi-directional hydrogenase, an E. coli expression host was constructed that produced no background hydrogenase activity. The host strain was based on the strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen), a T7 expression host that carries a mutation in RnaseE that aids transcript stability. The genes encoding the large subunits of each of the four native E. coli hydrogenases (hyaB, hybC, hycE and hyfG) were deleted in this strain. The resulting hydrogenase null strain, BL21 Star DE3 ΔhyaB ΔhybC ΔhycE ΔhyfG, showed no detectable hydrogen production from anaerobic cultures of live cells ( Fig. 2A), nor any detectable hydrogenase activity in whole cell lysates in vitro (Fig. 2B). The same strain carrying the pSynHox construct consistently produced hydrogen, giving a mean yield of 8.4μmol H2 per litre of culture over 12 biological replicates (standard deviation=1.6). Lysates of these cells also consistently showed hydrogenase activity in vitro, with a mean specific activity of 37nmol H2 per minute per mg of total protein at 55°C, over 8 biological replicates (standard deviation=11). Cells carrying an unmodified pACYC–Duet vector showed no detectable hydrogenase activity in vitro or in vivo. Hydrogen production from live cells carrying pSynHox was also observed to be dependent upon induction with IPTG (data not shown). Lysates of the native host Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 produced a mean specific activity of 210nmolH2 min−1 mg−1, about six fold higher than that produced by the pSynHox construct in E. coli. To confirm that the observed hydrogenase activity was caused by expression of the Synechocystis bi-directional hydrogenase, we took advantage of the known high specificity of hydrogenase maturation endopeptidases (Fritsche et al., 1999; Casalot and Rousset, 2001). The endopeptidase gene hoxW is known to be essential for production of functional hydrogenase in the native Synechocystis host (Hoffmann et al., 2006). Maturation endopeptidases generally also have high specificity to particular hydrogenase iso-enzymes (Fritsche et al., 1999; Casalot and Rousset, 2001), so the chances of an E. coli ortholog complementing the deletion are very low. We therefore deleted hoxW from the pSynHox construct and tested its activity. As expected, the pSynHox ΔhoxW construct produced no hydrogenase activity in vivo or in vitro (Fig. 2A and B). Taken together, these data show that the construct pSynHox produces a functional heterologous [NiFe] hydrogenase in E. coli. Furthermore, the recombinant enzyme is expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli (as described in Section 2.6), consistent with the reported isolation of the enzyme from the soluble fraction of Synechocystis lysates (Germer et al., 2009). In contrast, native E. coli hydrogenases are membrane associated, and appear largely in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). Hydrogen production from live cells carrying pSynHox continued for approximately 12h following induction and the switch to anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2C). After this point, some re-uptake was observed, followed by stabilisation of the hydrogen partial pressure at about 10Pa. The negative control culture containing the construct pSynHox ΔhoxW, produced no detectable hydrogen over 24h."
14,Analysis of subunit composition,"3.3 Analysis of subunit composition We used assembly of the hydrogenase complex to provide additional confidence that the active site was fully constructed. The purified bi-directional hydrogenase complex from Synechocystis contains five subunits, HoxEFUYH (Schmitz et al., 2002; Germer et al., 2009), which include the small and large hydrogenase subunits, HoxY and HoxH, respectively, as well as an NADH binding subunit, HoxF and two Fe–S cluster rich subunits, HoxE and HoxU. The final step in the assembly of [NiFe] hydrogenases is the binding of the small hydrogenase subunit to the large subunit unit, to produce the mature active enzyme (Fig. 1B). This can only occur once all the other steps in assembly of the [NiFe] active site are complete (Casalot and Rousset, 2001; Theodoratou et al., 2005). Thus, binding of the small hydrogenase subunit can provide an indication of assembly of the active site. To determine if the pSynHox expression system produces the complete HoxEFUYH complex in E. coli, and to provide confirmation of [NiFe] active site assembly by an alternative methodology, we investigated the subunit composition of the bi-directional hydrogenase complex by partial purification and LC-MS/MS analysis. The pSynHox construct included an N-terminal S-II tag on the HoxE subunit, but pull down of the hydrogenase complex using this system was unsuccessful, possibly because of the tag being buried due to a short linker sequence (Supplementary Table 2). A successful tagged purification system had however been developed on an earlier construct, known as pETHox (see Section 2), which was used to circumvent this problem. The pETHox construct expressed the 6 genes hoxEFUYHW, with an N-terminal T7 tag on HoxE (Supplementary Table 2). Pull down of the hydrogenase complex from cells expressing pETHox revealed a complex containing the four subunits HoxEFUH ( Table 1), but lacking the small hydrogenase subunit, HoxY. Expression of HoxY was however detected in crude lysates, so its failure to bind to the complex indicates incomplete assembly of the active site. To analyse the complex produced by expression of all 12 Synechocystis genes via pull down using T7 tagged HoxE, the pSynHox and pETHox plasmids were co-expressed. In this case the complex was found to contain HoxY as well as the other four subunits (Table 1), indicating that the [NiFe] active site is fully assembled."
15,Requirements for maturation of bi-directional hydrogenase in E. coli.,"3.4 Requirements for maturation of bi-directional hydrogenase in E. coli. Deletion of any of the seven hydrogenase maturation factors present in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 results in the complete loss of hydrogenase activity (Hoffmann et al., 2006). However, since E. coli expresses orthologs of these proteins, it is possible that, in this host expression of the cyanobacterial maturation factors may not be essential for production of the mature bi-directional hydrogenase. To investigate the requirements for expression of the cyanobacterial maturation factors in the E. coli host, we analysed the effects of deletion of each of these genes from our expression system. Thus six constructs were generated from pSynHox: ΔhypA1, ΔhypB1, ΔhypC, ΔhypD, ΔhypE and ΔhypF, in addition to the ΔhoxW construct already described. For each of these constructs the hydrogen production from live cells ( Fig. 3A) and the in vitro hydrogenase activity was measured (Fig. 3B), again using the hydrogenase null E. coli strain as a host. Deletion of any of the maturation factors affected both hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity, with a strong correlation between effects on the two properties. The magnitude of these effects varies greatly for different deletions. HypA1 and HoxW are apparently essential for maturation of the cyanobacterial hydrogenase in E. coli: no hydrogen production, or hydrogenase activity, is detected when either gene is deleted. In contrast, deletion of any of the other maturation factors HypB1, HypC, HypD, HypE or HypF, results only in a reduction in hydrogen production and hydrogenase activity relative to the unmodified construct. Since these proteins are known to be essential for maturation in Synechocystis, it can be concluded that their E. coli orthologs must, to different degrees, functionally complement their deletion. There are two other important conclusions that can be drawn from these data. Firstly, because deletion of any of the maturation factors produces a phenotype, all seven of these proteins must be expressed. This further validates the design of the synthetic operon. Secondly, the deletions (see Fig. 3) allow the impact of changing hydrogenase activity levels on hydrogen output to be observed. The strong correlation between the hydrogenase activity and the hydrogen output implies that levels of recombinant enzyme limit the hydrogen yield by limiting the production rate. If the reaction is indeed kinetically limited, it will not be reaching thermodynamic equilibrium, and higher hydrogen partial pressures will ultimately be possible with increased enzyme activity."
16,Formate independent hydrogen production via the bi-directional hydrogenase,"3.5 Formate independent hydrogen production via the bi-directional hydrogenase Having identified one possible avenue for improving production of hydrogen, we sought to assess increasing substrate availability as a second strategy. To do this, we took advantage of the established fact that deletion of pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) in E. coli increases intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratios (Zhu and Shimizu, 2004, 2005). This particular deletion also has the advantage of simultaneously allowing one to determine if the foreign hydrogen pathway is indeed distinct from the native pathway: deletion of pflB abolishes the production of formate (Zhang et al., 2009), the substrate for native hydrogen production in E. coli. Hydrogen production from pSynHox was therefore measured in a strain in which both PFL and the native hydrogenases are inactivated, BL21 Star DE3 ΔpflB::kan ΔhyaB ΔhybC ΔhycE ΔhyfG. Not only was hydrogen production observed, but yields were approximately twice those observed without deletion of pflB ( Fig. 4A). The same deletion strain carrying the inactive pSynHox ΔhoxW construct produced no detectable hydrogen. These results show that the hydrogen production from the heterologous hydrogenase is independent of formate. Theoretically, the increase in hydrogen production in the ΔpflB strain could originate either from increased hydrogenase activity or from a change in substrate availability. The in vitro hydrogenase activity in the two strains was therefore measured and was found to be similar (Fig. 4B), showing that the effect must arise from substrate availability. Given the known impact of pflB deletion on NADH/NAD+ ratios (Zhu and Shimizu, 2004, 2005), the increase in hydrogen yield observed supports the hypothesis that the hydrogen production via the bi-directional hydrogenase is NADH dependent and that yields can be improved by increasing NADH/NAD+ ratios."
17,Discussion,"We have demonstrated the introduction of a hydrogen producing phenotype into a host with no native hydrogenases, via a non-native [NiFe] hydrogenase. Although there are examples of heterologous expression of functional [NiFe] hydrogenases, the wide applicability of these systems for bio-hydrogen production and recombinant protein production is limited for a number of reasons. In general, there is a requirement for a closely related host (Friedrich et al., 1984; Umeda et al., 1986; Rousset et al., 1998; Báscones et al., 2000) or a host with a highly similar hydrogenase (Maroti et al., 2009; Porthun et al., 2002). In several of these instances hydrogen uptake activity has been demonstrated in vivo, generally by the restoration of the capability for litho-autotrophic growth (Friedrich et al., 1984; Umeda et al., 1986; Báscones et al., 2000; Porthun et al., 2002; Lenz et al., 2005). In the cases where the hydrogenase has been expressed in a distantly related host (Lenz et al., 2005; Maroti et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010), activity is only reported in vitro and questions have been raised over physiological coupling to host electron transfer systems (Maroti et al., 2009). Thus, until now, non-native [NiFe] hydrogenases expression systems have only been shown to be physiologically active in closely related hosts, or in hosts possessing highly similar hydrogenases, indicative of horizontal gene transfer events. In vivo activity from these systems is also only observed via hydrogen uptake, and production of hydrogen via a non-native [NiFe] hydrogenase has not previously been reported in any host. The present study gives insight into the requirements for heterologous [NiFe] hydrogenase expression and the specificity of the maturation machinery. Individual deletion of the maturation factor genes from pSynHox shows that all seven maturation factors are required for optimal hydrogenase activity, but that only two of these, hypA1 and hoxW, are essential. Consistent with these results, the Synechocystis proteins HoxW and HypA1 have lower sequence similarity to their counterparts in E. coli than the other maturation factors ( Table 2). The failure of E. coli orthologs to complement deletions of these genes, alongside the reduced level of protein sequence conservation, allows the conclusion that both these factors must show a high degree of specificity towards their particular hydrogenase target. This interpretation is supported by knowledge of the maturation process in E. coli, which has paralogs of both hypA (i.e. hybF) and the hydrogenase endopeptidase (hyaD, hybD, hycI), whilst, with the exception of hypC, the other maturation factors are present only as a single gene (Casalot and Rousset, 2001). In E. coli, each hydrogenase iso-enzyme is processed by a specific endopeptidase (Theodoratou et al., 2000), and it has also been shown that the two hypA paralogs have a high degree of iso-enzyme specificity (Hube et al., 2002). Interpreted in the light of the current maturation model, the evidence presented here supports the hypothesis that, as with the endopeptidase, HypA makes specific protein–protein contacts with the large hydrogenase subunit. Furthermore, since every deletion reduces activity, the expression levels of any of the seven non-native maturation factors are shown to be capable of limiting hydrogenase production. This result points to a possible strategy for increasing yields of active hydrogenase by tuning the expression of individual maturation factors. Reconstitution of the Synechocystis maturation machinery in E. coli also allows testing of the ability of other candidate maturation factors to increase levels of active hydrogenase. Although the focus of this work is biological hydrogen production, the expression of [NiFe] hydrogenases has a number of potential applications. Hydrogen production/uptake pathways are potential building blocks for metabolic engineering strategies in other fields. The bi-directional hydrogenase demonstrated here is known to use NADH and NADPH as substrates in vitro (Schmitz et al., 2002), and the data presented here support the conclusion that this is also the case in vivo. If this is indeed the case, the non-native pathway couples molecular hydrogen to the cellular NADH and NADPH pools. A potential application of the pathway would be to regenerate NADH using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent, facilitating the bio-synthesis of compounds requiring a large number of reducing equivalents, for example long-chain alcohols (Koffas, 2009). Hydrogenases also play other roles in biotechnological routes for hydrogen production and usage: biocatalysis can generate hydrogen ex vivo by conversion of biomass (Woodward et al., 2000) or solar energy (Ihara et al., 2006; Reisner et al., 2009) and, enzymes can act as low cost catalysts for fuel cells and electrolysers (Cracknell et al., 2008). Ex vivo application of hydrogenases requires high yield over-expression in biotechnology platform organisms such as E. coli, which could be achieved by further development of the system described here. Portable hydrogen production pathways broaden the scope for the application of cellular engineering to improve microbial hydrogen production across all bio-hydrogen technologies. A major limitation in fermentation-based systems is achieving stoichiometric yields from carbohydrate feedstocks, which fall well short of the theoretical maximum of 12mol H2 per mol of glucose. For example, the maximum yield that can be achieved through optimisation of the formate dependent pathway in E. coli is 2mol H2 per mol of glucose (Bisaillon et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2006), due to stoichiometric limitations on formate production. Yields in certain obligate anaerobes are higher, but no organism has been identified that can produce more than 4mol H2 per mol of glucose (Chou et al., 2008; Vardar-Schara et al., 2008). To reach beyond this threshold the construction of rationally designed metabolic circuits is required, capable of channelling a greater proportion of high potential electrons from the feedstock into hydrogen production (see elsewhere for further discussion on the limitations, for example: Hallenbeck and Ghosh, 2009). The strategy employed here demonstrates the feasibility of adding a [NiFe] hydrogenase-based pathway into an organism. In the particular case of E. coli this could potentially achieve hydrogen yields beyond 2mol per mol of glucose (see Fig. 1) by acting in addition with the native pathway. The highest hydrogen yield observed from the non-native pathway (Section 3.5) can be estimated at 0.0004mol per mol of glucose. If the new pathway is to be combined with the native pathway, challenges relating to thermodynamics and kinetics need to be solved, both to allow increases in the hydrogen yield from the new pathway, and to ensure it does not act in uptake mode when a second pathway is functioning. A key thermodynamic consideration is the selection of appropriate electron carriers with electrode potentials sufficient to generate hydrogen at usable partial pressures. Assessing the suitability of NADH in this capacity is an interesting case, since theoretical calculations are inconclusive due to divergent data on the standard electrode potential for NADH/NAD+ (Clark, 1960; Karyakin, 2003). Direct experimental assessment of the thermodynamics is desirable, but complete isolation of the pathway is challenging. One measurement indicates that the reaction may equilibrate at a very low partial pressure (Veit et al., 2008). Our system could also be used to address this question, provided the levels of active enzyme can be increased sufficiently to overcome the kinetic limitations we observe. An alternative strategy to the use of NADH or NADPH, is to use protein engineering methods to couple [NiFe] hydrogenases to other electron donors such as ferredoxins (Agapakis et al., 2010). [NiFe] hydrogenases are good candidates for such an approach due their improved oxygen tolerance relative to the [FeFe] class. The key kinetic limitation of the current system appears to arise from quantities of active enzyme. The relatively low levels of activity compared to the native Synechocystis host clearly indicate that there is room for optimisation of recombinant [NiFe] hydrogenase expression. The sensitivity of the recombinant hydrogenase activity to maturation factor levels which we observe points to a clear strategy for achieving this."
18,Conclusions,"Here, we demonstrate a biotechnology platform for exploitation of [NiFe] hydrogenases that opens up opportunities for engineered biological hydrogen production and ex vivo biocatalysis. Challenges remain, including increasing expression levels, improving oxygen tolerance and designing thermodynamically and kinetically optimised metabolic engineering strategies. However, with this expression system in hand, several avenues are open to address these challenges: systematic investigation of maturation requirements will bring improvements in yields of active enzyme, and protein engineering can be applied to improve oxygen tolerance, and to couple the enzyme to appropriate electron carriers. High level expression of engineered, physiologically active [NiFe] hydrogenases will bring within reach the possibility of improving microbial hydrogen production by forming a component of rationally designed electron transport systems."
