0,Introduction,"Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), also known as graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4, is a low-cost and stable metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst, which has received wide attention in solar–to-chemical energy conversion process, such as photocatalytic hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation and organic-selective synthesis [1,2]. However, the pristine PCN owns a melon-based structure (Fig. S1a in Supporting Information) and usually shows a limited photocatalytic performance due to its mediocre charge transfer efficiency, insufficient visible light absorption and high recombination rate of electrons-holes [3-5]. Fortunately, the photoelectric property of PCN is easy to be regulated. To address these issues, several regulating strategies have been developed to overcome these shortcomings, including element doping, morphology adjusting and coupling with other semiconductors [6-12]. These regulation methods improve the photocatalytic activity of PCN to a certain extent, but its intrinsic photocatalytic activity is still limited due to the low crystallinity, which is one of the key factors to determine the charge transfer efficiency [13-18]. Therefore, improving the crystallinity of PCN is crucial but challenging, and has achieved certain progress in the past decade [19-22]. Currently, the synthetic crystalline PCN can be mainly classified into two types: poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), as shown in Fig. S1b and S1c in Supporting Information [23,24]. A eutectic mixture of LiCl/KCl was used as the high-temperature solvent for the first time in 2008 by Tomas et al. to synthesize the triazine-based crystalline PCN with a poly(triazine imide) (PTI) structure, and its accurate 2D structure was elucidated in 2011 by Schnick et al. [25,26] . The heptazine-based crystalline PCN with a poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) structure was firstly reported in 2016 by Wang et al. and Lotsch et al. by treating melon in LiCl/KCl and KSCN molten salts, respectively [27,28] . As forecasted by theoretical calculation, the structure of heptazine subunits is more stable than triazine subunits at ambient conditions [29]. In addition, the heptazine-based crystalline PCN attracted more attentions due to its relatively fast charge transfer and low recombination rate of electrons-holes, benefitting from the highly conjugated PHI network. Henceforth, multiple researches have been carried out on the synthesis of heptazine-based crystalline PCN [30-32]. As one of the most effective strategies for improving the photocatalytic performance of PCN, the morphology regulation also draws wide attention in the further optimization of crystalline PCN. A battery of heptazine-based crystalline PCN with diverse morphologies have been reported. For instance, inspired by exfoliation of PTI/Li + Cl-, Wang and co-workers synthesized the heptazine-based crystalline PCN nanosheets via liquid phase exfoliation [33]. Zhou and co-workers obtained the heptazine-based crystalline PCN nanosheets by thermal exfoliation, i.e., annealing the pre-synthesized bulk crystalline PCN in air [34]. The three-dimensional branched crystalline PCN was also successfully synthesized by alike method [35]. Beyond that, Xiang and co-workers reported a post HCl treating method to synthesize the nanorods of heptazine-based crystalline PCN from its bulk counterpart. Li and co-workers synthesized highly crystalline carbon nitride hollow spheres by treating the cyanuric acid-melamine derived melon spheres in molten salt [22]. On the whole, the morphology regulation effectively improved the photocatalytic activity of heptazine-based crystalline PCN via further increase the active site quantity and electrons-holes separation efficiency. However, the present researches require multiple-step treatments to synthesize nanostructured crystalline PCN, i.e., preparing bulk crystalline PCN first and post-treating it into nanoscale, or preparing nanoscale melon-based PCN and then transforming it into nanoscale crystalline PCN. Moreover, their synthesis of crystalline PCN used water-sensitive salt (LiCl) and needed inert-atmosphere in calcination. We have tried to directly grow nanoscale heptazine-based crystalline PCN in atmosphere on LiCl-free salt crystals via vapor deposition but obtained box-shaped sample of about one micron in wall thickness, which is still far from nanoscale [36]. Therefore, the sustainable and facile one-step synthesis of nanostructured crystalline PCN is still of great urgency and interests. Herein, we proposed and demonstrated a facile one-step method to synthesize the nanoscale potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K-PHI) in the atmosphere, taking advantage of single KCl salt and a gas template (steam decomposed from Mg(OH)2), as shown in Scheme 1 . Briefly, potassium poly(heptazine imide) forms in the polymerization of melamine within KCl, while the steam decomposed from Mg(OH)2 impedes the aggregating growth of potassium poly(heptazine imide) and thus forming nanoparticles instead of large blocks. Moreover, Mg(OH)2 changes into MgO after the synthesis process, which can be hydrated into Mg(OH)2 for reuse. KCl can be also recycled via dissolving the mixture products in water with subsequent filtration and evaporation. The as-prepared nanoscale K-PHI samples using either original or regenerated KCl and Mg(OH)2 show excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities superior to bulk PCN, nanoscale PCN and bulk K-PHI, which benefits from both the increased crystallinity and nanostructured morphology."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials The grade of all chemicals used in this work is analytically pure. The KCl and alcohol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The melamine and Mg(OH)2 were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. The chloroplatinic acid and triethanolamine were purchased from Vetec (Sigma-Aldrich) Co., Ltd."
3,Synthesis of nanostructured K-PHI (NK-PHI) and bulk K-PHI,"2.2 Synthesis of nanostructured K-PHI (NK-PHI) and bulk K-PHI The nanostructured K-PHI was synthesized by a steam assisted method. Typically, 8 g melamine and 12 g KCl were fully mixed in a mortar via manual grinding. Then 16 g Mg(OH)2 was placed in the bottom of a columniform corundum crucible, and the mixture of melamine and KCl was placed on the top of Mg(OH)2. Subsequently, the crucible was wrapped by aluminized paper and heated at 550℃ for 4 h with a heating rate of 15℃/min. After the crucible was naturally cooling down to room temperature, the resultant yellow powder was mildly pulled out and added into 150 mL deionized water to remove the residual KCl by stirring for 10 h. Finally, the suspension was filtrated and washed several times by deionized water and alcohol till the specific conductance of filtrate approaching zero. The obtained yellow product was drying at 60℃ in the atmosphere and denoted as NK-PHI. The filtrate of the first filtration was collected for subsequent research. The bulk K-PHI was synthesized via the same approach as that for NK-PHI except without Mg(OH)2."
4,Synthesis of nanostructured PCN (NPCN) and bulk PCN,"2.3 Synthesis of nanostructured PCN (NPCN) and bulk PCN The nanostructured PCN (denoted as NPCN) was synthesized via the same approach with NK-PHI except without KCl. The bulk PCN was synthesized by traditional thermal polymerization. Typically, 8 g melamine was loaded in a columniform corundum crucible and wrapped by aluminized paper. Then the crucible was heated at 550℃ for 4 h with a heating rate of 15℃/min. After cooling down to room temperature, the yellowish product was ground into powder and denoted as PCN."
5,Regeneration of KCl and Mg(OH)2 to reuse in synthesis of NK-PHI,"2.4 Regeneration of KCl and Mg(OH)2 to reuse in synthesis of NK-PHI About 11.58 g KCl was regenerated from the filtrate of the first filtration in NK-PHI synthesis via evaporation at 105℃. Namely, about 0.42 g KCl was lossed on account of participating in the synthesis of NK-PHI as structure-directing agents. Therefore, another 0.42 g KCl was added to the regenerated 11.58 g KCl for a new synthesis of NK-PHI. On the other hand, all the resultant MgO was collected to regenerate Mg(OH)2 by reacting with water, and the chemical equation of regeneration from MgO to Mg(OH)2 is shown in Fig. S2. Typically, 11.06 g MgO was collected and stirred in 221.2 g deionized water for 4 h at 40℃. Then the white solid was filtrated and washed several times by water and alcohol, and dried at 80 for 2 h. The XRD patterns of MgO after calcination, regenerative KCl and Mg(OH)2 were shown in Fig. S2. Regenerative KCl and Mg(OH)2 were reused to synthesize NK-PHI and repeated for three times, and the resultant NK-PHI samples were denoted as NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3, respectively. The MgO after calcination, regenerative Mg(OH)2 and KCl were denoted as MgO/ Mg(OH)2/ KCl-Rx (x represents the cycle index)."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was analyzed by X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation in the 2 theta range of 3-80°. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by Thermo Fisher Nicolet i50 in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured by X'Pert-Pro MPD spectrometer with Cu Ka. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded by Bruker 400 M. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were observed by SU 8000 and tecnai G2 F30 (FEI), respectively. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and TEM element mapping were observed by Helios 450S (FEI). The porosity property was measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption method with Micromeritics TriStar 3020 porosimeter. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The UV–Visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra was tested by UH4150 Spectrophotometer at wavelength region of 205–800 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) was recorded by F-4500FL spectrometer under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The transient fluorescence was tested by FLS1000. The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was measured by standard three-electrode electrochemical analyzer with the CHI 760E (CH Instruments Ins.). The specific measurement detail was described in electrochemical performance test in Supporting Information."
7,Photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER),"2.6 Photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER) The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was carried out by a classical method using Pt and triethanolamine as co-catalyst and sacrificial agent. Typically, 100 mg photocatalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in 100 mL aqueous solution including H2PtCl6 (3 wt% of Pt to photocatalyst) and 10 mL triethanolamine. The reaction system was purged by high purity nitrogen (99.999%) for 15 min to remove the air and irradiated by Xenon lamp (300 W) for 1 h to photo-reduce the Pt on photocatalyst. Then the reaction system was purged by nitrogen again and irradiated for hydrogen evolution test. 1 mL gas was sampled and injected to chromatograph (GC 9790) to analyze the H2 content per hour. After four hours, the reaction system was purged by high purity nitrogen and photocatalytic activity was measured again, repeating for four cycles."
8,Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement,"2.7 Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement The AQE of photocatalyst was tested by photocatalytic H2 evolution under the monochromatic light irradiation. Herein, a series of monochromatic light of different wavelengths (λ = 355, 420, 450, 500 and 600 nm) was used as illuminant and the AQE value was calculated by the follow formula: AQE = 2 × n u m b e r o f H 2 m o l e c u l e s n u m b e r o f i n c i d e n t p h o t o = 2 × M × N A E total E photo × 100 % = 2 × M × N A × h × c S × P × t × λ × 100 % where the M, NA, h and c represent mole number of H2, Avogadro's number, Planck constant and velocity of light, respectively. The S, P, t and λ means light irradiation area, power density of monochromatic light, photocatalytic reaction time and wavelength of monochromatic light, respectively. The specific data are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Crystal and chemical structure analysis,"3.1 Crystal and chemical structure analysis The crystal structure of all samples was analyzed by XRD and the diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 1 a. PCN shows two peaks located at 13.1° and 27.6°, corresponding to the in-plane repeating of heptazine units with a zigzag motif of melon in PCN framework ((100) lattice plane) and interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic system ((002) lattice plane), respectively. The NPCN exhibits a similar XRD pattern but with relatively lower peak intensity compared with PCN, and specially, the (002) peak slightly up-shifts to 27.7° for NPCN (Fig. 1b), which can be attributed to its nanocrystallization as observed by SEM later. The K-PHI and NK-PHI show two strongest diffraction peaks similar to PCN but the (100) peak down-shifts to 8.0° and (002) up-shifts to 28.1° and 28.2°, respectively. The former shift represents the full polymerization of heptazine units to form well-defined in-plane poly(heptazine imide) network and the latter shift corresponds to the decrease of interlayer distance. This is attributed to the involvement of KCl as a reactive structure-directing agent for PHI growth and the nano-engineering of PHI’s structure using a Mg(OH)2-derived steam template. In addition, NK-PHI shows stronger peak intensity and increased diffraction angle of (002) lattice plane compared with NPCN and K-PHI (Fig. 1b), indicating that NK-PHI presents higher crystallinity with denser stacking of unit layers than the other samples. Both high crystallinity and nanocrystallization provide boosted separation and transfer efficiency of photo-induced electrons-holes, which is beneficial to advanced photocatalysis. The chemical structure was measured by FTIR and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1c. NPCN, K-PHI and NK-PHI show infrared absorption peaks similar to PCN, indicating similar chemical structures. Nevertheless, there are still differences. The narrow peak located at 809 cm−1 represents the out-plane bending vibration of heptazine rings. The serial peaks located from 1200 to 1700 cm−1 represent the stretching and bending mode of heptazine derivatives. NK-PHI shows obviously stronger intensities compared with other three samples, corresponding to the more planarized in-plane network. The broad peaks at 3060–3290 cm−1 and 3340–3600 cm−1 are assigned to the terminal amino groups –NH2 and the –OH groups of adsorbed H2O, respectively. Note that the peak of –NH2 for NK-PHI and K-PHI are substantially decreased and even disappeared relative to NPCN and PCN, and the peak of –OH increased inversely, which can be ascribed to the removal of terminal amino in formation of PHI structure and the augment of adsorbed H2O due to the appearance of hydrated K+ in the K-PHI framework [37]. In addition, a slight peak at 2182 cm−1 is clearly observed for NK-PHI and K-PHI, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of cyano units (C≡N) and may be derived from the decomposition of heptazine units. Noticeably, the three peaks at 914, 995 and 1153 cm−1 are observed in NK-PHI and K-PHI but not in NPCN and PCN. The first two peaks can be assigned to characteristic mode of the C–N vibration and the third peak can be ascribed to N–H bending vibration [38]. The existence of C, N and K elements in NK-PHI and K-PHI, and, C and N elements in NPCN and PCN are confirmed by XPS survey spectra (shown in Fig. S3 of Supporting Information). The high resolution spectra of C 1 s, N 1 s and K 2p are used to analyze the valence state of C, N and K elements (shown in Fig. 2 ). The C 1 s high resolution XPS spectra can be described as three peaks by Gaussian distribution, located around 288, 286.3 and 284.8 eV. The peak at 288 and 284.8 eV are assigned to the sp2-hybridized carbon of N–C = N in heptazine units and carbon contaminants in the sample, respectively. The peak at 286.3 eV corresponds to C≡N deriving from the decomposition or incomplete polymerization of heptazine groups, which is in agreement with the FTIR result. The N 1 s high resolution XPS spectra also can be fitted as three peaks located around 401.2, 399.7 and 398.5 eV. The peaks at 401.2 and 399.7 eV are ascribed to the terminal amino group of C–N–H and tertiary nitrogen groups of N–(C)3. The peak of 398.5 eV is assigned to sp2-hybridized nitrogen of C–N = C in heptazine units. Noticeably, the binding energy of N–(C)3 up-shift from 399.7 eV for NPCN and PCN to 400.1 eV for NK-PHI and K-PHI, which is attributed to the interaction of N-K on account of removing terminal amino groups in construction of PHI structure. The four peaks located at 292.6, 292.9, 295.4 and 295.7 eV can be assigned to K 2p of K+ embedded in the interlamination of K-PHI. Meanwhile, the binding energy of NK-PHI exhibits an obvious increase to that of K-PHI, corresponding to the stronger K-N interaction due to the decreased interlayer distance of NK-PHI. Moreover, the solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra were used to analyze the chemical structure of NK-PHI (Fig. 2d). The chemical shift of 171 ppm matches the heptazine carbon atom (C1). The 13C NMR signal at 167 ppm can be assigned to carbon atom (C2) next to deprotonated imide bridge. The strongest chemical shift signal at 164 ppm corresponds to peripheral carbon atom (C3) next to NH group. The chemical shift of 155 ppm is assigned central carbon atom in the heptazine units (C4). As shown in heptazine unit in Fig. 2d, the chemical shift at 119 ppm can connect with N–C = N in neighbouring heptazine (C5) [24,28]."
11,Morphology characterization,"3.2 Morphology characterization The morphology of samples were observed by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 3 . Both the PCN directly polymerized from melamine (Fig. 3a) and the K-PHI synthesized from melamine and KCl (Fig. 3c) consist of irregular bulk granules. In contrast, when the steam-assistant method is adopted, the resultant melon-based NPCN shows a nanoporous laminar morphology (Fig. 3b), and the resultant crystalline sample NK-PHI consists of nanoparticles with interparticle nanopores (Fig. 3d and S10), which is further confirmed by TEM in Fig. 3e. The fringe with lattice spacing of about 0.85 nm can be observed clearly in NK-PHI (Fig. 3f) on account of high crystallinity, which corresponds to the XRD diffraction peak at 10.3°. The elements of C, N, O and K distribute uniformly within the NK-PHI nanoparticles as scanned by TEM element mapping (Fig. 3g-k), further indicating that nanostructured K+-embedded PHI is successfully synthesized. The steam decomposed from Mg(OH)2 at high temperature (about 350℃) is believed to impede the aggregating growth of K-PHI and thus forming nanoparticles instead of large blocks. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution calculated by BET and BJH method are shown in Fig. 4 . The BET specific surface area of PCN and K-PHI are 12.2 and 8.6 m2/g, respectively. The relatively decreased value of K-PHI can be attributed to the deeper polymerization and especially the doping of K+. In contrast, compared with PCN and K-PHI, the nanostructured NPCN and NK-PHI exhibit significantly enhanced specific surface area of 74.5 and 33.8 m2/g, respectively, which can be attributed to the steam-assisted processing. Additionally, abundant mesopores with pore diameter of around 2 ~ 40 nm are detected in NPCN and NK-PHI, which accords well with the SEM and TEM results and is beneficial to mass transfer in photocatalysis."
12,Optical and photoelectrical properties,"3.3 Optical and photoelectrical properties The optical and photoelectrical properties of all samples are measured. As presented in Fig. 5 a, in comparison with PCN and NPCN, the crystalline samples K-PHI and NK-PHI show integrally increased optical absorption performances, which can be attributed to the improved crystallinity and K+-doping. At the same time, the nanostructured samples (NPCN and NK-PHI) exhibit absorption edge with blue-shift as compared with the bulk counterparts (PCN and K-PHI). Correspondingly, the nanoscale NPCN and NK-PHI own band gap of 2.60 and2.62 eV, respectively, which are slightly larger than the bulk counterparts (2.55 and 2.47 eV for PCN and K-PHI, respectively, Fig. 5b), which can be assigned to the quantum size confinement effect of nanostructured samples [36,38,39]. The separation efficiency of photoinduced electrons and holes was characterized by PL spectra. As shown in Fig. 5c, PCN and NPCN show very intensive PL responses, while K-PHI and NK-PHI reveal significantly decreased PL intensity, indicating that K-PHI and NK-PHI possess highly reduced recombination rates of photoinduced electrons and holes. The improved separation and transfer of electrons-holes of K-PHI and NK-PHI is mainly attributed to the stronger local electrostatic potential differences on different heptazine units of PHI owing to the locations of K+. This effect is similar to built-in electric field in heterojunction, which can strongly lead to separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. This point has been verified by DFT calculation in the previous work reported by Lotsch et al, which showed that the HOMO and LOMO of K+ embodied PHI are much better separated in comparison with melon-based PCN [28]. To further confirm the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced charges, the ns-level time-resolved fluorescence lifetime spectra was measured (shown in Fig. 5d and Table. 1). The average fluorescence lifetime of PCN, NPCN, K-PHI and NK-PHI is 3.69, 5.87, 1.51 and 1.86 ns, respectively. The crystalline samples K-PHI and NK-PHI exhibit obviously decreased lifetime value compared with the melon-based samples PCN and NPCN. This can be attributed to the distinctive electron capture, which may fast isolate electrons to prevent them from recombination with holes [24,40,41]. The decreased layer distance can accelerate the photoinduced charges transfer over the layers, promoting the charge carrier migration to interface without recombination, which can be classically confirmed by the following photocurrent and EIS spectra results [30,42]. The photocurrent and EIS spectra further provided evidence to testify the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced charges (as shown in Fig. 5e and 5f). PCN, NPCN, K-PHI and NK-PHI show a gradually increased photocurrent, which suggests the facilitated photoinduced charge separation. Accordingly, PCN, NPCN, K-PHI and NK-PHI are endowed with the increasingly decreased arc radius of EIS spectra. The smaller arc radius indicates the lower impedance and higher photoinduced charges transfer efficiency. NK-PHI especially exhibits the strongest photocurrent response and the lowest impedance, benefiting from the nanostructure and high crystallinity. The tardy decrease of photocurrent for all samples in test is caused by the falling of photocatalysts off the FTO surface."
13,Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity,"3.4 Photocatalytic H2 evolution activity The photocatalytic performance of all samples were tested by hydrogen evolution reaction under the visible light irradiation (shown in Fig. 6 ). All samples show linear and stable photocatalytic H2 production in four hours. Especially, NK-PHI exhibits a highest photocatalytic H2 production rate of 2.161 mmol g-1h−1, which is 38.4, 4.4 and 3.4 times to that of PCN, NPCN and K-PHI, respectively (Fig. 6a and 6b). The increased photocatalytic activity of NK-PHI is attributed to the improved visible light absorption, efficiency of photoinduced charge separation and transfer and active site quantity, benefitting from the high crystallinity and nanostructured morphology. NPCN shows an increased photocatalytic activity of 477 μmol g-1h−1 compared with PCN of 55 μmol g-1h−1, corresponding to the improvement of specific surface area from 12.2 m2/g for PCN to 74.5 m2/g for NPCN. Similarly, the crystalline samples, K-PHI and NK-PHI, exhibit photocatalytic activity of 618 and 2161 μmol g-1h−1, corresponding to the surface area of 8.6 and 33.8 m2/g, respectively. This result indicates that specific surface area of samples is a key factor to effect the photocatalytic activity. Additionally, the high crystallinity is a more indispensable factor for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The crystalline samples K-PHI and NK-PHI exhibited photocatalytic HER rate per unit specific surface area of 71.9 and 62.5 μmol g-1h−1, which are much higher than those of the melon-based samples PCN and NPCN (4.5 and 6.4 μmol g-1h−1). This result further verified the essential effect of PCN crystallinity in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. In addition, to evaluate the impact of the co-catalyst Pt nanoparticles on photocatalysis, TEM images of PCN, NPCN, K-PHI and NK-PHI deposited with Pt nanoparticles have been observed and shown in Fig. S11. The average sizes of Pt nanoparticles on K-PHI and NK-PHI are larger than those of PCN and NPCN, which may result from the violent photodeposition reaction caused by the stronger electron donating ability of K-PHI and NK-PHI. In general, the photocatalytic activity decays with the increase of co-catalyst size. However, although loaded with coarser Pt nanoparticles, NK-PHI and K-PHI still show higher HER activities than NPCN and PCN, which in turn verifies that the improved HER activities of NK-PHI are attributed to increased crystallinity and nanoscale structure rather than the difference of Pt co-catalyst. The photocatalytic stability of NK-PHI was examined for 24 h with intermittent degassing of the reaction every 4 h (Fig. 6c). Noticeably, NK-PHI shows a stable photocatalytic HER activity in the initial two circulations but exhibits a significantly declined HER rate in the third circulation, which is suspected to the over-consumption of sacrificial agent on account of NK-PHI’s vigorous HER activity. Therefore, another 10 mL triethanolamine was supplemented to the reaction solution after the third circulation and the system was purged by high purity nitrogen again. It is as expected that, in the fourth circulation, NK-PHI recovers the excellent HER rate of 2.266 mmol g-1h−1 and a total amount of 8.056 mmol g-1H2 is produced without noticeable activity deterioration, presenting a favorable HER activity with a high stability for long-term photocatalytic application. However, the gradually reduced activity is observed in the fifth and sixth circulations, which may be not only caused by decrease of triethanolamine, but also hindered by the oxidation products of donor reversibly building up on the surface [41]. The AQE under the monochromic light irradiation was tested (Fig. 6d). NK-PHI shows a wavelength dependence of the AQE values for HER, manifesting that the HER was indeed driven by photocatalysis. The AQE value of NK-PHI is estimated to be 2.32% under 420 nm monochromic light irradiation, which far exceeds that of PCN (0.037%) by about 62.7 times. The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity is intimately associated with the characteristics of photocatalyst, such as crystallinity, surface morphology and textural structures. In general, the mechanism of photocatalytic HER can be stated as the following steps: light absorption, photoexcitation, electron-hole pairs separation and transfer to surface, and subsequent surface redox reaction [33]. In this study, the melon-based bulk PCN shows poor light absorption, intensive recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes and insufficient active sites due to low crystallinity and specific surface area, which is adverse to HER. In contrast to PCN, the modified samples NPCN and K-PHI exhibit relatively higher HER activities owning to the nanosized structure and the improved crystallinity, respectively. However, the improvement of photocatalytic activity is finite by single nano-structuring or crystallinity modulation. Therefore, the highly boosted HER activity is endowed to NK-PHI by integrated nano-structuring and crystallinity modulation, which shows significantly improved average HER rate to that of PCN, NPCN and K-PHI. The highly boosted HER activity can be mainly attributed to the significantly decreased recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and increased surface active sites. The K+ plays an indispensable role in the process. In special, the enhanced separation and transfer of photoinduced electron-hole pairs is mainly attributed to the formation of crystalline structure owning to K+ presented in synthesis process. Additionally, the improved HER activity is also attributed to augment of optical absorption performance owning to the K+ doping. The proposed HER mechanism on NK-PHI is illustrated in Fig. 6e. Generally, the electrons and holes are produced under the visible light irradiation. Then the photoinduced holes are quenched by a sacrificial electron donor (triethanolamine) in solution, and the photoinduced electrons quickly transfer to Pt nanoparticle co-catalyst to reduce H+ into H2. The nanostructured crystalline PHI framework embedded with K+ ions have facilitated the whole HER process."
14,Recyclability of KCl and Mg(OH)2,"3.5 Recyclability of KCl and Mg(OH)2 A better-than-expected recyclability of KCl and Mg(OH)2 for NK-PHI synthesis has been demonstrated by cyclic experiments of synthesizing and testing a series of NK-PHI counterparts. The experimental details are present in section 2.4. The steam source Mg(OH)2 became MgO after calcination and the MgO changed back into Mg(OH)2 after reacting with water. Similarly, the regenerative KCl remained the same structure as original KCl. The regenerative Mg(OH)2, KCl and MgO after calcination present uniform XRD and FTIR patterns as similar to the original counterparts (Fig. S2c and d), which indicates the high reusability of Mg(OH)2 and KCl. However, a detail should be noticed that a new peak appears at 2170 cm−1 in KCl-R1, KCl-R2 and KCl-R3 but not in original KCl (Fig. S2f), which is corresponding to the C≡N group in a trace of NK-PHI nanoparticles mixed in the KCl filtrate due to penetration during filtration. The major property comparison of NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2, NK-PHI-R3 and NK-PHI is shown in Fig. 7 . NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3 show similar XRD patterns and FTIR spectra to NK-PHI (Fig. 7a, b), indicating that the cyclically synthesized samples still possess heptazine-based crystalline structure. Additionally, to verify the stability of samples, the XRD and FTIR patterns of NK-PHI, NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3 after photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test have been measured and shown in Fig. S2g and h. The samples after HER reaction show XRD and FTIR patterns similar to original samples, indicating that all samples possessed high stability in the photocatalytic reaction. The unchanged survey spectra and binding energy of C 1 s, N 1 s and K 2p analyzed by XPS (Figs. S3 and S4) again suggest comparable structures of the four samples. Additionally, analogous optical absorption performances and nanostructured morphologies are found for all samples (Fig. 7c and S5). Nevertheless, it is noticeable that, in comparison with NK-PHI, the three cyclically synthesized samples exhibit slightly decreased PL intensity, enhanced photocurrent and reduced impedance (Fig. 7d-f), which thus lead to further improved photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (Fig. 7g, h). Specifically, NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3 exhibit highly boosted average HER rates of 3.481, 3.642 and 3.249 mmol g-1h−1, respectively, which are more than 1.5 times to that of NK-PHI (2.161 mmol g-1h−1). The further improved photoelectrical properties and the resultant increased HER activity can be attributed to the better separation and transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes, which is embedded in PL and photocurrent (Fig. 7d and 7e). It is supposed that in the synthesis of cyclic samples, the melamine and KCl can be mixed more fully benefited from the smaller particle size of regenerated KCl compared with original KCl, which can be observed in Figs. S6 and S7. The K+ content has been tested by ICP and shown in Table S2, which indicates that the increased HER activity of cyclic samples hardly benefits from the change of K+ content. Furthermore, the AQE of NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3 under 420 nm monochromic light irradiation have been tested and shown in Fig. S8. NK-PHI-R1, NK-PHI-R2 and NK-PHI-R3 show AQE value of 3.75%, 5.02% and 3.46% under 420 nm, which are higher than that of NK-PHI and accord well with the HER rates. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S9, NK-PHI shows HER activity of 0.107 and 0.05 mmol g-1h−1 when using methanol and ethanol as sacrificial agent, respectively, which are much less than that of triethanolamine (2.161 mmol g-1h−1)."
15,Conclusions,"3.6 Conclusions In summary, a K+-embedded poly(heptazine imide), NK-PHI, with both high crystallinity and nanostructure was successfully synthesized in one step by a sustainable steam-assisted method based on KCl and Mg(OH)2. The NK-PHI shows highly boosted photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 38.4 and 3.4 times to the pristine PCN and bulk K-PHI under visible light irradiation. This is mainly attributed to the highly increased separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and surface active sites, benefitting from both nanostructured morphology and high crystallinity. Additionally, the used KCl and Mg(OH)2 can be regenerated and recycled to produce NK-PHI with better photocatalytic activities. This work may promote the sustainably synthesis and multidimensional modulation of polymeric carbon nitride."
