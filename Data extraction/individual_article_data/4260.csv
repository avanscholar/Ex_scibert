0,Introduction,"The upsurge in severe problems associated with greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most prominent worldwide problems. The emissions of CO2, the main contributor, have increased significantly over the past few decades in different sectors including energy, agriculture, land use & forestry, industry, and wastes. Particularly in the energy sector, released CO2 accounts for approximately half of the total CO2 emissions [1]. More than 35 billion metric tons of CO2 were emitted globally into the environment in 2015 as a result of fossil fuel combustion [2]. Therefore, the reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change has become a major concern. Recently, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) have been considered as an effective method to alleviate this issue. However, this approach faces many economic and technological hurdles, such as huge investment costs, the uncertainty of CO2 leakage, and the incapability of certain geological areas [3]. Therefore, since it can turn CO2 into valuable products, such as chemicals and fuels, through renewable, cost-effective, and non-toxic processes, CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) has been attracting increasing interest. Given the very large amount of CO2 emissions, using CO2 as a carbon feedstock has become a priority to address the severe issues derived from environmental pollution and sustainable development. Hydrogenating CO2 to produce value-added chemicals and alternative fuels has turned out to be a promising approach among CO2 valorization technologies. Moreover, in the context of sustainable development, using hydrogen produced from renewable resources and industrial wastes, as well as CO2 captured from industrial units, could mitigate the effect of CO2 emissions and residual materials, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels [4–6]. By using heterogeneous and/or homogeneous catalysts, the main products of the CO2 hydrogenation process can be divided into two categories: hydrocarbons and oxygenates [7], including C1 and C1-derived products (CO, methane, methanol (MeOH), dimethyl ether (DME)) and two or more carbon species (higher hydrocarbons, higher alcohols and formates/formic acid), as shown in Fig. 1 . CO is a versatile chemical compound that is found in a wide variety of industrial uses and its synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation is a promising approach from the perspective of sustainable development. CO provides a direct route to methanol, DME, and hydrocarbons, which can then be used as fuels or as intermediates to produce other alternative fuels and chemical compounds. Methanol is another outstanding raw material for the synthesis of DME and hydrocarbons. However, owing to the high CC coupling barrier and many competing reactions leading to the formation of C1 products, the synthesis of C2+ products becomes more challenging [9]. Methanol and DME possess higher values of carbon fuel exergy content per mole of carbon (EXc) (693 and 685 MJ/kmolC, respectively) in comparison with higher carbon compounds such as ethanol (654 MJ/kmolC) and iso-octane (652 MJ/kmolC). Briefly, an estimate of the moles of C atoms required to store one unit of exergy (MJ) in the fuel is provided by the EXc value. In addition, low hydrogen loss (respectively 0.33, 0.25 and 0) occurs throughout the synthesis of methanol, DME, and CO (which can act as feedstock for methanol and DME production as well) due to water formation [10]. CO production by catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a crucial industrial process. The mixture of CO and H2 (syngas) represents the feedstock for methanol synthesis or higher hydrocarbon production via the Fischer-Tropsch process. Syngas can also act as a reducing agent in the steel and metal industry and plays an important role in the pharma, biotechnology, and electronic sectors [11,12]. In addition, methanol is recognized as an important raw material in the chemical and energy industries because of its usage as a building block for the production of other chemicals. For instance, dimethyl ether (DME) is produced via methanol dehydration, light olefin (ethylene and propylene) via the methanol-to-olefins process, dimethyl carbonate via the supercritical CO2 of methanol, formaldehyde, methyl tert-butyl ether, and acetic acid, etc. Methanol can also be used as a liquid energy-carrier in transportation and fuel cell applications. Additionally, methanol can be mixed with gasoline because of its high octane number, which in turn accelerates the antiknock performance, volatility, fuel-air charge, and lean burn properties of the gasoline [13]. DME, in turn, is acknowledged as an alternative fuel for diesel oil because of its high combustion performances such as high cetane number, and low emissions of NOx and SOx [14]. Besides, DME is an essential chemical intermediate for the production of dimethyl sulphate methyl acetate and olefins [15]. Understanding the synthesis of these products can help elucidate the main factors influencing the selectivity of the desired products. Moreover, the synthesis of these products by catalytic conversion of CO2 is an appealing approach to significantly reduce its emissions. Consequently, converting CO2 into green fuels and chemicals such as CO, methanol, and DME is a propitious technology in the context of sustainable development. Apart from the primary issues triggering low CO2 conversion in CO2 hydrogenation, such as active metal sintering and thermodynamic inertness of CO2, water formed as a byproduct deactivates the catalyst, which in turn decreases CO2 conversion and the yield of the desired products. Based on Le Chatelier's principle, a major boost in CO2 conversion to the desired products (CO, MeOH and DME) can be achieved by removing water in-situ from the reaction media using an intensified process of water separation combined with catalytic conversion. To this end, selective membranes or specific hydrophylic sorbent materials can be used to eliminate water molecules while they are formed in the reactor. However, issues related to the blockage of membrane pores, as well as thermal and mechanical stability, limit the usefulness of membranes in reactor systems [16]. Since an overview of the application of membranes in this process has already been covered in the literature [17], in the context of this review, we focus on promising sorption enhanced CO2 hydrogenation processes. Through this intensified sorption-enhanced reaction process (SERP), not only can the reaction be conducted at lower temperatures, but the catalyst deactivation from metal sintering and coking is subsequently reduced. From an economic point of view, this emerging technology is becoming an area of growing interest because of the lower operating costs associated with energy consumption and product separation. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection database to bring to light the rapid increase in publications related to CO2 hydrogenation to CO, methanol, and DME (conventional and intensified processes). The search results are presented in Fig. 2 . In the last decade, the number of publications in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to CO, methanol, and DME has increased significantly, while only little attention has been paid to the sorption-enhanced CO2 hydrogenation processes. While CO is a feedstock and a key intermediate in methanol and DME synthesis, so is methanol, which is a necessary intermediate for DME production. Studying the formation of these reaction intermediates is essential to control the selectivity of the desired products and to understand the complementarity of these three compounds. Therefore, several parameters must be taken into consideration in the design of catalysts with distinct characteristics that are crucial to promote the desired reaction. In the light of rapid progress and increasing achievements in CO2 valorization into valuable products, several reviews of interest have been published. Among those that include the synthesis of CO, methanol, or DME from CO2 hydrogenation processes, the following topics have been covered: the performance of different heterogeneous metal-based catalysts [8,18–25], thermodynamic and kinetics considerations [24,26,27], reactor choice and design [25,26,28], optimization of the operating conditions [25,28,29], as well as the reaction mechanisms [8,23,24,26–28]. However, the numerous reasons for catalytic efficiency have not yet been discussed in detail. A comprehensive and critical review is essential to describe the status of catalyst development and key factors affecting catalytic structure and CO2 hydrogenation activity. In this context, this review intends to shed light on challenges and opportunities related to the development of heterogeneous catalysts and innovative processes for direct CO2 hydrogenation into CO, methanol, and DME. The thermodynamic considerations related to the synthesis of each product are first detailed, followed by the presentation of the different types of metal-based heterogeneous catalysts used, emphasizing their active phases and roles in the activation and deactivation of CO2. We further focus on the catalytic supports and their surface properties, which regulate the dispersion and reducibility of the active sites, and the relationship between catalyst structure and activity. Finally, we expound the preparation methods that provide different synergistic effects between active and support metals, as effective strategies to improve catalytic performance. It is worth mentioning that this appealing concept of CO2 valorization comes up against the high thermodynamic stability of this molecule, which is a crucial challenge limiting even the most active catalytic materials to achieve high CO2 conversion. Therefore, for the first time, the state-of-the-art intensified sorption-enhanced process (modelling and experimental applications) is discussed to elucidate the feasibility of overcoming the thermodynamic limit, with the rationale of choosing appropriate water sorbents. The strengths of this new concept, which justify its attractiveness, are identified as well as the shortcomings surrounding its implementation in the industrial sector."
1,Thermodynamic considerations,
2,CO2 hydrogenation to CO,"2.1 CO2 hydrogenation to CO CO is derived from the endothermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) (Eq. (1)): (1) C O 2 + H 2 ⇔ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = + 41.2 kJ/mol However, side reactions can also occur to produce methane (Eqs. (2−3)): Methanation: (2) CO + 3 H 2 ⇔ C H 4 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = − 206.5 kJ/mol Sabatier reaction: (3) C O 2 + 4 H 2 ⇔ C H 4 + 2 H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = − 165.0 kJ/mol Due to the endothermic nature of reaction (1), CO2 conversion and CO selectivity are thermodynamically enhanced at high temperature. Reaction (1) is also favored at higher H2/CO2 ratio. However, a thermodynamic analysis reveals that even with a H2/CO2 of 4, the conversion is limited to 80 % for a temperature as high as 800 °C [30]. CO2 conversion is not affected by pressure. Consequently, the operating costs depend directly on the temperature and ratio of H2/CO2 [31]."
3,CO2 hydrogenation to methanol,"2.2 CO2 hydrogenation to methanol Generally, two major competing reactions are included in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol: methanol synthesis (Eq. (4)) and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) (Eq. (1)) [32]: (4) C O 2 + 3 H 2 ⇔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = − 49.5 kJ/mol (1) C O 2 + H 2 ⇔ CO + H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = + 41.2 kJ/mol Additionally, CO formed via RWGS can be hydrogenated into methanol (Eq. (5)): (5) CO + 2 H 2 ⇔ C H 3 OH Δ H 298 K 0 = − 90.6 kJ/mol According to Le Châtelier’s principle, high pressure, low temperature, and high molar ratio of H2/CO2 thermodynamically favor the conversion of CO2 to methanol. A reaction temperature higher than 240 °C is considered to facilitate the activation of CO2 molecules because of its thermodynamic stability and chemical inertness [7,33]. However, methanol selectivity is reduced at high temperature because of the prominence of RWGS to produce CO [34]. For example, based on a thermodynamic analysis at 30 bar, methanol selectivity at 200 °C is above 90 %, whereas it is only approximately 10 % at 300 °C [34]. Regarding pressure, although the research on hydrogenation at pressures lower than 2 MPa shows unattractive catalyst performance [35], operating at high pressure is not cost-effective because of higher installation and operation costs. In terms of reactant ratio, for H2/CO2 higher than the stoichiometric value, methanol selectivity is promoted while the formation of by-products (CO and H2O) is inhibited [34]. Nevertheless, a techno-economic evaluation should be taken into high consideration for industrial implementation."
4,CO2 hydrogenation to DME,"2.3 CO2 hydrogenation to DME Two possible routes are well-known: (i) a two-step process when methanol produced from CO2 hydrogenation is dehydrated to DME (Eq. (6)) and (ii) a one-step process when DME is directly formed (Eq. (7)). (6) 2C H 3 OH ⇔ C H 3 OC H 3 + H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = − 23.4 kJ/mol (7) 2C O 2 + 6 H 2 ⇔ C H 3 OC H 3 + 3 H 2 O Δ H 298 K 0 = − 122 kJ/mol Considering that DME is produced by methanol dehydration, the thermodynamic issues are closely linked to methanol synthesis, as discussed in §2.2. In addition, high pressure and low temperature are thermodynamically favorable to the production of DME."
5,Catalysts for CO synthesis through RWGS reaction,"In contrast to the direct synthesis of methanol and DME, CO is derived from an endothermal reaction (Eq. (1)). At first sight, the amount of H2 required to maintain a stoichiometric feed ratio is lower compared to other CO2 hydrogenation processes, which can be a good asset given the high cost of producing H2 from renewable sources. Since CO is much more reactive than CO2, the RWGS reaction is often seen as the primary intermediate stage for many other critical processes of CO2 hydrogenation such as CO2 methanation [4] or CO2 conversion to methanol [30]. Therefore, it becomes a priority to develop appropriate catalytic materials synthesized by efficient techniques, which allow high conversion at lower reaction temperature. Section 3.1-3.3 will emphasize different types of catalyst, preparation methods chosen to incorporate active phases, as well as catalytic supports offering the best performances in stability and CO2 conversion."
6,Precious metal catalysts,"3.1 Precious metal catalysts Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh show good assets to perform adequately in RWGS [36]. Corrosion resistance as well as strong activity in H2 dissociation can improve both stability and CO2 conversion performance on noble metal-based catalysts [30]. One of the reasons why Ru and Rh have been considered is because they have already proven good activity in CO2 methanation, which is likely to occur via the intermediate route of the RWGS reaction [30]. However, CO selectivity is strongly dictated by the presence of different promoters, the support used, and the particle size and distribution. Büchel et al. [37] found that K incorporation into the structure of 1% Rh deposited on Al2O3 by two-nozzled flame spray pyrolysis showed 100 % selectivity for CO in a wide range of temperatures (300−700 °C), while K-free Rh/Al2O3 catalyst formed almost exclusively CH4 below 500 °C. Chemisorption analysis proved that such results could be obtained because of the weak interaction between the K-containing catalyst and CO compared to Rh/Al2O3, which caused its premature desorption before further reduction to elementary C. This uncommon method of catalyst preparation allows to selectively deposit Rh on the alumina support or on the potassium promoter. It was established that preferential deposition of Rh particles on the K-containing phase was more efficient over 500 °C. This was explained by the hypothesis that a larger quantity of CO2 was converted into products (mainly CO or CH4) by Rh active sites when they are directly deposited on the K-containing phase, which improves the CO2 adsorption. Liang et al. [38] also reported the promoting effect of K on Pt-mullite catalyst towards the RWGS reaction by enhancing significantly the conversion and the selectivity of CO. They considered that the improvement in CO selectivity was due to the interface formed between KOX and Pt. This could act as an active site for formate decomposition, leading to CO production. Unlike the work of Büchel et al. [37], the sequence of Pt and K addition on the mullite support had no effect on the catalytic performances of the catalysts prepared by coprecipitation. Similar promoting behavior was observed K.K. Bando et al. [39] when Li (another alkali-metal) was impregnated on a zeolite supported Rh catalyst (RhY). As shown in Fig. 3 , even if the CO2 conversion decreased from 24.1 % (Li/Rh = 0) to 13.1 % (Li/Rh = 10), Li addition shifted significantly the selectivity towards CO from 0.3% to 86.6%. These results were attributed to the fact that Li incorporation boosted the CO2 adsorption and thereby hindered the direct CO2 activation by H2. Moreover, Li was capable of promoting the desorption of the adsorbed CO molecules instead of their dissociative hydrogenation (similar to the effect of K addition in Büchel et al. [37]), resulting in a preferential CO production by Li/RhY catalysts. Pt was found to be more active than Rh and Ru in the RWGS reaction [40]. Chen et al. [38] impregnated Pt on TiO2 support and studied the effect of metal loading on the catalytic performances. The authors found that the size of Pt particles increased alongside the Pt loading (average diameter of 1.05 +/- 0.43 nm for 0.1 % Pt loading and 2.28 +/- 0.78 nm for 5 % Pt loading). A test carried out at 400 °C and atmospheric pressure showed that 0.1 % Pt/TiO2 reached a 14 % CO2 conversion with almost no CH4 formation. The kinetic study conducted by the authors suggested that larger particles present on the higher metal loading catalysts (5 %) could play a pivotal role in catalyzing CO towards CH4 through a consecutive reaction pathway ( C O 2 → C O → C H 4 ), since the activation energy for CO2 methanation (Ea) was found to be lower for higher Pt loaded catalysts. For instance, at 400 °C the 5% Pt/TiO2 catalyst showed a higher selectivity towards methane (36 %) compared to 0.1 % Pt/TiO2 (0 %). Another study conducted by Choi et al. [41] investigated the effect of active metals supported on alumina on CO2 hydrogenation performances. Urea was used in the catalyst synthesis as a basic agent to facilitate the adsorption of positive active metal ions onto the support. Pd-based (noble metal) and Cu-based (non-noble metal) catalysts showed similar CO2 conversions, while significant differences were observed for CO selectivity especially at temperatures higher than 600 °C. The drop in CO selectivity from 100 % (with Cu) to below 60 % (with Pd) at 900 °C was explained by the high H2 dissociation ability of noble metals like Pd, which favors methane formation over CO at higher temperatures. The addition of other metals like Fe can lead to synergistic effects when they are incorporated to precious metal-based catalysts. The use of mixed ionic-electronic conductive oxides like CeO2 or samarium doped ceria (SDC) as catalytic support also helps to enhance the metal-support interaction effect [42,43]. Such behaviors were observed when both Fe and Ru were mixed in specific proportions and incorporated on a SDC support [44]. For instance, a Ru/Fe blend of 45/55 (mass %) could reach a constant CO yield close to equilibrium above 550 °C. By comparing catalysts with different blends (Ru/Fe = 20/80, 45/55 and 80/20), it was concluded that the optimum 45/55 mixture can benefit from the assets of both metals: (i) a poor CO yield at lower temperatures (below 500 °C) but a strong one at higher temperatures (above 550 °C) coming from Fe, and (ii) a relatively constant CO yield above 550 °C coming from Ru. SEM analysis also suggested that higher Fe loading catalysts (minimum 80 % Fe) caused particle agglomeration and promoted methane formation over CO, which could explain the lower CO yield obtained for these catalysts. In comparison with supports such as yttria-stabilized zirconia and carbon, catalysts using SDC display higher stability and selectivity toward CO, which highlights the importance of choosing a suitable support. In short, the use of precious metals as catalysts in the RWGS reaction has, in many cases, been convincing. Their high activity in the CO2 methanation, however, limits their use without the addition of promoters of all sorts to attenuate this flaw. In addition, the high cost and difficult access to these types of materials constitute a major obstacle to their potential use in economically profitable industrial-scale CO2 conversion processes [27]. A summary of precious metal-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CO is given in Table 1 ."
7,Non-noble metal catalysts,"3.2 Non-noble metal catalysts Cu-based catalysts, which are already widely used in the industrial WGS reaction, are also the most studied for the reverse reaction because of their high activity and lower costs. Indeed, the efficacy of copper lies in its increased adsorption ability for the reaction intermediates [31]. For instance, ternary catalysts containing Cu (like Cu/ZnO supported on Al2O3) are among the most used catalysts for this process since they show high selectivity for CO especially at low temperatures (170−250 °C) [46–48]. Because of the endothermicity of this reaction, higher temperatures would however be required to reach CO2 conversions closer to thermodynamic equilibrium. Nonetheless, these catalysts showed drawbacks linked to sintering and stability issues as well as a tendency to high re-oxidation occurring over 600 °C (when CO production is favored thermodynamically). To overcome these drawbacks, different promoters (such as Fe and K) and supports can be integrated to the Cu catalysts to achieve higher stability. As reported by Chen et al. [49], the addition of Fe to Cu-based catalysts supported on either SiO2 or Al2O3 would lead to a preferential oxidation of Fe with respect to Cu, thus reducing the sintering effect of Cu and maintaining its activity over a longer period. At high temperatures (above 600 °C), Cu activity can also be increased by the addition of Fe which has larger thermal stability and oxygen mobility [31]. A similar Fe effect was observed in the case of Ru [44]. Data presented in Table 2 prove that the increased stability of Fe-promoted Cu/SiO2 catalysts is indeed due to a reduction of the sintering phenomena, which leads to drastic changes in specific surfaces and particle size. In addition, the catalysts containing iron are able to maintain relatively constant surface area and particle size even after a long reaction time (120 h and 72 h for SiO2 and Al2O3-supported catalysts, respectively), which confirms the ability of Fe to increase the stability of the catalyst. Other types of promoters such as alkali metals (K, Na or Cs) have also been integrated to the structure of Cu-based catalysts to improve their activity by promoting the electron transfer between the reacting molecules, which leads to an enhancement in CO2 adsorption on the surface [31]. For instance, Chen et al. [50] proved that K increased the surface dispersion of Cu active sites, which led to a higher CO2 conversion (12.8 %) compared to K-free Cu/SiO2 catalysts (5.3 %). The hypothesis that K addition could lead to better CO2 adsorption was supported by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results (179 and 3006 μmol of CO2 adsorbed per gram of catalyst for Cu/SiO2 and 1.9 % K/Cu/SiO2, respectively). This indicates that K could create new adsorption sites for CO2. According to the CO2 conversion performance, the amount of K added to the reference catalyst (Cu/SiO2) could reach an optimum at 1.9 % K (mass). Higher addition of K (5.2 %) caused a strong decrease in the specific surface area, due to the coverage of the Cu active sites by K. Similar behavior has been observed by Pastor-Pérez et al. [31] for the incorporation of Cs to the structure of Fe-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. Cs exhibited a promoting effect especially at lower temperatures (400−500 °C), reflected by higher CO2 conversion compared to the catalyst without Cs. The methanation reaction was also inhibited, while the selectivity for CO remained optimal (higher than 99 %) over the whole range of temperatures investigated (400−740 °C). The basic properties of Cs (similar to K [50]) can facilitate the CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface by enabling the electron transfer from catalyst to reactants. A 50 h test on stream demonstrated that Cs-Fe-Cu/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited exceptional long-term stability (absence of coke). The effect of the support composition on the performances of Cu-based catalysts has been reported in different works. Zhou et al. [51] studied the performances of Cu catalyst supported on mesoporous CeO2. Since CeO2 has high oxygen storage capacity and high surface area, this catalytic support is interesting because it increases the number of active sites [51] and, consequently, catalyst activity. Both Cu0 species and oxygen vacancies created during the H2 reduction of the xCuO/CeO2 catalyst precursors are considered to act as active sites in CO2 hydrogenation. This hypothesis was proven for single-component Cu and CeO2 catalysts, which both exhibited CO2 conversion (0.14 and 0.40 mmol CO2/gcat min, respectively). For Cu/CeO2, an increase of Cu loading led to the formation of a larger amount of Cu0 active sites but also promoted their aggregation into a large crystalline phase. Such behavior is likely to decrease the probability of Ce3+ species formation, which promotes the creation of oxygen vacancies due to the weakened interaction between Cu and Ce species and the limitation of the reaction Ce 4+ + Cu 0 /Cu + ⇔ Ce 3+ + Cu 2+ . Among the studied bi-component catalysts, 8% Cu/CeO2 showed the highest CO2 conversion over the entire tested temperature range (240−400 °C). The volcanic trend illustrated in Fig. 4 also demonstrates that a compromise is essential in the proportion of Cu0 and oxygen vacancies active sites to achieve optimum CO2 conversion. Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to combine the advantages derived from the catalyst support (like the above-mentioned active sites of CeO2 support) and the synergistic effect of mixing several metals. As shown in Fig. 5 , the effect provided by a combination of metals may or may not be beneficial to the carbon monoxide yield of the reaction. Yang et al. [52] recently studied the performances of a series of novel bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2-promoted alumina support. The choice of Al2O3-Ce2O3 support was justified by the mixed structure of this material, which improves the redox properties of the catalyst and provides relatively large surface areas for active phase dispersion, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Fe-Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 and Fe-Cu/CeO2-Al2O3 exhibited significant improvements in the CO2 conversion compared to Fe/CeO2-Al2O3 (taken as reference), especially at temperatures lower than 600 °C. XPS analysis of the Fe 2p3/2 level suggested that the incorporation of Ni and Cu into the Fe-based catalyst led to the formation of relatively strong interactions between these metals and Fe because of the slight decrease in the electron density of Fe. This electron deficient state of Fe is known to enhance the catalytic activity [53]. Cu and Ni are also known to have intrinsic activity towards CO2 hydrogenation, which contributes to improve the overall CO2 conversion further. However, selectivity is a divergent parameter between Ni-Fe/CeO2-Al2O3 and Cu-Fe/CeO2-Al2O3. While the Cu-based catalyst showed 100 % selectivity towards CO over the entire temperature range (400−750 °C), the Ni-based catalyst was highly selective for CH4 under 500 °C (CH4 selectivity higher than 50 %). These observations make sense since Ni is well known for its high methanation capacity compared to Cu, which is recognized to inhibit it [8]. Similar conclusions were drawn from stability tests in which CO2 conversion and CO selectivity were recorded at 500 °C for 48 h. While Cu-Fe/CeO2-Al2O3 outperformed Ni-Fe/CeO2-Al2O3 for CO selectivity (≈ 100 % against ≈ 50 %), the CO2 conversion was kept higher for the Ni-containing catalyst (≈ 55 % against ≈ 40 %). Nonetheless, both Ni-based and Cu-based catalysts showed excellent stability as steady behaviors were observed with regard to CO selectivity and CO2 over the long-term catalytic runs. Besides, the absence of carbon-containing species detected by XRD on post-stability test samples for both Ni and Cu-containing catalysts was attributed to the excellent redox properties of CeO2, which can also prevent sintering. In summary, the use of non-noble metals is often justified by the low cost of these materials. While Cu-based catalysts are among the most commonly used, the addition of alkali metals (K, Na, Cs) and Fe as promoters is often required to enhance the selectivity towards CO. For their part, catalysts containing Ni seem to promote the methanation of CO2 rather than its conversion to CO. A summary of non-noble metal-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CO is given in Table 3 ."
8,Transition metal carbides catalysts,"3.3 Transition metal carbides catalysts Transition metal carbides (TMCs) used as catalysts are often referred as “low-cost precious metals” since they are more affordable, while offering a behavior similar to that of noble elements such as Pt, Pd Ru or Rh [54] regarding the catalytic activity and selectivity, as well as chemical and physical resistance towards transformation of hydrocarbons [55,56]. The addition of carbon to transition metals affects the binding strength and reactivity of the adsorbates, which increase the capacity of the catalyst to dissociate HH and CO bonds. These materials have also been reported to have the capacity to adsorb CO2 from low concentration sources (such as atmospheric air), becoming interesting for industrial applications [57]. TMCs can therefore be considered good catalytic candidates for CO2 hydrogenation reactions such as RWGS, as evidenced by different works that have hitherto been carried out. Compared to metal carbides with a carbon/metal ratio below 1 (like Mo2C for instance), carbides with higher carbon content like TiC or MoC (carbon/metal ratio = 1) are often chosen as catalytic materials because they are much less aggressive towards the CO2 molecule [55,58]. Molybdenum carbide catalysts are also frequently chosen to activate several types of reactions such as reforming [59], dehydrogenation [60], and WGS [61]. They also demonstrated to be more active and highly selective to CO compared to other carbides such as TiC, ZrC, NbC, TaC or WC [62]. Rodriguez et al. [55] studied the enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation performances by depositing small particles of Au, Cu, and Ni as ad-metal on the surface of a TiC crystal. It was revealed that the coverage of the ad-metals on the carbide surface had a strong influence on the catalytic activity. For all catalysts tested, CO production rate, which can reflect the overall CO2 conversion, was significantly higher for smaller ad-metal coverage. Higher ad-metal coverage, which led to the increase of particle size, favored the particle growth in 3D mode. In other words, when the particle of the ad-metal is smaller, it settles on the surface of TiC (2D growth mode) and is electronically disturbed by it, which increases its catalytic activity. On the other hand, for 3D ad-metal particles, most of the atoms are not in direct contact with the carbide substrate, so they exhibit the catalytic activity of regular metals (Au, Cu, and Ni). Compared to a Cu (111) and Cu/ZnO (000 1 ¯ ) catalyst, Cu/TiC showed a higher production rate of CO which confirms that the synergistic effect between Cu and TiC could enhance the catalytic activity. Porosoff et al. [63] compared the performances of Mo2C catalyst and precious metal bimetallic ones supported on CeO2 at low temperatures (300 °C). As shown in Table 4 , Mo2C was able to outperform both PtCo/CeO2 and PdNi/CeO2 regarding the activity and selectivity for CO. Moreover, the positive effect of Co addition to Mo2C is similar to the one brought by the ad-metals on TiC [55]. Indeed, Co-Mo2C promotes the RWGS reaction by slightly increasing the CO2 conversion but boosting significantly the selectivity towards CO. The improvement in selectivity after Co incorporation was attributed to the formation of amorphous CoMoCyOz, which could be a critical active phase for CH4 dissociation. This phase can react with the produced methane or other CHx intermediates for methane formation, thus helping increase the CO:CH4 ratio. Hence, Co-promoted Mo2C was shown to offer the best performance in the RWGS reaction. Inspired by the work of Porosoff et al. [63], Gao et al. [56] investigated the effect of crystal phases and morphology of isostructural (α-MoC1-x) and hexagonal (β-Mo2C) molybdenum carbide nanowires on their catalytic performance in RWGS reaction. The catalysts were obtained by adjusting the calcination temperature to promote the appearance of preferential crystalline phases (650 °C for α-MoC1-x and 750 °C for β-Mo2C). Compared to a commercial Mo2C, the nanowires exhibited higher CO2 conversion over 300 °C. For instance, near 60 % was converted at 600 °C with both α-MoC1-x and β-Mo2C compared to approximately 40 % for the commercial material. While minor differences were observed between the performances of the two nanowire catalysts (more than 97 % CO selectivity), the commercial Mo2C showed significant deficiency attributed to the low specific surface area. As mentioned in §3.2, Cu-based catalysts have been widely used in the RWGS reaction because of their high activity and low costs. In an attempt to limit the issues related to their premature deactivation occurring at temperatures higher than 600 °C, Zhang et al. [64] synthesized a Cu supported on β-Mo2C catalyst in order to increase the copper dispersion (which is often the cause of sintering and further deactivation). Like Mo2C, TMCs shown above are known as efficient substrates to disperse metals by preventing its agglomeration [63,65]. Surface characterization of catalysts with different Cu content demonstrated that higher dispersion levels are obtained for low Cu loadings (1% wt. or less), suggesting that Cu particles tend to agglomerate when they are present in a higher amount on the surface of Mo2C. These findings, in conjunction with the catalytic tests, indicated that the activity of the catalysts is directly linked to the Cu dispersion, since the materials with low Cu content turned out to be the most active catalysts. In comparison with the work of Porosoff et al. [63] where Co was added to the structure of Mo2C, the catalyst prepared by Zhang et al. [64] (Cu/β-Mo2C) turned out to be even more efficient to convert CO2 to CO, the conversion rate (molCO2/gcat/s) being more than 5 times higher in the same conditions (H2/CO2 = 2, P =1 atm, T = 300 °C). The 1 % wt. Cu/β-Mo2C catalyst was also able to achieve higher conversion compared to the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 between 300 °C and 600 °C) (e.g., 33 % vs. 24 % at 500 °C). However, major improvements were observed in the stability test where the Cu/β-Mo2C could maintain 85 % of its initial activity after 40 h on stream, while the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 was quickly deactivated by losing 60 % of its activity (from 42.5 % to 15 % CO2 conversion) after only 15 h. This was explained by the ability of Mo2C to disperse Cu particles in a very homogeneous way, which helps prevent sintering, in comparison with the Cu nanoparticles that agglomerated on the Zn-Al support (particle size of 8.7 and 16.4 nm, before and after 15 h of reaction, respectively). Another interesting finding is that the Cu/β-Mo2C catalyst dissociates CO2 easily, which is the key step in the RWGS reaction. Fig. 6 illustrates the high efficiency of Cu/β-Mo2C to activate the reaction even at low temperatures, compared to β-Mo2C and commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. As for noble and non-noble metal-based catalysts, the addition of alkali promoters to TMCs could help strengthen the CO and CO2 adsorption and increase selectivity towards CO. Very recently, Morse et al. [66] evaluated the effect of the addition of Na and K promoters to tungsten carbide (WC). The WC alkali metal promoted catalysts were supported on high surface γ-Al2O3. CO and CO2 adsorption experiments confirmed the hypothesis that the addition of alkali promoters increases the CO2 adsorption, the CO2 uptake on the surface being significantly higher for the promoted catalyst compared to the unpromoted WC (CO2 uptake = 3.8, 21.8, and 79.9 respectively for WC, K-WC, and Na-WC). Moreover, lower H2 uptake on the surface of alkali-promoted catalysts could result in an improved selectivity towards CO, through the inhibition of the hydrogenation activity. This was confirmed by catalytic tests, the CO selectivity increasing from 88 % (unpromoted WC) to 98.1 % and 100 % for K-WC and Na-WC, respectively, at 350 °C and 2.0 MPa. However, no promoter was able to enhance the CO2 conversion compared to WC and Mo2C (as reference catalyst). According to SEM analysis, Na and K could also act as structural promoters since the tungsten-rich regions present in the promoted catalysts were dispersed in a more homogeneous way in comparison with the unpromoted WC, where clear segregation could be observed between the W and the γ-Al2O3 phase. Therefore, the possibility for these structural promoters to alter the geometry and crystallographic orientation of the active sites, which can affect their availability for reactants, should not be ruled out to explain the decrease in the activity of alkali promoted catalysts [67]. This hypothesis was also supported by the lower BET surface areas of the promoted catalyst. Hence, K and Na-WC promoted catalysts seemed to be effective to improve CO selectivity, but they could not match the performance of unpromoted WC or even that of Mo2C in terms of CO2 conversion. To resume, TMC catalysts are presented in the literature as inexpensive materials that can offer similar performance to noble metal catalysts. One of the major strengths of these catalysts is that they can provide high metal dispersion leading to enhanced activity. Again, it has been reported that alkali promoters could help increase CO2 adsorption on TMC catalysts and selectivity to CO. A summary of transition metal carbides catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CO is given in Table 5 ."
9,Catalysts for methanol synthesis,"Since the 1920s, methanol has been industrially produced from synthesis gas at 250−350 bar and 300−450 °C. Due to the presence of impurities (sulphur and chlorine compounds) in the synthesis gas at that time, ZnO/Cr2O3 catalyst was used because of its higher resistance to the impurities than the Cu catalyst. When the reagents contain fewer impurities, Cu-based catalysts (mostly copper, zinc, and aluminum phases) have been investigated because of their high activity, high selectivity, and cost-effectiveness [68]. From 1966, the very high-pressure (150−250 bar) process was replaced by the ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) technology that uses lower pressure (70−100 bar), a feed of CO/CO2/H2, and a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [69]. Since then, significant efforts have been made to improve the performance of Cu-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in spite of their low thermal resistance. Despite their high cost and scarcity, noble metal-based catalysts (like Pd) are also good candidates because of their high thermal resistance. In addition, bimetallic catalysts with distinct properties and excellent performances in comparison with their monometallic counterparts have been highlighted. An overview of the development of Cu-based, Pd-based, and bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with respect to their activity, selectivity, and stability, will make the object of the following sections."
10,Cu-based catalysts,"4.1 Cu-based catalysts 4.1.1 Active metallic phases Among the catalysts extensively used in the last decades, copper-based ones have received considerable attention. The issue of the active sites involved in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is still under debate. In most studies, the main active site for methanol synthesis is suggested to be Cu0, seeing that the catalyst activity is directly related to the surface area and dispersion of metallic Cu [70,71]. Ren et al. [71] stated that the formation of methanol is enhanced by the dispersion of Cu0. Similarly, Chinchen et al. [72] reported that the surface area of Cu0 is linearly proportional to the activity of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in CO/CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. However, numerous studies reported that (i) Cu+ also acts as an active site on the ground that the concentration of ionic copper is related to the catalyst activity and (ii) Cu0 can be oxidized to Cu+ because a large fraction of the surface of metallic Cu is covered by oxygen-containing species [73–75]. This assumption is strongly supported by work performed by Nakamura et al. [73], which showed that the formation of methanol is proportional to the amount of Cu+/Cu0 and inversely proportional to the Cu0 surface. Research has also focused on the synergistic effect between Cu and Zn in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol because the catalytic activity of the binary catalyst was reported to be significantly higher than that of metallic Cu. Owing to the synergistic effect between Cu and ZnO, two active phases are suggested: (i) CuxZn(1-x)Oy, created by the migration of Cu in ZnO and (ii) Cu-Zn alloys, formed by the partial dissolution of migrated ZnOx species into the Cu particles [76–80]. Besides, the role of Zn is not only to enhance the dispersion and stability of Cu, but to be a lattice site for Cu+ [81,82]. Furthermore, by activating H2 by heterogeneous splitting to form ZnH and OH, ZnO acts as a hydrogen pool providing hydrogen for further hydrogenation of reaction intermediates [83]. Dennison et al. [84] compared the NMR spectra of the reduced Cu/Zn/Al and Cu-free catalysts and found that the presence of Cu promotes the number of ZnH species, indicating that a higher amount of hydrogen is adsorbed on ZnO in the Cu containing sample. Other researchers have proposed that the hydrogenation of the adsorbed carbonate to form methanol is likely to occur through hydrogen spillover in which the atomic hydrogen transfers from the Cu surface to either the ZnO surface or ZnOx, at the Cu/ZnO interface [77,85]. 4.1.2 Challenges in catalyst deactivation There are three main causes of catalyst deactivation during methanol synthesis: (i) sintering of Cu or CuO crystallites, (ii) deposition of by-product (e.g., water), and (iii) coke formation [86]. Copper sintering is widely considered the main problem in catalyst deactivation [87] and is depicted as the growth of nanoparticles at the expense of smaller nanoparticles [88]. The sintering of copper crystallites results in a decline in surface area and a drop in pore volume, subsequently hindering the mass transfer of reactants and products [89]. The catalyst is eventually deactivated. Kurtz et al. [90] reported that approximately 40 % of catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO is lost after 80 h on stream. The authors found that this dramatic catalytic loss is related to a 40 % drop in the Cu surface area and sintering of metallic Cu. Agglomeration of Cu particles and growth in particle size were clearly observed on transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the spent catalyst [91]. Ostwald ripening has been suggested as a reason for the significant drop in catalytic activity at the beginning of the reaction, due to the presence of adsorbate species surrounding larger Cu particles and the increased number of larger particles along with a drop in smaller particles. Based on X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and XRD patterns at different temperatures, a scheme of Cu clusters in Cu/ZnO was proposed by Tohji et al. [92] to identify a structural change in the vicinity of Cu atoms (Fig. 7 ). Below 127 °C, a quasi-two-dimensional layer of copper oxide is established on the ZnO support, while metallic copper clusters have the tendency to agglomerate to large particles around 227 °C. This leads to a decrease in the number of Cu atoms exposed on the surface and a decline in the interfacial contact between Cu and support. At higher temperatures, a dispersion of large clusters on the support can be observed. As a by-product in both RWGS and methanol synthesis, water obviously has a negative impact on catalyst deactivation [89]. Water can soften the copper catalyst, leading to a morphological change, particle breakage, and high pressure drop in the reactor [93]. The presence of high water concentration tends to inhibit the reactions and the adsorption on active sites [94]. In addition, water can boost the modification of crystallites and the structure of Cu [95]. Sun et al. [89] reported that the methanol formation rate is kinetically impeded by the high partial pressure of water. Regarding the coke formation, it is well-known that it is uncommon with Cu-based catalysts [93], because Cu has an almost negligible role in CO bond cleavage and CC bond formation. Consequently, wax formation or carbon deposition from hydrocarbon is not considered a serious problem in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [93]. 4.1.3 Catalyst supports in Cu-based catalysts The catalyst support plays a crucial role in the supported metal catalysts, as it brings out the ability of the catalytically active site. Besides, the adsorption characteristics of the reactants (H2 and CO2) leading to different reaction performances can be modified by the interaction between metal and support [96]. In the CO2 hydrogenation process, a catalyst support requires several essential characteristics: (i) high surface area to facilitate the dispersion and reducibility of the active phase, (ii) morphological stability, and (iii) high mechanical strength [97,98]. Supports with redox ability such as rare-earth and transition-metal oxides (e.g., CeO2) are known to facilitate the CO2 activation because the oxygen vacancy site derived from redox ability provides an active site for the adsorption of oxygen atoms of CO2; the catalyst activity therefore increases [96]. In addition, in the presence of oxygen vacancy, the surface will become electron-enriched. As a result, the electron-donating ability of the surface will significantly enhance and make the surface active toward hydrogen adsorption [99]. However, recent studies reported that the electron-accepting property through the existence of Lewis acidic sites at the boundary of copper nanoparticles and oxide support could also be crucial to promote the selectivity of methanol. This can be ascribed to the relative electron-accepting property of Lewis acidic sites in stabilizing and facilitating the hydrogenation of reaction intermediates (formate and methoxy species) at the interface of metal-oxide [100–104]. Moreover, hydrophobic supports are used to prevent the surface from adsorbing water on the grounds that the existing water in the reaction media (which can provide an oxygen atom to the oxygen vacant sites) tends to enter in competition with CO2, the adsorption of CO2 being subsequently inhibited [99]. Generally, ZnO, Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, and SiO2 are extensively used as catalyst supports for methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation [105,106]. An investigation carried out by Lee et al. [106] revealed that at the same percentage of Cu on different supports, the order of ZnO > Fe2O3 > SiO2 > Al2O3 > ZrO2 > TiO2 shows the downward ability to boost CO2 conversion. However, methanol selectivity varies as following: Al2O3 > ZnO > TiO2 > ZrO2 > Fe2O3 > SiO2 [106]. Along with its role in creating active sites for methanol synthesis (§4.1.1), it is noteworthy that ZnO can be an effective support in the improvement of Cu dispersion of Cu-based catalysts. ZnO has the role of (1) stabilizing the active sites by mitigating the unavoidable agglomeration of Cu particles occurring during long-term operation, (2) providing the lattice oxygen vacancy containing an electron pair (2 e - ) that could improve the adsorption and transformation of CO2 [82], (3) facilitating the hydrogen migration between Cu and ZnO [107,108], and (4) becoming an active phase in methanol synthesis (Cu-Zn alloy and CuxZn(1-x)Oy) due to the synergy of Cu and ZnO [78,81]. An insight into Cu-ZnO-based catalysts will be given in detail in §4.1.4.1. γ-Al2O3 is extensively employed as support for commercial catalysts because of its high surface area and strong interaction with the loaded metallic species [71,90,109,110]. Kurtz et al. [90] prepared Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst by coprecipitation and stated that alumina acted as either a texture promoter or a stabilizer to hinder the thermal sintering of Cu crystalize in the Cu/ZnO catalyst. Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 exhibits a less rapid decline in activity in comparison with Al2O3-free Cu/ZnO. The thermal sintering of Cu crystallites (primary culprit for catalyst deactivation) was found to be limited in the presence of Al2O3 as structural promoter. Another study revealed that Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 prepared by deposition-precipitation can offer relatively stable CO2 conversion (18 %) and methanol selectivity (57 %) during 192 h on stream at 240 °C and 40 bar [109], due to the formation of Cu-Zn-Al layered double hydroxide structure that inhibits the agglomeration of Cu nanoparticles. Herman et al. [110] revealed that alumina acts as a structure promoter in the Cu-ZnO catalyst to create honeycomb monolithic structure with uniform axial pores and similar size of Cu-ZnO particles, thus increasing its catalytic activity. However, because of the hydrophilicity rooted from the tetrahedral site of Al, water tends to compete with methanol at the active sites on the alumina surface. Besides, alumina is likely to favor the dehydration of methanol because of its surface acidity [111]. SiO2 is another support especially used for its thermal resistance [112]. The utilization of colloidal silica was found to significantly enhance the catalytic long-term stability during 500 h operation at 250 °C and 50 bar by restraining the crystallization of Cu and ZnO in the presence of water produced in the reaction [113]. The interaction of Cu with SiO2 through the Si−OH group enables Cu species to migrate across the SiO2 surface [91]. Moreover, the higher specific surface area and abundant porosity of mesoporous silica promote the metal dispersion and diffusion [112]. A study performed by Toyir et al. [114] showed that the activity, selectivity, and stability of Cu-Ga2O3 catalyst are improved by using hydrophobic SiO2 as a support instead of ZnO because of higher surface area, pore volume, and lower Cu0 particle size of silica-supported catalyst compared to ZnO supported catalyst. However, Cu-based silica-supported materials require a supplementary basic metal oxide (e.g., Zn, Ga, Zr, etc.) as promoter to enhance their activity [114–117]. Supports with high basicity such as alkaline-earth oxides (e.g., MgO) offer better CO2 adsorption and reduce the number of acidic sites on the surface, which subsequently lower the probability of dehydration of targeted products [118,119]. MgO has a significant influence on Cu-Zn based catalysts, acting as a structural promoter and facilitating the reduction of CuO; Cu dispersion is expected to be improved, thus inhibiting the sintering [118]. In addition, MgO can improve the number and strength of moderate and strong basic sites, thus increasing the methanol selectivity because the C-containing intermediates adsorbed on strong basic sites would rather hydrogenate to further form methanol than dissociate into CO [119]. Section 4.1.4 will further discuss typical Cu-based catalysts that have been reported to present high catalyst activity and methanol selectivity. Different experiments related to Cu-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are summarized in Table 6 . 4.1.4 Typical Cu-based catalysts 4.1.4.1 Cu-ZnO-based catalysts ZnO is recognized as a typical support or/and promoter of Cu-based catalysts. Studt et al. [140] found that 5 wt% ZnO incorporated to Cu/MgO accelerated the methanol formation rate. The presence of Zn promotes the stabilization of oxygen-bound intermediates. It was observed that the coprecipitated Cu/ZnO catalyst was covered by a layer of formate species, which further hydrogenated to methanol. However, when all Zn atoms replace the Cu ones, all carbon-bound intermediates become severely destabilized. Therefore, Cu and Zn sites are both considered crucial in methanol synthesis. In another work, Robert et al. [141] revealed that because hydrogen is dissociated on the surface of Cu and then migrates to ZnO, hydroxyl species formed at the Cu-ZnO interface can eventually contribute to the formation of Cu methanoates. However, the adsorption of CO2 likely eliminates the number of the oxygen vacant sites on the reduced ZnO surface, leading to a poor performance of ZnO as catalyst [141]. The reduction conditions have an important effect on the catalyst efficiency. For example, a considerable increase in the methanol formation rate was obtained for a Cu/ZnO catalyst reduced in severe conditions (10 % H2/CO, 400 °C) compared to standard conditions (2 % H2/He, 240 °C) [142]. This discrepancy can be ascribed to the more significant interaction of bulk Zn0 atoms with the Cu surface to create bulk ZnCu alloy. Furthermore, the oxygen deficiency in the ZnO component intensifies the interaction with the Cu surface and consequently bulk ZnCu alloy is formed due to the reduction of ZnO to Zn0. An improvement in Cu catalytic activity, confirmed by zinc addition, was attributed to the migration of Zn atoms into the Cu surface [143]. Because the surface of Zn atoms has fewer nearest neighbors compared to their bulk counterparts and the energy of the Cu-Zn bond is lower compared to Cu-Cu, Zn is likely to separate from the surface of Cu. Fig. 8 illustrates the performance of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts at different Zn coverages controlled by conducting the catalyst reduction under H2 at different pressures and temperatures. The relative methanol mole fraction is given by the ratio of the measured methanol mole fraction after H2 reduction in specific conditions to that obtained after the reduction in 1 % H2. A strong relationship can be seen between methanol concentration and Zn coverage, confirmed by an intensification of catalytic activity when the Zn coverage increases from 0.04 to 0.47. However, higher Zn coverage favors the abundance of bulk Zn and the establishment of a Zn-Zn bond at the Cu surface. Besides, as Zn is partially oxidized by the oxygenated intermediates adsorbed on the Cu surface, the Zn stability and hence the Zn coverage at the Cu surface could be affected. Thus, the optimization of Zn coverage on the Cu surface can be considered an effective method to optimize the activity of a Cu-ZnO-based methanol catalyst. The statements related to methanol formation on different Cu facets of Cu/ZnO catalysts are still controversial. Palomino et al. [144] showed that at 277 °C and 5 bar (H2/CO2 = 9), methanol turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the deposited ZnO on Cu(100) and Cu(111) are the highest at 0.29·1015 and 0.16·1015 molecules cm−2 s−1, respectively, corresponding to 15–20 % ZnO coverage on copper. The authors assumed that only a mono or bi-layer structure of ZnO was created on top of the Cu substrate at these low coverages. It can be inferred that the performance of the ZnO-Cu interface, which plays an important role in methanol synthesis, is significantly affected by the structure of Cu on both facets (100) and (111), and the mono or bi-layer structures of ZnO on top of the Cu substrates [144]. The Arrhenius plot showed the highest activation energy for methanol synthesis on the Cu(111) (Ea = 25 ± 3 kcal/mol) and decreases to 16 ± 2 kcal/mol on ZnO/Cu(111). The same trend was observed on Cu(100) and ZnO/Cu(100) catalysts, the order of the activation energy being Cu(111) < Cu(100) < ZnO/Cu(111) < ZnO/Cu(100). Subsequently, the rate of methanol formation on ZnO/Cu(100) is 15–45 times higher than that on Cu(100). By conducting the O 1s and C 1s XPS spectra of CuOx/Cu(111) and ZnO/CuOx/Cu(111), it was clearly observed that the presence of the adsorbed formate (an intermediate for CO2 hydrogenation into methanol) is recorded on the latter, but not on the former. This can be ascribed to the essential role of the ZnO-Cu interface in accelerating the formation and binding of formate species [144]. However, Kattel et al. [145] observed that the methanol turnover frequency of Cu(110) is five times higher than that of Cu(111), indicating the higher activity of Cu(110) compared to Cu(111). The catalytic activity is increased when Zn is deposited on the Cu substrates, reaching a maximum value at 20 % ZnO coverage, in agreement with the findings by Palomino et al. [144]. We can therefore infer the necessity to optimize the ZnO-Cu interface to promote methanol synthesis. In addition, the number of methanol molecules produced was found to be significantly higher in ZnO/Cu(111) compared to Cu/ZnO(000i), confirming that the formation of methanol on ZnO does not appear until the deposition of Cu. Behrens et al. drew another conclusion about the formation of methanol on different Cu facets in a Cu-ZnO-based catalyst [146]. The authors prepared a series of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (high Cu loading) catalysts with compositions similar to the industrial Cu/ZnO-based materials (molar ratio of Cu:Zn = 70:30) and evaluated them at 60 bar and 210 °C. The activity was found to decrease following the order of CuZn(211) > Cu(211) > Cu(111), the active sites being related to the planar defect and the confined crystallization of Cu particles in strong interfacial contact with the ZnO component. The researchers confirmed that the intermediates are weakly bound to the flat Cu(111) surface, which contains no defect, while the bonds are stronger in the stepped Cu(211) surface. Nevertheless, the adsorption energies of intermediates and transition-states are stabilized considerably for the Cu(211) surface compared with Cu(111) [146]. This is attributed to the formation of the CuZn alloy when Cu is partially substituted by Zn on the Cu(211) facet. The XPS results showed that the ratio of Cu:Zn decreased in the presence of H2, indicating a strong metal support interaction between Cu and ZnO and a strong ZnOx coverage over the Cu surface under reduction conditions [146]. Furthermore, Nakamura et al. [147] revealed that ZnO deposited on Cu(111) and poly-Cu promote methanol synthesis. The TOF for methanol formation over the Cu surface of Zn/Cu(111) was found to be proportional to the Zn coverage, reaching a maximum at 0.19 coverage. This optimum TOF is 13 times higher than that of Zn-free Cu(111). However, this acceleration was not detected on Zn/Cu(110) and Zn/Cu(100). This behavior was ascribed to the important role of the local structure of the Zn surface on methanol formation and the presence of active sites created by ZnOx moieties partially covering Cu(111) particles. 4.1.4.2 Cu-CeO2-based catalysts Oxides with high redox ability and oxygen mobility have been widely studied in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. As a basic and weak hydrophilic oxide, CeO2 is a promising candidate for incorporation into Cu catalysts. There are several advantages of adding Ce into Cu-based catalysts: (i) hydrogen spillover on metal oxides is accelerated (this facilitates the hydrogenation reaction taking place at the interface between Cu and metal oxides), (ii) the basicity which favors the adsorption of acidic CO2 increases, in turn enhancing the catalytic activity and CO2 conversion, and (iii) the adsorption of oxygen species and the activation of CO2 can be enhanced as a consequence of oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface due to the transformation between Ce4+ and Ce3+ [126,127,130]. Additionally, the stable solid solution formed from CeO2 and CuO was reported to enhance both catalytic activity and thermal stability of CuO-based catalysts [15]. Hu et al. [126] reported that the CuZnCeOx catalyst revealed a higher activity and selectivity to methanol compared to the material without CeO2, owing to the enhancement of Cu dispersion and hydrogen spillover, which favor the hydrogenation reaction occurring at the interface between Cu, ZnO, and CeOx. TPD-H2 analysis confirmed that adding Ce to copper-based catalysts increased the amount of hydrogen adsorbed to the metallic Cu surface and the spillover of atomic hydrogen onto metal oxide. We can deduce that the addition of CeO2 accelerates the strong adsorption of hydrogen and improves the spillover of atomic hydrogen on the metal oxides [126]. In addition, CeOx offers a strong adsorption of CO2 due to the strong basicity and oxygen vacancies. Thus, CuZnCeOx exhibits higher catalyst activity than CuZnOx and CuCeOx. The increase in methanol space time yield (STY) is associated with the increase in Ce content. However, when Ce exceeds 35 %, the STY decreases due to the agglomeration of CeOx particles, leading to a decline in the number of active sites. The interaction of CuO with CeO2 also depends on the support morphology. By using 5 %Cu/CeO2 catalysts with different CeO2 morphologies of nanorods, nanocubes, and nanoparticles (synthesized by a controlled hydrolysis method), Ouyang et al. [125] demonstrated that Cu can effectively enhance the surface reduction of CeO2. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR-H2) profiles revealed that the CeO2 nanoparticles present the highest reduction temperature among all mentioned supports. Cu supported on a CeO2 nanorod showed the highest CuO dispersion and surface oxygen content, indicating a strong interaction of CuO and support. This catalyst achieved the highest CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity despite the smallest surface area. It is well-known that the transformation of Ce4+ to Ce3+ creates a deficiency in oxygen species, resulting in a chemisorption of oxygen-containing species on oxygen vacant sites. Graciani et al. [148] found that the rate of methanol formation for CeOx/Cu is 200 times and 14 times faster compared to Cu(111) and Cu/ZnO(100i), respectively. In addition, the formation of oxygen vacancies is facilitated when Ce4+ nanoparticles are in contact with Cu(111). Due to the addition of CeOx to Cu(111), a new reaction pathway is created via the adsorption and activation of CO2 at the metal-oxide interface. It means that from 27 to 227 °C, CO2 does not adsorb on Cu(111) but on the CeO2(111) surface to produce carbonate species ( C O 3 2 - ), which are reported to be more efficient as intermediates of methanol in CO2 hydrogenation due to their lower stability compared to the formate (HCOO−) species, which possess high stability. These findings are consistent with the results reported by Rodrigue et al. [149]. The authors found that the catalytic activity of CeOx/Cu(111) and Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) is 2−3 orders of magnitude higher than that of Cu(111). They therefore suggested that Ce2O3/Cu(111) is an active phase of the catalyst. Also, the rate of CH3OH formation on Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) is approximately 1280 and 87 times faster compared to Cu(111) and Cu/ZnO(0001−) counterparts, respectively. This can be ascribed to the abundant amount of Ce3+ in the Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) catalyst, which is essential for the binding and activation of CO2. Later, Senanayake et al. [150] revealed that the catalytic performance followed the order Cu(111) < ZnO/Cu(111) < CeOx/Cu(111), which is consistent with the decline in their apparent activation energies for CO2 conversion to methanol, as presented in Fig. 9 A. Formation of both formates (HCOO−) and carboxylates ( C O 2 δ- ) occurs during the reaction. However, only formates are detected when the plain Cu(111) is in the presence of a mixture CO2/H2. Meanwhile, the carboxylate species are created on the surface only after the formation of the CeO2-Cu interface. The presence of Ce3+ is effective to stabilize the CO 2 δ − species, which are essential intermediates to form methanol. Thus, it is important to understand that the catalytic activity of CeOx/Cu(111) catalyst decreases with the decline of Ce3+ percentage. When the coverage fraction of CeOx over Cu(111) increases, the defects vanish on the oxide film and the effect of oxide-metal interaction becomes less significant, making the transformation of Ce4+ to Ce3+ more difficult. The authors concluded that the maximum catalytic activity (aligned with the maximum amount of adsorbed CO 2 δ − species) could be obtained for CeOx/Cu(111) when the Cu(111) surface was 30–40 % covered by CeOx (Fig. 9B). A comparison of catalyst activity for Cu/CeO2 and Ce2O3/Cu or ZnO/Cu(111) and Cu/ZnO (Fig. 9C) indicates that the oxide/metal configurations offer better activity. One can deduce that a stronger metal-oxide interaction can be obtained by the deposition of nanoparticles of an oxide on a metal, compared to the deposition of the metal on a bulk oxide [150]. Recently, Wang et al. [129] reported that the ratio of Ce3+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+)) in CuZrCe was higher compared to the Cu-free catalysts, indicating that the presence of Cu enhances the formation of Ce3+ from Ce4+. The CO2 adsorption profiles showed that the Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution also adsorbs CO2 and shows catalytic activity. The in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) results proved that methanol is more effectively created by the hydrogenation of monodentate formate (m−HCOO*) than bidentate formate (bi−HCOO*). 4.1.4.3 Cu-ZrO2-based catalysts To avoid the adsorption of water by the hydrophilic alumina, the use of less hydrophilic compounds (such as ZrO2) as support materials for methanol synthesis has been proposed. ZrO2 is a promising catalyst support due to its strong and thermal resistance, as well as its high stability in oxidation and reduction media [29]. Amenomiya et al. [151] revealed that CuO (40 wt%) supported on ZrO2 prepared by coprecipitation offered the highest catalyst activity and methanol selectivity among the different supports investigated (ZrO2, ZnO, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3). They suggested that ZrO2 can act as a textural promoter to enhance Cu dispersion, which contributes to the accelerated methanol selectivity. ZrO2 can also be incorporated to a Cu catalyst as a texture promoter so that the microstructure and porosity of Cu can be modified (e.g., surface area, pore size distribution, and the reducibility of active sites) [152]. The appropriate addition of Zr (1 wt%) to the Cu-FeO catalyst was shown to lower the reduction temperature of the dispersed CuO on Cu, which contributed to the prevention of CuO crystal grain formation and the acceleration of Cu exposed on the catalytic surface. However, a higher Zr loading can lead to a decline in the specific surface area, thus decreasing the CO2 conversion. In addition, the formation of Cu-ZrOx species (recognized as active sites in methanol synthesis) can be facilitated by using the surfactant-assisted coprecipitation method instead of conventional coprecipitation [132]. The introduction of different types of ZrO2 structures, which also contribute to the formation of oxygen vacancy in catalysts, has been proposed due to the presence of a higher concentration of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Cu/monoclinic-ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) compared to Cu/tetragonal-ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) [153]. CO2 adsorption ability and methanol selectivity of the former catalyst were shown to be higher than that of the latter. This discrepancy is subject to the higher Lewis basicity/acidity of Zr4+/O2− pairs present on the surface of m-ZrO2 [154]. The same conclusion was drawn by K.T. Jung et al. [154] who revealed that the methanol formation rate over Cu/m-ZrO2 is approximately 5 times higher than that of Cu/t-ZrO2 containing the same concentration of Cu. They explained that the surface concentration of intermediates (formate and methoxide species) and the dynamic of atomic hydrogen spillover from Cu to ZrO2 are higher on Cu/m-ZrO2 than on Cu/t-ZrO2. However, other studies reported that Cu-ZrO2-based catalysts prepared with t-ZrO2 performed superior catalytic activity and methanol selectivity in comparison with its counterpart. For example, Samson et al. [155] showed that the catalytic activity and methanol selectivity increase with the elevation of the t-ZrO2 content, indicating that Cu/t-ZrO2 is more active than Cu/m-ZrO2 (Fig. 10 A). In their work, Cu/t-ZrO2 was prepared by the sol-gel method using citric acid as a complexing agent, and coprecipitation or incipient wetness impregnation of CuO on separated t- and m-ZrO2 were employed to produce a Cu/t-ZrO2 and Cu/m-ZrO2 mixture. The authors explained that the strong interactions between the highly dispersed active CuO component and the t-ZrO2 support facilitated the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+/Cu0 and the presence of strong and abundant Lewis acidic sites. The RT-IR analysis (Fig. 10B) revealed that the Brønsted acid sites, created by the adsorption and dissociation of water on the oxygen vacant sites, occur only in the t-ZrO2. Also, the Lewis acidity was found to be higher in t-ZrO2 compared to m-ZrO2. A linear dependency between methanol formation and the concentration of acidic sites (both Brønsted and Lewis) (Fig. 10C) confirms the higher CO2 conversion and methanol formation over Cu/t-ZrO2 in comparison to Cu/m-ZrO2. Wang et al. [156] prepared a series of Cu/ZrO2 catalysts by coprecipitation at different calcination temperatures to demonstrate that the increase in calcination temperature creates a movement of t-ZrO2 peak to lower angle, indicating an immersion of Cu2+/Cu0 into ZrO2 at low temperature and a phase separation of Cu2+/Cu0 together with ZrO2 phase transformation when the temperature increases from 550 to 650 °C. The in-situ DRIFT spectra of CO2 adsorption showed that the gradual increase of carbonate species with the increase in calcination temperature can be linked to the higher oxygen vacancy concentration. However, the growing concentrations of oxygen vacancy for samples calcined at higher temperature does not influence their catalytic activity. On the other hand, the hydrogen adsorbed on Cu sites can dissociate into hydrogen atoms and migrate to ZrO2 through spillover effect. The in-situ DRIFT spectra of pyridine adsorption revealed that more H+ were present in the sample calcined at 450 °C, which is aligned with its highest catalytic performance. This behavior suggests that the interaction between Cu and ZrO2 and the hydrogen spillover play an important role in the catalytic activity. In contrast, Cu/amorphous-ZrO2 (a-ZrO2) was reported to show excellent catalyst activity in other investigations. For example, Tada et al. [157] revealed that the turnover frequency of methanol formation on Cu/a-ZrO2 samples with Cu loading above 8 wt% is lower compared to the catalyst containing less than 8 wt%. Indeed, for catalysts with Cu loading below 8 wt%, only the amorphous CuaZr1‑aOb can be reduced to Cu nanoparticles (<5 nm) on the surface of a-ZrO2. For higher Cu loading (>8 wt%), the formation of Cu − Zr mixed oxide (CuaZr1‑aOb) and CuO crystallites occurs due to the solubility limit of Cu in the a-ZrO2 structure. The authors confirmed that the samples calcined at 350 °C exhibit higher methanol selectivity than those calcined at 500 °C. t-ZrO2 is formed in the sample calcined at 500 °C, CuaZr1‑aOb is in crystallite phase, and a fraction of Cu species remains in the ZrO2 structure. The active sites are therefore mainly located on the Cu-ZrO2 interface and part of Cu species, while the crystallite CuaZr1‑aOb and t-ZrO2 are unchanged after reduction at 300 °C. In contrast, at 350 °C all Cu species are reduced to metallic Cu. This is confirmed by the similarity between the Cu K-edge XANES spectra of reduced catalyst and Cu foil. Similarly, Witoon et al. [158] stated that the yield of methanol decreases in the order Cu/a-ZrO2 > Cu/t-ZrO2 > Cu/m-ZrO2. This is attributed to (i) the good dispersion and smaller particle sizes of CuO species on t-ZrO2 and a-ZrO2 (confirmed by XRD and TEM), (ii) the strong interaction of Cu and t- and a-ZrO2 support (proved by the change in the geometric coordination of Cu sites from square-planar to ZrO2 structure through the movements of adsorption edge in the XANES spectra of Cu/t-ZrO2 and Cu/a-ZrO2), as well as (iii) the higher amount of desorbed hydrogen from the ZrO2 sites of Cu/t-ZrO2 and Cu/a-ZrO2 in comparison with Cu/m-ZrO2. However, in recent experiments, the oxygen vacancies of ZrO2 were reported to have no influence on the catalyst activity and methanol selectivity [100]. Instead, the presence of Lewis acidic Zr4+ sites at the boundary of metal-oxide is necessary to increase the methanol selectivity. A sharp decrease in methanol formation rate with long contact time could be due to the inhibition of methanol synthesis by reaction products (e.g., water and/or methanol which are basic and strongly bind zirconia), suggesting that the Lewis acidic zirconium atoms are one of the active sites. In-situ DRIFTS results reveal that the copper/zirconia interface is responsible for the formation of formate species (adsorbed on the Lewis centers at the metal-oxide boundary), which could further convert into methoxy and finally methanol [101]. Similarly, the decrease in CH3OH formation rate linked to the drop of Zr content in Cu/Zr0.4@SiO2 indicates the significant role of Zr surface density on methanol formation. Methanol formation rate was found to decrease after 1 h on stream, which could be ascribed to the coverage of Lewis acidic Zr sites by the hydrogenation products (CH3OH and H2O) [100]. By in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the authors pointed out that the oxidation state of the isolated Zr4+ did not change under reduction or reaction conditions, confirming that Zr4+ is the actual species responsible for the catalyst activity and methanol selectivity. Kim et al. [102] confirmed that the surface Lewis acidic sites regulate the stability of reaction intermediates and the energy barrier of the reaction. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for methanol formation is linearly inverse to the relative Lewis acidity of coordinatively unsaturated metal surface sites exposed on the oxide support, while there is no correlation between Ea and Cu nanoparticle size. The destabilization of bidentate formate species on oxide surface centers with increasing electron-accepting character contributes to the decrease of Ea, therefore leading the reaction pathway to methanol formation. 4.1.4.4 Cu-based catalysts containing other metal oxides Since the dispersion of Cu active sites has a strong effect on methanol synthesis, producing highly dispersed copper particles with strong metal-support interaction deserves more investigation. The utilization of mixed metal oxides M1M2Ox (mixed oxides spinel and mixed oxides perovskite) has increasingly gained interest in the recent years, mainly by virtue of their superior performance in long-term thermal stability, remarkably high copper dispersion, and reducibility [138,139,159]. For example, Mierczynski et al. [160] reported that 20 wt% Cu promoted over ZnAl2O4 (Zn/Al = 0.5) spinel-type support achieved the highest methanol yield among different tested catalysts (molar ratio Zn/Al = 0.5, 1, and 2), due to the highest specific surface area of the support. CuAl2O4 is another typical copper spinel that has shown improvement in the thermal stability of Cu [159]. Among the mixed metal oxides, copper ferrite spinel was found to exhibit superior dispersion of Cu particles and high thermal stability of the catalyst in steam reforming [161–163] and water gas shift reaction [164,165]. A lot of attention has been paid to the perovskite-type structure A2BO4. The perovskite La2CuO4, which proved high activity for methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation, is a salient example [139]. Significant advantages of perovskites in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol can be demonstrated [139]. First, since metallic Cu is easily subjected to agglomeration (by high temperature sintering), the Cu anchoring Cu at the B sites of perovskite structure provides a high dispersion of Cu after reduction. Second, the highly stable thermodynamic property of CO2 can be suppressed by adjusting the alkalinity of perovskite to provide appropriate sites for CO2 activation. In this context, Li et al. [139] investigated a series of La-Mn-Cu-O perovskite samples (La-Mn0.4-Cux-Zn0.6-x-O, x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) and reported a high dispersion of both Cu+ and Cu0 after reduction. The reducibility of Cu species increased by the addition of Zn and the LaMn0.4Cu0.5Zn0.1 catalyst offered the highest CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, which is consistent with its highest Cu dispersion and surface area. These findings are in agreement with those by Zhan et al. [138], who investigated the efficiency of a series of La-M-Cu-Zn-O (M = Ce, Mg, Zr) based perovskite-type catalysts with highly dispersed Cu species. The formation and stabilization of Cu species with specific valence (Cuα+, α ≠ 0, +1, +2), confirmed by XPS spectra, can be effectively achieved thanks to a strong physical and electric interaction between copper and other metal oxides (Ce, Mg, and Zr). All perovskite-containing catalysts exhibit high selectivity toward methanol, which is associated with the Cuα+ species found in the reduced samples. Among them, La0.8Zr0.2Cu0.7Zn0.3Ox showed the highest CO2 conversion and methanol yield due to the largest Cu surface area and dispersion."
11,Pd-based catalysts,"4.2 Pd-based catalysts Pd-based materials are very powerful catalysts in comparison with the conventional Cu-based ones, by virtue of their long-term stability and sintering resistance [166,167]. Remarkably, Pd facilitates the hydrogen spill-over and exhibits excellent adsorption and dissociation, therefore providing the atomic hydrogen for CO2 hydrogenation [168,169]. Different supports (e.g., CeO2 [170–174], In2O3 [175–177], ZnO [178,179], Ga2O3 [180–182], and SiO2 [169,183]) have been investigated to increase the catalyst activity. A summary of representative Pd-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is given in Table 7 . As oxygen vacancies have been shown to promote adsorption and activation of CO2, CeO2 (as a source of oxygen vacant sites) was employed as a support for Pd-based catalysts [185–188]. Choi et al. [172] reported that among the 0.5–2 wt% Pd catalysts investigated, the highest concentration of Ce3+/Ce4+ generating oxygen vacancies was confirmed for the 1 wt% Pd material, which led to the highest CO2 conversion and methanol yield. Another investigation revealed that a new phase (Ce2O3) was found in the Pd/CeO2 catalyst reduced at 500 °C, but not at lower temperature (300 °C), which could explain the higher methanol selectivity at 500 °C [170]. CO2 adsorbed at the interface between Pd and the reduced Ce2O3 surface interacts with the dissociative hydrogen through spillover from Pd to form CO, which subsequently hydrogenates to methanol. These findings are however inconsistent with the results reported by Matsumara et al. [187], who found that the Pd/CeO2 catalyst reduced at 300 °C offers a higher methanol selectivity than its counterpart at 500 °C. This decrease in the catalytic activity was attributed to the reduction of Pd surface area and the increase in particle size at higher temperature. Malik et al. investigated the application of Ca promoted Pd-Zn/CeO2 catalyst [171] and revealed that the ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ corresponding to the oxygen vacancies on the surface of CeO2 was boosted in the presence of Ca and Zn. Consequently, methanol formation rates were promoted in the order CaPdZn/CeO2 > PdZn/CeO2 > Pd/CeO2. Additionally, CO2-TPD analysis indicated that strong basic sites were created on CeO2 by the addition of PdZn alloy and Ca. A mechanism proposed by the authors considered that the CO2 adsorbed on the oxygen vacant center in CeO2 was hydrogenated by the atomic H adsorbed on PdZn alloy to create carbonaceous species and finally methanol. The use of In2O3 as support is justified by the presence of oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation to methanol [176,189]. Rui et al. [175] reported that the interfacial sites between Pd and In2O3 were considered as active sites in methanol formation. They found that the presence of Pd provides the atomic adsorbed hydrogen and the creation of oxygen vacancies. As a result, the methanol yield was found to be proportional to the concentration of vacant oxygen and interfacial sites. However, the formation of Pd-In alloy has a negative effect on methanol synthesis due to the drop in the number of interfacial sites. This finding is consistent with the results by Ye et al. [177] who also investigated the role of the interfacial sites in methanol synthesis by DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculation, in order to understand the reaction mechanism. Due to the strong synergy between metallic Pd and ZnO at high temperature, the formation of Pd-Zn alloy can exert effective catalytic activity. The presence of metallic Pd in PdZn/SiC increases the CO formation rate, while the selective formation of methanol over PdCuZn/SiC is due to the formation of PdZn alloy [190]. More interestingly, the addition of Cu leads to the formation of PdCu alloy, which prevents the creation of Pd0. This in turn inhibits the CO formation and promotes methanol synthesis. In addition, the synergistic effect of Pd, Cu, and Zn in the trimetallic catalyst creates a higher dispersion of PdZn compared to the bimetallic one [190]. Xu et al. [184] came to the same conclusion in a study on a Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by three different methods (deposition-precipitation, coprecipitation, and impregnation). Higher methanol selectivity was obtained with the catalyst synthesized by coprecipitation, which was attributed to the homogeneous distribution of Pd and Zn that facilitates the formation and dispersion of PdZn alloy. Furthermore, the ratio of PdZn to Pd0 proportionally affects the selectivity to methanol and is favored by the increase in the reduction temperature. It was also noticed that an increase in the reduction temperature (from 300 to 500 °C) has a negative effect on CO2 conversion due to the formation of larger PdZn crystallites at higher temperature. In contrast, methanol selectivity is promoted at higher reduction temperatures. By analyzing the Fourier transforms of the Pd k3-weighted EXAFS XAS spectra, it was assumed that the catalyst reduction at 500 °C was accompanied by a complete transformation of Pd0 into PdZn alloy, which led to an increase in methanol selectivity. During reduction at 300 °C, a third of the Pd atoms are found in the form of PdZn alloy and the remaining atoms are in the metallic state. Song et al. [179] also confirmed the presence of PdZn alloy as an active site in methanol synthesis. Fig. 11 illustrates that both CO2 conversion and methanol yield are highest for the Al promoted Pd/ZnO catalyst containing 3.93 wt.% Al, while higher Al loadings have a negative effect. Al addition creates a strong interaction between Pd and ZnO, which was confirmed by a shift of the peak position to the higher reduction temperature of PdZn alloy. For Al loadings up to 3.93 %, the concentration of Al doped in the ZnO lattice was also found to augment, which has a positive effect on methanol formation. However, for larger Al loadings, Al concentration remains almost unchanged, while ZnAl2O4 and amorphous Al2O3 are formed and inhibit the formation of methanol [179]. Bimetallic Pd-Cu catalysts have also been reported to boost the methanol synthesis. For example, Jiang et al. [183,191] synthesized bimetallic Pd-Cu coimpregnated on amorphous SiO2 and showed that for a Pd/(Pd + Cu) atomic ratio varying from 0.25 to 0.34, the methanol formation rate exceeded by far (twice) the sum of the rates obtained over the monometallic catalysts. Among the tested bimetallic catalysts, the highest methanol formation rate was reached for Pd(0.34)-Cu/SiO2 (Pd/(Pd + Cu) atomic ratio of 0.34), with good stability for 100 h on stream. This behavior was attributed to the presence of both CuPd and CuPd3 alloy phases in the reduced bimetallic Pd(0.34)-Cu/SiO2 catalyst (proved by TEM). These phases were created through strong synergy between Cu and Pd, which was affected by the difference in atomic ratio of Pd/(Pd + Cu). A DFT study of the reaction mechanism of the CuPd bimetallic catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation demonstrated that the presence of Pd on the surface of Cu(111) promoted the adsorption of reactants and lowered the reaction barrier to facilitate the transformation of intermediate species into methanol [192,193]. As a result, the formation of CO and CH4 is suppressed on PdCu(111) surface. A 2.5 times higher methanol yield can be obtained for 1% Pd promoted Cu-ZnO catalyst compared to the unpromoted one [192]. This was attributed to the strong interaction between Pd and Cu which allows the hydrogen to migrate from Pd to Cu through a spillover effect. As a result, more Cu sites become active sites for methanol synthesis in the presence of ZnO. The application of Pd/β-Ga2O3 catalysts with high activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was first investigated by Fujitani et al. [120,194]. The methanol turnover frequency of Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be seven times higher than the conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. Later, Collins et al. [195,196] reported a methanol formation rate 130 times higher for 1 % Pd/β-Ga2O3 compared to Pd/SiO2. The presence of Pd facilitates the reduction of Ga2O3 to Gaδ+ (δ < 2), which forms Gaδ+ - H at lower temperature thanks to the hydrogen spillover. The incorporation of Pd to β-Ga2O3 also promotes the formation of formate species. Specifically, a polydentate carbonate is first formed on the surface of Ga2O3 and reacts with atomic hydrogen adsorbed on the Pd site, followed by its migration to the Ga2O3 surface through hydrogen spillover to create bidentate and monodentate formate species that are further hydrogenated to methoxy group and methanol. Collins et al. [182] found that bimetallic Pd-Ga prepared by incipient wetness impregnation can be formed after hydrogen reduction above 250 °C and proposed a mechanism by which atomic hydrogen adsorbed on Pd0 and Pd-Ga bimetallic is first spilled onto the support. Following the hydrogenation of the (bi)carbonates (issued by CO2 adsorption on the surface sites of Ga2O3), different intermediates (formates, methylenebisoxy, and methoxy species) are formed and finally produce methanol. Besides, the bimetallic Pd-Ga catalyst was found to exhibit low activity against the decomposition of methanol to CO, thus enhancing the methanol selectivity [182]. Moreover, the reduction of Ga2O3 through Pd addition can be associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies, which further facilitate the CO2 adsorption [181]."
12,Bimetallic catalysts,"4.3 Bimetallic catalysts In addition to Cu- and Pd-based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts combining other metals (excluding Cu and Pd) have also been investigated due to the increased activity for methanol synthesis (Table 8 ). For example, In2O3/ZrO2 showed superior methanol selectivity in comparison with Cu- and Pd-based catalysts, ascribed to the strong adsorption energy of CO2 to the surface site of ZrO2, the oxygen vacancies created on the In2O3, and a considerable concentration of atomic oxygen in the vicinity of vacancies for the In2O3/ZrO2 [197–199]. In2O3 has a special characteristic of creating and annihilating the oxygen vacancies. Through the reduction of In2O3(110), H2 helps create a defective surface with oxygen vacancies, which is further filled by one of the atomic oxygens from the adsorbed CO2. This step is followed by the subsequent hydrogenation on the oxygen defective surface of In2O3(110) to form H3CO and H2COH intermediates, and finally produce methanol [198]. Meanwhile, the methanol formation helps re-create the oxygen vacancy sites on the surface [198]. Frei et al. revealed that oxygen vacancies surrounded by three In atoms enable the chemisorption of CO2 and dissociate hydrogen heterolytically, stabilizing the polarized Hδ+−H δ − species formed during the reaction [200]. It was found that an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies (highly active for the adsorption and activation of CO2) is generated by doping In over the ZrO2 carrier. Indeed, among various supports (ZrO2, TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, Al2O3, C, SnO2 and MgO), 9 % In supported ZrO2 catalyst showed 100 % MeOH selectivity and incredible stability up to 1000 h on stream at 300 °C, 50 bar and H2:CO2 = 4:1 [201]. This high catalyst stability was attributed to the higher dispersion and excellent resistance to thermal sintering of In, as well as the electronic interactions of In with ZrO2 (8 % activity lost after 400 h on stream in comparison with 44 % after 100 h for the conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3). To shed light on the influence of structure on catalyst activity and establish the structure-performance relationship for In2O3-based methanol synthesis catalysts, the evolution of the catalyst structure during the reaction has been evaluated. Tsoukalou et al. [202] used the operando XAS-XRD and in-situ TEM technique and found that the reduction of In2O3 is associated with the formation of oxygen vacancy Vo sites, leading to the formation of the active In2O3-x phase, while the deactivation coincides with the over-reduction to metallic In. The investigation of three distinct catalytic stages (activation, stable performance, and deactivation) showed that the catalyst transforms from In2O3-x (50−40% of In2O3 and 50–60 % of In2O3-x) in the most active stage to In0/In2O3-x (68 % In0 and 32 % In2O3-x) in the deactivation stage. In2O3 (with In oxidation state between +2 and +3) was found to offer the highest catalytic activity, while the formation of In0 was subjected to catalyst deactivation. The over-reduction of In2O3 resulted in a lower methanol yield, attributed to the coverage of Vo active sites. These findings related to the tuning reduction degree to obtain maximum methanol formation match with the latest publication by Cao et al., who performed DFT calculation and microkinetics modelling to analyze the surface structure of In2O3, the formation energies of oxygen vacancies, and the stability of In2O3 surface with the varying oxygen vacancy concentrations under the reaction conditions [203]. The authors found that moderate oxygen vacancies are sufficient to obtain the maximum methanol formation rate, because a large energy barrier for the hydrogenation of HCOO* (reaction intermediate) resulted in a surface with few oxygen vacancies, whereas weak oxygen binding occurs on a surface with too many oxygen vacancies, which leads to unfavorable activation and hydrogenation of CO2. Therefore, the methanol synthesis over the In2O3 catalyst can be optimized by regulating the number of oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surface. Concerning In2O3/ZrO2, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is higher compared to In2O3 and the reduction of In2O3 is inhibited by the presence of ZrO2, suggesting that the addition of ZrO2 can regulate the number of surface oxygen vacancies and thereby optimize the methanol formation. As an oxide with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies, Ga2O3 becomes a potential candidate for the activation of CO2. Owing to the strong binding energy of adsorptive H2 and CO2 on the catalyst surface (confirmed by the movement of desorption temperature of CO2 and H2 at low temperatures toward higher temperatures), Ga0.4In1.6O3 achieved the highest methanol yield among possible GaxIn2-xO3 catalysts at 340−360 °C [204]. However, a higher Ga loading (x = 0.4−0.9) results in both lower yield of MeOH and higher yield of CH4, which could be related to the increase in the content of oxygen vacancies and a cleavage of the CO bonding in HxCO to form CH4 rather than its hydrogenation to CH3OH. In addition, the CO formation (determined by the surface chemisorbed oxygen) is significantly inhibited by the implementation of Ga2O3 into the In2O3 support, because the redox reaction of CO2 to CO on the surface is reduced [204]. Ni5Ga3 bimetallic is also confirmed as an active site for methanol synthesis [205,209–212]. Sharafutdinov et al. [205,209] reported that among the NiaGab/SiO2 catalysts, the highest methanol formation was observed using Ni5Ga3/SiO2, compared to the traditional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. Besides, as Ni is known to be active in the methanation reaction and the methane yield is increased with the increase in Ni content, the authors suggested that only the NiGa interface is active for methanol production [205,209]. According to Frost [213], the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, modified by the surrounding deposited metal particles through the formation of a Schottky junction, plays a vital role in the catalytic activity. It is therefore expected that Au also provides catalytic activity in methanol synthesis due to the cooperative effect between Cu and Au at the Cu-Au interface. Pasupulety et al. [206] found that doping the CuZnAl (4:1:1 M ratio) catalyst with 1 wt% Au exhibits the highest methanol yield among different Au-doped Cu-Zn-Al catalysts. The presence of Au lowers the reduction temperature of Cu species and increases the (Cu0 + Cu+)/Cu2+ ratio. This behavior is attributed to the ease of reduction of CuO particles in the vicinity of Au through hydrogen spillover and the Au loading that defines the Cu - Au interface. It is worth mentioning that only 10 % CO selectivity was obtained over the 1 wt.% Au catalyst in comparison with 50 % over the undoped catalyst. Higher CO adsorption and subsequent WGS reaction or hydrogenation of CO to methanol could be the reason for the low CO selectivity of the Au doped catalyst. A few studies found a significantly higher methanol selectivity over Au/ZnO (>50 %) compared to other Au-based catalysts like Au/TiO2, Au/ZrO2, Au/Al2O3, and Au/Fe2O3 [207,208,214,215]. This discrepancy is ascribed to the interaction of CO2 with the metal oxide supports. Catalysts supported over oxides with stronger acidity offer higher CO2 conversion, but lower methanol selectivity. In contrast, the use of basic carriers results in low CO2 conversion. Nevertheless, the basic supports are likely to promote the methanol selectivity through the formation of carbonate intermediates, which are further hydrogenated into formate, methoxy, and finally to methanol."
13,Bi-functional catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to DME,
14,Bi-functional catalysts,"5.1 Bi-functional catalysts DME can be directly synthesized from CO2 and H2 by using bi-functional catalysts that perform simultaneously the synthesis and dehydration of methanol. Thus, bi-functional materials hold the active site for methanol synthesis and a solid acid catalyst for methanol dehydration to DME (such as γ-Al2O3 [216–218] and zeolites (Y, H-MFI 400, HZSM-5, etc.)) [152,219–222]. γ-Al2O3 has been extensively used for methanol dehydration because of its suitable acidity, low cost, excellent life time, and high mechanical resistance [223]. However, the main pitfall of γ-Al2O3 is the affinity to water which results in its adsorption on the catalyst surface and the blockage of the active sites [222]. Therefore, solid acid materials with high resistance to water are good alternatives for γ-Al2O3. Nevertheless, catalysts with strong acidity could promote the transformation of DME to hydrocarbons because these reactions occur via the dehydrocarbon pool mechanism activated by Brønsted acid sites [224,225]. Bearing this in mind, weak and medium acidic catalysts are hence widely used in DME synthesis [219]. Y-zeolite, Na-HZSM-5, H-HZSM-5, H-Ga-silica, and SAPO-34 have been extensively used in the literature [222,226–230]. Among them, HZSM-5 zeolite exhibits high activity, water resistance, as well as long-term catalytic stability [14]. An investigation carried out by Ihm et al. [226] on a bi-functional catalyst combining Cu/ZnO/Zr2O3 and solid acid catalysts (HZSM-5, SAPO-34, H-Ga-silica) showed that the higher acidity of HZSM-5 and SAPO-34 facilitates the dehydration to hydrocarbon, while H-Ga-silica possesses sufficient acidity for oxygenate formation. Carbonaceous substances produced on account of the acidity of zeolites could also represent precursors for the coke deposition, which leads in turn to the deactivation of the catalyst [231]. Considering the by-products of DME synthesis, such as hydrocarbons and coke (due to the presence of strong/weak acidic sites), it becomes compulsory to modify the acidic properties of solid acid catalysts to obtain high DME selectivity by adding other appropriate basic metal oxides. An investigation performed by Aguayo and co-workers [232] revealed that by using a hybrid catalyst composed by CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (for methanol synthesis) and Na-HZSM5 (for methanol dehydration to DME), low coke was formed. The presence of Na+ in the solid acid catalyst helped reduce the acid strength of the site, thus limiting the hydrocarbon and coke formation. The utilization of rare earth metals (like Ce and La) is also reported to adjust the zeolites that possess high concentrations of moderate to strong acid sites [15,219]. The application of a CuO-Fe2O3-CeO2/HZSM-5 bi-functioned catalyst in DME synthesis [15] revealed that CeO2 not only enhances the acid property of the weak acid sites (amount of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites) to increase the catalytic activity for DME production, but also decreases the reduction temperature and increases the reducibility of the dispersed CuO. Besides, a stable solid solution can be formed from CuO and CeO2, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity and thermal stability of CuO [15]. Jin et al. [219] reported a higher activity and stability of La and Ce modified zeolite Y for DME synthesis in comparison with the unmodified material, which is attributed to the enhancement of the quantity of moderate acid sites in the presence of Ce and La, beneficial for the dehydration of methanol to DME. The selectivity of DME was also found to increase from 49 % to 64 % in the presence of 5 wt.% MgO modified HZSM-5 catalyst [233], on account of the elimination of strong Brønsted acid sites and the increase in Lewis acid sites. The reaction of Mg2+ with the protons of bridging hydroxyls leads to the formation of Mg(OH)+ in the presence of MgO, which in turn leads to an inhibition of hydrocarbon formation by DME dehydration. However, MgO loadings over 5 wt.% lower the DME selectivity due to a low acidity. Table 9 summarizes different bi-functional catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to DME."
15,Catalyst deactivation in DME synthesis,"5.2 Catalyst deactivation in DME synthesis In DME synthesis, the deactivation of bi-functional catalyst is related to both catalytic parts (methanol synthesis and dehydration). Metal sintering, presence of water in the reaction media, and coke formation and deposition on the active sites of metallic and acidic function sites, are the major widely recognized problems in DME catalyst deactivation [236]. As the deactivation of catalysts for methanol synthesis is outlined in §4.1.1, the following part will focus on catalyst deactivation in methanol dehydration to DME. In a study on the deactivation of the CuO-ZnO-Al2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [232], an indication of oxidation was demonstrated by TPO analysis, with a first peak at approximately 260 °C (attributed to the burning of coke located in the metallic sites or the interface between the metallic sites and the Al2O3 support) and a second one at 400 °C (corresponding to the combustion of carbonaceous species generated on the acidic sites of the catalyst). These results are close to those reported by Peláez et al. [237], who used γ-Al2O3 as a solid acid catalyst for methanol dehydration to DME and found the first peak at 180−190 °C and the second peak at approximately 340 °C. Similarly, Sierra et al. [238] point out that coke first forms and is deposited on the metallic sites, then grows on the mesopores of the Al2O3. Due to the high acidity of the zeolites used as solid acid catalysts, DME is prone to convert to hydrocarbons and carbonaceous compounds, which could further block the active sites and deactivate the catalyst. There are four different roots of zeolite deactivation: (i) poisoning of active sites by feed impurities (such as sulphur, phosphorus and chlorine species), (ii) blockage of active sites by coke deposition, (iii) structure alteration, and (iv) sintering of active metal [239]. Zhang et al. [240] evaluated the adsorption of the coke (formed through the decomposition of carbonaceous compounds) on a bi-functional catalyst composed by CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (methanol synthesis) and H-ZSM5 (methanol dehydration). The coke blocked the pores of the catalysts and subsequently reduced the surface area and pore volume. It is important to mention that the zeolite acidity and pore structure have a significant influence on coke formation. Since coke is generated at the Brønsted acid sites, increasing the strength and number of acidic sites could likely increase the possibility of coke formation on the zeolites [241]. Zeolite pore structure issues can also affect the coke generation. Since coke precursors diffuse through the pore structure of a catalyst (when the pore size allows), they can generate coke. Higher amounts of coke are likely to be formed in catalysts with larger pore size [241]. This process can be attributed to the fact that the coke species present inside the pores of the zeolites (i) are not volatile enough to be eliminated under operating conditions or (ii) have sizes larger than the size of the zeolite aperture [239]. However, Rezaei et al. [241] claimed the possibility of lower thermal coke formation on HY with a larger pore size compared to HZSM-5, which has a smaller pore size, since larger molecules can enter the catalyst through large pores and react before converting to thermal coke [241]. Unsaturated hydrocarbons produced by dehydration of methanol/DME could also be retained inside the catalyst pores [93]. At high temperatures (> 400 °C), these hydrocarbons can break down into smaller aromatics, disperse them outside the pores, and form cokes that then block the opening of the pores and deactivate the zeolites [93]. Water adsorption has also been reported to have a positive role in the formation of coke. Water can inhibit the coke formation, since there is competition for adsorption on active sites between water and coke precursors [232]. Methoxy ions, which are intermediates in methanol formation, are also intermediates in the formation of coke precursor hydrocarbons. Water adsorption tends to diminish the formation of methoxy ions, thus mitigating the formation of methanol and undesirable species (like coke, paraffin, and methane) [238]. However, an excessive amount of water in the feed can decrease the formation of DME [242]. The authors consider that the adsorption of H2 is suppressed due to the preferential adsorption of water on the catalyst surface. This is aligned with the findings by Wang et al. [243], who reported a drop in DME formation and an escalation in Cu sintering in the presence of water. Therefore, the control of water concentration in the reaction media should be considered to obtain the desirable DME formation. Regarding the zeolite structure alteration, it can be mentioned that the ion exchange of acidic H+ by Cu2+ through the migration of Cu into zeolite pores can be facilitated by water and hydroxyls (Brønsted acid sites) outside the zeolites [236]. Therefore, the preparation of bi-functional catalysts should also consider the interaction between the two catalysts [93]."
16,Sorption-enhanced process for CO2 hydrogenation reactions,"In the sorption-enhanced reaction process, the hydrogenation of CO2 and the selective in-situ separation of water occur simultaneously. The primary goal of this intensified process is to increase the overall performance of the conventional process by shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction according to the Le Châtelier principle. In fact, removing the water produced in most CO2 hydrogenation processes promotes the direct reaction, which in turn leads to an increase in the CO2 conversion into desirable products and a faster forward reaction rate. This allows the reactor to operate at much lower temperatures for the same conversion of reactants, thus also reducing the operational costs associated with heating power. Opportunities for capital savings could also arise from eliminating or significantly reducing the purchase of water separation equipment [244] or smaller equipment required for heat exchange. Furthermore, as reported by Liang et al. [245], the simultaneous presence of water and CO2 is likely to oxidize the active metals of the catalyst, leading to its premature deactivation. SERP could then help to prevent this phenomenon and extend catalyst life by continuously removing water from the reaction environment as it is produced, through cycles of adsorption and desorption (adsorbent regeneration). Nevertheless, the incorporation of adsorbents into the system also brings its share of disadvantages at the reactor design and operational levels. It is essential to be aware of the limitations of such new systems before they are implemented on an industrial scale. In terms of modelling and scaling of reactors that provide both the reaction and water separation processes, an in-depth study of the often complex interactions between these two mechanisms must be carried out in order to understand the behavior in steady state and dynamic operation within the integrated unit [246]. The operation of a process that includes the use of adsorbents must include a regeneration step that is not done instantaneously and without associated costs. In this respect, temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are the most commonly used techniques for adsorbent regeneration. Indeed, an increase in temperature or a decrease in system pressure both induce a decrease in adsorption capacity, causing desorption of the adsorbed species. Depending on the regeneration method used, the process control instruments must be robust and efficient enough to ensure that the temperature or pressure of the system is adjusted consistently between each adsorption or desorption cycle. The TSA method also requires a careful choice of regeneration temperature so as not to affect the thermal stability of the adsorbent. Although the process of water adsorption and desorption on zeolites does not present any hysteresis phenomenon [247], a modification in their structure (e.g., by subjecting them to excessively high regeneration temperatures) can lead to an undesirable decrease in their adsorption capacity from one cycle to the next. Consequently, the need for a regeneration step in SERP involves additional energy costs associated with periodic changes in operating conditions. Cyclic operation of the process does not allow for the continuous yielding of the desired product using a single reactor. The hourly output of a SERP reactor is therefore inevitably reduced compared to a conventional reactor. Having said that, this section aims to review the systems presented in the literature that incorporate solid hydrophilic materials acting as adsorbents to remove water in-situ in CO2 hydrogenation processes for CO, methanol and DME synthesis. CO, MeOH, and DME are among the most interesting products to synthesize industrially by CO2 valorization because of their multiple potential uses and economic value. The global reactions leading to these three compounds are represented by the Eq. (1), (4) and (7). As water is produced in all forward reactions, the choice of an appropriate sorbent material for its removal is a key step to ensure stability and efficiency of the enhanced system. Particularly, since these synthesis reactions occur favorably at temperatures above 250 °C, according to kinetics limitations, the chosen material should have a good adsorption capacity and selectivity at this temperature paired with acceptable kinetics. Moreover, considering the fact that the regeneration of the adsorbent is often the rate-determining step which guides the efficiency and the feasibility of the process [248], the material should offer sufficient structural stability during the cyclic adsorption/desorption steps [249]. Also, 250 °C is considered a relatively high temperature for adsorption (of water, in particular) since it is an exothermic process, which further limits the choice of a suitable material. Fig. 12 clearly indicates a shift in the reaction yield marked by a change in the slope of the curves when the remaining water partial pressure is maintained below a specific limit for each synthesis process. It can also be observed that a lower partial pressure of water is required to boost the molar fraction of MeOH and CO, while 1 bar of water vapor could already increase the yield compellingly for DME synthesis. The following sections concern the experimental and modelling attempts to investigate the sorption-enhanced synthesis of CO, MeOH, and DME."
17,Sorption-enhanced CO (SECO) synthesis,"6.1 Sorption-enhanced CO (SECO) synthesis The catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO is widely studied in the literature because it occupies a pivotal position in the conversion of CO2 [30]. Indeed, the RWGS is often considered the first step in hydrogenation processes, since CO is much more reactive than CO2 and is a flexible chemical in the synthesis of many carbon-containing products like methane and methanol. However, by overcoming the thermodynamic limitations through water removal, the intensified process becomes much more attractive for industrial applications than the conventional one. It can be seen from the equilibrium conversion curve of this endothermic reaction that less than 50 % CO2 conversion could theoretically be obtained when the reaction is performed at 800 °C; however, such a high temperature results in considerable catalyst sintering. Carvill et al. [244] were one of the first to conduct experimental work on the SECO reaction. Using a pressurized (480 kPa) reactor packed with a mixture of equal weight of commercial Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst and NaX zeolite (also called faujasite 13X or FAU-13X [250]), they showed that the application of the SERP could reach a CO2 to CO conversion of 36 % at 250 °C, which is well above the equilibrium value of only 9.8 % (maximum that could be obtained without adsorbent). Likewise, such CO2 conversion (36 %) can theoretically be obtained at 565 °C in the conventional process, which points out the advantage of the SERP in respect to the energy consumption by operating at lower temperatures in industrial scale applications. It was also demonstrated that a highly pure CO effluent could be produced at the reactor outlet during the first step of the process (reaction/adsorption step) if the desired product (CO) was used to repressurize the reactor. Such conclusions prove that a separation unit for isolating the CO could be omitted if this system was operated before reaching the saturation of the adsorbent. In Fig. 13 , the area under the curve between 0 and t1 represents the amount of CO that leaves the reactor but is associated with the quantity initially introduced into the reactor to pressurize it. On the other hand, the range between t1 and t2 illustrates the period when it is possible to obtain a high concentration of CO at the reactor outlet through the intensified reaction. However, the repressurization of the reactor with one or the other reactant (H2 or CO2) between adsorption and desorption cycles could not ensure a CO concentration higher than 80 % at the effluent. More recently, Ghodhbene et al. [249] studied the SECO process using a commercial Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of different zeolites as adsorbent materials (FAU-13X, LTA-4A, and hydroxy-sodalite (SOD)). Catalytic and adsorption testing were performed in a pressurized (5 bar) reactor at 250 °C. The results showed that the FAU-13X had the best potential in SERP. Indeed, this zeolite had the highest water adsorption capacity at the reaction temperature (0.038 against 0.022 g/g for LTA-4A and approximately 0.012 g/g for the SOD), in addition to being the one that exhibited the most significant increase in CO production compared to the equilibrium limit during the sorption-enhanced reaction (60 % against 26 % for LTA-4A and -6% for SOD). Comparing between the equilibrium adsorption isotherms for water conducted in this study [249] and in Carvill et al.’s investigation [244] (Fig. 14 ) shows that the results converge towards similar conclusions. The amount of adsorbed water, which is higher for NaX zeolites compared to LTA-4A (even for adsorption isotherms performed 25 °C higher), confirms that the latter have larger adsorption capacities at relatively high temperatures. The distinction between the performances of FAU-13X and LTA-4A could be explained by the difference in their pore size. Since LTA-4A has smaller pore diameter (3.8 Å) than FAU-13X (7.4 Å), fewer water molecules (kinetic diameter of 2.6 Å) could potentially be stored inside their structure, which could also explain their lower adsorption capacity. At first glance, wider cross-section could also mean a higher possibility for larger molecules such as CO2 (kinetic diameter of 3.3 Å) to penetrate inside and thus replace water on adsorption sites. However, several studies including those by Mfoumou et al. [251] and Joos et al. [252] have confirmed that the amount of CO2 adsorbed on 13X zeolites could decrease significantly in the presence of water, which preferentially fills the room into the zeolite structure. This can be attributed to the capacity of water to form hydrogen bonds and to strongly interact with sodium cations present in the zeolite, which is not the case for CO2. When a mixture of H2O and CO2 is found at the surface of these zeolites, H2O molecules are preferentially adsorbed, which considerably reduces the adsorption sites available for CO2 [252]. Having said that, the larger pore diameter of NaX zeolites is the main reason why they tend to adsorb more water than LTA-4A at the reaction temperature. Regarding the regeneration of the adsorbent, the repeatability of the adsorption isotherms proved the validity of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) method to restore the zeolites closer to their initial state by removing most of the adsorbed water. Another study conducted by Haije [253] on a preliminary large-scale process for RWGS, suggested the use of the heat released by an exothermic Fischer-Tropsch unit located downstream to fully regenerate the adsorbent by a temperature swing adsorption technique (TSA). In other words, the adsorbent materials could either be completely regenerated by a decrease in pressure or by an increase in temperature."
18,Sorption-enhanced methanol (SEME) and DME (SEDME) synthesis,"6.2 Sorption-enhanced methanol (SEME) and DME (SEDME) synthesis Syntheses of methanol and DME can also benefit from the various advantages brought by the sorption-enhanced process. While CO2 removal by in-situ adsorption in steam reforming processes (sorption-enhanced steam reforming) has been widely studied in the literature [6], systems dealing with in-situ H2O removal are very scarce. Modelling studies as well as experimental work carried out on SEME and SEDME intensified processes are reviewed in the following section. Iliuta et al. [254] were the first to conduct a modelling study which integrates the SE reaction process for the DME synthesis (SEDME), using 4A-type zeolite as water adsorbent. Since the DME synthesis process involves two steps, a bifunctional catalyst for both methanol synthesis and its following dehydration (Cu-ZnO-Al2O3/HZSM-5) was used in this study, along with kinetic parameters (for catalytic reaction and water adsorption) reported in the literature [255,256]. The fixed bed reactor was packed with a 50:50 (wt.%) mixture catalysts-adsorbent. The conversion of H2 and CO2, the yield and selectivity for DME, as well as the fraction of converted MeOH were found to increase significantly with the rise in the adsorption capacity, the removal of water directly favoring the reactions (4) and (6). The trends presented in Fig. 15 underline the importance of using an efficient adsorbent material to reach interesting CO2 conversion and DME selectivity in the SERP. Indeed, according to this modelling study, an adsorbent volume fraction of 0.5 could increase the CO2 conversion from 10 % to near 50 % using a H2/COx feed ratio of 1, compared to a system without adsorbent. It can also be seen that the reagent feed ratio directly influences the CO2 conversion, while the selectivity is not affected. Later, Bayat et al. modelled the SEME process in steady state [257] and dynamic mathematical description [258] using the same adsorbent (4A zeolite) and catalyst for methanol synthesis (CuO/ZnO/Al2O3) as Iliuta et al. [254]. The three-phase system (with gas and adsorbent passing through a fixed annular section packed with catalyst) and a regeneration unit for the adsorbent (used in cyclical operation) allow a continuous operation. Zeolite regeneration was considered by simultaneous TSA and PSA method. Vacuum conditions and a temperature rise from 250 °C to 300−400 °C were required to regenerate the adsorbent. The steady state simulation results [257] led to conclusions similar to those provided by Iliuta et al. [254], as the methanol production rate is significantly amplified by the presence of the adsorbent. The diameter of the adsorbent particles was found to be an important parameter. By increasing the particle size, the pressure drop through the column decreases, generating an increase in the partial pressure of the reactants and improving the reaction rate of methanol production. The dynamic simulations [258] revealed that a continuous decline in the catalyst active surface area via sintering over 1200 days of operation could cause a notable decline in methanol formation (from 360 to 310 tons of methanol per day). Although this concept seems highly effective in increasing the methanol yield, a more in-depth study of the stability of the catalytic material in long-term operation is necessary to ensure better efficiency of the system. Zachopoulos [259] also conducted simulation and thermodynamic analyses of SEME synthesis using Cu-based catalyst and 4A zeolite. The authors studied the impact of several parameters on CO2 conversion and methanol yield. The simulation results showed that the CO2 conversion could not exceed 30 % without adsorbent (conventional reaction), even at 50 bar, which underlines the severe thermodynamic limitations. Under the same conditions, the intensified process with a sorbent volume capacity of 0.75 led to a CO2 conversion of more than 70 %. Sorbent volume capacity is defined as the molar H2O capacity of the sorbent to the moles of H2O produced stoichiometrically from the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at full conversion, i.e. 1 mol H2O/mol CO2 [259]. This also confirms that much milder conditions (for T and P) are needed in the SEME process to achieve conversion equivalent to the conventional process. It was also revealed that a higher H2/CO2 ratio was required in the reactant feed to maintain a high selectivity towards MeOH, similar to the conclusion reached by Iliuta et al. for the SEDME process [254]. Taking into account that the stoichiometric ratio of H2/CO2 is 3 for the methanol synthesis reaction and 1 for RWGS, the selectivity was shifted towards CO at lower H2/CO2 ratios in the feed. More recently, Terreni et al. [260] studied the SEME synthesis using Cu-based catalyst coupled with 13X zeolite. The tests consisted of a first step for reaction/adsorption followed by a second step for zeolite regeneration by reducing the pressure and increasing the temperature. As in the work by Carvill et al. [244], the adsorbent was chosen for its high capacity for water uptake generated by larger pores (compared to A type zeolites). However, this study highlighted that 13X zeolites could also adsorb products such as MeOH and undesirably DME (produced by subsequent methanol dehydration on the acidic zeolite sites), alongside with water on their surface during the CO2 hydrogenation process. Consequently, the control of the product selectivity becomes more limited since Le Châtelier’s principle is applicable to all reactions (desirable or not). Nonetheless, the reaction temperature has been reported by the authors to be a factor which influenced the product selectivity [260]. Fig. 16 illustrates interesting results associated to both steps of the process. A pronounced peak in the concentration of methanol is detected when the pressure drops from 15 to 1 bar (after approximately 155 min of reaction), due to the competitive adsorption of water and methanol inside the zeolite structure, which are released when the pressure increases. Such behavior is typical for 13X zeolite which contains large pore diameters and efficiently adsorbs methanol [261]. DME produced by the system is also adsorbed on the zeolite and can be desorbed upon pressure release at 250 °C and below. Conversely, CO, produced by the side RWGS reaction, is weakly adsorbed on the zeolite, as confirmed by the small peak in CO concentration during regeneration. It is also possible to conclude that reaction temperature has a significant impact on the behavior of product adsorption. At a higher reaction temperature (300 °C), the pressure swing is sufficient to release all the methanol, which is the only product adsorbed on the zeolite along with water at this temperature. However, for a test carried out at lower temperature (200 °C) where MeOH, DME, CO and water are all adsorbed to a different extent on the zeolite, a temperature swing is subsequently needed after the pressure release to ensure complete regeneration of the zeolite. Overall, this study demonstrates that CO2 conversion in methanol synthesis can be improved by adsorbing any reaction products by 13X zeolites. However, it also highlights the importance of developing specific and optimized materials for a desired reaction: • A poorly selective catalyst decreases the total amount of methanol formed, while hindering its subsequent separation and purification. • Zeolites with larger pores such as 13X Zeolites are less selective towards water since larger molecules such as methanol and DME are also adsorbed below 250 °C. • Zeolites can be directly involved in the reaction process if Brønsted's acid centers are not optimized to prevent condensation of methanol into DME. Recent experimental [262] and modelling [263] SEDME studies carried out using commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 and 3A zeolite confirmed that the thermodynamic limits of DME synthesis could indeed be surpassed by the intensified process, as illustrated in Fig. 17 . Unlike conventional synthesis, SEDME synthesis is almost as efficient when the feed hydrogen is coupled with CO2 or CO. This can be explained by the fact that the oxygen surplus of the feed no longer ends up in CO2 when H2O is removed [262]. The authors suggested that the temperature of adsorbent regeneration may have an impact on the DME yield, as well as on CO2 conversions. At first, this could be logically explained by a better regeneration of the adsorbent at higher temperature, which then leads to an improved adsorption capacity. However, the DME yield improvement was attributed to a higher catalytic activity, as the DME yield remains higher in steady state (adsorbent fully saturated with water) when the regeneration is performed at 400 °C instead of 300 °C. The impact of different parameters was also evaluated experimentally [263]. As obtained by modeling [262], the increase in the amount of adsorbent (decrease in the catalyst/adsorbent ratio) favors the overall DME production rate. However, DME selectivity and maximum concentration significantly decreased when this ratio varied from 1:8 to 1:16. The best ratio appeared to be between 1:8 and 1:4. Analyzing the reactant feed rate also suggested that a compromise should be made in order to achieve an optimum between selectivity and productivity, i.e. the yield of DME. While lower gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) increased the selectivity towards DME because of the higher residence time of the reactants, the productivity was reduced. As in the study of Terreni et al. [260], the authors suggested that both PSA and TSA could be applied during the regeneration of the adsorbent to achieve the best DME yields and CO2 conversions. However, these two techniques could also be used alone with only a slight decrease in DME selectivity, to facilitate the design of the process on an industrial scale."
19,Conclusion and perspective for future work,"It is essential to act immediately to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions mainly produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. CO2 capture and utilization into chemicals and fuels is becoming one of the effective alternatives to tackle deficient energy supply and sustainability. Recent decades have witnessed a surge in academic interest in CO2 hydrogenation into valuable products such as CO, methanol, and DME. In CO2 hydrogenation to CO, CO2 conversion and CO selectivity are thermodynamically favored at high reaction temperatures because the reaction is endothermic. Noble/non-noble metal-based catalysts and transition metal carbides catalysts with different supports, promoters, and preparation methods are being developed to obtain high CO2 conversion and CO selectivity. Noble metal-based catalysts (Pd, Pt, Ru and Rh) with high methanation activity and high cost are the main obstacles limiting their use. Non-noble metal-based catalysts, such as Cu-based catalysts, are likely to be selected more often because of their high activity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, due to the low thermal resistance of Cu-based catalysts, promoters such as Fe are introduced to achieve higher catalytic stability. TMC catalysts, which are inexpensive, are employed because they can bring high metal dispersion resulting in enhanced activity. As promoters, the alkaline metals are introduced into these three types of catalysts to increase CO2 adsorption and CO selectivity. In the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, low temperature and high pressure thermodynamically favor the CO2 conversion to methanol. Among the appropriate catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, copper-based materials have received considerable attention, owing to the high catalytic activity, low cost, and wide abundance in comparison with Pd-based catalysts, despite their low thermal resistance. Along with a role in creating active sites, ZnO can be an effective promoter/support to improve copper dispersion. ZrO2 and CeO2 represent other powerful promoters/supports that have been widely studied due to their high redox ability, oxygen mobility, basicity, and weak hydrophilicity. Bimetallic catalysts have been noticed recently because of their distinct properties and excellent performance in methanol selectivity compared with Cu- and Pd-based catalysts. For example, In2O3/ZrO2 and NiaGab showed significantly high methanol selectivity because of their appropriate concentration of oxygen vacancies. Significant work has also been devoted to the development of catalysts with specific emphasis on the active phases, supports, and roles in the activation of CO2. To improve the catalytic performance, the researches propose improving the dispersion and reducibility of active sites, along with using the synergy between active phases and supports tuned by an appropriate selection of supports and preparation methods. In the hydrogenation of CO2 to DME, the thermodynamic behavior is similar to that in methanol synthesis. For this hybrid process, the required bi-functional catalysts merge catalysts for methanol synthesis (such as Cu-based catalysts and Pd-based catalysts) and acid solid catalysts for methanol dehydration (such as γ-Al2O3 and zeolites). However, the water affinity for γ-Al2O3 and the strong acidity of zeolites (facilitating further conversion of DME to hydrocarbons) are the major drawbacks that lead to catalyst deactivation. Considering the by-products of DME synthesis such as hydrocarbons and coke formed and deposited on the catalyst surface due to the presence of strong acidic sites, further work is essential to modify the acid properties of solid acid catalysts and obtain high selectivity of DME by implementing other basic elements. Regardless of the catalyst, the CO2 conversions reported in the literature are low because of the stable thermodynamics of CO2. Therefore, water adsorption through an intensified sorption-enhanced process is a promising technology that can lead to a significant increase in CO2 conversion and yield of CO, methanol, or DME, by shifting thermodynamically the equilibrium reaction toward the reaction products. This emerging technology is an integrated process combining the CO2 hydrogenation reaction with the in-situ water removal. In this process, the key component is a solid mixture containing both catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation and water adsorbent. Interestingly, through this kind of intensified processes, not only can the reaction be conducted at lower temperatures compared to the conventional processes, but the catalyst deactivation rooted from metal sintering and coking can be subsequently reduced. Among the available water sorbents, zeolites like LTA and FAU have a high potential to efficiently remove water in-situ in the CO2 hydrogenation reactions because of their significant water uptake capacity at the (high) reaction temperature. However, to be considered for use in the SERP, sorbent materials should limit the preferential adsorption of compounds other than water in the reaction media. Optimizing the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure) has also been reported to guide the selectivity of the reaction towards CO, methanol and/or DME. Finally, there is still enormous potential to improve the activity and desired product selectivity, and overcome the deactivation of the catalyst systems: - Choosing suitable supports or incorporating promoters appropriately should be considered to take advantage of the characteristics of metal oxides (Lewis acidity, oxygen vacancy, and basicity) and synergy between metal and support to improve both CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation/spillover. For example, the choice of ZrO2 (with the properties of thermal stability, weak hydrophilicity, Lewis properties, and oxygen vacancies) as a support and CeO2 (with the characterizations of oxygen vacancies and basicity) as a promoter could enhance CO2 activation, copper dispersion, and stability of Cu-based catalysts. - Establishing suitable catalyst preparations is essential to enhance the active phase dispersion and maximize the role of support and promoters. The use of precipitation method with some modifications can be used as a salient example. The addition of surfactant or the employment of a reducing agent during the precipitation stage could promote the interaction between active phase, promoters, and support. - While the reaction mechanisms and instrumental intermediates of CO2 hydrogenation reactions are still under debate, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the influence of (i) active sites and (ii) synergy between catalyst components on the reaction mechanism is crucial to design catalysts potentially usable in the industrial sector. For instance, as methanol and CO synthesis routes share some intermediate species, a thorough understanding of the formation of different intermediates that further convert into methanol and its counterpart could improve the selectivity of the desired products. The development of suitable catalysts should therefore be focused on the dispersion of active sites that facilitate the destabilization of these intermediates and lower the activation energy to direct the reaction pathway toward the desired products. - Insight into the structure-property relationships is crucial to design catalyst systems. By employing in-situ techniques (like X-ray adsorption, infrared radiation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isotopic labeling) and DFT calculations, one can identify the key reaction intermediates evolving into different stages, thus establishing the synergy between catalytic structure and activity. - The sorption-enhanced processes for CO2 hydrogenation reactions require developing highly efficient water sorbents with high uptake capacity and kinetics, as well as selectivity for water in the reaction media. By precisely tuning the adsorbents’ structure, the selectivity of the desired products can be controlled. For instance, it has been revealed that zeolites with larger pores (such as 13X) are less selective towards water, since larger molecules such as methanol and DME can also be potentially adsorbed below 250 °C. In the same context, CO2 can be adsorbed as well; this not only reduces its potential in the hydrogenation process, but also affects the capacity of the sorbents to remove water in-situ from the reaction media. Further investigating the selectivity of different adsorbents is therefore essential to develop this intensified process. - Regardless of the issues with catalytic efficiency, to improve considerably CO2 conversion, product yield, and selectivity of the desired products for potential industrial applications, further research should be directed toward integrating water adsorbents in the intensified reaction system. Therefore, developing bifunctional materials containing the active phase of the catalyst and the adsorbent within the same particle represents an interesting avenue that could improve the performance of the hydrogenation process. - Designing and optimizing reactors that integrate both adsorption and regeneration steps through cyclic operation in the sorption-enhanced processes is mandatory to increase the industrialization potential of this innovative CO2-to-fuels process. Using two or more reactors in parallel could help circumvent this problem. These complex operational logistics should be further investigated."
