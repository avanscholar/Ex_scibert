0,Introduction,"Although hydrogen production by ethanol steam reforming (ESR) has been extensively studied in the literature, the majority of the studies was performed using pure ethanol and water mixtures [1,2]. The possible reaction pathways of the steam reforming of a pure ethanol and water mixture are summarized in Table 1 . In the literature [3–8], ESR is described by three mains reactions accounting for the formation of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 (reactions 1, 2 and 3). Nevertheless, acetaldehyde and ethylene may be considered as important intermediates in the formation of hydrogen [9,10]. In order to maximize the H2 and CO2 productions and to minimize the coke formation, it is crucial to use a catalyst that enhances ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde (reaction (4)) and reactions (11)–(13). Among the noble metals studied [3,9–23], it was shown that Rh is the most active in the ethanol steam reforming, as for the steam reforming of many hydrocarbons [24–29]. The choice of the support is a key factor for a good stability of the catalyst. It has a strong effect on both the activity and selectivity. It was shown that Rh/MgAl2O4 is an active and stable catalyst for ethanol steam reforming at high temperatures [30]. Ethanol steam reforming proceeds according to a bifunctional mechanism (Fig. 1 ), as proposed from the results obtained in our laboratory [25,31] Ethanol may be activated on the metal particle or on the support acidic and basic sites to produce the intermediate products (1). Acetaldehyde can be produced on both the support (basic sites) and the metal. Ethylene is only produced on the support, with an essential role of acidic sites on olefin formation. Water would be activated on the support resulting in the formation of hydroxyl groups (2). The support would promote the migration of these OH groups toward the metal particle (3), where the final step of reaction products formation occurs (4). Despite its lower production cost compared to that of pure ethanol, very few studies report the use of crude bioethanol, obtained by fermentation of biomass followed by a simple flash distillation, for hydrogen production by steam reforming. The steam reforming of crude bioethanol differs from that of pure ethanol by the presence of many impurities that may affect the catalyst stability [32–37]. Crude bioethanol obtained from sugar beet contains not only ethanol and water, but also (i) alcohols, accounting for 87% of the whole impurities, the most important being propan-1-ol (27%) and methyl-3 butan-1-ol (27%), and (ii) esters, amines, aldehydes and acids [37]. In our previous paper [35], the effect of various impurities on the catalytic performances (stability, hydrogen yield) was evaluated using a 1%Rh/MgAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst. The experiments were performed using a pure ethanol and water mixture containing 1% of a model impurity, representative of those found in a crude bioethanol feed obtained from sugar beet. Two types of impurities were studied, i.e. impurities with four carbon atoms (an aldehyde, butanal, an alcohol, butanol, an ester, ethylacetate…) and impurities with acidic or basic properties (acetic acid and diethylamine). It was demonstrated that the impurities present in crude bioethanol may have either (i) a promoting effect, as for example for diethylamine and butanal, which increases the hydrogen yield and the ethanol conversion, compared to the results obtained in the absence of impurities, or (ii) a poisoning effect, leading to a strong deactivation of the catalyst, as observed in the presence of butanol, acetic acid and ethylacetate. As the most important impurities present in crude bioethanol are the other alcohols, it is of major importance to evaluate their impact on the catalyst stability. Rass-Hansen et al. [36] have studied the steam reforming of technical bioethanol and they demonstrated that, although higher alcohols are not expected to be detrimental for the reaction, they contribute to a faster deactivation of the catalyst, especially at low temperature (400°C). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of linear or branched alcohols with 1–5 carbon atoms, on the same 1%Rh/MgAlO4/Al2O3 catalyst. The alcohols studied are linear alcohols (methanol (MeOH), propan-1-ol (n-C3H7OH), butan-1-ol (n-C4H9OH) and pentan-1-ol (n-C5H11OH)) and branched alcohols (propan-2-ol (i-C3H7OH), methyl-2-propan-1-ol (i-C4H9OH) and methyl-3 butan-1-ol (i-C5H11OH)). To the best of our knowledge, the effect of each type of alcohol (linear or branched) on the ethanol steam reforming has never been reported in the literature."
1,Experimental,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The Rh(1%)/MgAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by modification of alumina beads by impregnation of magnesium acetate (5% of Mg in the support) followed by the wet impregnation of rhodium chloride. The final catalyst was activated by calcination under air at 700°C. The complete experimental procedure is detailed in [30,35]."
3,Ethanol steam reforming reaction (ESR),"2.2 Ethanol steam reforming reaction (ESR) The experiments were performed at 675°C and 2 bar with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 19.5h−1. These experimental conditions, especially the temperature and the WHSV, were chosen in order to obtain less than 100% of ethanol conversion at the beginning of the reaction in order to evaluate the stability of the catalyst. Prior to reaction run, the catalyst was reduced under pure hydrogen at 675°C. The experimental procedure and the analysis of reaction products are described in details in [35]. Typically, the ethanol/water mixture, containing 1mol%, referred to ethanol, of another alcohol as impurity was injected with a liquid pump (Gilson 307) (0.23cm3 min−1 of liquid flowrate) and preheated at 130°C before entering the reactor. The alcohols studied were methanol, propan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, pentan-1-ol, isopropanol, 2-methyl propan-1-ol, 3-methyl butan-1-ol. The molar water to ethanol ratio was chosen equal to 4, whatever the catalytic test, i.e. in the presence or in the absence of impurities. Some experiments were also performed by replacing the ethanol by another alcohol in the same experimental conditions, i.e. with a molar water to alcohol ratio of 4. If nx in and nx out are the molar flow rates of the product X at the inlet and the outlet of the reactor, respectively, the catalyst performance is characterized by: - the product yield (mole of X per mole of introduced alcohol): Y X = n X Out n Alcohol In - the ethanol or alcohol conversion: X Alcohol = n Alcohol In − n Alcohol Out n Alcohol In × 100 The C molar yield is calculated from the carbon molar balance: Y C = χ · n Alcohol in − ∑ χ · n X out where χ is the stoichiometry factor (corresponding to the number of C present in the compound)."
4,Results and discussion,"Two series of tests have been performed, the first one corresponding to the ESR in presence of 1mol% of alcoholic impurity with one to 5 carbon atoms (linear and branched alcohols) and the second one to the steam reforming reaction linear and branched alcohols with 3 or 4 carbon atoms."
5,Effect of alcohol impurities on the ESR,"3.1 Effect of alcohol impurities on the ESR Figs. 2 and 3 represent the evolution of the dry gas flowrate as a function of time on stream during the steam reforming of ethanol containing linear or branched alcohol, respectively. It was shown in [35] that this type of curve is similar to that of the ethanol conversion and allows one to estimate the catalyst stability. Results, in terms of yields in various products and ethanol conversion are summarized in Table 2 , where they are compared to the results obtained with a pure ethanol and water mixture, considered as a reference test. At first, it can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 that, whatever the alcohol (pure ethanol or ethanol containing one impurity), the dry gas flowrate decreases as a function of time-on-stream (TOS). This is due to the formation of coke that is favored, even with pure ethanol, at this temperature. This decrease is more pronounced at the beginning of the reaction. It is known that acidic sites of the support favor the dehydration reaction (reaction (5) in Table 1) leading to the formation of olefins, responsible for coke formation. Then, it can be inferred that this dehydration reaction is important at the beginning of the reaction and that the coke produced leads to a partial blockage of the acidic sites thus hindering this type of reaction. After 1 h of TOS, the deactivation rate seems to be similar whatever the feed, the curves being parallel. Secondly, it can be seen that the behavior at the beginning of the reaction strongly differs depending on the impurity introduced in the ethanol feed. Fig. 2 shows that, at the beginning of the reaction test, the dry gas flowrate evolution in the presence of methanol as impurity can be considered similar to that observed for the reference test, i.e. with the pure ethanol and water mixture, but slightly higher after 8h of TOS. Moreover, the hydrogen yield in the presence of methanol is also slightly higher (Table 2), which can be attributed in part to the production of additional H2 by methanol steam reforming, according to the following reaction [38–40]: CH3OH+H2O→CO2 +3H2 A study of Takezawa [41] showed that, for noble metals, the adsorption of methanol occurs preferentially on the metallic phase resulting in the formation of formaldehyde intermediate, which is then easily decomposed into CO and H2. However, if one considers the methanol introduced in the feed, i.e. 0.01 mol per mol of ethanol, and the reaction above, yielding 3 mol of H2 per mole of methanol, the highest possible additional amount of hydrogen due to methanol steam reforming is 0.03 mol per mole of ethanol introduced. The value reported in Table 3 being slightly higher than this value (0.13 mol of additional H2 per mole of ethanol), it can be inferred that methanol has probably a small promoting effect on the steam reforming reaction. Contrary to what is observed in the presence of methanol, the catalytic performances for ethanol steam reforming in the presence of linear or branched higher alcohols are strongly affected. A strong decrease in the dry gas flowrate (Figs. 2 and 3) associated with a significant decrease in ethanol conversion (Table 2) is observed. However, the H2 and CO2 yields are higher than those obtained by thermal decomposition in the same experimental conditions [35]. For linear alcohols, whatever the amount of carbon atoms, water is consumed, since the amount of water at the outlet is lower than the amount introduced for the reaction (4 mol mol−1). This indicates that the steam reforming reaction occurs and that the catalyst is not completely deactivated. On the contrary, for branched alcohols it is not sure that the steam reforming reaction proceeds. Figs. 4 and 5 present the evolution of the H2 yield and the ethanol conversion, at 8h of time on stream, versus the number of carbons contained in the higher alcohols (C3–C5 alcohols). It can be seen that the H2 yield and the ethanol conversion decrease as the number of carbon in the alcohol increases, demonstrating a strong inhibition of the ethanol steam reforming reaction in the presence of higher alcohols. This poisoning effect is even more pronounced in the presence of branched alcohols. The deactivation observed in the presence of C3–C5 alcohols may be linked to the production of C3–C5 olefins, as intermediate product, by dehydration reaction. Although these olefins have not been detected in the reaction products (Table 2), their formation may contribute to coke formation. Indeed, it can be inferred that alcohol may be either dehydrated to olefin or dehydrogenated to aldehyde according to a similar mechanism to that proposed for ethanol [9,10]. However, the dehydrogenation of alcohol, yielding aldehyde, is probably not favored on the Rh/MgAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst, since it has been demonstrated that the presence of butanal in the ethanol and water mixture favors the ethanol conversion [35]. The dehydration of alcohols on alumina has been the object of many investigations since the beginning of the 20th century. It was studied in details by Pines et al. in the 1960s [42]. They show that the dehydration of butan-1-ol results in the production of but-1-ene, to a large extent, by a trans elimination reaction, the remainder being but-2-ene. The 2-methyl propan-1-ol also yields butenes by skeletal isomerization. At the same period, Knözinger and coll. [43] studied the reactions of dehydration of branched and linear alcohols with various chain lengths and demonstrated that, whatever the alcohol studied, the final product is an olefin, and, only in the case of linear alcohols and at low temperature, ethers were identified as intermediary products. Later, Clayborne et al. [44] studied the dehydration on alumina of various linear alcohols (C2-C5) by temperature programmed desorption between 30 and 430°C. They showed that these alcohols were decomposed preferentially in the form of the associated olefin (C2H4 for ethanol, C3H6 for propanol, C4H8 for butanol and C5H10 for pentanol). Then, it can be inferred from the results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 that the presence of higher alcohols in the feed favors the production of C3–C5 olefins that will easily polymerize yielding coke and then leading to the deactivation of the catalyst. It can be imagined that coke formation due to olefin polymerization will be increased with the increase of the alcohol chain length. Regarding the more important deactivation observed in the presence of branched alcohols, they may form more stable carbocations, which may facilitate the olefin production and then coke in the same way. However, the higher alcohols may also react with water by steam reforming, and, as for ethanol, they can be dehydrogenated. Mostafa et al. [45] studied the decomposition of ethanol, propan-2-ol and butan-2-ol in the presence of Pt nanoparticles supported on zirconia between 100 and 300°C. Whereas the thermal decomposition of ethanol starts at roughly 230°C and yields mainly H2, CO and CH4, the decomposition of propanol and butanol begins around 150°C with the formation of the corresponding ketones, propanone and butanone, and hydrogen by dehydrogenation reaction. At higher temperatures, the dehydration reaction occurs, leading to the formation of the corresponding alkenes and then to the deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivation by coke deposition starts at 250°C for the C3 and C4 alcohols and at higher temperature, 325°C, for ethanol [45]. The deactivation was explained by the presence of coke accumulated at the support surface."
6,Steam reforming of C3 and C4 linear and branched alcohols,"3.2 Steam reforming of C3 and C4 linear and branched alcohols In order to show more clearly what types of product can be obtained by the steam reforming of higher alcohols in our experimental conditions, the reaction was performed using C3 and C4 linear and branched alcohols instead of ethanol with a water to alcohol ratio R of 4. The reaction was stopped after 2h of TOS because for longer TOS, a blockage of the reactor by coke deposit was observed. The test was also carried out with a higher water to alcohol ratio (R =10) but in this condition, no alcohol conversion was observed. The results obtained with R =4 are summarized in Table 3 and compared to those obtained with pure ethanol after 2h of TOS. One can note that the only products observed are H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, alkenes and alkanes. No ketone was detected. At first, these results show that the conversion of these alcohols is very high, between 78 and 99%, after 2h of TOS. Secondly, water is clearly consumed only for the linear C3 alcohol, propan-1-ol, the amount of water, 3.87 mol mol−1, being lower than the amount introduced (4 mol mol−1). Then, it can be inferred that the steam reforming of propan-1-ol takes place. For the other alcohols, water is produced and not consumed, indicating that the dehydration reaction plays an important role in the alcohol conversion. The sum of the amount of alkenes and carbon increases linearly with the amount of water at the outlet of the reactor, indicating the direct link between the formation of the alkenes and then coke with the dehydration reaction. For the linear alcohols, the comparison of the results presented in Table 3 for n-C3H7OH and n-C4H9OH steam reforming show that an increase in the carbon chain length leads to a decrease in the hydrogen yield but to an important increase in the yield in alkenes. On the other hand, for the same number of carbon atoms in the alcohol molecule, for example n-C3H7OH and i-C4H9OH, the corresponding olefin and C yields are higher in the case of the branched alcohol than that of linear alcohol. In the previous paragraph, it was shown that the deactivation during ethanol steam reforming in the presence of higher alcohols increases when the alcohol chain length increases and is more pronounced with branched alcohols than with the linear ones. The distribution of products obtained here by steam reforming of these higher alcohols shows that the same trend is observed regarding the production of olefins and carbon species. Then, the deactivation of the catalyst during ethanol steam reforming in the presence of higher alcohols may be mainly attributed to the dehydration of these impurities yielding olefins and then deactivating coke. Nevertheless, the C3–C5 alcohol poisoning could also be the result of an adsorption competition between C3–C5 alcohols, ethanol and water. Moreover, when adsorbed on the catalyst surface, the lipophilic nature of the C3–C5 alcohols could make the catalyst surface more hydrophobic and then may hinder the adsorption of water and ethanol."
7,Conclusion,"Ethanol steam reforming was studied in the presence of various alcohols as model impurities, the higher alcohols being the main (87%) impurities present in crude bioethanol obtained from sugar beet. It was shown that the ethanol conversion is not modified in the presence of methanol but the hydrogen yield is slightly increased, due in part to the methanol steam reforming reaction. In the presence of linear or branched higher alcohols, with more than three carbon atoms, a strong deactivation was observed, leading to a decrease in the ethanol conversion and the hydrogen yield. The deactivation is increased when the amount of carbon atoms in the molecule is increased. This effect is more pronounced in the presence of branched alcohols compared to the linear ones. It was demonstrated by studying the steam reforming of these higher alcohols that they are dehydrated to the corresponding olefin. The olefins then polymerized to yield coke, the coke extent increasing with the amount of carbon atoms in the olefin. The more important deactivating effect of the branched alcohols may be explained by the formation of more stable carbocations thus facilitating the olefin production. To conclude, the effect of the higher alcohol on the catalyst deactivation could be attributed to their dehydration on the support acid site to yield an olefin (A). This alkene polymerizes to form a carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst active sites (B and C), which limits the ethanol and water activation (D) (Fig. 6 ). Consequently, the 1%Rh/MgAl2O4/Al2O3 catalyst, which was demonstrated to be particularly active and stable for pure ethanol steam reforming, is rapidly deactivated in the presence of crude bioethanol containing higher alcohols. The stability can be improved by changing the catalyst composition or by increasing the reaction temperature. For example, it was proven that a catalyst such as Rh–Ni/Y2O3–Al2O3 is much more stable during ethanol steam reforming in the presence of methyl-2-propan-1-ol as model impurity, in the same reaction conditions [46,47]."
