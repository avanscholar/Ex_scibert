0,Introduction,"In the process of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) production with propylene and water as raw materials and liquid or solid acid as catalyst, a large number of by-products containing diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be obtained [1,2]. The separation of DIPE / IPA determines the economic effect of the whole process. Because IPA and DIPE form binary minimum boiling homogeneous azeotrope, they cannot be separated in traditional distillation process. Extractive distillation [3,4], azeotropic distillation [5] and pressure-swing distillation [6,7] are all effective methods for azeotropic separation. Furthermore, liquid-liquid extraction [8] is also a useful way for the separation of azeotropic systems. Ionic liquids (ILs) are odorless, nonflammable, easy to separate from products, easy to recover, can be repeatedly recycled, and can be designed. They are ideal substitutes for traditional volatile solvents and environmentally friendly green solvents [9,10]. The reason ILs are selected as extractants is that they have almost no vapor pressure and excellent thermal stability. At the same time, they have selective dissolving ability and suitable liquid range. More importantly, They can be recycled through simple distillation. These advantages make the application of ILs in extraction more and more extensive. They are suitable for the requirements of clean technology and sustainable development advocated at present, and has been widely recognized and accepted by people. COSMO model (conductor like screening model) [11] is a new continuum model proposed by Klamt and Schüürmann based on quantum chemistry. COSMO model has higher accuracy and efficiency in calculating dielectric shielding charge and dielectric shielding energy on the surface of van der Waals like molecules. Klamt et al. proposed COSMO-RS model [12,13], which can more directly and quantitatively calculate the thermodynamic properties of pure substances or substances in solution. Lin and Sandler put forward COSMO-SAC (COSMO segment activity coefficient) model [14,15] for real solution, which is a new activity coefficient model. When hydrogen atom is close to atom Y (O, F, N, etc.) with large electronegativity and small radius, hydrogen is used as the medium to generate X-H⋯Y special intermolecular or intramolecular interaction between X and Y. The form of X-H⋯Y is called hydrogen bond which is stronger than forces between molecules. Yu et al. [16] calculated the interaction energy between [C8DIPA][Im] and butanol, acetone and ethanol respectively. The experimental results were consistent with the calculated results. Lu et al. [17] calculated the interaction energy between [C8MIM][BF4] and thiophene, dibenzothiophene, cyclohexane, toluene, and proved that [C8MIM][BF4] preferentially adsorbed dibenzothiophene and thiophene, which accorded well with experimental results. The further analysis of extraction mechanism is of important reference value for screening ILs extractants. In this paper, on the basis of molecular analysis, the extraction mechanism is discussed. For explaining the potential extraction mechanism between ILs and IPA, σ-profile obtained from COSMO-SAC model is analyzed to verify the strength of the ability to form hydrogen bonds between molecules [18]. In addition, by analyzing the results of quantum chemistry calculation between the selected ILs and IPA, the possible interaction between molecules can be determined. Meanwhile, the LLE experiment data are measured for {DIPE + IPA + 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethansulfonate, [BMIM][OTF], DIPE + IPA + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate, [EMIM][OTF], DIPE + IPA + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, [EMIM]DCA}. According to the experimental data, distribution coefficient (D) and the selectivity coefficient (S) are calculated, which are also the evaluation index of extraction effect. At the same time, the experimental data are regressed to obtain the binary interaction parameters of NRTL model, and the root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the experimental value and the calculated value is calculated. In Aspen Plus, extraction processes of different ILs as extractant are simulated. UNIFAC method as an activity coefficient estimation method is used to define ILs [19]. BasedonthebinaryinteractionparametersofNRTL,theextractionprocessesaresimulated. In the extraction process, the design regulation is that the purity of DIPE is over 99.5%, the recovery of IPA is over 98.0% [20,21]. The number of stages and the range of solvent feed (S/F) are obtained, and the total annual cost (TAC) are calculated. The simulation processes of different ILs as extractants are compared. This work presents a method combining computer calculation, experiment and process simulation to separate DIPE and IPA system. The extraction process of DIPE-IPA-ILs is analyzed from three aspects: molecular mechanism, liquid–liquid equilibrium experiment and extraction process simulation. From the perspective of molecular calculation, the extraction mechanism is analyzed. By calculating the intermolecular interaction energy between selected ILs and IPA, the extraction ability of different ILs is compared. The correctness of mechanism analysis is verified by liquid–liquid equilibrium experiment. This paper provides a new theoretical guidance for the selection of extractants for separating azeotropes."
1,Method,
2,Interaction between ILs and IPA,"2.1 Interaction between ILs and IPA COSMO-SAC model is a solvent screening model derived from conductor like screening model (COSMO). In the process of screening extractants by COSMO-SAC method, we can get the surface charge density distribution data of different extractants, DIPE and IPA, i.e. σ-profile. σ-profile is the embodiment of molecular surface charge polarization, from which we can see the hydrogen bond interaction between molecules. The molecular structure can be downloaded directly from the database. The structure and energy of each component are optimized by the quantum chemistry calculation software of material studio (MS). Quantum chemistry calculation is carried out by Dmol3 module of MS software. The VWN-BP functional of DNP group is used to optimize the structure of all molecules, and the COSMO file is calculated as the input file of phase equilibrium calculation. The actual space truncation value is set to 5.5 Å, and the DNP v4.0.0 basis set were used as proposed by Mullins et al. [22] In COSMO-SAC model, the intermolecular force is generated by the surface shielding charge interaction when they are in close contact. The ideal shielding charge is distributed on the surface of every molecule. By decomposing the whole surface into several pieces, the surface area and charge density of each piece can be obtained, and then projected onto a two-dimensional coordinate to construct a two-dimensional histogram, then the hole charge density distribution function can be obtained, i.e. σ-profile. In the Fig. 1 , two black virtual lines at σ = ±0.0082 e/Å−2 represent the threshold of hydrogen bonding. When the surface charge density falls in the region σ < −0.0082 e/Å−2, it means that the substance has a strong ability to provide hydrogen bond. On the contrary, when it is in the region σ > +0.0082 e/Å−2, it means that the substance has a strong ability to accept hydrogen bond. When it is in the non-polar region of −0.0082 e/Å−2 σ < +0.0082 e/Å−2, it means that the substance or the part does not have the ability to combine hydrogen bond. The peak of selected ILs is [0.01,0.016] e/Å−2, which indicates that the selected ILs has a strong ability of hydrogen bond acceptance. The peak of IPA is [-0.016, −0.01] e/Å−2 and [0.01, 0.016] e/Å−2, which proves that IPA can either accept hydrogen bonds or provide hydrogen bonds. DIPE has a peak height in the hydrogen bonding receiving region and no peak in the hydrogen bonding supplying region. This indicates that hydrogen bond is easier to form between ILs and IPA. This indicates that IPA is the extracted substance. This proved the feasibility and rationality of using selected ILs as the extractants in the system of liquid-liquid extraction and separation of DIPE and IPA. In order to ensure that the calculated space configuration is the space geometry with the lowest global energy, the random multiple space structure configurations are used to optimize the structure and energy respectively, and the space geometry with the lowest global energy is selected as the final optimal one configuration. The optimal configurations of the complexes of different ILs and IPA are obtained, and the bond lengths of the complexes are obtained. As shown in the Fig. 2 . In Figure, the white atoms, the red atoms and the blue atoms are hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. The van der Waals radii of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms are 1.2, 1.52 and 1.55, respectively [23]. The distance between the oxygen atom in [BMIM]OTF and the hydrogen atom in IPA is 1.803, which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radius of the oxygen atom and the hydrogen atom. The distance between the oxygen atom in [EMIM]OTF and the hydrogen atom in IPA is 1.913, which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radius of the oxygen atom and the hydrogen atom. The distance between the nitrogen atom in [EMIM]DCA and the hydrogen atom in IPA is 1.780, which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radius of the nitrogen atom and the hydrogen atom. When the distance between atoms is less than the van der Waals radius, there is an intermolecular interaction between atoms. [24] Then, the force between molecules of ILs and IPA are calculated. When calculating the interaction energy between A and B molecules, it can not be simply calculated by △E = EAB – EA – EB. Because the decrease of the energy of EAB relative to EA + EB comes from two aspects, one is the real interaction energy between A and B molecules, the other is that the basis functions of A and B molecules overlap each other in the complex system, which is equivalent to increasing the base group of the complex and reducing the energy of EAB. This part of error is called basis set superposition error (BSSE). In order to make the calculation results more accurate,the balance correction method [25] is used to correct. The calculation formula is as follows: (1) △ E = E AB - E A - E B + E BEES (2) E BEES = E A - E ( A , A B ) + E B - E ( B , A B ) where EAB isintermolecular interaction energy, EA and EB are the energy of molecule A(ILs) and B(IPA). E(B,AB) is the energy of A in the A, B. The calculated energies for IPA + [EMIM]DCA/[BMIM]OTF/[EMIM]OTF are −67.298049 kJ·mol−1, −28.909541 kJ·mol−1 and −18.222726 kJ·mol−1. The results show that interaction energy between IPA and [EMIM]DCA is the strongest The sequence of interaction force is [EMIM]DCA > [BMIM]OTF > [EMIM]OTF. The details are demonstrated in Table S2. O-H⋯N is formed between [EMIM]DCA and IPA. O-H⋯O is formed between [BMIM]OTF, [EMIM]OTF and IPA. The energy of O-H⋯N is greater than O-H⋯O. Therefore, the interaction force between [EMIM]DCA and IPA is greater than interaction force between the other two ILs and IPA. In Fig. 3 , the electron density can be used to judge the existence of hydrogen bonds. When the isovalue is 0.2, the electron density between the anion of [BMIM]OTF/[EMIM]OTF and IPA still exists. This indicates that O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds have formed between IPA and [BMIM]OTF/[EMIM]OTF. When the isovalue is 0.2, the electron density between the anion of [EMIM]DCA and IPA still exists. This indicates that O-H⋯N hydrogen bonds have formed between IPA and [EMIM]DCA. In Fig. 4 , the deformation charge density of the selected ILs and IPA are shown. The red region around O atom and N atom is easy to accept electrons, and the blue region around H atom is easy to lose electrons. The junction area between red and blue region indicates the formation of hydrogen bond. The results show that hydrogen bond is formed between H atom in IPA and O atom in anion of [BMIM]OTF/[EMIM]OTF, and hydrogen bond is formed between H atom in IPA and nitrogen atom in anion of [EMIM]DCA."
3,Experiment,
4,Chemicals,"3.1 Chemicals In this study, the purity of the reagents used in the experiment are determined by gas chromatography (GC-2014C). All chemicals are not purified. The details of the reagents used in the LLE experiment are listed in Table S1."
5,Apparatus and procedure,"3.2 Apparatus and procedure These systems of {DIPE + IPA + [BMIM][OTF], DIPE + IPA + [EMIM][OTF], DIPE + IPA + [EMIM][DCA]} are measured at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure. In order to determine the extraction feasibility of ILs for azeotropic system and explore the appropriate experimental operating conditions, a small amount of drugs are taken for the pre-experiment of extraction research before the formal experiment. The conjugate boundary of ternary system and the stirring and standing time to achieve two-phase equilibrium are determined. In the pre-experiment, the experimental operating conditions are determined as follows: the sample are put into the balance cell for a certain proportion. It is stirred for at least 2 h and is take off the mixing device. Then it is placed for more than 12 h to ensure the balance state. After reaching equilibrium, the samples are taken out from the upper and lower layers respectively. GC-2014C thermal conductivity detector and Porapak Q packed column were used to determine the content of the sample. The operating conditions are described in detail in our previous work [26,27]. The results were corrected by internal standard method. Ethanol is selected as the internal standard substance, and equal amount of internal standard substance is added to each measurement sample. Each sample was measured at least three times. Helium (>99.99% purity) is used as carrier gas. And the detection conditions are as follows: the temperature of column oven, detector and injector were 478.15 K, 478.15 K and 454.15 K, respectively. The composition of the ILs system cannot be analyzed directly by gas chromatography. In this paper, the mass difference method is used. After measuring the component content, the mixed sample is put into a vacuum drying chamber (DZF-6020). Under the condition of vacuum and 404.15 K, the organic matter would completely evaporate. After 48 h, the mass of the sample is measured, i.e. the mass of the IL in the sample. Therefore, the mass of IL in the sample is indirectly obtained."
6,Experiment results and discussion,"3.3 Experiment results and discussion The LLE data of DIPE (1) + IPA (2) + ILs (3) system are measured. The results are listed in Table S3. Fig. 5 shows the contact tie-line of ternary systems. D and S are generally used to characterize the extraction ability. The larger D is, the better the extraction separation effect is. The larger S is, the smaller the amount of extractant is. D and S are two commonly used indexes of extraction separation. Formula D [28] and S [29] is defined as follows: (3) D = χ 2 IL - r i c h χ 2 DIPE - r i c h (4) S = χ 2 IL - r i c h / χ 1 IL - r i c h χ 2 DIPE - r i c h / χ 1 DIPE - r i c h Where index 1 means DIPE and index 2 represents IPA. The index DIPE-rich represents the DIPE enriched phase and the IL-rich represents the ILs enriched phase. D and S values were demonstrated in Table S3. Arce et al. [30] used water as extractant to separate DIPE and IPA system. According to the equilibrium data in the literature, we calculated the distribution coefficient and selectivity coefficient in Table S4. The results showed that the distribution coefficient of ILs as extractant was higher, and the selectivity coefficient of water as extractant was higher. When water is used as the extractant, ternary mixture DIPE/IPA/water is a complex system with three binary azeotropes which will cause great trouble to the recovery of the subsequent extractant. When ILs are used as extractants, the recovery of extractants can be realized by simple flash evaporation. Therefore, ILs as extractants have more advantages in the separation of subsequent extractants."
7,Process simulation and optimization,"Based on the experimental study of liquid–liquid equilibrium of ILs - DIPE - IPA, the process of separation DIPE and IPA by ILs extraction is simulated and optimized by Aspen plus V8.4, and the operating conditions of extraction process are determined."
8,UNIFAC model for defining ILs,"4.1 UNIFAC model for defining ILs UNIFAC group contribution method is derived from the group analysis method combined with the UNIQUAC model in 1975 by Fredenslund et al. [31] This method predicts the activity factor according to the concept of group contribution. The interaction coefficient between groups is derived from the experimental data of binary pairs, and then these parameters are used to calculate the phase equilibrium data of those systems without experimental data. The physical parameters of ILs and the parameters between ILs groups can be gained directly from literatures [32–34]."
9,NRTL model,"4.2 NRTL model Thermodynamic properties can be predicted or correlated by thermodynamic models. Non-random two-liquid theory (NRTL) is a suitable model for thermodynamic research of binary and multicomponent systems. Non-ideal behavior can be described correctly [35]. The binary interaction parameters are determined via the non-linear least squares method. The regression data are listed in Table S5. The deviation between the experimental value and the calculated value can be measured by rmsd [36]. The formulas are as follows: (5) rmsd = 100 ∑ k = 1 M ∑ j = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 3 x ijk exp - x ijk calc 2 6 M 1 / 2 The binary interaction parameters and the rmsd values are listed in Table S5. The rmsd is less than 3%, which shows that the experimental data and the model prediction data are in good agreement."
10,Extraction process analysis,"4.3 Extraction process analysis The feed flow is 1000 kg/h, in which the mass fraction of DIPE is 85.37% and the mass fraction of IPA is 14.63%. The temperature and pressure of feed and solvent flow are 298.15 K and 1 bar respectively.The feed flow of [EMIM]DCA, [BMIM]OTF and [EMIM]OTF are 700 kg/h, 1800 kg/h and 1300 kg/h. The temperature and pressure of the flash evaporation are 400 K and 0.01 bar. The simulation process includes a extraction column (EC) and a flash evaporation. The IL enters the EC from the top and the mixture is fed to the bottom. High purity DIPE is collected in the upper part of the EC, and the mixture moves to the foot of the EC. The mixture is led away to a flash evaporation to separate the IL. The high purity IL is obtained at the bottom of the flash evaporation and return to EC for recycling. TAC is used to calculate the cost of the process and further complete the process design and economic evaluation. TAC is calculated as follows: (6) TAC = A O C + TCC PBP TCC is total capital cost and AOC is annual operating cost. PBP is payback period and the value of PBP is 3 years. The cost of equipment includes extraction column, flash evaporation and heat exchanger. The cost of pump and pipeline is negligible. The operating cost includes the cost of steam and the cooling water. The target purity of DIPE is above 99.5 wt% and the target recovery of IPA is above 98.0%. Fig. 6 is optimization procedure to obtain the minimum TAC, in order to get the minimum TAC, under the condition that the purity and recovery rate are met and S/F is constant, the TAC increases with the increase of the number of trays. Therefore, under the same feed ratio, the TAC with the smallest number of trays is output. Under the same number of stages, TAC increases with the increase of S/F. Therefore, the TAC with the minimum S/F at the same stage number is output. It is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 7–9 , when the conditions that the purity of DIPE is over 99.50% and the recovery of IPA is over 98.0% are met, we can determine the number of stages and S/F. When the number of stages is determined, the TAC will increase with the increase of S/F. In Table 1 , TAC is output in these cases. Fig. 10 shows the histogram of TAC. When [BMIM]OTF is used as extractant, TAC is minimum under A6 operation condition. When [EMIM]OTF is used as extractant, TAC is minimum under B6 operation condition. When [EMIM]DCA is used as extractant, TAC is minimum under C7 operation condition. Under the optimized conditions, the extraction processes of different ILs ([BMIM]OTF, [EMIM] [OTF], and [EMIM]DCA) are compared. The comparison results are shown in Table 2 . Compositions of products are showed in Table S8. Extraction processes are showed in Fig. 11 . Under the operating conditions of minimum TAC, when [BMIM]OTF and [EMIM]OTF are used as extractants, they need to be supplemented. When [EMIM]DCA is used as extractant, it is unnecessary to be added. When [EMIM]DCA is used as extractant, TAC is minimum under C7 operation condition. According to the utilities in Aspen Plus, the electricity consumption is 52.32 kW/h. It is calculated as 8000 h per year. After calculation, the electricity cost for one year is 3.93 × 104 $/year. At last, the minimum value of TAC is 1.265 × 105 $/year. AOC is 8.06 × 104 $/year and TCC is 1.38 × 105 $/year. The relevant parameters and detailed calculation formula are listed in the Table S6. The thermal decomposition temperature of the ILs used in this paper are shown in the Table S7 [37–39]."
11,Conclusion,"Firstly, the formation of hydrogen bond between the selected ILs and IPA is analyzed from the perspective of mechanism. It is easy to form hydrogen bond between the selected ILs and IPA, which proves that IPA is the extracted substance. Through quantum chemical calculation, the bond length and bond energy between ILs and IPA can be used to analyze the force between molecules. The charge density and differential charge density between molecules can directly reflect whether there is hydrogen bond. Through computer calculation, we can analyze that the extraction effect is [EMIM]DCA > [BMIM]OTF > [EMIM]OTF. The results are consistent with general cognition which the energy of O-H⋯N is greater than O-H⋯O. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which provides a good idea for the selection of extractants. To prove the accuracy of the calculation results, liquid–liquid equilibrium experiments are carried out. The ternary systems of DIPE + IPA + ILs are measured at 298.15 K and 1 atm, and the experimental data of liquid–liquid equilibrium are obtained. D and S are calculated as indexes to evaluate the extraction effect. The experimental results show that the extraction effect of [EMIM]DCA is the best, which is consistent with the calculation results. Based on the experimental data and NRTL model, the binary interaction parameters are regressed, and then the process simulation is established. When [EMIM]DCA is used as the extractant, the minimum TAC is calculated. The tray number is 10 and S/F is 0.7. The results of simulation are consistent with those of calculation and experiment. The recycling of ILs as extractant provides a green and sustainable development method for azeotropic separation system."
