0,Introduction,"Usage of large quantities of polymers in household and industry has caused many problems related to waste management. Most of the conventional plastics are non-degradable and naturally occurring microorganisms can not decompose them into harmless substances. The replacement of the conventional nondegradable plastics by biodegradable [1,2] ones is the urgent task. Renewable resources are used increasingly in the production of biodegradable polymers with a wide range of properties and applications [3]. Fast increase of biodiesel production worldwide [4] leads to a huge quantity of glycerol as a by-product [5]. Converting glycerol into valuable chemicals and chemical intermediates [6] such as epoxides enables to obtain new types of biodegradable plastics. Epoxy resins are used as thermosetting materials in the range of industrial applications, such as printing inks, matrixes for composite materials, coatings, adhesives, varnishes, insulating, and embedding materials due to their excellent engineering properties, e.g. high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance, and versatility [7–9]. Properties of such thermosetting materials depend on the final state of the matrix obtained by curing process [10]. It is important to investigate curing kinetics in order to determine the final state of the obtained matrix and its properties. Good rheological properties, fast curing, low shinkage, and scratch resistance make epoxy resins useful in UV-curing reactions [11]. Photocationically-cured epoxy resins have considerably better thermal and mechanical properties than photopolymerized acrylates [12]. The main advantages of cationic UV polymerization is insensitivity to oxygen inhibition and low polymerization shrinkage [13–15]. Onium salts are generally used as UV-activated initiators for cationic photopolymerization [16]. Onium photoinitiators such as sulfonium salts [17] are important due to their thermal stability, solubility in most of the cationically polymerizable monomers [18]. Despite these advantages, cationically polymerized epoxy coats are often wrinkled. It was shown that this disadvantage can be avoided by using alcohols as modifiers of coating systems [19]. The effect of mono-alcohols and polymeric diols on the cationic photopolymerization of epoxides was extensively studied. However limited number of investigations of the effect of varying chemical structure and the amount of structurally different diols on cationic UV-curing of epoxides was reported [20–26]. Two effects of diol molecules on photopolymerization kinetics of epoxides can be distinguished. The addition of diol enhances the polymerization rate due to the chain transfer reactions through an activated monomer mechanism [27]. In addition, it can associate with proton, which leads to the decrease of the effective proton concentration, and thus inhibits photopolymerization [20]. In this study, glycerol diglycidyl ether was chosen as an epoxy resin which could replace diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, the most widely used monomer for cationic photopolymerization reactions with diols, expecting that the resulting polymers could be decomposed by naturally occurring microorganisms. To our knowledge, this is the first study of photopolymerization kinetics by photorheometry and the first study of biodegradability of the polymers obtained by photocross-linking with diols. Dependence of conversion of epoxy groups of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A on the reaction time was studied in details [21,22]. However no studies are available on the changes of the rheological and mechanical properties when a sample undergoes a liquid to solid transition during UV-curing in real time. In this study, four structurally different alcohols were selected for the investigation of the effect of their chemical structure and amount on the photocross-linking of glycerol diglycidyl ether and on the properties of the resulting polymers."

4,Chemical structure analysis,"2.3 Chemical structure analysis Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements of the photocross-linked polymers were performed on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX II FT-IR spectrometer, using KBr pellets. The spectra were acquired from 10 scans. The range of wavenumber was (400–4000) cm−1. Real-time FT-IR monitoring was performed using Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. The samples were irradiated by UV/Vis radiation in a wavelength range of (250–450) nm using UV/Visible spot curing system OmniCure S2000, Lumen Dynamics Group Inc. Intensity of radiation was 9.3W∙cm−2 (high pressure 200W mercury vapor short arc)."
5,Soxhlet extraction,2.4 Soxhlet extraction The amount of insoluble polymer fraction was determined by Soxhlet extraction. The samples of the cross-linked polymers (0.2g) were put into a filter package and placed in a Soxhlet apparatus. Extraction was performed with chloroform for 72h. Insoluble fractions were dried under vacuum to constant weight. The amount of insoluble fraction was calculated as a difference of the sample weight before and after extraction.
6,Kinetics of photocross-linking,"2.5 Kinetics of photocross-linking UV/Vis curing tests were carried out with MCR302 rheometer from Anton Paar equipped with the plate/plate measuring system. Peltier-controlled temperature chamber with the glass plate (diameter of 38mm) and the top plate PP08 (diameter of 8mm) was used. Measuring gap was set to 0.3mm. The samples were irradiated at room temperature by UV/Vis radiation in a wavelength range of (250–450) nm through the glass plate of the temperature chamber using UV/Visible spot curing system OmniCure S2000, Lumen Dynamics Group Inc. Intensity of the UV radiation was 9.3Wcm−2 (high pressure 200W mercury vapor short arc). Shear mode with the frequency of 1Hz was used. Strain of 2% was used in all cases. Storage modulus G′, loss modulus G″, loss factor tanδ (tanδ=G″/G′), and complex viscosity ŋ* were recorded as a function of irradiation time. Storage modulus G′, loss modulus G″, complex viscosity ŋ* values were taken after 10min of sample irradiation by UV/Vis irradiation."

The samples with the thickness of 0.2mm were used. Temperature was ramped from −20°C to 50°C at a rate of 2°C·min−1. Frequency of 1Hz and strain of 0.5% were used in all cases. Storage modulus G′, loss modulus G″, and loss factor tanδ were recorded as a function of temperature. Glass transition temperatures were defined by the maximum peaks of tanδ."
10,Dynamic mechanical analysis,2.9 Dynamic mechanical analysis Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of the photocross-linked polymers films was carried out using dynamic mechanical analyser Netzsch DMA 242C in the temperature range from −5°C to 50°C at a heating rate of 2°C·min−1. Tension mode with the oscillation frequency of 1Hz was used. Tests were performed with the samples of the following size: 10mm×5mm×0.3mm. Storage modulus E′ was recorded as a function of temperature.
11,Mechanical testing,2.10 Mechanical testing Mechanical properties of the photocross-linked polymer films were estimated by tensile test on a BDO-FB0.5TH (Zwick/Roell) testing machine at 22°C and 20% of relative humidity using the ASTM method D882 with some modifications. Strain of 1mm·min−1 was used in all cases. Mechanical testing was performed on dog bone shaped samples with the dimensions of 45mm×5mm×0.3mm. Arithmetic average of ten film samples of each batch was calculated. Results with variation below 5% within group were taken.
12,Calculation of density of cross-links,"2.11 Calculation of density of cross-links Density of cross-links (N) of the synthesized polymers was estimated according to the theory of rubber elasticity. The following equation was used: (1) σ = NRT λ − λ − 2 where σ is stress (MPa), N is the density of cross-links (mol/m3), R is the universal gas constant (8.314J·K−1·mol−1), T is temperature (K), λ is the strain value taken from the stress-strain curves obtained by the tensile test (the same λ=1.2% was taken for the calculation of the density of cross-links for all the synthesized polymers) [28]."
13,Biodegradability by soil burial test,"2.12 Biodegradability by soil burial test Biodegradability tests were carried out by soil burial test under laboratory conditions at (26±2) °C. The samples of the cross-linked polymers with the dimensions of (10mm×10mm×0.3mm) were weighed, placed into poly(vinyl chloride) bags, and buried into the soil for 3months. Five liter volume chambers filled with composting soil (pHKCl – 6.6; the moisture content (20−30) %) were used for biodegradability experiment. The samples were removed monthly, washed with sterile water, and weighed. Experiment was carried out in triplicates. Biodegradability of polymers was estimated according to their relative weight loss. For the estimation of soil microbial activity, cotton wool (1g) was buried and its mass loss made up 31% after 3months [29,30]."
14,Results and discussion,
15,Synthesis and characterization of photocross-linked polymers,"3.1 Synthesis and characterization of photocross-linked polymers The photocross-linked polymers were synthesized by the reaction of glycerol diglycidyl ether with different molar ratios of structurally different alcohols using 3mol% of photoinitiator. When such concentration of photoinitiator was used, the resulting films were transparent, and smooth. The synthesis of the cross-linked polymers C1–C12 is shown in Scheme 1 . The main functional groups of the photocross-linked polymers were identified by FT-IR spectroscopy. Absorption band of OH groups at (3347–3258) cm−1 which was present in the IR spectra of alcohols, decreased in the IR spectra of all polymers obtained from bathes C1–C12. The range of absorption band of epoxy group which was present at 985cm−1 in the IR spectrum of glycerol diglycidyl ether was covered by the wide shoulder absorption band of COC group in the IR spectra of all photocross-linked polymers. As an example, IR spectra of glycerol diglycidyl ether, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (1), and the photocross-linked polymer obtained from the batch C1 are presented in Fig. 2 . More informative was the real-time FT-IR monitoring of the photocross-linking process. UV-curing process from 0min to 10min revealed the decrease of intensity of epoxy group band at 985cm−1 and the increase of intensity of ether group band at 1085cm−1 in the IR spectra (Fig. 3 ). Formation of polymer cross-linked structure was confirmed by Soxhlet extraction experiment. The yields of insoluble fractions of the cross-linked polymers obtained from the batches C1–C12 after Soxhlet extraction with chloroform for 72h were in the range of (85–99) % (Table 1). The obtained values were similar to those described for UV-cured polymers of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (95–98) % [21]. The dependence of the yield of insoluble fraction on chemical structure and concentration of alcohols was observed. The yields of insoluble fraction exceeding 95% were observed for polymers obtained from batches C1–C6 with aliphatic alcohols, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (1) and 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)propane (2). Addition of aromatic alcohols to the batches led to the lower yields of insoluble fraction, probably due to their spatial hindarances. The lowest yields of insoluble fraction were observed for polymers obtained from batches C11–C12 with bisphenol A (4). The lower concentration of alcohol was used, the higher yield of insoluble fraction was observed in all cases. This observation indicates that the large number of protons released can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds [31] and the concentration of released protons could be a limiting factor for photopolymerization [20]. The values of the density of cross-links of the photocross-linked polymers C0–C12 were calculated according to the theory of rubber elasticity. The dependence of the density of cross-links on the concentration of alcohols was observed. The lower concentration of alcohol was used, the higher value of the cross-links density was observed."
16,Photorheometry,"3.2 Photorheometry Photorheometry is a powerful technique to monitor changes of rheological and mechanical properties such as viscosity and shear modulus during UV curing of materials [32]. Changes of storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″ as a function of irradiation time can be monitored in real time when a sample undergoes a liquid to solid transition [33]. It was observed that induction time and time to reach gel point (tgel) correlate with the density of cross-links of the synthesized polymers C0–C12. Time to reach tgel was shortened by the decrease of chain mobility. The time dependency of storage modulus G′, loss modulus G″, loss factor tanδ, and complex viscosity ŋ* during photocross-linking was monitored. Dependencies of G′, G″, tanδ, and ŋ* on irradiation time for the photocross-linking of batch C1 are presented in Fig. 4 . After an induction period (90s) G′, G″, ŋ* increased indicating growth of chains and network formation in the initial stage of photocross-linking (90–150s). G′ increased faster and exceeded G″ (91s) while tanδ started to decrease in the intermediate stage. The increase of the G′ value can be explained by the formation and consolidation of a three-dimensional network which is characterized by the transformation of a viscous fluid to an elastic solid. In this kind of transformation, the crossover point between G′ and G″ is commonly used to define the gel point [34]. During the late stage (150–600s), G′ and G″ continued to increase with time due to gel aging. All batches C0–C12 showed the same tendencies. Time dependencies of storage modulus G′ of batches C1–C3 with different concentrations of alcohol 1, and dependence of storage modulus of batches C1, C4, C7, C10 containing 10mol% of different alcohols 1–4 are shown in Fig. 5 . Rigidity of thermosetting resin is characterized by storage modulus [35]. The lower concentration of alcohol was used, the higher values of storage modulus were observed. This phenomenon could be explained by the participation of diol molecules in the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with the released protons leading to a decrease in the effective proton concentration and thus inhibition of photopolymerization [20]. As a result of this, more rigid structures of polymers were formed when the lower amounts of alcohol were used in batches. Photorheometry results showed that the lower concentration of alcohol was in batch the shorter induction period and gel time tgel, and the higher values of G′, G″, and ŋ* (Table 2 ) were observed. The decrease of concentration of alcohol lead to the increase of effective proton concentration, and thus accelerated photocross-linking and contributed to the formation of the more rigid network. Induction period of photocross-linking of batch C0 was significantly longer, and the reaction rate was lower in comparison with those of batches C1–C12 containing various amounts of alcohols. This observation shows that addition of alcohol can shorten induction period and accelerates photocross-linking of glycerol diglycidyl ether due to higher rate of epoxide ring-opening polymerization occurring via activated monomer mechanism in comparison to that of conventional active-chain-end epoxide ring-opening polymerization [36]. Gel time tgel of batches containing aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 was longer compared with that of batches containing aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2, probably due to the lower flexibility of the fragments aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 in the cross-linked structures."
17,Thermal and mechanical properties,"3.3 Thermal and mechanical properties DSC and DMTA analysis were performed to determine glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the photocross-linked polymers. The data of both methods confirmed that the photocross-linked polymers obtained from batches C0–C12 are amorphous materials. Only the glass transitions were observed for all polymers prepared. The Tg values estimated by DSC were found to be slightly different relative to those obtained by DMTA apparently because of the oscillating frequency effect in DMTA and the different heating rate used in both methods. The frequency effect changes molecular relaxations of polymer chains and provides different glass transition behavior [37]. The Tg value of polymer C0 was estimated by DSC found to be 8°C, while Tg, defined by the peak temperature of tanδ from DMTA curve was of 13°C. Tg of polymers C1–C12 containing alcohol fragments determined by DSC ranged from 7°C to 22°C (Table 1) while the Tg values estimated by DMTA ranged from 0°C to 18°C. The Tg values of polymers C7–C9 containing fragments of aromatic alcohol 3, as well as those of polymers C10–C12 obtained using aromatic alcohol 4 were higher than those of polymers C1–C3 and C4–C6 having fragments of aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2. The aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2 act as plasticizers and alter free volume within the polymer, thereby reduce the Tg value [38]. The Tg values of polymers C9 and C12 obtained taking 30mol% of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 are close to the Tg value of the product of photocrosslinking of batch C0 and Tg values decreases with increase of alcohol concentration probably due to the limiting factor of the released protons for polymerization [20]. The dependence of the Tg values on concentration of alcohol and thus on the density of cross-links was also observed. The lower concentration of alcohol was used, the higher density of cross-links and the higher Tg value were observed in all cases. The tanδ versus temperature curves of polymers C1–C3 obtained taking different concentrations of alcohol 1 and of polymers C10–C12 obtained taking different concentrations of alcohol 4 are presented in Fig. 6 . The maximum peaks of tanδ of polymers C1–C3 and C4– C6 having fragments of aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2 were shifted to the lower temperature values. This observation shows that fragments of aliphatic alcohols weaken the intermolecular interaction between the polymer chains, resulting in a decrease of Tg values. The peaks of tanδ of polymers C7–C8 and C10–C12 having fragments of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 were shifted to the higher temperature values compared with those of polymer C0 due to the presence of aromatic rings which restrict rotational freedom and increase Tg values [39]. TGA was used to study thermal stability of the photocross-linked polymers. TGA curves of thermosets obtained from batches C0–C12 are presented in Fig. 7 . The crosslinked polymers obtained exhibited high thermal stability. Their 10% weight loss temperatures (Tdec-10%) were in the range of (270–343)°C (Table 1). The TGA results indicated that Tdec-10% of the photocross-linked polymers increased with the decrease of alcohol concentration in batches. This observation can apparently be explained by the proton trapping effect [20]. The Tdec-10% values of the photocross-linked polymers C1–C3 and C4–C6 with the fragments of aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2 were higher than those of polymers C7–C9 and C10–C12 with the fragments of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 due to the higher amount of cross-linked moieties. Tdec-10% values of the photocross-linked films obtained from batches C1–C12 in most cases were lower than those observed for the polymer film obtained from C0 due to the proton trapping effect [20]. Thermal decomposition of all polymers proceeded in one step. The residue yield of polymers C7–C9 and C10–C12 with the fragments of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 were higher than those of polymers C1–C3 and C4–C6 with the fragments of aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2 and did not exceed 8%. Mechanical characteristics estimated by stress–strain test of the photocross-linked films obtained from batches C0–C12 are summarized in Fig. 8 . Elongation at break values were in the range of (9–79) % and were lower than those of commercial LDPE film values (200–900) % [40]. The tensile strength values of the photocross-linked films were from 7MPa to 23MPa and in most cases were lower than those observed for the polymer film obtained from C0. This indicates that alcohols can act as plasticizers and decrease the tensile strength [41]. The tensile strength values of photocross-linked films C0–C12 (7–23)MPa were in the same range as for commercial LDPE (7–17)MPa [40]. The higher elongation at break and tensile strength values in comparison with those of polymer film obtained from C0 were demonstrated by the films of the photocross-linked polymers obtained from batches C10–C12 having rigid aromatic fragments of alcohol 4. The values of Young modulus of the photocross-linked films prepared using structurally different alcohols were in the range of (127–468)MPa, i.e., were lower compared to those of the cycloaliphatic epoxy UVR6110 polymers (2500–4500)MPa [23], and were comparable with those of commercial LDPE film values (140–300)MPa [40]. The highest Young modulus values were observed for polymers C7–C9 and C10–C12 with the fragments of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4. A tendency of the increase of Young modulus and elongation at break of the cross-linked polymers obtained from batches C1–C12 with the increase of the density of cross-links was observed. However, no dependence of tensile strength on the density of cross-links was observed. The values of elongation at break, tensile strength, and Young modulus of the photocross-linked films with the fragments of aromatic alcohols 3 and 4 were higher than those of the photocross-linked films containing the fragments of aliphatic alcohols 1 and 2 due to formed higher amount of cross-linked moieties. The photocross-linked polymers were characterized by DMA in order to evaluate their viscoelastic properties. Temperature dependencies of storage modulus E′ of the photocross-linked films obtained from batches C0–C12 are shown in Fig. 9 . The addition of alcohols 1–4 into the batches resulted in the increase of storage (elastic) modulus E′ of the photocrosslinked polymers due to plasticizing effect [41]. The storage modulus value of the photocross-linked film obtained from batch C0 (500MPa) was lower compared with that of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A polymer (2200–2300MPa) [42], and storage modulus values of the photocross-linked films obtained from batches C1-C12 (1300–2500MPa) were close to those of to the cycloaliphatic epoxy polymers UVR6110 (3000MPa) [23], and lower compared to the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A polymers (8500–9000MPa) [21]. When temperature increases molecules gain more free volume resulting in more possibilities of molecular motions [43] and storage modulus E′ decreases. The values of storage modulus E′ of the photocross-linked film obtained from batch C12 containing aromatic alcohol 4 decrease with the increase of temperature but the storage modulus values of polymers obtained from batches C10, C11, and C0 start to decrease at ca. (10−20)°C. The storage modulus E′ values of the polymers obtained from batches C1, C4, C7 containing 10mol% of alcohols 1–3 were higher up to 20°C compared with E′ value of polymer obtained from batch C0. At 40°C, the storage modulus E′ values of the photocross-linked films obtained from batches C0–C12 were in the range of (1.42–19.17) MPa."
18,Biodegradability,"3.4 Biodegradability In order to evaluate biodegradability of the photocross-linked polymers obtained from batches C0–C12 the soil burial test in the period of 3months was performed. Mass losses of the photocross-linked polymers observed in the period of 1–3months are shown in Fig. 10 . Although aromatic rings are the most inhibitive moieties with respect of biodegradability [44], the total mass loss of the photocross-linked polymers containing fragments of structurally different alcohols obtained from batches C1–C12 was higher in comparison with that of the control sample (polymer obtained from C0). Polymers obtained from bathes C7, C8, C9 containing hydroquinone 3 fragments demonstrated the highest mass loss after 3months exposition in soil probably due to higher amount of species of fungi able to degrade hydroquinone. The previous studies showed that hydroquinone is readily biodegradable [45] and the following fungi species are able to degrade hydroquinone: Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida parapsilosis, Tyromyces palustris, Gloeophyllum trabeum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Phanerochaete chrysosporium [46–50]. While hydroquinone can occur naturally in many plant foods as glucose conjugate [51], bisphenol A is a synthetic compound that is widely used in production of plastics [52]. Despite of the presence of two aromatic rings there are bacteria and fungi species which can induce biodegradation of bisphenol A [53,54]. The higher amount of alcohol was used, the higher mass lost was observed. This can be due to the formed lower density of cross-links. The results of the soil burial tests showed that all the products of photo-crosslinking of glycerol diglycidyl ether and structurally different alcohols are biodegradable in natural environment."
19,Conclusions,"The effect of chemical structure and amount of four structurally different alcohols on photocross-linking of glycerol diglycidyl ether and on the properties of the resulting polymers was investigated. The amount of alcohol had the higher influence on polymer properties than its chemical structure. Investigation of kinetics of photocross-linking revealed that increase of concentration of alcohol resulted in the decrease of the rate of photocross-linking. Photocross-linking of glycerol diglycidyl ether with aliphatic alcohols proceeded with the higher rate than with aromatic alcohols. The amount of alcohol had more considerable effect on the thermal characteristics of polymers than the chemical structure of alcohol. The higher concentration of alcohol was used the lower glass transition temperature and lower thermal stability were observed. A tendency of the increase of Young modulus and elongation at break of the cross-linked polymers with the decrease of the amount of alcohol in the initial batches was observed. The polymers with aromatic alcohol fragments exhibited higher Young modulus and elongation at break values than the polymers with aliphatic alcohol fragments. The cross-linked polymers of glycerol diglycidyl ether with the fragments of structurally different alcohols were found to be biodegradable in natural environment. The addition of alcohols into the initial batches improved biodegradability of the polymers compared to that of the polymer containing no alcohol fragments. The obtained results demonstrate that mechanical, thermal, rheological properties, and biodegradability of the epoxy resins could be modified by adding structurally different alcohols to the batches."
