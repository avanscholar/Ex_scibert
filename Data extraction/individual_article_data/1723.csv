0,Introduction,"The global rise in population and economic development has put an unprecedented demand on energy supply. Improvement in human civilization and advancement in technology has more than doubled energy consumption per capita. The rise in energy demand is set to increase by 50% by the year 2030 and has put a strain on fuel sources that are becoming unable to keep up with the consumer demand in the public market and the industry [1]. Since the early dawn of industrialization, fossil fuels have played the role of the sole supplier for meeting our energy needs. Over the years, our growing dependency on fossil fuels has led to over-exploitation of the non-renewable resources causing depletion of the fossil fuel reserves and thereby dwindling the availability of the fuels. Moreover, scientists have identified fossil fuels as one of the main contributors to global warming [2]. The increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere due to fossil fuels has led to adverse environmental effects and has resulted in climate change [3]. With the escalation in weather catastrophes and rise in geopolitical conflicts, policymakers and scientists have now understood the danger of relying solely upon fossil fuels and therefore have commenced looking for alternatives that can ultimately replace fossil fuels and meet our rising energy demands [4]. Renewable energy sources have proved to be a highly viable alternative that can help curb carbon emissions and greenhouse gases released due to the utilization of fossil fuels. Scientists have claimed that the use of renewables can help protect the environment and assist in achieving energy security for the masses and ultimately give rise to a sustainable economy [5]. The major types of renewables that have gained popularity over the years include solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy. The use of renewables has increased most predominantly in the electricity and transport sectors. However, the lack of advancement in the prerequisite technology required for extensive adaptation of the energy sources has halted the growth of the renewable energy sector [6]. However, another renewable resource that has slowly risen to prominence and has been used significantly is biofuels. Compared to other renewable sources, biofuels have found more acceptances and have seen a rapid surge in their overall production especially in developed countries. Extensive research into optimizing and increasing the production efficiency of biofuels has made it one of the most consumed renewable energy resources [7]. Biofuels include fuels derived from biomasses and their residuals; containing energy acquired from atmospheric carbon fixation [8]. The ability to produce biofuels from various biomasses has made them highly accessible, reliable, and sustainable fuels. Moreover, properties exhibited by the biofuels with the likes of high energy content, low emissions of greenhouse gases with little to zero harmful effects produced on the environment has made them the most likely to replace fossil-derived fuels [9]. Biofuels, which are net-zero carbon emitters, have been categorized into four different types based on the feedstocks from which they are derived and their availability in the near future [1]. The development and production of ‘First generation’ biofuels provides CO2 benefits as well as encompasses the ability to blend with petroleum-based fuels partially, but the use of food crops such as sugarcane, corn, soya bean, and others have raised concerns with increasing food prices, competition in land use and effects on biodiversity along with the ‘food vs. fuel’ debate [10]. In comparison, ‘Second generation’ biofuels, although derived from plant biomass, primarily include lignocellulosic feedstocks such as agricultural and forestry residues, which are among the cheapest non-food materials available from plants in abundance. The use of lignocellulosic feedstocks provides several advantages, including complete replacement of petroleum-sourced fuels, non-existent competition with food sources, and rapid technological advancement that can ultimately reduce the overall costs of conversion and production of these ‘Second generation’ biofuels [11].‘Third generation’ biofuels are produced from algal biomass with a short harvesting cycle and high growth rate and require much lesser and simpler processing techniques for a much higher yield of the finished product [12]. Whereas ‘Fourth generation’ biofuels involve genetically modified algal biomass with features properties like improved photosynthetic efficiency, increased light penetration ability and significantly reduced photoinhibition, to achieve enhanced production of biofuels [13]. Some of the most common biofuels used most excessively and in high demand include bioethanol, biodiesel, biohydrogen, biogas and other synthetic biofuels [14]. In the past decade, biohydrogen (BioH2) has become one of the most promising low-carbon alternative fuels derived from renewable and sustainable energy sources [15]. Among all the other biofuels, BioH2 is considered one of the cleanest fuels with high energy efficiency. BioH2 can be easily produced from various types of waste biomass and other feedstocks. However, one of the significant problems that have plagued BioH2 production is its low yield [16]. Various biological processes have been used over the years for improved BioH2 production. Integration of microorganisms has been the most effective way to boost bioprocessing efficiency and enhance BioH2 production. The BioH2 produced has the highest energy density, produces no pollution, and has no negative impact on the environment [17]. The market demand for BioH2 has gone up steadily over the past few years and has received widespread attention as a next-generation energy carrier [18]. Recently, many studies have been carried out with a vast array of microorganisms by fixating on utilizing their metabolic and enzymatic activities to enhance BioH2 production. Remarkably, one of the common factors that have linked them all is using lignocellulosic feedstocks (LCFs) as the substrate. Many previous reviews have discussed general BioH2production from LCFs using different pretreatments as well as through photo- and dark fermentation and other hydrogen production pathways. However, to the best of our knowledge, the review based on enhancing BioH2 production utilizing and alternating different properties of microorganisms in the presence of LCFs as the substrate has been sparse. As a result, with this current review article we hope to provide an in-depth understanding and contribute a better insight into the process of enhanced BioH2 production from LCFs. This review article will focus on the different LCFs used for BioH2 production with a brief introduction to the properties and characteristics of the biofuel itself. The variety of microorganisms used in the production process, from biological pretreatment to different fermentation techniques, will be summarized and actions taken to enhance microbially assisted BioH2 production will be discussed in detail."
1,Biohydrogen – a novel renewable energy resource,"Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on the planet formed from water under natural conditions and is a non-toxic, colourless, odourless, and highly combustible gas in normal atmospheric conditions [19]. Along with being the lightest element, hydrogen produces water vapour during combustion and is highly efficient in its conversion to produce energy [20]. The clean and green nature of hydrogen has made it especially valuable in the electric and transportation sector. In addition, hydrogen has also found its use in various applications in the chemical industry, oil refineries, and other industrial processes. Globally, hydrogen is mostly produced using conventional processes that involve electrical, thermal, and biochemical methods and are extracted from fossil fuels like methane, oil, and coal [21]. With the shift to renewables and introduction of waste-to-energy technologies, synthesis of BioH2 has become an increasingly lucrative and sustainable option. A large amount of organic waste biomass generated every year has attracted scientists’ attention to develop methods to convert these natural biological energy sources into chemical energy [22]. Different technologies involving physical, chemical and biological processes have been investigated. Biological processes include the use of microorganisms to carry out reactions like pretreatment and fermentation (photofermentation and dark fermentation) [23]. The microorganisms used have their unique characteristics and the ability to decompose the complex waste and produce BioH2 simultaneously. Developing and utilizing the biological methods is highly cost-effective for industrial production of BioH2 and is the most significant way to reduce and eliminate the use and production of hazardous chemicals during the designing, manufacturing and application process [24]."
2,Lignocellulosic feedstocks – potentially sustainable sources for biohydrogen production,"The utilization and growing demand for biofuels have generated widespread interest in a biomass-based economy. Biomass has been one of the most attractive and sustainable renewable resources that can be obtained from plants, animals, and microorganisms and used to produce biofuels. These carbon-based feedstocks have the capacity to replace the current fossil-fuel based energy systems and the petrochemical products required for various applications across the industry [25]. Lignocellulosic biomass has been the most promising feedstock for the production of eco-friendly biofuels, biochemicals as well as carbon–neutral bio-materials [26]. It is a renewable woody feedstock and a highly abundant terrestrial plant biomass, which consists of non-edible plant materials and therefore produces no competition with food crops and agricultural lands. LCFs are harvested mainly from agricultural and forestry residues, although different industrial and municipal wastes also provide other potential sources [27]. Different types of LCFs exhibit different types of characteristics with regards to their appearance and strength, but they are mainly composed of three basic components which make up approximately 90% of their dry weight. These are the homopolymeric cellulose (35–55 wt%), heteropolymeric hemicellulose (20–40 wt%), and lignin (10–25 wt%) (Fig. 1 . The lignocellulosic polymers are linked with each other and form a mesh-like network through the formation of specific bonds between them, and play a role in providing both the physical appearance and the strength of the various LCFs [28]. The main component cellulose is a crystalline polysaccharide made up of D-glucose subunits linked together by β −1,4 glycosidic bonds, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers available on earth and forms the basic building subunit of the plant cell walls. The long unbranched polymeric chains that makeup cellulose readily form microfibril structures that remain packed together with inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, allowing the formation of either a crystalline or amorphous structure. In comparison, hemicellulose is a complex and branched polysaccharide made up of heterogeneous mixtures of hexoses, pentoses and sugar acids which are all linked together by the much weaker α - and β -glycosidic bonds. The composition of this complex carbohydrate varies from hardwood to softwood structures, and is mainly responsible for forming cross-links with the cellulosic microfibrils and lignin. The final component which completes the structure of LCF is lignin – a recalcitrant heteropolymer composed of phenylpropanoid subunits linked together by aryl-ether (C-O-C) and carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds to various quantities. It is made up of three monolignol monomers, namely p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, which together are responsible for the formation of lignin precursors which are p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl and syringyl units that constitutes the phenylpropane subunits. The branched, polymeric and cross-linked structure of lignin provides structural rigidity and impermeability to the entire lignocellulosic polymer, therefore making it extremely hard to extract the cellulose and hemicellulose for the production of fermentable sugars [29-31]. Recently, LCFs have been adopted for biohydrogen production due to the presence of a high concentration of carbohydrates in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose. The most common LCFs used are corncobs, corn stover, corn stalk, switchgrass, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, and wheat straw (Table 1 [29,31]. However, the complexity of the LCFs prevents the utilization of the lignocellulosic materials, making it impossible to produce BioH2. Therefore, in order to digest or remove the lignin polymer, and increase the digestibility of the cellulose and hemicellulose during fermentation, several pretreatment processes including physical, chemical and biological methods have been developed. Physical pretreatment operations are costly and require a high energy input, whereas chemical methods requires not only hazardous chemicals but also produces toxic compounds that have a negative impact on the environment. In comparison, biological pretreatment process involves microorganisms and utilizes the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignin which is more efficient and needs low energy input and has ultimately proven to be a cost-effective method with a wide range of applications and a higher yield of the final product [32]. The removal of the lignin polymer by the naturally occurring microorganisms not only help in the production of lignocellulosic BioH2 after proper fermentation reactions but also help in the production of several value-added products."
3,Lignocellulosic biohydrogen production process,The less energy intensive and environment friendly properties have made the biological process for BioH2 production to be highly beneficial. The utilization of microorganisms and their natural biochemical machinery has been proven to play an important role in the bioconversion of LCFs to BioH2. The biological processes employed during BioH2 production include the biological pretreatment process followed with either a photofermentation (PF) or dark fermentation (DF) reaction (Fig. 2 . Table 2 summarizes the major differences between the three biological processes that are employed for lignocellulosic BioH2 production.
4,Biological pretreatment,"4.1 Biological pretreatment In biological pretreatment, ligninolytic microorganisms or enzymes are used for the depolymerization of LCFs. This first step towards BioH2 production acts as a precursor to the subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation reactions. Biological pretreatment of biomass primarily involves four distinct techniques, such as (i) pretreatment using microorganisms (e.g., fungal and bacterial), (ii) pretreatment using microbial consortium, (iii) ensilaging, and (iv) pretreatment using enzymes [33]. The microorganisms that are utilizedde polymerize lignin by secreting extracellular ligninolytic enzymes involved in catalysing various biochemical reactions. The microbial inoculum subsequently grows on the biomass and ultimately results in lignin degradation. However, the incubation time and depolymerization rate varies from microbes to microbes and sometimes ranges from weeks to months [32]. In order to avoid this, enzymes are purified from bacteria and fungi, which are then used directly for the pretreatment technique. Although, enzymatic production and optimization along with purification may prove to be costly, thus increasing the overall costs of the process. The use of microbial consortia greatly reduces the pretreatment time and is advantageous due to improved hydrolytic efficiency, high adaptability, and increased substrate utilization rate. The synergistic action of the enzymes produced from different species of bacteria and fungi together is particularly effective to bring about lignin degradation [34-36]. Ensilaging is another advanced technology developed for biological pretreatment which involves the use of anaerobic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria resulting in the breakdown of macromolecules producing different organic acids and preventing microbial contamination. But factors like biomass composition, microorganisms and dry matter content, greatly affect the final yield in the ensilaging process [33]. Biological pretreatment is a highly effective and efficient method, although more detailed investigation is required in order to decrease the overall time required for the process."
5,Dark fermentation,"4.3 Dark fermentation DF is performed in the absence of sunlight by utilizing obligate or facultative anaerobes to produce hydrogen from organic substrates and waste biomass [35]. Pretreatment of biomass followed by hydrolysis produces reducing sugars which are used as substrates for the anaerobic production of hydrogen, and other high-value intermediates such as carbon dioxide, organic acids, and alcohol [39]. The hydrogenase enzyme system carries out the oxidation of electrons along with subsequent reduction of protons to produce hydrogen [40]. Pyruvate is a key metabolite produced during the anaerobic fermentation process for hydrogen generation, which can be further enzymatically converted to acetyl CoA. Other notable metabolites produced in the fermentation process are acetic acid and butyric acid alongside the hydrogen gas [41]: C6H12O6 + 2H2O 2CH3COOH + 2CO2 + 4H2 In comparison to PF, DF is highly advantageous as it is inexpensive, requires less maintenance, with no light source, and requires smaller bioreactors [37]. However, a major stumbling block in this fermentation process has been the substrate’s organic load, which is not fully converted during the reaction process, thus resulting in a low hydrogen yield [39]."
6,Engineering of microorganisms for enhanced biohydrogen production,"LCFs have always been deemed as the most sustainable source for the generation of BioH2. Moreover, the integration of microorganisms for successful hydrolysis and fermentation of LCFs has received tremendous attention in the recent years in order to boost BioH2 production in an economically cost-effective way (Fig. 3 . This is why it is highly essential to focus on the wild type and recombinant microbial strains responsible for the efficient bioprocessing of LCFs to BioH2."
7,Biological pretreatment,"5.1 Biological pretreatment In the biological pretreatment method, the cellulose and hemicellulose counterparts in the biomass get hydrolysed into monomeric sugars and simultaneously degrade the lignin polymer. Microorganisms used solely for the biological process secretes a wide range of enzymes that fall into three categories: cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic, and ligninolytic enzymes. Mainly ascomycetes and basidiomycetes fungi and several bacteria have been identified to possess the enzymes required for the hydrolysis of LCFs [42]. The most common bacterial strains which have proved to be highly efficient in the pretreatment process belongs to the Clostridium sp., Cellulomonas sp., Bacillus sp., Thermomonospora sp., and Streptomyces sp., etc. Some notable cellulolytic bacteria that have been extensively studied for their high cellulase production are Cellulomonas fimi and Thermomonospora fusca. Other bacterial strains such as Azospirillum lipoferum and Bacillus subtilis have been identified to produce the ligninolytic enzyme laccase which can carry out lignin depolymerization [32]. Recently, there has been an increased interest in screening for extremophiles due to their much faster pace of BioH2 production from LCFs [43]. The newly isolated thermophilic strain Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain F6 produced 1822.6 and 826.3 mL H2/L of hydrogen using corn cob and sugarcane bagasse respectively [44]. Another study utilized a thermophilic consortium consisting of Thermoanaerobacterium sp., Clostridia sp., and Geobacillus sp., for production of BioH2 from prairie cordgrass. Optimized treatment conditions of the biomass by the consortium increased the hydrogen production from 1.07 mmol H2/g to 2.2 mmol H2/g of the biomass [45]. In addition to bacteria, fungi also possess distinct lignocellulolytic enzymes for LCFs degradation. The various species of fungi used for biological pretreatment includes ascomycetes (e.g. Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., and Trichoderma sp.) as well as basidiomycetes (e.g. Schizophyllum sp., and Fomitopsis palustris) [32]. The most studied ligninolytic enzymes producing fungi are Phanerochaete chryosporium and Pleurotus sp. Fungi have been really useful for their ability to degrade the lignin polymer directly without any help. Several mixed cultures of fungi have been grown together in order to increase the lignin depolymerization rate [46]. The extracellular production of most enzymes has led to the utilization of crude enzyme lysates and pure enzymes directly onto the LCFs. Newly identified thermostable laccase from the fungus Trichoderma asperellum strain BPLMBT1 has been able to remove approximately 76.93% of lignin from sweet sorghum stover biomass resulting in 402.01 mL of BioH2 production, which was found to be 3.26-fold higher in comparison to control which didn’t have any form of enzymatic pretreatment [47]. Overall, biological pretreatment has turned out to be an increasingly attractive and sustainable process for BioH2 production. 5.1.1 Use of different additives Decreasing the microbial treatment time and simultaneously increasing the final yield of BioH2 has always been the main focus of the biological pretreatment process. This has resulted in the addition of different types of additives ranging from chemical to biological along with the microbes during the pretreatment method for rapid degradation of the LCFs in order to produce biohydrogen (Table 3 . In a study, a combination of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphide was used along with the crude enzyme lysate produced by the Streptomyces sp. MDS for the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. This not only resulted in a higher yield of reducing sugars amounting to 592 mg/g but subsequent hydrolysis using the microbial strain Clostridium beijerinckii KCTC1785 led to a cumulative hydrogen production of 1485 mL/L with a production rate of 61.87 mL/L/h [48]. Cumulative addition of 0.75% Triton X-100 and 15 mM of sodium carbonate with the bacterium Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27,405 utilizing waste date seeds as the substrate, led to a 40.6% increase in the total hydrogen yield [49]. In another study, a co-culture formed between the hydrolytic microbe Clostridium cellulovorans and the fermentative microbe Clostridium acetobutylicum led to a 2- to 3-fold improvement in BioH2 production using wheat straw as substrate [50]. Another enhancement study involved the use of microorganisms present in bovine ruminal fluid in presence of Clostridium acetobutylicum resulting in the yield of greater than 40 g/L glucose from agave biomass ultimately leading to a total yield of 150 L of hydrogen per Kg of the biomass [51]. In comparison, corncob treated with 2% sulphuric acid before the addition of bovine ruminal fluid with Clostridium acetobutylicum were able to produce 575 mL of hydrogen which was equivalent to 132 L H2/Kg of biomass [52]. Hydrogen production from the organic fraction of the municipal solid waste pretreated with Bacillus subtilis in a combination of bacteria/sludge ratio of 0.25 led to a volumetric hydrogen production of 564.4 ± 10.9 mL [53]. The thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum W16 was used for the pretreatment of corn stover hydrolysate by mixing the inoculum with three different types of seed sludge – which were rotten corn stover, cow dung compost and sludge from anaerobic digestion. Hydrogen yield increased from 8.78 to 9.17 mmol H2/g utilized sugar in presence of rotten corn stover, 8.18–8.42 mmol H2/g utilized sugar in presence of cow dung compost, and 8.55–9.17 mmol H2/g utilized sugar in presence of sludge. Analysis on the microbial communities that dominated this different sludge turned out to be mostly Thermoanaerobacterium spp. and Clostridium spp. which are predominantly responsible for BioH2 production [54]. Moreover, a combination of the thermo-anaerobic bacteria Ruminiclostridium thermocellum strain M3 with domestic sewage sludge increased the cumulative hydrogen production in a variety of LCFs like rice straw (0.66–6.42 mmol H2/g substrate), corncob (0.61–5.55 mmol H2/g substrate), and pine wood waste (0.58–5.32 mmol H2/g substrate) [55]."
8,Photofermentation,"5.2 Photofermentation In PF, BioH2 production is carried out by the purple non-sulphur photosynthetic bacteria which grows under anaerobic or microaerobic conditions, and has the capacity to use a wide range of organic compounds as their substrates. The most common photosynthetic bacteria used for BioH2 production belongs to the Rhodobium sp., Rhodobacter sp., Rhodospirillum sp., and Rhodopseudomonas sp., out of which the Rhodobacter species have been extensively studied and widely used for photofermentative hydrogen production [56-58]. In a recent study, Rhodobacter sphaeroides was used for BioH2 production by photofermentation using brewery waste. It was observed that R. sphaeroides had a higher growth rate in the presence of diluted brewery waste which resulted in a ∼ 2.5 fold increase in hydrogen production [59]. Use of Rhodopseudomonas pseudopalustris DSM 123 on tequila vinasses produced 860 mL H2/L during PF reactions [60]. Single-stage PF process carried out with Rp. palustris on the sucrose-based wastes i.e. sugar beet molasses have a maximum of hydrogen productivity of 0.55 mmol/L h [61]. Newly isolated R. capsulatus produced a hydrogen yield of 1.96 mol H2/moles sugar under optimized conditions using raw sugarcane bagasse as the main feedstock [62]. A novel photosynthetic bacterial strain identified as Rubrivax benzoatilyticus TERI-CHL1 produced 86.4 mmol/L of cumulative hydrogen under optimized conditions from spent effluent with a 75% H2 yield efficiency [63]. A co-culture of photosynthetic bacteria containing Rs. rubrum, R. capsulatus and Rp. palustris produced hydrogen with a maximum yield of 642 ± 22 mL using starch based agricultural residues as substrates [64]. Utilizing the cellulolytic bacterium, Cellulomonas fimi in combination with Rp. palustris on low-cost cellulosic substrate generated hydrogen with a yield of 44 mmol H2/L at the highest substrate concentration of 5 g/L [65]. A mixed consortium of photosynthetic bacteria containing 27% Rs. rubrum, 25% Rp. capsulate, 28% Rp. palustris, 9% R. sphaeroides, and 11% R. capsulatus(HAU-M1), was used for hydrogen production from corn stover biomass with separate saccharification photofermentation (SSP) and separate hydrolysis photofermentation (SHP) methods. The consortium gave a hydrogen yield of 83.87 mL H2/g corn stover with SSP method that was 27.8% higher than that of SHP [66]. 5.2.1 Use of different additives Extensive research into several photosynthetic bacteria has revealed that crucial factors like pH, lighting conditions, substrate concentrations, chemical and biological additives, and different biological pretreatment conditions, enhances BioH2 production via the PF process utilizing LCFs (Table 3. A study reported that the photosynthetic bacteria Rp. palustris mediated hydrogen production was affected in presence of different lighting conditions and a variety of carbon sources. Incandescent light led to an increased rate of cell growth followed by enhanced hydrogen yields of 1.58, 4.92 and 2.57 mol H2/mol when acetate, butyrate and lactate were respectively used as carbon sources [67]. In comparison, a mixture of succinate and acetate as a carbon mixture with the bacterium R. sphaeroides MDC6521 enhanced the hydrogen production approximately ∼ 2–3 fold with a cumulative yield of ∼ 6.5 mmol H2/g of biomass [68]. Co-digestion of duckweed and corn straw biomass with the HAU-M1 microbial consortium in the presence of a high carbon to nitrogen ratio (5:1) enhanced the final hydrogen yield from 78 mL/g of biomass to 85.6 mL/g of biomass [69]. Change in pH also has an effect on photofermentative hydrogen production. The HAU-M1 consortium produces hydrogen from biomass in presence of potassium phosphate buffer with pH values ranging from 5 to 7. pH 6.5 produced the maximum hydrogen production rate that was 23.96 mL/h in comparison to the rate of 5.59 and 5.42 mL/h produced in presence of pH 5 and 7.5 respectively [70]. In comparison, a pH 6 sodium phosphate buffer led to an increase in conversion efficiency by 9.84% with a hydrogen yield of 132.69 mL/g of corn stalk using the HAU-M1 consortia [71]. In another study, increasing the temperature optima of a Rp. palustris strain to 40 °C enhanced the hydrogen production upto ∼ 4 fold as compared to 300C [72]. Addition of the catalysts zeolite and kieselguhr separately to the HAU-M1 consortia increased the hydrogen yield from corn stalk by 33.33% and 15.93% respectively, in comparison to control [73]. A correlation was also found between glycerol addition and hydrogen production in HAU-M1 consortia. Utilizing Arundo donax L. as a substrate, the consortia enhanced hydrogen production by 294% in presence of 15 g/L of optimal glycerol concentration [74]. Even the presence of basalt fiber has been observed to promote bacterial growth and enhanced the bioconversion rate of corn straw by 5.23% with a maximum hydrogen yield of 323.94 mL [75]. Another study reported, the addition of compounds such as syringaldehyde (0.03 g/L) to steam explosion hydrolysate of brewers spent grain in the fermentation media of Rp. palustris CGA009 enhanced BioH2 production by 1.4 fold to 960 mL, in contrast to vanillin-containing media [76]. Addition of the photocatalyst nano-TiO2 (300 mg/L) to the HAU-M1 consortia produced significant effects on the photo-fermentative hydrogen production from corn straw. Nano-TiO2 promoted the metabolism of butyric acid and acetic acid and reduced the concentration of intermediary products. This resulted in an increase in the cumulative hydrogen volume by 32.6% along with the maximum hydrogen production rate and average hydrogen content by 27.9% and 8.3%, respectively in comparison to the control [77]. Although the use of photocatalytic nanoparticles has recently been identified to impact the production of BioH2 using photosynthetic bacteria, research with photofermentative reaction utilizing LCFs has been sparse. 5.2.2 Use of genetic engineering Genetic engineering has been a powerful tool to utilize for the photofermentative bacteria in order to enhance the BioH2 production process. Different methods have been employed to produce mutant strains of naturally occurring photosynthetic bacteria and increase the production yield of BioH2 (Table 4 . In a recent study, a mutant strain (Hup- ) of the bacterium R. sphaeroides HY01 was generated which increased the growth rate and enhanced the hydrogen production rate up to 4.62 mol H2/mol of reducing sugar generated from maize straw hydrolysate [78]. The growth in presence of NH4Cl was repressed in case of a double deletion mutant generated from R. sphaeroides HY01 (cbbR-, pycA- ); whereas the growth as well as the hydrogen yields of a transposon mutant with an inactivated pycA gene (cbbR-, Δ pycA) was enhanced by 2%, 10.5%, and 26.8% in the presence of 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM NH4Cl respectively. The hydrogen production rates were also improved by 15.9%, 6.2% and 46.1% in presence of the three concentrations of NH4Cl [79]. A mutant of the R. capsulatus strain JL1 with a cheR2 gene deletion changed its pH from faintly acidic to weakly alkaline condition, and gave a maximum hydrogen yield of 4406.7 ± 45.9 mL/L and 54.1 ± 1.6 mL/L in presence of acetate and butyrate as direct carbon sources, which accounted for an enhancement of 36.3% and 12.3% over the wild type strain. With corn stalk hydrolysate as a substrate, the mutant generated hydrogen up to 224.85 ± 5.18 mL-H2/g of biomass which resulted in a 171.43% increase in comparison to the wild type strain [80]. A temperature-tolerant mutant strain of R. capsulatus MX01 exhibited an increased hydrogen production at a higher culture temperature of 33° C and light intensity of 5000 lx. Using corn stalk hydrolysate, the mutant strain had an enhanced BioH2 yield of 3.64 ± 0.18 mol-H2/g of biomass and a production rate of 40.07 ± 1.70 mmol-H2/(h.g-cornstalk) along with an energy conversion efficiency of 10.6% [81]. Another ammonium-tolerant mutant strain of R. capsulatus strain WH02 was produced through transposon mutagenesis. Batch experiments with optimized ammonia concentration (2–8 mmol/L) showed an increased hydrogen yield by 3.74 folds. With sugarcane bagasse containing high ammonium concentration (87.94 ± 2.22 mmol/L) the maximum hydrogen production amounted to 153.96 ± 1.98 mL-H2/g of the bagasse along with an energy conversion efficiency which increased by 10.95%, thereby making it highly feasible to produce BioH2 from LCFs containing high ammonium [82]."
9,Dark fermentation,"5.3 Dark fermentation In DF, the type of microorganism used plays an essential parameter as the hydrogen yield consecutively depends on the bacterial metabolism. A wide variety of obligate and facultative anaerobes are used for the DF reaction. Although cocultures are mostly used but pure cultures make it easy to discern any metabolic shift that might takes place while utilizing LCFs as substrates for BioH2 production. The most extensively studied anaerobes belong to the Clostridium sp., such as C. butyricum, C. acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, and C. thermocellum. Clostridium sp. is the most dominant hydrogen producing bacteria in the DF process. Some facultative anaerobes which are also capable of producing hydrogen are E. coli, E. cloacae, and E. aerogenes, among others [83,84]. Other lesser known bacteria used for hydrogen production through the dark fermentative process includes Bacillus subtilis, the lactic acid bacteria – Cellulomonas, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and some thermophilic archaea like Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and Thermotoga neapolitana [85]. 5.3.1 Use of different additives Similar to PF, the microorganisms utilized for the DF process has also been characterized on the basis of several additive factors which bring about the amplified BioH2 generation while using various LCFs as substrates (Table 3. Research into the addition of a dilute acid treatment in between a two-step DF process revealed the additional step plays a potential role in hydrogen production. Sweet sorghum stalks were used as the substrate for carrying out the fermentation process using the C. thermosaccharolyticum bacterium. After the initial step of the fermentation with the biomass, a 1 h treatment with dilute sulphuric acid at an optimum concentration of 1.5% (w/v) at 120° C with 10 g/L of substrate increased the production of hydrogen by 76%, acetic acid by 84%, and butyric acid by 113%. The total yield after the two-step process amounted to 5.77 mmol/g-substrate of hydrogen, 2.17 g/L acetic acid and 2.07 g/L butyric acid [86]. In a study, microbial communities present in seed sludge were used directly for BioH2 production from grass (Lolium perenne L.). Addition of Fe2+ significantly improved the microbial activity on the biomass as well as enriched hydrogen producers, making Clostridium sp. the dominant bacteria. Moreover, Fe2+(400 mg/L) also increased the utilization of organics by the hydrogen producers from 15.9% to 20.6%. This subsequently led to an increased yield of BioH2 production from 48.7 mL/g-dry grass in the control group to 72.8 mL/g-dry grass in Fe2+ added group, which was relatively 49.6% higher [87]. Biochar, produced by the thermal decomposition of carbonaceous biomass, has generated research interests as a suitable additive for improving the performance of the anaerobic digestion during dark fermentative reaction and influencing hydrogen production. In a study it was observed that biochar boosted hydrogen production by 317.1% in the presence of pretreated sugarcane bagasse and a heat-shocked consortium derived from sewage sludge. Biochar was found to stimulate bacterial growth especially that of cellulolytic Lachnospiraceae, and improve critical enzymatic activities and manipulate the NADH/NAD+ ratio, thereby increasing the electron transfer efficiency of the fermentation system [88]. Another study proposed quite an innovative approach to utilize biochar in the hydrogen production process. Biochar, derived from residue cornstalk that was left after BioH2 production, was implemented on cornstalk along with the thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum M18. After 96 h of fermentation, the BioH2 production rate increased from 3.5 to 5.7 mL H2/g substrate/h, and the hydrogen production potential was enhanced from 156.2 to 286.1 mL H2/g substrate, resulting from increased cellulolytic enzyme activity which subsequently promoted a highly efficient substrate conversion to BioH2 [89]. BioH2 production was also found to be affected by change in pH. When a two-step dark co-fermentation was carried out using a mixed culture by utilizing 80% tequila vinasse and 20% nixtamalization wastewater (w/w), it was observed that reducing the pH from the first step (pH 6.5) to the second step (pH 5.8) reduced the operational time along with enhancing the hydrogen production by 17%. This pH shift also induced the syntrophy between Clostridium and Lactobacillus while reducing the proliferation of Blautia and Propionibacterium, thereby increasing the efficiency of BioH2 conversion [90]. Detoxification carried out with activated carbon (1% p/v) on the hydrolysates of Agave tequilana bagasse, using an anaerobic granular sludge as the microbial source for carrying out the fermentation process, promoted the removal of acetic acid by 89% with minimal losses of fermentable sugars and increasing the hydrogen yield by 33% in comparison to the undetoxified biomass [91]. Cell immobilization carried out with Enterobacter cancerogeous HG6 2A and E. homaechei 83 at a ratio of 0.9:1 on activated carbon improved the yield of BioH2 by 259% in comparison to the system where cell suspension was used, proving immobilization to be a highly effective method for amplifying hydrogen production [92]. To increase the quality and quantity of the produced hydrogen from DF reactions utilizing LCFs as substrates, another prominent external alterations that have been introduced to conventional fermentation reactions are inorganic nanoparticles such as silver, iron, nickel, and titanium oxide, etc., metal oxide nanoparticles such as Fe2O3, NiCo2O4, CuO, ZnO, and CoO, etc., and nanocomposites along with graphene-based nanomaterials among others, which have been studied for their role in influencing different parameters which are involved in enhancing BioH2 production [93,94]. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used in a DF process involving the bacterium E. aerogenes and the substrate date-palm fruit wastes in a recent study. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were added in a fermentation media, whereas date seed activated nanocomposites formed with Fe3O4nanoparticles were added to another fermentation media, in comparison to control where no nanoparticles were added. Optimal dosage of 150 mg/L and fermentation time of 24 h revealed a maximum hydrogen yield of 238.7 mL/g in the nanocomposites containing media which was found to be 65.7% higher than the media containing only the nanoparticles, along with a cumulative ∼ 3 fold increase in the total yield compared to control, implying use of nanocomposites could have significant impact in the industrial applications that are concerned with BioH2 production [95]. 5.3.2 Use of genetic engineering The use of genetic engineering for producing recombinant strains through over-expressing or activating genes of interest in order to enhance hydrogen production during the fermentation process has been deemed to have great potential for industrial applications. The majority of genetic modifications have been limited to the Clostridium sp., Enterobacter sp., and E. coli [96]. But the use of these mutant strains for BioH2 production involving LCFs as substrate has been very few (Table 4. Besides modifying genes of interest, use of nuclear irradiation to produce mutants of hydrogen-producing bacteria has been another promising method. Irradiation with 60Co γ -rays produced mutants of E. aerogenes which enhanced the hydrogenase activity. This led to the increase in production of hydrogen yield by 81.8% more than the wild type strain. The mutant had a hydrogen production rate of 27.2 mL/(L.h) which was higher by 40.9% [97]. In another study, irradiated mutant of E. aerogenes enhanced the hydrogen yield by 31.8% from acid pretreated biomass of Alternanthera philoxeroides [98]. In order to lay emphasis on enhanced BioH2 production through DF, several novel molecular techniques like restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR), fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), and next generation sequencing (NGS) are being used in order to perform extensive research into the genes and the associated metabolic pathways in the microorganisms for efficient generation of BioH2 [99]."
10,Future perspectives,"The urgent need to replace fossil fuels for reducing carbon emissions has made BioH2 a very attractive biofuel. Nonetheless, hydrogen is mostly synthesized from fossil fuel sources to meet the need for industrial applications. Use of alternative methods for hydrogen production especially from renewable sources has become highly essential to meet future needs and demands. Lignocellulosic-based BioH2 generation using microorganisms is steadily becoming one of the emerging technologies which are highly sustainable. Use of biological pretreatment, photo- and dark fermentation methods represents environmentally friendly and sustainable approaches for production of biohydrogen. Extensive research has been made into the three biological methods in order to develop and improve the yield and production rate of hydrogen production but only in laboratory scale. Therefore more research is required to (1) make these methods economically feasible and highly efficient, (2) to develop a common and effective saccharification technology for all feedstocks, (3) to isolate more microorganisms that have the capability to carry out the efficient production of reducing sugars from the biomass, (4) reduce the treatment time required for the biomass saccharification, (5) and to have a detailed understanding of the genes and the metabolic pathways involved in the processes for a robust production of BioH2 required for industrial applications (Fig. 4 . Developments in integrative biorefinery approaches are also required to commercialize the biological processes, amplify the BioH2 production from lab scale to industrial scale, and produce more value-added products for their utilization in the industry [41,100,101]."
11,Conclusion,"The studies carried out in recent years with lignocellulosic-based BioH2 production have revealed the prospects as well as the limitations of the biological methods. It has also shed light on the improvements that are absolutely required in order to develop this nascent technology in an industrial scale. This review article reported on the biological pretreatment, photo- and dark fermentation methods utilized for BioH2 production with LCFs as substrates. Several key external factors and engineering methods used on the microorganisms for enhancing BioH2 production were discussed. The methods in combination have the ability to become one of the key alternative technologies for the advancement of BioH2 production. Therefore, it is highly crucial to continue doing extensive research to increase the efficiency, yield, and productivity rate of BioH2 production. Constant tracking and analysis of the biological systems could help overcome the limitations that hinder the use of this technology on a wide scale. The prospect of producing hydrogen from renewable sources could help to improve the techno-economic aspects of green energy."
