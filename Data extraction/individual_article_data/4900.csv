0,Introduction,"The direct synthesis of chemicals and fuels from CO2 attracts more and more interest since CO2 is an abundant, non-toxic and inexpensive carbon source [1]. Many attempts have been made for the reduction of CO2 such as the conversion to formic acid [2] and methanol [3], however, the reductive transformation of CO2 generally requires a large energy input since CO2 is the most oxidized compound of carbon [1a]. On the other hand, non-reductive transformation of CO2 to carbonate [4] and carbamate [5] is attractive since these reactions are energetically-favorable and as a result require less energy input. In particular, organic carbonates are plausible synthetic targets from the viewpoint of green sustainable chemistry for their low toxicity, non-corrosivity and biodegradability [6]. In addition, carbonates have been widely used as starting materials of polycarbonate resins [7], electrolytes of lithium ion battery [8], alkylating and carbonylating reagents [9], and inert solvents [6a]. Moreover, they are expected to be fuel additives in the future [10]. Organic carbonates have been traditionally produced by using phosgene or its derivatives [11]. However, this production process has considerable drawbacks such as use of highly toxic phosgene and co-production of large amount of salts by the neutralization. Some alternative routes have been developed such as oxidative carbonylation of alcohols [12], alcoholysis of ureas, [13] and transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with alcohols [14]. The reactions using organic reagents such as alkyl halides [15] and the electrochemical methodology have been also reported [16]. In contrast, catalytic process to directly synthesize organic carbonates from CO2 and alcohols will be a promising methodology since water is the sole by-product and CO2 is used as the carbon resource. In addition, some alcohols can be derived from biomass in the biorefinery [17]. For example, ethanol can be produced by the fermentation of starch or cellulose [18]. 1-Propanol can be also prepared by the hydrogenolysis of glycerol that is a major by-product in the biodiesel production from vegetable oils [19]. A typical target of organic carbonate synthesis is DMC from CO2 and methanol (Eq. (1)). (1) Various homogeneous [20] and heterogeneous [21] catalysts have been developed for this reaction, and our group has reported that ZrO2 [22a,22b], H3PO4/ZrO2 [22c,22d], CeO2–ZrO2 solid solutions [22e,22f], and CeO2 [22g] work as heterogeneous catalysts. However, DMC yield based on methanol is low (e.g., DMC yield 2.1% under the conditions of dibutyltin dimethoxide catalyst, CO2 300atm, 453K, 24h [1d]) and far from satisfactory due to the equilibrium limitation of Eq. (1) [20–23]. In order to improve the low DMC yield, several attempts have been made for removal of co-produced water from the reaction media, shifting the chemical equilibrium to the carbonate side [20a–f,21a–c,24,25]. In particular, it has been reported that effective dehydrating reagents for removal of water were acetal, carbodiimide and epoxide, affording high yields based on the dehydrating reagents. For examples, Bu2Sn(OMe)2/2,2-dimethoxy propane (DMP) [26], CuCl/dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), [20d] and ZrO2–KCl–Mg/butylene oxide [21a] systems provided 88%, 83%, and 49% DMC yields based on the dehydrating reagents, respectively. However, DMC yields based on methanol were very low (2%, 6%, 7%, respectively). From the viewpoint of DMC purification, complete conversion of methanol, that means high methanol-based DMC yields, is highly desirable since methanol and DMC form an azeotrope [27]. However, DMC yields based on methanol in the literatures were below 50% so far [1b]. Recently, we have found that the combination of CeO2-catalyzed carboxylation of methanol and CO2 and hydration of 2-cyanopyridine (CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system) drastically improves the DMC yield up to 94%, where the DMC yield in the absence of 2-cyanopyridine is only 0.7% [24a]. In this reaction system, hydration of 2-cyanopyridine gives 2-picolinamide, which is also catalyzed by CeO2 (Eq. (2)) [28]. (2) Toward the expansion of this catalyst system, we continued fundamental studies on the applicability and the reaction mechanism. This paper, thus, reports that various carbonates can be synthesized from CO2, and the corresponding alcohols in the presence of CeO2 and 2-cyanopyridine since the syntheses of carbonates except for DMC have hardly been reported and the yields based on alcohols are far from satisfactory (Table S1). In addition, the reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of kinetic and isotopic studies, physicochemical analyses, and DFT calculation."

2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation Preparation of CeO2 catalyst was carried out by calcining commercially available cerium oxide HS (Daiichi Kigenso Kogyo Co. Ltd., Japan) for 3h under air atmosphere at 873K. The calcination temperature was optimized on the basis of the catalytic performance in the reaction of methanol+CO2 with 2-cyanopyridine [24a]. The BET surface area of calcined CeO2 was 84m2 g−1."
3,Activity tests,"2.2 Activity tests All the reactions were carried out in an autoclave reactor with an inner volume of 190ml. A typical procedure of the reaction of CO2 +methanol with 2-cyanopyridine was as follows: 0.34g of CeO2 catalyst, 0.64g of methanol (20mmol, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 99.8% min.), and 10.4g of 2-cyanopyridine (100mmol, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., 99.0% min.) were put into the autoclave together with a spinner, and then, the reactor was purged and pressurized with CO2 (Shimakyu Co. Ltd., >99.5%). Gas line was closed, and then, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature. The time when the temperature reached the desired reaction temperature is defined as zero reaction time. The mixture was constantly stirred during the reaction. After the specific reaction time, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the gas was collected. Ethanol (30ml, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 99.5% min.) and 1-hexanol (0.2ml, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., 98.0% min.) were added to the liquid phase as a solvent and an internal standard substance for a quantitative analysis, respectively. Products in the liquid and gas phases were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph equipped with FID (Shimadzu GC-2014) and GC–MS (Shimadzu QP-2020) with a CP-Sil5 capillary column (length 50m, i.d. 0.25mm, film thickness 0.25μm). For the synthesis of various carbonates from CO2 and the corresponding alcohols, the procedures are the same as the case of the reaction of CO2 +methanol with 2-cyanopyridine. After the reaction time, 30ml of ethanol or acetone (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 99.5% min.) was added to the liquid phase as a solvent, and 0.2ml of 1-hexanol or 1-propanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 99.5% min.) was added to the liquid phase as an internal standard substance for a quantitative analysis. The products in the liquid and gas phases were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with an FID or quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC–MS) using a CP-Sil5 capillary column (length 50m, i.d. 0.25mm, film thickness 0.25μm) or TC-WAX capillary column (length 30m, i.d. 0.25mm, film thickness 0.25μm)."
4,Catalyst characterization and DFT calculation,"2.3 Catalyst characterization and DFT calculation The surface area of CeO2 was measured with BET method (N2 adsorption) using Gemini (Micromeritics). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu Ka (40kV, 40mA) radiation. The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) data were collected under air using a Shimadzu DTG-60. A sample with the weight of 10mg was charged into a Pt pan, and subsequently heated from room temperature to 873K at a heating rate of 10K/min. DFT calculations of acidity and basicity were performed at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level using Gaussian 03 program package."

7,Results and discussion,
8,Substrate scope of carbonate synthesis from CO2 and alcohols,"3.1 Substrate scope of carbonate synthesis from CO2 and alcohols Various carbonate syntheses in the reaction of CO2 +alcohol were examined over CeO2 with 2-cyanopyridine. Alcohol conversions and DMC yields based on alcohol are shown in Table 1 . Moreover, conversions and yields in hydration of 2-cyanopyridine are also shown in Table 1. Excess amount of 2-cyanopyridine was applied to achieve the high carbonate yields, although we have already reported that DMC can be obtained with 94% yield based on methanol even in the presence of stoichiometric amount of 2-cyanopyridine [24a]. The produced amide, 2-picolinamide, can be separated from the reaction mixture by extraction and can be readily restored to 2-cyanopyridine by dehydration of 2-picolinamide over Na2O/SiO2 catalyst [24a,24e]. Saturated linear alcohols (Entries 1–8) reacted to afford the corresponding carbonates in high yields (85–96%). It seems that the reactivity of alcohols decreases with longer alkyl chain. Note that the longer chain alcohols (C2–C10), which are generally less reactive than methanol [15a,15b], were converted without loss of selectivity. The obtained yields based on alcohol are much higher than those reported in the literatures: the highest yields for ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol are 21% [24b], 17% [24b], and 3% [29], respectively. In addition, this paper is the first report on direct carbonate syntheses from CO2 and 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, and 1-decanol. Furthermore, the reactions of unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol (Entry 9) and β-methallyl alcohol (Entry 10) proceeded to afford the corresponding carbonates in 76% and 51% yields, respectively. In the previous literature, allyl alcohol gave only 12% yield of the corresponding carbonate [20d], and there is no report on β-methallyl alcohol. Sterically-bulky alcohols such as 2-methyl-1-propanol (Entry 11), benzyl alcohol (Entry 12), and cyclohexanemethanol (Entry 13) were also transformed to the corresponding carbonates in 60%, 74%, and 49% yields, respectively. There is no report on cyclohexanemethanol. The other carbonate yields are much higher than those in literatures (2-methyl-1-propanol: 7% [30] yield and benzyl alcohol: 5% yield [24b]). The reaction of 2-propanol (Entry 14), a secondary alcohol, gives the corresponding carbonate in 33% yield, which is higher than that of the previous report using benzonitrile as a dehydrating reagent (13% yield) [24b]. However, the present yield is much lower than those of primary alcohols. This tendency will be due to a steric hindrance rather than the thermodynamic limitation because DFT calculation (B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), Table S2) showed that the energy change in the carbonate formation from CO2 and 2-propanol (9.6kJmol−1) is much smaller than that in hydration of 2-cyanopyridine to 2-picolinamide (−123.1kJmol−1). In all the reactions, less than 1mmol of alkyl carbamate (<5% yield based on alcohol) and almost the same amount of alkyl picolinate as alkyl carbamate were detected as by-products. The formation of alkyl picolinate is attributed to the reaction of 2-picolinamide with alcohol (Eq. (3)), which co-produces NH3. The further reaction of dialkyl carbonate with the product NH3 gives alkyl carbamate (Eq. (4)). (3) (4) As above, the reaction system composed of CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine is quite effective for direct high-yield synthesis of various carbonates from CO2 and alcohols. This catalyst system was denoted as CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system in the following study."
9,Effect of reaction conditions,"3.2 Effect of reaction conditions At first, the time dependence in DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol was studied as a model reaction with CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system. Fig. 1 shows the results of time course under the standard conditions. The patterns of product distribution are almost the same as those reported in the previous paper [24a] using stoichiometric amount of 2-cyanopyridine. DMC was rapidly formed; 8.1mmol of DMC was formed in 2h and the initial turnover frequency (TOF) on the basis of total number of Ce is calculated to be 2.0h−1. Based on the number of Ce cations on the surface of CeO2 (1.07mmolg−1) [28], TOF based on the surface Ce atom is 11h−1. DMC amount increased with increasing the reaction time and reached 9.6mmol, which corresponds to 96% DMC yield based on methanol. The turnover number (TON) based on total Ce and surface Ce atoms can be calculated to be 2.7 and 26. The high DMC yield in the present CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system is mainly attributed to two reasons. The first one is that hydration of 2-cyanopyridine also proceeded to provide the corresponding amide stoichiometrically, resulting in complete removal of water from the reaction media and elimination of the limitation of chemical equilibrium. The second one is the property of 2-picolinamide. According to our previous works [24], amides that are produced by hydration of nitriles can inhibit the reaction. It should be noted that 2-picolinamide, which is the hydration product from 2-cyanopyridine, had no influence on the reaction. These effects will be discussed in Section 3.3. Next, the effect of dehydrating reagents was examined. In this experiment, the molar ratio of methanol to nitrile was set to be large in order to compare the reaction rate precisely. The results are shown in Table 2 . Without addition of any nitriles, the DMC yield under these conditions was 0.024% (Entry 15), which is far below the equilibrium (0.7%). The effect of nitriles was similar to the reported data [24a] which were obtained under stoichiometric ratio of methanol to nitrile and long reaction time. Addition of 2-cyanopyridine (Entry 1), pyrazine-2-carbonitrile (Entry 2), and 2-cyanopyrimidine (Entry 3) drastically increased the DMC yield up to 1.4%, 3.2%, and 1.8%, respectively. Among these nitriles, 2-cyanopyridine showed the highest selectivity to the amide (94%). However, in the case of the other effective nitriles, the amide yields and selectivities were lower probably because of the side reactions such as reaction of the nitriles with methanol or decomposition of the nitriles. These results indicate that the addition of 2-cyanopyridine neither inhibits the reaction nor causes by-products. In contrast, the DMC yield was hardly improved in the presence of other nitriles (Entries 4–14). Although the structure of 2-pyridineacetonitrile (Entry 12) is similar to 2-cyanopyridine, DMC was hardly formed. According to the previous report, the hydration rate of 2-pyridineacetonitrile is quite low [28], which indicates that the distance between CN group and N atom in pyridine ring is important. This is probably due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the produced amide as described in the latter Section 3.3. These results and the reported data [24a] show that nitriles having a CN group at the 2-position relative to N atom of 6-membered ring heteroaromatics are effective as dehydrating reagents in DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol over CeO2. From these results, 2-cyanopyridine is the most effective dehydrating reagent, and the combination of CeO2 with 2-cyanopyrdine is the best system for the synthesis of organic carbonates. And also, these data show that DMC formation rate was enhanced by adding effective nitriles. Fig. 2 shows the initial time courses of DMC formation by CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system. DMC formation rates in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system are estimated from the slopes of approximate curves to be 75 and 2.3mmolg−1 h−1, respectively. As well as DMC yield [24a], the DMC formation rate was drastically enhanced by addition of 2-cyanopyridine. The effect of CO2 pressure was investigated in the ranges from 0.1 to 5MPa, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . DMC yield increased with increasing CO2 pressure. Moderate yield (61%) of DMC was obtained in the presence of 1MPa of CO2, and higher yield (82%) was achieved using 5MPa of CO2. Under low CO2 pressure (0.1–1MPa), methyl pyridine-2-carboximidate was detected as well as methyl picolinate and methyl carbamate. Methyl pyridine-2-carboximidate can be formed according to Eq. (5). (5) Actually, the formation of methyl pyridine-2-carboximidate was confirmed by the reaction of 2-cyanopyridine and methanol at 393K under Ar atmosphere catalyzed by CeO2 (Table S3). In contrast, the yields of methyl picolinate, methyl carbamate, and methyl pyridine-2-carboximidate were decreased with increasing CO2 pressure. These by-products are produced by addition of alcohol as shown in Eqs. (3)–(5), and alcohol is known to be activated on acid–base pair sites of CeO2 [31,32]. Taking into consideration that CO2 can be strongly adsorbed on the acid–base pair sites of CeO2, high pressure CO2 will suppress the formation of these by-products by covering the active site of CeO2. The formation of these compounds is not favorable for DMC synthesis since the addition of 1–5mmol of methyl picolinate and methyl carbamate decreased the DMC formation rate (Table S4). Fig. 4 shows the effect of the reaction temperature in the range from 373 to 413K. DMC yield reached the maximum at 393K. In the range of 373–393K, DMC yield was increased with increasing the reaction temperature. In contrast, DMC yield was decreased with increasing the reaction temperature above 393K. On the other hand, yields of by-products such as methyl carbamate and methyl picolinate were also increased above 393K, which indicates that over-reactions and side reactions take place more easily at higher temperatures. As these by-products suppress the formation of DMC, the optimal reaction temperature is determined to be 393K."
10,Reaction mechanism of carboxylation of methanol and hydration of 2-cyanopyridine,"3.3 Reaction mechanism of carboxylation of methanol and hydration of 2-cyanopyridine In order to clarify the role of 2-cyanopyridine and the reaction mechanism of CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, kinetic and isotopic studies, physicochemical analyses and DFT calculation were conducted. As mentioned above, this reaction consists of two consecutive steps (Scheme 1 ): (1) carboxylation of methanol with CO2 and (2) hydration of 2-cyanopyridine. First, hydration rate of 2-cyanopyridine was measured by adding small amount of water in the present reaction conditions to determine which step is the rate-determining step. Here, 2-picolinamide and methyl picolinate were observed as products. The hydration rates were estimated by the total amount of 2-picolinamide and methyl picolinate because methyl picolinate is produced by the reaction of 2-picolinamide with alcohol (Eq. (3)). Fig. 5 shows the hydration rates as a function of amount of water, and the detailed data are shown in Fig. S1. The reaction rates were increased proportionally with increasing the amount of water, giving a good linearity between hydration rate and amount of H2O. Therefore, the hydration rate in smaller amount of water can be estimated by exploration of the correlation line. The amount of H2O in the actual reaction media will be almost zero because the hydration of 2-cyanopyridine effectively proceeds in this reaction system. Hence, 2-cyanopyridine hydration rate can be estimated to be at least 206mmolg−1 h−1 by the y-intercept of Fig. 5, which is much larger than the DMC formation rate in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system (74mmolg−1 h−1) under the similar reaction conditions. Therefore, hydration of 2-cyanopyridine proceeds even under low water concentration, and the rate-determining step is not hydration of 2-cyanopyridine but carboxylation of methanol with CO2. Next, the mechanism of carboxylation of methanol with CO2 by CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system was investigated. The kinetic studies about CO2 pressure, amount of methanol and reaction temperature were carried out, and the results were compared with those in only CeO2 system. DMC formation rates in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system were estimated by straight-line approximation below 30% of methanol conversions (Figs. S2–S4). On the other hand, in only CeO2 system, DMC formation rates were estimated at methanol conversion lower than 0.1% since the equilibrium conversion of methanol is 0.7% in the CO2 +methanol reaction. The effect of CO2 pressure on DMC formation rate was investigated in the range of 0.5–5MPa as shown in Fig. 6 (the details are shown in Fig. S2). DMC formation rates in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system are almost constant under any CO2 pressure, indicating that CO2 pressure does not influence the DMC formation rate. This tendency in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system is similar to the case of only CeO2 system. Fig. 7 shows the effect of amount of methanol on DMC formation rate, and the details are shown in Fig. S3. In CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, the reaction order with respect to amount of methanol is nearby 1, which indicates that methanol is associated with the rate-determining step. This reaction order is also similar to that in only CeO2 system. Fig. 8 shows the Arrhenius plots for CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system, and the details are shown in Fig. S4. The activation energies in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system are estimated to be 72 and 73kJmol−1, respectively, and the frequency factors for CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system are estimated to be 9.8×1011 and 2.1×1010, respectively. From the above kinetic studies for CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system and only CeO2 system, the dependence of DMC formation rate on CO2 pressure and amount of methanol were almost the same in both systems, suggesting that the reaction mechanism of CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system will be the same as that of only CeO2 system. The reaction mechanism of DMC formation from methanol and CO2 over CeO2 has already been proposed based on the data of in situ FTIR [22g]. In situ FTIR analyses were carried out with methanol and/or CO2 by changing CO2 pressures (0.1, 0.5, 5MPa). The reaction mechanism is as follows (Scheme 2 ): (i) methanol is dissociated on CeO2 to form two types of methoxy adspecies on CeO2 (terminal methoxy adspecies (CH3O–Ce) and bridged methoxy adspecies). This is supported by the previous reports on methanol adsorption over CeO2 by FTIR [31,32,28]. (ii) Adsorbed CO2 on CeO2 is not inserted to bridged methoxy adspecies but to terminal methoxy adspecies (CH3O–Ce) to form Ce-methyl carbonate adspecies as shown by that terminal methoxy adspecies on CeO2 were quickly decreased even when 0.1MPa CO2 was introduced. The Ce-methyl carbonate adspecies can be regarded as an important intermediate for the reaction. (iii) DMC is formed by the reaction between Ce-methyl carbonate and another methanol on CeO2, which is the rate-determining step. Therefore, the reaction mechanism of CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system will follow this reaction mechanism. In the above reaction mechanism, the rate-determining step is the reaction of methanol with Ce-methyl carbonate adspecies on CeO2, which is supported by the results of the effect of methanol amount (Fig. 7). However, the detailed mechanism for the rate-determining step is not sufficiently elucidated, and two mechanisms have been proposed on CeO2 as follows (Scheme 2): (i) nucleophilic addition of methoxy species to Ce-methyl carbonate species and (ii) electrophilic addition of methyl species to Ce-methyl carbonate species [22g,24,33]. In order to confirm which of these two mechanisms is true, the reaction test was conducted using 18O-labeled methanol. Based on that a molecular weight of unlabeled DMC is 90, if the nucleophilic addition of methoxy species to carbonate adspecies would be the main route, the intensity of mass number (m/z) 94 is more strongly detected than that of 92 (Scheme 3 -(i)). In contrast, electrophilic addition of methyl species gives the opposite tendency (Scheme 3-(ii)). In CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, at 31% conversion of CH3 18OH, the intensity ratio of m/z =94 to m/z =92 was 4.2 (the mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 9 ). This result indicates that two methoxy species of DMC are mainly derived from methanol (Scheme 3-(i)). The same results were obtained in only CeO2 system (the intensity ratio of m/z =94 to m/z =92 was 3.6 at 0.8% conversion (Fig. S5). Therefore, this step proceeds via nucleophilic addition of methoxy species to Ce-methyl carbonate species on CeO2. The mechanism of the nitrile hydration was also examined. From the results of the effect of water amount (Fig. 5), the reaction order with respect to amount of water is 0.8 (Fig. S6). Taking into consideration that water can be easily dissociated to OH species and proton on CeO2 [28], addition of OH species on CeO2 to nitrile will be the rate-determining step in nitrile hydration. On the other hand, the effective nitriles have the following structure: CN group is at the 2-position relative to N atom of 6-membered ring heteroaromatics. In addition, the basicity of pyridine is higher than that of CN group. Since CeO2 has only Lewis acid sites as acid sites, 2-cyanopyridine is adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of CeO2 at the N atom of heteroaromatics. These reaction tendencies are almost the same as those in hydration of 2-cyanopyridine over CeO2 in water proposed in the previous reports [28], where the hydration proceeds via adsorption of 2-cyanopyridine followed by addition of OH species on CeO2 to the nitrile group of 2-cyanopyridine. Therefore, in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, hydration of 2-cyanopyridine will proceed in the same manner. Finally, the influence of the amide, which is produced by hydration of nitrile, was studied. In order to achieve high yields of carbonates from CO2 and alcohols using nitrile as a dehydrating reagent, the weak interaction of the corresponding hydrated products, amide with CeO2 surface can be essential. In our previous work, DMC synthesis over CeO2 with benzonitrile as a dehydrating reagent afforded low DMC yield (47%) [24b], implying deactivation of CeO2 by covering the CeO2 surface with the produced amide. In contrast, in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, high yield (96%) was achieved. In order to clarify the difference of dehydrating ability between 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile, XRD, BET surface area, and TG-DTA analyses were conducted. XRD and BET surface area analyses were examined using CeO2 before and after the reaction with 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile (Fig. 10 ). BET surface areas and XRD profiles were unchanged before and after the both reactions with 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile, which suggests that the structure of CeO2 is very stable under the reaction conditions and nitriles give no influence on the structure of CeO2. Next, TG-DTA analyses were conducted using CeO2 before and after the reaction with 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile (Fig. 11 ). CeO2 before the reaction showed weight loss of about 0.14mg (∼1.4wt%), but hardly showed an exothermic signal, suggesting that adsorbed H2O or CO2 on CeO2 will be desorbed (Fig. 11-(a)). Similarly, CeO2 with 2-cyanopyridine presented almost the same tendency (weight loss ∼0.18mg) (Fig. 11-(b)). In contrast, CeO2 with benzonitrile provided larger weight loss of about 0.36mg (∼3.6wt%) and a large DTA signal around 500K. The signal can be assigned to the corresponding amide [24a,24b]. Assuming that all the weight loss except the weight loss of fresh CeO2 is derived from the corresponding amides, the amount of adsorbed amides on CeO2 with 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile were calculated to be about 0.5 and 2.8μmol/m2 -CeO2, respectively. Considering that 2.6μmol/m2 -CeO2 of CO2 can be adsorbed on CeO2 [34], benzamide will cover the entire adsorption sites of CeO2 surface. In addition, in FTIR spectra of CeO2 after the reaction of CH3OH+CO2 +C6H5CN the intensities of the bands assigned to benzamide increased with increasing the reaction time (Fig. S7). These results indicate that 2-picolinamide is hardly adsorbed on CeO2, in contrast, benzamide is more strongly adsorbed than 2-picolinamide. In addition, these results are supported by the addition experiments of 2-picolinamide and benzamide in the reaction media as described below (Table 3 ). A small amount of benzamide completely blocked the active sites of CeO2. However, 2-picolinamide has no influence on the reaction. Furthermore, as previously reported [24a], CeO2 can be recycled at least three times without loss of activity and selectivity. The difference of dehydrating ability between 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile can be attributed to the difference of adsorption properties between the corresponding amides (2-picolinamide and benzamide). The amide can be adsorbed on the acid and/or base sites of CeO2, which will be the active ones of CeO2 for carboxylation of alcohol and hydration of nitriles. Therefore, acidity and basicity of the amides will influence the adsorption strength on CeO2. Acidity and basicity were calculated by DFT calculations using these amides and the related compounds, benzoic acid, picolinic acid, and acetamide for acidity, and piperidine, pyridine, and acetamide for basicity. The relation between acidity/basicity of the compounds and the reaction rates was examined. Table 3 lists DMC formation rate in the reaction of methanol and CO2 with additives and the energy change in deprotonation of the additives calculated by DFT. Here, acidity of compounds is lower with increasing the value of the energy change. In the absence of any additives, DMC formation rate is 2.3mmolg−1 h−1 (Entry 6). Addition of carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid (Entry 1) and picolinic acid (Entry 2) completely suppressed the DMC formation (∼0.0mmolg−1 h−1), and the energy changes in deprotonation are+1448 and+1467kJmol−1 for benzoic acid and picolinic acid, respectively, which are regarded as strong acidic compounds. In addition, DMC was not detected even in the presence of benzamide (Entry 3), where the energy change in deprotonation is+1511kJmol−1. On the other hand, the addition of 2-picolinamide (Entry 4) and acetamide (Entry 5) did not affect DMC formation rate, showing higher energy changes in deprotonation of+1549 and+1564kJmol−1, respectively, which means that the acidity of these amides is comparatively low. Therefore, the strong acidic compound is a strong catalyst poison for the reaction. Table 4 lists the relation between the DMC formation rate and the energy change in protonation of additives, where the basicity of compounds is higher with decreasing the value of energy change. In the absence of any additives, DMC formation rate is 2.3mmolg−1 h−1 (Entry 6). Addition of piperidine did not give DMC (Entry 1) and the value of energy change in protonation of piperidine is −989kJmol−1, which represents strong basicity. In contrast, the addition of pyridine (Entry 2) did not show any effect on DMC formation rate, and the value of energy change in protonation is −966kJmol−1 and the basicity of pyridine is lower than that of piperidine. However, addition of benzamide completely prohibited the DMC formation (Entry 3), which can be explained by its acidity as shown in Table 3. The addition of 2-picolinamide (Entry 4) and acetamide (Entry 5) has no effect on DMC formation rate and these compounds are much less basic than pyridine and benzamide. These results indicate that basicity of benzamide does not mainly contribute to the poisoning of CeO2. From these results, acidity of benzamide mainly influenced the deactivation of CeO2, and this is connected to the strong basicity of CeO2. It is well known that carboxylic acid can be adsorbed on CeO2 as a form of carboxylate by proton extraction of carboxyl group. The proposed adsorption models of 2-picolinamide and benzamide are shown in Scheme 4 . Extraction of H atom of the amide group in 2-picolinamide is difficult because of an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between H atom in the amide group and N atom of the pyridine ring (Scheme 4-(a)) [35] because of low acidity of 2-picolinamide. On the other hand, extraction of H atom of the amide group in benzamide will be easy by the basic sites of CeO2 to form stable amide anion species on CeO2, which will be very stable on CeO2 (Scheme 4-(b)). As a result, the difference of dehydrating ability between 2-cyanopyridine and benzonitrile can be attributed to the difference of adsorption strength on CeO2 between the corresponding amides, 2-picolinamide, and benzamide. The difference of adsorption strength is generated by the difference of acidity between the amides, which can be derived from the presence or absence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between H atom of amide group and N atom of pyridine ring. Based on these results and discussion, the proposed mechanism is shown in Scheme 5 . The cycle of methanol carboxylation begins with the adsorption of methanol (A). Methanol is adsorbed on CeO2 and forms CH3O–Ce species (i). CO2 is successively inserted into CH3O–Ce and gives Ce-methyl carbonate species (ii). Another methanol is adsorbed on CeO2 to give CH3O–Ce species (iii). Nucleophilic addition of methoxy species of CH3O–Ce to provide DMC, which is confirmed by the experiment using 18O-labeled methanol, and CeO2 is regenerated (iv). On the other hand, the cycle of 2-cyanopyridine hydration is as follows (B). 2-Cyanopyridine interacts CeO2 with N atom in pyridine ring (vi). Cyano group of adsorbed 2-cyanopyridine is attacked by OH species on CeO2 and to form 2-picolinamide adspecies (vii). 2-Picolinamide species can be rapidly desorbed from CeO2 surface (viii). If water exists in the reaction media, water is easily dissociated on CeO2 (v), The rate determining step of the whole system is nucleophilic addition of methoxy group to carbonate adspecies on CeO2. Considering that the reaction rate was enhanced in CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system, 2-cyanopyrdine will play an important role of activating methanol or carbonate adspecies on CeO2. We are now investigating the details of the rate enhancement mechanism."
11,Conclusion,"CeO2 +2-cyanopyridine system is effective for the synthesis of organic carbonates from CO2 and alcohols, and various organic carbonates can be obtained in high yields (up to 96% yield). Although carbonate yields are generally limited by the reaction equilibrium, addition of 2-cyanopyridine drastically improved the carbonates yields by removal of water from the reaction media. Investigation of various nitriles as dehydrating reagents revealed that the effective nitrile as a dehydrating reagent is one having a CN group at the 2-position relative to N atom of 6-membered ring heteroaromatics. The adsorption of the produced amides on CeO2 can poison the active sites of CeO2. However, the amides produced from effective nitriles can form an intramolecular hydrogen bonding between H atom in amide group and N atom in pyridine ring, which leads to reduction in the acidity of the amides and makes the adsorption on CeO2 weak. According to kinetic studies in the presence and absence of 2-cyanopyridine, the reaction mechanism is unchanged and 2-cyanopyridine works as an excellent dehydrating reagent. The hydration of 2-cyanopyridine is very fast and carboxylation of methanol with CO2 proceeds via two times nucleophilic addition of methoxy group on CeO2. The rate determining step is the nucleophilic addition of second methoxy group to Ce-methyl carbonate species, which is supported by the reaction using 18O-labeled methanol."
