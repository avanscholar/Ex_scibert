0,Introduction,"Molecules containing fluorine possess unique but important physicochemical properties due to its small size and most electronegative nature [1–5]. The bond length of CF group (1.35 Å) is longer as compared to CH group (1.09 Å). The dipole moment of CF group is higher (1.85 Debye) than its CH analogue (0.3 Debye) due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. The direction of the dipole moment of CF group is opposite to CH group [6]. The strength of CF group is 14 kcal/ mol higher than CH group [2,6]. The unique properties of fluorine containing molecules have been utilized extensively in the development of medicines [7,8] and agrochemicals [9–11]. Fluorine containing drug molecules are regularly being used in the treatment of central nervous system and oncology [12–21]. Indeed, it has been shown that fluorinated solvents can serve as artificial blood substitutes for the patients having cancer-induced anemia and hypoxia [22–26]. Extensive research has been devoted for the development of fluorine containing drug molecules as it enhances the biological activity, metabolic, and binding affinity to protein [21]. The substitution of fluorine alters the physicochemical properties by affecting the chemical reactivity, stability of neighboring functional groups, pKa and dipole moment. Fluorination of drug molecules modulates the lipophilicity, acidity and decreases the conformational bias causing increase in the drug penetration inside the nucleus and thereby improving their pharmacological properties [27–29]. Importance of fluorine substituted drug molecules can be noticed with the monotonic increase in the number of fluorinated molecules used either for clinical trials or approved for the cure of several diseases. Indeed, the best selling drug molecules in the market mostly contain fluorine [30,31]. Moreover, fluorinated molecules have also been used for the 19F based contrasting agents for magnetic resonance imaging which is a very useful technique for the medical intervention [32–36]. Apart from the drug development, fluorinated molecules have been used extensively as polymers [37,38], reaction media [39–45], catalyst [4,46–49] and in separation techniques [50]. Fluorinated polymers depict spectacular thermal and chemical resistance, low friction coefficients which makes them useful for several applications such as biomedicines, artificial muscle actuators, microfluidics and in tissue engineering [51–60]. Fluorinated solvents have been used vigorously in organic reactions to increase the selectivity and yield of the product [61–63]. Fluorocarbon substituted amino acids have been used in protein engineering to understand the increased stability of protein induced by fluorocarbon group [64–69]. Fluorinated amino acid analogues have been successfully engineered into proteins in order to understand the water–protein interaction which controls many processes such as enzyme catalysis, unfolding and interaction with other molecules [70–73]. Zewail and co-workers had studied the effect of side chain volume and fluorination on solvation dynamics by the incorporation of 5, 5, 5- trifluroroleucine in place of leucine in a protein. It was concluded that fluorination of amino acid causes to generate electrostatic force on proximal water molecules which in turn slow down the motion of water on the protein surface resulting in slower solvation dynamics [74]. In other studies, the tryptophan of monellin was replaced by 5-fluoro tryptophan to understand the contribution of the pseudo-time dependent fluorescence Stokes shift in the solvation time scale [75]. It was found that the higher electron affinity of 5-fluoro tryptophan suppresses the electron transfer quenching significantly as compared to the tryptophan due to which the solvation time scale of 5-fluorotryptophan is dominated by relaxation rather than pseudo-time dependent fluorescence Stokes shift. Krishnamoorthy and co-workers have shown that the replacement of tryptophan with 5-fluorotryptophan decreases the lifetime heterogeneity in proteins [76]. In another study, the activity of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was investigated by replacing the noncanonical amino acids of inhibitor with fluorinated ones [77–79]. It was found that fluorine of the trypsin inhibitor combines with water molecules and restores the inhibitory activity to a mutant having corresponding hydrocarbon chain at the same site. Meech and coworkers investigated the spectroscopic properties of fluorine substituted chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and found that the substitution of fluorine causes barrier less proton transfer in the excited state of the chromophore of green fluorescent protein [80,81]. It is apparent that the substitution of fluorine enables to understand several complex biological phenomena such as water-protein interaction, enzymatic activity and excited state properties of proteins. Hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon, both are hydrophobic in nature, however, the physicochemical properties fluorocarbon is distinctly different. Hence, it is plausible that fluorine affects the surrounding (solute or solvents) differently from the hydrocarbon. However, not much information is available on the role of fluorocarbon on the effect of surroundings such as modification of the hydrogen bond network, photophysical properties and solvation time scale of the fluorinated molecules which can lead them to show the unusual but important physicochemical properties. The change in the hydrogen bond network [82–84], photophysical properties and solvation time is directly correlated with the physicochemical properties of the fluorinated molecules [85,86]. In this review, we have discussed the role of CF group of fluorinated molecules in the modification of the hydrogen bond network, photophysical properties and solvation time scale of fluorine containing molecules."
1,Methods,"Alcoholic solvents namely, ethanol (ETH), 2-fluoroethanol (monofluoroethanol, MFE), 2,2-difluoroethanol (DFE) and 2,2,2,-trifluoroethanol (TFE) were procured from spectrochem. The probe molecules, coumarin 6H (C6H), coumarin 480 (C480) and coumarin 153 (C153) were purchased form Sigma Aldrich. Milli-Q water (H2O, Millipore, 18.3 MΩ cm resistivity) was used for the preparation of the aqueous mixture of alcohols. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Evolution 201) UV-Vis spectrometer was used for the absorption measurements, whereas, steady state emission measurements were performed with Fluoromax 4 (HORIBA Scientific). The infrared spectra were measured using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher) operating in the attenuated total reflection mode (ATR). The resolution of the IR measurement was 2 cm-1. The fluorescence intensity decays were measured with time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) setup of the IBH. In order to measure the solvation time, the femtosecond optical gating upconversion technique was used. The sample was excited at a particular wavelength using the second harmonic of a mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) which was pumped by a 5 W Millennia (Spectra Physics) laser. The fluorescence signal from the sample was upconverted in a nonlinear crystal using the fundamental beam as a gate pulse which was dispersed and detected using photon counting detector. In order to construct the time resolved emission spectra (TRES), the best fit parameters of the femtosecond fluorescence decays and steady state emission intensities was used as proposed by Maroncelli and Fleming [87–91]. The solvent correlation time [C(t)] was calculated using the following relation. C t = ν t - ν ∞ ν 0 - ν ∞ where ν(0), ν(t) and ν(∞) are emission peak frequencies at 0, t and ∞ time respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for all the systems was performed using the GROMACS [92] package. The all atom optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field [93,94] of the alcohols and dye molecules were used for the simulation. Transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points (TIP3P) water model has been used for the description of water. The parameters for both C153 and C6H have been generated using automated topology builder software (ATB). ∼5000 solvent molecules have been considered for the simulation of the pure solvent molecules and its mixtures. For the solvation of probe molecules, all the simulations began with the structure optimization of C153 or C6H using ATB followed by the solvation of dye molecule with ∼2000 alcohol molecules. Initially, each trajectory was equilibrated in a canonical (NVT) ensemble at 800 K for 500 ps to remove the biased dependencies on the initial configuration followed by an equilibration in isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at 300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure for 1 ns. Further, the production run of equilibrated configuration was performed for another 5 ns for the hydrogen bond network of the solvent whereas 50 ns of the simulation was used for the photophysical and solvation time scale calculation of the dye molecules in different solvents. The final production run was performed in NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar pressure. The temperature and pressure were kept constant using Berendsen thermostat [95] with a time constant (τ) of 0.1 ps and Parrinello-Rahman barostat [96] with a τ of 1.0 ps, respectively. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [97] was used for the incorporation of the electrostatic interactions. A 2 fs time step with the periodic boundary condition was used for each MD run. Non-bonded force calculation with a grid and updated after 5 steps was used for the neighbour list generation. The neighbour list generation and van der Waals interaction was calculated with a cut-off radius of 1.2 nm. In order to get the vibrational feature of the alcohol molecules, different sizes of clusters were optimized using B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) method. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) [98] was used to incorporate the effect of solvents. Frequency calculations were performed to ensure the nature of the optimized structure. All the calculations were performed using the G09 suites [99] of the program. The atom in molecule (AIM) calculation was performed to characterize the different types of interactions between different groups [100]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Role of fluorocarbon group in the hydrogen bond network of the bulk fluorinated alcohols,"3.1 Role of fluorocarbon group in the hydrogen bond network of the bulk fluorinated alcohols The IR spectrum of ETH shows a single peak feature centered at ∼3300 cm-1 (Fig. 1 a) which become broader and blue shifted on the fluorination as evident from the IR peak of MFE and TFE (Fig. 1 b and c). Interestingly, MFE shows an additional feature at 3580 cm-1, whereas, it appears for TFE at 3620 cm-1. The appearance of broad feature and blue shift in the central peak position of the IR spectra of fluorinated alcohols suggest that the presence of inhomogeneous hydrogen-bond network weakened the average hydrogen bond strength of fluorinated alcohols Indeed, appearance of new IR peak at the high frequency region ∼3600 cm-1 in the case of fluorinated alcohols depicts the presence of weak hydrogen bonded species in fluorinated alcohols. The change in the IR spectra of the bulk fluorinated alcohol and its comparison with ETH clearly suggests that the substitution of fluorine significantly perturbs the hydrogen bond network of alcohol molecules. The radial distribution function [g(r)] between the different interacting groups of the fluorinated alcohols was calculated using the MD simulation analysis to decipher the role of fluorocarbon group in the hydrogen bond network of fluorinated alcohols. The peak position of the g(r) for the OH⋯O interaction of alcohols clearly depict the presence of OH⋯O hydrogen bond for all the system (Fig. 1b). The g(r) between the OH and fluorine of fluorinated alcohols (Fig. 1c) shows a peak feature within 3.5 Å confirming the presence of OH⋯F interaction in the fluorinated alcohols. It is noticeable that the peak feature of the g(r) for the OH⋯F interaction is slightly at less distance and amplitude is also less for MFE than TFE depicting that OH⋯F interaction in MFE is more populated and its strength is comparatively higher than TFE. The snapshot of the MD simulation clearly shows that apart from the OH⋯O hydrogen bond, significant amount of OH⋯F hydrogen bond contributes in the hydrogen bond network of the fluorinated alcohols. To understand the nature of different interactions responsible for the IR feature of alcohols, different sizes of the clusters of ETH, MFE and TFE were optimized using the PCM model as shown in Fig. 2 [83,100–103]. It can be clearly seen that OH⋯O hydrogen bond was found for the different clusters of ETH in its bulk medium. In contrast, MFE and TFE clusters depict the presence of intermolecular OH⋯O and OH⋯F interactions. Finally, the weighted average IR spectrum of the different size of the clusters of ETH, MFE and TFE were calculated in order to ensure the assignments of the IR feature of the alcohols (Fig. 3 ). The weighted average IR spectrum of the monomer of ETH shows a peak at 3630 cm-1. However, the experimental IR spectrum of the OH stretch of ETH does not show any feature in that region suggesting that ETH does not exist in the monomer form in their bulk media. It is noticeable that the monomers of MFE and TFE depict the OH vibrational feature around 3620 and 3640 cm-1, respectively, which is close to their observed experimental feature at the high stretching frequency ∼3600 cm-1. However, the band shape of the experimental IR feature around 3600 cm-1 is comparatively broader than the IR feature of an isolated monomer as observed in the gas phase experiments [1,83,104]. Moreover, isolated monomers of MFE and TFE could not be found in our MD simulations. Hence, the peak observed around 3600 cm-1 in the MFE and TFE cannot be assigned to their isolated monomer. The weighted average IR spectra of dimer and trimer of MFE and TFE show a vibrational feature at high frequency of OH stretching region around ˜ 3580 and 3620 cm-1 which is originating from the OH⋯F interaction. The calculated vibrational features of dimer and trimer of MFE and TFE are close to the observed experimental features at 3580 and 3632 cm-1, respectively. Indeed, earlier study on the dimer and trimer of the TFE in the supersonic jet condition also shows a peak ∼3630 cm-1 which has been assigned to the OH⋯F interaction between TFE clusters [105]. Hence, the weak feature appearing in the 3600 cm-1 region for fluorinated alcohols has been assigned to the weak intermolecular OH⋯F hydrogen bond mainly arising from the dimer and trimer of fluorinated-ETHs, whereas, the intense broad band appearing below 3600 cm-1 has been assigned to the OH⋯O hydrogen bonded clusters of alcohols in their bulk media. The IR data, MD simulation along with quantum chemical calculation data clearly depict that in contrast to ETH, significant amount of weak intermolecular OH⋯F hydrogen bond forms at the cost of strong intermolecular OH⋯O hydrogen bond in fluorinated–ETHs which decreases the average hydrogen bond strength of fluorinated–ETHs. This study distinctly describes the hydrogen bond network reorganization capability of organic fluorine by the virtue of its potential as hydrogen bond acceptor in its bulk medium."
4,Role of fluorocarbon group in the hydrogen bond network of the aqueous mixture of bulk fluorinated alcohols,"Fig. 4 shows the IR spectra of different mole fraction of the aqueous mixture of ETH and MFE in their OH stretching region. The spectral feature of the aqueous mixture of alcohols have been divided in three different regions (1) water rich (0.97 ≥ χw ≥ 0.83) (2) intermediate (0.70 ≥ χw ≥ 0.25) (3) alcohol rich (χw ≤ 0.25). The IR spectrum of water is broad with double peak feature in the OH stretching region covering the range of 3000−3800 cm-1. The IR feature of water were deconvoluted into five different regions centered 3080, 3200, 3400, 3500 and 3600 cm-1 which have been assigned to the Fermi resonance, symmetrical tetrahedral environment, and asymmetric tetrahedral hydrogen bonded network and weakly hydrogen bonded species, respectively [106–114]. In the water rich region of the aqueous mixture of ETH, the intensity ratio of the peaks at 3200 and 3370 cm-1 is higher than in bulk water. The IR band shape in the OH stretching region is controlled by the population of water-water, alcohol-water and alcohol-alcohol hydrogen bonded species. In the water rich region, water-alcohol and water-water hydrogen bonded species contributed significantly as the probability of the aggregation of alcohol is less. The IR feature for the hydrogen bonded species of ETH-water appears at ∼3400 cm-1. Hence, the increased intensity of the IR feature at 3200 cm-1 in water rich region of the aqueous mixture of ETH is prominently due to increased aggregation of the OHw⋯Ow hydrogen bonded species of water molecules. In the intermediate region of the aqueous mixture of ETH, the intensity of the peak at 3350 cm-1 is higher as compared to 3200 cm-1 which suggests that the population of ETH-water hydrogen bonded species takes over at water-water hydrogen bonded species. In the alcohol rich region, the IR spectral feature of mixture is very similar to pure ETH depicting the single peak maxima around ∼3330 cm-1. In contrast to the aqueous mixture of ETH, the intensity of the IR peak at 3370 cm-1 is higher as compared to 3200 cm-1 in the water rich region of the aqueous mixture of MFE. The higher intensity of the peak at 3370 cm-1 suggests that the population of MFE-water hydrogen bonded species dominates over the clustering of water molecules in the water rich region. In the intermediate region, the intensity of the peak at 3370 cm-1 is significantly high which suggests further strengthening of the hydrogen bonding between MFE and water molecules. Importantly, a high frequency IR band at ∼3640 cm-1 appears in the water rich region simultaneously with the spectral feature at 3200 and 3370 cm-1. The peak at ∼3640 cm-1 becomes more prominent in the intermediate region. The high frequency peak at 3640 cm-1 shows the presence of weak OH(w)⋯F(MFE) hydrogen bonded complexes between MFE and water molecules. The trend of the change of the IR data in the water and intermediate region suggests that water interacts with MFE via OH(w)⋯O(MFE) and OH(w)⋯F(MFE) hydrogen bond at the cost of its self aggregation via OHw⋯Ow hydrogen bond. In the alcohol rich region, the spectral feature of the aqueous mixture of MFE is very similar to pure MFE depicting the dominance of the aggregation of MFE via OH(MFE)⋯O(MFE) and OH(MFE)⋯F(MFE) hydrogen bonds resulting in the IR features centered at 3340 and 3580 cm-1, respectively. The IR band shape analysis clearly depicts that the fluorocarbon group causes the reorganization of hydrogen bonds in the aqueous mixture of MFE. In order to unravel the role of fluorocarbon group in the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network of the aqueous mixture of MFE, MD simulation of water mixtures with MFE and ETH was performed. The g(r) for the self-aggregation of ETH and water in its aqueous mixture shows that the aggregation of ETH (OHETH⋯OETH) decreases with the increase of water content, whereas, the aggregation of water (OHw⋯Ow) increases with the increase of ETH. In MFE-water mixture, g(r) for the aggregation of MFE decreases with the increase of water content. However, the extent of decrease of g(r) in MFE is higher than in ETH suggesting that the aggregation of MFE via OHMFE⋯OMFE is less as compared to that in ETH in its aqueous mixture. Interestingly, unlike ETH-water mixture, the g(r) for the aggregation of water does not show monotonic change as it increases up to χw = 0.7 and beyond that it decreases with the increase in the amount of water in its aqueous mixture. To probe the nonmonotonicity of the aggregation of water, the hydrogen bonding of water with MFE was investigated by the calculation of the g(r) between the hydrogen of water and fluorine of MFE (Fig. 5 e). The g(r) between the hydrogen of water and fluorine of MFE increases with the increase of MFE, however, it is significant for χw ≤ 0.7 which suggests that OHw⋯FMFE interaction between water and MFE is prominent for χw ≤ 0.7. The g(r) of the different binding sites of MFE indicates that the decrease of the association of water after certain composition is due to the significant increase of the hydrogen bonding of water with MFE via OHw⋯FMFE interaction. The simulation study reveals that the substitution of fluorine reorganized the hydrogen bond network by compelling water to behave as more hydrogen bond donor towards the OHw⋯FMFE interaction. Further, the intermolecular hydrogen bond network of water and alcohol was investigated by the calculation of g(r) between the OH of alcohol and oxygen of water and vice versa (Fig. 6 ). The g(r) plot for ETH-water mixture shows that ETH is mainly a donor molecule as the population of OHETH⋯Ow hydrogen bonded species is more compared to OHw⋯OETH. The trend of g(r) between the OH of MFE and oxygen of water is similar to ETH-water mixture. However, for the aqueous mixture of MFE, the g(r) between the hydrogen of OH of alcohol and oxygen of water is ∼2 times higher and concurrently, the g(r) between the hydrogen of OH of water and oxygen of alcohol is ∼1.5 times less than the aqueous mixture of ETH which indicates that the OH of MFE is strong hydrogen bond donor to water than ETH in their aqueous mixture. Water forms hydrogen bond with fluorine terminal of MFE via OHw⋯FMFE interaction which makes them less available for the hydrogen bond network of the oxygen terminal of MFE resulting decrease in the intensity of the g(r) between the hydrogen of OH of water and oxygen of MFE. Moreover, the O-Hw⋯FMFE interaction makes the oxygen of water more accessible for the OHMFE⋯Ow hydrogen bond via the cyclic structure resulting in the increased intensity of the g(r) between the hydrogen of OH of MFE with the oxygen of water molecules. From the MD simulation and IR study, it is apparent that the aggregation of water increases in the aqueous mixture of ETH than the bulk water. In MFE-water mixture, water interacts with MFE via OHw⋯FMFE which originates the peak feature around ∼3600 cm-1. The OHw⋯FMFE interaction between water and MFE causes reduction of water clustering by changing its orientation and simultaneous increase in the OHMFE⋯Ow hydrogen bonds resulting in the increased intensity of the IR feature at 3370 cm-1. TFE-water mixture has also been studied by our group using IR, MD simulation, quantum chemical calculations and found that fluorocarbon group of TFE reorganizes the hydrogen bond network similar to the case of MFE-water mixture [84,110]. Indeed, very recently our [115] as well as Ben Amotz [116] groups have clearly shown that the OH⋯F hydrogen bond plays an important role in the hydration shell of the fluoro alcohols."
5,Role of fluorous interaction in the photophysical and solvation properties of fluorinated molecules,"In the above sections, the role of the fluorocarbon group in the reorganization of the hydrogen bond network of solvents (fluorinated alcohols) and its aqueous mixtures was discussed. The role of fluorocarbon group in the photophysical and solvation properties of probe molecules is equally important as it facilitates them unique properties. To understand the role of fluorocarbon group in the photophysical properties of fluoro group containing molecules, three prototypical coumarin dye molecules C6H, C480 and C153 (structures are shown in Fig. 7 ) were investigated in ETH and its fluorinated analogs, MFE, DFE and TFE. The steady state UV-Vis and emission spectra of all the probe molecules are red shifted in fluorinated-ETHs than in ETH. However, in contrast to C480 and C6H, the emission spectrum of C153 in TFE is blue shifted than MFE and DFE which suggests the different local environment of C153 in TFE than C480 and C6H (Fig. 7a-c). The value of life time (τ) of C6H and C480 increases with the increase of fluorine on ETH which is in line with the polarity of the solvent as the solvent polarity (ET30) increases with the increment of fluorine on ETH (Fig. 7d-f) [82,85,86]. However, in contrast to C6H and C480, the τ value of C153 is not monotonic in these solvents. The τ value of C153 in TFE is higher as compared to MFE and DFE. The nonmonotonic trend of the τ value of C153 in alcoholic solvents depict that the environment of different solvents near to C153 are more important rather than the polarity of solvents. Interestingly, the skeleton of all three coumarin dyes is same except the presence of –CF3 group in C153. The different trend of τ values of C153 in fluoro-ETHs suggests that the solvent’s organization near to –CF3 group of C153 is different. Further, the MD simulation was performed to understand the solvent organization around the probe molecules (Fig. 8 ). The g(r) near to the hydrogen bonding group N and O of C153 and C6H was found to be same in ETH and TFE which indicates that the substitution of –CF3 on the probe molecule does not affect the interaction with solvent molecules (Figures S1 and S2). The g(r) of fluorine terminal of –CF3 of C153 with C and O end of alcohols depicts that the C terminal of alcohols prefer to go near the CF3 group of C153 (Fig. 8a). The pictorial representation of the solvents near the C153 shows that the −CH3 group of ETH, CH2F group of MFE and CF3 group of TFE comes closer to the –CF3 terminal of C153 (Fig. 8). To understand the specific interaction between the –CF3 terminal of C153 with C terminal of solvents, atom present within 3.5 Å of–CF3 of C153 was calculated. More number of hydrogen (˜8) atoms rather than fluorine attached with C terminal of MFE prefers to approach near the –CF3 terminal of C153 which could be due to acidic nature of the CH group of MFE. Indeed, the g(r) between the hydrogen of the CH2F group of MFE with fluorine of –CF3 appears at less distance than the g(r) of fluorine of the CH2F group with fluorine of –CF3 of C153 (Fig. 8f). In Contrast to MFE, fluorine of TFE prefers to be closer to fluorine of C153 resulting in the fluorous interaction. The simulations were also performed with the excited state charge density of the probe molecules which does not show any appreciable change except the decrease in the intermolecular distance of the interacting species. The electrostatic interaction between the CH group of MFE and DFE with –CF3 group of C153 increases the rate of non-radiative decay which decreases the τ values of C153 in MFE and DFE, whereas, the fluorous interaction takes place between –CF3 groups of C153 and TFE due to which rate of non-radiative process decreases as compared to MFE and DFE. This study depicts that the fluorous interaction between fluorine of probe and solvent molecules modulates the photophysical properties differently."
6,Role of fluorous interaction in the solvation properties of fluorinated molecules,"In order to realize the role of fluorocarbon group in the solvation properties, the solvent correlation time C (t) of C6H and C153 was measured in ETH, MFE and TFE solvents. The C (t) of both the dyes in all solvents shows three components (as shown in Table 1 ) of which first two fast components originate due to the inertial nature of solvent (liberation and hindered motion), whereas, the slow component arises due to the diffusive motion (viscosity of the solvent and solute–solvent interaction) [117–119]. The average C (t) of C6H in ETH, MFE and TFE is almost same, however, the C (t) of C153 in TFE is higher as compared to MFE and TFE [85]. Indeed, the first two fast components of both the probe molecules are same in all the solvents, however, the last component of C153 in TFE (93.6 ps) is three times higher than in ETH (34.1 ps) and MFE (24.8 ps). Since, solvents are same for both probes, hence, the different C (t) of C153 in TFE suggests the presence of specific interaction between probe and solvent molecules (Fig. 9 ). The equilibrium solvation time scale Cs (t) of C6H and C153 in ETH, MFE and TFE was calculated using MD simulation (Table 1). The Cs (t) of C6H in ETH, MFE and TFE are approximately the same, whereas, the Cs (t) of C153 in TFE (77 ps) is slow as compared to ETH (35 ps) and MFE (29 ps). The structural motif of C153 and C6H is same, except for the presence of CF3 group in C153. Hence, the Cs (t) of C153 was calculated considering only the explicit energy of –CF3 group. The slow component of the Cs (t) of C153 on assuming only the explicit energy of –CF3 was found to be 68 ps which is close to Cs(t) value (77 ps) obtained by considering the energy of whole system. The calculated Cs(t) shows that the –CF3 group of C153 has prominent role in the slow component of Cs(t) in TFE. Further, the contribution of Cs(t) was decomposed in to the electrostatic and dispersion components and the results are shown in Table1. The decay profiles of the decomposed parts of Cs(t) of C153 in TFE shows that the slow component for Lennard-Jones part (dispersive interaction) is ∼63 ps, whereas, its value for the Coulombic part is ∼40 ps. The decomposed value of the slow component of Lennard-Jones (63 ps) is close to the experimental value (93 ps) which depicts that the dispersive interaction is the main contributor of the slow component of C153 in TFE. This study clearly demonstrates that the fluorous interaction between the probe and solvent molecules slow down the solvation process."
7,Conclusion,"The presence of OH⋯F hydrogen bond in fluorinated alcohols decreases the average hydrogen bond strength than nonfluorinated alcohol, hence, the IR spectra of the bulk alcohol gets blue shifted with the substitution of fluorine. The experimental and simulation studies reveal that the substitution of a single fluorine on the alcohol decreases the clustering of water molecules via OHMFE⋯Ow in their aqueous mixture by moving some of water molecules from the hydrophilic OH site to the hydrophobic fluorine terminal. It has also been discussed that fluorine of the fluorinated molecules prefers to have the dispersive fluorous interaction with the solvents containing fluorine molecules. The dispersive fluorous interaction causes to decrease the nonradiative rate which increases the stability of the molecules in the excited state. Interestingly, the fluorous interaction also affects to the solvation by making it slow. These studies clearly suggest that the presence of fluorine affects the hydrogen bond network, photophysical properties and solvation process distinctly or in different fashion as compared to the nonfluorinated analogues."
