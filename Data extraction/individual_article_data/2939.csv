0,Introduction,"Today, mankind is facing a serious challenge of a continuous increase in energy demand, together with a reduction of fossil fuel reserves, an increase in GHG emissions, and climate change. An IEA Outlook – in the best case – predicts growth of around 20% in energy demand in relation to current levels [1,2]. Renewable sources are seen as an alternative for mitigating such problems, especially biomasses, which are quite versatile, ensuring several ways to use them efficiently in biorefineries, which are installations capable of converting biomass into electricity and biofuels, chemical inputs, food, giving also a real possibility of creation of new added value- chains for biomass [3,4]. IEA defines biorefineries as a facility characterized by the sustainable conversion of biomass into value-added products, not in a single process [3]. Developed countries have made great investments in research, development, and innovation related to biorefineries, which are multi-product industrial plants, where an efficient and sustainable use of biomass energy for the production of chemical products, biofuels, electricity generation and food is done in the same installation, showing a correct economic and political strategy [3,5,6]. In this context, Brazil was taken as a case study because has a potential to reach outstanding positions in the use of biomass, since sugarcane sector produces huge volumes of bagasse and straw that can be used in biorefineries, contributing to the positive evolution of sugar and alcohol sector. In this way, Brazil could remain at world forefront of clean energy production significantly assisting in mitigating climate change. Knowledge of results of this study can be applied in any kind of biorefinery that use biomass as a raw material. This evolution can also be seen as a sustainable solution for the reduction of the energy dependence of fossil sources [7,8], as well as contributing to making sugar and alcohol industry less vulnerable to variations in market performance [3,9]. Other information about processes, products, the raw material that can be used in biorefineries, and several concepts can be found in Kamm and Kamm [10], NREL [11], Maity [12], Maity [13]. Most widespread biomass conversion routes are biochemical and thermochemical, which convert raw material into liquid products (ethanol, ammonia, biodiesel, furfural, butanol, acetone, etc.) or gas (methane, biogas, ethylene, etc.). These routes require that before the conversion of biomass it must go through to a pretreatment process, which confers necessary characteristics for processing to raw materials [14,15]. Knowledge of inherent characteristics required by conversion processes allows optimization of available resources and obtaining more sustainable products from them, in comparison with those manufactured from conventional raw materials. Significantly several efforts had been done in developing biorefineries to find routes that provide greater economic and energy gains with less environmental and social impacts, that is, determining most sustainable route [16]. Görgens et al. [17], presents a comparison between six alternatives for sugarcane biomass conversion, using biochemical and thermochemical routes. The author uses Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and economic analysis, to gives an approach of the impacts of diversification in sugarcane industry, through development of lignocellulosic biorefineries. The main results shows how these facilities can contribute to improve the biomass sustainability in many countries. Other works have used optimization techniques to identify parameters that determine maximum technical, economic and environmental performance of raw materials conversion. Andiappan et al [18] did a multi-objective optimization study for a palm oil biorefinery with 31 conversion alternatives. Gebreslassie et al. [19] propose a multi-objective non-linear programming model (MINLP) for a seaweed-based biorefinery with CO2 sequestration from diesel combustion, which simultaneously minimizes GWP (Global Warming Potential) and maximizes NPV, constructing a Pareto curve. Gebreslassie et al. [20] apply an aforementioned methodology for optimization of bio-hydrocarbon from biorefinery life cycle, through rapid pyrolysis, hydrotreatment, the author determines a Pareto curve that identifies the viability region between NPV and avoided GWP gas emissions. Ng et al. [21] present a fuzzy optimization approach to a sustainably integrated biorefinery based in Palm oil for Malaysia conditions. This technique was, in a novel way, adapted to solve four conflicting parameters: economic performance, environmental impact, safety impact on workers and impacts on enterprise employee’s health. Maronese et al. [22], developed a superstructure of different process alternatives for biorefineries based on wood and using biochemical and thermochemical routes. For a first time different paths were systematically compared with each other and classified according to Integer-Cut Constraint (ICC), to identify the most promising technologies and optimal configuration and sizing of process units. Celebi et al. [23], presents a study of a biorefinery optimization using thermo-economical-environmental methodology, which adopting Lua-OSMOSE structure, which allows optimizing thermal integration, and Mixed Integer Linear Programming Structure. This technique aims system optimization through an objective function, based on technical, economic or even environmental criteria, taking into account series of constraints interconnecting variables of a model. Murillo-Alvarado et al. [24], goes through an analysis of possibilities of chain optimization in tequila industry in Mexico, which considers all activities involved, together with such conflicting objectives of its daily operation, which represents a scientific challenge. The publication presents a multi-objective optimization approach to design this supply chain explaining simultaneous maximization of NPV and network environmental performance. Results presented through Pareto curves, make possible to identify several solutions attractive to decision makers. Ng et al. [25], develops an integrated structure for dimensioning supply chains (SC) of biofuels, considering availability of raw material, and aspects related to its transportation. A preprocessing algorithms was develop that allow to size SC network reduction and a MILP model to determine ideal facilities number, capacity and location, as well as production, inventory and distribution profiles of all SC nodes. Ng and Maravelias [26], developed a model based on Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), to size a supply chain of biofuels so transport costs, showing how different supply chain configurations influence performance and energy efficiency of biofuel production. Use of this optimization technique allows to show that biomass should be sent directly to biorefineries when distance is small, while deposits are preferred at greater distances. A study developed by Santibañez-Aguilar et al. [27] presents an approach to optimal planning under uncertainty, for a biorefinery system, considering economic and environmental aspects. Due to uncertainty about raw material price, a stochastic generation of scenarios was done, using Latin Hypercube method, and implementing Monte-Carlo method to determine optimal structure for each sample. Ghaderi et al. [28] presents a review of other works on biomass supply chain network design models (BSCND) to determine research opportunities and future directions gaps. Ghaderi et al. [29] develops and proposes a robust and multiobjective feasible programming model for designing a switchgrass based bioethanol supply chain, considering conflicting economic, environmental and social objectives. This technique presents itself as an alternative to work with uncertain parameters in an effective way, and was developed through a new and robust multi-purpose/multi-objective programming approach, maximizing average value of supply chain performance, controlling optimality, as well as, robustness of viability. Bairamzadeh et al. [30] develops a Mixed Integer Programming (MILP) model to guide decision making in aspects of a lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain, which is subject to different alternative of uncertainty. To deal with different types of uncertainty, including randomness, a robust optimization hybrid model is proposed, uncertainty in technology is handle through probabilistic scenarios, while demand is assumed as a variable in a known range. In addition, fixed costs are given by linear functions, limited at intervals relative to their capacity. Proposed robust model is shown through computational results, surpassing deterministic model in terms of performance measures. This paper offers a new perspective by analyzing biomass allocation problem through designed computer experiments approach. Designed experiments refers to a collection of statistical techniques capable of generating and analyzing experimental tests in which several factors are varied simultaneously in a true new way. Such technique is widely used in production and operations management, as well as in manufacturing and quality control for process planning and optimization [31–33]. Since the Sacks et al. [34], computer experiments emerged as a popular alternative for real system modeling, analysis, and optimization [35–37]. The aim of the design of experiment (DOE) is to plan an experimental design so that appropriate data can be obtained, with a reduced number of experiments, to facilitate good conclusions. The advantage of using it is to avoid either physical (real) experimentation or Monte Carlo Simulation for system analysis, enabling one to draw sensitivity and optimization conclusions on process planning and operation. In general, computer experiments are analyzed using Kriging method, a spatial regression approach interpolating data. Studies about problems of allocation of biomass using computational experiments based on Kriging method were not found in any previous research work. Modeling computer experiments using Kriging regression is a method that allows complex system simulation and optimization with a simple model without the use of robust computational resources [35]. One contribution of this work is to define, by using designed computer experiments analysis, a group of products most suitable to be obtained through sugar and alcohol sector biomass transformation and to find out how residual biomass should be shared among different conversion processes, to obtain the best energy production, with an effective economic and environmental performance. For such purpose a sugar and alcohol installation will be taken as a base and annexed biorefinery facilities, to obtain different products. A mathematical model was arranged using computational experiments based on Kriging regression approach, which relates biomass distribution with performance indicators (efficiency, NPV, CO2eq avoided emissions). Significant contributions of this work are the integrated analysis of different biorefinerýs configurations, by applying Kriging method for analysis and optimization and definition of best products alternatives to biomass conversion. Agro-biomass or Biomass from agriculture, no matter from which crop, rice, corn, sugarcane, wheat, grass, rye, are synthesized by the same marvelous mechanism: – Photosynthesis, integrating Light + CO2 and rendering a product combining the same three elements: Cellulose, Hemicelluloses and Lignin. In such a way it́s possible to appreciate the results obtained from any biomass, could be extended to all biomasses, making the corresponding adjustment due to the specific profile of the socio-economic environment. This gives the knowledge contained in this paper an unlimited value of application, in any agro-environment, anywhere."
1,Biorefineries,"1.1 Biorefineries In this doing it is important, to evaluate the current stage of development of biorefineries. Some conversion technologies are consolidated at a commercial scale, but others are still under development or study. Many promising routes are still at a research stage, and the main process of biomass conversion into products with aggregated value, are in the stage of technological development. Although biorefineries represent an alternative with a potential to increase the efficiency of energy and economic utilization of sugarcane biomass, to consolidate it on a commercial scale, represent challenges to overcome. Which can be classified as: (a) technical, those related to pre-treatment, catalysis (heterogeneous, and enzymatic), separation, process kinetics, and process integration of existing installations; (b) economical, those related to raw material logistics, process integration into existing infrastructure, and reduction of production costs. A lack of incentive policies can be cited as a political challenge [9]. Jong and Jungmeier [38] discuss several favorable points and opportunities for biorefineries as well as some drawbacks and threats to their implementation, in addition to supply a parallel with petrochemical refineries. Even with existing implementation challenges, sugarcane biomass could be used to build a renewable chemical industry, constituting viable strategy able to reduce the use of fossil resources at short and medium term. Large amounts of biomass are available in Brazilian sugarcane sector, with around 184 million tons bagasse produced in the 2016/2017 crop [39], so it use could contribute to add value to new sugarcane production chains, strengthening possible creation of a chemical industry based on a green economy [3,5,12,13]. In a biorefinery, it is necessary to evaluate which products can bring more energetic, economic and environmental benefits, defining an appealing product basket. Also, biorefineries have potential to produce several products with aggregated value through take advantage of waste with low cost. In sugar-alcohol industries, bagasse and straw are abundant, and they use can contribute to improve use of sugar cane, and evolution of sugar and alcohol sectors [40]."
2,Products basket,"1.2 Products basket There are several possible products and conversion processes to be considered in a sugar-alcohol biorefinery. More information about potential products produced from sugarcane biomass can be found in Mandegari, [41]; Santos [42]; CGEE, [15]; Werpy and Petersen [22]. Unlike technology for sugarcane juice processing, processes for bagasse and straw utilization are not fully consolidated at a commercial scale. Products such as ethanol, butanol and aviation fuels can be produced through both, sugarcane juice and bagasse, through biochemical processes. Thermochemical processes can be used for the production of fuels that are conventionally manufactured through fossil resources such as diesel and gasoline. These products can be obtained integrated to existing infrastructures. In this work it was considered biochemical route for biobutanol and bioethanol production, and thermochemical route for Diesel and gasoline as well as electricity production, since such products have importance in Brazilian and any other biomass producing country market, adding value to it. • Lignocellulosic Ethanol: Can be seen as an alternative that allows an increase in plant productivity of ethanol production, without a need to increase planted area. Considering that for each ton of bagasse employed in this process, productivity per area increases in about 2.2%, without any additional cane area [14,44]. • Biobutanol: This product has received attention from academic field, due to its possibilities as fuel and industrial feedstock for chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries; rising the potential to become a renewable chemical commodity [45–47]. • Syngas: In theory, biomass can replace most products derived from the petrochemical chain. Syngas can be used for the manufacture of so-called building blocks, which in turn can be used as a base for products with great importance in transport, textile, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries [43,48]. • Fischer-Tropsch products: This process can be used to substitute the use of fossil fuel such as Diesel and gasoline in specific manufacturing [49,50]. • BIG-GTCC: Allows increase surplus electricity generation and revenues, representing also a source of electricity with neutral emissions and renewable origin [42]. It was assumed in this work that available biomass will be used for the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, biobutanol through ABE fermentation, and syngas, which will be used for diesel production through the Fischer-Tropsch process, as well as for electricity production in a BIG-GTCC. Fig. 1 shows a proposed biorefinery scheme. Taking into account products that allow to obtain a higher added value sugarcane biomass and its residues, biorefinery scheme presented in Fig. 1 considers currently available and in development technologies, both for power and heat generation in cogeneration system and for biofuels and chemicals production through biochemical and thermochemical routes. Thus, for cogeneration system, there is Conventional Rankine Cycle and Integrated Biomass Gasification Cycle-BIG-GTCC, while for biofuels production second generation technologies are available (lignocellulosic ethanol, biobutanol and FT). Important to mention thermal and electrical demands of all processes are met through steam and electricity production in conventional steam cycle and BIG-GTCC cycle contributes to increase electricity surplus produced by the plant. In Methodology item numbers of this plant will be presented. A choice of the products to be manufactured as well as production processes to be employed should cover issues of optimization of production processes."
3,Computational experiment,"An experiment is defined as a test or a series of tests, proposing changes in systeḿs input variables, to identify the changes that occur in the output variable. If an experiment with several numbers of factors is to be performed, one may apply a scientific methodology of DOE, referring to planning experiments process, so that process yields an appropriate data collection for application of statistical techniques, which result in valid and objective findings [31,32]. Initially, experiments designs was used to test system parameters of physical experiments [31,33]. A first experimental designs used in the statistical analysis were based on corner of Latin Square, and are referred to as factorial designs. A full factorial design of n variables, each with l levels, presents tn combinations of all levels. Extensive use of factorial designs culminated in development of response surface methodology by Box and Wilson [33]. Such approach pursues modeling of higher order process models under analysis, seeking to optimize operation system. In general, in determining experimental designs for physical experiments, minimize model variance is wanted to be fitted by performing as few experiments as possible."
4,Design of computer experiments,"2.1 Design of computer experiments While physical experiments present random factors, computational experiments are deterministic. Such feature, turns issues associated with selection of appropriate experimental designs into something different from physical experiments. For instance, one may not be worried about reducing variance; also, in computer experiments, concepts of blocking and randomization make no sense; also in modeling computer experiments, one is usually interested in capturing and forecasting complex behavior of responses under analysis, as well as in avoiding lower dimension projection problems. These issues induce many alternatives DCOE, such as space-filling designs. In this approach, one spans experimental points over a design region, enables to capture complex response behavior and/or mimicking statistical properties of any system under analysis. Simplest space-filling design refers to a simple random sample over a Latin-hypercube with s dimensions (s-dimensional) × ∈ Cs − [0, 1]s. Simply random sampling over cube results in a variance that follows central limit theory. That is, if y = f(x) is the system model under analysis, a sample of size n experiments has unbiased means with variance Var(f(x))/n). To reduce such variance, Latin-hypercube sampling (LHS) has been proposed [51], so that chosen experimental points will dependent on and have a same marginal distribution. Following LHS, researchers have proposed other Latin-hypercube designs (LHD), seeking to minimize variance of sample means and fulfill experimental space. For instance, when randomized orthogonal arrays [52,53], symmetric LHD [54,55], and optimal designs, where the experimental runs are designed to optimize some objective function [56–58]. In optimal designs, [40] proposed maxmin distance, where maximum distance between any point in experimental space and experimental runs are minimized. Such criteria guarantee some uniformity in experimental design so t it ensures no point in experimental space is too far from an experimental run. This feature allows good projection properties, so max min criterion is used to design computer experiments conducted in this paper, giving it an up to date experimental approach."
5,Modeling computer experiments,"2.2 Modeling computer experiments Once the experimental design is constructed and experimental runs are simulated, wishes to find a surrogate model y ^ = g x , so one can predict the true model y = g x all over the experimental space. There exist numerous statistical techniques that may be applied to modeling computer experiments which determine a surrogate model capable of providing good forecasts of system responses, such as polynomial models, splines, Bayesian approach and neural networks, among others. Notwithstanding, as modeling through computational experiment is a regression problem based on experimental data without random errors, prediction error equals mean square error between surrogate and true model. Surrogate function relates input variables to responses, can be determined by mathematical techniques [58]. Proposed for modeling computer experiments by [34], ordinary Kriging regression is very popular to obtain a surrogate model. Such model is defined on Eq. (1): (1) y ^ = g ^ x = μ + z x where y ^ refers to the fitted observation, µ is an overall mean, x is the vector of process (decision) variables and z(x) is Gaussian process with zero mean, variance σ2 and correlation function r(θ, s, t) = corr(z(s), z(t)). Here r(θ, s, t) is a pre-specified positive definite bivariate function of z(s) and z(t). Eq. (1) referred to as to ordinary Kriging model. S e t are any vectors in the sample space [35]. Generally, the correlation function is given by Eq. (2): (2) r θ , s , t = e x p - ∑ k = 1 s θ k s k - t k q ; w i t h 0 < q ≤ 2 where q is the spatial correlation function parameter, and for q = 2 gives a process with infinitely differentiable paths, and is useful when the response is analytic [35]. Indeed, ordinary Kriging model is quite useful for solving nonlinear and multivariate modeling problems, which from input experimental data, provides correlated answers to each other. Ordinary Kriging forecasts responses which are a linear combination of experimental runs So, results obtained by selected experimental design are used to estimate this regression model, so points in an intermediate region among different points, are interpolated with the intention of approximation error to be as smallest as possible."
6,Methodology,"In this study, as case, it was considered a sugar mill with a processing capacity of 6 million tons of sugarcane per crop, or 1,200 t/h (tons of sugarcane per hour), and high steam parameters (100 bar and 520 °C) in its cogeneration plant. These values are similar to Santa Luzia, Santa Elisa, Vale do Rosário, Jataí I and Jataí II sugar mills [59–61], similar to any high efficient cane sugar mill. Plant considered in this study is energetically self-sufficient so that electricity produced feeds both mills (considered electrified mills) and process equipment such as pumps, agitators, conveyors, among others, also for lighting installations. Of all bagasse produced in juice extraction process, an amount – corresponding to 10% of the total – is stored, to be used at off-season. Another part of bagasse is used as fuel in steam boilers and was assumed this quantity is equal to the amount of straw collected in cane field; additional generated bagasse will be used as feedstock in processes of second generation ethanol, biobutanol, and gasification, and for biomass conversion processes of attached plants. Fig. 2 shows schematically bagasse distribution in considered biorefinery processes. Note from Fig. 2 that each process will receive a fraction of available bagasse, so lignocellulosic ethanol, biobutanol and gasification facilities will receive fractions of bagasse corresponding to x1, x2, and x3. Thus, one can define x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 (100%). In case of gasification, one can see from Fig. 2 that syngas produced is divided into a x4 fraction for hydrocarbons production through the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and a x5 fraction will be used as fuel in a BIG-GTCC installation for electricity and steam generation. Thus, similarly as before, x4 + x5 = 1 (100%). Considering a point called “Base Case (BSE)”, in which all available bagasse is divided equally between processes, each process will receive a total of 68.27 tons/h of total 204.8 tons of bagasse available. In case of syngas, in an analogous way, FT synthesis, and BIG-GTCC cycle will receive 50% of syngas produced. Indeed, x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5, are those which compose the process (decision) variable vector xT = [x1 x2 x3 x4 x5], described in the previous section. Notice that the process variable vector may be reduced to xT = [x1 x2 x4], since x3 = 1 − x1 − x2 and x4 = 1 − x5. In order to run computational experiments, an experimental design must be defined considering numerical values of x, as discussed in Section 2.1. Thus, an LHD with maxmin criteria over x1, x2, and x4 space may be obtained, where each point of experimental design corresponds to a biorefinery configuration to be simulated. To determine variables arrangement Matlab, is used, in which a LHS design command (X = lhsdesign (n, p)) was inserted, where n is number of lines referring to number of design points, and p represents number of variables. Definition of experimental arrangements consists of a first stage of computational experiment procedure performed in Matlab software to define different experimental arrangements. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of the procedure of computational experiment adopted. For each experimental run, amounts of bagasse destined to each plant process are x1, x2, x3, and x4, x5. From quantity of processed bagasse, thermal and electrical consumption, as well as, quantities of manufactured products, are calculated for each process. Based on energy demand of each configuration, and on amount of syngas sent for BIG-GTCC, thermal power system will be simulated in Gatecycle software for global mass and energy balance. Then all simulation results for x1, x2, x3, and x4, x5 sets are exported to an excel sheet where thermodynamic, economic and environmental indicators (η, NPV, CO2eq avoided) are calculated. Afterwards, these data are used in a computational routine in Matlab, for application of Kriging method, to determine objective function, which allows to relate input variables (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) to performance indicators, being, a function F such that F(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) = (η, NPV, CO2eq avoided). In order to estimate and evaluate the surrogate model, an experimental and test designs may be used two design. The first called experiment run is used to estimate a surrogate model according to Kriging model of regression. Through the experimental run is obtained a preliminary objective function. The second design, called the experimental test, is used to measure the error between the objective design function and the value of the design. If the error converges to values small enough, we use the function find, and otherwise, we need to improve the experimental and test design, adding more points. That is, experimental design is used to estimate a surrogate model according to ordinary Kriging model. As for test design, it is used to validate the estimated surrogate model. This is done by computing a MSE (Mean Square Error) and correlation coefficient (R2) [35], as presented in Eqs. (3) and (4) respectively. (3) MSE = 1 n ∑ h = 1 k ( x i - x itest ) 2 (4) R 2 = 1 - ∑ h = 1 k ( x i - x itest ) 2 ( x i - x itest ¯ ) 2 where xi are predicted values from the estimated surrogate model and xi test is the simulated results over test design. After all, simulations have been made, results of performance indicators are obtained. So, each point of a design corresponds to a biorefinery configuration that is characterized by a set of indicators. Thus, it is possible to relate calculated indicators, with their respective values for design points through an objective function, that relates input values (bagasse and syngas distribution for each process expressed through variables x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5), to quantities or produced products (ethanol, electricity, biobutanol, etc), and to performance indicators (NPV, efficiency, avoided emissions). This function, in turn, allows determining biomass allocation for maximum efficiency, as well as NPV for two modes considered, in addition to CO2eq avoided emissions, for Brazilian or average emissions scenario. A computational routine was elaborated in Matlab ® software, that provides a point of greatest overall efficiency, net productivity per hectare, NPV (for modalities 1 and 2), and avoided CO2eq emissions. To evaluate plants characteristics considered in any design, a technical-economic-environmental analysis of all points contemplated in designs, is carried out. This analysis – done through calculation of performance indicators – allows a visualization of best alternatives from the energetic, economic and environmental point of view."
7,Biorefinery description,"3.1 Biorefinery description From each tone of sugarcane entering milling station, 280 kg of bagasse is obtained with 50% moisture [14,62]. Each ton of harvested sugarcane left 140 kg of straw in the field, however, it is recommended a maximum of 50% of total straw available to be removed from the field to be used as fuel, other 50% must be left in the soil, due to agronomic issues [63,64]. Thus, from 1,200 hourly tons of sugarcane arriving at a mill, it is assumed that half of the available straw in the field is used as fuel in for energy cogeneration, it means that 97.6 t/h of straw in cane field is available, with a moisture of 15%. Amount of bagasse used in steam cogeneration cycle was considered according to CALDEMA boiler manufacturer data [63], which reports that maximum percentage of straw in bagasse mix must be 50%, thus bagasse amount used as fuel in cogeneration corresponds to 97.6 t/h. Also, it is necessary to provide an amount of bagasse to be stored, to be used in plants start-up operation after the off-season, this usually corresponds to 10% of all bagasse available [65]. So 33.6 t/h of bagasse will be stored. Table 1 shows operational parameters adopted at plant and properties of components of mixture used as fuel in cogeneration cycle. (Inlet values of the cogeneration cycle). Therefore, bagasse quantity really available remains at 204.8 t/h, and this value will be distributed to supply raw material for biochemical and thermochemical processes. Available bagasse will be converted into products of interest in annexed installations to the sugar factory, to use common facilities and infrastructure. Conversion processes for selected items production are described below. 3.1.1 Lignocellulosic ethanol In case of cellulosic ethanol, pre-treatment by steam explosion with diluted acid uses steam at 37 bar, hydrolysis and fermentation occur in different reactors (SHF), such as described by Walter and Ensinas [44]. Fig. 4 shows a flowchart of lignocellulosic ethanol process. 3.1.2 Lignocellulosic butanol Biobutanol process uses biomass pretreated by steam explosion with diluted acid, similar to that used in 2G bioethanol process, but by using saturated steam injection at 12 bar. In this work, ABE fermentation was assumed to have energy and products consumption such as in Fig. 5 . For more details, see Nuncira [69]. 3.1.3 Gasification For applications through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and electricity generation in a BIG-GTCC, it is required a syngas that must be of high CO and H2 content, that could be achieved through entrained flow gasification. This technology requires a pretreatment process to ensure properties such as granulometry, moisture content, and energy density. In this work, bagasse pre-treatment consists of drying to adjust moisture, followed by torrefaction and grinding, so that after pre-treatment bagasse shows characteristics similar to milled mineral coal, with a mean particle size of 0.1 mm. Gasification uses oxygen as an oxidizing agent, which is produced in a cryogenic type air separation unit, which supplies oxygen with 95% purity. For entrained bed gasification, it is necessary to provide 0.7 kg of O2 per kg of biomass to be gasified [70]. It is assumed that produced oxygen is sent to gasification process at 30 bar pressure, same pressure at which entrained bed gasification occurs [71,72]. Gasification syngas has a chemical composition as presented in Table 2 . Syngas cleaning removes undesirable compounds that could deactivate catalysts, clog, wear and erode pipes, reducing equipment life, and decreasing overall process efficiency. In this study, cold RECTISOL technology was used for syngas cleaning, through the utilization of refrigerated methanol removing components which produce acid gases such as COS, CO and H2S. In addition, all sulfur, initially present in syngas, is converted to H2S. The removal efficiency of CO2 and H2S were assumed 97% and 100% respectively. Cleaning process consumes steam at 4.8 bar and 180 °C, at a rate of 6.97 kg/kmol (CO2 + H2S) and electricity consumption corresponds to 1,900 kJ/kmol (CO2 + H2S) [74]. After cleaning step, syngas contains only 3% of carbon dioxide initial amount, in addition to hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Fig. 6 shows a flowchart of syngas gasification and cleaning (Fig. 7 ). 3.1.4 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis For Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, clean syngas must have a high degree of purity, but for its use for FT fuels production, it is still necessary to make an adjustment of its composition. These adjustments consist in conversion of methane present to CO and H2, done through steam reforming. Being also necessary to reach a hydrogen-carbon monoxide concentrations relation (H2/CO ratio) close to 2.01 [75]. 3.1.4.1 Steam reforming Steam reforming is a highly exothermic chemical reaction, and to meet its energy demand, steam at 15 bar and 600 °C is injected to syngas in a reforming reactor, in a quantity equivalent to 3 times the required stoichiometric quantity of steam, according to reaction (1). It means that, for each mole of CH4, 3 mols of steam must be injected [76]. In this reaction a mass gain of syngas happens, corresponding to 1 mol of water (steam), for each mole of CH4 present in syngas; electricity consumption in this step corresponds to 0.20 kWh per kg of syngas that enters steam reforming reactor [77]. 3.1.4.2 Shift reactions For Fischer-Tropsch liquids production, a ratio of hydrogen and carbon monoxide concentrations of 2.01 is needed [73]. Adjustment of H2 and CO concentrations through a gas-water shift reaction is done, conversion of CO into H2 occurs through steam addition, resulting in carbon dioxide and hydrogen [75,76], steam at 20 bar and 350 °C is used, at a rate of 3 mols of steam for each mole of CO and electricity consumption of 140 kJ per kg of syngas, which enters process [77]. Having appropriate chemical composition, syngas can be sent to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, for fuels production. So, it was considered this process occurs with steam injection at 25 bar and 220 °C, when aiming maximum Diesel production an electricity demand of 31 kJ per kilogram of syngas enters synthesis reactor [77]. From synthesis step a product obtained is a mixture of hydrocarbons, being necessary to separate them before their final use. This separation is done by distillation, a process requiring a quantity of thermal energy of 1.95 MJ for each kg of hydrocarbon. Fig. 8 shows mass and energy balance of a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 3.1.5 Electricity and steam generation in power cycles Fuel for BIG-GTCC is a result of mixing syngas produced in gasification reactor with gas phase products generated in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. LHV of this fuel will depend on the fraction of syngas and gases from FT synthesis presented in its composition. This fuel is injected to a gas turbine, at an inlet pressure of 30 bar, and exhaust gases are used in a heat recovery boiler to produces steam at 85 bar and 480 °C, expanded in a back pressure electric generation turbine with an outlet pressure of 2.5 bar. After gasification, syngas temperature is 1,250 °C and cooling down to 40 °C is required to enter the cleaning step using RECTISOL process. This energy is recovered in a boiler, similar to what occurs in IGCC plants, where syngas heat recovery boiler produces saturated steam at 85 bar. In simulation done it was considered that inlet gases temperature of exhaust heat recovery boiler is above 480 °C [71,72,78]. In Table 3 values of parameters adopted for simulation are shown."
8,Energy analysis,"3.2 Energy analysis Evaluation of energy performance of different biorefineries will be done through plant overall efficiency calculations, can be performed from Eq.

9,Economic analysis,"3.3 Economic analysis Biorefinery processes are assumed to be independent, with no common processes steps, and investment in plant construction is based on installing one from another plants capacity. These values are assumed based on data reported in literature and will be corrected through CEPCI indices, supplied for Chemical Engineering Magazine [83]. For evaluation, investment net present value (NPV), calculated by Eq. (6), was used as indicators. (6) NPV = ∑ n = 1 25 Cash F l o w ( 1 + i ) n - T o t a l I n v e s t i m e n t For calculation of necessary investment for processing plants built-up, costs of commercial plants or process equipment existing and reported in the literature and whose capacities are known were used as a reference. For investment value calculation for each plant, it will be used cost-capacity Eq. (7) so that for reference case values reported in literature will be used. Value of “α” for the type of equipment adopted, and for construction of processing plants, corresponds to 0.6 [84]. (7) Cost 2 = Cost 1 C apacity 2 C apacity 1 α Index C E P C I D e c 2016 Index C E P C I Ref. date Investment costs are adjusted to December 2016, through CEPCI Index [83], and economic parameters used in the analysis are presented in Table 5 . The sales prices are shown in Table 8. Considered production costs are related to salaries, maintenance, and operation, and labor cost for an FT processing plant, corresponds to 2,000 Euros per input thermal MW [49]. This value was considered as constant for all plants. Maintenance and operating costs were considered to be 4% of total investment [88,90]. In BIG-GTCC cycle and cogeneration cycle, maintenance and operation costs were considered as US$ 144.00 per installed kW and US$ 84.00 per kW [91]. Variable costs correspond to costs of raw material, which in case of a cogeneration cycle it is fuel for boilers, being bagasse and straw. Costs of enzymes for E2G and B2G processes were estimated at US$ 0.05 per liter of ethanol produced [86] and US$ 0.085/kg of butanol produced [92]. 3.3.1 Lignocellulosic ethanol plant cost Investment in ethanol production, based on data of Bioflex plant corresponds to US$ 1.22 per liter of installed production capacity. This plant is located in São Miguel dos Campos in Alagoas State and has a production capacity of 82 million liters of ethanol per crop, produced from bagasse and sugarcane straw, starts inaugurated in 2014 at an investment cost of R$ 300 million [93]. 3.3.2 Lignocellulosic butanol plant cost Currently, there is only one unit producing biobutanol that uses sugarcane substrates in Brazil, belonging to HC Sucroquímica Company, with a process that involves ABE fermentation. However, this plant does not use sugarcane biomass as a raw material in butanol production and use cane molasses. [93]. So, in this work was assumed the cost reported by Clifford [94], giving an investment cost for biobutanol production from wheat straw, under USA conditions, of a plant of an annual capacity of 150 thousand tons, of US$ 162.02 million. Specific investment of this plant corresponds to US$ 1.08 per kg of butanol produced, and cost reported by Clifford [94]. 3.3.3 Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch plant cost There are only a few commercial-scale biomass gasification plants, and some pilot plant projects have not been continued. Table 6 the shows costs of equipment used in gasification and FT synthesis. 3.3.4 BIG-GTCC cycle cost As costs of this equipment have already been accounted in the gasification plant, only values for a gas turbine, recovery boiler, and steam cycle remain to be estimated. Costs of these equipment were estimated according to Larson [89], for a cycle with 227.59 MW installed capacity, and are presented in Table 7 . 3.3.5 Cogeneration investment cost In this study, it is assumed that cogeneration cycle will be built next to plant so operating parameters are similar to those of modern plants such as those of ODEBRECHT and BIOSEV, which operate at 100 bar and 520 °C [59–61]. Erection cost of a steam cogeneration cycle plant is US$ 1,400 per installed kW, and fixed costs refer to equipment maintenance, are US$ 84 per installed kWh [91]. 3.3.6 Adopted investment modalities To evaluate investments related to a biorefinery in sugar-alcohol plants, two investment modalities were considered, one (modality 1) considers a cogeneration cycle built up, together with other biomass conversion units. Second modality (modality 2) does not consider costs of construction of cogeneration cycle, and it is assumed a conventional plant has a system able to operate with parameters such as COSAN plants (100 bar and 520 °C) shown in DEDINI [61]. In this case, only revenues from electricity sale from BIG-GTCC system are considered in cash flow calculation, and costs of straw acquisition, as well as costs of steam cogeneration cycle maintenance, are neglected."
10,Environmental analysis,"3.4 Environmental analysis Environmental analysis evaluates benefits of using biomass, so products generated by it will replace other products of fossil origin. Ethanol, for example, is a biofuel that can substitute other petroleum-based fuels like gasoline. Thus, emissions of gasoline being replaced by ethanol would be avoided, since ethanol has neutral emissions, considering its use only as fuel. Quantities of avoided CO2 equivalent given in tons of CO2 eq equivalent per MJ are shown in Table 8 (amounts of CO2eq avoided by each product)."
11,Considerations,"3.5 Considerations To develop a mathematical model, some considerations have been made referring to characteristics and limitations of process equipment. Gasifier in question is of entrained bed type, regardless amount of bagasse will be gasified. It is noteworthy this type of gasifiers works in plants using raw materials of fossil origin, and in this study, these gasifiers are supposed to be adapted to operate with sugarcane bagasse, after its pretreatment. Also, it is assumed all gas turbines used in this study are commercially available in versions suitable for operation with LHV fuels, such as syngas produced through considered gasification technologies. As mentioned earlier, there are major efforts to produce gas turbines able to use fuels with low LHV. Some manufacturers already have such equipment available, GE with LM2500 turbine line, and SIEMENS with SGT line [102–104]. In some cases of design, due to absence of GE gas turbines, and of SIEMENS SGT, that could operate in required power range, turbines were selected at Gatecycle software library, assuming they are able to operate under study condition."
12,Extreme points evaluation,"3.6 Extreme points evaluation In dealing with biorefiney optimization problem trough DCOE, the process variable vector is given by xT = [x1 x2 x3 x4 x5]. Here, variables x1, x2, and x3 indicate bagasse fractions allocated to lignocellulosic ethanol process, biobutanol and gasification respectively so that a sum of these variables equals 1. Also, the variables x4 and x5 refer to fractions of syngas produced, so that the sum of x4 and x5 is equals 1. Furthermore, it was assumed an experimental design consisting of 50 points obtained by an LHD with maxmin criteria over reduced process variables xT = [x1 x2 x4]. Recall that such vector may be rewritten as xT = [x1 x2 x3 x4 x5], since x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 and x4 + x5 = 1. Importantly, extreme points (E2G, B2G, FT1, FT2, BGT), were also considered when fitting the surrogate model, being added to experimental design. Two other points were considered in the analysis, with the base case (BSE) and zero case (ZRO). Though the Base (BSE) and zero (ZRO) cases do not belong to evaluated designs, they are used only as a reference, and were simulated and included on the results analysis. BSE point is represented by (⅓ ⅓ ⅓ ½ ½), in which each process receives a third of available bagasse, and syngas produced in gasification is equally divided between Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and BIG-GTCC cycle. Point ZRO corresponds to the situation in which all bagasse is used as fuel in the steam cycle, no bagasse processing plant being built, and considers that all available bagasse, instead of being sent to biorefinery processes, is burned in boilers of steam cogeneration cycle for electricity production. Notice that the experimental design used here has 55 experimental runs: 50 generated by LHD with maxmin criteria, 5 extreme points. The experimental design described above allows one in obtaining the surrogate model through Kriging approach described in Section 2. In order to test the fitted model, a test design is generated with 40 points, also using LHD with maxmin criteria. Once the surrogate model is tested and accepted, i.e., the error between test design and surrogate model is small, surrogate model may be used as objective function of the problem under consideration. Notice that, to obtain a reliable surrogate model, we performed 95 computational simulations runs were performed. Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood method, elaborated by Li and Sudjanto [105], in which method penalize likelihood function through a lambda parameter, in order to avoid divergence of method in an estimation of method equation 1 parameters. In other words, there is selected parameter λ so R2 (Eq. (4)) value, allows to reach highest possible values."
13,Results,"Performance indicators calculation of mass and energy balances were carried out, according to bagasse distribution among processes. Based on quantities of products manufactured by each process, both plants capacity and investment required for its construction were determined, as well as CO2 eq avoided emissions due to-production of same goods without fossil resources. It is important to mention some limitations verified as a result of modeling. It was observed that some points have so high thermal and electric energy demand, that system was not able to supply it. In this work an option was to disregard these cases, treating them as model limitations. Thus, simulations showed that a region between points (0 0 1 0.8 0.2) and (0 0 1 1 0), has a high energy demand and available bagasse and straw were not enough to supply energy demand. So, for these points to be viable, it is necessary to provide the plant with an additional amount of fuel. For point (0 0 1 1 0), it is assumed that additional bagasse quantities were acquired to satisfy process demands, neglecting economic issues. It would be necessary to buy 36.02 tons of fuel composed by a mixture of straw (15% moisture) and bagasse (50% moisture) every hour. If only bagasse is used as fuel, 48.37 t/h must be required. In this situation, plant efficiency would be 62.0%, significantly lower than maximum efficiency observed (63.8% at point FT 2, indicating that in cases where all bagasse is destined to gasification, the maximum amount of syngas that can be sent to FT synthesis will be only 80% of total produced)."
14,Energy consumption in processes,"4.1 Energy consumption in processes Regarding process energy demands, conventional processes of ethanol and sugar production are responsible for most of heat and electricity consumption. The conventional process has a heat consumption of 380.38 MWh, related to steam at 2.5 bar. Electric consumption of conventional process represents 33.6 MWh, of which 14.4 MWh correspond to internal process equipment consumption, such as pumps, stirrers, and others and also energy for lighting, remaining 19.2 MWh are used to power mills."
15,Energy analysis results,"4.2 Energy analysis results In all cases, both ethanol and sugar produced in conventional process were accounted, being, ethanol and sugar energetic content of 312.96 MW and 373.53 MW, respectively and the same for all experiments. Vinasse, generated, both in conventional and biochemical processes, was not considered as a product, and a fraction of it is intended to be used in cane fields through fertirrigation, and its energy content was not taken into account in calculations. Baseline (BSE) indicators were also considered, in addition to ZRO (0 0 0 0 0) case ones, which indicates a situation in which all available bagasse is used as fuel in steam cogeneration cycle. Process that individually has worst energy performance is that of biobutanol, followed by lignocellulosic ethanol process with global efficiency values of 52.0% and 55.84% respectively. These values are considerably lower than those when using thermochemical routes such as BGT, FT1 and FT2 cases. Even ZRO case (zero case) has an overall efficiency of 60.56% higher than biochemical routes. Best energy performance was observed in Fischer-Tropsch process, in point (0 0 1 0.8 0.2), with global efficiency of 63.9%. For a better understanding of reasons for this, Table 9 presents values referred to energy demand of processing of 1 ton of bagasse in each process. Important to mention that burning of lignin cake, generated in E2G and B2G processes, provides a significant amount of additional energy that makes the process viable, and if it is neglected biorefinery processes could not have its thermal demand satisfied, compromising plant operation. An assessment of point (1 0 0 0 0) showed only straw and bagasse would not be enough to meet process thermal demand, and additional 44.71 t/h of bagasse (50% moisture) would be required as boilers fuel in Rankine cycle. Considering a mixture of straw (15% moisture) and bagasse (50% moisture) is used, the overall efficiency of E2G process would fall from 55.8% to 48.9%. B2G process case is dependent on use of lignin cake as fuel, since its thermal demand is higher than that of the E2G process, so lignin non-utilization would make production process unfeasible. Use of lignin cake allows also a generation of higher quantities of surplus electricity. In case of highest efficiency point, there are high energy demands, with much higher electricity consumption than in E2G process (226.74 kWh/tb for FT2 point and 92.5 kWh/tb for E2G), where amount of electricity produced at point FT2 does not exceed that at point E2G. ZRO case efficiency is 60.6%, higher than efficiencies of E2G and B2G points having values of 55.8% and 52.0% respectively. But, in cases where most bagasse was destined for FT synthesis, greater overall efficiencies were observed. In addition, individually FT synthesis presents highest efficiency, having greater participation, and efficiency. A relevant result is that from process efficiency point of view, it is advisable to destine all raw material to be exploited in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, being higher efficiency value process. Fig. 8 shows global efficiency and energy production for the extreme points. Comparing processes of ethanol and cellulosic butanol production, it's clear that efficiencies of these processes alone correspond to 55.8% for E2G and 52.0% for B2G. Thermal consumption of B2G process is a factor that contributes to its lower attractiveness in relation to all other conversion processes considering overall efficiency. This indicates B2G needs improvements, mainly related to reducing steam consumption in pretreatment and fermentation, which are stages consuming large amounts of energy, as in distillation of three components mixture. In addition, there are high values of electric consumption in cases with high participation of gasification. Also, entrained bed gasification demands oxygen at a purity level of 95%, which is obtained through high energy consuming systems, so values of electric consumption refer mainly to energy used in oxygen production unit ASU. It must be considered that nergy demand of syngas cleaning system is insignificant in relation to total requirements. Regarding thermal consumption, B2G process is the largest consumer of this energy through high steam process demands, due to ABE fermentation, pre-treatment, and mainly in distillation stage, because of a mix of components obtained at fermentation. FT process demands large amounts of thermal energy, since – in addition to gasification step –, syngas conditioning reactions (steam reforming and shift reaction) are high steam consumers, in addition to bio-hydrocarbon mixture distillation process. When comparing BGT and ZRO cases, it should be considered all available bagasse is destined to electric energy production, so firstly case use of BIG-GTCC systems is more efficient than Rankine cycles used in second one. It had been found in BGT case η value of is 61.2%, but same variable for ZRO case is 60.6%. This represents an advantage in adoption of BIG-GTCC. Questions regarding installing and operating costs of this technology should be considered and will be done in a later stage of this study."
16,Economic analysis results,"4.3 Economic analysis results A considerable fraction of investments to be made must be destined to construction of the cogeneration plant with 100 bar and 520 °C, for example, considering BSE case such investments correspond to 38% of the total. The results of two analyzed investment modalities for the BSE will follow. 4.3.1 Modality 1 Investment sharing of BSE case is presented in Fig. 9 a and b that show economic results as NPV investment value and gross profit per period. Biobutanol process provides best economic results, with smaller required investments for its erection, so representing best alternative. As larger amounts of biomass are destined for this alternative, greater enterprise feasibility will be obtained. For B2G, highest NPV value (US$ 283.75 million) was observed, and considering a minimum attractiveness rate of 10%, IRR for this process is 19.4%. Comparing these values with those of BSE case, we have a negative NPV of US $ 361.58 million. Butanol produced in B2G process can be used both as biofuel and as input for chemical industry, being this one more financially attractive, since each kg of butanol, when marketed as fuel has a sales price of US$ 1.03, and as a chemical raw material is US$ 1.65. If butanol is to be used as fuel, NPV of B2G would be US$ 80.14 million with an IRR of 10.2%. Plant capacity was based on manufacturing capacity of process products from lignocellulosic ethanol and butanol, any comparison of plants must be made on a production basis, instead of their biomass capacity to be processed. Thus E2G process, in addition of having bigger investments costs, has lower revenues. Another relevant part of required investments is referred to thermochemical route. For BSE this amount corresponds to 42.0% of total investment value, whereas biochemical processes represent 14.0% of total investment. Another factor that contributes to financial unfeasibility of thermochemical processes is its negative gross profit, which means that production costs (fixed variables) are higher than revenues obtained, as observed in BGT, FT1 and FT2 cases. Worst economic performance was observed in BGT case, that has second largest investment value (US$ 852.21 million), as well as a negative gross profit (−US$ 22.33 million), which can be attributed to high maintenance costs of gasification, BIG-GTCC and cogeneration systems investments, which are respectively US$ 54.52, US$ 27.16 and US$ 18.87 million per harvest, together with cost of bagasse US$ 3.25 million for cogeneration and US$ 6.82 million for gasification) and US$ 9.27 million for straw, while it has a revenue of US$ 90.23 million. In general, in Modality 1, biorefinery process implantation does not reach economic viability. In fact, conversion technologies adopted in this study are still in development phase. 4.3.2 Modality 2 Different from Modality 1, building investments of cogeneration cycle, its maintenance costs, as well as costs related to acquisition of additional straw, and revenues from the sale of electricity produced in steam cycle are not considered. Only revenues obtained from sale of electricity generated in BIG-GTCC system are added to cash flow and better financial results are shown than those observed in Modality 1. Thermochemical route accounts for 70.0% of investments required for biorefinery construction, being gasification its most expensive system, with investments higher than those of biochemical processes. Economic results of modality 2 were better than those of modality 1, although most points of design have shown negatives NPV. Even without revenues related to the sale of electricity, ventures presented higher returns in relation to BSE case. Revenues from electricity sale were considerably lower in modality 2 since electricity generated by the steam cycle was not considered in Project cash flow. A fact to be emphasized is that steam turbine of the BIG-GTCC system is of back pressure and produces steam at a pressure of 2.5 bar, feeding also productive processes. It was not evaluated in this modality maximization of electricity generation by the BIG-GTCC since the function of this one is only of supplying biorefinery thermal and electrical demands. In both Modalities (1 and 2) worst performing point was BGT, with negative NPV of US$ 971.14 million, since production costs (fixed and variable) are higher than revenues obtained from electricity sale. Also, it is necessary to consider high costs referred to investment in BIG-GTCC system. Sale price of electricity that makes NPV void is R$ 700.75/MWh and in this condition, IRR is 7.0%. To reach an IRR of more than 10.0%, electricity sale price must be up to R$ 750.60/MWh, which shows how expensive this technology is. In addition, for adoption of a purely thermochemical route, it is necessary to allocate 20.0% of syngas to BIG-GTCC system, so this along, with steam cogeneration cycle, can supply FT process energy demand. Thus, high investments required for the build-up of a BIG-GTCC make this venture economically unfeasible. Highest revenues are obtained in case 24, and FT2 (US$ 84.58 million and US$ 80.58), both admitting that large amounts of biomass are destined for Fischer-Tropsch gasification and synthesis. These revenues are higher than US$ 80 million, higher than those US$ 78.07 million observed in B2G case having highest NPV. However, these two cases have negative NPVs because of high investments required. In modality 1 context, it can be seen in cases when less than 8.1% of bagasse is destined to thermochemical route, NPV is above zero, as observed in points 9, 20 and 38 of a design of 40 points, besides extreme points E2G and B2G. Already, in Modality 2, due to lower investment requirements, maximum bagasse fraction can be destined to gasification process, so to reach NPV greater than zero, corresponds to 11.8%, a value considerably higher than in Modality 1. It is more evident high investments required for gasification, FT synthesis, and BIG-GTCC are a major hindrance for these technologies to achieve financial attractiveness. In fact, Brazil, selected as case study, does not have yet thermochemical biomass conversion plants, so conversion technologies adopted in this study are still under development. 4.3.3 Sensitivity analysis Results of economic indicators, as well as cash flows, were obtained through estimates that aim to reproduce market behavior at a specific moment, in terms of price and time, with calculated values of NPV and IRR. Those results may be distorted because do not take into account market variations over time. Thus, to verify NPV behavior, product price changes, raw materials, production costs, taxes, and rates were verified, and values related to investment influence economic viability, a sensitivity analysis was carried out for each types of investment analyzed. 4.3.3.1 Modality 1 In this analysis, it is accepted that prices of each item vary between −100% and 100% in relation to its current value. This analysis will be done for BSE case and can be extended to any case, showing predominant factors in final financial result. Fig. 10 a shows influence of sales prices of products manufactured over NPV for modality 1, and Fig. 10b shows sensibility of costs production. In sensitivity analysis, graphs of Fig. 10, NPV behavior is presented for variations in parameters used in economic analysis, such as product sales prices, investment, interest rate production costs, and higher the slope of the line corresponding to the parameter, greater its influence on NPV. Electricity price line has the highest slope, with final product having highest weight over NPV, and for prices of R $ 387.8 per MWh, NPV is null, and for R $ 447.7 per MWh IRR becomes higher than minimum rate of attractiveness. Prices of ethanol and butanol have practically same influence, being influence of the first slightly higher than of latter. Moreover, even if ethanol or butanol prices double, financial result remains negative. Other products have little influence over NPV. In case of cost variations of items that comprise production costs (fixed and variable), as well as in investments and interest rates, it can be seen in Fig. 10b that main variables influencing NPV are investment and interest rate. Being significant interest rate has other behavior from additional evaluated items, so different from a straight line, due to the nonlinear characteristic of interest in relation to NPV. If interest in financing a project is reduced from 7% per year to 2.93% per annum, NPV becomes null. In absence of interest, the value of IRR is 7.33%. In addition, required investment is a main variable of influence on NPV, and for a reduction of US $ 753.48 million to US$ 429.2 million, result becomes zero, and for reductions of US $ 372.44 million the IRR is more than 10%. In addition, interest has highlighted influence on NPV. Other items do not have as much relevant influence as the interest rate of financing, and value of the investment. 4.3.3.2 Modality 2 In modality 2, there was a reduction in influence of electricity price over NPV, since amount of electricity considered as plant products is due only to BIG-GTCC, amount referring to cogeneration system does not cash for plant that will be built, but in cash flow of conventional plant. Similar to modality 1, price of ethanol is a factor of greater influence over NPV, so in case selling price doubles, NPV value becomes zero. Same is true for butanol, in which influence in slightly lower than for ethanol. If biobutanol sales price increases by 100%, NPV becomes negative at US$ 7.85 million. In addition, electricity price suffered a reduction in its influence over NPV compared to modality 1, since in modality 2 it is considered only revenue from sales of electricity generated in BIG-GTCC cycle. As in modality 1, there is a greater influence of investment value and interest rate of financing over NPV. Items like labor, taxes, and costs of enzymes and raw materials, have a lower influence when compared with investment value and interest rate of finance."
17,Environmental analysis results,"4.4 Environmental analysis results Environmental analysis, shows that Fischer-Tropsh process allows highest avoided amount of CO2 eq., and worst alternative in this condition is BIG-GTCC electric generation process. Considering each process receives 1 ton of sugarcane bagasse, manufactured products avoid emissions as shown in Table 10 . Emissions avoided due to biobutanol process are much lower than in other processes since this process has a low mass yield. Fig. 11 shows avoided emissions of CO2 eq per harvest and electric surplus. In Fig. 11 it is possible to find that ZRO case, presents lowest amount of avoided emissions (218.56 thousand tons of avoided CO2 eq), in addition to a lower amount of energy produced. Electricity doesn’t have a relevant role in avoided emissions. Point of greatest surplus electricity observed is BGT, which generates 1042.5 GJ of electricity per hour, and this point has avoided 205.20 thousand tons of CO2 eq, which has second lower avoided emissions, behind ZRO case. Avoided emissions due to electricity generation have little weight, and thus that large amounts of biomass to electricity production over manufacture of chemicals and fuels have worse environmental indicators. This leads to conclusion that considering conditions of electricity emissions in the Brazilian electricity sector, from an environmental point of view, electricity generation is is not attractive. Given ethanol alone has a great impact on avoided emissions, and combined with large amounts of surplus electricity is able to avoid higher emissions. In biochemical routes, surplus electricity is higher than in thermochemical route, something which can be seen in relation to coproducts. In fact, use of lignin cake as fuel for steam and electricity generation allows achievement of higher values of surplus electricity."
18,Interrelation of indicators,"4.5 Interrelation of indicators To verify relation of indicators, a graph was plotted on overall efficiency as a function of the NPV, and emission avoided as a function of NPV. To facilitate presentation, only points of design with 40 points and extreme points, and are shown in Fig. 12 . According to Fig. 12, most of points analyzed in Modality 1 are within reddish range of figure, which indicates a region of economic unfeasibility. Only 5 points present positive NPV outside reddish region, and in these biorefinery configurations, most of bagasse is destined for biochemical route. In addition, there is an inverse trend between NPV and overall efficiency, in addition to NPV relation with avoided emissions in two scenarios analyzed. Trendline was estimated assuming a linear regression, and the relationship between overall efficiency and NPV has an R2 coefficient, higher than cases of avoided emissions and NPV. Points with positive NPV are presented in Table 11 , along with bagasse distribution. Similarly, Fig. 13 shows dispersion of overall efficiency and of avoided emissions of CO2eq values as a function of NPV for investment modality 2, in which a greater number of points are outside nonviabilty economic region. Such as in Modality 1, it is observed an inverse trend between NPV and efficiency, and NPV and avoided CO2eq emissions. However, there are more points within the region of economic viability. Points within economically viable region for Modality 2 are presented in Table 12 , in which, as in same way of Modality 1, a predominance of biochemical routes is evident. Both, in Table 11 of Modality 1, and in Table 12 of Modality 2, it is shown a fraction of bagasse destined to gasification (x3) that corresponds to less than 12% of total available amount, and in best case, this value corresponds to point 7 with 11.8% of 204.8 t/h of available bagasse. Biorefinery configuration of point 7, modality 2 has an overall efficiency of 55.5% and avoided emissions of 416.87 tons of CO2eq. These values represent best set of indicators can be achieved by biorefinery. Even if there are other biorefinery configurations which allow reaching higher values of efficiency, NPV or emissions avoided, when analysis is done, in a global way, point 7 is the best configuration."
19,Computational experiments results,"4.6 Computational experiments results As a result of the computational experiments, we obtained an objective function that relates the 5 input variables (x1 x2 x3 x4 x5), with a performance indicator, constituting a hypersurface. One way to visualize the response surface is plotting the objective function from 2 variables. For the elaboration of the computational experiment through the Kriging method, it is necessary to define two parameters: a value of q which is spatial correlation function, and value of λ that represents the penalty of the objective function, as sh. Although the value of q can assume values between 1 and 2, for values of q equal to 2 objective function is infinitely differentiable, and it was observed that the response surfaces obtained from q = 2, are smooth without the presence of arrests. As for parameter λ, there is no method for its selection, and this was done in such a way as to obtain the objective function, to provide the greatest likelihoodness with the points of design, in other words, that the correlation coefficient R2 of this parameter is the highest possible. Thus, following response surfaces were obtained, and are presented in Fig. 14 : • Global Efficiency (η): Obtained result gives values of indicators, along with its confidence interval. In base case, for example, efficiency determined through simulation corresponds to 56.6%, and provided by objective function corresponds to 56.6% which is in a 95,0% confidence interval and can vary between 56.6% and 56.7%. • Net present value (NPV) – Modality 1: For BSE case, NPV obtained from objective function is negative, corresponding to US$ 361.58 million, and varies within the confidence interval from US$ 362.66 million to US$ 357.33 million. • Net present value (NPV) – Modality 2: For modality 2, BSE case has NPV provided by objective function corresponds to a negative value of US $ 180.00 million, which is in 95% confidence interval between US$ 181.60 and US$ 178.40 million negatives. Response surface of modality 2 is similar to surface of modality 1, but shifted to positive direction of NPV axis. In this case, it is possible processes lignocellulosic ethanol and biobutanol to operate in a biorefinery having economic viability. • Avoided CO2 eq emissions: For values of x1 and x2 tending to zero, avoided emissions are maximum since maximum avoided emission values were obtained in thermochemical processes. In case of BSE, avoided emissions obtained from objective function correspond to 394.00 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per crop, within a confidence interval between 392.59 and 395.41 tonnes of CO2eq; this value is 7.3% higher than a value observed in computational simulation (367.30 tons). This difference was neglected since BSE case represents an illustrative point, in which all biomass was equally shared among processes to allow visualization of system behavior. This point is outside a region in which it is desired system operates, for example, it is unlikely to be implemented a biorefinery with these characteristics because only financial result of that point would make it unfeasible. Note maximum and minimum points are comprised within confidence function interval."
20,Conclusions,"By analyzing a Brazilian biorefinery case, results have shown that from a point of view of global efficiency, it is interesting to prioritize FT fuel production, instead of other alternatives. However, when all bagasse is destined to gasification, all syngas produced can’t be used in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, since in this case, energy process demand reaches so high values that cogeneration steam cycle is not able of supplying, required thermal demand through a BIG-GTCC cycle. Thus, when allocating all biomass available for gasification, at least 20% of produced syngas should be used at BIG-GTCC cycle, this setting being most efficient, about 64%. Moreover, from an economic point of view, thermo-chemical processes demand of high investments make them economically unviable. From an environmental point of view, it was shown thermochemical route can avoid an amount of CO2eq higher than biochemical routes. Process of better economic performance is lignocellulosic butanol process, in which products manufactured have a high added value. Biorefinery configurations in which greater part of bagasse is destined to this process, presented higher economic viability, being in modality 1 an NPV about 8.3 times greater than NPV of lignocellulosic ethanol process. This difference is 2.1 for modality 2. But, from energetic and environmental point of view, this process presented worst results. E2G ethanol, even though it is not a process having highest performance indicators, but has best combination of indicators and make it, in general, a most attractive alternative in comparison to another process. In some cases, for a performance indicator calculation, were observed differences between calculation made through computational simulations, and calculation made through objective function. Investment value is an indicator of greater influence over NPV in both modalities, followed by enterprise financing interest value rate. Biorefinery configurations with great participation of thermochemical route, present better energetic and environmental results, but are not economically viable, presenting investments costs considerably superior to processes of biochemical routes. In fact, of all analyzed systems, lignocellulosic ethanol process presents, under Brazilian sugar and ethanol sector context, a greater degree of commercial consolidation, with some plants in initial stages of commercial operation. In addition, analyzed biorefinery configurations are more propitious to be deployed in plants already have steam/electricity cogeneration systems operating with high pressure and temperature parameters, because they attain a more efficient operation with lower fuel consumption (bagasse and straw), and greater bagasse availability. Finally, this work presented for a first time a theoretical approach for optimal distribution of bagasse for conversion processes, although in a real case, an owner of a sugarcane plant, won’t use all conversion routes, such as shown in BSE case. In fact, results show production diversification, while allowing non-dependence on a single product, requires high investments that affect economic viability of observed configurations. Thermochemical route, having best energy and environmental performance, has a negative economic result, making unfeasible its implementation. But importantly, although applied in a Brazilian biorefiney, analysis and optimization of other energy allocation problems may also be handled by design of computer experiments approach exploited in this paper. Being very useful results which can be applied in any sugar-alcohol installation in any cane sugar producing country."
