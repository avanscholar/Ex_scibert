0,Introduction,"Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is one of the most environmentally friendly ways of valorizing waste biomass and energy crops. Methane, contained in biogas, can be combusted in cogeneration units for generating heat and electricity. Although waste materials and manure have been the most widely used substrates in anaerobic digestion, by the emerging of the “second-generation biofuel” term, lignocellulosic energy crops also started to gain attraction as substrate. In the last decade, increasing demand for renewable energy has led to a growing interest in anaerobic digestion processes (Angelidaki et al., 2009). Particularly, energy crops with the ability to produce high amounts of carbohydrate-rich biomass showed promising results as a substrate or co-substrate in anaerobic digestion. One of the most promising energy crops, switchgrass, stands out with its agricultural advantages and rich biochemical characteristics. Switchgrass is a native North American perennial C4 grass that is highly adaptive; therefore, it can grow in many different climates and soil types (David and Ragauskas, 2010). It can reach a crop yield of more than 12 tonnes of biomass ha−1 that can be harvested and baled with available commercial haying equipment (Mitchell et al., 2012). Switchgrass consists of approximately 70 % holocellulose (Hu et al., 2011), which can be used for producing biofuels or platform chemicals (Nitsos et al., 2013). However, these carbohydrates in the lignocellulosic structure cannot be used without enzymatic hydrolysis or pretreatment. Lignocellulose is a very compact and rigid structure that consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are formed by crystalline glucose chains and amorphous pentoses - hexoses, respectively. These sugars are embedded within a lignin matrix that limits accessibility (Li et al., 2012). Due to lignin's biologically undegradable nature, it is resistant to biochemical attacks, and it has no biogas potential (Buffiere et al., 2006). Therefore, to reach the fermentable sugars in the lignocellulose, the lignin barrier needs to be overcome. For this purpose, several physical, physicochemical, chemical, and biological pretreatment methods were investigated in previous studies (Eskicioglu et al., 2017). Pretreatment methods focus on two main objectives. The first one is to hydrolyze the whole lignocellulosic structure to access the fermentable sugars (Nitsos et al., 2013). The second objective, on the other hand, is to increase the surface area or to delignify the biomass to allow enzymes to reach cellulose and hemicellulose fractions (Wi et al., 2015). To achieve a higher delignification or solubilized sugar yield, pretreatment methods with strong acids and elevated temperatures were investigated in the literature. However, the degradation of sugar at extreme conditions can cause the formation of inhibitors (Sun and Cheng, 2002), which can be a major issue for the downstream biochemical processes. Anaerobic digestion of switchgrass have been studied by focusing on methane yield for different harvesting seasons (Frigon et al., 2012; Kupryś-Caruk et al., 2019; Labatut et al., 2011; Massé et al., 2011), co-digestion with various substrates (Uma et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2020), anaerobic digestion kinetic modeling (Ciggin, 2016; El-Mashad, 2013; Jackowiak et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2019) and digestion in a continuous-flow anaerobic reactor with process performance evaluation (Jin et al, 2012, 2014; Jin and Bierma, 2014) in the literature. On the other hand, very limited work has been performed on methane production enhancement from switchgrass by pretreatment process (Başar and Perendeci, 2021; Capecchi et al., 2016; Jackowiak et al., 2011; Khalid et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2015). One of the pretreatment methods, alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP), showed promising results on various biomass. AHP pretreatment can be carried out at moderate temperatures without using acids, leading to less inhibitor formation (Ho et al., 2019; Rabelo et al., 2008). Furthermore, since hydrogen peroxide degrades into oxygen and water, no residues caused by the pretreatment process stay in the pretreated slurry (Rabelo et al., 2014). AHP pretreatment was investigated on corn cub (Su et al., 2015), corn stover (Banerjee et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012), cashew apple bagasse (Correia et al., 2013), sugar cane bagasse (Rabelo et al, 2008, 2011, 2014), Douglas-fir wood (Alvarez-Vasco and Zhang, 2013), miscanthus, sorghum, and Virginia mallow (Michalsk and Ledakowicz, 2014) in the literature. Also, Li et al. (2012) investigated the change in lignin characteristics with the application of AHP pretreatment to switchgrass. None of the above-mentioned articles studied the enhancement of methane production from switchgrass by AHP pretreatment. Previous studies investigated the effect of AHP pretreatment on various lignocellulosic sources and did not perform process optimization. Therefore, to fill this literature gap, the optimization of AHP pretreatment conditions for methane production from switchgrass was investigated in this study. Optimization attempts to improve the performance or yield of a process by changing important parameters (variables) in defined ranges (Ba and Boyaci, 2007). In order to optimize a process, the effect of independent variables on the results (responses) is mathematically modeled. Due to the requirement of interactive effects of independent variables to increase the prediction power (Lundstedt et al., 1998) of the model, the use of multivariate statistical techniques, like response surface methodology (RSM), are more preferred (Bezerra et al., 2008). As mentioned above, to the best of our knowledge, the promising AHP pretreatment technology has not been applied to switchgrass in the literature. In this study, using the biochemical methane potential (BMP) model and statistical methods, optimization was performed to maximize methane production from switchgrass and minimize process cost. To evaluate the effect of AHP pretreatment on the aqueous phase of pretreated switchgrass, soluble reducing sugar (sRS) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) concentrations were also modeled. Also, the effect of AHP pretreatment on switchgrass's surface structure and molecular bond characteristics were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Raw material,"2.1 Raw material Switchgrass samples were obtained from research purposed full-scale cultivation fields in Konya (Karapınar, Turkey). Field dried whole switchgrass samples were milled and sifted by using a 0.5 mm sieve. Size-reduced samples were mixed thoroughly to provide homogeneity. Milled samples were then stored in sealed plastic containers at room temperature until further analysis."
3,Biomass characterization,"2.2 Biomass characterization Biomass characterization of switchgrass was performed by using analyzes of total solids (TS) - volatile solids (VS) (AWWA/WEF/APHA, 1997a), soluble reducing sugar (sRS) (Miller, 1959), soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), Van Soest detergent fiber (Van Soest, 1963), and CHNS elemental analysis (LECO, CHNS-932). By using elemental analysis results, the theoretical methane yield and higher heating value (HHV) were calculated for switchgrass with Buswell equation (Buswell and Mueller, 1952) and the Dulong equation (Tchobanoglous et al., 1993), respectively."
4,Experimental design and setup,"2.3 Experimental design and setup For the experimental design of AHP pretreatment, a face centered central composite design (CCD), with 3 levels of each independent variable, was used. Switchgrass solids content (3–7%), reaction temperature (50–100 °C), H2O2 concentration (1–3%), and reaction time (6–24 h) were selected as independent variables for the experimental design. AHP pretreatment conditions designed with the CCD method and experimental flow chart are given in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. For statistical data analysis of the results, response surface method (RSM) was used. sRS, sCOD, and biochemical methane potential (BMP) results were used as responses. Experimental design and statistical analysis were both performed on Design Expert 11 software (Stat-ease Inc., MN, USA)."
5,Alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment,"2.4 Alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment AHP pretreatment experiments were conducted according to conditions designed by the CCD method. Pretreatment was performed in 1000 mL reactors with 300 mL working volume. WTW inoLab® Multi 9310 IDS pH meter was used for pH measurement. Firstly, the calculated amount of deionized water was added, and pH was adjusted to 11 with 10 M NaOH solution. After the pH adjustment, H2O2 was added to the reactor and mixed by a magnetic stirrer for 1 min. Desired amount of switchgrass, based on target TS content, was added, and the pH was readjusted to 11.5, which is slightly lower than the pKa (11.6) of H2O2. Finally, the reactor was closed with a condenser to avoid vapor-liquid loss and placed in a preheated oil bath. The pretreatment setup is presented in Fig. 2 . After the reactors reached the desired temperature, the reaction time was started. The temperature was constantly monitored during the reaction with a digital thermometer. During pretreatment, the reactors were continuously mixed with magnetic stirrers working at 200 rpm. At the end of reaction time, the temperature of the reactor content was rapidly cooled down by using an ice bath. Reactor contents were then centrifuged at 4400 rpm for 5 min to separate solids and liquid. Due to the low BMP of lignin-derived molecules (Barakat et al., 2012) and the high cost for neutralizing pH, liquid phase from the AHP pretreatment was not included in BMP tests. Solids were stored at −20 °C until the BMP test. Liquid samples were centrifuged one more time at 14500 rpm for 15 min for sRS and sCOD analyzes."
6,Determination of sRS and sCOD,"2.5 Determination of sRS and sCOD sRS and sCOD response variables were measured by colorimetric methods. Estimation of sRS was performed with 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller, 1959). sCOD, on the other hand, was measured with Hach-Lange LCK014 1000–10000 mg/L COD kits heated in Hach-Lange LT200 heating block."
7,Biochemical methane potential (BMP),"2.6 Biochemical methane potential (BMP) In order to determine the effect of AHP pretreatment on biochemical methane potential, solid fractions obtained from the pretreatment runs were used in BMP tests. The BMP method used in this study was previously reported by Carrère et al. (2009) and Perendeci et al. (2019) (Carrère et al., 2009; Perendeci et al., 2019). BMP tests were performed in 500 mL serum bottles with 400 mL of working volume. Seed sludge was taken fresh from the local municipal wastewater treatment plant's anaerobic digester, which is processing mixed sludge at mesophilic conditions. The initial substrate to seed ratio of 0.5 (g VS/g VS) was used in all reactors. Macro- and microelements were added to fulfill the nutrient need of seed sludge. Also, a buffer solution was added to avoid pH changes during the fermentation in batch reactors. Concentrations of macroelements, microelements, and buffer provided in all reactors are given in Table 2 . After adding the substrate, seed sludge, macroelements, microelements, and buffer solution, reactor content volume was set to 400 mL by adding deionized water. pH adjustment was performed to provide a neutral initial pH for the fermentation. Before sealing the reactors with rubber septa, all bottles' headspaces were flushed with N2/CO2 (70 %/30 %) gas mixture to provide an anaerobic environment. Reactors were then kept in an incubator (New Brunswick, Innova®43) at mesophilic conditions (35 °C) during the fermentation. The composition of biogas produced in reactors was measured on certain days with Varian CP-4900 Micro-Gas Chromatography. Total produced gas was measured with a gas-liquid displacement device using saturated pH 1 acidic salt solution prepared according to the Standard Method 2720 (AWWA/WEF/APHA, 1997b). All gas volumes were adjusted according to the standard state conditions (1 atm, 25 °C). Varian CP-4900 was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (online-TCD) and a 10 m PPQ column. Injector and column temperatures in Micro-GC were 110 °C and 70 °C, respectively. High purity grade helium gas was used as a mobile phase with a 25 mL/min flowrate. Methane produced from seed sludge was subtracted from the methane produced by reactors to normalize the results."
8,Surface structure and molecular bond characterization,"2.7 Surface structure and molecular bond characterization For determining the effect of AHP pretreatment on switchgrass's surface properties, scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was performed on untreated switchgrass, AHP pretreated sample under the most severe condition (100 °C, 24 h, 3 wt% H2O2, and 7 wt% solids), and AHP pretreated sample under the mildest condition (50 °C, 6 h, 3 wt% H2O2, and 7 wt% solids). Prior to SEM imaging, samples were lyophilized and coated with gold-palladium for 120 s under a 12 mA vacuum (Polaron, SC7620 Sputter Coater). After coating, the samples were examined at different magnifications, and images were captured with SEM (Zeis, Leo 1430) at 15 kV voltage. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Bruker, Tensor 27 FTIR) was used to evaluate the variation in samples’ molecular bond structure. Samples were lyophilized and pelletized with KBr before analyses. FTIR was performed with 16 scans per sample in the 400-4000 cm−1 wavelength range with a 4 cm−1spectral resolution."
9,Results and discussion,
10,Characterization of raw switchgrass,"3.1 Characterization of raw switchgrass Characterization analyzes were performed on field dried, milled, and homogenized switchgrass variety of Kanlow samples. Solids (TS/VS), Van Soest detergent fiber, and elemental analyses were performed as triplicate, whereas sRS and sCOD were duplicated. Mean values and standard deviations of characterization analyzes were presented in Table 3 . According to TS and VS analysis results, switchgrass was found to contain 5.17 wt% inorganic compounds (ash). Field dried switchgrass was found to have only 17.41 wt% moisture content. High TS concentration of field dried switchgrass, as also reported in a previous study for different switchgrass samples (Başar et al., 2020), indicates that at commercial-scale switchgrass cultivation, a drying process before utilizing switchgrass biomass is not required. In Van Soest detergent fiber analysis, the organic fraction of switchgrass was found to consist of 78.41 % pentoses and hexoses due to its cellulose and hemicellulose-rich structure. Furthermore, carbon content of switchgrass was found to be 43.34 %. Both high sugar and carbon content characteristics indicate that switchgrass is a suitable feedstock for biofuel production by a biochemical conversion method. Using elemental analysis results, HHV by Dulong's formula and theoretical methane potential by Buswell equation were calculated as 15.54 MJ/kg and 439.5 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. All characterization results were found consistent with the results presented in previous switchgrass studies (Carpenter et al., 2010; Da Silva Perez et al., 2015; Fahmi et al., 2007; Imam and Capareda, 2012; Jensen et al., 2008; Vamvuka et al., 2010)."
11,Effect of AHP pretreatment on switchgrass,"3.2 Effect of AHP pretreatment on switchgrass 3.2.1 Final pretreatment pH As a part of the pretreatment conditions, all experiments had an initial pH of 11.5. A change of pH is expected in AHP pretreatment due to the thermodynamically unstable nature of H2O2 (Koppenol and Bounds, 2017), particularly at alkaline conditions (Nicoll and Smith, 1955). Initial and final pH values in pretreatment reactors are given in Fig. 3 . The final pH values of reactors varied between 10.4 and 12.6 due to reactions or depletion of H2O2. The final pH was mainly found to change according to levels of two independent pretreatment variables, solid concentration and H2O2 concentration. Regardless of reaction temperature, AHP pretreatment at the high solid (7 wt%) and low H2O2 (1 wt%) concentrations resulted in decreased pH to 10.5 and 11.0 for 6 and 24 h reaction times, respectively. In these conditions, low concentration of H2O2 depleted, and switchgrass started to react with hydroxide ions (OH−). Therefore, pH slightly decreased due to decreasing hydroxide concentration. This result indicates that 1 wt% H2O2 concentration is low for pretreating 7 wt% solids. However, NaOH alone is known to perform delignification on switchgrass (Karp et al., 2015). Therefore, pretreatments taken place under those conditions are also beneficial in terms of increasing biodegradability. On the other hand, an increase in pH was observed for other conditions. This may indicate the depletion or the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 (Equation (1)) in those pretreatment experiments. However, catalytic conditions for the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 (Cheaib et al., 2019) were not present within the scope of this study's experimental design. Therefore, for the experiments with final pH of >11.5, it can be concluded that H2O2 was depleted. pH increase was caused by the depletion of H2O2, which is a weak acid (Pędziwiatr et al., 2018). Furthermore, pH values over 11.6 was not expected in the presence of H2O2 due to its pKa of 11.6. (Eq. 1) HO:OH → 2 •OH 3.2.2 Soluble organic compound (sRS and sCOD) release results Soluble organic compound (sRS and sCOD) release to the liquid phase was measured in order to determine the severity of AHP pretreatment on switchgrass. In this study, the main goal was to increase switchgrass's biodegradability by delignifying it during AHP pretreatment. Residual sugar-rich biomass can then be easily hydrolyzed and used in methane fermentation by the anaerobic consortium. Therefore, the AHP pretreatment step aimed to minimize the amount of hydrolyzed sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. sCOD was also used as an indicator of hydrolysis. However, unlike sRS, an increase in sCOD was expected due to the hydrolysis of aromatic lignin compounds such as sinapyl, coniferyl, and p-coumaryl alcohols (Terrell et al., 2020). The concentrations of sRS and sCOD in liquid phases after AHP pretreatment are presented in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), respectively. The sRS amount of untreated switchgrass was measured as 3.82 mg sRS/g VS. According to sRS results, the AHP pretreatment was not too severe to cause sugar loss, except for two conditions. Compared with other experiments, a significant increase in sRSs was observed at 100 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, and 3 wt% solids. For those pretreatment conditions, the sRSs were measured as 43.35 mg sRS/g VS for 24 h and 40.5 mg sRS/g VS for 6 h reaction times. Compared to untreated switchgrass, the highest sRS that was obtained at 100 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 3 wt% solids, and 24 h reaction time condition was found to be a 1034.8 % increase. Although it indicates substrate loss, it was calculated that 43.35 mg sRS/g VS sugar loss represents only 5.8 % of switchgrass sugars added to the pretreatment reactor. Furthermore, sRS may not be a reliable pretreatment indicator if sugars continue to degrade into further products, such as organic acids and furan compounds. The sCOD results showed a trend similar to the sRSs results. The highest sCOD was measured for the same condition which had the highest sRS. For 100 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 3 wt% solids, and 24 h reaction time condition, sCOD was found 1463.51 mg O2/g VS. Compared with the sCOD result of untreated switchgrass, which was 51.71 mg O2/g VS, at maximum, sCOD was increased by 2730.2 %. Although the two conditions with the highest sRS at 100 °C also had the highest sCOD results, their sRS amounts were not high enough to cause a significant effect on sCOD. These results, therefore, reflect the hydrolysis of fractions other than cellulose and hemicellulose or degradation of sugars. In the literature, Sun et al. (2015a) studied AHP pretreatment on wheat, maize, rice, rape, and cotton stalks. They reported that the lowest recovery among the fractions of lignocellulose after AHP pretreatment was for lignin. According to their results, at 35 °C, 2 wt% H2O2, 10 wt% solids, and 24 h reaction time, sCOD was changing between 127 and 280 mg O2/g VS for five different substrates. These results showed that higher H2O2 to solids ratio and reaction temperature employed during pretreatment caused the main differences quantified by higher COD release into the soluble phase. 3.2.3 Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay results BMP tests were performed for 82 days on the solid fraction of AHP pretreated switchgrass. The amount of methane produced by the anaerobic seed sludge was subtracted from all BMP tests for normalization. The specific methane yields were calculated in mL CH4/g VS and presented in Fig. 5 . A specific yield of 208.4 mL CH4/g VS was measured for untreated switchgrass, representing 47.4 % of the theoretical methane yield. The highest specific methane production was achieved at 50 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 3 wt% solids, and 6 h reaction time condition as 326 mL CH4/g VS, with a 56.4 % increase compared to untreated switchgrass. Also, the highest yield reached 74.2 % of the theoretical methane yield. Overall, the methane yield was decreased by the increasing AHP pretreatment severity. Particularly, pretreatment conditions with 100 °C reaction temperature had lower methane yields. The most effective pretreatment conditions on methane production were 50 °C and 3 wt% H2O2, with one exception. Only a 14 % increase in methane yield was observed for the sample pretreated at 50 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 3 wt% solids, and 24 h conditions. Similar methane yields were reported in the literature for different pretreatment methods applied switchgrass. Jackowiak et al. and Khalid et al. observed 320 and 288.4 mL CH4/g VS methane yields from microwave and KOH pretreated switchgrass, respectively (Jackowiak et al., 2011; Khalid et al., 2019). 3.2.4 Effect of AHP pretreatment on surface structure and molecular bond characteristics of switchgrass Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was performed to determine the physical effect of AHP pretreatment on the surface structure of switchgrass. According to images presented in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), it can be seen that untreated switchgrass has either fibrous or smooth surface structure, which makes it resistant to biochemical attacks by blocking the penetration of extracellular enzymes. These images also indicate the necessity of pretreatment to allow microorganisms and enzymes to reach more surface area of the substrate in order to hydrolyze it. The SEM image of switchgrass pretreated at 100 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 7 wt% solids, and 24 h reaction time AHP condition is given in Fig. 6(c). At this severe AHP pretreatment condition, switchgrass was disintegrated into smaller particles and fibers. It can also be seen that the surface structure of switchgrass was highly disrupted. When SEM images are evaluated along with BMP results, AHP pretreatment conditions of 100 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 7 wt% solids, and 24 h reaction time were found to be too severe since they caused loss of substrate. Therefore, only a 3.74 % BMP increase was observed in this condition. In Fig. 6(d), on the other hand, SEM image of pretreated sample at 50 °C, 3 wt% H2O2, 7 wt% solids, and 6 h reaction time was given, which was found to have the highest methane potential. In this condition, switchgrass structure was found to be still intact; however, the surface was uneven and scaly. An increase in the surface area led to higher digestibility and methane potential. Overall, SEM images and BMP results showed that severe AHP pretreatment conditions are disintegrating switchgrass into smaller pieces, which causes loss of cellulose and hemicellulose. Similar SEM images and results were reported for AHP pretreatment of corncob and sugarcane bagasse by Su et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2019), respectively. Lyophilized untreated and pretreated switchgrass samples were used in FTIR analysis to determine the effect of AHP pretreatment on the chemical bond structure. Similar to SEM analysis, pretreated samples were selected from the most severe conditions and the conditions with the highest specific methane yields. The obtained FTIR spectra are presented in Fig. 7 . According to the spectra, there were significant absorbance variations among three samples at 850, 895, 1050, 1230, 1330, 1397–1530, 1465, 1621, and 1720-1740 cm−1 wavelengths in the fingerprint region. The absorbance at 850 cm−1 was caused by the bending in –CH bonds. At 895 cm−1 wavelength, absorbances indicate different cellulose amounts in samples (Sahoo et al., 2012). Distinct spectra at 1050, 1230, 1330, 1465, 1621 cm−1 were caused by the stretching of C-O bonds, asymmetric deformations of C-H bonds and methoxyphenolic substitutions, and they were all related with lignin (Galletti et al., 2015; Lupoi et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2015a). Also, the zone between 1397 and 1530 cm−1 shows the bending vibrations of CH2 groups of cellulose (Galletti et al., 2015). Changes in the zone between 1720 and 1740 cm−1 were related with CO stretching in the aldehyde groups of carbohydrates (Sigma IR spectrum table, 2021). Out of fingerprint region, at 2900 and 3400 cm−1 wavelengths, significant changes were observed that indicate changes in C-H and O-H bonds (Pandey, 1999)."
12,Response surface method for the optimization of AHP pretreatment,"3.3 Response surface method for the optimization of AHP pretreatment Responses of 52 AHP pretreatment runs, including duplicates of 24 different conditions and quadruplicate of the center point, were entered into Design Expert software. Models for response parameters, sRS, sCOD, and specific methane yields, were created using the RSM. The highest determination of coefficient (R 2 ), adjusted-R 2 , and predicted-R 2 were aimed for selecting models. After obtaining the BMP model equation, methane production and cost optimization for the AHP pretreatment were performed. 3.3.1 sRS and sCOD models sRS and sCOD models were created without the application of any data transformation. For both responses, reduced cubic models were used. The models used initial solid content (A), reaction temperature (B), H2O2 concentration (C), reaction time (D), their interaction effects (e.g., AB, ABC), and their second-degree effects (e.g., A 2 , AB 2 ) as terms. Due to the utilization of an experimental design with 4 × 3 independent variables to data points, third-degree terms (e.g., A 3 , B 3 ) of the cubic model were excluded. Model statistics and equations for the sRS and sCOD models are given in Table 4 and Table 5 , respectively. Both models were significant due to their p-values (<0.0001). The sCOD model was built with a 0.9877 coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and a 0.9153 predicted– R 2 . These fit statistics indicate that the sCOD model has a 98.77 % prediction power, and the model was able to predict 91.53 % of the data points which were entered to build the model. Due to the normal distribution of sCOD results, a model with high prediction power was able to be built. According to model statistics, among first-degree terms, only the effect of H2O2 concentration was found statistically significant on the sCOD response. The first-degree effect of the solid content was found as the most insignificant between independent variables due to the insoluble structure of switchgrass. However, whereas solid content does not change soluble sCOD directly, its two–way interaction with reaction temperature (AB) and three–way interaction with reaction temperature and H2O2 concentration (ABC) were found as the most significant terms on the model. Overall, H2O2 concentration was found to be the most effective independent parameter on soluble sCOD response due to the p-values of its first-degree (C), second-degree (C 2 ) terms, and interactions (AC, BC, AC 2 , BC 2 ). For soluble reducing sugars, a model with R 2 of 0.9296 and predicted– R 2 of 0.8499 was built. Compared with the sCOD model, the prediction power of the sRS model was lower due to the low variation among the response data. However, it was possible to obtain a model that can predict 84.99 % of the soluble reducing sugar data points. In order to build the sRS model, all terms of the reaction time independent variable (D) were excluded due to their statistical insignificancy on sRS response. Therefore, the sRS model was built by using only three independent variables. The first-degree effects of these independent variables were all found significant. H2O2 concentration was the most effective independent parameter, as it was included in the five out of eight terms which were used to build the model. 3.3.2 BMP model BMP results of pretreated switchgrass solid fractions were modeled to optimize the AHP pretreatment process. Model statistics and the equation of the BMP response are presented in Table 6 . Similar to the sCOD and sRS models, a reduced cubic model was used. A BMP model with R 2 of 0.9987, adjusted– R 2 of 0.9922, and predicted– R 2 of 0.8347 was built. Although fit statistics indicate a model with very high prediction power, the model could only predict 83.47 % of the actual data due to the nature of biochemical experiments that can show high variation. Similar fit statistics for methane prediction models were reported for various substrates and pretreatment methods (Deepanraj et al., 2020; Mkruqulwa et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2016; Wadjeam and Reungsang, 2018). The BMP model was built by using all possible first-degree, second-degree, and two-way interaction terms. Also, 4 three-way interaction terms and 2 s-degree two-way interaction terms were used. For 95 % confidence interval, first-degree and second-degree effects of all independent variables were found significant on the BMP response. Solid content (A), reaction temperature (B), and reaction time (D) were found to be the most effective independent variables by each being a part of eight significant terms, whereas H2O2 concentration (C) was a part of seven significant terms in the model. Two of the two-way interaction terms were insignificant for the model. However, to obtain a hierarchical model, these insignificant terms were not excluded. Response surface graphs of the four significant two-way interaction terms are presented in Fig. 8 . According to all four response surface graphs given in Fig. 8, the BMP model successfully predicted actual data points, which were shown as red dots on graphs. In the interaction of solid content – reaction temperature given in Fig. 8 (a), the highest methane yield was predicted to be at 50 °C and 4–6% solid content conditions. In Fig. 8 (b), on the other hand, the most effective reaction time and solid content for maximizing specific methane production was found as 18 h and 4.5 wt% solids. Like in Fig. 8 (a), Fig. 8 (c) also revealed that, within this experimental design, 50 °C is the optimum temperature for reaching the highest specific methane yield. Increasing H2O2 concentration was found to positively affect the specific BMP at 50 °C. However, this effect disappears with the increasing temperature. A similar effect of H2O2 concentration can also be seen in the response surface graph of H2O2 concentration and reaction time given in Fig. 8 (d). Therefore, 3 wt% H2O2 concentration seems to be the most effective H2O2 concentration for reaching the highest methane production in this experimental design. It can also be seen that the optimum reaction time is around 18 h. The most effective interaction for the maximum BMP response was found between H2O2 concentration and reaction temperature. The model predicted a specific yield of 340 mL CH4/g VS for pretreatment utilizing 3 wt% H2O2 concentration and 50 °C reaction temperature. 3.3.3 Optimization Optimization was performed for two different targets as maximizing specific methane production and minimizing cost. The sCOD and sRS responses were ignored in the optimization step to focus on the correlation of independent variables on BMP response. Commands and importance levels entered into the software for the two optimization approaches were presented in Table 7 . In the first optimization target, the only aim was to achieve the highest methane yield possible. Therefore, no specific commands were given for the independent variables, whereas a maximize command with the highest importance level was used for the BMP response. In the second optimization target, importance level three commands were used for the independent variables to decrease the pretreatment process cost as much as possible while achieving the highest methane production. In order to do that, maximize command was used for solid content, and minimize command was used for other independent variables. To calculate the level of enhancement on BMP response by the application of AHP pretreatment, the BMP values predicted for optimum conditions were compared with the BMP of untreated switchgrass. The optimum conditions with the highest desirability and BMP were selected among the suggested solutions. Desirability values for maximum methane production and cost minimization solutions were 1.000 and 0.800, respectively. Suggested optimum conditions were close to the ones which can be seen from the response surface graphs, such as 50 °C reaction temperature, 3 % H2O2 concentration, 18 h reaction time, and 6 % solids. For the maximum methane production goal, the optimum AHP pretreatment condition was 6.649 % solid content, 50.604 °C reaction time, 2.936 % H2O2 concentration, and 16.05 h reaction time. In this AHP pretreatment condition, the models predicted concentrations of 785.13 mg sCOD/g VS and 6.588 mg sRS/g VS in the aqueous phase of pretreated switchgrass. The highest specific methane production that can be achieved within this experimental design was predicted as 338.524 mL CH4/g VS. When the optimum BMP value is compared with the BMP of untreated switchgrass, it can be seen that AHP pretreatment was able to enhance methane production by 62.44 %. For the AHP cost minimization, the H2O2 concentration and reaction time needed to be lower compared to those parameters of the maximum methane production goal. For this optimization, with 6.433 % switchgrass solid content, 50 °C reaction time, 1.834 % H2O2 concentration, and 6.784 h reaction time, the BMP model predicted a specific yield of 291.344 mL CH4/g VS. At this lower cost AHP pretreatment, a 39.8 % methane yield enhancement, compared to untreated switchgrass, was reached. Furthermore, the sCOD and sRS concentrations in the aqueous phase were predicted as 571.37 mg sCOD/g VS and 4.006 mg sRS/g VS. When the results for the two targets are compared, it can be seen that the maximum methane production condition has a 16.19 % higher BMP value. A similar AHP optimization study was performed by Yılmaz et al. (Yilmaz et al., 2019) on banana harvesting residues by using three independent variables of reaction time, reaction temperature, and H2O2 concentration. They reported an optimum AHP pretreatment condition of 50 °C, 2.73 % H2O2 concentration, and 6 h reaction time, which was similar to the findings of this research. At this AHP pretreatment condition, they observed a 40 % methane production enhancement. Sun et al. (2015b) applied AHP pretreatment to five different crop stalks and reported a range of 238–335 mL CH4/g VS methane production. Also, Katukuri et al. (2017) stated that by the application of AHP pretreatment to Miscanthus floridulus, they were able to reach a 278.7 mL CH4/g VS methane production. When compared with the other findings in the literature, the modeling and BMP results of this study were found to be in agreement."
13,Process yield and applicability,"3.4 Process yield and applicability To determine the level of enhancement achieved by the application of AHP pretreatment, predicted methane production and the energy equivalent of methane were compared with the calculated theoretical methane potential by Buswell equation and HHV by Dulong equation, respectively. According to Buswell equation, the theoretical methane yield of switchgrass was 416.8 L/kg dry switchgrass. At the optimum methane production condition, 77 % of the theoretical methane potential was reached. For cost minimization, on the other hand, the predicted methane production represents 66 % of the theoretical methane potential. The comparison of theoretical methane potential and HHV to optimum conditions is presented in Fig. 9 . After volume corrections, the predicted methane potentials were converted into energy potentials by multiplying the results with the HHV of methane, which is 39.8 MJ/m3 (Ongen, 2016) under standard temperature and pressure conditions (273 K, 1 atm). The results were then compared with the HHV of switchgrass, 15.54 MJ/kg, in order to determine the energy recovery in the form of methane. According to this comparison, it was found that an energy recovery of 82.22 % can be reached when operating at the pretreatment condition linked to the maximum methane production, whereas this value is 70.76 % for the cost minimization pretreatment condition. Overall, the results of our study showed that the AHP pretreatment of switchgrass led to efficient methane production in terms of both methane yield and energy recovery. Net energy recovery calculations for the anaerobic digestion of raw switchgrass, pretreated switchgrass in the optimum methane production condition, and pretreated switchgrass in optimum cost condition were performed and presented in Fig. 10 . Calculations were based on 1 kg dry switchgrass. In calculations, the energy consumption for heating was determined by using the specific heat formula. The energy needed for the production of chemicals were assumed 3.44 MJ/kg H2O2 (Shiraishi et al., 2020) and 11.78 MJ/kg NaOH (U.S. Department of Energy, 2015). Switchgrass cultivation energy consumption was calculated in a previous study (Başar and Perendeci, 2021). According to the findings, pretreatment was found as the highest energy-consuming step due to the heating and H2O2 production. This consumption can be much higher if H2O2 is produced in the anthraquinone process (Hargreaves et al., 2020). Therefore, it can be said that the success of AHP pretreatment in biorefinery applications depends on the energy efficiency of H2O2 production process. Also, in order to achieve a sustainable biofuel production, H2O2 needs to be produced in an environmentally friendly process, such as photocatalytic generation. According to the calculations, both optimum conditions were found to have higher net energy recoveries than anaerobic digestion of raw switchgrass. Net energy recovery increases by the application of AHP pretreatment were 23.64 % and 6.73 % for optimum methane production condition and optimum cost condition, respectively. According to these results, optimum methane production condition was found as the most suitable AHP pretreatment condition for full-scale biorefinery applications. In a full-scale application, the digestate remaining after the anaerobic digestion process can be used as fertilizer back in the switchgrass cultivation to achieve a circular biorefinery application in terms of nutrients. On the other hand, produced methane can partially be burned on the field in cogeneration plants to produce the heat required for pretreatment and electricity needed in biorefinery. The remaining methane can be purified and fed to natural gas distribution systems. The most significant advantage of switchgrass-based methane production is that it’s a carbon-negative process owing to switchgrass's high carbon sequestration capacity. Switchgrass rhizomes are reported to reach up to 3.3 m depth (Ma et al., 2000), making it a perfect candidate for fixing carbon to the soil and fighting soil erosion. Numerous agricultural benefits and the biofuel potential of switchgrass, as can be seen in this study's results, make it a suitable feedstock for biorefinery applications. Also, it was found that AHP pretreatment would successfully enhance the energy recovery from switchgrass in a full-scale biorefinery scenario."
14,Conclusion,"The optimization of the AHP pretreatment method on the lignocellulosic energy crop, switchgrass, was investigated in this study. Soluble organic compounds released after the AHP pretreatment, quantified by sCOD in the liquid phase of pretreated switchgrass, were found to be between 309.3 and 1463.5 mg sCOD/g VS. On the other hand, sRS concentrations were all under 15 mg sRS/g VS except for two conditions. Since only delignification of switchgrass was aimed during pretreatment, low sRS results were expected. No inhibition was observed in BMP tests due to mild pretreatment conditions. It was possible to build models with high prediction powers for all three responses. The BMP model predicted specific methane yields of 338.52 and 291.34 mL CH4/g VS for maximized methane yield and minimized cost pretreatment scenarios, with 62.4 % and 39.8 % increases compared to untreated switchgrass, respectively. It was also found that for the optimum methane production condition, the predicted methane production represents 77 % of the theoretical methane yield and 82.22 % energy recovery. In a full-scale biorefinery application scenario, optimum methane production condition was found to be the most suitable AHP pretreatment condition with a 9.2 MJ/kg dry switchgrass net energy recovery. Overall, both methane production from switchgrass and AHP pretreatment processes were found suitable for biorefinery applications."
