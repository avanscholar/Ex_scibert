0,Introduction,"Intelligent packaging and films for agricultural commodities can sense the environment inside or outside the containers and report to humans in order to facilitate the decisions to extend the product's shelf life, enhance safety, improve quality, provide information, and warn about possible problems [1]. Polysaccharides are the polymers most frequently used to develop biodegradable films. These can be obtained from animals (e.g., chitosan), plants (e.g., cellulose, inulin, and starch), microbes (e.g., dextran and xanthan), and algae (e.g., alginate) as reported by Rostami et al. [2]. Among these, chitosan is noteworthy as one of the most abundant renewable natural materials, with film-forming properties. Chitosan is recognised as safe and non-toxic, haemostatic, anticancerogen, bacteriostatic, and fungistatic [3]. Additionally, chitosan (Ch) is bioadhesive, polycationic, and biocompatible with various polymeric materials and bioactive compounds such as essential oils, antioxidants, plant extracts, and metals [4]. For example, ZnO's eco-friendly particles incorporated into aminated chitosan Schiff's base were synthesised and utilised as an adsorbent material to remove Pb(II) ions [5]. Also, Yuvaraja et al. [6] reported the development of magnetic-Momordica charantia leaf powder impregnated into a chitosan matrix for removing uranium contamination, confirming its use as an adsorbent material. Additionally, chitosan films can be used as a matrix for particles of micrometric or nanometric size. Unlike ceramic or metal NPs, nanoparticles of chitosan can be fabricated in a wide range of sizes. These have a large surface area-to-volume ratio to interact with a more significant number of molecules than other NPs [7]. The synthesis of nanoparticles using other plant extracts, bacteria, fungi is of great interest because they are eco-friendly materials and their unusual optical and chemical properties. The synthesis of nanoparticles with plant extracts are interesting because their shape and size change in terms of the pH of reaction conditions [8]. On this, Elia et al. [9] prepared gold nanoparticles added with Salvia officinalis, Lippia citriodora, Pelargonium graveolens, and Punica granatum extracts as reducing and stabilising agents. In addition, chitosan can be blended with other polymers as well as with synthetic and natural dyes to modify its optical, mechanical and thermal properties. On this subject, Bonilla et al. [10] found that Ch/PVA films showed a homogeneous structure and higher rigidity and strength than each component separately because of both materials' high compatibility. Nevertheless, this blend had low UV light transmission properties due to hydrogen bonds forming between the polymers. Another polymer widely used with chitosan is polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) which is more resistant to UV irradiation than the blend mentioned above. If the PVP is added in the chitosan films restrains photochemical transformation when they are irradiated with UV. According to El Sayed and Mohamad [11], the incorporation of PVP into chitosan films increases its hydrophobicity, showing transmittance values for up to 80% (ranging from 400 to 800 nm). Similarly, Prathab and Aminabhavi [12] observed that increasing the chitosan content in the Ch/PVP blend led to decreased surface energy (van der Waals, principally). When pigments are added to chitosan films, the films rapidly exhibit a colour change. They show a reversible respond to various physical and chemical conditions and stimuli such as water, pH, heat, UV light, daylight, electrostatic fields, magnetic fields, and changes in physicochemical and microbiological properties [13]. These features have allowed the development of intelligent films and packaging with functional properties; for instance, they have been used as colourimetric indicators [14]. Colourimetric indicators have received extensive attention because they can exhibit straightforward information by visible colour changes, as reported by Zhai et al. [15]. They manufactured colourimetric films based on a matrix of starch/PVA, together with anthocyanins for real-time monitoring of silver carp fish freshness stored at 4 °C in response to pH changes. Maciel et al. [16] developed an intelligent and biodegradable temperature indicator based on a blending of chitosan with natural and heat-sensitive pigment. The intelligent packaging changed colour irreversibly from light violet to light yellow in response to different temperature exposition (40 °C to 70 °C). Kuswandi et al. [17] elaborated a methyl red (MR)/cellulose membrane, which was stuck to the packaging for determining the freshness of strawberries. The MR/cellulose membrane was a highly sensitive material with regard to pH in the range from 4.2 to 6.2, incorporating a colour change (from yellow to red-purple) as a result of interactions with the volatile acids inside the atmospheric package. As outlined previously, the quality and freshness of horticultural products have been monitored using intelligent films. However, studies into monitoring fungal growth on strawberry using films based on chitosan/PVA/PVP are scarce, even though this fruit is marketed worldwide and shows economic losses of up to 50% of its production due to fungal growth, mostly Rhizopus stolonifer [18]. This fungus causes the disease in strawberry referred to as soft rot. It is characterised by pectin degradation in the middle lamina of the plant cells, generating hydrophilic areas with an unpleasant odour and, in some cases, fermentation. During the infection process, the strawberries and the fungus release volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These compounds are the result of the degradation processes that occur within the cell [19]. In this work, we issue the hypothesis that the films based on chitosan/PVA/PVP and chitosan NPs with plant extracts will form a homogeneous structure able to modify their absorbance and transmittance during R. stolonifer growth on strawberry; therefore, the fast detection of this phytopathogenic fungus will be possible. The novelty of this research lies with the development of other alternatives based on biodegradable materials able to detect one of the most devastating fungi that affect the strawberry fruit during storage. Additionally, the films based on Ch/PVA/PVP and nanoparticles from plant extracts might be used, among other applications, for active and intelligent packaging and sensors to preserve agricultural products. Based on the evidence mentioned above, the work described in this paper aimed to characterise morphologically and physically, chitosan/PVA and chitosan/PVP films enriched with NPs of chitosan-plant extracts such as radish, apple, mushroom, Roselle calyces, and gallic acid to quantify the content of phenols, and evaluate their changes in terms of optical absorbance and transmittance to monitor the presence of R. stolonifer during storage of strawberry."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Reagents and raw materials,"2.1 Reagents and raw materials Commercial chitosan was bought to America Alimentos, Mexico. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, MW: 13000–23,000, degree of hydrolysing>87%) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW: 10000) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Glacial acetic acid was obtained from Fermont, Mexico. Gallic acid was purchased at Mallinckrodt, USA, and Meyer, Mexico, provided citric acid. Ethanol was acquired from Hycel, Mexico. Plants such as radish, apple, mushroom and Roselle calyces used to get extracts and strawberries were commercially purchased in Yautepec, in Morelos Mexico (18°52′54.7″ North and 99°4′1.7″ West)."
3,Chemical characterisation of chitosan,"2.2 Chemical characterisation of chitosan The intrinsic viscosity, viscometric molecular weight, and degree of deacetylation (DDA) were determined in the Laboratory of Biopolymers of the Center for Research in Food and Development AC, Mexico. The intrinsic viscosity (η) was measured at 25 °C with an Ubbelohde viscometer. The technique consisted of dissolving chitosan (0.3 and 0.6%) with a blend of two electrolyte solutions (0.3 M acetic acid and 0.2 M sodium acetate). After the solution was poured into the viscometer (ϕ = 0.58 mm) during a given time, the viscosity was determined. The flow time is related to the viscosity of the chitosan solution by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. The viscometric molecular weight (Mv) was determined using the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation: [η] = K·(Mv)α; where K = 0.076 and α = 0.76 [20]. The DDA was determined using the technique of attenuated total reflectance of the sample [21]."
4,Obtaining plant extracts and gallic acid solution,"2.3 Obtaining plant extracts and gallic acid solution For plant extracts, 6 g of radish, apple or mushroom with 25 mL of phosphate buffer at pH 7 (JT Baker, Mexico) were macerated and blended. The blend was centrifuged at 3448×g for 10 min using a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf, USA), and the supernatant was recovered. Additionally, 1% of citric acid was aggregated at radish extract in order to avoid the oxidation process prior to using it. For preparing the aqueous extract of Roselle calyces, 15 g of the plant species were added to 100 mL of distilled water and maintained for 24 h in darkness. Subsequently, the aqueous fraction was recovered by filtration and was used as a plant extract. Finally, two gallic acid solutions were prepared: 1) gallic acid at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 and 2) gallic acid at 1 mg mL−1 blended with 1% citric acid."
5,Synthesis of NPs,"2.4 Synthesis of NPs The NPs were prepared at 25 °C by the precipitation process described by González-Saucedo et al. [22]. The first step of the synthesis consisted of blending plant extracts with 275 mL of ethanol. Two different quantities of extracts were used as follows: group 1) for radish, apple and mushroom extracts, 25 mL, and group 2) for Roselle calyces extracts, gallic acid solution, and gallic acid solution blended with 1% of citric acid, 15 mL of each one extracts. The second step consisted of adding dropwise with a peristaltic pump (MasterFlex C/L, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) 18.75 mL of a 0.05% chitosan solution prepared by dissolving in 1% acetic acid at pH 5.6, at a rate of 0.10 mL min−1 and kept under constant stirring at 500 rpm for 1 h using a magnetic stirring bar."
6,Elaboration of films enriched with NPs,"2.5 Elaboration of films enriched with NPs Chitosan at 2% dissolved in 0.05% acetic acid and adjusted to pH 5.2 was used. The solution was blended with: a) 0.03% PVA or b) 1% PVP and was made into a homogenous solution at 500 rpm using a magnetic stirring bar [23]. Prior to that, 0.03 g PVA was dissolved in 5 mL water by mechanical stirring at 80 °C. Then, 50 mL of Ch/PVA or Ch/PVP blend was combined with the NPs of each plant extract at 10% or 30%, as shown in Table 1 . After stirring for 30 min at 500 rpm, the blend was placed on Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter) and dried using an oven (Merck, Germany) at 40 °C for 15 h. Concentrations from 10 and 30% of plant extracts were evaluated based on Mohamad et al. [24] methodology. They reported a minimum of 10% concentration of plant extract to synthesise mostly spherical nanoparticles."
7,Experimental conditions,"2.6 Experimental conditions 2.6.1 Fungal isolate The strain of R. stolonifer was obtained from the Laboratory of Postharvest Technology of Horticultural Products at CEPROBI-IPN. The fungus was maintained in the PDA medium for four days until it achieved its maximum growth. 20 mL of sterile distilled water was then added to the Petri dishes, and the mycelium was scraped off with a sterile needle. The mycelium was laid in an Erlenmeyer flask. This suspension was filtered using sterile cheesecloth. Spore quantification was carried out in a Neubauer chamber and adjusted to 105 spores mL−1. 2.6.2 Treatments Strawberries cv. ‘Camino Real’ showed a red colour in 25% of its epidermis. Fruit from 2.6 to 3.1 cm diameter was selected based on the specifications of NMX-FF-062-SCFI-2002 [25]. Subsequently, they were disinfected using a sodium hypochlorite solution at 400 ppm for 3 min, and the water excess was drained until the fruit was dried. Two groups with 15 experimental units were involved. Group 1: strawberries without inoculation (control group). Group 2: strawberries inoculated with a spores suspension of R. stolonifer (105 spores mL−1). Each experimental unit was made up of four strawberries (total weight 100-130 g), and three replications for each treatment were evaluated. Fruits were deposited into clamshell packaging (15 × 14 × 9 cm3). The packaging contained nine perforations of 2 mm diameter on top. In addition, 30 strips of the chitosan films (5 cm long and 0.8 cm wide) adhered to the packaging's inner top. Twenty-four different chitosan films were evaluated. The packaging was then tightly closed and stored at the optimum temperature for R. stolonifer growth of 25 °C. After 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h, the chitosan strips were removed, and their optical absorbance and transmittance were evaluated."
8,Films thickness evaluation,"2.7 Films thickness evaluation The thickness of the films was quantified using a micrometre with an accuracy of 0.001 mm (Fowler, USA). Values were calculated as the average of at least four randomly measurements for each film."
9,Changes in optical absorbance and transmittance of chitosan films exposed inside the packaging with inoculated strawberries,"2.8 Changes in optical absorbance and transmittance of chitosan films exposed inside the packaging with inoculated strawberries Two trials were carried out. In the first one, the films were prepared with two different blends of polymers (Ch/PVA and Ch/PVP). Subsequently, chitosan NPs blended with radish, apple, mushroom, or Roselle calyces' extracts were integrated into these films. Likewise, some samples were prepared with gallic acid or gallic acid with citric acid, at concentrations of 10% and 30%, as outlined in Table 1. The optical absorbance and transmittance of these films were then measured using a spectrophotometer. In the second trial, only two groups of films were measured in terms of optical absorbance and transmittance: a) Ch/PVA films, which worked as a matrix, were enriched with NPs of chitosan blended with 30% of the mushroom extract and b) Ch/PVP films enriched with NPs of chitosan blended with 10% of radish extract. These films were placed on the inner top of the packaging for exposure to the inoculated and non-inoculated strawberries. They were then removed from the packaging after 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h and were evaluated. The absorbance and transmittance of these films in the range of 200 to 800 nm were measured using a Genesys 10s UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo, USA). Results were reported on Ch/PVA/PVP films of 0.15 mm of thickness."
10,Mechanical properties in chitosan films,"2.9 Mechanical properties in chitosan films The tensile strength test and elongation to break were measured using a Universal Testing Machine, model 3345 (Instron, USA), equipped with a load cell of 45 N, according to the standard method ASTM D-882-91 [26]."
11,Phenols content in chitosan films,"2.10 Phenols content in chitosan films The total phenols were evaluated by Singleton et al. [27] methodology. First, a blending of 0.05 g of the chitosan films with 20 mL of phosphate buffer at pH 7 was kept for 1 h without stirring and in darkness. After this, the blend was macerated, and the obtained extract was used as a source of phenols. Finally, 500 μL of phenols, 500 μL of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, and 750 μL of 20% NaCO3 were blended and made up at 5 mL distilled water. This blend was incubated for 2 h in darkness at room temperature and later analysed using a spectrophotometer at 760 nm. Results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents using a standard curve for gallic acid at concentrations from 150 μL to 750 μL."
12,TEM characterisation of chitosan NPs with radish extract,"2.11 TEM characterisation of chitosan NPs with radish extract Only the morphology of the chitosan NPs with radish extract was characterised due to films that contained them modified their optical absorbance and transmittance when they were placed inside the packaging with inoculated and non-inoculated strawberry. The analysis consisted of placing a drop of NPs dispersed in ethanol (1:12) on a copper grid. The observation was carried out in a JEM 2010 Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL, USA), using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV."
13,Encapsulation efficiency and yield of chitosan NPs with radish extract,"2.12 Encapsulation efficiency and yield of chitosan NPs with radish extract The amount of radish extract entrapped in the NPs previously described was determined spectrophotometrically and reported by Khaira et al. [28] and Carmona et al. [29]. It consisted of evaporation of the solvent using a rotary evaporator. The suspension obtained was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 20 min. The free radish extract in the supernatant was measure at 320 nm, where the absorbance peak maximum was quantified in the sample. The encapsulation efficiency of NPs was determined as the difference between the radish extract used for the formulation and its amount in the supernatant. The result was expressed as a percentage by the following equation: % EE = Total amount of radish extract added − Amount of radish extract in the supernatant Total amount of radish extract added × 100 For yield quantification, the NPs obtained after the solvent evaporation and centrifugation, as above mentioned, were collected and weighed accurately [29]. The percentage yield was calculated using the equation follows: % Yield = Weight of NPs obtained Total weight of radish extract and chitosan × 100"
14,SEM characterisation of Ch/PVP films enriched with chitosan NPs blended with 10% radish extract,"2.13 SEM characterisation of Ch/PVP films enriched with chitosan NPs blended with 10% radish extract The microstructural analysis of the cross-section and the films' surface were carried out using a Quanta FEG 250 Scanning Electron Microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Only Ch-PVP films with NPs of chitosan/radish extract were analysed because a change was observed in the optical absorbance property after exposing them inside the packaging with inoculated strawberries."
15,Visual assessment of disease,"2.14 Visual assessment of disease Soft rot disease on stored strawberries with Ch/PVP films enriched with NPs of chitosan/10% radish extract was evaluated when visible symptoms appeared. It was reported as the percentage of diseased area in the fruit and was ranked from 1 to 5; where 1 = 0%, 2 = 1–25%, 3 = 26–50%, 4 = 51–75%, and 5 = 76–100% of the surface fruit exhibiting symptoms of the disease [30,31]."
16,Statistical analysis,"2.15 Statistical analysis Optical absorbance and transmittance assays of the films were carried out with five replications. The thickness measurement of films, mechanical properties and the visual assessment of disease on strawberry were carried out with three replications. All data were analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factorial arrangement. Differences between means were assessed by Tukey's test (p ≤ 0.05) using Infostat Software 2017 version, Argentina."
17,Results and discussion,
18,"Intrinsic viscosity, viscometric molecular weight and degree of deacetylation of chitosan","3.1 Intrinsic viscosity, viscometric molecular weight and degree of deacetylation of chitosan Table 2 shows the intrinsic viscosity of the sample evaluated, which was similar to that reported by Facchinatto et al. [32]. They evaluated commercial chitosan purchased from Cheng Yue Planting Co Ltd., China and obtained an intrinsic viscosity of 449.0 mL g−1. The determination of this property is correlated with biomolecule weight and concentration. The intrinsic viscosity is based on the measurement of the hydrodynamic volume occupied by the biomolecules in a solution, as reported by Gartner and López [33]. Considering the evaluated sample's molecular weight (89,305.67 g mol−1), the chitosan value corresponded with the low molecular weight and coinciding with the values reported by Sigma-Aldrich (50,000–190,000 g mol−1). This type of chitosan shows the lowest tensile strength and elongation and produces less entanglement during the film formation than the high molecular weight chitosan [34]. Finally, the DDA value determines whether the polymer is chitin or chitosan [35]. According to Harish et al. [36], the DDA chitosan values should range from 60 to 98%, and if it corresponds with a high DDA, the values should range from 85 to 95%, as it happened in our chitosan; which was used in the present study due to its considerably lower cost than that of the chitosan of highest DDA. Additionally, the high DDA chitosan is characterised for having good solubility in water [37] and it increases the number of positive charges resulting in poorly rigid films and favours the interactions with other compounds."
19,Thickness of films,"3.2 Thickness of films Based on the statistical analysis, three groups in terms of film thickness were observed. The first, corresponding to the Ch/PVA films enriched with blends of chitosan NPs with radish extracts (10% and 30%), apple extract (10%), and mushroom extract (10%), showed the lowest thickness at approximately 0.10 mm. The second coincided with the Ch/PVP films group enriched with blends of chitosan NPs with 10% extract of Roselle calyces. These had the most significant values (p ≤ 0.05) corresponding to 0.20–0.25 mm, while the third group had values ranging from 0.13 to 0.19 mm, which correlated with the remaining treatments (Fig. 1 ). The films thickness plays a key role in the morphology of its surface. Walheim et al. [38] and Rodríguez-Hernández [39] informed that the sufficiently thin films could suppress the polymer-air interface deformation, but in other cases, the type of structure remains constant independent of the film thickness. It was noteworthy that the plant extracts and polymers such as PVA and PVP modified the chitosan film thickness. Furthermore, the compatibility showed by different added extracts and Ch/PVA solutions resulted in very stable matrices since the thicknesses were not significantly different (p ≤ 0.05). According to AgilAbraham et al. [40], chitosan is a rigid and hygroscopic polymer due to hydrogen bonding and reactive hydroxyl groups in its structure. If chitosan (ranging from 2% to 7%) is blended with up to 10% of PVA, the thermally-stable samples can be processed up to 200 °C without adding a crosslinking agent. The authors also showed that Ch/PVA films' thickness increased from 0.016 mm to 0.029 mm by adding chitosan at 2%. It might be because chitosan holds water molecules which avoided the possibility of polymer chain formation and produced a thick film, as reported by Nugraheni et al. [41]."
20,Absorbance and transmittance of films,"3.3 Absorbance and transmittance of films Absorbance and transmittance are two optical properties of the materials. The absorbance of a medium increases proportionally with the attenuation of a beam. On the other hand, the transmittance is the fraction of the incident radiation transmitted by the medium. Consequently, these are different optical properties; therefore, the films with the highest absorbance showed the lowest optical transmittance. In this trial, all samples showed a maximum absorbance peak and a minimum transmittance peak at around a wavelength of 300–320 nm (Fig. 2 ). In this regard, Aleixandre-Tudo & du Toit [42] reported that some chemical compounds could be quantified using UV and visible light because of their biochemical and molecular properties. They noted that phenols are highly suitable for quantification with UV–visible light since their ring can absorb UV light. In addition, simple phenols such as galloylated flavanol show a shoulder at 310 nm, evidencing their presence in the films evaluated. Some differences in the absorbance and transmittance properties of the films with regard to the type of polymer used were observed. For instance, Ch/PVA films with radish extract at 10% and 30% showed up to four-fold higher optical absorbance than Ch/PVP films in the range of 300 to 320 nm. Additionally, in the Ch/PVA films, the absorbance was modified by the effect of the plant extract used, while in the Ch/PVP films, there were no differences in the samples' absorbance regardless of the plant extract they contained (Fig. 2A–D). In the same wavelength, an optical transmittance, very close to 0%, was measured in Ch/PVA regardless of the added plant extract concentration, except for the mushroom extract at 10% and 30% that showed the maximum optical transmittance (c.a. 20%); however, in Ch/PVP films slightly differences among samples were observed (Fig. 2E–H). In Ch/PVP films, the increase in their optical transmittance was less evident since at least 10% transmittance was observed in most of the evaluated formulations (Fig. 2G). According to these results, two specific behaviours were described, the first of which is related to the type and concentration of the composites added to the films since they modified their optical transmittance. On this subject, Kumar et al. [43] reported an optical transmittance of 90% at 550 nm for Ch/PVP films with ZnO composites. These results showed that biodegradable films could modify their optical properties more easily than films made using non-biodegradable materials. Hence, these could be potential materials for manufacturing flexible displays and wearable electronics. Secondly, the degree of compatibility between the polymers and the plant composites affects the films' optical properties. In this regard, Jen-Taut et al. [44] and Bonilla et al. [10] also reported that Ch/PVA and Ch/PVP are stabilised through hydrogen bonding, and when these polymers interact with other composites, their optical transmittance decreases. Functional groups responsible for the absorption spectrum of chitosan/PVA films are carbonyl groups and unsaturated ethylene groups, which present a maximum peak from 200 to 220 nm, as reported by Abdolrahimi et al. [45]. On the other hand, functional groups NH, CO and CH2 are characteristics of chitosan/PVP films; showed a maximum absorption peak at approximately 550 nm wavelength [43]."
21,Absorbance and transmittance of films enriched with NPs of radish and mushroom extract during strawberry storage,"3.4 Absorbance and transmittance of films enriched with NPs of radish and mushroom extract during strawberry storage Based on the previously-outlined results, Ch/PVA films enriched with chitosan NPs blended with 30% mushroom extracts, and Ch/PVP with NPs of chitosan and 10% radish extract were selected for the strawberry packaging. Slight differences in the optical absorbance and transmittance of the films at around 310 nm in terms of the fungal growth on strawberry were observed (Fig. 3 ). According to Yuan et al. [46] and Alispahic et al. [47], the phenols are compounds that show optical absorbance in this wavelength. On the other hand, in the films enriched with 10% of the radish extract, a decrease in their optical absorbance was observed over the storage in the packaging containing inoculated fruit. In the non-inoculated strawberries, no differences were seen in the films' absorbance, except at 24 h, where the highest absorbance was observed (Fig. 3A and C). Conversely, these films' optical transmittance at 300–320 nm was scarcely modified during their exposition within the packaging in the case of both the inoculated and the non-inoculated strawberries (Fig. 3B and D). Based on these results, the films could behave as R. stolonifer growth indicators, as the time progression correlates with the modification of the films' optical characteristics. In the case of films enriched with mushroom extract, there was no clear correlation between the films' exposure period and their optical absorbance and the transmittance values shown in Fig. 3(E–H). In this regard, Duncan [48] stated that hybrid and nanocomposite polymers are created to disperse an inert, nanoscale filler throughout a polymeric matrix. Some filler materials made up of organic and inorganic compounds can take the form of nanoplates, nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanocrystals and nanofibers, and nanowhiskers. The hybrid polymers are stronger than others, more resistant to moisture, and have barrier properties because the dispersed nanocomposites are substantially impermeable in inorganic and organic compounds. Consequently, the gas molecules must diffuse around them rather than take a straight-line path perpendicular to the film's surface. It suggests that inside the packaging, the VOCs can be released and can accumulate as a result of the metabolism of the strawberry and strawberry-fungi systems. Furthermore, the VOCs profile of healthy strawberries can be modified by R. stolonifer growth, and a different VOCs profile can be obtained, as reported by Rojas-Flores et al. [49]. Then, because the Ch/PVA and Ch/PVP films could be impermeable, VOCs could adhere to the surface of the film. On the other hand, using nanocomposites of mushroom and radish extracts, the type and amount of attached VOCs are different for each one. Additionally, it is important to highlight that radish extracts were blended with citric acid before elaborating NPs to avoid their phenols' oxidation. Phenols could be responsible for establishing links with the released VOCs. It could modify their pH; consequently, a colour change is observed. It could explain the differences observed in the optical absorbance of the films. Furthermore, Ding et al. [50] found that pH modifies the optical absorbance of PVA films incorporated with cellulose, ranging from 0.85 to 1 at pH 7 and 10, respectively. It is based on which pH change could have occurred in the films when the fruit-fungus system's VOCs adhere to them, modifying their optical absorbance."
22,Mechanical properties in the films of Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract,"3.5 Mechanical properties in the films of Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract Overall, regardless of the plant extract added, the Ch/PVA films have the highest tensile strength (TS) and elongation than Ch/PVP films. The Ch/PVA films decreased TS by 53% and elongation by 23% when the mushroom extract was incorporated. On the contrary, the Ch/PVP films improved their TS and elongation by 23% and 50%, respectively, with radish extract (Table 3 ). The decrease in the mechanical properties evaluated on the films could be explained in two approaches: 1) due to the short interaction and poor compatibility induced among compounds which may have resulted in the loss of film cohesion, and therefore, a decrease in TS as previously reported by Kasai et al. [51] with PVA/chitosan (90:10) and Syzygium cumini leaves extract (0.2% –0.8%) and 2) some compounds of small size present in the mushroom extract could have filled the inner holes in the chitosan/PVA matrix, inducing the development of continuous matrices with less molecular mobility and free volume and producing films with higher cross chains and consequently with higher stiffness as described Souza et al. [52]. Conversely, the increase in TS and elongation in chitosan/PVP films could be due to the compatibility between the radish plant extracts' phenolic compounds and the Ch/PVP matrix. Additionally, these same authors stated that the presence of more complex and heavier molecules at ginger hydro-alcoholic extracts developed plasticisers' function responsible for disrupting the chemical bonds between chitosan chains and reducing its rigidity. Similarly, Arcan and Yemenicio [53] reported that phenolic compounds present in plant extracts have OH groups that form hydrogen bonds and covalent bonding with chitosan and water. Increasing these compounds creates a stronger network within the polymers' film matrix and improves the mechanical properties. Also, Cheng et al. [54] found that phenolic compounds develop plasticisers' function, increasing the mechanical properties of films as it was observed in zein/chitosan composites films added with ferulic and gallic acids. These plasticisers are low-molecular-weight polymers that increased the spacing between the chains of crystalline polymer, reduced the tension of deformation, hardness, density, viscosity and an electrostatic charge of the polymer, and at the same time increased the polymer chain flexibility, resistance to fracture and dielectric constant [55]."
23,Phenols content in the films of Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract,"3.6 Phenols content in the films of Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract As it was clearly observed, phenolic compounds were quantified in both films (Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract) ranging from 1500 μg GAEg−1 sample to 2000 μg GAE g−1 sample (Fig. 4 ). The content of phenols content in films are related to the fact that the radish plant showed 0.75 mg GAE g−1 of fresh weight and mushroom 6.23–7.66 mg GAE g−1 of fresh weight [46,47]. It was evident that films enriched with radish extract had the highest phenols content; perhaps, the citric acid included in the formulation retarded the phenols' oxidation process. Siripatrawan and Vitchayakitti [56] determined 4 mg GAE g−1 in chitosan films added with propolis extract at 2.5%; its value was similar to the value found in this study. On this, Popa et al. [57] stated that the phenols are complexing agents by the development of non-covalent forces derives from their relative molecular mass and aromatic nuclei; therefore, it forms stable structures with the chitosan."
24,Morphology and size of chitosan NPs blended with radish extract by TEM,"3.7 Morphology and size of chitosan NPs blended with radish extract by TEM The chitosan NPs with radish extract showed a regular and spherical shape with an average size of at least 20 nm; they were evenly distributed and not agglomerated (Fig. 5 ). It is in agreement with those reported by Karimirad et al. [58], who evaluated sizes ranging from 20 to 60 nm for chitosan NPs with Citrus aurantium essential oil. Similarly, González-Saucedo et al. [22] found a particle size of 12 nm for chitosan NPs, and a particle size of 77 nm when Byrsonima crassifolia extract was added to chitosan NPs. Factors such as pH, the plant extracts concentration, and the stirring speed during the synthesis of nanoparticles could be responsible for the variations in size and morphology of the NPs. On this, Jain et al. [59] reported that the pH of a reaction changes the electrical charges and reduces the ability of biomolecules such as phenols and flavonoids; consequently, NPs containing these compounds increase their size. Additionally, they stated that the AgNPs size increased with increasing the ratio of the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum. Finally, the NPs size increased by a low stirring speed, perhaps because small particles were aggregated to form a more homogeneous population of particles [60]."
25,Encapsulation efficiency and yield of chitosan NPs with radish extract,"3.8 Encapsulation efficiency and yield of chitosan NPs with radish extract The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of c.a. 40% was determined by the UV–Visible spectrophotometry, representing the amount of radish extract enclosed into the Ch/PVP matrix (Table 4 ). Kala et al. [61] reported an encapsulation efficiency of 60% in pectin-cedarwood essential oil (1:0.5) nanocapsules obtained by the ionic gelation method. The authors indicated that the encapsulation efficiency might vary and be affected by numerous factors such as the nature of the bioactive compound, polymer concentration, ratio of bioactive compound to polymer, and stirring speed. Khaira et al. [28] quantified an EE from 50 to 80% in NPs of starch and gemcitabine hydrochloride at different ratios (1:1–1:8) embedded in the PVA matrix at 1.5%. Hosseini et al. [62] found an EE in the range of values from 5 to 24% in chitosan NPs loaded with oregano essential oil (OEO); observing a decreasing in the EE of NPs with increasing in OEO amount; being 1:0.1 (chitosan: OEO) the ratio with the highest EE. According to Yang and Hon [63], the EE for TPP/chitosan NPs ranged from 28 to 66%. The size, surface charge, and morphology of the chitosan NPs were all greatly affected by drug fluorouracil's absorption in the assay and chitosan molecular weight. They observed that the chitosan solution's lower molecular weight (55-kDa) had the shorter chitosan fragments made its free amino groups easier to protonate and thus, leading to greater absorption of the drug through ionic interactions. Conversely, the chitosan solution's high molecular weight (110-kDa-Mv and 550-kDa-Mv) loaded with 14 mg of the drug showed the lowest EE (c.a. 27%). Hence, in this present research, the EE determined could have been affected by the amount of plant extract used causing the saturation of chitosan nanoparticles and observing a low value of EE. On the other hand, chitosan NPs with radish extract had a yield of 60%. Alishahi et al. [64] showed that a high molecular weight of chitosan increases the particle surface charge; therefore, the crosslinking bond with the negatively charged particles increases; consequently, the nanoparticles yield is higher. Gupta et al. [65] found a similar yield (51–54%) in the herbal extract of Allium sativum (garlic) loaded chitosan NPs, observing that when the concentration of polymer increase, the yield decrease, since the increase in polymeric concentration becomes the solution viscous."
26,Microstructure by SEM of chitosan/PVP films incorporated with 10% radish extract during storage of strawberries,"3.9 Microstructure by SEM of chitosan/PVP films incorporated with 10% radish extract during storage of strawberries The films' morphology is rearranged when exposed to an “external interface” such as substrate, polymer, vacuum, and moisture. In the present study, R. stolonifer fungi and strawberry fruit released VOCs and moisture; thus, the partial or complete film surface wetting could dramatically change its final morphology [39]. Fig. 6 shows the cross-section micrographs and the films' surface placed in inoculated and non-inoculated strawberry packaging for 8, 24, and 48 h. The cross-section and surface of all the films showed a continuous structure without any phase separation over 48 h, probably by the miscibility and stability among the tested polymers due to hydrogen bonding. Specifically, the films' surface micrographs in packaging with inoculated strawberries showed spongy pore and a hollow appearance. Gómez et al. [66] explained that during the drying process of films, the system's water trap acts as a porogenic agent. They also observed that the incorporation of Aloe vera gel and silver NPs in the polymeric systems altered the pore size, but when chitosan predominated in the mixture, it displayed narrower pores, producing a more compact structure. For cross-section films, spherical microcapsules distributed homogeneously were observed embedded in the chitosan/PVP matrix. According to López-Mata et al. [67], this occurs when chitosan (positively charged) is adhered to negatively charged droplets' surface, forming droplet aggregates. On the other hand, free radish extracts and as NPs in the film did not affect the cross-section and the surface morphology of Ch-PVP films, showing a good dispersion into the matrix. Finally, the films' cross-section and surface did not differ in their structure after being exposed inside the plastic packaging with the inoculated fruit. Similarly, Sizílio et al. [68] observed that Ch/PVP films had a smooth and homogenous surface with no cracks. This behaviour was attributed to hydrogen bonds forming between the pyrrolidine rings of PVP and the amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan [69,70]. Then, the blend of both polymers gave highly miscible material with superior properties. Akhtar et al. [71] showed that adding plant extracts such as beetroot and purple carrot extract to hydroxypropyl methylcellulose films gave a smooth and homogeneous structure, obtained as a result of the compatibility between the compounds. Based on these results, there is a high probability that the plant extracts used in this investigation were compatible with chitosan and PVP."
27,Visual assessment of Rhizopus stolonifer growth on strawberry,"3.10 Visual assessment of Rhizopus stolonifer growth on strawberry The inoculated fruit showed visible symptoms of the growth of R. stolonifer after 48 h. The fungal growth increased considerably, leading to severe softening of the tissue and water release at 72 h. The non-inoculated fruit did not show fungal symptoms during storage (Table 5 ). Similarly, Castañeda-Ramírez et al. [72] reported R stolonifer necrosis at 72 h in the case of stored strawberries. On this, Lennartsson et al. [73] stated that Rhizopus species assimilate sugars such as pentose and cellobiose, which are normally found during the hydrolysis of plant-based materials. This fungus has remarkably heat-stable enzymes, and when its mycelium is submerged into the cell wall, it produces spore structures that break the surface and resist wetting, explaining the spoilage observed in this study."
28,Conclusion,"In this study, the starting hypothesis was confirmed since the Chitosan/PVP films enriched with blends of chitosan NPs with 10% radish extract decreased their optical absorbance as the fungal infection progressed. The total phenols were quantified in films of Ch/PVP/10% radish extract and Ch/PVA/30% mushroom extract. Additionally, it was observed that the films' cross-section and surface showed a homogeneous morphology without any separation phase for 48 h. The chitosan/PVA/PVP films showed a maximum absorbance peak and a minimum transmittance peak at around a wavelength of 310 nm. Furthermore, the Ch/PVA films showed 40% more optical absorbance than Ch/PVP in the range from 300 to 320 nm, regardless of the plant extract concentration. Thus, future applications could be explored for them, such as low-cost elements for biosensor design, to detect the growth of postharvest fungi and reduce postharvest losses during strawberry storage."
