0,Introduction,"Currently, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is considered the most attractive renewable feedstock for the chemical industry, being significantly cheaper than crude oil and worldwide readily available (Ge et al., 2018). Consequently, there has been an increasing interest in developing LCB-derived platform molecules to contribute to the sustainable development of the chemical industry. Indeed, major multinational companies are developing industrial processes to valorize LCB into valuable chemicals, fuels or materials (Chandel et al., 2020). Besides economic and environmental aspects, the use of LCB avoids the twenty-year ethical dilemma of “food vs. fuel” (Thompson, 2012). The challenge in using LCB is to develop efficient and cost-effective processes and technologies for the pretreatment and fractionation aimed at a full valorization of this biomass (i.e., lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose) (Merklein et al., 2016). A recent analysis showed that the bio-based product sales in 2012 were $252 billion and renewable-based chemical sales were approximately 9% of worldwide chemical sales, being expected to grow 4% annually, and even up to 8% (from $375 to $441 billion) by 2020 (Takkellapati et al., 2018). The production of platform molecules from LCB is quite significant (Dutta et al., 2012; Isikgor and Becer, 2015; Kohli et al., 2019; Luterbacher et al., 2014). There are some industrial processes for the valorization of cellulose and hemicellulose: cellulosic ethanol produced through steam explosion by Raizen company, isobutanol by Gevo company or muconic acid by Amyris company. Among them, levulinic acid and the further upgraded molecule γ-valerolactone (GVL) are up-and-coming ones, showing the advantages of being stable for storage and transportation but also the reactivity for upgrading to other chemicals and fuels. In particular, due to its low vapor pressure value with temperature (Horváth et al., 2008; Pokorný et al., 2017), high flash point (96 °C) and low melting point (-31 °C), GVL is considered a promising solvent (Chew et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). This renewable molecule can also be used as a fuel additive instead of ethanol, which is corrosive and volatile (Alonso et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). GVL is also a platform molecule that can be valorized into bio-products to be used as fuels, materials and chemicals (Fig. 1 ). Among the possible routes for GVL production from LCB, one can cite three different ways for the hydrogenation of levulinic acid or alkyl levulinates: (Alonso et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015) (i) use of molecular hydrogen (Al-Shaal et al., 2012; Du et al., 2013; Hengne and Rode, 2012; Luo et al., 2013; Mehdi et al., 2008; Park et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2014; Sudhakar et al., 2014; Testa et al., 2015); (ii) in-situ decomposition of formic acid to hydrogen (Deng et al., 2010, 2009; Du et al., 2011; Fábos et al., 2014; Fellay et al., 2008; Heeres et al., 2009; Hengne et al., 2014; Mehdi et al., 2008; Ortiz-Cervantes and García, 2013; Ruppert et al., 2016; Son et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2013) and (iii) alcohols for catalytic transfer hydrogenation by Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reaction (Chia and Dumesic, 2011; Enumula et al., 2016; He et al., 2016; Kuwahara et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016a, 2016b; Song et al., 2015a, 2015b; Tang et al., 2015, 2013). In this study, the production of GVL by catalytic hydrogenation of alkyl levulinate using hydrogen gas was studied, which is the most efficient way (Tang et al., 2014). Several homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts with non-noble, noble metals and miscellaneous metals have been developed to catalyze this reaction (Table 1 ). Ru catalyst was found to be one of the most active and selective for GVL synthesis (Manzer, 2004). Hence, several studies in Ru catalyst with other support such as carbon, TiO2, zeolites, etc. were carried out. For example, Ru supported on hydroxyapatite catalyst demonstrated higher activity and selectivity than Pt, Pd and Ni for hydrogenation of LA at low pressure and temperature (Sudhakar et al., 2014). However, the supports of Ru-catalysts and solvents also have significant effects on the hydrogenation of LA (Luo et al., 2013). Non-acidic supports favor a high yield of GVL, while the zeolite-supported acidic catalysts can directly convert LA to pentanoic acid in dioxane under mild conditions. Besides, deactivation of catalyst due to the loss of acid sites by dealumination limits catalyst reuse. In this study, the catalyst Ru/C was used because it is one of the most efficient catalysts (Wright and Palkovits, 2012). The production of GVL from the hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates or LA over Ru/C is a two-step reaction (Fig. 2 ). In the first step, hydrogenation of LA or its esters with H2 to intermediate is catalyzed by Ru/C. In the second step, intra-cyclization of intermediate occurs to form GVL. The second step can be catalyzed by the presence of protons from levulinic acid dissociation, solvent or catalyst. The role of solvent in biomass valorization plays an important role (Altuntepe et al., 2017; Shuai and Luterbacher, 2016). In heterogeneous catalysis, the solvent can compete with the reactants during the adsorption steps (Bertero et al., 2011; D’Agostino et al., 2017, 2016. Also, the solvent choice can have an effect on the hydrogen solubility and the cyclization step by favoring or not protons mobility. Some studies have investigated the solvent effect of this reaction. Luo et al. (2013) studied the impact of dioxane and 2-ethylhexanoic acid solvents on the hydrogenation of levulinic acid over Ru-based catalysts. They showed that the 2-ethylhexanoic solvent is more stable under the operating conditions and has a similar acidity constant with respect to levulinic acid. Kasar et al. (2018) studied the effect of different alcohol solvents (methanol, 2-propanol and n-butanol) and water solvent on the hydrogenation of levulinic acid over Co/La2O3 catalyst. They showed that the water solvent causes the highest GVL selectivity in the water solvent, but not the highest conversion. They stated that the solvent with the bulkier group decreases the kinetics of the whole process. Feng et al. (2020) also showed that the GVL selectivity is optimal in water solvent (compared to ethanol or 2-propanol) for the hydrogenation of ethyl levulinate over Fe–Mo2C-1:18. Xu et al. (2019) studied the effect of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and dioxane solvent on the hydrogenation of levulinic acid over Ni/C-500 catalyst. They observed that GVL was mainly produced in dioxane and isopropanol solvents. The hydrogenation of levulinic acid in methanol and ethanol also leads to methyl and ethyl levulinates. Hengst et al. (2015) studied the effect of different alcohols as solvents on conversion and selectivity for the hydrogenation of LA over 15 wt% Ni/γ-Al2O3. From their experiments, 1-propanol is an adequate solvent. They also found that the solvent-free reaction gives attractive results. It was also found that GVL is a suitable solvent for this reaction in terms of kinetics (Qi and Horváth, 2012; Wettstein et al., 2012). Despite the flourishing literature on the solvent effect for this reaction system, the side esterification or transesterification reaction was not taken into account in some investigations. Also, the solubility of hydrogen was never discussed, and kinetic models were developed in these references (Feng et al., 2020; Hengst et al., 2015; Kasar et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2013; Qi and Horváth, 2012; Wettstein et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019). To avoid the separation complexity, three scenarii are interesting to evaluate: reaction mixture with an excess of levulinate, of the corresponding alcohol, and of GVL. To evaluate the effect of these reaction mixtures on the reaction kinetics, a fair comparison should be performed by developing a kinetic model for each reaction mixture, including hydrogen solubility. In the present work, the reaction mixture effect on the kinetics of butyl levulinate hydrogenation to GVL over Ru/C was investigated. Three systems were compared: hydrogenation in excess of BL, of 1-butanol, and of GVL. In the first part, the vapor pressure of these solvents with temperature was discussed. Then, the solubility of hydrogen as a function of temperature and reaction composition was estimated by the PC-SAFT (Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory) equation of state. A kinetic model for each reaction mixture was developed by using Bayesian statistics."
1,Experimental section,
2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals The following chemicals were used without further purification: γ-valerolactone (wt% ≥ 99%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ru/C catalyst (Ruthenium, 5% on activated carbon powder, standard, reduced, nominally 50% water wet); N-Butyl levulinate (wt% ≥ 98%) and Butan-1-ol (wt% ≥ 98%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Hydrogen gas (H2 purity > 99.999 vol%) was from Linde. Acetone (analytical grade) was bought from VWR. Furfural was supplied by Acros Organics."
3,Analytical methods,"2.2 Analytical methods The GC-FID was used to analyze the concentration of n-butyl levulinate and intermediate products. The apparatus is Bruker Scion GC436 equipped with a flame ionization detector, an autosampler, and a capillary column (Rxi-5 ms, 30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium (99.99%) is the carrier gas used at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL min−1 to transfer the sample from the injector, through the column and into the FID-detector. The temperature of the injector and the detector was set at 270 °C. The oven temperature was provided at 35 °C (3 min) − 15 °C min−1 –300 °C. The injection volume was 5 μL, and the split ratio was 30:1. Furfural was used as an internal standard."
4,Kinetic experiments,"2.3 Kinetic experiments The hydrogenation reaction was performed under isothermal and isobaric conditions in a 300 mL stainless steel batch Parr reactor equipped with an electrically heating jacket and a cooling coil (Fig. 3 ). A thermocouple measured the reaction temperature. A vigorous gas-liquid-solid mixing was ensured by a gas entrainment stirrer. The desired amount of reaction mixture and catalyst were loaded into the reactor, and then the reactor was sealed. A vacuum pump removed air from the reactor. The temperature was set at the desired value, and the agitation speed was fixed to 400 rpm to homogenize the temperature. When the temperature reached the desired value, valve V1 was opened to allow the gas to go into the reactor, and the agitation rate was set to 1000 rpm. In this way, the three different phases inside the reactor vessel were well mixed, and the reaction started. In previous work, it was found that external and internal liquid-solid mass transfer can be neglected under this operating condition (Wang et al., 2019). During the reaction, at different times, samples were withdrawn through valve V6. The samples were filtered by a syringe to separate the liquid reaction mixture from the catalyst Ru/C. Tables 2–4 show the experimental matrix with the operating conditions."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Vapor pressure,"3.1 Vapor pressure The vapor pressure of the solvent governs the choice of the reaction temperature, and thus the reaction kinetics. Indeed, a high vapor pressure value limits the reaction temperature range. The variation of butanol vapor pressure from 100 °C to 195 °C was measured by Safarov et al. (2015). Aspen Plus evaluated the vapor pressure evolution for BL and GVL with temperature. As suggested by Ariba et al. (2020), the Benedict − Webb − Rubin − Starling virial equation of state was used to calculate the vapor pressure values of BL and GVL between 100 °C and 195 °C. PC-SAFT was also used to estimate the vapor pressure evolution with temperature. One can notice that the PC-SAFT models, developed in this study, fit the vapor pressures obtained from the literature. The PC-SAFT methodology and use are described in the subsequent chapter. Fig. 4 shows the change of the vapor pressure of the three pure solvents with temperature. Hydrogenation of alkyl levulinate over Ru/C is usually performed within the temperature range of 100–180 °C. Fig. 4 shows that the evaporation of BL and GVL can be assumed to be negligible in this temperature range. This observation is not the case when butanol is used as a solvent. Based on these results, experiments were performed in the temperature range 100–120 °C to limit evaporation. The experimental matrix for each solvent is displayed in Tables 2–4 in the experimental section."
7,Solvent effect on the kinetics,"3.2 Solvent effect on the kinetics To compare the reaction mixture effect on the reaction kinetics, experiments were carried at 100 °C, 20 bar of hydrogen, and 1 g of wet catalyst (Exps 2, 4 and 6 in Tables 2–4). Clearly enough, initial BL concentration was the same for experiments using an excess of GVL or BuOH but could not be the same when using BL in excess. As discussed in the introduction section, there are two consecutive reactions. Thus, the conversion of BL and the GVL yield needs to be compared. The BL conversion and GVL yield were calculated as (1) B L c o n v e r s i o n / % = B L 0 - B L B L 0 ∗ 100 (2) Y i e l d o f G V L / % = Concentration o f G V L p r o d u c e d B L 0 ∗ 100 Fig. 5 shows the reaction mixture effect on the kinetics of the hydrogenation step. Fig. 5 shows that the kinetics of hydrogenation follows the order: RHydrogenation/GVL > RHydrogenation/BuOH > RHydrogenation/BL, where RHydrogenation/Reaction-Mixture is the rate of hydrogenation. One can notice that until 20 min, the kinetics is similar for the hydrogenation step in the reaction mixture with an excess of BuOH or of GVL. This difference of kinetics can be explained by hydrogen solubility, competition on the active catalyst site, or the solvation effect. Fig. 6 shows the kinetics of the second reaction step, i.e., cyclization. The kinetics in reaction mixtures with an excess of GVL or BuOH are similar for the cyclization. However, the cyclization in the reaction mixture with an excess of BL is slower compared to the two other. The kinetics of the second reaction is not linked to hydrogen pressure (Wang et al., 2019). Thus, the intermediate is more stable in the BL environment than in the BuOH or GVL environments. The development of kinetic models for these three scenarii requires the knowledge of hydrogen solubility and its variation with the chemical composition and temperature."
8,PC-SAFT modeling,"3.3 PC-SAFT modeling Modeling the vapor pressure of pure components is realized by a vapor-liquid equilibrium condition. For pure-components, the fugacity coefficient, which describes the deviation from the ideal-gas behavior of the component in the vapor phase ( φ 0 i V ) needs to be equal to the fugacity coefficient of the pure component in the liquid phase φ 0 i L . The following relation was applied in this work to describe the vapor-liquid equilibrium of a pure component: (3) 1 - φ 0 i L φ 0 i V < 10 - 8 Modeling gas solubility in any solvent or solvent mixture is realized by a vapor-liquid equilibrium condition. At high-pressure conditions, an equation of state is required that allows solving the isofugacity criterion, which must be fulfilled for each component i in Eq (4) that is present in the two phases (liquid, L and vapor, V): (4) φ i L · x i = φ i V · y i In this equation, y i denotes the mole fraction of the component i in the vapor phase. The equation is solved iteratively in order to finally obtain the solubility of the gas in the liquid phase, i.e. x i . In this work, the hydrogen solubility in pure solvents and solvent mixtures is modeled, and the fugacity coefficients were predicted with PC-SAFT by using the following equation: (5) ln φ i = μ i r e s k B · T - ln 1 + ∂ a r e s k B · T ∂ ρ Here, kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature in Kelvin, and µi res, ρ and ares denote the residual chemical potential, reduced density, and residual Helmholtz energy, respectively. In this work, classical PC-SAFT (Gross and Sadowski, 2001) was used that accounts for three independent contributions to the residual Helmholtz energy a res : (6) a res = a hc + a disp + a assoc These independent contributions are a hc (hard–chain contribution), a disp (dispersion contribution), a assoc (association contribution). Such expressions are available in the original PC-SAFT publication, and require the availability of pure-component parameters: the segment number m seg , the segment diameter σ i , dispersion-energy parameter u i / k B and two association parameters ε AiBi (association-energy parameter) and κ AiBi (association-volume parameter). The 2B association scheme that mimics the number of hydrogen-bond donors Ai and acceptors Bi was applied in this work to 1-butanol. All other components were treated as non-associating, i.e., these can neither form self-associations nor cross-associations. Such parameters are available for the components considered in this work, according to Table 5 . The parameters allow satisfactorily modeling the vapor pressures of 1-butanol, GVL, and BL, which is illustrated in Fig. 4. Besides, one can notice a good agreement between vapor pressure determined from references (Ariba et al., 2020; Safarov et al., 2015), and the ones estimated by the PC-SAFT method. Based on the pure-component parameters from Table 5, the solubility of H2 in the single solvents 1-butanol, GVL, and BL was modeled using the isofugacity criterion. Modeling mixtures require combining and mixing rules. Therefore, Berthelot–Lorenz combining rules (Berthelot, 1898; Lorentz, 1881) were incorporated into PC–SAFT as follows: (7) σ ij = 1 2 ( σ i + σ j ) (8) u ij = u i u j ( 1 - k ij ( T ) ) The binary kij parameters have been used according to Table 6 . It can be observed from Table 6 that only for the mixture H2-1-butanol kij parameters were used. The fitted values for the pair H2-1-butanol are valid in the temperature range 295–525 K, only valid with the pure-component parameters in Table 5. A kij parameter was not required for the mixture H2-GVL as PC-SAFT allowed for a reasonable prediction (kij = 0) for the H2 solubility in GVL. Further, the kij parameter was set to zero for the mixture H2-BL as experimental data was not available for this mixture. The result of the PC-SAFT modeled H2 solubility in the single solvents is illustrated in Fig. 7 at 20 bar between 100 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The H2 solubility increases in the order xH2(in GVL) < xH2(in BL) < xH2(in 1-butanol). In all solvents, xH2 increases with temperature, which is a special characteristic of H2 compared to other gases that show the regular behavior that gas solubility decreases with increasing temperature. This can be predicted with PC-SAFT reasonably. Please note that the kij parameters between H2 and 1-butanol were fitted in this work to data at pressures between 40 bar and 80 bar, while Fig. 7 shows the solubility at 20 bar. Thus, due to a lack of data at 20 bar it is not possible to validate PC-SAFT modeled H2 solubility in 1-butanol at 20 bar. Based on the pure-component parameters and the binary kij parameters, PC-SAFT was applied to predict the H2 solubility in solvent mixtures at various conditions. One can notice that the hydrogenation rate (Fig. 5) and hydrogen solubility (Fig. 7) in the solvent do not evolve in the same way. Indeed, the rate of BL hydrogenation evolves in the following order: RHydrogenation/GVL > RHydrogenation/BuOH > RHydrogenation/BL, and the solubility of hydrogen evolves in the following order: xH2(in 1-butanol) > xH2(in BL) > xH2(in GVL). As mentioned earlier, the hydrogenation rates in butanol and GVL reaction mixtures are similar during the first 20 min. Fig. S1 (Supplementary Materials) shows the evolution of hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase along the reaction time for experiments 2, 4 and 6. One can notice that the solubility of hydrogen is higher in BL reaction mixture during the reaction than in the other reaction mixtures. The fact that the hydrogenation rate in BL reaction mixture is the slowest one despite the solubility in this reaction mixture is higher and could be explained by surface reaction competition. The use of PC-SAFT demonstrates that hydrogen solubility does not explain the solvent-induced difference of kinetics. The difference of reactivity is linked to the kinetics, and particularly the activation energies and rate constants. Hence, kinetic modeling is needed to estimate these kinetic constants."
9,Kinetic modeling,"3.4 Kinetic modeling Several studies (Negahdar et al., 2017; Piskun et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019) have shown that the rate expression for the hydrogenation of alkyl levulinates over Ru/C can be expressed by a power-law. The kinetic expression for the hydrogenation step was expressed as: (9) R Hydrogenation = R 1 = k 1 ∗ C BL ∗ C H 2 ∗ ω cat k g o f d r y b a s i s c a t a l y s t p e r L o f r e a c t i o n m i x t u r e The concentration of hydrogen in the liquid phase was estimated from the PC-SAFT method. For the cyclization step, the kinetic expression in GVL and BL was expressed as: (10) R Cyclization = R 2 = k 2 ∗ C Int Based on the experimental data, the reverse reaction for the cyclization step in butanol solvent cannot be neglected. Hence, the kinetic expression was expressed as (11) R Cyclisation = R 2 = k 2 · C Int - 1 K · C GVL · C BuOH The kinetics of mass transfer can be considered to be fast compared to the reaction kinetics (Wang et al., 2019). The material balances were derived as: (12) d C BL dt = - R 1 (13) d C Int dt = R 1 - R 2 (14) d C GVL dt = R 2 (15) d C BuOH dt = R 2 Athena Visual Studio® v14.2 was used to estimate the kinetic and equilibrium constants (Stewart and Caracotsios, 2010, 2008). This software uses the Bayesian estimation method for non-linear regressions. The DDALPUS algorithm solved the ordinary differential equations (12)–(15) (Caracotsios and Stewart, 1985). The GREGLUS package, using a Bayesian estimator, can provide optimal parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals. This package provides the normalized parameter covariance matrix. During the parameter estimation, the GREGPLUS package minimizes the objective function S θ , and can calculate the maximum posterior probability density of the different estimated parameters θ and the values of the posterior distribution of the tested models (Stewart and Caracotsios, 2010, 2008). (16) S θ = n + m + 1 · l n υ θ With, n is the number of events in response, m is the number of responses, and the term υ θ is the determinant of the covariance matrix of the responses. Each element of this matrix is defined as (17) υ ij θ = ∑ u = 1 n Y iu - f iu ξ u , θ · Y ju - f ju ξ u , θ with Yiu the experimental concentration and f iu ξ u , θ the estimated value for the response i and event u; Yju the experimental concentration and f ju ξ u , θ the estimated value for response j and event u. To avoid the correlation between the pre-exponential factor and activation energy, a modified Arrhenius equation was used to express the rate constants (18) k 1 T = k 1 T = 378.15 K · e x p - E a 1 R · 1 T - 1 378.15 (19) k 2 T = k 2 T = 378.15 K · e x p - E a 2 R · 1 T - 1 378.15 Due to the narrow temperature range (100–120 °C), the equilibrium constant K can be assumed to be temperature independent. The kinetic constants ( k 1 T = 378.15 K , E a 1 , k 2 T = 378.15 K and E a 2 ) were estimated for each solvent (Tables 2–4). For the hydrogenation in butanol solvent, the equilibrium constant was estimated. The concentrations of BL, intermediate and GVL were used as observables during the regression. Fig. 8 shows the fit of the models to the experimental concentration for some experiments. In general, the models fit the experimental data, as confirmed by parity plots (Fig. S2, Supplementary Materials). To evaluate the quality of the three models, an F-test of overall significance was carried out. It was found that the three models were significant at 99%. The developed models in reaction mixtures with an excess of GVL or BL have a slight tendency to underestimate BL concentrations (Fig. 8, Exps 2&5). The developed model in the reaction mixture with an excess of butanol tends to underestimate intermediate concentrations (Fig. 8, Exp. 8). The fact that the models underestimate some concentrations might be linked to surface reactions that were not considered. Table 7 displays the values of estimated parameters and their confidence interval. The confidence interval values (Table 7) and the covariance matrix (Tables S1–S3, Supplementary Materials) show that the parameters are well estimated. The correlations between the estimated parameters vary from low to medium showing good reliability of the developed models. One can notice that the activation energies of the hydrogenation step are similar in reaction mixtures with an excess of BL or GVL and lower than the one in the reaction mixture with an excess of BuOH. Thus, moving from BL to the transition state in reaction mixtures with an excess of BL or GVL are more accessible from an energy viewpoint. For the second reaction step, i.e., cyclization, the activation energy decreases in the following way: BL_reaction mixture > GVL_reaction mixture > BuOH_reaction mixture. The transient state is more accessible in the BuOH reaction mixture than in the other reaction mixtures. From the estimated rate constants (Table 7), it is possible to calculate the evolution of the rate constants versus time (Fig. 9 ). One can notice that when the reaction temperature is higher than 105 °C, the kinetics of hydrogenation and cyclization steps in the butanol reaction mixture are the highest (Fig. 9). The rate constants in BL reaction mixture are the lowest ones. To have a better overview, kinetic simulations using the same initial operating conditions than Exps 2, 4 and 6 were carried on long reaction time (Fig. 10 ). Fig. 10 confirm that the kinetics in the BuOH reaction mixture is faster, but for the cyclization reaction in the BuOH reaction mixture, the reverse reaction is not negligible, limiting the GVL production. Due to the values of butanol vapor pressure when the temperature is higher than 110 °C, it was deemed reasonable to perform a kinetic comparison within the temperature range 100–110 °C. The kinetics of both reaction steps is faster in the butanol reaction mixture when the reaction temperature is higher than 105 °C; however, the reverse reaction for the cyclization step is not negligible, limiting the GVL production."
10,Conclusion,"The interest in the production of γ-valerolactone (GVL) from the hydrogenation of levulinic acid or alkyl levulinates is increasing. This molecule is produced from second-generation biomass and it is a platform molecule. In the literature, the evolution of hydrogen solubility in different reaction mixtures with an excess of BL, BuOH or GVL for this reaction system has not been considered during the kinetic modeling stage. This study proposed to fill this gap by investigating the solvent effect on the kinetics of GVL production from the hydrogenation of n-butyl levulinate (BL) over Ru/C. Three solvents were tested: GVL reaction mixture, BL reaction mixture and butanol reaction mixture. Kinetic experiments were carried out in an autoclave under isobaric condition at 20 bar and under isothermal condition. Based on the evolution of vapor pressure with temperature for the three solvents, reaction temperatures that cause low vapor pressure, i.e., less than 1 bar, were selected. For this reason, kinetic experiments in GVL, in BL and in butanol reaction mixtures were performed within the temperature ranges 100–120 °C, 100–110 °C and 100–110 °C, respectively. The catalyst amount was varied between 0.0005 and 0.001 kg wet basis. From PC-SAFT, it was found that the hydrogen solubility in these solvents at 20 bar of hydrogen and within the temperature range 100–120 °C increase in the following order: H2 solubility/Butanol solvent > H2 solubility/BL > solvent H2 solubility/GVL solvent. Based on PC-SAFT, it was possible to estimate hydrogen concentration values in the liquid phase at different reaction times. This information was fundamental to the kinetic modeling stage. A kinetic model was developed for each reaction mixture using a Bayesian approach. This reaction system comprises two reaction steps: hydrogenation and cyclization. From the experimental observation, when butanol is used as a reaction mixture, the reverse reaction for the cyclization step is not negligible. The rate equation for each step was expressed using the power-law approach. From the kinetic models, it was found that the kinetics of hydrogenation and cyclization steps are faster in butanol reaction mixture for reaction temperature higher than 105 °C, but the reversibility of the second step limits the production of GVL. At 100 °C and 20 bar of hydrogen, it was found that after 15 h of reaction time, the GVL yields were 27% in butanol, 34% in BL and 87% in GVL. By combining the evolution of vapor pressure, hydrogen solubility, the kinetics of both reaction and the reversibility of this reaction system, the use of GVL reaction mixture is better for the hydrogenation of n-butyl levulinate to GVL."
