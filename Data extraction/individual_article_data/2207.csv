0,Introduction,"Recently, the energy sector is focusing on prospecting new and clean renewable energy sources due to the fossil fuel reserve depletion and severe environmental issues. Bio-hydrogen production from organic waste or lignocellulosic biomass has been standing as a promising technology mainly because of its easy production pathways and clean nature [1]. Especially, conversion of marine algal biomass to biofuels (hydrogen or methane) via dark fermentation has attracted more attention by reason of the abundant and high carbohydrate content without lignin [2,3]. The complex polymeric carbohydrate structure of cellulose biomass, however, still requires a physicochemical treatment such as dilute-acid hydrolysis prior to hydrogen/ethanol fermentation. The physicochemical pretreatment of the cellulose/lignocellulose or algal biomass usually produces the major inhibitor compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and linoleic acid, which were reported as lethal to the growth of H2 producing bacteria, thus ultimately lowering the fermentation performances [4–7]. Hence, detoxification/removal of these inhibitor compounds is a major concern and it can be done by using various chemical, physical and biological methods [8]. There are some reports in earlier investigated the detoxification of 5-HMF using activated or granulated carbon and then used the sugars for hydrogen/ethanol fermentation [2,9–11]. The detoxification process and fermentation process were done separately in these studies. However, for an industrial scale production of H2, avoiding this step could aid in the reduction of initial cost and space required. In this aspect, hybrid immobilized cell operation proved as efficient hydrogen production system compared to suspended cell system [4]. An efficient bioprocess would be successful while it is operated in a continuous mode. Since the algal hydrolysate is viscous and contains solid particles (as a result of pretreatment) performing continuous operation (CSTR) would be of difficult. Regarding this attention, ASBR (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor) operation has been suggested and operated as a feasible way to treat such feedstocks [12–14]. Additionally, these days, membrane bio-reactors also could be used to treat and produce energy carriers efficiently using the solid feedstocks [15]. Thus, in this study, an attempt has been made to avoid the inhibitor removal step by using the hybrid immobilized cells (H-IC), which has been incorporated with the activated carbon for algal hydrolysate (AH). Up to the author's knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the simultaneous H2 production and 5-HMF removal using hybrid immobilized cells."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Feedstock and seed inoculum,"2.1 Feedstock and seed inoculum Gelidium amansii was washed using tap water for the removal of sea salts and impurities, then grinded by a hammer mill, and sieved to a final powder size below 300μm. By using this G. amansii powder, slurry was prepared as follows: 200kg of G. amansii powder and 2m3 of 2% (w/v) H2SO4 were added into a 5m3 high pressure reactor equipped with an impeller, a temperature controller, and a pressure gauge. This slurry of G. amansii was heat-treated at 150°C for 10min, and then neutralized using 66% pure calcium hydroxide up to pH6.5. Subsequently, the slurry was centrifuged at 3500rpm for 10min. After centrifugation, supernatant of hydrolysate was concentrated up to 2-fold at 60°C using a vacuum evaporator. The characteristics of the concentrated pretreated algal hydrolysate were as follows: total sugar 33.24g/L (galactose: 29.52g/L and glucose 3.72g/L) and 5-HMF concentration of 3.2g/L and other chemical composition of G. amansii reported elsewhere [2]. Anaerobic granular sludge was taken from a brewery wastewater treatment plant which possessed total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), volatile suspended solids (VSS) and pH as 22.6g/L, 12.6g/L, and 6.8, respectively. Heat treatment (90°C for 30min in a water bath) was applied as pretreatment to cultivate/enrich spore forming hydrogen producers and also to prohibit the activity of hydrogen consumers (methanogens) in the inoculum. The heat-treated inoculum was further dried in 105°C for 8h and then powdered using a grinder prior to immobilization."
3,Fabrication of hybrid immobilized cells,"2.2 Fabrication of hybrid immobilized cells The hybrid immobilized cells were prepared by mixing powdered sludge with the sodium alginate (2% w/v), chitosan (1% w/v) and activated carbon (2% w/v) mixture and extruded into a calcium chloride solution (2% w/v) solution. Slight modifications in the concentrations of the polymer materials (2% activated carbon) to strengthen the beads were done from the detailed procedure for the immobilization explained in our previous research [4]. The formed immobilized beads were washed with sterile distilled water to remove the excess CaCl2 and then dried using tissue papers. The prepared beads were stored in a refrigerator (around 7°C) until being used in the experiments."
4,Batch hydrogen fermentation,"2.3 Batch hydrogen fermentation Hydrogen fermentation was conducted in batch vials with 60mL of working volume. Various algal hydrolysate (AH) concentrations (20, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100% (v/v) corresponds to the presence of sugars as 6.6, 13.3, 16.6, 19.9, 26.6, and 33.2g/L, respectively) were prepared by different dilutions of the original hydrolysate (100%) with deionized water. In each vial, 10g of the immobilized beads was added with 5mL of nutrient solution (12×) which contained the following ingredients (g/L): 5.24, NH4CO3; 6.72, NaHCO3; 0.125, K2HPO4; 0.1, MgCl2·6H2O; 0.015, MnSO4·6H2O; 0.025, FeSO4·7H2O; 0.005, CuSO4·5H2O; 0.00012, CoCl2·5H2O. Subsequently, the vial was purged with N2 gas for 2–3min to ensure the strict anaerobic condition and then kept in an incubator with an agitation speed of 200rpm and temperature of 35°C±0.1°C. Initial pH was adjusted to 5.5. All the data were obtained from triplicate experiments and the mean values are reported. The variation in the SD values was less than 5%."
5,ASBR operation,"2.4 ASBR operation An ASBR (working volume of 3L) was seeded with 500g of H-IC having 20g/L biomass (as VSS) concentration and filled with 50% AH-feed. The reactor was maintained at 35°C±0.1°C with an operational pH (5.5) and substrate concentration of 50% AH as 16.6g/Lhexose equivalent. Anaerobic condition was provided by N2 purging, the mixing ratio was 150rpm, and pH was controlled by the addition of 3N NaOH solution. Continuous operation was started once the hydrogen production reached 0.5molH2/mol hexoseadded in the batch operation [16], followed by the sequential batch operation with the conditions as follows: filling time: 0.5h, reaction time: 23h and 0.5h for settling and decanting. Fresh AH-feed was added every day. The volume of the biogas produced was measured by water displacement method and adjusted with standard temperature and pressure."
6,Analytical procedure,"2.5 Analytical procedure Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (SRI 310, SRI Instrument) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 1.8m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with mole sieve 5A (SRI Instrument) and a 0.9m×3.2mm stainless-steel column packed with Porapak Q (80/100 mesh, SRI Instrument) with 99.99% nitrogen as carrier gas as reported in our earlier study [17]. The fermentation samples were collected on daily basis and stored in the refrigerator at 4°C prior to analysis of parameters. For the volatile fatty acid (VFA), alcohol and sugar analysis, procedures were described elsewhere [17]. Sugar utilization rate and the remaining 5-HMF concentration were analyzed using HPLC. The average value of the measurements is reported. The detailed analytical procedure is explained in our earlier research [4]. The HPR and HY values were calculated based on the hexose sugars, since algal hydrolysate mainly contains the galactose (87%) as carbohydrate fraction, in addition with some proportion of glucose (26%). Besides, the hydrolysate has been directly used along with the high concentration of 5-HMF (3.2g/L) in it [2]."
7,Kinetic models,"2.6 Kinetic models 2.6.1 Modified-Gompertz equation The hydrogen production curves obtained from the batch experiments were fitted to a modified Gompertz equation (Eq. (1)), which provides a suitable model for describing the hydrogen production rates [18]. (1) H = P × exp − exp R H p × λ − t × e + 1 where H=the cumulative hydrogen production (LH2), P=the ultimate hydrogen production (LH2), RH =the hydrogen production rate (LH2/h), λ=the lag-phage time (h), t=time (h), and e=the exponential (2.71828). 2.6.2 Modified Andrew model The hydrogen production rate obtained from modified Gompertz equation was used to describe the effect of inhibitor concentration (2) R = R max S K S + S + S 2 / K i where R (L/L/d) is the hydrogen production rate; R max (L/L/d) is the hydrogen production rate constant; S is the substrate concentration; K S (g/L) is the half saturation constant; and K i (g/L) is the inhibition constant. Substrate is algal hydrolysate sugars as hexose (galactose+glucose)."
8,Results and discussion,
9,Characterization of the immobilized beads,"3.1 Characterization of the immobilized beads The prepared immobilized beads were approximately 5–6mm in diameter with spherical shape. The density and porosity values were 1.02±0.08g/mL and 36.4±1.6%, respectively [19]. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 1 . Addition of activated carbon could enhance the porosity and gas diffusion as mentioned earlier [4,20]."
10,Removal of 5-HMF and hydrogen production performance at various AH concentrations,"3.2 Removal of 5-HMF and hydrogen production performance at various AH concentrations The hybrid immobilized cells incorporated with activated carbon (2%) has shown the efficient trend on 5-HMF removal on various AH concentrations (Fig. 1 ). The results clearly showed that 5-HMF removal lowered with increased AH concentration. A progressive trend of disappearance of 5-HMF has been noted from 20 to 50% of AH concentration, however further increase in AH concentration lowered the removal efficiency of 5-HMF from 97.3±0.8% to 80.2±3% and remained in the range of 160 to 610mg/L at 60 to 100%-AH concentrations, respectively. A previous study on the removal of 5-HMF from synthetic water hyacinth hydrolysate using activated carbon in a separate process reported the removal efficiency of 45.4%, where the initial 5-HMF concentration of 0.94g/L was used [21]. In this study, the 5-HMF concentration which was not detected from 20 to 50% of AH concentrations revealed the removal efficiency of the system. The removal rate over 80% has been observed at all the experimental sets. Thus, this process is quite efficient than other conventional process reported. The amount of hydrogen produced in all feed concentrations is provided in Fig. 2 . Hydrogen fermentation of various acid hydrolysates of lignocellulose biomass has been reported previously [5,22]. It is obvious from those reports that inhibitor compounds present in the hydrolysate after pH neutralization has to be detoxified to achieve an efficient hydrogen production [23]. Hydrogen production at various feed concentrations is presented in Table 2 . It could be clearly seen that nearly half (50%) of the original hydrolysate concentration (100%, 3.2g/L 5-HMF, thus 50% containing 1.6g/L 5-HMF) produced the maximal cumulative hydrogen and hydrogen production rate (HPR) of ~223mL (222.7±10.7mL) and 1.48±0.10L/L-d, respectively. Daily variation in the cumulative H2 production has been depicted in Fig. 2. It could be mentioned that a progressive production performance occurred. The H2 content also showed as maxima as 61% at this condition (Fig. 2, inset). The lowest HPR, 0.08±0.0L/L-d, was detected with 100% AH feed concentration due to the presence of high amount of 5-HMF (3.2g/L). Besides, the lowest H2 content (15%) is also noted at this condition. It is noteworthy to mention that the lag-phase time, λ, values also indicated about the inhibition of the process, as 80 and 100%-AH exhibited the longest times of 6.4 and 9.4h, respectively, due to the presence of 5-HMF. Whereas 20, 40, 50 and 60% AH have shown the lag-phase times of 3.7, 3.6, 3.5 and 5.7h, respectively and revealed that the H2 fermentation required shorter adaptation period due to the low amount of 5-HMF present (Table 2). This proved the efficiency of this system for the simultaneous removal and H2 production using the hybrid immobilized cells. The modified Andrew model can be used to describe the effect of substrate concentration and their inhibition effects on hydrogen production [24,25]. The HPR obtained at different AH concentrations (in terms of sugars present in each condition) were used to determine the kinetic constants and their values were depicted in Fig. 3 . The results showed that Rmax value of 1.28L/L-d was attained at half saturation substrate concentration constant Ks of 7.85g/L. This value is close to the peak HPR value of 1.48L/L-d attained at 50% AH concentration, where the sugar concentration is 16.6g/L. This proves the accuracy of the modified Andrew model with the experimental data obtained in this research. The inhibition constant (Ki) value was predicted as 10.6g/L, which is similar to the (Ki) value of 13.5g/L obtained from glucose [26]. Either sugar over Ks or 5-HMF over Ki inhibited HPR. In our previous research it is shown that the hydrogen production from galactose (10g/L) was significantly affected with the presence of 5-HMF over 1.2g/L [2]. A similar trend on this research is also noted and it is obvious that the inhibition on hydrogen production might be due to the presence of 5-HMF. Thus, the application of H-IC exhibited better performances in terms of 5- HMF removal and hydrogen production ability than non-detoxified red-algal hydrolysate [2]."
11,Organic acid production in batch operation,"3.3 Organic acid production in batch operation The key step in the H2 production process is acidogenesis, where the acid intermediates are produced and drop the pH of the system to a certain extent [17]. The major sugars present in the red algal hydrolysate were galactose and glucose, while galactose being the high proportion. The soluble metabolic product (SMP) analysis of this mixed pathway has been reported elsewhere in a continuous system [17]. However, the pretreated algal hydrolysate contains the inhibitory compounds (majorly 5-HMF) along with these sugars (galactose and glucose). The organic acid production of the various AH concentrations is presented in Table 3 . It is clearly seen from the results that, increasing sugar concentration resulted in the enhanced production of organic acids; however, slight variations occurred at the higher concentrations of 80 and 100%-AH concentration. Butyric acid and lactic acid were the main volatile fatty acids produced during the fermentation, in all the concentrations evaluated. (3) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 COO − + 2 HCO 3 − + 3 H + + 2 H 2 Δ G O ′ = − 254.0 kJ / mol (4) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 4 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COO − + 2 HCO 3 − + 4 H + + 4 H 2 Δ G O ′ = − 206.0 kJ / mol (5) C 6 H 12 O 6 + 2 H 2 → 2 CH 3 CH 2 COOH + 2 H 2 O Δ G O ′ = − 279.4 kJ / mol The amount of butyric acid (Eq. (3)) production has attributed towards the higher production performance [4]. As the results indicated that peak butyric acid (n-HBu+i-HBu) production of 9515mgCOD/L was attained at the AH concentration of 50%, which showed the highest HPR and HY among the other concentrations tested. The lowest production of 1553mgCOD/L (only i-HBu) observed at 100%-AH concentration obviously indicates the lower production performance. Though more organic acid production was observed at this condition, most of them were the undesired volatile fatty acids (VFA) which inhibit the growth of H2 producers. Similar production results were obtained from 80%-AH concentrations, as the values were low as 178 (n-HBu) and 1443 (i-HBu)mgCOD/L, respectively. In contrast, acetate production (Eq. (4)) was quite lower in all the concentrations evaluated, and the values were ranged from 649–1532mgCOD/L. The total organic acid production was ranged from 5232 to 14,812mgCOD/L, despite the AH concentrations. The production of propionic acid (Eq. (5)) is an undesired/H2 consuming reaction in the metabolic pathway of dark H2 fermentation. Additionally, there are reports mentioned that it had negative effect (or) lowered on the production performances [27,28]. In this study also the same phenomenon has occurred. At 100% AH concentration, the amount of propionic acid production was observed as 4419mgCOD/L, which is the highest among the values noted for other concentrations. The concentration was ranged between 1283 and 4419mg COD/L. The lactic acid (HLa) production and formic (HFo) acid production were also reported as the not likely factors for H2 production [4,29]. Since galactose is a monosaccharide and also the isomer of glucose, the possible production of lactic acid is supported. Besides, the metabolic pathway for the H2 production from galactose is not well elucidated and complicated than glucose [30]. Peak HLa production was noted at the AH concentration of 100% and the value remained as 4477mgCOD/L, which counts for more than 40% of the total organic acid production. Besides, the formation of HFo is also noted as 600mgCOD/L. The HLa concentration was ranged between 2095 and 4447mgCOD/L whereas HFo was ranged between 130 and 620mgCOD/L. The lowest values were observed at 50%-AH concentration which revealed the reason for higher production performances. This explains that butyrate metabolism is more favorable thermodynamically for H2 formation to attain higher H2 production performances [31,32]."
12,Hydrogen production in ASBR: process performance and organic acid production,"3.4 Hydrogen production in ASBR: process performance and organic acid production An ASBR was operated for 12days at a hydraulic retention time of 24h. Fig. 3 shows the production performance of the ASBR. Startup of a bioreactor is an important step to achieve the efficient production performances [33]. Initially the reactor was started-up in a batch mode operation for 24h, and then switched to continuous sequencing batch operation once the hydrogen yield of 0.5mol/mol hexoseadded was achieved [16]. During startup the many issues as discussed in a review by Baknoyi et al. [33]. After the post-startup period the hydrogen production started to increase gradually from 3.1L, reached a stable value of 4.8L at the 8th day of operation and remained on the rest of the days of operation. The rapid start-up time (time to achieve the stable hydrogen production performances with less than 10% standard deviation) achieved in this study might be due to the presence of the stable microbial culture in the H-IC, thus served to reduce the start-up time. Moreover as indicated [34], ASBR operation is more suitable for efficient hydrogen production than CSTR due to the process of retaining the stable microbial community (biomass) and avoiding the wash-out of hydrogen producers. HY is considered as a valid indicator to assess the progress of the hydrogen fermentation [16]. Fig. 3 illustrated that HY increased from 1.54 to 2.40molH2/mol hexoseutilized. In addition, the hydrogen content was also maintained over 63% throughout the experimental conditions, indicating the effective hydrogen production performances from acid pretreated algal hydrolysate. Fig. 4 shows the distribution pattern of the soluble metabolic product concentration. Butyrate and acetate were the major SMP accounted for 79–96% of the total SMP, followed by propionate 3–17% and lactate (0.3–7%) with negligible amount of formate (<1%). In contrast, batch experiments, HPr and HLa concentration were retained over 1846mgCOD/L and 2095mgCOD/L, respectively. Moreover, in ASBR operation during the initial start-up period the propionate and lactate concentration were observed as 890mgCOD/L and 531mgCOD/L and on further operation, the levels dropped to 372mgCOD/L and 40mgCOD/L. The observed difference might be due to the presence of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) along with the heat-treated sludge during initial experimental conditions. As indicated earlier [16], PAB and LAB were not completely suppressed by heat-treatment method, besides the early changes in the switch-over time from batch to continuous might be helpful in the elimination of these (PAB and LAB) populations from the biohydrogen reactor [16]. This study also corresponds to that and the observed reduction in HPr and HLa formation could be due to the elimination of PAB and LAB in continuous operation and resulted in enhanced hydrogen production. The butyrate concentration followed a similar pattern with the same AH concentration during batch circumstances and being the dominant metabolite throughout the entire operation period with an average value of 7505±314mgCOD/L. The butyrate/acetate ratio also lied in the range of 1.3–1.9, which is similar to the earlier report by [35] and indicated that high B/A value favored the increased hydrogen production. Fig. 5 shows the biomass concentration, substrate consumption and 5-HMF removal efficiency of the process. The biomass concentration observed in the range of 1.3 to 2.8g/L, indicates a significant microbial growth during the reactor operational period. The substrate utilization rate remained over 98%, whereas the 5-HMF removal dropped from 98% to 90% at the end of the operation. Obviously this might be due to the gradual detachment of activated carbon. This could be avoided by recycling the detached activated carbon inside the reactor. As indicated by [4], 5-HMF inhibited hydrogen production significantly over the IC50 value of 0.59g/L, however in this study, due to the presence of H-IC even at the presence of 5-HMF concentration nearly 1.6g/L, the hydrogen production was not inhibited and showed a stable hydrogen production performance. Peak HPR (5.3L/L-d) and HY (2.55mol/mol hexose) obtained from this study was quite higher than the other comparative studies in ASBR operation (Table 4 ). Thus, this H-IC system showed the simultaneous toxic (5-HMF) removal and efficient hydrogen production from AH.See Fig. 6 The application of the hybrid immobilized cells on simultaneous removal and hydrogen production was successfully carried out in this investigation. Besides, a significant improvement has been achieved in terms of process efficiency than the other earlier studies. The application of this dual benefit process in a single stage could provide more benefits towards industrial process dealing with pretreated lignocellulose/algae biomass and provides a new platform for the sustainable bioprocess system."
13,Importance of the experimental outcomes: effectiveness over other processes,"3.5 Importance of the experimental outcomes: effectiveness over other processes This research has reported the novel method of simultaneous removal of 5-HMF and H2 energy carrier production using H-IC system. In conventional approaches, detoxification and fermentation were carried out separately. The H-IC system showed efficient 5-HMF removal and H2 production performance in a single unit even after reusing the hybrid immobilized cells for more than 10 times [4]. Table 5 provides the information about various hydrolysates and their inhibitor removal efficiencies using activated carbon. From Table 5 it is shown that the 5-HMF removal efficiency varying from 45% to 100% depends on HMF concentration and the amount of activated carbon used. Lee et al. [37] showed that the addition of activated carbon was able to remove 96% of 5-HMF from the pretreated hardwood hydrolysate and further fermentation condition could enhance the ethanol productivity over 100% from the untreated hydrolysate. Park et al. [2] also observed a similar phenomenon during hydrogen fermentation from dilute acid-pretreated G. amansii hydrolysate and it showed that hydrogen production was inhibited completely with the non-detoxified hydrolysate, while the activated carbon-detoxified hydrolysate showed a remarkable improvement in hydrogen production. According to the results obtained in this study, hybrid immobilized beads possess superior performance in both 5-HMF removal and hydrogen production. Additionally, immobilized cells could possess a good carrier for the bacterial attachment and the activated carbon helps in the removal of toxic substances by adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the main advantages of this process over other conventional or reported processes are the dual benefit as inhibitor removal and H2 production in a single step fermentation–detoxification process. Continuation of this work in the future can be either directed to the application of this dual-process for the treatment of toxic wastewaters to harness the energy recovery and manage the waste disposal issues during biological fermentation."
14,Conclusions,"• This study demonstrated that 5-HMF present in the pretreated algal hydrolysate (AH) positively influenced the production and also removal rate using the hybrid immobilized cells (H-IC). • Under batch experiments, peak hydrogen production (223mL) was observed at the AH content of 50% (v/v) which contained 1.6g/L of 5-HMF and this concentration is suggested for the continuous ASBR operation. • Stable ASBR operation proved the efficiency and scaling up of this innovative system. • High butyrate production was attributed towards higher H2 production performances."
