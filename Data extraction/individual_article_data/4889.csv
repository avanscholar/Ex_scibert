0,Introduction,"Considering the critical environmental situation in the world and the possible exhaustion of the fossil fuels within decades, it will be necessary to find modes of energy production that decrease the atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuels to a low level and yet permit the economic growth of a country and a good quality of life for its population. Among possible alternative sources of energy, hydrogen stands out as potentially a very attractive source of energy, since its combustion produces only water and energy, which in principle do not pollute, and it can be produced from renewable materials. As a feedstock for the production of hydrogen, alcohols are very promising candidates because they are readily decomposed in the presence of water, to generate a hydrogen-rich mixture at a relatively low temperature. The steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) is of particular interest because ethanol, obtained by the fermentation of biomass, has advantages from the environmental point of view. In the SRE (Reaction (1)), the alcohol reacts with steam, generating CO and H2. The water–gas shift reaction (WGSR, Reaction (2)) occurs simultaneously. (1) C2H5OH+H2O⇆2CO+4H2 (2) CO+H2O⇆CO2 +H2 Hence, the overall reaction for hydrogen production from ethanol leads to the formation of 6mole H2 per mole of converted ethanol (Reaction (3)): (3) C2H5OH+3 H2O⇆2CO2 +6H2 As steam reforming is an endothermic reaction, it is necessary to supply energy to the system. Another method for producing H2 from hydrocarbons or alcohols, oxidative steam reforming (OSR) (also called autothermal reforming) is a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation (POX) and warrants consideration as it is a combination of the endothermic SRE and the exothermic POX of ethanol [1]. The nature of the metal catalyst directly influences the activity of both the decomposition and steam reforming reactions and, consequently, the production of hydrogen. Several metals have been studied in the steam reforming of ethanol, such as Ni, Co, Pt and Rh. Co and Ni have the advantage of their lower cost for application as catalysts, compared to noble metals, combined with good performance [2]. The first and important works concerning Co catalyst for SRE have been published by Haga et al. [3–5]. Catalysts of Ti, Zr, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sb, Ru, Pt and Rh supported on Al2O3 were evaluated considering the activity and selectivity of these metals in the steam reforming of ethanol (water/ethanol=4) at 400°C, at atmospheric pressure [3]. The authors noted an increase of ethanol conversion with the increase of temperature, reaching 100% at 400°C. Cobalt catalyst showed, besides the high ethanol conversion, a higher selectivity to total oxidation (CO+CO2). The authors, in another work [4], have been studied the relation between the particle size of the catalyst and its catalytic properties. The variation of the mean crystallite size in Co/Al2O3 was obtained from the use of different cobalt salts as a source of metal (nitrate, chloride, acetate, and a carbonyl compound). Selectivity increased with increasing the degree of dispersion of the metal on the Al2O3. In another study [5], Haga et al. also studied the effect of the support (Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, ZrO2 and carbon) in the SRE on cobalt catalysts. It was observed that Co/Al2O3 had the highest selectivity for the reforming of ethanol, suppressing methane production via decomposition of ethanol and methanation of CO produced (CO+3H2 →CH4 +H2O). The SRE on Co/SiO2, Co/MgO and Co/ZrO2 was followed by methanation, while the CO/carbon, methane was produced by ethanol decomposition. The catalytic activity of cobalt in both the SRE (Reaction (1)) and the WGSR (Reaction (2)), has been studied by our group [6,7], using several oxide materials, such as γ-Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, to support cobalt in the SRE. Batista et al. [7] studied the SRE reaction with Co catalysts supported on Al2O3 and SiO2 at 400°C and found a high conversion of ethanol and small formation of liquid products on catalysts with high cobalt content. After the reforming of ethanol, the CO produced reacted with H2O (shift reaction) or H2 (methanation), showing a high conversion rate. The authors also observed that the Co/Al2O3 catalyst was more effective for CO conversion. The first of these supports (γ-Al2O3) is much used in metal catalysts, owing to its high specific surface area and low cost [8]. On the other hand, CeO2 has been attracting a lot of attention for its redox properties [9–13]. We have studied Co catalysts supported on CeO2–ZrO2 solid solutions for the production of hydrogen by the steam (SRE) and oxidative (ORE) reforming of ethanol [14,15]. It was observed in these experiments that ethanol conversion and H2 selectivity were temperature dependent and that the mixing of CeO2 with ZrO2 in the support led to a low formation of CO, owing to the higher mobility of oxygen in the solid solution formed, while addition of oxygen improved the oxidative properties of the reactive systems, enhancing CO2 formation. The great disadvantage of pure CeO2 is its small surface area. Therefore, the combination of CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 could lead to the development of support materials that possess interesting mixtures of the properties of these two supports and their application in steam and oxidative reforming reactions. Thus, in view of the advantages of using cobalt as the catalyst and the potential advantages of CeO2-γ-Al2O3 supports, it was decided to investigate the activity of the catalysts Co/CeO2, Co/γ-Al2O3 and Co/CeO2-γ-Al2O3 in the steam and oxidative reforming of ethanol."
1,Material and methods,
2,Catalyst preparation,"2.1 Catalyst preparation The γ-Al2O3 support (Alfa Aesar) was heated at 500°C for 3h under a flow of synthetic air, with the aim of removing the surface water and promoting thermal stabilization. The CeO2 support was prepared by the calcination of cerium nitrate hexahydrate, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar), at 500°C for 3h under flowing synthetic air. The CeO2-γ-Al2O3 support was prepared by impregnation of the γ-Al2O3 support with an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, to give a final content of 20wt.% CeO2, and then dried at 60°C for 24h and finally calcined at 500°C for 3h. Catalysts were prepared with 20wt.% Co, by impregnation of the supports with cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) (Alfa Aesar). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 60°C for 24h and finally calcined at 600°C for 3h. Hence forward, the supports γ-Al2O3, CeO2 and 20%CeO2-γ-Al2O3, will be named Al, Ce and CeAl, respectively. The catalysts of 20%Co/γ-Al2O3, 20%Co/CeO2 and 20%Co/20%CeO2-γ-Al2O3, will thus be named CoAl, CoCe and CoCeAl, respectively."
3,Characterization,"2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (TPR-H2) TPR analyses were performed in a fixed-bed quartz U-shape tube reactor under a flow of 1.96% H2 in argon (30mL·min−1), at a heating rate of 10°C/min from 25 to 1000°C. The outlet gas was analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) XRD powder patterns were collected on a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer, with Cu-Kα radiation. The Bragg angle (2θ) was scanned between 5° and 80° at 2omin−1. The mean cobalt oxide particle diameter, dCo3O4, was estimated by Scherrer's equation (Eq. (4)) [16,17], from the most intense peak of the Co3O4 phase (2θ=36.94°). The mean diameter of metallic particles of cobalt (dCo0) was then calculated from dCo3O4 by means of Eq. (5) [16,17]. The dispersion (D) of metallic cobalt was calculated from the average particle size, assuming spherical metal particles, with a density of surface sites of 14.6atoms·nm−2, by means of Eq. (6) [16,17]: (4) L = 0.9 λ βcosθ where L or dCo3O4 is the mean crystallite size (nm), β is the line width at half the maximum intensity in radians, λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation (nm) and θ is half the Bragg angle. (5) dCo 0 = 0.75 ⋅ dCo 3 O 4 (6) D = 96 / dCo 0 2.2.3 N2-physisorption The specific surface area was estimated with a Quantachrome Nova 2.0 analyzer, by applying B.E.T. theory to the recorded adsorption isotherm. 2.2.4 Diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy in the ultra-violet near visible (DRS-UV–Vis) The DRS analyses were performed in a Varian Cary 5G UV–Vis NIR Spectrophotometer with a diffuse reflectance attachment. For DRS analysis, the samples were diluted with barium sulfate, in the proportion 1:1 by weight. 2.2.5 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Used catalysts were examined by SEM to analyse their surfaces and the carbon formed there on. Micrographs were taken on a LEO-440 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford detector. 2.2.6 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) EDX analysis of spent catalysts was performed on a Link Analytical Isis System Series 300 microanalyzer, with a SiLi detector (resolution 133eV to 5.9keV) coupled to a Zeiss LEO 440 electron microscope (Cambridge, England). 2.2.7 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) TPO experiments were performed in a Mettler Toledo Instruments TGA analyzer (TGA/DSC1), in order to estimate the amount of carbon formed on the catalyst. Approximately 10mg of spent catalyst was heated in a stream of air from room temperature to 800°C, at a rate of 10°C/min, and the weight change was measured."
4,Catalyst tests,"2.3 Catalyst tests Before each test, a fixed-bed quartz reactor tube was charged with 150mg of a catalyst, which was first activated with pure H2 flowing at 30mL·min−1, at 650°C. The catalyst was then tested with a feed of ethanol/water/O2, in mole fractions of 1:3:0 for the steam reforming reaction, at 400, 500 or 600°C, or 1:3:0.20 for oxidative reforming, at 500°C. A high-precision pump was used to obtain a total feed flow of 2.5mL·h−1. The gaseous products of each reaction were analyzed with an in-line gas chromatograph (Varian GC-3800) downstream of the reactor, with two columns connected in parallel, respectively packed with Porapak-N and 13× Molecular Sieve, with carrier gases He and N2, flowing at 10mL·min−1, operating between 40°C and 80°C and equipped with TCDs. The liquid products were condensed at 0°C at the reactor outlet and analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard) with H2 as the carrier gas, using a free fatty acid phase (HP-FFAP) capillary column, operating between 35°C and 150°C. The conversion of the ethanol and selectivity for products were calculated from Eqs. (7) and (8): (7) X ethanol = n total − n residual n total × 100 (8) S i − n i produced n converted , where n=moles of ethanol, ni =moles of product i."
5,Results and discussion,
6,X-ray diffraction (XRD),"3.1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) Figs. 1 and 2 show the diffractograms of supports and catalysts, respectively. The samples containing pure γ-Al2O3 and CeO2 produced characteristic peaks of the respective oxides. The support Al had diffraction peaks centered at 2θ=37.01°, 39.3°, 45.91°, 60.58° and 66.94° (PDF 82–1468) [18]. These broad peaks were of low intensity, indicating the low crystallinity of the support. The sharp diffraction peaks of the support Ce were centered at 2θ=28.6°, 33.11°, 47.64°, 56.47°, 59.30°, 69.50°, 76.86° and 79.10° (PDF 81–0792), characterizing this support as a crystalline oxide, with a cubic fluorite structure. The diffractogram of the mixed support CeAl showed all the diffraction peaks of the isolated oxides, but at lower intensity, implying that the crystal structures of the two oxides did not suffer significant alterations and did not form a single phase, but a mixture of the two phases. In the diffractograms of the catalysts (Fig. 2), cobalt phase diffraction peaks are seen at 2θ=31.29°, 36.94°, 44.97°, 55.91°, 59.32° and 65.43°, corresponding to the Co3O4 spinel structure (PDF 74–2120) [18]. In the diffractograms of the CoAl and CoCeAl catalysts the peaks at 2θ=31.29°; 36.94° and 65.43° are more intense than in the CoCe catalyst, perhaps because of the formation of a small amount of CoAl2O4 (JCPDS 82–2244), given that, at this calcination temperature, the non-stoichiometric cobalt aluminate, CoO-γ-Al2O3, can be formed [19]."
7,Temperature programmed reduction with H2 (TPR-H2),"3.2 Temperature programmed reduction with H2 (TPR-H2) The TPR profiles of the supports are shown in Fig. 3 . It is seen that (a) support Al did not suffer reduction in the temperature interval used, while (b) support Ce was reduced at two temperatures, around 480°C and 565°C, representing the reduction of CeO2 surface oxygen (O2− or O− anions) and the formation of non-stoichiometric cerium oxides, CeyOx [20], and, at a higher temperature, around 960°C, exhibited the reduction of bulk ceria by elimination of O2− anions from within the lattice, to form Ce2O3 (Reaction (9)). (9) 2CeO2 +H2 →Ce2O3 +H2O The TPR profile of CeAl (c) showed three reduction peaks [21]. The peak centered at 460°C corresponded to the reduction of oxygen species on the surface of the CeO2, which was highly dispersed over the γ-Al2O3. The second peak, at 625°C, corresponded to the reduction of CeO2 species very highly dispersed over the support Al, leading to the formation of a CeAlO3 phase [22]. The third peak, at approximately 930°C, corresponds to the removal of oxygen from the bulk of the material, as in (b). Fig. 4 presents the TPR profiles of the catalysts. In curve (a) (CoAl), there are two peaks, one in the region of 580°C and another at 750°C. These peaks do not correspond to the direct reduction of the Co3O4 phase to Co0, because this occurs between 300°C and 450°C, nor to reduction of CoAl2O4, which happens around 800°C [23]. Although there have been several previous studies involving TPR of CoAl, there is still controversy about the assignment of the reduction peaks of this catalyst. Xiong et al. [24] affirmed that the peak near 580°C corresponds to the reduction of highly dispersed Co3O4. Meng et al. [25] suggested that this peak be attributed to the two steps of reduction of large particles of Co3O4 to Co0, via CoO, while other authors [26] have attributed it to the step from Co3O4 to CoO, though a fraction of the peak could be related to the reduction of bulk CoO to Co0. The peak near 750°C corresponds to the reduction of CoO–Al2O3 (non-stoichiometric aluminate). Part of the Co3O4 decomposes to CoO and Co2+ ions then diffuse into the γAl2O3 lattice to form a cobalt aluminate spinel structure [27,28]. The Al3+ ions polarize the CoO bond, increasing the effective energy of Co2+ ions and, consequently, the lattice energy, resulting in an increase in the oxide reduction temperature [19]. In the TPR profile of catalyst CoCe (curve (b)), there are four reduction peaks. The peaks between 400°C and 570°C correspond to the reduction of cobalt species and Ce support on the surface. The reduction of Co3O4 on the Ce support occurs in two steps: Co3O4 →CoO→Co0 [29]. Thus, the first reduction peak, near 400°C, corresponds to the first step [25] and the second peak, near 500°C, to the reduction of CoO to the metal. The third peak, also assigned to cobalt reduction, may be due to cobalt oxide species that interact strongly with the Ce support, or to surface Ce reduction. The fourth peak, near 930°C, represents the reduction of the Ce in the bulk of the support, by the removal of O2− anions from the lattice, forming Ce2O3. The TPR profile of CoCeAl (curve (c)) also has four reduction peaks. Again, the peaks at lower temperatures correspond to reduction of the cobalt species and support, where overlap of the reduction peaks occurs. The first peak, near 385°C, is assigned to Co3O4 crystallite reduction. The peaks between 560°C and 725°C refer to reduction of Co2+ species with various degrees of interaction with the support. The peak at 725°C also refers to the reduction of highly dispersed Ce species on γ-Al2O3, to form the CeAlO3 phase [22]. The fourth peak (near 940°C) corresponds to the removal of oxygen from bulk CeO2. It may be noted that the TPR profiles of CoCe and CoCeAl show the reduction of similar species, but that these species are not distributed similarly. Thus, in the CoCeAl catalyst, there is stronger interaction of the cobalt oxide phases with the mixed support, observed in the higher reduction temperatures of these oxides."
8,Structural characteristics of supports and catalysts,"3.3 Structural characteristics of supports and catalysts Table 1 shows the structural characteristics of the supports and catalysts revealed by N2-physisorption, TPR and XRD. The results show that the Ce support had a much lower specific surface area (43.5m2/g) than the rather high area of the Al support (220.0m2/g). The area of each of the three supports falls by approximately 50% when the metallic phase is added. The addition of 20% CeO2 to γ-Al2O3 also led to an area reduction of about 40%. This is due to partial obstruction of the narrow pores in γ-Al2O3 by CeO2 in the CeAl support and the obstruction of pores in all the supports by the cobalt. The size of the cobalt oxide particles and, consequently, the mean diameter of Co metal particles and the dispersion of cobalt, varied among the various supports. These values are related to the surface areas of the supports and catalysts; supports with large areas, such as Al and CeAl, led to smaller catalyst particles and promoted better dispersion. Conversely, support Ce, with a small area, led to the formation of larger particles. This may explain the higher reducibility of the CoCe catalyst, as the larger particles interact less with the support. The reducibility calculated from the TPR analysis showed that most of the cobalt oxide in the catalysts was reduced to Co0. The cobalt oxide phase reduction appears to be related to surface area, since CoAl and CoCeAl, with larger surface areas, showed a similar percent reducibility of around 65%, while the cobalt oxide of the catalyst CoCe, which had a small surface area, was reduced almost totally."
9,Diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy in the ultra-violet visible region (DRS UV–Vis),"3.4 Diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy in the ultra-violet visible region (DRS UV–Vis) Figs. 5 and 6 present the DRS UV–Vis spectra of supports and catalysts, respectively. The Al support spectrum has a weak band at 270nm. The Ce support produced three characteristic absorption bands, at 236, 280 and 306nm. The bands at 236 and 280nm are assigned to the low coordination charge transfers of Ce3+ ←O2− and Ce4+ ←O2−, respectively, and the band at the higher wavelength, 306nm, to the interband transition of CeO2 [30]. In the spectrum of the CeAl support, the CeO2 bands are present without undergoing any shifts but at lower intensity. The DRS UV–Vis spectra of the catalysts (Fig. 6) show the same band patterns as their supports, with the bands located at the same wavelengths, though there is a small decrease in the intensities of the bands, relative to the support spectra, probably due to the addition of cobalt. The vertical dotted lines at 450 and 750nm indicate bands assigned to the absorption of cobalt [31–34]. It is observed that these bands become more intense as the surface area of the catalyst rises. These bands were assigned to the presence of Co3O4 [35] and demonstrate the formation of the Co3O4 spinel structure (Co2+Co2 3+O4), which contains both Co(II) and Co(III), tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, respectively [36]."
10,Steam and oxidative reforming of ethanol (SRE and ORE),"3.5 Steam and oxidative reforming of ethanol (SRE and ORE) Table 2 presents the ethanol conversion results in the reactions under study. A high rate of conversion can be seen under all the reaction conditions studied, all catalysts achieving around 90% conversion. Fig. 7 compares the H2 selectivity on the three catalysts at three temperatures. The selectivity for H2 on cobalt catalysts is seen to depend on the support and the temperature of reaction. CoAl and CoCeAl, with higher surface areas, produced more hydrogen than CoCe, at 500 and 600°C. This suggests that selectivity may increase with finer cobalt dispersion on the support and thus with smaller crystallites. Another important factor is the combination of CeO2 and γ-Al2O3, which leads to greater selectivity than catalysts supported on the pure oxide supports, probably due to a synergistic effect. Fig. 8 and Table 3 show the time profile and mean selectivity for the gaseous products formed on the CoAl catalyst in the SRE and ORE. Note that, in the SRE at 400°C, the catalyst is rapidly deactivated in 3h of reaction. This deactivation can be attributed to oxidation of cobalt metal sites and subsequent carbon formation [2,6]. Cobalt oxidation leads to carbon formation on catalysts supported on acidic oxides, such as γ-Al2O3, because the active sites for the reforming reaction are the metal. With the oxidation of the metallic phase, these sites become inactive and only the acid sites of the support remain active, promoting the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene (C2H4), by Reaction (10). This reaction is highly undesirable, because, besides reducing the selectivity for H2, it also favors the formation of carbon, via polymerization of the ethylene [37]. (10) CH3CH2OH→H2C=CH2 +H2O Increasing the temperature decreases the catalyst deactivation and increases the selectivity for H2 and CO2, but ethylene production is higher in the reaction at 500°C. The carbon formation in this case may be related to CH4, which is formed by ethanol decomposition and then decomposed to carbon. Comparing the reactions conducted at 500 and 600°C, there is a large difference in selectivity for CO, much more being produced at the higher temperature. The cobalt catalyst actively catalyzes the WGSR (Reaction (2)), in which the CO formed during SRE is converted to CO2 and H2. This reaction is reversible and its equilibrium is shifted to the left at high temperatures, limiting the conversion of CO to CO2, as observed here in the reaction at 600°C. In the ORE, CoAl catalyst showed more selectivity for H2 and this increase was accompanied by small increases in CO and CO2. Reactions that can occur under these conditions are the steam reforming of ethanol, direct decomposition of ethanol, the WGSR (Reactions (1), (11) and (2), respectively) and the partial oxidation of ethanol [21]. (11) C2H5OH→CO+CH4 +H2 Fig. 9 and Table 4 show the selectivity for the gaseous products formed on the CoCe catalyst during the SRE and ORE. Catalysts supported on CeO2 have been discussed widely in terms of the redox couple Ce3+/Ce4+, which participates in several reactions, including the oxidative [14,15] and shift reactions during steam reforming [38]. As can be seen again, an increase in temperature led to an increase in the selectivity for H2 and CO2. It can also be seen that CH4 formation rises with temperature, on CoCe as on CoAl. This CH4 formation may be due to direct decomposition of ethanol to CO, CH4 and H2 (Reaction (6)) or to CO2 and CH4 (Reaction (12)) [37]. (12) C2H5OH→1/2CO2 +3/2CH4 It can be observed that this catalyst has low selectivity for C2H4 at all three temperatures, compared to CoAl. The low formation of one-carbon gaseous products (CH4, CO and CO2) at the lowest temperature of reaction (400°C) may be explained by the low capacity of cobalt to break the CC bond in the ethanol molecule, leading to greater quantities of products with more than one carbon in the liquid products, such as acetone and ethyl acetate [38]. Again, on the Co/Ce catalyst, the formation of CO increases as the temperature is raised to 600°C. In the reaction at 500°C, the CO2/CO ratio was much higher than in those at the temperatures 400°C and 600°C The activity of CeO2 in the oxidation reactions, added to the cobalt activity for the WGSR, leads to a CO2/CO ratio of 8 at 500°C, higher than that on CoAl (CO2/CO=6) at the same temperature. Increasing the oxygen in the feed on the Co/Ce catalyst had almost no effect on selectivity for CH4 and CO. However, the presence of more oxygen led to a fall in selectivity for H2 and CO2, in contrast to the results with CoAl. The results of reaction on the catalyst Co/CeAl are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 5 . The combination of CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 led to good H2 selectivity (4.11 moles H2 per mole of ethanol converted at 600°C in the SRE); theoretically, the overall reaction of steam reforming, Reaction (3), can form up to 6moles of H2. The mean selectivity for H2 on CoCeAl at 500°C and 600°C was higher than that on CoAl and CoCe. On this catalyst, the selectivity for CH4 was also the highest and this may be due to this catalyst promoting decomposition reactions (Reactions (12) and (13)). CoCeAl also resulted in a higher CO2/CO ratio at 500°C than at 400°C or 600°C. In these reactions, it is seen that the selectivity for the products of the SRE are related to surface area and to crystallite size, since higher H2 selectivity was obtained on the catalysts with higher surface area (CoAl and CoCeAl), leading to better dispersion of the active phase. Moreover, these catalysts had smaller crystallites, according to the XRD analyses, and consequently better selectivity [38]. Fig. 11 compares the molar ratio CO2/CO produced on the three catalysts under the various conditions used to study the SRE and ORE. It is observed that all the catalysts produced lowest molar ratios CO2/CO at 600°C. This may be explained by the high temperature favoring the reverse WGSR and thus limiting the complete conversion to CO2. It is evident that the best temperature to achieve a high CO2/CO ratio is 500°C, on all catalysts. The catalysts supported on Ce and CeAl showed higher CO2/CO ratios in the SRE at 500°C. This fact is attributable not only to the cobalt activity in the shift reaction but also to CeO2 activity in the oxidation reactions. CO can be oxidized to CO2 on the surface of the support, by oxygen adsorbed on the surface, followed by CeO2 reoxidation (Ce3+ to Ce4+). The latter process occurs simultaneously to the oxidation of CO to CO2 [39]. The ORE conditions were not effective in increasing the CO2 selectivity relative to CO formation. The CO2/CO ratio was higher on all three catalysts when the reaction was SRE. This occurred because oxidative reforming on these catalysts is accompanied by the partial oxidation of CH4 to CO; moreover, in this case, the water–gas shift reaction, which could convert this CO to CO2, proceeds very slowly, limiting the formation of CO2 and thus decreasing the CO2/CO ratio in oxidative reforming. During the reactions of steam and oxidative reforming of ethanol, liquid products derived from ethanol were formed, such as acetaldehyde, ethyl ether, acetone, ethyl acetate and acetic acid. Most of these products occurred as traces in the SRE reaction but were formed in larger amounts during the oxidative reforming of ethanol (Table 2). Among the liquid products formed, acetaldehyde was the only one measured. This product was identified on the Co/Ce and CoCeAl catalysts in the SRE. Its formation may thus involve the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple, the oxygen adsorbed on the support participating in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (Reaction (13)). In the ORE, apart from the oxygen on the support, the oxygen in the reaction feed also favors the formation of this liquid. Other products were observed, only in the oxidative reforming of ethanol reaction, such as butanal, methylpropanone, 2-pentanone, crotonaldehyde, butanol and 2-heptanone. (13) CH3CH2OH+1/2O2 →CH3CHO+H2O"
11,Post-reaction characterization,"3.6 Post-reaction characterization A known characteristic of cobalt catalysts is the formation of carbon on the catalyst during the SRE and ORE [2,6,14,15]. On the catalysts studied here, there was appreciable carbon deposition, which varied with the temperature in the SRE, the addition of oxygen in the ORE and the composition of the catalyst. There are five main reactions that may contribute to carbon formation [2]: (14) C2H4 →(C2H4)n →coke (15) 2CO→CO2 +C (16) CO+H2 →H2O+C (17) CH4 →2H2 +C (18) C2H4 →2C+2H2. Ethylene polymerization (Reaction (14)) occurs after its formation by ethanol dehydration (Reaction (10)) on acidic supports (e.g., γ-Al2O3). At low reaction temperatures, carbon may then be formed by decomposition of the polyethylene (Reaction (14)), as well as by disproportionation of CO (Boudouard reaction, Reaction (15)) and reverse carbon gasification (Reaction (16)). However, Reactions (17) and (18) (methane and ethylene decomposition) are the main routes for carbon formation at high temperature [2,40]. In the case of ORE, carbon formation was decreased by the addition of oxygen, which tended to oxidize the carbon deposited on the catalyst, by Reactions (19) and (20). (19) C+O2 ⇆CO2 (20) 2C+O2 ⇆2CO The mass of carbon deposited on samples used in SRE (at 400°C and 500°C) and ORE was estimated by TGA–TPO and is shown in Table 6 and Figs. 12 and 13 . Fig. 12 shows the mass loss for each catalyst; it is observed that the mass loss in the SRE at 400°C was the highest for CoAl, while in the ORE, CoCe and CoCeAl showed higher mass losses. Table 6 shows total carbon formation (mmol C/h) in SRE and ORE, on catalysts CoAl, CoCe and CoCeAl. On CoAl and CoCeAl, carbon formation, decreased linearly with both temperature increase and addition of oxygen. On CoCe, this behavior was not observed, and some factors may explain this. At low temperature, the carbon formation was lower, and this was accompanied by lower formation of gaseous products, demonstrating that activity on this catalyst at 400°C was lower than on CoAl and CoCeAl. This may be related to the lower surface area of CoCe and consequently to its lower metal dispersion. CoCeAl catalyst behaved similarly to CoAl at low temperature, with a higher carbon formation due to cobalt oxidation promoting the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene (C2H4), by Reaction (5). In the SRE and ORE at 500°C, CoCe showed a similar behavior. The added oxygen promoted higher carbon formation, which may be explained by the fact that the CeO2 support interacts less with the metallic phase, so that a part of the cobalt may have been oxidized more readily by this oxygen. Studies of the formation of carbon on Ni and Co-based catalysts during the SRE and ORE are scarce and the mechanism is not well understood. Kitiyanan et al. [41] used TPO analysis to characterize the types of carbonaceous species present on Co-based catalysts used in the production of carbon nanotubes. According to the authors, the oxidation peak located below 400°C can be ascribed to amorphous carbon and that above 500°C to carbon nanotubes. The oxidation of graphite occurs at higher temperatures. The type of carbon formed depends on the reaction conditions, reaction temperature, nature of the metal phase, catalyst composition and morphology [2,40–42]. Fig. 13 shows TGA–TPO profiles, based in the derivative of the mass loss during the oxidation of carbon formed. Typically, there are two different oxidation regions, which may reflect the presence of two different types of carbonaceous deposit on the surface of the catalyst: amorphous carbon (low temperature of oxidation peak) and filamentous carbon (high temperature of oxidation peak) [40,42]. The oxidation profile depended on the reaction temperature, presence of oxygen in the reactant feed and the composition of the support. On the basis of TPO peak assignments from the literature, our TPO profiles indicated the presence of amorphous carbon and filamentous carbon on all catalysts after the SRE and ORE reactions. In addition, a higher fraction of graphite filaments was formed by the ORE. CoAl and CoCeAl produced a small oxidation peak centered at around 330°C, which is ascribed to amorphous carbon [43]. Amorphous carbon was observed on CoCe, between 435 and 475°C, depending on the reaction conditions. At a higher temperature, for all catalysts, there was a peak that may be assigned to the oxidation of filamentous graphite or polymorphic forms of graphite. Used CoCe and CoCeAl also show another peak, around 527°C, within a wide TPO profile, suggesting the presence of stable carbon deposits. The presence of larger amounts of filamentous carbon on CoAl may explain the fast deactivation observed for this catalyst at 400°C. This species of carbon can be deposited on metal particles or, according to the deactivation mechanism proposed by Trimm [44] for Ni catalysts, the carbon filament formation may lead to loss of the active phase, which happens on the breakup of the filaments. On the other hand, the fraction of amorphous carbon appears to be highest on CoCe, at low temperature. This result is corroborated by Lima et al. [40], who observed that in some regions on Co/CeO2 catalysts, only amorphous carbon was found in proximity to ceria aggregates. This carbonaceous species does not lead to catalyst deactivation, suggesting that the addition of CeO2 to the Al2O3 support may improve its catalytic performance. The formation of carbonaceous deposits on used CoCeAl was also observed by SEM analysis. Fig. 14 shows SEM micrographs for the CoCeAl sample after SRE (Fig. 14a) and ORE (Fig. 14b), at 500°C. SEM images have revealed that the solid carbon product consists of nanofibres on the particles of the catalyst [45]. Fig. 14a (SRE) shows carbon filaments with smaller diameters than those observed on the same catalyst in Fig. 14b (ORE). Although the carbon filaments are more evident in Fig. 14b, the EDX analysis shows a greater amount of carbon on the CoCeAl catalyst in SRE. Besides, the carbon coating prevents the detection of Co, as the percentage of elemental cobalt detected in this analysis was 9.63% after SRE and 13.25% after ORE. Thus, in both reactions, an important fraction of Co surface is blocked with carbon filaments or polymorphic forms of graphite that should be responsible for the discontinuation of the catalytic activity [42,46]."
12,Conclusions,"In a study of cobalt catalysts supported on oxides of Al, Ce and CeAl, it was confirmed by TPR and XRD analyses that the oxide phase Co3O4 was formed in all three catalysts. Besides this phase, in the catalysts CoAl and CoCeAl, a cobalt oxide interacting more strongly with the support was observed, CoO–Al2O3 (non-stoichiometric cobalt aluminate). In the catalytic tests for SRE and ORE, the selectivity for products in the SRE reaction was related to the surface area and the crystallite size. Higher selectivity for H2 was observed on CoAl and CoCeAl, which exhibited greater surface areas, than on CoCe, since the larger area led to greater dispersion of the active phase. Catalysts CoCe and CoCeAl promoted high CO2/CO ratios, owing to the activity of cobalt in the water–gas shift reaction and the activity of CeO2 in the oxidation reaction. The addition of O2 (ORE reaction) favored H2 formation for all catalysts. However, it only contributed to the oxidation of carbon when this was deposited on CoAl and CoCeAl. Conversely, for CoCe, oxygen addition promoted higher carbon formation, given that the CeO2 support showed less interaction with the metallic phase and thus a part of the active cobalt phase may be oxidized by the added oxygen."
