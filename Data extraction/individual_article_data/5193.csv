0,Introduction,"Solar H2 production from semiconductor-based photocatalytic water splitting has become a promising way to convert solar energy into green renewable chemical energy since the discovery of Honda and Fujishima in 1972 [1]. Over the past 40 years, a wide variety of semiconductor-based materials have been used for H2 production, consisting of semiconducting oxides, sulfides, oxynitrides, and so on [2–7]. Transition metal tungsten oxide based compounds fused of WO3 and other metal oxides show high activity for the photocatalytic hydrogen production under UV-light via water splitting [8–10]. One capable example is CsTaWO6, which was reported to be photocatalytically active under UV light (E g =3.8eV and 3.6eV) [11–15]. This semiconductor photocatalyst with a defect-pyrochlore structure can generate hydrogen from aqueous alcohol without any cocatalyst under solar irradiation [8]. In order to achieve the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency under visible light, shifting the CB and VB of the photocatalyst is a common way [12,16–18]. However, extending the light absorption of CsTaWO6 alone could not guarantee to promote the photocatalytic activity. As is known to all, photocatalytic efficiency depends on the utilization of photon-generated carriers and the photocatalytic process is valid only when interact with electron acceptor or donor. So the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs as a vital factor in photocatalysis process must be considered as well as the extending of the light absorption for the catalyst [19,20]. Number of researches attempts to increase the photocatalytic activity by the ways including chemical modification, surface sensitization and coupling with other noble metals or semiconductor materials [21–24]. In recent years, many studies have revealed that the modifying with noble metal nanoparticles is one of the effective attempts that dedicated to growing the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor [25–28]. Noble metal loaded on photocatalyst can facilitate separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and transfer the electrons across a low resistance pathway at the interfacial region that in turn rises the surface reactivity [24,29,30]. Meanwhile, noble metal nanoparticles can harvest visible light by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and is therefore utilized to design efficient and powerful visible-light-driven plasmonic photocatalysts [31]. In addition, Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an analog of graphite photocatalysis material with a band gap of 2.7eV has attracted widespread interest for many applications in the photocatalysis field: water splitting [32–35], reduction of CO2 [36], production of H2O2 [37], degradation organic pollutant [38,39] and reduction of nitrophenol [40]. These are all owing to its being a nontoxic metal-free semiconductor that possesses high thermal and chemical stability and visible light response. We propose that CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst, if properly prepared, could show an enhanced photocatalytic activity on water splitting, due to the advantages of g-C3N4 and Au. Herein, the heterostructured CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 composite was successfully prepared and the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the composite compared with pure g-C3N4 or CsTaWO6 under simulated sunlight irradiation was investigated. Moreover, the stability and the possible photocatalysis mechanism of the composite were also discussed."
1,Experimental,
2,Synthesis of CsTaWO6 photocatalyst,"2.1 Synthesis of CsTaWO6 photocatalyst CsTaWO6 was prepared by calcining stoichiometric mixtures of Cs2CO3, WO3 and Ta2O5 powders. Firstly, 0.204g Ta2O5, 0.0.105g WO3 and 0.155g Cs2CO3 were mixed using 10mL ethanol in agate mortar for 2h. About 5% excess of Cs2CO3 was used to compensate for the loss of the reagent at high temperature. After drying at 60°C for 6h, the mixture was heated from room temperature to 900°C for 24h with a heating rate of 10°C/min."
3,Preparation of g-C3N4,2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 About 10g thiourea was sintered at 550°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min under Air atmosphere for 2h to prepare the g-C3N4 sheets. The yellow product was pulverized by mortar and pestle. 1.0g of the as-prepared g-C3N4 was dispersed in 200mL deionized water and flaking by supersonic for 24h. A light yellow well-dispersed g-C3N4 aqueous solution was obtained after remove the sediment by centrifugation at 8000rpm for 40min.
4,Preparation of CsTaWO6/Au composite,"2.3 Preparation of CsTaWO6/Au composite To decorate the gold particles on the surface of CsTaWO6, a photo-depositive method was applied. About 0.2g CsTaWO6 was dispersed in 50mL deionized water under supersonic. Then, the Au solution was dropped into the suspension under magnetic stirring in dark. After that, the mixture was irradiated using a 300W Xe lamp for 30min. The products were washed by water for three times to remove impurities and then dried at 60°C."
5,Preparation of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4,2.4 Preparation of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 An impregnation method was used for the further wrapping g-C3N4 on CsTaWO6/Au. 0.1g CsTaWO6/Au was soaked in 15mL of the as-prepared well-dispersed g-C3N4 aqueous solution with 15mL ethanol under magnetic stirring for 24h. Then the powder was collected by centrifuging at 8000rpm for 10min and dried at 60°C.
6,Sample characterization,"2.5 Sample characterization Phase composition of the as prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Panalytical Empyream diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation λ =1.5406Å. The morphologies were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800 with an acceleration voltage of 20.0kV), transition electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010 apparatus with an acceleration voltage of 200kV), high-resolution TEM. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using Perkin Elmer UV/VS/NIR Lambda750s spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere coated with BaSO4 at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 with Al Kα (1486.6eV) line at 150W. To compensate surface charges effect, the binding energies were calibrated using C1s peak at 284.60eV as the reference. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined from the nitrogen absorption data at liquid nitrogen temperature using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. Time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a FLSP-920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments) at room temperature. 450W Xenon arc lamp was used as a light source."
7,Photocatalytic activity experiments,"2.6 Photocatalytic activity experiments A hetero-polyaromatic dye, methyl orange (MO), was used as a probe molecule to evaluate the photocatalytic reactivity of the CsTaWO6/Au with different amounts of Au. The MO solution (20μmolL−1) with 25mg of photocatalyst powder was stirred in dark condition for 30min in order to found an adsorption/desorption balance. These suspensions were irradiated under simulated sunlight which emitted by a Xe lamp (300W). The analytical solutions were taken from the suspension and centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10min at certain time intervals. The progress of degradation of MO was analytical by measuring the UV–vis absorption spectra in a UVIKON XL/XS Spectrometer based on the Lambert–Beer law, where the absorbance at a particular wavelength is proportional to the concentration of MO."
8,Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction,"2.7 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was performed in a double-walled quartz reactor covered with a quartz plate, which connected to a closed gas evolution system. The reaction temperature was maintained at 10°C to prevent any thermal catalytic effect by a flow of cooling water from a thermostat. A 300W Xe lamp was used as a light source for irradiation across the quartz plate. The evolved gases were analyzed online using a gas chromatography (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, with nitrogen as a carrier gas and a 5Å molecular sieve column). In a typical run, 0.05g of photocatalyst powder was suspended in 80mL of pure water by supersonic, and methanol (20mL) was added as a sacrificial reagent. Before irradiation, the whole system was maintained to be steady vacuum during reaction."
9,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.8 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photocurrent experiments were performed using an Autolab model AUT302N.FRA32M.V electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode cell. 10mg of as-prepared sample was added in 2mL of isopropanol, forming a uniform suspension after 20min of ultrasonic treatment. The suspension was coated on a piece of FTO glass (1×1.5cm2) with 0.2cm2 restricted by a sticky tape, then dried at room temperature for 24h. The FTO glass, platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 300W Xe lamp (PLSSXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source. The electrolyte solution was a NaOH aqueous solution (0.2molL−1)."
10,Results and discussion,
11,Structural and morphological characteristics,"3.1 Structural and morphological characteristics The XRD patterns of all as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 1 . For CsTaWO6, all the observed diffraction peaks were well-assigned to a pure phase of CsTaWO6 (JCPDS card no. 25-0233) without any unindexed peaks. The strong peaks of CsTaWO6 with almost no broadening indicate that it has high crystallinity and large crystalline size. The lattice parameters were calculated to be a = b = c =10.375Å, which is smaller than previous reports. From the XRD pattern of g-C3N4 in Fig. 1, it is found that the peak at 2θ =13.4° and 27.4° can be assigned to the (001) and (002) crystal plane of g-C3N4. But it was found the two peaks belong to g-C3N4 do not observed for CsTaWO6/g-C3N4 and CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4. The phenomenon was assigned to the low contents of g-C3N4 in the materials and the huge difference of crystalline size for g-C3N4 and CsTaWO6. With the similar reasons the diffraction peaks of gold do not also be observed from the XRD patterns of CsTaWO6/Au and CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 in Fig. 1. Furthermore, for the composite materials, the lattice parameters almost remain the same, indicating that the crystal structure of CsTaWO6 does not get affected after combination with other materials. The surface area and the pore-size distribution of g-C3N4, CsTaWO6, CsTaWO6/g-C3N4, CsTaWO6/Au and CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 were examined by nitrogen-sorption isotherms analysis (Fig. S1). The BET surface of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 was calculated to be 14.21m3/g. The fundamentally similar profiles indicated that specific surface was not the mainly factor to the various photocatalytic performances of these samples. The microstructure information of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 was analyzed by TEM shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2a, the angular, gathered block CsTaWO6 about 100nm (Fig. S2) have been covered by a membrane-like, possible g-C3N4. No Au particles were observed in the SEM image because of the smaller size. However, three different areas are clearly observed from the TEM of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 in Fig. 2b, which respectively belong to CsTaWO6, Au and g-C3N4. It showed that some gold nanoparticles are homogeneously adhered on the surface of CsTaWO6. As seen from HRTEM images in Fig. 2c, the fringe intervals of 0.367nm are corresponding to the interplanar spacing of (200) of lattice plane of the CsTaWO6, which is closed to that calculated by XRD (0.367nm). The existence of g-C3N4 can also be observed in the HRTEM of Fig. 2c. The d spacing between adjacent lattice fringes was ca. 0.236nm, which attributed to the (111) lattice plane of Au from the HRTEM image of Fig. 2d, indicating the existence of gold particles. It is found that the Au particles were roughly spherical and uniformly distributed on the surface of CsTaWO6 with a size in the range of 1.5–4.5nm (Fig. S3). Herein, the EDS element mapping on SEM was carried out to confirm the distribution of g-C3N4 in CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4, which is shown in Fig. 3 . The EDS elemental mappings from a selected area (Fig. 3a) show that the N is evenly distributed in the materials (Fig. 3b–f). The g-C3N4 is the only source of N element, so it is concluded the g-C3N4 was uniformly attached on the surface of CsTaWO6/Au. The content of g-C3N4 in CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 was calculated to be 2.84% by thermal analysis under air atmosphere (Fig. S4). Furthermore, to get the accurate the content of g-C3N4, CHNS/O element analysis was used to estimate the contents of g-C3N4. The calculated value is about 2.05%."
12,XPS spectra of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4,"3.2 XPS spectra of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 The XPS characterization is used to further confirm the surface composition and chemical states of the as-prepared samples, which shown in Figs. 4 , S5 and S6. The Cs, Ta, W and O elements can be easily found in Fig. S5a, which is corresponded to the constituent of CsTaWO6. From Fig. S5b, one set of doublet peaks at 737.5eV and 723.8eV were assigned to the 3d spectrum of Cs+ ions. Moreover, Ta 4f (Fig. S5c) and W 4f (Fig. S5d) spectra also show the sets of doublet peaks at 27.3eV and 25.5eV, being identified to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 of Ta5+, 37.4eV and 35.3eV to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 of W6+, respectively [12]. The O 1s peaks (Fig. S5e) can be fitted into two peaks located at 531.8 and 529.8eV, which corresponded to the OH bonds of the surface-adsorbed water and [Ta/W]-O bond in CsTaWO6, respectively [13,41]. Moreover, the atomic ratio of Cs, Ta and W were calculated to be about 1:0.78:0.71, which slightly deviated from the stoichiometric ratio (1:1:1). Thus it is proposed the defects were introduced into the crystal lattice of CsTaWO6 Furthermore, was presented in. The strong peak at 284.6eV was found in the XPS spectra of g-C3N4 which was attributed to CC coordination of standard reference carbon and g-C3N4 (Fig. S6). Other two fitted peaks at 288.0eV and 286.0eV were related to the CNC and C(N)3 groups of g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. S6a) [42,43]. The N 2p peaks were fitted to three peaks located at 404.4, 401.1 and 398.6eV, respectively. They were attributed to characteristic peak of π-excitation originated from graphitic-N species, CNH and CNC coordination of g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. S6b) [44–46]. The XPS spectra of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 were presented in Fig. 4. The Cs, Ta, W, O, C, N and Au elements can be easily found in Fig. 4a, which is corresponded to the constituent of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4. The XPS spectra of Cs 3d, Ta 4f and W 4f were consistent with that of pure CsTaWO6 (Fig. 4b–d). It means that the valence states of the elements in CsTaWO6 keep unchanged after coupling with Au and g-C3N4. Obviously, it can be observed the typical peaks of Au 4f at 86.7 and 83.0eV in Fig. 4f, which belong to Au0 and the result is consistent with the other reports [47,48]. Otherwise, the strong peaks at about 285eV and 286.0eV were attributed to the C and N species of g-C3N4, respectively (Fig. 4g and h)."
13,UV–vis diffuses reflectance spectra,"3.3 UV–vis diffuses reflectance spectra The UV–vis spectra of the as-prepared samples were shown in Fig. 5a. The pure CsTaWO6 showed mainly absorption area in the range of 250–350nm, consistent with the previous reports [8]. After depositing gold nanoparticles on the surface of CsTaWO6, a new absorption band in the range of 500–600nm was observed clearly, which might be attributed to the SPR of the gold particles [47]. It is found that the Au particles were distributed on the surface of CsTaWO6 with the size of 1.5–4.5nm (Fig. S3). Thus gold particles with the larger size may be responsible to the SPR absorption. Furthermore, the coupling effect originated from the dipole–dipole interactions of the aggregated Au particles would also lead to a broad absorption band [49]. For g-C3N4, a strong absorption around 400nm was observed, confirming the ability of absorbing sunlight with a wider wavelength. For CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4, the three parts of absorption were simultaneously observed, which respectively belong to CsTaWO6, g-C3N4 and Au, indicating that CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 can utilize more solar energy to conduct photocatalysis reaction. Fig. 5b is the Tauc plots of g-C3N4 and CsTaWO6. The band gap (E g) was estimated by the Tauc formula: (1) a h ν = B ( h ν − E g ) r where r equals 2, 1/2, 2/3 or 3 for the different electronic transition modes, B is Tauc parameter and hν is the incident photon energy. The g-C3N4 was reported as a direct band-to-band transition mode [50]. The corresponding Tauc plot was graphed by (αhν)2 versus photon energy (hν). However, the CsTaWO6 has been classified as an indirect optical transition type so that the Tauc plot was graphed by (αhν)1/2 versus hν [14]. The band gap of g-C3N4 was estimated to be 2.74eV from the Tauc plots in Fig. 4b, which is close to the previously reported [50,51]. But the band gap of CsTaWO6 was calculated to be 3.30eV, smaller than previous reports (3.8eV [14] and 3.6eV [15]). The difference of crystal lattice parameters and the presence of lattice defects may responsible for the decreased band gap."
14,Photocatalytic performance,"3.4 Photocatalytic performance Because gold nanoparticles act as a very important role in photocatalysis process, we firstly optimized the amount of gold by a model reaction (MO degradation). The improvement of the photocatalytic efficiency was observed in Fig. S7, indicating that doping Au is conducive to the process of photocatalysis of MO degradation. The composite with the amount of Au 0.5% (mass fraction) exhibited the highest photocatalysis activity in MO degradation. The percentage removal of MO was increased ca. 40% by depositing 0.5% Au on CsTaWO6. It is proposed that the Au nanoparticles become a separation center in the light of the band structure of Au and CsTaWO6. The photo-generated electrons transfer to the Au particle from the conduction band of CsTaWO6 and hinder the recombination process of photo-generated electrons and holes. The two kinds of photo-generated charge carrier were proficiently separated. The longer lifetime of holes give more opportunity to take part in the photo-degradation. Hence, the deposited Au tiny particles on the surface of CsTaWO6 help to enhance the efficiency of photocatalysis. The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from water was carried out on the different photocatalysts, and the photocatalytic activities were shown in Fig. 6 . Obviously, the relatively low photocatalytic activities were observed for the pure CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4, while the photocatalytic activity does not improve significantly for CsTaWO6/g-C3N4 composite, only a little higher than the independently component. The possible reason was concluded to be the existence of resistance between the interface of CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4, which block the transfer of electrons and holes. For CsTaWO6/Au 0.5%, the efficiency was slightly increased to 1.54μmolg−1 h−1. In this composite, Au may act as a separator for photogenerated electron–hole pairs and thus contribute to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity. The phenomenon was similar with to the observation of MO degradation over CsTaWO6/Au. However, for the ternary composite of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4, the calculated average rate of hydrogen generation is 9.16μmolg−1 h−1, which was significantly higher than that of the other as prepared samples (CsTaWO6/Au is 1.54, CsTaWO6/g-C3N4 0.91, CsTaWO6 0.71, and g-C3N4 0.49μmolg−1 h−1). Obviously, the composition of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 led to the notable enhanced photocatalytic activity toward photocatalytic generation of hydrogen in comparison to their individual counterpart."
15,Photo-induced charges separation study,"3.5 Photo-induced charges separation study The transient fluorescence spectrum was applied to investigate the dynamics of photo-induced charges and the electron injection mechanism, and the results are shown in Fig. 7a. Longer charge-carrier lifetime is conducive to facilitate the reaction between photocatalyst and H2O. The emission decay data was fitted by a bi-exponential decay for all of the samples. The fast decay is a result of radiative and Auger recombination processes, which is followed by a slow decaying process for the energy-transfer mechanism. The lifetimes (τ 1 and τ 2), pre-exponential factors (α 1 and α 2), and average life time (τ) were calculated and listed in Table 1 . Obviously, the average life time of photo-induced charges in CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 is 2.00ns, which is 2.3 and 3.1 times longer that of CsTaWO6/Au and CsTaWO6. It shows that Au particles can effectively extract the charges from CsTaWO6, and help transfer charges between CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4. The long fluorescence decay time for CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 would be caused by a low concentration of radiative defects in the materials. The longer lifetimes of photo-induced charges are advantageous to photocatalytic reaction. In addition to the above analysis, the photocurrent tests provide us more impacted evidence on charges transfer and injection in this heterogeneous composite structure. Fig. 7b shows the contrast of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 CsTaWO6/Au and CsTaWO6 photocurrent under several on/off 300W Xe lamp irradiations at 0.5V. The photocurrent generation of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 is approximately twice than that that of CsTaWO6 and CsTaWO6/Au. The growth in photon-to-current generation could attribute to the broadening of light absorption region in CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 and the quickly transfer of electrons between CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4 through the gold particles, resulting in more photo-generated charges and improved separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs."
16,Recycled stability of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4,"3.6 Recycled stability of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 In order to evaluating the stability of the CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4, the extra experiment has been carried out to generate hydrogen under simulated sunlight in 4h cycled for five times (Fig. 8 ). The only a slightly decreasing amount of evolved hydrogen was observed at the fifth run (8.51μmolg−1 h−1), which indicated that the CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 has high stability during photocatalytic process."
17,Photocatalytic mechanism of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4,"3.7 Photocatalytic mechanism of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 Based on the above results, the photocatalytic mechanism of CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 is tentatively proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 9 . For CsTaWO6, the photo-generated electrons and holes were generated under irradiation of UV light that its energy greater than the band gap of CsTaWO6, which composed by the O 2p orbital and the Ta 5d orbital. The electrons and holes tend to recombine and only a fraction of them participates in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in a relative low activity. The conduction band and valence band edge potential of semiconductors used in this study can be estimated according to the empirical equations as shown below [52]: (2) E VB = x − E e + 0.5 E g (3) E CB = E VB − E g where E VB is the valence band edge potential, χ is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms, and E e is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (about 4.5eV versus NHE). According the calculation results above, the CB and VB edge potentials of CsTaWO6 are at about −0.37 and +2.93eV, while the CB and VB edge potentials of g-C3N4 are at about −1.23 and +1.52eV, respectively. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4 can be excited at same time by absorbing UV light and visible light, respectively. Because the CB of CsTaWO6 is positive than g-C3N4, the photo-generated electrons can transfer to the CB of CsTaWO6 from g-C3N4. For CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4, gold nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the surface of CsTaWO6 and act as an electron-conduction bridge to reduce the electron transmission resistance. Furthermore, the electron–holes separation in CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4 will be more efficient because of the formed Schottky barrier at the interface of Au and CsTaWO6. Meanwhile the SPR effect of Au can amplify the absorption of visible light of the photocatalysts [53]. Therefore, the above cooperative effects resulted in an enhanced photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from water."
18,Conclusion,"In summary, a novel CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 was fabricated through an easily route. The CsTaWO6/Au photocatalyst was first synthesized by a photo-deposition technique, then coupled with g-C3N4, forming a heterostructured composite. The tiny Au particles were uniformly decorated on the surface of CsTaWO6 while g-C3N4 coated on the CsTaWO6/Au composite. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of hydrogen generation was achieved for CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 due to the well light absorption efficiency and electron–hole pair separation. It is found the CsTaWO6/Au/g-C3N4 composite showed significantly promoting for the photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen, higher than the any components of g-C3N4 and Au/CsTaWO6, CsTaWO6 and Au/g-C3N4. Thus it confirmed the Au particles between CsTaWO6 and g-C3N4 act as an important role in facilitating the transfer of interfacial electron in the composite and absorbing visible light due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This study demonstrates a possible way for the fabrication of highly efficient ternary photocatalysts in the practical applications of the hydrogen generation."
