0,Introduction,"The negative impacts on the global environment due to the intensive use of fossil fuels need to be reduced and reversed by replacing them gradually with sustainable and carbon-neutral energy carriers. There is an agreement that the use of biologically produced energy from biomass fulfills the requirements of being a non-polluting and sustainable process [1,2]. Therefore, some options have been exploited such as the production of biodiesel, bioethanol and biohydrogen. The latter has very attractive features such as being the gas with the highest energy content per unit weight (143GJ/ton), and a carbon-free fuel which only generates water when combusted or used in conventional fuel cells for electricity generation. Besides, biohydrogen is a low-solubility gas that can be easily separated from water, purified and used as energy carrier [3]. One approach used for biohydrogen production is by fermenting biomass (e.g. carbohydrates, wastewater, waste by-products, etc.) and the biochemical routes are known as dark fermentation or fermentative hydrogen production. Among the microorganisms present in fermentative systems for hydrogen production are mainly Clostridium, Bacillus and Enterobacter, either in pure or mixed cultures [4]. As stressed by Kapdan and Kargi [5], wastewaters from the food industry, and specially the dairy industry, have high potential to be used as raw materials for biohydrogen production. Around 108 tons/year of cheese whey are produced worldwide, with the risk of being a pollutant due to its high organic content (60–80gCOD/L) together with an inadequate disposal [6,7]. In spite of the great availability of lactose-rich wastes or by-products from the dairy industry, few reports in biohydrogen production from these substrates exist [8]. Ferchichi et al. [9] used diluted cheese whey (ca. 41.1glactose/L) to study the influence of initial pH on biohydrogen production in batch experiments with a pure Clostridium culture. Another study with a pure culture reported the use of lactose (10g/L) in a continuous regime at different pH and dilution rates [10]. The use of mixed anaerobic cultures for continuous biohydrogen production from CW was first reported by Yang et al. [11]. The authors tested different organic loading rates (OLRs) at a fixed hydraulic retention time (HRT) and observed microorganisms related to the Lactobacillus genus and to lesser extent clostridia were detected by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Recently, a fed-batch process was operated by Calli et al. [8] to produce hydrogen from xylose and lactose at thermophilic conditions with inocula from compost slurry. Although in several published reports authors are primarily concerned about improving hydrogen molar yields (HMYs: mol H2/mol substrate consumed), it is important to highlight that due to the fermentation barrier imposed by thermodynamics in native microbial cultures, more attention should be paid to raise volumetric hydrogen production rates (VHPRs). Mainly because this is a critical parameter to determine full-scale practical application of fermentation processes for electricity generation, also because the higher the substrate concentration or OLR, the smaller the size and therefore the cost of the reactor needed [12,13]. From what is so far published in the literature using CW or lactose in continuous cultures one can consider that hydrogen production rates could be improved by an appropriate selection of inocula and parameters such as OLR and HRT. Particularly, it can be hypothesized that shorter HRT and higher OLR than reported to date could raise VHPR. It should be noted that for the scaling-up of fermentation process the highest allowable OLR would be desirable to minimize the size of the reactor but also trade-offs between HMY and reactor size could be important [14]. Therefore, in this work the effect of different HRT and OLR with cheese whey powder solution as a synthetic dairy wastewater was studied in order to improve the reported VHPR and the hydrogen yields if possible. The microbial communities enriched at each culture condition were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) and the main metabolites produced were analyzed as well."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Inoculum and substrate,"2.1 Inoculum and substrate Anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used as inoculum for biohydrogen production at a final concentration of 4.5g of volatile suspended solids (VSS)/L. The UASB reactor treats wastewater from a confectionery factory at San Luis Potosí, México. Prior to use, the granular sludge was washed with three volumes of tap water and then boiled for 40min to inactivate hydrogen consuming microorganisms. The inoculum was stored at 4°C. Cheese whey powder (CWP) was purchased from Land O'Lakes Inc, (Minnesota, USA). The soluble lactose content of CWP was 77% with 11% protein (w/w). Medium was supplemented with the following minerals (mg/L): Na2HPO4, 11,900; NH4H2PO4, 4500; K2HPO4, 125; MgCl2·6H2O, 100; ZnCl2, 75; FeSO4·6H2O, 25; MnSO4·7H2O, 15; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 12.5; CuSO4·5H2O, 5; CoCl2·8H2O, 3."
3,Experimental set-up,"2.2 Experimental set-up Continuous culture was performed in a 3-L bioreactor equipped with an ADI 1030 system controller and BioXpert 1.3 data-acquisition software (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, The Netherlands). Mixing at 250rpm was performed with two Rushton turbines; pH was monitored online (AppliSens, Schiedam, The Netherlands) and automatically controlled at 5.9during continuous operation dosing 10M NaOH with a peristaltic pump (Masterflex, Barnant, Illinois, USA). Temperature was kept at 37°C using an electric jacket. The bioreactor was fed and drained using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex, Barnant, Illinois, USA). Operation started in batch mode and continuous regime began 12h after. During the first three periods (I, II and III; Table 1 ) continuous operation was performed at a fixed CWP feed concentration of 30g/L but HRT was reduced from 10h to 4h stepwise, keeping a minimum operation time of 10 times the HRT for each period (I–VII). From periods IV to VII, a fixed HRT of 6h was selected and then, the OLR was increased by raising the CWP concentration in the feed stepwise. The OLRs tested ranged from 92.4 to 184.4glactose/L/d (Table 1). Foam production was controlled by addition of silicone antifoam (0.1%, AF Emulsion, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA). Gas production was measured using a liquid-displacement device filled with water (pH=2; Fig. 1 ). All gas volumes are reported as measured (0.81atm and 25°C)."
4,Analytical methods,"2.3 Analytical methods H2 and CO2 were measured with a 1.0mL Pressure-Lok® syringe (Valco Instruments, Houston, Texas, USA) by comparing a 300μL sample from the reactor headspace with high purity standards (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA) using a gas chromatograph (GC, 6890N Network GC System, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The column used was a Hayesep D (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA) with the following dimensions: 10′×1/8″×0.085″. Temperatures of the injection port, oven and the detector were 250, 60 and 250°C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow-rate of 12mL/min. Liquid samples were periodically withdrawn from the reactor and stored at −20°C before analysis. Lactose, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and solvents such as acetone, ethanol, propanol and butanol were analyzed as previously described [15]. VSS were analyzed according to the standard methods [16]."
5,Microbial community analyses by 16S rRNA genes using DGGE,"2.4 Microbial community analyses by 16S rRNA genes using DGGE 2.4.1 DNA extraction Ten-milliliter samples were periodically withdrawn from the reactor and stored at −20°C with a final concentration of 15% glycerol until analysis. Twenty-three samples were selected, starting from day 0 to 53.4. DNA extraction protocols reported elsewhere [17,18] were optimized to be used on granular sludge samples. In brief, the samples were slowly thawed and 500μL were taken and were centrifuged at 7000g for 10min. The pellet was washed two times with PBS buffer (10mM NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, plus NaCl 140mM, pH 7.5), resuspended in extraction buffer (10mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50mM EDTA, 0.5M NaCl) and sonicated for 5min in an ultrasonic processor (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, USA). Afterwards, the mixture was incubated with 10μL of RNase (20mg/mL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 20μL of lysozyme (20mg/mL, USB, Cleveland, USA) and 15μL of proteinase K (20mg/mL, Invitrogen, Germany) during 2h at 37°C and 350rpm. 100μL of SDS (10%) and 200μL of sodium acetate (5M, pH 8) were added to the mixture and incubated for 10min at 60°C. For the purification of the nucleic acids present in the mixture, one volume of chloroform–isoamylic alcohol (24:1) was added, mixed and centrifuged for 10min at 7000g. This purification step was repeated two times with the liquid supernatant. To precipitate nucleic acids, one volume of isopropanol at −20°C was added to the supernatant and incubated for 3h at −20°C before centrifugation at 4°C for 20min at 7000g. The pellet was first washed with absolute ethanol and centrifuged at 7000g for 1min, and then washed again with 70% ethanol and centrifuged with the same conditions. DNA pellet was dried at room temperature and resuspended in 50μL of sterile deionized water. A DNA integrity analysis was performed in 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. 2.4.2 PCR amplification Amplification of the hypervariable 3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from the purified nucleic acid's preparations was carried out by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Biotools, Spain). The PCR primers used were the forward primer C356F (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCGCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and the reverse primer 517R (5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′) described elsewhere by Muyzer et al. [19] for bacterial identification of complex microbial population. The primer C356F contains the GC clamp shown with bold letters led to carry out the DGGE. Reaction conditions were as follows: initial DNA denaturation at 95°C for 1min using 1.5U of Pfu polymerase, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30s and annealing from 65 to 60°C for 30s, lowering the temperature 0.5°C each cycle, and followed by an extension at 72°C for 1min. In addition, 20 cycles at 95°C for 30s, 60°C for 30s and 72°C for 1min; with a final extension at 72°C for 7min were performed. The PCR product was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to assess the size, purity and concentration of DNA. 2.4.3 DGGE analysis DGGE was performed with Dcode Universal Mutation Detection System (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). The PCR products were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TAE buffer (20mM Tris–acetate, 10mM sodium acetate, 0.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4) with a denaturing gradient (urea–formamide) that ranged from 30 to 60%. Electrophoresis was carried out at 60°C at a constant voltage of 39V during 14h. After electrophoresis the gel was stained using SYBR© Safe for 30min (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, Oregon, USA) before being visualized on a UV transilluminator (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). The dominant bands were excised from the gel, eluted in 10mM Tris–EDTA buffer (pH 7.5) overnight at 4°C. The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR with the conditions mentioned before (see Section 2.4.2). The PCR products from reamplification were sent to purification and sequencing to Molecular Cloning Laboratories (MCLAB, California, USA). Sequence data were analyzed with Bioedit v. 7.0.9 software (Ibis Bioscience, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and submitted to the non-redundant nucleotide database at GenBank using the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) and Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) for bacterial identification."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Continuous hydrogen production,"3.1 Continuous hydrogen production The bioreactor was operated during 65.6d in 7 periods (I–VII) under different HRT and OLR, and its performance is shown in Fig. 2 . The features of each operational period are listed in Table 1. According to a previous study it was decided to set initial batch conditions at pH 7.5 and 30gCWP/L [15]. The process design was intended for maximizing the VHPR controlling the OLR and HRT. Consequently, the criterion applied for determining the degree of stability was keeping a minimum operation time of 10 times the HRT; this criterion is common practice in the field of Environmental Biotechnology. During the whole operation of the CSTR, hydrogen content in the gas phase was between 49 and 58 % (v/v) with only CO2 as the second gas detected. VHPR peaked at 1100mLH2/L/h before reaching the steady state at period I. Here CSTR started with an HRT of 10h, feeding 30gCWP/L. During this initial period an average of 496mLH2/L/h (16.4mmolH2/L/h) evolved during 7.1d of operation, with an HMY of 2.4mol H2/mol lactose. During this period, the mean VFA produced was around 9700mg/L, with a butyric-to-acetic acid (HBu/HAc) ratio of 2.4 (Table 1). The HBu/HAc ratio is proposed by some authors as a predictor of hydrogen yield, with reported values between 2.1 and 5.9 [20]. The reduction from an HRT of 10–6h (keeping 30gCWP/L fed) increased the VHPR to 583mLH2/L/h (19.3mmolH2/L/h) as a result of increasing OLR from period I to period II. This trend has also been reported by other authors [20,21]. Drops in hydrogen production rate at days 10.4, 13.3 and 21.2 which caused an increase in lactose present in the reactor were due to failures in the feeding pump. Although, it must be noticed that, after these perturbations, the system recovered and eventually returned to its previous performance. For this reason, it was decided to maintain period II during almost 23d. For period II, total VFA production increased to 10,642mg/L with an HBu/HAc ratio of 2.05. With the exception of days 0.8, 1.9 and 20.8 propionic acid was not detected during the operation of periods I and II. For period III the HRT was reduced to 4h, holding again 30gCWP/L, which drastically led to a sharp fall in VHPR starting on day 31 due to a wash out of the hydrogen-producing bacteria (Fig. 2). As a result of the wash out, lactose was detected in the medium up to 16.9g/L on day 31.7. Moreover, the production of propionic acid triggered from day 31 reaching near 12,000mg/L on day 31.7. This is consistent with previous reports in which propionic-type fermentation is associated either with low production or consumption of H2 [22,23]. Both butyric and acetic acids dropped to 500mg/L each, on day 32 lowering the HBu/HAc ratio to 1.0. Therefore, the change to an HRT of 4h was critical and had a detrimental impact on the VHPR, lactose consumption and VFA production. At this point the CSTR was re-started and re-inoculated with both initial heat-treated inoculum (50mL, equivalent to 3g VSS) and biomass saved from period II (20mL, equivalent to 1.5g VSS). In order to see the reproducibility of the data obtained, the reactor was operated during period IV at the same conditions applied during period II. Continuous operation at HRT of 6h (period IV) was started after 8h of batch regime. Even though periods II and IV were operated with the same OLR and HRT, a higher VHPR (704mLH2/L/h) was attained in period IV presumably due to differences in the microbial community before and after re-inoculation. Beside this difference in VHPR values, variations between 10 and 20% are quite reasonable for systems with mixed microbial populations. Furthermore, additional independent experiments were conducted under similar conditions (results not shown) and the VHPR values obtained pointed out to the reproducibility of the data. Consequently, revisiting any one combination of OLR and HRT will result in the same outcome, unless any uncontrolled variable could cause wash out conditions for any of the microorganisms involved in the hydrogen production. During the short operation in period IV (3.9d) the HBu/HAc ratio returned to 2.4 and HMY reached 2.1. It should be noticed that from periods III to IV, propionic acid production decreased but not ceased. From this point onwards the HRT was fixed at 6h and the OLR was raised by increasing the CWP concentration in the feed. Thus a 25% increase in OLR from periods IV to V caused a 59% increment in VHPR while HMY was also raised from 2.1 to 2.6 and HBu/HAc ratio decreased from 2.4 to 2.0. One further increase of 20% in OLR resulted in a 35% higher VHPR from periods V to VI. Molar yield also had a slight upgrade during this change but HBu/HAc ratio decreased (Table 1, Fig. 2). From the VHPR results presented in Table 1 for periods V and VI it can be noted that the standard deviation values were below 10%, indicating a stable reactor performance. The final increase to 184.4glactose/L/d during period VII (33% more than period VI) caused a fast drop in VHPR since day 60.5 (Fig. 2a). This downward tendency in VHPR, together with the increase in propionic acid concentration from day 60 were interpreted as an indicative of a shock-load (overload) in the system due to the product inhibition of the end metabolites at higher OLR. The substrate overload reported here at 184.4glactose/L/d is consistent with previous studies [21,24,25] and very close to the 192kgCOD/m3/d reported by Guo et al. [24] in an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor fed with molasses. Also the sudden increase in acetic acid from day 60 could be related to a diminished VHPR through H2 consumption by acetogens [14]. At this point, the operation of the CSTR was stopped after 6.3d of operation of period VII. During the operation of the bioreactor, ethanol production attained values in a range from 100 to 600mg/L, with the exception of period III in which the concentration dropped to 50mg/L. Acetone, propanol and butanol were not detected. The same trend was observed for VSS with an average of 5000mg/L, which decreased to 2000mg/L during wash out of the reactor (data not shown). Previous reports in fermentative Bio-H2 production with an axenic Clostridium culture and mixed cultures using lactose or CW are presented in Table 2 , in order to compare those results with the attained in this study. In this work, OLRs at least 6 times higher and HRTs shorter than other reported studies using lactose or CW were tested (Table 2). In particular, in the work by Yang et al. [11], the authors used three HRTs (12, 18 and 24h) and attained better results at 24h and 14gCOD/L/d with their highest VHPR of 1000mLH2/L/d. In the present work a VHPR of 46.61mmolH2/L/h (33,768mLH2/L/d) at HRT of 6h is reported (period VI, Table 1), which is near to 34 times higher than the best obtained by Yang et al. [11]. It is also noteworthy to mention that in the best conditions, the authors achieved around 30% H2 in the gas, along with the constant presence of methane and CO2 [11]. Moreover, other differences with the work by Yang et al. [11] are remarked, they concluded that HRTs less than 24h did not favor the H2 production from CW and reported that the best pH was in the range from 4.0 to 5.0. Despite of the different results there is an agreement that higher OLR may be effective for a greater VHPR as it is reported here. The VHPRs achieved in this study were higher than those listed in Table 2 likely due to the different conditions tested, and mainly due to shorter HRT and higher OLR selected here. As discussed by Van Ginkel and Logan [21] there is an inverse relation between OLR and HMY, thus the use of a higher OLR (to increase VHPR) leads to a diminished HMY as can be verified in Table 2. This compromise could be overcome by optimizing a fermentative process based on the VHPR and increasing the overall yield by using a second stage that will be fed with VFA to generate more energy in the form of H2, methane or electricity [26]."
8,Microbial community analyses by PCR–DGGE,"3.2 Microbial community analyses by PCR–DGGE One cause for the differences found in H2 fermentative system performances is the microbial communities developed in the bioreactors under distinct culture conditions [23,25]. For this reason an attempt to identify the microorganisms present during the operation of the CSTR was carried out by PCR–DGGE analyses. Fig. 3 shows the DGGE pattern of the partial 16S rRNA genes amplified from the bioreactor samples under different HRTs (10, 6 and 4h) from time zero (t 0) to operation day 53.4 and Table 3 shows the microorganisms identified. The degree of confidence on the species identification was determined by the percentage of identity and the E value. As seen in Fig. 3, species of the Clostridium genus were detected as the predominant bacteria in HRT of 10 and 6h, but the intensity of these bands (A, B, F and G) diminished or disappeared at the onset of HRT=4h. Clostridium genus was detected again only after re-inoculation, which corresponds to lane 13. The PCR–DGGE technique has been used for the analysis of complex microbial population such as biofilms isolated from aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment reactors [19], change of sludge consortium in response to sequential adaptation to contaminants [27] or detection of microbes in food [28]. The dominance of Clostridium species in this work was already suspected based on the profile of soluble metabolites produced, since butyrate and acetate were the main products [29]. During the wash out of acidogenic bacteria that occurred at an HRT of 4h (Fig. 3: lanes 10–12) it should be noticed that the band F, identified as Clostridium sp. (accession number AY188842) was not observed at time 31.7d at the same time that VHPR suddenly fell (Figs. 2 and 3). Recently, Chang et al. [30] operated a CSTR inoculated with heat-treated sludge decreasing the HRT from 12, 8, 6, 4 to 3h. The authors could detect Clostridium genus by PCR–DGGE only from HRT 12 to 4h and when HRT decreased to 3h the active bacterial composition changed, resulting in the wash out of Clostridium. In another study, continuous production of Bio-H2 at HRT from 12 to 2h resulted in the predominance of Clostridium ramosum even at the shortest HRT [31]. Moreover, an unidentified Clostridium sp. was found in a continuous reactor fed with starch operated at HRTs of 2, 1 and 0.5h at pH 6.0. Other microorganisms such as Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Dialister sp. have been observed at HRTs of 12, 2, 1 and 0.5h [32]. Thus, although other non-excised bands exist during the operation at HRT of 4h (times 31.7 and 32d) it can be concluded that the main organism related to an efficient H2 production in this system was Clostridium sp. identified from band F (accession number AY188842). Other microorganisms detected were Clostridium butyricum CM-C86 (band A, accession number EU869239.1) and C. butyricum CM-C97 (band B, accession number EU869243.1), which were observed at time 0 and also due to the re-inoculation (day 33.7). Also Clostridium paraputrificum (band C, accession number AY442815.1), C. butyricum CGS6 (band G, accession number AY540110). Occasionally Enterococcus faecium (band D, accession number AB243003.1) and Streptococcus sp. (band E, accession number EU932810.1) were detected during operation at HTR of 6h. As can be also noticed from Fig. 3 there are two bands (A and B) that were detected after re-inoculation corresponding to C. butyricum CM-C86 and C. butyricum CM-C97. These microorganisms were not detected in the period immediately before wash out (period II) and could be the reason for the slight improvement in VHPR and HMY for period IV compared to II. This is consistent with reports in the literature where efficient hydrogen production using different C. butyricum strains and substrates was attained [33–35]. Interestingly, C. paraputrificum was found as a low intensity band (C) apparently ubiquitous from time 0 to even at HRT of 4h. C. paraputrificum has been reported as capable to produce H2 from chitinous wastes [36], moreover the overexpression of an [Fe]-hydrogenase gene using the same strain was reported by Morimoto et al. [37] to enhance H2 production. Unlike the work by Yang et al. [11] in which the authors found mainly Lactobacillus over Clostridium, here Clostridium genus was detected during the operation of the CSTR at HRTs of 10 and 6h, shorter than the 24h used by those authors. It has been reported that Lactobacillus could be related to low H2 production rates [38], then this feature could also explain the aforementioned differences in VHPR between this work and the reported by Yang et al. [11]. It must be remarked that although a very similar substrate (CWP) was used in both works, the selection of a suitable inoculum could also play an important role. In that work [11], the authors used a seed inoculum from an anaerobic digester with an HRT of 24d, while for this work a granular sludge from a full-scale methanogenic reactor that has been operated for over 10 years with frequent periods of acidification was selected. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the inoculum used here could be naturally enriched toward acidogenic bacteria."
9,Conclusions,"The results from this study have shown that an enhancement of VHPR by increasing OLR using CW and mixed microbial community was feasible. It was demonstrated that shorter HRTs than previously reported with the use of CW, are recommended for better hydrogen production performance including both higher VHPR and H2% in the gas phase. It was shown that HRT had a strong effect on the microbial community detected by DGGE. Because wash out of acidogenic bacteria was observed at an HRT of 4h, an HRT of 6h is recommended. Clostridium sp. (accession number AY188842) was the dominant of the microbial community in the bioreactor and was related to the best performance achieved in the CSTR. Moreover, it was shown that the OLR had an effect on the hydrogen production performance with a substrate overload similar to other published works. This suggests that regardless the fermentation system used, there is an OLR threshold for bacteria which directs metabolic routes away from Bio-H2 production. Thus, in order to enhance VHPR, it is relevant to work with both appropriate conditions such as HRT and OLR and to select initial inocula that could be enriched toward efficient hydrogen-producing microorganisms. Finally, an enhancement in VHPR is significant because this is a critical parameter in the assessment of the full-scale practical application of fermentation technologies. Because the higher the VHPRs, the smaller the size and consequently the cost of the reactor needed for sustainable and clean energy generation from Bio-H2 in the near future."
