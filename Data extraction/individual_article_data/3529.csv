0,Introduction,"In recent years, more attention has been paid to developing clean energy by utilizing renewable intermittent sources. Among the various resources, solar energy has attracted greater attention due to its abundant availability, however, they are discontinuous due to varying seasonal factors which was a major drawback related to this energy resource. Hence, developing clean and low cost alternative energy production was considered an urgent and efficient field of research [1,2]. The Fuel cell was considered as an efficient energy conversion device greatly employed for the production of electricity. In the past years, H2 was produced in large quantity by steam reforming of hydrocarbon which releases a large amount of carbon-monoxide gas along with hydrogen and also it requires high pressure and temperature for the reaction to proceed. The release of CO2 shows adverse an effect in the atmosphere and therefore developing an alternative way of hydrogen production has led to intense concern among the research communities. High purity hydrogen generation by water electrolysis was found to be an effective technique in which no poisonous gases will be released [3–9]. Similarly, the electrolyzer-integrated regenerative fuel cell decomposes the water molecules and generates hydrogen by water electrolysis technique without the release of harmful gases [10]. To initialize the reaction, an efficient electrocatalyst was required and the conventional electrocatalyst used for HER was Platinum (Pt). But the costs of such materials are high and their availability is low. So, the current research arena is largely working to interchange this high cost material with low-cost catalysts. In this context, Sb2S3 metal chalcogenides were developed and its catalytic activity in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H++2e-→H2) was studied in this research work [11,12]. Two-dimensional single layered transition metal dichalcogenides exhibits the general formula MX2, where M belongs to transition metals of group 4–10 and X corresponds to a chalcogen. The thickness of each layer is typically around 6–7 Å, in which a layer of hexagonally packed metal atoms is sandwiched between the couple of layers containing chalcogen atoms. The metal atoms supplies four electrons to occupy the binding states of transition metals so that the metal atom and chalcogen atoms exhibits the oxidation states of + 4 and –2, respectively. The surfaces of the layers were terminated with lone-pair electrons of the chalcogen atoms, and due to the absence of dangling bonds it renders stability towards against reactions at ambient conditions. The bond length of M-M differs from 3.15 Å to 4.03 Å, based on the size of the metal and chalcogen ions [27]. Nanostructured materials based on layered transition metal dichalcogenides were utilized in various fields of application such as electronic, optical, and semiconductor devices [13,14]. The outstanding properties of these layered materials are due to the anisotropic nature in which the layers are composed together by weak force. And over each monolayer, metal atoms were attached covalently by chalcogenide atoms [14]. In this framework, antimony sulfide which belongs to the 5th and 4th group of direct band-gap semiconductors with an hexagonal structure was employed as an electrocatalyst for HER. It was also considered as an efficient material in photovoltaic application [15–17] due to wide spectral response [17], solar energy to fuel conversion [18,19], photocatalysis [20,28], optoelectronic devices in IR regions [21,22] and thermoelectric cooling technologies. Sb2S3 nanostructures can be easily tuned to different morphologies by incorporating chemical reagents such as sodium thiosulfate, thioacetamide, ammonium sulfide and thiourea under vigorous stirring with complex agents in an aqueous or non-aqueous solution. In this work, morphologically varied Sb2S3 nanostructures were synthesized through one-step solvothermal method in which thiourea was used as a sulfur source. The morphologies of Sb2S3 samples were tailored by incorporating different polymers and anionic surfactants. The structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of the prepared Sb2S3 nanostructures were studied in detail. Among the different electrocatalysts, Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure exhibiting dumbbell-shaped morphology showed better performance in catalyzing HER with a small Tafel slope value of 85 mV/dec."

2,Chemicals,"2.1 Chemicals Antimony (III) chloride (SbCl3), Thiourea and Potassium hydroxide (KOH) were bought from Hi-media product laboratory Pvt Ltd. India. PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), PEG (polyethylene glycol), PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), and were acquired from Sigma Aldrich."
3,Synthesis of Sb2S3 nanostructures,"2.2 Synthesis of Sb2S3 nanostructures In the synthesis of Sb2S3 nanostructures, 1.3 mM of antimony (III) chloride (SbCl3) was added to 50 mL of ethanol under stirring to form a clear solution. After, 5.27 mM of thiourea was added into the solution and stirred for 2 h under nitrogen purging to remove oxygen molecules. The resultant precipitate (pale orange color) was separated by centrifugation and dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water. The solution was then transferred to Teflon lined autoclave and maintained at 180°C for 24 h. The same reaction procedure was followed along with the addition of different surfactants (0.01 M) such as PVA (polyvinyl Alcohol), PVP (polyvinyl Pyrrolidone), SDS (Sodium Dodecyl sulfate), and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) to tailor the morphology of the Sb2S3 nanostructures. The obtained powder was centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. The obtained samples were dried under vacuum at 50°C for 24 h. And the Sb2S3 samples prepared with the addition of different surfactants were denoted as Sb2S3 (PVA), Sb2S3 (PVP), Sb2S3 (PEG), and Sb2S3 (SDS) nanostructures. Scheme 1 depict the formation of different morphology of Sb2S3 by various surfactants. The prepared nanostructures exhibited varying sizes during the addition of different surfactants. The reaction steps occurring during the formation of Sb2S3 nanostructures is shown below. SbCl3 + 3etOH → Sb (OH) 3 + 3etCl CH3CSNH2 → CH3CNH⁺ + S2⁻ + H⁺ 2Sb (OH)3 + 3S2-→Sb2S3 + 6OH-"
4,Characterization techniques,"2.3 Characterization techniques XRD analysis was performed by using a Rigaku Ultima 1 V X-Ray Diffractometer System with a CuKα source (λ = 0.15406 nm). Morphological analysis was carried out using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI QUANTA250-FEG, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa Probe II, ULVAC-PHI Inc., USA) fitted (200 µm, 15 kV monochromatic AI-Kα X-ray source hv=1486.6 eV) was employed to determine the elemental analysis. The specific surface area of the prepared nanostructures was investigated using N2 adsorption desorption isotherms and the pore volume was determined from BJH plot (Microtarc BELSORP-max)."
5,Electrochemical measurement,"2.4 Electrochemical measurement The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared catalysts towards HER was performed using PARSTAT electrochemical workstation. For modifying GCE, the catalyst slurry was prepared by adding 6 mg of the sample in 500 μL ethanol and sonicated for 30 min to attain a uniformly dispersed mixture. Then, an appropriate amount of the catalyst was coated on the GCE surface. The catalytic activity was demonstrated in 1 M KOH solution under the H2 saturated atmosphere. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s whereas, the polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The potential recorded with respect to SCE was converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation which is presented in Eq. (1). (1) E RHE = E SCE + E SCE O + 0.059 pH Chronoamperometry studies were carried out to investigate the stability of the catalysts for a duration of 10,000 s. The electrocatalytic active surface area (ECSA) of the electrocatalyst were determined from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value derived by acquiring CV curves in the non-faradaic potential region of − 0.04 to − 0.14 V vs. RHE at different scan rates. By plotting against different scan rate and current density measured at the particular potential a linear fit will be obtained. The slope value of the linear plot i.e (i = C(dE/dt)) corresponds to the Cdl value. The ratio of Cdl and Cs (specific capacitance of the smooth surface) provides the ECSA value. The charge transfer occurring at the interface of electrode and electrolyte was investigated using impedance spectroscopy which was recorded in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an applied amplitude of 0.02 V."
6,Reaction mechanism of HER,"2.5 Reaction mechanism of HER In general, the HER is performed in acid or alkaline media (Eqs. 1–2). In the acid medium, the HER begins with the formation of a surface adsorption hydrogen (Had) through the reaction of a hydrogen proton with an electron (denoted Volmer step). And then, the hydrogen gas will be produced from the surface adsorption hydrogen via the Tafel step and/or Heyrovsky step. In such a case, the free energy for adsorbed hydrogen (∆GH) is considered as a key factor for acidic HER. In case of alkaline HER, an additional water adsorption and dissociation is involved in the Volmer step, which therefore leads to the much slower reaction kinetics of alkaline HER than acid HER. Therefore, the HER activity of an electrocatalyst in alkaline media is not solely associated with the ∆GH but also has great relationship with the ability to dissociate water. HER in acid media (1). H+ + e⁻ + * → H* (Volmer) H+ + e⁻ + H* → H2 (Heyrovsky) (or) 2H* → H2 (Tafel) HER in alkaline media (2). H2O + e⁻ → H* + OH⁻ (Volmer) H2O + e⁻ + H* → H2 + OH⁻ (Heyrovsky) (or) 2H* → H2 (Tafel)"
7,Result and discussion,
8,Structural and morphological studies,"3.1 Structural and morphological studies The phase and purity of the synthesized Sb2S3 nanostructures were investigated using X-ray diffraction technique. Fig. 1 depicts XRD spectra of Sb2S3 nanostructures synthesized using different surfactants. The peak at 2θ values of 25.2°, 29.4°, 32.5°,33.7°, 35.8°, 37.3°, 43.3°,45.7° 46.9°,53.2°, 54.3º, 60.2°, 66.9º, and 72.2° corresponds to (130), (230), (211),(301), (240), (231), (421),(440),(301), (351), (132), (720), (721), and (811) lattice planes respectively. The obtained peaks are in good agreement with the JCPDS card number#: 06-0474. The average crystallite size (D) was calculated using Scherer’s formula. D = ( 0.9 λ ) / ( β cos θ ) where ‘λ’ is the wavelength of the Cu Kα line, ‘β’ is the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak corresponding to (130) plane and ‘θ’ corresponds to the angle derived from 2θ. The average grain size of all the samples was determined and their values are tabulated in Table 1. The morphology of the synthesized samples was characterized using FESEM recorded at the applied voltage of 20 kV. Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of Sb2S3 nanostructures exhibiting different surface morphology obtained with the addition of different surfactants. Fig. 2(a–c) corresponds to the FESEM images of Sb2S3 (Normal) which exhibits in the form of microrods. The micrographs of Sb2S3 (PVA) were displayed in Fig. 2(d–f) in which it formed in to bundle of sheets and the size is comparably reduced from Sb2S3 (Normal). Fig. 2(g–i) reveals the FESEM image of Sb2S3 (PVP) sample which was grown in to dumbbell shape formed together by aggregation of nanowires. Fig. 2(j–l) displays the FESEM image of Sb2S3 (PEG) nanostructures where it exhibits flake like structure and Fig. 2(m–o) displays the FESEM micrographs of Sb2S3 (SDS) which appears as a bundle of flake like structures and the size is comparatively lower than that of Sb2S3 (PEG) nanostructures ( Table 2). The composition of the elements in the prepared samples was investigated using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX). Fig. 3(a–e) depicts the EDX spectra of Sb2S3 (Normal), Sb2S3 (PVA), Sb2S3 (PVP), Sb2S3 (PEG), and Sb2S3 (SDS) nanostructures in which all the spectra reveal the signals of Sb and S and no other signals were observed which indicates that the sample was successfully prepared. This further confirms that the sample was high purity in nature. The corresponding elemental mapping of the samples was presented in Fig. 3(f–j) attributes to the elemental mapping of the prepared Sb2S3 nanostructures which shows the even distribution of antimony and sulfur elements confirming the purity of the samples."
9,Compositional investigation,"3.2 Compositional investigation The valence state of the constituent elements present in Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure was analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The standard survey spectrum of Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure was shown in Fig. 4(a) which reveals the presence of Sb and S elements which strongly proves the formation of Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure. The same interpretation also matches with the results obtained from XRD and EDAX findings. The core level spectrum of Sb was shown in Fig. 4(b). The two peaks observed in the core level spectrum of Sb at binding energies 529.08 eV and 538.9 eV with a separation of 9.4 eV parallels were attributed to Sb 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, states respectively. The high-resolution spectrum of sulfur (S) was shown in Fig. 4(c) with the presence of two peaks at the binding energies of 161.30 and 162.5 eV which correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of sulfur respectively [31]."
10,Surface area analysis,"3.3 Surface area analysis Fig. 5 displays the Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm of Sb2S3 sample. Prior to the determination of pore size and surface area measurement, the sample was treated for 3 h at 100°C to remove adsorbed water moisture and gas molecules from the pore of the material. The obtained isotherms well fitted with IUPAC type II and type IV curve with a relative pressure (P/Po) hysteresis loop between 0.5 and 1. The samples exhibiting type IV curve indicates the mesoporous nature of the materials. The calculated surface area of Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure was found to be 83 m2/g. The inset shows the BJH plot which reveals the pore size distribution of the sample and the average pore size of Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure was found to be 7.49 nm. The calculated surface area of other nanostructures was tabulated below in Table 3. The inset shows the BJH plot which reveals the pore size distribution of the sample and the average pore size of all the prepared nanostructure was also described in Table 3."
11,Electrochemical studies,
12,Electrocatalysis of HER,"4.1 Electrocatalysis of HER In order to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the prepared electrocatalysts towards HER, CV analysis was carried out initially. It was scanned in the potential range from 0 to − 1 V vs. SCE in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a cycling speed of 50 mV/s which was presented in Fig. 6(a). It was observed from Fig. 6(a) that Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic performance towards the evolution of hydrogen. All the catalysts disclose HER activity with the sharp drop in the cathode sweep whereas Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst outperforms with low onset potential when compared with other samples. This was attributed to dumbbell-shaped morphology and the combined synergetic effects of Sb and S atoms in which they are capable of adsorbing a large number of H species and binds well chemically followed by the release of H2 molecules. All other morphologically different samples reveal a slight shift in potential corroborating that dumbbell-shaped electrocatalyst formed together as a combination of nanowires was more efficient in evolving hydrogen molecules. This was attributed to the presence of more defective sites for adsorbing hydrogen species and higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of this catalyst than other catalysts. To further evaluate the electrocatalytic activity, iR uncompensated linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were recorded for the catalysts possessing different morphology but composed of the same material. Fig. 6(b) displays the polarization curves of all the prepared catalysts and Pt/C catalyst in which Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst having dumbbell shape among the prepared catalysts revealed comparatively better electrocatalytic performance towards HER electrocatalysis. However, the standard Pt/C catalyst disclosed a ultra-low overpotential value of 0.04 V vs. RHE. It was also evident from Fig. 6(b), that Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst offers a low onset potential for hydrogen evolution. However, the efficiency of any electrocatalyst was determined by considering the overpotential needed to deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm2 which was a universal consideration for converting solar energy to fuel. In this context, Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalysts exhibited a comparatively low overpotential value of − 0.168 vs. RHE to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm2. Hence, it was proved that Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure was a highly efficient electrocatalyst in evolving hydrogen molecules. The kinetic behavior of the catalysts was determined using Tafel analysis which corroborates the dependence of potential and current density. Tafel plots were fitted from iR-drop uncompensated LSVs recorded at a slow sweep rate of 0.005 V/s. Tafel plot is fitted based on the Tafel equation η = b logj+ a, where, η stands for overpotential, b, a and j stands for Tafel slope, intercept and current density respectively. The HER kinetics in alkaline medium proceeds via three steps (1) Volmer step, (2) Heyrovsky and (3) Tafel step. In the Volmer step, a hydrogen atom will be released on the electrode surface by the coupling of H2O with OH- ions. Depending on the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed over the surface, the hydrogen species interacts with an H+ which is a Heyrovsky step and on the other hand two H+ combine together which is a Tafel step [25,29]. Fig. 6(c) shows the Tafel plots of Sb2S3 and the obtained Tafel slopes for bare Sb2S3, Sb2S3 (PVA), Sb2S3 (PVP), Sb2S3 (PEG), Sb2S3 (SDS) was found to be 203 mV/dec, 155 mV/dec, 85 mV/dec, 224 mV/dec, 168 mV/dec respectively and Pt/c catalyst is exhibited Tafel slope value is 45mVdec−1. It was noteworthy, that Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst exhibited a small Tafel slope value of 85 mV/dec depicting that it follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky step which is a rate determining step that occurred during HER [30]. Stability was also an important criterion for assessing the electrocatalyst to be utilized in long term practical application and it was studied using CA in 1 M KOH solution at the applied potential of − 0.4 V and it was presented in Fig. 8(a). It was evident that the CA curve exhibited a few distortions, which might be due to the accumulation and release of H2 bubbles after a certain time period. The accumulation of bubbles over the electrode cascades the surface and thereby decreases the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8(c) the catalyst exhibited insignificant degradation of HER activity even at the applied potential of − 0.4 V after 10,000 cycles. This strongly proves that morphologically varied Sb2S3 electrocatalyst was highly stable. ECSA was an important parameter to be evaluated as it plays a vital role in elevating the electrocatalytic activity and it was calculated according to the following equation ECSA = C dl / C s where, Cs was assumed to be 60µFcm−2, which is the standard value considered for all smooth electrode in 1 M KOH solution and Cdl values was calculated from CV measurements recorded in the potential ranging of − 0.04 to − 0.14 V vs. RHE which is shown in Fig. 7(a), where no charge transfer occurs. The current density at a particular potential was measured for different scan rates and by re-plotting current density vs. scan rate a straight line will be derived and it was shown in Fig. 7(b). The slope of linear fit corresponds to the Cdl value. The calculated value of ESCA was found to be 0.90, 5.53, 6.24, 0.49, and 5.85 cm2 for bare Sb2S3, Sb2S3 (PVA), Sb2S3 (PVP), Sb2S3 (PEG), and Sb2S3 (SDS) respectively. The electrocatalyst Sb2S3 (PVP) revealed larger ECSA value of 6.24 cm2 which further proves that the catalyst possesses a large surface area which helps in improving the electrocatalytic performance. Roughness factor was an important role in enhancing the activity as the parameter depends on the active surface area of the catalyst that exists in the geometrical surface of the electrode [23]. It was calculated from the ratio of ECSA and geometric surface area (0.0732 cm2) of the electrode [26]. The calculated Rf values was found to be 12.41, 6.72, 75.5, 85.30, 79.94 for bare Sb2S3, Sb2S3 (PVA), Sb2S3 (PVP), Sb2S3 (PEG), Sb2S3 (SDS) respectively. The catalyst with a higher Rf value indicates that it possesses more accessible sites, for adsorbing hydrogen species than other catalysts with varied surface morphology [24]. EIS analysis was done to determine the charge transfer kinetics occurring at the catalyst coated electrode and electrolyte interface which is displayed in Fig. 8(b). The impedance analysis was performed in 1 M KOH solution in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the applied amplitude of 20 mV. The diameter of the semicircle depicts the charge transfer resistance value and Warburg resistance in the low-frequency region corresponds to the penetration of ions occurring during the electrocatalytic reaction. The experimental plots were fitted by considering the equivalent circuit comprising Rs, CPE1, CPE2, Rct and Rmt. The Rct value of Sb2S3 (PVP) catalyst was found to be 8.42 (Ω) which was comparatively lower than other catalysts. This finding further proves that Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst was more efficient due to rapid electron transfer. Fig. 8(c,d) shows the polarization curves and impedance analysis recorded after stability analysis carried out for 10 h. It was observed that Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst revealed low overpotential even after its subjection to stability analysis. This might be due to the generation of more number of adsorption sites due to catalytic performance for a long period and thus releases hydrogen molecules more rapidly."
13,Conclusion,"In summary, Sb2S3 nanostructures were prepared by facile solvothermal method and were tuned to different morphologies by the addition of surfactants. The addition of surfactants played a crucial role in tailoring the morphology with a higher order of crystallinity. Morphological analysis recorded using FESEM revealed the different morphologies formed by varying the surfactants. Among all the catalysts, Sb2S3 (PVP) nanostructure exhibiting dumbbell-shape was comparatively smaller in size. The morphologically tuned Sb2S3 nanostructure electrocatalysts were subjected to HER catalysis and Sb2S3 (PVP) electrocatalyst exhibited better performance with low overpotential value (−0.168 V vs. RHE) when compared with other catalyst having different morphologies. The enhanced performance was attributed to the presence of more suggests that Sb2S3 (PVP) can be employed as a HER electrocatalyst in water splitting system."
