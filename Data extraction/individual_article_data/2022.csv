0,Introduction,"Today’s transportation area and power systems depend highly on internal combustion engines and conventional fossil fuels. Especially, diesel engines are still prominent on power generation due to their inevitable advantages such as high power to weight ratios and efficiency values. Projection of U.S. EIA (United States Energy Information Administration) states that limited and non-renewable petroleum reserves will have diminished in 2050 [1]. Since undesired exhaust emissions such as smoke, unburnt hydrocarbons, CO, particulate matter and NOx emitted from engines have hazardous effects on both health of living beings and environmental climatic conditions, studies on reducing pollutants released by diesel engines are another major problem to comprehensively be handled by scientists [2]. Particularly, emission standards for engines are being stricter year after year. That’s why researchers are being forced to study on emission reduction technologies and to find more environment-friendly alternative, clean, renewable fuels without modifying the engine [3]. Biofuels are alternative energy sources which have big potential to replace fossil fuels. They offer a set of advantages such as renewability, sustainability, greenhouse gas emission reduction and regional development etc. [4]. Biodiesel is prominent among all biofuels since their very similar fuel properties with diesel fuel which enable to use of them with little or no engine modifications [5]. The advantages of biodiesel in comparison with petro-diesel fuel are being sulfur free, oxygenated, environmentally-friendly, having high flash point (important for storage), biodegradability, releasing lower emissions, various kinds of feedstock occasions for production such as vegetable, algal, microbial and waste oils, animal fats [6]. Beside these certain advantages there are also some drawbacks of biodiesel usage. Poor cold flow properties and spray characteristics, higher viscosity, having less heating value, higher NOx emission levels, losses of engine power, increment in BSFC can be stated as major disadvantages of them [7,8]. As stated previously, reduced fuel economy, high viscosity, poor atomization of fuel, increased NOx emission levels and cold starting problems are major issues of biodiesel fuel to be tackled. Nanoparticles are very attractive among other additives which can help the improvement of performance and emission characteristics of engine [9–11]. Metal-based (reduces viscosity and pour point, increases flash point), oxygen-containing (affects fuel properties, improves combustion due to oxygen content), antioxidant (improves oxygen stability, increase cetane number and flash point, decrease calorific value) and cetane improver additives (enhance ignition delay) can be used to enhance quality of biodiesel fuel [12]. On the other hand, both energy problems over the world and environmental concerns make hydrogen another major potential energy source in order to replace fossil fuels. Lack of carbon atom and only water release as a result of the reaction makes hydrogen an ideal energy source of future. Hydrogen energy can be utilized in two ways in vehicles: fuel cells and direct hydrogen usage in engine. Direct usage of hydrogen in internal combustion engines seems as more preferable with respect to fuel cells from the standpoint of reliability and low-cost [13]. Hydrogen seldom exists alone in spite of it is the most abundant element in universe. Therefore, hydrogen production can be achieved by extracting it from the compounds of them [14]. Hydrogen production methods are listed into four main categories; electrolysis, photolysis, biolysis and thermolysis [15]. As biodiesel, hydrogen is also renewable, non-toxic and biodegradable energy source and direct use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines helps to enhance the performance of engine due to having high calorific value (three times heat release per unit mass more than gasoline) which results in releasing more energy during combustion [16,17]. Besides having high calorific value, high diffusivity, smaller quenching distance, higher flame speed and wide range of flammability are the other notable benefits of hydrogen use in compression ignition engines [18]. Despite having these remarkable advantages, it is not suggested to use as a primary fuel in engines due to having high self-ignition temperatures (576–585 °C) which additionally requires heated air or glow plug in order to start the combustion in combustion chamber. That’s why usage of hydrogen as a secondary fuel, in other words, in a dual mode will give more effective results rather than solely utilization [18,19]. Furthermore, hydrogen negatively affects NOx formation since increased temperature levels in cylinder due to its higher flammability levels and faster flame propagation characteristics [20]. It is also well-known from the literature that NOx formation is highly affected by oxygen concentration, reaction temperature and residence time [21–23]. Although performance, emission and combustion characteristics of various fuel and additive combinations of diesel–biodiesel, diesel-hydrogen, biodiesel-hydrogen, diesel-alcohol, biodiesel-alcohol, diesel-nanoparticle, biodiesel-nanoparticle [24–40] have mostly been studied by researchers, there are just a few studies [41,42] which investigate the effects of hydrogen and nanoparticle addition together into diesel-biodiesel blends together to eliminate drawbacks of biodiesel usage and to improve performance, emission and combustion characteristics of biodiesel operated diesel engine. Based on the above evaluations, this study experimentally concentrates on the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine operated by hydrogen enriched pure soybean biodiesel and diesel-soybean biodiesel blends with Al2O3 nanoparticle addition."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Biodiesel production,"2.1 Biodiesel production In biodiesel production by transesterification method, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and methanol (CH3OH) was selected as catalyst and alcohol. NaOH was dissolved in CH3OH in order to produce a homogenous mixture for the conversion reaction. Soybean oil was heated up to 65 °C in a flask and previously prepared alcohol-catalyst mixture was added in a same flask. New blend was mixed continuously with a magnetic stirrer for about 1 h and temperature was kept constant at about 60–65 °C. At the end of the reaction, biodiesel was waited in a separation funnel for 8 h to extract glycerine from bottom of funnel by the help of phase difference. After washing step was finalized, soybean biodiesel was sent to drying and filtering processes in order to purify the fuel before storage."
3,Test fuel preparation and determination of physicochemical properties,"2.2 Test fuel preparation and determination of physicochemical properties Fuels used in experiments were given in Table 1 . Pure diesel was selected as reference fuel. Al2O3 as additive in powder form was purchased from a commercial firm. 50 ppm dosage of Al2O3 nanoparticle was added into both pure soybean biodiesel and diesel-soybean biodiesel blends in order to see the effects on engine characteristics. Sonic Vibra-Cell VC 750 model ultrasonic processor was utilized in order to obtain homogenous dispersion of nanoparticles in fuels. Additionally, blends were enriched with hydrogen at rates of 5 l/min hydrogen flow rate. Furthermore, determination of fuel properties has crucial importance for both usability of fuels and the interpretation of performance and emission results. In Table 2 , fuel properties such as viscosity, density, cetane number, calorific value and flash point were determined, summarized and evaluated whether they meet the standards or not. Devices used for analyses can be listed as; Zeltex ZX440 for cetane number, IKA-Werke C2000 bomb calorimeter for calorific value, Kyoto electronics DA-130 for density, Saybolt universal viscosimeter for viscosity and Tanaka automated Pensky–Martens closed cup Flash Point tester APM-7 for flash point."
4,Experimental test rig and procedure,"2.3 Experimental test rig and procedure Experiments were achieved on a naturally aspirated, 4-stroke, 4 cylinder direct injection diesel engine coupled with hydraulic dynamometer. MRU Delta 1600 V emission analyser was utilized for emission detection. All experiments were conducted at Laboratories of Automotive Engineering Department of Çukurova University. Technical specifications of engine and dynamometer were provided within Tables 3 and 4 . Fig. 1 demonstrates the engine schematic. The test engine was operated 15 min before each experiment in order to get stable conditions and to get rid of remaining fuel from previous experiment at fuel line. At full load condition, test fuels were run between 1200 rpm and 2800 rpm engine speeds by 400 rpm intervals. Engine tests for each fuel were repeated three times and the average of results was noted at identical conditions. To ensure the accuracy of the measurements, the gas analyser was calibrated before each emission tests."
5,Uncertainty analysis,"2.4 Uncertainty analysis The uncertainty analysis recommended by Holman [43] was used in this study. Analysis was conducted based on below equations: R = R x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , ⋯ , x n w R = ∂ R ∂ x 1 w 1 2 + ∂ R ∂ x 2 w 2 2 + ⋯ + ∂ R ∂ x n w n 2 where; R , from x 1 to x n , w R and from w 1 to w n are result function, independent variables, result function uncertainty and independent variables uncertainties, respectively. For instance, an uncertainty value of power was calculated with the following formulations: P = 2 π N T 60 ( W ) w P = ∂ P ∂ N w N 2 + ∂ P ∂ T w T 2 = 2 π T 60 w N 2 + 2 π N 60 w T 2 where; N , T , w N and w T are engine speed, torque, uncertainty of engine speed and uncertainty of torque, respectively. Following Table 5 summarized the analysis results."
6,Results and discussions,
7,Performance characteristics,"3.1 Performance characteristics Power variations with engine speed were given in the following Fig. 2 . B100 exhibited worst performance characteristics of all. Weak engine performance behaviour can be attributed to having poor spray characteristics due to higher viscosity and lower energy content of biodiesel [44]. Low cetane number of biodiesel can be another potential reason in order to obtain poorer engine performance since cetane number is the indicator of ignition quality which affects the ignition delay period of diesel combustion [45]. Reductions on power level with the use of B20 and B100 with respect to diesel fuel can be explained with the above reasons. Experiments depicted that nanoparticle addition can enhance the power values. On the other hand, further improvement on power was achieved by use of hydrogen enriched fuels. Advances on power by using nanoparticle can be clarified with increase in oxidation rate and catalyst effect of nanoparticle [46,47]. Further improvements can be explained by higher energy content and faster flame speed of hydrogen which promotes better combustion [21,48]. B20-A and H-B20-A gave the best outcomes among all fuels in terms of power level. On the other hand, although B100-A and H-B100-A provide better power performance than B100, they were not able to reach diesel power level in average. BSFC can be explained as the amount of fuel consumed by engine in order to get unit power and it is very useful parameter for comparative analyses. Fuel consumption to obtain same power gives valuable information regarding fuel economy. In comparison to diesel fuel, B20 and B100 increased BSFC value and low calorific value of biodiesel may possibly cause it. It means more clearly that there will be more fuel requirement to be injected in order to preserve same power level [49]. BSFC can be reduced with use of nanoparticle and further reduction can be obtained by introducing hydrogen as secondary fuel. Increased level of BSFC compared to diesel fuel with use of B20 and B100 with parallel to above reasons can be enhanced with nanoparticle additive and hydrogen supplementation through engine. B20-A and H-B20-A gives best BSFC values of all test fuels. On the other hand, although B100-A and H-B100-A fuels show improvement on BSFC compared to B100, these fuels are not satisfactory by means of BSFC against diesel fuel. Deterioration on BSFC due to calorific value of biodiesel usage can be enhanced with nanoparticle use. Oxygen promoting and combustion catalyst effects of nanoparticle further help to obtain high temperature and pressure in cylinder which results in less fuel consumption [47]. Hydrogen addition since superior characteristics of it such as high heating value, high flame speed, short quenching distance and wider flammability range which helps more complete combustion [50]. High calorific value of hydrogen rises up the temperature of the gases in cylinder and this promotes speed up combustion process which results increased mean indicated pressure and reduced BSFC [51]. BSFC variations with engine speed were shown in the following Fig. 3 . Following Table 6 summarizes the average changes (%) of power and BSFC values in comparison to diesel fuel."
8,Emission characteristics,"3.2 Emission characteristics CO, CO2 and NOx emission values were demonstrated in the following Figs. 4–6 . Incomplete combustion triggers the formation of CO. This gas is very notorious with being poisonous when inhaled. It is quite difficult to feel its presence in the environment since colourless and odourless characteristics of it [52]. B20 and B100 provided reduction of CO emission with respect to diesel fuel. This phenomenon can be caused by the extra oxygen content of biodiesel. Oxygen in structure of biodiesel contributes further oxidation of CO gases [53]. In comparison to diesel fuel, B20-A, H-B20-A, B100-A and H-B100-A perform reduction on CO. As said before, one of the main responsibilities for the formation of CO belongs to incomplete combustion. Thermal and combustion efficiency can also be improved by use of nanoparticles which have high catalytic activity since they have high ratio of surface/volume [54,55]. Enhancement on CO emission was observed with hydrogen addition due to increased hydrogen-carbon ratio, improved air/fuel mixing since more diffusive nature of hydrogen which promotes more homogenous mixture and shortened duration of combustion [56,57]. CO2 is one of the major compound of greenhouse gases and it has a negative influence on changing the climatic conditions. Increasing ratio of CO2 in the atmosphere cause to face with the vital problem of global warming which have immediately to be tackled by scientists to prevent inevitable and irrepressible problems for future. CO2 formation rises up typically with biodiesel usage in contrast to CO [58,59]. Inverse to CO, B20 and B100 caused to increment on CO2 formation compared to diesel due to better combustion provided by extra oxygen content in its structure. This trend is in accordance with literature [60]. CO2 level has increased with utilization of nanoparticle in B20-A and B100-A. As expected, nanoparticle will enhance combustion due to oxygen content of it and this phenomenon will lead to increase CO2 formation, dependently. But this increment may partially be compensated by hydrogen usage [61]. Rising levels in B20-A and B100-A can be diluted in H-B20-A and H-B100-A. The possible causes of falling down of CO2 levels can be expressed by lack of carbon atom in hydrogen, increased hydrogen/carbon ratio, lessened duration of combustion and enhanced combustion efficiency [62,63]. In other words, availability of carbon content in the combustion is reduced by use of hydrogen [21]. Although the use of biodiesel in diesel engines causes to release more CO2 emissions as a result of combustion process, closed carbon life-cycle of biodiesel reveals that net CO2 emissions are lowered since plants have need it for photosynthesis [64,65]. NOx is one of the combustion related emission released by diesel engines. It has strong unfavourable effects on both human health and environment. That’s why efforts on reduction of it have crucial importance. Pressure in cylinder, temperature of combustion, air/fuel ratio, duration of combustion, humidity and oxygen content of fuel both affects the formation of NOx emission [18,66,67]. Use of B20 and B100 has caused increment on NOx with respect to diesel fuel. As commonly seen from the literature [68,69], providing extra oxygen in structure of biodiesel promotes more completed burning and dependently higher in cylinder temperatures. On the other hand, in comparison to diesel fuel, both nanoparticle addition and hydrogen bring about to increase NOx formation in B20-A, H-B20-A, B100-A and H-B100-A fuels. The possible reasons on NOx formation to rise up may be both having higher flame temperature of hydrogen in cylinder and catalytic activity of nanoparticles which cause elevated peak cylinder temperatures [70,71]. Following Table 7 summarizes the average changes (%) of CO, CO2, and NOx values in comparison to diesel fuel."
9,Conclusions,"This experimental study presents following remarks as conclusion: • In comparsion to diesel; H-B20-A was the best of all fuels with 6.64% increment in power and 2.72% decrement in BSFC. Worst performance was exhibited by B100 with 17% reduction in power and 11.8% increase in BSFC. • From the CO emission view, diesel fuel showed poorer characteristic. Besides that, H-B100-A displayed most reduction compared to diesel fuel by 15.91%. Least CO2 emission was released by diesel fuel as best characteristic of all. On the other hand, B100-A emitted 34.92% more CO2 than diesel as worst fuel. From the NOx emission view, diesel fuel showed best characteristic with least release while H-B100-A displayed most increment compared to diesel fuel by 37.68%. • Soybean biodiesel usage impairs the performance characteristics of the engine because of some certain characteristics of it such as lower calorific value and cetane number, higher viscosity. • Weakened engine performance depending on biodiesel usage can be recovered and enhanced by the help of both nanoparticle additive and hydrogen. • CO emission have been improved with biodiesel, nanoparticle additive and hydrogen. • Adverse to CO formation, CO2 release was increased with biodiesel. Nanoparticle additive have further contributed CO2 formation. Rise up on CO2 can be reduced with hydrogen feeding. • NOx emission have been augmented with biodiesel, nanoparticle additive and hydrogen. • Although the drawbacks of biodiesel and nanoparticle usage can be compansated by hydrogen utilization, considerable amount of rise in NOx emission couldn’t be prevented. That’s why as future recommendation for this kind of combined fuels and additives, a NOx emission reduction method can be applied to engine such as exhaust gas recirculation, lean NOx trap etc. in order to most effective use."
