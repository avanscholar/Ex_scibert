0,Introduction,"Composite photocatalysts have been recognized as an attractive configuration because of their potential applications in solar cells, water splitting, organic decomposition and electrochromic devices [1–9]. In particular, CdS has ideal band gap energy (2.4eV) and band positions that can drive both oxidation and reduction of water under visible light irradiation. CdS has been combined with other materials such as ZnO, TiO2 and LaMnO3 or intercalated into layered compounds [10–16] in attempt to improve the photo-efficiency and photo-stability. Among several configurations, a composite system consisting of CdS nanoparticles and TiO2 nanotubes has been reported in order to maximize the interfacial areas and physical or chemical contact between the two compounds [17–23]. Li et al. [17] reported TiO2 nanotube-supported CdS and ZnS heterostructure synthesized via a simple wet chemical process and investigated the photocatalytic performance for decomposition of methyl orange. Kim et al. [18] synthesized a new composite material consisting of CdS nanoparticles and TiO2 nanotube and employed a bi-functional organic molecule to bind CdS strongly to TiO2 surface. Chen et al. [21] synthesized CdS nanoparticle-modified TiO2 nanotube-array photoelectrodes via anodizaiton and electrodeposition method. Kim et al. [18] fabricated ordered TiO2 based composite (TiO2–CdS) nanotube array using a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly process. To the best of our knowledge, there was no report on the fabrication of CdS/TiO2 composite based on CdS nanowire and TiO2 nanoparticles, nor its photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production under visible light. Recently, we have found that the fabrication method of these composite photocatalysts is critical for their performance [5]. We also synthesized quasi-one-dimensional CdS nanowires via a solvothermal route in ethylenediamine as single solvent and evaluated their photoelectrochemical property as well as photoactivity for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm) [24]. CdS nanowires with high crystallinity and large surface area are a good candidate as an active material for composite configuration. In this work, we fabricate a composite photocatalyst consisting of CdS nanowire (NW) with a high crystallinity decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles (NP), and evaluate its photoactivity for hydrogen production from aqueous solution containing hole scavengers such as sulfide and sulfite under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm)."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials preparation,"2.1 Materials preparation In a typical procedure, 16.2mmol of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 48.6mmol NH2CSNH2 was added into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave which had been filled with ethylenediamine to 80% of its capacity. The autoclave was maintained at 160°C for 48h for solvothermal reaction and allowed to cool to room temperature. The colored precipitate was filtered and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water to remove the residue of organic solvent [24]. To fabricate the CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalyst, the obtained 0.5g CdS NW was stirred in 50ml isopropyl alcohol and 0.25g titanium isopropoxide (in a mole ratio of CdS to TiO2 from 0 to 4) and 0.623g H2O were added drop-by-drop [5,15]. The prepared composite sample was solvothermally treated in an autoclave at 423K for 24h to improve the contact between two components and to increase the crystallinity of TiO2. All procedures for catalyst preparation are schematically shown in Fig. 1A."
3,Characterizations,"2.2 Characterizations The crystalline phases of the products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a diffractometer (Mac Science Co., M18XHF) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 200mA. The optical property was analyzed by UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV 2401). The morphology of photocatalysts was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4200) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2010F, Field Emission Electron Microscope) operated at 200kV. The chemical states of sulfur in the samples were determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS VG Scientific, ESCALAB 220iXL) using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6eV). The binding energy calibration was performed using C1s peak in the background as the reference energy (284.6eV). The BET surface area was evaluated by N2 adsorption in a constant volume adsorption apparatus (Micrometrics, ASAP 2012)."
4,Photocatalytic reactions,"2.3 Photocatalytic reactions The photocatalytic reactions were carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure in a closed reactor system using an Hg-arc lamp (450W) equipped with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥420nm). Before reaction, 1wt% of Pt was deposited on photocatalysts by photodeposition method under visible light (λ ≥420nm). The rate of H2 evolution was determined in an aqueous solution (100ml) containing 0.1g catalyst and 0.1M Na2S+0.02M Na2SO3. The evolved amounts of H2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (TCD, molecular sieve 5-Å column and Ar carrier)."
5,Results and discussion,"The optimized preparation condition and characterization procedure of CdS nanowires (NW) have been described elsewhere [24]. The CdS NW as a visible light absorber component in composite photocatalyst was solvothermally synthesized at 160°C for 48h. Fig. 1B shows X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples prepared with different molar concentrations of TiO2 in CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalysts. When the mole ratio of TiO2 NP to CdS NW was increased, (101) plane of TiO2 anatase phase became clearer around 2θ =25.3° in XRD pattern as noted by a vertical line. The CdS NW showed well-developed hexagonal phase both in single and composite photocatalysts and TiO2 was in the anatase phase in the composite photocatalyst. The crystallinity of CdS in CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalyst was as good as the single CdS NW, considering its concentration (30wt%) in the composite. The diffuse reflection spectra for these photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . The CdS NW photocatalyst showed a sharp edge at 520nm. The spectra of CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalysts showed a combination of the two spectra coming from CdS NW and TiO2 NP. But, when the mole ratio of TiO2 to CdS is 0.33 or more, the spectra contributed by TiO2 NP in composite was clearly appeared as shown in Fig. 2(c, d). These results are well in accordance with those of XRD patterns. The morphology of CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalysts was observed by SEM and TEM images as shown in Fig. 3 . CdS NW sample solvothermally synthesized at 160°C for 48h showed the morphology of nanowires with a length of ca. 2–3μm and a diameter of ca. 50nm in Fig. 3(a). The dimensions were highly uniform among individual nanowires and the cross-section of nanowire was in a hexagonal shape (not shown here) [24]. For CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite, CdS NW of ca. 2–3μm was decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 10nm. This clearly defined geometry of nanoparticles in contact with a nanowire is schematically shown in insert of Fig. 3(b). Note that TiO2 particles would form random multiple particle layers on CdS nanowire surface as discussed in our previous works [5,15]. The surface sulfur species was analyzed by XPS before photoreaction as shown in Fig. 4 . The S2p peaks indicated that CdS NW and CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite contained SO4 2− as an impurity as well as sulfide (S2−) species on its surface. Generally, CdS can be oxidized to CdO and CdSO4 as impurity phases and they can decrease the photoactivity. Especially, CdO inhibits H2 production because the conduction band position of CdO is more positive than the redox potential of H+/H2. CdSO4 also decreases visible light absorption of CdS [25]. Also, this surface oxidation may be responsible for the induction period as discussed below. In the previous work, we investigated the location of Pt cocatalysts by TEM images obtained after Pt deposition on bulk CdS-nano TiO2 composite [9]. From TEM images and EDAX analysis, it was confirmed that Pt cocatalysts were randomly located on both nanosized TiO2 and bulk CdS particles. In the present work, we also investigated where the Pt cocatalysts were located. Thus, TEM images were obtained after Pt deposition on CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite. As shown in TEM images in Fig. 5 , Pt cocatalysts are randomly located on both nanosized TiO2 (a) as well as CdS nanowires (b). Fig. 6A shows the effect of the mole ratio of [TiO2]/[TiO2]+[CdS] for hydrogen production from an aqueous solution containing 0.1M Na2S and 0.02M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (λ ≥420nm). The surface area of CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite linearly increases with increase of the concentration of TiO2. But, the molar concentration of TiO2 in CdS NW/TiO2 NP that showed the highest activity for H2 evolution was determined to be 0.2. Note that this molar ratio for activity has no correlation with the surface area of the composite as shown in Fig. 6A. Thus, an optimum coverage of TiO2 NP decorating CdS NW is needed for effective and fast charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and thus to increase the photocatalytic activity. But too high a coverage would hinder the contact of electrolyte and CdS surface responsible for hole scavenging. The time-dependence of H2 production was also measured for [TiO2]/[TiO2]+[CdS] of (a) 0.0 (CdS only) and (b) 0.2 samples under visible light irradiation with cut-off filter (λ ≥420nm) as shown in Fig. 6B. The photocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution was linearly increased with the reaction time for 3h except for a brief induction period. As discussed above, the oxidation of surface CdS species to CdO or CdSO4 may be responsible for this induction period [5]. In any case, the photocatalyst remains stable under the present reaction conditions. In our previous works [5,15], it was reported that CdS(bulk)/TiO2 composite photocatalyst showed a high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from electrolyte solution containing sulfide and sulfite as sacrificial reagents under visible right irradiation (λ ≥420nm). The activity was much higher than that of single CdS photocatalyst having a high crystallinity, and those of composite photocatalysts of different configurations, i.e. nano-CdS/bulk-TiO2 or nano-TiO2/nano-CdS. Although CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite did not show a dramatic improvement of photocatalytic activity, the configuration of CdS nanowire decorated with TiO2 nanoparticle led to increase in photocatalytic activity from that of CdS nanowire alone. However, CdS NW/TiO2 NP showed considerably lower activity compared with those for CdS(bulk)/TiO2 NP composite photocatalysts [5,15]. One reason for the lower activity for hydrogen production could be lower crystallinity of CdS NW. Although the CdS NW showed a relatively good crystallinity as a nanoscale material as shown in Fig. 1, it was still much less crystalline than bulk CdS prepared at high temperatures. The crystallinity of CdS was found to be the most important variable for high activity [5]. Indeed, it was found that CdS nanowire or composite calcined at 400°C after hydrothermal treatment showed higher rate of hydrogen production than that of uncalcined samples. The high activity of the composite photocatalyst is considered to be due to a fast charge separation. Thus upon initial light absorption, difference in the positions of conduction bands drives photoelectrons generated in CdS NW to surrounding TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in a schematic model in Fig. 7 . The holes remain in CdS NW and react with hole scavengers of sulfide and sulfite ions. In order for this system to function efficiently, quality of individual components as well as the close contact between two compounds should be important."
6,Conclusions,"The CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalyst based on CdS nanowires with high crystallinity decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles has been successfully fabricated via solvothermal and sol–gel method to develop a highly active photocatalyst for hydrogen production from water containing sulfide and sulfite ions as hole scavengers under visible light irradiation. The molar concentration of TiO2 in CdS NW/TiO2 NP composite photocatalyst that showed the highest activity for H2 evolution was determined to be 0.2. This configuration of photocatalyst results in an efficient charge separation, caused by fast diffusion of photoelectrons generated from CdS NW toward surrounding TiO2 NP, leading to high photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production."
