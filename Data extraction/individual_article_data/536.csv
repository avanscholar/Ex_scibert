0,Introduction,"In view of developing green and sustainable chemistry, photocatalytic organic transformation via the utilization of clean and inexhaustible solar energy is a promising alternative to the conventional thermal-driven chemical reactions [1–3]. Among them, photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde has received extensive concern due to the important roles of benzaldehyde in synthesizing pharmaceuticals, vitamins, fragrances and other valuable chemicals [4–6]. In the reported studies on photocatalytic benzyl alcohol transformation, molecular oxygen (O2) is most involved as an oxidant to accelerate the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by trapping photoinduced electrons [4–7]. In contrast, the involvement of hydrogen protons instead of O2 for the reduction half-reaction can not only effectively utilize the photogenerated electrons and holes but also enable the simultaneous production of H2 fuel and benzaldehyde [8–10]. Therefore, the photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde accompanied with H2 evolution under anaerobic conditions is a favorable strategy to improve the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy by making full use of photogenerated electrons and holes. The design and synthesis of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for such a reaction system is highly desired but still remains a challenging task. Among available semiconductors, cadmium sulfide (CdS) materials have received extensive consideration for photocatalytic selective organic transformations [3] and H2 production [11–13]. Whereas, the photocatalytic activity of pristine CdS is unsatisfactory due to the limited light absorption, rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. Constructing metal–semiconductor heterostructures affords an effective strategy to facilitate the spatial separation of photoexcited holes and electrons [14–16]. In particular, the integration of semiconductors with plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) into the heterostructures is attractive because the significant light-harvesting ability of plasmonic metal (Au, Ag etc.) NPs can remarkably improve the photocatalytic efficiency through the mechanisms of plasmon‐induced electromagnetic field enhancement, hot electron injection or/and resonance energy transfer at the metal/semiconductor interface [17–19]. By taking advantage of these properties, some plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructures have been constructed and applied in various photocatalytic reactions [20–23]. To maximize the plasmonic enhancement of the photoexcitation in the semiconductor, the spectral overlap between the photoabsorption of semiconductor and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal NPs is commonly required [24–26]. Moreover, the morphology of the heterostructures is also a decisive factor because the local electric field enhancement stemmed from LSPR decays nearly exponentially away from the metal surface and extends up to 10 nm to 50 nm [17,27,28]. Among various metal/semiconductor heterostructures, the core–shell nanostructures built by encapsulating plasmonic metal NPs with semiconductor shells afford a maximized and intimate interface between metal and semiconductor, which favors the plasmon‐induced electromagnetic field enhancement and charge/energy transfer [24,29,30]. Therefore, the construction of Au@CdS core–shell heterostructures is expected to obtain the improved photocatalysis owing to the plasmonic enhancement and the interfacial charge separation. Additionally, metal cocatalysts have played essential roles in enhancing the performance of semiconductor photocatalysts [9,31–33]. With Fermi energy levels lower than those of most semiconductors, transition metal cocatalysts can serve as electron traps to remarkably improve the separation efficiency of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs [34,35]. Moreover, some of the transition metal cocatalysts (Pt, Ni etc.) can dramatically reduce the overpotential of H2 evolution and thus boost the photocatalytic reaction [32,33,35,36]. In the plasmonic metal/semiconductor photocatalysts, loading a metal cocatalyst on the semiconductor would direct the migration of photoinduced electrons generated from both plasmonic metal and semiconductor, and afford the highly active sites for proton reduction as well [37–39]. Among various transition metal cocatalysts for H2 evolution, nickel (Ni) is always attractive due to its distinct merits of low cost, nontoxicity, and good stability. Therefore, anchoring Ni NPs on the surface of Au@CdS core–shell heterostructures can utilize the synergy of plasmonic effect and metal cocatalyst to greatly promote the photocatalytic reaction. Herein, we constructed the Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures modified with a small quantity of Ni NPs (labeled as Ni/(Au@CdS)) as an efficient photocatalyst for the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2. The optimal Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst exhibited the outstanding performance, attaining the production rates of benzaldehyde and H2 to be 4.24 and 3.88 mmol·g−1·h−1, respectively, which are 4.87 and 8.43 times those from pure CdS photocatalyst. The systematic characterizations and experiments have elucidated the synergy of plasmonic effect and metal cocatalyst in enhancing the photocatalysis. The plasmonic effect of Au-nanosphere cores could boost the generation and separation of photoexcited charge carriers in CdS shell. Meanwhile, the Ni NPs anchored on CdS shell could not only serve as electron traps to manipulate the charge migration but also afford the excellent active sites for H2 evolution."

The chemicals were used without further purification except that the CTAB aqueous solution was filtered to remove insoluble impurities before use."
3,Synthesis of Au nanospheres and Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures,"2.2 Synthesis of Au nanospheres and Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures The Au nanospheres were synthesized via a previously reported seed-induced growth method with minor modifications [40], and the details are described in Supporting Information. The Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures were synthesized by a hydrothermal process. Typically, 0.8 mL of the concentrated Au nanosphere aqueous solution was injected into 4.0 mL CTAB aqueous solution (0.1 M), followed by the additions of deionized water (10 mL), AA aqueous solution (560 μL, 0.1 M), Cd(Ac)2 aqueous solution (560 μL, 0.1 M) and thiourea aqueous solution (840 μL, 0.1 M) under continuous stirring. The final solution was transferred into a 50 mL hydrothermal autoclave, which was sealed and kept at 120 ℃ for 5 h. After cooled to room temperature, the solid particles (Au@CdS nanostructures) were collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven."
4,Synthesis of Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures,"2.3 Synthesis of Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures The Ni/(Au@CdS) ternary nanostructures were prepared by loading Ni NPs on the surface of Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures via a photodeposition method. Typically, 30 mg of the Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures was ultrasonically dispersed in 30 mL methanol to form a suspension, followed by adding a certain amount of NiCl2·6H2O. After bubbling pure N2 gas in the suspension to remove air and stirring for 30 min in dark, the suspension was exposed to the UV–visible irradiation of a Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight) with optical power density of 200 mW·cm−2 for 1 h. Finally, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in vacuum, obtaining the Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures. By changing the dosage of NiCl2·6H2O for the photodeposition, the theoretical Ni content in the Ni/(Au@CdS) ternary nanostructures was tuned to be 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0 wt%, respectively."
5,Synthesis of CdS and Ni/CdS hollow nanospheres,"2.4 Synthesis of CdS and Ni/CdS hollow nanospheres Pure CdS hollow nanospheres were synthesized by a similar hydrothermal process to the synthesis of Au@CdS nanostructures, in the absence of Au nanospheres. The Ni modified CdS hollow nanospheres (Ni/CdS) were prepared by loading Ni NPs on the surface of CdS hollow nanospheres via the photodeposition method."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization The actual Ni loading of Ni/(Au@CdS) sample was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, thermo ICAP-Q). The crystalline phases, morphologies, microstructures and element distributions of samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS Ultra-55) and transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL-2100) with energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and the binding energies were calibrated internally by the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with BaSO4 as a reference. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a HORIBA fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer with using an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were acquired according to the time-dependent single photon counting method on the Edinburgh FS5 fluorescence spectrometer. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were measured on a Bruker model JEOL JES-FA200 spectrometer, with 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a radical-trapping reagent."
7,Photocatalytic performance tests,"2.6 Photocatalytic performance tests The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared materials was evaluated by the photocatalytic selective transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2 under anaerobic conditions, which was carried out in an automatic online analysis system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight) under the visible irradiation (λ > 420 nm, 200 mW·cm−2) from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300) equipped with an ultraviolet cut-off filter. For a typical reaction, 5 mg photocatalyst is ultrasonically dispersed into 30 mL benzyl alcohol. The suspension was stirred in dark for 30 min, vacuumized to thoroughly remove air, and then exposed to the visible irradiation. During the photocatalytic reaction, the gas product was analyzed quantitatively by a gas chromatograph (GC 9790 II, FuLi) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and argon as a carrier gas. The products in solution were identified by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu LC-2030 Plus) with a UV detector at 256 nm, using the mixture of 25 vol% acetonitrile and 75 vol% water as the mobile phase. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst for the photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol was determined as described in Supporting Information."
8,Photoelectrochemical measurements,"2.7 Photoelectrochemical measurements The photoelectrochemical tests were conducted in a three-electrode system by the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E), with a Pt wire as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 4 mg catalyst, 10 μL naphthol and 390 μL ethanol were mixed by ultrasonic to form suspension. Then 100 μL of the suspension was coated onto a pre-cleaned FTO glass (1 × 2 cm) and dried naturally. The photoelectrochemical properties of the working electrode were measured under the irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm) or monochromatic light (λ = 600 nm), respectively. The Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M) without or with adding 1 mL benzyl alcohol was used as the electrolyte. When the Na2SO4 aqueous solution with adding 1 mL benzyl alcohol was used as the electrolyte, a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode."
9,Results and discussion,"The synthesis of Ni/(Au@CdS) ternary core–shell photocatalyst is schematically described in Fig. 1 a. The Au nanospheres stabilized with CTAB in aqueous solution were used as cores to prepare the Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures via ascorbic acid (AA) induced deposition of CdS shell, where AA molecules can combine with Cd2+ ions to form AA-Cd2+ complex and then interact with CTAB for carrying the metallic ions towards the Au nanospheres for the growth of CdS shells via the hydrothermal process. The bare Au nanospheres have an average diameter of ~ 20.54 nm (Fig. 1b) and exhibit the ensemble plasmon peak at 523 nm in aqueous solution (Fig. S1a, Supporting Information). After coating CdS, the plasmon peak shifts towards the longer wavelength centered at 607 nm, due to the increase in the refractive index of the surrounding medium of Au nanospheres [41]. Under the SEM and TEM observations (Fig. 1c and d), the Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures present uniform spherical shapes with an average size of ~ 68.64 nm, and no bare Au nanospheres or self-nucleated CdS nanoparticles were produced, confirming the high validity of the present method for preparing Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures. The CdS shells with thicknesses about 24.05 nm are built by numerous nanoparticles and exhibit a porous structure. In addition, the pure CdS sample (Fig. S2a-c, Supporting Information) synthesized in the absence of Au nanospheres present the morphology of hollow nanospheres with an average diameter of ~ 292 nm. Subsequently, the Ni/(Au@CdS) ternary core–shell nanostructures were prepared by photoinduced deposition of Ni NPs on the surface of Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures, which was conducted in N2 atmosphere with methanol as a hole sacrificial agent. This method has the distinct advantages of preventing the size of Ni NPs from becoming too large and making them controllably anchored on the Au@CdS nanostructures [42]. Both SEM and TEM observations (Fig. 1e and f) indicate that the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample possesses the similar core–shell spherical structures and sizes to those of the Au@CdS nanostructures. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1g) taken from a Ni/(Au@CdS) core–shell nanostructure shows the interplanar spacings of 0.33 and 0.36 nm which belong to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of hexagonal CdS, respectively. Whereas, the lattice of Ni is hardly seen due to its very low content and very small size in the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample. In a close HRTEM observation on the shell of a Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructure (Figs. S2d-f), the interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm is assignable to the (010) lattice plane of hexagonal Ni, and the size of Ni NPs is estimated to be about 1.23 nm. The STEM image and EDS elemental analysis (Fig. 1h) demonstrate the distributions of Au, Cd, S, and Ni elements in a Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructure, where Au distributes mainly in the core while Cd, S and Ni spread over the shell. The element mappings further confirm the core–shell structure of Au@CdS and the uniform loading of Ni NPs. The diffraction peaks of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS no. 06–314) are well identified in the XRD patterns (Fig. S1b) of CdS, Ni/CdS, Au@CdS, Ni/(Au@CdS) samples, and the diffraction peak belonging to the (111) plane of cubic Au (JCPDS no. 04–784) is observable in the XRD patterns of Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) samples. Whereas, the diffraction peaks of Ni NPs cannot be observed in the XRD patterns of Ni/CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) because of the low content and high dispersity of Ni NPs in the samples [35,43]. The elements and chemical states on the surface of Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures were identified by XPS analysis. XPS spectra of Ni/(Au@CdS) samples with the theoretical Ni contents of 1 wt% and 5 wt% are shown in Fig. S3 (Supporting Information) and Fig. 2 , respectively. The XPS survey spectra (Fig. S3a and Fig. 2a) of both the Ni/(Au@CdS) samples present the obvious signals of Cd and S, but the signals of Au and Ni elements are hard to observe because the Au cores are covered by thick CdS shell and the contents of Ni element are actually very low. The actual Ni content in 1 wt% Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst was detected to be 0.11 wt% by ICP-MS analysis. In the high-resolution spectra of Cd 3d (Fig. S3b and Fig. 2b) and S 2p (Fig. S3c and Fig. 2c), the peaks with binding energies of 405.45 and 412.23 eV are attributable to the Cd2+ cations, and the peaks with binding energies of 161.99 and 163.22 eV belong to the S2- anions [44]. For the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample with theoretical Ni content of 1 wt%, no peak can be observed in the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. S3d). As the theoretical Ni content is increased to 5 wt%, two weak peaks appear in the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d), where the peak at 852.55 eV is assignable to metallic Ni and the one at 855.78 eV is attributable to Ni2+ cation due to residual NiCl2 on the catalyst surface [10]. The light-harvesting abilities of different photocatalysts including CdS, Ni/CdS, Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) were determined by UV–Vis DRS analyses. As shown in Fig. 3 a, both CdS and Ni/CdS samples exhibit the strong absorption in UV–visible spectral range less than 550 nm owing to the narrow bandgap of CdS that is inferred to be 2.32 eV (inset of Fig. 3a). Upon combining the Au nanospheres with CdS shell, the plasmonic effect extends the photoabsorption of photocatalysts to the whole visible region. As a result, both Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalysts exhibit the distinct abilities of light harvesting in the whole UV–visible spectral range. After coating CdS shell, the LSPR peak of Au nanospheres red shifts from 523 nm to 607 nm, which would enable the core–shell photocatalysts more effective in harvesting solar energy and generating more charge carriers [29]. Fig. 3b shows the Mott–Schottky (M−S) plots of different catalyst-based photoelectrodes recorded at the frequency of 1000 Hz, where the positive slopes of the linear regions suggest the characteristics of n-type semiconductor [36]. The M−S plots recorded at different frequencies (500, 1000, 1500 Hz) are shown in Fig. S4, confirming the high accuracy of the measured results. The flat band potentials of the CdS materials without and with introducing Au nanospheres are determined to be −1.02 and −0.91 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), respectively, by the tangent intercept of the M−S plots at x-axis. The flat band potentials can be converted into the corresponding values relative to normal hydrogen electrode as −0.82 and −0.71 V (vs. NHE), respectively. In comparison, the conduction band bottom of CdS coupled with Au cores is a little more negative than that of pure CdS, probably due to the formation of Schottky junction between Au core and CdS shell. Additionally, the loading of Ni NPs could not influence the band structure of CdS because the actual Ni content is very low. The elaborate design of Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures with plasmonic Au cores and Ni cocatalyst is expected to obtain the highly efficient photocatalysis. The performance of the as-prepared photocatalysts was evaluated by selective transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2. The typical photocatalytic reaction was carried out by the system of 5 mg photocatalyst dispersed in 30 mL benzyl alcohol under visible light (λ > 420 nm). Fig. S5 (Supporting Information) shows the HPLC original data of the reference solutions (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) and the diluted filtrates after photocatalytic reactions with four typical catalysts. The peak of benzoic acid or other by-products doesn’t appear in the HPLC spectra of the reaction filtrates, confirming the high selectivity of producing benzaldehyde. Fig. 4 a and Table S1 (Supporting Information) display the production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde as well as the selectivity for producing benzaldehyde in the presence of different photocatalysts. All the photocatalysts exhibit excellent selectivity (> 99%) for benzaldehyde production in the present case. The bare Au nanospheres and pure CdS hollow nanospheres present insufficient photocatalysis towards the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol. Additionally, the physical mixture of Au nanospheres and CdS hollow nanospheres (Au + CdS) barely improve the photocatalytic efficiency, compared with that of pure CdS hollow nanospheres. In contrast, the Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures exhibit a greatly improved photocatalysis to achieve the production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde being 1.51 and 1.83 mmol·g−1·h−1, which are 3.28 and 2.10 times those from pure CdS hollow nanospheres, respectively. The results demonstrate that the construction of Au@CdS core–shell nanostructures can effectively prevent the agglomeration-caused deactivation of Au nanospheres and provide the intimate interface between Au and CdS to maximize the plasmonic effect to enhance the photocatalysis. Furthermore, loading Ni NPs as a cocatalyst can promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers as well as reduce the overpotential for H2 evolution, thereby further improving the photocatalytic efficiency. As a result, the Ni-modified photocatalysts (Ni/CdS, Au + Ni/CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS)) show the higher activity than those of the counterparts without Ni modification (CdS, Au + CdS and Au@CdS). Among them, the Ni/(Au@CdS) ternary nanostructures exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity, achieving the production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde as high as 3.88 and 4.24 mmol·g−1·h−1, respectively. The production rates of H2 are slightly lower than those of benzaldehyde, possibly because the dissolved oxygen in benzyl alcohol or the oxygen species adsorbed on photocatalyst cannot be removed completely by the degassing process. The residual oxygen species consumes some of the photogenerated electrons, leading to a little lower production of H2. Similar results have been observed previously in the photocatalytic transformation of alcohols to aldehydes and H2 [45–47].The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst is up to 4.09% for the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol under the irradiation of 420 nm. The enhancement in the photocatalysis of semiconductor through the LSPR of plasmonic metal nanocrystals is generally attributed to the mechanisms of hot electron injection, local electromagnetic field enhancement, and resonance energy transfer [22,25,48]. In order to identify the action mechanism of plasmonic Au cores in enhancing the photocatalysis of Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures, the performance of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst was tested under different irradiations in comparison with that of Ni/CdS photocatalyst (Fig. 4b and Table S2). Under the irradiation of continuous visible spectrum (λ > 420 nm), where both Au cores and CdS shells can be excited, Ni/(Au@CdS) exhibits the much higher photocatalytic activity than Ni/CdS (I and II in Fig. 4b), indicating the distinct contribution of Au cores to improving the photocatalysis. However, Ni/(Au@CdS) and Ni/CdS show the comparable photocatalysis under the monochromatic light of 420 nm (III and IV in Fig. 4b), where CdS can be excited but Au cores cannot be. This result proves that the Au cores cannot contribute to the photocatalysis when the LSPR is unexcited. Additionally, when the LSPR of Au cores is excited but CdS does not generate the photoexcited charge carriers under the monochromatic light of 600 nm (V in Fig. 4b), the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst has no photocatalysis towards the transformation of benzyl alcohol, suggesting that the contribution of the hot charge carriers generated by LSPR effect to the photocatalytic reaction is very little [44]. Considering that there is some overlap in the LSPR band of Au cores and the absorption band of CdS shells in the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst, the plasmon induced resonance energy can enhance the photoexcitation of CdS shells to generate more electron-hole pairs. Meanwhile, the generation and separation of electron-hole pairs in CdS shell can be increased by the local electromagnetic field derived from the plasmonic effect of Au cores. Therefore, the enhanced photocatalysis of Ni/(Au@CdS) in comparison to that of Ni/CdS is mainly attributed to the resonance energy transfer from Au cores to CdS shells for generating more photoexcited charge carriers as well as the local electromagnetic field for promoting the separation of photogenerated electron-hole paris. In addition, the influence of the Ni content in Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures on photocatalytic activity was determined for further optimizing the photocatalysis (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). All the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalysts with varied theoretical Ni contents (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0 wt%) exhibit the higher activity than the Au@CdS photocatalyst without Ni loading. Among them, the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst with a theoretical 1.0 wt% Ni content shows the highest activity. As the Ni content is further increased, the photocatalytic activity falls, possibly because the excess Ni species has covered the active sites of CdS shell. Therefore, the synergistic action of plasmonic Au cores and appropriate Ni cocatalyst enables the Ni/(Au@CdS) nanostructures to be a high-efficiency photocatalyst for the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol. For the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst, the irradiation intensity of visible light has a distinct effect on both LSPR of Au cores and photoexcitation of CdS shells, and thus influences the photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 4c and Table S3, the performance of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst is continuously improved when the optical power density of the visible light (λ > 420 nm) is increased from 150 to 250 mW∙cm−2. The increased irradiation intensity could induce the generation of more charge carriers in CdS shells as well as the higher resonance energy and local electromagnetic field from Au cores, resulting in the enhanced photocatalysis for selective transformation of benzyl alcohol. The benzyl alcohol transformation cannot proceed when the reaction is carried out either in dark with Ni/(Au@CdS) catalyst or under the irradiation without any catalyst (Fig. 4d), confirming that the reaction is a photocatalytic process. In addition, the production rates of both H2 and benzaldehyde in the photocatalytic system with pure benzyl alcohol are remarkably higher than those from the benzyl alcohol aqueous solution (Fig. 4e), which is attributable to that the higher concentration of benzyl alcohol increases the reaction rate on the photocatalyst. Finally, the recyclability of the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst was evaluated by the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol with four consecutive cycles. As shown in Fig. 4f and Table S4, only a little decrease occurs in the production rates of H2 and benzaldehyde after four consecutive photocatalytic cycles. The slight decrease in photocatalytic activity may be caused by the mass loss and agglomeration of catalyst during the separation and re-dispersion for cycling test. Both the high activity and selectivity of the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst are well maintained after 20 h of the photocatalytic reaction. XPS spectra of the used Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst (Fig. S7) are almost identical to those of the fresh one, indicating that the photocorrosion of photocatalyst is well inhibited in the present reaction system. In order to reveal the excellent performance of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst, the generation and separation of photoinduced charge carriers were evaluated by measuring the photocurrent under different conditions. Fig. 5 a shows the photocurrent densities of different photocatalysts under λ > 420 nm visible light. Both Au@CdS and Ni/CdS photocatalysts show the enhanced photocurrent density compared with that of pure CdS nanospheres, indicating that either the plasmonic Au cores or the Ni cocatalyst can effectively promote the generation and/or separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Especially, the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst presents the highest photocurrent density, confirming that the plasmonic Au cores and Ni cocatalyst on CdS shells can synergistically enhance the generation and separation of photoinduced charge carriers by controlling the directional transfer of electrons. Furthermore, the photocurrent densities of different photocatalysts were measured under a monochromatic visible light of 600 nm (Fig. 5b). Neither pure CdS nor Ni/CdS photocatalyst exhibits photocurrent response under the monochromatic visible light, affirming that CdS could not be excited to generate the charge carriers under the irradiation of 600 nm. In contrast, both Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalysts produce the observable photocurrent signals under the monochromatic visible light of 600 nm, which provides some evidence for the plasmonic effect of Au cores in the core–shell photocatalysts. Moreover, the photocurrent density of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst is much higher than that of Au@CdS photocatalyst under the same irradiation, confirming the positive contribution of Ni cocatalyst in enhancing the separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons and holes. In addition, the photocurrent response of the different photocatalysts was measured under the visible light (λ > 420 nm) when 1 mL benzyl alcohol was added into the Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent signals of all the photocatalysts are remarkably enhanced in comparison to those measured in the absence of benzyl alcohol, which can be attributed to that benzyl alcohol can trap the holes and therefore efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers [33]. Subsequently, the charge transfer abilities of the photocatalysts were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under the irradiation of the visible light (λ > 420 nm). Under the same conditions, the semicircle radius of EIS Nyquist plots can reflect the charge transfer resistance of the electrode material. By comparison, the EIS Nyquist plot of the Ni/(Au@CdS) photoelectrode has a smaller semicircular radius than other photocatalyst-based electrodes (Fig. 5d), reflecting the higher ability of Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst for charge transfer. Additionally, the open-circuit potential decay curves (Fig. S8) indicate that the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst also exhibits a larger photovoltage and a longer electron, compared with the other samples of pure CdS, Ni/CdS and Au@CdS, confirming the more efficient separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs in Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst. The separation efficiency of photoexcited electrons and holes in the different photocatalysts was further evaluated by the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. 5e). At an excitation wavelength of 400 nm, the pure CdS sample exhibits a very strong emission band around 550 nm. In contrast, the fluorescence emissions of both Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) are almost completely quenched, indicating that the introduction of Au cores or/and Ni cocatalyst can effectively inhibit the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes [49]. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was further used to determine the photoexcited charge carrier dynamics of different photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 5f and Table S5, the fluorescence decay curves of all the photocatalysts can be fitted by the biexponential function: I t = A 1 exp - t / τ 1 + A 2 exp - t / τ 2 , where A i and τ i represent the fluorescence lifetime and weighting factor, respectively [50]. The average fluorescence lifetimes ( τ average ) of CdS, Ni/CdS, Au@CdS and Ni/(Au@CdS) samples are 2.20, 2.17, 1.96 and 1.93 ns, respectively. In the present case, the shorter PL lifetime should be attributed to the higher separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers due to the faster interfacial electron transfer [51]. In the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample, both the adjacent electromagnetic field enhancement resulted from LSPR of Au cores and the electron trapping ability of Ni NPs enable the effective separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, and thus the fluorescence lifetime of Ni/(Au@CdS) sample is further shortened. Subsequently, in order to determine the fluorescence lifetime of the photocatalyst under the relatively real condition of photocatalytic reaction, the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample was dispersed in benzyl alcohol for the TRPL measurement. As shown in Fig. S9, the fluorescence lifetime of the Ni/(Au@CdS) sample dispersed in benzyl alcohol is greatly reduced, compared to that of this sample in air. This result further proves that benzyl alcohol can effectively capture the photoexcited holes from Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst, and thereby greatly promotes the separation of photoinduced charge carriers. The active species generated during the photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol over the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst were identified by in situ ESR detection (Fig. 6 a). The ESR signal is hardly detected in dark. Under irradiation, the obvious signals with sextet peaks (♠) which are assignable to the DMPO-trapped carbon centered radicals are observed and the signal intensity increases along with the prolonged irradiation time [52]. The carbon-centered radicals are generally regarded as a key intermediate produced during the photocatalytic hole-activated oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In addition, the diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was employed to in situ detect the photocatalytic transformation of benzyl alcohol on Ni/(Au@CdS) catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks at 1245 cm−1 (◆) and 1668 cm−1 (▾) can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of the OH bond in benzyl alcohol and the CO bond in benzaldehyde, respectively [53,54]. As the irradiation time was prolonged, the peak intensity at 1245 cm−1 gradually decreases while that at 1668 cm−1 increases, confirming the continuous transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Based on the above results, the enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic selective transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2 over the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst is illustrated in Fig. 7 . Under visible light, the CdS shell is excited to generate electron-hole pairs, and meanwhile the hot electron–hole pairs are created by LSPR of Au cores. The energetic hot electrons on Au cores can climb over the Schottky barrier at the Au-CdS interface and be transferred into the conduction band (CB) of CdS, which increases the free electron density on the surface of CdS shell (Fig. 7a). Additionally, the resonance energy transfer from Au core to CdS shell can further promote the generation of electrons and holes under visible light (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the electromagnetic (EM) field around plasmonic Au cores can enhance the separation of electron-hole pairs generated in CdS shell (Fig. 7c). Since Ni has the higher work function (5.15 eV) than CdS (3.71 eV) and Au (5.10 eV) [55–57], the photogenerated electrons in CdS shell are prone to migrate towards Ni NPs (Fig. 7d), where the protons from the dissociation of benzyl alcohol are reduced into H2. The photoinduced holes remaining on the surface of CdS shell participate in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Therefore, the plasmonic effect of Au cores in the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst not only enhances the utilization efficiency of visible light but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS shell. The Ni NPs serving as electron traps can direct the transfer of photogenerated electrons as well as afford the effective active sites for proton reduction and H2 evolution, thereby achieve the efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons and holes to produce H2 and benzaldehyde."
10,Conclusions,"In summary, the three-component Ni/(Au@CdS) core–shell photocatalyst has been designed and synthesized for the selective transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and H2. In this photocatalyst, the plasmon-induced resonance energy of Au cores could be transferred to the adjacent CdS shell, which enhanced the utilization efficiency of visible light for generating more charge carriers. Moreover, the electromagnetic field around the Au cores could accelerate the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The loaded Ni NPs on CdS shell could capture the electrons and serve as the effective active sites for proton reduction and H2 evolution. Thanks to the synergy of the three components, the Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst exhibited excellent performance towards photocatalytic coproduction of H2 and benzaldehyde from selective transformation of benzyl alcohol. The optimal Ni/(Au@CdS) photocatalyst achieved the yields of H2 and benzaldehyde up to 3882 and 4242 μmol·g−1·h−1, respectively, which are 8.43 and 4.87 times those from pure CdS photocatalyst. This study sheds some light on the rational design of the visible light responsive photocatalysts with the synergy of plasmonic effect and metal cocatalyst as well as demonstrates the efficient utilization of photoinduced electrons and holes to synchronously produce value-added fine chemicals and clean fuels."
