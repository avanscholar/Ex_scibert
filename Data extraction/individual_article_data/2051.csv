0,Introduction,"Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are currently the major source of energy, however, their combustion route inevitably emits carbon dioxide, one of the major contributors to global climate change [1]. In recent times, reliance on fossil fuels is on the wane, and renewable green energy sources such as solar, wind, nuclear, geothermal, tidal, and hydrogen energy are gaining importance as sustainable alternatives [2]. Among the various emerging alternative energy sources, hydrogen (H2) is widely considered to bethe“fuel of the future”, as it carries almost three times the energy density of diesel or gasoline [3] and eliminates carbon emissions on combustion, yielding only water vapor and heat which, can, in turn, be transformed into energy [4]. Hydrogen as an energy carrier can be generated from renewable sources (e.g. water, biomass) or non-renewable sources (e.g. natural gas and coal) [5]. A critical point of interest that is part of the H2 energy supply chain is securing a dense mode of storage for the produced H2 coupled with the relative ease of delivery. The most mature hydrogen storage technology currently is compressed hydrogen which requires high-pressure tanks (350 to 700 bar) [6] to achieve a high energy density, thereby imposing a harsh requirement on the tank materials. The high pressure required also negatively impacts the safety aspect of this technology with a perpetual risk of explosion. Therefore, compressed hydrogen gas for large scale storage is looked upon with suspicion. Hydrogen storage can also be achieved by liquifying the gaseous hydrogen at a suitable temperature and/or pressure [7] which promises an exceptionally high volumetric gas storage capacity of 850 v/v. However, hydrogen liquefaction requires an extremely low temperature (20 K) at atmospheric pressure, which cannot be achieved by the normal cryogenic fluid – liquid nitrogen (boiling point of 77 K). Moreover, specialized liquid hydrogen storage tanks capable of maintaining the low temperatures required are typically accompanied by high capital costs. Another common problem to plague any form of liquid hydrogen storage is that of continuous boil-off which happens due to the extremely low temperatures required. Despite tank insulation against the admission of external heat, even a slight amount of heat input will cause natural evaporation of the stored liquid hydrogen. This natural evaporation is known as boil-off and is unavoidable, as a result of which, liquid hydrogen storage is typically not suitable for operations that demand mid to long term gas storage periods. Molecular hydrogen exists in two isomeric forms i.e. orthohydrogen with two parallel proton spins and parahydrogen with two antiparallel proton spins [8]. At the normal boiling point of liquid hydrogen (20 K), the equilibrium composition is 99.8% parahydrogen and the rest in the ortho form while at relatively elevated temperatures (>200 K), the equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen is 3:1 [9,10]. Importantly, when hydrogen is freshly liquefied, the ortho:para ratio remains at 3:1, undergoing a gradual but marked change on standing to reach the equilibrium composition at 20 K mentioned above [10]. The difference in the energy states of ortho and para hydrogen (orthohydrogen is at a higher energy state compared to parahydrogen) means that energy is released in the form of heat when orthohydrogen converts into parahydrogen, i.e., the conversion is exothermic [9]. The heat release on ortho-para hydrogen conversion is greater that the endothermic heat requirement for vaporization of liquid hyfrogen. This implies that the inherent ortho-para hydrogen conversion to attain compositional equilibrium under liquid hydrogen temperatures contributes to continuous boil-off of the liquid hydrogen, thus complicating its long-term storage. To overcome this issue, catalysts such as chromic oxide and hydrous ferric oxide are used to accomplish ortho-para conversion, either directly in the gaseous phase before liquefaction or immediately following liquefaction, i.e., prior to delivery to the actual storage tank [10]. The storage of hydrogen can be achieved by physisorption using materials with large surface area, e.g., metal-organic frameworks (MOF), zeolites, carbon-based materials, etc [11–18]. The hydrogen absorbed on the porous materials remains in molecular form and binds weakly onto the material surface through Van der Waals interactions. The absorptive hydrogen storage method enables adsorption and desorption of hydrogen at a fast rate and the process is completely reversible. Nevertheless, due to the higher kinetic energy of hydrogen molecules, physisorption usually results in low hydrogen storage capacity at moderate temperature conditions and high storage capacity can be achieved only at temperatures below 80 K [19]; Hydrogen storage also can be achieved by chemisorption [20–22] to form complexes such as metal hydrides and chemical hydrides wherein hydrogen molecules get dissociated into individual atoms that bind with other elements through a covalent bond. Chemisorption can achieve high hydrogen storage capacity [23,24], yet it presents some real-life challenges; the chemisorption process is irreversible, thus it requires expensive catalysts to produce hydrogen and regenerate the material for the next cycle of hydrogen storage. Even with state-of-the-art catalysts, the controlled release of hydrogen at optimum temperature for applications that demand such output is difficult to achieve. Further, safety issues associated with exothermic reactions during hydrogen release continue to persist [25,26]. One innovative approach to hydrogen storage is the solidified hydrogen storage (Solid-HyStore) via clathrates technology wherein H2 is stored in the form of solid hydrates. A timeline of the critical work pertaining to hydrate-based hydrogen storage (Solid-HyStore technology) is presented in Fig. 1 . Although the hydrate-based hydrogen storage technology is still in the lab stage, this technique has witnessed considerable development over the past decades. The current focus, however, is to maximize the hydrogen storage capacity through innovative reactor and additive design which converts the maximum amount of water to hydrate [27–50]. The Solid-HyStore technology carries quite a few virtues establishing its unique role as a promising alternative to conventional hydrogen storage methods such as compressed hydrogen and liquid hydrogen: high hydrogen storage capacity (3.77 ∼ 4.97 wt%) can be achieved in pure hydrogen hydrate; pure molecular hydrogen can be generated from the solid hydrate; an environmentally benign technology as the hydrate forming solution is simply water for pure hydrogen hydrate, or > 94 mol% water along with a low concentration of promoters for much more stable H2-containing hydrate; easy storage and recovery of H2 just like forming and melting ice since there is no chemical reaction involved; last but not the least, H2-containing hydrates (also containing thermodynamic promoters in small concentrations in the hydrate phase) are non-explosive and enable safe, long-term storage of hydrogen gas under moderate temperature and pressure conditions. Table 1 compares the Solid-HyStore technology against conventional hydrogen storage methods (compressed hydrogen and liquid hydrogen) and the use of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a potential H2 storage material. A futuristic hydrogen supply chain using the gas hydrate based Solid-HyStore technology as the enabler for hydrogen storage is shown in Fig. 2 . Hydrogen produced by steam methane reforming, coal gasification, or by renewable methods such as biomass gasification and electrolysis can be stored as solid hydrates through the Solid-HyStore technology. The H2-containing hydrate that can then be transported to target consumers, by either land or sea, acts as a green energy source for several applications, including but not limited to electricity generation, as backup power for buildings, for energy supply to fuel cell vehicles, and as a means to reduce the carbon intensity of natural gas streams [54]. This review summarizes and evaluates various hydrate systems, specifically, H2-containing (sI) hydrate, H2-containing (sII) hydrate, H2-containing (sH) hydrate, H2-containing semiclathrate hydrate, and clathrate hydrates formed from mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas. Further, multiple occupancies of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules and the tuning effect for H2-containing hydrates are discussed in individual sections. Finally, the challenges, limitations, and potential future directions for research on clathrate hydrates of hydrogen are identified."
1,Gas hydrate,"Gas hydrates are ice-like solid composites that are formed by water (host) molecules and guest molecules which may be either small gas molecules (methane, propane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, etc.) or larger organic molecules (tetrahydrofuran, cyclopentane, 1,3-dioxolane, etc.) under low temperature and elevated pressure conditions [55–58]. Naturally occurring gas hydrates (existing under the seabed or in permafrost regions) represent a vast untapped source of methane or natural gas and may prove to be an invaluable asset to the human race in the future [59–61], while gas hydrates synthesized artificially present exciting opportunities for various technological applications such as gas capture and separation [62–65], methane storage [66–71], carbon dioxide sequestration [72–74], seawater desalination [75–78], and hydrogen storage [79–81]. Gas hydrates are generally classified as three canonical crystal structures, namely structure I (sI), structure II (sII), and structure H (sH) [55–58], crystal information for which is shown in Table 2 . The cubic unit cell of sI hydrate consists of two pentagonal dodecahedron (512) cages and six tetrakaidecahedron (51262) cages whereas the cubic unit cell of sII hydrate comprises sixteen pentagonal dodecahedron (512) cages and eight hexakaidecahedron (51264) cages. Lastly, the unit cell of sH hydrate is hexagonal and consists of three pentagonal dodecahedron (512) cages, two irregular dodecahedron (435663) cages, and one icosahedron (51268) cage. As presented in Fig. 1, it has been evidenced experimentally that H2 gas can be stored in all three canonical hydrate structures wherein hydrogen molecules occupy the various structural cages of hydrate with or without the presence of secondary guest molecules. Furthermore, there is an opportunity to adjust the hydrogen storage capacity within the different types of hydrate structures as each of these structures has its intrinsic ratio of large cages to the small cages and the structural cages may be occupied by H2 either singly or multiply depending on the pressure and temperature conditions as well as the synthesis methods used. In the upcoming sections, various H2-containing hydrate systems representing the three canonical gas hydrate structures are reviewed thoroughly, from discovery to state-of-the-art advancement."
2,H2-containing sII hydrate,
3,H2 hydrate,"3.1 H2 hydrate Hydrogen (H2) as an exceptionally small hydrophobic molecule was originally thought to be unable to stabilize any of the canonical clathrate hydrate structures [83]. It was not until 1999 that Dyadin et al. [83] first put forward the idea of H2 forming a classical hydrate structure, albeit at exceptionally high pressures (100 MPa or above). However, at this stage no elucidation on the crystal structure of the clathrate hydrate formed by H2 could be provided. Three years later in 2002, Mao et al. [27] first experimentally confirmed that H2 gas forms the canonical sII clathrate hydrate with an approximate H2 to H2O molar ratio of 1:2. In their pioneering experiment, a mixture of H2 and H2O was first pressurized to 180-220 MPa at 300 K and then cooled down to 249 K to form H2 hydrate. Careful characterization of the synthesized hydrate using Raman spectra, infrared spectra, and energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction revealed characteristic shifts for the hydrogen molecular vibrons between 4100 cm−1 to 4200 cm−1 on the formation of H2 hydrate (Fig. 3 I). However, the positions of the hydrogen rotons (between 300 cm−1 to 850 cm−1) for H2 hydrate remained largely unchanged compared to those for gaseous hydrogen, indicating continued free rotation of the hydrogen molecules even after being trapped inside the hydrate cages. They suggested that the high H2/H2O molar ratio of 1:2 (an obvious exception to Villard’s simplistic rule of 1:6 proposed for guest molecules discovered in the early period (first century) of gas hydrate research [58]) was because of the multiple cage occupancy by H2 in the formed hydrate structure. The Raman shift from 4115 cm−1 to 4135 cm−1 was tentatively assigned to four hydrogen molecules occupying the large (sII-51264) cages and the Raman shift from 4135 cm−1 to 4155 cm−1 was assigned to two hydrogen molecules occupying the small (sII-512) cages as shown in Fig. 3I. H2 hydrate can be an ideal energy storage material because of its ability to capture a huge amount of hydrogen gas using pure water as a backbone material. Wendy L. Mao and Ho-kwang Mao [29] further investigated the potential of H2 hydrate as a hydrogen storage material basing their analysis on the gravimetric gas storage capacity of H2 hydrate as well as its storage pressure and temperature (P-T) requirements. A typical experiment conducted as part of this study involved first pressurizing a mixture of H2 and H2O to 250-660 MPa at 300 K and then cooling down the system to 249 K to form H2 hydrate. Fig. 3II presents visual observations made during the hydrate formation process. It is noted from the same that H2 hydrate formation starts at the water (region A in Fig. 3II) – hydrogen (region B in Fig. 3II) interface, and by the end of the reaction, all of the water has converted into solid hydrate. It was reported that up to 5.3 wt% hydrogen gas can be captured in the pure H2 (sII) hydrate. The authors found that the formed hydrate was stable upon quenching to ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) and eventually dissociated when the temperature was increased to 140 K. In other words, the pure H2 hydrate would remain stable at ambient pressure provided the temperature is kept lower than 140 K. In another experiment, after the formation of hydrate at 300 MPa and 249 K, the temperature of the system was increased isobarically and the hydrate remained stable until 280 K. Thus, to stabilize pure H2 hydrate at the moderate temperature of 280 K, the minimum pressure condition is 300 MPa. As a hydrogen storage material, the pure H2 hydrate indeed has many virtues such as high hydrogen storage capacity (5.3 wt%), environmentally friendly byproducts (only water), and easy release of hydrogen, but either very low temperature (less than 140 K) or very high pressure (300 MPa) is required to stabilize the solid material, resulting in high energy expenditure. Therefore, a myriad of H2-containing hydrate systems with the presence of thermodynamic promoters (that can shift the hydrate phase equilibrium conditions to much more moderate ones (higher hydrate formation temperature and lower hydrate formation pressure) are consistently pursued relentlessly to further develop the Solid-HyStore technology via clathrates."
4,Mixed H2/THF hydrate,"3.2 Mixed H2/THF hydrate Florusse et al. [28] discovered that by introducing a second guest molecule (THF) to occupy the large cages of sII hydrate, hydrogen molecules can be captured in the small cages of the same at moderate temperature and pressure conditions of 5 MPa and 279.6 K respectively, representing a sharp contrast to the harsh stability conditions (300 MPa and 280 K) of pure H2 hydrate. The detailed Raman spectrum obtained for mixed H2/THF hydrate is shown in Fig. 3III. Other characterization results by techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction technique (p-XRD) and solid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with magic angle spinning (MAS) spectroscopy can be found in the original paper. The Raman results indicated no shifts in the peak positions of the hydrogen rotons after hydrate formation which is in agreement with the findings of Mao et al. [27]. However, the observations and analysis of characteristic Raman shifts in the hydrogen vibron region were completely different from the results presented in the pioneering study on pure H2 hydrates by Mao et al. [27]. Only one strong peak at 4125 cm−1 was found and the peak was assigned to hydrogen molecules occupying the small cages of sII hydrate, it should be noted here that a peak shift in the similar wavenumber range (4115 cm−1 to 4135 cm−1) was assigned to hydrogen molecules occupying the large cages of sII hydrate by Mao et al. [27]. Strobel et al. [84] further independently performed experiments to clarify the Raman spectra assignment for hydrate cage occupancy by hydrogen molecules. They obtained the Raman spectra for both pure H2 hydrate and mixed H2/THF hydrate. THF was used in stochiometric concentration (5.56 mol%) to synthesize the mixed H2/THF hydrates, which meant that all large cages (sII-51264) would be occupied by THF, leaving only the small cages (sII-512) available for hydrogen molecules. Fig. 3IV represents the obtained Raman spectra for pure H2 hydrate, mixed H2/THF hydrate, and pure H2 fluid for a fair comparison. Both H2 hydrate and mixed H2/THF hydrate displayed a strong peak at about 4120 cm−1 with a shoulder at around 4125 cm−1 and additionally the H2 hydrate exhibited three extra peaks at higher frequency. Therefore, the strong Raman peak at around 4120 cm−1 with a shoulder at ∼4125 cm−1 undoubtedly represents hydrogen molecules occupying the small (512) cages of sII hydrate which consequently means that the other Raman peaks at higher frequency represent hydrogen molecules occupying the large (51264) cages of the same. 3.2.1 Hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/THF hydrate The significant moderation to the pressure-temperature (P-T) requirements for hydrate formation and storage provided by the mixed H2/THF system makes the commercialization of the hydrate-based hydrogen storage technology much more realistic. However, with the presence of THF the hydrogen storage capacity of the solid hydrate is compromised considering the large cages of the hydrate structure are now occupied by THF molecules. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to quantify the hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/THF hydrate which would go a long way towards determining the practical feasibility for its use as a hydrogen storage material. Strobel et al. [33] synthesized mixed H2/THF hydrate by exposing solid THF hydrate particles (formed using the stoichiometric concentration of THF) to hydrogen gas with the hydrogen storage capacity quantified from the amount of gas released on complete dissociation of the formed hydrates. For mixed H2/THF hydrates formed from the 5.56 mol% THF hydrate particles, the hydrogen storage capacity increased with increasing the initial experimental pressure, asymptotically approaching 1 wt% at higher pressures (Fig. 4 I). Ogata et al. [86] investigated the amount of H2 stored in mixed H2/THF hydrate using pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) measurement as well as Raman spectroscopic analysis. The amount of H2 stored in the mixed H2/THF hydrate showed a strong positive dependence on the experimental pressure with the storage capacity increasing from 0.19 wt% at the experimental pressure of 10.7 MPa to 0.84 wt % at the experimental pressure of 66.4 MPa (Fig. 4II). Apart from the P-V-T measurement, the authors also estimated the hydrogen storage capacity using Raman spectra obtained from both single-crystal and polycrystal of mixed H2/THF hydrate under different pressure conditions (Fig. 4III). The single-crystal of mixed H2/THF hydrate was prepared by exposing THF aqueous solution to hydrogen pressure along the three-phase equilibrium boundary and the polycrystal of mixed H2/THF hydrate was prepared using the isothermal pressure-swing absorption method, starting from pure THF hydrate maintained at 277.15 K. With a set of three assumptions the authors predicted the hydrogen storage capacity based on the normalized Raman peak area ratios (hydrogen vibration/THF ring-breathing). The three assumptions were: 1) the mixed H2/THF hydrate formed at the highest experimental pressure was fully loaded with hydrogen (one hydrogen molecule per small (512) cage of sII hydrate), thus giving a hydrogen storage capacity of 1.05 wt%; 2) the Raman scattering cross-section remained unchanged under the studied experimental conditions; 3) the H2 vibration was represented by the Raman peak at 4132 cm−1. The Raman analysis of the single-crystal and polycrystal of mixed H2/THF hydrate agreed with the results obtained from pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) measurement (Fig. 4II). Since the calculation for the maximum hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/THF hydrate, which reached a value of 1.05 wt%, assumed that only one H2 molecule could occupy the small hydrate cages, the above work is important to understand the effect of H2 pressure on the gas storage capacity that is attainable within the solid hydrate structure. It is important to note at this stage that up to 4.0 wt% hydrogen storage capacity has been reported for mixed H2/THF hydrate in the literature, making use of the tuning effect [32]. However, relying on the tuning effect to increase the hydrogen storage capacity appears infeasible from the point of view of practical application and the same has been discussed in detail separately in Section 9 of the present manuscript. The application of the tuning effect notwithstanding, the maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 1.05 wt% possibly achieved through conventional methods for mixed H2/THF hydrate falls substantially short of the US DOE 2025 target of 5.5 wt% for on-board application [87]. Further, achieving 1.05 wt% hydrogen storage capacity using the most common method of hydrate formation, i.e., starting from aqueous solutions, has persistently remained a big challenge for the gas hydrate research community. Therefore, despite the advantage of the requirement of a lower pressure to stabilize mixed H2/THF hydrate, this approach is not suitable for on-board application and should rather be investigated for other stationary applications where hydrogen storage capacity is not a limiting factor. 3.2.2 Formation kinetics of mixed H2/THF hydrate The kinetics of hydrate formation is a crucial point of consideration for the practical application of any hydrate-based technology. Researchers have put in considerable efforts to study the kinetic aspects of mixed H2/THF hydrate formation with the end objective to develop a commercially viable Solid-HyStore technology. However, hydrate formation from aqueous solution has persistently exhibited a sluggish rate of hydrogen uptake with the hydrogen storage capacity also only reaching about 10-20% of the maximum possible value within the limited reaction times. Veluswamy and Linga [43] investigated the macroscopic formation kinetics of mixed H2/THF hydrate in a stirred tank reactor (STR) by varying the driving force and the THF concentration. The maximum water to hydrate conversion achieved in the study was about 10.8 mol% (corresponding gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 0.14 wt%), at experimental pressure and temperature conditions of 8.8 MPa and 278.2 K respectively and over a hydrate growth period of 15.5 hours. In another study, Veluswamy et al. [88] compared the kinetics of H2-containing hydrate formation using tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB), and cyclopentane (CP) as promoters in the liquid phase and keeping the experimental condition comparable. Among the three promoters studied, the mixed H2/THF hydrate shows the highest hydrogen uptake at 0.0203 mol of H2/mol of H2O (corresponding gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 0.186 wt%), achieved over a hydrate growth period of 6 hours. Jing et al. [89,90] investigated the formation and dissociation behavior of mixed H2/THF hydrates using differential scanning calorimetry and in-situ Raman spectroscopy techniques, providing insights into the memory effect for the mixed H2/THF hydrate system and the cage occupancy patterns of the guest molecules. However, only a very meagre hydrogen density of 1.875 g/L water (corresponding gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 0.167 wt%) could be achieved for the formed hydrates even after an extended growth period of 192 hours. The sluggish hydrogen uptake, mainly arising due to the difficulty of hydrogen diffusion through liquid water and solid hydrates (on the interface) has thus become a generic problem that needs to be addressed. Lee et al. [32] found that, compared to the bulk reaction, the hydrogen uptake becomes significantly faster when hydrogen gas is exposed to aqueous THF solution dispersed on a silica bead support. Nonetheless, this cannot be a practical solution considering the high density and incompressibility of the silica bead support. Another approach to enhance the diffusion of hydrogen gas through the bulk hydrate phase is to increase the surface-to-volume ratio, which may be effectively accomplished by exposing fine hydrate particles (normally in the micrometer range) to high hydrogen gas pressure, as exemplified by the results displayed in Fig. 4 [33,86]. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the process of crushing bulk hydrate particles into tiny ones consumes a significant amount of energy. Moreover, the fine hydrate particles change into the bulk phase after melting (re-melting), thus making this approach unsuitable for repeat hydrate formation, and further hindering its practical applicability. To enhance the kinetics of hydrate formation and ensure repeat of hydrate formation runs, many researchers have proposed the use of light porous materials as a support to form hydrates [91–94]. Saha and Deng [91] reported an approximate 1.0 wt% hydrogen loading in H2/THF hydrate by utilizing porous materials (with four different pore sizes of 49 Å, 65 Å, 100 Å, and 226 Å) as supports for hydrate formation. The average times for mixed H2/THF hydrate formation in the porous supports, with pore sizes of 49 Å, 65 Å, 100 Å and 226 Å, were 27 min, 50 min, 154 min, and 304 min, respectively. As the pore size increases, the size of the generated hydrate particle also becomes larger, which leads to reduced hydrogen diffusivity in the hydrates. A modified shrinking core kinetic model was used to estimate the diffusivity of hydrogen in the mixed H2/THF clathrate hydrates which was found to be in the range of 10−18 – 10−19 m2/s [91,95]. Su et al. [94] synthesized emulsion-templated polymerized high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) material with exceptionally low bulk density and interconnected pore structure as shown in Fig. 5 I; 20 g of 5.56 mol% aqueous THF solution could be absorbed into just 3 g of polyHIPE support. The authors studied the effects of the polyHIPE support on the hydrogen uptake kinetics for mixed H2/THF hydrate formation. With the polyHIPE support, the maximum H2 pressure drop obtained at the experimental temperature of 270 K was about 1 MPa and the time required to reach 90% of the maximum H2 pressure drop was about 60 min. This represented a more than 250-fold kinetic enhancement compared to the experiments conducted without the use of the polyHIPE support. Fig. 5II shows the crosslinked poly (acrylic acid) sodium salt (PSA) that has the ability to absorb aqueous THF solution to form a hydrogel [93]. The PSA particles function as an excellent support material and exhibit not only good recyclability for mixed H2/THF hydrate formation but also a 600-fold increase in the rate of gas uptake as compared to the bulk hydrate system. Although the light porous materials can expedite the uptake of hydrogen into the structural cages of hydrate, adding new material to the mixed H2/THF system compromises the hydrogen storage capacity and results in a substantially higher volume requirement for the eventual storage system. The methods reviewed above for enhancing the kinetics of hydrogen uptake with THF as a thermodynamic promoter may be adopted to develop a practical hydrate-based hydrogen storage technology; however, better optimization is required considering either the energy intensive ice-making process or the volume requirement of the supporting medium involved. Realizing rapid and abundant hydrogen uptake starting from bulk hydrate-forming solution is still the most desirable approach towards enabling commercially viable hydrogen storage via clathrates. A potential avenue of overcoming the current limitation of sluggish hydrogen uptake when conducting hydrate formation from aqueous solutions could be to seek other promoter systems which would not only provide remarkable thermodynamic promotion akin to THF but also superior hydrogen uptake rate, if necessary, with the help of additional kinetic promoters in small concentrations."
5,Other H2-containing sII hydrate,"3.3 Other H2-containing sII hydrate In addition to pure H2 hydrate and mixed H2/THF hydrate, a few other H2-containing sII hydrate systems have been reported. Hydrogen contributes to the stability of a sII lattice containing the large guest molecule cyclohexanone (CHONE) that is unable to stabilize a hydrate structure on its own [96]. Interestingly, Sugahara et al. [97] found that H2 can occupy the large cages of mixed H2/CHONE sII hydrate in the presence of 0.52 mol% cyclohexanone at the experimental pressure of 74 MPa. A systematic study into the thermodynamic stability and spectroscopic elucidation of mixed H2/1,4-Dioxane sII hydrate has been conducted to understand its potential as hydrogen storage material [98]. Up to 0.4 wt% hydrogen could be stored in the thermodynamically stable hydrate sample (synthesized using a 5.56 mol% 1,4-dioxane solution) at 233 K and 12 MPa, for a period of 7 days. Through volumetric measurement the authors observed a sharp increase in the H2 content in the mixed H2/1,4-Dioxane hydrate as the concentration of 1,4-dioxane was lowered below 1 mol% but failed to observe spectroscopic evidence of the tuning phenomenon [98]. The hydrogen storage capacity of tetrahydrothiophene (THT) and furan hydrates obtained using pressure-volume-temperature measurement was ∼0.6 wt% at 275.1 K and 41.5 MPa [99]. Also, Tsuda et al. [99] measured the four-phase (gas, liquid (water-rich), liquid (organic-rich), and hydrate) equilibrium condition of mixed H2/THT sII hydrate and mixed H2/furan sII hydrate. Cyclopentane (CP) can form sII hydrate on its own showing higher melting points than THF at atmospheric pressure [100]. The four-phase equilibrium condition of mixed H2/CP sII hydrate has been measured extensively [101–103]. As for the kinetics of mixed H2/CP sII hydrate formation, Veluswamy et al. [88] reported that hydrate nucleation took about 32.3 hours starting from the liquid phase, even at the low experimental temperature of 274.2 K, at the initial pressure of 12 MPa (high initial driving force (△T) of 9.5 K). The hydrogen gas uptake in the resultant mixed H2/CP hydrate was about 0.004 mol of gas/mol of water [88]. The frustrating kinetics and final gas uptake observed for mixed H2/CP hydrate formation is likely due to the immiscibility of CP with water which may give rise to mass transfer limitations. Kawamura et al. [41] studied the hydrogen storage in sII clathrate hydrates formed in the presence of various thermodynamic promoters (propylene oxide, 1,3-Dioxolane, 2.5-Dihydrofuran, 1,4-Dioxane, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran) by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopic characterization, and volumetric analysis. The results suggested that many organic compounds have similar performance to THF and can be used as alternatives to THF for hydrogen storage. Trueba et al. measured the phase equilibrium conditions of various sII hydrate systems containing hydrogen and organic compounds (furan, 2,5-dihydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 1,3-dioxolane, and cyclopentane). The stability of hydrates formed in the presence of various organic compounds is in the order: 1,3-dioxolane < 2,5-dihydrofuran < tetrahydropyran < furan < cyclopentane. Di Profio et al. [47] proposed a reverse micelle process to enhance the formation kinetics of H2-containing sII hydrate in the presence of various promotors, namely tetrahydrofuran, cyclopentane, dioxolane, 2,5-dihydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, and tetrahydrothiophene. This micelle process reduces the gas-water interface down to tens of nanometers and may be extremely useful to overcome the kinetic hindrance (driven by mass-transfer limitations) that exists for H2-containing hydrate formation using water-insoluble promoters. The thermodynamic promotion imparted to H2-containing hydrate formation individually by 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) and chloroform (CHCl3) were investigated recently, and up to 0.4 wt% hydrogen storage capacity was reported for mixed H2/HCFC-141b sII hydrate formed at the experimental conditions of 273 K temperature and 12 MPa pressure [104]. To summarize, the majority of the research work conducted over the past decades on H2-containing sII hydrate formation in the presence of chemical promoters (either water-miscible or water-immiscible) has focused on the thermodynamic aspects of these systems. However, the next potential breakthrough in hydrogen storage as sII hydrates in the presence of chemical promoters undoubtedly lies in the kinetic aspects of the hydrate formation process, as ensuring rapid, high volume H2 uptake into the solid hydrate phase is a gap that still exists and one that needs to be filled urgently."
6,H2-containing sI hydrate,"The hydrogen molecule may also be stored in the structural cages of sI hydrate, albeit requiring the presence of a second guest molecule. However, the discovery of H2-containing sI hydrate was not quite straightforward. Sugahara et al. [82] were the first to put forth the phase equilibrium conditions for the H2/CO2/H2O system, noting that the equilibrium pressure increases along with increasing H2 composition in the gas phase. However, the authors suggested that H2 was not enclathrated within the hydrate phase but rather acted as a diluent gas towards the formation of CO2 hydrate. In addition, Raman spectroscopy reconfirmed no hydrate cage occupancy by the hydrogen molecules. Raman spectra were obtained using a reactor with a quartz window which, unlike a sapphire window, would not produce any interfering signals in the hydrogen vibron region of the Raman spectrum [105]. The H2-containing sI hydrate was first observed by Kim and Lee [31] by pressurizing ice powder with (20 mol%+80 mol%) CO2 + H2 gas mixture at a constant temperature (270.0 K) and pressure condition (120 bar). The mixed H2/CO2 hydrates formed were characterized to be “structure I” using the powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) technique. Further, the authors reported bimolecular H2 clusters in the small (512) cages of sI hydrate based on the 1H MAS NMR spectra obtained for the mixed H2/CO2 hydrate (Fig. 6 I). Kumar et al. [110] measured the incipient hydrate phase equilibrium for CO2 + H2 gas mixtures having different gas compositions and observed that at a fixed temperature condition, the hydrate equilibrium pressure increased with increasing H2 to CO2 ratio. The structure of gas hydrates formed with the gas mixtures was indirectly suggested to be structure I from the heat of hydrate dissociation (∼84 KJ/mol) calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Linga et al. [111] studied the kinetics of mixed H2/CO2 hydrate formation using a feed gas mixture with a composition of 39.2% CO2 and 60.8% H2. Hydrate formation was carried out at a fixed temperature of 273.7 K and two different experimental pressures of 8.5 MPa and 7.5 MPa. The authors concluded that at the higher experimental pressure of 8.5 MPa, H2 competed much more severely with CO2 to occupy the hydrate cages when compared to at the lower pressure of 7.5 MPa. Kumar et al. [112] further studied the structure and composition of mixed H2/CO2 hydrates employing various characterization techniques. The mixed H2/CO2 hydrates were confirmed to be structure I (sI) using p-XRD while the 1H MAS spectra of H2/CO2 hydrate obtained showed a strong peak at 4.26 ppm with a shoulder at 4.09 ppm which were assigned to single occupancy of sI-512 cages by H2 and double occupancy of sI-512 cages by H2, respectively. However, the obtained Raman spectra only showed single occupancy of the sI-512 cages by hydrogen. Skiba et al. [113] studied the phase equilibrium for H2/CH4/H2O systems at pressures up to 250 MPa with the hydrogen concentration ranging from 0 to 70 mol%. The recorded Raman spectra for a hydrate sample synthesized at 20 MPa pressure and with 40 mol% of hydrogen in the feed gas indicated that hydrogen molecules were not incorporated in the formed sI hydrate. Grim et al. [106] adopted a different synthesis pathway to form H2-containing sI hydrate. Either CH4 hydrates or CO2 hydrates were first synthesized and hydrogen gas at high pressure (∼70 MPa) was then contacted with the preformed hydrate to establish a high chemical potential gradient between the hydrogen gas phase and the solid hydrate phase thereby creating the possibility of hydrogen occupancy in the hydrate cages. The Raman spectra obtained indicated single and double occupancy of the sI-51262 cages by H2 molecules, in addition to single occupancy of the sI-512 cages by H2, as shown in Fig. 6II. This was the first work to report the hydrogen enclathration in both the small (512) and large (51262) cages of sI hydrate. Otherwise, hydrogen has generally only been reported to occupy the sI-512 cages if using conventional synthesis techniques, i.e., forming hydrate from the gas phase and liquid water or ice powder [31,82,113,114]. A theoretical study conducted for the H2/CH4/H2O system with a small concentration (6%) of methane indicated that the system can form stable sI hydrates with 1.75 wt% of hydrogen storage capacity at a temperature of 250 K and a pressure of 200 MPa [115]. The H2-containing sI hydrate can be synthesized artificially in the presence of a second guest molecule such as methane, carbon dioxide, and ethylene oxide. The hydrogen storage capacity of a synthesized sI hydrate is expected to be limited by the number of small cages available for hydrogen occupancy in the hydrate structure given the inherently low “small cage to large cage” ratio (1:3) of sI hydrate. It is necessary to state here that the pure hydrogen sI hydrate is thermodynamically unstable and is not confirmed to exist yet [116]. The Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations performed by Papadimitrios et al. [117] evaluated the upper limit of the hydrogen storage capacity for the hypothetical pure hydrogen sI hydrate. The structural cages (sI-51262) could accommodate up to three H2 molecules depending on the hydrogen pressure while the sI-512 cages remained singly occupied even at pressures up to 500 MPa, leading to total hydrogen storage capacity of 3.5 wt%. The authors also investigated the mixed H2/EO sI hydrate with ethylene oxide (EO) as the second guest molecule and in this case, the large (51262) cages were occupied by EO molecules whereas the small (512) cages were singly occupied by hydrogen molecules, resulting in a maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 0.37 wt%. It is also worth noting that first principles electronic structure calculations indicated a maximum accommodation capacity of 5 and 7 hydrogen guest molecules per sI-512 and sI-51262 cage, respectively, thereby resulting in a soaring hydrogen storage capacity of 11.2 wt% [118]."
7,H2-containing sH hydrate,"The H2-containing sH hydrate was confirmed experimentally by Duarte et al. [35] and Strobel et al. [36]. Duarte et al. [35] measured the phase equilibrium conditions of three individual H2-containing sH hydrate systems synthesized using the well-known sH forming large guest molecules methylcyclohexane (MCH), 1,1-dimethylcyclohexane (1,1-DMCH), and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The three-phase equilibrium conditions for H2-containing sH hydrates were found to be significantly harsher (higher pressures/lower temperatures) than those for mixed H2/THF hydrate. Duarte and co-authors [107] then conducted a second study measuring the phase equilibrium conditions of H2-containing hydrate in the presence of other sH formers that included the likes of 2,2,3-trimethylbutane and cycloheptene and several more. On the other hand, Strobel et al. [36] conducted a spectroscopic investigation to characterize H2-containing hydrates formed in the presence of various sH-formers that included methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methylcyclohexane (MCH), 2,2,3-trimethylbutane (2,2,3-TMB), and 1,1-dimethylcyclohexane (1,1-DMCH). Single occupancy by hydrogen molecules was proposed for both the small cage (sH-512) and the medium cage (sH-435663) of sH hydrate with the large cages (sH-51268) being occupied by large guest molecules. This translates to a maximum gravimetric storage capacity of 1.4 wt%, a 40% increase as compared to that achievable for H2-containing sII hydrates such as that formed by the mixed H2/THF system (see Table 2). Papadimitriou et al. [119] performed Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to evaluate the hydrogen-storage capacity of H2-containing sH hydrate. The hypothetical sH hydrate consisting of only water and hydrogen molecules can store up to 3.6 wt% hydrogen. Single occupancy by hydrogen molecules was detected for both the sH-512 (small) and sH-435663 (medium) cages. Interestingly, at pressures in excess of 350 MPa, a small fraction (up to 5%) of the medium cages (sH-435663) appeared to exhibit double occupancy by hydrogen molecules. The respective fraction of small (sH-512) cages exhibiting double occupancy however remained negligible at 0.1%, even under the extreme pressure condition (up to 500 MPa). The cage occupancy of the sH-51268 (large) cages was found to be highly dependent on pressure, reaching an average occupancy value of 6 hydrogen molecules per cage at about 470 MPa. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were also performed for the mixed H2/methylcyclohexane (MCH) hydrate system, to determine its hydrogen storage capacity at 274 K and in the pressure range of 1-500 MPa [119]. For the mixed H2/MCH hydrate system, the hydrogen uptake below 350 MPa presented a Langmuir-type trend with a plateau at 1.4 wt%. This represents a situation where the sH-512 (small) and sH-435663 (medium) cages were both singly occupied by hydrogen molecules with the sH-435663 (large) cages being reserved exclusively for single occupancy by the MCH molecules. However, above 350 MPa, a small fraction of medium (sH-435663) cages exhibited double occupancy by hydrogen molecules, thereby lifting the gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity beyond the formerly plateaued value of 1.4 wt%. The last GCMC evaluation performed by Papadimitriou et al. [119] was on the so-called hypothetical hydrogen-promoter sH hydrate where the promoter occupies the medium (sH-435663) cages instead of the large (sH-51268) ones. The hypothetical hydrogen-promoter sH hydrate presented a hydrogen storage capacity that was higher than that of the mixed H2/MCH hydrate (where the promoter molecule occupies the large (sH-51268) cages) but lower than that of the hypothetical pure hydrogen sH hydrate. To summarize, H2-containing sH hydrate systems offer the benefit of increased hydrogen storage capacity as compared to mixed H2/THF hydrate; however, the severe pressure and temperature conditions required for the formation and subsequent storage of H2-containing sH hydrates (Fig. 6III) hinder their practical application as hydrogen storage materials."
8,H2-containing semiclathrate hydrate,"Semiclathrate hydrates (SCHs) can be formed by water and quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) such as tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF), tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), etc. In contrast to the three canonical gas hydrate structures (sI/sII/sH) that are traditionally formed by conventional hydrate guests, the structures of semiclathrate hydrates can be conspicuously diverse, e.g., TBAB alone can form at least seven different types of semiclathrate structures [120,121]. Nevertheless, all semiclathrate hydrate structures have similar structural properties of featuring the large cation of the QAS occupying the broken cages while leaving the small cages available for occupancy by gas molecules. Fig. 6IV shows a part of the unit cell of the type B TBAB semiclathrate (the most common TBAB semiclathrate hydrate structure), wherein the hydrate cages are formed by mainly water molecules expressed as red spheres (only oxygen atoms shown explicitly) along with a few scattered Br atoms expressed as purple spheres [109]. The complete unit cell for the structure shown in Fig. 6IV is made up of 2 TBAB molecules and 76 water molecules, and consists of six pentagonal dodecahedron (512), four tetrakaidecahedron (51262), and four pentakaidecahedron (51263) cages [122]. However, the presence of the large tetra-n-butylammonium cation breaks part of the cage structure as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 6IV. The tetra-n-butylammonium cation is located at the center of four cages with two of the butyl groups accommodated in two tetrakaidecahedra (upper cages) and the other two butyl groups residing in two pentakaidecahedra (lower cages). The pentagonal dodecahedra (512 cages) are empty and may enclathrate small gas molecules as represented in Fig. 6IV by the shaded circles occupying the two visible 512 cages. Semiclathrate hydrates have been drawing a huge amount of attention in recent times by virtue of their unique ability to capture small gas molecules (carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen) even at near-ambient pressure and temperature conditions. Moreover, the QAS solution has a lower vapor pressure compared to volatile organic solutions such as THF solution, thereby reducing the impurities that may be introduced to the released hydrogen gas upon the dissociation of hydrates. Chapoy et al. [34] first experimentally substantiated the formation of H2-containing QAS semiclathrate hydrate. The phase equilibrium conditions of mixed H2/TBAB hydrates and mixed H2/TBAF hydrates were measured using the classic isochoric pressure search method. Notably, the melting temperature of mixed H2/TBAF semiclathrate hydrate can go up to ∼302 K (29 °C) at atmospheric pressure. Hashimoto et al. [123] measured the phase equilibrium conditions of mixed H2/TBAB hydrates in the pressure range of 0.13 MPa to 13.6 MPa. The equilibrium temperature of mixed H2/TBAB hydrate was measured to be 285.4 K at near atmospheric pressure (0.13 MPa). Raman spectroscopic investigation of the mixed H2/TBAB hydrate system indicated single occupancy of the small cages of TBAB hydrate by hydrogen molecules. The maximum gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of the mixed H2/TBAB hydrate system based on the crystal data provided in the literature [109] is calculated to be 0.59 wt% (corresponding volumetric hydrogen storage capacity of 34.87 (v/v; volume of gas at STP/volume of hydrate)), given all small (512) cages are singly occupied by hydrogen molecules and all the large cages are occupied by the tetra-n-butylammonium cation. Ayako et al. [124] measured the phase equilibrium conditions of mixed H2/TBAC hydrate at four different weight fractions of TBAC in solution (0.10, 0.20, 0.35, and 0.50 wt%), using a differential scanning calorimeter. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/TBAC hydrate (0.35 wt% TBAC) was estimated to be 0.11 wt% at a hydrogen pressure of 15.5 MPa. Karimi et al. [125] measured the phase equilibrium conditions of mixed H2/TBAOH semiclathrate hydrate. Through isochoric reactor experiments, the estimated hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/TBAOH hydrate (TBAOH mole fraction of 0.0083 in solution) came to be 0.35 wt% and 0.47 wt% at the formation pressures of 10 MPa and 20 MPa, respectively. Strobel et al. [84] measured the hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/TBAB semiclathrate, formed by exposing TBAB hydrate powder to H2 gas pressure of 13.8 MPa, at a temperature of 279.5 K. The maximum hydrogen storage capacity achieved was 0.21 wt% for the employed TBAB concentration of 2.71 mol%. Truebe et al. [126] investigated the formation kinetics of mixed H2/TBAB semiclathrate hydrate using two separate formation methods (T-cycle method and T-constant method). The experiments were conducted from aqueous TBAB solutions, two separate solutions containing two different concentrations of TBAB (2.6 mol% and 3.7 mol%). The amount of hydrogen stored increased with increasing gas pressure and TBAB concentration. With 2.6 mol% of TBAB in solution, the amount of H2 stored was 0.031 wt% at an experimental pressure of 16 MPa and the temperature of 281.15 K, whereas at the same pressure and temperature conditions, with 3.7 mol% of TBAB in solution, the amount of H2 stored went up to 0.046 wt%. In summary, H2-containing semiclathrate hydrates promise milder pressure and temperature requirements for hydrate formation and storage, thereby positioning them as promising materials for long term hydrogen storage. The major limiting factor for further development and eventual commercial application of this approach, however, is the low hydrogen storage capacities currently being returned for H2-containing semiclathrate hydrates, even when formed under high gas pressures. Overcoming the same necessitates significant further, targeted research and it may be some time yet before semiclathrate hydrates are seen as a completely viable prospect to enable hydrate based hydrogen storage."
9,Gas hydrate formation from mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas,"The flammable gases (methane, ethane, and propane) which act as fuels on their own have been proposed to serve as co-guests with hydrogen gas to not only lowering the pressure and temperature requirements for hydrate formation but also increase the energy density of the formed clathrates. Veluswamy et al. [127] studied the phase equilibrium conditions of mixed hydrogen/propane hydrate observing that the hydrate formation pressure drops from 300 MPa at 280 K for pure hydrogen hydrate [29] to 7.73 MPa at 280 K with propane as a co-guest. Veluswamy and a separate group of co-authors in a follow-up study investigated the effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant on the kinetics of mixed hydrogen/propane hydrate formation. The t90 (time required for 90% completion of hydrate formation; mixed hydrogen/propane hydrate in the present case) reduced from 334.2 (±27.7) min to 25.5 (±1.8) min in the presence of the kinetic promoter SDS, at concentrations ≥ 100 ppm [46]. Ghaani et al. [128] conducted both theoretical and experimental studies into hydrogen storage in propane hydrates and reported up to 1.04 wt% hydrogen storage capacity in the mixed H2/C3H8 sII hydrate synthesized experimentally. Zhang et al. [129] investigated the growth of mixed H2/CH4 binary hydrates using molecular dynamics simulations with atomic models and reported that CH4 acted as a thermodynamic promoter for hydrate formation, whereas‘ H2 acted as a kinetic promotor for hydrate growth at the considered experimental conditions. Yu et al. [104] measured the phase equilibrium conditions of hydrates formed using a hydrogen (H2) (75 mol%)/methane (CH4) (25 mol%) gas mixture. The authors also investigated the effect that introducing a potential thermodynamic promoter tert-butyl alcohol (5.6 mol% and 2.8 mol%) may have on the thermodynamic stability of the resultant hydrate system. Tert-butyl alcohol used at both 5.6 mol% and 2.8 mol% concentrations could shift the hydrate equilibrium temperature towards a higher temperature zone. Recently, Matsumoto et al. [130] synthesized and characterized the mixed H2/CH4 hydrate in addition to analyzing the hydrate cage occupancies by the guest molecules using Raman spectroscopy. The H2/CH4 gas mixture can form both sI and sII hydrate, depending on the formation pressure, initial gas composition, and formation period. In the case of sI hydrates, both single and double occupancy by hydrogen molecules could be detected, for small (512) cages and large (51262) cages alike, whereas in the case of sII hydrates, both single and double occupancy by hydrogen molecules could be detected for the small (512) cages, and up to quadruple occupancy by hydrogen molecules could be detected for the large (51264) cages. Zhong et al. [131] experimentally studied the penetration behaviour of H2, CH4, and CO2 molecules within THF hydrate by exposing a 5 mm thick THF hydrate layer to pure H2 gas and H2/CH4 and H2/CO2 gas mixtures. The authors reported that while H2 molecules could penetrate the entire THF hydrate layer within 24 hours, the same remained resistant to CH4 or CO2 molecules over the investigated time scales. Ahn et al. [48] studied the storage of hydrogen as hydrates by using hydrogen-natural gas (CH4 + C2H6) mixtures with different compositions as the feed gas streams. The H2/CH4/C2H6 gas mixtures could form either sI or sII hydrate and based on the hydrate formation method employed, single or multiple occupancy of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules could be achieved. Different compositions of the methane/ethane/hydrogen gas mixture were employed by Moon et al. [49] to react with ice powder and from hydrates that can store both hydrogen gas and natural gas simultaneously. The maximum H2 storage capacity was achieved for hydrate formation from the feed gas mixture having a (CH4/C2H6/H2) composition of (27/3/70) mol%; the synthesized sII hydrate exhibited double H2 occupancy in the small (512) cages and quadruple H2 occupancy in the large (51264) cages. Despite multiple occupancies of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules, hydrate composition analysis by gas chromatography (GC) showed a (CH4:C2H6:H2) split of (51.74:17.98:30.2) mol% in the formed solid hydrate. The results indicated a vast majority of the hydrate cages to be filled either by methane or ethane rather than hydrogen. Compared to hydrogen, the molecular sizes of methane, ethane, and propane are much more conducive for the stabilization of the hydrate cages and therefore, when forming hydrates from mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas, it is the hydrocarbons that preferentially get enclathrated into the solid hydrate phase, thereby resulting in limited hydrogen storage capacity within the mixed hydrates."
10,Multiple occupancies of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules,"One of the most controversial topics in the area of hydrogen hydrate research is that of multiple occupancy of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules, a vital factor in determining the hydrogen storage capacities achievable for various H2-containing hydrate systems. In this section, we aim to systematically dissect the evolution of opinions on this topic and provide the readers with a comprehensive review of the knowledge developed thus far on the same. The earliest discovered pure H2 hydrate was reported with two H2 molecules occupying the small cages of sII hydrate (sII-512) and four H2 molecules occupying large cages of sII hydrate (sII-51264) [27]. The lower frequency Raman shift from 4115 cm−1 to 4135 cm−1 was tentatively assigned to the loosely fitted tetrahedral cluster of four hydrogen molecules residing in the sII-51264 cages while the higher frequency shift from 4135 cm−1 to 4155 cm−1 was assigned to the cluster of two hydrogen molecules residing in the sII-512 cages (refer to Fig. 3I). However, as discussed in the previous sections, this tentative assignment should in fact be inverted; the Raman spectrum obtained for mixed H2/THF hydrate by Florusse et al. indicated that the H-H vibron peak observed at 4125 cm−1 should represent hydrogen molecules occupying the sII-512 cages, as for the mixed H2/THF system, all or most of the sII-51264 cages are expected to be occupied by the THF molecules (Fig. 3III) [28]. 1H MAS NMR spectrum of mixed H2/TDF sII hydrate obtained as part of the study by Florusse et al. showed no definite markers for multiple occupancy of the sII-512 cages by hydrogen molecules, although, a relatively large linewidth was observed for the hydrogen resonance line, which would most likely happen if the sII-512 cages were occupied by more than one H2 molecule. Finally, volumetric measurements carried out during hydrate dissociation estimated an average of only one hydrogen molecule enclathrated per sII-512 cage. A theoretical investigation by Patchkovskii and Tse wherein the authors employed a combination of a statistical mechanical model and first-principles quantum chemistry calculations, suggested that for sII hydrogen clathrate synthesized at 200 MPa pressure and 250 K temperature, the average hydrogen occupancies of the sII-512 cages and sII-51264 cages were 2 molecules and 3.96 molecules, respectively [132]. The non-integer occupancy value (3.96) appear weird considering each sII-512 cage can only be occupied by H2 molecules as an integer number. The reasonable explanation is that some of sII-51264 cages may contain two H2 molecules, some three, and some even four, and the number 3.96, therefore, reflects the overall distribution of the large cage occupancy by hydrogen. A neutron diffraction study into D2 occupancy within sII hydrate, performed by Lokshin et al., confirmed that the number of D2 molecules trapped inside the sII-51264 cages changed reversibly between two and four molecules per cage depending on the system temperature and pressure, while the D2 occupancy in the sII-512 cages persisted as a single molecule per cage [30]. Lattice dynamics calculations performed by Inerbaev et al. [133] found that hydrate cage occupancy by hydrogen molecules affected the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of H2 hydrate to a large extent. The results supported up to four hydrogen molecules occupying the sII-51264 cages while the sII-512 cages remained singly occupied. Finally, molecular-dynamics simulations conducted by Alavi et al. [134] indicated single hydrogen occupancy of sII-512 cages and quadruple hydrogen occupancies of sII-51264 cages. The experimental study conducted by Strobel et al. [33] indicated that the maximum H2 occupancy achievable in the 512 cages of the sII mixed H2/THF hydrate was one hydrogen molecule, leading to a maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 1.0 wt% (Fig. 4I). A second study by Strobel and different co-authors [39] presents Raman spectroscopic analyses of pure hydrogen (sII) and mixed H2/THF (sII) hydrates. The study provides insights into the large (sII-51264) cage occupancy patterns of the hydrogen molecules. For detailed reportage of the same, the interested reader is referred to the original paper. In brief, pure hydrogen hydrate was synthesized at 200 MPa and 250 K, and the Raman spectra of the same was measured at 76 K and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 7 I(a)). The hydrate sample was then heated to 150 K and quenched in liquid nitrogen to 76 K following which the Raman spectra was measured for a second time(Fig. 7I(b)). The heating of the hydrate was to engineer a reduction in the per cage H2 occupancy while quenching would stop this process by stabilizing the hydrate sample. The heat (150 K)/quench (76 K) cycle was repeated a further two times (Fig. 7I(c) and 7I(d)) while measuring the Raman spectra of the hydrate sample at the end of each completed cycle. Based on the progression of the obtained Raman spectra through the afore-mentioned process, the authors concluded that the hydrogen occupancy within the large (sII-51264) cages reduced considerably with every heat/quench cycle completed. A fourth heat/quench cycle ultimately brought about the complete dissociation of the hydrate sample. Based on the rather consistent literature reviewed so far, the idea that sII-51264 cages can be occupied by up to four H2 molecules quickly found universal acceptance within the hydrate research community. The solitary point of contention that persisted was the hydrogen molecule occupancy of the sII-512 cages, although the experimental results and theoretical calculations available thus far, for the most part, supported the notion of single hydrogen occupancy per sII-512 cage. In order to truly understand whether double occupancy of the sII-512 hydrate cages by hydrogen molecules is possible, it is necessary to obtain an accurate Raman spectroscopic analysis and peak assignment for the same. A theoretical study combining molecular dynamic simulations and density functional theory, conducted by Wang et al., aimed to do aid in this search by providing a qualitative guide for determining single and/or double H2 occupancy in the sII-512 cages, based on the calculated Raman frequencies [38,40]. The authors’ calculations suggested that the Raman shift representing double occupancy of the sII-512 cages by H2 molecules would appear around or above 4155 cm−1 which would represent a blue-shift relative to the gas phase (Fig. 7II). Consistent with the theoretical calculations, the experimental work conducted by Lu et al. showed for the first time, markers (two Raman peaks at 4153 cm−1 and 4159 cm−1, respectively) for double occupancy of the sII-512 cages by H2 molecules, through a reaction of H2 gas with N2 hydrates at 243 K and 15 MPa [42]. Since the work by Lu et al. [42], many researchers have confirmed double occupancy of the (sII-512) small cages by H2 molecules. Koh et al. [45] experimentally validated double hydrogen occupancy in the sII-512 cages by pressurizing propane hydrates and isobutane hydrates with H2 gas. The authors reported that by using propane or isobutane as a co-guest, they were able to tune the size of the sII-512 cage; both pure propane hydrate and pure isobutane hydrate, which were the original solid media exposed to hydrogen gas pressure in the study by Koh et al. [45], exhibited slightly larger unit cell lattice parameters (∼0.2 Å) compared to those reported in the literature for pure H2 hydrate or pure THF hydrate. The slight tuning in the sII-512 cage dimensions that could be achieved using propane or isobutane as the hydrate co-guest was sufficient to allow double occupancy of the same by H2 molecules. Park et al. [135] observed double H2 occupancy in the small 512 cages of sII hydrate by reacting H2 gas with mixed N2/THF hydrates and mixed N2/Pyrrolidine hydrates. However, when THF hydrates and pyrrolidine hydrates were exposed to a N2/H2 (50 mol %:50 mol %) gas mixture, only single occupancy of the small cages by H2 was observed. The authors thus inferred that double occupancy of the small sII-512 cages by H2 occurred through the displacement of N2 by H2. Recently, Ahn et al. [48], investigating the formation of hydrogen/natural gas mixed hydrates, found that on pressurizing ice powder with a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (methane + ethane), double hydrogen occupancy in the small cages of the synthesized solid hydrate materialized, irrespective of the hydrate structure formed (sI or sII). The authors separately employed two different feed gas mixtures, a) CH4/C2H6/H2 (46.7/20.0/33.3 mol%) and b) CH4/C2H6/H2 (60.0/6.7/33.3 mol%) for their experiments, which formed sI and sII hydrate, respectively. Finally, Moon et al. [49] formed mixed hydrogen/natural gas hydrate and observed double hydrogen occupancy within the small cages of both sI and sII hydrate, i.e., both sI-512 and sII-512 were found to be doubly occupied by hydrogen molecules. In conclusion, despite the previous controversy surrounding the occupancy of the small (512) cages of sII hydrate by hydrogen molecules, increasing research works now suggest that by employing innovative approaches for the synthesis of H2-containing hydrates, it is possible to achieve double hydrogen occupancy in the small cages of both sI and sII hydrate, namely the sI-512 and sII-512 cages. Raman spectroscopy has proved to be a reliable and convenient tool to analyze the hydrate cage occupancy patterns of the hydrogen molecules. However, the Raman shifts representing double occupancy by hydrogen molecules in the small (sI-512 and sII-512) cages of hydrate, may overlap with the vibrational Raman band of hydrogen gas. Thus, it is worth emphasizing that utmost care should be taken to eliminate any interference from gaseous hydrogen when analyzing the Raman spectra obtained for the various H2-containing hydrate system."
11,Tuning effect,"Despite the thermodynamic stability of mixed H2/THF hydrate at milder phase equilibrium conditions (5 MPa and 279 K), its compromised hydrogen content as a result of THF molecules occupying all or most of the large cages (sII-51264), is still a reason for concern. A question naturally follows, “Is it possible for hydrogen molecules to enter the large cages of the mixed H2/THF hydrate?” Lee et al. [32] suggested that by simply tuning the THF composition below 1 mol%, hydrogen can occupy the large cages of mixed H2/THF hydrates at 12 MPa pressure and 270 K temperature (Fig. 7III). It was claimed that using this tuning mechanism, the hydrogen storage capacity of mixed H2/THF hydrates could be increased to up to ∼4 wt% while retaining hydrate stability at milder pressure and temperature conditions. Following the solid-solution model of van der Waals and Platteeuw [136], the authors argued that when the concentration of THF is lowered considerably, stability of the mixed sII hydrates would require the hydrogen molecules to compete with their THF counterparts to occupy the large 51264 cages. Magic angle spinning (MAS) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of mixed H2/THF hydrate presented in the original paper by Lee et al. [32] do indicate hydrogen occupancy in both the small cage and large cages of mixed H2/THF hydrate at low THF concentrations. Although the assignment for the small cages agrees with those made by other researchers [28,31,33,114,137], this is the only experimental NMR spectrum that has thus far shown hydrogen molecule occupancy in the large cages of mixed H2/THF (sII) hydrate, which makes a qualitative comparison of the assignment for H2-occupied large cages not possible at this stage. Ever since its first mention, the tuning effect for H2-containing hydrates has been questioned frequently. While the tuning mechanism has worked with other gas hydrate forming mixtures, the size of the hydrogen molecule relative to that of the large cage of sII hydrate (H2 is much smaller) has meant that no other researchers have been able to replicate the tuning effect observed by Lee et al. [32], at similar experimental conditions [33,108,138]; perhaps the tuning effect is indeed possible for hydrogen at very high pressure or very low temperature. Strobel et al. [33] investigated the effect of THF concentrations on the amount of hydrogen stored in the mixed H2/THF hydrate. They found that the hydrogen storage capacity remained almost the same for THF concentrations ranging from 5.56 to 0.5 mol%. An in situ Raman spectroscopic investigation for mixed H2/THF (sII) hydrate formed from various THF concentrations (0.01, 0.056, and 0.13 mol%) indicated that hydrogen molecules only occupy the small cages of the mixed hydrate with all large cages stabilized by THF molecules [138]. As mentioned above, at much higher pressures hydrogen molecules may compete with THF for the large sII (51264) cages. Sugahara et al. [37] found that, by exposing hydrogen gas at a pressure of ∼70 MPa to a mixture of solid ice and solid THF (THF concentration of 0.5 mol%), hydrogen molecules can occupy the large cages of the mixed H2/THF (sII) hydrate, as demonstrated by the Raman spectra obtained for the H2 vibrons (Fig. 7IV), thereby increasing the hydrogen storage capacity to 3.4 wt%. Sugahara and the same co-authors [139] further tested the tuning effect imparted by other promoters (acetone, cyclohexanone. Methylcyclohexane) using the same experimental method. It was found that on changing the concentrations of acetone and cyclohexanone at pressures around 74 MPa, hydrogen molecules could compete with acetone and cyclohexanone to occupy the large cages of sII hydrate (sII-51264). However, hydrogen molecules could not compete with methylcyclohexane to occupy the largest cages of sH hydrate (sH-51268) at approximately 75 MPa pressure. The result for sH looks reasonable, and a much higher pressure would be required to stabilize the large cages in sH hydrate. There is also a possibility that such sH hydrate may not exist at such a high pressure, and H2 occupancy in large cages of sH hydrate would remain elusive."
12,Future directions,"A fair comparison of the gravimetric H2 storage capacities for various H2-containing hydrate systems has been presented in Fig. 8 , both experimental values reported in the literature and theoretical values calculated based on the ideal cage occupancies of the different systems. Mao et al. [29] reported an experimentally measured hydrogen storage capacity of 5.3 wt% for pure H2 hydrate which slightly exceeded the theoretical value of 4.97 wt% for fully loaded H2 hydrate (2H2 in sII-512 and 4H2-sII-51264). This was likely caused by experimental error considering the extremely high experimental pressures (250-600 MPa) employed [29]. The mixed H2/THF (sII) hydrate has the second highest hydrogen storage capacity when relying on the tuning effect. However, on its own, the hydrogen storage capacity for mixed H2/THF hydrate is quite low and is theoretically surpassed by that of mixed H2/MTBE (sH) hydrate [36]. Among the more widely studied H2-containing hydrate systems, the ones with the obviously low hydrogen storage capacity (even theoretically with ideal cage occupancy by hydrogen), are mixed H2/TBAB semiclathrate hydrates (SCH) and mixed H2/CO2 (sI) hydrates. Considering the DOE’s 2025 target of 5.5 wt% gravimetric capacity for on-board hydrogen storage systems, only pure H2 hydrate appears to be a competitive hydrogen storage material at the moment for on-board application. However, the severe pressure requirement for the formation and storage of pure H2 hydrate necessitates breakthroughs in the fabrication of inexpensive, high-pressure tanks (able to withstand pressures to the tune of several hundreds of megapascals), which is unlikely to be achieved in a short period. In contrast, thermodynamic promoters possess the properties to substantially moderate the pressure and temperature requirements for H2-containing hydrate formation and storage, thus greatly enhancing the commercial feasibility of hydrate-based hydrogen storage. Although the presence of a thermodynamic promoter compromises the hydrogen storage capacity of the formed solid hydrates, most mixed ‘H2/promoter’ hydrate systems are viewed favourably for stationary applications where the hydrogen storage capacity is not a limiting factor. Specifically, H2-containing sII hydrates formed in the presence of thermodynamic promoters such as THF can be ideal candidates to enable a commercially viable Solid-HyStore technology for targeted long-term, stationary deployment. The many merits of this approach have already been outlined in Table 1. Up to ∼1 wt% (∼116 v/v) hydrogen storage capacity may be achieved in the presence of sII hydrate forming thermodynamic promoters, with one hydrogen molecule occupying each sII-512 cage and one promoter molecule (such as THF) occupying each sII-51264 cage. Double occupancy of the sII-512 cages by H2 molecules and occupancy of the sII-51264 cages by H2 molecules, the latter only enabled by the tuning mechanism discussed in Section 9 prior, are unlikely to occur at the moderate temperature and pressure conditions catering to a practical commercial application. A further challenge towards the development of sII hydrate-based hydrogen storage technology and one that requires immediate attention is the sluggish kinetics of hydrate formation when starting hydrate formation from aqueous solutions. The potential solution could lie in the identification of additives or chemicals that have the potential to provide both thermodynamic and kinetic enhancement to the hydrate formation process. Recently, 1,3-dioxolane (DIOX), a heterocyclic compound closely related to THF, was found to enable rapid formation of CH4-containing sII hydrate while also moderating the thermodynamic (pressure and temperature) requirements for hydrate formation. Thus DIOX acted as a dual-function promoter, providing both thermodynamic and kinetic enhancement to the hydrate formation process [142]. Zhang et al. [50] studied the use of DIOX as a dual-function promoter for H2-contianed hydrate formation. At the experimental pressure and temperature of 12.3 MPa and 271.15 K, respectively, for stirred hydrate growth, the volumetric hydrogen storage capacity achieved in 2 hours for the mixed H2/DIOX (5.56 mol%) system ranged from 24.74 (±1.58) to 26.51 (±1.79) (v/v: volume of gas/volume of hydrate) depending on the available volume for the gas phase. This represented a 21.5–30.2% enhancement over the maximum volumetric hydrogen storage capacity reported for the considerably more studied mixed H2/THF hydrate system. The authors also demonstrated the outstanding recyclability of the 5.56 mol% DIOX aqueous solution over five uninterrupted hydrate formation/dissociation cycles [50]. Further, DIOX is less volatile and less toxic as compared to THF thus making it an attractive option to develop a more environmentally safe Solid-HyStore technology [143]. Future research efforts pertaining to H2-containing sII hydrate could be concentrated on identifying and optimizing the use of other potential thermodynamic/dual-function promoters such as DIOX. Various amino acids have been evaluated as kinetic promoters for gas hydrate formation in the past [144,145]. Amino acids are environmentally benign molecules and exhibit excellent kinetic promotion properties in conjunction with a clean mode of operation (no foam formation). The absence of foam is a key point in favour of amino acids compared to surfactants, historically the most employed class of kinetic hydrate promoters and for whom foam formation is a constant accompaniment, especially during hydrate dissociation, thereby compromising the ease of operation. Furthermore, nanomaterials such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene oxide (GO), etc., have also been found to act as kinetic promoters for gas hydrate formation [146]. Identifying the correct kinetic promoter for H2-containing hydrate formation could also be a promising approach to speed up the hydrate formation process and thus enhance the viability of the Solid-HyStore technology. A viable hydrate-based hydrogen storage and transport technology would require long-term stable storage of the formed hydrate at moderate pressure and temperature conditions, which may or may not be different from the ones used for the hydrate formation process. An elegant and space-effective way of storing gas hydrates is to pelletize the formed solid masses into uniform shapes, although given the thermodynamic requirements for hydrate stability, pelletizing hydrates is never a straightforward task. Concentrated effort into establishing technical expertise and developing adequate infrastructure is thus necessary to simplify the H2-containing hydrate pellet production process and improve its efficiency. Demonstrating stable storage of H2-containing hydrate (hydrate formed in the presence of a thermodynamic or dual function promoter that also gets incorporated inside the hydrate structure) at moderate pressure and temperature conditions will further boost the feasibility of Solid-HyStore technology. Fig. 9 represents the envisioned path to commercialization for the Solid-HyStore technology. To the best of our knowledge, literature studies presently available on hydrate-based hydrogen storage probe the subject at the lab scale, with the current maturity of the technology consequently lying between TRLs (Technology Readiness Level) 1 and 2, as per the conceived TRL ladder shown in Fig. 9. For the Solid-HyStore technology to climb the TRL ladder, scale becomes important. Further, large-scale production and storage of H2-containing hydrate need to be coupled with rapid gas uptake to permit practical operation. However, the potential costs and technical issues associated with large-scale applications cannot be identified by lab-scale research. Thus, it is necessary to dedicate time and resources to study the scale up of the Solid-HyStore technology."
13,Conclusion,"Solidified hydrogen storage via clathrates (Solid-HyStore technology) provides an option for non-explosive, long-term stationary storage of hydrogen at moderate temperature and pressure conditions. The past two decades have seen significant progress on the various H2-containing hydrate systems, specifically in terms of the understandings of a) the macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the systems, b) the hydrate structures synthesized, and the cage occupancy patterns of the hydrogen molecules at a microscopic scale and c) accurate determination of the theoretical hydrogen storage capacities for the various hydrate systems and those achieved experimentally. However, the inherently sluggish rate of H2 uptake, especially when forming hydrates from bulk aqueous solution, and the lack of process scale-up data for the technology hamper its potential for industrial adoption. The present review meticulously evaluates the features and limitations of the pure H2 hydrate system, as well as the various mixed H2-containing hydrate systems. This is followed by extensive discussions on multiple occupancies of the hydrate cages by H2 molecules and the tuning mechanism for H2-containing hydrates. Finally, the immediate challenges facing the development of the Solid-HyStore technology and the scope for future work are identified. We hope this review will inspire and motivate more scientists to investigate this exciting new technology for potential long-term hydrogen storage and help further its practical applicability."
