0,Introduction of strategies to improve fermentative hydrogen production,"The continuous development of processes serving bio-based product formation is a way to promote the sustainability that these materials offer [1]. The production of biohydrogen, a potential biofuel and renewable energy carrier is governed by several biotic and abiotic factors. In the former group, hydrogen synthesizing bacteria, as microscopic bio-engines play a key role and power dark fermentative reactors. They act as the pumping heart of the technology and their performances are substantially affected by the fermentation conditions (abiotic parameters). The effectiveness of hydrogen forming bioreactors is primarily assessed by taking H2 productivity and yield into account. Therefore, the ultimate aim of all the research efforts taken is to establish attractive systems in both terms, which rely heavily on the whole cell living biocatalysts. Nowadays the dark fermentative route is the most practically applicable to carry out biotechnological hydrogen production, however, this process has particular limits since a considerable part of the substrates used are converted into various soluble metabolic products rather than H2. This means that the energy chemically stored in the raw material is not fully recoverable in the form of molecular hydrogen gas and a liquid residue with high chemical oxygen demand is obtained. This fraction is the major side-product of dark fermentative hydrogen technology and can be considered as a multi-compound mixture containing short-chain volatile fatty acids (e.g. acetic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid) and other constituents such as alcohols (e.g. ethanol, butanol), depending on the circumstances i.e. type of inoculum [2]. The notable formation of these substances (acids, alcohols) is one of the greatest challenges for fermentative hydrogen technology since it significantly cuts the achievable H2 yields (mol H2 mol−1 substrate) and dictates economy. Up to now, not a single organism (wild-type strains) has been discovered in the nature that could exceed the Thauer-limit, equaling to 4mol H2 mol−1 glucose and being far behind the theoretical maximum of 12mol H2 mol−1 glucose [3,4]. This is definitely a key driver and many efforts have been put in the recent decades to facilitate the utilization of the organic matter rich spent media and push the upper bound performances. In particular, downstream-associated processes ( Fig. 1) have been introduced and spotlighted [5]. In this repertoire, the most traditional complementary option is anaerobic digestion (methane production), where organic components are degraded to get methane [6,7]. In that way, a blend of hydrogen and methane, called biohythane can be obtained and considered as a clean vehicle fuel possessing beneficial combustion properties [8,9]. In such a sequential (two-step) design, biogas formation, as second stage after the hydrogen producing reactor, might be replaced by photo-fermentation when dark fermentation effluent is biotransformed into extra hydrogen by the aid of (sun)light [10,11]. Besides, additional competing techniques referred as Bioelectrochemical Systems (BESs) are also among the possibilities [12]. Traditional BESs are built in two-chamber arrangement, where an anaerobic anode and an aerobic/anaerobic cathode are spatially detached – mostly by a thin proton-selective membrane – and at the same time connected by external wiring. For dark fermentation, two derivatives of BESs, namely microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrohydrogenesis cells (MEC) are the most potential systems [13,14]. In principles, both in MFC and MEC, special electrochemically-active microorganisms work under anaerobic environment as part of a biofilm formed on the anode surface and have the capability to transform a wide range of organic streams – e.g. wastewaters as well as the effluent of the hydrogen producing bioreactors – either into bioelectric power (in case of MFC) or hydrogen (in case of MEC) [15–17]. Therefore, MFC and MEC offer solutions to assist the conversion of biohydrogen production residue and simultaneously fulfill the dual aim of waste (effluent) reduction and energy (carrier) generation (from the effluent) [18]. The further attractiveness of these methods is the reduced ecological impact since the theoretical cathode-side products of MFC and MEC are only water and H2, respectively. Additionally, it has turned out that the introduction of MEC technology could lead to impressive, 9.6mol H2 mol−1 glucose hydrogen yield, representing 80% of the theoretical maximum [19]. Hence, dark fermentative biohydrogen production integrated with MEC stands as a hot field for research. Another possibility to utilize the volatile fatty acid-rich fermentation effluent is the production of biologically synthesized polyesters e.g. polyhydroxyalkanoate [20,21] which could have an industrial market [22]. Some alternative routes for the valorization of dark fermentative effluents in the frame of “Hydrogen biorefinery” have been introduced by Sarma et al. [23]. Beyond these downstream-side methods exploiting the potential of high energy content fermentation spent media, various paths of upstream-related process improvements have been applied. These include, but are not limited to the optimization of reactor operation and fermentation circumstances, basically temperature, pH, substrate concentration, hydraulic retention time, organic loading intensity [24–27], hydrogen recovery by membrane separation to reduce partial pressure and purify the product [28–32], reactor design [33–36] and inoculum selection/pretreatment [37–39]. All of these methods aim to ensure better surrounding to the microbial catalysts and thereby achieve better gas formation performance. Moreover, the employment of recombinant (metabolic engineered) strains appeared as a straight way forward to exceed the low to moderate actual gas production capacities [4,40]. In addition to the already referred paths of improvement, the strategy of bioaugmentation – being in the scope of the current paper – has also demonstrated feasibility for process intensification. In hydrogen producing fermenters either pure or mixed cultures can be used as inoculum, and their characteristics are of high importance. When pure cultures are put to work, there is a substantial demand for sterility. However, applications operating under aseptic conditions are practically disadvantageous especially when industrial/agricultural secondary materials are to be utilized. This is because such feedstocks may severely contaminate the reactor by the indigenous and environmental microflora and thus pose a threat on the overall system performance. Due to this handicap with single-strain bioreactors, more robust and fairly performing mixed consortia are preferred to work with [41,42]. Nonetheless, pure bacterial isolates possessing well-known and decent hydrogen-forming activity can still be employed under real (“industrial”) conditions, potentially for the bioaugmentation of mixed culture reactors. Bioaugmentation is reportedly an effective tool for various biotechnological applications where indigenous or allochthonous strains are present in abundant number, support the removal/biotransformation of hazardous waste, undesired compounds and other raw materials so as to enhance the processes [43,44]. Compiling this review study was driven by the motivation of providing an insight to the scientific readership pertaining the present status, opportunities and recent developments of bioaugmented fermentative hydrogen production and hence, facilitate knowledge transfer for possible future studies. In other words, it was aimed to present what has been achieved and found out so far in the field of microbiologically augmented H2 fermentation, particularly to highlight how the various research works have contributed to the improvement and enrichment of the methodological approaches and outcomes. Subsequently, based on this literature overview, a critical analysis of the results has been performed."
1,The role and features of bioaugmentation in dark fermentative hydrogen production,"Specific microorganisms, in accordance with their metabolic pathways are able to decompose a broad range of organic matter into various products i.e. hydrogen gas. Although bacteria have preference towards certain compounds as substrates, in many cases, they are featured with the capability of adaption as a response to the challenging conditions e.g. when uncommon substances enter the metabolism. The performance of a given microbial community to effectively (bio)convert an organic material into hydrogen is highly determined by the environmental matrix in which the reaction takes place. Basically, there are two particular routes to increase the fermentation capacity of the indigenous consortia working in the hydrogen producing bioreactor, called as ● biostimulation or bioenhancement ● bioaugmentation. The former means the supplementation of nutrients to boost the cell activity, while the latter supposes the addition of carefully selected strain(s) to the native population located in the fermenter [45]. To intensify a process via bioaugmentation that will result in the alteration of biodiversity, either screened, naturally-occurring (wild-type) isolates or their metabolic engineered alternatives can be used [46]. In the frame of bioaugmented hydrogen production (as detailed by the literature examples in the upcoming sections), mono- and dual-cultures as well as mixed microflora with higher complexity have been explored so far to create metabolically more versatile populations that can utilize a wider spectrum of substrates. The advantage of well-defined cultures – when only a single organism or a couple of selected bacterial isolates are applied together – give freedom to the scientists to address certain parameters e.g. the degree of functional redundancy among individual species and hence provide a greater conviction and better understanding about the interactions taking place among the species [47]. On the other hand, diverse microbial consortia e.g. anaerobic digester sludge, wastewater sludge, etc. can perform under non-sterile conditions. This feedback is important to reveal the potential of bioaugmentation for future (scaled-up) implementations and allows the investigation of relationships between the competitive and synergetic bacterial communities existing in real case environment [48]. Furthermore, mixed cultures with complex enzymatic apparatus can be privileged for the bioconversion of complex biomass into hydrogen gas since a single strain alone may be unable to suitably deal with a variety of substances e.g. (poly)saccharides [49]. When enhanced performance, reduced instability and greater flexibility are experienced in a bioaugmented reactor using multi-strain “designer communities”, they are likely associated with the complementary metabolism of the augmenting strain(s) and the host bacterial community originally employed for inoculation. In other words, the reason behind the different efficiencies of non-augmented and augmented populations can be correlated with the advantageous interactions taking place since the inherent properties of the supplementing microorganisms – such as colonization or biofilm formation ability, growth rate, hydrolytic enzyme activity – play a defining role and as a result, better utilization of complex substrates as well as higher hydrogen production capacity may be expected [50]. Nevertheless, in bioaugmented systems, basically two scenarios are possible. In the first case, the culture(s) added to the reactor may have only small contribution to the process efficiency due to their insufficient capabilities to integrate to the bacterial population, which failure is mostly caused by the adverse environmental factors e.g. operating conditions [51,52]. It is important to note that the successfulness of bioaugmentation requires the chosen organism(s) to be culturable in the particular broth since in many cases the strains fail to grow in certain (artificial) media. In the second case, however, when the microorganism becomes a stable member of the community, the augmentation can result in the beneficial enrichment of the community and this harmony facilitates bioreactor performance or in other words, enhances H2 production. It is good to keep in mind that the robustness, persistency and fate of bioaugmented culture could be case-specific and therefore, the preliminary characterization of the bacterial isolates is initially suggested to judge their appropriateness for the augmentation of the respective bioprocesses [53]. In dark fermentation, this should cover initial tests to assess the biochemical hydrogen producing potential of the microorganisms not only from widespread substances e.g. glucose but also applying C6 and C5 saccharides such as mannose, galactose, xylose, arabinose and disaccharides e.g. cellobiose or maltose. Such “ability check” or “preliminary screening” – performed with components that can be obtained from the hydrolysis of various bioresources – provides information about the potential and efficiency of the particular living biocatalysts ( Fig. 2) [54]. For instance, results of galactose based hydrogen fermentation can well contribute to evaluate the feasibility of microalgae biomass since this sugar is one of the main constituents found in their cell walls [4,55,56]. Additionally, the fermentation of arabinose requires a complex enzyme apparatus and therefore is somewhat challenging and demands specialized microorganisms [57]. The effect of specific culture addition (microbial augmentation) may be assessed in several distinct ways. One approach may consider the fermentation as a “black box”, when the primary goal is to quantitatively correlate the input and output (response) variables e.g. by statistical experimental design [58] without going into details regarding the underlying biological mechanism occurring in the background. A further possibility of assessment is referred as a “white box” approach, which relies on molecular biological methods such as microbial consortium analysis (e.g. DGGE, FISH, RT-PCR, etc.) [59,60] and can be recommended to deliver a deeper comprehension of the bioaugmentation. This sort of process evaluation supports to reveal the functions of the individual strains/microbial groups as well as the dynamism of the community and subsequently, assists to optimize the composition of an efficient augmenting mixture [54]. Furthermore, studying the phylogenetic relationships of the bacteria could be suggested to perceive and estimate their ability to co-exist within a diverse microbial consortium [47]. Although the anaerobic bacterial populations taking part in raw matter hydrolysis and consecutive H2 generation are normally rich and flexible [61], their support via bioaugmentation might steer the system toward a better microbial equilibrium that in turn, shifts the bioreactor performance to more attractive regions [62]. From this point of view, the significance of community ecology was underlined by the recent article of Herrero and Stuckey [63] and emphasis was set on the understanding of signaling and concomitant interactions between various strains and/or their groups since these are key requirements to engineer complex communities. It was enlightened that Pareto-type interpretation of the microbial ecosystem can help to reveal the dominant bacteria of the process and find explanation concerning the possible role of species [63]. This progress can be assisted by the microbial monitoring techniques [59,60], which, as stated, are intended to facilitate the knowledge about the efficiency, behavior and response of (hydrogen producing) bioreactors to the composition of the microbial population. Lately, in an elegant review by Hung et al. [64] it was summarized that even though Clostridium and Enterobacter are the most important microorganisms participating in biocatalytic H2 evolution, other bacteria can fulfill different functions e.g. as granulation enhancers, redox-maintainers (removers of toxic oxygen gas), hydrolysers of complex materials, etc. Thus, these members of the culture can support the long-term stabilization of the bioreactor and may be viewed as potential candidates for augmentation targets. However, there are cases when particular organisms demonstrate negative influence and their presence may lead to upset operation and subsequent deterioration of the performance. For instance, members of lactic- and propionic acid bacteria hand-in-hand with homoacetogenic microorganisms have been shown accountable for H2 consumption and many times – despite some overcoming strategies developed already [65] – present unresolved challenge in dark fermentative hydrogen production [66]. In the evaluation of “what part the different cells play in the bioprocess”, fermentation microbiology and biochemical activity assays (e.g. via measuring diverse enzymatic, such as cellulolytic, ligninolytic, etc. activities) could also have utility. These, in particular, should involve the preparation of either solid or liquid media in which the specific activities of interest can be verified after inoculation [67]. It is important to mark down that the method of bioaugmentation might sound relatively simple but many attempts were proven insufficient (due to lack of expected activity and negligible growth) without clarifying the reasons behind. To address and dissect the causes of failures, Dueholm et al. [68] highlighted the necessity of advanced molecular techniques and state-of-the-art sequencing technologies. In essence, a multi-step protocol has been developed – including strain-specific qPCR, RT-qPCR, DNA stable isotope-probing and eGFP-tagging – for the assessment of bioaugmentation strategy [68]. The approach was employed with success to monitor the activity and survival of Pseudomonas monteilii, which was used for bioaugmentation in a case study on aromatic hydrocarbon degradation by activated sludge process. The methodological chain was considered generally applicable by the authors to report on the fate of bioaugmentation. Additionally, molecular biological techniques applied for the monitoring and assessment of bioaugmented hydrogen-producing cultures are summarized in Table 2. It could be stated that FISH and Q-PCR techniques were the mostly employed ones for analyzing the dynamic changes of the populations. As indicated by Fang et al. [69], FISH technique could be used to monitor and quantify the relative abundance of photosynthetic (Rhodobacter spharoides) and dark fermentative bacteria (Clostridium butyricum) during syntrophic hydrogen production in co-culture concept. Savichtcheva et al. [70], employed the advanced molecular techniques (FISH and Q-PCR) to follow the progress taking place in an artificially constructed microbial consortium (Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium felsineum and C. butyricum). As a result, a fast, two-step FISH protocol was introduced. Both the FISH and Q-PCR based analysis measured the relative abundance of the individual bacterial culture and it was concluded that Q-PCR based analysis provided accurate feedback about the changes of the bacterial community structure during hydrogen bioproduction. Furthermore, Zeidan et al. [71], Zhang et al. [72], and Masset et al. [73] relied on Q-PCR based analysis for the rapid determination and distribution of the bacterial copy numbers in the bioaugmented cultures. Besides the methods already mentioned, PCR-DGGE based analysis was also exploited to check the dynamics of the microbially augmented hydrogen producing culture. For instance, it was applied with success by Sivagurunathan et al. [74] to report on the alterations in dominant bacterial populations using enriched mixed cultures and augmenting strain Enterobacter cloacae. It was suggested by the outcomes that evaluating the microbial shifts during the hydrogen production is helpful to assess the optimal conditions for the biomass growth, enhanced substrate utilization and hydrogen production performances. Overall, analyzing community structure, functional characteristics of the species and the diversity of the ecological system can be equally important to reveal the cause-effect relationships in a mixed (bioaugmented) culture [47]. Nevertheless, besides microbial background assessment, process monitoring is also beneficial to elucidate the phenomena taking place during the fermentation. It should consider ● substrate consumption, ● the released intermediary compound(s), ● final product(s) and ● biomass growth. This feedback will outline the trends, the kinetic pattern as well as the possibility of consecutive and competitive reactions. Such information can be associated with the dynamism of the ecosystem and hence supports to draw more solid conclusions. Moreover, combining the information about substrate uptake and gaseous/liquid phase metabolic product distribution with the known stoichiometry of the bioreactions involved may be extremely useful (i) to determine the mass balance and (ii) to estimate the ability of the culture to produce hydrogen and other metabolic products discharged by the cellular metabolism. In addition, the outcomes of mass balance profiling can be further subjected to develop metabolic flux analysis, which is a powerful tool to reveal to what extent the various pathways participate in the entire cellular functions and anabolic/catabolic processes [75]. From another point of view, applying bioaugmentation for hydrogen production can be evaluated both in batch and continuous operation. The data from the latter kind of systems are markedly valuable since in general, continuous systems are in closer link with realistic implementations. The behavior of a microbial community performing in continuous hydrogen fermentation may be completely different in comparison with discontinuous reactor [76]. For example, the distribution of soluble metabolic products and hence hydrogen production yields and rates could vary in a pronounced manner. This may be attributed with stress factors such as the risk of wash out, which occurs when the growth of strains cannot keep pace with the serious dilution impact of increased hydraulic retention time (HRT). Under continuous flow conditions, the competition of species takes place as they try to claim their own ecological niche so that it can induce a population shift. Thus, the adaptation and predominance of the augmenting culture(s) will largely be determined by the relative growth rates, being affected by the fermentation circumstances. Therefore, proof-of-concept studies for bioaugmented hydrogen generation process should involve measurements carried out in continuous systems build upon preliminary batch runs [77]. Both in continuous and batch applications, the configuration and design of the bioreactor is certainly a factor to aid the acclimation and long-term surviving ability of the particular microorganism(s). These aims can be accomplished e.g. by membrane bioreactors and granulated systems, which can maintain relatively high cell concentrations as well as longer biomass residence times [33,34,78,79]. Table 1 presents a summary about the literature studies that applied bioaugmentation to improve fermentative hydrogen production. In these works, bacterial augmentation of biohydrogen technology could serve different, but equally important purposes [80–82], such as ● accelerating reactor start-up, ● protecting the indigenious microflora e.g. from organic loading shocks or in other words, reducing the vulnerabilities in biohydrogen reactors, ● increasing the substrate degrading capacity and last but not least, ● enhancing the yield and formation rate of the target product hydrogen. In the following sub-sections, these aspects are discussed and elaborated ( Table 2)."
2,Application of bioaugmentation in conventional dark fermentative hydrogen production,"2.1 Application of bioaugmentation in conventional dark fermentative hydrogen production 2.1.1 Bioreactor start-up and performance recovery Start-up of hydrogen fermenters is a crucial step with great contribution to long-term, steady-state performances [34]. Depending on the process, the enrichment and acclimation of hydrogen-producer microorganisms or in other words, the establishment of the bioreactor can be a rather long process. Nevertheless, based on literature results, bioaugmentation with special organisms has the potential to remarkably decrease this time. For example, Guo et al. [83] applied Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 to cut the start-up time demand of a continuous, mixed culture reactor. It was found that the properly chosen functional bacteria induced immediate hydrogen generation after its load, meaning that there was no observable lag phase. However, the augmenting culture to native culture ratio was identified as a key variable and indicates the inoculum size is a crucial parameter to be optimized. Another conclusion of the work was that the mode of culture addition (batch vs. sequential) counts, as well. Besides faster start-up, the employment of E. harbinense B49 modified the dominant metabolism of the microbial community and as a result of the bioaugmentation procedure, 1.36Lg−1 VSS d−1 peak hydrogen evolution rate could be attained, representing a more than 20% increment in comparison with the non-augmented case. In addition to quick and efficient reactor start-up, tolerance to high organic loading rates can be a substantial requirement for viable hydrogen fermenters. In these conditions, volatile fatty acids – as accompanying, secondary products of H2 fermentation – are formed in larger quantities that are insufficiently broken down by the anaerobes catalyzing biohydrogenesis. Consequently, the pH remarkably falls and an inhibition of hydrogen production can occur. To investigate the feasibility of bioaugmentation in substrate overloaded reactors, Goud et al. [51] employed various acidogenic microorganisms, namely Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Lysinibacillus fusiformis. It was demonstrated that the bioreactor inoculated with anaerobic sludge was able to tolerate food waste concentrations up to 30gL−1, while further increase to 50gL−1 caused strong depression of hydrogen generation efficiency due to substrate overloading. At that point, bioaugmentation by the species referred above was carried out. It has been documented that there was a notable and rapid increase in the hydrogen producing capacity in all bioaugmentation cases, proving that it was possible to regain hydrogen producing bioreactor performance after it had been declined due to the accumulated soluble metabolic products. However, its extent depended on the particular strain. Such a prompt response of the microbial community to the presence of the augmenting microorganism correlated well with the report of Guo et al. [82]. It was evidenced that the pure cultures inoculated into the system took an effect in a way that they restored the pH to the advantageous range of 4.5–5.5 and simultaneously helped the organic matter removal. In agreement with the findings of Guo et al. [83], a well-detectable shift in the profile of soluble metabolites took place that was attributed to the integration of the augmenting bacteria into the indigenious mixed culture. In a follow-up study by Venkata Mohan׳s group, a hydrid system was designed where dark fermentative biohydrogen process was augmented with photosynthetic culture in order to biologically control the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and hence avoid the inhibition of acidogenic biocatalysts [84]. This combination of those different function microorganisms in a single reactor has appeared successful since the hybrid system ensured 40% improvement from hydrogen generation point of view and at the same time, regulated the VFA concentration to a sustainable level and increased the COD elimination capacity. 2.1.2 Biohydrogen fermentation performance from complex solid wastes In these days, harvesting energy from recalcitrant organic matter such as lignocellulose biomass e.g. microalgae and food waste is a primary goal [4,85,86]. Furthermore, the utilization of crops with industrial recognition – e.g. sugarcane or residues such as Jatropha waste [87] – is of high importance in order to generate valuable products such as renewable energy carrier H2. In general, pretreatment methods are applied to structurally destroy these kinds of materials and enhance their digestibility in subsequent fermentation [88]. However, these techniques are energy intense and hence, add an extra cost to the process. These drawbacks might be overcome by bioaugmentation method. The anaerobic utilization of complex, lignocellulosic substances is a complicated task, where hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step [4]. Therefore, Kuo and co-workers [89] bioaugmented a hydrogenation reactor in order to improve its efficacy from napiergrass and kitchen waste, comprising mostly of vegetable derivatives. The authors experienced facilitated hydrolysis by supplying the reactor with cellulolytic bacteria, Clostridium sp. TCW1, which shows close relation with Clostridium thermocellum. As a result, a dramatic raise in the biochemical hydrogen potential was noticed since the specific H2 evolution rate has been almost 9-times increased from 4mL H2 h−1 g−1 VSS to 35mL H2 h−1 g−1 VSS, indicating the success of strain complementing strategy. In another case, Ren et al. [90] examined the use of various bacterial isolates to decompose cellulosic organic matter (microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn stalk) and simultaneously deliver hydrogen. It was an important outcome of the work that the augmentation of one pure culture with another one (“co-culture concept”) led to more noticeable gas formation capacities in comparison with the single pure isolates. In particular, culturing Clostridium acetobutilycum and E. harbinense B49 could be characterized with high cellulose hydrolytic as well as hydrogen producing capability. This incorporation of microorganisms resulted in approximately 85mL H2 L−1 h−1 productivity coupled with 70% cellulose hydrolysis, while the monoculture of C. acetobutilycum produced only 33mL H2 L−1 h−1 with 50% cellulose decomposition. These indicate the successful implementation of bioaugmentative process and suggest that the union of a good hydrogen producer and an efficient cellulose hydrolyzer is a beneficial way to go in biohydrogen research. To realize improved hydrogen formation from yeast waste, Chou et al. [91] applied Clostridium beijerinckii, C. butyricum and Bacillus thermoamylovorans to construct alternative bacterial mixtures in “co-culture configuration”. As it was tentatively confirmed, B. thermoamylovorans contributed well to the reduced induction (lag) phase of gas generation, which was attributed to its advantageous saccharification, solubilization and biomass conversion capability. Similar experiences were reported by Guo et al. [83] pertaining decreased time-demand of reactor start-up after augmentation. Recently, Guo et al. [92] subjected acid pretreated corn stalk to dark fermentative hydrogen production using thermally treated cow dung compost as seed source. In course of the experiments, one parameter in the scope was the applicability of strain enhancement technique by Bacillus sp. FS2011. It was deducted that the bioaugmentation with this bacteria yielded higher amounts of H2, however, the impact seemed to be inoculum size dependent since dosages exceeding 10% caused the depression of process efficiency. These findings are in good agreement with those previously reported by Guo et al. [83] and re-verifies that inoculum size is of concern to design a bioaugmentation procedure. In an earlier research, Chang et al. [93] addressed the construction of functional consortia involving ruminal microflora to efficiently degrade cellulosic organic matter (napiergrass) into hydrogen gas in the frame of “simultaneous saccharafication and fermentation”. The selective enrichment of hydrogen producers expressing holocellulose decomposing activity was carried out in repeated-batch experiments and steady population comprising of Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Ethanoligenens and Desulfovibrio could be obtained. The augmentation of hydrogen producing biosystems by such systematically enriched bacteria can represent a way ahead since it can be presumed that the deployment of strains possessing hydrolytic as well as hydrogen fermentation ability will yield more attractive bioprocesses [4]. Besides the carefully picked non-native microorganisms, the indigenous bacterial microflora naturally contained in the targeted waste bioresources can also be used for augmentation by as a part of “self-fermentation” strategy, e.g. as reported by Marone et al. [54]. The authors dedicated an investigation to the feasibility of non-sterilized and non-pretreated vegetable (kitchen) waste for biohydrogen generation. To intensify the biohydrogen formation process, few strains (Buttiauxella sp. 4, Rahnella sp. 10 and Raoultella sp. 47) were isolated from the feedstock itself and thereafter applied for bioaugmentation with an inoculum size of 10%. It was registered that each and every pure bacterial isolates supported the hydrogen production since there has been an approximately 3–4 times increase in the hydrogen yields in comparison to the control experiments. Nevertheless, the most noticeable improvement of the process was accomplished when the three pure cultures were mixed and added together to the fermentation starting materials, which indicates an apparent syntrophy of the strains. Nkemka et al. [94] conducted a feasibility study on hydrogen production from corn silage and cattail applying a rumen fungus, Piromyces rhizinflata for the augmentation of anaerobic mixed culture. Although it has been evidenced that hydrogen yield did not change notably after augmentation, it rather enhanced the gas production. It reflects an advantage from digestion time point of view, which is a crucial process indicator of efficient lignocellulose hydrogen fermentation [4]. These outcomes implied the suitability of bioaugmentation technique as an alternative to energy intense chemical and thermal raw material pretreatment. In the line of studies dealing with the utiliziation of hardly fermentable materials to hydrogen, the results by Kotay and Das [47] is noteworthy, as well. They have built their work on constructing an artificial mixed culture by encompassing three hydrogen producing bacteria, E. cloacae IIT-BT 08, Citrobacter freundii IIT-BT L139 and Bacillus coagulans IIT-BT S1 in order to augment biohydrogen fermentation from pretreated (sterilized) sewage sludge. This material can be considered as a renewable energy source being available in bulk quantities globally. It is rich in nutrients, which makes it a feasible substrate for dark fermentative hydrogen production. It was shown that the defined consortium of the three abovementioned strains has led to higher hydrogen yields than obtained in other, non-augmented reactor processing sewage sludge as substrate. This improved efficacy could be ascribed to the amylase, cellulose, xylanase, lipase and protease activity of the consortium that presented versatile metabolic properties [95]. 2.1.3 Biohydrogen fermentation performance from wastewaters Efforts making the valorization of high organic content industrial by-products i.e. wastewaters possible may lead to self-sufficient, energy independent technologies. Therefore, wastewater based hydrogen research has definitely been in the focus of many investigations and holds the promise to leave bench-scale and accomplish scaling-up [4,96,97]. To help the development of biohydrogen technology from wastewaters, various authors have sought the applicability of microbiological augmentation with various degrees of success. Lately, Kumar et al. [77] have concentrated on the biotransformation of beverage industrial wastewater to hydrogen gas in a dark fermentative process using Escherichia coli (XL1-BLUE) for the enrichment (bioaugmentation) of sewage sludge. This strain was tested earlier both in batch [24,98] and continuous [25] systems, however, only in aseptic conditions. It was concluded that the E. coli could enhance the biochemical hydrogen potential from the wastewater substrate as compared to the non-augmented control experiment. Moreover, it was an outcome of the investigation that the addition of organic nitrogen sources (tryptone, yeast extract) together with the strain could result in further increment of hydrogen formation performance, implying that such compounds might have stimulating effect on the bacterial community because of their nitrogen, phosphorous and other growth factor content. In addition, the use of such facultative anaerobic bacteria can be an attractive way to biologically eliminate the dissolved O2 from the system and restore the adequate redox potential (−300 to 400mV against SHE) of the media and avoid biocatalyst inhibition. In an earlier study, Venkata Mohan et al. [99] have dealt with the degradation of chemical wastewater applying the bioaugmentation approach in a sequencing biofilm reactor. To treat this hazardous waste of industrial origin, selectively enriched kanamycin resistant anaerobic mixed culture was employed to reinforce the bioprocess. After culture loading, there was a positive gradient in the hydrogen evolution capability of the system and at the end, the augmented bioreactor fairly outperformed its non-augmented counterpart since the difference in H2 yields was more than 60%. In another publication, Lazaro et al. [100] subjected high chemical oxygen demand and high macronutrient content sugarcane vinasse to hydrogen production. Vinasse is a potential feedstock for biohydrogen fermentation which is generated in biorefineries at elevated temperature, e.g. in distillation columns of alcoholic liquor production [101,102]. It has come to light from the measurements that incubation temperature (mesophilic vs. thermophilic range) considerably affected the gas generation performance, which was correlated with the microbial composition. In the course of strain identification, Clostridium acetobutylicum was found among some others under mesophilic circumstances. Its isolate was shown to produce H2 gas with relatively high yield (1.8mol H2 mol−1 glucose) and therefore, its application was encouraged by the authors for the bioaugmentation of mixed consortia from complex substrates. 2.1.4 Viability of bioaugmentated hydrogen production in continuous systems As described earlier, the longer-term experiences with continuous, augmented hydrogen generating bioreactors are essential to corroborate bioaugmentation in systems that are favored for commercialization. In this regard, a fewer number of researches have been carried out and can be analyzed. Xing et al. [52] used a chemostat to study the feasibility of non-sterile hydrogen production from glucose by selecting E. harbinense YUAN-3 for bioaugmentation purposes. It was demonstrated that the referred organism could withstand the continuous operation applying dilution rates in the range of 0.2–0.6h−1, where its auto-flocculative traits have played a key role. PCR-DGGE analysis indicated the dominancy of E. harbinense even after certain invader bacteria had shown up, which suggests the potential applicability in larger-scale applications. In a more recent study, Pattra et al. [48] carried out augmentative hydrogen fermentation experiments in CSTR running under non-sterile circumstances. The strain employed was a well-known one, C. butyricum and was expected to improve the conversion of sugarcane juice into biohydrogen. The results proved that gradually decreased hydraulic retention times were accompanied by higher H2 gas yield and productivity, where C. butyricum could still efficiently co-exist together with the normal consortia according to steady-state microbial population analysis. As introduced already above, Venkata Mohan and coauthors conducted bioaugmentative hydrogen production experiments using industrial chemical wastewater [99] and food waste [51]. It was an important conclusion that the bioaugmentation could last even in multiple cycles, showing that the augmenting consortia was able to actively participate in the hydrogenation reaction for long-terms, which facilitates the application towards industrialization."
3,Opportunities of bioaugmentation in auxiliary technologies of fermentative hydrogen production,"As introduced in Section 1, traditional, one-stage hydrogen fermentation is an extensively studied process having the serious constrain of intensive soluble by-product formation. Therefore, to make biotechnological hydrogen production more sustainable and energetically appealing, several two-step systems by coupling hydrogen fermenters to supplementary applications such as (i) anaerobic digestion and (ii) microbial fuel cells were designed. These second-stage methods utilizing the residue of dark hydrogen fermentation were applied with different degrees of success and researchers still put upgrading efforts to enhance the overall feasibility of the integrated bioprocess. In the frame of that work, it has been realized that bioaugmentation can fit and intensify not only the conventional hydrogen fermenters (the first main stage) – as discussed thoroughly in this review – but also the complementary methane and bioelectricity generation ( Fig. 3). For example, it was demonstrated that the bacterial augmentation of biogas production by specific hydrogen producing microorganisms e.g. E. cloacae and Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus resulted in a markedly positive impact on the process efficiency both under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions [103,104]. This improvement was explained by the syntropic cross effects of the species in the anaerobic digester, where the presence and availability of H2 can have a regulatory role concerning the whole process efficacy [103,104]. Moreover, another important experience was that C. saccharolyticus could be preserved during semi-continuous reactor operation even for several months, which indicates the potential of this approach in an industrial level [103]. In another recent investigation [61], bacteria such as Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans, Clostridium cellulovorans and Fibrobacter succinogenes as well as their co-cultures were found to improve biomethane capacity of brewery spent grain, which was attributed to augmented hydrolytic activity of the consortia. Better hydrolysis results in higher amount of accessible substrates to the members in the chain-reaction of biogas formation (acetogens, methanogens) and therefore aids the performance. In case of microbial fuel cells, Wang et al. [105] have examined the bioaugmentation technique in a single-chamber, air-cathode system. In their case, a mixed culture previously adapted to the solid substrate was loaded to the MFC to directly turn corn stover waste into bioelectric potential. The results suggested that the augmenting microbes enhanced the digestibility of the recalcitrant cellulosic structure, facilitated the release of soluble components, which could be well consumed by the anode-surface living, exoelectrogene bacteria. As a result, significant improvement of power density was reported. In another research, Raghavulu et al. [106] evaluated the effect of external strain addition on MFC performance. It was found that pure culture MFC with Shewanella haliotis organism could be characterized by higher electron discharge capability in comparison with the mixed consortial application. When testing this particular microbe in bioaugmentation concept, a significant enhancement of the MFC efficiency was noted because of the synergetic interactions of S. haliotis and the native anodic biofilm layer. More lately, Raghavulu et al. [107] studied fed-batch MFCs seeded with anaerobic consortium, which were consecutively augmented using electrochemically potent microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on FISH analysis, it has turned out that the P. aeruginosa was able to withstand in high numbers for multiple cycles and because of its positive functional role, it could contribute to better substrate utilization and stable, increased bio-electrochemical activity as compared to the non-augmented case. These achievements demonstrate well the reality of microbial augmentation both in single- and dual-stage biosystems, producing hydrogen or hydrogen plus methane/bioelectricity, respectively."
4,Concluding remarks,"Hydrogen is a promising biofuel candidate for sustainable development, however, further advancements are essential to make it competitive with conventional energy carriers. For this purpose, many engineering approaches have been applied recently among which bioaugmentation shows remarkable potential, as demonstrated via the review of literatures herewith. This innovative strategy was successfully adopted to facilitate bioreactor start-up, to increase process stability, to recover gas formation performance after technological disturbances and to efficiently valorize particular waste materials – such as food waste, lignocellulosic waste and wastewater – in some cases even under continuous operation. Moreover, the bioaugmentation can be proposed for multi-step hydrogen fermentation, i.e. for complementary biomethane or bioelectricity generation, as demonstrated already. Regardless of the process, the isolation, careful selection (and optional genetic manipulation) as well as appropriate employment of the microorganisms are the key factors of bioaugmented hydrogen production. In other words, bioaugmentation is an emerging option and can significantly enhance the attractiveness of dark fermentative hydrogen generation – under adequate and optimized conditions ( Fig. 4) – by taking into account several biotic and abiotic parameters. With respect to biotic factors, the size of inoculum and the age of the augmenting culture could be identified with primary importance since they will surely determine the activity of the selected microorganism and the extent of bioaugmentation effect. Furthermore, abiotic (environmental or fermentation) conditions (Fig. 3), in agreement with the statements made above, will influence the viability of the particular strain(s) as well as the time-stability and duration of bioaugmentation. As compared to other intensification possibilities, the advantage of eco-friendly bioaugmentation from a technical point of view may be the relative ease of application as well as the low and therefore affordable investment cost. This latter point is attributable to the fact that it does not really demand sophisticated and expensive instrumentation, which presents flexibility and potency for scale-up. By careful design and suitable operation, the most particular expenditures consist more or less of strain collection (e.g. purchase from culture collections/depositories or companies), storage and maintenance. To avoid short supply of the augmenting microorganism in cases when it cannot be preserved in the fermenter system for a prolonged time – e.g. due to process disturbances, unforeseen technical difficulties that might occasionally cause the failure of the bioreactor [108] – a cost-effective and active culture ought to be ready to be added in appropriate intervals or to be fed continuously as a part of re-inoculation strategy [109]. A practical approach to compute the augmenting culture volume initially required (Eq. (1)) should consider the (i) bioreactor working volume, (ii) the (viable) cell concentration of the inoculum and the (iii) target (viable) concentration of the augmenting organism in the bioreactor: (1) V bio = ( V R + V bio ) C R C bio - 1 where V bio is the augmenting inoculum size (L), V R is the bioreactor working volume before the augmentation (L), C R is the desired (viable) cell concentration in the bioreactor after the injection of the augmenting culture (cell L−1), while C bio is the (viable) cell concentration of the augmenting inoculum (cell L−1). Such calculation based on active cell count may be more reliable and precise for firm conclusions than the inoculation rate (expressed e.g. as V bio V R −1), which is often used to describe the inoculum size in various literature studies. The possible drawback of the inoculation rate method does not exactly says “how many the living microbes are” so that the results might be less reproducible and accurate. Keeping in mind the biocatalyst loading from the beginning of the process design and applying a curiosity-driven “wait-and-see” approach (when certain strain(s) are employed in well-defined numbers and the outcome is observed with time), the bioaugmentation strategy can systematically be optimized in terms of the biotic factors. Overall, in the light of the literature findings and conclusions made, bioaugmentation seems to be a good deal and should find wider application in the near time horizon to progress the trends. The authors hope that this paper will be helpful for upcoming projects and hence it can facilitate the establishment of technologically and economically viable biomethods to make the hydrogen based society more realistic in the future."
