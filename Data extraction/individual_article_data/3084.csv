0,Introduction,"Highly fluorinated compounds are important substances, both from an industrial and fundamental point of view. Fluorinated surfactants, for example, are widely used as solvents, reaction promoters, refrigerants, pharmaceutical reactants and others [1–3]. Exciting applications for these compounds can be found in the biomedical field, where they have been successfully tested as blood substitutes, oxygen carriers, drug deliverers and bioactive materials [4,5]. Fluorinated alcohols, which can be viewed as the simplest amphiphiles, find application in numerous commercial products from textile protection agents and fire-fighting foams, to detergents, paints, and as precursors in the production of fluorinated polymers. Perfluorinated chains, although structurally quite similar to hydrogenated chains, differ from the later in a number of features, which are important to understand the thermophysical properties of fluorinated substances. Perfluorinated chains display a wider cross-section (0.283 nm2 compared to 0.185 nm2) [6], higher densities and molar volumes than hydrogenated chains with the same number of carbon atoms [7]. Another important difference between perfluorinated and hydrogenated chains is conformational. For perfluorinated chains, the dihedral angle at minimum energy is not 180° as it is for hydrogenated. Consequently, perfluorinated chains display a characteristic helical conformation, in contrast with the hydrogenated which tend to be in their all-trans planar form. The energy barrier to internal rotation is also much higher than that of hydrogenated chains. Perfluorinated chains are thus very rigid, in contrast with the flexible character of hydrogenated chains [8]. In terms of intermolecular interactions, given the high electronegativity of fluorine, perfluorinated chains are less polarizable and thus display weaker dispersion forces and cohesive energies. All these features have well known consequences for macroscopic thermophysical properties. Perfluorinated substances display smaller liquid ranges than their hydrogenated analogues, are more volatile and have larger viscosities [9–11]. They are also known to display very low surface tensions [12] and to be more hydrophobic than their hydrogenated analogues. Perfluorinated amphiphiles are thus very efficient surfactants. 1H,1H-perfluoroalcohols are linear highly fluorinated molecules with the general formula CF3(CF2)nCH2OH (from now on referred as n + 1:1 FTOH). The presence of the perfluorinated segment induces a strong dipole at the hydroxyl end of the molecule and increases the acidity of the OH group relatively to common hydrogenated alcohols [13]. Thus, n + 1:1 FTOH are expected to display an enhanced amphiphilic character compared to hydrogenated alcohols. However, despite its technological relevance, the interfacial properties of this family of compounds has been very poorly studied and, to the best of our knowledge, only surface tension data for 1:1 FTOH has been reported in the literature [14,15]. This work is part of an on-going project in which experimental measurements, molecular simulation techniques and theoretical calculations are strategically combined to model and interpret the properties of pure n + 1:1 FTOH and their mixtures with hydrogenated alcohols, water and CO2. We have recently reported vapor pressures, liquid densities and vaporization enthalpies for a number of pure n + 1:1 FTOH [16]. Their diffusion coefficients in water [17,18], also recently reported, are an important contribution toward designing remediation strategies to remove fluorinated pollutants from the environment. Mixtures of fluorinated and hydrogenated alcohols have also been studied [19,20]. These mixtures display a very complex behavior when compared with mixtures of hydrogenated alcohols and with mixtures of alkanes and perfluoroalkanes: the excess volumes are large and positive (unlike those of mixtures of hydrogenated alcohols [21]), while the excess enthalpies are large and negative (contrasting with those of mixtures of alkanes and perfluoroalkanes [22–24]). This peculiar behavior results from a balance between the weak dispersion forces between the hydrogenated and fluorinated chains and preferential hydrogen bonds between the hydrogenated and the fluorinated alcohols. The development of theoretical and computational models, which are able to provide accurate predictions for the thermophysical properties of pure substances and mixtures, is still a major challenge for contemporary physics. Their importance is apparent both from the technological and fundamental point of view. The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is a molecular-based equation-of-state (EoS) currently recognized as one of the most powerful theoretical approaches able to capture the relations between molecular structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties. In particular, highly directional attractive forces such as hydrogen bonding, which can play a key role in the properties of fluids and phase equilibrium, can be explicitly accounted for as specific interactions between association sites placed in the molecular models. Furthermore, the spectrum of properties that can be modeled with SAFT-type EoS can be easily extended by coupling it with other theoretical approaches. For example, SAFT-type models can be extended to the calculation of interfacial properties by coupling with either Density Gradient Theory (DGT) [25–29] or Density Functional Theory (DFT) (see, for instance, references [30–33] and references therein). In this work, new experimental data for the surface tension of six liquid n + 1:1 FTOH, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as a function of temperature are reported, filling an important gap in the available literature. The results are compared with data from the literature for the equivalent hydrogenated alcohols. The soft-SAFT-DGT equation is used to model the experimental results. In addition to surface tensions, a full characterization of the phase equilibria and bulk properties is performed with soft-SAFT, including second order derivative properties such as vaporization enthalpy, isothermal compressibility and thermal expansion coefficient. Excellent agreement was found between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. Finally, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed providing detailed structural information on the interfaces at the molecular level."
1,Methodology,
2,Experimental,"2.1 Experimental 2.1.1 Purification and characterization 1H,1H-perfluoroethan-1-ol (1:1 FTOH, CAS number:75-89-8), 1H,1H-perfluoropropan-1-ol (2:1 FTOH, CAS number:422-05-9), 1H,1H-perfluorobutan-1-ol (3:1 FTOH, CAS number:375-01-9), 1H,1H-perfluoropentan-1-ol (4:1 FTOH, CAS number:355-28-2), 1H,1H-perfluorohexan-1-ol (5:1 FTOH, CAS number:423-46-1) and 1H,1H-perfluoroheptan-1-ol (6:1 FTOH, CAS number:375-82-6) were purchased from Apollo Scientific Ltd.; a 98% purity was indicated for all the alcohols except for 1:1 FTOH, for which the purity was 99%, and for 4:1 FTOH and 6:1 FTOH, for which a 97% purity was claimed. Prior to its use, 1:1 FTOH was purified following the procedure described by Armarego and Perrin [34] and distilled; the final measured water content was below 600 ppm. The remaining compounds were dried with VWR Prolabo 4 Å molecular sieves to a maximum water content of 500 ppm (analysed by Karl-Fischer coulometry) and their purity was confirmed by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy. 2.1.2 Surface tension measurements Surface tensions were determined using the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) method, developed by Neumann and coworkers [35]. An aluminium chamber with optical windows was thermostatized by a circulating bath connected in closed circuit through one of the aluminium walls, and used to control the temperature of the pendant drops. The temperature was measured using a calibrated platinum resistance thermometer mounted in close contact with the drop holder [36]; temperature stability during the measurements was found to be better than 0.1 K. Due to the hygroscopicity of the studied alcohols, the aluminium cell was put under a low flux of dry nitrogen gas to reduce the effect of water absorption into the pendant drop, and the surface tension was verified to be constant as a function of time for each drop. The densities of all the liquids, required for the calculation of the surface tension from the drop profiles, were taken from our previous study [16] or determined for this work in the case of 6:1 FTOH. Further details on the operation, calibration and validation of the used experimental setup can be found in reference [12]. 2.1.3 Density measurements The liquid densities of the 1H,1H-perfluoroalcohols were measured in an Anton Paar DMA 5000 vibrating-tube densimeter. The instrument was calibrated with water (distilled, purified with a Mili-Q 185 plus water purification system, and freshly boiled) and air at 293 K, taking into account atmospheric pressure. The calibration was checked with water over the whole range of operating temperatures, and the maximum deviation from literature values [37] was found to be <0.00002 g.cm−3. The density of air was verified at the beginning of each series of measurements to ensure the cleanliness of the measurement cell."
3,Molecular simulations,"2.2 Molecular simulations Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to obtain molecular-level information on the behavior of the studied systems, using an all atom force field based on OPLS-AA [38]. For the perfluoroalkyl segments of the molecules, the OPLS-AA parameters from Watkins and Jorgensen [39] were used, while the -CF2CH2OH segment was modeled with the parameters developed by Duffy for 1:1 FTOH [40,41], adjusting the partial charge of the fluorinated carbon to maintain the neutrality of the molecule. The missing dihedral torsion parameters, for the fluorinated-hydrogenated junction, were taken from the work of Pádua [42]. Between 2000 and 3000 molecules were randomly inserted in a rectangular parallelepiped simulation box with periodic boundary conditions in every direction, elongated along the zz axis and with a square section in the xy plane (L x = L y < L z). The total volume of each simulation box was chosen such that during the equilibration period most of the molecules coalesced into a film of liquid, and a vapor region remained. The system thus had two explicit liquid-vapor interfaces perpendicular to the zz axis, and its typical dimensions were between 6 and 7 nm in the x and y directions and 30 nm in the z direction, with the liquid film occupying about half of the total height. The simulations were performed using the Gromacs 5.0.7 software [43], in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was kept constant using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat, with a relaxation constant of 0.5 ps. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium lengths using the LINCS algorithm, effectively removing the fastest vibration motion in the system, and a 2 fs timestep was used for the integration of the equations of motion. The conservation of the total energy of the system was checked throughout the simulations. At least 2 ns of simulation time were considered as equilibration time, with a further 20 ns used for property averaging. A cut-off of 14 Å was applied to both the dispersive and electrostatic potentials, and the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to account for all interactions beyond the cut-off distance. This approach allows the correct description of the full potentials, without the need for long-range corrections of energy, pressure and surface tension [44]. The liquid densities were obtained from the zz axis density profiles, by averaging the density of the liquid region away from the interfaces. The surface tensions were calculated by the mechanical approximation of Kirkwood and Buff [45], using the averaged diagonal components of the pressure tensor matrix [46]: (1) γ = L z 2 p zz − p xx + p yy 2 where γ is the surface tension, L z the simulation box length in the z direction and 〈p ii>〉 the average of the pressure component in the ii direction (x, y or z). The simulation uncertainties were obtained by dividing the production run in five equal blocks and calculating the standard deviation of the block averages."
4,Soft-SAFT modeling,"2.3 Soft-SAFT modeling 2.3.1 The soft-SAFT equation The Statistical Association Fluid Theory (SAFT) is one of the most successful molecular-based equations of state used nowadays for highly non-ideal systems such as those containing chain or associating molecules. SAFT is usually written in terms of the residual Helmholtz free energy, A res , where different terms are added to take into account the structure of the molecules integrating the fluid [47,48]. For a system of associating chains, the residual Helmholtz free energy can be described by: (2) A res = A total − A ideal = A ref + A chain + A assoc where A ref , A chain and A assoc stand for the monomer (or segment) reference fluid, the formation of the chain and the association contribution, respectively. In soft-SAFT a fluid of Lennard-Jones (LJ) spheres comprises the reference fluid, taking into account the repulsive and attractive interactions between the monomers [49]. The accurate LJ EoS of Johnson et al. [50] is used to calculate the free energy of the reference term and the derived properties. The chain term, A chain , originates from the first-order Wertheim's perturbation theory for associating spherical molecules, in the limit of full association [51–53]. For a mixture of chain molecules of length m i it reads: (3) A chain = k B T ∑ i x i 1 − m i ln g ii LJ σ ii where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, x i is the molar fraction, m i is the chain length and g ii LJ (σ ii ) is the pair radial distribution function of a Lennard-Jones fluid i. The association contribution is also derived from Wertheim's TPT1 [51–53]. As this term depends on the number of associative sites, their cumulative contribution is taken into account as described in Eq. (4): (4) A assoc = k B T ∑ i x i ∑ a ln X i a − X i a 2 + M i 2 where M i stands for the number of association sites and X i a the fraction of non-bonded sites of a molecule i. Further details on these terms can be found in previous works [49]. With this approach, five molecular parameters are needed to fully described a fluid of associating chains with soft-SAFT: the chain length, m, the size of the segments making the chains, σ, the dispersive energy of interaction between segments, ε, and ε HB and κ HB related to the energy and volume of association, respectively. The chain and association term in soft-SAFT are directly applicable to mixtures. The corresponding reference LJ term is extended to mixtures by applying the van der Waals one-fluid theory (vdW-1f) through the generalized Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) mixing rules: (5) σ ij = η ij σ ii + σ jj 2 (6) ε ij = ξ ij ε ii ε jj where η ij and ξii are binary adjustable parameters between substances i and j. When these parameters are set equal to 1, the EoS is used in a predictive manner. The volume and energy association parameters characterizing the interactions between different association sites are calculated by mixing rules in an analogous manner to that followed for σij and εij : (7) κ ij HB = κ ii HB 1 3 + κ jj HB 1 3 2 3 (8) ε ij HB = α ij HB ε ii HB ε jj HB where α ij HB is a binary adjustable parameter which can be used to correct for possible deviations from the geometric mean of the cross-association energy. Second order derivative properties such as the isothermal compressibility, the thermal expansion coefficient, the isochoric specific heat and the isobaric specific heat, k T , α p , C V and C P , respectively, are calculated analytically from the soft-SAFT equation by the direct derivation of the Helmholtz free energy and the pressure [54]. The vaporization enthalpy (∆H vap ) is obtained by calculating the difference between the enthalpies of gaseous and liquid saturated phases. Interfacial tensions and density profiles can be calculated by combining the Density Gradient Theory (DGT) with soft-SAFT [55]: (9) A = ∫ a 0 ρ + ∑ i ∑ j 1 2 c ij ∇ ρ i ∇ ρ j d 3 r where a 0(ρ) is the Helmholtz energy of the homogeneous fluid at density ρ, ∇ρ i and ∇ρ j are the local density gradient of compounds i and j and c ij is a coefficient, called of the influence parameter. This coefficient is related to the square-gradient term [27,56,57] and it is usually fitted to surface tension data. The interfacial tension (γ) is obtained by minimizing the free energy. The reader is referred to the original papers for further details [58]. 2.3.2 Molecular model and parameterization strategy In this work the molecules of the n + 1:1 FTOH were modeled as m spherical homonuclear segments of diameter σ, tangentially bonded to form a chain, interacting according to the dispersive energy ε/kB . It is important to note that in all fluorinated alcohols studied, the first group connected to the hydroxyl group is a CH2 not a CF2 group, as fully fluorinated alcohols are not chemically stable. The presence of the CH2 groups was integrated in the model implicitly through parameter estimation. The hydroxyl group is mimicked by the association term of the model. Following previous work [59], a model was chosen in which each fluorinated alcohol has 2 different associative sites, one positive, standing for the hydrogen of the functional group and one negative, representing the two lone electron pairs of the OH group. Despite the existence of 2 lone pairs of electrons it was assumed to model them with a single associative negative site, given the size and the stereochemistry of the molecules. The association scheme is presented in Fig. 1 . Hence, five molecular parameters are needed to fully describe a fluorinated alcohol with soft-SAFT: m, σ, ε, εHB and κHB . As any numerical model, soft-SAFT can converge to multiple minimums of the objective function, making necessary to set not only an objective function but also boundaries and take assumptions for the model, based on physical basis. Following previous works (see, for instance reference [60] and references therein), in addition to obtaining the mathematical solution, we also focused our attention on the physical meaning of the parameters and their tendencies, as compared to similar chemical families. Bearing in mind that for longer chains the association is weakly affected by the chain length, the association parameter values (ε HB and κ HB ) of hydrogenated alcohols [25] were transferred to the fluorinated alcohols studied in this work (see Table 1 ) except for the first member of the series, 1:1 FTOH. Having fixed the two association parameters (ε HB and κ HB ), only the three dispersive parameters remain to be determined; m, σ and ε. As usual, these were obtained through reduction of VLE data, using experimental results from our previous work [16]. However, to warrant a sound physical meaning of the parameters and the overall consistency of the approach, additional information from previously studied systems should be taken into account. For this purpose, we focused on previous soft-SAFT calculations of related families: n-alkanes [61], hydrogenated alcohols [25] and perfluorinated alkanes [62]. The comparison between alkanes and perfluoroalkanes shows the impact of fluorinated chains in the dispersive parameters. In addition, the comparison between alkanes and hydrogenated alcohols shows how the hydroxyl functional group affects the parameters. A detailed comparison of the soft-SAFT molecular parameters for the first members of the three chemical families, alkanes, hydrogenated alcohols and perfluorinated alkanes is presented in Fig. S1 of the Supplementary information. It can be observed that, in spite of the coarse-grain nature of this model, the parameters follow the expected physical trends within the families. For instance, the parameter related to chain length can transferred from the alkanes to perfluoroalkanes and alcohol chains [25] with the same number of carbon atoms. Regarding the size parameter σ, given the larger volume of fluorine compared to hydrogen, σ should be larger for fluorinated chains of similar length as observed in Fig. S1. As previously explained, the group connected to the hydroxyl group is a CH2 not a CF2 group. In the case of the shortest molecule in this study, TFE, the proportion between hydrogenated and fluorinated carbons is thus 1:1. This not only affects the size parameter (σ), but also the energy parameter (ε). In previous works, it was established that, the dispersive energy decreases among families following the order: hydrogenated alcohols, alkanes and perfluoroalkanes [25]. Therefore, the σ parameter for n + 1:1 FTOH should lie between hydrogenated alcohols and perfluoroalkanes and the dispersive energy parameter, ε, should be between perfluoroalkanes and the corresponding hydrogenated alcohols, as observed in Fig. S1. The complete set of new molecular parameters for the n + 1:1 FTOH is presented in Table 1. The soft-SAFT predictions for vapor pressure and saturated density for all the studied alcohols are shown in Supplementary Information."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Liquid densities,"3.1 Liquid densities The experimental liquid density and vapor pressure for n + 1:1 FTOH n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 have been reported in a previous paper [16]. In this work, the liquid density of 6:1 FTOH has been measured and the results in the 278 K - 353 K temperature range (at 5 K intervals) and at 0.1 MPa, are collected in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 2 . The complete table of densities can be found in the Supplementary Information. A third-degree polynomial equation was fitted to the experimental densities in the measured temperature range: (10) ρ g . cm − 3 = a 3 T / 100 3 + a 2 T / 100 2 + a 1 T / 100 + a 0 The obtained fitting constants are: a 0 = 2.26749, a 1 = 2.18720 × 10−1, a 2 = 3.15672 × 10-−2, a 3 = 6.04780 × 10−3. The average thermal expansion coefficient was calculated from the temperature dependence of the experimental liquid density leading to αP = 1.1 × 10−3 K−1 at 298.15 K. The liquid densities of all n + 1:1 FTOH are also plotted in Fig. 2, along with the results from the MD simulations and the soft-SAFT EoS calculations. As can be seen, the simulations deviate <1.5% from the experimental results, which is well within the deviations obtained in the original OPLS-AA work [38]. Moreover, it was found that the densities of the liquid slabs simulated in this work for the calculation of the surface tension are the same as those obtained from our previous NpT simulations of the bulk liquids at 1 atm [16]. These results validate the force field and simulation procedure used. A very good agreement between the soft-SAFT results and the experimental data is observed. The soft-SAFT predictions are in line with the experimental data for the whole range of temperatures. Molecular simulations are also in agreement with the experimental data and, consequently, with the soft-SAFT results."
7,Derivative properties of n + 1:1 FTOH,"3.2 Derivative properties of n + 1:1 FTOH Selected second order thermodynamic derivative properties were calculated with soft-SAFT and the results were compared with the available literature data in order to further assess the model and to complete the thermodynamic characterization of the selected systems. This includes the isothermal compressibility (k T ), thermal expansion coefficient (αP) and the vaporization enthalpy (∆H vap ). The molecular parameters used for these calculations were transferred from the parameterization with VLE properties and used in a predictive manner, which may lead to some deviations between soft-SAFT and experimental results. Better results can be obtained if at least one derivative property is fitted in addition to VLE [63], but the EoS will lose part of its predictive capability, hence we preferred to use it here as a predictive tool to check its ability in capturing the general trends and accuracy versus simulation and experimental data. Regarding the isothermal compressibility, experimental data could only be found for 1:1 FTOH, at different temperatures. Soft-SAFT predictions are presented in Fig. 3 together with experimental data and molecular simulation data. Very good agreement between experimental data and soft-SAFT predictions is obtained. The only molecular simulation value available agrees well with soft-SAFT but overestimates the experimental data. The soft-SAFT predictions for the thermal expansion coefficient of 1:1 FTOH are compared to experimental data [16,64] and to molecular simulation results [65] in Fig. 4a. As inferred from the figure, the soft-SAFT model is able to accurately predict the experimental behavior at 0.1 MPa. At higher pressures soft-SAFT deviates from the experimental data, although the trend is well captured. Fig. 4b depicts the thermal expansion coefficient for the fluorinated alcohols family as a function of chain length, at 0.1 MPa and 298.15 K. It can be seen that the soft-SAFT predictions underestimate the experimental values by around 10%, but are able to accurately reproduce the monotonic decrease of this property along the n + 1:1 FTOH family. The vaporization enthalpy is the most well studied derivative property for fluorinated alcohols. Soft-SAFT predictions for the vaporization enthalpy of the lighter members of the family as a function of temperature are compared to experimental and molecular simulations data, in Fig. 5(a). As can be seen, soft-SAFT reproduces the vaporization enthalpy of 2:1 FTOH but slightly underestimates that of 1:1 FTOH [66]. The vaporization enthalpy at constant temperature increases linearly with chain length as presented in Fig. 5(b) for ten fluorinated alcohols, at 298.15 K. Soft-SAFT reproduces this trend in very good agreement for the light members of the family and slightly underestimating the enthalpy of vaporization of the heavier members (average deviation of approximately 10%). The experimental values for 9:1 FTOH and 10:1 FTOH from Costa et al. [67] were estimated from melting and sublimation equilibrium parameters, leading to an evident deviation from the linear behavior."
8,Surface tension,"3.3 Surface tension The experimental surface tensions as a function of temperature of the studied n + 1:1 FTOH are reported in Table S1 (Supporting information) and plotted in Fig. 6(a). For comparison, the surface tensions of n-alkanols are also presented in Fig. 6(b). With the exception of 1:1 FTOH, the surface tensions of all studied n + 1:1 FTOH lie between 14 mNm−1 and 18 mNm−1, which are much lower than those of the corresponding hydrogenated n-alcohols (17 mNm−1 - 29 mNm−1). This result is not unexpected, as perfluoroalkanes are known to display much lower surface tensions than n-alkanes with similar chain length. The surface tension of 1:1 FTOH displays an anomalous behavior with respect to the rest of the family, intermediate between the n + 1:1 FTOH and the n-alkanols. It is rather frequent that the first members of chemical families display anomalous thermophysical properties relatively to the rest of the series (see, for instance reference [ 68 ]). This can be seen in Fig. 6(b) for methanol, which falls outside the trend of the longer n-alcohols, exhibiting surface tensions almost identical to those of ethanol. In the case of the 1H,1H-perfluoroalcohols, the first member of the series is 1:1 FTOH, as CF3OH is not chemically stable. The anomalous behavior of 1:1 FTOH is much more pronounced than in the case of methanol, displaying surface tensions higher than all other fluorinated alcohols by almost 3 mN m−1. Kim et al. [69] measured the surface tension of 1:1 FTOH within the same temperature range using the Wilhelmy plate technique. Their data is systematically higher than the one reported here by approximately 1mN.m−1, which is higher than the combined experimental uncertainties. The authors stated that they used 1:1 FTOH as received, without further purification; given the high hygroscopicity of this substance, it is very likely that such a discrepancy is due to the existence of water in their sample and not to experimental errors. Also striking from Fig. 6 is the fact that, within the studied temperature range and apart from 1:1 FTOH, all other fluorinated alcohols display very similar surface tension curves, showing a very small dependence on chain length at constant temperature. Indeed, the surface tensions of 3:1 FTOH are higher than those of 2:1 FTOH only by approximately 0.1 mN m−1, but almost indistinguishable from those of 4:1 FTOH. For the longer fluorinated alcohols, the differences in surface tension become relatively constant, of the order of 0.3 mNm−1. This behavior noticeably contrasts from that displayed by the n-alkanol series, in which case the surface tension gradually increases with chain length by regular increments in the range of 0.6–1.5 mN m−1. The experimental surface tension data as a function of temperature was fitted to Eq. 10, and the obtained thermodynamic parameters are presented in Table 3 . As the surface tension can be identified with the surface Gibbs energy, at constant temperature and pressure, the surface enthalpy H S and entropy S S can be determined from the temperature dependence of the surface tension, assuming that both quantities are constant within the temperature range considered: (11) γ = H S − T . S S (12) S S = − dγ dT Soft-SAFT coupled with DGT theory [58] was used to model the surface tension of the fluorinated alcohols family. The influence parameter was fitted for each substance at 308.15 K and the values presented in Table 1 were correlated by a second order polynomial of the molecular weight (Eq. (13)). (13) c J . m 5 . mol − 2 = 6.19 . 10 − 24 × M w 2 − 5.44 . 10 − 22 × M w + 8.93 . 10 − 20 As shown in Fig. 7 , the soft-SAFT+DGT results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data measured in this work, except for 1:1 FTOH at the lowest temperatures. As already mentioned, this molecule presents an anomalous behavior in most of its thermophysical properties when compared to the rest of the family. It is also observed in Fig. 7 that the experimental surface tension values for 2:1 FTOH, 3:1 FTOH and 4:1 FTOH are very close in the range of temperatures 280 K – 308 K. The surface tensions of 1:5 FTOH and 1:6 FTOH are slightly higher than those obtained for 1:2 FTOH, 1:3 FTOH and 1:4 FTOH. In addition to molecular-based theory, molecular dynamics simulations for all systems were performed in order to obtain molecular level information on the studied systems, in particular, evidences about the structure and organization of the vapor-liquid interface that are inaccessible experimentally or with soft-SAFT. Surface tensions were calculated from the MD simulations at 298.15 K and 323.15 K as a function of chain length of the alcohol, and are presented and compared to the experimental data and the soft-SAFT+DGT results in Fig. 8 . The agreement between the three methods is outstanding. As inferred from the figure, the simulation results are able to accurately capture the dependence of the surface tension on chain length, as well as the anomalous behavior of 1:1 FTOH, overestimating the experimental surface tensions by 1 to 2.5 mN m−1. This agreement can be considered remarkable, as the simulation model was not parameterized to reproduce this property; the simulation results are, thus, absolute predictions. Conversely, the soft-SAFT+DGT influence parameter was parameterized for 308.15 K, providing excellent agreement with the experimental data for both studied temperatures. An important advantage of using molecular-based modeling is that besides the macroscopic properties of the systems, additional information can be obtained about the behavior at the molecular scale. For example, density profiles showing how the molecules distribute along the interface between the two phases can be obtained both from soft-SAFT+DGT and molecular dynamics. Results for the systems investigated in this work are presented in Fig. 9 . Although the density profiles obtained by the theory and simulation do not exactly match at the interface, the overall agreement can be considered quite good. The density profiles obtained by soft-SAFT+DGT are more abrupt than those calculated using molecular dynamics, as expected, as molecular simulations have a greater level of detail on the distribution of the molecules, while DGT provides a gradient of the overall density. As mentioned, a clear advantage of using molecular simulations is that they allow a more detailed analysis of the structure and organization of the vapor-liquid interface of the different fluorinated alcohols. Fig. 10 depicts numerical density profiles of selected groups across the interfacial region as obtained from the MD simulations, where the profiles of the OH and CF3 atoms are shown for each alcohol. The profiles were translated in the figure to align the maxima of all OH groups at the origin of the z coordinate. In general, the profiles clearly show that in all cases molecules at the surface are preferentially oriented with their fluorinated chains in contact with the vapor forming a fluorinated outer layer. Additionally, all studied surfaces show a well-defined outermost OH peak, indicating an accumulation of hydrogen bonds at the surface, given the orientational constraints of the interface. The absolute value of this peak decreases from 1:1 FTOH to 2:1 FTOH and 3:1 FTOH, reaching an almost constant value for the longer alcohols. This reflects the balance between the total density of OH groups, which decreases with chain length, and a higher tendency of the longer alcohols to adopt a particular orientation at the surface. Conversely, the CF3 profiles gradually change for the whole range of compounds studied. In the case of 1:1 FTOH, the CF3 density monotonically decreases from the bulk liquid to the vapor phase, without any visible structuration. The longer compounds, 4:1 FTOH, 5:1 FTOH and 6:1 FTOH, have very structured CF3 profiles clearly displaying two maxima, one below the surface, in the region of the local minima of the OH profiles, 0.5 < z < 1.0, and the second in contact with the vapor phase (−1 < z < −0.5). This indicates the presence of an interdigitated - layered organization of the molecules, most certainly induced by the interface, easy to identify in the snapshot shown in Fig. 11 . As could be expected, 2:1 FTOH and 3:1 FTOH show an intermediate behavior with a first slight maxima below the surface but without a clear second peak toward the vapor region. The profiles also show that, starting from the very low vapor densities, the distance between the first CF3 and OH peaks gradually increases with the chain length, reflecting an increased tendency of surface organization. For the longer compounds, this distance is already consistent with fully perpendicular orientation of the majority of the alcohol molecules. These observations are consistent with the experimental surface tension results, corroborating the anomalous behavior of 1:1 FTOH, the behavior of intermediate compounds showing almost similar surface tension values and finally the gradual increase of surface tension shown for the longer alcohols."
9,Conclusions,"New experimental results are reported for the surface tension of a series of fluorinated alcohols, n + 1:1 FTOH, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, measured in the temperature range between 260 K and 350 K (as well as the liquid density of 6:1 FTOH) filling an important gap in the available literature. The results are compared with data from the literature for the equivalent hydrogenated alcohols to assess the influence of the molecular structure on the interfacial properties. The surface tension of 1:1 FTOH displays an anomalous behavior with respect to the rest of the series, intermediate between the n + 1:1 FTOH and the n-alkanols. Also, contrary to the case of the n-alkanol series, in which case the surface tension at constant temperature gradually increases with chain length by regular increments in the range of 0.6–1.5 mNm−1, fluorinated alcohols exhibit very similar surface tension curves, almost independent of the chain length. For instance, the surface tensions of 3:1 FTOH are higher than those of 2:1 FTOH by approximately 0.1 mNm−1 and almost indistinguishable from those of 4:1 FTOH, while for longer fluorinated alcohols, the increments in surface tension become of the order of 0.3 mN m−1. A complete characterization of these systems was performed using the molecular-based EoS soft-SAFT and molecular dynamics simulations. The n + 1:1 FTOH family was modeled using soft-SAFT for the first time, from 1:1 FTOH to 6:1 FTOH. The proposed molecular parameter values are consistent with other related families' parameters (alkanes, alcohols and perfluoroalkanes), providing a good description of VLE curves. These parameters were then used in a predictive manner to calculate second order thermodynamic derivative properties for these systems. The model and parameters were able to capture the behavior of these properties at different conditions, predicting quantitative agreement with experimental results in some cases. In addition, soft-SAFT combined with DGT provided excellent agreement with the experimental surface tensions. The surface tension and interfacial properties study was complemented with new molecular dynamics simulations using an atomistic force field based on OPLS-AA. Excellent predictions for the surface tensions of the selected systems were attained as compared to experimental data. Further analysis of the simulation results through the calculation of density profiles show that in all cases molecules are preferentially oriented at the surface with the fluorinated chains in contact with the vapor, forming a fluorinated outer layer. The CF3 profiles gradually change with the chain length. The density of CF3 in 1:1 FTOH monotonically decreases from the bulk liquid to the vapor phase, while for the longer compounds clearly structured CF3 profiles reveal the specific molecular orientation of the alcohols, forming an interdigitated-layered organization at the interface. The molecular dynamics results thus provide additional insights into the surface tension results, corroborating the 1:1 FTOH anomalous behavior and the trend displayed by the other members of the family."
