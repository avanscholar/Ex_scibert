0,Introduction,"In recent years, the transformation of biomass and its derivatives to liquid fuels and chemicals via biorefinery and biomass upgrading technologies is of great interests [1–3]. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is a dehydration product of hexoses, can be considered as a bio-renewable platform chemicals [4,5]. The reductive upgrading of HMF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is a key reaction to produce liquid fuels and chemicals in the future [6]. As potential biofuel, DMF has beneficial physical and chemical properties, such as higher octane number (RON=119) and boiling point (92–94°C) than ethanol (RON=110, B.P.=78°C, respectively) [7]. Additionally, compared with ethanol, it is easier to blend with gasoline and more difficult to dissolve in water [8]. To further investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of DMF in internal combustion engines, the experiments of pure DMF, DMF/gasoline mixtures, DMF/diesel blends have been investigated, respectively [9–11]. All the results indicate that DMF has the potential to become an effective gasoline alternative. Recent efforts paid towards selective conversion of HMF to DMF in the presence of molecular hydrogen involve various catalyst, such as Cu:Ru/C [6], Pd/C [12], Pd-Zn/C [8], and Ru/Co3O4 [13]. In 2007, Dumesic et al. [6] firstly developed an efficient route to produce DMF (yield of 71%) from fructose over Cu-Ru/C catalyst. In 2010, Chidambaram and Bell [12] reported a two-step approach in ionic liquids to produce DMF, firstly a nearly 100% yield of HMF was obtained from glucose by using 12-molybdophosphoric acid as catalyst, then 47% of HMF was converted to DMF with a 32% selectivity over Pd/C catalyst. However, the poor solubility of H2 in ionic liquids resulted in a high pressures of H2 (62bar) and the separation of DMF from solvents was also a problem. Saha et al. [8] developed a bimetallic catalyst containing Zn and Pd/C components for the conversion of HMF to DMF with high conversion (99%) and selectivity (85%), however, a deactivation of the catalyst was observed after the 4th cycle. Recently, Zu et al. [13] reported that Ru/Co3O4 catalyst was excellent for the conversion of HMF to DMF with high DMF yield (93.4%) and good reusability. Although molecular hydrogen has many advantages like wide availability and easy activation on many metal surfaces, the employment of hydrogen gas presents a number of challenges including transport, process economy and sustainability. Moreover, the low solubility of molecular hydrogen in most solvents results in high H2 pressure that leads to a considerable safety hazard [14]. Therefore, liquid-phase hydrogen donors such as formic acid (FA) and alcohols have gained increased attention recently. Formic acid can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass [15] or from electrochemical reduction of CO2 [16], which makes it an environmental friendly and renewable source for hydrogen production and hydrogen donor for catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reactions. Thananatthanachon and Rauchfuss [17] reported the activity of Pd/C, FA and H2SO4 in the conversion of HMF to DMF through CTH process. In this process, FA serves as an acid catalyst, a hydrogen source and a reagent for the deoxygenation of furanylmethanols. De et al. [18] reported a one pot conversion of lignocellulosic and algal biomass to DMF with Ru/C and H2SO4 as catalysts and FA as hydrogen source, which gave a maximum DMF yield of 32%. However, addition of H2SO4 in the above two reports poses the challenge for the material and catalysts durability. Sawadjoon et al. [19] demonstrated the Pd-catalyzed transfer hydrogenolysis of phenylethanol using FA as hydrogen donor at 80°C and indicated that the hydride transfer from FA to Pd was a rate-determining step. Tuteja et al. [20] reported a direct synthesis process of 1,6-hexanediol from HMF over a Pd/ZrP catalyst using FA as hydrogen source, which gave a yield of 43% without using high-pressure H2 gas. Additionally, utilization of alcohols as hydrogen donors has also been investigated with various catalysts and substrates. The transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural and HMF to 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) was studied over Fe2O3-supported Cu, Ni, and Pd catalysts, with 2-propanol as hydrogen donor by Scholz et al. [21]. However, the formations of ring-hydrogenation and decarbonylation products were observed at the beginning of the reaction. Jae et al. [22] investigated the CTH process of HMF using several secondary alcohols as hydrogen donors over a Ru/C catalyst. However, the catalyst showed considerable deactivation even after the first run. From the above results, the catalysts system mainly based on Pd, Ru or other noble metals, while only a few non-noble metal based catalysts have been reported [23]. Based on these promising results through CTH process, the development of inexpensive but highly effective catalysts without noble metal loading is still desired. Therefore, in this work, we apply the catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis process for the reductive upgrading of HMF using a non-noble Ni-Co/C catalyst with formic acid as hydrogen source."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of catalysts,"2.1 Preparation of catalysts The Ni-Co/C catalysts were prepared by a typical wetness impregnation method. Typically, 1.976g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd.) and 0.198g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in 50mL deionized water under stirring. Then 2g of activated carbon (Aladdin Reagent Limited Company, 40 mesh∼60 mesh) was dispersed in the solution. After stirring for 12h at room temperature, the solution was dried overnight at 180°C and was reduced at 400°C for 2h with flowing H2 in tube furnace with a ramp of 3°Cmin−1 before used as catalysts."
3,Characterizations of the catalyst,"2.2 Characterizations of the catalyst X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded with a Bruker diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°. The nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M sorption analyzer. Before analyzing, the samples were outgassed at 200°C for 8h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Tecnai F20s-TWIN instrument. The electron beam accelerating voltage was 200kV. The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment was carried out in a gas mixture of 5vol.% hydrogen in nitrogen at a flow rate of 40cm3 min−1 and a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 from 25 to 700°C, and H2 uptake was measured using a TCD detector. The content of Ni and Co in the samples was performed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) instrument (Agilent 725ES)."
4,Catalytic activity tests,"2.3 Catalytic activity tests A stainless steel autoclave (50mL) equipped with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with catalyst (0.200g), HMF (0.252g), formic acid (0.920g), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 10mL) and tridecane (0.245mL, internal standard). The reactor was pressurized with N2 several times to remove air and heated to the desired temperature. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature quickly and the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration. The products in the filtrate were analyzed by an Agilent7890 GC equipped with a HP-5 column and a FID detector, and the further structural characteristics of the products were identified by GC-MS. The DMF yield was calculated as follows: Yield ( % ) = moles of DMF moles of HMF × 100 %"
5,Results and discussion,
6,Characterizations of the catalyst,"3.1 Characterizations of the catalyst The XRD pattern of unreduced 2%Ni-20%Co/C gives diffraction peaks at 2θ=24.5°, 42.5°, 37.0° and 44.5°, which can be assigned to the phase of active carbon, CoO and Co3O4, respectively, as labeled in Fig. 1 . No diffraction peaks of NiO are observed, indicating that NiO is highly dispersed on carbon. After reduction at 400°C for 2h, the peaks corresponding to Co3O4 phase disappear, and instead, the diffraction peaks of CoO and Co0 are observed, as labeled in Fig. 1. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst is presented in Fig. 2 . The sample shows a typical type-IV curve with a sharp uptake at the low relative pressure of P/P0 <0.02 and a hysteresis loop at the high relative pressure of about 0.7 to 0.9, indicating the co-existence of micropores and mesopores. It can be seen that the active carbon and 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst have high BET surface area of 689 and 357m2 g−1, respectively. The actual metal loading of Co and Ni are 15.0% and 1.4%, respectively, which are lower than the nominal ones from the results of ICP-AES (see Table 1 ). TEM, EDS and element mapping analysis were employed to investigate the Ni and Co distribution on the active carbon. As shown in Fig. 3 , firstly the EDS analysis result shows that the 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst contains elements of Co, O, Ni and carbon. From the corresponding elemental mapping analysis, it confirms that Ni and Co were uniformly dispersed on the active carbon support. Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR curves of 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst. It can be seen that the 2%Ni-20%Co/C has three H2 consumption peaks. The first peak at 200–250°C can be assigned to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, and the second peak at about 350°C is due to the reduction of CoO to Co0 [24]. The reduction of Ni2+ species to Ni0 exhibit a reduction peak at 300–350°C, so it is overlapped with the reduction peak of CoO to Co0. And a shoulder peak at 400–500°C which are also ascribed to the reduction of Ni2+ [25]."
7,CTH of HMF over different hydrogen donors and catalysts,"3.2 CTH of HMF over different hydrogen donors and catalysts Initial experiments were focused on the performance of different hydrogen donors in the CTH of HMF over a non-noble 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst. Table 2 summarizes the results for the hydrogenolysis of HMF using 2-propanol and formic acid as hydrogen donors under different reaction temperatures. The main products include DMF, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF), 2-hydroxymethyl-5-methylfuran (HMMF) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF). When 2-propanol is used as hydrogen donor, a rather low HMF conversion is obtained at the reaction temperature of 190°C (Table 2, entry 1), the yield of the target product, DMF is only 9.3% with both deoxygenated (5-MF) an hydrogenated (BHMF) products. With the increase of reaction temperature to 210 and 230°C, the conversion of HMF reaches up to 64.1% and 70.0%, separately (Table 2, entry 2 and 3), while the yield of DMF and by-products are similar, DMF yield cannot increase further. The above results indicate a poor selectivity to DMF over 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst by using 2-propanol as hydrogen source. Although similar conversion of HMF and yield of DMF are obtained when using FA as hydrogen source at 190°C (Table 2, entry 4), a high yield of DMF (90.0%) reaches and the intermediates including 5-MF and HMMF disappear when reaction temperature rises to 210°C and 230°C, respectively (Table 2, entry 5 and 6). The main by-product was 2-MF with a yield of 5.8–6.0%. Compared with molecular hydrogen as hydrogen source, a lower yield of DMF (61.0%, Table 2, entry 7) is obtained at 210°C with 1.5MPa hydrogen pressure. The high pressure and high temperature results in different by-products, mainly the ring-hydrogenation and ring-open products, such as 2,5-dimethyl-tetrahydrofuran, 2-hexanone and other molecules. The above results indicate that FA is an excellent hydrogen donor for an efficient synthesis of DMF from HMF over the 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst. Furthermore, the influence of different contents of Co and Ni on catalytic activity was also investigated and the results were shown in Table 3 . 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst was proved to perform a high selectivity towards DMF (90.0%) with formic acid as hydrogen donor. Further increasing the Ni loading to 5% and 7% would decreases the yield of DMF to 75.4% and 41.5%, with the yield of 2,5-hexanediol increased to 8.5% and 20.2%, respectively. The other by-products mainly include 2-MF and some other ring-open moleculars. The above results indicate that high Ni content could lead to the ring-open and decarbonylation reactions due to the hydrogenation ability of Ni. The yield of DMF also decreases to 63.2% and 79.0% over 2%Ni-8%Co/C and 2%Ni-14%Co/C catalysts, respectively. The main by-products are 5-MF, increases to 24.3% and 12.2%, which indicate lower hydrogenation ability of the catalysts than 2%Ni-20%Co/C. So the 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst is a better choice in these CTH reactions."
8,Study of the reaction pathway,"3.3 Study of the reaction pathway To better understand the reaction pathway, a typical time profile for the CTH of HMF using FA as hydrogen donor is shown in Fig. 5 . The experimental system used in the time-evolution of the reaction consisted of different batches using the same reactor for the different reaction times. It can be seen that HMF is totally converted at the first 3h and the DMF yield reaches 58.6% with 20% 5-methylfurfural (5-MF). With the prolonging of reaction time, the yield of 5-MF decreases gradually, which hydrogenated to 2-hydroxymethyl-5-methylfuran (HMMF) and finally DMF, indicating 5-MF is a key intermediate. 2-methylfuran (2-MF) was also detected at the beginning of the reaction and reaches highest (6%) at the end of the reaction. The formation of 2-MF may come from the decarbonylation of 5-MF (5-methylfurfural), which was confirmed through experiments in the following part. After 24h, the yield of DMF reaches 90%. In this process, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) was not detected during the whole reaction, which is different from the previous reports using H2 as hydrogen resource, in the later, BHMF is the intermediate [26,27]. To further explore the key factors which influence the occurrence of intermediates, more experiments were carried out under conditions of 1.0MPa H2 to examine whether the temperature ranges or the addition of acid is responsible for the reaction pathway during the CTH process of HMF. Firstly, when the reaction temperature is 210°C and without addition of acid (Table 4 , entry 1), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) are both detected after 0.5h. At 130°C (Table 4, entry 2), we can also find the existence of both 5-MF and BHMF without acid, though the yield of 5-MF and BHMF are quite different from that at 210°C. The above results indicate that the reaction temperature has an effect on the amount of 5-MF and BHMF, but the hydrogenolysis of the alcohol group and the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group are independent on the reaction temperature. While, with the addition of various acids, including HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4 and FA, 5-MF is always existed, but BHMF cannot be detected (Table 4, entry 3–6) even the conversion of HMF and yield of DMF are different. The above comparison indicates that the presence of H+ prevents the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group and makes the hydrogenolysis of the alcohol group as a sole reaction route during the CTH of HMF. The formation of 2-MF in the CTH process has two pathways according to the reports of Vlachos’s group [22]. HMF could directly decarbonylate to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) then hydrogenated to 2-MF. Another way is the decarbonylation of 5-MF to 2-MF. With FA as hydrogen donor (Table 2, line 5 and 6), the FOL is not detected during the whole reaction process in Fig. 5, so 2-MF come from the decarbonylation of 5-MF. To certify this, we performed a control experiment by using 5-MF as a starting substrate. Under similar conditions to the experiments in Figs. 5 and 2-methylfurfural really formed from 5-MF decarbonylates to over Ni-Co/C catalyst in 6h (Table 5 ). This observation indicates that the decarbonylation reaction only happens from 5-MF. From the above results, the reaction pathway of the CTH of HMF over Ni-Co/C catalyst using FA as hydrogen donor is proposed in Scheme 1 . HMF is first deoxygenated into 5-MF instead of BHMF, then hydrogenated to HMMF during the reaction. After that, HMMF is quickly deoxygenated to DMF. Though we proposed the acid make influence on the reaction pathway for the CTH of HMF, further exploration on the reaction mechanism is needed."
9,Effect of formic acid amount,"3.4 Effect of formic acid amount Based on stoichiometry, 3mmol H2 are needed for the conversion of 1mmol HMF to DMF, which indicates that 3mmol formic acid (FA) are necessary. The experiments with different amount of FA were carried out and the results are presented in Fig. 6 . From the results, HMF (2mmol) are totally converted even with 2mmol of FA, but the yield of DMF (20%) is low, which indicates that the amount of FA is not sufficient. With the FA increase to 6mmol, the yield of DMF reaches 82%, which is similar to the results with higher amount of FA (10mmol and 14mmol). The highest yield of the desired product is obtained with 20mmol of FA (90.0% of DMF). Therefore, the yield of DMF displays no obvious differences when the amount of FA is triple of HMF."
10,Catalyst recyclability studies,"3.5 Catalyst recyclability studies The reusability of the 2%Ni-20%Co/C catalyst was also investigated. The catalyst was recycled by separation from the reaction system, washing with pure THF and dried in vacuum overnight and prepared for the next run. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the conversion of HMF maintained the same after 4 runs, while the yield of DMF decreased from 53.1% to 43.6% after the first run, then kept constant. At the same time, the yield of 5-MF increased from 9.4% to 24.2% and also kept constant after 1st run, this may be due to the leaching of active sites at the first time. The ICP analysis of the fresh and spent catalyst show that, after first run, the amount of Ni and Co decrease obviously from 1.4% and 15.0% to 0.91% and 11.8%, separately. However, after 4th run, the amounts of Ni and Co only decrease slightly, from 0.91% and 11.8% to 0.82% and 11.7%, separately (Table 6 ). Therefore, the loss of the metal content is responsible for the decrease of catalytic activity of the catalyst after the 1st run."
11,Catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural,"3.6 Catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural The hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural to 2-methylfuran has recently gained increased attention because of its good fuel performance [28,29]. The catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of furfural was also conducted in a batch reactor. The deoxygenation reaction of furfural proceeds via the intermediates FOL, which undergoes hydrogenolysis to 2-methylfuran [30,31]. The reaction pathway for the CTH process of furfural is presented in Scheme 2 . The results for hydrogenolysis of furfural using 2-propanol, formic acid and H2 as hydrogen donors are summarized in Table 7 . It can be seen that with 2-propanol as hydrogen donor, the conversion of furfural is only 51.0% at 190°C. The main product is furfuryl alcohol with trace amount of 2-methylfuran and methyl-tetrahydrofuran (THMF). Further increase the reaction temperature to 210°C, the conversion of HMF rises to 99.0%, but the yield of 2-methylfuran is still low, only 5.0%. When formic acid was used as hydrogen donor, the yield of 2-methylfuran reaches up to 79.2%, even much better than that when using H2 as hydrogen sources. Here, 2-propanol and formic acid also show different performance, as that for the CTH of HMF, which will be investigated further. All above results indicate that formic acid is an excellent hydrogen source for furfural and HMF hydrogenolysis to 2-methylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran over the Ni-Co/C catalyst, both products are excellent fuels."
12,Conclusions,"In conclusion, we have developed a catalytic transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis (CTH) process for the production of DMF from HMF by using formic acid as hydrogen source and the active carbon supported non-noble metal Ni and Co as the catalyst. A high yield of DMF (90.0%) is obtained without any ring-hydrogenation products detected. During the CTH process of HMF, hydrogenolysis product of the alcohol group, 5-methylfurfural, is the only intermediate, because of the influence of H+ from formic acid. Furthermore, a higher yield of 2-methylfuran from the CTH process of furfural is obtained, the yield is even higher than using molecular hydrogen as hydrogen donor. We believe that this work enables an efficient synthesis of the promising liquid fuel over non-noble metal catalysts with a renewable carrier of hydrogen, formic acids, as hydrogen source. Ongoing investigations will focus on the exploring of different hydrogen donors for the reductive upgrading of HMF and furfural."
