0,Introduction,"With an output of 4 million tons per year, functionalized anilines represent key intermediates for the production of dyes, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers and various other fine chemicals [1,2]. Traditionally, functionalized anilines are synthesized by non-catalytic reduction of their corresponding nitroarenes using stoichiometric reagents such as sodium hydrosulfite, iron, tin, or zinc [3]. However, this process has been prohibited due to serious environmental concerns. Among the environmentally benign approaches developed thus far, the catalytic hydrogenation by supported metal nanoparticles is the preferred one since H2 is a green and cost-effective reducing reagent and the only by-product is H2O. This methodology works well for simple nitroarenes, yet encounters problems for those with diverse reducible functional groups on the benzene ring because of the over-hydrogenation side-reactions, especially for nitrostyrenes where the –C=C group is much more sensitive than –NO2. Generally, most of the nano-catalysts exhibit poor chemoselectivity [4], and only when those catalysts are modified by organic molecules (e.g., Pt/TiO2-thiols [5]), or metal salts (such as Pt/C-H3PO2-VO(acac)2, Pt-Pb/CaCO3-FeCl2-n-Bu4NCl, Rh/C-Fe(OAc)2) [6,7], could high chemoselectivity be achieved. However, these modifications by soluble reagents bring about additional environmental problems associated with the production of waste water. Great efforts have been devoted to developing true heterogeneous and selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes [8,9]. Au nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 [10], as well as modified Pt, Ru and Ni nano-catalysts through strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) were reported to be highly selective for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene [11–17]. However, the catalytic activity was still not satisfactory enough due to either the low intrinsic capability of IB metals for activating H2 [18], or the decreased number of active sites for platinum-group metals resulting from the covering by the support or catalytically inert metals. To improve the catalytic efficiency, we previously developed FeO x -supported platinum single-atom and pseudo-single-atom as catalysts for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, and a TOF as high as 11064 h−1 was achieved [19], which was 20-fold higher than the nano-particulate counterpart (Pt/TiO2, the best catalyst reported before our Pt1/FeO x SACs) developed by Corma's group [12]. In addition, the selectivity to 3-vinylaniline reached as high as ~99%, far superior to the NPs counterpart. Recently, the catalytic activity of Pt1/FeO x was further enhanced by 2-fold through engineering the coordination environment of Pt single atoms while the chemoselectivity remained at 98% [20], demonstrating the unrivalled capability of SACs for chemoselective hydrogenations [21–23]. Based on these achievements, we became interested in developing non-precious metal SACs for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes given the high price and limited availability of noble metals. Previously, we reported that single-atom catalyst Co-N-C demonstrated good catalytic performance in the hydrogenative coupling of nitroarenes to produce azo compounds with the assistance of NaOH [24]. Compared with the Co-based nano-catalysts reported (e.g., Co3O4@N-C) [25], our Co-N-C SAC bear the merits of mild reaction conditions (e.g., reaction temperature 110 °C vs 80 °C). However, the addition of NaOH caused additional environmental concerns. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop noble-metal-free and additive-free single-atom catalytic system for the hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes. In fact, from the viewpoint of green chemistry, the use of organic solvents represents a critical concern in most of organic transformations. Solvents not only subtly affects the activity and selectivity of catalysts, but also accounts for the vast majority of chemical waste [26]. In the catalytic systems reported for hydrogenation of nitroarenes, toxic and flammable organic solvents (such as toluene, THF) have been widely employed, which will definitely not recommended by green chemistry. Therefore, it is highly desirable to substitute them with greener ones (such as ionic liquid, supercritical fluids, and water). In particular, supercritical CO2 (scCO2) offers prominent advantages such as nontoxicity, non-flammability, and facile regulation of phase behavior which improves the solubility of H2 and facilitates the separation of the products. Previously, Arai's group investigated the hydrogenation of nitrostyrene in CO2-expanded liquids with or without extra organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, toluene) [27,28]. However, the conversion (64%) and selectivity to vinylaniline (75%) were not satisfactory owing to the low-efficiency of Pt/TiO2 nano-catalysts. By contrast, we achieved high conversion and selectivity (both were higher than 95%) using Pt1/FeO x SAC for the reaction in CO2-expanded toluene [29], demonstrating the great power of single-atom catalyst in conjunction with green solvents. Even though, toluene was still indispensable to maintain high conversion level in that work. In the present work, we have reported the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene in compressed CO2 without any extra solvent over single-atom Co-N-C catalyst. An interesting inverted V-curve relation was found between the hydrogenation activity and the CO2 pressure. Under optimal reaction conditions (60 °C, 3 MPa H2 (RT), 5.0 MPa CO2), CO2/H2 gaseous phase and CO2-expanded 3-nitrostyrene liquid phase formed in the top and bottom of the reactor, respectively. The biphasic system not only greatly enhanced the solubility of hydrogen in the CO2-expanded substrate liquid phase, but also changed the reaction order from 0.5 to zero with respect to hydrogen. Consequently, the reaction rate was dramatically increased. Our work has demonstrated a green, efficient and cost-effective route to the synthesis of functionalized anilines by combining the compressed CO2 solvent with the noble-metal-free single-atom catalyst."
1,Experimental,
2,Preparation of Co-N-C,"2.1 Preparation of Co-N-C The catalyst was prepared according to the procedure we previously reported [24]. Briefly, Cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (0.5 mmol, 125 mg), 1,10-phenanthroline hydrate (1.5 mmol, 300 mg) and ethanol (50 mL) were added to a round bottom flask. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature, followed by addition of 4.0 g Mg(OH)2 and refluxing at 60 °C for 4 h. After ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation, the remaining solid was dried at 60 °C, and was subjected to pyrolysis at 700 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere (100 mL/min) with ramp rate of 2 °C/min. After Mg(OH)2 was removed by washing with HCl solution (200 mL, 1 mol/L) twice, the remaining black solid was dried at 80 °C, and was denoted as Co-N-C catalyst."
3,Phase behaviour study,"2.2 Phase behaviour study The phase behaviour at various pressures and temperatures was visually observed by using a 29.3 mL high-pressure cell equipped with two quartz windows. After a certain amount of liquid substrate (3-nitrostyrene or nitrobenzene) and a stirring bar were introduced, the cell was sealed and purged for several times with N2. Then, hydrogen gas was introduced in the cell until the pressure reached 3 MPa. After the cell was heated to 60 °C with a heating jacket, the liquid CO2 was pumped into the cell until the designated pressure was reached. The gas-liquid mixture in the cell was stirred for a certain time and then left stand until steady state was achieved. At each pressure, the phase behaviour was visually observed, and a laser pen was used to check the occurrence of Tyndall effect."
4,Hydrogenation reaction tests,"2.3 Hydrogenation reaction tests The hydrogenation reaction was conducted in a Parr autoclave (25 mL). In a typical reaction, 30 mg catalyst, 0.5 mmol 3-nitrostyrene, and 0.25 mmol o-xylene (as an internal standard for GC analysis) were mixed and added into the autoclave before it was sealed. Then, the autoclave was purged with N2 for several times followed by being charged with 3 MPa H2. Subsequently, CO2 was pumped into the autoclave until the designated pressure was reached. The autoclave was then heated to the reaction temperature of 60 °C in water bath meanwhile the mixture in the autoclave was stirred at a speed of 1200 rpm for 8 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled in icy water and depressurized slowly. The recovered organic liquid was analysed by an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with HP-5 columns and flame ionization detector (FID). For kinetic measurements, the conversions were controlled below 30% by varying the reaction time between 0.5 ~ 3 h to ensure the reaction proceeded in the kinetically controlled region. For the catalyst durability test, the catalyst was recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture. After rinsing by ethanol and drying, the catalyst was subjected to another batch of reaction."
5,Vapour-liquid equlibrium calculation,"2.4 Vapour-liquid equlibrium calculation The gas-liquid equilibrium phase compositions were calculated based on Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS). CO2-H2 binary interaction parameters were obtained by fitting experimental vapour liquid equation data reported in [30], and CO2-nitrostyrene and H2-nitrostyrene binary interaction parameters were estimated through the group contribution method [31]."
6,Results and discussion,
7,Determination of the dispersion of Co-species,"3.1 Determination of the dispersion of Co-species The single-atom Co-N-C catalyst was prepared by the method we reported previously [24]. The as-synthesized catalyst had a specific surface area of 649 m2/g and a cobalt loading of 4.2 wt%. To determine the dispersion of Co-species, XRD and normal electron microscopy characterizations were first conducted. As shown in Fig. 1 , XRD pattern did not show any diffraction peak due to metallic Co or cobalt oxides (Fig. 1(a)), which was in line with low-magnification TEM image where no any big Co/CoO x nanoparticles were observed (Fig. 1(b)), suggesting the high dispersion of Co-containing species. Subsequently, the sub-Ångström-resolution aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) technique was employed to probe the Co-containing species. As expected, a large number of uniformly dispersed Co single atoms were clearly observed in the image (Fig. 1(c)), and there was no tiny Co/CoO x clusters by examination of different regions, demonstrating the single-atom dispersion of cobalt, in good agreement with our previous work [24]."
8,Effect of H2 pressure,"3.2 Effect of H2 pressure Having successfully prepared Co-N-C SACs, we then investigated their catalytic performance in the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene in compressed CO2 medium. Besides the substrate and the internal standard for GC analysis, no extra organic solvent or additive was added for the consideration of environmentally benign process. The influence of H2 pressure on the catalytic efficiency was first studied, and the total pressure was maintained at about 9.2 MPa. As shown in Fig. 2(a) , with an increase of H2 pressure from 1 to 3 and 5 MPa, the conversion of 3-nitrostyrene increased rapidly from 32% to 84.7% and then to 100%, which could be attributed to the increased solubility of H2 in the substrate and compressed CO2. To our delight, the selectivity to 3-vinylaniline was always kept at 100% even at full conversion, demonstrating the unique advantage of single-atom catalyst in delivering the chemoselective transformations."
9,Influence of reaction temperature,"3.3 Influence of reaction temperature The dissolving ability of compressed CO2 is strongly affected by its density, which can be modulated by both temperature and pressure [32]. Accordingly, the influence of temperature on the catalytic performance was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the 3-nitrostyrene conversion increased rapidly with the reaction temperature and reached 100% at T ≥ 70 °C. Meanwhile, the selectivity to 3-vinylaniline was maintained > 99%. Even when the temperature was 80 °C, no byproduct due to over-hydrogenation was detected, suggesting the Co-N-C SAC was chemically inert for the hydrogenation of C=C bond as demonstrated by FTIR measurement and control experiment results we previously reported [24]."
10,Influence of system pressure,"3.4 Influence of system pressure As the system pressure had great impact on the phase behaviour, the dependence of catalytic performance on the total pressure was also studied, and the reaction temperature and H2 pressure were fixed at 60 °C and 3 MPa (RT), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(c), an inverted V-curve relation between the 3-nitrostyrene conversion and the CO2 pressure (as well as the total pressure) was observed. When no CO2 was charged into the reaction system (i.e., solvent free conditions), the 3-nitrostyrene conversion was only 76.3%. With the introduction of CO2 and the increase of the total pressure from 3.1 to 8.1 MPa (corresponding to CO2 pressure of 5.0 MPa), the 3-nitrostyrene conversion increased greatly from 76% to 100%. However, with further increase of total pressure above 8.1 MPa, the conversion dropped dramatically and down to only 69.1% at total pressure of 10.8 MPa. Again, in all cases the chemoselectivity to 3-vinylaniline was maintained high at > 99%, indicating that no over-hydrogenation side-reaction occurred on the single-atom Co-N-C catalyst. The inverted V-curve relation between catalytic activity and total pressure as well as CO2 pressure was in sharp contrast with our previous work where the conversion of 3-nitrostyrene over Pt1/FeO x SAC increased monotonically with the pressure of CO2 [29]. It is known that the solubility of 3-nitrostyrene in scCO2 decreases with the increase of temperature but increases with the pressure of CO2. In the Pt1/FeO x catalytic system, most of the charged 0.5 mmol 3-nitrostyrene could be dissolved in scCO2 when the pressure was higher than 10.3 MPa at 50 °C [29]. However, in the present work, the total pressure was lower (8.1 MPa) yet the reaction temperature (60 °C) was higher than that in the Pt1/FeO x catalytic system, therefore, 3-nitrostyrene (0.5 mmol) may not be completely dissolved in CO2, and therefore biphasic system might be formed. To approve the formation of biphase, the phase behavior of 3-nitrostyrene-CO2-H2 ternary system was investigated by a high pressure view cell. Figs. 3(a), 3(e), and 3(i) displayed the images of 3-nitrostyrene in the absence of CO2, which clearly showed a pure liquid phase. When CO2 was charged and the total pressure reached 8.1 MPa, however, a quite different phase phenomenon was observed, and the appearance of a clear interface indicates the formation of biphase. The upper phase looked light cloudy and showed a strong Tyndall effect (Figs. 3(b) and (f)), which was indicative of the formation of CO2/H2 gas-rich phase where small droplets of the 3-nitrostyrene were dispersed. Meanwhile, the liquid substrate could be observed in the bottom of the cell, indicating the lower part was a 3-nitrostyrene-rich liquid phase (Fig. 3(j)) in which both CO2 and H2 were dissolved. Clearly, biphasic system was formed at this stage. Based on these observations, we propose that at the total pressure of ~8 MPa (the corresponding CO2 pressure of ~5 MPa), a part of CO2 is dissolved in the substrate and facilitates the dissolution of H2, similar to what had been reported earlier that CO2 could be dissolved into organic solvent to form CO2-expanded liquid [33]. The fact that no obvious expansion of the 3-nitrostyrene volume was observed at this stage was probably due to the small dosage of the 3-nitrostyrene (0.5 mmol) [34]. When the total pressure was further increased to 9.2 MPa, a dense cloudy phase was observed between the upper gaseous and bottom liquid phases, which presented a thick and diverging light column upon being irradiated by a laser beam (Figs. 3(c) and (g)), suggesting emulsive dispersion of 3-nitrostyrene in CO2 (Fig. 3(k)). Finally, when the total pressure reached 13.4 MPa, a single transparent phase formed without any interface, indicating the complete dissolution of 3-nitrostyrene in scCO2 (Figs. 3(d), (h) and (l)). It was earlier reported that the volume expansion became significant and continuum of CO2-expanded solvent was formed when the organic solvent accounted for at least 20 mol% [34,35]. Thereby, to further verify the volume expansion with increasing CO2 pressure, 6 mL of nitrobenzene was added into the view cell and the phase behaviour of CO2-nitrobenzene binary system was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4 , the liquid level rose gradually with an increase of CO2 pressure, indicating that CO2 was dissolved into nitrobenzene and consequently caused the liquid volume expansion. More interesting, when CO2 pressure arrived at 5.14 MPa, CO2 started to penetrate quickly into nitrobenzene at the gas-liquid interface and formed a dilute layer with lighter colour than the bulk, which was more obviously observed at CO2 pressure of 6.1 MPa. This phase change point was not only in coincidence with the biphase formation in the 3-nitrostyrene-CO2-H2 ternary system (Fig. 3(b), (f), (g)), but also consistent with the peak conversion of 3-nitrostyrene in Fig. 2(c), thus strongly suggests that at this turning point the concentrations of H2 and substrate 3-nitrostyrene at the catalyst surface may reach the maxima given that the CO2-expanded organic liquid phase improves the dissolution of H2 in 3-nitrostyrene liquid phase. With further increase of CO2 pressure from 5.14 to 6.95 MPa, the liquid was continuously expanded until the full volume of the cell at 6.95 MPa. Considering that the dissolving capability of scCO2 is closely related to its density, we also calculated the density of CO2 at 60 °C and different pressures. The results showed that the CO2 had densities of 0.0984, 0.1308, and 0.3165 g/mL at CO2 pressure of 5.0, 6.2 and 10.4 MPa, respectively [36]. Accordingly, the amount of 3-nitrostyrene dissolved in CO2 will increase following the same order as CO2 density with the change of CO2 pressure: 5.0 MPa < 6.2 MPa < 10.4 MPa, and the concentration in the liquid phase containing catalyst will adversely decrease in this order. This can explain the descending trend of 3-nitrostyrene with the total pressure at the right side of Fig. 2(c) when the total pressure is higher than 8.1 MPa (corresponding to CO2 partial pressure of ~5 MPa). To provide a more precise estimation of the hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase at different CO2 and H2 pressures, we calculated the solubility of H2 in the CO2-expanded 3-nitrostyrene substrate liquid phase at 60 °C based on the PR EOS, and the result is shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that the solubility of H2 firstly increased with the CO2 pressure and reached maximum at about 5.0 MPa and then decreased rapidly at higher CO2 pressure. Such an inverted V-curve is well consistent with the activity curve with the CO2 pressure (Fig. 2(c)), and also agrees well with the report of Devetta et al. [37], implying that the solubility of H2 in the CO2-expanded liquid phase is a main factor determining the reaction rate. To further clarify the impact of CO2 pressure (as well as total pressure) on the reaction rate, we performed kinetic studies, and the results are summarized in Figs. 6 and 7 as well as Tables S1-S5. The reaction orders with respect to 3-nitrostyrene at total pressure of 8.1 and 11.2 MPa were measured to be 0.7 and 0.8, respectively, both of them were close to first-order dependence, indicating the adsorption/activation of 3-nitrostyrene was involved in the rate-determining step and was almost independent on the total pressure. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7, under conditions of CO2-free and total pressure of 11.2 MPa, the reaction orders with respect to H2 pressure were measured to be 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, suggesting the heterolytic dissociation of H2 and the attack of –NO2 by proton was involved in the rate-determining step [38,39]. By contrast, at total pressure of 8.1 MPa (corresponding to the CO2 partial pressure of 5.0 MPa), two-stage relations between ln(P H2) and ln(r) were observed. That is, the reaction order with respect to H2 was 0.7 in the range of 1−2.5 MPa H2, whereas 0.06 when the pressure of H2 was 3−5 MPa. The nearly zero order at the total pressure of 8.1 MPa suggested that the solubility of H2 in the liquid phase was greatly enhanced by the dissolved CO2 such that the catalyst surface was saturated with H2. Therefore, by changing the CO2 partial pressure at a fixed H2 pressure one can effectively tune the hydrogen solubility in the CO2-expanded liquid phase, and consequently change the reaction kinetics towards high catalytic efficiency over the single-atom catalyst. Taken together, the CO2 pressure influenced the phase behaviour and consequently the kinetics of the single-atom Co-N-C catalytic system, which made CO2 expanded substrate liquid rather than the single gaseous phase be the most effective medium for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. Similarly, Arai's group reported expanded liquid substrate phase was effective medium for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol [40]. The reason was also ascribed to the high concentration of cinnamaldehyde and H2, as well as decreased viscosity, however, no kinetic and phase behaviour studies were performed in that work. By contrast, in our previously reported Pt1/FeO x system for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene in scCO2, the ideal medium was a single gaseous phase (i.e., the substrate was completely dissolved in scCO2) [29]. The reason was ascribed to the increased solubility of H2 as well as the reduced viscosity that facilitated the mass transfer of reactants."
11,Durability of Co-N-C catalyst,"3.5 Durability of Co-N-C catalyst Catalyst durability is one of the most important concerns for practical utilization. After the reaction, the Co-N-C single-atom catalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration or centrifugation, and was subjected to another batch of reaction without additional treatment. As shown in Fig. 8 , the catalyst could be recycled for at least 4 times without obvious decay in either catalytic activity or chemo-selectivity. HAADF-STEM image of the recovered catalyst showed that cobalt still existed as single atoms without any aggregation (Fig. 1(d)), demonstrating the high stability of the single-atom Co-N-C catalysts."
12,Conclusions,"In summary, compressed CO2 was explored as environmentally benign medium for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene over single-atom Co-N-C catalyst. An inverted V-curve relation was found between the catalytic activity and the total pressure (or CO2 pressure), with the conversion peak (100%) being attained at the total pressure of 8.1 MPa (corresponding CO2 pressure of 5.0 MPa). CO2-H2-nitrostyrene ternary system phase behaviour studies revealed that under the optimum total pressure of 8.1 MPa, biphasic system was formed where the upper part was CO2/H2 gas-rich phase and the lower part was CO2-expanded nitrostyrene liquid phase. The formation of CO2-expanded substrate liquid greatly increased the solubility of H2, changing the reaction order with respect to H2 from ~0.5 to nearly zero. The favourable reaction kinetics assisted by the compressed CO2 led to the complete conversion of 3-nitrostyrene at mild reaction temperature (60 °C), and the single-atom dispersion of Co offered > 99% selectivity to 3-vinylaniline even at full conversions. In addition, the single-atom catalyst could be reused for 4 times without obvious decrease of conversion or chemoselectivity. Our work provides an alternative route to tuning the catalytic performance by jointly using green compressed CO2 and noble-metal-free single-atom catalysts."
