0,Introduction,"Unsaturated alcohols form a very important group of reagents for the synthesis of fine chemicals, especially for pharmacology, perfume and food processing industry, being the selective hydrogenation an important step in these processes. Moreover, the use of unsaturated alcohols as corrosion inhibitors is widely extended since these compounds strongly adsorb on different metal surfaces through the unsaturated bonds present in their structures [1–3]. The investigation of the electroadsorption, electrooxidation and electroreduction of saturated and unsaturated C3-alcohols at Pt in acidic media, using electrochemical techniques combined with Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIRS) and on-line mass spectrometry (DEMS), has been the subject of several studies in recent years [4–8 and references therein]. Both techniques provide complementary information allowing a better knowledge of the electrochemical reactions of these alcohols. In all cases, adsorbed species were formed on the electrode, whose nature depends on the adsorption potential [4,6,7]. These adsorbates can be electroreduced yielding C2- and C3-hydrocarbons, whereas the electrooxidation produces only CO2. Different products were obtained with the alcohol present in the bulk of the solution. Usually, the electrooxidation produces the corresponding aldehyde [4–8], although propionic acid is found for n-propanol [4]. On the other hand, saturated and unsaturated C2- and C3-hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, were detected during electroreduction [6,7]. Propargyl (PA) and allyl (AA) alcohols also strongly adsorb on Pd in acid solutions [9–11]. For PA, CO2 was the sole oxidation product from bulk and adsorbed species, while the electroreduction processes were very similar to Pt [9]. However, for AA [10] at Pd, results differ respect to Pt: C3-hydrocarbons and acroleine were detected with AA in the bulk, in addition to C2-hydrocarbons and CO2, the latter compounds related to adsorbed species. On Au in acids, only PA is able to form strongly bound intermediates [5]. As in the case of the electrooxidation on Pt, propargyl aldehyde and CO2 were formed from bulk PA but only CO2 from the residues. C3-hydrocarbons and AA were produced by electroreduction, the alcohol only with PA in the solution. On this metal, AA can be electrooxidized yielding CO2 and acrolein, whereas for n-propanol no reactions were observed. The adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbons on Pt electrodes has been extensively studied applying DEMS [12–18 and references cited therein], ethene and propene the most related with the present investigations. For ethene, surface species were proposed to be π and di-σ-bonded ethene, multibonded ethylidyne and oxygen-containing residues [12–16], whereas for propene associatively bonded propene and partially dehydrogenated C3-hydrocarbon residues, as well as C3-, C2- and/or C1-oxygen-containing species, were established [18]. Although these are related compounds, the presence of the OH group in crotyl alcohol could alter the overall reactivity, and therefore, unsaturated alcohols are more appropriated to be considered as references for CA electrochemical behaviour. This paper, following our previous works on this topic [4–11], is devoted to study the electrochemical reactivity on Pt of crotyl alcohol (CA), which is an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol with a double bond in the allyl position (CH3 CHCHCH2OH), applying the spectroelectrochemical methods mentioned above. Previous results on the reactivity of AA (CH2 CHCH2OH) under similar experimental conditions, at Au, Pt and Pd electrodes [5,6,10], are used to carry out a comparative study between both alcohols. The electrochemical behaviour of CA on Pt has been the aim of several investigations in the past [19–22]. Horanyi et al. were the first to show that CA can be reduced mainly to butane in acid media, using gas chromatography for the analysis of the gases evolved during the reduction process. Also 1-butene, cis- and trans-butene, as well as methane, ethane and propane, were found as traces. In the present paper, the production of these gases is followed on-line, establishing the potential dependence for these reactions."
1,Experimental,"Solutions were prepared with Millipore-MilliQ* water, analytical grade H2SO4 or HClO4 and CA. CA concentration was varied from 2×10−3 to 2×10−2 M. The electrodes were whether a platinum foil (1.6cm2 real area; 0.5cm2 geometric area) for voltammetric and chronoamperometric studies, a porous Pt layer sputtered on a microporous PTFE membrane for DEMS experiments (15–16cm2 real area; 0.8cm2 geometric area), or a platinum disk (10mm diameter) for FTIRS. Clean surfaces were obtained by flame annealing in a gas–oxygen flame and cooling in an argon atmosphere (except for DEMS). The electrochemical cells were completed with a plate or a wire of platinized Pt as counter electrode and a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) prepared in the supporting electrolyte as reference. All the experiments were performed at room temperature under Ar (99.998%) atmosphere. CA was adsorbed on the Pt electrode at controlled adsorption potentials (E ad) from 0.05 to 0.80V. Then, the anodic stripping of the isolated adspecies was performed. The complete experimental procedure consists of the following steps: (a) Adsorption. The potential was stopped in the supporting electrolyte at E ad during the anodic scan and the CA solution was introduced in the cell. An adsorption time of 5min ensures the achievement of the maximum coverage of the surface with the adsorbates. (b) Elimination of bulk CA. Subsequently, the solution was completely replaced by pure base electrolyte under potential control at E ad. In order to ensure a total electrolyte replacement, about 10 times the volume needed to fill the electrochemical cell was allowed to flow through. (c) Stripping of the adlayer. CA residues were oxidized through the application of a positive-going potential scan starting at E ad up to 1.50V at a scan rate of 0.05Vs−1. Successive potential cycles were recorded until the potentiodynamic profile of a clean Pt surface was obtained. A flow electrochemical cell directly attached to the vacuum chamber containing the mass spectrometer (BALZERS QMG112) was used for DEMS. The experimental set-up is appropriate for the simultaneous acquisition of the mass spectrometric cyclic voltammograms (MSCVs) for selected mass to charge ratio (m/z) and conventional cyclic voltammograms (CVs). The working electrode was activated by consecutive potential cycling in the base electrolyte at 0.01Vs−1 between 0.01 and 1.5V. Control experiments to assure the system purity were carried out by simultaneous recording of the MSCV for m/z =44 (carbon dioxide, [CO2] +) during the electrode activation. The mass spectrometer was calibrated for CO2 according to the procedure described in refs. [10,23,24]. A value of 1.2×10−9 was obtained for the constant of the mass spectrometer, K *. With this constant, the number of electrons involved in the reaction per CO2 molecule, n, can be estimated for CA adsorbates. More details of the method are available in ref. [10]. FTIR studies were carried out with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer equipped provided with a MCT detector. The electrochemical IR cell, fitted with a 60° CaF2 prismatic window, was provided with an inlet and outlet for electrolyte exchange under potential control. For each spectrum, 128 interferograms were collected with a resolution of 8cm−1. Parallel (p) and perpendicular (s) polarized IR light spectra were obtained from a BaF2 supported Al grid polarizer. Spectra are represented as the ratio R/R 0, where R and R 0 are the reflectance corresponding to the sample and reference spectra, respectively. Thus, negative and positive bands represent, respectively, the gain and loss of species at the sampling potential. The reference potential is indicated for each experiment. The IR procedure to study the electrochemical reactivity of organics has been extensively described in ref. [25]."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Electrooxidation process,"3.1 Electrooxidation process 3.1.1 Bulk reactions The cyclic voltammogram corresponding to a DEMS Pt electrode in a 0.02M CA+0.5M H2SO4 solution is given in Fig. 1a. Experiments were first conducted in sulphuric acid to compare the electrochemical behaviour with that of 3-buten-2-one [26], a similar compound previously studied in this media by our group (see Section 3.3). The onset for CA electrooxidation occurs about 0.70V during the positive run, at the same potential observed for others alcohols [4–11]. Two voltammetric features are developed during the positive-going potential scan at 1.00 and 1.30V. A new anodic contribution is also detected when the potential sweep direction is reversed, as soon as the reduction of the oxide layer formed in the positive scan occurs. MSCVs for selected m/z ratios were simultaneously recorded. At E >0.70V only two potential dependent mass signals were detected. These are m/z =44 and 41 (Fig. 1b and c, respectively). The signal for m/z =44 shows the formation of CO2 which takes place mainly under the first voltammetric oxidation peak. An increase of the mass signal is again observed during the negative-going sweep in concordance with the feature previously described in the CV. The small contribution for m/z =41 ([CH3CHCH]+, main peak for crotonaldehyde fragmentation) in the platinum oxide region points out the formation of the aldehyde as a second oxidation product. Its production starts at more positive potentials than that of CO2, and can be associated to the second voltammetric feature. Also in this case, a new increase in the ion current is apparent in the negative-going scan but negatively shifted respect to CO2. Other m/z ratios, such as m/z =86 corresponding to the main peak of the crotonic acid ([CH3CHCHCOOH] +), were tested but no potential dependence was found for them. The absence of this product is confirmed by FTIRS (see later). The shape of the CVs depends on the CA bulk concentration. If the concentration is reduced 10 times (from 0.02 to 0.002M), the ion charge associated to the CO2 production (not shown) decreases about 35% whilst the electrooxidation charge diminishes ca. 45%. Moreover, the second voltammetric contribution decreases and the m/z =41 signal shows no potential dependence at E >1.20V. These results can be explained considering that most CO2 production occurs from the electrooxidation of adsorbed species, whose amount on the surface is almost constant for both CA concentrations. Then, the higher lost found in the electrooxidation charge is proposed to be attributed to the aldehyde formation in the 0.02M CA solution, process which does not occur for the 0.002M concentration. The base electrolyte has been changed for the IR experiments in order to avoid the superimposition of the bands corresponding to bisulphate anions (1200–1280cm−1) [27] with signals due to species formed in the electrochemical processes. For this reason, cyclic voltammetry and some DEMS experiments were performed in HClO4 to check that no influence of the anion adsorption occurs on the electrochemical reactions of CA. Fig. 2 shows that similar CVs are recorded in both electrolytes for polycrystalline Pt (the small differences can be interpreted in terms of the difference in the pH of the solution). Moreover, no changes in the nature of bulk oxidation and reduction products are observed when DEMS is applied. Similar results have been obtained with other unsaturated alcohols [6,7]. Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra acquired with p-polarized light in a 0.02M CA+0.1M HClO4 solution during the progressive CA electrooxidation from 0.25V (E ref) up to 1.50V. A series of negative bands develop with increasing the potential. The band at 1104cm−1 is due to perchlorate ions. The negative feature at 2344cm−1 is assigned to the OCO stretching vibration and reveals the formation of CO2 at E >0.65V. Simultaneously with the CO2 production, three negative signals are apparent at 1680, 1398 and 1163cm−1, which are attributed to crotonaldehyde formation. These bands correspond to the carbonyl vibration, CH stretching in the COH group and CC stretching vibration of the chain, respectively [28]. Therefore, the formation of the aldehyde as a second oxidation reaction is confirmed. Finally, the signal at 2020cm−1, which appears positive for E >1.00V and bipolar at more negative potentials, is related to adsorbed linear carbon monoxide (COL). The low intensity of this band indicates that the corresponding coverage of the surface by this adsorbate is also low. The potential dependence of the band intensities for the signals at 2344, 1398 and 1163cm−1 is given in Fig. 4 . The onset for the three spectral features is about 0.65V, a value that differs from the DEMS results. However, this apparent discrepancy can be explained, once it is shown that the influence of the electrolyte cannot be responsible (Fig. 2), taking into account that both experiments have been performed under different experimental conditions. Thus, potentiodynamic experiments were design for DEMS whereas for FTIRS stationary spectra were acquired after a potential step (therefore, pontentiostatic) in a thin layer configuration, which suffers from inhibited mass transport to/from the electrode. Therefore, small differences, as observed in the onset potential, could be expected and the interpretation of the results obtained with each technique has to be performed on the light of these circumstances. The bands at 1398 and 1163cm−1 follow the same potential dependence, describing a maximum about 1.00–1.10V with a slow decrease at more positive potentials when the platinum oxide starts to inhibit the oxidation of CA. On the other hand, the CO2 signal increases sharply in the 0.65–1.20V range, then remains constant, and a further increase takes place at E >1.40V. The decrease in the COL signal can be correlated with the CO2 production, as it is observed in Fig. 4a. The production of CO2 at E >1.40V is related to the oxidation of other adspecies, probably containing CH residues, which remain adsorbed at these potential on the electrode surface (see next section). The inset in Fig. 4a displays the plot of the COL band centre versus potential. The wavenumber shifts linearly towards higher values as the potential is set more positive, with a slope (dν/dE)=30cm−1 V−1. Taking into account the low intensity of the COL band, which indicates a low coverage for this intermediate, a value of about 75cm−1 V−1 is expected for the slope if only linear carbon monoxide is present on the surface, but the value from Fig. 4 is, in fact, in concordance with the presence of coadsorbed species [29]. 3.1.2 Adsorbate reactions CA electroadsorption was studied in the E ad =0.05–0.80V potential range. First, current transients were acquired during the electroadsorption (not shown), describing different behaviours with E ad. For E ad >0.25V anodic current transients were recorded. The curves decay to zero in 1min at E ad =0.25–0.30V, and remains anodic at more positive potentials. On the other hand, for E ad <0.25V cathodic current transients were obtained, suggesting that reduction of CA occurs. The CVs for the oxidation of the adsorbates formed at selected E ad are given in Fig. 5a and the corresponding oxidation charge densities plotted in Fig. 5b. The presence of residues is confirmed in all cases, the maximum coverage attained at E ad =0.25–0.30V. Three E ad were selected for DEMS and FTIR adsorption studies, namely 0.115, 0.250 and 0.600V, which are representative for the different electroadsorption processes. MSCVs for the direct electrooxidation of the residues can be seen in Fig. 6 . CO2 was the sole oxidation product and at least three voltammetric cycles up to 1.50V were needed to remove completely the adsorbates from the surface (not shown). This fact suggests that partially oxidized adspecies are formed during each potential run. The same results have been reported for other alcohols [4–11], concluding that the number of oxidation cycles increases with the number of unsaturated bonds in the molecule. Depending on E ad, two CO2 production regions are distinguishable in the MSCVs. For E ad =0.115V, the adsorbate electrooxidation starts about 0.55V and two well-defined features appear, whereas for E ad =0.25 and 0.60V a sole broad peak with a current maximum at 1.05V is detected. These results seem to be related to the presence of different residues. During the second electrooxidation cycle, two contributions to the CO2 evolution are always observed. The values of the corresponding oxidation and ion charge densities for m/z =44 are summarized in Table 1 . As in the case of bulk studies, test experiments in perchloric acid were performed for adsorbates. No differences in the shape of the current responses (see Fig. 7 as example for E ad =0.25V) and in the electrochemical products were obtained. In FTIR experiments, once the adsorbates were formed at selected E ad following the procedure described in Section 2, progressive oxidation was carried out by application of potential steps to selected potentials (indicated in the figures). Fig. 8 shows the spectra corresponding to the oxidation of the adsorbates formed at E ad =0.600, 0.250 and 0.115V. As a common fact, the residues oxidize to CO2 (negative band at 2343cm−1) although the onset for its production is observed at more negative potentials for E ad =0.115V. The formation of COL (signal around 2000–2010cm−1) during adsorption is established, its intensity depending on E ad. Thus, at E ad =0.115V a positive signal is clearly defined, whereas at more positive E ad the band is very weak. At the former potential, COB was also detected (positive band at ca. 1800cm−1). All these results confirm the influence of E ad on the nature of the adspecies. Moreover, in this figure it is possible to distinguish new negative going bands, although the water bending around 1640cm−1 disturbs the spectra. These signals are attributed to intermediates formed during the electrooxidation processes. For E ad =0.600V, a negative band appears at 1737cm−1 and other two around 1223 and 1123cm−1 which can be connected with the production of some amounts of crotonic acid as intermediate [28]. Other common characteristic at all E ad is the presence of a positive band at 1680cm−1 which appears as a shoulder of the water band in most spectra. Although the water bending contribution makes difficult the assignment of this feature, it is tentatively associated to the CC stretch. If so, CA has to be adsorbed, at least in part, tilted with respect to the electrode surface for this signal to be allowed by the surface selection rule."
4,Electroreduction process,"3.2 Electroreduction process 3.2.1 Bulk reactions Several reduction products were detected when the potential sweep was performed down to the hydrogen evolution region. In Fig. 1b and c, an increase in both mass signals is apparent at E <0.25V simultaneously with a cathodic current in the CV (Fig. 1a). The signal for m/z =44 in this potential region is attributed undoubtedly to the production of propane ([CH3CH2CH3] +). However, that for m/z =41 can be associated to 2-butene and/or propene. On order to clarify which one is formed, other characteristic m/z values for these compounds were checked: m/z =56 (2-butene, [CH3CHCHCH3] +) and m/z =38 (propene, [C3H2]+). Both MSCVs were potential dependent, confirming the formation both these hydrocarbons. Moreover, the following mass signals increase at E <0.25V: m/z =58 and 43 (butane, [CH3CH2CH2CH3] + and [C3H5]+, respectively), m/z =30 (ethane, [CH3CH3] +) and m/z =28, 27, 26 and 15, which are more difficult to be assigned due to the superimposition of different hydrocarbon fragments. No alcohols (m/z =31, [CH2OH]+) were detected. The same potential dependent mass signals were recorded from CA residues (Figs. 10 and 11). This fact indicates that the process proceeds mainly via adsorbates and will be discussed later in Section 3.2.2. The IR spectra recorded with p-polarized light during the electroreduction are plotted in Fig. 9 . The negative bands located at 2964, 2934 and 2875cm−1 are assigned to the CH3 and CH2 asymmetric stretching and the CH2 symmetric stretching, respectively [28]. The high intensity of these signals confirms that a massive hydrogenation is occurring at E <0.10V. The presence of the same bands at E >0.10V, increasing in intensity when the potential was stepped in the positive direction, corroborates DEMS reduction experiments where a higher production of hydrocarbons has been detected during the positive-going sweep in the 0.05–0.25 range (for example, see Fig. 1c). Simultaneously, other negative features develop at 2010, 1708, 1467 and 1377cm−1. The signal at 2010cm−1 corresponds to the formation of adsorbed COL and points out the break down of CA molecules during hydrogenation in this potential region. The bands at 1467 and 1377cm−1 are related to the CH2 scissors vibrations and CH3 symmetric deformation, respectively. The signal at 1685cm−1, although disturbed by the presence of the positive band due to uncompensated water in the same spectrum region, could be due to the CC stretching [28]. 3.2.2 Adsorbate reactions DEMS reduction experiments of the adsorbates were performed by three consecutive voltammetric cycles in the H-region. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, several potential dependent m/z ratios were recorded during this process. Then, the electrooxidation of the remaining species was carried out and the CO2 production followed by the signal m/z =44. All these mass signals furnish valuable information on the possible nature of the adsorbates. Figs. 10 and 11 show the MSCVs related to appropriated reduction compounds. Thus, it is possible to assure the formation of butene (m/z =56), butane (m/z =58), propane (m/z =44), propene (m/z =38) and ethane (m/z =30). The signal for m/z =15 displays also a potential dependence. Though this mass signal can be the result of the superimposition of the different fractions, however its dependence on E ad in Table 2 differs from the other masses confirming the formation of methane. Conversely, in the case of m/z =26, the intensity of this signal can be interpreted as the result of the different contribution from the species already established. Although the characterization of the reduction products can be done from the detection of the corresponding m/z rations and its potential dependence, quantitative analysis cannot be performed with the present results as the corresponding mass signals are not calibrated. It has to be mentioned that only butane and butene were detected by gas chromatographic analysis in refs. [19–21], but these results are not directly comparable with those in the present paper, as they were obtained from the electrolysis performed at 0.03, 0.05 and 0.10V on platinized platinum electrodes. The onset potential, E O, for the formation of reduction products depends on E ad, being more negative when E ad is set more positive, except for methane (m/z =15). E O gives information about the reaction sequence for the production of the different hydrocarbons. Thus, E O =0.20V for m/z =58 (butane), whereas E O =0.13V for m/z =56 (1-butene) at E ad =0.25V, i.e. the saturated C4-hydrocarbon is formed first during the negative-going potential sweep. Moreover, the shape of the MSCVs is different, revealing that the production of both hydrocarbons proceed from two different adsorbates. On the other hand, E O for the formation of propene (m/z =38) is approximately 0.20V while for propane (m/z =44) is around 0.15V. In this case, it is possible to think that the formation of propane results from hydrogenation of propene previously formed. Therefore, the same adspecies could be responsible for both hydrocarbons."
5,Possible electrochemical reactions,"3.3 Possible electrochemical reactions Firstly, it is necessary to consider that, according to Young and Franklin [30], CA is isomerized in acidic media following the equilibrium: Therefore, it has to be assumed that all these isomers are present in the solution. Taking into account this equilibrium and analyzing the results for the current transients, DEMS and FTIRS experiments, the reaction pathways for the electrooxidation and electroreduction can be suggested. From the structural point of view, CA has two reactive centres, namely the double bond and the methoxy group, as proposed for AA in refs. [3,8]. If the adsorption takes place by interaction between the surface and the C-atom containing the OH group, two adsorbed species can be formed depending on the isomer considered: (1) or (2) Similar adsorbed species, where the molecule remains practically intact on the electrode, were considered in the cases of 3-buten-2-one and 2-butanone adsorption on Pt [26]. Depending on the E ad, these adsorbates can undergo a second deprotonation: (3) or a fragmentation similar to that described in ref. [26]: (4) being these pathways in agreement with those suggested for the electroadsorption of propanol, AA and PA [4–7]. The second interaction of CA with the electrode could be through the double bond, in the same way described for the AA and PA [5–7]. When the isomer is trans- or cis-CA, the following reaction is proposed: (5) whereas for the α-methyl allyl alcohol the interaction furnishes adsorbate (G): (6) Di-σ-bound species have been proposed for adsorbed alkenes [12–18], whereas in the present paper, as well as in previous ones concerning the adsorption of AA [6] and 3-buten-2-ona and [26], the CC configuration is proposed in reactions (4)–(6) to justify the values of the anodic current transients obtained during adsorption. Ethylidine species are less probable for CA due to the presence of other reactive centres in addition to the double bond. Finally, a third possibility is the interaction between the π-system of CA and the empty d-orbitals from the Pt electrode. The strength of this interaction is weaker than that for the other adspecies. The calculation of n, the number of electrons released per CO2 molecule (see Section 2), corresponding to the oxidation of CA adsorbed species at selected E ad (Table 1), provides additional information to establish the nature of the residues. Although this parameter could be dependent on the corrections done for anion adsorption and surface oxidation to the integration of the currents in the CV, the error for adsorbates with high oxidation charges is smaller, and n values can be comparatively analyzed at the different E ad (reproducible values were obtained and an experimental error of ±0.1 was established). The complete oxidation of CA to CO2 is given by: (7) H3CCHCHCH2OH+7H2O→4CO2 +22H+ +22e− and, accordingly, n =22/4=5.5. This value is closed to that obtained for E ad =0.250V (n =5) but higher than those for E ad =0.600 (n =3.6) and 0.115V (n =4). The oxidation of residues (A) to (G) to CO2 implies n values varying from 4.5 to 5.25, which can explain the results for E ad =0.250V. At E ad =0.115, it has been proved by FTIRS that the CA molecule is broken providing COL and COB and small amounts of other hydrocarbon residues. The presence of certain amounts of COL and COB on the surface diminishes n at this potential as CO oxidation involves a value of n =2. Finally, the small value calculated for E ad =0.600V (n =3.6) can be explained by a partial oxidation of the residues during adsorption. At this potential, anodic current transients were recorded indicating that the oxidation already occurs. Nevertheless, residues maintaining the C4-structure have to be present on the surface at the three E ad, in order to justify the production of butane and butene during reduction. It is remarkable that no bands related to the CH stretching or bending vibrations of the adsorbates previously described were detected. This fact can be explained considering, first, that the bending vibrations are very weak; and secondly, that the stretching vibrations appear ca. 3000cm−1, a region strongly affected by the water vibration. Finally, it should be noticed that in adsorbates (A)–(C), the CC bond is located with an appropriate orientation for the FTIRS detection. Adsorbates (A)–(G) have to be responsible for the products detected by DEMS and FTIRS. Thus, reactions for the formation of the products from these adspecies are proposed. Firstly, the electroreduction products are considered. The same compounds were detected from bulk CA and CA adsorbates (Section 3.2), which indicates that the reduction processes mainly involve adsorbed species. Only hydrocarbons were detected: C4 (butane and butane), C3 (propane and propene) and probably C2 (ethane) and C1 (methane). The production of butene (Fig. 11e) and butane (Fig. 10c) can be described by the same reactions proposed for other unsaturated alcohols [5–7], that is, hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of appropriate adsorbates: (8) (9) Obviously, proposed pathways (8) and (9) are not elementary steps, as 3 and 6 atoms of adsorbed hydrogen are involved. These reactions have been established assuming that the two hydrocarbons probably proceed from different adsorbed species. The experimental results supporting this assumption are, from one side, the fact that E O from the MSCVs for the production of butane is more positive than for butene; and from the other, that the potential dependence of these curves is different. Conversely, in the case of propene (Fig. 10b) and propane (Fig. 11d), it is possible that both originate from the same adsorbate, as the production of the unsaturated C3-hydrocarbon occurs at more positive potentials. The cleavage of the CA molecule is necessary, and therefore, a process involving the fragmentation of the adsorbate and hydrogenation with H ad is proposed: The formation of adsorbed CO during electroreduction is confirmed in the FTIR spectra in Fig. 9 and explains the value of n obtained at E ad =0.115V. Finally, the production of C1-hydrocarbon (Fig. 11b) and C2-hydrocarbon (Fig. 11c) is justified from adsorbed species (D) and (E) formed in reaction (4). In the first step, hydrogenation of (E) takes place by means of H ad to form methane at more positive potential: (12) and, consecutively, at E <0.10V hydrogenation of (D) occurs to produce ethane: (13) On the other hand, CO2 was the sole electrooxidation product detected from CA adsorbates (Figs. 6 and 8), whereas with the alcohol in solution also crotonaldehyde was established. Accordingly, adspecies (A)–(G) oxidize to CO2, probably in several steps, with the formation of intermediates which remain in part on the surface as proved by IR experiments (Fig. 8) and by the successive potential cycles necessary for the complete removal of the adspecies (Fig. 6). These intermediates are probably partially oxidized, and this fact supposes a decrease in the value of n as proved experimentally for E ad =0.600V. The production of crotonaldehyde can be explained by the third type of interaction mentioned before, involving π-orbitals of CA and the empty d-orbital of Pt [5,6]. In this way, adspecies responsible for the yield of the aldehyde are weakly bonded to the surface and probably cannot survive the electrolyte exchange."
6,Conclusions,"The combination of cyclic voltammetry, DEMS and FTIR techniques, as well as flow cell procedures, has allowed us to propose a general view of the electrochemical reactivity of CA on Pt electrodes in acid media. The CA bulk oxidation produces crotonaldehyde and CO2, whereas its reduction yields C4-, C3-, C2- and C1-hydrocarbons. CA adsorbs in the range 0.05–0.85V with a maximum attained at 0.25V. For E ad <0.25V the adsorption occurs with a partial reduction and fragmentation of CA, and for E ad >0.30 the oxidation occurs. During the former reaction, adsorbed CO is formed. Residues oxidize to CO2 and reduce to form the same hydrocarbons previously mentioned. This fact indicates that the main pathway for the electroreduction involves adsorbed species. The nature of the hydrocarbons is independent on E ad pointing out that similar residues are formed. However, the intensity of the corresponding DEMS signals is potential dependent, and therefore, the amount of the possible adspecies varies with E ad. This result accords with the values of n. Several adsorbates which can explain voltammetric, DEMS and FTIR data are proposed."
