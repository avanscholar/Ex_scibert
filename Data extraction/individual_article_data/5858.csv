0,Introduction,"Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen evolution represents a promising approach to produce clean and high-purity hydrogen fuel, which has been proposed as a “core clean energy technology” and would be essential for the future energy infrastructure based on hydrogen economy [1]. Today, some catalysts based on noble metals, such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru) and palladium (Pd) materials, exhibit great electrocatalytic activity, which can accomplish the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a low over-potential and with a small Tafel slope especially under acidic conditions [2]. However, the high cost and limited supply from the nature sources hinder their large-scale employment. Therefore, it is of critical importance to search for efficient, inexpensive, and durable electrocatalysts to replace the noble metal catalysts for expediting the HER. However, only till recent years, the scientists have understood that hydrogen evolution proceeds via a similar pathway with hydrogenation (hydrotreating process) such as hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation, during which the reversible adsorption/desorption of hydrogen over the catalysts are the critical step for achieving fast kinetics [3]. This correlation establishes a new avenue to find noble-metal-free catalysts for HER. For instance, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) like Ni2P [4], previously employed as the catalyst for hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation, could currently also be used as the active catalyst for HER. Because the elements in TMPs are earth-abundant and TMPs have desirable catalytic performance, after the discovery of Ni2P catalyst for HER, various TMPs such as NiP2 [5], Cu3P [6], MoP [7], CoP [8], Co2P [9] and FeP [10] have been reported as efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for HER. In particular, amorphous tungsten phosphide (WP) nanoparticles have been developed by Schaak’s group as an efficient HER catalyst operating in acidic solution [11]. They reported that in 0.50 mol·L−1 H2SO4 (aq) the as-prepared electrode for HER could produce a current density of 10 and 20 mA·cm−2 at an over-potential of only 120 and 140 mV, respectively. However, a substrate like Ti foam was required to support the amorphous WP nanoparticles (forming a WP/Ti composite) to complete the electrochemical process; and the introduction of non-conductive polymers to protect the Ti foam makes the electrochemical process much complicated and unstable. Later, Sun et al. [12] successfully prepared a composite of tungsten phosphide nanorod arrays on carbon cloth, which exhibited high HER activity with an over-potential of 130 and 230 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively. But in their work, the applied WO3 precursor was prepared by hydrothermal process, which may cause many defects and relatively low crystallinity for the composite compared with those prepared by high temperature calcination. However, to the best of our knowledge, as a hot topic in this filed, although several literatures have been reported on tungsten phosphides as HER catalysts [11–18], there are rare publications on network-like nanostructured tungsten phosphides [17,18], which have relatively large specific area and thus more active sites for hydrogen evolution. On the other hand, prior to electrochemical tests, most of the reported HER catalysts are required to be effectively immobilized on current collectors by using a polymer binder like Nafion or PTFE as the film-forming agent. The polymer binder will generally increase the electrical resistance of the composite catalysts [19], block the active sites and inhibit the diffusion of H+, leading to a reduced effective catalytic activity [20]. However, it is known that, if the electrocatalysts can be grown directly on three-dimensional (3D) structures to form 3D self-supported electrodes, polymer binders could be free of use to avoid the above disadvantages [16,21]; and 3D self-supported electrodes possess robust skeleton and large surface area, thus effectively increasing the contact area between the catalyst and electrolyte, compared with the traditional electrodes coated on 2D substrates by spin-coating, dip-coating, or sputtering. Therefore, 3D electrodes can always exhibit much better performance than the planar ones [21,22]. In addition, it was reported that the direct growth of metal salt (the precursor of phosphide) could be realized via electrodeposition, hydrothermal synthesis and high-temperature calcination [23–26]. And compared with electrodeposition or hydrothermal synthesis, the direct growth of the precursor of phosphides on current collectors by high-temperature calcination and its post-phosphorization allows for a better mechanical adhesion of the catalyst to the substrate [27]. And also, the high-temperature calcination could avoid low purity of products because of the by-products of electrodeposition or hydrothermal synthesis, and low crystallinity due to their low formation temperature by hydrothermal synthesis [28]. Therefore, in this paper, a novel composite of network-like tungsten phosphide nanostructures on carbon fibers (CFs@WP) was prepared by a two-step high-temperature calcination strategy. During the preparation, a composite of network-like WSe2 nanostructures on carbon fibers (CFs@WSe2) was first synthesized in a tube furnace by the selenylation of WO3 powder on preoxidized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers; and then, the phosphorization was carried out to chemically convert the CFs@WSe2 into CFs@WP. The obtained CFs@WP composite, which can directly be used as an integrated hydrogen evolution cathode, exhibits much better electrocatalytic activity for HER than pure WP nano-/micro-particles (NMPs) after toasting their corresponding suspension onto bare CFs (NMPs/CFs) in acidic media. Furthermore, the as-prepared CFs@WP composite needs an over-potential of 137 and 215 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively. The present strategy may also offer a straight-forward model to enhance the HER activity of other TMPs composite catalysts by simultaneously constructing TMPs network-like nanostructures and introducing high conductive, cost-effective carbon substrate via high-temperature calcination to enhance the adhesion between the catalyst and substrate."
1,Experimental section,
2,Samples preparation,"2.1 Samples preparation Chemicals and materials. All the applied chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Among them, selenium powder, tungsten trioxide and sulphuric acid were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Red P and 10 wt% Pt/C were bought from Aladdin Industrial Corporation, China. Fabrication of CFs@WSe2 . The CFs@WSe2 composite was fabricated by a modified method as previously reported [28]. In a typical process, a bunch of PAN fibers (100 mg) was first rinsed in turn with de-ionized water and ethanol, and then dried under N2 flow at room temperature. Afterwards, the PAN fibers were soaked in a WO3 suspension (2 g of WO3 powder dispersed in 5 ml of ethanol) for 1 min, and then laid on a quartz plate for drying. After drying, the sample was moved into a double-temperature-zone vacuum tube furnace, settling at the heating center, while an alumina ceramic boat loaded with about 2 g of Se powder was located at 40 cm away from the sample in the upstream zone of the carrier gas. Before heating, the furnace was evacuated and flushed with argon gas (Ar, 99.99%) for several times. For the heating, the furnace was first heated up to 400 °C in 20 min and maintained at 400 °C for 10 min, then to 700 °C in 40 min and held at 700 °C for 60 min, and finally to 1075 °C in 40 min and soaked at 1075 °C for 60 min. After heating, the furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature. During the experiment, the Ar flow (200 sccm) was maintained throughout the whole process. The resultant dark-blue fiber-like products (denoted as CFs@WSe2 in this work) were then collected for the following experiment. Fabrication of CFs@WP. The as-obtained CFs@WSe2 precursor was first loaded into an alumina ceramic boat. Afterwards, the ceramic boat was located at the center of a microwave vacuum tube furnace, while a ceramic boat loaded with 1 g of red P was placed at 8 cm away from the CFs@WSe2 in the upstream of the carrier gas. The furnace was then purged with argon gas (Ar, 99.99%) for several times, and heated up to the optimized 1000 °C at a ramping rate of 40 °C·min−1, soaking at this temperature for 1 h. Finally, the furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature. Throughout the whole heating process, an Ar gas flow (140 sccm) was maintained. Finally, a bunch of dark-grey fiber-like products (denoted as CFs@WP composite) was collected. Fabrication of WP NMPs and CFs. For comparison, pure WP NMPs were synthesized through the same route for the synthesis of CFs@WP without using PAN fibers. Bare CFs were prepared by pyrolyzing PAN fibers alone under the same conditions for the preparation of CFs@WSe2."
3,Materials characterization,"2.2 Materials characterization The phase composition of the samples was identified by X-ray powder diffraction (GI-XRD, D/max-RB, Japan; Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 10–90° under a continuous scanning mode with a scanning rate of 6°/min at an incidence angle of 1° of the X-ray. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN, America) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). The composition of the samples was measured by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopes attached to the SEM and TEM, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB MKII, Thermo VG Scientific Ltd., America) was employed to investigate the chemical state of the elements, in which the results were calibrated by the binding energy of C 1s line (284.8 eV)."
4,Electrochemical measurements,"2.3 Electrochemical measurements Working electrodes preparation. The obtained CFs@WP composite was first cut into short-cuttings in a length of 2 cm, which were then horizontally connected by conducting adhesive tape on a copper foil in a width of 1 cm. The finally obtained electrode would contain the CFs@WP composite in a mass density of 4 mg·cm−2. During electrochemical measurement, the immersed part of the electrode in the electrolyte was in a geometry of 1 × 1 cm2. Besides, the electrode of bare CFs was also fabricated by this method. To prepare the electrode of WP NMPs, a suspension with a concentration of 39.25 mg·mL−1 was first prepared by dispersing the obtained WP NMPs into a mixture solution of isopropyl alcohol, ultrapure water and 5 wt% Nafion solution with a volumetric ratio of 30:70:2. Then, the WP NMPs suspension was repeatedly toasted onto CFs to prepare the electrode of WP NMPs (WP NMPs/CFs electrode). Also, the electrode of 10 wt% Pt/C was also fabricated by the same procedure. It should be noted that the electrodes of bare CFs, WP NMPs and 10 wt% Pt/C were prepared in the same size and mass density of the catalysts as done for the CFs@WP electrode. Electrochemical properties measurements. All the electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenghua Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a standard three-electrode system by using the above prepared electrodes as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolytes involve in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4, 1 mol·L−1 PBS and 1 mol·L−1 KOH. For all the measurements, the potentials are reported based on reversible hydrogen electrode (V vs. RHE) by converting the measured potentials (V vs. SCE) according to the following equation: (1) E RHE = E SCE + 0.241 + 0.059 × pH The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz with 5 mV sinusoidal perturbation across the working electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 2 mV·s−1 to obtain the polarization curves. Unless stated otherwise, the polarization curves measured in the three-electrode configuration in this study are iR-corrected as the following equation to avoid the influence of the Ohmic resistance on the catalysts [29,30]: (2) E corr = E mea - i R c where E corr is iR-corrected potential, E mea is experimentally measured potential, and R c is the compensating resistance measured by using the ZSimpWin software. Electrocatalytic ability evaluation. The onset over-potentials were determined based on the beginning value of the linear part in the Tafel plot, for which the iR compensation was applied. The current density (j) presented in this work was normalized with respect to the geometric surface area of the electrode. The acceleration degradation test for the HER was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 50 mV·s−1 in the range of −0.22 to 0.2 V vs. RHE for 1000 continuous cycles. The amount of the produced H2 gas was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC7900, Techcomp Holdings Ltd., China) and Labsolar-III AI photocatalytic system (Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd., China)."
5,Results and discussion,
6,Composition and microstructure,"3.1 Composition and microstructure The samples were first examined by XRD. Typical XRD pattern of the as-synthesized CFs@WP composite is shown in Fig. 1 a in comparison with those of WP NMPs and CFs. It is seen that no different diffraction peaks can be observed from the patterns of the CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs, and all the peaks of both samples can be indexed to those of orthorhombic WP phase (JCPDS No. 29-1364), implying that the W atoms in the CFs@WSe2 precursor were fully converted into phosphide. In addition, it should be noted that, a small hump around 26° can be identified from the pattern of the as-synthesized CFs@WP composite, which is similar with that of pure CFs prepared by heating PAN fibers alone at 1075 °C for 60 min. This hump should be assigned to the CFs in the CFs@WP composite transformed from the PAN fibers by high-temperature pyrolysis during the preparation of the CFs@WSe2 precursor. Typical SEM images of the obtained CFs@WP sample are displayed in Fig. 1b–d. The low-magnification one (Fig. 1b) shows that a large number of straight fiber-like products could be obtained by the proposed method. The high-magnification one as shown in Fig. 1c indicates that the diameter of the fibers is approximately 10 μm and numerous network-like stuffs are grown on the fibers. Typical SEM image of a fractured fiber prepared by ultrasonic oscillation in ethyl alcohol (see Fig. 1d) indicates that the as-synthesized CFs@WP fibers are characteristic of core–shell structure. Moreover, SEM-EDX analysis revealed that the shell was composed of W and P (see the inset of Fig. 1c) with an atomic ratio (W/P) of approximately 1:1, while the core consisted of pure carbon (see the inset of Fig. 1d), confirming that the sample was a CFs@WP composite. The absence of Se in the obtained CFs@WP composite reveals that after treatment by the proposed process, the W atoms in this sample are fully phosphorized, which is consistent with XRD and XPS data. In addition, it was measured that the diameter of the CFs core was about 7 μm and the thickness of WP shell coated on the CFs was about 2–3 μm (Fig. 1d). After comparing the obtained CFs@WP (Fig. 1b–d) with the original CFs@WSe2, it can be seen that the core–shell structure was maintained, and the specific network-like structure of WP was inherited from the original WSe2 during the high-temperature phosphorization, indicating that the designed phosphorization process could successfully convert WSe2 into WP without changing the established specific morphology. It is also worth noting that only WP NMPs could be obtained by the same route without the PAN fibers, indicating that the reducing gas produced by pyrolysis from the PAN fibers into CFs plays an important role in the formation of network-like WSe2 [31–33]. Therefore, the fabrication process of CFs@WSe2 with PAN according to Ref. [28] is the key to the anchoring of tungsten phosphide on the CFs in the present work. Furthermore, the TEM image and corresponding EDX elemental mapping of W and P (Fig. 1e) on a WP fragment scratched down from the CFs@WP composite reveal that the W and P atoms are uniformly distributed along the ligaments of the WP fragment. In addition, the HRTEM image (Fig. 1f) taken on the WP fragment shows a clear crystal lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.290 and 0.275 nm corresponding to the (0 1 1) and (1 1 1) plane of WP crystals, respectively. And all these results are also in agreement with the XRD observation."
7,Electrocatalytic performance for HER,"3.2 Electrocatalytic performance for HER The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the obtained CFs@WP composite was measured at room temperature in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4 using a typical three-electrode system. For comparison, those of the WP NMPs/ CFs, bare CFs, and commercially available Pt/C were also examined under the same conditions. The iR-corrected polarization curves of the CFs@WP composite, WP NMPs/CFs, bare CFs and Pt/C with a scan rate of 2 mV·s−1 are shown in Fig. 2 a. For a high-performance electrocatalyst, it is well known that achieving a high current density under a low over-potential is an important standard. Typically, a commercially available Pt/C electrocatalyst will present a high hydrogen evolution activity with a near zero over-potential, and bare CFs shows a negligible HER. In this study, the WP NMPs/CFs electrode exhibits an onset over-potential of 175 mV and needs an over-potential of about 274 and 413 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively. However, compared with the WP NMPs/CFs, the as-synthesized CFs@WP composite exhibits a significantly higher HER activity with an onset over-potential of 62 mV in the applied acidic media. Furthermore, the CFs@WP composite needs an over-potential of 137 and 215 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively. These over-potentials are comparable with those of most noble-metal-free HER catalysts reported under similar conditions of acidic media. The Tafel slope is another key parameter to reflect the hydrogen evolution performance of an electrocatalyst. A lower Tafel slope for an electrocatalyst indicates that for the same gain in current density it requires a smaller over-potential, implying a higher HER activity of the electrocatalyst. The Tafel slope could be determined by re-plotting the polarization curve into Tafel plot and fitting the linear part of the Tafel plot according to the following Tafel equation, (3) η = a + b × log j where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density [12,21]. Accordingly, the Tafel plots and Tafel slopes for the CFs@WP composite, WP NMPs/ CFs and commercially bought Pt/C are compared in Fig. 2b. The Tafel slope of the Pt/C is 31 mV·dec−1, which is consistent with the values reported in literature [5–7,21–30]. The as-prepared CFs@WP composite exhibits a comparable Tafel slope of 69 mV·dec−1 with Pt/C, both of which are much smaller than that of the WP NMPs/CFs (98 mV·dec−1). Furthermore, it is known that different Tafel slopes mean different mechanisms of HER; and the Tafel slopes for Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel processes are 116, 38 and 29 mV·dec−1, respectively. Thus it can be deduced that the HER over the present CFs@WP composite proceeds through a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with the Volmer process as the rate-determining step [34]. In addition, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the obtained CFs@WP composite was also examined in neutral and alkaline conditions. In 1 mol·L−1 PBS (neutral condition), the CFs@WP composite needs an over-potential of about 282 and 480 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of about 154 mV·dec−1. And in 1 mol·L−1 KOH (alkaline condition), the CFs@WP composite needs an over-potential of about 185 and 329 mV to afford a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of about 74 mV·dec−1. These results reveal that the as-prepared CFs@WP composite can exhibit certain degree of catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution in both conditions. And the HER in alkaline condition over the present CFs@WP composite proceeds through the same mechanism as it does in acidic condition, while it may carry through a Volmer process in neutral condition. Based on the above electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance tests, the experimentally measured amounts of H2 production were conducted to calculate the faradaic efficiency. The theoretically calculated and experimentally measured amounts of H2 production over the CFs@WP composite catalyst and the corresponding faradaic efficiency were compared. Our results indicate that the experimentally measured H2 production amount agrees well with the theoretically calculated value. In other word, the faradaic efficiency of such HER over the CFs@WP composite catalyst is nearly 100%. As for the relatively low faradaic efficiency at the beginning of the test, it might be caused by the dissolution of H2 into the solution during the induction period at the early stage. In order to elucidate the influential factors for the enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity of the CFs@WP composite, EIS measurements were first carried out. Fig. 2c displays the Nyquist plots of CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs/CFs which can be fitted by using an equivalent circuit model (see the inset in Fig. 2c). The model consists of an equivalent series resistance (Rs), and two parallel combinations of resistance and a constant phase element, corresponding to the charge transport process at the CFs/WP interface (Rsc-CPE1) and at the WP/electrolyte interface (Rct-CPE2), respectively. The radius of the arc in the Nyquist plot represents the polarization resistance of the electrode, and a small radius of the arc indicates a low resistance and fast electron transform process. The results shown in Fig. 2c reveal that the CFs@WP composite has a much smaller polarization resistance than that of WP NMPs/CFs, indicating a good conductivity and high electron transfer efficiency within the CFs@WP catalyst due to the intimate contact between the WP nanostructures and CFs (a current collector) after high temperature calcination [35]. Moreover, the electrochemical active surface area can be used as an approximate guide for surface roughness within an order-of-magnitude accuracy, which is proportional to the specific capacitance [34,36]. For the CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs/CFs, the double-layer capacitance value could reflect their electrochemical surface area [12]. In order to estimate the electrochemical active surface areas of the CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs, typical cyclic voltammograms of the CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs/CFs with various scan rates (10–200 mV·s−1) in the range of 0.2–0.4 V vs. RHE were recorded, in which the current response should be only due to the charging-discharging of the double layer [12]. And the fitted curves for the current density at 0.3 V vs. RHE against the scan rate are shown in Fig. 2d. From it, the capacitances of the CFs@WP composite and WP NMPs/CFs were calculated as 7.62 and 0.78 mF·cm−1, respectively, implying that the CFs@WP composite has a higher surface area and more catalytic active sites than the WP NMPs [37] as a result of the network-like structure of WP and the compositing between the WP nanostructures and CFs in it. In addition to the electrocatalytic activity, the stability (durability) of an electrocatalyst is another vital evaluation standard. In this study, the stability of the CFs@WP composite for repeating use was investigated in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4 as an example by continuous CV scan for 1000 cycles at a constant scan rate of 100 mV·s−1 between +0.28 and −0.27 V vs RHE (see Fig. 3 a). Comparing the first cycle with the last one, the loss in the current density for the present CFs@WP composite is almost negligible, indicating that the as-prepared CFs@WP is a stable HER electrocatalyst for repeating use. In order to investigate the long-term electrocatalytic stability of the CFs@WP, the continuous electrolysis test over the CFs@WP was performed at room temperature in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4 at a static over-potential of 137 and 185 mV for 24 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, at both over-potentials, the current density of the CFs@WP composite has a slight degradation during the first 3 h, and remains stable in the subsequent 21 h, indicating a high long-term electrocatalytic stability for the CFs@WP composite. Moreover, after a long-term durability test (continuously 24 h electrocatalysis), SEM imaging revealed that the morphology of the CFs@WP composite only had a slight change (see Fig. 3c), but XRD analysis indicated that its phase composition presented almost no change (see Fig. 3d). These results indicate a high stability for the present composite catalyst during the long-term test. As for the slight change in its morphology, it might be caused by the superficial oxidation as reported for similar catalysts in literature [11,12], which would lead to the decrease of the current density during the test in the first 3 h. In order to further confirm the superficial oxidation of the CFs@WP composite catalyst during the electrocatalysis, XPS analysis on the CFs@WP after continuously 24 h test was performed, and the results are displayed in Fig. 4 a–d. As can be seen from the survey spectrum (Fig. 4a), W, P and O atoms could be detected in the CFs@WP composite after continuously 24 h test. In the narrow spectrum of W (Fig. 4b), the decomposition of the spectra reveals two contributions in the form of doublets, W 4f7/2 (at about 32.1 and 36.6 eV) and W 4f5/2 (at about 34.3 and 38.6 eV). The relatively weak peaks located at around 32.1 and 34.3 eV can be ascribed to Wδ+ species (0 < δ ≤ 4) as previously reported [12] in relation with the tungsten species in the present WP phase [38,39]. And the peaks with a relatively high intensity located at around 36.6 and 38.6 eV could be assigned to W6+ species caused by the oxidation of the active W into WO3. In the narrow spectrum of P 2p (Fig. 4c), the two relatively weak peaks at around 129.7 and 130.8 eV should be attributed to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 in WP, respectively, while the relatively strong peak at about 134.3 eV corresponds to the binding energy of oxidized P species. There are two possible reasons for the oxidation of W and P. One is the oxidation caused by the exposure of the sample to air before XPS analysis [40], and another is the oxidation reaction occurring in the complicated process of electrocatalysis. In the narrow spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4d), the peak at about 532.3 eV should be assigned to –OH from adsorbed water on the surface of the sample, and the ones at about 533.5 and 535.6 eV should be assigned to the superficial oxidation of the active P and W, respectively [12,14,41]. Compared with the XPS data of the fresh CFs@WP composite and based on the above-mentioned XRD, SEM and XPS results of the CFs@WP composite after continuously 24 h electrocatalysis test, the superficial oxidation of the CFs@WP composite during HER could be confirmed, which would be responsible for the morphology change and degradation of current density of the CFs@WP composite during electrocatalysis, because the oxidized W and P species would block the charge diffusion channel, hinder the charge transfer during catalytic process and finally reduce the quantity of surface active sites of CFs@WP composite. As for why the current density decreases quickly in the first 3 h while it declines slowly after 3 h, it is probably because the morphology destruction and surface oxidation happen at the very surface, which will be soon finished after the first few hours of reaction. Thereafter, the catalytic activity of the sample will become stable."
8,Conclusions,"A novel CFs@WP composite was synthesized via two-step high-temperature calcination strategy, and the obtained composite exhibits much higher HER activity than WP NMPs/CFs. The CFs@WP composite catalyst could, in 0.5 mol·L−1 H2SO4, deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA·cm−2 respectively at the over-potential of merely 137 mV and 215 mV, and present a small Tafel slope of 69 mV·dec−1 as well as excellent stability at various current densities, although its HER activities in neutral and alkaline conditions might be relatively inferior. The enhancement of HER activity can be attributed to the high electrochemical active surface area of the catalyst originating from the WP nanostructures of network-like morphology and the improved conductivity due to the intimate contact after high temperature calcination between WP nanostructures and carbon fibers. The facile synthesis process can also provide a general strategy to enhance the HER activity of other TMPs composite catalyst by simultaneously constructing TMPs network-like nanostructures, and introducing high conductive and cost-effective carbon substrate via high-temperature calcination to enhance the adhesion between the catalyst and substrate."
