0,Introduction,"Sustainable and cost-effective approaches to recover renewable energy from waste streams have drawn considerable interest [1]. Hydrogen (H2) is considered a good alternative to traditional fossil fuels because it is clean burning, has a high energy density and is renewable [2]. Biohydrogen production from renewable wastewater, which integrates waste treatment with bioenergy recovery, is now given high priority in the development of advanced hydrogen-producing technologies [3,4]. As one of the most important contributors of biohydrogen production, fermentative hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) utilize high organic load wastewaters to effectively convert carbonhydrates into H2 and other liquid byproducts such as ethanol or small-molecular organic acids [5]. Compared to renewable hydrogen production by water electrolysis or phototrophic hydrogen production by algae and photosynthetic bacteria, fermentative hydrogen production has a higher energy recovery efficiency, a lower energy requirement, and is more flexible in practice [6]. However, due mainly to metabolic inhibition, hydrogen recovery efficiency of fermentative hydrogen production has a theoretical upper limit (only 33% of the biomass energy content) and actual values rarely exceed 2 mol H2/mol glucose, despite a stoichiometric potential of 12 mol H2/mol glucose [7]. The hydrogen yield of fermentation can be increased through the optimization of operational conditions to some extent. Researches have shown that controlling the fermentation pH at the optimum level has great importance for effective H2 production, which could dominate the fermentation type and sustain the growth of HPB and the activity of enzyme related to H2-metabolism [8,9]. The high constant pH (pH 10) was using to improve the sludge solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification processes and prevent the hydrogen consumption by methanogens and acetogens to enhance hydrogen production of butyric acid-type fermentation from waste activated sludge [10]. While the dynamic pH controlling strategy (continuous regulation of pH in order of 4.0, 5.5 and 4.0) could be used to maintain the stability of hydrogen production of ethanol-type acidogenic fermentation from fruit and vegetable waste [11]. Other operational parameters such as temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) could also affect the H2 production efficiency by influencing the community structure of H2-producing reactors and the metabolic activities of preponderant populations [9,12]. The H2 production of HPB are only vigorous in a narrow temperature range despite their ability to grow in a wide temperature range [13,14]. Supplement with suitable concentration of metal ions (such as Fe2+, Ni2+, Mg2+) can also improve the H2 production by regulating the activities of enzymes related to H2-metabolism [15]. However, it is still difficult to significantly improve the efficiency of energy conversion through the existing optimization methods of regulation operating parameters, since the rapid conversion of substrate into cell biomass and other organic sinks (such as butyrate, acetate, and ethanol) instead of H2 [9,16]. The accumulation of these small-molecular organic acids and alcohols can also lead to metabolic inhibition and further reduce the hydrogen yield [17,18]. Microbial interactions in various environments help participants to utilize resources efficiently and adapt to changing conditions [19,20]. The metabolic cooperation between interdependent microorganisms, termed “syntrophy” (as a cross-feeding process and interspecies H2 transfer), has both physiological and ecological significance [21,22]. One partner can degrade complex organic matter and produce metabolites (such as acetate, formate, and H2) that can then be consumed as carbon or energy sources by another partner with a high affinity for these metabolites [23]. To drive the overall cooperative metabolic process, microorganisms have developed associated chemical reactions and specialized biochemical mechanisms over a long-term evolutionary process [24]. Syntrophy is an essential strategy for maintaining stability in microbial communities and plays an irreplaceable role in matter and energy cycling, especially under anoxic conditions [25]. Fermentative HPB participate in syntrophy and play an intermediary role converting carbohydrates to volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, CO2, and H2. These metabolites released by fermentative HPB can further serve as electron donors or electron carriers for denitrifiers, iron and sulphate reducers, acetogens, and methanogens [26,27]. Therefore, fermentative HPB and syntrophs, as primary participants of metabolic syntrophy, are potentially important partners in syntrophic relationships under anoxic conditions [28]. Researches have proved that syntrophic interactions between HPB and acetic acid utilizing bacteria could alleviate the inhibition of acetic acid accumulation on hydrogen production, which contributes to the improvement of H2 production efficiency [27,29]. Thus, the regulation strategies based on microbial interactions provide new perspectives for the efficient energy conversion of fermentative hydrogen production, since the synergetic interaction among different microorganisms can realize more effective conversion from substrate to H2 and adapt to a wider range of conditions. Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs), such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), are electrochemical devices that oxidize organic matters catalysed by electroactive biofilms and produce electrical current or H2 and methane [30–33]. The electroactive bacteria and primary/secondary fermentative bacteria often coexist in the electrode biofilms in MECs [34,35]. Microbial community structure analysis showed that Geobacter and Clostridium were the dominant genera in the anodic and cathodic biofilms, respectively, of an alkali-pretreated sludge fed MECs [34,36]. The cross-feeding interaction between G. sulfurreducens and Cellulomonas uda in an MEC fed pretreated corn stover was shown to enhanced ethanol production [37]. Co-cultured MECs by the synergistic metabolisms of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Clostridium cellobioparum significantly enhanced ethanol production in glycerol fermentation [38]. Addition of an electron carrier (AH2QDS) to co-cultures of Clostridium beijerinckii and Geobacter metallireducens was shown to enhance hydrogen production through anaerobic fermentation [27]. Previous study has indicated that the mix-cultured two-chamber MECs could be used to augment hydrogen production from waste activated sludge (WAS) by cascade utilization of organic matter [39]. Therefore, a cascaded H2 production system coupling dark fermentation with MECs is a good strategy combining the advantages of fermentation and BES and can theoretically break the thermodynamic barriers of fermentation biohydrogen production to alleviate the metabolic inhibition, increase the substrate utilization and significantly improving hydrogen production efficiency. Ethanoligenens harbinense is a representative mesophilic ethanol–H2 co-producing species due to its unique characteristics, which include high inherent hydrogen production rate, ethanol-acetate fermentation, and its capability of forming large auto-aggregative or co-aggregative granules (2–10 mm) [8,40,41]. Ethanoligenens often dominates microbial communities in ethanol-type fermentation (i.e., ethanol-acetate fermentation of mixed culture), which is one of three types of acidogenesis typically found in anaerobic treatment systems [42,43], and is genetically distinct from other well-known HPB (such as the butyric acid bacterium-Clostridium) and has completely different metabolic characteristics [42]. Geobacter sulfurreducens, as an acetate-oxidizing, iron-reducing, and electroactive species, commonly occurs in various natural and engineered environments, and cannot oxidize glucose and ethanol [19,44–47]. H2 and acetic acid produced by E. harbinense strain YUAN-3 may be used as the electron donor or electron carrier for Geobacter species via a cross-feeding interaction. In the present study, co-culture MECs and anaerobic fermentation reactors inoculated with E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens were constructed to investigate the metabolic syntrophic interactions between ethanol fermentation HPB and electroactive bacteria, which aimed at exploring the effective approach to enhance the energy conversion and H2 production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microorganisms and growth media,"2.1 Microorganisms and growth media The hydrogen-producing bacterium E. harbinense YUAN-3 was obtained from the culture collection in our laboratory. Prior to use, E. harbinense YUAN-3 was cultured anaerobically using peptone/yeast extract/glucose (PYG) medium under a gaseous N2 atmosphere (ultrapure, 99.999%) at 35 °C as previously described [41]. G. sulfurreducens PCA, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 51573), was routinely cultured in basal growth medium (GM) containing 0.1 g/L KCl, 1.5 g/L NH4Cl, 0.6 g/L NaH2PO4, 2.5 g/L NaHCO3, 0.82 g/L CH3COONa, 8.0 g/L fumarate, 10 mL/L Wolfe’s vitamin mix, and 10 mL/L trace mineral mix [48]. Acetate was provided as the electron donor, and sodium fumarate as the electron acceptor. The medium was adjusted to pH 6.8 and flushed with N2/CO2 (80/20 [vol/vol]) gas in sealed bottles to remove oxygen before being sterilized by autoclaving."
3,MEC construction and operation,"2.2 MEC construction and operation Single-chamber MEC reactors were constructed using 250-mL anaerobic glass bottles (Wheaton Science Products, 219717, USA). Carbon paper was used for the anode (18 mm × 40 mm), while the cathode was made with activated carbon and steel mesh (18 mm × 40 mm) using the rolling process described in previous reports [49,50]. Each electrode was linked with a titanium wire (0.5 mm diameter) to connect the electrode to a programmable power supply (model FDPS-240A, Fudan Tianxin Ltd., China). The MEC reactors contained stir bars, which were rotated on a magnetic stirring plate at 80 rpm. The MEC reactors were divided into four groups (Table 1 ): E. harbinense YUAN-3 enriched-MEC (Eth-MEC), E. harbinense YUAN-3 enriched-open circuit-MEC (Eth-OCMEC), E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA co-cultured MEC (Eth + Geo-MEC), and E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA co-cultured open circuit-MEC (Eth + Geo-OCMEC). An anaerobic fermentation of E. harbinense YUAN-3 (Eth-AF) cultured in 250-mL anaerobic glass bottles, a G. sulfurreducens PCA enriched-MEC (Geo-MEC), and a E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA co-cultured MEC fed without fumarate (Eth + Geo-MEC-0) served as controls. Each group (experimental and controls) had three replicates. MEC reactors and Eth-AF were fed with G. sulfurreducens and E. harbinense co-culture (GE) medium containing 10.0 g/L glucose, 0.08 g/L sodium fumarate, 4.0 g/L peptone, 1.0 g/L yeast extract, 2.0 g/L beef extract, 4.0 g/L NaCl, 1.5 g/L K2HPO4, 0.1 g/L MgCl2·6H2O, 0.5 g/L L-cysteine, 0.1 g of KCl, 1.5 g of NH4Cl, 0.6 g of NaH2PO4, 2.0 g of NaHCO3, 10 mL/L Wolfe’s vitamin mix, and 10 mL/L trace mineral mix. Each MEC was filled with 150 mL of GE medium, then flushed with 100% N2 to remove oxygen. All reactors and Eth-AF were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min before inoculation. Two pre-cultured strains were respectively centrifuged for 5 min (12000 × g). Following centrifugation, equal weights of each single pellet was distributed to different reactors. The inoculated biomass (wet cell weight) of G. sulfurreducens PCA and E. harbinense YUAN-3 in each MEC reactor were 0.5 g/L and 1.0 g/L, respectively. To determine whether G. sulfurreducens PCA can utilize the metabolites produced by E. harbinense, an additional triplicate set of MECs inoculated with G. sulfurreducens were fed with the fermentation products of E. harbinense. The fermentation broth of E. harbinense strain YUAN-3 from 48 h after inoculation was collected from the anaerobic culture bottles. The pH value of the fermentation broth was 3.6, and the concentrations of ethanol and acetate were 6083 mg/L and 4350 mg/L, respectively. This broth was mixed with an equal volume of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0), the pH was adjusted to 7.0 (the concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid decreased to 3015 mg/L and 2031 mg/L, respectively), and then was used as the culture medium for G. sulfurreducens-inoculated MECs. To record real-time gas production, the gas tube on the top of each reactor was connected to a multi-channel respirometer (AER-208, Challenge Environmental Systems Inc., USA) and the produced gas was collected using a gas bag (0.1 L, DeLin, China). Before each experiment, the respirometer gas passages were flushed with filter-sterilized N2/CO2 (80/20 [vol/vol]) gas to remove residual gas from previous tests. The gas bags were cleared by sparging with filter-sterilized nitrogen, followed by gas removal using a sterile syringe. A fixed voltage (Eap) of 0.7 V was applied to the MECs and OCMECs. The resistance of the external resistor was 10 Ω, and the voltage across the resistor was recorded automatically every 10 min using a multi-channel data acquisition system (model 2700 with a 7702 module, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA). All MECs were operated in a temperature-controlled room at 35 °C."
4,Chemical analyses,"2.3 Chemical analyses Concentrations of H2 and CO2 were analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, with ultrapure N2 (MOX 99.99%) as the carrier gas. Measurement of VFAs and alcohols was carried out by using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column (DB-FFAP) with nitrogen as the carrier gas. Glucose concentrations were determined using the Glucose Detection Kit (Shanghai Rongsheng Biotech Co., Ltd., China). A pH meter meter (PHSe3C, Yangguang Lab. App. Co. Ltd., China) was used to determine pH. The hydrogen production rate (QH2, mL/L-medium·h) was calculated from the stable cumulative hydrogen production rate normalized to the liquid volume."
5,Calculations,"2.4 Calculations 2.4.1 Hydrogen production The hydrogen yield (YH2, mol-H2/mol-glucose) and glucose utilization ratio (%) were calculated as previously described [51,52]. YH2 was the molar value of hydrogen production normalized to the molar value of substrate consumption (mol H2/mol glucose). The coulombic efficiency (CE, %), cathodic H2 recovery (rcat, %), and overall hydrogen recovery (RH2 , %) was described in Eqs. (1)–(3): (1) C E = n CE n th (2) r Cat = n H 2 n CE (3) R H 2 = C E × r Cat = n H 2 n th Where n CE = ∫ t = 0 t I Δ t / 2 F , I (A) is the electric current generated in MECs, Δt (s) is the current sampling interval, the constant 2 represents every 2 mol e− converting into 1 mol H2 (2H+ + 2e− = H2), F is the Faraday’s constant (96,485C/mol e−); n th (mol) is the theoretical maximum hydrogen production which can be recovered from the substrates (for example, the n th of hexose is 12 mol-H2/mol-hexose and the n th of acetic acid is 4 mol-H2/mol- acetic acid. 2.4.2 Energy recovery The current density (A/m2) was calculated by current with the area of the cathode. The energy efficiency relative to the substrates (ηS, %), energy efficiency based on input electricity (ηE; %), and overall energy efficiency (ηE+S, %) were calculated in Eqs. (4)–(6), as previously described [6,53,54]: (4) η S = W H 2 W S (5) η E = W H 2 W E (6) η E + S = W H 2 W E+ S where W H2 = n H2 ΔHH2 (kJ), W H2 is the hydrogen energy in terms of calorific value, ΔHH2 (kJ/mol) is the heat of combustion of H2 (285.83 kJ/mol−1); W S = n S ΔHS (kJ), W S is the energy based on substrates in terms of calorific value, n S (mol) is the amount of consumed substrates, and ΔHS (kJ/mol) is heat of combustion of substrates (for example, the ΔHS of glucose is 2804 kJ/mol and the ΔHS of acetic acid is 874.3 kJ/mol); W E = ∑ i = 1 n ( I I E ap - I i 2 R ex ) Δ t (kJ), W E is the input electrical energy of MECs, E ap (V) is the applied voltage and R ex (Ω) is the external resistance. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was performed to detect statistical differences of gas production, hydrogen production rate, pH value, glucose comsuption, concentration of ethanol and acetic acid, YH2, CE, rcat, R H2, ηS, ηE, and ηE+S of different MECs and and anaerobic fermentation conducted with IBM SPSS statistics 24 (p < 0.05, n = 3)."
6,Morphological observation of biofilms by CLSM and SEM,"2.5 Morphological observation of biofilms by CLSM and SEM E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens co-cultured biofilms and E. harbinense auto-aggregative granules were frozen and cut into 10 μm sections and then placed on glass slides. The bacteria were stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and subsequently analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Olympus, FV1200, Japan) using a 60 × air objective (Analytik Jena AG, Germany) and excitation by an argon laser at 488 nm and 546 nm for SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI), respectively. Simulated three-dimensional images and sections of Z-stack scanning micrographs were generated using the IMARIS software package (Bitplane AG). At 130 h after inoculation, the morphologies of biofilms on the electrode surfaces of the MECs were examined to compare biofilms and visualize co-cultures using a scanning electron microscope (S-4800, HITACHI, Japan). The electrode samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide treatment. After each fixation step, the samples were dehydrated by applying different concentrations of ethanol in series, and then repeated with isoamyl acetate. The samples were dried using a critical point dryer (HCP-2, HITACHI, Japan) sputter coated with 10-nm Au/Pd using sputtering equipment (Eiko, IB-3; Japan), and examined using an SEM (S-4800, HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV [44]."
7,Multi-agent modelling analysis,"2.6 Multi-agent modelling analysis Multi-agent simulation (MAS) based on thermodynamics and kinetics [55] was used to predict the electron flow direction and assess the substrate conversion, energy transfer, and bacteria composition in co-culture MECs and anaerobic fermentation. The kinetics reactions equations (Table S1) and some statistical parameters (Table S2) were used to support the thermodynamics analysis. The simulation of dynamic change of reaction, reactant and products depended on the MAS algorithm were performed on the NetLogo platform [55]."
8,Results,
9,Syntrophic growth via cascade utilization of carbon sources,"3.1 Syntrophic growth via cascade utilization of carbon sources A cascade utilization of fermentation products experiment was designed to prove that G. sulfurreducens PCA can use the metabolic end products of E. harbinense YUAN-3. The current densities of Geobacter-inoculated MECs fed with fermentation broth of strain YUAN-3 (Geo-MEC) increased rapidly at 13 h after initial feeding and reached a stable plateau from 70 h to 150 h (Fig. 1 a). The current density reached an average maximum of 1.78 ± 0.16 A/m2, while the coulombic efficiency was 11.07 ± 1.20%. The concentration of acetic acid decreased over time, exhibiting a steep decrease during first 40 h, followed by a moderate decrease for the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 1b). These results demonstrated that G. sulfurreducens could use the metabolites produced by E. harbinense YUAN-3 as electron donors through a cross-feeding interaction."
10,Synthetic cross-feeding interactions enhanced hydrogen production,"3.2 Synthetic cross-feeding interactions enhanced hydrogen production Gas production in both the E. harbinense-enriched MEC (Eth-MEC) and its open-circuit control MEC (Eth-OCMEC) was similar to that obtained by anaerobic fermentation of E. harbinense (Eth-AF) (Fig. 2 ), suggesting that the MEC does not enhance gas production in mono-cultures of E. harbinense YUAN-3. In contrast, the gas production by the co-cultures of E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA was substantially enhanced, especially in hydrogen production. Furthermore, Eth-MEC, Eth-OCMEC, and the E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens-enriched open-circuit MEC (Eth + Geo-OCMEC) immediately produced gas after start-up and lasted about 130 h, while the E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens-enriched MEC (Eth + Geo-MEC) had the longest start-time (took about 15 h) and the earliest end-time of gas production among the reactors, indicating that the co-culture of E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA substantially shortened the duration of gas production (Fig. 2a). Total gas production in Eth + Geo-MEC was 5526.44 ± 254.65 mL/L-medium (Fig. 2b). Hydrogen production was highest in Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC, at 112.67 ± 1.30 mM/L-medium (2847.06 ± 32.87 mL/L-medium) and 86.74 ± 1.62 mM/L-medium (2191.99 ± 41.00 mL/L-medium), respectively. In comparison, mono-cultures of E. harbinense in anaerobic fermentation, OCMEC, and MEC produced 60.11 ± 0.08, 56.89 ± 0.30, and 57.13 ± 0.58 mM/L-medium of hydrogen, respectively (Fig. 2b). The maximum gas production rates of Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC reached 148.18 ± 10.81 and 145.38 ± 28.83 mL/L-medium·h, respectively (Fig. 2a). The maximum hydrogen production rates of Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC were 3.02 ± 0.21 mM/L-medium·h (76.30 ± 5.28 mL/L-medium·h) and 2.70 ± 0.17 mM/L-medium·h (68.19 ± 4.36 mL/L-medium·h), respectively, which were 2.9–2.5 times higher than those of Eth-MEC and Eth-OCMEC (1.05 ± 0.23 and 1.06 ± 0.18 mM/L-medium·h) (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, Eth + Geo-MEC produced more H2 in comparison to Eth + Geo-OCMEC (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 3), indicating that the extracellular electron transfer of G. sulfurreducens in the co-culture system contributed to hydrogen production via a cathodic electrochemical reaction. The hydrogen fraction of the produced gas in Eth + Geo-MEC (51.52%) and Eth + Geo-OCMEC (46.81%) were much higher than that of Eth-OCMEC (37.58%), suggesting that G. sulfurreducens influenced the metabolic activity of E. harbinense (Table 2 ). The hydrogen yield of Eth + Geo-MEC was 2.01 ± 0.01 mol-H2/mol-glucose; double that of of Eth-MEC (1.02 ± 0.16 mol-H2/mol-glucose) (Fig. 2d). These results demonstrated that co-culturing E. harbinense with G. sulfurreducens substantially improved hydrogen production, especially in a microbial electrochemical system."
11,Metabolic intermediates exchanged by cross-feeding interaction,"3.3 Metabolic intermediates exchanged by cross-feeding interaction The glucose substrate was nearly completely consumed in all reactors (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 3 a). The measured metabolic products of the MECs were acetic acid and ethanol. The final acetate concentrations in Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC were 13.26 ± 3.97 mM and 22.36 ± 0.85 mM, respectively, which were much lower than those of Eth-AF (35.73 ± 2.18 mM), Eth-MEC (37.80 ± 2.87 mM), and Eth-OCMEC (34.94 ± 0.59 mM) (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 3). The ethanol concentrations showed an obvious decrease in Eth + Geo-MEC (38.72 ± 3.37 mM), compared to Eth-MEC (58.24 ± 5.21 mM) and Eth-OCMEC (53.78 ± 1.26 mM), but there was no significant difference between Eth + Geo-OCMEC (44.32 ± 0.85 mM) and Eth-OCMEC (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05, n = 3–8) (Fig. 3b). The molar ratios of ethanol to acetic acid increased from 1.38 and 1.54 in mono-cultures to 2.92 in the co-cultured MEC, suggesting that the liquid end products of E. harbinense were steered by G. sulfurreducens. The decrease in acetate concentration in both co-cultures (MEC and OCMEC) was mostly due to acetate oxidation by G. sulfurreducens. The steady decrease in pH values was mainly due to the accumulation of acetic acid and tended to stabilize in the later stages of hydrogen production. The co-cultures of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens maintained higher pH values (1.02–1.11 fold increase) than the mono-cultures of E. harbinense during the hydrogen production period, and finally eventually stabilized at 5.52 ± 0.01 (Eth + Geo-OCMEC), and 5.52 ± 0.03 (Eth + Geo-MEC) (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05, n = 3) (Fig. 3c). These results indicated that co-cultures of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens could mitigate the metabolic feedback inhibition of acetate on E. harbinense and maintain a relatively higher pH value compared to the mono-culture (Eth-MEC, Eth-OCMEC and Eth-AF). In addition, the hydrogen reduction reaction on the cathode of the MEC might contribute to the increased of pH values. Moreover, Eth + Geo-MEC exhibited lower concentrations of intermediates than Eth + Geo-OCMEC, indicating that the electrochemical system could promote further consumption of acetate. The current density of Eth + Geo-MEC reached 2.03 ± 0.04 A/m2 at 28 h after inoculation, which was higher than that of Geo-MEC, and remained relatively stable for a minimum of 22 h and then suddenly dropped when gas production ceased (53 h after inoculation) (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the current density reached by Eth-MEC was much lower, with a maximum current density of 0.37 ± 0.08 A/m2. The co-cultured Eth + Geo-MEC had the highest H2 recovery (RH2) (16.93 ± 0.08%) with the highest cathodic H2 recovery (rcat) of 373.38 ± 13.93%, followed by Eth + Geo-OCMEC (13.03 ± 1.61%), and were much higher than those of the mono-cultures (8.55% − 9.03%) (Table 3 ). The coulombic efficiency (CE) of Eth + Geo-MEC was 30.89 ± 3.46%, which was much higher than those of Geo-MEC (11.07 ± 1.20%) and Eth-MEC (3.95 ± 0.60%). The energy efficiency relative to the substrates (ηS) of the co-cultured Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC were 20.70 ± 1.99% and 15.94 ± 1.59%, respectively, which means more substrates were recycled in hydrogen energy compared with the mono-cultures (10.46%−11.05%). These results indicated that primary contribution by G. sulfurreducens to current generation was made by using the acetate produced by E. harbinense. Co-culture of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens promoted the fermentative hydrogen production by converting more substrates into H2, while the MECs further enhanced the substrate conversion efficiency and converted electrical energy into hydrogen energy."
12,Visualization of the interactions of the synthetic consortia,"3.4 Visualization of the interactions of the synthetic consortia CLSM imaging revealed the three-dimensional construction of co-cultured consortia and mono-cultures of E. harbinense or G. sulfurreducens (Fig. 4 ). The section of auto-aggregative granules of mono-cultured E. harbinense was live and compact (Fig. 4a), while G. sulfurreducens formed bacterial flocs in the liquid medium (Fig. 4b). The co-cultures of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens formed active and dense granules containing a large proportion of active bacteria (Fig. 4c and d). G. sulfurreducens was abundant in the anode biofilm (reddish color), whereas E. harbinense YUAN-3 aggregated on the cathode and in the suspension (white color) (Fig. 5 a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the Eth + Geo-MEC electrodes showed that E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens PCA adhered to the surface of the cathode and anode (Fig. 5b–f). A large number of G. sulfurreducens cells adhered to the anode of Eth + Geo-MEC (Fig. 5b), and thick E. harbinense YUAN-3 biofilms covered the cathodes of Eth + Geo-MEC (Fig. 5c). G. sulfurreducens on the anodic surfaces transferred electrons to the electrode and led to the electricity generation of MECs. However, a large amount of YUAN-3 adhered to the cathode in co-cultured MECs. G. sulfurreducens PCA (length of 1–2 μm) could be distinguished easily from E. harbinense in SEM micrograph of the co-culture biofilm, since E. harbinense YUAN-3 has longer cell length (3.0–8.0 μm). Close physical connections by pili-like nanowires between E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens were observed in anodic and cathodic biofilms in co-cultured MECs (Fig. 5d–f), suggesting that direct interspecies electron transfer might occur within this dual-species syntrophic consortia."
13,MAS validation,"3.5 MAS validation The simulation results of glucose concentration and H2 production were closed to the experimental data (Fig. 6 a and b). Protons and electrons were constantly accumulated in MECs and anaerobic fermentation (Fig. 6c and d). A lot of surplus protons were predicted especially in Eth + Geo-MEC, which might be used for further H2 generation by changing the operating conditions, such as applied voltage, pH, and proportion inoculation. The comparisons of hydrogen production obtained from the experiment and MAS with different energy transfer coefficients (ε) and mass transfer coefficients (η) suggested that H2 production of Eth-AF was best-fit the simulation results under ε of 0.6 and η of 0.5 (Fig. 7 ). Eth + Geo-MEC had the highest energy transfer efficiency and mass transfer efficiency, followed by those of which Eth + Geo-OCMEC, and were much higher than those of Eth-AF. In addition, the relative abundance of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens predicted by MAS were 60.69% and 39.31% in Eth + Geo-MEC, respectively, and were 76.69% and 23.32% in Eth + Geo-OCMEC, respectively (Fig. S2)."
14,Discussion,
15,Cross-feeding interaction between the electroactive bacterium and the hydrogen-producing bacterium,"4.1 Cross-feeding interaction between the electroactive bacterium and the hydrogen-producing bacterium Syntrophic relationships exist extensively in both natural and engineered environments [24], which allow different kinds of organisms to obtain the required nutrients and energy in complex ecosystems by making full use of their unique metabolic capabilities [19]. Syntrophic microbes belong to diverse trophic groups, including primary or secondary fermentative bacteria, homoacetogenic bacteria, and hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic methanogens [24,56]. Interspecies H2 transfer, as the well-known strategy for indirect interspecies electron transfer, is the heart of syntrophy. H2 produced by fatty acid or ethanol-oxidizing syntrophs can be used by methanogens. Some iron-reducing bacteria have been identified as electroactive bacteria with a natural ability to carry out extracellular electron transfer to or from electrodes or iron oxides [57]. Recent studies showed that the interspecies interaction between the electroactive Geobacter metallireducens and the methanogenic Methanosarcina barkeri occurred via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) [58,59]. Interspecies electron transfer and cross-feeding interactions in co-cultures of Geobacter sulfurreducens and the ethanol-oxidizing Pelobacter carbinolicus was mediated by using H2 as a primary electron carrier [60]. Syntrophic cooperation can also occur between G. sulfurreducens and the hydrogen-utilizing exoelectrogenic Hydrogenophag sp. via interspecies H2 transfer, when G. sulfurreducens produces H2 without any dissolved electron acceptors [61]. However, the understanding of interspecies interactions between electroactive bacteria and primary fermentative bacteria is still superficial and incomplete and absent of direct evidence of how these participants interact with each other. This study demonstrated, for the first time, the cross-feeding interaction between fermentative hydrogen-producing E. harbinense and electroactive G. sulfurreducens in anaerobic fermentation and MECs (Fig. 8 ). E. harbinense converted glucose into ethanol, acetate, and CO2, and electrons generated in the glucose metabolism were used to reduce part of protons to H2 catalyzed by hydrogenase. The acetate and H2 could further served as the electron donor for G. sulfurreducens and the electrons generated in this process could be transferred to the electrode to form H2 at the cathode in MECs or might be transferred to E. harbinense by pili-like nanowires to generate H2. H2, as an electron donor or electron carrier, plays an important role in the microbial ecosystem in natural environments. However, due to metabolic obstacles and feedback inhibition, H2 production by fermentative bacteria is dependent upon H2-utilizing microbes and syntropies in the downstream food chain. Recent studies on metabolic inhibitions showed that metabolite concentration had a significant impact on the production of hydrogen and ethanol by E. harbinense [17,18]. Exogenous acetic acid and ethanol reduce the hydrogen production rate and influence metabolic flux in E. harbinense [17,18]. However, the metabolic products of fermentative HPB can be further used as carbon sources or electron donors for the growth of associated microbes [62]. The present study demonstrated that Geobacter species could interact with primary fermentative bacteria via a cross-feeding interaction, suggesting that this genus might play important and versatile roles in the microbial ecosystem. However, the effect of syntrophic interaction on the metabolic regulation of the individual associated microbes needs further investigation at transcriptome and proteome levels. The enhancement of hydrogen production by this co-culture system can be attributed to two primary causes. Firstly, G. sulfurreducens utilized acetic acid produced by E. harbinense, which alleviated the metabolic feedback inhibition of strain YUAN-3 and the reduced the pH drop in co-culture systems. The hydrogen yield in co-cultured open-circuit MECs (Eth + Geo-OCMEC) increased by 1.5 times compared with the mono-cultures. As a control, G. sulfurreducens couldn’t grow in the Geo-MEC that lacked H2 or acetic acid as the electron donor within 120 h. Secondly, the electrochemical system further enhanced hydrogen production in the co-culture system. The hydrogen yield of Eth + Geo-MEC was 1.3 times higher than that of Eth + Geo-OCMEC, and 2 times higher than the mono-cultures. Although G. sulfurreducens is a hydrogen-utilizing electroactive bacterium, it exhibited a higher hydrogen production rate than the nonhydrogen oxidizer Geobacter metallireducens in an MEC [44]. However, hydrogen production by synthetic bacterial consortiums in continuous-flow reactors under non-sterilizing conditions needs further investigation. In addition, fumarate is a well-known electron acceptor for G. sulfurreducens [63], the fumarate provided in GE medium of the MECs might compete with the electrode for electrons. However, in the co-cultured MEC fed without fumarate (data not shown), G. sulfurreducens didn't grow (MECs operated for 120 h) and no significant increase in current density of this co-cultured MEC was recorded. Thus, for rapid enrichment of G. sulfurreducens biofilm, the sodium fumarate (0.08 g/L) was added in GE medium as the electron acceptor for the early stage of co-culture. A sudden increase in current densities of co-cultured Eth + Geo-MEC was observed at 20 h after inoculation and remained stable over a period of 22 h, while the maximum current density of co-cultured Eth + Geo-MEC reached 2.03 ± 0.04 A/m2 which was much higher than that of Eth-MEC (0.37 ± 0.08 A/m2). This suggested that G. sulfurreducens was extracellularly transferring electrons to the anode in co-cultured MECs. Our results also showed that G. sulfurreducens in co-cultures with E. harbinense facilitated hydrogen production even in anaerobic fermentation. A previous study showed that H2 was the primary electron carrier of interspecies electron transfer between species in co-cultures with G. sulfurreducens [64]. The underlying mechanisms of interspecies H2 or electron transfer between E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens, or G. metallireducens remain unknown and should be assessed in the future. Since the pH value of ethanol-type fermentation in practical application was around 4.0–4.5 [8], the medium of MECs and anaerobic digestion (AD) system was not buffered or pH-regulated and the pH values were eventually stabilized around 4.99–5.52. The Eth + Geo-MEC and Eth + Geo-OCMEC have relatively higher pH value (5.52 at the end of the process) compared to the mono-cultures (Eth-MEC, Eth-OCMEC and Eth-AF), which was attributed to the mitigation of metabolic feedback inhibition on E. harbinense by co-culture. Although E. harbinense can tolerate a lower relatively pH (4.0–4.5) to produce hydrogen compared with other HPB, a higher pH (6.0–7.0) was proved to be more beneficial to its growth and ethanol-H2 co-metabolism [65]. Combining the advantages of ethanol-type fermentation and MECs, the co-cultured MECs reduced the metabolic inhibition and further significantly improved the hydrogen production efficiency by regulating the distribution of electron flow. The sustainable feedstocks, such as wastewater from various sources, activated sludge, food residues, and crop straw, can be used as the substrates for the co-cultured MECs. However, the complex substrates need to be pretreated by the physical or chemical pretreatments (such as pyrolysis, alkaline and acidic treatments, and ultrasonic treatment). In addition, the operating parameters of co-culture system (such as pH, temperature, applied voltage, substrate concentration, and inoculation proportion) need to be further investigated to improve hydrogen production capacity."
16,E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens exhibit close physical interactions,"4.2 E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens exhibit close physical interactions The partners in syntrophic cooperation are positioned in close proximity to each other via pili-like nanowires or flagellum, and form aggregates [23,66,67]. Geobacter spp. in co-cultures with partner microbes are capable of indirect or direct interspecies electron transfer through conductive pili [58,60,68,69], and sometimes form aggregates. E. harbinense YUAN-3 is capable of forming large granules via auto-aggregation and co-aggregation [42], while G. sulfurreducens aggregates in liquid medium but forms biofilms on the electrode surfaces of MECs. In our study, co-cultures of E. harbinense YUAN-3 and G. sulfurreducens formed multispecies aggregates due to the ability of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation of E. harbinense. These aggregates might provide a micro-environment to enable G. sulfurreducens to grow at low pH condition. In additon, aggregate formation of the co-cultures is important for direct cell-to-cell electron transfer [63,70]; thus, a strong auto-aggregation and co-aggregation may endow E. harbinense in co-culture with Geobacter with the opportunity to carry out direct interspecies electron transfer. However, E. harbinense YUAN-3 preferred to aggregate on the cathode in MECs due to a higher electrical potential. The pili-like nanowire structures responsible for cell-to-cell connections in syntrophic consortia were observed here between E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens (Fig. 5d–f). A recent study demonstrated that flagellum played an important role in the syntrophic interaction between Pelotomaculum (syntroph) and Methanothermobacter (methanogen) via FliD (the flagellar cap protein) [67]. Furthermore, pilA type IV and FliD coding genes are present in the genome of E. harbinense [42], which may participate in pili or flagellum-mediated interspecies interactions. This intercellular wiring may mediate interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic partners."
17,Enhancing fit-for-purpose metabolites by synthetic interaction,"4.3 Enhancing fit-for-purpose metabolites by synthetic interaction Co-culture provides an effective approach to mitigate feedback inhibition of metabolites and steer metabolic products of microorganisms. The construction of syntrophic consortia based on cross-feeding interactions or interspecies electron (H2) transfer provides new opportunities for enhancing the production of specific metabolites, which is more effective than optimization of operational conditions. A previous research study with the goal of ethanol recovery from lignocellulosic substrates in MECs investigated the synergistic interactions between G. sulfurreducens and the consolidated bioprocessing bacterium Cellulomonas uda, and showed that this interaction stimulated ethanol production and transfer of electrons from the fermentative by products into H2 in the cathode [37]. Our study suggests that hydrogen production can be significantly improved through synthetic interaction between HPB and electroactive bacteria, and to a greater extent than through optimization of ecological factors (such as pH, temperature, and other primary selective pressures). The overall H2 recovery (RH2) and energy efficiency (ηS and ηE+S) of co-cultures were significantly higher than the mono-cultures, while MEC system further promoted hydrogen production and energy conversion (Table 3). It is precisely because of the cross-feeding interaction between fermentative E. harbinense and electroactive G. sulfurreducens that the co-cultured MEC alleviated the metabolic inhibition of HPB to enhance hydrogen production and had the capacity to exploit complex organic matters. Different inoculation ratios of HPB and electroactive bacteria can be further studied for optimal hydrogen and electricity production performances. Cross-feeding interaction in a defined co-culture steered the composition of the liquid end product distribution by fermentative ethanol and H2 co-producing bacteria, which could contribute to the conversion of by-products into reusable products or resources. The proportion of ethanol-acetic acid in fermentation products was significantly changed in the co-cultures of E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens compared to mono-species of E. harbinense. The ethanol proportion in co-cultures increased by 17% compared to the mono-cultures, and the increase was more prominent (34%) in co-cultured MECs. In the next steps, ethanol can be recovered by pervaporation or further utilized in, for example, methanogenesis, microbial dechlorination [71] or medium- or long-chain fatty acid synthesis [72]. The metabolic profiles can be significantly changed through bacterial interactions that can achieve specific product recovery without complex biosynthetic processes. This study provided a new approach for the enhancement of hydrogen production and can be broadly generalized by using different species for the co-culture systems. Comparing different syntrophic partners, syntrophic consortia of E. harbinense with ethanol-oxidizing bacteria (such as Pelobacter carbinolicus and G. metallireducens) capable of converting ethanol to acetic acid should be further studied. Future research will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of interspecies electron transfer and interspecies metabolic cooperation by co-culture approaches in the presence of minerals or conductive materials. For more general applications, multi-species synthetic consortia should be constructed by incorporating aerobic bacteria to achieve higher production of fit-for-purpose (suitable for different purpose) metabolites under aerobic conditions."
18,Conclusions,"Interspecies syntrophic interactions between the fermentative hydrogen-producing Ethanoligenens harbinense and the electroactive Geobacter sulfurreducens were demonstrated in co-cultured MECs and anaerobic fermentation. G. sulfurreducens utilized the fermentation metabolites of E. harbinense and transferred electrons extracellularly, which enhanced hydrogen production of E. harbinense by mitigating metabolic feedback inhibition and boosting interspecies electron transfer. The electrochemical reaction further enhanced hydrogen production of co-cultured MECs. The proportion of ethanol in defined co-culture greatly increased compared to mono-cultures, suggesting that the concentration of metabolic products of E. harbinense could be directly regulated through the interaction with G. sulfurreducens. The co-cultures formed dense aggregates or active biofilms with intercellular pili-like nanowire structures between E. harbinense and G. sulfurreducens, which might mediate interspecies electron transfer. The results provide new perspectives on syntrophic cooperation between the fermentative HPB and the electroactive bacteria, and offer an effective strategy to steer metabolic products of fermentative bacteria."
