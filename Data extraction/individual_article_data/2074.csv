0,Introduction,"Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that plays an important role in the folding, maturation, stability, and maintenance of substrate proteins, referred to as “client” proteins. Many client proteins are considered oncogenic proteins and are involved in multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell growth, migration, and survival [1]. These client proteins include numerous kinases (Her2, EGFR, Met, Akt, Raf, and Cdk4), receptors (androgen and estrogen receptors), and transcription factors (c-Myc and Hif1α) [2]. Therefore, inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone leads to a simultaneous blockage of multiple signaling pathways in the proliferation and survival of cancers. Under hostile environments in cancers such as hypoxia, acidosis, and nutrition deprivation, Hsp90 is generally overexpressed in cancer cells 2–10-fold higher than in normal cells, and cancer cells are highly dependent on the Hsp90 chaperone function for proliferation and survival [2–4]. Thus, Hsp90 represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of various types of cancer. Over the past decades, a plethora of Hsp90 inhibitors with diverse structural backbones has been developed [4–10]. However, to date, none of these inhibitors have been approved for clinical use. Clinical trials of multiple Hsp90 inhibitors have been unsuccessful, mostly due to minimal clinical efficacy and toxicity [11–13]. Some of these toxicities, such as liver, cardiac, and retinal toxicity, are unacceptable drawbacks, which should ultimately be overcome to move forward. Prodrugs are a class of therapeutics that undergo chemical or enzymatic transformation in vivo to release active parent drugs, eliciting their desired pharmacological effects while minimizing side effects. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is frequently observed in cancer cells compared to normal cells. For example, tumor cells from approximately 60% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibit elevated ROS, and in some cases, 100-fold elevation is observed [14–16]. ROS include various forms of chemically reactive molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals. Hydrogen peroxide has chemical stability essential for maintaining steady-state concentrations in vivo, compared to other short-lived ROS, making hydrogen peroxide an ideal choice for developing ROS-activated prodrugs. In 2004, Chang et al. first reported hydrogen peroxide-activated fluorescence probes for detecting endogenous hydrogen peroxide production in living cells [17]. Since then, a number of studies have been carried out to provide a multifaceted prodrug strategy using elevated hydrogen peroxide production in cancer cells [18–22]. As part of our ongoing efforts to develop efficacious Hsp90 inhibitors, we previously discovered a highly potent Hsp90 inhibitor, 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-N-methyl-N-(4-(propylcarbamoyl)benzyl)-benzamide (BZide, 1) through structure-based drug design [7,8,23]. To reduce undesirable toxic effects of Hsp90 inhibitor, we aim to develop a novel hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor by incorporating a hydrogen peroxide-cleavable moiety. We suppose that this hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor would selectively inhibit cancer cell growth without affecting normal cells by taking advantage of elevated hydrogen peroxide levels in cancer cells. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor."
1,Results and discussion,
2,Drug design,"2.1 Drug design The molecular docking pose of BZide (1) in human Hsp90α (PDB code: 2XJX) indicates that BZide tightly occupies a deep ATP-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90α (Fig. 1 A).[24] The isopropyl group of BZide projects into the hydrophobic region composed of lipophilic side chains of Phe138, Leu107, and Val150 and forms proximal Van der Waals interactions with these residues, while the N-propyl amide group forms two hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxylic acid of Asp102 and the amide side chain of Asn106. More importantly, the resorcinol ring and its adjacent carbonyl group of BZide (1) forms a critical hydrogen bonding network with the carboxylic acid side of Asp93, the hydroxyl side chain of Thr184, and conserved water molecules trapped at the bottom of the pocket. Benefiting from the docking model of BZide in Hsp90α, we rationally designed a hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor, Boro-BZide (Fig. 1B). We assumed that modifying the hydroxyl group at C-4 of the resorcinol ring with a benzylboronate ester group could significantly decrease the binding affinity of BZide to Hsp90, as the reaction of the conjugated boronate ester with hydrogen peroxide releases the active BZide from the inactive Boro-BZide. Mounting evidence that many types of cancer cells produce more abundant levels of ROS than their normal counterparts strongly supports a biochemical rationale for the selective targeting of cancer cells over normal cells [14–16]."
3,Chemistry,"2.2 Chemistry BZide (1) was first synthesized following a previously reported procedure.[8] With BZide (1) in hand, we successfully coupled BZide (1) with compound 2 in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetonitrile to provide a 34% yield of Boro-BZide (3) (Scheme 1 )."
4,Binding affinity of BZide and Boro-BZide to Hsp90α,"2.3 Binding affinity of BZide and Boro-BZide to Hsp90α As we envisioned that Boro-BZide could confer partial or total loss of binding affinity to Hsp90α, we next examined the binding affinity of BZide and Boro-BZide to human Hsp90α using a fluorescence polarization (FP) competition assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled geldanamycin as a fluorescence probe [25]. Geldanamycin is a first small molecule inhibitor binding to N-terminus ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 with nanomolar binding affinity [26]. FP assay is a powerful tool for measuring protein–ligand association based on change in polarization of emitted light upon excitation of a fluorescent molecule with plane-polarized light [27,28]. As shown in Fig. 2 , the data indicated that BZide afforded a strong binding affinity (IC50 = 10.1 nM) to Hsp90α, while Boro-BZide (IC50 > 10 μM) was unable to bind to Hsp90α. It was apparent that attaching the benzylboronate ester moiety to the hydroxyl group of BZide resulted in a total loss of binding affinity to Hsp90α."
5,Boro-BZide induces anti-proliferative effects in MCF-7 cells (carcinoma) compared to MCF-10A cells (normal),"2.4 Boro-BZide induces anti-proliferative effects in MCF-7 cells (carcinoma) compared to MCF-10A cells (normal) We next investigated the effect of BZide and Boro-BZide on the viability of human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and normal human breast cell line MCF-10A (Fig. 3 ). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that cancer cells produce elevated levels of ROS, compared with normal cells, and cancer cells utilize ROS to endogenously activate cell proliferation and angiogenic signaling cascades [29]. We first measured the anti-proliferative effect of BZide and boro-BZide against the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 [28]. As expected, BZide exhibited very potent anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 cells with a GI50 value of 1.95 μM, while Boro-BZide displayed anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 cells with a GI50 value of 7.63 μM. Surprisingly, Boro-BZide (LC50 = 31.1 μM) was much less toxic to the normal human breast cell line MCF-10A than the cancer cell line MCF-7. In contrast, BZide exerted substantial toxicity on MCF-10A cells with an LC50 value of 1.29. The therapeutic index (TI) refers to a range of doses that achieve the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable toxicity and is widely used to measure the relative safety of drugs. As shown in Table 1 , the therapeutic index of Boro-BZide (TI = 4.8) was much higher than that of BZide (TI = 0.66), indicating that Boro-BZide was significantly less prone to generate adverse toxic effects than BZide."
6,"Boro-BZide induce degradation of Hsp90 client proteins in MCF-7, but not MCF-10A cells","2.5 Boro-BZide induce degradation of Hsp90 client proteins in MCF-7, but not MCF-10A cells We next investigated the precise mechanism of action of BZide and Boro-BZide on MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were incubated with 1 μM BZide or Boro-BZide for 24 h, and the expression levels of Her2, EGFR, Met, Hsp70, Hsp90, and β-actin were analyzed by western blotting (Fig. 4 ). Hsp90 is responsible for maintaining the stability of Her2, EGFR, and Met. Hence, inhibition of Hsp90 downregulates these client proteins via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and upregulates Hsp70 and Hsp90 through HSF-1-mediated positive feedback mechanisms [30]. Western blot analysis demonstrated that BZide and Boro-BZide effectively inhibited the chaperone function of Hsp90, leading to the degradation of Her2, EGFR, and Met in the MCF-7 cell line, while both BZide and Boro-BZide promoted the upregulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90. In contrast to the results for MCF-7 cells, Boro-BZide was not capable of inhibiting Hsp90 function in MCF-10A cells, in that the expression levels of Her2, EGFR, Met, Hsp70, and Hsp90 remained unchanged. Unlike Boro-BZide, BZide efficiently inhibited the chaperone function of Hsp90 in MCF-10A cells, resulting in the downregulation of Her2, EGFR, and Met, as well as the upregulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Overall, the results clearly indicated that Boro-BZide selectively targeted Hsp90 protein in cancer cells over its normal counterpart."
7,Oxidative activation converts Boro-BZide to BZide,"2.6 Oxidative activation converts Boro-BZide to BZide To provide further insight into the reactivity of Boro-BZide with hydrogen peroxide, we examined the reactivity of Boro-BZide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a reverse-phase C18 column (Fig. 5 A). In the absence of hydrogen peroxide, no conversion of Boro-BZide to BZide was observed even after incubation for 9 h, indicating that Boro-BZide was stable in aqueous PBS solution (100 mM, pH 7.4). Similar results were obtained with 0.01 or 0.1 M equivalents of hydrogen peroxide treatment (blue or green chromatogram). Oxidative cleavage of Boro-BZide began to occur when it was treated with an equal molar amount of hydrogen peroxide (red chromatogram) and 93% cleavage of Boro-BZide to BZide was achieved with 10 M equivalents of hydrogen peroxide (orange chromatogram). The HPLC chromatogram of BZide alone was used as a reference (yellow). The proposed mechanism of H2O2-mediated activation of Boro-BZide into BZides is illustrated in Fig. 5B. The benzylboronate ester moiety of Boro-BZide reacts with hydrogen peroxide, hydrolyzes in aqueous media, and releases the active Hsp90 inhibitor BZide along with a side product, quinone methide, which is then rapidly trapped by water to give 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol."
8,Generation of ROS in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells,"2.7 Generation of ROS in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells Compared with their normal counterparts, cancer cells are known to exhibit elevated intrinsic oxidative stress and, therefore, have increased levels of ROS. To compare the intracellular ROS levels of MCF7 cells with MCF10A cells in parallel, we assessed ROS production in MCF7 and MCF10A cells using the ROS-sensitive fluorescence dye DCF-DA, which is a non-fluorescent compound and later oxidized by ROS to generate highly fluorescent dye DCF. MCF7 and MCF10A cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated with the DCF-DA fluorescence dye. As shown in Fig. 6 , we observed a significantly higher level of ROS production in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells than their normal counterpart, MCF10A cells, indicating that Boro-BZide was more readily converted to the active BZide in MCF7 cells than in MCF10A cells, and conferred selective targeting of the Hsp90 chaperone function in cancer cells over normal cells."
9,Conclusions,"In the last decade, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in various cancers. Although numerous structurally diverse Hsp90 inhibitors have been developed, none of these inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, mostly due to toxicity, including liver, cardiac, and retinal toxicity. To overcome this unacceptable toxicity, we rationally designed a hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor by chemical modification of the resorcinol ring with boronic acid pinacol ester, which temporally deactivates its parent Hsp90 inhibitor and releases an active Hsp90 inhibitor selectively in cancer cells. Biological evaluation indicated that BZide afforded a strong binding affinity to Hsp90α with an IC50 value of 10.1 nM, while Boro-BZide was incapable of binding to Hsp90α. However, Boro-BZide exhibited good anti-proliferative activity against MCF7 human breast cancer cells, but not against MCF-10A normal human breast cells, suggesting that Boro-BZide is less likely to generate toxicity than its parent inhibitor, BZide. A series of experiments, including western blotting, HPLC analysis, and FACS measurement, confirmed that hydrogen peroxide activated Boro-BZide to selectively release BZide in cancer cells. The results suggest that Boro-BZide provided an enhanced therapeutic index of cancer cells to normal cells, compared with its parent Hsp90 inhibitor, BZide. The merit of our research is the development of a hydrogen peroxide-activated Hsp90 inhibitor for the first time, which presented a novel prodrug strategy to reduce adverse toxic effect of Hsp90 inhibitor. Taken together, we believe that the application of an ROS-triggered prodrug strategy will be beneficial in overcoming the toxicity hurdles of Hsp90 inhibitors."

The intracellular levels of ROS were detected by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry (BD FACSVerse™ Cell analyzer, BD Bioscience, USA) and BD CellQuest™ Pro software using FL1 channel for fluorescein. A minimum of 10,000 events was counted per sample. The values were expressed as the mean absorbance normalized to the percentage of the control value. 4.2.6 HPLC analysis To determine whether the cleavage of prodrug is related to generation of ROS, Boro-BZide prodrug was treated with H2O2 (0, 5, 50, 500, or 5000 μM) for 9 h and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Shimadzu, Japan). HPLC analysis was carried out at a flow rate of 1 mL/min under 254 nm wavelength detection, with a linear gradient elution using the mobile phase A (distilled water with 0.1% TFA) and the mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA) from 0% B to 100% B in 30 min. 4.2.7 Fluorescence polarization assay All fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments were conducted in 96-well, black, round-bottom plates using a micro plate reader.
