0,Introduction,"Economically and ecologically efficient techniques for hydrogen production are a prerequisite for the introduction of H2-based energy technologies. However, at present H2 is mainly produced by steam reforming (SR)/partial oxidation of fossil fuels. In the framework of sustainability there is a push to switch to renewable sources and/or waste raw materials. Several new alternative processes were proposed, starting from renewable energy sources and/or renewable raw materials, namely water photo-splitting [1] and photo-reforming [2,3], water electrolysis [4,5] using electricity coming from renewable sources (wind, solar, etc.). However, even if all these methods are completely sustainable and environmentally friendly, they are often far from a realistic application at least in a short/medium timescale. Reforming processes, being ones of the well established and diffused current technology for hydrogen production, but starting from fossil raw materials, are very interesting since there is the real possibility for a switch from fossil to renewable raw materials [6–8]. Actually SR of natural gas (NG) accounts for around 85% of the total hydrogen produced, other 15% relies mainly on electrolysis processes. Several other processes were proposed, namely short contact time (SCT) catalytic partial oxidation (CPO); Autothermal/oxidative steam reforming (ATR/OSR); aqueous phase reforming (APR); hydrocarbons decomposition to C and H2 (HDC); water photo-splitting (WPS) and photo-reforming (PR) (see Scheme 1 ). However only SCT-CPO is at the stage of pilot-plants, whereas ATR is mostly applied for large scale GTL applications and methanol synthesis [9], and APR industrial applications are more devoted to the production of liquid fuels than of hydrogen [10]. Other reactions like HDC, WPS, and PR are very far from any application as industrial processes. Actually a number of drawbacks can be associated with these processes, mainly reforming and CPO ones, depending on reaction conditions, feed, etc., some of them are: (i) low stability due to carbon/coke deposition; (ii) sintering of metal (active) phase; (iii) oxidation of metal (active) phase; (iv) poor selectivity towards desired products (H2 and CO2 if the hydrogen production is the goal or H2 and CO if the goal is the syngas); (v) poisoning due to sulfur compounds (especially when the heavy hydrocarbons or bio-gas are fed). Among several possible solutions the use of bi or poly-metallic systems is one of the more promising possibilities since it allows to obtain stable and optimal catalytic performances, at least in principle, simply using an appropriate catalytic material. Bimetallic, or, in some cases, even polymetallic heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., catalysts based on nanoparticles, composed of more than one metal, supported mainly on oxides) are widely employed in many fields of catalysis, due to the positive effects arising from the cooperative interactions between the (two) metals. Namely bimetallic catalysts found applications in CO hydrogenation [11], selective hydrogenations [12–14], Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [15,16], oxidative reactions [17], CO selective oxidation [18], and, obviously, to the above mentioned hydrogen production reactions. Bimetallic catalysts can show different structures according to metals properties, metal(s) support interactions, atmosphere (oxidant, reductive, presence of water, etc.) temperature, etc. The structure of bimetallic nanoparticles can range from bimetallic hetero-structures, to core–shell (cherry) structures, (nano)alloys, intermetallic, etc., (from the less to the most interacting metals) as shown in Fig. 1 . Wang and Li proposed a classification based on three main types of structures: core–shell, heterostructure, or intermetallic and alloyed structures [19]. Guzci [15], on the other hand, reported on a bit more complex classification, based on the magnitude and sign of enthalpy changes (ΔS): when ΔS ∼0 ideal solutions are obtained (pure alloy); when ΔS small and <0 solution if difference in atomic radii is negligible; when ΔS large and <0 intermetallic compounds are obtained; when ΔS small and >0 mono- or bi-phasic alloys are formed; when ΔS large and >0 surface alloying or clusters formation occurs. Principal effects resulting from interactions between two (or more) metals (hereinafter indicated as M(n) where n =1,2,3,…; and M(1) being the main component) in a bimetallic structure can be divided in surface and structural phenomena. As surface effects regards, they are usually divided in geometric and electronic effects. Geometric effect is the result of surface M(1) atoms dilution by M(2), in other words M(1) surface ensembles are reduced in size. The effect on catalytic performances can be dramatic since many reactions are catalyzed by a threshold number of surface atoms organized in an ensemble; for instance, polymerization (inducing coke formation) reactions are typical reactions occurring only on a certain ensemble. Electronic effect results from the difference in electronic affinity between M(1) and M(2), and thus M(1) can suffer an electronic density increase or a decrease depending on whether M(2) has a lower or higher electronic affinity. In this case phenomena such as adsorption/desorption of reagents/reaction intermediates/products can be strongly affected and consequently activity and selectivity. Apart from the above mentioned structural/morphological effects other important positive effects arising from the addiction of one (or also more than one) metal(s) to another, can be outlined as: i. improvement of coke resistance by reducing the size of metallic NPs, thus lowering the C solubility, as in the case of Ni-based catalysts [20–23] by the above mentioned geometric effects; and by the high activity in C gasification showed by noble metals (see Refs. [24] and [25] for instance); ii. improvement of thermal stability of the active metal(s) (i.e., limiting of the sintering) by increasing its dispersion and/or interaction with support material. The exact origin of the observed behavior is still not clear, in silica supported Au–Ag core–shell bimetallic NPs [26] the exceptional thermal resistance was attributed to the formation of a surface Ag oxide layer that enhances the interaction with silica support. A similar effect was found also in Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts [27]. It is worth to mention how the thermal stability (and also poisoning resistance) can be improved, in monometallic systems, by other approaches, like for instance the embedding of active phase [28] or other ad-hoc preparation procedures, like multistep OM-CVD [29]; iii. improvement of poisoning resistance, especially to sulfur compounds, is mainly due to the ability in sulfur oxidation of the added metal (very often noble metals), as reported for example for Rh–Ni systems [30,31]. Here we will report on the application of heterogeneous catalysts, based on supported bimetallic nanoparticles, to the reactions suitable for hydrogen production starting from both fossil and renewable raw materials. Among the reactions, the focus will be put on the more “traditional” ones like SR, (SCT)-CPO, and ATR/OSR, but also to the more recent ones: APR, HDC, WGS, and PR. As raw materials concerns, methane, NG, fuels (Jet fuel, gasoline, diesel), bio-gas, (bio)-methanol, -ethanol, -butanol, -glycerol, and bio-oil will be described due to their actual importance (i.e., SR of methane accounts for 85% of H2 produced worldwide) and also for their potential as alternative renewable resources. The main guideline of this review will be to show the advantages derived from the application of bimetallic systems vs. monometallic ones, focusing also on the characterization of structural properties and on the correlation between structure and catalytic properties highlighting the main effect(s) of the promoter addition."
1,Reforming reactions,"The term “Reforming reactions” is used here with its broadest significance, i.e. including SR, Auto-Thermal Reforming or Oxidative SR, Aqueous Phase Reforming, Dry Reforming, and Oxidative Dry Reforming."
2,"SR, ATR/OSR","2.1 SR, ATR/OSR SR reaction is an energy intensive process in which water reacts with a substrate in the vapor phase, as follows: (1) C n H m O p +(2n − p)H2O= nCO2 +(m/2+2n − p)H2 (2) C n H m O p +(n − p)H2O= nCO+(m/2+ n − p)H2 (3) CO+H2O=CO2 +H2 Reaction (1) represents the overall SR process and is highly endothermic, usually occurs at a temperature range between 873K and 1173K, depending on the substrate, and can be considered the combination of Reactions (2) and (3). Reaction (2) leads to the production of syn gas, while Reaction (3) is the exothermic water gas shift (WGS) reaction that is very important to regulate the CO amount and to increase the H2 yield. Among the different technologies for hydrogen production by reforming (CPO, ATR/OSR and SR), SR shows the highest hydrogen production efficiency. Up to now, the most widely employed feed is methane (i.e. NG), even if higher hydrocarbons, or mixture of them, such as gasoline and diesel [32], are used too. In the view of a sustainable production of hydrogen, the study of renewable feedstock for SR, in particular bio-alcohols, such as glycerol, ethanol, and methanol, is considered very promising at the moment. Due to the severe condition of the reaction, many different pathways can lead to by-products, mainly CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and coke, that decrease the yield to hydrogen and compromise the performances of the catalyst. In order to activate the substrate and promote C–C and C–H cleavage the presence of a metal is necessary. Ni based catalysts, being cheap and active, are the most studied systems, even if several metals are promising too. Among non noble metals, Co based systems shows good performances too, while Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd are the most active noble metals [33]. In order to overcome the high endothermicity of SR, an alternative solution is to co-feed oxygen to exploit the thermal energy produced through some complete oxidation without the need of an external source of heat, despite the decrease in H2 productivity. This process is called ATR or OSR [34,35]. The overall reaction can be summarized as follow: (4) C n H m O p +(2n − p −2)H2O+O2 = nCO2 +(m/2+2n −p−2)H2 Apart from oxidation reactions that occur during the process, the general features of ATR are substantially similar to the ones of the SR process. The coke deposition is one of the most important causes of deactivation of catalytic systems during SR. Thinking that at the industrial level the catalysts life-time for SR technology is of the years order [36], one of the main feature for a catalyst to be applied in SR is the resistance to coking. Coke can derive from the polymerization of C containing species (for example atomic carbon or olephines) and it is usually promoted by acid sites on the surface of the catalyst as well as by the metallic nanoparticles. During methane SR, methane can dissociate and leave atomic carbon on the metallic surface that can form carbide, dissolve into the metal and, as in the case of Ni and Co, eventually start to produce whisker carbon [37]. Whisker carbon is not directly responsible for catalyst deactivation but can cause an increase in reactor pressure drop that compromises its performances. On metals such as Rh and Ru, the mechanism is different because the ability to dissolve C is less pronounced than for Ni. Another more troublesome kind of coke is the one that encapsulates the metallic nanoparticles rendering them completely inactive. Beside polymerization of reactive carbon containing species, the main reactions that lead to coke formation are the following: (5) 2CO=CO2 +C (6) CO+3H2 =CH4 +H2O (7) CH4 =C+H2 (8) CO+H2 =C+H2O (9) C m H n O p =(m − p)C+ pCO+ n/2H2 One way to avoid this phenomenon is to add a second metal to the active one. It is well known that coke deposition needs a defined number of surface metallic atoms to proceed. Big Ni NPs favors carbide formation and dissolution. Rostrup-Nielsen suggested that 6–7 nickel atoms ensembles are involved in coke deposition, while smaller ones are sufficient for SR [38,39]. Another important aspect for the catalytic systems used in SR is the stability. In order to increase the catalyst life time a good interaction between the support and the metal NPs is of great importance. A second metal can increase the dispersion of the metal particles and stabilize them under the severe reaction conditions, increasing the interaction with the support and modifying the redox properties (see, for example Ref. [40]) or increase the resistance to oxidation. The C–C and C–H bonds cleavage is a determining step for SR to proceed and in some cases the addition of a second metal in low amount with a high ability for C–C and C–H disrepute can highly improve the performances [41] (Ni–Rh). The same way, WGS reaction can be optimized by the presence of metal promoters (like Pt, Pd, and Re) highly efficient for this reaction [42], or recombination of H atoms adsorbed on the surface can be promoted by metals with a high affinity for H, as Pt [43]. Selected examples about how the employment of a bimetallic systems for hydrogen production by reforming can fulfill some of these requirements are reported in the following paragraphs. 2.1.1 Hydrocarbons SR, ATR/OSR Hydrocarbons play a central role in hydrogen production processes: as already mentioned NG-SR actually accounts for more or less 85% of the worldwide total hydrogen production. However, also on-board generation of hydrogen by the reforming of jet fuel can also be used for fuel cells to provide the auxiliary power needs of civilian jet planes, thus, reducing the air pollution generated for this purpose [20]. Ni based catalysts are the current materials of choice for this reactions and many efforts are put in optimizing them, for this reason the major number of works are dedicated to the promotion of such systems, also by using bimetallic formulations. Li et al. reviewed in 2011 the topic of Ni catalysts modified with noble metals for the SR of methane [44]. According to the indications there reported, the effects of noble metals on the catalytic performances can be summarized as: activity enhancement, suppression of Ni oxidation (resulting in the suppression of deactivation due to oxidation of Ni and in the suppression of hot spot formation), limited carbon formation, self-activation behavior, and sustainability in the daily startup and shutdown operations. Here we give only an update on the more recent literature (also including some missing references). The effect of Ru or Pt addition (0.05wt%) on a plate-type anodic alumina supported 17.9wt% Ni/Al2O3 alloy was studied [45]. Authors found that the 0.079wt% Ru or Pt doped 17.9wt% Ni/Al2O3 alloy catalyst showed stable activity during 673–973K steam purge daily start-up and shut down (DSS) methane SR (M-SR), while prereduction with H2 was not necessary. Further, it was found that the Pt-doped Ni catalyst showed better steam-purge resistance, because the PtNi catalyst could even recover reactivity under 1073K and 1173K steam-purge DSS M-SR. The superior performances of bimetallic catalysts if compared to monometallic Ni system were attributed to the formation of a Pt (Ru)–Ni alloy that enhances the reducibility of Ni, thus allowing self activation, preventing oxidation of Ni under steaming, limiting coke deposition, and promoting self-redispersion ability. The lower performaces of Ru–Ni catalysts were directly related to the different H2 spillover ability of the two metals (Pt vs. Ru). The durability issue (a durability of over 90,000h is required for fuel cell systems, the minimum life of household appliances to be economical) was faced in a further work by the same authors [46] and an increase of ten times in durability was reported: only little deactivation was found during 3000h continual M-SR and 500-time daily start-up and shut down M-SR. In addition Pt–Ni catalyst also showed excellent reactivity during dry reforming of methane (M-DR) and partial oxidation of methane reaction (M-CPO). The same self-activation and prolonged lifetime effects was reported to occur for M-SR even at trace levels of Ru content (equal or higher than 0.05wt%) [47]. Ru promoted Ni catalysts were effective also when higher hydrocarbons are used as feedstock. Guggilla et al. [48] reported on a 1% Ru/2.5% Ni supported on CeO2-modified Al2O3 catalyst, which showed excellent performances in the SR of n-dodecane, thanks to a combination of several factors like high dispersion, high Ni metal area, and high basicity. Ru plays an important role since it promotes the easier reduction of nickel species to a metallic state and larger nickel surface area. However, according to TPR evidences, alloyed or intermetallic Ru–Ni nanoparticles are not present in this catalyst, which mainly consists in separated Ni and Ru supported NPs. Rhodium too shows comparable effects [49] in a Rh promoted Ni catalyst both for SR and ATR/OSR of n-butane. Ni–Rh supported on La–Al2O3 catalysts with low loading of rhodium performed better than Ni or Rh alone at the same metal loadings. The higher performance of the mixed Ni–Rh compared to Rh alone can be attributed to the presence of Ni–Rh alloy and oxidized nickel (NiAl2O4 and NiO x ) and rhodium species. These conclusions partially disagree with those reported in other works where a promotion of Ni reducibility and Ni dispersion was exerted by noble metal. The higher sulphur tolerance is another positive feature found in Rh–Ni bimetallic catalysts employed in higher hydrocarbons SR: Song et al. [30] reported on a Rh(2%)–Ni(10%)/CeO2–Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, prepared via wet co-impregnation, showing higher sulphur resistance if compared to monometallic Ni and Rh catalysts. The superior sulfur tolerance of the Rh catalyst at 1073K was associated with its capability in sulfur oxidation. It is likely that the formation of the oxygen-shielded sulfur structure of sulfonate and sulfate can suppress the poisoning impact of sulfur on Rh by inhibiting direct rhodium–sulfur interaction. However, Rh doping is not effective in preventing coke deposition since Rh–Ni catalytic performance was inferior if compared with the Rh catalyst in the reaction at 1073K. These results are in good agreement with previous work [31] where deactivation due to sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition during SR of sulfur-doped n-hexadecane was studied by Lakhapatri and Abraham for bimetallic catalysts, each containing 10% nickel, with Rh loadings of 0.5% and 2.5%, prepared. The authors found that only high Rh loaded bimetallic catalysts was able to both sulphur poisoning and deactivation by carbon deposition. The same authors studied deactivation phenomena occurring during the SR of a S containing Jet A fuel on a trimetallic Ni–(PdRh)/γ-Al2O3 prepared by a two step impregnation procedure. Their study further confirmed the role of Rh in preventing sulphur poisoning and deactivation by carbon deposition. Moreover the incorporation of noble metals (Pd, Rh) decreases the formation of the Ni aluminate, thereby enhancing catalyst stability [20]. Finally, it is worth to mention also a paper specifically devoted to the characterization and aiming to derive structure–properties correlations underlying the superior performances of bimetallic catalysts. Guo et al. [21] performed a detailed characterization study on bimetallic Rh–Ni catalysts aiming at elucidating the well known reduction of carbon deposition exerted by the noble metal. A 10wt% Ni–2wt% Rh/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst, prepared by co-impregnation, was tested for SR of Norpar13 (a model fuel of jet fuel from Exxon Mobil comprising mainly C12–C14 normal paraffins with an average carbon number of 13). The bimetallic catalyst showed conversion close to 100% with low amounts of deposed carbon (around 0.25gC/gCAT), conversely monometallic Ni catalysts showed only 50% conversion with higher amounts of deposed carbon (around 0.75gC/gCAT). EXAFS data clearly showed that Rh atoms prefer to stay on Ni surface to form surface Ni–Rh alloy, rather than dissolving into Ni particles to form bulk alloy. DFT calculations showed how the presence of Rh increases the energy barriers of C diffusion and C–C bond formation, thus slowing down both graphene and metal carbide formation. The Rh alloy also reduces the stability of deposited carbon over both terraces and steps. The O diffusion and C–O bond formation are not significantly affected, thus enhancing the oxidation reactions, responsible of carbon removal from catalyst surface. Other noble metals reported are Au and Ag [50]. The effect of Ag (1wt%) and Au (1wt%) on the catalytic properties of Ni/Al2O3 (7wt% Ni) for M-SR was studied in parallel with the effect of CeO2 (6wt%) and La2O3 (6wt%) addition. The authors found that on Ni–Ag/Al catalysts, silver is located on the top of Ni particles, which leads to a much lower nickel dispersion, thus resulting in lower activity. Conversely, the addition of Au and also CeO2, or La2O3, to the nickel catalyst improves the methane conversion, CO2 selectivity and hydrogen production at low reaction temperatures (T <873K). For all the studied catalysts, no important deactivation occurs after 48h of reaction at low temperatures. At temperatures higher than 923K, Ni–Au/Al, Ni–Ag/Al and Ni/La–Al are partially deactivated after 48h on stream, Ni/Al starts to deactivate also, due to sintering and/or coke deposition. Notably Ni/Ce–Al is stable and no deactivation is observed. Bimetallic Ag–Ni catalyst (Ni(15mol%)/Ag(15mol%)/MgO(30%)Al2O4) [51] showed significantly higher butane SR reactivity compared to the conventional Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The addition of Ag reduced the degree of carbon deposition and improved the H2 selectivity by eliminating the formation of C2 hydrocarbons at temperatures below 1023K. Moreover, the addition of the Ag component helped to retain the stability of the Ni crystallites and prevent their conglomeration under reaction conditions. Also the addition of non noble metals to Ni was reported [52], for instance the addition of cobalt to a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst effectively prevented metal oxidation and coke deposition phenomena. Using a Ni:Co weight ratio of 50:50 provided good catalytic activity, along with an absence of coking, when operated at a temperature of 1073K, a GHSV of 24Lg−1 h−1, and an S/C ratio of 3:1. 2.1.2 Oxygenates SR, ATR/OSR The most diffused oxygenates for the production of renewable H2 are alcohols like methanol, and ethanol They can be produced by renewable biomass through different processes, such as fermentation [53] or gasification [54], for instance. Glycerol is gaining increased attention due to its forecasted increased availability, and low price, since it is a byproduct of the transesterification process of fats and oils during biodiesel production [55]. The literature on bimetallic systems employed in alcohols SR is rich of several examples and a quite complex network of different effects, arising from the interactions between metals, is evident. However, this large amount of papers can be rationalized according to the structural properties (alloyed NPs vs. heterostructures) and/or to the main effect exerted by the promoting metal (increase in reducibility/dispersion/coke resistance of the active phase). Here we will report on some selected examples for the most diffused bimetallic composition classes with the aim of highlighting some features common in different systems as well as some relevant, even if uncommon, peculiarity. 2.1.2.1 Cu doped Ni based catalysts Copper was often added as a promoter to Ni based catalysts due to its well known alcohols dehydrogenation activity, better exploiting the C–C cleavage activity of Ni [56]. Lin et al. [57] reported a detailed characterization (XRD, XPS, and EXAFS) study on CuNi/SiO2 catalysts prepared by co-impregnation and by NaBH4 reduction for ethanol steam reforming (E-SR). The CuNi alloy NPs had a Ni enriched surface of the CuNi/SiO2 with Cu/Ni≥1. The presence of a Ni–SiO2 strong interaction was observed both in TPR and in XPS, and NiSiO3 might be formed which could not be reduced by H2 at 623K. The E-SR reaction over the CuNi/SiO2 catalysts produced H2, acetaldehyde, CH4, CO and CO2, but no ethylene or acetone. The Cu-only catalyst actively catalyzed ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde; while the Ni-only catalyst was less active at temperatures below 673K. Adding Ni to Cu catalysts could improve C–C bond rupture to produce CH4, CO and CO2. Indeed, the Cu1Ni1/SiO2 catalyst had the best ethanol conversion activity. The Cu-rich catalysts had a higher resistance to coking. On the other hand, the Ni-rich catalysts had higher CO conversion. At lower reaction temperatures, no significant coke formation was found over the catalysts with Cu/Ni≥1 but the Ni-rich catalysts produced coke via CH4 dehydrogenation. At higher temperatures, all catalysts generated coke via the reduction of CO x . The Cu1Ni1/SiO2 catalyst had the best catalytic performance, with the highest fractional conversion of acetaldehyde, the highest selectivity of SR of acetaldehyde and lower degree of carbon deposition. The effect of Cu loading (or Cu:Ni ratio) was studied by Wang [58] on a 10% Ni/γ-Al2O3 activated MgO catalyst in the bio-ethanol SR. Experimental results showed that the 10Ni5Cu/MgO/γ-Al2O3 sample was superior to other catalysts, especially in terms of the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio. The yield to hydrogen increased with the increase in temperature and H2O/C2H5OH molar ratio. The hydrogen yield up to 71% was reached at 823K and H2O/C2H5OH ratio of 10 over the 10Ni5Cu/MgO/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Fornasiero et al. [59] studied a series of Ni x Cu y /Al2O3 catalysts prepared by wet-impregnation method in the methanol and ethanol SR. The introduction of Cu in the catalyst formulation showed two positive effects: the inhibition of methane formation (even if the Ni:Cu ratio did not seem to affect the product distribution) and an appreciable resistance to deactivation. The formation of Cu–Ni alloy was reported to be also effective in the in the reduction of carbon deposition on a Ni–Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst during E-SR [60]. A significant positive effects of Cu (depending on Cu molar content) on the activity and products distribution of a Cu–Ni catalyst supported on porous nano-CeO2 was reported also by Jiao et al. and was attributed to the dispersion of NiO particles and the interactions between Cu–Ni metal and CeO2 support [61]. Copper addition showed positive effects on the Ni dispersion: a Ni0.5Cu0.1Mg2.4Al catalyst exhibits high activity and stability over 20h on stream at 973K, closely related to smaller nickel particles well dispersed on the catalyst surface, even if no direct evidences of Cu–Ni bimetallic NPs formation was provided [62] Cu doped systems were also effective in the methanol OSR (MOH-SR) reaction, as reported by Perez-Hernandez et al. for Cu–Ni/ZrO2 catalyst [63]. The catalytic activity for the bimetallic system was higher than for the monometallic samples in almost the whole range of the reaction temperature, with nearly complete conversion at 623K, while on Ni/ZrO2 it was <14% in the range 200–573K and reached 100% at 623K. At the same temperature for Cu/ZrO2 the maximum conversion was 50%. The catalytic performances are strictly related to the composition of the bimetallic NPs and on the nature of the metals. The high CO selectivity for the bimetallic systems was related to the presence of a fraction of Ni rich NPs, as evidenced by TEM and EDX analysis. Finally it is worth to mention how reaction temperature can have an important role on the performances of Cu–Ni bimetallic systems: Fierro et al. [64] studied the ethanol OSR (E-OSR) over a Ni/Al2O3 system, doped with Zn, Fe, Cr, or Cu, and found that the doping effect was temperature dependent. Ni–Cu showed good H2 selectivity when Cu loading was 0.6wt%, while Ni–Cr, Ni–Fe, and Ni–Zn showed a lower selectivity to H2. However, an increase of the operating temperature caused a changing in H2 productivity: Zn>Fe>Cr>Cu, and Cu became the worst promoter. The temperature dependence of selectivity was reported also for active carbon-supported Ni/Cu catalyst by Özkanet et al. [65]. When Ni was supported on Al2O3 a positive effect of Zn doping was evaluated for methanol SR (MOH-SR) [66]. Full methanol conversion can be achieved over 8Ni20Zn catalyst with the highest metals loading at 773K and WHSV=40.68h−1, producing 1% CO in the dry reformate. In this case H2 chemisorption and TPR study revealed how ZnO suppresses hydrogen chemisorption and increase the reduction temperature of Ni suggesting that Ni promotion effect may be associated with SMSI-like geometric effects and interpreted by a hypothesized encapsulation model. 2.1.2.2 Co–Ni systems The addition of cobalt to Ni based systems, or vice versa, The effect of the Co addition on the structure and redox properties of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for E-OSR was studied as a function of the CoO content (1–6wt%) [67]. Authors reported an interesting systematic investigation during reduction process of the oxide samples via in situ temperature resolved X-ray absorption near structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The TPR and in situ XANES-TPR analysis of the samples clearly indicated that the Co addition into the Ni/Al2O3 system has a considerable effect on the metal–support interaction, by assisting the formation of NiO and Co3O4 species weakly interacting with the alumina surface and decreasing the reduction temperature compared to that of the monometallic system. The good performance of the bimetallic 6CoNi/Al catalyst in the E-OSR related to generation of higher H2 yields was a result of the occurrence of the WGS reaction to a significantly higher extent at temperatures above 723K compared to the one showed by monometallic 6Co/Al system. Only the addition Ni seemed to have a certain promotion effect on the catalytic performances of Co/ZnO catalyst for ethanol SR (E-SR) at low temperature. When 1% wt Ni is added to 10% wt Co based catalyst, hydrogen production increase from 3.4mol H2 per mol EtOH to 3.9 after 24h on stream at 573K. At higher temperature the promotion effect is negligible. Differently, the addition of Cu did not lead to any improvement in H2 productivity, probably due to side reactions. Evidences of alloy formation as well as mixed oxides were found on the spent catalyst by HRTEM-EELS [68]. Co–Ni catalysts were also applied to glycerol SR (G-SR), showing good performances as activity and coke resistance are concerned. Moreover, spent catalysts could be also regenerated by oxidation/reduction treatments without any significant loss of performances [69,70]. Differently, a study on Ni/X/CeO2–ZrO2 (X=Cu, Co) catalytic systems on (E-SR) showed that in range 723–873K the addition of Co was detrimental for the catalytic performances of Ni and a relatively large amount of C2H4, C2H6, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 were obtained. At 673K the undoped catalyst showed a conversion of 43%. Differently, the presence of Cu largely improved the SR activity. In particular, when Cu loading reached 5% wt the conversion reached 91% and the production of CO2 and H2 got better due to a higher WGS activity and a decreased activity in the dehydrogenation of ethanol to C2H4. For higher Cu loadings the activity started to decrease. The author related this trend to the interaction between Cu and Ni as evidenced by TPR experiments. At higher loading the activity decreased due to the presence of segregate CuO. No beneficial effects of doping were revealed when oxygen was co-fed [71]. 2.1.2.3 NMs promoted systems (NM=Pt, Rh, …) The cooperative effect derived from the presence of two metals can improve the catalytic performances when the specific activity of both metals can be useful for the reaction pathway, as this effect is of greater importance when Ni–Rh systems are employed for hydrogen production. The addition of a noble metal to a non-noble one can be exploited in order to increase the reducibility of the non noble metal, as in the case of Co–Rh/SiO2 Co–Ru/SiO2 where Rh and Ru favors the reduction of Co, as evidenced by TPR and XPS, and the formation of bimetallic supported NPs. The activity of Co unpromoted and promoted catalysts was similar in E-OSR and deactivated with TOS. However, only the Rh–Co and Ru–Co restored their initial activity by oxidation and the regeneration process could be performed several times because the noble metals facilitate the regeneration of the catalyst and the elimination of carbonaceous deposits. Indeed, higher values for both ethanol conversion and selectivity to hydrogen were demonstrated after oxidative treatment [72]. The addition of a noble metal to Ni catalysts in some cases could not lead to an improvement of catalytic performances. Iriondo et al. found that when Pt is added to Ni/Al2O3 for G-SR, the catalytic activity decrease even if from XPS and TPR analysis the extent of reduction and the reducibility of NiO increased in presence of Pt. This can be related to the low activity of Pt under the reaction conditions adopted in the study. Pt alone showed poor performances due to dehydratation coupled with dehydrogenation or hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions [73]. Rh can be added to Ni/CeO2 to increase the conversion in E-OSR, mainly coupling the ability of Rh to cleave C–C and C–H bonds and the ability of Ni in WGS. The ability of Rh to cleave C–C and C–H bonds, important steps for SR reaction, is well known. In fact, ethanol can be adsorbed on Rh forming oxametallacycle intermediate that can easily undergo to C–C cleavage. The addition of Rh to Ni supported on CeO2 in general increases the conversion in E-OSR at low temperature. An increase in ethanol conversion from 80% to 92% was registered upon the addition of 10% wt Ni to Rh/CeO2, even if the highest H2 productivity was obtained with a Ni loading of 5% wt because of the less pronounced methanation activity. On the contrary, the conversion on monometallic 10% wt Ni catalyst was 40% with the greatest acetaldehyde productivity [41]. A strong interaction between metallic species and support, that depends on the Ni amount and crystallites dimension, were revealed by XPS and TPR experiments. The Ni and Rh stabilized in the form of highly dispersed bimetallic redox species in strong interaction with the support rather than an alloy on the surface due to a synergistic effect between the two metals. The dispersion of Rh is the main feature that influences the catalytic performances being strongly affected by CeO2 crystallites size and the presence of Ni [74]. Other positive effects of Rh addition are the reduction of the carbonaceous deposits during ethanol ATR [75] and the promotion of NiO reducibility at lower temperatures when added to trimetallic oxides Me–LaZr (Me: Ni, Co) [76]. Interestingly the addition of Ni to a Rh catalyst was reported for a Rh/Y2O3–Al2O3 catalyst evaluated in the E-OSR reaction in the presence of methyl-2-propan-1-ol as impurity. Nickel incorporation leads to the formation of both dispersed nickel phase and nickel aluminate species. NiAl2O4 phase led to an increase of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) of weak strength, generating a decrease of the production of coke and higher catalyst stability [77]. The NM effect on NNM dispersion was observed also for Co based systems by Brum Pereira et al. [78] who reported on an optimized multi-component bulk-type cobalt-based catalysts containing Ru and Na, highly effective and stable (300h at 648K) in the OSR of a glycerol/ethanol mixture. It's worth to mention that even NNMs can show a similar effect: Fe can promote a better dispersion resulting in an improvement in catalytic performances in Ni–Fe/La2O2CO3 compared to monometallic Ni/La2O2CO3 in E-SR [79]. When MOH-OSR was performed over (CuO x –silicate) based catalysts higher H2 production rate and a lower CO selectivity were achieved due to the stabilization, by iron, of more active and stable Cu(I) and Cu(0) inside the Fe–silicates matrix, preventing the sintering of the active sites during the catalytic tests [80]. 2.1.2.4 Pd based bimetallic catalysts Zinc doped palladium catalysts are widely used due to the high CO2 selectivities that can be reached in M-SR. Friederich et al. [81] reported on a PdZn unsupported intermetallic catalysts with different composition that were tested in methanol SR. Catalytic tests proved that CO2 selectivity are influenced principally by the Pd amount in the catalyst as well as activity. The highest CO2 selectivity of 99.4% was achieved on Zn48.4Pd51.6 between 623 and 673K. Zn-rich catalysts showed a better activity and selectivity to CO2 compared to Pd-rich ones thanks to the shift on the Fermi energy that causes a change in the electronic properties of Pd, decreasing methanol decomposition, and with the interaction between the intermetallic compound and oxidized Zn on the surface. An interesting study on MOH-SR over Pd/ZnO/Al2O3 clearly demonstrated the dependence of SR activity on the surface alloying process and nature. In fact, the authors revealed how the morphology of the NPs surface of the catalytic system is dynamic during SR and can be recovered during time on stream [82]. The surface PdZn alloy is active and stable under redox cycling, and PdO and ZnO formed during regeneration at 693K in air can recover their activity during time on stream quickly. The initial catalytic performances are strongly related to the surface composition and, even if the starting surface alloy composition of NPs strongly depends on the activation condition of the catalyst, as evidenced by TEM, the migration of Zn toward the bulk from the surface of NPs is influenced by the reduction temperature, during time on stream the performances tend to stabilize towards the same values. FTIR of adsorbed CO revealed a similar final state of the metallic surface after catalytic test regardless the activation pretreatment of the catalyst. The dynamic feature of Pd based doped catalyst during the catalytic test was evidenced for a PdZn/CeO2 catalyst tested in MSR at near stoichiometric conditions [83]. The active phase was monitored by TEM and XPS and a progressive formation of bimetallic nanoparticles was evidenced during time on stream. The ratio among the different present Pd species (Pd0:Pd2+:Pd4+) varied due to a slow reduction process: 0:0:100 for fresh catalyst, 0:41:59 after 20h and 32:26:42 after 570h and a progressive enrichment of the surface by Zn was revealed. The authors proposed a mechanism based on a slow reduction of Pd due to CO and H2 that can activate H2 and promote the reduction of Zn that migrates enriching the surface and forming PdZn bimetallic cluster and crystallites. A similar dynamic behavior of the bimetallic nanoparticles that depends on the surrounding gas environment was revealed for Pd/Ga2O3 [84]. In situ characterization (XRD, XPS, FTIR) and catalytic tests led to a correlation between the structure of the active phase and the initial catalytic properties. Among different metallic phases, modulated with reduction temperature, the most active was Pd2Ga obtained by reduction at 623K, with a CO2 selectivity higher than 90%. This high selectivity seemed to be related to the intermetallic nature of the active sites rather than on the high conversion. However, exposing the catalyst to air, even at room temperature, causes a decrease in the CO2 selectivity due to a modification of the surface of the intermetallic compound and to the probable formation of islands of oxidic Ga that form upon decomposition of the intermetallic, that move the reactivity to the one of pure Pd (methanol decomposition). Also CO causes a modification of the surface of the intermetallic compound that can be related to the certain degree of methanol decomposition. A detailed study on Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst for MOH-SR pointed out how an appropriate reduction temperature of the system prior to the catalytic tests was mandatory for the obtainment of a CO2 selective catalyst [85,86]. The authors correlated the catalytic activity with the presence of Pd–Ga bimetallic particles, comparing a thin film model system and a powder catalyst. The optimal bimetallic nature of the particles could be achieved by reducing the samples in the appropriate temperature range. The active phase was identify as Pd5Ga2 for the thin film model catalyst and was obtained by reducing the sample in the range 523–600K. The same phase evidenced in [84], Pd2Ga, differently developed for the powder catalyst in the range 523–773K. Beside the most studied zinc, and gallium, also indium can be considered a good promoter for Pd based catalytic systems for MOH-SR. Mendes et al. [87] developed a Pd–In/Al2O3 systems aiming at the optimization of the Pd:In ratio. Pd addition led to an increase of the methanol conversion along with a relevant increase in CO selectivity. Only a low Pd–In content, i.e. 5:10, favoured a high conversion and a low CO selectivity (CO<1% vol). The activity of the bimetallic catalyst was related to the formation of a Pd–In alloy, as evidenced by XRD. As in the case of PdZn systems, the nature of the catalyst revealed to be dynamic and to change when exposed to the reactants, optimizing itself. The active alloy is reached during the catalytic test avoiding any pretreatment of the catalyst. Again, monometallic Pd catalyst promotes methanol decomposition, rather than SR, but the addition of In led to an increase in SR and to a CO decrease. When the Pd–In ratio increased a less efficient formation of the alloy resulted in an increase of CO, related to the presence of Pd sites non in contact with In. The author proposed that the main role of In the alloy, due to its redox properties and reducibility, is the adsorption and activation of oxygen that helps in stabilizing the Pd from over-reduction and stabilize surface species, such as formates. Moreover, the presence of In changes the catalytic activity of Pd from methanol decomposition, leading to a high amount of CO, to MOH-SR with a high H2 productivity, and a low CO2 selectivity. The effect of the reduction pretreatment on the catalytic properties and on the structure was evaluated for Pd directly deposed onto In2O3 [88]. A powder sample and a thin film model catalyst were analyzed by HRTEM and tested for MOH-SR. Differently from what stated by Men [89], both the activity and CO2 selectivity strongly depends on the reductive pretreatment of the samples. For the thin film model a PdIn bimetallic systems is formed upon reduction till 573K while for the powder sample PdIn is obtained at 573K while at 673K Pd2In3 formed. The CO2-selective MOH-SR is observed in the reduction temperature range between 473K and 573K but at higher temperature In2O3 started to encapsulate the bimetallic nanoparticles and the selectivity for CO2 decreased. Differently from the case of Pd based catalysts doped with ZnO, In2O3 and Ga2O3, SnO2 and GeO2 did not led to a CO2 selective for methanol SR [90]. In fact when Pd was deposed on GeO2 and SnO2 no improvement in its catalytic activity was detected due to a strong interaction between Pd and the support upon high temperature reduction in the case of GeO2 and to a probable too high enrichment of the surface or to the formation of metallic β-Sn, in the case of Sn. 2.1.2.5 All NMs based systems The employment of bimetallic organometallic precursors, where the metals are in close interaction before the deposition on the support, can be a way to control the bimetallic properties and composition of the NPs efficiently and to have a superior catalytic activity for H2 production. When [Ru5PtC(CO)15]2− is deposed on Al2O3 to obtain Ru–Pt/Al2O3 for E-SR a more active and stable bimetallic catalyst was obtained if compared with inorganic salts derived one. C–C cleavage seems to be facilitate on bimetallic cluster derived catalyst due to a strong Pt–Ru interaction, as evidenced by TPR and XPS. In fact, XPS analysis detected a higher concentration of Pt on the surface of the NPs in cluster derived sample. Differently, for inorganic salts derived catalyst, the surface of the NPs was Ru enriched. Due to the Pt surface enrichment, that posses a good activity in WGS reaction, the cluster derived sample showed the highest selectivity to CO2 (20%) at low temperature. Moreover, ethanol-TPD patterns suggested a synergist effect between Pt and Ru: the temperature of H2 desorption was lower in presence of Pt, and C–C cleavage more efficient [42]. Alumina-supported Ru and Ru–Pt nanoparticles, derived from organometallic cluster precursors, were found to be highly efficient catalysts for H2 production via the E-SR [91]. The cluster-derived (Ru2.5Pt1) catalysts were more active and selective than all salt-derived catalysts of similar metallic loadings. The cluster-derived catalysts also outperformed a commercial 5wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst. The good catalytic performance of these catalysts were explained by the extremely small sizes of the cluster-derived nanoparticles. EDX analyses of spent catalysts also suggested that the presence of Pt might help in suppressing coke formation over both cluster- and salt-derived catalysts. Dumesic evidenced how the addition of Re, Ru, Os to Pt increase the activity of Pt/C for the production of syn gas from glycerol, due to their promotion in decreasing the interaction of CO with Pt [92]. In a recent study on G-SR on Ru/Sn/Mg(Al)O prepared by OMCVD demonstrated how the catalytic performances strongly depend on the dopant loading. Even if Sn increased the specific activity of Ru at low loading (0.23wt%), an increase in its loading till 3.22wt% caused the catalytic performances to suffer a deep deactivation process. At low loading, the catalytic performances remained constant with time on stream and the glycerol conversion was 87.5% at 20h. Differently, for the catalyst with a Sn loading of 3.22wt% the conversion decrease from 80% to 20% after 20h [93]. The synthetic methodology is an important parameter that can influence the promotion effect of a second metal, as evidenced by a recent study of Sanches [94]. The catalytic activity correlates well the structural changes inducted by a different synthetic methodology. A homogeneous precipitation mediated by urea decomposition, a sequential precipitation and a coprecipitation methodology were evaluated, revealing by XRD analysis that the methanol conversion in SR depended more on the increase of lattice constant for Cu structure than on its surface area. The highest conversion, related to the highest increase in lattice constant, was obtained with the homogeneous precipitation methodology. The author related this trend to a different extent of inclusion of Zn into CuO matrix that was more favored for homogeneous precipitation and played a crucial role for Cu–Zn alloy formation. A more detailed description of the active site is proposed in a study on a model Cu–Zn surface catalyst for MOH-SR [95] obtained by Zn evaporation onto Cu surface in UHV, followed by thermal annealing in vacuum. The best precatalyst revealed to have a Cu:Zn ratio of 10:1 and the catalytic properties was tuned by the annealing temperature. The optimal near surface alloy was obtained with 5–12 ML (monolayer of Zn)onto Cu foil at 298K and the properties revealed to deeply depend on annealing temperatures. As grown bimetallic surface showed to be more active then Cu foil but the maximum of activity was obtained when the annealing temperature reached 543K. AES and XPS analysis of the samples revealed how the annealing temperature influenced the morphology of the surface sites. In particular, the as grown surface (Cu:Zn≈10:1) change when annealed at 543K. Cu(Zn)0/Zn (ox) interface was formed due to the segregation of Zn on the surface and revealed to be very active for total oxidation of methanol to CO2 and H2O activation due to the Cu and Cu(Zn)0/Zn(ox) redox properties, respectively. At a higher temperature, a more pronounced segregation of Zn(OX) on the surface resulted detrimental for the catalytic properties. A deep dependence on the preparation procedure was evidenced also when Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for liquid methanol reforming were doped with Mo and Fe [96]. Only a successively impregnation methodology led to a substantial improvement of H2 production of 6 times and 2.4 for Mo and Fe doped samples, respectively, in comparison to Pt catalyst. The better catalyst activity was related to two different dopant dependent effects, based on XPS and XAS experiments. In the case of Mo, the effect seemed to be ascribable to a SMSI effect that increase the stability and dispersion of the active phase due to the formation of MoO2, while in the case of Fe, the reason was more related to an electronic effect, due to the formation of surface bimetallic clusters."
3,Dry reforming,"2.2 Dry reforming Hydrocarbons (mainly methane) dry reforming (Reaction (10)) is an endothermic reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons giving H2/CO mixtures. It is an attractive way to produce hydrogen, and, in the same time, to reducing CO2 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. DR also offers some advantages over SR and CPO of methane since (i) it forms a suitable H2/CO ratio, i.e., nearly 1:1, for use in the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons; (ii) it is better used in chemical energy transmission, and (iii) it can be used as an independent source for the production of synthesis gas, with the condition that some amount of an oxidizing agent, e.g., CO2 or O2/H2O, is added [97]. (10) CH4 +CO2 →2CO+2H2 ΔH 0 29K =247kJmol−1 The main disadvantages are, in turn, represented by the high endotermicity, which makes DR an energy intensive, and thus costly, process; the high reation temperatures, which can induce sintering phenomena. However, the main drawback is the formation of coke which finally deactivates the catalysts. Indeed, dry reforming of methane is gaining more and more importance since it is one of the reactions allowing the direct use of biogas for hydrogen production, since it do not requires CO2 separation and also it optimize the atoms efficiency (both C atoms from CH4 and CO2 are incorporated in the products) [22]. The DR of biogas [22], and of hydrocarbons [23], was recently reviewed, following these excellent papers, the main issues of this reaction are, again, sintering of active phase, and carbon formation. However, H2S poisoning is not neglectable since it could be present in biogas, deriving from the bio-degradation of sulfur containing molecules. The use of bimetallic catalysts was one of the possible solutions, also for DR Ni catalysts find large applications, consequently the studies on bimetallic Ni based catalysts are the majority. For example Ni catalysts modified with noble metals were recently reviewed too by Li et al. [23]. The most important effects exerted by bimetallic systems are the carbon deposition inhibition by reduction of the metal ensemble size (i.e. increasing the dispersion of NPs), and the increase of reduction degree of active metal by H2 spill-over (see Refs. [22,23] and references cited therein). The most recent literature is mainly devoted to the study of Co–Ni and Pt–Ni systems. As Ni–Co concerns a recent paper by Gonzalez-delaCruz et al. reports on a detailed characterization of the synergic Co–Ni interactions on Ni–Co/ZrO2 methane DR catalysts [98]. On the basis of a detailed XAS, XRD, and TPR characterization it was demonstrated the formation of a more reducible nickel–cobalt alloy phase, which remains completely metallic also during M-DR. The observed synergic effect was rationalized and the authors concluded that Ni atoms prevent the deposition of carbon over the Co sites, keeping its higher activity in the DR reaction. Consequently, the increased hydrogen production of the Co sites maintain Ni atoms completely reduced under reaction conditions. This synergic effect results in improved catalytic performances by increasing stability of active bimetallic phase and preventing coke deposition. Namely the coke deposition prevention was also confirmed by Fan et al. [99] for Ni–Co/MgO–ZrO2 systems. The coke resistance can be further improved by lanthanides (Ce, Pr, and Sm) addition [100,101] through their red–ox activity in C gasification and/or on their ability in increasing Co–Ni NPs dispersion. Guczi et al. in a paper devoted to the study of coke deposition and on its effect on the activity reached similar conclusions for bimetallic Ni–Rh and Ni–Co catalysts supported on Ce–Zr–oxide synthesised by pseudo sol–gel method. The carbon contamination played a dynamic role in dry reforming reaction to produce CO and the deactivation process was caused partially by the re-oxidation of Ni into NiO during the reaction and partially by detrimental coke formation [102]. Pt–Ni alloyed based systems (supported on Al2O3) are reported to be very active and stable due to several positive effects of the Pt addition: increase of dispersion; limitation of sintering; increase in reducibility of Ni phase; inhibition of coke deposition; lowering of the reaction temperature [103,104]. The structure of PtNi NPs was the object of a detailed study [105] which demonstrated the formation of a PtNi alloy, enriched at the surface by Pt and with a smaller NPs size than with respect to monometallic catalysts. The alloy formation results in higher activity and lower production of carbonaceous deposits. The dependance of catalytic performances of bimetallic Pt–Ni samples was reported to be strongly influenced by the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio. Namely a 0.3%Pt–10%Ni/δ-Al2O3 showed the best performance due to the better intimate interaction between Pt and Ni that maximize the easy reduction of nickel oxide species and also the dispersion of resulting nickel NPs [106]."
4,Aqueous phase reforming,"2.3 Aqueous phase reforming Aqueous phase reforming can be considered as a process similar but alternative to the traditional SR since it can be used to convert water soluble (but less prone to vaporization) biomasses into H2 and CO2 at temperatures near 523K over metal catalysts. The selectivity towards H2 can be controlled by altering the nature of the catalytically active metal sites (e.g., Pt) and metal–alloy (e.g. Ni–Sn) components, and by choice of catalyst support. A good catalyst should promote C–C bond cleavage and WGS reaction, but further hydrogenation of CO and CO2 towards alkanes or parallel reactions by C–O bond cleavage to form alcohols and acids should be avoided [107]. The positive effects occurring in bimetallic systems can be exploited also for APR: PtNi, PtCo, PtFe, and PdFe catalysts were reported to be more active than the monometallic Pt and Pd ones [108]. However the great potential of APR in H2 production from actual biomass is hindered by the low yields (1.05–1.41mmolg−1 of carbohydrates) obtained due to the formation of carbon deposits and by-products [109]. Even the most recent papers dealing with optimized Pt–Mo [110], Pt–Co [111,112], and Ni–Co [113] bimetallic catalysts evidenced how the reaction rates are too low for an economically viable process. The most relevant data (catalyst composition, reaction, advantages/disadvantages with respect to monometallic system, and ref.) of bimetallic catalysts employed in reforming reactions (SR, OSR-ATR, DR, APR) are summarized in Table 1 ."
5,Catalytic partial oxidation,
6,Hydrocarbons CPO,"3.1 Hydrocarbons CPO The CH4-CPO reaction (Eq. (11)) is an alternative to the well established and diffused SR processes. (11) CH4 +0.5O2 →2H2 +CO (ΔH =−37kJmol−1) CPO is a slightly exothermic reaction, and shows some advantages in comparison with SR, such as cost reductions of about 30%; no NO x formation, since no burners are used; an H2/CO ratio of about 2, (the ideal ratio for synthesis gas to be used in FT synthesis of methanol); more compact units; high feed flexibility (from C1 to heavy hydrocarbons and also renewable like glycerol). However, CPO show also some drawbacks like temperature gradients that lead to the formation of “hot spots” where the heat evolved could melt the supported metal NPs leading to catalyst deactivation. Moreover, high temperature can also promote the formation of spinel species like NiAl2O4 and Co/Al2O4, which are poorly reducible and thus inactive. Another relevant problem is represented by coking, which may lead to catalyst deactivation and/or reactor plugging. Coking can occur mainly by Boudouard reaction (Reaction (5)) and methane decomposition (Reaction (6)) [9]. It is also known that noble metals (Rh, Ru, Pt, etc.) show higher resistance to coke deposition, conversely coking is a major problem for less expensive Ni and Co based catalysts. Takehira et al. [24,25] showed that the addition of small amount of noble metals (NMs), i.e., Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt, on Ni/Mg(Al)O catalysts have beneficial effects, lowering the coke formation and preventing Ni oxidation under reaction during the propane CPO. The loading of noble metal gave rise to a decrease in the reduction temperature of Ni2+ to Ni0 on Mg2.5(Al,Ni0.5)O periclase, and a decrease in the particle size of Ni metal formed on the NMs-Ni/Mg2.5(Al)O catalyst. The formation of finely dispersed bimetallic nanoparticles, was demonstrated by XRD, H2 chemisorption, and TPR investigations. The combination of Ru and Ni0.5/Mg2.5(Al)O was the most effective, showing, for 0.5wt% Ru–Ni0.5/Mg2.5(Al)O catalyst 100% propane conversion, 86.4% hydrogen selectivity, 81.4% CO selectivity, and 4.4% of coke deposed (T reaction of 973K). Good results were obtained by Ru addition to Co based catalysts for the oxidative reforming of diesel like in LaCo1−x Ru x O3 perovskites with different substitutions of Co by Ru (x =0.01–0.1) [114]. The addition of Pt is well known from years to be positive both for Co, like in Pt–Co/γ-Al2O3 system [115] and for Ni, as in Pt–Ni/δ-Al2O3 catalysts successfully employed for propane [116] and LPG [117] CPO. Ir–Ni systems were also reported and the synergistic effects between Ir and Ni was attributed to the formation of metallic (active) phases at low temperatures, even if the authors supply only indirect proofs of their assumption [118]. More recently bimetallic Ni–Au/Al2O3 catalysts were applied to the CH4–CPO and showed not only improved catalyst stability, as already reported [119], but also an increased activity (ignition temperature shifts from 1023K for monometallic Ni/Al2O3 to 923K for Ni–Au/Al2O3) [120]. The TPR analysis, the catalyst XRD crystal structure, and the results of XPS analysis clearly indicates that gold improve reducibility, and also oxidative stability under CPO conditions, of Ni (active) phase and that an Au–Ni alloy formation takes place. However, also bimetallic, noble metals free, Ni–Co catalysts were reported: a series of Ni x Co y (where x, y are the respective metal loadings of 0, 1, 2 or 3wt.%; x + y =3) [121] bimetallic catalysts supported on CaAl2O4/Al2O3 showed improved activity, selectivity, and coking-resistance for hydrogen/synthesis gas production by CH4–CPO (at 1bar, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 144,000cm3 g−1 h−1 and CH4/O2 molar ratio of 2). The activity was found to decrease in the order of Ni2Co>Ni3 >NiCo2 ≈Co3, while CO and H2 selectivities were found to be in the order of Ni2Co>Ni3 ≈NiCo2 >Co3. Ni2Co is also shown to be more resistant to coking as compared to bare Ni, which is a current catalyst of choice. Results not only show that Ni2Co have the highest activity and selectivity among all the catalysts tested, but that it is also relatively resistant to coking. Pengpanich et al. [122] reported on a clear example of geometrical effect by the Sn doping of a Ni based catalyst. A Ni/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst was doped with different amounts of Sn (ranging from 0 to 2% wt) and tested for iso-octane partial oxidation in the temperature range of 673–1073K at atmospheric pressure. The authors found that the addition of small amount of Sn (<0.5wt%) decreased the extent of carbon deposition by more than 50% keeping conversion almost unaffected (only a 5% difference was found). Conversely, the addition of more than 1% of Sn resulted in a strong decrease of catalytic activity. The best results were obtained with a 5% Ni–0.5% Sn catalyst which showed 73% iso-octane conversion and 2.2% of carbon deposited after 12h of reaction at 973K and C/O ratio of 1.0. This behavior was ascribed to the ability of Sn to reduce the amount of whisker carbon growth by retarding the solubility of carbon in Ni particles by blocking the surface site ensembles required for carbon formation [123]. The effect of adding small amounts (1/15 molar ratio) of Ni, Fe, Cr, Re, Mn, W, Mo, V, and Ta oxides to a Co/Al2O3 catalyst by IW was studied [124] and it was found that the presence of co-impregnated metals or metal oxides that may either form bimetallic or mixed oxide species with cobalt was detrimental to the catalyst performance. The addition of Mn, Re and Cr enhanced the combustion activity of the catalyst in the oxidation zone without significantly and adversely affecting the reforming properties of the catalyst. Also the addition of Ni had no significant effects on catalytic performances. The presence of elements that likely will remain unreduced oxides, or form mixed oxides with cobalt when oxygen is present, in particular W, Mo, V, and Ta, was detrimental to the activity, stability, and selectivity. A catalyst consisting in 0.5% Ru and 0.5% Pt (w/w) supported on mixture of alumina, ceria and zirconia (75%/4.4%/20.6%, w/w), washcoated on a ceramic monolith was employed in CH4-CPO and showed rather good activity and selectivity towards CO and H2 and also good stability [125,126]. The overall effect of platinum is to promote the reaction at lower temperature and even if the first reaction to occur is total oxidation (leading to H2O and CO2), partial oxidation also ignites at a lower temperature if compared with monometallic ruthenium catalyst (823K vs. 903K). The Pt, that can hardly be oxidized, as confirmed by TPO characterization, stabilizes Ru, limiting redox reactions during the heating and cooling cycles and also preventing aging usually showed by monometallic Ru. The development of catalysts suitable for hydrogen production using heavy hydrocarbons as feedstock was recently reviewed by Navarro Yerga et al. [127]. The presence of sulfur compounds, of olefins and aromatics are the major problems that results in catalysts deactivation by poisoning and coke deposition, respectively."
7,Oxygenates CPO,"3.2 Oxygenates CPO Alcohols CPO was excellently reviewed by several authors, see for example the recent paper of Hohn and Lin [53]. Methanol is the most reported feedstock due to its abundance, high hydrogen to carbon (H/C) atomic ratio, and safe storage properties. Notably a so called “methanol economy” as an alternative to the well known “hydrogen economy” was proposed by Olah et al. [128,129]. Several monometallic systems have been used but some of them suffered disadvantages, i.e. Pd based show the formation of CO in considerable amounts [130]. Gold has attracted great attention as dopant/co-catalyst, due to its excellent CO oxidation activity even at low temperature [131,132]. M-CPO with Au–Pd bimetallic catalysts was studied by several groups [133–135]. The group of Chang focused on a series of Au–M/OX (where M=Ru, Cu; OX=Fe2O3; TiO2, and TiO2–Fe2O3) elucidating the effect of M and of the OX support on the structure, oxygen vacancies availability and Fe role on the catalytic performances observed. The same authors investigated also the effects of preparation procedures (pH during deposition–precipitation, calcinations temperatures, etc.) on the structure and performances of their bimetallic systems. Methanol CPO (MOH-CPO) was first investigated over Au–Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst, prepared by deposition–precipitation method [136]. Au–Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst shows 100% methanol conversion with a hydrogen selectivity of 82.0% at 523K. The enhanced activity and stability of the bimetallic catalyst has been explained in terms of strong metal–metal and metal–support interactions. The catalytic behavior at various calcination temperatures suggests that chemical state of the support and particle size of Au and Ru plays an important role. The high structural stability of bimetallic NPs was ascribed to the strong interaction between the gold, ruthenium and the reducible Fe2O3 support, as witnessed by a perusal of characterization evidences (TEM, TPR). The high activity was ascribed to the higher availability of lattice oxygen for the reaction in the bimetallic Au–Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst (the Au–Ru weakens the Fe–O bond, thereby increase the lattice oxygen mobility), compared to monometallic Au/Fe2O3 and Ru/Fe2O3 catalysts. The effect of preparation method, deposition–precipitation (DP) vs. co-precipitation (CP), was further studied for Au–Ru/Fe2O3 catalysts [137]. Systems prepared by DP methods show better catalytic performances than ones prepared by CP method, the reason of the observed behavior was attributed to the stronger interactions between the two metals and also between the metals and the support, that leads to higher lattice oxygen mobility, thereby influencing the reaction with higher hydrogen selectivity and slightly lesser amount of CO. Moreover DP catalysts showed also higher stability under reaction conditions. The bimetallic Au–Cu/TiO2 catalysts are more active, stable and exhibit higher hydrogen selectively with smaller amount of CO compared to the monometallic Au/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 catalysts [138]. The enhanced activity, selectivity and stability of the bimetallic catalysts are due to Au–Cu interaction that creates smaller metal particles, which consequently increase the ionic gold species by O2 activation. This interaction is caused by the redox properties of Cu, which stabilize the active Au δ+ species and also stabilize the Au particle size. Copper species supply the active oxygen during the catalytic reaction, and the oxygen vacancy created on copper can be filled by O2 from the feed and again leave activated oxygen on the surface. The highly reactive oxygen participates in the CPO, finally producing hydrogen. These processes are continuing during the reaction and facilitating stable activity. CPO was further investigated over Au–Cu/TiO2 and Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalysts [139]. The Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalyst with Ti/Fe=9/1 atomic ratio is more active and exhibits higher methanol conversion compared to the Au–Cu/TiO2 catalyst. The Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalysts show higher activity (82–85% CH3OH conversion; 78–80% H2 selectivity) at low reaction temperature region (448–473K) compared to the Au/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalysts (75–80% CH3OH conversion; 45–59% H2 selectivity). The higher activity of Fe-containing catalyst was attributed to the ability to supply reactive oxygen, thereby stabilize active gold species (Au δ+) in the catalyst. The increased activity by the addition of small amount of Fe could be explained in terms of higher dispersion of gold and copper thereby enhance the interaction between gold, copper, and TiO2, which increased the availability of surface oxygen [140]. On the contrary the further increase in Fe content results detrimental for the catalytic performances. Bimetallic Au–Pd/ZnO catalyst was compared with monometallic ones (Au/ZnO and Pd/ZnO) prepared by PVP-stabilized reduction method by C2H5OH [141]. Au–Pd/ZnO catalyst shows higher activity, hydrogen selectivity, and stability compared to the Pd/ZnO and Au/ZnO catalyst, the methanol conversion of 99.5% and hydrogen selectivity of 65.6% were obtained at 573K. The enhanced activity and stability of the bimetallic Au–Pd/ZnO catalyst has been explained in terms of the higher dispersion and basic density, smaller particles of gold and synergetic effect between gold and palladium. The presence of Au x Pd y alloys was demonstrated by XRD, TPR, and TPD. Loganathan et al. [142] studied the ethanol CPO at short contact times on bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts supported on zirconia and alumina. Their major finding was that in an equimolar PtSn alloy, the Pt–Pt bond distance is 2.72Å vs. 2.77Å for the metallic platinum catalyst. The contraction in interatomic distances would make it easier for the PtSn catalyst to adsorb both carbons in the aldehyde to break the bond, instead of only bonding one carbon which would more easily lead to dehydration. Miller et al. found that a contraction of 0.15 angstroms in a gold catalyst greatly changed the activity, so it is reasonable to expect a 0.05Å contraction to have a noticeable effect as well. The difference in Pt–Pt bond distances is only 2.5%, so we expect changes in flux through a pathway rather than turning on or off of a pathway. Schuyten et al. presented a nice and detailed study on a bimetallic Pd–CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts employed in methanol partial oxidation [134], where the preferential formation of Pd–Cu alloys under reducing and reaction conditions was demonstrated by EXAFS experiments. Notably the catalyst showed high activity and stability (100h to at 473K) reaching a final conversion of 86%, and hydrogen selectivity of 85%. Finally bio-oil is another of the emerging feedstock for hydrogen production, since it represent a good platform intermediate that can be produced by a large number of lignocellulosic sources (straw, agricultural wastes, wood wastes, etc.) by fast pyrolysis processes. Bio-oil is a energy vector showing positive properties like the high energy density (both volumetric and gravimetric), it is easily transportable, however, it cannot be used directly as a fuel due to its tendency to polymerize, the high acidity and bad technological properties [143]. The reforming of bio-oil is a quite new topic and there are a lot of open problems related to carbon formation, low catalysts lifetime, presence of a water insoluble fraction, etc. The use of bimetallic systems is scarcely reported and only few examples are known. The addition of Ru to conventional Ni/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in higher hydrogen yield (up to 85%) with an increase of Ni phase dispersion [144]. A non noble metals promoted bimetallic system Ni(3%)Co(9%)/Ce x Zr1−x O2 was also effective and high activity and stability, with reduced coke deposition were reported [145]. The most relevant data (catalyst composition, reaction, advantages/disadvantages with respect to monometallic system, and ref.) of bimetallic catalysts employed in partial oxidation reactions are summarized in Table 2 ."
8,Hydrocarbons decomposition,"Non-oxidative catalytic decomposition of short linear hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, propane) is an alternative source for obtaining pure hydrogen from natural gas if compared to tradition SR, DR, and CPO processes [146]. Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon being the main component of natural gas. It has the highest H:C ratio, however, other hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane that are produced by other fuel feedstock (i.e., naphtha) could be considered for H2 production. For example, propane is cheap and easily available. In the European Union as well as in Russian Federation is already delivered in cylinders as domestic fuel and for vehicles at gas filling stations [147]. Moreover, hydrogen could be efficiently separated from propane (much more than methane) using simple membrane apparatus. Although the HDC allows the production of CO x -free hydrogen in one step (see Reaction (12)), the decomposition reaction is accompanied by the formation of nanofibrous carbon as byproducts [148]: (12) C x H y → xC+(y/2)H2 Among many different morphological carbon-based nanomaterials that can be created in the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons, the selective formation of high quality carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be exploited in a functional manner. Indeed, since the CNTs do not usually growth at the surface of the catalyst, they are available for easy separation and use in other applications. Larachi et al. have reported Ni:Cu/Al modified supported catalysts for the production of both pure hydrogen and CNTs at 673K from methane. Two catalyst samples were prepared: catalyst A with 3% Cu and 25% Ni and catalyst B with 3% Cu and 25% Ni and 1% K. Addition of Cu formed bimetallic surface, which hindered the production of reactive carbon resulting in CO x -free H2 but produced graphitic carbon, and C2–C3 hydrocarbons. Since the regenerative treatments restored the activity of Ni:Cu/Al catalyst to 70–80%, authors suggested that the carbon was mainly deposited as 3D structure leaving Ni:Cu catalytic active sites free. Moreover, Addition of K produced modified surface with an increased production of pure H2 (up to 40–45%) and increase in catalyst stability [149]. Recently, Monzon et al. have reported the use of bimetallic Ni–Co/Mg–Al catalyst for the methane decomposition reaction for the co-production of H2. The bimetallic Ni–Co/Mg–Al catalyst was stable at reaction temperatures below 853K. It was possible to produce hydrogen and CNTs in steady conditions, which is a critical factor for the industrial development of the process. This transition temperature depended on the catalyst composition, the feed composition (e.g. ratio hydrogen/methane) and the spatial velocity used in the reactor. The greater hydrogen productivity attained with the bimetallic catalyst operating at stable conditions was ca. 0.210g H2/gcat.h [150]. Huffman et al. have studied H2 production by catalytic decomposition of methane using instead the series of catalyst Fe (4.5%)–M (0.5%)/Al2O3 where M=Pd, Mo, Ni. All the supported Fe–M bimetallic catalysts reduced the methane decomposition temperature by 673–773K relative to non-catalytic thermal decomposition and exhibited significant higher activity than Fe or any of the secondary metals supported on alumina alone. In terms of activity, Pd–Fe appeared to be the most effective catalyst, achieving an exit stream H2 concentration of 80% at 973K against the 75% and 65% of Mo–Fe and Ni–Fe, respectively. The H2 production peak was approximately 85–90% in the temperature range 823–1073K for all samples. Absence of CO and C2 hydrocarbons in the reaction product indicated very high selectivity for the Fe-based bimetallic catalysts. The authors reported an additional study on the relationship between the reaction temperature and the form of carbon produced. In the temperature range 973–1073K, multiwalled CNTs were the dominant form of carbon presents. At higher temperatures, the activity of the bimetallic catalysts decreased and amorphous carbon, carbon flakes, and carbon fiber were observed [146]. Using a different approach, more recently Huffman and coworkers reported the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over Fe–Ni supported on Mg(Al)O to produce pure H2 and CNTs. The bimetallic catalyst showed its best catalytic behavior at 923K, at which temperature it was active for over 5h, yielding 65vol% H2, 10vol% CH4, and 25vol% unreacted ethane. In addition, they found that the CNTs formed over Fe–Ni/Mg(Al)O catalyst changed with temperature from stacked-cone CNTs (525K) to parallel-multiwalled CNTs (923K) [148]. Finally, it is worth mention to a recent report by Kuvshinov et al., whose produced H2 and nanofibrous carbon using propane as fuel source. In particular, they tested a series of bimetallic Ni–Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The Ni (50wt%)–Cu (40wt%)/SiO2 was found to be the most appropriate for hydrogen production by propane decomposition at 873K. Total hydrogen yield of 60.84mol H2/g cat (during 24h time on stream) and the total H2:CH4 ratio of 8.42 were shown to be attained with this catalyst. After removal of propane from reaction products the CO x -free mixture of hydrogen and methane containing more than 90 vol.% of hydrogen was obtained, which made this mixture suitable for PEMFC as fuel. Carbon nanofibers obtained by catalytic propane decomposition had stacked-cone structure as well as platelet structure with a wide distribution of carbon nanofiber diameters (10–500nm). The formation of branched and coiled nanofibers, carbon nanofibers ropes and nanofibers coated with pyrocarbon depending on the catalyst and the reaction temperature was observed [147]. The most relevant data (catalyst composition, reaction, advantages/disadvantages with respect to monometallic system, and ref.) of bimetallic catalysts employed in hydrocarbons decomposition reactions are summarized in Table 3 ."
9,Photo-reforming and water photo-splitting,"In addition to methods reported in other paragraph in this review, photocatalytic methods are particularly attractive since they enable to cope, at the same time, environmental concerns and energetic requirements by exploiting a renewable form of energy such as solar radiation, and renewable raw materials (water and/or biomass). Processes based on photocatalytic and photo-electrochemical water splitting as well as photoreforming processes, are viable solutions for a small and medium-size scale hydrogen production. Photocatalytic water splitting is an extremely promising route for the direct conversion of solar energy and water into hydrogen and oxygen [1]. Finally, photoreforming of organic (sacrificial) reagents (biomass processing derived products and/or byproducts) even being the less explored method is particularly attractive since it allows the simultaneous hydrogen generation and abatement of organic pollutants when polluted wastewater is used as a feedstock [151]. A large number of materials potentially suitable for photo (electro) catalytic hydrogen production have been reported in literature, and many excellent reviews are available [152,153]. In addition to the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts with tailored band structures, photogenerated charge separation is then another key issue strongly addressing the efficiency of the photocatalytic water-splitting process. When metallic (or bimetallic) nanoparticles are loaded onto the surface of the photocatalyst (i.e., TiO2), the photogenerated e− migrate to the TiO2 surface and are entrapped by the metal cocatalyst, thus preventing photogenerated e−–hole recombination and increasing the overall photocatalytic efficiency. Here, we only mentioned few recent examples on bimetallic photocatalyst that have been used for photocatalytic H2 production. For example, Hirakawa et al. have proposed a polymer protected Pt/Ru bimetallic cluster catalyst for visible light hydrogen production from the aqueous electron transfer system tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II) dichloride/methyl viologen dichloride/metal cluster/ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid sodium salt. They compared electron transfer and hydrogen generation rate constants (k e and k H 2 , respectively) for Pt, Ru, Pt and Ru physical mixture, and Pt/Ru bimetallic k e and k H 2 are in proportion and follow the same trend with the rate constants being in the order platinum monometallic<ruthenium monometallic<platinum–ruthenium physical mixture<platinum–ruthenium bimetallic [154]. In another study, Masahashi et al. reported the photochemical evolution of H2 from ethanol aqueous solution using core–shell Au/Pd (different molar ratio: 0/1, 1/3, 1/1, 3/1, 1/0) bimetallic nanoparticles immobilized on TiO2 support [155]. The bimetallic nanoparticles containing large amounts of Pd can accept electrons more effectively, as Pd has a larger work function than Au. However, in the presented study, the amounts of H2 did not increase linearly with the increase in Pd. Indeed the highest activity both under UV and visible irradiation was obtained with the catalyst composed by 1/3 molar ratio in Au/Pd. The good efficiency reported was ascribed to the morphology of the core–shell bimetallic nanoparticles: selective H2 permeability by the Pd–shell might contribute to the selective donation of photogenerated electrons to protons, and the resultant highly promoted photocatalysis of H2 from H2 ethanol solutions [155]. Differently, Dal Santo et al. studied both the effect of the nature of metal nanoparticles (bimetallic gold–platinum) loaded and the structural modification of the support (TiO2) in the photoreforming of ethanol and glycerol [156,157]. Specifically, Au1/TiO2, Pt1/TiO2, Au0.5–Pt0.5/TiO2 and Au1–Pt1/TiO2 (the number after each metal chemical symbol indicates the metal loading in wt%) materials were easily prepared by impregnation of nanosized amorphous TiO2, followed by oxidation and reduction treatments (523K, 773K in H2 flow). In general, H2 production was more considerable always for sample treated at 773K in H2 flow, probably for the higher crystallinity induced in the powder. Considering the ethanol photoreforming, they show that Au0.5–Pt0.5/TiO2 catalyst was the most active with a H2 production rate of 1700μmolg−1 h−1under solar simulated irradiation and 75mLg−1 under the visible light one. The latter was associated to the prominent role of reduced TiO2 in absorbing this portion of the light spectrum because the presence in its structure of oxygen vacancies [156]. Interestingly, when glycerol photoreforming was considered, the activities under visible light irradiation showed a unexpected trend. Efficiency of the process was lower in comparison with ethanol photoreforming because the higher amount of by-products that oxidation of glycerol gave. In addition, authors observed that the most active catalyst under visible light was Pt/TiO2 with Au/TiO2 and Au0.5–Pt0.5/TiO2 having almost the same H2 production rate. This particular trend was imputed to the role of surface plasmon resonance band of gold, which absorbs in the visible region and might be responsible for subtracting photons from the overall process [157]. The most relevant data (catalyst composition, reaction, advantages/disadvantages with respect to monometallic system, and ref.) of bimetallic catalysts employed in photo-reforming and water photo-splitting reactions are summarized in Table 4 ."
10,"Perspective: Future trends, key aspects, and open problems","Among the processes, aimed to hydrogen production, reported in this review, in the open literature, is evident that photocatalytic reactions (photo-reforming and water photo-splitting) are gaining major attention, while the “share” of traditional ones (i.e. SR, ATR/OSR, and PO), even if still consistent, is decreasing, as shown in Fig. 2 . This trend reflects the increased interests in “greener” technologies starting from renewable raw materials and renewable energy sources too, that is general in almost all the chemistry topics and, in particular in the catalysis and energy-related fields. Indeed, photocatalytic processes are very attractive since, in principle, they are fully sustainable, work at low temperature, are suitable for delocalized/remote applications. However, problems related to the real productivity, to the scale up to an industrial level, and to the efficiency, stability even of state-of-the-art materials are still open issues. The use of bimetallic systems (i.e., intended as supported bimetallic nanoparticles) even if interesting and showing appreciable performances seems not to be able to solve in a large extent the problems. On the other hand the shift, for traditional processes, from fossil to renewable raw materials (or at least from high quality fossil to low quality ones) could benefit from the use of bimetallic systems. The possibility to use, as base metal, non noble ones but “correcting” their defects (low activity and/or selectivity, short lifetime, scarce resistance to poisoning, etc.) by the addition of small amounts of noble ones, or even of other non noble metals seems a more realistic and promising approach. Bimetallic formulations appear as very active in preventing coke deposition, sulfur poisoning, excessive sintering that are typical problems causing the deactivation of catalysts and thus shortening their useful lifetime in a process. Moreover, the opportunity to lower reaction temperature, to increase selectivity to desired products and preventing undesired parasitic pathways leading to wastes/byproducts are, by matter of facts, other very valuable characteristic typical of bimetallic systems. The shortening of traditional fossil resources often imposes the use of low quality oils, tars, etc. that even increase problems related to deactivation and poisoning. Also the use of highly functionalized, complex biomass-derived raw materials opens new problems related to their stability against unwanted decompositions/reactions and/or to their low reactivity. All these new issues require the development of highly active, selective and durable catalysts The advantage of using bimetallic formulation clearly emerged from the perusal of examples here reported, and, in most cases the preparation methodologies, the characterization of the resulting materials are at state-of-the-art level. However, this trend is not a general rule and many systems are still prepared by means of very simple methods that cannot easily guarantee NPs truly bimetallic and with homogeneous composition. Often the understanding of the structure of the metal phase is usually carried out by standard techniques that provide only indirect proofs/information about the degree of interaction and the structure of bimetallic catalysts. The simple, but at the same time very complex, question “how is made?”, that almost every chemist have faced in his/her life needs still a complete answer in many reported cases of bimetallic catalysts. The use of advanced characterization techniques, such as microdiffractions, HRTEM, XAS, etc. could improve significantly the level of description of the bimetallic nanostructures. Finally joining together all these data will allow a rational design of the materials, preventing time consuming trial and error approaches, in this sense also modeling and theoretical tools can give important contributions. A cross fertilization by introducing methodologies typical of material science, and of nanoscience is strongly advisable since it could afford valuable advances. Summarizing, the use of bi-(poli)-metallic systems undoubtedly represent a clear advantage in most of the hydrogen generation processes, both the standard and the emerging ones, however, in order to fully exploit their real potential by a rational design approach, some actions are still to be done with the appropriate intensity (i.e., use of ad-hoc preparation methodology and of advanced characterization tools)."
11,Conclusions,"Examples reported in this review clearly show how the use of polymetallic, mainly bimetallic, catalysts allows to obtain improved performances like activity, selectivity and durability in almost all reactions and processes related to hydrogen production. The kind of effect exerted by the metal(s) added as promoter is strongly related to the structure of the supported metal phases. When the interaction between the different metals is low, as it occurs in heterostructures (i.e. purely monometallic NPs, with no or very low contact between each other) the principal effect is cooperative: each metal promotes, in a concerted way, one kind of reactive act (C–C/C–O cleavage, dehydrogenation, WGS, etc.) in some cases reaching good to excellent final catalytic performances in terms of activity and selectivity. When the interaction between metals is stronger, as occurs in “true” bimetallic NPs, the picture is more complex: geometric and electronic effects can occur strongly influencing, also in this case, determinant reaction steps (adsorption/desorption of reactant/intermediates/poisons/products; gasification, oxidation, WGS reactions) and/or important physical–chemical properties of NPs, like reducibility, C solubility, SMSI, etc. Whatsoever was the real mechanism underlying the action of metal(s) promoter(s) the final results are in most cases excellent: typical problems related to the reactions and/or processes aimed to hydrogen productions can be successfully solved: deactivation phenomena like coke deposition; active metal phase oxidation, sintering, and segregation are almost suppressed thank to the positive effects originated from metals interactions. However, even if in most examples the superior performances of bimetallic catalysts are evident in comparison with parent monometallic systems, there is a general lack of a detailed characterization of the active bimetallic phase. This aspect is crucial for the rational design of state of the art systems since, in principle, by structure–properties correlation approach it could give an important contribution in the rational development of improved catalysts. Another important factor is the dynamic behavior of the bimetallic nanoparticles that depends on the surrounding gas environment (i.e. local (at microscopic level) reaction conditions) that is an hint in developing in situ and/or operando characterization techniques able to work under severe reaction conditions typical, for example, of SCT-CPO or OSR/ATR reactions. Finally, the potential of bimetallic NPs was evidenced not only for processes that are diffused in several industrial applications (i.e., hydrocarbons SR or catalytic partial oxidation) but even for reactions that are very promising, even if far from any short-time application in industrial processes, like the hydrogen production by photo-reforming and water photo-splitting."
