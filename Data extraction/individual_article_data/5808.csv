0,Introduction,"With declining resources and increasing demands for petroleum, there has been great interest in the production of energy from biomass and the effective utilization of furanose materials, which arise from the acid-catalyzed dehydration of pentose and hexose, to produce valuable chemicals [1]. Furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2, furan–methylene–hydroxyl, FA) has been considered as an important commodity and building block from which more complicated chemicals can be made. It is industrially produced via hydrogenation of furfural (C5H4O2, furan-aldehyde), which in turn is made from xylose (C5H10O5) by selective dehydration. FA can be converted to levulinic acid (C5H8O3, LA), which is another platform chemical for various interesting derivatives such as alkyl levulinate [2,3], succinic acid [4], and, γ-valerolactone [5]. On the other hand, the polymerized furfuryl alcohol (PFA), which is synthesized by the acid-catalyzed condensation of monomeric FA has also been studied extensively due to its application in synthesizing molecular sieve adsorbents, membranes, and components for electrochemical and electronic devices [6–13] (see Scheme 1 ). The formation of both polymers (PFA) and levulinic acid from FA is thermodynamically favorable (Eqs. (1)–(3)) [14]. Therefore it is essential to obtain molecular level understanding of these processes to optimize the production of polymers or LA. At high concentration of FA, polymerization is the dominant reaction over formation of LA due to the reaction kinetics [15]. Dimer formation: (1) C5H5O+ +C5H6O2 →2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-furfuryl)furan)ΔG =−39.7kJmol−1 Conjugated diene formation: (2) C14H12O3 +C5H5O+ →C5H6O2 +H+ +C14H10O3 ΔG =−47.7kJmol−1 (3) FA +H2O→ LA Previously, we have investigated the reaction mechanism of FA polymerization in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions via a combined Raman spectroscopic and density functional study. This study has shown that the polymeric material formed during the acid-catalyzed conversion is a conjugated diene with furan rings [14]. The polymerization reaction is initiated by protonation of the primary hydroxyl group and subsequent formation of a primary carbocation, FA carbocation (C4H3O–CH2 +). We hypothesize that organic solvents, which can react with FA carbocations or solvate either the FA cation or monomer will moderate FA polymerization by establishing a competition between FA +carbocation− FA and FA +carbocation−Solvent reactions. In this paper, for quantitative and qualitative comparison, we have employed UV Raman vibrational spectroscopy to establish the effects of organic solvent addition on the polymerization of FA to PFA. During the reaction, we collected Raman spectra and analyzed the fingerprint bands, such as CC (furan ring) and CC (exocyclic), in the range 1100–1800cm−1."
1,Experimental,"Furfuryl alcohol (98%), sulfuric acid (99.999%), ethanol (99.5%), n-butanol (ACS reagent grade), and iso-butanol (ACS reagent grade) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and used without further purification. The FA was mixed with an alcohol and dilute sulfuric acid catalyst (1M) to produce PFA. Raman spectra were collected using a Raman microscope (Renishaw, inVia™). UV excitation at 325nm was supplied by a He–Cd laser (Kimmon Laser) with about 2mW delivered to the sample. All Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature and ambient pressure. The Raman spectrometer was equipped with an optical microscope (Leica DM), which was used to both focuses the laser and collect the back-scattered Raman signal. Typical spectral acquisition parameters were 10–30 scans accumulated at 10–40s per scan."
2,Results and discussion,
3,Visual observation,"3.1 Visual observation The effect of organic solvent at various FA/Solvent ratios on the polymerization was monitored by color changes during the reaction. Table 1 presents the moles of reactant, solvent, catalyst, molar ratio of FA/Solvent, used in the experiments, and peak intensity ratios (I 1654/1504). The color changes of samples FS1–FS4 (no ethanol addition) and FES7–FES10 (with ethanol addition) left to polymerize over a period of 6h are shown in Fig. 1 . Without the addition of ethanol solvent (FS1–FS4), the original yellowish FA changed to greenish and light brown opaque solutions in 2h, while FES7–FES10 samples colors were not changed. The FA polymerization reaction is indicated when this yellowish color solution becomes opaque and viscosity increases. Up to 3h, the FS1 (FAmol%=90.9) sample's color was a little lighter than samples FS2–FS4 (FAmol%>92.1). This result suggests that a marginal difference of FA concentration can change the polymerization rate. After 3h, the FS1–FS4 samples began to change to dark brown and then to black as the reaction time reached 6h. The FES7–FES9 samples’ color slowly changed to green after 3h and became brown after 6h. Because the change of color is associated with the formation of conjugated double bonds, a visual observation of the samples indicates that the addition of increasing amounts of ethanol significantly reduces the FA polymerization reaction rate."
4,Raman spectroscopy,"3.2 Raman spectroscopy 3.2.1 Ethanol effect on FA polymerization In order to quantify the effect of ethanol on the FA polymerization reaction, the polymerization behavior of FA without ethanol was first investigated with different FA concentrations (FS1 and FS4). The Raman spectra over the 1300–1800cm−1 range monitor the time dependence of FA polymerization with FS1 and FS4 as shown in Fig. 2 . UV excitation was used to eliminate an overwhelming fluorescence background that is present using visible laser excitation [16–22]. The spectrum obtained using visible excitation at 632.8nm is dominated by fluorescence, whereas the UV Raman spectra show sharp bands with a good signal to noise ratio (see dashed rectangle box in Fig. 2) Prior to polymerization of FA, a strong Raman band was present at 1504cm−1, which is characteristic of the symmetric CC stretching bands of the aromatic furan functional group [14,16]. It is one of the key bands for monitoring the FA polymerization reaction. In the case of FS1 and FS4, which contain relatively high concentrations of FA (mol%>90%) compared to water (mol%<10%), the band intensity at 1504cm−1 decreases quickly with time during the FA polymerization reaction, while new bands are observed at 1529 and 1556cm−1 (weak) and at 1654cm−1 (strong). The strong band at 1654cm−1 is assigned to the exocyclic CC bond in a conjugated diene structure which has delocalized π bonds [14]. The peak intensity ratio for 1654 and 1504cm−1 (I 1654/I 1504) shows that the intensity ratio of sample FS1 is ∼2 times lower than FS4 at ∼3h. The higher intensity ratio can be attributed to a higher FA molar ratio, which is consistent with the visible observation. At ∼1h, the intensity of the exocyclic CC band is significantly higher than that of the endocyclic CC ring stretching bands, which essentially disappear after 6h. This suggests that a majority of the FA monomers were converted to FA oligomers or polymers. In addition to the FA polymer, we can expect the formation of LA product during the acid catalyzed hydrolysis (or ethanolysis) [23]. However, we could not observe a strong CH stretching band at ∼2900cm−1 [16]. It is conceivable that the FA concentration and reaction temperature were not optimal to produce LA. By visual observation of the solution color changes described in the previous section, we showed that the addition of ethanol can reduce the FA polymerization reaction rate. The Raman spectra support this conclusion. The effect of ethanol solvent on the extent of acid-catalyzed FA polymerization at ∼3h reaction time is shown in Fig. 3 . Up to a FA/EtOH molar ratio of ∼0.8 (FES1–FES6) Raman spectra do not show a noticeable exocyclic CC band at ∼1654cm−1. Above a FA/EtOH molar ratio of ∼1, a weak intensity exocyclic CC band was observed. Using FES7 sample, the peak intensity ratio (I 1654/I 1504) is ∼0.3, which is ∼29 times lower than the FS4 sample's value, ∼8.7. The peak intensity ratio (I 1654/I 1504) continuously increases with increasing FA/EtOH molar ratio at similar reaction times. This result shows that increasing the ethanol mol% reduces polymerization. In addition to the effect on I 1654/I 1504, it was also observed that the I 884/I 1504 intensity ratio decreases with increasing FA concentration and remains low even at a higher ethanol molar ratio (∼88.7mol%). Since no reaction between ethanol and FA or ethanol and SA was observed, we conclude that the decreased I 884/I 1504 intensity ratio is due to the effect of self-absorption on the Raman intensity [24]. This conclusion was supported by reference experiments and is discussed later (Fig. 5). From a kinetics point of view, if the reaction order for polymerization (C FA α) is greater than the reaction order for LA product formation (C FA β), then the concentration of FA should be as low as possible to avoid polymerization. In the absence of noticeable LA formation, we hypothesize that FA polymerization is a second-order reaction and the derivation is included in Appendix A. The combined rate law and mole balance is shown in Eq. (4). (4) − r FA = k FA * C FA 2 = − d C FA / d t 1 / C FA − 1 / C FA 0 = k t o r 1 / C FA = k t + 1 / C FA 0 A plot of the inverse I 1504cm−1 intensity as a function of time is shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) with the determined kinetic parameters (k) for a second-order reaction. The plot of 1/I 1504cm−1 vs. time is linear, consistent with a second-order reaction, and the second-order rate coefficients decrease with increasing ethanol concentration. The rate coefficient for FS1 is higher than values for the FES series. To confirm the absence of reactions with the solvent, (i) FA +ethanol and (ii) ethanol+ SA, reference experiments were carried out with these mixtures as a function of time and clearly reveal no side reactions (Fig. 5 ). Quantification of the Raman bands assigned to CC (884cm−1, ethanol) and CC (1504cm−1, FA) in FE1 and FE2 shows that when the FA concentration increased by 2×, the peak intensity ratio (I 1504/I 884) increased by ∼1.86. This result indicates that the FA concentration can be quantified by comparing the intensity of strong Raman bands. Recently, Lange et al. reported ∼80% yield of ethyl levulinate by acid catalyzed (sulfuric acid) ethanolysis of FA using ∼0.37 FA/EtOH molar ratios at 125°C [24]. The authors also claimed that decreasing FA/EtOH molar ratios did not improve the ethyl levulinate yield. In Table 1, we show that from 0.38 to lower FA/EtOH molar ratios no polymerized FA was observed for up to 3h (I 1654/I 1504 ≈0). Although the published experimental conditions were not same as our present study, we have shown that the FA/EtOH molar ratio is one of key parameters for controlling the FA conversion. 3.2.2 n-Butanol and iso-Butanol effect on the FA polymerization Visual observation and quantitative Raman spectroscopy show a strong dependence of the FA polymerization reactions on the presence of added ethanol. Thus we decided to study the FA polymerization reaction in different solvents, n-butanol and iso-butanol. As shown in Fig. 6 , the Raman intensity ratios increase linearly with the reaction time for samples containing n-butanol or iso-butanol with similar values. Based on the I 1654/I 1504 intensity ratio it is evident that both n-butanol and iso-butanol can reduce the FA polymerization rate more effectively than ethanol at the same solvent concentration. This can be explained by the higher basicity of butanol compared to ethanol, although the difference is small, ∼0.1 in pKb. Because the polymerization reactions require a strong acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, alcohol's proton affinity (PA) should be considered to explain the polymerization reaction rate. Table S1 (Supporting material) summarizes the calculated gas phase PA values. The gas phase proton affinity of butanol is marginally higher than ethanol, which suggests that the hydroxyl group of butanol binds protons more strongly than ethanol. This assumption is supported by a calculation of free energy changes for protonation of ethanol, n-butanol, and iso-butanol clusters (trimers, Scheme S1 of supporting information). Additionally steric hindrance may play an important role in controlling the initial protonation and hence the reaction rate. Recently, Otto et al. have suggested that even a single solvent molecule can affect the dynamics and reaction rates of substitution reactions through steric effects [25]. Compared to ethanol, when the more bulky butanol is hydrogen bonded to FA, it may more efficiently block access of H+ to the OH group of FA, inhibiting the first step in the polymerization reaction. A schematic representation of the likely hydrogen and proton–oxygen bonding structures is shown in Scheme 2 . The influence of organic solvents on the FA polymerization rate suggests that the rate of carbocation formation (acid catalyzed dehydration) can be reduced through hydrogen bonding and shielding effects by organic solvents. As a result, the FA monomer can be protected against protonation more efficiently by an organic solvent (solvation shell effect). Furthermore, with increasing n-butanol and iso-butanol concentration, the I 1654/I 1504 ratio decreased at comparable FA polymerization reaction times, analogous to the FES1 and FES2 Raman spectra. The results presented here showed that the FA polymerization rate decreases in the following order: FS series>FES series>FBS>FiBS."
5,Conclusions,"Visual observation and quantitative UV-Raman experiments were performed for the industrially relevant acid-catalyzed furfuryl alcohol polymerization reaction using various alcohol solvents. At a given acid concentration (1M H2SO4), the polymerization increases with the FA/EtOH molar ratio indicating that the higher furfuryl alcohol concentration favors the polymerization reaction. The linearity of inverse endocyclic CC band intensity vs. reaction time suggests second-order polymerization kinetics. The calculated reaction rate constant, k, shows that a lower FA/EtOH molar ratio efficiently inhibits carbocation formation. At room temperature, no side reactions between reactants, (i) FA +ethanol and (ii) ethanol+ SA, were observed. Compared to the ethanol, both n-butanol and iso-butanol solvents further reduce the FA polymerization rate due to a shielding effect."
