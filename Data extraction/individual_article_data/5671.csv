0,Introduction,"In recent years, renewable energy source has been attracting more attentions due to the exhausting un-renewable fossil fuel [1–4]. The energy development will be towards the transition from hydrocarbon energy to hydrogen energy in the future. Hydrogen as an energy carrier has some advantages, for instance, clean, storable, renewable properties and zero emission of pollutants. It is one of the effective approaches for the production of hydrogen through photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant in the industrial waste water. It was reported that Pt/TiO2 as a photocatalyst degraded alcohol, formic acid, formaldehyde and oxalic acid to produce hydrogen under ultraviolet and Xe-arc lamp irradiations [5,6]. In order to enhance the utilization of solar energy, it is necessary for us to study a novel type of catalyst having high visible light photocatalytic activities. In this paper, the CdS/Al-HMS photocatalyst was firstly synthesized by use of cheap sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) as aluminum source to prepare aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieve (Al-HMS) with high specific surface area and subsequently assemble the CdS clusters inside the channels of Al-HMS via the sequential reactions of ion exchange and sulfurization. Meanwhile, a series of Pt- and Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts were synthesized and the activities of hydrogen production were evaluated in an aqueous formic acid solution under visible light irradiation. Formic acid, as a usual pollutant in water resulting from some industrial processes, was chosen as a model pollutant here to achieve the dual goals of eliminated pollutant (formic acid) with simultaneous production of hydrogen in the photocatalytic process."
1,Experimental section,
2,Preparation of photocatalyst,"2.1 Preparation of photocatalyst 2.1.1 Synthesis of Al-HMS molecular sieve In a typical procedure, a solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in absolute ethanol was dripped into a solution which consists of dodecylamine (DDA) and sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) in ethanol under vigorous stirring at 40°C for 2h. The molar ratio of the reactants in this mixture was 0.5 TEOS:6.5 EtOH:0.02 NaAlO2:0.13 DDA:33.2 H2O. The reaction mixture was then aged at 40°C for 24h. Subsequently, the resultant was filtrated and washed thoroughly with water, dried at 105°C for 2h, and calcined at 540°C for 6h to remove the surfactant [7]. 2.1.2 Incorporation of CdS into Al-HMS molecular sieve Al-HMS molecular sieve (1.00g) was added into an aqueous solution of 0.1M NH4NO3 (30mL) and refluxed at 100°C for 5h to ensure efficient ion exchange of Na+ with NH4 +. The product was collected by filtration and washed several times with deionized water, 0.06M HCl, 0.06M NaOH and deionized water respectively [8,9]. The product obtained above was added to a solution of 0.1M CdCl2 (30mL) and stirred at 40°C for 2h. The resulting product was filtrated and washed extensively with deionized water until cadmium ion was not detected in solution. Finally the filtrate cake was added to 0.1M of thiourea (30mL) and stirred at 70°C for 2h. After filtration and washing, the powders were dried at 110°C for 2h. X-ray fluorescence spectrum found that the sample contains 1.95wt.% Cd and 0.52wt.%S, the atom ratio of Cd to S is close to 1, the loaded CdS is ca. 2.5wt.% (the sample was designated as CdS/Al-HMS). The bulk CdS was prepared by the reaction of 0.1M CdCl2 and 0.1M thiourea at 70°C for 2h. 2.1.3 Synthesis of Pt- and Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts Pt- and Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the CdS/Al-HMS with solutions of H2PtCl6⋅6H2O and RuCl3⋅xH2O in a mixture of benzene and ethanol (4:1v/v), respectively [10]. In correspondence to their metal loading contents, the Pt-series materials were designated as 0.17Pt/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.34Pt/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.63Pt/CdS/Al-HMS, 1.3Pt/CdS/Al-HMS, 1.7Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and 3.9Pt/CdS/Al-HMS. Meanwhile, the Ru-series materials were designated as 0.07Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.16Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.21Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, 0.34Ru/CdS/Al-HMS and 1.0Ru/CdS/Al-HMS, respectively. The loading contents of metals were measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis. The samples were reduced in H2 at 300°C for 2h before the photocatalytic reactions."
3,Analysis technique,"2.2 Analysis technique X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CdS/Al-HMS samples were measured on an X'pert MPD Pro an X-ray diffractiometer equipped a rotation anode using CuKα irradiation (λ =0.15418nm). UV–Visible Diffuse reflectance Spectra (UVDRS) of the samples were recorded on a HITACHI UV-4100 spectrophotometer. Elemental Analysis was carried out on a Bruker S4 PIONEER X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF). Specific surface area of CdS/Al-HMS sample was measured on a Beckman Coulter SA3100 instrument with N2 as an absorbent at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K) [11]. The high resolution image of sample was obtained on a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fluorescence emission spectra (FES) were recorded on an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and a 150W xenon lamp was used as excitation light source with an excitation wavelength of 320nm."
4,Photocatalytic reaction,"2.3 Photocatalytic reaction Typically, 0.2g of sample powder was suspended in 200mL of aqueous formic acid solution (H2O:HCOOH=4:1, in volume) in a Pyrex flask with a flat window. A 350W xenon lamp equipped with a special cutoff filter to remove ultraviolet illumination (λ <420nm) was used as the light source. The solution was purged with nitrogen for 30min to remove the dissolved oxygen before the visible light irradiation. The gas products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Beifen SP-2100) equipped with a TDX01 column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The apparent quantum yield was measured using a band-pass filter to obtain the incident visible light (420±5nm) and calculated using the following equation. The apparent quantum yield (%)=[(the number of reacted electrons)/(the number of incident photons)]×100%=[(the number of evolved H2 molecules×2)/(the number of incident photons)]×100% [12,13]."

6,Characterization of CdS/Al-HMS sample,"3.1 Characterization of CdS/Al-HMS sample N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Al-HMS and CdS/Al-HMS samples belong to Langmuir IV type in Fig. 1 . The adsorption steps concentrating at the relative pressure (P/P 0) less than 0.5 indicate the presence of regular mesoporous framework-confined mesopores, and the well-defined hysteresis loops in the range of P/P 0 =0.5~1.0 imply the existence of textural mesopores. The framework-confined porosity results from the neutral template pathway, whereas the textural meso-porosity arises from the interparticle pores [7,14]. Some framework pores and textural pores of Al-HMS have been filled with CdS clusters causing the intensity decrease of the isotherms of CdS/Al-HMS. Table 1 summarize the physical parameters of samples, such as, specific surface area (S BET), total pore volume (V total), framework mesopore volume (V fr), textural mesopore volume (V tex) and the ratio of textural to framework volume (V tex/V fr). The Al-HMS sample displays the highest specific surface area (815.6m2/g) and the lowest ratio of V tex/V fr. With the embedment of CdS inside the channels of Al-HMS, the BET surface area of the Al-HMS decreases dramatically (from 815.6 to 595.3m2/g), and there is a rise in V tex/V fr ratio, suggesting that the Al-HMS framework has been significantly changed. Fig. 2 exhibits the low angle X-ray scattering patterns. It can be observed that the Al-HMS sample shows a strong broad single diffraction peak at 2θ=2.3° with the d 100 spacing of 3.848nm (Fig. 2a) and the CdS/Al-HMS sample gives a medium strong broad single diffraction peak at 2θ=2.4° with the d 100 value of 3.871nm (Fig. 2b), respectively. The d 100 unit cell parameters from the formula [15] a 0 =2d100/ 3 are 4.45nm for Al-HMS and 4.48nm for CdS/Al-HMS. The assembly of CdS clusters into the channels of Al-HMS slightly expands the lattice space, probably due to the some CdS clusters anchors to the defect sites in the pore wall. However, the decrease of the intensity of (100) diffraction peak for CdS/Al-HMS sample should be ascribed to the decrease of the scattering contrast between the pores and the walls as a result of partial mesopores filled with CdS nanocomposites. The XRD patterns of bulk CdS, Al-HMS and CdS/Al-HMS samples are depicted in Fig. 3 . The Al-HMS sample exhibits a broad amorphous SiO2 diffraction peak in the range of 2θ=15~35° (Fig. 3b). The diffraction pattern for the CdS/Al-HMS (Fig. 3c) is similar to that of Al-HMS without the diffraction peaks of CdS. It can be inferred that the average diameter of CdS is less than 4nm, or that the CdS at 2.5wt.% low loading level in the form of clusters is highly dispersed within the channels of Al-HMS. The growth of CdS nanoclusters inside channels of Al-HMS is further characterized by UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in Fig. 4 . It can be observed that the pure Al-HMS sample doesn't show any absorption band in the ultraviolet and visible ranges (Fig. 4c). The absorption edge of CdS/Al-HMS sample is about 504nm in Fig. 4b, which is blue-shifted about 90nm relative to the bulk CdS (594nm) in Fig. 4a resulting from the quantum size effect of CdS nanoparticles [16]. Some structural information on the effect of CdS incorporation into Al-HMS can be obtained from high resolution TEM images for the samples (Fig. 5 ). The Al-HMS sample in Fig. 5a and b shows wormhole-like mesoporous framework with average pore diameter of 3–4nm and the run-through of wormhole-like channels branching within the framework, is similar to HMS [15]. The lack of the long-range order for the HMS sample can be ascribed to the weak hydrogen-bonding forces that govern the neutral S0I0 assembly processes [17]. After incorporating CdS clusters inside the channels of Al-HMS, the distinguishing feature of the framework for Al-HMS is still remained in Fig. 5c. This suggests that the average size of the CdS nanoparticles is close to the pore diameter of wormhole-like mesoporous framework. Some authors reported that the extremely small particles of CdS at low loading levels can be formed within the zeolite cages [18,19]. The emission spectra of the samples excited by an excitation wavelength of 320nm are shown in Fig. 6 . The Bulk CdS displays a weakly broad fluorescence peak at 540nm in Fig. 6f and it is much clearer after ten-time enlargement (the right top of Fig. 6). Whereas CdS/Al-HMS sample displays a strongest photoluminescence peak at 500nm in Fig. 6a, which is blue-shifted about 40nm compared with bulk CdS, as a result of the quantum size effect. The size dependence of the trapped fluorescence arising from the surface states has been reported in literature [20]. For platinum and ruthenium loaded over CdS/Al-HMS catalysts, the fluorescence profiles are similar to that of CdS/Al-HMS from Fig. 6b to e, but the intensity of fluorescence decreases with increase of metal loading, suggesting that the Pt and Ru clusters has been selectively loaded on the surface of CdS nanoparticles which hampered the absorption of CdS in the visible region."
7,Photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation,"3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation Figs. 7 and 8 show the photocatalytic reaction profiles of H2 evolution for Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS samples by photocatalytic formic acid degradation under visible light irradiation. The sample, 0.34Pt/CdS/Al-HMS, exhibits the highest H2 evolution activity at a rate of 7.63mLh−1 with the apparent quantum yield of 2% at 420nm (Fig. 7b). It is supposed by calculation that the Pt clusters supported on the surface of CdS nanoparticles with the coverage of 3%. Meanwhile, much higher photocatalytic activities of the series of Pt/CdS/Al-HMS samples than those of Ru samples attribute to that platinum has higher redox potential and the highest work function among metal elements. All of the samples in our investigation are not able to decompose pure water and only photocatalytically split formic acid to produce hydrogen. There are several factors contributed to the high activities and stabilities of Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts for generation of hydrogen. Firstly, the nanosize CdS particles inside the Al-HMS channels with high surface areas can promote the H2 evolution. It has been reported that the higher hydrogen evolution rate under ultraviolet irradiation was attributed to the smaller particle of the CdS clusters encapsulated in the cage of type A and LZ-Y52 zeolites [21]. In our case, the average particle size of CdS encapsulated inside Al-HMS is about 3nm as TEM analysis shown in Fig. 5. Secondly, the increases of luminescence intensities and blue shifts of Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS samples (in Fig. 6) imply that the quantities of surface states including dangling bonds, defect sites and traps are increase with the size decrease of CdS nanoparticles [20], and strong interaction between these active species and Pt clusters accelerate hydrogen evolution. And then, the slightly bigger textural mesoporosities for Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS (Table 1) facilitate the reactant molecules access to the framework-confined mesopores and accelerate the diffusion of formic acid molecules into solid-phase of photocatalyst. This assumption is further substantiated by the fact that the 0.34PtCdS/Al-HMS sample possessing the biggest V tex/V fr ratio (Table 1) shows the highest H2 evolution rate among all samples (Figs. 7 and 8). Finally, the trait of wormhole-like mesoporous structure of Al-HMS (Fig. 5) retains the uniform dispersions of CdS inside the channels of Al-HMS, and also the aluminum silicate framework serves as matrix and stabilizes the embedded CdS nanoparticles under ambient conditions. After CdS/Al-HMS sample is irradiated by visible light (λ ≥420 nm), photogenerated electrons on the valence band of CdS semiconductor transfer to its conduction band by overcoming the band gap energy of 2.5eV (calculated from Fig. 4) [22]. The photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of CdS nanoparticles can spontaneously transfer to the surface of noble metal Pt because the noble metal Pt possesses a higher work function and a lower Fermi energy level than that of n-type CdS nano-semiconductor, Consequently, abundantly negative charges accumulate on the surface of Pt and excessively positive charges accumulate on the surface of CdS due to the Schottky barrier generated on the interface between Pt and CdS. Platinum acts as an electron trap which can fleetly seizure photogenerated electrons and subsequently transfers electrons to H+ ions so that the activity of H2 evolution can be enhanced. By the way, CdS is not stable in aqueous solution under light irradiation and undergoes light etching effect as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) [21,23]. (1) CdS → hv h + +e - (2) CdS + 2h + → Cd 2 + + S To improve its stability, One way is that formic acid (E0 CO2/HCOOH =−0.126V [24] ) was employed as an electron donor to trap the holes on the valence band of CdS and to avoid the occurrence of light etching reaction (2) as shown in Eq. (3). (3) HCOOH + 2 h + → CO 2 + 2 H + The other is that incorporation of CdS nanoparticles into wormhole-like channels of Al-HMS protects CdS from exposure to air and reduces the amount of light absorption. It is noteworthy that CdS/Al-HMS, Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS samples show quite high stabilities in aqueous formic acid solution without suffering any photocorrosion monitored by XRD."
8,Conclusion,CdS/Al-HMS and a series of Pt- and Ru-loaded CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts were prepared. Low angle X-ray scattering patterns showed that the CdS nanoparticles were embedded inside the matrix of Al-HMS. The intercalation of CdS nanoparticles into the wormhole-like channels of Al-HMS led to the blue-shifted of UV–Visible adsorption edge of CdS/Al-HMS sample due to quantum size effect. TEM results demonstrated that the wormhole-like mesoporous framework of Al-HMS still remains after the incorporation of the CdS nanoparticles. The series of Pt/CdS/Al-HMS and Ru/CdS/Al-HMS photocatalysts show much higher photocatalytic activities of H2 evolution than that of bulk CdS from decomposition of formic acid under visible light irradiation due to the fast transference of photogenerated electrons and the efficient separation of photogenerated charge-carriers.
