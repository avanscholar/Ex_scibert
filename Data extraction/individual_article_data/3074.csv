0,Introduction,"Emissions of CO2 have been linked to the phenomenon of global warming, and thus there is an urgent need to reduce these. Fixation CO2 through photosynthesis of microalgae is considered as one of the most promising way to mitigate CO2 emissions and the resulting microalgal biomass can be used as feedstock for biofuels production or for other applications, such as in wastewater treatment, aquacultural feed, human and animal food, pigment production, heavy metals removal [1–7]. Chlorella vulgaris is a fast-growing green microalga, which can achieve a lipid content of up to 30–40% per dry weight under natural conditions [3]. Some C. vulgaris strains are also found to accumulate carbohydrates (in terms of starch and cellulose) at a large amount [8], thus having the potential to serve as feedstock for the production of biofuels or bio-based chemicals via fermentation [9]. A carbohydrate-rich microalga C. vulgaris ESP6 was recently isolated from Southern Taiwan. Preliminary tests show that the microalgal biomass has a glucose and xylose content of up to 51% and 6%, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, the microalga seems to have potential as third generation feedstock for fermentative production of biofuels. Most studies on microalgae-based biofuels focused on conversion of microalgal lipid to biodiesel, whereas much fewer efforts were made on using microalgae-based sugar for alcohols or hydrogen production [10]. Considering hydrogen is a clean energy carrier [11,12] and dark fermentation is one of the most environmentally benign methods of producing hydrogen [13], it is of great interest to convert the sugar-rich microalgal biomass into hydrogen through dark fermentation, since it is known that some anaerobic acid-forming bacteria or facultative anaerobes could effectively convert sugar (glucose or sucrose) into biohydrogen [14–16]. Clostridium butyricum is an anaerobic acid-forming bacterium, and is one of the well known hydrogen-producing bacterial consortia, which is very effective in producing hydrogen from organic substrates, especially carbohydrates [17]. In addition to the bacterial strains and substrates, there are some factors that affect hydrogen production, such as temperature and pH [18]. In order to improve hydrogen production performance, all of these factors need to be optimized. In this work, the isolated microalga C. vulgaris ESP6 was grown by fixing CO2 and the resulting microalgal biomass containing high carbohydrates content was subsequently used as the substrate for hydrogen production using an effective sugar-utilizing bioH2 producer C. butyricum CGS5 recently isolated from our laboratory [17]. The factors affecting the conversion of Chlorella biomass during hydrolysis were investigated. In addition, the conditions for hydrogen production from the microalgal biomass by the C. butyricum strain were also optimized. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of using the so-called third generation feedstock (i.e., microalgae) for biohydrogen production."
1,Materials and methods,
2,Microbial strains and cultivation,"2.1 Microbial strains and cultivation The microalga, C. vulgaris ESP6, was isolated from freshwater area in Southern Taiwan. The microalgal strain was cultivated photoautotrophically on Bold's basal medium [19] at room temperature for seven days under the illumination with fluorescent lamps (light intensity = 125 μmol/m2/s). Pure CO2 mixed with air was used as the carbon source for microalgal growth. The resulting gas contained 2% CO2 was aerated into the medium. The bacterial hydrogen producer, Clostridium butyricum CGS5, was also isolated by our laboratory [17]. The medium for its cultivation consisted of (g/L): NaHCO3, 6.72; NH4HCO3, 5.24; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2‧6H2O, 0.1; MnSO4‧6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4‧7H2O, 0.025; CuSO4‧5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2‧5H2O, 1.25 × 10−4; thioglycolate, 0.5; l-cystein, 0.5; Resazurin-2127, 0.001. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 with 5N HCl. The temperature for cultivation was controlled 37 °C."
3,Hydrolysis of the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6,"2.2 Hydrolysis of the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6 The biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6 (containing up to 57% carbohydrate content) was harvested by centrifugation at 6600 rpm for 3 min. The harvested microalgal biomass was first treated with HCl or NaOH under autoclave condition (121 °C for 20 min). The concentration of HCl ranged from 1.0 to 3.0% and NaOH from 4 to 15 g/L were used to determine the optimal pretreatment conditions. To improve the conversion of biomass hydrolysis, the microalgal biomass pretreated with 6–8 g/L NaOH and 0.2% H2O2 in autoclave was further hydrolyzed by 120 U/ml of endo-glucanase produced from Clostridium sp. TCW1 [20]. The condition for enzymatic hydrolysis was 60 °C and 200 rpm for 24 h or 48 h. After hydrolysis, the mixture was centrifuged to remove the residue cell pellets. The supernatant was then used as the substrate for hydrogen production after estimating the reducing sugar (RS) concentration by the dinitrosalicylic reagent method [21]. The biomass concentrations used in the hydrolysis tests with HCl and NaOH were 1 and 5 g/L, respectively."
4,Biohydrogen production procedures,"2.3 Biohydrogen production procedures The initial conditions for biohydrogen production were pH of 7.0, temperature of 37 °C, and microalgal biomass hydrolysate containing 9 g/L reducing sugar (RS). To optimize the biohydrogen production, a pH of 6.0–8.0, a temperature of 32–42 °C, and biomass hydrolysates with an RS concentration of 3–12 g/L were used. The working volume was 20 ml. The incubation time was 30 h. C. butyricum CGS5 was pre-cultured on the cultivation medium with pH of 7.0 at 37 °C as mentioned in Section 2.1. Following that, the 16 h old pre-culture with OD600 = 3.7 was transferred to a fresh cultivation medium to start the experiments. The inoculum size was 20% (v/v) of pre-culture. As a control experiment, biohydrogen fermentation was also conducted using autoclaved C. vulgaris ESP6 biomass without any chemical or enzymatic treatment."
5,Improvement of hydrogen production by pH-control strategy,"2.4 Improvement of hydrogen production by pH-control strategy A pH-control strategy was employed to improve the performance of biohydrogen production from the microalgal biomass. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 prior to cultivation. After the fermentation started, the culture pH gradually decreased due to formation of acid metabolites. The pH was allowed to decrease to a level of 5.0, 5.5, or 6.0, and the pH was then kept at that value, respectively, by automatic titration with 1N NaOH. The incubation time was 30 h. The working volume was 150 ml."
6,Measurement of glucose and xylose concentration,"2.5 Measurement of glucose and xylose concentration The concentration of glucose and xylose was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an RI detector (LC-10AT, RID-10A, Shimadzu, Japan). The column for analysis was ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 (Transgenomic, USA) with the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min [22]. The temperature of the column was controlled at 55 °C. The mobile phase was 0.008N H2SO4. The injection sample volume was 20 μl."
7,Analysis of gas and soluble products,"2.6 Analysis of gas and soluble products The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector. The column was packed with Porapak Q and the carrier gas was argon [17]. The temperature for the column was initially 50 °C, and this was then increased to 200 °C at the rate of 30 °C/min. The injection temperature was 140 °C. The soluble products (volatile fatty acids and ethanol) were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a refraction index detection (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Japan) in the filtered (0.2 mm) supernatant of culture broth during bioH2 production [23]."
8,Results and discussion,
9,The effect of pretreatment methods on reducing sugar formation from the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6,"3.1 The effect of pretreatment methods on reducing sugar formation from the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6 Microalgal biomass is mainly composed of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, with the latter generally used as the source of biofuels, such as biodiesel [9,24]. The residue of microalgal biomass after lipid extraction is rich in carbohydrates and proteins, and can be used as animal feed or substrates for biogas production [25]. In this work, the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6 grown under photoautotrophic conditions with feeding of 2% CO2 was used as the substrate for hydrogen production with C. butyricum CGS5. Literature shows that the pretreatment/hydrolysis of sugar-rich algal biomass (such as seaweed) may be required to enhance the solubility of algal biomass and the release of reducing sugars contributed by the carbohydrates of algal biomass [26,27]. Hence, the effects of various pretreatment methods for microalgal biomass on hydrogen production efficiency were also investigated in this work. As indicated in Fig. 1 a, the conversion of microalgal biomass to reducing sugars (RS) increased with the concentration of HCl, reaching nearly 100% RS yield (based on total RS in microalgal biomass) at 1.5% HCl, and leveled off thereafter. Note that the RS yield was calculated based on the amount of RS released from the microalgae biomass out of the total RS content in the microalgae biomass (approximately 57% of dry biomass shown in Section 2.2). Thus, 100% RS yield (based on total RS in microalgal biomass) is equivalent to 57% RS yield based on dry microalgal biomass. The optimal concentration of HCl for hydrolyzing microalgal biomass is thus 1.5%. Under this condition, nearly 0.51 g/L glucose and 0.06 g/L xylose can be generated from 1.0 g/L of microalgal biomass. These results demonstrate the feasibility of dilute acidic hydrolysis using 1.0–1.5% HCl without the need of enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, the microalgal biomass was also hydrolyzed with alkaline treatment. As shown in Table 1 , using 0–10 g/L NaOH (combined with or without 0.2% H2O2) for the pretreatment, the highest reducing sugars concentration released from the microalgal biomass was only 0.03 g/L, representing a maximum sugar conversion of only 0.3%. This demonstrates that the biomass of C. vulgaris ESP6 could not be hydrolyzed under the alkaline pretreatment conditions examined. Moreover, 0.2% H2O2 was supplemented to NaOH solution for the microalgal biomass treatment to determine whether this method would improve the sugar conversion, but it turned out that addition of H2O2 had no effect on sugar formation (Table 1). Therefore, to improve the hydrolysis efficiency, the endo-glucanase at a dosage of 120 U/ml was used to hydrolyze the alkaline pretreated microalgal biomass. The results indicated in Fig. 1b show that the sugar conversion was significantly increased to nearly 100% after enzymatic hydrolysis for 48 h when the microalgal biomass was pretreated with 10 g/L NaOH. The results mentioned above indicate that alkaline pretreatment alone cannot efficiently hydrolyze the microalgal biomass, but could breakdown the structure of the cell walls, making the biomass easier to hydrolyze. As a result, a high hydrolysis efficiency of the microalgal biomass can be achieved when appropriate alkaline pretreatment was combined with enzymatic hydrolysis indicated in Fig. 1b. It also shows that the addition of H2O2 reduced the sugar conversion, probably due to the inhibition of cellulases used by H2O2, which is a strong oxidant and may have denatured the enzymes."
10,Biohydrogen production potentials by using hydrolysates of C. vulgaris ESP6 obtained from different pretreatment methods,"3.2 Biohydrogen production potentials by using hydrolysates of C. vulgaris ESP6 obtained from different pretreatment methods It is known that different pretreatment and hydrolysis procedures on microalgal biomass may result in different reducing sugars composition and may also generate chemical inhibitors (such as furans) that are harmful to follow-up biofuels conversion via microbial fermentation processes [28]. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine whether the hydrolyzed microalgal biomass obtained in this study can be efficiently converted to biohydrogen by C. butyricum CGS5. As indicated in Fig. 2 , the highest cumulative hydrogen production (1424 ml/L) was achieved by using the acid pretreated hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6 (Fig. 2), while the hydrolysate obtained from alkaline pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis was less efficient for biohydrogen generation. The lower hydrogen production performance by using microalgal hydrolysate with alkaline pretreatment might be due to the presence of high NaCl concentration resulting from the neutralizing of NaOH before being subject to dark hydrogen fermentation. Moreover, poor biohydrogen production (470 ml/L) was observed when the microalgal biomass was not pretreated with chemicals or enzymes (except for being sterilized by autoclave), suggesting the need of biomass pretreatment. The soluble metabolites produced were mainly butyrate (accounting for 55–60% of total soluble microbial products), followed by acetate and lactate."
11,Effects of environmental factors on biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6,"3.3 Effects of environmental factors on biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6 Literature shows that hydrogen production from bacteria is greatly influenced by the medium pH and temperature [14,17]. Accordingly, the effects of medium pH and temperature on hydrogen production from microalgal biomass hydrolyzed with acid treatment were examined. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the maximum production rate (143 ml/L-h) and yield (1.02 mol/mol RS) occurred at pH 7.0, while the production (1424 ml/L) at pH 7.0 was similar to that (1447 ml/L) at pH 8.0. Based on the maximum production rate, pH 7.0 was thus chosen as the optimal condition for hydrogen production in the following experiments. The results of temperature effects are shown in Fig. 3b. The maximum production rate (143 ml/L-h) and yield (1.02 mol/mol RS) was obtained at 37 °C, while the maximum production (1611 ml/L) occurred at 32 °C. Based on the maximum production rate, 37 °C was chosen as the preferable condition for the following experiments. Thus, in summary, the best pH and temperature for hydrogen production is 7.0 and 37 °C, respectively (Fig. 3). These results are slightly different from those proposed in previous report, where the optimal conditions were pH 5.5 and 37 °C [14]. This might be due to the different feedstock used in each study, which may have a significant impact on dominant metabolic pathways."
12,Effects of substrate concentration on biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6,"3.4 Effects of substrate concentration on biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6 In addition to pH and temperature, the composition and concentration of substrate is also an important factor affecting the kinetics of biohydrogen production [14,29]. Thus, the effect of composition and concentration of the microalgal hydrolysate was investigated in this work. Biohydrogen production was conducted at different microalgal hydrolysate concentration (based on the reducing sugar (RS) concentration). As indicated in Fig. 4 a, the cumulative hydrogen production and maximum hydrogen production rate increased along with the increase in the concentration of microalgal hydrolysate for the concentration range of 3–12 g RS/L. Both the highest cumulative hydrogen production (1424 ml/L) and hydrogen production rate (143 ml/L-h) occurred at the concentration of 9 g RS/L. When the concentration was above further increased to 12 g RS/L, the cumulative production and production rate decreased, especially for the hydrogen yield. Sugar analysis shows that the hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6 contained 51% glucose and 6% xyloseper dry weight, thereby being suitable to be used as the substrate for biohydrogen production. In the literature, the most widely used substrates for hydrogen production are glucose, sucrose, and starch, while using xylose as the carbon source for dark fermentation was also examined [23]. As indicated in Fig. 4b, the utilization percentage of glucose decreased slightly from 100% to 85% when the concentration of microalgal hydrolysate was increased from 3 to 12 g RS/L. A significant reduction in xylose utilization from 88% to 5% was observed for an increase in hydrolysate concentration from 3 to 12 g RS/L, implying that glucose was catabolized preferably over xylose. It was also observed that the increase in hydrolysate concentration caused a decrease in a decrease in hydrogen yield. Fig. 4 shows that as the reducing sugar utilized increased from 1.7 to 5.2 g/L, the yield decreased from 1.16 to 0.94 mol/mol. This may suggest the possibility of substrate inhibition when the hydrolysate concentration was too high. To obtain the highest maximum hydrogen production rate, the microalgal hydrolysate of 9 g RS/L was used as the optimal condition for follow-up experiments."
13,Using pH-control strategy to enhance biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6,"3.5 Using pH-control strategy to enhance biohydrogen production from hydrolysate of C. vulgaris ESP6 The results shown earlier indicate that an initial pH of 7.0 was preferable for biohydrogen production, whereas hydrogen evolution stopped when the pH was lower than 5.0. This is mainly because at this low pH the cells cannot grow. Therefore, the control of pH seems to be a key operation parameter to improve the hydrogen production performance [17]. In this study, an innovative way of control pH was employed to improve the performance of biohydrogen production. In this pH-control strategy, the culture pH was started at 7.0 and when the pH decreased to a desired level (i.e., 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0) during dark fermentation, the pH was controlled at that fixed value. As indicated in Fig. 5 a, the highest production rate was 246 ml/L-h when the pH of the medium was controlled at 5.5. Meanwhile, the cumulative production (1476 ml/L) and yield (1.15 mol/mol) were also the highest under this pH-control condition. This optimal pH is the same as that proposed in our previous work for C. butyricum CGS5 when using sucrose as carbon source [17]. This suggests that the change in the type of carbon source did not affect the optimal pH for the C. butyricum CGS5 strain for dark fermentative hydrogen production, even when a complex substrate like microalgal hydrolysate was used. Fig. 5b shows that nearly 100% utilization of glucose by C. butyricum CGS5 was observed while using the pH-control approach, while the glucose utilization efficiency decreased to about 88% without pH-control. In contrast, the utilization of xylose was always lower than 40% regardless with or without pH-control. Comparing the results shown in Fig. 5a and b, the increase in glucose utilization may contribute to the increase in biohydrogen production and production rate. These results suggest that the best pH-control strategy was that the initial pH was set at 7.0, followed by a pH-control at 5.5. Under this optimal operation conditions, the maximum hydrogen production rate and hydrogen yield obtained from this work is better than those reported in related studies (Table 2 )."
14,Conclusions,"Clostridium butyricum CGS5 was successfully grown using the hydrolysate of a carbohydrate-rich microalgal isolate (i.e., C. vulgaris ESP6) for biohydrogen production. Acid pretreatment with 1.5% HCl was the preferable method for hydrolyzing C. vulgaris ESP6 when compared with the combined alkaline pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. The optimal conditions for hydrogen production were 37 °C, hydrolysate loading of 9 g RS/L and pH-control at 5.5. Under these optimal conditions, the cumulative hydrogen production, production rate, and yield were 1476 ml/L, 246 ml/L/h, and 1.15 mol/mol RS, respectively."
