0,Introduction,"Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have triggered much attention due to their environmental friendliness, highly efficient energy conversion, easy accessibility and high power density (Dekel, 2018; Pan, An, & Zhao, 2018). There are two types of PEMFCs: one is currently commercial acidic PEMFCs which utilize a proton-conducting membrane as a solid electrolyte under a low-pH environment. The other is alkaline PEMFCs (also known as anion exchange membrane fuel cells, AEMFCs) in which hydroxide ions transport through an anion exchange membrane (AEM) under a high-pH environment. Compared with acidic PEMFCs, AEMFCs possess faster electrochemical kinetics and less corrosion, thus allowing the application of non-precious metal catalysts (Vincent & Bessarabov, 2018). In an AEMFC, the function of AEM is to transport hydroxide ions, separate the cathode and anode, and prohibit the crossover of fuel and oxidant. Therefore, high ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and sufficient alkali resistance are necessary for AEM materials. Typical AEMs are made of aromatic polymers grafted with cationic groups (usually -NR3 +). However, the grafting of cationic groups onto these aromatic polymers (e.g. poly(ether sulfone) (Pan et al., 2014; Strasser, Graziano, & Knauss, 2017), and poly(arylene ether) (Qin, Xiao, & Fang, 2018)) always go through a process of chloromethylation and subsequent Menshutkin reaction, during which strongly carcinogenic chloromethyl methyl ether is an inevitable reagent (Hickner, Herring, & Coughli, 2013). Besides, high price of these polyaromatics is also a barrier for their large-scale production. Therefore, developing highly conductive AEMs also with low cost, green and easy preparation process is one of the hot topics in the field of AEMFCs. Chitosan (CS), a natural alkaline polyelectrolyte with excellent film-forming property, has found its place as a membrane material in the field of pervaporation, ultrafiltration and fuel cells (Wan, Peppley, Creber, & Bui, 2010). Due to many -OH and -NH2 groups in its structure, CS can be easily quaternized without undergoing the seriously carcinogenic chloromethylation step. Furthermore, CS-based membranes can effectively prevent the crossover of methanol, which can increase the methanol fuel efficiency and thus make CS attractive for its application in fuel cells using methanol as the fuel (Ma & Sahai, 2013). Generally, quaternized chitosan (QCS) with high ionic conductivity can be obtained through increasing the numbers of quaternary ammonium groups. Unfortunately, such strategy often results in severe swelling ratio, which sharply reduces the mechanical and thermal stability of AEMs. Several approaches have been reported to solve the trade-off problem between ionic conductivity and mechanical property. Among these modification approaches, organic-inorganic hybridization is a promising one because it can take full advantages of organic and inorganic components and even obtain the performance beyond those of single material due to the synergistic effect (Gong, Zhao, Tsen, Hu, & Zhong, 2019; Hu, Tsen, Chuang, Jang, & Zhang, 2019; Liu, Tsen, Jang, Hu, & Zhong, 2020). For instance, Wang and Wang (2014) incorporated SiO2 nanoparticles into QCS matrix, and the as-prepared membranes exhibited enhanced mechanical property, but their ionic conductivities decreased probably due to the inferior OH− transport ability of silica. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been proved to be an excellent inorganic anionic conductor (Tadanaga, Furukawa, Hayash, & Tatsumisago, 2010). Because of the positively charged feature of LDHs, the attached water molecules in the interlayer along with large numbers of hydroxyls on the host layers contributes to the formation of abundant hydrogen bond networks along two-dimensional surface, facilitating the conduction OH− ions via diffusion mechanism. However, the common preparation methods usually produce LDHs with muti-layer stone-like morphology because of strong van der Waals force and ab-face stacking among nanosheets during the drying process (Chen, Felton, Buffet, & O’Hare, 2015), resulting in severe aggregation in a polymer matrix and thus the essential anion conductivity of LDH cannot be fully utilized. Several approaches, such as exfoliation/reassembling process (He, Cao, He, Zhao, & Mao, 2018), employing an extra electric field (Zhu, Li, Chen, Wang, & Wang, 2016), surface modification of LDH (Chen, Long, Li, Wang, & Lu, 2018), have been reported to facilitate its distribution in hybrid AEMs. Besides, the construction of 3D hierarchical nanostructures composed of nanoscale building blocks has been verified to be an effective method to obtain LDHs with high active sites and surface area. In our previous work (Zhao, Tsen, Hu, Zhong, & Liu, 2020), LDHs nanoplatelets were assembled onto SiO2 nanospheres to form a flower-like hierarchical structure, which guaranteed the vertically fewer layer growth of LDH nanoplatelets, thus rationally utilizing the intrinsic merits of LDH nanoplatelets. As a result, the performance of direct methanol fuel cells was improved by 1.8 times for LDHs wrapped SiO2 nanospheres-based composite membranes. Herein, a continuous effort to construct 3D hierarchical nanostructures is reported. QCS was first prepared and then was blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to improve mechanical strength of QCS, the optimal proportion of PVA and QCS was investigated. Meanwhile, 3D hierarchical flower-like LDHs with nanometer-sized building blocks was synthesized via a one-pot ethylene glycol-assisted solvothermal method. We assume the active sites of LDH nanosheets can be fully exposed, and thus impressive ion conductivity, alkali and fuel resistant ability of LDH nanosheets can be rationally utilized. Afterwards, composite AEMs were fabricated by incorporating different contents of 3D LDHs to the optimized QCS/PVA matrix. The positive effect of 3D LDHs on physical-chemical properties of the membranes was discussed by the results of ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical ability and methanol permeability. The alkaline direct methanol fuel cell performances were also evaluated to investigate feasibility of the practical application of our composite AEMs."
1,Experimental,
2,Materials,"2.1 Materials Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, M w = 77,000), chitosan (CS, degree of deacetylation = 80–95 %, viscosity = 50–800 mPa s), and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (GTMAC, purity ≥98 %) were supplied by Aladdin Reagent Co. (China). All other analytical grade reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China)."
3,Preparation of quaternized chitosan,"2.2 Preparation of quaternized chitosan 10 g of CS was dissolved in an acetic aqueous solution (500 mL, 1 vol.%) and then 10 g of GTMAC was added and reacted with CS for 6 h. subsequently, the mixed solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times and then dried at 60 °C overnight. The degree of quaternization of QCS in chloride form (QCS-Cl−) was 40(±1.5)%, tested by a conductometric titration using a standard AgNO3 solution. QCS in OH− form was then obtained by immersing QCS-Cl− in a KOH solution (1 M) at room temperature for 36 h."
4,Preparation of 3D hierarchical flower-like Mg-Al layered double hydroxide,"2.3 Preparation of 3D hierarchical flower-like Mg-Al layered double hydroxide 3D Mg-Al layered double hydroxides were prepared as follows: Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (4 mmol), Al(NO3)2·9H2O (2 mmol) and urea (26 mmol) were dissolved in a 60 mL of ethylene glycol and H2O (V/V, 9/1) mixed solution with stirring. Afterwards, the well-mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 160 °C for 6 h. The white solid precipitate was then collected by filtration and washed several times with ethanol and deionized water thoroughly, and then dried at 100 °C overnight."
5,Preparation of QCS/PVA and QCS/PVA-LDH composite membranes,"2.4 Preparation of QCS/PVA and QCS/PVA-LDH composite membranes QCS/PVA blend anion exchange membranes with different QCS/PVA ratios were fabricated via a typical solution-blending method to investigate the optimal addition content of PVA as follows: QCS and PVA were dissolved in an acetic aqueous solution (2 vol%) and hot deionized water (90 °C), respectively. The two solutions were then mixed together under stirring. Then, a certain amount of glutaraldehyde was added into the mixed solution to crosslink QCS and PVA for 2 h at 25 °C. Finally, the solution was cast onto a glass plate and dried at 60 °C to obtain the blend membranes. Varied amount of 3D LDHs nanoplates were incorporated into the optimized QCS/PVA polymer matrix to prepare the composite membranes. The preparation procedure was similar to that of QCS/PVA membrane except that a calculated amount of flower-like LDH ultrasonic dispersion was incorporated into the optimized QCS/PVA mixture solution before crosslinking. The obtained membranes were named as QCS/PVA-x-LDH, in which x refers to different percentages of filler mass in the entire membrane."
6,Characterization,"2.5 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F, Hitachi Co., Japan) was employed to observe 3D LDH morphology. The morphologies of membranes were observed by scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU8010, Hitachi Co., Japan.). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) (Nicolet 308, Thermo Electron Co., Massachusetts), X-ray diffraction (D8 Advance, Bruker Co., Germany) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (EscaLab 250Xi, ThermoFisher Scientifc Co., USA) were further carried out to investigate the chemical structure of 3D LDH and membrane samples. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on STA 6000 analyzer (PerkinElmer, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 protection. A mechanical testing instrument (XLW(EC)-A, Jinan Languang electromechanical technology co. LTD, China) was employed to achieve the room temperature mechanical strength of the membranes (width × length = 1 × 2 cm2) with elongation speed of 3 mm min-1."
7,"Water uptake, swelling ratio and ion exchange capacity","2.6 Water uptake, swelling ratio and ion exchange capacity Water uptake and swelling ratio of membrane samples were determined via the differences in the weight and dimension under wet and dry conditions. Before testing, all samples were completely dried and the dry weight (W d) and dry area (S d) were measured, subsequently, the samples were shelved into deionized water at 30 °C or 60 °C for 24 h and the wet weight (W w) and wet area (S w) of the samples were recorded after removing liquid. The calculations are shown as the following equations: (1) W a t e r u p t a k e = W w - W d W d (2) S w e l l i n g r a t i o = S w - S d S d The gravimetric IEC values (IEC w) were evaluated through the Mohr titration method (Zhao et al., 2020). All the membranes were immersed into 0.5 M Na2SO4 for 48 h to make Cl− fully displaced with Na+. The exchanged Cl− ions were titrated via 0.1 M AgNO3 and K2CrO4 as the indicator. The titrated IEC w values were calculated as below: (3) I E C m = 0.01 × V A g N O 3 m ( d r y ) Here, mdry and V AgNO3 are the mass of dried membranes and volume of AgNO3 solution during the titration process, respectively."
8,Ionic conductivity and methanol permeation,"2.7 Ionic conductivity and methanol permeation The ionic conductivities of membranes were measured by an instrument (Autolab PGSTAT 302 N, Netherlands) from 1 to 106 Hz. The conductivity was calculated as follows: (4) σ = L R × A Here, L (2.10 cm in this work) is the distance between the two reference electrodes, A (cm2) and R (Ω) are the membrane area and the experimental resistance obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The methanol crossover was measured via a diffusion cell. The membrane was sandwiched by the two reservoirs. One was equipped with water (reservoir A), and another was equipped with methanol (2 M, reservoir B). The change of methanol concentration in reservoir A was monitored via a gas chromatography (TRACE 1300, Thermo, USA). The methanol permeability can be calculated from membrane thickness, increase rate, reservoir volume and normalized to initial methanol concentration as described in our previous work (Liu, Tsen, Jang, Hu, & Zhong, 2019)."
9,Alkaline stability,2.8 Alkaline stability The membrane samples were immersed into a 2 M KOH solution at 30 °C for 100 h to investigate their alkaline stability according to ionic conductivity loss. Each sample was tested three times to calculate the bicarbonate conductivity.
10,Cell performance,"2.9 Cell performance The membranes were sandwiched between a cathode (catalyst was P t, 2.0 mg cm−2) and anode (catalyst was P t-R u, 4.0 mg cm−2) without hot pressing to prepare Membrane electrode assembly (MEA, 2 × 2 cm2). DMFC measurement was performed via an instrument (Autolab PGSTAT 302 N, Netherlands) at 60 °C. The anode was supplied with the fuel (2 M methanol in a 5 M KOH solution) at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 and the cathode was fed with O2 (50 mL min-1). The durability test was performed on an AEMFC at the constant voltage of 0.4 V. The AEMFC was operated at 60 °C with 2 M MeOH + 5 M KOH as the anode fuel. We stopped the AEMFC working at 40, 140, 216, 264 h, 350 h and 420 h to obtain the polarization and power density curves."
11,Results and discussion,
12,Characterization of QCS,"3.1 Characterization of QCS FT-IR was used to investigate the successful quaternization of CS and the obtained FTIR spectra are depicted in Fig. 1 a. As for CS, a broad band at 3432 cm−1 belongs to the stretching vibration of OH and NH , and the bands at 2920 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibration of CH3 and CH2. Additionally, the two peaks at 1640 cm−1 and 1421 cm−1 are associated with the bending vibration of NH, and OH . The characteristic bands of CN and CO stretching vibration appear at 1383 cm-1 and 1081 cm−1, respectively. As for QCS, two new bands at 3018 cm-1 and 1484 cm−1 are related to the stretching and bending vibrations of CH of quaternary ammonium groups in GTMAC, confirming the successful quaternization of CS (Wan et al., 2010). Besides, the weakened band intensity of -N-H bending vibration peak at 1640 cm−1, which is caused by the decreased number of -NH2 groups after grafting quaternary ammonium groups, further confirms the ring-opening reaction between amino group in CS and epoxy group in GTMAC. The XPS survey-scan spectra and high-resolution N 1s spectra of CS and QCS are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. As for the survey spectrum of QCS-Cl- in Fig. 1b, in addition to the peaks of C 1s (∼285 eV), N 1s (∼399 eV) and O 1s (∼529 eV), two new peaks of Cl 2s (268.1 eV) and Cl 2p3 (199.2 eV) can be observed due to the Cl- ions carried by quaternary ammonium groups. The –NR3 + peak at 401.1 eV in the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of QCS (Fig. 1c) is the evidence of quaternary ammonium groups grafted on the structure of CS. The thermal stabilities of CS and QCS were investigated by TGA and the curves are plotted in Fig. 1d. As for CS, it demonstrates only one decomposition stage that is located in the range of 250–500 °C with the final residual weight of ∼37 %. As for QCS, two degradation stages can be found in its DTG curve (as shown in the inset of Fig. 1b): the first stage (150–230 °C) is due to the decomposition of quaternary ammonium groups. The second one (230–500 °C) is resulted from the decomposition of CS main chains. When compared to that of CS, the initial decomposition temperature of this stage reduces to 230 °C owing to the reduced crystalline degree of QCS after quaternization. At 700 °C, the residual weight is ∼28 % that is lower than that of CS at this stage, which is mainly caused by the thermal decomposition of quaternary ammonium groups on QCS."
13,Optimization of the blend ratio between QCS and PVA,"3.2 Optimization of the blend ratio between QCS and PVA QCS with high ionic conductivity can be obtained through increasing the numbers of quaternary ammonium groups. Unfortunately, such strategy often results in excess water uptake and severe swelling ratio and thus the mechanical and thermal stability of AEMs are sharply reduced. Therefore, an interpenetrating network structure was constructed by blending QCS with PVA to balance ionic conductivity and swelling ratio. To determine the optimized proportion of QCS and PVA, the swelling ratio and HCO3 − conductivities of the membranes were tested because OH- conductivity values are not unstable when exposed to air (Zhao et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 2 , the swelling ratio and HCO3- conductivities of the blend membranes both display a downward trend with increasing PVA content. For example, when the proportion (QCS:PVA) varies from 9:1 to 6:4, the ionic conductivity and swelling ratio decrease from 2.80 mS cm-1 to 1.64 mS cm-1 and from 199.91% to 128.71%, respectively. Despite the membrane with proportion of 6:4 obtains the lowest swelling ratio, the ion conductivity is also as low as 1.64 mS cm-1, which is 0.64 mS cm-1 lower than that of the membrane with 7:3 proportion. Therefore, taken the balanced ionic conductivity and swelling ratio into account, the optimized proportion of QCS and PVA was selected as 7:3 to fabricate composite membranes."
14,Characterization of 3D flower-like LDHs,"3.3 Characterization of 3D flower-like LDHs 3D LDHs were prepared via a facile ethylene glycol-assisted solvothermal method and the possible formation mechanism is depicted in Fig. 3 a. Mg2+ and Al3+ first coprecipitate with the assistance of OH− and CO3 2- provided by a steady hydrolysis of urea, and thus form LDH crystal nuclei and then grow into LDH nanosheets. Meanwhile, these nanosheets self-assemble into anomalous three-dimensional architecture due to the structure directing role of ethylene glycol (Ahmed, Pan, Ashiq., Li, & Tang, 2019) which is considered to kinetically control the growth rates of different crystallographic facets because ethylene glycol can increase the viscosity of the mixed solvent and its two hydroxyl groups of ethylene glycol can chelate with metal ions in the solution. After aging at high temperature, anomalous three-dimensional LDH aggregates merge together to form hierarchical spheroids. With further aging treatment, single LDH nanosheet grows deeper within spheroids, leading to the formation of uniform 3D hierarchical flower-like nanostructure. The morphological features of the obtained LDHs were observed using TEM (Fig. 3b and 3c). Different from the traditional stone-like aggregates, uniform 3D flower-like spheroids consist of numerous self-assembled nanoflakes with about 0.5–1 μm in diameter. From the high-magnification TEM image of LDHs (Fig. 3c), edge-to-face stacking LDH nanoflakes with thicknesses of around 8.3–17.6 nm attach to each other to develop flower-like nanostructures and there is no stand-alone plate-like LDHs, certifying the LDH nanoflakes are inclined to grow in the form of single or double layers. EDS image (Fig. 3d) further proves that the as-synthesized LDHs are comprised of Mg, Al, C, N and O and the molar ratio of Mg/Al is close to 2:1. The typical reflection peaks ((003), (006), (009), (110)) in powder XRD pattern (Fig. 3e) of the LDHs is in good agreement with the literature (Xu, Yu, & Gao, 2013) and no other diffraction peaks can be found, verifying the high purity of 3D LDHs. Fig. 3f depicts the FTIR spectrum of as-synthesized LDH. The intense and broad peaks at ∼1644 cm−1 and 3379 cm−1 are attributed to the bending and stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups related to the interlayer water molecules, respectively (Xu et al., 2013). The intense peak at ∼1348 cm−1 could be designated as stretching vibration of intercalated CO3 2- and/or NO3- ions. The bands ranging from 500 to 1000 cm−1 are designated as the lattice vibrations of metal-oxygen-metal, metal-oxygen and oxygen-metal-oxygen (i.e., Mg2+ and Al3+) (Yu, Luo, & Jia, 2012). XPS spectrum of 3D LDH is depicted in Fig. 3g: the peaks of magnesium (∼1304 eV for Mg 1 s, ∼50 eV for Mg 2p), aluminum (Al 2p, ∼74 eV), oxygen (O 1 s, ∼532 eV) are attributed to the elements of brucite-like layers of LDH, the peak of carbon (C 1 s, ∼285 eV) is ascribed to the intercalated anions. In conclusion, the results of TEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS confirm the successful synthesis of 3D LDHs."
15,Characterization of the QCS/PVA-LDH composite membranes,"3.4 Characterization of the QCS/PVA-LDH composite membranes 3.4.1 Water uptake, swelling ratio, IEC and ionic conductivity of Membranes Water in AEMs is deemed to influence the ion dissociation and fabrication of ion conducting channels because the conduction of OH− ions can take place along the water molecules network via the formation/cleavage of hydrogen bonds (Gong et al., 2019). However, excess water leads to severe solvent swelling and threats the dimensional and mechanical stabilities of AEMs. Moreover, too high water uptake can also dilute the ion concentration and thus brings an adverse effect on conductivity. Therefore, balancing the water content and swelling ratio of AEM materials is important. To investigate the effect of LDHs on the water uptake and swelling ratio of QCS/PVA polymer matrix, the two values were tested at 30 °C and 60 °C and the results are shown in Table 1 . The pristine QCS/PVA blend membrane exhibits a very high water uptake of 307.46 % because of a large number of hydrophilic groups (e.g. NH2, OH, N R3 +), thus resulting in a high swelling ration of 147.77 % (30 °C). With the incorporation of 3D LDHs, the water uptake and swelling ratio at both 30 °C and 60 °C decrease in line with the loading content of LDHs. The chain motion of the blend matrix might be inhibited to some extent with the addition of 3D LDHs nanoplates, and therefore the water molecules could not easily enter into the composite system. The reduced water uptake and swelling ratio upon 3D LDHs are indicative of the enhanced dimensional stabilities of composite membranes. IEC is indicative of the amount of anion exchangeable groups in an AEM. In general, an AEM with a comparatively higher IEC value is more likely to construct continuous ion transfer pathway through the membrane, thus obtaining a higher ionic conductivity. According to the IEC results in Table 1, as the incorporation content of 3D LDHs increases from 0 wt% to 6 wt%, the IEC values show a continuous increasing trend and the QCS/PVA-6% LDH composite membrane possesses the highest IEC of 2.54 mmol g−1. Two factors could be accounted for the increased IEC values: (1) LDHs consist of positively charged brucite-like layers with exchangeable charge compensating anions situated in the interlayer regions, endowing LDHs with excellent ion exchange capacity (Fan, Zhu, Li, Chen, & Han, 2014); (2) the anion dissociation ability of the composite membranes is promoted due to the reduction of crystalline degree of the QCS/PVA blend matrix. However, there is a slight drop in IEC values with further addition of 3D LDHs (e.g. 8 wt.% and 10 wt.%), which may derive from the agglomeration of 3D LDHs in the matrix, thus hindering ion exchange in the composites. Ionic conductivities at different temperatures and 100 % R.H. in this work were tested in their bicarbonate form (exposed to air) and OH− form (under N2 protection), respectively. As exhibited in Fig. 4 , the bicarbonate and hydroxide conductivities of all the membranes are positively related to temperature because of easier ions and molecules diffusion and the larger free volume in the membranes at higher temperatures, which indicates a thermal activated process (Gong, Zheng, Liu, Wang, & Cheng, 2016). Besides, the positive effect of 3D LDHs on conductivity is also observed. The conductivities including bicarbonate and hydroxide conductivities of the composite membranes keep rising when the LDHs content is below 6 wt.%. For instance, the OH- conductivity of the pristine QCS/PVA membrane is 25.7 mS cm-1 (80 °C), while this value of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH composite membrane is 38.2 mS cm-1, displaying a 48.6 % growth. Such a high conductivity of the composite membrane is also higher than those of some conventional LDH-based AEMs or other QCS or QPVA-based composite membranes (as shown in Table 2 ). The increased ionic conductivity may be ascribed to the following aspects: first, the formation of the interface between QCS/PVA and 3D LDHs contributes to the arrangement of hydrophilic groups on polymer chains along the surface of 3D LDHs, which is of benefit to ionization and deionization of basic groups for vehicle transmittance and ionic hopping in terms of Vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism. Second, the abundant hydroxyl groups on 3D LDHs nanoplates could form hydrogen bonding with free water, causing the enhancement of conductivity through Vehicle mechanism. Third, the higher concentration of basic groups due to the reduced water uptake along with the higher IEC values of the composite membranes can provide more ion exchange sites and thus transport more hydroxyl ions via hopping. However, the conductivity begins to decrease with further incorporation of 3D LDHs, which might originate from the reduced transfer pathways because of the aggregation of 3D LDHs within the membrane matrix. 3.4.2 Membrane morphology and structure characterization SEM characterization was applied to study the filler dispersion in AEMs and the cross-sectional images are shown in Fig. 5 . All the membranes display a fairly dense and non-defective morphology. Compared with the pure QCS/PVA membrane, the cross-section morphology of the composite membranes was rougher with obvious wrinkles after the addition of 3D LDHs. Besides, as shown in the SEM images of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH membrane at different magnifications (Fig. 5d and g), the 3D LDHs are homogenously dispersed throughout the whole cross section, which can be further proved by the uniform dispersion of Mg (Fig. 5h) and Al (Fig. 5i) elements. The homogenous dispersion of nanoplates is beneficial to forming high-quality hydrogen bond network in the composite system, thus leading to enhanced mechanical strength and ionic conductivity that will be discussed in the later sections. However, when the nanoplates content is more than 6 wt.% (e.g., 8 wt.%), some obvious aggregations come to emerge (see the yellow circles in Fig. 5e), which might bring some opposite effects on the performance of the composite membranes. XPS was used to compare the change of the interaction between QCS/PVA and 3D LDHs nanoplates. As shown in Fig. 6 a and b, compared with the QCS/PVA-6% LDH membrane, the binding energy values of Mg 1 s (1304.6 eV) and Al 2p (74.5 eV) in the bulk 3D-LDHs exhibit shifts to 1306.6 eV and 75.0 eV, respectively, indicating increased oxidation states of Mg and Al in LDH nanoplates. The binding energy shifts might be ascribed to the formation of the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction between LDHs and QCS/PVA macromolecular chains. XRD analysis was applied to examine the influence of LDH on the crystallinity degree of the composite membranes. As depicted in Fig. 6c, the broad peak at 2θ equal to 19–20° in all the membranes is ascribed to the diffraction of the (200) plane of PVA and QCS crystalline phases (Yang & Wang, 2015). Compared with the pristine QCS/PVA membrane, this peak intensity in the spectra of the composite membranes becomes weaker as the nanoplates incorporation content is below 6 wt.%, demonstrating a decrease in crystallinity of the composite membranes. For example, the crystallinity degree values of the pure QCS/PVA membrane is about 42.3 %, while the QCS/PVA-2% LDH, QCS/PVA-4% LDH, and QCS/PVA-6% LDH composite membranes exhibit the crystallinity degree of 29.9 %, 27.3 %, and 24.4 %, respectively. Such decease is probably because the hydrogen bonds between PVA and QCS macromolecular chains are partly weakened owing to the strong interfacial interaction between 3D-LDHs and polymer chains (Zhao et al., 2020). This increased amorphous phase content accompanied by the decreased crystalline is believed to be beneficial to the ionic conduction through the whole membrane owing to the amorphous phase-dominated ion transport in polymer electrolytes (Ma & Sahai, 2013). However, the crystallinity degree of composite membranes comes to increase when 3D-LDHs incorporation content is beyond 6 wt.% (e.g. 28.6 % for QCS/PVA-8%, and 45.1 % for QCS/PVA-10 % LDH) because of the agglomeration (revealed in Fig. 5e). 3.4.3 Mechanical and alkaline stabilities The mechanical properties of the composite membranes were investigated using tensile test. The representative stress-strain curves are plotted in Fig. 7 a and the data are shown in Table 1. As for the pristine QCS/PVA membrane, its tensile strength and elongation at break are 14.9 MPa and 49.9 %, respectively. With the incorporation content of 3D LDH nanoplates ranging from 2 wt.% to 6 wt.%, the tensile strength values increase from 17.9 MPa to 26.6 MPa. The enhancement of tensile strength is mainly attributed to the following reasons: (1) the homogeneous dispersion of 3D LDHs increases the interface contact area, which can help load transfer from the polymer phase to the stiff inorganic phase; (2) the well-dispersed 3D LDHs can adsorb the polymer chains due to the strong interfacial interaction and thus form effective physical cross-linking in the composites. Both of the two factors can prevent the slippage of polymer chains when the composites are subjected to stress, thereby enhancing the resistance to deformation. However, the strength of the composites begins to show a downward trend with further increase in the content of 3D LDH nanoplates. The composite membrane with 10 % LDH exhibits the strength of 22.0 MPa that is about 21 % lower than that of the QCS/PVA-6% membrane. Such result is commonly caused by the aggregation of nanoplates that can act as stress concentration points and therefore result in the damage of whole membrane under a small stress field. Besides, the elongation values keep decreasing from 49.9%–21.0% after the addition of 3D LDHs up to 10 %, which is similar to many rigid nanofiller reinforced polymer systems (Gong et al., 2016). From the above results, all the composite membranes displayed enough mechanical strength, satisfying their application requirements for AEMFCs. Sufficient alkaline stability is decisive to long-term operation of AEMs in AEMFCs. Herein, the membranes were separately immersed in a 2 M KOH solution for 100 h at 25 °C and their residual bicarbonate conductivities at 80 °C were measured to compare their chemical stabilities. As depicted in Fig. 7b, the residual ratio for the pristine membrane is only 75 %. The drop in conductivity of the pristine membrane primarily originates from the Hofmann degradation and/or direct nucleophilic displacement in quaternary ammonium groups in QCS (Pan et al., 2018). In contrast, with the incorporation of 3D LDHs, at least 78 % residual conductivity can be maintained after the stability experiment. Among all the membranes, the QCS/PVA-10 % LDH displays the highest alkaline stability of as high as 92 % residual conductivity ratio, which is superior to other conventional LDH-based AEMs (only 40 % residual ratio for QPPO-LDH in 1 M KOH after 100 h (Zhu et al., 2016)). In addition, all the nanocomposite membranes show higher alkaline stability than that of pristine QCS/PVA membrane. This enhancement can be explained as follows: (1) the steric hindrance caused by 3D LDH nanoplates partly reduces the accessibility of OH− attack to quaternary ammonium groups; (2) LDH itself possesses excellent resistance to alkali. 3.4.4 Methanol permeability Fuel permeation through membranes is regarded as another challenge in fuel cells using methanol as the fuel (Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, the methanol permeability values of the prepared membranes were tested at room temperature. As displayed in Fig. 8 , a gradual decrease in methanol permeability with increasing the content of 3D LDHs can be observed. The introduction of 10 wt.% 3D LDHs significantly decreases the methanol permeability to 5.84 × 10−7 cm2 s-1 (30 °C) which is about 3.5 times lower than that of the pristine QCS/PVA membrane (20.67 × 10−7 cm2 s-1). The decrease in methanol crossover of the composite membranes is indicative of the positive effect of 3D LDHs on fuel-rejecting ability. This can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding derived between the two materials, which can not only narrow the mass transfer channels but also compact the structure of the composite membranes. 3.4.5 DMFC performance Selected QCS/PVA-6% LDH composite membrane, pure QCS/PVA membrane, and commercial acidic Nafion-115 were fabricated MEAs to evaluate single DMFC performance at 30 °C and 60 °C. The obtained cell polarization and power density curves are displayed in Fig. 9 a and b. For the same membrane, the single cell displays higher open circuit voltage (OCV) and peak power density at higher working temperatures. This increase benefits from the faster electrode reaction at higher temperatures. In addition, by comparing the curves of the two different samples, it can be found that the composite membrane shows better cell performance including OCV and power density. For example, the peak power density of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH membrane is 39 mW cm−2 (30 °C), which is 56 % higher than that of the pure QCS/PVA membrane. As temperature increases to 60 °C, this value for the composite membrane further increases to 73 mW cm−2, demonstrating 83 % increase when compared to that of the pure QCS/PVA membrane. The addition of 3D LDHs remarkably increases the cell performance, which is because of the higher ionic conductivity together with lower methanol permeability of the composite membrane. Although the peak power density of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH membrane is a little lower than those of the commercial Nafion 115, the composite membrane still displays its applicability in AEMFCs. Finally, we further evaluated the durability of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH membrane during a long-term AEMFC test at a constant voltage of 0.4 V at 60 °C. Fig. 9c shows the polarization and power density curves at different testing time. From the data over the continuous operating time, the fuel cell performance can keep stable during the first 264 h testing time period. The power density is 70.3 mW cm−2 at the beginning of test and still remains the value of 66.2 mW cm−2 after 264 h of fuel cell operation. In a subsequent test, the AEMFC performance decreases slightly to 58.4 mW cm−2 after 350 h and more obvious performance loss (ca. 27.2 mW cm−2) occurs over the next 70 h of fuel cell operation. From the above results, the fuel cell performance and durability of our composite membranes are comparable to those of other composite AEMs (as listed in Table 2). The satisfactory fuel cell performance verifies that our designed biomass based composite membranes composed of QCS/PVA blend polymer matrix and 3D LDHs inorganic nanofiller could be a promising AEM material with low cost, environmental friendliness and easy preparation process. Moreover, the idea of this manuscript will broaden the application fields of natural polymers while can provide a new methodology to produce high-performance anion exchange membranes because this strategy can be easily applied in other aromatic polymers-based composite system."
16,Conclusions,"In summary, a series of QCS/PVA-LDH composite membranes with different content of 3D LDHs were prepared and characterized. The mechanical strength of the composite membranes increased owing to the incorporation of uniformly-dispersed 3D LDHs which can serve as physical cross-linking points to prohibit the rupture of polymer chains. Moreover, the construction of 3D LDH nanosheets can fully expose active sites of LDH nanosheets. As a result, the ionic conductivity of the QCS/PVA-6% LDH composite membrane increased by 46 % and its residual conductivity can remain 92 % after immersing in a KOH solution for 100 h. Besides, the methanol permeability the composite membrane (6% LDH) remarkably decreased to 5.84 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 which was about 3.5 times lower than that of the pristine membrane. The increased ionic conductivity and decreased methanol permeability lead to the increase in the maximum power density for the composite electrolyte, which exhibited the value of 73 mW cm−2, whereas the pristine membrane displayed only 40 mW cm−2."
